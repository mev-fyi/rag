00:00:00.320 - 00:00:04.140, Speaker A: Welcome to Goodgame. Your no BS insights for crypto founders.
00:00:08.080 - 00:00:25.780, Speaker B: You guys did something really creative, which is you guys were still building the product on testnet, but you started dogfooding your own product. Especially Travis, he started tweeting about the deck of five cards and then he picked me as one of the five cards and then he tagged me and he wrote a really funny comment.
00:00:26.080 - 00:00:26.428, Speaker C: He.
00:00:26.464 - 00:00:43.988, Speaker B: He puts out a lot of really funny, funny things on Twitter, but he tagged me and then he commented something really funny. And then I noticed you guys from that tweet. So I reached out to Travis, hey, let's chat. What are you building? And then basically within like 20 minutes of chatting with Travis. By the way, Travis may or may not be real.
00:00:44.124 - 00:00:44.900, Speaker A: It might be you two.
00:00:44.940 - 00:00:45.940, Speaker B: Yeah, it might be one of you.
00:00:46.060 - 00:00:46.788, Speaker D: May have been you.
00:00:46.844 - 00:00:56.476, Speaker B: But after 20 minutes of talking to Travis, I was like, imran, you gotta talk to these guys. And then you chatted like literally the next same day or something. And then we're like done.
00:00:56.628 - 00:00:58.252, Speaker A: Looking for your next startup idea in.
00:00:58.276 - 00:01:00.428, Speaker B: Crypto, check out our request for startups.
00:01:00.444 - 00:01:29.490, Speaker A: List and get inspired at alliance xyz. Forward slash ideas. Welcome to Goodgame. Today we have Mikado and Kipit from Fantasy. They're the founders of Fantasy. And today we're going to be talking about the journey in crypto, how they found the product, the product market, fit, marketing, talking about user acquisition. There's been a lot of tweets about how do you expand from here.
00:01:29.490 - 00:01:46.112, Speaker A: We could maybe touch on the social aspect of things where, you know, how do you see the competitive landscape with front tech pump, maybe forecaster, and then maybe about the future later on. Yeah, cha. What do you want to talk about?
00:01:46.296 - 00:02:13.630, Speaker B: Same want to pick their brain on the early stage of building Fantasy, how they got their first hundred users, where the idea came from. They basically set the playbook for building consumer products. I haven't seen anyone who build a product released on Testnet and let people play for a few months and then go production mainnet. There's like stuff like this that you guys really innovated.
00:02:13.710 - 00:02:20.750, Speaker C: Yeah, we were not even in testnet. It was all on the database. It's not even a thing. That's the best part, actually.
00:02:20.790 - 00:02:57.950, Speaker A: Well, let's touch on that a little bit because we're already talking about it. So for frontech, when Fronttech first launched, the first phase or the beta, I kind of considered a beta phase right before they pivoted to doing club keys, that phase, a lot of people were actually really upset. Right. Because I think they collected like $40 million in ETH. And all the fees that were collected on the transactions were like. You could think about it two ways. One is when you have great product momentum, then it's obviously very positive for Racer and the team.
00:02:57.950 - 00:03:16.440, Speaker A: But in this case they ended up pivoting and people are really pissed that they spent $40 million in fees to use the product. And so in your case, what you guys did was you launched on testnet first iterated to the point where you think the product was actually semi good for people to start speculating on. Was that like intentional?
00:03:16.860 - 00:03:25.332, Speaker C: Yeah, it wasn't 100% like we've been building for three years with my brother and Travis.
00:03:25.476 - 00:03:27.120, Speaker A: But is Travis real?
00:03:29.980 - 00:03:40.482, Speaker C: In my mind, I think it is on Twitter, it is definitely okay. As a real person, it might be like someone from OpenAI. I haven't known him.
00:03:40.506 - 00:03:43.910, Speaker D: So yeah, very advanced AI agent.
00:03:45.450 - 00:04:21.294, Speaker C: We've been building for so many for so long and I think what we've learned so far is to iterate as fast as possible and make all the circles so like shorter and shorter in terms of feedback. And when we had this idea of Fantasy, it was really more like just a funny idea that we had, like, let's play a game. And we actually started like building it for ourselves, like just playing with 10 friends and that was all, and started releasing this to other people. People liked it, gave some feedback. And so it was really like after two weeks, we had like the basic mvp. Nothing was on the blockchain, everything was in our database. The card didn't look the same, the tournament were not the same.
00:04:21.294 - 00:04:34.166, Speaker C: Like the old gameplay was completely different. And yeah, we just iterated, iterated and people liked it and we knew how to select the good feedback and the one that we thought was the right one to iterate on.
00:04:34.318 - 00:04:39.286, Speaker B: What did you guys build before Fantasy? Like you built a bunch of things right for a couple of years.
00:04:39.358 - 00:05:12.370, Speaker D: Yeah. We started the two of us building things in the dao space at the time where we wanted to do DAO tooling to enable better communities, to build stuff together and organize and these kind of things, which was a very great idea. But daos went completely nowhere and even this whole coordination thing was wasn't gonna cut it. And the way we built product also wasn't very right. The way we like made it out there and the way we tested it.
00:05:12.490 - 00:05:17.922, Speaker C: The first product, it took us, I think, like three months to build it and we had no feedback from Community at all.
00:05:17.946 - 00:05:32.482, Speaker D: Like we started from feedbacks like trying to do a Lot of user interviews and do these kind of things like. Like trying to do the book of. Yeah. Talk to your users, do that. And then you go in the product and then you get lost in the product a bit. Then you release it and. And.
00:05:32.482 - 00:06:16.202, Speaker D: And you have something that is not exactly what you have a lot of competition in a space that is very niche and you don't have that many product market fit for anyone building DAO tooling in general. Then we pivoted, we tried some other stuff like we did a lot of hackathons, a lot of different things on weekend project and things like that. We then started AAA which was an NFT lending aggregator. BusyKatie was like there were so many NFT lending platforms it was really tough to know what was the best rate that you would get for your nft. The all the period of time and these kind of things. So a very good idea on paper with a lot of value. I still think it has some value but it's still very much a niche.
00:06:16.266 - 00:06:21.290, Speaker C: Market is too small. Yeah, it is very. We actually applied twice with. For alliance with these products actually.
00:06:21.330 - 00:06:23.066, Speaker D: Did you? Oh really? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:06:23.098 - 00:06:24.682, Speaker C: No we never talked like we never.
00:06:24.706 - 00:06:29.786, Speaker D: Talked like we applied. I think maybe we even applied with the. The previous one like the DAO thing.
00:06:29.858 - 00:06:36.538, Speaker A: This sounds really familiar. I was going to ask you if we spoke before because all the NFT stuff comes.
00:06:36.594 - 00:06:41.402, Speaker D: No, we haven't actually talked but I think we applied like. I think dilly and then.
00:06:41.506 - 00:06:51.866, Speaker C: Yeah, like the first time was D so like long time ago the down tooling stuff and then the second one was for AAA like a month or two before we start like we ended up the product so it was straight.
00:06:51.898 - 00:06:53.578, Speaker B: To the reject pile. We didn't even.
00:06:53.634 - 00:06:55.210, Speaker D: Yeah. So like on.
00:06:55.250 - 00:07:01.642, Speaker C: On the same code like Aliens 12 because around November also this was last batch.
00:07:01.706 - 00:07:22.210, Speaker D: Yeah. So we applied like November, October never got. I mean like we have a time of the project where it was like we at this moment we had like maybe like 100 daily user that was like actively returning. So it was like. Like it was meaningful for some people. We were starting to make a little bit of revenue. It was looking okay but it wasn't like that crazy.
00:07:22.210 - 00:07:44.970, Speaker D: And we applied with those stuff but not. Not putting too much thought into it. And then we had more of a disk down moment for the two months and so appeared where we were working a bit less on this started like jamming around some other ST stuff. Then fantasy came up. Two weeks later we had the mvp. We were already quite big on Twitter with The grocery we had. Then you heard about it.
00:07:44.970 - 00:07:52.010, Speaker D: You told us on Friday. Okay, let's accelerate you in the batch. Two days later, we're in New York.
00:07:52.870 - 00:07:54.142, Speaker A: It was like 48 hours.
00:07:54.246 - 00:08:39.678, Speaker B: So I actually want to touch on that because you guys did something really creative, which is you guys were still building the product on Devnet, on Testnet, but you started dog footing your own product. Especially Travis, he started tweeting about the deck of five cards, and then he picked me as one of the five cards, and then he tagged me and he wrote a really funny comment. He puts out a lot of really funny things on Twitter, but he tagged me and then he commented something really funny. And then I noticed you guys from that tweet. So I reached out to Travis, hey, let's chat. What are you building? And then like basically within like 20 minutes of chatting with Travis, by the way, Travis may or may not be real.
00:08:39.814 - 00:08:40.590, Speaker A: It might be you two.
00:08:40.630 - 00:08:41.630, Speaker B: Yeah, it might be one of you.
00:08:41.750 - 00:08:42.478, Speaker D: May have been you.
00:08:42.534 - 00:08:52.270, Speaker B: But after 20 minutes of talking to Travis was like, imran, you got to talk to these guys. And then you chatted like literally the next same day or something. And then we're like, done, done.
00:08:52.310 - 00:08:56.680, Speaker D: Yeah, no, that was very fast, but very. No, that's great.
00:08:57.140 - 00:09:10.236, Speaker B: So your previous product, you built several products before you made a couple of mistakes. One is it took you like three months to build a product. And another one is you talk to users before you build a product.
00:09:10.388 - 00:09:38.520, Speaker D: Yeah, exactly. Trying to do a lot of user interviews, even trying to make sure that we don't ask a straightforward question. We let them speak and all this. But it's in the end, very hard to still differentiate what the user actually wants, because they will never take the trouble to tell you straight, like directly in your face that, no, I don't give a fuck about this shit. So they always say, yeah, yeah, it's great. And they were all in some daos, but nobody's really actually in a daos. Like, it's just a group of friends.
00:09:38.640 - 00:09:39.160, Speaker A: Discord.
00:09:39.240 - 00:09:45.928, Speaker D: Yeah, in Discord. So it's like not serious enough. Nobody had really money, so it's. Yeah, it's this kind of projection was.
00:09:46.064 - 00:10:04.938, Speaker B: So this is one of the most common mistakes that first time founders make is that they talk to users before building the product, which counterintuitively is a bad thing to do because users tend to lie to you before you put the product in their hand. There's no upside for them to say, I hate your product.
00:10:04.994 - 00:10:05.834, Speaker D: Yeah, 100%.
00:10:05.922 - 00:10:11.946, Speaker B: They will always tell you, hey, yeah, I Love it. I'll try it. So what did you guys do differently with Fantasy?
00:10:12.058 - 00:10:54.528, Speaker D: I think the main things that we did is heavily left curving, no overthinking before that. Every time we wanted to play around with some product or think about ideas, we always needed this kind of like a, you know, big thinking, big vision, saying, okay, yeah, like the dao space or the NFT space will be like this. And. And we didn't want it to go in a direction that felt like too little. Like every time we were oh, but yeah, this Discord bot and stuff, it was like, yeah, but that's not a product, it's not a startup. You know, it didn't felt like this billion dollar stuff or whatever. So we were always trying to put like the big stuff idea, like more in the long term, disregarding the small products which are actually what user wants.
00:10:54.528 - 00:11:44.512, Speaker D: Like in the nobody wants to be out of Discord or telegram if you want to do some social stuff or chatting or stuff like this. And then we're always trying to put it way too far, like big ideas, big thinking. And then with this, with seven, Daisy was just embracing the speculation aspect of crypto, appreciating it as one of the main product market fit, that crypto has the fun of social stuff and then just not thinking and doing memecon style, trying to do as fast as possible, never thinking about it and always just adjusting based on what the user was actually doing and not trying to put a grand vision, which now we have a much more big vision about what fantasy can be. But initially it was just this small stuff that looked fun and now they're thinking it.
00:11:44.616 - 00:12:20.934, Speaker B: Yeah, okay, so there's a couple points here. One is you had a hunch of what the product should look like. You didn't talk to users, you just built it and it took you maybe a month or two to put it on testnet and then you roll it out to users and see how react. So that's the first thing which is very different from what you used to do, which was talking to the user first and then build a product. So that's great and I think that's what most founders should do. A good idea tends to come from your intuition, a gut instinct, a hunch of what that product should look like rather than feedback from users. The first idea should come from your gut instinct.
00:12:20.934 - 00:12:28.890, Speaker B: So that's the first thing. The second thing is speculation. Embracing speculation. But there's something else.
00:12:29.870 - 00:12:32.406, Speaker D: The big idea or the big vision.
00:12:32.518 - 00:12:33.494, Speaker C: Aiming too high.
00:12:33.582 - 00:12:45.046, Speaker D: Yes, because aiming too high or disregarding Smaller stuff which would have market feats, but which felt like it's not a startup. It's like a kid thinking like a pitch deck.
00:12:45.078 - 00:12:46.934, Speaker C: Like you want to build a pitch deck.
00:12:46.982 - 00:12:47.690, Speaker D: Exactly.
00:12:48.430 - 00:12:50.372, Speaker B: So this actually is some TAM.
00:12:50.436 - 00:12:50.724, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:12:50.772 - 00:13:24.610, Speaker B: So this is something that both founders and VCs tend to do at the earliest stage. Is founders pitch VCs a huge TAM. Like they will say, oh, this is a $10 billion market. And, and this is why. And then VCs also want to hear like a huge number for the tam, otherwise they can't to justify an investment. Yeah, but the actual, in actuality, whenever you come up with a TAM number, like huge TAM number, there's always a ton of assumptions going behind that number. And these assumptions tend to be very incorrect.
00:13:24.610 - 00:13:53.876, Speaker B: And so what we like to see is you're actually building something super interesting, however niche it might be. You're building something creative, interesting, or solving a real problem. And that's exactly what fantasy did. In the early days, we didn't know if fantasy was going to be big. You guys didn't know if fantasy was going to be big. But now you know, and we think that fantasy is going to be big now. So the point being, when you start building something, don't try to think about the size of the market.
00:13:54.028 - 00:13:55.300, Speaker A: Well, the market could be wrong too, right?
00:13:55.340 - 00:13:56.212, Speaker B: The market could be wrong.
00:13:56.276 - 00:13:56.612, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:13:56.676 - 00:14:01.236, Speaker C: And the market could shift and change a lot too. And you're going to change a lot. Your idea.
00:14:01.428 - 00:14:03.940, Speaker B: And the best product actually creates the market.
00:14:04.060 - 00:14:05.716, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, that's for sure. That's true.
00:14:05.748 - 00:14:13.108, Speaker B: Like before pump, no one knew that pump was going to make like a million dollars a day. But pump created the market and that's.
00:14:13.124 - 00:14:21.316, Speaker A: Where we are with crypto. Right. Crypto is creating net new markets with speculation as an example, 100%. So I think if I can add.
00:14:21.388 - 00:14:47.970, Speaker C: That'S really something that also that we embrace like embracing speculation. And I think that before we were like, at least for me, talking to me, I was having this high moral of no speculation can be bad and trying to find something that's. And in the end just let people do what they want and just listen to what the market wants and just build what people actually want to use. And just don't try to force your vision of high morality on the market because in the end it won't.
00:14:48.050 - 00:14:53.410, Speaker A: Well, there's two, there's two, I think, schools of thoughts in crypto. One is decentralization.
00:14:53.570 - 00:14:54.194, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:14:54.322 - 00:15:08.130, Speaker A: Own your data, non speculative, like kind of like high moral, etc. Then there's the other which is like the degenerate autistic speculative communities. And it turns out most of the product market fit you could find is on the right.
00:15:08.170 - 00:15:09.068, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, 100%.
00:15:09.154 - 00:15:18.488, Speaker A: And not saying the left is going to win either. I also think that there is an opportunity for like pure decentralized products to work, but I think that's like a more of a longer time horizon.
00:15:18.584 - 00:15:54.650, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean it's like I think like we arrived in this space like in 2017 for the Burund of 2017 and at the time like it felt like most of the people we met in Ethereum conferences and stuff like this were these high moral people like very into decentralization and things like this. And now it's like the space is maturing also realizing that this realization is not always the right answer. And then there is time also to create some actual consumer product where you have to think more as a web to startup and consumer stuff and not trying to impose your moral and your decentralization onto something that could be meaningless.
00:15:54.730 - 00:16:22.716, Speaker A: So I feel like where we are right now is a, is a shift in consumer versus infrastructure because all of the thinking over the past 10 years let's say has been primarily around infrastructure. Like you have to have high moral, it has to be purely decentralized and et cetera. But now it's all about the consumer. And when you're going towards the consumer you have to embrace all of it. Like you have to go actually the opposite of what the infrastructure people are thinking about.
00:16:22.788 - 00:17:09.900, Speaker C: And also like when you go to the infrastructure side it's a bit of an excuse, you can wait because you're not the one building the app. So if people don't manage to create the app that bring all those users you can say and you have so many money that you can stay on as long as you want compared to consumer app, if fantasy fail in the next year or so then we'll have maybe some of the shots to try something else. But it's not just like an infra product where you raise like 40 million and you know that you have like five years or so to just build and wait to see if the market is going to react to you. So also when you build consumer I think you don't, you can't like make an excuse to yourself. You have to build something that people want to use and that have like actually use like product and that can be fun. So I think that's what pushes us to do this.
00:17:10.520 - 00:17:42.612, Speaker B: So relatedly, you guys know Donald the Duck, the ggcr and he tweeted something to the effect of most people now agree that crypto is mostly useless and blah blah, blah. And he got Donald. Oh, that's right, he said that. But then someone else said it, which I thought was really interesting, was that this is the first cycle where people think that crypto is most useless, but this is also the first cycle where crypto is actually useful for something.
00:17:42.716 - 00:17:43.812, Speaker A: Oh, I read that too and I.
00:17:43.836 - 00:17:52.788, Speaker B: Thought, yes, crypt fantasy is one of those examples. And there's FranTech and there's Farcaster and there's USDC, stablecoin and even meme Coin.
00:17:52.884 - 00:18:24.592, Speaker C: I think Meme Coin is the best go to market and the best product market feed that crypto has fun. Everyone want to wait for retail to come. NFT in 21 was about like, oh, when retail will come and use nft, it's going to be crazy. We're going to do this and that. During the ICO boom in 2017 it was oh, the smart contract is going to change the world and everything. But now we have the infrastructure, we have the product and we have like hundreds of million, like no, like millions of users that are actually ready to use it. And so Mincoin is just the first crypto native product I think that people are actually using and having fun to do.
00:18:24.616 - 00:18:41.376, Speaker A: So what do you think shifted about crypto? Was it the launch of Privy and frontech that kind of like enabled people to think more about consumer. What. What kind of like there has to be some sort of like stepping stone into the space was what was it?
00:18:41.528 - 00:19:23.238, Speaker D: I mean like for on. On the Mincoin side, I think people were fed up about the old infra project high ftv. Like you're trying to pretend to be like this high intellect stuff where in the end most of the time was not just some smoking smoke screen and nothing else. And then for consumer part like the infrastructure actually helped. We're maybe shitting too much on infrastructure. But without preview, without even like L2s and some good bridges and some good onboarding and some good this kind of stuff and learning about PWA and these kind of things like friend tech wouldn't have been that successful fantasy either. And all the consumer projects and even.
00:19:23.294 - 00:19:40.928, Speaker C: In terms of fees like Solana is. Is really, really cheap and people just want to. If you want to have fun and just do do some stuff without thinking too much about how much you're going to earn because it costs you like 10 bucks to do the transaction, then you need to have low fees. And this is possible with Solana, L2s and all that kind of stuff.
00:19:41.024 - 00:19:48.352, Speaker B: I think scaling is actually the biggest factor. So fantasy wouldn't have been possible last cycle. Yeah, There was no L3 and Solana was not ready.
00:19:48.416 - 00:19:49.216, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:19:49.328 - 00:19:54.280, Speaker B: And neither would be friendhack wouldn't have been possible last cycle.
00:19:55.180 - 00:20:15.428, Speaker C: To be fair, last cycle Arbitrum was already there. So I think it's privy would not have been there, so it would have been harder to do so. But I feel that Arbitrum in terms of fees, especially with Blast Blast still hasn't moved to the new 4337 thing. That lowers the fees. So we still have fees that everyone had for the past.
00:20:15.484 - 00:20:17.842, Speaker B: Didn't Arbitrum go live in 2022?
00:20:18.036 - 00:20:23.670, Speaker D: No, it was, I think was earlier. It was earlier, like I'd say 21. For me it was 21.
00:20:23.710 - 00:20:29.110, Speaker B: But even if it was 21, like people weren't comfortable enough. Now people are.
00:20:29.230 - 00:20:33.862, Speaker C: Yeah. Everything was more about defy and. And way less about consumer product.
00:20:34.046 - 00:20:42.102, Speaker A: I feel like nobody really cared about consumer either. I think people were stuck on the DeFi NFT. Nobody really thought outside of the box.
00:20:42.166 - 00:20:43.254, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah.
00:20:43.382 - 00:20:53.922, Speaker A: And in fact, like every L2 that launched every all the founders just focused on creating the same thing over again. DeFi NFT. DeFi NFT because like the next ave on another layer every time we had.
00:20:53.946 - 00:21:16.270, Speaker D: Like those new primitives, like 2017, it was like some smart contract blockchains and it was a defi rafter. Then it was NFTs DAOs. Like every time there's this new primitive, like all the people that really likes to intellectualize and say, okay, it's going to be like this in the long term, we wait, everybody thinks about this. But in the end of never about.
00:21:17.230 - 00:21:18.770, Speaker C: Oh, it's going to be like this.
00:21:21.390 - 00:21:23.254, Speaker A: You know, it was a circle jerk.
00:21:23.382 - 00:21:59.350, Speaker D: It was a circle jerk. And so you end up never actually facing what the user wants. Like so many times when I explain stuff about crypto, like explaining to normies, crypto always makes me realize like so stupid these kind of things can be. And then it's never like a way like focus enough on what the user wants to be doing or like the fun they want to be having. It's always too much about trying to impose this big vision of the DAOs and NFTs that could be used in these and that against the tyranny of Apple or of whatever big company and stuff like this.
00:21:59.890 - 00:22:17.236, Speaker C: And oftentimes it's nice we're on the opposite. Like when I explain fantasy explained on top of Instagram, for example, when talk to normies, they actually understand the whole idea. They still find it to be crazy because they're not used about speculation and that kind of direct link to artists and fun, basically. But still they understand and they get it.
00:22:17.308 - 00:22:19.080, Speaker A: Did you just say fantasy on Instagram.
00:22:20.380 - 00:22:32.320, Speaker C: When I'm talking about normies? Since they don't like Twitter, I'm using Instagram, Spotify. We could do basically anything. Even you take GitHub Start for developers and create a fantasy on top.
00:22:33.740 - 00:22:48.930, Speaker A: So I guess one of the questions I've been asked over and over again when I sent the tweet out yesterday about fantasy, how does fantasy expand from Twitter? Or more or less, I guess crypto, Twitter specifically, but then Twitter and then beyond.
00:22:49.010 - 00:22:52.002, Speaker B: I asked Travis this question when I first met him.
00:22:52.106 - 00:22:53.310, Speaker A: I did too, by the way.
00:22:56.170 - 00:23:09.106, Speaker D: Right now what people need to understand, and I think we're trying to communicate this heavily with the community is that all of this that we are doing, we were doing this in Testnet for three months and now it's still in Mainnet, but it's still a test bed into beta.
00:23:09.138 - 00:23:09.938, Speaker A: It says beta on there.
00:23:09.994 - 00:24:03.162, Speaker D: Beta. Exactly. Like we're trying to figure out even right now, with the real incentive and real money, how things can really work together between the players, the heroes, the whales, the nut whales, the big followers, the low followers. Like all those people that can have a meaning into fantasy, but trying to figure out exactly what type of tournaments they want to have, the type of rewards, the type of things where even now we're trying a lot of things and it's really raw and sometimes it doesn't work or it takes time. And we're trying to push heavily on this for the community to understand that we are all trying together to build these models that then can be extended outside of crypto. Because like the crypto people, they are very used to speculation, they're very used to things going wrong or going weirdly, and they don't go too crazy about something like, oh, my portfolio went up or went down. They figure out less about these kind of things.
00:24:03.162 - 00:25:18.572, Speaker D: So it's really important that now we can figure out all together the type of tournaments, the type of game, the new gameplay that we want to be adding, the type of heroes they want to be having, the type of segments that they won't have in terms of categories. One, together we're more mature, then we can expand and basically everybody that will have been playing with us in testnet and mainnet can be sure to be very successful when fantasy Expands. But it's really like this test bed into figuring out the formula into going outside of the crypto Twitter. First on Twitter in some other ecosystem and then expanding to other social media and really trying to, to make this incentive layers that can be added on top of any socials that makes sense and that doesn't jeopardize both the users and the hero. And right now it's like we've been live like for two weeks, three weeks maybe, and there's so many things going on and so many learnings already and we are adapting very quickly and trying to do things like very fast and shipping very fast. So we have like a very high quality, like putting the bar very high in very high velocity. But the answers to how we can expand outside of crypto Twitter is being figured out right now with all the people playing.
00:25:18.572 - 00:25:46.840, Speaker D: And it won't be that much different to what we are doing. Like the basic ideas of being able to bet on the influencers, making tournaments between friends, between other people, this is the core basis and it's been doing right on fantasy sport for a long time. So we're very sure that this is something that people enjoy to be doing and will enjoy to do. Outside of crypto Twitter, it's more about figuring out the smaller details about the incentive, the length and the parameters altogether. In Mainnet right now.
00:25:47.700 - 00:25:51.920, Speaker B: Are you worried about Twitter deplatforming you guys?
00:25:53.460 - 00:26:20.010, Speaker C: Not that much actually. I think that's what Elon Musk is fighting the most, is bot that actually writes content and we just like read content. So in some way, I don't think we are like any threats to them that much. And also at some point once we met you, like, we can try to do this on top of Farcaster, on top of like any other social media that accept us. So like where it's a load. So I don't, I'm not worried that much about.
00:26:20.130 - 00:26:23.114, Speaker A: I feel like you're helping. I mean, yeah, I mean what Elon.
00:26:23.162 - 00:26:27.706, Speaker B: Wants is you're helping Twitter getting more engagement. Like all the heroes are like crazy.
00:26:27.738 - 00:26:39.278, Speaker C: It's all a win win because like we have a crazy algorithm that makes sure that we take into account the quality and not just the quantity. And I think that's one of the tough things that we are figuring out. And so far it's been working.
00:26:39.414 - 00:26:41.770, Speaker A: You can probably help Elon find the bots, right?
00:26:42.710 - 00:26:59.542, Speaker D: Yeah. The bot suggestion is like it's a war that we'll be fighting until the end, that it's not perfect yet. Like we'll be rolling out very different systems against the bots that we're confident will be much more sustainable and much more like organic in the ways.
00:26:59.686 - 00:27:03.926, Speaker A: Maybe talk about your scoring system. I know you're on 0.4, right?
00:27:03.998 - 00:27:07.846, Speaker D: Yeah, like 0.3 and then 0.3 and then yeah, this week.
00:27:07.918 - 00:27:15.010, Speaker A: So tell us more about each iteration and what you've realized through each iteration of the bot detection program.
00:27:15.310 - 00:28:00.180, Speaker C: So the first iteration when we went on Testnets, everything was easy because there was no money. So no one was actually like botting the views and the metrics. So we were just looking at basically the number of view and the reach that you get and the absolute reach that you have. So that was the three core metric that we were taking into account and it works pretty well. And then when we launched on Mainnet, even though we had this great algorithm that was taking out the boat, there was like one thing that we underestimated that people buying followers to the heroes to make sure that their reach will decrease and that they will. Even though they will they were making as much view as before. The reach would be decreasing at the score too.
00:28:00.180 - 00:28:37.340, Speaker C: So which changed that. And we're not taking into account the following. The following numbers. And that's the big iteration that we've made to V3, making sure that big following account that have like a debt for 2021 would not get punished that much compared to what we had before and making sure that. But basically everything is fair. And now we are transitioning to something where it's really taking into account the quality of the interaction and the replies. Yes, and anything interactions in some ways a like a quote, a retreat, a reply, even the quantity of view.
00:28:37.340 - 00:28:46.780, Speaker C: We are able to have a really good view about how qualitative the interaction with this post are and how good it is.
00:28:48.690 - 00:29:42.002, Speaker D: We knew from the start that botting will be an issue. Since the very beginning we had been working on some algorithms to prevent this and we've been working very hard at it. And now the main things that we want to be doing is much like a PageRank of Google where it start from the backlink, it started from the high trusted accounts and then see those trusted websites, would they interact with the backlink that they have and then they make this graph of the trust graph of the web. It's something that we do very similarly. So in general, if we look at all the people you interact with on Twitter, 99% of them won't be bots. You don't interact with bots in general, maybe there will be Some automated accounts from some company, reposting some stuff. Sure, maybe.
00:29:42.002 - 00:30:17.348, Speaker D: But the real bots that we could have issues, the ones that are scamming, the one that are just increasing the likes or the views, like, you will never interact with those kind of people. So if we retrace the other way around, like from trusted accounts and to, like, those stuff, then we can get, like, a big amount of data into, like, the quality of those accounts. And then every time we have new accounts, we can then cross check a bit in our database, this kind of thing. So if you end up just buying, like, 1,000 views. Thousand. Like, most of the time it will come from some dead account or some random stuff where like. Like these.
00:30:17.348 - 00:30:34.884, Speaker D: We can easily detect that it's very low quality. And then. But yeah, so while making a score around these kind of things, trying to ponderate the reach that you have, like the number of views that you make, so the credibility of your accounts and how you interact with it, you're creating.
00:30:34.932 - 00:30:37.844, Speaker A: Like an internal quality of social graphs.
00:30:37.892 - 00:30:38.756, Speaker C: Yes, exactly.
00:30:38.788 - 00:30:41.396, Speaker A: Which I don't think a lot of people are working on either.
00:30:41.588 - 00:30:43.722, Speaker D: Yeah, I wouldn't say so.
00:30:43.746 - 00:31:03.914, Speaker B: It's funny you mentioned that. PageRank. When I first talked to you guys, Travis, and he presented this idea to me, the idea of fantasy to me. I immediately thought of something that happened in 2018. It was hive one, you guys know. Okay, so hive one was a thing from back in the day. Like 2018.
00:31:04.002 - 00:31:04.842, Speaker C: It actually shut down.
00:31:04.866 - 00:31:06.618, Speaker B: Like, it got shut down recently. Yeah.
00:31:06.634 - 00:31:09.138, Speaker A: But it's all the people that you follow. And it ranks based on following.
00:31:09.194 - 00:31:24.310, Speaker B: Exactly. So you rank the crypto Twitter influencers, and it gives a score to everyone, and then the score is based on the quality of other people following that person. So this is essentially page rank, but for influencer Twitter accounts.
00:31:25.210 - 00:31:29.810, Speaker A: And this also grouped you in what camp you're in, Right? Ethereum was in that.
00:31:29.850 - 00:31:55.700, Speaker B: Yes. There was a category for Ethereum, category for Bitcoin, and then others. But I thought Hive one was a very magical. Like, it was very niche, but it was very magical for me because I saw people that were like, crypto influencers that were obsessed with their own ranking. They're like, oh, shit, my ranking went down by 2 since yesterday. I want to get back to. I want to go back up in the rank.
00:31:55.700 - 00:32:23.960, Speaker B: So when I first started traffic, I thought of that and was like, holy shit. This is essentially Hive One, but monetized, like, tokenized. Truly crypto native. Because I remember talking to the founder of Hive One in 2018. He wanted to monetize that product. He brought up a bunch of really crazy ideas. And maybe the fantasy, like fantasy was one of those crazy ideas, but it could never happen at that time, at that time, because the infrastructure was not ready.
00:32:23.960 - 00:32:27.600, Speaker B: So crazy, like five years.
00:32:28.060 - 00:32:33.520, Speaker D: You should talk to the founder. Actually you should. We should reach out to him. That should be 100%.
00:32:34.240 - 00:32:48.904, Speaker A: So I guess you talked a bit about expanding to different ecosystems. Have you thought about tokens? Do these NFTs become tokens or are they always going to stay cards? Or is that something you can't talk about right now?
00:32:48.992 - 00:34:35.674, Speaker D: So we can't disclose everything, but ultimately we see those cards as kind of new financial assets that can live on its own. So it's like this financial asset that, that plays a key role into our game, but that also people can use to create some external use cases, some external utility around it from the fan to the player perspective or from the hero perspective or from a pure financial assets. So really trying to push in the direction where these can exist as a kind of meme coin of the influencers without the influencers having the responsibility of creating it and enabling it to be more like heavily traded and more financialized. So it does mean to be able to buy 10, $10 of Ensemble, even though right now like the lowest card is maybe like one eth or something like that. So it's in our plan to be able to make this much more accessible. We can't talk that much about exactly like how we want to be running out these kind of things, but it's really like the core of things that we are trying to do is making sure that the game is as fun and enjoyable to play in itself and that people are interested and want to be betting on Fantasy Social, which is what we are creating. And then people pushing people, encouraging people to build experiments around it, enabling the cards as a kind of distribution mechanisms to get in touch with the players, the fan, the heroes, and then creating a bunch of stuff which in itself like I had dreams having people holding cards, not actually playing the game, just holding the cards because they get access to some other stuff that they enjoy or whatever.
00:34:35.674 - 00:34:37.738, Speaker D: So we're really trying to push about.
00:34:37.794 - 00:34:51.917, Speaker A: Like this, this is all working backwards because we've seen you and I have chatted chow about holding creator cards or NFTs. You get special like superfan access, right? Is that how you're thinking about it?
00:34:51.973 - 00:35:01.729, Speaker D: Like, I mean, in some ways, but not in some ways, but no, we're not. It's a mix of super finance access, this is cool financial meme stuff.
00:35:02.869 - 00:35:07.501, Speaker B: Basically you can recreate friend tech on Top Fantasy for example and many more.
00:35:07.525 - 00:35:25.406, Speaker D: Examples that would be like it's a subset. Like we see it as a subset and that's why we're not trying to build ourselves like the chat room directly. We're not trying to build the social super fun stuff. Like it would be too hard to build like all those products you want third party devs. Exactly. Like and we really want to expand.
00:35:25.438 - 00:35:34.046, Speaker C: To the ecosystem on this. There is many different. Like fintech is just one product that could come out of like the cards and being like adding utility to the cards.
00:35:34.078 - 00:35:36.010, Speaker B: And you can also do a. Currently.
00:35:36.630 - 00:35:49.912, Speaker C: Yeah, like for example, like anything, like anything that the hero want to share or to do. Like, and also, also any crazy idea that people want to build, they can just try it out and, and this way we can see like what's taken and what works basically.
00:35:49.976 - 00:35:56.460, Speaker A: And WhatsApp, you guys reached out to me and they're like, well you know, we could also like take custody of the cards and go long and short. Yeah.
00:35:57.120 - 00:35:58.344, Speaker C: And they will, I'm pretty sure they.
00:35:58.352 - 00:36:55.816, Speaker D: Will do this makes, makes a lot of sense. Like for that's like we're not trying to do like okay, we'll do the uni swap of this and then the morpho of like ultimately we know we can't figure out all those products, but it makes sense. If we have a ton of things that aggregated create some utility, then it makes sense. But just a chat room is not enough to justify the price. Just an access to some zoom link is not enough. But the compounding aspect start to make sense. And now for us it's about trying to make sure that we can put out the right incentives so that people don't just build stuff where the value flows back to us, but that they get heavily incentivized so that they can build businesses and get access to some distribution channel through this and that they will selflessly leverage those cards to just take advantage of them and build a business out of it and make money to go through them and not directly to us and not just trying to be too greedy on that front.
00:36:55.816 - 00:37:12.180, Speaker D: So it's still something that we are trying to figure out exactly how the future token how our ecosystem will expand and how we can build out those incentives. So that's like the profits is equally shared between the builders, the heroes, the players, ourselves and everyone.
00:37:12.480 - 00:37:26.328, Speaker A: So your goal right now is to make sure you have highly engaged creators or heroes and figure out the quality of the social graph. If you could figure those two out, then you can have a thriving ecosystem.
00:37:26.424 - 00:37:28.984, Speaker C: Yes. And also on the player side, because.
00:37:29.072 - 00:37:30.040, Speaker A: Obviously the player side too.
00:37:30.080 - 00:37:31.166, Speaker C: Yeah, that's really important.
00:37:31.288 - 00:38:09.000, Speaker D: Like, even for the social graph, we had a small glimpse about how funny it could be and better it could be with the airdrop that we've done. Initially when we finished testnet and then we went on mainnet, we did some airdrop claim where it was not only testnet users. Testnet users got plenty of stuff and they were in general very happy with their. I was very happy and. Which was great. I mean, like we saw so many people like not having that much money playing and hustling in testnet and then getting some free packs. That's great to like one or two eve portfolio.
00:38:09.000 - 00:38:18.580, Speaker D: And they were like, so, so nice about it. It's like the more user we can make rich, the better for us. It's like one of the key things that we are looking at.
00:38:18.960 - 00:38:33.398, Speaker A: I remember Ciao and I chatted maybe four years ago. We were talking to a founder, we were talking that. We were at a talk and I think the one thing you said was like, you have to make users rich early on if you want to have a sticky product.
00:38:33.454 - 00:38:34.182, Speaker D: Yeah, 100.
00:38:34.286 - 00:38:35.990, Speaker A: I think that's what I remember you saying.
00:38:36.030 - 00:38:36.806, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah.
00:38:36.838 - 00:38:37.846, Speaker C: And I, I think.
00:38:37.918 - 00:38:41.110, Speaker A: How did you come to that conclusion? Is it. I mean, I mean, it's obviously obvious.
00:38:41.190 - 00:38:43.490, Speaker B: No experience you got rich off of.
00:38:44.030 - 00:38:48.294, Speaker D: It's a mix of this and also like looking at Pac man, it's a.
00:38:48.302 - 00:38:55.390, Speaker C: Playbook for like, it's just like so good at like displaying incentive and making sure that people end up doing what he want them.
00:38:55.430 - 00:39:00.574, Speaker A: So how much Pac man, how much of Pac man influenced you in this product development?
00:39:00.662 - 00:39:01.822, Speaker D: I'd say good bunch. Yeah.
00:39:01.886 - 00:39:10.670, Speaker C: Like the referral system is definitely inspired by that. The point system also. So, yeah, like we want to take what's like the best from the best. So.
00:39:10.710 - 00:39:11.054, Speaker A: Okay.
00:39:11.102 - 00:40:04.932, Speaker D: I mean it was also one like half of the reason we went on Blast, sure was the incentive, but it was also like trusting Pac man and believing that he knows how to drive the incentives and to build stuff. And at the time going on Arbitrum or Optimism was not very interesting. Base was an obvious candidate because Kanbase Friend Tech was there and all the stuff. But it felt like a very good decision from the incentive that we could get from Blast and then trusting Pac man in the process in building this stuff. And a lot of those things are inspired from the way Belt Blur and even Blast right Now the way for example incentivizing that hero shares their rewards with the people is also something like on blast. All the airdrops goes to the dev but then ultimately the devs need to distribute it to the devs.
00:40:04.956 - 00:40:07.000, Speaker A: But it's like an indirect social pressure.
00:40:07.900 - 00:40:08.644, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:40:08.772 - 00:40:33.872, Speaker D: It's like instead of just like okay saying yeah we'll have a token but we don't have it like all the other L2s you can name all of them. It's like yeah, we won't say we have a token but sure you can farmers but no okay now and then sometimes like you end up like it's the incentive are not really well like aligned and with these kind of things it aligned them much better. So like we're very inspired by this and also trying to reproduce these kind.
00:40:33.896 - 00:40:35.220, Speaker C: Of things in fantasy.
00:40:36.280 - 00:40:41.696, Speaker B: What do you think of Friend Tech Racer is pretty obsessed with you guys.
00:40:41.888 - 00:40:49.296, Speaker A: Didn't he put out a tweet of the Grim Reaper and it showed yeah Fantasy the day of the hack of the pumps Hack.
00:40:49.328 - 00:40:50.490, Speaker C: Yeah, that was showed.
00:40:50.600 - 00:40:52.182, Speaker D: Okay, I haven't seen that.
00:40:52.206 - 00:40:58.570, Speaker C: Yeah, you should like you know the Reaper that like yeah, yeah. There was like a star arena that was like a cookie.
00:40:59.310 - 00:41:02.290, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah that was so funny. I don't know if you see but.
00:41:02.830 - 00:41:03.974, Speaker C: I think like a couple I don't.
00:41:03.982 - 00:41:50.162, Speaker D: Like that like I mean for me like I enjoyed for the I, I enjoy it. I mean it's, it's like most of the stuff is bad ideas that it is doing but it's a bit very psychotic. Like I, I, I played friend. I love fintech like since the very beginning and I was really into it and it's also part of the inspiration out to build out fantasy like for sure like I, I, I still like admire Racer in some ways and but yeah like we, we, we saw a lot of the issues that Fran Tech had and trying not to reproduce it. One of it is trying to be very vocal and open in the way we, we talk. We approach the community and saying go yourself to everyone and, and just staying in your, in your side. But yeah it's, it's, it's funny the way interacts.
00:41:50.162 - 00:41:52.846, Speaker D: I don't know if you've seen our replies about the oh I've seen our.
00:41:52.938 - 00:41:53.590, Speaker A: I've seen it all.
00:41:53.630 - 00:41:57.126, Speaker D: We created like the card like super mean. I think it was funny like the front card.
00:41:57.158 - 00:41:57.446, Speaker B: Right?
00:41:57.518 - 00:42:00.294, Speaker D: Yeah, a lot of people this one.
00:42:00.382 - 00:42:04.410, Speaker C: But what I like is that he seems obsessed about Fantasy Top but we're not that much focused.
00:42:05.550 - 00:42:08.902, Speaker A: Rent free. You're Living in his mind. Rent free.
00:42:08.926 - 00:42:18.726, Speaker D: Yeah, rent free. Like the two Alliance 12 companies, Pump and living in a racer head and us not giving that much that you have no idea.
00:42:18.758 - 00:42:23.818, Speaker B: Racer inspires so many ideas for me and Imran. Like, we use Friend.
00:42:23.874 - 00:42:29.242, Speaker A: I love. I mean, like, look, I'm a huge friend tech. I mean I've used it at a great.
00:42:29.346 - 00:42:36.362, Speaker C: I think it really kicks out like the old social fight narrative. Like, it's definitely thanks to Friend Tech and him. So we have to give credit for.
00:42:36.466 - 00:42:41.802, Speaker B: Someone said on Twitter that Fantasy is what FriendHack could have been and should have been. Someone said that?
00:42:41.826 - 00:42:42.458, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:42:42.634 - 00:42:44.510, Speaker A: And I saw that smile.
00:42:47.330 - 00:42:48.202, Speaker C: It's a different but.
00:42:48.226 - 00:43:06.286, Speaker D: And it's also very ironic learning that we end up with the same like. Like ft. Like the two letters, like, was never green and blue. Like it was never something like we actually thought that was looking like the same. And then we selling. When people starting like saying ftft, it was like, are they talking about fintech? It was like, I know they're talking about Fantasy Top. It's like.
00:43:06.286 - 00:43:11.214, Speaker D: So it's a bit ironic that we end up with like, it's the empty of blast and FT of.
00:43:11.302 - 00:43:18.342, Speaker B: Also. I don't know about you, but. But the frantic bottom curve for me was. For me it was the inspiration for the design for Pump.
00:43:18.406 - 00:43:26.070, Speaker A: Yeah. So the bonding curve is what kind of inspired the whole. I think the bonding curve as a use case.
00:43:26.110 - 00:43:26.726, Speaker C: Yeah. 100.
00:43:26.798 - 00:43:26.998, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:43:27.014 - 00:43:27.254, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:43:27.302 - 00:43:37.542, Speaker D: I mean like it was like a pioneer. Innovated like a sheet ton. Like, I really enjoyed frametech and I really appreciate like the whole product and.
00:43:37.566 - 00:43:41.246, Speaker B: The whole team and Bonnet curve is a 2017 thing. Thing.
00:43:41.318 - 00:43:42.014, Speaker D: Oh, yeah.
00:43:42.142 - 00:43:48.334, Speaker B: And TCRS, remember that TCR bonding curve, all that stuff was from back in the day, but they never got.
00:43:48.422 - 00:43:56.478, Speaker A: I think they will over time. We just need to have an aha, like lightning the bottle moment and then there's going to be a bunch of use cases that comes out.
00:43:56.534 - 00:44:04.510, Speaker C: Yeah. I think Pump for me is really like some high moment where you see it. Like, it's just. It makes everything so much easier and direct, like having this on top.
00:44:04.630 - 00:44:14.558, Speaker A: So maybe let's talk about a little bit about frontech, the app it's today in its current form and what your thoughts are. So, Viv1 was primarily about creators.
00:44:14.654 - 00:44:15.118, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:44:15.214 - 00:44:38.068, Speaker A: With the chats. V2 is primarily about group chats and their club keys. And anyone can create a club key for anything. So you could think of this as almost analogous to anyone being able to create a pump market. Right. But in this case you have keys that represent the group chat and there's a couple roles within the group chat. One is the moderator and then the president, right.
00:44:38.068 - 00:45:16.128, Speaker A: They get some fees for managing a group chat and then the rest of his fees get split into the entire group. Then there's the bunny swap dex right. And the token is non transferable so I tweeted about this a while ago. But it's like a closed loop token model where the token never leaves the app. Everything that gets monetized gets monetized within the app. So you could say that it's you know, contrarian to what people are doing today where everyone launches their own layer 2 all the DeFi stuff is commoditized, all this shit is commoditized. Everyone just tries to run for the next app.
00:45:16.128 - 00:45:59.152, Speaker A: Racer's like I'm just going to build everything in house and I'm going to just take value from the ground up. And the second thing he did was he dropped the entire 100% of the front tech token which is sitting at roughly $2. And I think today I was looking at hog, which is the number one club. It's sitting at about $6 million in total market cap and it's the second or third largest friend tech friend token holdings at this point. That's the largest sink, third largest sink. What do you think about this model? Closed loop token model, its own dex value extraction across the board syncs with the club keys. Where do you see this going? Where in your mind? Being in the social fight space.
00:45:59.152 - 00:46:00.224, Speaker A: Where do you think this goes?
00:46:00.352 - 00:46:02.096, Speaker C: Have you entered a room by the way?
00:46:02.168 - 00:46:09.260, Speaker D: No, not that much actually I've seen it but we're so focused about countries that I haven't played the.
00:46:09.560 - 00:46:50.240, Speaker C: It has like really good advantages like being closed, completely closed. I think it's a great advantage because like all the keys and everything is like is in closed loop. So you don't have anyone eating your lunch basically I do question about like the scale effect and like that means that if want to onboard new users you need them to download the app and do everything on the app. So it's like quite a lot of burden compared to what Meancoin are now. Like when we onboard our friend and nomis to Mincoin it's just like download Phantom and just bam, you've got some stuff. So here with Fintech it will be much harder to understand and explain everything. So I think we need to see in a couple of weeks how this goes.
00:46:50.900 - 00:47:24.530, Speaker D: I think the idea is very. I still like the idea and even Though it felt hard like to I already have the keys of some influencers but then they create a group and I have to buy this new key. It's like, like the only thing I would say. I'm maybe a bit bearish. It's just like the chat room is not enough to invite you and to attract people. Like it's, it's really great to create FOMO of saying okay, I go there like there's this, these people and, and that's what I got me in and hooked with Friendex. Like I bought some keys of some different people that I respect, expected a lot and got to chat with them.
00:47:24.530 - 00:47:53.170, Speaker D: It's like so like so nice. Like otherwise they would have never answered me on Twitter or whatever. So like this kind of interaction made like a lot of sense and everybody like felt like the ha was about this. But then ultimately like you can't stay on the chat room the whole time. It's not the part time job that you're having. It's like so like sustaining the value is really tough. And that's the only thing I'm like Fantasy was built to be like, like on the platform where people already do those stuff and they don't have to.
00:47:53.210 - 00:48:06.226, Speaker C: Change to be fair, like the club, you don't. There's no one that needs to entertain the old chats always because like anyone with a key can just enter. So sure it's like that's similar to having like a discord or telegram group for the token itself 100%.
00:48:06.298 - 00:48:42.794, Speaker D: But then it's about, it's all about the community and like Meme Coins it's like a community stuff and this is also community. So it doesn't need to provide value to like still like up in price. But it's very, it's much more limited in terms of growth than what Meme Coin are doing. So it's still like feel like you can't justify the price by just the chat room and then you can have the virality but you don't have the virality on Meme Coins that pub fan can have. So it's like this complexity in my opinion and that's why Fantasy for us was really important to make sure that people and it's the number one thing that Hero loves about it is that they're already active on Twitter. It's already like part of their jobs.
00:48:42.842 - 00:48:43.754, Speaker A: You don't have to change behavior.
00:48:43.802 - 00:48:44.714, Speaker C: You don't have to change the behavior.
00:48:44.762 - 00:48:45.754, Speaker A: Maybe just be a little bit more aggressive.
00:48:45.802 - 00:49:26.182, Speaker D: Yeah. Like some people are like some heroes playing Very hard and they are like very like there's this meme and this image is popping up with fantasies that like all those heroes are gladiators in the arena fighting for themselves and like the social media athletes in some ways some people love this kind of stuff and will go very hard and will play the fantasy sport like fantasy as this social sport very deeply. Some others will just continue to do their stuff and they still still like they were chosen in the first place because they put out great content. So they can still do. Continue to do the. And people like will continue to.
00:49:26.286 - 00:49:35.490, Speaker A: Well I mean what I like about fantasy is that I have as soon as I make a tweet now I have like 10 people that read. Yeah, it's like an instant like the fantasy effect.
00:49:36.030 - 00:50:09.406, Speaker D: No. Yeah, there is some aspect of bots and non organic stuff but in general like the. It's still like very organic. Like there's a lot of things that are very organic and we're tracking heavily this kind of interaction if it comes from our legitimate account or not and 2/3 of the time and stuff if you get 200 likes most of it comes from actual accounts. So the defect is real and it's really the core aspect of fantasy. It's like heroes just continue to do their stuff. They don't have to change behavior.
00:50:09.406 - 00:50:25.230, Speaker D: They don't have to go on their app specifically. If they do it, it's perfect. If they interact with their cardhold even better. But ultimately they can just like do their stuff. Don't give a. And like yeah, it's. It's the best aspect of fantasy in my opinion.
00:50:25.730 - 00:51:02.166, Speaker A: There's always been talks about inflation for cards and just for those that know after every tournament there is some sort of inflationary reward of getting additional packs. Right. And so people talk and so I see like I think bread 0x bread guy Zenica Tyler D. Yeah, these are some of the guys that talk about the arbitrage of selling cards before the inflation versus post. How do you see this dynamic moving forward? Is this going to continue? Are you going to lower inflation? How do you think about inflation? And then this whole buying and selling.
00:51:02.198 - 00:51:58.734, Speaker C: Of cars, this is really like a key component and we are extra careful that we don't dilute too much like people and one of the things that we do is to onboard new heroes so that that way when we onboard hero last week onboarded like 40 different new heroes and so most of the card inflation came from those. So the people that had like a legendary or like a rare of this guy knew that they would not get that much diluted about this hero. And also what we want to do is tie the inflation based on the number of new users that we have. So we know that in order to have a fun game to play and to have always like a marketplace where people can just enter and with a couple of bucks just take a deck and play, we need to control this. So if there is a new lot of people coming in then we'll increase a bit the inflation. If no one is coming in then we'll make sure that there is not that much inflation. So the game is tight and we don't fuck the holders basically in a.
00:51:58.742 - 00:52:08.398, Speaker B: Way it's like the bitcoin. Having Bitcoin uses some inflation to incentivize further usage and you guys inflate the cards a little bit incentivize for it's.
00:52:08.414 - 00:52:13.486, Speaker C: The central bank of the inflation card and every week there is a meeting of the three of us and then.
00:52:13.558 - 00:52:17.822, Speaker B: Like the FOMC the fantasy it's heavily.
00:52:17.886 - 00:52:21.674, Speaker D: Based on the macro data data we.
00:52:21.682 - 00:52:24.282, Speaker C: Have gentler with us actually as part of the band.
00:52:24.346 - 00:52:40.330, Speaker D: No, but it's really. It's like the. The hardest thing I think that we need to be nailing in these ecosystems. Like when we look at the top shots they like heavily diluted their supply at the end and actually people are so mad. They were so mad about this like.
00:52:40.450 - 00:52:46.770, Speaker C: Like when you don't even understand like how they can do that. Like as a game builder you don't want to your holders and deal with.
00:52:46.810 - 00:53:09.410, Speaker D: I think they just wanted to extract value at some point and they were like too high about themselves about how good their game or whatever stuff were building and was the end of the. The. The. The bull market. And then maybe they just tried to extract as much as possible, I don't know. But also like looking at S like is handling this much better. Like they like prices are being going down but they don't have very big growth.
00:53:09.410 - 00:54:03.570, Speaker D: But they're still like manages to have like some good inflation where people don't complain about it too much. On our side we want to be even more restrictive of the inflation. Like if we wanted to be able to have those assets that can live in themselves having some utility and people holding the cards not even directly to play the game but to have access to other stuff or even as the financial asset of okay, I'm bullish on the influencers. We can't have a supply that increments too much because if you dilute within the game it's fine if you play the game because you don't lose money. It's just the other people that don't play that gets diluted. But in the framework that we want to be having, it doesn't work fully like that. So ultimately we want to be trying to make sure that we emit cards of new heroes mainly and not too much of the other ones and that we create other gameplays that are sustainable in themselves.
00:54:03.650 - 00:54:22.134, Speaker C: There is also a small alpha that we're going to release this week or next week is a burning mechanic mechanism. A new one that will come where you will be able to burn five or seven common cards to get a new one. So you burn like for the rarity that you burn, you will get the same rarity. So if you burn like five rare.
00:54:22.182 - 00:54:22.406, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:54:22.438 - 00:54:23.606, Speaker C: Then you get one new rare.
00:54:23.638 - 00:54:24.022, Speaker A: I like it.
00:54:24.046 - 00:54:36.710, Speaker C: So it's like a way to make sure that like the smaller like hero that had like a ton of supply really cheap, you can just like take those and, and take your shot at making maybe like packing an unsem or someone just like that.
00:54:36.830 - 00:54:37.350, Speaker A: I love it.
00:54:37.390 - 00:54:38.518, Speaker D: The new meme is the new meta.
00:54:38.534 - 00:54:40.426, Speaker B: Is going to be. Fantasy is now deflation.
00:54:40.518 - 00:54:51.090, Speaker D: Yeah, we tried except after the. The big tournament we distribute the rewards like the, the. The. The supply is going down. But it's a fun meme to have it.
00:54:51.130 - 00:54:59.394, Speaker C: It won't be. And all the analytics guys were like actually guys, it's not that true because one where it's five common. So it's not. Ah, come on. That's a meme.
00:54:59.442 - 00:55:31.520, Speaker D: Yeah, but the meme is good. Yeah, but yeah, like. Yeah. So like ultimately be adding also new gameplays. I think like won't be this week but the week after where it opens the door also to smaller players to play not having this high entry bar in terms of price. If you want to build a competitive deck, it can be tough right now. So we'll be trying as much as possible to make the tournaments right now accessible to lower entry players and also create new gameplays that can be sustainable in their ways.
00:55:31.520 - 00:56:00.430, Speaker D: That will be alongside what Fantasy Sports has been doing and draftking has been doing. We're taking a lot of inspiration into this so that we can create this ecosystem where the. The game in itself has multiple facets and aspects which can be sustainable in itself and we don't need to inflate the supply too much by just distributing those rewards. But it comes from some other loops from the game. But yeah, we'll see like and we'll have. We'll I'm excited a lot in the next week.
00:56:01.700 - 00:56:07.040, Speaker A: Did you just say. Stop saying. I just saw that. Don't leak too much Alpha.
00:56:09.940 - 00:56:10.876, Speaker D: That's all the plan.
00:56:10.948 - 00:56:25.626, Speaker A: I also like the fact that, you know, you reward new packs by the level of engagement or the, the level of ranking of the gameplay. So those that rank higher in the actual gameplay, they get more packs.
00:56:25.748 - 00:56:26.846, Speaker C: Yeah, Right. Yeah.
00:56:26.878 - 00:56:27.966, Speaker A: Yes, I like that.
00:56:28.038 - 00:56:29.646, Speaker C: Yeah. I think it's important to, like, do.
00:56:29.718 - 00:56:37.454, Speaker A: So you're, you're actually giving, you know, it's, it's inflationary, but it's also inflationary to your high quality users that are winning.
00:56:37.502 - 00:56:37.726, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:56:37.758 - 00:56:38.318, Speaker A: Which I like.
00:56:38.374 - 00:56:38.798, Speaker C: It's.
00:56:38.894 - 00:56:52.014, Speaker D: We tweaked the rewards like, like last reward. We like, people were not like, they, they were not happy about it that much. Like, not enough. It was not good enough for whales and not good enough for like a lower.
00:56:52.062 - 00:56:52.502, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:56:52.606 - 00:57:20.374, Speaker D: Players. And then some community people, like members spent some time on the spreadsheet and said, okay, for this time you need to do it like this. And it was very much looking to what we had in mind. So we just took the spreadsheet, we tweaked a bit, and then we release it like this. And people enjoyed, they were quite happy this time about the rewards and the fact that we listened to the feedback and that's something that we want to be trying to continue having at that moment.
00:57:20.422 - 00:57:52.206, Speaker B: It occurred to me that every consumer product I've used that I loved can be described in one sentence. And this includes both crypto products and Web2 products. So, for example, TikTok short video, YouTube long video, Facebook send each other messages, Snapchat instant videos, friend tag, like tokenized chat groups, fantasy tokenized influencers or fantasy sports for influencers.
00:57:52.238 - 00:57:53.086, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:57:53.278 - 00:57:55.610, Speaker B: And pretty much it. Like every, every product.
00:57:55.990 - 00:57:57.326, Speaker A: Meme Coin, Launchpad.
00:57:57.358 - 00:58:07.566, Speaker B: Yeah, Meme Coin, Launchpad, Instagram photos, sharing photos. Like every successful consumer product is conceptually very simple and can be described in one sentence.
00:58:07.598 - 00:58:16.094, Speaker C: Yeah, I agree. Like, the simpler, the more elegant it is, I think. And when you try to add some complicate mechanism of incentive and stuff like.
00:58:16.102 - 00:58:17.822, Speaker A: That, that's the problem with crypto, where.
00:58:17.846 - 00:58:19.822, Speaker C: You get lost because the crypto, the.
00:58:19.846 - 00:58:39.650, Speaker A: Sandbox is so open and so you had the circle jerk with Daos as an example and Defi and all this other stuff, the product has to be simple, clean. And I think Nikita said this, right. Remember, I think we've quoted him many times. But products should be built for lizard brains, right, where there's just like buttons green and red. Right. And make it simple and easy.
00:58:40.380 - 00:58:56.080, Speaker C: I think there might be too many technical people in crypto and that's, that's the infrastructure part. You can see like as a developer you always want to add like new features and this cool thing because you know the product so well that you make you think that everyone will be at the same level on you.
00:58:56.460 - 00:59:34.810, Speaker A: And there's another user that we or hacker that we talked to yesterday where I think they added every feature that they could think of in one product. Defi NFTs AI staking amm. And I looked at it, I'm like, and this is inherently the problem with crypto developers is that the sandbox is so open and you could just include whatever you want. But really simplicity is where the goal is. And I think people think that they're too gigabrain or they want to appease the research people and they build out these convoluted products. But really you gotta build for the lizard brain in.
00:59:36.150 - 01:00:29.440, Speaker D: It's also I say like one of the other issues with those incentives. Like once you have like a product and you have a token, like oftentimes if you try something new or some new stuff and then it fails, it will hurt like the value of your token more than just trying to do nothing and just hyping up the things and just like a lot of teams are just doing this, like hyping up some new release, some, you know, some partnerships and stuff like this because they would take too much risk in terms of the value of their token in actually trying something new or completely different and then failing. And then so there's a bit maybe these bad incentives. And like some people were saying about fantasy, I was like, oh, it's the first like a time that I see a game where then they use NFTs and they're trying to put out NFTs and saying later, oh, we will do the game. But for most NFT collection I think it's. So that was part of the issue.
01:00:30.060 - 01:00:33.748, Speaker A: If you're good, we can go with what crypto Twitter wants to learn more about.
01:00:33.884 - 01:00:34.964, Speaker C: Yeah, let's go.
01:00:35.132 - 01:00:51.800, Speaker A: So I'm going to give some shout outs here. Storgan Manley, how do you transition well from serving segment a crypto customers who are wealthy towards a more mass market, larger audience, non crypto customers.
01:00:52.780 - 01:01:48.266, Speaker C: So the first thing I think is that make sure that the game is just fun to play. And if people have fun playing and I believe that's what they have, that's one of the things that I'm most proud of is that I have a lot of people telling me that they've not had that much fun since 2021 or even ever in crypto. And I think that's the key important thing. Then if people will have fun and they can see a way for them, even with a small amount, to win money and to make sure, okay, if I play well, if I have the skills and everything, even though arrive with like 50 bucks, then maybe I can make 100 or something like that. That's why the narrative that we want to maintain and like this meme coin thing about arriving with nothing and going back with everything at the end. So that's the two, the biggest one. And yeah, the question was maybe like how you transition right to a new sector of Twitter users.
01:01:48.298 - 01:01:48.794, Speaker A: Yes.
01:01:48.922 - 01:02:12.630, Speaker C: And so if we have those two parts, then we can like crypto people, even though they're like more degen and more like gamblers, like they're human in the end. So I'm pretty sure that if we nail a narrative that is like sustainable and fun to play and people can see themselves winning, then we can just open a new Twitter circle that is not crypto related and people will still enjoy playing.
01:02:13.330 - 01:02:15.910, Speaker A: Just had a question. Would you ever do your own roll up?
01:02:18.050 - 01:02:51.480, Speaker C: Like right now it doesn't make sense at all. Like being the flagship app of Blast, I think it's. It's something that really brings us a lot of value even for Blast. It's something that both of us will win a lot to have, but it's not impossible to think about that at some point. If we want to scale to YouTube to new stuff, it might make sense to have our own chain. But I think going about thinking about this, while you don't have the good product market fit, a good product and everything that is not everything that is set is just a waste of of time.
01:02:52.340 - 01:02:58.076, Speaker A: I like how you just think about product market fit. Everyone thinks about the other, which is get the roll up, get the higher fdv.
01:02:58.268 - 01:03:01.596, Speaker C: It's good for the tick end perverse.
01:03:01.628 - 01:03:21.300, Speaker A: Incentives in crypto, which is the other thing that's flat, like that's holding, you know, founders down. Next comment is from Jamon Bridging. What does Fantasy Tap look like? Post points Airdrop. How do you look at optimizing retention, engaging the current audience you built? Looking at Fronttech, their DAOs went down a lot.
01:03:22.400 - 01:03:23.336, Speaker B: That's a good question.
01:03:23.408 - 01:03:26.940, Speaker A: I've been thinking about daily active users is what I meant.
01:03:28.240 - 01:04:35.320, Speaker D: Like now it's, it's true like the. It's very helpful for us to have the gold that will continue and to be very tight with Blast and Pac man and then ultimately like post post ultra gold we we're confident that we can be having this game that as Cupid said is is fun in itself to play sustainable in the way the incentives are distributed. That we don't just rely on the inflation of cards but that we rely on people betting internally also in how they're seeing the stuff and having winners and losers in a more zero sum game environment. And also then thinking out about how we're going to use the fantasy token also to incentivize the way people can build things and utility around the cardholders and mapping out this ecosystem of incentive between the external builders that can use the fantasy card as a way of distributions but also then aligning those incentive well between all those players. So we're heavily thinking about this and then we'll see. But for now we're very glad to be so tight with Blast and Pac man in general.
01:04:35.620 - 01:04:43.940, Speaker A: Last question and you don't have to answer this if you don't want to. Sure. TSB3N when fan token question mark.
01:04:48.080 - 01:04:51.400, Speaker D: I mean I said the word token two times in my sentences.
01:04:51.480 - 01:05:14.560, Speaker C: Like, like people like the fan points. Like this is how we will do the stuff. Like we want to make sure that the only user that have like that have been there in fantasy will earn their share and will participate in the success of this. And, and we, yeah we really want. We're aiming for the big picture like the billion dollar company and it will take some time but we know that we have to act fast.
01:05:15.300 - 01:05:16.796, Speaker A: I think Travis told me or Travis.
01:05:16.828 - 01:05:23.724, Speaker C: Told me 10 billion of course like 10 million. 1 billion. Like let's go step by step.
01:05:23.812 - 01:05:27.580, Speaker A: He goes we're going to be 10 billion dollar company. I'm like all right, was he talking.
01:05:27.660 - 01:05:29.484, Speaker C: FDV or low float or like I.
01:05:29.492 - 01:05:31.084, Speaker A: Don'T know he just a ten billion dollar company.
01:05:31.172 - 01:05:32.420, Speaker B: Ten billion about.
01:05:35.840 - 01:05:36.392, Speaker D: Style.
01:05:36.456 - 01:05:44.696, Speaker C: Yeah. Anyway, like just aiming for the big picture think times and will have the incentive that makes the most sense for us and at the time that makes the most sense for us.
01:05:44.848 - 01:05:51.300, Speaker A: All right, any final comments, thoughts that you want listeners to. To learn about?
01:05:51.600 - 01:05:57.420, Speaker D: No, keep playing a fantasy and tell us like everything that you like and dislike and we'll keep listening.
01:05:58.170 - 01:06:01.070, Speaker A: All right, well thanks for taking a few minutes to chat with us.
01:06:01.370 - 01:06:02.162, Speaker D: Thanks a lot.
01:06:02.266 - 01:06:03.390, Speaker B: Who's who.
01:06:03.690 - 01:06:04.430, Speaker A: Ah.
01:06:06.170 - 01:06:06.738, Speaker B: What'S the.

01:06:15.658 - 01:06:16.274, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:06:16.402 - 01:06:25.076, Speaker A: And yeah, yeah and the way that I've now delineated is between the hairstyle. Right. One is comb one way. Yeah.
01:06:25.268 - 01:06:26.692, Speaker C: The other way, that's the easiest one.
01:06:26.716 - 01:06:27.540, Speaker A: But ciao has it.
01:06:27.580 - 01:06:28.692, Speaker B: My trick is the scar.
01:06:28.756 - 01:06:29.316, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:06:29.428 - 01:06:34.880, Speaker B: So keep. Mikado has the scar on the forehead and keep it as.
01:06:36.140 - 01:06:38.260, Speaker D: It's the two tricks that works. Yeah.
01:06:38.420 - 01:06:38.788, Speaker C: And.
01:06:38.844 - 01:06:40.788, Speaker A: But you probably did the hairstyle on purpose, right? Just.
01:06:40.844 - 01:06:46.340, Speaker C: No, it's actually like the way. Oh, that's one of the main difference that we have.
01:06:46.460 - 01:06:48.564, Speaker B: Oh, it's natural. Okay.
01:06:48.612 - 01:06:49.454, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah.
01:06:49.582 - 01:06:51.250, Speaker A: It's like perfect symmetry.
01:06:53.110 - 01:06:57.854, Speaker C: But I'm going to go with the contact lenses soon, so maybe it will be easier for people to.
01:06:57.942 - 01:06:58.574, Speaker D: To recognize.
01:06:58.622 - 01:06:59.650, Speaker C: To recognize.
