00:00:00.200 - 00:00:55.364, Speaker A: Mostly as a joke is like how long does it take for a new user to start using defi for instance, right? Like if you go on the street and ask a random person who is not crypto native and ask them to take whatever steps that they need to get started with defi, how long would it take? And the answer is fucking days because first you have to open a Coinbase account. You go through all the kyc, all that stuff, right? And then you take like four days to whatever or whatever to get approved. Then you wire money from your bank account to Coinbase. Then you learn how to send crypto from Coinbase to somewhere else. But when you do that you realize, holy shit, you don't have a metamask yet. So you go to chrome, you search for metamask, install it, then you send crypto assets from Coinbase to metamask and finally you're ready to use defi. Like this whole process is extremely painful.
