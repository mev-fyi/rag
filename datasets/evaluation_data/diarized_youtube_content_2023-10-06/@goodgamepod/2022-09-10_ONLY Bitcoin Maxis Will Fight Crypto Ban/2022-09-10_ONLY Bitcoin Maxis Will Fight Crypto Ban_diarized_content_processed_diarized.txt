00:00:00.120 - 00:00:46.774, Speaker A: I actually ran a thought experiment on Twitter a couple months ago. I've been thinking about this, and the tweet went something like this. If one day, ten years from now, maybe much harder than that, the US government decides that crypto is illegal, basically goes full executive order 6102, which they did a century ago.

And my followers answers were basically in line with what I had in mind, which is that the only community that will fight is bitcoin. No one else will do.
