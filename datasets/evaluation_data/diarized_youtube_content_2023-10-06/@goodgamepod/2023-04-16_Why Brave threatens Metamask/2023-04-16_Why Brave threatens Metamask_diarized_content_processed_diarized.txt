00:00:00.120 - 00:00:46.584, Speaker A: I redownloaded the brave browser, created a wallet through brave, and it automatically created a wallet for every chain it supports. So I have one for Solana, Ethereum, dogecoin, like, you name it, everything is all tied to my user identity on my brave wallet. And it took, you know, a minute. And if you think about what you just mentioned earlier, like, I have six or seven different extensions for six and seven different chains on a Chrome browser, the user UI UX experience is going to be very fragmented across all the chains, across Chrome strategy, across Google, et cetera. But now, if you have everything under one umbrella, the user experience could be ten x better. And I thought that was really cool. I mean, they had 20 million monthly active users that's using the browser today.
00:00:46.584 - 00:00:59.594, Speaker A: All of them have wallets that are enabled. And once you have this like control over the user because you're using them as a de facto browser, you could do a lot of cool things as well. And I think it could become the biggest threat to metamask.
