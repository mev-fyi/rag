00:00:00.280 - 00:00:29.718, Speaker A: Imagine you give out your genetic data to this one company called 23 andMe. The genetic data may not sound that important today, but I am sure that in 1020 years, this is going to be the single most important piece of information that anyone can know about you. I don't want a centralized company to own that important of a dataset about me. So what I want instead is I contribute data to this distributed ledger and I have the right to grant access to third party researchers, and nobody else can use that data.
00:00:29.846 - 00:00:57.590, Speaker B: And their work could culminate in more incentives. Right? I think, like, there isn't enough funding for researchers today, and so the types of datasets that are available is very limited. The amount of funding in health and clinical trials is very limited. The amount of R and D is limited. So you could completely reverse that by creating some sort of incentive that allows people to pay for this service. And more and more users are incentivized to building out interesting new concepts around the data they get from us.
00:00:57.662 - 00:00:58.294, Speaker A: That's exactly right.
