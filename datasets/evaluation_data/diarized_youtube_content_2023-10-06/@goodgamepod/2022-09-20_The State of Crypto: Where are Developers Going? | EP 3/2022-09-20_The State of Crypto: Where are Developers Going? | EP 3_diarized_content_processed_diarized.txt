00:00:00.200 - 00:00:23.745, Speaker A: At the end of the day, I feel like for most new developers that are new to Web3, they couldn't care less about loyalty towards the online ecosystem. At least maybe in 5 to 10 years. Choosing between Aptos, Sui Solana or Ethereum Cosmos is basically choosing from AWS or Google Cloud or Microsoft Azure, whatever works for them for funding, for attracting users.
00:00:23.865 - 00:01:15.043, Speaker B: Why is that? Welcome to Good Game, a podcast for crypto insiders with your host Imran Chow. Welcome back to our third episode of Good Game. As you know, the CPI just dropped and my heart dropped along with it. So Nasdaq's down what, two and a half, 3%? Crypto is down 10% plus everyone is scared again. We were hyper bullish a day ago because of the merge, but it sounds like it's the purge. Um, obviously you know, from our last conversation we talked about not to short ETH because it's already, you know, it's already at a point where it's very hard to short. So curious on your thoughts.
00:01:15.043 - 00:01:29.845, Speaker B: What changed? Obviously, you know, macro doesn't change much, but there are short term catalysts and, you know, euphoria. So curious to hear what you're thinking about ETH and the rest of the majors.
00:01:30.265 - 00:02:56.507, Speaker A: I mean, it's obvious that Ethan, BTC, they follow macro like macro is probably 60, 70% of what's accountable or what's responsible for price actions in crypto and nothing much has really changed since our last chat. On the macro side of things like one CPI print, it doesn't mean anything. We've known for a long time, at least I've believed personally for a long time, that inflation is very hard to tame. Like it's not one or two rate hikes that will fix it, right? Like going from going from 8% inflation down to where the Fed thinks the long term inflation should be, which is 2 to 3%, is very difficult. It'll take many, many changes in monetary policies, including rate hikes and potentially monetary tightening, quantitative tightening. And so I think the stock market has gotten a little bit euphoric over the past couple of months because they saw some improvement in the inflation. But the actuality is that I think we're going to see probably more pain sometime in Q4 because the Fed needs to raise rates even further.
00:02:56.507 - 00:03:44.503, Speaker A: Right? And basically the Fed has option. The Fed is in a difficult situation. If they don't raise rates, inflation is going to stay where it is today because it's very hard to attain. If they do raise rates, then it's going to slow down the growth and both situations, whatever the Fed does, both situations are really bad for risk markets, including the stock market. Like I said during our last episode, I thought that yes, we're probably towards the tail end of the bear market, but we're still probably two to three months away from this final viable bottom. So expect a capitulation event sometime in Q4.
00:03:44.679 - 00:04:33.193, Speaker B: Cool. It seems like I'm starting to see capitulation across the board anyways, which is very interesting. Retail. I haven't seen activity on retail as much as I would normally, at least on Twitter and sentiments around Twitter. So it seems like based on just Twitter, talking to others that used to be in crypto that aren't in crypto anymore, what startups that are shutting down? We've had many emails that have come in over the course of the past few months of startups that have shut down, VC funds that are shutting down. And so it seems like we're nearing the end of this capitulation cycle and that's going to be good news for founders that are still building in the space because we're almost near the end. The light is at the end of the tunnel.
00:04:33.193 - 00:05:31.745, Speaker B: Continue building. Switching gears here. You and I have been chatting a lot over the course of the past two weeks to figure out what we should be talking about next. And one interesting topic that kept coming up was kind of the state of layer ones and L2s and thinking through just what's happening in the space like breaking it down. You have Ethereum that's moving to Ethereum 2. Then you have, you know, roll ups that will help scale Ethereum and then you have the roll up wars between like Arbitrum, starkware with Stark Nat and Optimism and Polygon and then you have Solana War with Aptos and Sway, and then you have Cosmos and the Cosmos Hubs and there are some interesting dynamics that are being that are taking place there as well. So I think what makes sense for us is just to talk about it all.
00:05:31.745 - 00:05:40.797, Speaker B: Let's just unpack everything. And so let's start with Ethereum and I'll throw out some facts and then let's dive deep into what's happening.
00:05:40.861 - 00:06:46.295, Speaker A: By the way, I think before diving into that, I think we should maybe lay out a bit more context. The reason why this conversation is something that you're not going to hear anywhere else is because at alliance we have some very interesting data that is not public. We get about a thousand applications per quarter of founders wanting to join our community. And one of the questions on the application is which ecosystem Are you building on? Right. And so we have live data when it comes to developer momentum for each community. And for me, developer momentum, developer community is one of the few leading indicators of the health or even the price action of layer one, L2 assets in the coming months. So to give you an example, like around a year ago, a year and a half ago, we were the first to saw the rise of Solana.
00:06:46.295 - 00:07:04.459, Speaker A: Before its parabolic move from like $30 to 200, we saw how many high quality developers were coming into Solana from either the Ethereum community or even the Web2 big tech, for example. So this data is something that you're not going to hear about anywhere else.
00:07:04.627 - 00:07:23.677, Speaker B: Also, fun fact, Anatolian Raj used to host sessions within the alliance for our second cohort. So that was mid-2020 when no one really cared about building on Solana. So thought that was very interesting compared to the data that you brought up.
00:07:23.741 - 00:07:28.045, Speaker A: Yeah, cool, cool. Which asset or which ecosystem do you want to start with?
00:07:28.125 - 00:08:10.601, Speaker B: Let's start with Ethereum. Ethereum, obviously one of the first smart contract platforms that have launched. They have over 421,000 validators in its ecosystem. So it's decentralized and security strong. When you think about developers that are building on Ethereum and its ecosystem, there's some interesting facts. So net new, if you look at all of 21, there are about 18,000 new monthly active developers just generally in crypto that came into the space of that. And this is all quoting Electric Capital's developer research report.
00:08:10.753 - 00:08:13.223, Speaker A: And this is January 2022, correct?
00:08:13.317 - 00:08:55.915, Speaker B: That's right. So this is as of like nine months ago. So 18,000 completely new developers came into their crypto ecosystem, of which what are the five fastest growing developer ecosystems? Well, first one is Ethereum, second one's Polkadot, third is Cosmos, fourth is Solana, and the fifth is Bitcoin. I thought this was pretty interesting. Which is price is an indicator of developer growth. So as price goes up, more and more developers actually come into the ecosystem. Ethereum draws 25% of the devs out of that 18,000 net new developers that come into the crypto ecosystem and they have the best retention rate as well.
00:08:55.915 - 00:09:32.921, Speaker B: Solana 5x their total devs since launch, Polygon 2x total devs, Cosmos about 1x their developer ecosystem. And so if you think about their monthly active users or monthly active developers on each of those platforms, Ethereum is probably around 4,000 monthly active developers, Solana about a thousand, Cosmos 1000, everyone else less than 500. So that's kind of some of the interesting findings that I found through Electric Capital's developer research report.
00:09:33.073 - 00:09:48.409, Speaker A: So then the obvious question is what has changed since January 2022 until now? That's right, because the now data is not really out there, but we have sort of our own data sets.
00:09:48.497 - 00:09:50.025, Speaker B: Chao leak us the alpha.
00:09:50.145 - 00:10:16.821, Speaker A: I think it's very fair to say that Ethereum is still number one. By Ethereum I mean both the Ethereum minute as well as the L2s and the sidechain which is Polygon. So together I think the Ethereum community is close to around 50%. So that number is, to me it's a little bit higher than what was quoted in Electric Capital's report.
00:10:16.973 - 00:10:19.233, Speaker B: 50% of the applications.
00:10:19.349 - 00:10:41.959, Speaker A: 50% of our applications. That's right. Okay, Ethereum plus Polygon, especially Polygon is the most important L2 side chain. Right. Obviously Arbitrum and Optimism also have gained momentum, especially Arbitrum with the success of gmx. We can talk about GMX in a bit. It was also a very interesting story.
00:10:41.959 - 00:11:29.045, Speaker A: Okay, so within Ethereum, Polygon number one and then Arbitrum is very interesting. Both Arbitrum optimism are gaining momentum. Starquare, I'm curious how you thought about it because there's this instances of say DYDX moving from Starquare to Cosmos. But anyway, overall Ethereum I think it's around 50%. Solana is a close second. Solana is probably the biggest change since January 2022 and there's two parts to it. I think at the beginning of the year or the first half of the year, Solana at a certain point felt like it was going to surpass Ethereum when it comes to the number of super high quality devs building on Solana.
00:11:29.045 - 00:12:00.067, Speaker A: However, in the last two months, I think anecdotally I don't have a ton of large data sets around that, but anecdotally we've seen many Solana developers move from Solana to the Aptos in Sui ecosystems. And again, this data you're not going to see anywhere else because this is the data that we collect from talking to founders. So there's actually a couple founders in alliance community who used to build on Solana that moved to Aptos and Sui.
00:12:00.171 - 00:12:01.775, Speaker B: We'll have to talk about why soon.
00:12:02.075 - 00:12:31.289, Speaker A: We'll have to talk about that. So Solana number two, but somewhat losing momentum to their closest competitors, Aptos and Sui Cosmos is probably the biggest surprise for me in 2022. The interesting story or the interesting aspect of Cosmos is that they've never gotten the kind of Hype and the marketing and the PR that Solana has gotten or Ethereum has gotten or Polygon.
00:12:31.417 - 00:12:34.445, Speaker B: I think I know why, because we can talk about that too.
00:12:34.745 - 00:13:11.455, Speaker A: For me, this Cosmos thing is not very memeable. There's a bunch of chains built on Cosmos like Terra in the past and then Osmosis. All these specific chains are more memeable and they have a community around it. Whereas Cosmos itself, no one really thinks of themselves as part of the Cosmos community. They always think of themselves as a terror community or osmosis community and so on and so forth. So they've never gotten this hype in marketing. However, there's just a steady increase in the number of super high quality developers building on Cosmos.
00:13:11.455 - 00:13:39.395, Speaker A: And so I think Cosmos is probably right now number three. It is sort of pretty far behind Solana. But the momentum is very good for Cosmos and we can talk about why that is the case, like the fundamentals or the trade offs that Cosmos is making relative to Solana and Ethereum. So those are the sort of the high level developer community and momentum that we're seeing.
00:13:40.855 - 00:14:22.967, Speaker B: Got it. So let's just jump right into it. Let's talk a bit about the war between L2s and side chains within Ethereum and maybe we can start with just the basics. What is a roll up at the end of the day? Well, I consider roll ups just like a cluster of servers or nodes and essentially transactions are submitted to these nodes that are then batched and then anchored to Ethereum as call data. And they're great because they increase throughput finality, but it doesn't sacrifice security or decentralization. So ultimately you're leveraging Ethereum's security guarantees as a way to protect the chain and then protect the transactions that are being submitted to.
00:14:23.161 - 00:14:50.587, Speaker A: By the way, I think what you said there, there's a little bit of nuance about sacrificing decentralization because right now I think the major roll ups or optimistic roll ups are still using a centralized sequencer, although they do have a path towards decentralization. But that is something for new founders to think about is some of the issues with respect to centralization. But yeah, sorry, yeah, continue.
00:14:50.731 - 00:16:09.415, Speaker B: And yeah, so like Optimism and Arbitrum have centralized sequencers and centralized sequencers are ultimately, you could think of them as like a centralized server and it batches transactions, it orders and batches transactions together. And so, you know, people say, well why is that an issue? Well, centralized sequencers could be manipulated, it could be hacked and you could reorder transactions you can cancel transactions or edit the transactions, which could be really bad for those that are submitting new transactions on two layer Twos, but there is plans to decentralize that over time. But right now I think both Arbitrum and Optimism are focused on throughput and making sure transactions go through quickly for users. So let's talk about the war. So you have Arbitrum and Optimism that uses Optimistic roll ups. And why is it called Optimistic? Well, it's called Optimistic because Layer two, the, the, the chains assume all the chain transactions are valid and because of that they don't have to publish proof of validity or the correctness of the transaction. Whereas ZK rollups, they actually do the compute and will publish a proof of validity transaction as well.
00:16:09.415 - 00:16:56.335, Speaker B: And we'll talk a bit more about what that means. So you have Optimism and Arbitrum that are competing in the space. Optimism was launched by Jing and was primarily a project that was spun out from the Ethereum Foundation. And you have Arbitrum which is led by Steven and it was spun out of a research paper from his thesis. And so you have these two competing chains that are ultimately competing for Mindshare in the Ethereum ecosystem. And they are cycles of hype that kind of shows where people want to build. And today it seems like Arbitrum without incentives is winning the mind share of the developer ecosystem.
00:16:56.335 - 00:17:51.435, Speaker B: And the question is why? I have a few comments as to why. One is the way you're approaching the developer ecosystem is very important in the space, right? Having to be open and being able to be always accessible to developers. I think it's very important. And it turns out that Optimism, as great as they are as a team, weren't very receptive to the developers feedback support structures for them. And some people thought that they rolled out the incentives too early and even the rollout of the incentives wasn't done properly. In fact there was a malicious attack on some of the tokens that were locked by Optimism. The team that was then sent to a market maker and the market maker may have messed up and ultimately locked the tokens away and someone came in and essentially took it.
00:17:51.435 - 00:18:18.583, Speaker B: So that's the high level there. So you have Optimism then you have Arbitrum and Arbitrum, they haven't released any incentives yet and they're continuing using its product as a way to get net new users. And we talked about this in our second session, which is, you know, when you have product market fit, when people actually use the product for the product and not because of token incentives and it seems like a lot of developer mindshare is being attracted to Arbitrum.
00:18:18.639 - 00:18:45.357, Speaker A: The point you brought up there is super important. So let me summarize. When the tech is so close between two ecosystems, I think the key differentiator is business development. And by business development I mean doing things that don't scale to attract developers to build on top of their ecosystems. And by the way, Polygon is by far the number one. That's right out of all the ecosystems. But we can talk about it in a bit.
00:18:45.357 - 00:19:45.685, Speaker A: So anecdotally, when alliance has founders asking us which ecosystems, which layer ones or L2s to build on top of, and in particular when it comes to the decision between Arbitrum, optimism, even some of the other, like Polygon or whatever, ultimately the key thing that makes a developer want to choose Arbitrum is that the Arbitrum Biz dev team or customer service team is very responsive. Like they're more approachable. Like I think this is something that a lot of people don't appreciate. When you, when you're a developer new to the space, you want someone who can handle you closely. You want really good customer service. We have one founder who by the way picked like Flow. And the reason for that is because the Flow team is physically very close to them and meets them all the time.
00:19:45.685 - 00:20:00.405, Speaker A: Right. So this interpersonal, this human side of things is really, really important when the tech is that close between two competitors on the ecosystem. So what you brought up there is a really important point.
00:20:00.865 - 00:20:27.043, Speaker B: Yeah. And I think that goes for all layer ones and L2s. Right. Which is customer service ultimately will dictate the attraction of developers and retention of developers. And there are many layer ones that do a really good job of this, like Solana as an example. And so you have Arbitrum and Optimism that are kind of competing neck to neck. It is yet to know when Arbitrum will launch its token, but it's definitely going on a different path.
00:20:27.043 - 00:20:59.959, Speaker B: And I'll tell you about some of the newest strategies that Arbitrum is doing that optimism isn't. And so Arbitrum just launched Arbitrum Nova. And what is Arbitrum Nova? Arbitrum Nova is another roll up that's geared towards gaming and social fi and essentially higher throughput than Arbitrum 1, which is where all the defi activity is happening. And now it seems like Arbitrum is going towards a multi roll up strategy future. And there's some problems with that.
00:21:00.007 - 00:21:14.285, Speaker A: But yeah, fascinating because it reminds me of what I think Cosmos will be going in the long run is that I think on Ethereum the roll ups will specialize over time.
00:21:14.405 - 00:21:15.225, Speaker B: That's right.
00:21:15.605 - 00:21:24.893, Speaker A: Matter of fact, there could even be roll ups that are dedicated to a single application in the long run, which is the whole idea behind Cosmos.
00:21:25.029 - 00:21:25.757, Speaker B: Right.
00:21:25.941 - 00:21:35.439, Speaker A: So my mental model is that Ethereum roll ups in the long run will be actually competing more closely with Cosmos.
00:21:35.607 - 00:21:37.303, Speaker B: And the hubs, specifically.
00:21:37.399 - 00:21:40.167, Speaker A: And the hubs, yeah. For specialization.
00:21:40.351 - 00:22:22.527, Speaker B: Here's the thing with roll ups. The problem that I see is that they're all competing for the same block space again. Right. So if you think block space is elastic, similar to compute, then you know that supply will dwindle as more and more applications are being built on it. So how do you think about that? Because let's just look at optimism or Arbitrum. You have Arbitrum that, let's say you have 200 applications are being built on Arbitrum. All of a sudden you see congestion fees rise, transaction fees rise, and then it takes longer for transactions to get settled.
00:22:22.527 - 00:22:38.839, Speaker B: And that is an issue with UIUX today. Right. On building on Ethereum. So I feel like what we're doing is we're becoming specialized, but people are still building on these chains and I think over time they're going to run into the same issue and they're going.
00:22:38.847 - 00:22:40.835, Speaker A: To get pushed to specialization.
00:22:41.535 - 00:22:42.395, Speaker B: That's right.
00:22:42.775 - 00:22:47.311, Speaker A: Either a dedicated roll up or a Cosmos zone.
00:22:47.423 - 00:22:50.039, Speaker B: Why don't they do it now instead of just building on.
00:22:50.127 - 00:23:01.311, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a very good question. And practically speaking, it takes a lot of resources to recruit validators for your Cosmos zone. Right?
00:23:01.503 - 00:23:50.903, Speaker B: It does, but to counter that, and maybe we can leave it for Cosmos. But I'll give you a quick example. DYDX was on starkware left to build on Cosmos. What's interesting is that with Cosmos you could edit the state. So what does that mean? Well, I could customize fees in any way and shape and form so that DYDX could ultimately accrue value on all aspects of the chain. So an example of this is if I was to pay gas fees on the DYDX chain, I could pay in a DYDX tokens, or I could pay on any token, it doesn't matter. Validators could get paid fees, trading fees, instead of just accepting and transmitting the transactions.
00:23:50.903 - 00:24:23.815, Speaker B: I could get paid as a validator on transaction fees as well. So there's some, a lot of cool things. There's a lot of interesting things you could do on Cosmos, which we'll talk in a bit. But going back to Arbitrum and optimism. I agree. Specialization for roll ups will become more important and I think with Arbitrum going multi roll up already, you could start to see that they're going to separate by sectors. And then I think over time there will be hyper specialization where you'll start to see dedicated roll ups for each of these applications.
00:24:23.815 - 00:24:50.765, Speaker B: But here's another problem that I'd like to get your thoughts on is okay, so you have Arbitrum, you're building on Arbitrum and then you have arbitrum nova, arbitrum 1. And what if you want to get composability between the two optimistic chains? How do you think about that? Right. Well right now Arbitrum has its own bridge that bridges between different roll ups.
00:24:52.185 - 00:24:53.521, Speaker A: Have you tried those?
00:24:53.713 - 00:25:08.745, Speaker B: I have not. But I should. But I didn't. But now you have your further fragmenting the liquidity and the user experience for the benefit of throughput and finality. What are your thoughts on that?
00:25:09.245 - 00:25:26.093, Speaker A: For me, composability is two things. One is atomic composability, which is something that people generally think of how people generally think of composability, which is how you can atomically compose two transactions in one block.
00:25:26.229 - 00:25:26.789, Speaker B: Right.
00:25:26.917 - 00:26:25.495, Speaker A: So for an example of that would be you as a user putting some funds into a uniswap pool and take out the LP token and then put it in yarn to generate some yield or something along those lines. Right. So that's atomic composability. And the other type of composability for me is simply that when you play a game, you earn some tokens, you earn some NFTs or whatever and then you sell it, you trade it on a decentralized exchange on the same chain. Right. Rather than having to bridge it to somewhere else. So both these types of composability are important to me and my personal experience with roll ups is that, well, number one, you cannot do atomic composability between different roll ups, at least not yet.
00:26:25.495 - 00:26:44.315, Speaker A: Right. And two withdrawing tokens from one roll up down to the ethereum minute and then transfer it somewhere else for trading is very, very difficult. For optimistic roll up, the withdrawal time I think is like seven days, which is very painful.
00:26:44.435 - 00:26:52.875, Speaker B: Well, you can use like bridges like hop protocol that will do it in five to 10 minutes. So there are some bridges, but then there's security issues with that. Right?
00:26:52.995 - 00:27:06.595, Speaker A: Exactly. You're trading trustlessness for speed by introducing sort of a semi centralized actor in between. So there's trade offs on those front.
00:27:06.755 - 00:27:58.447, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean there's going to be personal risk management when it comes to using bridges and hopping in from one roll up to the other. And so I do think the roll up sector will need to really think about how this is all going to play out at the end of the day. So that's what we're seeing. On the optimistic roll up side then you have Polygon, which is a side chain, and side chains ultimately are a series of blockchains. It's a blockchain that has its own security guarantees, consensus algorithm and its own validators, the whole nine yards. So they have about 100 validators. So it's pretty, it's okay in terms of decentralization.
00:27:58.447 - 00:28:35.759, Speaker B: Probably the most active on the BD side. So yesterday Polygon announced a partnership with Starbucks. A couple weeks ago they announced a partnership with Stripe and Shopify and all of these large brands. And it seems like even if you look through our alliance applications, a large subset of the applications come from Polygon. And although it's not an optimistic roll up, it's a side chain. Polygon has used its war chest in a way that's very supportive of the developer ecosystem. Right.
00:28:35.759 - 00:29:03.263, Speaker B: So they've announced their own, like zkevm, they have their own suite of products that will ultimately answer to the developer needs. And I can talk a bit about that. But overall Polygon is probably in the roll up or in the layer 2 sidechain space. Polygon probably has the most support from the developer ecosystem and Mindshare.
00:29:03.399 - 00:29:28.373, Speaker A: Polygon is probably the most interesting case study in the, in the competitive landscape of Layer one, Layer twos, because in my mind, when Polygon first started, arguably they had close to being the worst technology compared to their competitors. And yet they have one of the greatest developer mindshares.
00:29:28.469 - 00:29:29.265, Speaker B: That's right.
00:29:29.605 - 00:30:04.169, Speaker A: The way I think about this is when Polygon first started, they were the first to be in the market in the Ethereum ecosystem when the roll ups were not ready yet. And they solved a specific pain point that Ethereum developers experienced at that point in time one to two years ago, which is the fact that Ethereum was highly congested and they were there at the right time and they solved that problem even with a somewhat shady tech red.
00:30:04.337 - 00:30:43.287, Speaker B: But you know what's interesting at that time, if you remember, there were many competitors that were building sidechains and plasma chains. Omico was building it. If you remember Omico, they were building it. There was Casper, then it turned out to be its own thing. There were a couple of others, but ultimately they all failed. And they failed because product Market fit or lack of focus on the developer side. And I felt like from then on till now Polygon has been heads down building which is something that's hard to find in crypto.
00:30:43.471 - 00:31:07.197, Speaker A: Yeah. And in fact they acquired a couple of zero logic proof technologies over the last year or so. Right. And it seems to me that they have a viable path towards building a really scalable L2 and moving or slowly migrating from the sidechain into that vision into the roll up vision.
00:31:07.301 - 00:32:26.975, Speaker B: That's right. So Polygon ZKVM is in development. What they have now is Polygon Edge and Polygon Nightfall which is coming out soon. So I'd say of all the roll ups and sidechains Polygon probably has the most mind share optimism, Arbitrum close second, third and then we have the fourth which is starkware. And what is starkware? Well, starkware uses zero knowledge proves as a way to scale and the way you want to think about starkware team, they're probably one of the most technical teams in crypto and their first product, which is essentially their closed development platform was used by dydx before they moved to Cosmos. And the way you want to think about this arrangement so far, don't quote me on this word for word, but it's a closed development platform and it licenses its tech to dydx as an example and there's licensing fees behind it, which is operated like a traditional software vendor. I mean I've used Darkware and it's great, right? I mean it's fast, easy, never had any issues.
00:32:26.975 - 00:33:01.867, Speaker B: But they recently made dydx recently made the move to Cosmos which we'll talk a bit about. And then starknet which is starkware's version of their ZK roll ups that's completely open and decentralized and that's starting to hit the market and we're starting to see developers, a lot of gaming developers migrate to that rollup and to Star Ware ecosystem in terms of where they are in terms of developer use. Case I haven't seen like I've looked for numbers, there aren't much out there yet because I think they're still in the growing phase of the market.
00:33:01.971 - 00:33:24.781, Speaker A: We've seen a couple founders from Starquare. Yep, I think Star Starquare in that world in general today they're still building core infra in defi. Yeah, they're not really or at least they don't have that big of a mind share in the application layer yet. Like consumer products, et cetera.
00:33:24.933 - 00:34:23.324, Speaker B: There's a couple of reasons why why don't we first talk about what are ZK roll ups? Right, sure. They're essentially sort of like optimistic roll ups where they bundle transactions, but computation happens off chain. What it does is it checks for the correctness of the transaction before they produce a validity proof which then gets anchored onto, anchored as a call data onto Ethereum. But the cool thing about when the call data gets anchored to Ethereum is that ZK rollups use compression techniques. And because of this compression technique, the call data is much more minimized in terms of storage on Ethereum versus optimistic roll ups. And so in the long run, ZK roll ups are much better for the Ethereum state versus optimistic roll ups. So that's just a high level on ZK roll ups.
00:34:23.324 - 00:34:50.116, Speaker B: Now, thinking about starkware and starknet, what I think is what I think one of the uphill battles for starkware starknet is Cairo, which is its development developmental language that you use to program on on starkware. And so a lot of people have to learn Cairo, this new language to develop on on starkware and starknet.
00:34:50.260 - 00:35:00.364, Speaker A: But, but the counter, the counterpoint. Okay, so. So this new having to learn new language thing is something I've seen both arguments for and against it.
00:35:00.444 - 00:35:01.156, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:35:01.300 - 00:35:40.235, Speaker A: Right. So in the case of Algorand, we've heard from our founders that, or we've heard from people in the Algorand ecosystem that the reason why they think they haven't gotten much mind share is because of people having to learn their own language. But at the same time, in the case of Aptos and Sui, we know people who are extremely excited about learning Move. Right. So the very fact of having to learn a new language by itself, I feel like it's not necessarily an impediment. It depends on the specific of the language itself. We can talk about movie in a bit.
00:35:40.235 - 00:35:50.075, Speaker A: But my point is there's both arguments for and against having to learn a new language as being an obstacle.
00:35:50.615 - 00:36:10.187, Speaker B: I also think Move is similar to Rust. Right. So I think those that are big Rust fans will gravitate towards Move. And so I think that's also a part of it. But I agree, generally, like languages could be both good and bad, just depending on what you're building and the tech that you bring.
00:36:10.291 - 00:36:23.695, Speaker A: But the most interesting case study of starkware is dydx. Yeah. Why did DYDX move away and into Cosmos? What are your thoughts on that?
00:36:23.815 - 00:37:04.585, Speaker B: Yeah, so many reasons. One is, you know, at that time dydx was building on a centralized platform, which is a huge risk for dydx. As a company, from a regulatory perspective, I'd say that's number one. Number two is licensing fees. No one really wants to pay for licensing fees. I just think that's just overhead that could be captured by the app itself. And I'd say three is once you own, like if you own the entire stack end to end, naturally there are fees that could be additional fees that could be accrued by dydx as an app.
00:37:04.585 - 00:38:07.745, Speaker B: And then finally, I'd say is decentralization, right? So by building on Cosmos Hub, dydx can focus on its own security and can slowly roll out how decentralized they want to be and how secure they want to be over a fixed period of time. I think those are some of the reasons why they made the move. But if you look at dydx, like, if you read through the white paper of how the implementation would look like on Cosmos, it's pretty interesting. An example of this is I had mentioned earlier that on Cosmos, you could edit the state, right? So you can change the fee parameters, you can change how people can do transaction ordering. You can even update the MEM pools, right? Which is very good for dydx, because if they're worried about front running and all the other shit that's happening on other chains, DYDX has more control over it. And so I think that's like number one.
00:38:07.785 - 00:38:52.947, Speaker A: By the way, this is one of the, at least anecdotally from founders choosing Cosmos, this is one of the key value props of Cosmos compared to the monolithic chains like Ethereum and Solana, is that you have sovereignty over what you want to do, and you have a high level of customizability. You can customize the chain if you own it in a way that suits your purpose. So, for instance, I learned recently that on Serum, it takes three transactions to settle a market order. Okay, three blocks. That's a lot of latency for market makers. Market makers prefer a very low latency.
00:38:53.051 - 00:38:53.515, Speaker B: Yep.
00:38:53.595 - 00:39:39.085, Speaker A: Right. Or else they get picked off. You know, they prefer latency as close as possible to centralized exchanges, which is on the order of milliseconds, sometimes even microseconds in traditional finance. So Serum's inability to settle a market order within one transaction and it takes three, is actually a artifact of how Solana is designed. I won't get into the technical details, but the Solana chain is not designed for settling quickly. Whereas if you build a matching engine or decentralized exchange on Cosmos, you can customize it. You can customize the chain in a way that you can indeed Settle everything in one transaction.
00:39:39.205 - 00:39:56.871, Speaker B: There's some interesting. I keep talking about fees being accrued. Well, if you're building directly on Ethereum, Ethereum captures the fees. Right, and what does that also mean? Well, you're competing with others for block space. 2, 3 is the merge as an example. Everyone gets affected by the merge.
00:39:57.023 - 00:39:57.695, Speaker A: That's right.
00:39:57.815 - 00:40:29.389, Speaker B: With dydx go to Cosmos, they could worry about all of that in house. So they never have to update their validator set. They don't. You know, the UI UX experience will always be seamless. And this brings me back to a quote that I remember Jeff Bezos said back in 94 when someone asked him, like, why are you going to open up warehouses to compete with Walmart? He goes, it's all about the customer. Like I want, I want the customer to have the best experience in the world and that's all I care about. And everybody was shocked at that time.
00:40:29.389 - 00:40:42.305, Speaker B: Right, but it's similar to what's happening now. Right. I want like the user should have the best experience and the protocol or the app should worry about all the back end stuff. And I think this is true to what DYDX is doing.
00:40:42.785 - 00:40:43.657, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:40:43.841 - 00:41:43.305, Speaker B: What does this mean? Well, what it means is now dydx can capture all the fees that accrues to dydx and what they're doing is they're charging transaction fees and now they can use that transaction fees to pay validators, which is very cool. And so you can get very interesting dynamics because of that. There's some other cool things that you could do. An example is Osmosis has something called threshold encryption. What does that mean? Well, it could encrypt bad transactions that would likely be MEV'd, right? Or like, you know, things like sandwich attacks and they allow good transactions to be MEV'd away or arbed away. So you can have customization of transactions, which is interesting. And you know, there's other things like finality and then transactions being deterministic versus monolithic chains, which is really dependent on what's happening on the block space.
00:41:44.045 - 00:41:50.705, Speaker A: I feel like we've pretty much covered Cosmos by covering the Ethereum L2s.
00:41:51.525 - 00:42:31.209, Speaker B: That's true, that's true. Because it's very similar in nature. Now we have Solana and Solana versus Sway and Aptos. Um, this is like becoming a very trending topic these days. Solana, I guess introduced C level about a year and a half ago. What is sea level? Which it's essentially the ability to execute transactions in parallel versus how Ethereum does it today, which is like single threaded. And so what does that mean? Well, if I'm submitting a transaction on Ethereum, Ethereum would mine transactions one by one.
00:42:31.209 - 00:42:54.527, Speaker B: So it's kind of like typical ordering system and is batched into an order and it'll execute transactions one by one. Whereas with C level and I guess similarly with Soy and Aptos, it will execute transactions in parallel. So as long as they're not dependent, more or less. And we'll talk more about what that means.
00:42:54.631 - 00:43:09.875, Speaker A: A big misconception that people have towards aptos and Sui is the parallelization. They think that aptos and Sui are the ones that pioneered, but it's actually Solana. Like parallelization has been done already for a long time on Solana.
00:43:10.255 - 00:43:16.327, Speaker B: So why was it a big deal then? It's all about the narrative.
00:43:16.471 - 00:44:05.015, Speaker A: It's all about the narrative. And in fact, if you talk to developers who are building on aptos and Sui, the thing that attracts them is not. Parallelization is the move language. Right. So interestingly, I think we mentioned this before, but I think I want to say maybe 70%, 70 to 80% of developers on Aptos and SUI come from Solana. And I've been thinking about the reasons behind it for a while. I think the most obvious reason is just that Move conceptually and syntactically are more similar to Solana Rust than to Solidity.
00:44:05.015 - 00:44:40.229, Speaker A: Both enable parallelization, both are statically typed and syntactically like, I think they all come from the C C family. Interestingly, I've had one founder tell me that. Oh, actually maybe some background first. So the aptos move is the original move from Facebook. Right. Whereas the Sui move is modified move. And one founder told me that the app for Sui is.
00:44:40.229 - 00:45:01.753, Speaker A: Is actually more similar to Solana Move. Sorry, Solana Rust in many ways than it is to Sui and fundamentally. So one interesting similarity is in both Solana. Oh, sorry, no, I take it back. SUI is more similar to Solana than it is to aptos.
00:45:01.889 - 00:45:02.685, Speaker B: That's right.
00:45:03.105 - 00:45:45.491, Speaker A: And one interesting similarity is in both Solana and Sui, the developer has to declare their own dependencies. So in this philosophy, the responsibility of identifying parallel transactions is put on the developers. Okay. Whereas in Aptos, the responsibility of identifying parallelizable transactions is put on the shoulders of the virtual machine and it's done at runtime. And it's something what they call the block stm and that's something that came out of Facebook. Sui doesn't use block stm. Sui's philosophy is philosophically, is a Little bit more similar to Solana.
00:45:45.491 - 00:46:27.845, Speaker A: And so as a result I have founders tell me that the aptos Move, the original Move, is easier to work with than Sui Move and Solana Rust. So aptos Move is a higher level language and I can relate to it because 10 years ago I wrote a lot of C and it was so painful for me. C and C are some of the most painful languages. And at some point I moved from C to Java and my entire world changed. Like Java, whatever you do, it just works, it just compiles. You don't run into like bullshit issues like segmentation fault, like you don't have to manage your own memory and all that stuff. So Java is a higher level language than C.
00:46:27.845 - 00:46:49.453, Speaker A: There's trade offs of course, because C is faster, Java is easier to work with. So developer experience is on. Aptos Move reminds me of Java, whereas Sui and Solana are more analogous to C. But anyway, so that's something I learned anecdotally. Very interesting stuff.
00:46:49.549 - 00:47:35.129, Speaker B: Yeah, it's very interesting. So it seems like aptos is much more developer friendly than Sway, primarily because Block stm, which stands for Software Transaction Memory, it essentially allows you to pre order and divide transactions optimistically and then we'll validate it and then check for any dependencies and then invalidate the transaction if there's dependencies caught. Right. So essentially Block STM does all the ordering and then checks for dependencies and then will optimistically validate the transactions. Whereas with Sway, Sway will give the use the developer more control to call out transactions whether they're dependent or not, which requires more work on the front end for developers. Right?
00:47:35.217 - 00:47:35.925, Speaker A: Yep.
00:47:36.305 - 00:47:55.763, Speaker B: So there's very interesting dynamics there. You have one that does it for the developer and then you have Sway that gives the more power to the developer to call out the transactions. What do you think about the two and which one do you think? Obviously it seems like you're more. You like what aptos and Block STM is doing?
00:47:55.899 - 00:48:22.705, Speaker A: No, I think both have their merits. Like neither is strictly better than the other. Right. It's very hard to say at the end of the day, but providing a good developer experience is critical for success. And anecdotally I heard from Solana founders that both the aptos and Sui developer tooling surprisingly is better than Solana.
00:48:23.885 - 00:48:24.997, Speaker B: Get out of here.
00:48:25.181 - 00:48:39.701, Speaker A: Because Solana has been around for like two, three years now, whereas aptos and Sui are much newer. Well, I mean obviously they've done many years of work at Facebook, but surprisingly the dev tooling is better on Aptos and sui.
00:48:39.893 - 00:48:44.015, Speaker B: Well, Solana just announced that they're going to be supporting move.
00:48:44.715 - 00:48:45.091, Speaker A: Yep.
00:48:45.123 - 00:48:45.987, Speaker B: Did you see that?
00:48:46.131 - 00:48:46.915, Speaker A: Yep.
00:48:47.075 - 00:49:13.495, Speaker B: I think it's about a year away, less than a year away. And so I guess there's this huge battle between Solana, Aptos and Sway. We have some of the developers moving away from Solana to Sway and Aptos primarily. I think it's just transaction throughput. Right. So like the bottlenecks and the chain being halted is an issue for some developers. And so they're seeing some of these people move.
00:49:13.495 - 00:49:25.319, Speaker B: Do you think with Solana moving to Move or supporting Move, do you think that they'll still have the competitive edge? Like where do you see this all play out?
00:49:25.407 - 00:50:11.715, Speaker A: You know, at the end of the day, I want to touch on a point that I brought up at the beginning of this, this session, which is that we as analysts or whatever you want to call it, can spend all day researching the theoretical aspects, merits trade offs of each chain. But at the end of the day, the only thing that matters in the early stage is developer adoption. It's the momentum. Right. Aptos and Sui are clearly gaining momentum right now at the expense of Solana. And I think that Solana people are aware of it. I think Anatoly sees a lot of good things in Aptos and Sui and also thinks of them as direct competitors to Solana.
00:50:11.715 - 00:50:22.551, Speaker A: And by the way, anecdotally there's a few big Solana investors that are pushing their portfolio companies to switch from Solana to Aptos and Sui.
00:50:22.663 - 00:50:36.485, Speaker B: How do you feel about that? I mean, there's just a lot of FUD around Solana it seems like. And there's this concept of mercenary and missionary founders that you and I always talk about. Yeah, so let's talk about, let's unpack that.
00:50:36.645 - 00:50:54.315, Speaker A: The thing that is unclear to me is how missionary the developers on Aptos and SUI are because a lot of them come from Solana, some of them come from Ethereum and some of them are new. But a lot of them, I think the majority of them come from Solana.
00:50:54.445 - 00:51:35.113, Speaker B: Do you think that's a good thing or bad thing? I mean, for me, as an example, I want to attract net new developers. Obviously we'll get some developers from all the other ecosystems and that's fine. But to me, having organic pull from net new developers is a great signal. Just vampire attacking or attacking or attracting other layer 1 developers from one specific ecosystem may not be the best strategy because what you're doing is you're attracting mercenary founders versus missionary founders. So curious to hear your thoughts on that.
00:51:35.289 - 00:52:12.083, Speaker A: The developer loyalty level of loyalty is certainly a big problem for new chains in general. It's not specific to aptos or Sui or anything, but at the end of the day I feel like for most new developers that are new to Web3, they couldn't care less about loyalty towards the online ecosystem at least maybe in 5 to 10 years. Choosing between Aptos, Suislana or Ethereum Cosmos is basically choosing from AWS or Google Cloud or Microsoft Azure, whatever works for them for attracting funding, for attracting users.
00:52:12.259 - 00:52:24.253, Speaker B: Why is that? It's interesting because most of the developers that are, I would say most, but I'd say there's a huge subset of developers that are on Ethereum and they'll never go to another chain.
00:52:24.429 - 00:52:37.105, Speaker A: I think that's right, but I think the number one reason is actually solidity is very different from move, whereas it's much easier for Solana Dev to move to Apposent and sui.
00:52:37.685 - 00:52:39.853, Speaker B: Huh. So there's like switching costs, right?
00:52:39.949 - 00:52:41.185, Speaker A: Switching costs, yeah.
00:52:41.855 - 00:53:42.293, Speaker B: I also think it's because back in 2015, 2014, well, when Ethereum launched, let's say 2016, more or less back then people used to shit on smart contracts, especially the Bitcoin community. And I felt like the Ethereum community had to harden, right, and become this very strong cult or community that will fight back against everyone that didn't believe in a smart contract world. And I think that DNA is still here today and DNA will continue to thrive. And for me I think that's like a Lindy long term competitive edge for Ethereum is that you have these developers that are staking their reputation and their livelihood on Ethereum because they believe in its ethos. And that's something that you can never take away from Ethereum, ever.
00:53:42.469 - 00:54:23.911, Speaker A: Actually I agree with you. My perception is that Ethereum devs are on average more loyal to Ethereum than devs from other communities are loyal to their ecosystem. And there might be a couple of reasons for that. One is simply because Ethereum is not a VC chain. Everyone who joined Ethereum already benefited from the rising price of Ethereum and if they benefit from Ethereum they're going to be loyal to it. And two is what you talk about the fight against Bitcoin. I think that's also very important.
00:54:23.911 - 00:54:53.861, Speaker A: Ethereum has this ethos across several dimensions, but one of the dimensions which I find interesting is the commitment towards decentralization which I want to talk about in a bit. But Ethereum post merge is going to face some potential threats when it comes to censorship. And they've been talking about UA SF User activated soft fork, which is something that only happened on Bitcoin.
00:54:53.953 - 00:54:54.333, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:54:54.389 - 00:55:20.567, Speaker A: So today, imagine if OFAC wants to censor some other chain. Right. Or if OFAC wants to censor every blockchain. Which one of these communities will actually fight and slash the censors via social consensus. And the censors meaning potentially a big staker like Coinbase. I'm not saying Coinbase will do it, but just for argument's sake, Right. And I think Ethereum is going to do it.
00:55:20.567 - 00:55:52.335, Speaker A: Ethereum has this ethos towards decentralization, and Ethereum Community believes in it, despite actually having, by the way, so, Nakamoto. I want to talk a little bit about Nakamoto Coefficient, which is the number of colluding entities it takes to censor transaction. Solana, surprisingly, has a very high Nakamoto coefficient, which means, at least on that dimension alone, they're very decentralized. And Solana actually has a higher Nakamoto coefficient than Ethereum.
00:55:53.195 - 00:55:53.595, Speaker B: Whoa.
00:55:53.635 - 00:56:20.317, Speaker A: Which is a huge narrative violation. Okay. So Ethereum is, when it comes to Nakamoto Coefficient, is more centralized than Solana. However, decentralization is more than this. One dimension alone, for me, ultimately, is social consensus. Is this commitment towards decentralization. And I think Ethereum Community is very committed to it.
00:56:20.501 - 00:56:35.545, Speaker B: That just brings up so much issues. Right. All right, so let's say we live in this world where transactions are being censored. That's what we're talking about here. Would this just become a regulated chain?
00:56:36.245 - 00:56:49.935, Speaker A: It's yet to be seen. But at least. At least the Ethereum people said publicly that they're going to fight it again. You know, obviously, words don't always lead to action, but at least they're saying it.
00:56:51.835 - 00:57:36.539, Speaker B: Which is interesting because Brian Armstrong from Coinbase talked about if they ever get any requests to censor transactions, they're just going to pull their entire validator business, which is in the billions. Right. It isn't something that it's easy to do, obviously. And I think Brian Armstrong was the only one that came out against this, which is great for the ecosystem, but that is something to worry about. I do worry about that. And so I think it really depends on all the validators that have control of the network. And which way are they going to sway? If I would have to guess, it's either people will comply or people will rage.
00:57:36.539 - 00:57:40.775, Speaker B: Quit is the way I see it. There's no other way.
00:57:41.395 - 00:57:41.883, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:57:41.939 - 00:57:57.825, Speaker B: And what does that mean? Well, if they rage quit, the ones that comply will continue to earn fees, take more of the share and continue to comply. Which means that it could be regulated. But it's hard to say and I don't want to assume anything.
00:57:58.165 - 00:58:26.353, Speaker A: We're going off topic a little bit. But the point being Ethereum has this commitment to decentralization that attracts developers that actually believe in it. And so the level of loyalty. For me, Ethereum has the most missionary community of developers. And that's right. A close second is actually Cosmos, which by the way brings back to an earlier point that I brought up, which is that Cosmos so far has done no marketing, no pr. The entire community is organic.
00:58:26.353 - 00:58:32.129, Speaker A: Like, I'm very confident that Cosmos developers are in it for the tech. Right.
00:58:32.217 - 00:58:44.937, Speaker B: Yeah, you bring up a very interesting point, which is, you know, Cosmos had no hype over the course of, I mean the idea came around 2014, they've been around for a very long time.
00:58:45.081 - 00:58:46.393, Speaker A: As long as Ethereum.
00:58:46.529 - 00:59:01.459, Speaker B: That's right. And I think primarily it's because they chose to decentralize earlier. And so there isn't like, I mean, there's some sort of labs team that pushes the ecosystem, but they're not very vocal or public. Right.
00:59:01.547 - 00:59:17.335, Speaker A: Sometimes I feel like Cosmos is too decentralized for its own good, which makes it harder to move things in a coordinated way. Right. When it comes to marketing, when it comes to biz dev, that kind of stuff.
00:59:17.875 - 00:59:23.715, Speaker B: But I guess they benefit because they're attracting organic developers that are in it for the tech.
00:59:23.875 - 00:59:24.539, Speaker A: Yep.
00:59:24.667 - 01:00:43.287, Speaker B: When you think about, you know, what do, you know, engineers do on their night weekends will predict what they'll do in the future. It's similar to that ethos like the night weekend cult that will build some really cool shit on Cosmos or whatnot. So I feel like it definitely resembles that type of vibe. And we're starting to see a lot of founders being attracted to Cosmos just generally because of the launch of Osmosis, which is essentially an AMM chain or hub on Cosmos. And so they have most of the mind share of liquidity and users currently. And because of that, and I'm just going to go slightly off topic here, but because of that they're able to now bring other products or projects onto its ecosystem and create atomic or synchronous composability within the hub, which is an interesting value proposition and I don't think we touched on this and I guess we'll touch on it quickly, is the whole app chain thesis, which is ultimately apps should own the entire backend infrastructure, including the front end and Essentially, apps are the single point of entry for users and they don't have to worry about anything else.
01:00:43.431 - 01:00:44.287, Speaker A: Yep.
01:00:44.471 - 01:00:45.727, Speaker B: What are your thoughts on that?
01:00:45.831 - 01:01:43.115, Speaker A: I mean, again, it's very clear that there's more and more people building their own app chains, especially the fairly mature projects. Right? Including dydx. I think even Robert Leshner, I think Compound first considered Polkadot and then I think Leshner said something on Twitter recently that they think that DYDX made the right decision to move to Cosmos. But anyway, point being, Compound is going app chain as well to have sovereignty. What else? Axie, right, has launched their own chain. Basically a lot of these. The commonality between all these projects is that they're fairly mature products, they have a brand, and more importantly, they have the resources to launch their own chain.
01:01:43.115 - 01:02:30.119, Speaker A: Because launching your own chain on Cosmos, no matter how easy Cosmos SDK makes it easy for you to launch the chain on Cosmos, it still requires recruiting validators. Integration with Block Explorers, integration with Oracles, rpc, all these things are extremely difficult. And that is the fundamental trade off the app chain is making relative to Ethereum and Solana, which is fast prototyping. Right. You can't launch something very quickly on Cosmos, which is why Cosmos is primarily suitable for fairly mature projects or projects with a lot of money.
01:02:30.287 - 01:02:56.719, Speaker B: So I guess it really doesn't matter where you launch. I mean, yes and no. Right. So it could, you could state that, you know, if you don't want to worry about recruiting your own validators and you figure out your own security, you just use an optimistic roll up or Ethereum as a way to launch. And then once you have Mindshare users, then you could think about owning more of the stack by migrating to Cosmos or other chains, right?
01:02:56.807 - 01:03:32.865, Speaker A: That's right. And by the way, this is something that just crossed my mind lately is that there is a real chance that monolithic chains are just test nets for Cosmos. Have you thought about it? Basically you can use monolithic chains to prototype quickly, build a brand, attract an initial funnel of users and then eventually just move to Cosmos. What if every project wants to do that? Then those chains are just testnets for Cosmos. They could do that. There's a real possibility for this.
01:03:33.025 - 01:04:10.219, Speaker B: I guess that was the basic concept for Polkadot, right? Was the Kusama network. You use this like Testnet chain as a way to build traction. You don't really have to worry about recruiting investors to auction Polkadot for your chain and guarantee the parachain itself. You use Kosama. Once you get product market fit and Traction. Then you go out to the Polkadot main chain and then recruit Polkadot investors to auction their polka dots to the chain itself. That is sort of the concept, but I think the cost for security on Polkadot is very expensive.
01:04:10.219 - 01:04:10.627, Speaker B: Right.
01:04:10.691 - 01:04:37.123, Speaker A: To summarize, the app chain thesis, you're basically sacrificing composability for fast prototyping, for sovereignty, for customizability and value capture. And I want to dig a little bit deeper into this sacrificing composability part because I know you had some experience with bridging in Cosmos. What did you do and how was that experience?
01:04:37.259 - 01:05:12.135, Speaker B: Yeah, so I was bridging to Kanto, which is a layer one DeFi hub, so they have their own AMM lending protocol, et cetera. They had a liquidity mining program, so I wanted to be a part of that. So I had to bridge from Ethereum to Kanto. So I did that. So I had bridged USDC over to Kanto. I had to convert it from EVM to then to the native Kanto chain. From then on I was able to swap, trade, whatever.
01:05:12.135 - 01:06:06.735, Speaker B: But when I wanted to bridge out, I had to use Osmosis. And so the whole process just reminded me of just typical bridging activity that you do on on Ethereum, which is still very painful. You have ibc, which helps with the comms piece, but you still have to deposit your assets and then Osmosis has to recognize it as a osmosis asset. So you're issued an osmosis token on top of the token that you have. Then you do the activity, then you have to bridge out using another hub, then you have the gravity bridge that will ultimately bridge you out back to Ethereum. What my experience with this bridging is that we're still far along away from a UI UX experience. That would make it seamless for someone to go between hubs and bridges on Cosmos.
01:06:06.735 - 01:06:50.395, Speaker B: It's very painful experience. And then the wallet Kepler as an example, there's probably like 30 hubs you could choose from if you click on the top menu bar. So between the wallet, the bridging between different hubs and then bridging out to Ethereum was overall a very long and painful experience. So I think there's still a lot of work that can be done to abstract away that experience. Yeah, and so what, what's clear here, just based on that is going back to your app chain thesis, is that primarily speaking, I think a lot of activity will. Activity will be done in house. So why bridge to another hub For X if you could just do everything in house.
01:06:50.395 - 01:07:14.791, Speaker B: So an example of this is now that Osmosis has the mindshare for amm, it's very easy for them to deploy a lending protocol. So instead of having to go to another hub, you could just do it within Osmosis. And so really the battle here between different hubs is to become a hub for or a prime brokerage for Defi. Right? That's right, yeah. I think that's the end game.
01:07:14.863 - 01:08:20.523, Speaker A: I think what's going to happen in Cosmos in a few years is there's going to be a de facto Defi hub or maybe a small handful, like no more than five, maybe one, two, three and there's going to be a bunch of mature app chains. By the way, dydx for me is an app, it's not the Defi infra, it's a Defi application. So there's going to be DYDX and there's going to be some games, especially on chain games, which we can talk about later in future episodes that require a lot of scalability and throughput. There's going to be other consumer products and all these different app chains have their own NFTs and tokens, but they can't have their own decentralized exchange. So at some point the users will have to bridge those tokens via IBC into the DeFi hub, be it Osmosis or some other Defi hub and trade it there. I think that's probably what's going to happen to Cosmos.
01:08:20.619 - 01:09:33.467, Speaker B: It's very different than AAVE v3 because AAVE v3 I also consider as I wouldn't consider as app chain but what they do is essentially they have different instances that are ran on different L2s and layer ones. Right. So you have an AAVE on on all of the roll ups. So Polygon Arbitrum, Optimism you have on Avalanche and Ethereum Mainnet. So let's say those five and the experience before was they were just separate products that would fragment liquidity users and the product and the user experience. And now with V3 coming around you could do, you could aggregate those experiences into one and then on the back end you have something called like AAVE Portal that will essentially do the cross chain messaging and bridging between the assets. So as a user experience I'll still see one AAVE app I'll be able to bridge in and out of different chains and I'll just use one app as a way to go through that experience.
01:09:33.467 - 01:09:39.171, Speaker B: So that's a very fundamentally very different process, but I also think there could be a world for that as well.
01:09:39.323 - 01:09:40.947, Speaker A: Yeah, I can see that.
01:09:41.131 - 01:09:51.163, Speaker B: Cool. Great conversation regarding the developer ecosystem and what we're seeing in the space based on what we're seeing within the alliance. So there's some alpha leak there.
01:09:51.299 - 01:10:22.505, Speaker A: But more importantly, I think our conversation today is super high level. I think at some point and soon we're going to bring some guests who are leaders in those ecosystems to really do a deep dive to number one, offer more information, more in depth information. But two, also correct our misunderstanding or misconception or our biases if any, because we have a lot of biases based on our own data. But we want to hear from the sources.
01:10:22.885 - 01:10:42.955, Speaker B: Yeah. Actually next podcast we'll have the founder of Sway, Evan on and so we'll talk a lot about what he thinks about Sway, competitive advantages, et cetera. So if you have any questions, please DM us. We'll definitely ask them. Thanks for joining. We'll see you next time. And don't forget to subscribe.
01:10:42.955 - 01:10:47.175, Speaker B: Thanks for listening to Good Game. Don't forget to subscribe. We'll see you next week.
