00:00:00.120 - 00:00:45.164, Speaker A: It's very hard to predict how much impact AI will have on crypto in terms of security improvement. I think there will be meaningful impact, but it's hard to quantify that before it happens. But what I know for sure is, well, I mean, everyone saw the tweets on Twitter about GPT helping the coders catch some bugs, smart contract bugs. And we have a company at the lines called Pal no more who has been building a tool to automatically catch bugs before GPT came out. And now they're looking into using GPT as a way to help companies or smart contract engineers to audit their code. So I think security overall will increase. However, I'm not saying that AI or, you know, GPT or other LLM models will completely replace human auditors.
