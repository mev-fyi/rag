00:00:00.250 - 00:00:04.190, Speaker A: Welcome to good game. Your no BS insights for crypto founders.
00:00:07.330 - 00:00:27.810, Speaker B: Jupiter is the clearest example that shows real financial benefit to consumers from composability. I would say Jupiter is like the perfect example of that is because they will always pick you the best route regardless, and it's taking as many markets and aggregate and accounting for all the fees and everything else, minimizing the cost for the user and every transaction.
00:00:27.890 - 00:01:07.790, Speaker A: Looking for your next startup idea in crypto? Check out our request for startups list and get inspired at forward slash ideas. Welcome to good game. Today we're going to have Ming from Jupiter, the founder of Jupyter, and Anatoly, founder of Solana, come speak to us about why Solana is one of the best layer ones to use to build high end apps like Jupiter. So I'm pretty excited to talk to them. I really want to dive deep into the infrastructure of what enables Jupyter to be a world class product and then more or less diving deeper into what Jupiter is bringing to the table today and what they're going to bring into the future and some of the new products they're releasing. What are you excited about, Joe?
00:01:07.870 - 00:01:47.326, Speaker C: Obviously our audience knows Salana and Antoli, but main might be a little bit more under the radar. For those who don't know, Jupiter is the leading Dex aggregator on Salana with a market share of over 80%. That is absolutely crazy. And that is compared to the underlying Dex of orca, radium, et cetera. So 80% of retail flow goes to Jupiter rather than the underlying dexes. Recently, Jupiter also launched a perpetual swap protocol, competing with drift. I think last time I checked, their number in terms of volume in dollar amount has surpassed drift as well.
00:01:47.326 - 00:02:01.138, Speaker C: And of course, everyone on Twitter is talking about the Jup token airdrop, so they're doing that too pretty soon to reward the early participants. Imran and I have known Ming for at least three years.
00:02:01.224 - 00:02:04.434, Speaker A: You know how we met them. You know how we met Ming. Here's a good story.
00:02:04.552 - 00:02:05.186, Speaker C: Yeah, go ahead.
00:02:05.208 - 00:02:19.162, Speaker A: Kyver network was part of Alliance's first batch, so it was Lloyd and Ming that joined our program. We worked very closely with both of them to help source liquidity, help them with their fee. This goes deep for us.
00:02:19.296 - 00:02:51.458, Speaker C: My very first mentorship session at alliance in Batch one was with Ming from Kyber. And I remember we were talking about regulatory challenges back then. It was in Defi around Kyber, et cetera. But we've known Ming for a very long time. Obviously Kyber originally or still is on Ethereum, so Min is one of the very few founders that started on Ethereum and then moved to Solana. And we'll talk to him about why, ultimately, he thinks Solana is the right place to build.
00:02:51.544 - 00:03:19.926, Speaker A: Obviously, we want to talk to Anatoly about some of the cool things that are coming out, such as, like, localized fee markets and why that's going to be very different than the way fees are currently generated on Ethereum. Because you could think of L2s as, like, localized fee markets. Right. And that's kind of the way they're scaling, whereas with Solana, they're scaling via their layer one and the hardware requirements. So it's going to be very cool to hear the pros and cons of both. All right, so let's bring on Anatoli and Ming. And so before we get started, Chow, do you want to add any notes?
00:03:20.038 - 00:03:43.854, Speaker C: Yes, actually, I was looking at our application data this morning. With actual data, I usually just base my conclusion off of anecdotal impressions, but now I have real data. So, by the way, this morning I tweeted about the US versus Asia. And us has been losing dominance to Asia over the last three years. I did the same exercise for Solana versus the other ecosystems. I'll share the actual data later. But there is a very clear trend.
00:03:43.854 - 00:04:18.542, Speaker C: So there is a V shape. So last year, second half of 2022, was when FTX happened. Salana founder applications bottomed at that point. And then this year, it's been trending back up. And this is relative to ethereum, cosmos, bitcoin, polka dot avalanche, blah, blah, blah. Oh, by the way, I told Adam Toley the other day that 25% of the applications we've emitted so far for the next cohort are from Salana, and that's the highest ever in our history. So Solana is coming back.
00:04:18.596 - 00:04:19.374, Speaker D: It's already back.
00:04:19.412 - 00:04:20.240, Speaker A: At this point.
00:04:22.690 - 00:04:25.380, Speaker B: It'S never left. Where are we coming back from?
00:04:28.470 - 00:05:04.734, Speaker D: Just. Jesse, it's so funny because I told you I was right. The whole space talks about the thing being dead, right? But to us, we're just building, right? Yeah. So what was insane, right, is that everything you see today, all the brick point developers, everything, right? All the foundations were laid in the last one year. No one paid attention. Right? But incredible amounts of really good progress, like proudly fees, like lookout tables, a lot of really fundamental things that fundamentally change the whole development experience in Solana really happened over the last one year. It's funny because the market, just the price and the activity, right? But I think for us, I think we see the foundation that has been there for last two years.
00:05:04.734 - 00:05:11.658, Speaker D: And Chow was actually really good because Chao was actually the one of the guys that were actually really constantly supporting Solana.
00:05:11.674 - 00:05:12.240, Speaker C: Right.
00:05:14.290 - 00:05:17.440, Speaker D: You were actually very supportive of know. So really grateful for. Yeah.
00:05:17.830 - 00:05:19.330, Speaker C: Appreciate your recognition.
00:05:22.390 - 00:06:02.302, Speaker A: So I want to take us back in time to around 2018. Anatolia, you and Raj first thought about Salana, and there was one thing that you mentioned over every podcast I've listened to you in, was the fact that there was this idea of being able to disrupt New York Stock exchange and Nasdaq and being able to build at the speed of light, applications at the speed of light. I've heard this over and over and over again, so I want to start with that because I feel like that's a good narrative to work backwards from to the designing of the systems in and itself. Why did you choose that particular sector? And then maybe we could talk about some of the infrastructure and technical abilities that Solana has that no other layer one has.
00:06:02.356 - 00:06:21.878, Speaker B: That's an awesome question. So this is like my science fiction dream. Imagine Finance 1000 years from now. Do you still imagine a bunch of people in buildings and all this crusty stuff running it? No. Right. It's all running by computers. It's all super hyper fast.
00:06:21.878 - 00:07:16.870, Speaker B: And the way I thought it could happen is that you have a single computer that does all of it. Right. And byzantine fault tolerance allows you to actually make that a reality because that computer has to have hyper transparency and fault tolerance and just be super reliable and can never stop, but also has to be global and encompass all of the world's information. And I don't want to say decentralized because that's like a word that we made up. But you just think about that like a thousand year from now financial system. What does that look like? So when I first kind of had this eureka moment that there's a way to build use kind of some of the design ideas from cellular networks and blockchain. The immediate first use case that I thought of wasn't settlement or store value in global money because I kind of thought that there were know Ethereum is doing the settlement thing, bitcoin is doing this.
00:07:16.870 - 00:08:43.138, Speaker B: And those are not the topics that I'm even interested in. What I really cared about is, like, low latency, like speed of light information flow systems. And I got kind of more interested in them throughout my career as an engineer because I was building poorly designed trading systems on the side that were just trading on interactive brokers and forex.com and OANDA and all these kind of janky best effort brokerages for hobbyists that I felt like anytime I had a really good algorithm, the data would arrive a little slower and my orders would get submitted a little slower. It was the most frustrating experience you could imagine, maybe as close to what a Dev feels like sometimes, but it just felt like I was getting screwed right by the system. And it's impossible for me to know for sure, and it's impossible for me to compete with folks like jump, because I'd have to give up my first born and a pound of flesh to get a box in the New York stock exchange. So what I thought immediately, I don't know if we're too early, but it seems like it's now possible, using BFT plus super fast implementation of BFT, to build a system that's open and fair and global and can start marching towards a technological kind of utopian end of single, giant computer that's synchronized at the speed of light.
00:08:43.138 - 00:09:22.320, Speaker B: And if that's possible, that system is going to be better than NYSE and all these other things. That was the idea. It's kind of a madman idea, right? But it's as crazy as when the Google guys were like, we're going to index all of the world's, right. Like, that's an absurd dream, but they accomplished it in five, right? Like, I think this might take a little longer because people don't want to give up control of finance. Right? There's a lot of careers involved there. Not librarians, don't care if they get indexed, but a lot of political careers are wrapped up in finance. It's going to take a long time for them to kind of slowly give it up.
00:09:22.320 - 00:09:23.706, Speaker B: It's software.
00:09:23.818 - 00:09:27.538, Speaker D: I think keeping that dream alive is so important. Right. And which is why I'm grateful for that, because.
00:09:27.624 - 00:09:28.260, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:09:28.870 - 00:09:57.340, Speaker D: I feel like we have somewhat became very cynical. Right. If I look at bitcoin arguing about block size and store value, I see ethereum arguing about how many outputs can we spin up. I feel like it has become very cynical. Right. We kind of forgot about the possibility of crypto becoming way more than ERC 20s, right? So I feel like that's actually what really inspires me. Right? It's like, okay, can we be way more than what we have today?
00:09:58.430 - 00:10:56.410, Speaker B: The physics reason why I think it can be competitive is that you have some hyper important market moving event happens in Singapore. That data for that event, the bits that represent that happened, still have to go from Singapore to the New York Stock Exchange. They're still traveling speed of light through fiber or satellite or whatever. At the same time, in Salana 3.0, a transaction is going to fire off from a block producer that's really effectively at Singapore, and that's going to propagate its information around the world through turbine fanning out across the world. And by the time it hits New York Stock Exchange, the trader that's looking at a price at NYSE and a price in a market on Solana is not going to see any arbitrage for that news event, because by the time they see that news event, that transaction already did the price impact of that news. They already see that state transition right as it's being computed, right as the block is being streamed.
00:10:56.410 - 00:11:22.520, Speaker B: So there's no arb between a centralized system like Nizi and a decentralized one like Solana. In this perfect implementation, we have tons of block producers that are geographically distributed. All the data is propagated as fast as switches allow. So that end state of Solana is possible with today's technology and a bunch of blood, sweat, and tears. That's the cool part.
00:11:23.370 - 00:11:48.330, Speaker C: I just want to play devil's advocate, because I want to understand what you just said. Nasdaq and NYSE, the matching of orders itself essentially happens in a single thread, within a single machine, within a single colocation. But on Solana, you have nodes distributed across the world. They still need to come to consensus as to when and at what price the order needs to get matched.
00:11:48.410 - 00:12:34.874, Speaker B: There's different things there. Like, you can actually have consensus happen at these 120 millisecond checkpoint or whatever, as fast as we could make it. But what matters for trading, just like it does on Nasdaq, is inclusion order. Like, which order gets in first. And if you have multiple concurrent block producers all around the world that are all streaming the orders out, and you're near Singapore, and you send your transaction, literally, to the Singapore block producer, and it encodes its transaction as soon as it receives it, right in very small amount of distance, very quickly, it's recorded right there. And then. And then, as it's propagating, you see that partial block being filled in New York, you see it as it's propagating.
00:12:34.874 - 00:13:14.630, Speaker B: That transaction is already there. You cannot get ahead of it. When consensus fires off, it's almost guaranteed, because the only reason why consensus would fail is if there's a network partition and the physical networks fail, and there's errors and stuff there. But there's errors inside Nasdaq, and naive. Sometimes they have to reverse trades. That happens, right? But as Solana gets more robust as there are more nodes, it actually becomes harder and harder for rollback and forks and all that stuff to occur because it gets more and more synchronized. Like the way turbine works, we add more erasure codes, the fan out gets larger, you get more information from the network.
00:13:14.710 - 00:13:17.062, Speaker A: Is that the concept behind quorum subcommittees?
00:13:17.126 - 00:13:46.962, Speaker B: No, that's a slightly different thing. Subcommittees are like a way to. It's a small optimization for us to minimize the number, to only have a fixed number of votes per block, because more votes don't give you any more fault tolerance. You only need like 800 or 400. Just pick some number. What matters is actually how turbine propagates the state. And that's where we do this clever thing with erasure coating and fan out to where the blocks are spraying around the world.
00:13:46.962 - 00:13:52.230, Speaker B: But the way that the spray around the world is very much like at the same time everywhere.
00:13:52.810 - 00:14:04.538, Speaker C: Let me tackle this question from a different angle so that it's more clear for the listener. Why is it better to build a Nasdaq or NYSE on Salana versus on an Ethereum L2?
00:14:04.624 - 00:14:04.874, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:14:04.912 - 00:14:48.706, Speaker B: So with Ethereum L2, in the perfect world, you could build basically a Nasdaq that settles to Ethereum. And what settling means is it submits its data to Ethereum. So you have to pay for the Ethereum cost to submit that data. If you're really building a L2 that gets any advantages from this idea of Ethereum settlement, you have to submit the data there. And those costs are very high right now and are unlikely to be competitive within the next five years based on dank sharding and all these design parameters that they picked. So that's the problem. And two, your sequencer, or the thing that encodes transactions, is going to be centralized unless you basically rebuild Solana.
00:14:48.706 - 00:14:54.394, Speaker B: And if you rebuild Solana, what's the point? Just go use Solana. It's already done.
00:14:54.592 - 00:15:34.102, Speaker D: Okay, let me just share a little bit here. Right. From a actually builder perspective, practical perspective, I feel like the conversation of Binance and Nasdaq really misses one really important point, right? That Nasdaq is one market, binance is one market, right? And you really don't want that, right? You really want the ability for anyone to spin out the markets. Singapore, you should have a stock market in Singapore, you have a stock market in Africa, you have a stock market anywhere, right? And someone should be able to execute a trade that goes through all these markets at once atomically, right? Someone's going to arbitrage across a latin american market, Singapore market, african market all at once, instantly. Right. Arbitraging across all that. Right.
00:15:34.102 - 00:16:02.490, Speaker D: I feel like we talk about centralized exchanges, but we kind of miss the point, which is like, there's a really massive advantage of decentralized systems, right. That they can all be in one place and aggregate across, like. No, there's no way. There's no way ever in the world, right? You ever do exchange order, ever. So just real quick here, is that I think, for example, people ask me, do you think the liquidity on will ever overtake central exchanges? Right. And then the answer is simple. If you're talking about any single amm.
00:16:02.490 - 00:16:20.710, Speaker D: No. Right. But as a whole ecosystem, will we have enough liquidity to overtake binance? Will we have enough markets or innovation to kind of create new stock systems? Yeah, we can. No problem. Over time. I feel like that's actually one massive advantage of decentralized systems that I think we tend to not talk about when we do the comparison.
00:16:21.290 - 00:16:24.966, Speaker A: Well, I think Jupiter did about 3.5 billion in trading volume last month.
00:16:24.988 - 00:16:26.726, Speaker D: Right? Yeah, it's good.
00:16:26.828 - 00:16:28.950, Speaker A: So that's some signal there as it is.
00:16:29.020 - 00:17:04.478, Speaker D: The whole point here is this. Right. I think Toby's point is that the biggest difference between what toy is saying earlier, right. Is that when you spin up more l two s, right. Now, each l two is going to have their own set of markets, own set of apps, right. And fundamentally, that's a very big constraint, means that it doesn't matter how good a technology in one particular auto is, you are still going to have all these markets that bring spread out across different blockchains. What this also means is that you can never really kind of have the same kind of composability or market synergy as you have everything on blockchain.
00:17:04.478 - 00:17:11.158, Speaker D: Right? So I think that's actually one major reason why I don't think the future of finance, our tools, the way you.
00:17:11.164 - 00:17:19.370, Speaker A: Could argue this, is that Ethereum L2s are essentially creating their own localized fee markets. Right. On the L2s, there's a very.
00:17:19.440 - 00:17:34.942, Speaker B: Big difference between that kind of localization versus what happens on Salana. They're creating their own isolated environments between L2s, but each one is generic and cannot handle an NFT mint and like a DeFi liquidation at the same time.
00:17:35.076 - 00:18:11.626, Speaker A: Got it. Tarun had a talk recently about dimensionality of fees, and I know you've been working. You and the research team has been working on the adding priority fees to Solana, which I think has helped scale. And you mentioned this concept earlier, which is like database hotspots right. Wherever there's hotspots in certain programs, then what you can do is you can create, like, arbitrary buckets of units where certain amount of transactions can get hit. And then after that, transactions would have to wait for the next block. So could you explain a bit more about the dimensionality of gas fees, priority fees, and how this is going to help Solana scale over time? With more apps running on Solana in.
00:18:11.648 - 00:18:17.130, Speaker C: Itself, can we also use words that the average person understands? Words not like dimensionality.
00:18:18.750 - 00:18:21.626, Speaker B: Can I make one comment about the previous topic?
00:18:21.738 - 00:18:22.206, Speaker D: Yes.
00:18:22.308 - 00:19:06.550, Speaker B: What is so fundamentally different about the L2 thing is that when you have 1000 L2, they're all separate little environments that are asynchronous from each other. It's very hard to have a guarantee that everything happens at the same time across all of them. And this is why it's beautiful. When you do a 20 cent trade through Jupiter, like, literally $0.20, it'll hit four different markets and trade them all to give you the best optimal price. It's like literally at the airport, if you went to four different turxy exchanges and be like, have $0.20, give me the optimal price, they would laugh at you, right? Because the work to do that, and they'll give you a flat fee for each one of those trades.
00:19:06.550 - 00:19:53.366, Speaker B: It's impossible to actually scale it down. And this really demonstrates the sand and the gears between these asynchronous environments that all have to synchronize at different times. And each synchronization costs a fee and has to settle, and the transfers all pay a fee, and it's very hard to hide it. People will build systems where they'll give you virtual prices, and then that's settle in the background and try to optimize and create efficiencies there. But they will all carry risk, and they will all be slow and will all be more expensive than here's. Like, literally, I'm checking five different marketplaces around the world, but all in one computer. And the cost to check as many of them as you want is the cost of moving electrons in one machine.
00:19:53.366 - 00:20:13.440, Speaker B: And that's kind of like the science fiction magic that we want to create at Solana. Is that, like, one giant computer where everything really is all in one chunk of RAm? Like, the entire financial system is all loaded in one RAM, and it's all possible, right? If you can dream it, you can do it.
00:20:14.770 - 00:20:50.298, Speaker D: I know you can move on. But I really want to talk about this for being really important. This whole l two thing is really important because I don't think people get it. And it's like when your applications are speed up, okay, think about this way, right? It's like when the utility and utilization and use case on Solana increases over time, right? Why? Because it's one blockchain, right? Because something like Jupiter, right. The more you get more markets to spin up more tokens is all one blockchain. We bridge tokens from Ethereum to Solana is one blockchain, right? So it becomes more and more usable term, right? And not just that, the UX, right. The usability is the same, right.
00:20:50.298 - 00:21:17.734, Speaker D: And regardless of whether they are 1000 markets or 10,000 markets, you can always transact across them in one transaction. Now contrast that to contrast of the outus, right? Now, when the popular apps are broken up, right, between different out tools, the UX actually goes down, but you can't compose across them, right? It's like imagine, imagine if you go from say Google to Facebook, right? You need to change your Internet, right? That'll be pretty awkward, right?
00:21:17.932 - 00:21:24.502, Speaker A: The counterargument, like the Ethereum researcher is going to say is, well, over time they'll be solved, right? You have bridges as an example.
00:21:24.636 - 00:21:29.110, Speaker D: I'm just giving their counterargument that they will be solved. I'm not kidding.
00:21:30.350 - 00:21:35.914, Speaker A: Have generalized sequencers that can sequence different chains as well.
00:21:35.952 - 00:21:48.862, Speaker C: I'll give you my counterpoint, and it's none of that technical stuff. My counterpoint is composability might be overrated. Composability really important. And so far, among the Defi applications, I haven't seen much of composability yet.
00:21:48.916 - 00:22:01.374, Speaker D: Correct. Let me push back really strongly on that. Go ahead. No, it really triggers me. Okay, so let me just push on that. All right. The reason doesn't matter is because we are creating all these islands of Ponzi's.
00:22:01.374 - 00:22:19.622, Speaker D: Sorry. Okay, I'm sorry. Because we have to move past this. We have to move past this very cynical view that we create blockchains and all we do is replicate the existing infra and then mint coins and call it a day. No, I'm not here to do this. I'm here to kind of. We are here to broaden the use case.
00:22:19.622 - 00:23:38.558, Speaker D: Right? Now, the reason why composability is overrated is very simple, okay? Now it's because people don't care. People just want new amms, new tokens and farming and they move on, right? But if we really care about moving the state forward right now, if you really care about building a global financial system, that everyone can use, right? And then if you really care about having a system where like 2 billion people can all use at the same time across different markets and use cases and remittances, everything visa, if you really care about the whole visa promise, then no, then composability is not overrated. It's extremely important. But if you only care about creating isolated environments whereby we can min new coins, yeah, then composability over it, I guess it really goes to what we care about and the reason for us at Jupiter, right? I mean, if you look at all the things you're building, right, whether it is the aggregation or Jupiter start or where Jupiter start or the pubs thing or the whole entire product stack, it's all because we believe in it, right? We believe that, okay, there's going to be more and more projects on Solana, there's going to be more and more systems and we want to kind of bring them all together and make the whole ecosystem and the whole experience much better. So I think it really depends on where we come from, right? Do we want to have an ecosystem whereby, okay, we are very happy to create, to spin out a server and call it auto and then create coins, or do you want to actually make things more useful? I think it's actually a very pivotal point for industry.
00:23:38.654 - 00:23:56.854, Speaker C: Let me play devil's advocate again. I'm not saying composability is overrated, I'm just playing devil's advocate. What is, in your opinion, the most important application of composability? Something that needs two applications on a single word computer to compose with each other. What's the most important application that you can think of?
00:23:56.892 - 00:24:06.154, Speaker D: I think the idea of, or I think everything we talked about earlier. Right. I think Jupiter is very good. I think aggregators are a very good Pacific example of composability because you look.
00:24:06.192 - 00:24:08.886, Speaker C: For the best price across multiple marketplaces.
00:24:08.998 - 00:24:30.158, Speaker B: Jupiter is the clearest example that shows real financial benefit to consumers from composability. I would say is Jupiter is like the perfect example of that is because they will always pick you the best route regardless. And it's taking as many markets and aggregate and accounting for all the fees and everything else, minimizing the cost for the user and every transaction.
00:24:30.254 - 00:24:54.234, Speaker C: On this note, you and I talked about this observation that we made, which is that on Ethereum, the leading aggregator is not the most dominant user facing application, right? On Ethereum, people use uniswap rather than one inch, but on Salana, people use the aggregator, which is Jupiter, rather than the on and on. Decks, which is, for example, orca. There's a fundamental reason behind this. Can you explain to the audience why that's the case?
00:24:54.352 - 00:25:25.378, Speaker D: Yeah, it's actually very simple. It's like when things cost $10, people don't use it. It's not very complicated. It's like, okay, I just point on to be very clear on something, I love Ethereum, okay? I came from Ethereum world. I mean, Chow and Imran knows from way back. I'm sure Toli is very grateful to Ethereum as well. A lot of the standards that once or not, are based on Ethereum, right? So I think we are all like big fans of Ethereum, but sometimes I think on the highlight a few things, right? It's like when things cost like $10 to run a transaction, right? When it costs $20 to test a defi application, right.
00:25:25.378 - 00:25:49.014, Speaker D: Then people don't use it. That's it. No, complicated, right? So to do a complicated routing through Ethereum is very expensive. On Ethereum itself to do a complicated routing, it will cost you like 30, $40, right? Or even $300. Now, if you go to l two, you don't have the density of markets available to have a complicated program that attributed to make sense. But on Solana, it costs nothing. It literally wouldn't cost you more to rock through like 20 markets.
00:25:49.014 - 00:26:16.418, Speaker D: And that's actually one big difference. And this actually palates to a broader point about Ethereum versus Solana, right? Is that on Ethereum, you can only do simple things because on the main ethereum chain itself, doing anything complicated is too expensive. Right. On our tools, the applications are always getting too fragmented. So you wouldn't actually have the density of applications that you need to actually do complicated stuff right now. But on sauna, those two things are not true. Okay, honestly, the first time we built Jupiter, we.
00:26:16.418 - 00:26:42.106, Speaker D: Okay, and we did a ten cent swap, right? It's not just markets by tokens too, by the way. It's like you brought in two many different tokens and markets, and it cost us nothing. We're like, wow, holy shit. It was a really big moment for us to see that screenshot of that market, like 0.2 cents. I think that is actually the two reasons why. Number one is that it costs you nothing to do something that's fundamentally way more complicated and interesting.
00:26:42.106 - 00:27:35.486, Speaker D: And the second reason is that the number of markets available and systems available on sauna is going to just grow exponentially over time. For example, there's this program called Sanctum and so on that does immediate liquid staking unstaking okay, that's actually huge because, for example, say you have a big order coming in, right? That you want to say so to a stick sold. Right? Now, Jupiter won't just find you amm, right? Jupiter will find you. Okay, so maybe say, okay, 20% goes through Oka and 30% goes through multiple hops, but okay, maybe order is too big, it can't fit into amms. So you directly take it into salana, true sanctum, and give you Xo, right? So all these things happen. There is really wide variety of amms, el obs, sticking programs that can all be done in a single transaction, right? Those are all things that you do have here, obs on Ethereum. It's too expensive, right? You can't compose across sticking amms on Ethereum too.
00:27:35.486 - 00:27:43.310, Speaker D: It's too expensive. So I think all these things are the reasons why. I think there's way infinitely more things you can do as a number of use cases come out.
00:27:43.380 - 00:28:18.202, Speaker A: So going back to maybe the roll ups, we talked about how Ethereum is planning to scale through, maybe spinning out more roll ups. That's their version of localized fee markets, as we discussed. Obviously, it's very different than how Solana thinks about it. So thinking more about how you're thinking about designing, let's say, the next version of Solana, you talked about a few things. One is priority fees, one is localized fees, dimensionality of fees. And if you want to kind of explain that term for our audience, I think that would be very helpful. And then thinking through what hotspots of programs you mean and how that scales over time.
00:28:18.256 - 00:28:20.438, Speaker C: The word dimensionality really hurts my brain.
00:28:20.534 - 00:28:21.260, Speaker D: It does.
00:28:22.350 - 00:28:28.798, Speaker C: I have TPT from college physics course or something. Physics. There's something called dimensionality, and it really hurts me.
00:28:28.884 - 00:28:32.714, Speaker A: We got to make it a lot easier for people to understand what's happening.
00:28:32.852 - 00:29:07.702, Speaker B: I'll try not to use the Laplace transform in this explanation. So basically, operating systems in the 90s, Linux included, and Windows, if you remember Windows 95, they were single threaded environments. They could only run one application at a time. Even if you had, like Windows, you could switch between. It was one app running at a time. And it took like literally a ten year effort for Microsoft to switch to the antique kernel and ship Windows 2000. That was like the first desktop OS that was built on a modern kernel that could do multiple apps.
00:29:07.702 - 00:29:53.434, Speaker B: And the reason why they had to do that is because cores stopped getting faster by frequency and they started growing wider by core counts. And you got two core systems by the end of the 90s. But then it rapidly just started doubling every two years. You basically just started adding hyperthreads on cores instead of adding frequency. So no one talks about frequency scaling at all anymore. In CPUs, it's all about how many hyperthreads you can support. And you can literally buy a box now with 1000 or hyperthreads, but the OS and the software has to support it and has to support in a way that it's efficient to run a single box with multiple applications on it, versus buying a bunch of different boxes and running one app at a time.
00:29:53.434 - 00:31:02.362, Speaker B: And if your software sucks, it's actually not efficient to all run it in one, because they will do a denial of service in each other, right? One service is getting hit with a bunch of stuff, and all of a sudden your machine freezes and takes up too much ram and all this shit and kicks out all the other applications. So this is a massive engineering challenge to do, to build an OS that's truly like multi application and scales in this nice elastic way to where you add hardware and more apps work, and the apps can't kill each other. It's hard to do it in a permission environment where you control everything. We have to do it in a permissionless environment where we don't control the hardware or anything, right? Like we're just built a protocol that allows that to happen. And this is the really hard challenge. And Ethereum is going the other way where they're literally like, well, for whatever reason, we don't want to take that path. What we want to do is basically give everyone their own little box, and there's a protocol for them to communicate to each other through the Ethel one DA layer, and that's fine, but you're creating these like a totally different system where you have to have separate boxes.
00:31:02.362 - 00:31:58.674, Speaker B: Each one of them basically runs one application in a single threaded way. It's very easy to reason about. The economics are very simple in each little box, and then they all kind of compete for the DA layer, and that's fairly easy to reason about as well. This has to work not only at the compute like threads and all this memory and all this other stuff actually has to work with fees and economics too. Now, because the problem that happens in that single threaded mempool environment is that you have like an NFT mint, a meme coin, and a liquidation all happening at the same time. Each one of those has like an economic value to the user, and they're different users, different applications, but they'll price it, right? Like it's worth it for me to spend up to $100 in fees to get the ape coin airdrop now versus like, wait ten minutes. And that liquidation bot is like, hey, this liquidation is worth $50,000.
00:31:58.674 - 00:33:00.418, Speaker B: It's really worth it for me, $49,000 in fees to make sure that I'm in the block now versus in ten minutes, because it's going to be gone, right? So all of these different actors will bid up to get included in that first block, really in the first part of the block, and they're all fighting each other. And because it's a single threaded environment for execution, it's a single threaded environment for the mempool and everything else, they all bid to be to the top of the block, and you will bid up to your economic opportunity, and that creates this global fee spike, that kind of what pushes the floor to be included in the block up for everyone. And that's problematic because that means that you can't really have an NFT mint and defi in the same ecosystem because they will increase the fees for each other. That's like, in operating system terms, it's as if I'm running like two apps, right? My browser and the slack thing that's in the background slows the fuck down of my computer, right? And I can't use it anymore.
00:33:00.514 - 00:33:02.600, Speaker A: I am like, what's happening on Ethereum, right?
00:33:03.450 - 00:33:54.546, Speaker B: Like, why is my operating system so bad that the slack application that's in the background is causing my video to jitter, right? That's an operating system failure. So the way that we solve it on Solana is, I wish we had this design from the start because it's brilliant, but we walked into it falling flat on our face, basically. We saw a similar thing that you saw on Ethereum. You had an NFT mint, and people really want this NfT mint more than anything else. And they spin up a whole bunch of servers and they all slam the network with transactions to be first in the mint. And that causes a whole bunch of queues and everything else to blow up in size, and they're processing all these duplicate messages. And the problem is we can increase fees globally, and that would work, but that would kill the whole point of having composable system with multiple applications.
00:33:54.546 - 00:34:58.406, Speaker B: Because if one application increases fees for everyone, what you should do is then split the chain and run a different app in every chain to avoid that problem, right? Like, you don't want your liquidations in the same application fee market as your NFT mint because you don't want the price for the NFT mint to have any impact on the price of payments and the price of Defi trades or central in order books. So if we couldn't figure out how to solve this, Solana was dead. It was kind of like an existential moment for the engineering team. But luckily, the way that the runtime works is that every transaction has to specify all the memory locations on chain that it's going to read and write. And this was done for performance reasons, like we wanted to maximally paralyze the throughput of the runtime. And that means if we know the information ahead of time, we can schedule everything in this perfectly overlapping way and just execute like crazy. And that was awesome, because the way that these hotspots occur is the classical database hotspot.
00:34:58.406 - 00:35:26.846, Speaker B: Problem is, everybody's writing to the same spot. All the NFT mints to create this mint, they're all writing to this one mint location. All the liquidation bots are trying to hit the same market that is being liquidated. They're all writing to the same spot that has implemented that liquidation. And there's no real way to paralyze that information. You only have one spot that represents that one loan that's about to get liquidated. You only have one NFT mint.
00:35:26.846 - 00:36:30.370, Speaker B: So that is kind of a classical, old school database hotspot problem. In retrospect, I'm like, why didn't I think of this? Obviously, when we were building this? And the nice thing is that because the transaction has all the information for this, we don't have to actually execute anything. We can literally do this very dumb thing is you order all the transactions by the priority fee that they're paying, and then you start filling up the block. But you also keep track of the watermark, of all the memory locations that they're writing to and how much work they're doing at each write. And as soon as a watermark hits the single threaded limit, which is roughly one fourth of a block, or 12 million cus, anything else that touches that storage location, that watermark gets delayed to the next block. So you took all the highest paying things that touched it, nft mint, you filled up one quarter of the block with them, but then you also have three fourth of the block left for all the other stuff. And it's very rare that you actually have two hotspots happening at the same time at the same time, meaning here within four and a milliseconds of each other.
00:36:30.370 - 00:37:08.190, Speaker B: Usually things, even if they happen at the same time, from a user's perspective, it's within five minutes of each other. But that's an eon for a computer, right? Four is actually a lot. So you fill up the first hotspot, then you fill up everything else. So we really rarely see blocks being economically full. Blocks do get full, but that's because there is all sorts of opportunistic arbs that will fire at the lowest price possible to be like, hey, if you include me and execute me, there's like one thousandths of a percentage chance that I will be a profitable trade. But I don't even know, but include me just in case. Right? And that's fine.
00:37:08.190 - 00:37:52.594, Speaker B: People should submit that kind of stuff, but as soon as there's any economic reason to be ahead of that, they're trivial to outbid. So this kind of like was an existential problem that if we didn't solve the whole point of Solana would have been moot, it would have been useless. And we did come up with a solution that's very unique to crypto, and it creates this multiple dimensional market for use the word dimension, not for applications. It's not like DeFi versus NFTs versus something, but it is literally for the current economic hotspot on chain. So it's very precise in how it separates these things. It's very dynamic. There's no control that we need to do.
00:37:52.594 - 00:38:11.450, Speaker B: It happens automatically as markets move, as information propagates. So kind of beautiful to see priority fees spike because of defi, but all oracle stuff that doesn't touch that or all of helium hotspot traffic happening without any impact.
00:38:12.270 - 00:38:14.294, Speaker A: Is this something ethereum could adopt?
00:38:14.422 - 00:38:45.860, Speaker B: This requires a big pile of rework. You need to rework EVM to require access lists. Maybe it's possible without access lists, but by preprocessing and generating them and signing them by the block producer. But you have to kind of propagate this information all the way from the bottom to the top of the mempool and then have the mempool run in multiple dimensions, which is a huge pain in the way that this would be like a huge undertaking. And we'll touch.
00:38:46.470 - 00:38:49.366, Speaker C: Monad is working. Imran, I don't know if you've heard of them.
00:38:49.388 - 00:38:51.526, Speaker A: I haven't talked to Monad, but the.
00:38:51.548 - 00:38:58.166, Speaker C: Monad founder comes from jump as well, so they know how the super low level optimization stuff works.
00:38:58.268 - 00:39:22.046, Speaker B: I believe they are not trying to force every developer to have an access list, and they're doing something similar to how move is doing its optimist parallelism. I don't know if any of those approaches are going to work like they're smart engineers. Right. If they have an idea that it might work, there's a good chance that it might. But it's a lot of work to get the stuff tuned and working. And we'll see. Right.
00:39:22.046 - 00:39:28.290, Speaker B: All of these systems are going to be competing for developers for user transactions and all this other stuff.
00:39:28.360 - 00:39:43.960, Speaker D: The other really big thing here is that we have to remember that EVM is built on a lot of previous standards. Right. And things. Right. The whole accounting model on episode now and the whole ERC 20 thing is completely different. Right. The whole accounting model, everything is completely different and stuff.
00:39:43.960 - 00:40:02.726, Speaker D: So for someone, Mona. Right. It's not just about the infra. Right. I think the infra is one thing, but you also need to migrate the entire kind of SSC infrastructure that's built on top of that. I think that's actually one challenge that I think people don't talk about. Because in order to leverage that, because you can build the most parallel system underneath.
00:40:02.726 - 00:40:25.250, Speaker D: Right. But in order to leverage that parallel system, everything from the UI to the way you're passing the transactions at the level all the way down needs to move as well. It's actually really difficult. Right. So one of the things that we noticed when we first started building on Solana is that it's actually very different. The whole thing looks nothing like how we build EVM. Right.
00:40:25.250 - 00:40:38.326, Speaker D: And I know a lot of people think that's a problem. Right. But we saw that as a plus because in the sense that, oh, wow, someone is actually trying to do things fundamentally differently. Right. To enable new capabilities. Right. So I think that's actually one thing that we should take into account.
00:40:38.326 - 00:40:43.898, Speaker D: It's not just the infra, but also the entire stack that is built on top. Yeah.
00:40:43.984 - 00:41:23.538, Speaker B: So there is a parallel EVM neon that's running on Solana that does take advantage of this. There is a limitation there, though, because they have to translate an Ethereum transaction into kind of like an event loop on Solana. And that translation is effectively single threaded, but they do basically hide all of the access list, all this stuff for you. So when neon is submitting its Solana transactions into Solana, all that stuff is running in parallel and utilizing priority markets. And they can actually have multiple neon events occurring in different Solana fees, even though they're all touching a VM instance.
00:41:23.634 - 00:41:52.000, Speaker C: This is a slight comment, but I don't know if you guys see the same thing that I see, which is I feel like the DNA of Solana is very much more engineering focused, and the DNA of Ethereum is research academic. Vitali is not an engineer. He dropped out of school and then Gavin Wood coded the first version of Ethereum. But he's more of an academic than an engineer. I feel like these things have very long, big impacts down the road.
00:41:55.270 - 00:42:43.798, Speaker B: I graduated urbanish champagne in 2003 and ended up at Qualcomm. And I was there for the next 13 years, and I literally saw every year phone hardware get twice as good. So it was moving faster than Moore's law because consumer demand was so high, I had to code my software such that the next year I didn't have to rewrite. So this was something that was ingrained into me. Okay, don't write software that sucks. Actually try to write it in a scalable way that effectively uses caches and all this other stuff, as I'm anticipating hardware changes because I don't want to create extra work for myself. So I already, in my experience as an engineer, I saw that really rapid Moore's law like effect on industry.
00:42:43.798 - 00:42:53.540, Speaker B: This industry is no different. If crypto really became the heart of finance, Solana would get a thousand times faster in a span of six years.
00:42:54.070 - 00:43:08.118, Speaker C: I think there is a fundamental question here, which is in my mind, if the demand for blockbase outpaces Morse law, then at some point Solana layer one will be congested as well. Is that a fair statement?
00:43:08.214 - 00:43:40.142, Speaker B: You can literally have two boxes per validator, right? Like, if there's so much demand that people are like, oh man, we literally need 10 million transactions per second. You're talking about so much economic incentive that deploying this hardware is the smallest problem. The hardest problem is going to be like building the software to make sure that all this stuff stays consistent and working. The cost of the hardware is zero in comparison.
00:43:40.206 - 00:43:43.102, Speaker C: So you don't think L2 will ever happen on Salana?
00:43:43.166 - 00:44:33.314, Speaker B: There is very little reason for it. And the reason why there's so much investment in L2 and Ethereum is because the cost of the L1 is so high that you can pitch to investors that our L2 is going to extract value somewhere between optimum cost, which is Salana, and Ethereum. On Salana, what are you going to pitch? Oh, this L2 is slightly faster. People have hacked together L2 like things like, I would say, like get code, uses a couple tricks to build very fast payments, notifications. You can do that for trading systems. So these are like asynchronous systems that run on top of Salana, but they don't need proofs. They're literally just doing tricks to optimize the number of messages sent to the L1.
00:44:33.314 - 00:44:51.466, Speaker B: And when they're sent, you can do all the stuff. It's very easy to build. Like a couple of engineers can crank it out over a weekend without needing to go spend 18 months and L2 research and fraud proofs and you get all the benefits that you could possibly have. But there's very little fee difference there.
00:44:51.568 - 00:44:54.182, Speaker D: Pifnet is SVM, right? Is it Pifnet?
00:44:54.246 - 00:45:16.894, Speaker B: Yeah, Pif is their own signers that wanted to do the push pull model. It kind of makes sense for them to run an app chain. They're always going to be app chains because there is some commercial reason to run an app chain where you're effectively, it's a semi permission system. You want semi permission control over this and sovereignty. Go have a ball like go fork. Solana. It's the best app chain ever.
00:45:17.092 - 00:45:24.850, Speaker D: I think that answered your question, right? I think, for example, Pifnet is actually a good example for L two, right? That runs on, that makes sense for Salana, right?
00:45:25.000 - 00:45:31.750, Speaker B: It's not an L two. There's no da layer bridge, there's no fraud proof. It's an app chain.
00:45:34.010 - 00:45:42.780, Speaker D: But it sounds like app chain that runs using SDM. Come on, what's l two anyway, right? It's a server, however, sorry.
00:45:45.950 - 00:45:47.770, Speaker B: Server and a multi sync.
00:45:49.150 - 00:46:00.638, Speaker D: But just to calculate the point, I think it's really interesting because I haven't taught before, but I think a good example of app chains that run an SVM that fits data to Salana is a pipnet. So I think those make a lot of sense.
00:46:00.724 - 00:46:39.820, Speaker B: So my definition of an L two is there's a data availability bridge between the two domains and you can actually technically build that bridge between Ethereum and Salana. If Ethereum throughput is ever high enough, you can take all of Salana data, dump it on Ethereum and a Salana state route, and you can have the fraud proof and the whole thing. You can do the other way. You can actually make Ethereum a Salana l two right now by taking all of the Ethereum blocks, which is not that much data, dumping it through Salana, and then having a protocol to do the fraud challenge and the Ethereum state route. So that would make Ethereum a Salana L two.
00:46:41.390 - 00:46:52.142, Speaker D: The fraud proof stuff in l two is how is it coming along? Has it ever been done before? Has someone actually executed a successful fraud proof on optimism. And actually it actually worked.
00:46:52.196 - 00:46:54.070, Speaker A: Not optimism. Arbitrum.
00:46:54.090 - 00:46:54.562, Speaker D: Yes.
00:46:54.696 - 00:46:57.426, Speaker A: Okay, yeah, they've had it for a while.
00:46:57.528 - 00:46:58.130, Speaker D: So far.
00:46:58.200 - 00:47:26.090, Speaker B: It's still allow list only for submitting. That's right, proofs. It's still kind of permissioned fraud proof layer with a multi sig that controls a bridge contract. So what's frustrating about these systems is that the security of the system is the weakest link in the stack. If you're doing analysis, right? Like, hey, look, I built you a hypervisor, and it's all the other stuff, but all the memory is open, you're like, no, that's the weak spot. Doesn't matter. All the layers you built.
00:47:26.090 - 00:48:30.494, Speaker B: So all of these systems have an upgrade path for emergencies because they're so complex, and that complexity makes people worried, and it's rightly so, that they need a very fast upgrade path for that code so they have a multisig to control it. And that's the weakest link. So if it is possible to construct that multi sig in a secure way that is good enough for people to hold enough control over all the funds in that L2, then it is possible to construct it for a bridge. And the benefit for a bridge like wormhole is that you're actually shrinking all the other code to a very simple observable system where you have deposit in mint out, and actually the code base in warmhole is much, much smaller. And the risk of hacks and all this other stuff goes down and you can even make it provable. So in my mind, I think we're kind of like playing a lot of marketing games right now in the L two space. I think I'm hopeful that some of these systems will get to a point where there can be frozen, and once they're there, then that could be cool.
00:48:30.494 - 00:48:32.942, Speaker B: But right now, it still feels pretty far away.
00:48:33.076 - 00:48:48.406, Speaker C: We talked a lot about the advantages on the infra side of salana versus Ethereum. In terms of applications. There's got to be some only possible Solana type of applications. What are you guys excited about that are only possible, or Solana makes a lot better?
00:48:48.508 - 00:49:36.894, Speaker B: Yeah, payments is one. That's obvious. Because of this localized fee markets, you can actually have payments in the same domain as defi. And this is really like, we haven't hit that point where that's important yet, but this is where I think composability will finally be like, oh, yeah, it's obvious, but if you have payments in Ethereum or a L2 that experiences, like, a fee spike, your fees for your day to day payment, visa processor go up and they're like, what the fuck? I need to run my own l two or my own app chain. That's an outcome that we want to avoid. And localized fee markets provide that so you can have payments. Salon is fast enough to do in person checkout, right? Because the expectation there for visa is like the whole transaction completes under two and a half seconds.
00:49:36.894 - 00:49:59.302, Speaker B: The P 90 on Salana is like 1.4 seconds or something like that, usually. So 90% of transactions finish in 1.4 seconds or faster. So you can have this checkout experience, which is awesome. And obviously price is low enough to where I think it's comparable to their internal infra at this point. There's a bunch of payments applications, mostly focused on cross border remittance.
00:49:59.302 - 00:51:01.226, Speaker B: If you look at the stats for USDC, I think something like crazy, like $80 billion worth of USDC is moved around this month, probably mostly because of DFI. So my hope is that. I don't know if it's realistic or not, but my hope is in the next 18 months, the stablecoin bill passes. Everyone and their mother issues a USB stablecoin. And you see this massive competition to be like the global digital dollar that's used for every niche that you can imagine a payments dollar being used for not just competing in the US, but globally, right? And that creates that kind of massive demand for block space and the massive opportunity to bring all these people on chain with wallets. And once you have 20, 30 million people that have dollars right in their wallets, the next thing is like, how do we offer them yield? How do we offer them DFI services, all this other stuff. Then they plug in and you actually have commercial retail defi.
00:51:01.226 - 00:51:16.758, Speaker B: That's my dream of how we get to that next stage in crypto. I don't know how realistic it is, but it feels like our US congresspeople are just sleeping on this massive opportunity for the US financial system to really take over the rest of the world.
00:51:16.924 - 00:51:26.120, Speaker C: By the way, here's an alpha for you guys. Ming and anatoly, you're up against Tron in Latin America for sure. You're up against.
00:51:27.930 - 00:51:30.690, Speaker A: Makerdao also. Dai is also very popular.
00:51:30.850 - 00:51:36.522, Speaker C: Dai is pretty popular in Latin America, but Tron, USDT is the dominant player there for sure.
00:51:36.576 - 00:52:43.294, Speaker D: I would just jump in real quick here, right? Is that when you have so many different tokens, right, say you have, say 30 variants of US dollars, and then you have like 20 variants of euros, right? And then you have the Singapore dollar, the japanese yen, right? Because everyone's going to have their own stable coins, right? What you really need for visa experience is that you need the ability to go from any variant of stable to any variant of token very easily, right. I think that's actually a really good example what's possible on Solana, right? And also by Jupiter, right? Because on Jupiter it doesn't matter how many markets they are. And because the whole payment, the whole payment thing, the whole swap, payment transfer thing divides the payment to a bunch of people, right? And then all that happens again, like 1 second, 0.2 cents, and it would not be affected if there's any big congestion going on somewhere else, right. These three things are actually really important criteria, the first being compatibility, the second being speed, and the third one being like reliability. The reason why I think this conversation is important, right, is because I think we have to adopt a much more expensive view of crypto, where we really try to bring, not just create new products.
00:52:43.332 - 00:52:44.238, Speaker C: Grow the pie.
00:52:44.404 - 00:53:02.760, Speaker D: Grow, precisely, grow pie, right. And really grow use case, right. These payment use cases, remittance use cases, and swapping use cases are really important. So I think anything that involves the imagination of replacing visa, replacing Nasdaq, I think all these things can only. So far, from what I see so far, I think Solana is the best place to do this.
00:53:04.250 - 00:53:10.360, Speaker C: Okay, wait, so main, you did an aggregator, Jupiter, and then you did the perps. Are we getting to payment now?
00:53:11.370 - 00:53:54.934, Speaker D: The way we think about is this, right, is like, okay, so do you mind if I switch topics for a while real quick? Of course, yeah. Okay. So on ethereum, right, there's a reason why every single application on Ethereum, right, goes multi chain, right? Like for example, whether you aave or one inch or uniswap or anyone, right? You go multi chain. And actually, honestly, when we first started, everyone thought we were saying, oh, they asked us when know when this, when FDOs, right? Of course we didn't, right? You know, here's the reason why. Because on Ethereum, the economic incentives are for you to go multichain. You deploy a new chain, you get new results and new capital. Your token pumps everything, right? So your value is spread out, right? You spread out, you provide a tin value, and we spread it out across many different networks in hope of growing a pie.
00:53:54.934 - 00:54:56.262, Speaker D: Your incentive to grow a pie is not actually to be more useful. It's really not, right. The way you grow your own pie is that you just deploy across multiple things. Whereas on Sona is very different, the game becomes very different because we expect the number of users, we expect number of users, number of use cases, number of tokens, number of markets to all grow in this one blockchain and one ecosystem, right? So it will make sense for us to really provide deep value and provide a really seamless experience across the whole stack on this blockchain. And what does that mean? It means that, okay, on things that we feel like is good for us to have a UI, for example, perps, for example, swap, for example, DCA for example, limit order, we put them on UI. But for things like payments and stuff, we actually have a really great set of APIs and everything. So every single major payment network on payment project on swana uses, right, to kind of process payments.
00:54:56.262 - 00:55:25.170, Speaker D: So you can actually pay in one thing and get something else. You can pay in semi coin and get received in USDC and all that is practically free. The best visa experience you can ever go. If I go to China, I pay my Singapore or US credit card. That thing happens right on the background, the USD gets transferred to room b or whatever. So same thing, I think. So for us at Jupiter, the way we think about it is simple, right? Number one, how do we provide deep value to a growing son of high? So again, this really goes back to the whole construct of the market.
00:55:25.170 - 00:55:57.982, Speaker D: Again, the composability thing is really important because if you cannot compose across all markets and even users, then you can't do much. You can kind of provide one seamless UI. And then the second thing is that we do actually put in a lot of effort into APIs and routing systems and also terminals to allow developers to easily use the thing. So that's how we think about it. And one thing I would say is that we're also announcing Jupyter start, which is a way to, because Jupiter is the most used program, right. And probably one of the most well known things. So we are also having a really good community right now.
00:55:57.982 - 00:56:15.186, Speaker D: So we also want to kind of encourage our users to check out all these new applications and programs and defi apps and everything. So I think, in essence, I think we want to grow the pirate in a number of ways through our products, through our APIs and our programs, and also through the ecosystem stuff as well.
00:56:15.368 - 00:56:28.966, Speaker A: So if you look at what's happening on uniswap right now, right, let's just say that uniswap is your competitor on Ethereum. Let's just make that stark difference, right? Like there's uniswap and then there's Jupiter. Uniswap is.
00:56:28.988 - 00:56:30.730, Speaker C: Jupiter is a better uniswap.
00:56:33.230 - 00:56:34.826, Speaker A: Yeah, that could be a great comparison, right?
00:56:34.848 - 00:56:36.620, Speaker D: People say that. People say that. We don't.
00:56:37.150 - 00:57:05.054, Speaker A: Let's say that uniswap, the way that uniswap is launching, they launch on different L2s. So they're on arbitrum, they're on optimism, and they're focusing on retail. They just launched uniswap wallet, and now they launch Uniswap X, which is the intent based aggregator. Right. I think recently they did about a billion dollars in total trading volume since launch. And I think they launched about two months ago. So to me, what it seems like is Jupiter's biggest competition to me is uniswap.
00:57:05.054 - 00:57:26.630, Speaker A: They're taking a very different, fundamentally different approach because they're building on a different stack on Ethereum. And there's so many levels of complexity just based on our conversation today. So fast forwarding two years, where do you see this space going against uniswap? Do you ever foresee yourselves, including Ethereum assets? Are you guys ever going to compete directly, head on with Uniswap, et cetera?
00:57:26.710 - 00:57:43.358, Speaker D: First of all, I love uniswap. I think the whole Bangkok started the whole amm thing. I just want to reiterate that I really love everything Ethereum, okay? I love the research culture. I love uniswap. I love every gun. At the same time, I do think that things in Ethereum are fundamentally limited. Right.
00:57:43.358 - 00:58:10.520, Speaker D: And this is a bold statement. Okay, so let me shed a bit more. Okay. It is because the mental complexity of the transaction fees, going between our tools and doing so many things because things are expensive, it leads to a situation whereby you've really optimized for. And yes, volumes are very high, right. Everything. But you really optimize for whales, not this very big culture where we start to optimize for whales and to overcome the outputs and everything.
00:58:10.520 - 00:58:41.314, Speaker D: I think that wouldn't work because you're doing all this extra work to try to kind of overcome the fundamental problem, which is the piece to hide. So the way I think about it is actually very simple. What's actually really important is to move the user experience as close to a sex as possible. A few steps, right. Number one is how do we move the experience as close to and when. I mean experience, I don't just mean Ui, I mean liquidity, I mean spread, I mean accessibility, everything, right? And it's a very singular focus. We don't try to do 20 things.
00:58:41.314 - 00:59:00.338, Speaker D: Right. We want to have a very singular focus. How do we kind of allow the experience to move as close to ASX as possible? That's firstly right now. The secondly is how do we encourage more and more assets to come into Solana as possible. And there's a very, very simple reason why it happened. Very, very simple reason. You're going to see a lot more amms, a lot more markets, a lot more entrepreneurs.
00:59:00.338 - 00:59:19.754, Speaker D: And we are seeing that today already. They're going to create new amms and new markets on Solana. They're going to incentivize it and they're going to bridge liquidity over, at least obviously, because we don't just use our own liquidity. Right. We are able to use the liquidity across any market on Solana. To your point. I think uniswap does many, many things and many things across many chains.
00:59:19.754 - 00:59:40.046, Speaker D: Right. We are going to be a lot more focused. We are going to say, okay, you know what? We think that what's really important here is to bring in as much liquidity into Sona as possible. Right. That's firstly. Secondly, make the ease of trading across any sigma market and Shikan token as easy as possible. Right? So people go, wow, okay, this is actually better to do it.
00:59:40.046 - 01:00:03.598, Speaker D: Why am I jumping between all yao tools? Am I jumping to things? We can do it here. And thirdly is to kind of really build the entire, provide the APIs and the SDKs and everything to make it super easy to build payment use cases on how Jupiter. Right. Now, the last thing I'll say is that we are actually thinking through a multi chain system that is focused on. Right. That will make trading across different chains on Solana much easier. Right.
01:00:03.598 - 01:00:22.990, Speaker D: But that's a project for next year. That is actually how I think things go. So, in summary, what world do we want? Do we want a world whereby users is very easy for users, the cognitive low of coming to network and using is very easy. And I think that's the world. And that's the world that's super helpful.
01:00:23.070 - 01:00:29.570, Speaker A: To me, it seems like you're really going against binance and offering the entire suite of experiences. That's what it seems like.
01:00:29.640 - 01:00:41.802, Speaker D: Why not? I mean, I really feel like the space and that's why I love chow. Right. And you run. Right? Because I feel like you guys have always been on the optimistic side of, you know, I feel like there's. So say something, say something.
01:00:41.856 - 01:00:57.018, Speaker C: No, I'm just on the realistic side. When people got super bearish on Solana, I wasn't particularly optimistic. I just saw in front of my eyes, there's these builders who really believe in Solana and continue to build. And that's always the most important leading indicator.
01:00:57.114 - 01:01:47.722, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, one of the things was when Tenzer joined our batch two batches ago, probably two of the brightest engineers we've ever met. And we took them on into our batch and they've just iterated on their product. So much so that within three months, they were able to overtake Maggedgeden in terms of trading volume. And I think that goes back to the DNA that anatoly we've talked about a little bit earlier, which is like when you bring in this engineer focused or engineer first DNA into a layer, one that could enable those types of developers to be attracted to that type of ecosystem. Whereas if you look at Ethereum, it's more research focused, more experimental. And I think Chow, you mentioned two pods ago know Ethereum could be the canary chain for Solana. Not quoting you exactly, but that's headset for Solana.
01:01:47.722 - 01:02:35.210, Speaker A: Yeah. So there's some interesting elements that are playing out we're starting to see now, which is even, like, if you think about Jupiter, right, we haven't seen a Jupiter like experience on Ethereum, because what happened with Ethereum is that with Ethereum, people are starting with one product, right? So lending Ave launched a lending protocol four years ago, and now more recently, they're launching other types of markets, right? So let's say stablecoin, they launch their own stablecoin, they have their own wallet, et cetera. It's like they're more in the process of bundling throughout these years. Whereas I think with Solana, people are doing this at first, right? So, like with Jupiter launching a year or two years ago, now you have perps, now you have other products that are automatically being bundled together. So I feel like there's a lot of learnings that we've learned from Ethereum now is being instituted on Solana.
01:02:35.290 - 01:03:18.694, Speaker D: Actually, just now, you made a point earlier about our competitor being binance, right? So I feel like that's actually the right framing, right? So I really don't think of us as competing against Ethereum. I really don't, because I feel like ultimately, I feel like whatever we say, I'm very sincere about this. I think the whole point of what we are doing here is to grow the decentralized pie. Let me share with you guys why I think it's very important, okay? Now, because when liquidity is locked up in centralized venues, right, it's useless. It doesn't get used. You can't use it to use lending, you can't use it to do payment, you can't do remittances, you can't do anything, right? And it's a very big problem when you have all this. When the vast majority of capital is not used in wallets, but it's used in sexes, it's practically useless.
01:03:18.694 - 01:04:11.638, Speaker D: We don't grow the pie, we don't make things more useful, right? And then we are forever stuck in playing the trading game versus being more useful, which is actually where value is created. So I think that's actually one very important thing for us. How do we actually make the experience much better in terms of spread, Ux and everything, so that people have no reason to use a sax. And then when they have new reasons to use a sax, they use them in Jupyter, the capital becomes much more useful. They go to buy other projects, they go to use payments and everything. That's actually one of the philosophical reasons why we see the moral imperative as reprating, not representing Ethereum, not, but around like binance or any centralized exchange. The second thing that's actually really interesting is that if you think about the listing process in Nasdaq, you have all these highly fragmented, highly opaque, highly controlled listing venues.
01:04:11.638 - 01:04:54.342, Speaker D: That's really bad for innovation. What you really want is that you want some kind of framework that anyone, anywhere in Africa or some Nepal can easily go to the global funding market and say, hey, I got something, fund me, right? And then their stuff becomes funded and becomes available. Global funding market, right? And I think that's actually the whole promise of finance, right? To kind of liberate and to connect, right? So I feel like all those things can only be done in the promise of all those things. Don't get me wrong, it's actually going to be very difficult, right. To me, it's a 20 year process, right? But to me, these things are the promises of finance and decentralized system. And I think for us at Jupiter, we don't see our goal as being unison. People might say that, but we don't.
01:04:54.342 - 01:05:05.550, Speaker D: We see our goal as how do we kind of move decentralized economy forward? How do we move finance forward? How do we kind of reach a certain promise of these systems? So that's how I think about it.
01:05:05.620 - 01:05:08.640, Speaker A: Anatoly, are you happy with where Solana is today?
01:05:11.250 - 01:05:12.750, Speaker B: I'm very competitive.
01:05:16.930 - 01:05:18.480, Speaker A: So that's a. Okay.
01:05:19.170 - 01:05:19.582, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:05:19.636 - 01:05:21.262, Speaker B: Like, I like being first.
01:05:21.396 - 01:05:22.122, Speaker D: It's funny.
01:05:22.186 - 01:05:40.378, Speaker B: I mean, I don't know. I mean, I'm competitive by nature. I have like a glucose monitor and I don't want to have any spikes. I don't do it for any health reason. All my numbers are fine. It's just like once I have a number to optimize for in a leaderboard. I want to be first if I'm good at that thing.
01:05:40.378 - 01:06:24.440, Speaker B: So I don't know, I'm happy. If I step back and kind of take a breather, I am beyond happy. Right? It's insane how much everyone has accomplished and folks like Jupiter and Jito and pith and everyone else that kept building through the bear market and actually stuck with us and believed in the ecosystem and the technology, they made all of this possible. And this last year has been emotionally the hardest. But honestly, I would say this breakpoint, I felt the same kind of happiness that I felt when the first seed check hit the bank. It was all downhill from there.
01:06:24.890 - 01:06:26.360, Speaker A: That must have been the bottom.
01:06:28.250 - 01:06:36.700, Speaker D: Your message at the end of the MEV cam was so great. I don't remember what you shared at the end of. It was so great. Yeah, I really loved it.
01:06:37.230 - 01:06:58.260, Speaker B: That first c check when it hit the bank felt like, awesome. And then it was all downhill and stressful from there. And I think this breakpoint, finally seeing the ecosystem, everyone that's been building for many years really step up and take leadership and really kind of push it harder than I ever could. It's just been awesome to see.
01:06:58.630 - 01:07:02.754, Speaker A: What areas do you think Solana could improve on?
01:07:02.872 - 01:07:33.418, Speaker B: I have a list that I always publish on Twitter. Like, on the technology side that I want to see improved, it's optimizations, it's stuff that asynchronous execution. We need dynamic base fees, we need dynamic storage fees, a bunch of stuff like this. It's all coming. The number one priority is getting fire dancer out, because we need to eliminate that single point of failure. And I feel like once fire dancer is out, I can stop calling it beta, even though it's not perfect. That would be a massive milestone.
01:07:33.418 - 01:08:16.822, Speaker B: I think beyond that, we really focused on new developers and startups, like really trying to find that next Jupyter team or the next tensor team, because I believe that my experience working at a big tech company, they have innovation teams that touch all of these emerging technologies. None of them ever produce anything. It's very rare. You should still talk to them, because whenever you do, something happens, it might take off. But vast majority of innovation is going to come from organic teams that are new and will build those next big companies. So this is what we're focused on, is every hackathon, every hacker house. Most of my Zoom meetings are with new founders.
01:08:16.822 - 01:08:24.000, Speaker B: Like, hey, what are you building? Is this your first time raising? Do you need to practice your pitch, et cetera? Like stuff like this.
01:08:25.410 - 01:08:32.874, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, I think we're at time. Thank you both for joining. Any final comments to the founders that are listening?
01:08:33.002 - 01:08:52.662, Speaker B: This is the best time to start a company. The best time was a year ago. Now today is the second best time. I didn't regret it. I think even a lot of people that have started and failed have thought that they failed upwards because of the experience that you get and the people that you meet and kind of like just the whole process is awesome.
01:08:52.796 - 01:09:00.122, Speaker A: And those that are listening to our podcast for the Jupiter airdrop, any alpha for them. I hear you.
01:09:00.176 - 01:09:01.180, Speaker C: I see you.
01:09:01.870 - 01:09:18.094, Speaker D: No, just saying that I love everyone. I'm sorry if I cannot design the airdrop exactly how you want, but we try really hard. So just remember that I love you. Everyone who use Jupiter. Yeah. Whoever you are, I love you. And to everyone listening to this podcast, I just want to say that Imran and Chow are the best.
01:09:18.094 - 01:09:31.250, Speaker D: By far the best. Right? I really, really appreciate working them. They have been really amazing throughout. Like bear or bull, right? Throughout. Consistent, always there. If you can work with them, get funding from them, do it right now.
01:09:31.320 - 01:09:40.070, Speaker A: Oh, funny story I wanted to touch on was when you launched Matora, the Matora launch, you were competing with the brothers. What product did they have? What's the name of the product? Was it stable swap?
01:09:41.210 - 01:09:42.230, Speaker C: Mercurio?
01:09:43.530 - 01:09:46.854, Speaker A: It was mercurial. And it was. It sable, right?
01:09:47.052 - 01:09:47.800, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:09:48.570 - 01:10:21.234, Speaker A: And I remember within a matter of a week or two, they ten x the volume of Mercurio. And I remember being on a call with you, Ming, and you were pissed. You're like, I need to build a better product. It's the same competitiveness that anatoly just talked about about himself every single day, ming would call me and he would just like, vent, how do I win? How do I win? How do I become the best? And then one day he called me, the middle of the night, he goes, I have an idea. I'm going to build an aggregator. Look where we are now. Kudos to both of you.
01:10:21.234 - 01:10:35.094, Speaker A: One for building the engineering first ethos because that really brings in the best developers and engineers into the space. And both of you for being so competitive, because have to be competitive in this type of space to win.
01:10:35.212 - 01:10:39.118, Speaker D: Yeah. Thanks, everyone. Thank you. Yep. Take care. Thank you. Bye bye.
01:10:39.118 - 01:10:40.026, Speaker D: See you guys.
01:10:40.208 - 01:10:53.146, Speaker A: Yeah. Lots of learnings, especially with how Anatoly is thinking about scaling Solana. I thought that was a very interesting conversation, especially regarding the fees, the localized fee markets, dimensionality or whatever you want to use.
01:10:53.248 - 01:11:08.846, Speaker C: For those with econ background, you can think of fee market or localized fee market as price discrimination. So some buyers in the market, you can offer them a lower price in order to get them to use the product. So that's how I think about localized.
01:11:08.878 - 01:12:04.270, Speaker A: Fee market, or like metered, or know, like really scaling through bandwidth is another way to think about it. So essentially what I really found to be interesting is the fact that if you imagine Solana as a database, and everybody wants to write on certain areas of the database at the same time, we call that hotspots. Right? And those hotspots, you could actually create some sort of demand system pricing system, where those that are trying to write on that transaction all at the same time are charged an additional fee. And everybody wants to compete to get into that block space first. And that creates this homogeneous layer, one where the pricing can scale based on the demand. That's how they're thinking about scaling, which is very different than Ethereum, because Ethereum, everyone's competing generalized compute, right, with the same state. And so now what you do is you spin up new rollups that will enable them to compete in those localized markets.
01:12:04.270 - 01:12:06.642, Speaker A: I found that to be an interesting way to think about it.
01:12:06.696 - 01:12:07.474, Speaker C: Anything else?
01:12:07.592 - 01:12:14.550, Speaker A: I wasn't aware that most of the cross border payments that are building on Salana is using Jupiter's API. I thought that was very interesting.
01:12:14.700 - 01:13:07.138, Speaker C: I think based on what I heard, what's happening is people can use any token on Salana to pay, including USDC, Sol, or any other USC 20 equivalent on Salana, and then they would use Jupiter. Once the payment is made, the recipient basically uses Jupiter to swap the payment token into a token that the recipient prefers to hold. And by the way, this is really interesting because, Imran, I don't know if you remember back in 2017, 2018, I was debating with BTC Maxis on Twitter about what is the best form of money. And obviously, the BTC maxi argument is BTC is the best form of money. Money should be a form of medium exchange, store value and unit of exchange. And I offered something that really, really triggered. I offered an idea that really triggered them, which is that any token can be a medium of exchange.
01:13:07.234 - 01:13:07.794, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:13:07.932 - 01:13:42.254, Speaker C: And coincidentally, I think this idea probably happens more on Solana now than on Ethereum, because that last mile of swapping the medium exchange token into a store value token that the recipient wants to hold is cheaper to do on Solana. On Ethereum, you don't do it like on Ethereum. You just pay each other in USDC. You never send me, let's say, Harry Potter, Mamasonic and then I use uniswap to dump it into ETH programmatically because the swapping itself is too expensive. I might as well just hold the shitcoin and then hope a ten x's.
01:13:42.382 - 01:14:10.486, Speaker A: Well, there's another interesting element, just based on what you mentioned, which is the fee. The cost. The costs are so high, so expensive on Ethereum, that there's certain behaviors that it disallows, which it enables on Solana. So an example of this is, and this is something that we've learned through our tensor conversation, is that a lot of the NFTs that are purchased on tensor are actually from third world countries because of the fact that NFTs are so much cheaper.
01:14:10.598 - 01:14:15.498, Speaker C: Solana is the chain for the people. That is the new narrative.
01:14:15.594 - 01:14:40.902, Speaker A: And so you have that. Then you also have the ability for aggregators to take advantage and become the lead product over Amms just because of the cost. Right. The cost makes an aggregator much more effective than Amms because the routing algos are able to run much more cheaply on Solana versus, let's say, an Ethereum. So, yeah, I feel like a lot of new behavior that we're starting to see are emerging on Solana just based on the cost.
01:14:41.036 - 01:14:41.478, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:14:41.564 - 01:15:17.202, Speaker C: Another example that they mentioned is payment. Right. Payment simply by being cheaper on Solana, especially during times of high usage of the chain, when you make a payment on Ethereum and somewhere else, a big perpetual swap position is getting liquidated, the fee would be too high for you to make a payment. A payment shouldn't cost like $50 and so on Salana, by the way, with the localized fees, if there is a liquidation happening on, let's say, Jupiter's perpetual swap protocol, that liquidation wouldn't affect a USDC payment.
01:15:17.336 - 01:15:56.022, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that was really cool. Just thinking through, do you remember Black Thursday when everybody was getting liquidated on Makerdao and everyone that tried to save their loan, their CDP couldn't because there's so many people in queue. Oracle was mismatched. So the price was coming in later or there was a delay in both the oracle and people waiting to save their loan. And between the two, everyone got liquidated that was holding a CDP. I was just thinking through that moment because could that moment happen on Solana? And with this prioritized fee or dimensionality of fees, I feel like this would have been avoided. This could have been avoided.
01:15:56.166 - 01:15:56.678, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:15:56.784 - 01:16:06.110, Speaker A: So it's just interesting to see that a lot of the learnings that we're seeing on Ethereum are being solved on Solana. Is the way I see it as of right now. Any other final thoughts?
01:16:06.190 - 01:16:21.938, Speaker C: I mean, overall, the thesis about Solana is still the same, which is cheaper, faster, and there's probably a critical mass of developers in on chain activity and TBL, so that whatever happens, Solana should survive. I mean, it's already gone through the worst.
01:16:22.034 - 01:16:42.474, Speaker A: Now, what was his name? Joe from placeholder. He wrote an entire thesis on Solana and Ethereum. He called Solana the iPhone and he called Ethereum the Android. I don't think that thesis know directly. True. Right. I mean, I think he was just trying to make a point so that people could understand what this is all about.
01:16:42.474 - 01:17:17.282, Speaker A: But to me, it seems like we talked a lot about Ethereum negatively throughout the podcast. Right? But I do think there is a world for both Ethereum and Solana. It's just going to look very different in terms of the types of apps that are being built on both of those ecosystems. And I think both of them can survive and do really, really well. And specifically, he talked about how Android is more modular. There's custom Android Oss that are built by different manufacturers for phones as an example. And he made that direct example with L2s and Ethereum as an example, whereas with iPhone and Salana, it's really vertically integrated.
01:17:17.282 - 01:17:47.042, Speaker A: Right? So Salana the layer one, it also owns the scaling, it also owns the validators and other first party apps, but then also enables other founders to build on the layer one. It offers this very streamlined experience where developers can understand how to build in the ecosystem, whereas with Ethereum ecosystem you have to kind of learn the developer ecosystem, the sequencing or et cetera. There's so many different things that you have to learn, which is much more modular in nature, but it enables a whole different tool set for founders to build in.
01:17:47.096 - 01:18:03.382, Speaker C: Yeah, it feels like Ethereum, thanks to the modularity, is potentially a better place for app chains because app chains would require more customizability and less competition with other apps for on chain resources for block space.
01:18:03.516 - 01:18:04.150, Speaker D: Cool.
01:18:04.300 - 01:18:09.490, Speaker A: So I think that's all. Well, thanks for tuning in. Any final comments? Chow?
01:18:09.570 - 01:18:25.614, Speaker C: This is probably our second last podcast of the year. I really look forward to our next one, the last podcast of the year, where we're going to, I don't know, maybe go through the main events of the year and then summarize everything for you guys, talk about the main trends and maybe some of our predictions for next year.
01:18:25.652 - 01:18:34.926, Speaker A: Cool. And we also have sunny from Cosmos. That's right, osmosis. So we'd love to learn more about the cosmos appchain thesis as well?
01:18:35.028 - 01:18:40.666, Speaker C: Actually, yes. So appchain thesis on Ethereum will get tested by Cosmos?
01:18:40.778 - 01:18:41.774, Speaker D: Yep. All right.
01:18:41.812 - 01:18:44.286, Speaker A: Well, thanks for tuning in, and we'll catch you soon.
01:18:44.388 - 01:18:45.126, Speaker D: Take care.
01:18:45.268 - 01:18:47.986, Speaker A: Thanks for listening to. Good game. Don't forget to subscribe.
01:18:48.098 - 01:18:49.060, Speaker D: We'll see you next week.
