00:00:08.510 - 00:00:08.902, Speaker B: Yep.
00:00:08.998 - 00:00:21.382, Speaker A: I think even Mount Gox was unrivaled by what happened with the FTX. So I think there's a lot that we don't know for sure yet, but we can speculate on a few things.
00:00:21.478 - 00:00:45.624, Speaker B: Let's talk about what happened. Right. I just want to point out a few pointers first. What was very interesting was when FTX Alameda, when they were unwinding, the first entity or protocol they paid back was Aave and compound, which was very interesting. Right? I mean, like, we always talk about decentralized finance and how important it is to the industry, but in midst of a collapse, we're seeing Aave and compound being paid back fully.
