00:00:00.200 - 00:00:35.770, Speaker A: I think what you just said kind of translates to more than just narrative. It's ultimately, what do people want? Narrative is what people want. And we got punched in the face really, really, really hard once, like focusing only on tech and, you know, that kind of woke us up. And I think many teams out there still often focus only on, hey, I'm going to build this super fancy thing that might be practical if bitcoin does a fork. And I think people are going to love it because it's only because it's on bitcoin. And I think unless it's really hitting the narrative, as you said, and people really want to go there. So if you're building something with runes, okay, that's probably a safe, pretty good bet over the next couple of months.
00:00:35.770 - 00:01:07.996, Speaker A: But if you're building something completely new that goes against runes and you think, oh, this is going to be super cool because it's super fancy tech, BRC one so far, not because it's fancy tech, but because it's easy to use and people want something that's easy to use. And I think that applies to more than just assets. It applies to lyrics, it applies to wallets, it applies to bridges. I mean, that's a doctrine we've embraced in Bob and it has what I can say, it's like, Bob is not our first venture and. And I can say that it's zero to one if you actually listen to what people tell you and do what they ask.
