00:00:00.240 - 00:00:41.784, Speaker A: One, Rari essentially caused the downfall for Faye. Two is, you know, obviously there was huge regulatory risks. And then three, you know, the macro change in terms of market. So all the protocol control value that was worth 2 billion at the peak is worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And so, finally, if you look at, like, the way people are getting paid back, hacked victims, probably between 3% and 30% of the dollar they put in, are getting paid back. So not every hacked victim is 100% getting paid back, dollar for dollar. And so now the debate is how should Faye or tribe dao handle the shutdown of its protocol and how should they handle the community side of things?
