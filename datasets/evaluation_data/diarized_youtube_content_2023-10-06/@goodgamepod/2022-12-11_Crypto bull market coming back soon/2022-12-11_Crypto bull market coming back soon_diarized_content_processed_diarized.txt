00:00:00.240 - 00:00:31.110, Speaker A: But the silver lining is that in 2014 I said to myself after Mount Gox, I said to myself, there's no light at the end of the tunnel like this is nuclear winter. There's no way crypto is going to come back for the next five years. And yet crypto came back in 2017. And what led that? Well, obviously the 2017 bull market was, it was not pretty. It was led by Icos. But ICos were fundamentally enabled by Ethereum. Ethereum was fundamentally an innovation when it comes to programmability, layer one, programmability.
00:00:31.110 - 00:00:55.014, Speaker A: So in my opinion, that the 2017 bull market was actually led by tech innovation. The 2020 2021 bull market, in my opinion, was led by the Fed mostly. Sir Jerome. Sir Jerome. So point being, yes, it looks like, might feel like there's no light at the end of the tunnel, but if we can build real products, real innovation in this bear market, the bull market is going to come back sooner than you expect.
