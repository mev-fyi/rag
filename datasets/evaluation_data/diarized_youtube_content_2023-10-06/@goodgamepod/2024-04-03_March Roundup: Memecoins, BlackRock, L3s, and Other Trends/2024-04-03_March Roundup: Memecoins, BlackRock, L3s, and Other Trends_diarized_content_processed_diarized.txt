00:00:00.320 - 00:00:29.162, Speaker A: Welcome to good game. Your no b's insights for crypto founders. Let's fast forward ten years from now and let's say every app is built on layer three. I'm just hypothetically thinking about it and it turns out we're getting millions of users using layer three s now. But no one knows about it. Right? The pain that you and I went through is the what I call growing pains of going through this process. And as industry crypto users from the start, you and I are complaining about this shit all the time.
00:00:29.162 - 00:00:36.354, Speaker A: But if it can get to millions of users at the end of the day by layer threes, so be it. I'm trying to steal, man, this argument here.
00:00:36.514 - 00:00:38.122, Speaker B: I know you're a steel man.
00:00:38.178 - 00:00:38.754, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay.
00:00:38.834 - 00:00:44.530, Speaker B: But deep inside you're dying. Look, the amount of pain you went.
00:00:44.562 - 00:01:04.400, Speaker A: Through yourself, really, I 100% agree. But looking for your next startup idea in crypto, check out our request for startups list and get inspired at Alliance XYZ. Welcome to good game. We took a one week hiatus. Ciao. Recently had a baby boy. Congrats.
00:01:04.592 - 00:01:05.484, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:01:06.024 - 00:01:07.432, Speaker A: How are you feeling, sir?
00:01:07.608 - 00:01:18.472, Speaker B: How do I feel? Yeah, I feel I'm recovered. Last week I was stressed changing diapers all night, but this week I got four grandparents helping out.
00:01:18.568 - 00:01:24.148, Speaker A: That's amazing. Yeah, I know it's tough, but also exciting at the same time.
00:01:24.276 - 00:01:25.940, Speaker B: Healthy baby. Healthy baby.
00:01:25.972 - 00:01:26.740, Speaker A: That's good to hear.
00:01:26.852 - 00:01:30.940, Speaker B: That's the most important thing. Poops a lot, eats a lot, sleeps a lot.
00:01:31.052 - 00:01:53.500, Speaker A: It's good. On a side note or maybe switching topics here, we currently went through a rebrand. And the rebrand, I think, was a lot of time in the making. When we first launched. Good game, we launched it as a pilot, if you remember. And so we did the branding. It took us maybe, I don't know, 48 hours maximum.
00:01:53.500 - 00:02:04.224, Speaker A: We didn't put a lot of thought to it. And so the more I started looking at our pfps and our branding, the more I felt like it was too. Boomer.
00:02:05.484 - 00:02:13.684, Speaker B: I agree. Yeah. Oh, you know, after I put on this new PFP that we just created, I got like three people ask me what NFT collection that was.
00:02:13.724 - 00:02:21.164, Speaker A: Yes. Yeah, same. And I feel like we're on brand now with where crypto is at today.
00:02:22.064 - 00:02:25.488, Speaker B: And the 70 iq part of the cycle.
00:02:25.616 - 00:02:57.466, Speaker A: Yeah, I like it. So, yeah, if you have any feedback on our branding, just hit us up on our telegram chat. But a lot has happened, as usual. Blackrock recently launched their tokenized fund. There's been a lot of talks about how Ethereum is becoming the institutional chain. You put out, like, an interesting tweet that said that, well, Blackrock could launch its own l two as well. I could see a narrative for that.
00:02:57.466 - 00:02:58.594, Speaker A: For them to do that.
00:02:58.714 - 00:03:17.138, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, first of all, let's recap. What is Blackrock doing? They are doing a on chain us treasury fund. Yeah. And as of today, we can share the ether scan address. But as of today, there's $100 million. 100.
00:03:17.138 - 00:03:25.842, Speaker B: Yeah, 100 million. So nine figures. Exactly 100 million in this address. Blackrock digital asset fund.
00:03:25.938 - 00:03:28.934, Speaker A: They got $400,000 in airdrops.
00:03:37.214 - 00:03:39.294, Speaker B: Do you want to show the user scan? Do you have.
00:03:39.334 - 00:03:51.254, Speaker A: Yeah, I'll share my screen. All right, so $400,000 in airdrops, but, yeah, let's look through what Blackrock would see. They got $50,000 in Leo X token.
00:03:51.374 - 00:03:52.710, Speaker B: What the hell is this?
00:03:52.902 - 00:03:56.150, Speaker A: I have no clue. Galileo protocol.
00:03:56.342 - 00:03:57.918, Speaker B: Credo. I've heard of credo.
00:03:58.046 - 00:03:58.802, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:03:58.918 - 00:04:04.354, Speaker B: Got what it is. Okay, but there's a shina inu mog these. I know.
00:04:04.514 - 00:04:10.138, Speaker A: Shiba inu mog. Not shiba shina shina. Okay. Okay.
00:04:10.266 - 00:04:12.834, Speaker B: Paypi. $1,000 worth of paypay.
00:04:12.954 - 00:04:15.162, Speaker A: Not bad for some free advertisement.
00:04:15.298 - 00:04:15.754, Speaker B: Jesus.
00:04:15.794 - 00:04:16.290, Speaker A: Coin.
00:04:16.402 - 00:04:21.666, Speaker B: Don't know what that is. Frax. That's a real coin. That's the OG defi protocol.
00:04:21.770 - 00:04:27.134, Speaker A: Harry Potter, obamasonic. And he has. They got exactly 420.69.
00:04:31.634 - 00:04:37.014, Speaker B: So. So how do you think Larry Fink is looking at this and feeling?
00:04:37.474 - 00:05:10.154, Speaker A: He's like, I don't know, like, what the fuck are these wrong with these crypto guys? Um, Pepe Fork, Kramer coin. Pussy noodle. Oh, my God. We're not serious people. Chow. I've just realized I tried to take myself serious at times. And I realized after watching all the shit coins pump over and over again and the types of shit that pumps, I'm like, we're not serious people.
00:05:10.274 - 00:05:11.094, Speaker B: That's right.
00:05:11.594 - 00:05:13.134, Speaker A: But, yeah, that was fun to do.
00:05:13.994 - 00:05:40.470, Speaker B: But what do you think is the impact of this? Not the shit going air dropping, but Blackrock launching their tokenized fund on chain on Ethereum. I mean, because the day Blackrock announced this in conjunction with Coinbase, I saw all the RWA tokens pump, like, 50%, 100% the next day, including Ondo. Ondo is now at like $10 billion fpv. Pretty crazy.
00:05:40.582 - 00:06:15.364, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think it's very clear that Larry Fink, I had mentioned this many times, but the ability to access its product, give its access to products across the globe, is one area of opportunity right now between the KYC and other layers of friction. It's very hard for them to reach customers globally. It's primarily people that are based in the US or investment managers, et cetera. Like, one power that he'd always talked about is the ability to reach the masses. And so that was one area of opportunity he mentioned. He also mentions speed.
00:06:16.504 - 00:06:18.344, Speaker B: Larry Finks talk about this?
00:06:18.464 - 00:06:20.760, Speaker A: Yeah, well, generally about crypto.
00:06:20.872 - 00:06:21.536, Speaker B: Okay.
00:06:21.680 - 00:06:49.454, Speaker A: He talked about reach, speed, and cost reductions. Those were like the three things that he talked about. And so I do think there's been a really pretty big impact whereby we're going to start to see more products on chain, and we're going to start to see people outside of the US invest in these types of products. And we do see this from a institutional perspective. But the everyday retail person, I think, is going to be important. I mean, I think you and I talked about this, too, previously, which is, I have family in India. Right.
00:06:49.454 - 00:07:03.830, Speaker A: And you're like, oh, how do I invest in real estate in India? No, there is an ability to do that right now. Right. Unless you have, you know, many firms that you work with across the board that can do this. But being able to do this completely on chain permissionlessly, I think, is where the power is.
00:07:03.942 - 00:07:31.874, Speaker B: Yeah. Actually, Ando tweeted about this the other day. They said that there's now $1 billion of us treasuries on chain already. So a small part of that is ondo itself. So ondo has a us treasury product, and then the remaining, the ballpark, the bulk of it is from other products. I've seen centrifuge, block tower, like those guys tokenizing us treasuries on chain. But I think that's only the first part.
00:07:31.874 - 00:08:07.356, Speaker B: The first step, because in the whole world of RWas, we start with us dollar. That stablecoin is the first step. And the most natural next step is to tokenize US Treasuries is the asset that's closest to us dollar. US treasury is basically us dollar plus some interest rate. Yeah, short term interest rate. And now the question is, what is the next natural next step? What is the next asset to tokens? To me, it's us stocks and us real estate. These are some of the most high quality assets that everyone around the world, everyone outside of the US, want assets.
00:08:07.356 - 00:08:41.706, Speaker B: So our colleague, David, he was in China two months ago, and basically he did some on the ground study of what chinese consumers wanted. Like, everyone wanted us stocks, because chinese stocks have been down, only, have been down only for 15 years, while the chinese economy has been up only for 15 years. So in China, the stock market doesn't reflect the economy, whereas in the US it's the opposite. The US economy has been doing well, but not like 10% per year, whereas the US stock market has been doing 10% a year.
00:08:41.810 - 00:08:53.070, Speaker A: But isn't that a function of. Well, the chinese communities would prefer investing in real estate over stocks, whereas in the US, it stocks over real estate. Is that true?
00:08:53.202 - 00:08:54.918, Speaker B: I think there is part of that, yes.
00:08:55.046 - 00:09:28.898, Speaker A: Okay, so right now, ethereum, for the past, let's say, few years, ethereum was the go to chain to build products for crypto. Now what's happening is L2s are taking away that business, and Solana and layer one and layer ones, they're taking away that business. Now Ethereum is just kind of a chain where maybe people launch, like test products. I don't think that's true anymore. But you hardly see anyone launching on Ethereum anymore. So it's kind of a quote unquote ghost town. Even if you look at the Ethereum NFTs ghost town, like, no one's buying, no one's really selling, it's dead.
00:09:28.898 - 00:09:51.940, Speaker A: And now it's positioning itself as kind of a temporary blob space, as an example. And now we're starting to get institutions that are building or these types of tokenized funds on ETH layer one. What do you think is the future of Ethereum then? Is it just going to be used as a settlement layer and security layer and then primarily targeting institutions? I'm not sure. I'm trying to.
00:09:52.092 - 00:10:01.068, Speaker B: You remember Vitalik published a blog post like two weeks ago about where he showed an s curve of where Ethereum is on the scaling roadmap.
00:10:01.116 - 00:10:01.684, Speaker A: Yes.
00:10:01.844 - 00:10:18.530, Speaker B: And he said that we are. Ethereum is well past the middle of the s curve. Okay. Ethereum is past the hyperscaling phase. It's now in the sort of the maturing phase in terms of scaling effort. And I was somewhat disappointed to see that. Yeah.
00:10:18.530 - 00:10:44.444, Speaker B: Because what it's telling me is we're not really expecting to see much more meaningful scaling on the layer one, at least now compared to the last few years. So, you know, on the lithium layer one, the fees are continued to be very expensive. Like, I haven't used the layer one in a very long time. I tried to use it. It's like $80 to do a swap or $80 to send a transaction. Not even a swap. Swap is even more expensive.
00:10:44.554 - 00:10:45.240, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:10:45.392 - 00:10:50.048, Speaker B: So, yeah, it's just going to be a settlement layer for L2s. Yeah. From this one.
00:10:50.216 - 00:11:04.360, Speaker A: I'm disappointed too. If you ask me, I really wanted to see Ethereum compete, make more eips that are maybe even competing with L2 s. That's the type of ethereum that I wanted to see.
00:11:04.512 - 00:11:35.510, Speaker B: You remember on our episode with Mert, he said something that really struck me, which is that ethereum is making a premature optimization in the sense that ethereum hasn't reached the, hasn't explored fully the potential of the layer one and is now focusing on L2 scaling. Yeah, L2s are going to happen on Solana as well, but Solana is trying to reach the full potential of the layer one before going up the layers.
00:11:35.662 - 00:11:56.178, Speaker A: Okay, so what is the role of the layer one then? Right. If L2 is bound to happen, which we talked about on Solana and every other layer one that's out there, because there's no other way to really scale, what does that make in a layer one? Is it just going to be a layer for security and settlement? Is that the. And that's fine. Right.
00:11:56.266 - 00:12:04.360, Speaker B: And it's only for settlement. It's not even for data availability. Yeah, that's. People are using less arbitram. What's the.
00:12:04.432 - 00:12:05.096, Speaker A: Any trust.
00:12:05.200 - 00:12:11.352, Speaker B: Any trust? Yeah, any trust for data availability because data availability on their one is too expensive. Yeah.
00:12:11.448 - 00:12:30.072, Speaker A: So data is gone. I mean, you have temporary data now, but it's only good for like, you know, useless transactions. Yeah, I guess that's, that's what it is, right? I mean, even if you look at bitcoin, like people are building around the bitcoin ecosystem, what is it used for? It's just used for settlement trust.
00:12:30.208 - 00:12:38.312, Speaker B: Did we talk about proto dash harding on our last pod? Our last plug was two weeks ago. Did we actually talk about it?
00:12:38.408 - 00:12:43.512, Speaker A: We didn't go deep into it, but we've talked about this a few times in many of our episodes.
00:12:43.648 - 00:12:46.672, Speaker B: Before it happened. Right. Before it happened.
00:12:46.728 - 00:12:53.272, Speaker A: No, we didn't talk about post where we tested out the fees. I know you tweeted about this a few times.
00:12:53.408 - 00:13:01.664, Speaker B: Let's talk about the fees. Because I've been using bayesian optimism pretty much every day since, since proto dank charting went live.
00:13:04.364 - 00:13:05.744, Speaker A: What's up with these terms?
00:13:08.524 - 00:13:32.894, Speaker B: What is it stand for? Denver and Cancun. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So Cancun where proto dank sharding happened. Yeah. Which created this block space on the layer one, which helps with data availability for L2s. So the theory is L2 fees would go down dramatically. And it did.
00:13:32.894 - 00:14:14.852, Speaker B: So it did by at least one or two orders of magnitude, depending on the chain. Not every L2 activated at the same time. But you can look at the chart of the fees across various L2s. You can see very clearly when the L2 activated, proto dank charting and depend on the chain went down one or two orders of magnitude. Very impressive. So I've been using bayesian optimism every day for the last couple of weeks, and what I experienced was in line with the data. However, there's one thing that I noticed that wasn't reflected in the data, which is that the variance in the fees was very high on base, for example.
00:14:14.852 - 00:14:25.884, Speaker B: So on some days, I make a swap, it's three cents, two cents, which is in line with Solana, for example. On other days, it can go to $8 when the chain is really congested.
00:14:26.004 - 00:14:26.556, Speaker A: That makes sense.
00:14:26.620 - 00:14:29.544, Speaker B: I never see that Solana is always one or two cent.
00:14:29.844 - 00:14:37.172, Speaker A: Well, it makes sense. Why? Because, you know, Ethereum is a shared blob space, right, where people, all the L2 share that.
00:14:37.308 - 00:14:37.908, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:14:38.036 - 00:14:45.074, Speaker A: So depending on what L2 uses it the most, they have to kind of, like, compete for that space and time. Right, and cost.
00:14:45.774 - 00:15:20.162, Speaker B: What you said is correct in theory, but empirically, that's not what's happening right now. The block space is not the bottleneck empirically. The bottleneck right now is the execution of the L2s. Okay, so that is the difference between single threaded and parallel execution. Okay, so, yeah, L2s, like Bayes and optimism, they're not using parallel execution, and that's where the bottleneck is today. So base transactions, base TPS went up by an order of magnitude since then, Kun. But that creates a lot of load on the execution environment.
00:15:20.338 - 00:15:41.198, Speaker A: So for those that are trying to understand single threaded and parallel threaded or dual threaded, essentially what it means is you're waiting for one sequence of transactions to complete and your transactions waiting in line to be executed, whereas with parallel execution, you have two lanes where you can execute transactions. So if. Yeah, so that's pretty much at high level.
00:15:41.326 - 00:16:26.554, Speaker B: And we go something into a context which is very important, which is, I see a lot of misinformation on Twitter from the debates between the ETH maxis and the solmaxis, which is that, yes, on average, the base fees and optimism fees and arbitrage fees are on par with the Solana fees. That is true. But there's several big caveats. One is, as I said, the variance is very high on bayes and optimism. And this is from just me using the products. That's number one. Number two, and this is going to suck for all the ETH maxis listening to this, which is that the total number of TPS combined across all the L2s today is one order of magnitude lower than Solana.
00:16:26.554 - 00:16:50.914, Speaker B: Like, think about it, Solana processes one to 2000 transactions per second. The best, the most, the busiest. Ethereum L2 processes ten to 20. There's maybe like ten of them that really matter. So together they process maybe 100 tps. All the ethereum L2 together, 100 tps, that's one order of magnitude lower than slot. And that's number two.
00:16:50.914 - 00:17:12.738, Speaker B: Yeah, number three. Yes. Ethereum layer one is more decentralized than Solana, but the Ethereum L2s are nowhere near the level of decentralization. As Solana, they use single sequencer, single sequencer number one and two. The proofs are not permissionless. Today, only arbitrum is stage two. Layer two.
00:17:12.738 - 00:17:21.714, Speaker B: If you look at l, two beats stage one, sorry, stage one, not stage one, arbitrage one is stage one, L2, decentralization.
00:17:23.174 - 00:17:24.766, Speaker A: Everyone else is at stage zero.
00:17:24.910 - 00:17:26.302, Speaker B: Exactly. Yeah.
00:17:26.438 - 00:17:50.534, Speaker A: So, and remember, the more decentralization you add, the more latency you add. So, like, if you were to decentralize a sequencer set, what do you think is going to happen? Yeah, you know, I'm sure there could be ways to work around it, but typically when you decentralize, because right now you have a single sequencer, right? And if you have, if you decentralize sequencer set, then you have a few sequencers, you have to coordinate and figure out what transactions you want to publish on the blockchain.
00:17:50.614 - 00:18:23.456, Speaker B: The conclusion I have really, is that purely from a tech point of view, Ethereum is really behind. Solana is actually ten x behind. And this is something that I think a lot of ETH maxes don't want to admit. Look, ETH is still ahead of Solana in terms of developer Mont share, in terms of TVL, in terms of liquidity, in terms of probably, actually Ethereum is behind it in user account already. It's ahead in all these things that I just mentioned. But pure tech wise, Ethereum is behind. And trading volume on Defi.
00:18:23.456 - 00:18:25.984, Speaker B: Solana is already on par with Ethereum.
00:18:26.104 - 00:18:58.658, Speaker A: Okay, so there's obviously first movers advantage with Ethereum. Ethereum kind of architected the smart contract space. And so they have mind share, they have developer share, you know, incredible ecosystem and a way like before they, before they went from sharding to like L2s, you know, there was a big debate whether sharding or L2s would be the right approach. They decided L2s, they allow others to commercialize the, the next layer up, that would enable more apps to be built. And it turns out even that has a threshold. Right.
00:18:58.706 - 00:18:59.282, Speaker B: Of price.
00:18:59.378 - 00:19:11.188, Speaker A: Right. I mean, even with L2s, it seems to me that it's not as competitive with, uh, salon in terms of fees. Right. It's there, but it's not all the way there. Uh, and now what we're seeing is layer threes.
00:19:11.276 - 00:19:12.024, Speaker B: Um.
00:19:12.524 - 00:19:15.372, Speaker A: Uh, yeah, I know it's on our.
00:19:15.388 - 00:19:19.532, Speaker B: Last thought, I was like, I'm not going to talk about lyrics, I'm not going to talk about layer threes, but.
00:19:19.588 - 00:19:23.824, Speaker A: Well, with DJ hitting $2 billion, I think we might have to talk about it.
00:19:24.484 - 00:19:34.582, Speaker B: That's right. Um, so Djen just went up. DJ and the token just went up 100 x. Yeah. To $2 billion in market cap.
00:19:34.758 - 00:19:35.514, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:19:36.134 - 00:19:42.582, Speaker B: Do you want to talk about it? Do you want to talk about the. What is Degen and what happened? All that stuff?
00:19:42.718 - 00:20:11.110, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, Degen has been around. It was one of the first communities on forecaster to tokenize. And we talked about this in our Dan Romero's podcast, if you remember. And towards the end of the conversation, you and I said, you know, we could see a world where channels could launch their own tokens and kind of bootstrap from there. And it actually turned out it was true. Not only that, but it became kind of the go to market strategy to grow the forecaster community as well.
00:20:11.262 - 00:20:13.054, Speaker B: There was a degeneration channel. Right?
00:20:13.174 - 00:20:14.566, Speaker A: There was a DJ on channel.
00:20:14.710 - 00:20:21.350, Speaker B: And you launched like in December, I believe. Yeah, the channel and the token launch. Yeah.
00:20:21.422 - 00:20:25.104, Speaker A: Somewhere in the early days of Forecaster forgot what month it was.
00:20:25.264 - 00:20:26.084, Speaker B: Okay.
00:20:27.264 - 00:20:56.784, Speaker A: But there was, if you remember, the Farcaster community launched points first and points, I think they were still trying to figure it out of what these tokens, like, how they would launch these tokens, the community, the whole nine yards. But the idea was to foster some sort of engagement to bring more users and community more people to together in the forecast. So points, I remember that because, you know, I saw that and I thought was pretty on brand with kind of like the base for our caster community.
00:20:56.944 - 00:20:57.684, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:20:58.344 - 00:21:04.352, Speaker A: Then we saw Degen, and Degen just kept. The price kept going up.
00:21:04.448 - 00:21:26.784, Speaker B: Yeah. So in December. So I've been using forecaster for like. Yeah, more than half a year, like consistently. And in December, I remember seeing like, whenever I cast something on forecaster, sometimes I get a tip in the form of Djang, like 200 Degen, 300 djang, that kind of stuff. I didn't know what it was. I sort of knew that it was some kind of tipping.
00:21:26.784 - 00:21:56.814, Speaker B: But when I tried to claim it, the Degen token didn't exist. It wasn't a real token. It was like some points in a centralized database. But later that thing did become a real token that was on chain, and that is the Degen token today that just went to like $2 billion. I still haven't claimed my tokens yet, but it's probably worth a lot. Now I can just non stop casting and receiving some tips. So that was the first utility of the Djen token.
00:21:56.814 - 00:22:23.688, Speaker B: So Djen token is, it started off as a meme coin, I suppose, but people started using the token to tip each other. That was the first utility for this token. Very similar to bunk, by the way. Bunk started as ecosystem. They build like bonk bot and that kind of stuff. So that's sort of the high level of the Degen token. But this week they also launched a layer three.
00:22:23.856 - 00:23:08.676, Speaker A: Yeah, so there's a company called Syndicate. They provide like infrastructure tooling for developers. And they got together with arbitrum base and decent, which is the descent and conduit. And they ended up building this kind of like out of the box letter three. Decent. They're a bridge, okay? They just provide bridges. And between kind of that stack, they were able to build a integrated mini roll up or a layer three, whereby that roll up uses base as a settlement layer and you know, and arbitram, any trust as a DA layer and decent as a bridging layer.
00:23:08.676 - 00:23:17.444, Speaker A: And the native token for this layer three is Degen also. So that was one of the you.
00:23:17.484 - 00:23:20.036, Speaker B: Pay gas using Degen token.
00:23:20.100 - 00:23:29.820, Speaker A: That's right. And then you also have Dracula, which is a social app that uses Djen as a payment layer for that.
00:23:29.972 - 00:23:42.244, Speaker B: So there's even more. There's two more sources of utility for the token. Now. One is as gas token for the layer three, and then Dracula using it as payment. There's probably more.
00:23:42.364 - 00:23:43.204, Speaker A: There's probably more.
00:23:43.284 - 00:23:44.220, Speaker B: There's probably more.
00:23:44.332 - 00:24:00.248, Speaker A: Yeah. But this is kind of interesting, right? You know, using a token as a way to bootstrap. If you look at Forecaster, the way it started was just purely people coming together under one topic. Degen. There's other channels that are out there like MFR. Right. Which we can talk about.
00:24:00.248 - 00:24:31.564, Speaker A: They launched a token too, and others, and we'll talk through all of that, but just people getting together and they believe in a certain topic, and they started to airdrop these tokens, use these tokens to tip each other. And that kind of got mind share. And from that mind share. They used it as a way to help bootstrap an app called Dracula. And then they used it as a way to launch its own layer three. And now there's apps that are, quote unquote, being built on Degen layer three. And we'll see where it goes from there.
00:24:31.564 - 00:24:33.676, Speaker A: But it's an interesting bootstrapping mechanism.
00:24:33.780 - 00:24:38.372, Speaker B: Did you use the product, the DJN layer three, swapping and sending?
00:24:38.428 - 00:24:38.908, Speaker A: No.
00:24:39.036 - 00:24:39.548, Speaker B: Okay.
00:24:39.636 - 00:24:54.022, Speaker A: I put it tweet out because I saw a lot. I'm in a bunch of telegram chats and a lot of people got rugged. It was same as bald. I mean, bass, if you remember every L2, layer three, the first thing that happens is that you get rugged. Right. It's like the.
00:24:54.078 - 00:24:54.462, Speaker B: Right.
00:24:54.558 - 00:25:00.838, Speaker A: The pathway. You have to get indoctrinated. Right. And so I'm like, fuck this. I've been through this way too many times.
00:25:00.966 - 00:25:02.234, Speaker B: I'm just gonna wait.
00:25:03.694 - 00:25:16.610, Speaker A: And. But, yeah, people ended up getting almost every token rugged. And there's a couple that are pretty decent. I think one that Ansem talked about was Harold, but besides the point, I haven't bridged there yet.
00:25:16.722 - 00:25:17.338, Speaker B: Okay.
00:25:17.466 - 00:25:18.254, Speaker A: Have you?
00:25:18.634 - 00:25:49.992, Speaker B: I did. Look, when I first heard the term layer three, I was extremely annoyed. I'm just annoyed by the constant creation of new jargons. But I said to myself, okay, I'm going to keep an open mind. I'm going to try this and feel the magic or the pain as a user. So I used the product, I bridged some tokens to dj three on their official website, did some swaps on Django swap, and then sent some tokens. What's the cost? The cost was basically zero.
00:25:49.992 - 00:26:02.760, Speaker B: And by zero, I don't mean one cent, I mean like 100th of a cent. So basically the fees went from. So base, base L2. The fees on base L2 is like one, two. $0.03 on a good day.
00:26:02.872 - 00:26:03.504, Speaker A: Right.
00:26:03.664 - 00:26:25.402, Speaker B: And with a layer three, basically, you remove 99% of that. You reduce the layer 2ft by 99%, if not more, so it's basically free. That was the positive, the negative was the double bridge. You have to bridge not only once, but twice. Yeah. So with the L2, you bridge first to the L2, you're done. Layer two and then to the layer three.
00:26:25.498 - 00:26:27.174, Speaker A: Arbitrum solved this, by the way.
00:26:28.074 - 00:26:30.210, Speaker B: They're trying to solve it. They just solved.
00:26:30.242 - 00:26:37.244, Speaker A: I think they just solved it. Or they're planning to launch a product very soon. But the idea is to bridge directly from l one to l three.
00:26:37.904 - 00:26:43.512, Speaker B: But the thing is bridging from layer one is extremely expensive. It's like $80 or something.
00:26:43.568 - 00:26:47.564, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean that's for existing users, but for new users that are coming.
00:26:50.224 - 00:27:00.652, Speaker B: They go directly from Coinbase or another centralized exchange to the L2. But currently there's no support to go from centralized exchange directly to layer three.
00:27:00.768 - 00:27:06.404, Speaker A: But you think, I mean that has, that will obviously change, right? I mean with Coinbase supporting base and Degen.
00:27:06.444 - 00:27:21.788, Speaker B: Right. You know, I thought about this, I said to myself, okay, this is going to change, but if you really think about it, is it really going to change? Because there's going to be gazillion L2s and layer threes. Like put yourself in the shoes of Coinbase. They can't support all those.
00:27:21.956 - 00:27:22.612, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:27:22.748 - 00:27:30.816, Speaker B: How are they going to design the UX in such a way that shows like 500 different L2s and layer threes on the UI's just for the withdrawal process?
00:27:31.000 - 00:27:33.024, Speaker A: Well you could probably solve this through a wallet.
00:27:33.144 - 00:27:37.496, Speaker B: No, well that's what I meant. Like. Yeah, like how do you design the UI?
00:27:37.680 - 00:28:04.820, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean if we're having shitposting here and talking openly, I think wallet is one way. And then, you know, for any app you login, it automatically resorts to RPC node, right. So like it auto detects the app that you're using and it automatically changes everything in the background and moves your capital based on what app you're using as an example. And then Coinbase on the backend or base on the back end will manage the settlement themselves.
00:28:04.972 - 00:28:09.464, Speaker B: But the starting point is Coinbase centralized your account.
00:28:10.564 - 00:28:59.254, Speaker A: Well I'm sure you saw this but Coinbase is talking a lot about their smart account wallet. Why is Coinbase's smart wallet interesting? Well, it does a few things. One is it obviously solves the UX problem. One, two is automatically connects to your Coinbase account, bank account or credit card and it lets you spend it on chain instantaneously. And then theres a couple other anecdotes but the idea is essentially the on ramping goes directly on chain, which I think is the biggest problem. Right. So if youre using, I dont know, lets say arbitrum on Coinbase wallet, you could automatically have your money withdrawn directly to your arbitrum address and you could do that with, let's say if you're using Coinbase wallet and you're using degen layer three, then you could automatically withdraw or to your capital to a layer three.
00:28:59.374 - 00:29:14.142, Speaker B: Let's assume there is a solution. There is a nice solution, but the point is it creates more work for exchanges, for wallets to support this new thing that is layer three. If everything was on one layer, there's no additional work.
00:29:14.278 - 00:29:36.430, Speaker A: The users don't care. Right. Okay, here's a perfect example. Right? When the layer three launched, decent launch three days ago, everybody on Twitter was like, oh, yeah, I'm going to get the next meme coin I'm going to buy. Like, they just, they just yolo it in, right? And, you know, I guess to me it's, you know, people are going to go, if there's money to be made, they're going to go there. They don't care.
00:29:36.582 - 00:29:43.066, Speaker B: I 100% agree. There's money. People will go there. It is really, really painful. It is an extra layer of friction.
00:29:43.090 - 00:29:45.210, Speaker A: Oh, it is? Yeah. I mean, but.
00:29:45.362 - 00:29:52.426, Speaker B: And for developers. Let me read this tweet from seraphim, the BD guy at athena.
00:29:52.570 - 00:29:53.522, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, yeah.
00:29:53.618 - 00:30:19.158, Speaker B: Okay. Read this. Like, this is exactly what I've been talking, talking about on Twitter for months. So he said 80% of my work now is working around technical challenges of getting on L2 s. It involves coordinating with devs on shards, oracles, bridging. Fucking pain. It's almost like it would be better if all the ETH L2 s were just one chain, like Solana.
00:30:19.158 - 00:30:31.254, Speaker B: Like, this whole fragmentation and complexity creates not just more friction for users, but also for developers. That's the point I've been beating the drum on for months.
00:30:31.414 - 00:30:33.448, Speaker A: But can this be solved through a wallet?
00:30:33.566 - 00:30:44.364, Speaker B: No. Again, it can be solved. There is a solution, but it's more work. It's more pain for people, for developers and users. It can be solved, but it's more work.
00:30:44.484 - 00:31:08.004, Speaker A: Yeah, we'll have to see how it plays out. Sometimes I feel like where we are is we're going from. It's like an Overton window, right? Slowly but surely. We started with where all layer one, all the transactions are on layer one. Then we had to go through research and figure out, okay, well, maybe L2s are the right components. So then we go with that. It turns out we might have to go a step further and go layer threes.
00:31:08.004 - 00:31:33.680, Speaker A: But, like, if you go, like, let's fast forward ten years from now and let's say every app is built on layer three, I'm just hypothetically thinking about it, and it turns out we're getting millions of users using layer threes now, but no one knows about it. Right. The pain that you and I went through, right. Is the learning. Like, it's the. The what I call growing pains of going through this process. And as industry crypto users from the start.
00:31:33.680 - 00:31:44.568, Speaker A: You and I are complaining about this shit all the time, but if it can get to millions of users at the end of the day by layer threes, so be it. I guess that's what I'm trying to steel man, this argument here.
00:31:44.736 - 00:31:46.312, Speaker B: I know you're a steel man.
00:31:46.368 - 00:31:46.536, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:31:46.560 - 00:31:57.406, Speaker B: Okay. But deep down, you're. Deep inside, you're dying. The amount of pain you went through yourself, I 100% agree. But.
00:31:57.550 - 00:32:13.754, Speaker A: But, like, what if you and I aren't really that, you know, it doesn't matter. I mean, layer threes happen with whether we like it or not. And turns out developers find it easiest way to compete against Solana and they want to stay EVM aligned. And that gives them millions of users at the end of day. Does it?
00:32:14.054 - 00:32:14.470, Speaker B: I guess.
00:32:14.502 - 00:32:34.542, Speaker A: Where are we in this, like, window? Right. I'm trying to construct this ourselves myself, just so that I can still mend my arguments and see if there is a way where layer three is, as much as I hate it today, could actually be the thing that makes EVM Ethereum competitive against Solana. Yeah, I don't know, but I think it's solvable.
00:32:34.678 - 00:32:35.278, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:32:35.406 - 00:33:00.514, Speaker A: So layer three, Dgen, there's Djen. There's another company called Senko. Like, I've talked about this in Kyle Simani's podcast, but Senko TV Corp is a. Is a casino games streaming frontech on Arbitrum. So they do a bunch of different things. But they also announced a while ago that they were launching in layer three. And so that's two.
00:33:00.514 - 00:33:40.242, Speaker A: There's a company called Xi that is, I think, Sobeys company. He's an NFT influencer, but he is building mini roll ups for games as well. So it seems to me that that is where the narrative is going next. Layer threes, and Senkou and Xi and others are probably going to follow suit with Djen, I think, in terms of price, action. And we're also starting to see some interesting things. Layer threes can be any vm. So I've seen some people talk about doing a SVM layer three.
00:33:40.242 - 00:33:43.854, Speaker A: That settles on base with any trust. Da.
00:33:44.314 - 00:33:50.362, Speaker B: But L2 can also support that with. What's it called again? Eclipse.
00:33:50.538 - 00:34:04.970, Speaker A: Yeah, but it's commoditizing the vms with layer threes. Right. So anyone can build a layer three with any virtual machine. And so you could get the power of Solana as a layer three.
00:34:05.162 - 00:34:08.356, Speaker B: I'm just slowly dying inside.
00:34:08.500 - 00:34:30.204, Speaker A: I get it. I'm dying too. But it could be that it's that one final point where we're dying, where it actually takes off, which is why I'm still manning this argument, because I do think that as much as we hate layer threes and like, look, people hate it, it's just like, oh, not another roll up, right?
00:34:30.324 - 00:34:35.910, Speaker B: Oh, you know, it's not, it's not even consensus among the Ethereum community. Like there was.
00:34:35.982 - 00:34:37.434, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm sure they're pissed, too.
00:34:38.214 - 00:34:41.990, Speaker B: Well, polygon. Polygon. Polygons.
00:34:42.022 - 00:35:03.512, Speaker A: Oh, yeah. Because look, Polygon has its own infrastructure, right? They're, they're building out cdks, right? ZK, VM cdks with their own ag layer that provides asynchronous composability. So they have a whole different stack that they're, they're building. And the stack that, that everyone else is talking about, the layer threes, is outside of the polygon ecosystem.
00:35:03.648 - 00:35:16.896, Speaker B: Yeah. You know, I'm just, I'm just kicking myself for fading. Djam. Yeah. I talked about this thesis about bay. Like, I've been bullish on base for almost a year now. Yes, I remember last year.
00:35:16.896 - 00:35:38.752, Speaker B: I've been bullish on base the whole time. And at some point I said, because base is not going to launch a token, I was like, the best index bet on base is probably going to be a. Yes. The mascot of bass. And originally you and I both thought it was going to be bald. And it was a. I wish it was bald.
00:35:38.808 - 00:35:40.152, Speaker A: It's such a good meme.
00:35:40.288 - 00:35:51.240, Speaker B: And later I just, I mid curved on. Well, I didn't, it wasn't really me curving, but I thought it was going to be the catcoin. What is it called again? Tochi. That one did really well. It did okay.
00:35:51.312 - 00:35:53.412, Speaker A: It did okay. It's only 200 million market cap.
00:35:53.568 - 00:36:01.984, Speaker B: That one did okay. But it's very clear in hindsight that the shelling point for base is degen. And I faded it.
00:36:02.764 - 00:36:33.374, Speaker A: It's okay. We can't win all of it, but there are others. So, you know, personally, I think if you want to catch a layer three train, then I think there are other layer three star launching that could give you similar exposure. Probably not as explosive as Degen, because Degen already has a very strong community. But there are some ways to capture that opportunity, I think. But we're seeing a lot of meme coins launch on base now. Right.
00:36:33.374 - 00:37:01.816, Speaker A: I put a tweet out that talked about the quality of meme coins. The more of a cesspool it is, the more retail adoption there is. I'm starting to see that on base now. Not as extensive as Solana. But I'm starting to see more meme coins going for the billion dollar mark. There's a token called Bret on base that did 700 million in market cap MFR. We talked about that.
00:37:01.816 - 00:37:12.764, Speaker A: Oh, we didn't talk about that and we should talk about this. But there's a token called MfER that probably like 2200 million FTV 100 6160.
00:37:13.244 - 00:37:31.540, Speaker B: You know, in general, I'm surprised that there was one or two days in the past week where half of the front page of Dex screener was base coins. Yeah. It used to be dominated, entirely dominated by Solana, but now it's 50% base, 50% Solana.
00:37:31.692 - 00:37:48.432, Speaker A: So then the question is, could Solana and base be the retail chain? Could there be two retail chains? Base, Solana, base, obviously, with Coinbase, 75 million registered users retail, that's one still on it for the rest of the world. I could see that. I could see that argument.
00:37:48.528 - 00:38:13.236, Speaker B: The advantage that Bayes has is the distribution from Coinbase. The users. Users just get funneled to Bayes directly from Coinbase because they pay zero fee for bridging to Bayes. They do pay a on chain gas fee for bridging to other chains. So that's distribution. That's the advantage for base. The disadvantage is the fees, actually, it's still always going to be the fees.
00:38:13.236 - 00:38:28.860, Speaker B: So the base fees are on average on par with Solana, but with a huge bearings. Huge, huge bearing. Yes. That's not user friendly. I'm sure they have some upcoming improvement for that. But at the moment, Solana is ahead.
00:38:29.012 - 00:38:41.350, Speaker A: Yeah, I also, you know, having used both base and Solana, just swapping and the slippage is. It's painful, man. It's just insanely painful.
00:38:41.462 - 00:38:42.638, Speaker B: Painful where? On base.
00:38:42.686 - 00:38:43.646, Speaker A: On base.
00:38:43.830 - 00:38:46.398, Speaker B: But that can be solved. That's with.
00:38:46.446 - 00:38:48.382, Speaker A: Well, it can be through liquidity.
00:38:48.478 - 00:38:49.166, Speaker B: Right.
00:38:49.350 - 00:38:56.514, Speaker A: But what I like about Solana is Jupiter. Right. With the DCA function.
00:38:56.854 - 00:39:04.296, Speaker B: I'm so surprised there's no ethereum Dex that supports DCA or major Dexs, at least cowswap does.
00:39:04.360 - 00:39:30.284, Speaker A: But, you know, you have to, like, deposit assets into a gasless environment and then enables its own. Because the problem is that you have to go in an ERC or like a 4337 environment, construction environment to do this. Yeah. Otherwise it's painful. So, yeah, I agree with you. Like, if there was a way where I can just lock some funds into smart contract. The smart contract can execute the transactions on my behalf.
00:39:30.284 - 00:39:34.796, Speaker A: Would be amazing. But, yeah. Did you see the. Or do you have something you can bring it up?
00:39:34.900 - 00:39:47.384, Speaker B: No, I'm just looking at the other big news. There was a munchables hack. Oh, yeah. Munchables against North Korea. Yep.
00:39:48.124 - 00:40:12.192, Speaker A: But I think they debunked that. I don't know if it's really North Korea. Um, I don't know exactly what happened, but I saw some tweets, uh, of somehow they uncovered the anon that that did the hack, and I think they pretty much made an offer that he couldn't, he or she couldn't refuse. Meaning, like, reporting it to the authorities if you don't give us the money. Okay, so that's how they got the money back from.
00:40:12.248 - 00:40:13.504, Speaker B: And it wasn't North Korea.
00:40:13.624 - 00:40:29.766, Speaker A: Was in North Korea. So, um, that was, uh, one, two days of where all the. Everyone came out, started shitting on blast, of course, and then now Pac man is a hero. Don't you love these story arcs?
00:40:29.910 - 00:40:32.782, Speaker B: There's a forecaster $1 billion valuation.
00:40:32.958 - 00:40:42.310, Speaker A: Yeah, pretty. Yeah, I mean, like, you're comping against. Well, the comp is probably Twitter, right? Elon sale for 44 billion. So is it.
00:40:42.342 - 00:40:59.754, Speaker B: By the way, isn't that bearish for the. Because Djen is sort of the index bet on forecaster base. Like, do you see Degen as the. As an index bet on forecaster or the index bet on base, or a little bit of both. Both. Okay, so if launches a token. Go ahead.
00:40:59.794 - 00:41:02.614, Speaker A: And social so far, Caster, social. Right?
00:41:03.914 - 00:41:14.460, Speaker B: Wouldn't. Wouldn't. Forecaster launching a token? Oh, first of all, I don't know if Forecaster is going to launch a token, but if they do, that would take a little bit of premium away from Degen, right?
00:41:14.532 - 00:41:52.632, Speaker A: Well, yeah, it's definitely going to take a premium away, but maybe the idea here is that the layer three would have its own ecosystem. I also question, how many times can you replicate an ecosystem on a different chain? On base, you have uniswap, you have the liquidity, you have the bridging, et cetera. You have all of these core components that makes, like, you can stay on base and not have to worry. But if you go through another layer three, the liquidity aspect of it is kind of annoying. So I'm curious to see how that builds on its own and how much liquidity it can grab from retail.
00:41:52.808 - 00:42:03.436, Speaker B: What do you think of Imad Mostake's fall at stability AI and his pivot to decentralized AI? Anyway.
00:42:03.460 - 00:42:31.784, Speaker A: All right, all right. So, you know, I've talked to Ahmad back in 2019. Smart guy. You know, I don't know him personally. Like, I don't know him as a friend or anything like that. I just talked to him a few times and we riffed on a few ideas in crypto. Then I saw him on the news with stability AI and doing really well, and I've noticed a lot of news that spoke negatively about him as well.
00:42:31.784 - 00:43:00.884, Speaker A: There were people that worked at stability AI that talked about how emad mismanaged money employees, this future of where stability was going. Recently, he announced that he was stepping down from stability AI and he was going to focus his efforts on decentralized AI. The entire crypto community was, they were ecstatic, welcoming someone that is going to pump their bags, so to speak.
00:43:03.784 - 00:43:17.752, Speaker B: He wrote a proposal for render protocol. I didn't go into the details. I thought he was. Well, I read it, but I didn't understand anything. It was a lot of fluff in my opinion. But yes, the render back holders must be very happy.
00:43:17.848 - 00:43:45.348, Speaker A: Look, I mean, I'm bullish over time with decentralized AI. I just think we're pretty early. But I do worry about one thing, which is, I don't know the details of whether or not what Emad did is true or not, but it seems to me that the reporting that came out from like fortune and other reputable firms backed it with very specific data points, to the point where they counted how many people they interviewed to get the data points, and it was 30.
00:43:45.476 - 00:43:47.144, Speaker B: With 30, would you get what data points?
00:43:47.954 - 00:43:53.694, Speaker A: The data points about how the capital was mismanaged, how stability AI is burning money.
00:43:55.394 - 00:44:02.314, Speaker B: Also, they interviewed the journalists, inter 30 employees. Yes. That's stability. Yeah. Yes.
00:44:02.474 - 00:44:31.934, Speaker A: And it turns out from that article that it was, he was being negligent, period, to the point where the investors, investors like Lightspeed, asked him to resign and he wouldn't resign. But then we saw this tweet that he left to start to get into decentralized AI. To me, as a person that's cynical, sees this as a cash grab opportunity to get rid of reputation out of one sector and restart with the new sector. And this could be a starting of a new main character.
00:44:32.094 - 00:44:51.218, Speaker B: You know what that reminded me of? I was talking to one of our founders, who is, among other things, very deep in AI and very deep in decentralized AI. And he told me something to the effect of no serious AI person would ever do a startup in crypto.
00:44:51.346 - 00:45:16.566, Speaker A: Well, the thing is, like, there's still so much opportunity in the AI, right? Like, why would you go and mesh two things right away? I feel like if you are a. An AI, like if you're deep into AI, your entire work as an AI, you want to continue exploring that, right? And then I think those that are maybe more crypto native will want to explore these types of intersections of crypto and AI. I don't know.
00:45:16.710 - 00:45:44.092, Speaker B: I've been dunking on AI crypto for the last couple of months. I thought it was my duty to do it. But you remember a year ago we actually did a podcast on decentralized AI. I also went on bank list to talk about decentralized AI. The whole idea does make sense to me. Yeah, but what's happening today is it's so easy to raise money. The valuations are being pushed to ridiculous levels easily.
00:45:44.092 - 00:46:10.106, Speaker B: Billion dollar valuation without a product. VC's are fomoing into the sector, which in turn attracts a lot of opportunists, mercenary founders, 100%. And again, I wanted to keep an open mind, so I tried a bunch of products. I put together a list of top, quote unquote top decentralized AI products. I tried all of them, and guess what? Most of them didn't even work.
00:46:10.290 - 00:46:11.682, Speaker A: Can you name any names?
00:46:11.818 - 00:46:20.954, Speaker B: I'm not going to name names, but it takes five minutes to try the product and you'll see what I'm talking about.
00:46:21.074 - 00:46:53.768, Speaker A: You should see the pitches that I'm getting, that we're getting, and they're getting funded. That's the scary part, seeing people that aren't AI experts, that are more, I don't know, maybe crypto natives or, you know, not even crypto that are coming in, they're raising money for things that don't really make sense in AI, in crypto. So, like, one that I saw was, I don't know, intent based AI infrastructure or something to that extent. AI payments for AI commence for intent.
00:46:53.816 - 00:46:56.176, Speaker B: Modular restaking, L2.
00:46:56.280 - 00:47:14.664, Speaker A: Yes, I mean, I'm even having a hard time saying this is where I'm at because I can't think of the amount of things that are coming within one sentence. But, yeah, so I guess this space is very frothy and I do believe in decentralized AI, but I just think we're way ahead of the curve here.
00:47:14.824 - 00:47:59.324, Speaker B: Look, this space is very interesting, but by default I currently just view everything as at best a proof of concept, at worst a total scam. And out of all these teams and products, of course there's always going to be good, well intentioned founders building real products. And we made a few investments, like three investments last year, really good teams, and we're going to make another one soon. All of this, there's still some really good gems there are overall, like, for people who are interested in the space, for those who are looking at the coins and trying to decide whether or not to buy the coins just by default, assume that the coins are meme coins at best.
00:47:59.444 - 00:48:14.232, Speaker A: You know, this is why I like meme coins, I think you put a tweet out, which was something that I was already thinking about, which is you're taking away capital from scammers and you're giving it to. Well, I don't know. All right.
00:48:14.232 - 00:48:16.044, Speaker B: Me, you're at least giving it to.
00:48:17.664 - 00:48:35.004, Speaker A: You're giving it to a meme coin. Right. Like the capital is being siphoned off from scammers or opportunistic people. To meme coins. To me, that feels more like it's kind of balancing out the ecosystem. Right. Which is the retail.
00:48:35.784 - 00:48:37.728, Speaker B: There is a bifurcation, the market bifurcation.
00:48:37.776 - 00:48:38.168, Speaker A: Yes.
00:48:38.256 - 00:49:34.994, Speaker B: Right now, which is with the advent of meme coins, the market is now bifurcated into the meme coin submarket and the serious coin submarket. And the players in these two submarkets are very different. So the serious coin market is basically the VC's and the quote, unquote serious people, the high brow, you know, ivory tower people that play the series points, the retail, they're fed up with this. They're fed up with the low market cap, high FDB, kind of huge supply overhang. They're done with this, and they're done with all these buzzwordy, new trendy like projects. Right? Like all these jargons that they don't understand. So they're done with the serious coins and they play the ones that they understand, which is the memes, because memes is just culture, like your strategy for trading means, is the harder I laugh, the more I want to buy.
00:49:34.994 - 00:50:11.316, Speaker B: Yes, exactly. What's happening with retail as well. So they play this market, and so the VC's and the retail, they're starting to bifurcate. Whereas before this emergence of meme coins, what used to happen was the VC's get into the insider deals, and then the coins get listed on centralized exchanges like finance, and then the retail buy the bags. So the retail was always the exit liquidity for VC's. It was Pve for VC's, VC's being the player and retail being the environment. It was easy mode, Pve mode for VC's.
00:50:11.316 - 00:50:15.924, Speaker B: But now the retail don't want to play anymore. They bifurcate. Yeah.
00:50:16.084 - 00:51:24.404, Speaker A: Very good explanation. And I think Zaheer from Z Capital mentioned this as well, which is that we're seeing a, you know, there are many opportunities in this dark forest of, like, the VC coins, and that it requires a lot of diligence on being able to see which ones are the ones that are underpriced relative to where we are in the market. So I thought that was also another interesting point because now, if you think about it, probably millions of coins now at this point. I mean, on Solana alone, there's 6000 coins that launch every day, which is insanity. But if you look at credible projects that have a token that's live, the ones that don't have a narrative but have really good product are the ones that are underpriced. And so I do think there is going to be a lot of opportunity in the VC area, is just having to spend a lot more time diligent and figuring out where the opportunity is and where the narrative is. Yeah, it's interesting because now that it's taking away a lot of the speculative flow meme coins, I think it's just going to become a very big market.
00:51:24.984 - 00:51:28.712, Speaker B: You think we're actually in a meme coin super cycle?
00:51:28.768 - 00:51:36.536, Speaker A: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, for sure. Hands down we're in a meme coin super cycle. And I mean, look at, look at.
00:51:36.600 - 00:52:02.236, Speaker B: Because this whole thing is not fundamentally different from ICO. Like, people frame these things in different ways. Like, the framing is meme coin versus ico, but fundamentally they're the same. They're all like vaporware that there's nothing that people want to gamble on. And it's the exact same story with NFTs in 2021 as well. NFTs were meme coins with a high fore price. Like, people frame these things differently, but fundamentally they're the same.
00:52:02.236 - 00:52:10.288, Speaker B: There's just a lot of phenomenon, like XRP or Cardano. These are meme coins from back in the day. People don't think of them as they.
00:52:10.296 - 00:52:24.864, Speaker A: Were dressed, but they were dressed as VC projects. Right? Uh, so, okay, there are memes to us. Okay, so, like, here's. Here's the funny part. I had a friend the other day that was like, hey, man, I heard Hedera just got a license in Dubai.
00:52:25.024 - 00:52:25.728, Speaker B: Who?
00:52:25.896 - 00:52:27.216, Speaker A: Hedera hash?
00:52:27.320 - 00:52:30.176, Speaker B: Was it Hedera hash?
00:52:30.320 - 00:52:42.228, Speaker A: Hedera hash? Graph, hashgraph. I'm like, it's a meme. Maybe they're building something, I don't know. But to you and I, it's a meme, right?
00:52:42.316 - 00:52:42.828, Speaker B: So.
00:52:42.956 - 00:53:02.108, Speaker A: But to everyone else, they think it's serious. Like, they did their diligence. They go on these, like, you know, investor group calls where, like, they're. To me, I think they're pumping dumb groups. I don't know. And then they talk about how the future of this happened in China with Cardano. Do you remember that video that went viral?
00:53:02.236 - 00:53:20.084, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah. Well, okay, so the thing is, Cardano, I think, is actually a meme coin to the people who traded because Charles Hoskinson is this cult leader. Like, people know. I think people know that there's nothing real there, but they just love Charles. Crypto.
00:53:20.124 - 00:53:23.564, Speaker A: Yes. Crypto natives, yes. But the average person I've had.
00:53:23.684 - 00:53:24.956, Speaker B: Oh, here's another one.
00:53:24.980 - 00:53:54.424, Speaker A: So I was at a. At a birthday party, like, a year ago, and. And this guy, like, this friend of mine that I've known him since high school, like, a smart guy, like, not an idiot. Like, a smart guy, came up to me, goes, I couldn't stop laughing, but he said, hey, man, I just bought some cardano. I really think, you know, it's the future. And I just bursted out laughing, and I laughed, and he goes, why are you laughing? I'm like, bro, there's nothing there. It's all vaporware.
00:53:54.424 - 00:54:14.044, Speaker A: And he got mad at me, and he left. And I told him, like, right before that, I'm like, just buy Solana instead, because that's where you want to be. And so I feel like people are taking. There's these coins that are marketed as real products, but they're really not.
00:54:14.824 - 00:54:28.406, Speaker B: I don't know. I'm surprised that you still have normie friends, because my friends are either entirely not interested in crypto or pure crypto DJs. It's either or. There's no in between. Yeah.
00:54:28.470 - 00:54:47.154, Speaker A: All the people that I am close to are retail crypto folks. Like, meaning that they got it their space where they got dumped on 2017, but then they still stayed along and bought some shit coins in 2020. Did well, and they're all in it. They're still all in the trenches.
00:54:47.494 - 00:54:51.696, Speaker B: My non crypto friends, they only buy bitcoin or ethereum. It's like.
00:54:51.760 - 00:54:53.244, Speaker A: Is that from your advice, though?
00:54:53.824 - 00:54:55.504, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay.
00:54:55.664 - 00:55:03.840, Speaker A: Yeah, well, the retail people I know, they don't even take my advice. I'm like, I just don't tell them anything, really. And then they'll ask me and I'll say whether or not.
00:55:03.952 - 00:55:06.568, Speaker B: But you told them to sell with $0.30.
00:55:06.616 - 00:55:10.040, Speaker A: Just my family members. No, I told them to buy with at $0.11.
00:55:10.152 - 00:55:14.080, Speaker B: But you told them to sell at some point a little bit too early, right? Or not?
00:55:14.112 - 00:55:24.414, Speaker A: Yeah, around, like, $2.50. And I told him to buy back. So they bought back 220. But yes, but that's from you. You told me to sell.
00:55:28.234 - 00:55:29.134, Speaker B: It's over.
00:55:32.594 - 00:55:38.106, Speaker A: But luckily I told him to buy back. There's one person I didn't buy back and he is. It hurts.
00:55:38.250 - 00:55:46.376, Speaker B: But, yeah, last thing, 25 years for SPF. Any thoughts? You don't care? Frankly, I don't really care. I don't care.
00:55:46.440 - 00:55:47.284, Speaker A: It's, uh.
00:55:49.064 - 00:55:52.684, Speaker B: 25 years feels a little bit too little. It's lower than I expected.
00:55:53.024 - 00:55:57.448, Speaker A: It seems lower than expected. But at the end of the day, you know, I thought it was going.
00:55:57.456 - 00:55:58.496, Speaker B: To be a life sentence.
00:55:58.640 - 00:56:11.024, Speaker A: I thought it was going to be life sentence, too. He'd probably get out in good eleven years. I think GCR put a tweet out that said that he'll get out in good behavior in 1112 years. And by then I think everyone will forget or are too rich to care.
00:56:11.144 - 00:56:11.844, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:56:12.464 - 00:56:28.496, Speaker A: So ten years, eleven years. It is what it is like, I don't care. It's time to move on. But, yeah, I do feel like it's too little. He should be in there for life, but like, Bernie Madoff was life. And it turns out SPF took more money than Bernie Madoff.
00:56:28.600 - 00:56:29.256, Speaker B: Way more.
00:56:29.360 - 00:56:33.768, Speaker A: Way more. So to me, I think there's politics involved and etcetera.
00:56:33.896 - 00:56:34.464, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:56:34.584 - 00:57:11.212, Speaker A: We're introducing a new section called Mailbag, where we have our listeners send us some questions and we'll try our best to, to answer some of them. And we have a private telegram chat where we have some of our listeners where we can kind of talk to, to get some of these questions. But the first question was asked by Joe, which is insights on DGen layer three. I think we've given that already. Earlier. Zapzaraapp Ethan or Zap zerup ETH said not a lot of people seem to talk about ordinals anymore. What is your take on ordinals? There's so much happening on ordinals.
00:57:11.212 - 00:57:42.164, Speaker A: Bullish, insanely bullish. But we're dedicating a complete new episode for that where we'll go deeper into ordinals. But high level runes is going to launch in 19 days. It's a protocol that brings fungibility or brings tokens to the bitcoin ecosystem, and that's going to unlock a lot of new use cases. And then we're going to see bitcoin L2s and other stuff, so we'll talk more about it. But extremely bullish.
00:57:42.284 - 00:58:17.720, Speaker B: Bitcoin is just so interesting. It's really the renaissance for bitcoin. My very quick thesis for ordinals is just wealth effect. The top ordinals today are trading maybe at 20% of the top Ethereum NFTs, just crypto punks. At the same time, bitcoin itself is three times higher than Ethereum, so that ratio will close. The gap between the two will close, meaning ordinals should reprice to a similar ratio to bitcoin as what punks are to Ethereum.
00:58:17.872 - 00:59:03.888, Speaker A: Yep, 100%. But I guess let's talk a little bit about this NFTs as a asset class. It seems to me more and more it's challenging my own thesis of whether or not NFTs will be a long term thing. It's because of, well, the thing is, obviously I still think it's going to be a very big sector, and we talked about why we're bullish, like four hundred four s and et cetera. But every meme coin or every NFT project now is launching their own token. So recently MFR airdropped its own token to everyone that's holding mfers, and we're seeing this meta play across the entire ecosystem, like capsules. Just launched an anime token as an example.
00:59:03.888 - 00:59:06.184, Speaker A: I forgot there's a bunch of others that there's a whole list.
00:59:06.264 - 00:59:10.232, Speaker B: It all started with bored apes in the last segment.
00:59:10.328 - 00:59:16.844, Speaker A: Yeah, it started with bored apes, but it kind of died there, right? The meta restarted with Bohem, or book of meme.
00:59:17.354 - 00:59:26.162, Speaker B: Because people now understand the market dynamics. They know that the Ford price is too high for retail to buy in, so they needed to launch fungible tokens.
00:59:26.298 - 01:00:05.562, Speaker A: Which is why we were so bullish 404s, right, to begin with, because it merges the two together. And so this is a new dynamic that's playing out. So we saw this by the pre sell phase, right, where these projects would raise an insane amount of money and then launch your token. And most of the time, price action outside of book of meme, and maybe slurp everything else kind of died. And then from there it went to, okay, forget the pre sell meta, because it's only down, only, let's just airdrop everyone a token, and you just buy as much as possible early on. And I think that's kind of what happened. MFR and others are launching.
01:00:05.562 - 01:00:19.634, Speaker A: It's a way to bring liquidity to market excitement to the market. Like, it's much easier to build a community when you have a token than an NFT, because you could extend that brand across, you know, across the globe easily because anyone can buy into it.
01:00:20.134 - 01:00:31.286, Speaker B: We actually just accidentally answered the question for Q, a flaky pastry. He had this exact question about meme coins versus nfts.
01:00:31.430 - 01:00:44.318, Speaker A: Yeah. So what would be the future of nfTs? What is the future of nfTs? I think all existing NFTs will launch your own token similar to like, MFR. I think that's what's going to happen.
01:00:44.446 - 01:00:45.902, Speaker B: They're going to launch their L2s.
01:00:45.998 - 01:01:16.586, Speaker A: Exactly. Some of them that are very strong brands will have to launch your own L2. Like, if you think about, let's say Azuki's right, they're launching something called anime chain before they got front run by capsule. They ended up taking a ticker on base and they launched it yesterday. But Azuki is launching it. So could there be products built on this chain that would help propagate Azuki's brand across the globe? Right. So, like, I don't know.
01:01:16.586 - 01:01:31.210, Speaker A: I'm throwing out hypotheticals. Azuki, ducks Azuki. I don't know. Social games. I could see this whole Disney like environment be built on its own L2 or layer three or whatever you want to call it.
01:01:31.322 - 01:01:32.658, Speaker B: Or layer one or layer one.
01:01:32.706 - 01:01:50.490, Speaker A: Well, actually, let me take this back. This already is happening. Axie. Axie, right? Incredible brand Ronin, its own chain. And now there's apps being built on top of ronin that's bringing incredible amount of users and growth using the. Some of which are using the Axies brand.
01:01:50.642 - 01:01:54.052, Speaker B: Ronin is technically, it's a side chain.
01:01:54.178 - 01:01:59.424, Speaker A: It's side chain. They're trying to get to the point where they're an actual L2. But, yeah, right now they're such.
01:01:59.504 - 01:02:16.664, Speaker B: Yeah, but they should do it just the layer one. I mean, just debase, you know, this is the other thing I don't understand about layer three. Like, you debase yourself by going as a layer three. Like, the higher layer, you go the mark. The less market the market appreciate you, the less the market values you.
01:02:16.704 - 01:02:21.992, Speaker A: Yeah, that is also true. But really, if you make sense to.
01:02:22.008 - 01:02:22.480, Speaker B: Me, to be honest.
01:02:22.512 - 01:03:00.996, Speaker A: But listen, ciao. Let me ask you this. I mean, okay, when you're building web two, you spin up what? An AWS server? AWS server. And I mean, it's commoditized, right? I think we're going through the commodity phase of L2s and layer threes to the point where the more you bring on, the less value we hold to these L2s and layer threes. And really, it's the products that are being built on top that brings in the value for the L2s and layer threes. The market skewed towards infrastructure that we forget that really what brings the value is the apps that are being built on top. So I don't think the market really understands this right now.
01:03:00.996 - 01:03:18.044, Speaker A: I think we're still stuck in the infra layer, and everyone that launches a L2 right now, you know, their market cap goes up, but the people aren't really realizing that eventually this is going to be all compressed away and it's really going to be the apps that bring the value for the layer ones and L2s, layer threes.
01:03:19.424 - 01:03:20.440, Speaker B: Yet to be seen.
01:03:20.552 - 01:03:21.440, Speaker A: Yet to be seen.
01:03:21.552 - 01:03:29.280, Speaker B: The fat prototype thesis has been the right thesis for ten years, so maybe that'll change at some point.
01:03:29.432 - 01:03:30.640, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree.
01:03:30.752 - 01:03:31.136, Speaker B: Cool.
01:03:31.200 - 01:03:32.364, Speaker A: Any other questions?
01:03:32.704 - 01:03:56.482, Speaker B: Kane has a good question. Is retail really, in example, new people in the space, or is it the same people with more willingness to spend money? Do we think we definitely get a new retail class coming in this cycle and from what? Okay, so there's actually a lot of debate on Twitter about this. Yes. There's people saying retail is not here. There's others that are saying retail is here. I have some thoughts, but I'm curious what you think.
01:03:56.618 - 01:03:57.650, Speaker A: No, you go first.
01:03:57.802 - 01:04:31.202, Speaker B: Okay. So I think the retail is actually here. And I know this by being really in the trenches, working with Pump Fund, who helps people launch meme coins on Solana. And as all good founders do, they talk to the users, and I would talk to them to understand what they learned from their users. And it turns out that the people who are creating those meme coins on Solana are true retail. They're like truck drivers from Alabama, that type of retail. They're not crypto natives.
01:04:31.202 - 01:05:17.680, Speaker B: I don't have data, large data, to prove this, but anecdotally, I'm fairly confident that the people who are trading meme coins on Solana, at least, are true retail bayes is a different story. Baze, I thought. Before this week, I thought it was crypto natives. I was actually very confident with crypto natives because the coins they launched were like dollar sign, warmy, dollar sign, degen, dollar sign, those names that crypto natives use. But this week, as of this week, top tickers, top meme coins on base start to become more. Less crypto native, more like pop culture. So I'm getting a sense that maybe there's retail that's coming from Coinbase to base now, but that's a maybe.
01:05:17.680 - 01:05:21.992, Speaker B: I'm more confident in Barcelona. I'm not sure about these. Curious what you think.
01:05:22.128 - 01:05:41.886, Speaker A: Okay, so it's really interesting. It's as if retail has never left. What I mean by this is there's a large population of retail people that came in from all the many cycles that just stay. They just stay. They continue buying, selling. They find their pockets or otherwise they'll just leave it alone. And they'll come back.
01:05:41.886 - 01:06:26.706, Speaker A: Whenever the market's green, they'll get a coinbase notification, they'll start to come back and trade, but they're dormant or they're hibernating, is what I would call it. And whenever market pumps, they're back. And that also brings on more new people. So, for now, like, I think retail has never left one. And that's why it may seem like, what are the retail people in or not? It doesn't seem like it, but retail is here, and they've always been here. Two, they're more sophisticated than we think they are, meaning that many of them. And I know this because I talk to retail people all the time, and I ask them a lot of questions, and it turns out they're familiar using uniswap, they're familiar using Jupiter, and they're on crypto Twitter.
01:06:26.706 - 01:06:42.010, Speaker A: Now, they actually also follow Ansem, of course, and. And they follow another guy named web3 Quan. And I know this because I've asked many people, and they get. They've given me these responses.
01:06:42.162 - 01:06:55.274, Speaker B: Yeah, I talked to web3 kwan, by the way. Okay. We should bring him on our pod. We should. Yeah. He has a tran fight background who also understands the Degen. Very rare combination.
01:06:55.434 - 01:06:56.898, Speaker A: We should bring him up.
01:06:57.026 - 01:06:57.618, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:06:57.746 - 01:07:17.022, Speaker A: And to me, I think, you know, it was as if you and I joined in 2013, and, you know, in 2017 is, like, our next cycle. Right. Like actual cycle 2020, whatever. Right. So I think that's where we are on the retail penetration side. Not saying. I mean, there is a good, healthy amount, but more will come, I don't think.
01:07:17.022 - 01:07:26.414, Speaker A: Did the new flow. I haven't seen the new flow of people come in yet. It seems to me. It's just all the existing retail people got activated. That's what it seems like to me.
01:07:26.454 - 01:07:31.286, Speaker B: Reactivated retail that was here last cycle, they got reactivated.
01:07:31.350 - 01:07:36.634, Speaker A: Yes. New are coming in, but they're not here yet. Like, fully here yet.
01:07:37.014 - 01:07:43.730, Speaker B: Still. The Columbia's Apple. Yeah. Is still 200 something. Yeah. Ranked 200 something on the App Store.
01:07:43.842 - 01:07:50.226, Speaker A: But I don't know if Coinbase app is a good indicator anymore. Yeah, I think it's Phantom.
01:07:50.370 - 01:07:51.314, Speaker B: I can see that.
01:07:51.434 - 01:07:53.346, Speaker A: So I think Phantom is.
01:07:53.490 - 01:08:00.954, Speaker B: So this cycle we sell, when Phantom becomes number one in App Store, 100%.
01:08:01.074 - 01:08:03.034, Speaker A: Phantom is the key indicator. Yeah.
01:08:03.114 - 01:08:04.790, Speaker B: Because it's the funnel for salon.
01:08:04.922 - 01:08:17.206, Speaker A: It's a funnel for Solana. And so once you get into, like, Solana shitcoining, you'll. You'll likely meet Ansem at the end of the day. Like, I mean, like. Like, somehow all roads will lead to Ansem.
01:08:17.270 - 01:08:18.622, Speaker B: All roads will lead to Anselm.
01:08:18.718 - 01:08:28.398, Speaker A: And Ansem. He's open. And he was like, okay, let's go to base. People will go to base. They'll figure it out and they'll go to base. And I think that's what's happening. They will figure it out.
01:08:28.398 - 01:09:01.781, Speaker A: Like, if there's an ability to make money, just like what you and I talked about, which is, like, buying our first bitcoin, you wired money to figure this out, right? You want to get exposure to space. You bought bitcoin, you wired money to mount Gox, and you got your bitcoin, right? That's what you had to do. Yeah, the same thing with me, right? I had to figure it out. I mean, I got in right around the time bitcoin coinbase launched easily with onramps offer them. So it was pretty easy for me. But that's their battle, right? And so I think they'll figure out bridging and all of that, and those. The ones that are bleeding edge will make money.
01:09:01.877 - 01:09:32.134, Speaker B: You know what just crossed my mind? There's about 1 million daily active addresses on Solana. And Solana is by far number one compared to the L2 s. Bayes probably went up a lot this past week, but Bayes is probably on the order of a few hundred thousand. Now, a lot of these active data active addresses are probably bots, farming, etcetera. And now if you think about the number of followers that Ansum has, Asim has 300,000.
01:09:32.294 - 01:09:32.678, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:09:32.726 - 01:09:37.630, Speaker B: So maybe you're right. Maybe all the users on Bayes and Solana are following Ansim.
01:09:37.742 - 01:10:18.308, Speaker A: Yeah, this is perfect, actually. That brings everything in full circle, which is the information. There's information silos all across the world about crypto, just like someone shilling Cardano to a chinese community where that video went viral. Or when my friend told me that he read a. He watched a podcast where they talked about why Cardano is the future and why people are building on Cardano. And it comes back to YouTube, it comes back to all these silos, right? And eventually, like, someone has to own that flow of information that can actually tell retail what coins are actually good to buy. And I think that's why I think Ansem kind of is the end, albeit all in this I call, which is like, people trust him.
01:10:18.308 - 01:10:28.372, Speaker A: He's, you know, there's trust, there's quality, there's entertainment and all of that. And so people just somehow find him and they follow him. It's just something that I noted.
01:10:28.548 - 01:10:33.828, Speaker B: You know, it's funny that people say there is no main character for this cycle yet. I think we already have one.
01:10:33.956 - 01:10:37.904, Speaker A: Yeah, but Ansem is trying to. He does not want to be the main character.
01:10:38.844 - 01:10:40.882, Speaker B: No main character ends up well.
01:10:41.028 - 01:11:03.854, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, hopefully he's all right. I was going to bring up another good point, but can't anymore. But, yeah, so I do think there's an element of dispersion of information that's being consolidated, and I think that's where the retail flow is going. Retail flow. Then we'll find opportunities in Solana base, and those two chains could become the retail chains.
01:11:04.014 - 01:11:40.510, Speaker B: I was thinking about one thing this morning, since you said the word dispersion. I was thinking this morning, there's actually a lot of dispersion in the market, in crypto market, meaning historically, in the last cycle, for example, everything went up or down at the same time. All the coins would go up together. All the coins would go down together. Yeah, but this cycle, if you follow twitter, a lot of people complain about the lack of, why isn't there an all season yet? Well, the fact of the matter is, if you haven't experienced an alt season, you are just simply in the wrong coins. And so what's happening in this cycle is the different coins, they move independently of each other. Some do really well.
01:11:40.510 - 01:12:15.936, Speaker B: Others have been flat. And I was thinking to myself why this is the case. And I have an interesting theory. I'm sure there are other people have thought about this as well, but my theory is actually really because there's too many coins in this cycle and there's orders magnitude more coins this cycle than the last, and the attention is being fragmented. There's only so many players, but the number of coins they can buy is way larger compared to the historical average. So they simply cannot buy everything together. They have to focus on the subset.
01:12:16.080 - 01:12:41.646, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree with that. I agree with that. I feel as if we're becoming bigger and bigger crypto ecosystem, and there will be a point where you and I can't even talk about all the things that are happening in crypto. I mean, that's kind of getting to that point, right. Um, but, yeah, eventually it'll be big enough where there's things that are happening in different parts of the world. Where we'll have no clue. And maybe crypto Twitter doesn't become a thing anymore, right? Like it's just global news.
01:12:41.646 - 01:12:54.166, Speaker A: I don't know. It does certainly feel that way. Great. Um, I think we covered a lot. Well, um, thanks for listening in. Um, if you have any questions, thoughts, join our telegram chat. Otherwise, we'll catch you soon.
