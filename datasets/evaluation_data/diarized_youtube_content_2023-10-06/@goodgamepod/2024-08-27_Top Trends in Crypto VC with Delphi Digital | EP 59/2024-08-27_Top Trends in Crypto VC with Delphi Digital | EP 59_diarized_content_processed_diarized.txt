00:00:00.440 - 00:00:04.085, Speaker A: Welcome to Good Game. Your no BS insights for crypto founders.
00:00:07.905 - 00:00:25.265, Speaker B: Tao is just kind of the, oh, man. Tradfi. AI based stuff is pumping. How does. How does exposure. How do I get exposure in crypto? And like, it just became the consensus pick. But the problem is, obviously, you know, people like it because they can farm a lot of Tao, get paid to basically, like, improve their models.
00:00:25.265 - 00:00:26.353, Speaker B: And so when you see a lot.
00:00:26.369 - 00:00:27.965, Speaker A: Of traders talking about it, that's when you.
00:00:31.705 - 00:00:32.585, Speaker B: Exit liquidity.
00:00:32.625 - 00:00:37.725, Speaker A: No, yeah, I saw that with Tron. With the son of memes.
00:00:38.225 - 00:00:39.977, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. Then you pump his pump.
00:00:40.041 - 00:00:43.553, Speaker A: Yeah, Pump fund on Tron. So every trader is talking about it right now.
00:00:43.609 - 00:00:44.057, Speaker C: Oh, wow.
00:00:44.121 - 00:00:46.113, Speaker D: The son of memes. That's the name of the product.
00:00:46.169 - 00:00:48.673, Speaker A: Yeah, Son memes or something like that.
00:00:48.689 - 00:00:51.641, Speaker C: Yeah, you got to lean into it, honestly. You know, like, go to the sun.
00:00:51.673 - 00:00:52.943, Speaker A: It's like instead of going to the moon.
00:00:53.089 - 00:01:00.295, Speaker C: Oh, that is so good. You're going to get burned. Damn. I mean, at least they're being like, correct.
00:01:00.995 - 00:01:02.323, Speaker A: Well, at least it's being transparent.
00:01:02.379 - 00:01:03.611, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly.
00:01:03.803 - 00:01:16.699, Speaker A: Before we jump into the episode, a quick reminder that the early application deadline for Alliance's All 14 cohort is tomorrow. Be sure to get your application in by the end of the day on August 28th at Alliance XYZ. Yeah, he's. He's pretty funny.
00:01:16.787 - 00:01:18.371, Speaker D: I know him. Then I know who you're talking about.
00:01:18.403 - 00:01:18.739, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:01:18.827 - 00:01:20.283, Speaker C: You on TikTok a lot or what?
00:01:20.339 - 00:01:22.715, Speaker D: Yeah, my TikTok is either soccer and comedian.
00:01:22.795 - 00:01:23.921, Speaker C: Oh, nice. Awesome.
00:01:24.083 - 00:01:24.469, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:01:24.517 - 00:01:26.685, Speaker D: Or cooking thirst traps.
00:01:26.765 - 00:01:34.785, Speaker C: Nice. We look at this for you. It is like, yo, there's no comedy.
00:01:36.925 - 00:01:38.745, Speaker B: No soccer. Yeah.
00:01:40.925 - 00:01:48.533, Speaker A: Did you guys see that funny Tik Tok video of. Oh, I have it. But it's an Asian dude and he's.
00:01:48.669 - 00:01:49.637, Speaker D: The Gen Z. Gen Alpha.
00:01:49.661 - 00:01:53.905, Speaker A: The Gen Z, Gen Alpha. No, he's saying, oh, this is so funny.
00:01:54.365 - 00:02:16.345, Speaker C: Although I was at a dinner earlier this week and one of my friends, she started like a Gen Z, like, mental wellness app. And so she talks to Gen Z a lot. And she was showing me words that they, like, had started telling her and I was like, what are these words? Apparently they love Grok. You know, like the guy from Avengers or whatever. Groot. Groot.
00:02:16.805 - 00:02:17.665, Speaker D: Grock.
00:02:18.165 - 00:02:26.041, Speaker C: Groot. Yeah, sorry, sorry. Fox. See, I'm Fox. Damn, I'm going to get canceled. And then. Yeah, fuck, don't record.
00:02:26.041 - 00:02:28.121, Speaker C: And then there's Skibidi or something.
00:02:28.153 - 00:02:29.705, Speaker A: Skibidi. That's Gen Alpha.
00:02:29.785 - 00:02:31.257, Speaker C: Okay. What is Skibidi?
00:02:31.361 - 00:02:48.505, Speaker A: It's from. We're good. Skibidi. Toilet it's like, oh, yeah, of course. You guys know what that is? It's like a miniseries, and it came from a game. And I guess they took one of the characters, cut his head off, and they put it on a toilet.
00:02:48.625 - 00:02:49.313, Speaker C: What?
00:02:49.489 - 00:02:49.873, Speaker D: What?
00:02:49.929 - 00:02:56.327, Speaker A: And, like, it became a meme. Yeah, I think I forgot the name of the game. And then they started making a series out of it.
00:02:56.391 - 00:03:06.623, Speaker C: Well, apparently the word means either good or bad. And then we're like, how does that make any sense? And then they're like, oh, it's like cooked. Getting cooked, or like cooking. And I was like, damn, I hate that I understand this right now.
00:03:06.759 - 00:03:08.383, Speaker B: But, like, there's a different word, right?
00:03:08.479 - 00:03:09.639, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. Or sick.
00:03:09.687 - 00:03:10.543, Speaker B: Sense is bad.
00:03:10.639 - 00:03:12.023, Speaker C: Sick is good or bad.
00:03:12.119 - 00:03:12.575, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:03:12.655 - 00:03:15.447, Speaker C: Then we started. We're like, is every word good or bad?
00:03:15.631 - 00:03:17.715, Speaker A: Or English or Spanish?
00:03:21.615 - 00:03:27.391, Speaker D: Know what that is? No, no, it's the. It's the hottest meme on. On. Okay, so there you go.
00:03:27.423 - 00:03:29.223, Speaker C: I heard another thing of Ohio is this.
00:03:29.279 - 00:03:29.799, Speaker A: Ohio.
00:03:29.887 - 00:03:31.415, Speaker D: Ohio. Yeah. Ohio's in Ohio.
00:03:31.455 - 00:03:32.519, Speaker C: Which is so insulting.
00:03:32.567 - 00:03:33.195, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:03:34.255 - 00:03:37.679, Speaker A: Well, I mean, like, I. I felt like even before then, Ohio was pretty insulting.
00:03:37.767 - 00:03:45.967, Speaker D: I don't know if you guys watch. I don't watch. Euro. The final of the Euro European Championship was Spain versus England.
00:03:46.071 - 00:03:46.375, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:03:46.415 - 00:03:52.165, Speaker D: And I almost tweeted Spanish, English, English or Spanish. But I was like, no one understands it.
00:03:52.245 - 00:03:53.085, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah.
00:03:53.245 - 00:04:01.613, Speaker A: Where it came from is there's this famous streamer, and he goes up to people and says, if you move, you're gay. But it turns out, no, no.
00:04:01.669 - 00:04:03.677, Speaker D: It goes English or Spanish. I don't know that guy.
00:04:03.701 - 00:04:04.509, Speaker B: And then they just vote.
00:04:04.597 - 00:04:09.557, Speaker A: But most of the people were Spanish. So then he went to. First he asked him English or Spanish.
00:04:09.621 - 00:04:10.029, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:04:10.117 - 00:04:12.949, Speaker A: And then he would say it, if you move, you're gay.
00:04:13.037 - 00:04:13.989, Speaker C: Yeah, English, respect.
00:04:14.037 - 00:04:20.045, Speaker D: Whoever moves first is good. And then people. Then people start responding Chinese or Portuguese.
00:04:20.205 - 00:04:30.305, Speaker C: The guy's like, fuck, yeah, damn, you guys are plugged in then. I mean, this makes sense why alliance is crushing so much. You guys are just going straight to the source.
00:04:31.885 - 00:04:51.471, Speaker A: Yeah. I feel like where we are in crypto is, like, a very interesting time frame. We have a bunch of infra projects that have raised capital. Now people are pretty upset, it seems like. And then, like, we're starting to see the rise of consumer. How do you guys see it? Like, what's. Like, what's interesting for you guys?
00:04:51.663 - 00:04:52.879, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, is that true?
00:04:52.927 - 00:04:53.991, Speaker A: Like, are there better?
00:04:54.023 - 00:04:55.615, Speaker C: People are always going to be upset, first of all.
00:04:55.655 - 00:04:55.895, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:04:55.935 - 00:05:08.191, Speaker C: Okay, so I don't pay any mind to that, honestly. People have always been upset in crypto, you know, except unless like prices hitting all time highs and going like straight through it. Right. So yeah, I'd say like stay off the timeline a little bit more.
00:05:08.263 - 00:05:08.639, Speaker A: Cool.
00:05:08.727 - 00:05:09.839, Speaker C: Because. Yeah, yeah.
00:05:09.927 - 00:05:27.503, Speaker B: I mean the divergence in prices. Right. You see you have so much of the community saying oh, when bull market, meanwhile bitcoin just went on an absolute tear. And so you know, a lot of stuff's doing well but not a lot of people are necessarily doing well. And so it's created a lot of frustration from those that haven't to, you know, finger point and, and, and find a scapegoat.
00:05:27.599 - 00:05:30.635, Speaker A: So it's all about price at the end of the day, like macro and price.
00:05:30.935 - 00:05:57.661, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean from, from the miscellaneous perspective. Yeah. On, I mean on the venture side it's tricky because you have kind of there's the people that are playing the early stage game and then people that are playing the late stage game and late stage game is, you know, part of it is you're investing to deploy capital and you're, and you're running the management fee side. Right. And that's where like your performance doesn't really drive as much of the returns as the management fees do. And so you have that driving the valuations.
00:05:57.661 - 00:06:39.675, Speaker B: And also I think there's big appetite to invest at in these, you know, low to mid 9 figure vals relative which you know, by all accounts is expensive in terms of what the projects have delivered, especially when you compare to traditional venture. But I think that the difference is you have like a high, a much higher probability of getting some kind of liquidity. Right. And so people are going to take a lot more swings at Rich Valley because there is a path versus it being this kind of binary, this is a dud or I get a really big exit. And so I think that that drives the appetite to kind of invest in those rounds. But yeah, it's, you know, people are learning painfully that there, there isn't really demand for a lot of the stuff in size. And then yeah, the street trailing price, I mean we need apps, right.
00:06:39.675 - 00:06:58.655, Speaker B: Like the, that's really where you start getting a lot more the consumer side. And so I'm excited on that front, you know, from gaming from some other areas as well. I think ideally that that's gonna onboard the next, you know, 10,000, 100,000 users rather than thinking about it as like how do we onboard the next million, like 20 million? I think.
00:06:58.775 - 00:07:24.903, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. And I think like people in crypto are so like catalyst focused. They're always looking and they'll, like, think about every negative that could potentially happen. I think one thing that people are really bad at in this space is, like, factoring in, like, positive surprises. Right. So, for example, you know, obviously last cycle we were very close to Axie, you know, helped design it, like, work with that team very closely. And even that, even us being that close to it, it positively surprised us.
00:07:24.903 - 00:07:27.119, Speaker C: Right. Like, we had no idea it was going to go that crazy.
00:07:27.167 - 00:07:27.691, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:07:27.823 - 00:07:48.379, Speaker C: And so a lot of people who maybe aren't talking to builders every day, talking to people building all these apps, obviously you guys are super close to it, but even you guys, I think, will be positively surprised on Fantasy Top or something like that, where it's like, wow, this actually worked out how we theoretically wanted it to. And I think that's surprised every time. Yeah, exactly. Right.
00:07:48.427 - 00:08:14.211, Speaker D: I think what you mentioned is really important. Point is, it's probably one of the most important lessons I learned in the last three years, investing at the very earliest stage, which is that you should stop thinking about what could go wrong instead. Because that's the instinct. Like, for the vast majority of inventory investors, their first instinct when they see a pitch is, here are some of the reasons that could go wrong. But what you really should be thinking about is what if everything goes right, how big it could get right.
00:08:14.243 - 00:08:32.701, Speaker C: Yeah. And I think there's two ways to think about it, too. One is so many people in the world are trying to make things not go wrong. Right. For us, we're obviously subject to a lot of macro conditions and everything like that. Our market is still tiny on the grand scheme of things. So, you know, when people are like, oh, man, like, you know, if this macro stuff happens, we're fucked.
00:08:32.701 - 00:08:38.349, Speaker C: It's like, no, no, this macro stuff happens. The bigger market is even more fucked. And those people don't want that to happen.
00:08:38.397 - 00:08:38.885, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:08:39.005 - 00:08:54.627, Speaker C: So that's one part. And then the other part is. And, you know, I think you see this every day. The incentives in crypto are very kind of like, well aligned, where builders have an opportunity to, you know, make a huge impact, get a lot of users, and make a lot of money if they're right.
00:08:54.701 - 00:08:55.023, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:08:55.079 - 00:09:20.071, Speaker C: So, you know, you guys have been in New York for the past couple of weeks. I'm sure as you're talking to these builders, one thing you see is like, just like the hustle, the grind, like, every single one of these builders is working day and night to make their app like the breakout app. And we don't need all of them to be successful, you need one or two. And I think that's like, that's what makes me, like, very optimistic. And, you know, I'm sure we'll talk about this later, but like, I'm a permeable. So just like, not financial advice.
00:09:20.103 - 00:09:20.687, Speaker A: I'm a permeable.
00:09:20.751 - 00:09:35.155, Speaker C: I've been. Yeah, I've been. I've been wrong many, many months in a row. Right. But honestly, like, ye. Yeah, I'm like, as bullish as I can get always. And I know the timeline is very different, but that's why I really don't pay attention that much.
00:09:35.155 - 00:09:35.935, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:09:36.355 - 00:09:38.455, Speaker D: What verticals are you guys excited about?
00:09:39.075 - 00:09:40.139, Speaker B: You can go first if you want.
00:09:40.187 - 00:10:33.861, Speaker C: Yeah, I think there are three that we've been seeing in investment committee more and more and we're still deploying and I think our investment committees have only gotten more and more interesting. The way that our, like, process really works at Delphi is like, we call ourselves one of the slower funds because our investment process takes minimum two weeks. Which, you know, right now doesn't seem bad, but like, in a bull market, two weeks is like, you know, you're going to definitely not lose a lot of deals. But the way that it works is like, obviously our venture team has a lot of incentives to, you know, get the deal passed. They'll bring in a deal, basically shield it to, you know, us as partners and, you know, the team in general. And then week two, we kind of bring in a lot of the people, you know, from the research side who have expertise on that specific domain or subject and almost have like a debate within the team. I think our investment committees have been super interesting over the past few months as we've looked at less and less deals, but talked about them more and more.
00:10:33.861 - 00:11:06.921, Speaker C: And I think some spaces, and, you know, Jan brings up gaming. That's obviously one that we've always been focused on. It hasn't played out like, to the degree that we want right now, but I think games take a while. I'll let Jan really handle that because, like, we have this thing at Delphi called Shit on Delphi Day, which is basically like, we try and do it like once every quarter. Sometimes it'll go every six months. But if we ever do like a retreat or in person, we always do it where basically it's a day where no one can say anything good about Delphi within the team. So we basically like only shit on everything that we do and try and like improve from that.
00:11:06.921 - 00:11:23.713, Speaker C: And you can call for a specific sector. So, you know, at the End of last year, Joe's my. Our other partner. Jose and I were like, hey, we think we've, like, you know, we think we are more than allocated to gaming. We've invested a lot. Like, at this point, if it works out, like we're going to. We're going to have good exposure.
00:11:23.713 - 00:11:43.229, Speaker C: But if it doesn't, like, we're just. Just piling money fucking away right now. So we called like Shidon Deli Gaming Day. And, you know, Jan and Pierce were like, bet all right. Like, we're going to come prepared. And they basically did something really cool where not only was it with the team, they brought up a bunch of our port codes on as well. And they kind of presented like.
00:11:43.229 - 00:12:15.897, Speaker C: And remember, this is like end of last year, this is like Precia. So, like, you know, the real bull or like the. The upward trend hadn't really started yet. So this is kind of like bottom of the bottom. And, you know, talking to all the gaming Porcos who honestly were building in a silo of just like, you know, very focused on what they were working on and talking about what problems they were either trying to solve or, you know, had solved. And then sharing that with our other Porcos was like, really cool to see. And then honestly, that made me kind of like feel very, you know, it made Jose and I, like, very comfortable with our gaming exposure.
00:12:15.897 - 00:12:35.633, Speaker C: And we're like, all right, maybe we can get more. Because, like, we were super impressed with the builders there. And I think they're building from all different angles. So, you know, one example I'll give right now is, and I'm sure Jan has like a bunch more, but maybe two that I really like talking about is like GG zip, which just kind of like launched like a small trial this month. I don't know if you guys.
00:12:35.809 - 00:12:37.009, Speaker A: That's the location based.
00:12:37.057 - 00:12:40.761, Speaker C: Yeah, it's like Solana location, almost like Pokemon Go. Oh, gg.
00:12:40.833 - 00:12:41.937, Speaker D: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:12:42.001 - 00:12:50.169, Speaker C: I think there's a lot of potential there. It's obviously very ambitious and very hard to do, but I think some concept like that is going to work. And obviously we hope it's GG zip. We have bags.
00:12:50.217 - 00:12:55.513, Speaker D: Obviously you guys invested like a couple years ago in that project or is there?
00:12:55.609 - 00:13:15.095, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it was really. It's really interesting to me. Right? So at its core, I think crypto is like this giant human coordination tool. And I think, like, right now we've played in like the digital space a lot. But what I'm really excited about is bringing that to the physical space. Because I think that's when, you know, people outside of crypto will start noticing, saying, GG zip.
00:13:15.095 - 00:13:39.187, Speaker C: You know, they play a game in a week or a day, and you see like, you know, 800 people like all like, run through Central park or go to like a specific coffee store and say the same order or, you know, some dumb stuff like that. I think that can be. Get a lot of, like, mainstream kind of attention and you could kind of like use that to do some productive things. Whether it's like, oh, everyone, you know, photo yourself giving, like a homeless guy some food or something like that.
00:13:39.251 - 00:13:40.363, Speaker A: There's music map too, right?
00:13:40.379 - 00:13:40.611, Speaker B: Or something.
00:13:40.643 - 00:14:01.245, Speaker D: Music map you want to talk about? It's sound app. Sound about it. Or I can talk about it. So it's like, it's an app that one of our founders told me about yesterday, and it's like a Pokemon Go. But instead of collecting Pokemon, you collect music. Individual songs and real songs by famous artists, musicians like Taylor Swift or whatever. And it's growing like crazy.
00:14:01.325 - 00:14:02.741, Speaker C: It's like, that's crypto too.
00:14:02.813 - 00:14:21.405, Speaker D: It's not crypto. It's a pure web too. But it can totally be built on crypto because those songs in that app are traded. There's a secondary market and people trade the songs. You can already think, oh, these songs can be in the form of NFTs and trade with each other. But people really love collecting music of their favorite musician. Yeah, that is the.
00:14:21.405 - 00:14:27.073, Speaker D: I think there's slightly different psychology. Like, Pokemon is like nostalgia.
00:14:27.169 - 00:14:27.585, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:14:27.665 - 00:14:32.425, Speaker D: But collecting music is like feeling closer to the Taylor Swift.
00:14:32.545 - 00:14:44.985, Speaker C: Yeah, I can. So, yeah, I can talk about music stuff a while. For a while too. Like, I've been. It's a big passion for my team. Like, really love it. You know, I DJ as well, so I've been like, really into like the crate digging and everything like that too.
00:14:44.985 - 00:14:52.957, Speaker C: I spent some time diving deep in the music world right around like, you know, a few years ago, we bought this Disclosure nft.
00:14:53.021 - 00:14:53.653, Speaker A: Yes, I remember.
00:14:53.709 - 00:15:21.039, Speaker C: We ended up getting like, really. We became really good friends with those guys. Ended up being able to go to like all their concerts, have them, you know, throw parties with us and stuff too. And one thing I learned from working and talking to them who are successful artists is just like how fuck the music industry is. And you obviously hear this a lot. But I think like, you know, in, you know, we come from the tried by world. They're like, you know, it was very easy for crypto to kind of like cross over because their incentives are financial.
00:15:21.039 - 00:15:50.655, Speaker C: Right. So like, if they can make money, they're going to be open to it. I think one thing I realized thinking about the music world is there's so many gatekeepers and money is not their number one priority. Their number one priority is like power and ego. And it was like almost like negotiating with a terrorist every time that like I started talking to, you know, music crypto startups and stuff like that. And one thing that I think, like building any startup in crypto is hard. Right? It's like, you know, building a plane while like the, you know, you know, while you're flying, while you're like, while you don't know where the weather is.
00:15:50.655 - 00:16:20.927, Speaker C: Yeah, but I think like music crypto founders, like they actually have the hardest possible thing because you have to be ready to go to war, right? With all the licenses, with all the copyright, like all this stuff that like gets in the way. So yeah, I mean I still every now and then will bring like a music deal. Like I know I was talking to Joey at Crate. Yeah, yeah, I really like like flipping it on its head. And I know you guys were involved in that, you know, and I always try and bring this stuff to IC just so we can talk, but I don't think we've done a music deal in a while.
00:16:21.031 - 00:16:25.623, Speaker A: What do you think about music NFTs? I mean obviously we, we see what the market thought of it, but yeah.
00:16:25.679 - 00:16:31.495, Speaker C: Is that, I think, I think it will exist in some way, shape or form and more like a capital, maybe.
00:16:31.535 - 00:16:54.065, Speaker B: A, a fundraising tool for early artists, right. Where they, they can sell future royalties or something like that to help bootstrap themselves. In that sense, I think there's like a small venture style kind of investment that, that fans can make and be rewarded for being early and finding promising artists. But yeah, it's hard to do the prominent artist kind of component.
00:16:54.405 - 00:16:55.693, Speaker A: I feel like that's out of the picture.
00:16:55.749 - 00:17:17.367, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't think so actually. I think, I think there is so one thing. So you know, I'm like angel and royal, like royal. Cuz like Justin's a friend and I've told him this many times. Like I think actually that is not the best way. Like most fans don't care about buying music and stuff. But the irrational super fandom, like you know, you said you're really into music too.
00:17:17.367 - 00:17:45.761, Speaker C: I spend like an ungodly amount on like the artists that I love. Right. And so I think that super fandom is where you can actually get a lot of benefit. Like you see Taylor Swift right now, right? She's always such a good example on the other end of the spectrum, or like a Drake or a Kanye and stuff like that. I think these people have immense power to extract more value. Not extract more value, but, you know, get more value from their super fans who are more than happy to give it to them. And you see them, you know, when Kanye makes shoes or something like.
00:17:45.761 - 00:18:18.637, Speaker C: Or shirts and stuff like that, the fans are like, hey, you know, I'll buy it just to support, you know. And I think those types of things are. It's always sad to me that, you know, no musician has become like a billionaire off music because I think music is, like, super impactful to culture. And I think culture is like. And I think that's also a thesis that I have in crypto, is that crypto is going to allow people to unlock, like, the value of culture in a way that hasn't really been able to be done before. And I think, you know, meme coins are a little bit, you know, parallel to that as well. But, yeah, I think the super fandom is where I'm most interested.
00:18:18.637 - 00:18:23.541, Speaker C: So, yeah, if anyone's building in that, like, era, that's like the little niche that I really like.
00:18:23.613 - 00:18:31.005, Speaker B: Yeah. Maybe more as a. As a kind of a permission thing where it's like, you know, you hold a certain amount of these assets and you get access that people wouldn't have otherwise or.
00:18:31.045 - 00:18:47.705, Speaker C: Yeah. Or not even. So. So everyone thinks of NFTs as things that you, like, sell and everything. I think, you know, for me, NFTs, like, at the end of the day, are all about their story. And I think, you know, back in the day or last cycle, most NFT stories were just the price that were paid. That's pretty bad story, to be honest.
00:18:47.705 - 00:19:07.709, Speaker C: Right. That's why I think, you know, the disclosure NFT was such a cool one. Cause, you know, not only did we win it, we ended up becoming friends with them, ended up using, you know, ended up throwing, like, parties with them for crypto people. Right. And everything like that. Never recording a pod, ended up helping them, you know, do NFTs and stuff. So I ended up up building this whole relationship where price is the smallest part of that story.
00:19:07.709 - 00:19:41.145, Speaker C: I think in some of these, like, big artists. We were talking to, like, the Weeknd's team for a bit and, you know, there's still some potential here too, but it's kind of like early days. But one of his first albums was like, Trilogy, which, like, is a cult favorite of, like, his fan base. Right. And the cool Part about it is they had all this, you know, they've. They had like a shop set up when he was first coming out, before he even really sold tour tickets or anything. So they have all this data on who bought, you know, exo, like hat or hoodie during that era from 10 years ago.
00:19:41.225 - 00:19:41.845, Speaker A: How?
00:19:42.425 - 00:20:07.457, Speaker C: Just from their site. Right. So one thing that we were kind of like working with them and an idea that we kind of like gave was, you know, doing a kind of like intimate show for this concert where, sure, you sell a thousand tickets, right. And make it gamified with like, you know, top 10 bidders. Get like, you know, go to dinner and listen to the next album, whatever. You know, like top hundred, get like a signed vinyl, whatever. But then the other part is like, you could do another thousand tickets.
00:20:07.457 - 00:20:33.947, Speaker C: So it's like still a 2000. This guy plays like 60,000 people venues right now. So 2000 is like extremely intimate and in the very like, engaging experience, especially for an album that he doesn't even perform anymore. Right. That his fans would kind of die over the other thousand tickets. You kind of like airdrop to people from that last era. So, you know, imagine waking up one day and you've been like, oh, remember you bought this hoodie 10 years ago and you've been an early the Weeknd fan.
00:20:33.947 - 00:20:40.355, Speaker C: You get a free ticket for you and your friend to come to this show that he's doing in New York or LA or Toronto or whatever.
00:20:40.475 - 00:20:43.695, Speaker A: It's like gamifying the ticketing slash.
00:20:44.035 - 00:21:09.075, Speaker C: And I think this data, like most artists don't have this data, which is the problem and I think needs to be fixed. But an artist like that who has that data, I think it's like almost a crime or insult that you're not doing something with that data. Right. So I think like, these, the music nfts for these big artists, like, they already have a lot of money, et cetera. Like, what they can be used for is giving it and rewarding people. Yeah. And making that bond and community way stronger.
00:21:09.075 - 00:21:31.593, Speaker C: And think about that story that they're going to, you know, tell afterwards where it's like, oh, like, you know, literally, I, you know, he didn't owe me anything. I bought that hoodie with my own money. I got the hoodie from it. $49, whatever the fuck, right. And now 10 years later, I'm being rewarded for being this early of a fan. I think these, this type of stuff is going to be really interesting and I think crypto is going to play a big piece of It.
00:21:31.769 - 00:21:36.297, Speaker B: But yeah, going back to the kind of the initial question of areas we're excited about and what we're.
00:21:36.361 - 00:21:41.025, Speaker C: Yeah, sorry, music is not an area we're too excited about. I'm personally excited, but Delphi's definitely not.
00:21:41.065 - 00:21:43.305, Speaker B: You know, been hard to invest in it.
00:21:43.345 - 00:21:45.193, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:21:45.289 - 00:22:11.965, Speaker B: But no, I think gaming's still going to be a big one. You know, what kind of went right, what kind of went wrong early on. I think the strengths of crypto are a double edged sword here and particularly in terms of the initial liquidity and the over financialization that is going to be what helps really propel a really good game. But I think when it's introduced too early in a game's life cycle, which is what we saw with a lot of these games. Axie. To some extent. Yeah.
00:22:11.965 - 00:22:50.475, Speaker B: But even a lot of these earlier ones where in order. I agree with Axie, where in order for the liquid economy to flourish there needs to be a good amount of demand that's offsetting the supply. And in order for that demand to be there, a lot of the game loops have to be built out. And so when it's introduced before the game loops are built out, you kind of have that mismatch and you get the ebbs and flows where it really rips. That creates a lot of artificial demand. And then when the pure mercenary capital leaves, you have this glut of supply of whatever assets are in the game. And so when a gaming project pitches.
00:22:50.515 - 00:22:55.339, Speaker D: You, what do you look for? What constitutes an interesting game?
00:22:55.507 - 00:23:25.795, Speaker B: Yeah, so one needs to be table stakes at this point is there needs to be a way for people to play without needing to touch crypto. So I think you can introduce crypto as a tool in the future to say you've played X amount. Here's something you can claim for free as an NFT that you could sell. Not, you know, you need to own a wall. You have to have a wall, you have to have eth. You need these assets to even play. To create that barrier to entry is really, you know, a mistake.
00:23:25.795 - 00:23:46.967, Speaker B: Part of what makes free to play so successful is the free to play element. Right. There's no barrier. You download your playing and then you throw in the hooks kind of thing. Here you can. The on chain assets that you own are huge carrots and so you can offer them without requiring people to require requiring people to have, you know, on chain assets to play the game. So I think that's first form of them.
00:23:46.991 - 00:23:48.351, Speaker A: Right, Sorry, Pixels was one of them.
00:23:48.383 - 00:23:51.855, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. They, they've done, they've done, they've done well.
00:23:51.975 - 00:23:54.959, Speaker A: Investors in pixels. Okay, yeah, they've done pretty well.
00:23:55.007 - 00:24:18.003, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. So that's definitely one of them. You know, obviously the game needs to be fun. I think the standards for what is considered fun have gone up. Right. Because before people, it's always a combination of, you know, you're assigning weights to different inputs and, and fun for a while when all the gaming projects were ripping was less important. It's like, all right, can I see there being demand? Is it addicting? Yada yada yada.
00:24:18.003 - 00:24:55.795, Speaker B: And so I think there's been a bigger emphasis on, you know, the, is this a fun game that I can play? Gaming is a really competitive kind of field and you know, games don't last forever, right? They have a peak and then they kind of slowly fade off as people have gone through the game and you know, are replaying certain loops. Replayability is a really big one. Right. Where part of that is the competitive side. So there needs to be a well designed competitive kind of environment because that's what keeps people coming back. And really, you know, a game that's well balanced is important. So there's that element.
00:24:55.795 - 00:25:11.845, Speaker B: If you're like certain games, you know, part of the thesis is the fact that they can be played on really low end devices. So that's a big one where you now you can start to target a really large audience and in certain regions in the world that you know, they're operating off very cheap kind of hardware.
00:25:12.185 - 00:25:17.817, Speaker D: What about the opposite? Like the Triple A games? Are you. Do you think there is an intersection between those and crypto?
00:25:17.881 - 00:25:54.431, Speaker B: Yeah, so. So one we're very excited about is off the grid Gonzilla. We honestly we heard about it a while ago, didn't invest a couple of years ago and are now just really trying to put as much into it as we can. We're pretty convinced that will be the Triple A shooter that rivals kind of Warzone and basically your Extraction Battle Royale type type shooter. And we think yeah, the quality of this game is insane. And so it's going to be coming out later on this year. Have kind of what's the crypto element.
00:25:54.431 - 00:26:45.343, Speaker B: And so a lot of these assets are going to be on chain. Basically the premise is you are loaded into this body with cybernetic parts and as you're playing this shooter and as you are shooting, you shoot someone's arm off. Your arm has a grappling hook, theirs comes off, you can replace it and it's got like a new skill or a new asset that you can use. And so it adds a really cool dimension to an otherwise kind of, you know, standard successful shooting element. But part of what the crypto element is just adding a lot of these items on chain and particularly on both the collectible side and the functional side. But it's still balanced where you don't have this kind of pay to win element, which is important. But yes, it's a quality game that's again adding.
00:26:45.343 - 00:26:55.671, Speaker B: You don't have to overly engineer the crypto element and put it in your face, but there's still like the mass development of ownership of assets and being able to kind of get liquidity on them.
00:26:55.703 - 00:26:56.647, Speaker A: Like more ugc.
00:26:56.751 - 00:26:59.423, Speaker B: Yeah, got it. To some extent.
00:26:59.479 - 00:27:05.703, Speaker A: To some extent. But it's like NFTs, right? I mean that's a big business even for Roblox. One third of the revenue comes from like ugc.
00:27:05.879 - 00:27:38.875, Speaker B: Right. And so the other one we're really excited about on the UGC side specifically is Hytopia. So basically Minecraft right now there's, you know, I forget, like 100 million-plus monthly active users. And so why is it so popular right now? It's not because the developers are constantly expanding the game. It's all UGC where people create worlds and people can play in these worlds. And these worlds range from, you know, here's my castle that I built to a shooter to all of this stuff. And so right now those creators, that's what's driving the kind of all the attention.
00:27:38.875 - 00:28:03.047, Speaker B: So what this game does is it makes a backwards compatible Minecraft client. They can be played on browser. So from the perspective of the player side, it's the same experience with some quality of life improvements and other graphics improvements. So it's going to feel very familiar but improved. And then from the creator side is where the big unlock is. It's, it allows for a better way for them to monetize what they're already doing. So they get to continue building worlds in the same way they do.
00:28:03.047 - 00:28:27.273, Speaker B: And now there's a better, now there's like crypto monetization, Rails where they can clip a larger percentage of the fee and there's upside in the protocol and stuff like that. And so we think, you know, if you just capture even 1% of that user base where you're not teaching them to play a new game, you're not trying to, you know, get them out of a game they really love into something else, it's continue doing what you like. But here are additional ways to kind of earn and. And participate in upside of the project.
00:28:27.329 - 00:28:38.225, Speaker A: I feel like these worlds are like underexplored and under. Like I feel like there should be more in like allowing people to build their own worlds and content. I feel like that's something that my kids always.
00:28:38.345 - 00:28:38.665, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:28:38.705 - 00:28:39.233, Speaker A: Look for as well.
00:28:39.249 - 00:28:45.339, Speaker C: It's hard to bootstrap. Right. And then like. But once you get the flywheel, it just becomes this huge moat like you've seen in Minecraft.
00:28:45.427 - 00:28:45.923, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:28:46.019 - 00:29:10.055, Speaker A: Just going back to like gaming. You know, back in 2122 Axie Infinity took off and then there was this whole narrative around trading guilds or like gaming guilds and the ability for people to play these games and earn. Is that still true? Has that changed in some shape based on the game design? How do you see that kind of moving forward?
00:29:10.195 - 00:29:39.057, Speaker B: I think that element will always be there. It's existed in Web two, you know, people like even back as far as Diablo, you know, people would play the game then they would take these assets, sell them on third party sites and that was effectively play to earn. Right. It's just selling your assets to someone else who doesn't want to spend the time and wants to get ahead faster. And so I think that'll continue. But I think the issue was the ratio between the players who are there for purely play to earn relative there to play for fun. Right.
00:29:39.057 - 00:30:08.581, Speaker B: And so farming. Yeah. When you have, when it's overweight, there is no perfect ratio. I think it depends on the game. But you know, you can't have everyone producing assets to sell when there isn't enough offsetting demand from, you know, the players that want to use those assets without having to spend the time to farm them. And so I think it boils down to just the ratio which again goes back to is this game fun? Can it create a large audience? Because you kind of need that in order to get the flywheel going as well. Just be the supply side.
00:30:08.581 - 00:30:26.061, Speaker B: You can bootstrap it a little bit with incentives, but then it end up exacerbating the problem. Right. Because once you know, you just have too much supply then then it kind of ruins all the time that was spent. And yeah, so I think it'll always be there, but just to a different degree.
00:30:26.253 - 00:30:31.705, Speaker D: What is something that is very consensus today in crypto that you guys disagree with?
00:30:32.765 - 00:30:33.585, Speaker C: Damn.
00:30:36.635 - 00:31:17.487, Speaker B: I guess maybe it's not super consensus. We kind of gone back and forth on RL2's Bad for Eth. I think that's. I think the consensus now is that they are, but I don't necessarily think they are. The argument that they're bad is because they take away from demand for on chain activity. And so there goes your kind of burn narrative on eth. And so, yes, I think what ETH loses in terms of on chain fees, they more than make up for in terms of users that can actually use the chain, whether it's not first order chain, but on an L2.
00:31:17.487 - 00:31:41.979, Speaker B: And so it adds to the moneyness, I think, component of eth, of it being wanting to be widely held, widely used within the ecosystem. So what you lose on the very direct fundamental burn basis, I think you more than make up for on that side. And what's best for ETH is basically, you know, you need a viral app or many viral apps, and so you need shots on goal. And I think L2's increased the amount of shots on goal, which, yeah, I.
00:31:41.987 - 00:32:39.073, Speaker C: Think, yeah, I think we debate this a lot internally. And so I think like the other side though is if you're looking at it just from the fundamentals perspective, that may be the only, you know, downside for ETH from ltus. But I think the other like narrative perspective is that it takes away a lot of like the mind share around just building on one chain, right? There's so many different places to build and I think that's intimidating for a lot of devs where you have something like Solana in its current state, which is much easier, where you can just build there and, you know, all the users are right there. I think that trade off is where I think it gets a little dicier and I think why that's become consensus. So, yeah, I can kind of see both sides. I kind of think that, like, it has been very painful to eat in recent months. Although I think when you look at the three ecosystems that developers are really looking at right now, I'd say within eth, it's base, right? I think it's the top one that usually comes to mind with Coinbase's distribution.
00:32:39.073 - 00:33:14.401, Speaker C: You get a lot of good builders there. Then I think Solana, obviously, and then I think, I guess Telegram would be number three as far as the distribution they have. But I think the quality of builders, at least that we've seen there, have not been on par with the type of builders that you see on Solana or Base, which I think is also like, you know, an arbitrage where, you know, you will get some smart builders who see, hey, okay, there is a lot of distribution, the quality of builders. So the competition is way less fierce here. So it might like even out. But I think, like, you know, yeah, it's tough to say that that's 100% true. You know, there's like both sides.
00:33:14.473 - 00:33:16.445, Speaker B: I'd love to get your takes on that question.
00:33:16.905 - 00:33:17.921, Speaker D: Which question?
00:33:18.113 - 00:33:21.005, Speaker B: Something that's consensus that you disagree with.
00:33:22.265 - 00:34:05.533, Speaker D: Here's one. I think the consensus is starting to form around the idea that the only interesting consumer apps in crypto are the ones that have at least some elements of speculation and the more speculative the better. And the fundamental driving force behind that is the success of Pump and other speculative apps that generate a ton of revenue, very consistent revenue over time. And people love these products for sure. I think that Pendulum has actually swung too far in that direction. We were actually very much in favor of those speculative apps like maybe half a year ago when everyone was on the other side. And now I think the pendulum has swung too far in that side.
00:34:05.533 - 00:34:45.579, Speaker D: I think there's going to be a new wave of consumer apps that are going to take advantage of payment. I think crypto is really, really good for three types of payment. Irreversible payment, micro payment and cross border uncensorable payment. And these things are not possible with credit card and debit card. Because the problem with, I think there's two major problems with debt with credit card. One is credit cards charge a minimum transaction fee per transaction. So if you want to spend like a dollar as a merchant, you have to pay like 25 cents or something, which would be like 25%.
00:34:45.579 - 00:35:17.031, Speaker D: So micro payments are actually infeasible with credit cards. I think debit cards don't want to do micro payments either for other reasons. But that's one problem with credit cards. The other problem is chargebacks. So a lot of times this is really prevalent on gambling websites, online casinos. So you go and gamble, you lose money and then you call the credit card company, I made a mistake, I want my money back. And then the credit card company will actually give your money back at the expense of the merchant, so the merchant actually loses money.
00:35:17.031 - 00:35:53.055, Speaker D: So apparently somewhere between 10 to up to 40% of revenue of online casinos are ultimately going to those chargebacks, like paying back the credit card companies. But crypto does not have that problem because crypto payment is one way is irreversible. And so micro payment and irreversible payment. I think we're going to see a new type of apps that will take advantage of these two things. And I'll give you an example that I've been thinking about. I don't know if it's a Good idea or a bad idea. But I think it's an example that wasn't possible before, which is that.
00:35:53.055 - 00:36:15.445, Speaker D: So dating apps. So dating apps, I think is really interesting. I got married before Tinder, so I don't really know the due diligence. I didn't do the due diligence exactly. But we do have a founder who's working on dating apps and he's really knowledgeable. And he told me about the three key innovations in the history of dating apps. The first one is obviously Tinder swiping left and right.
00:36:15.445 - 00:36:55.911, Speaker D: Second one, third one is it called Bumble and Hinge, but I don't know which one is which. But one of them is the guy needs to message the girl first before swiping. And then the other one is the girl needs to start a conversation in order for the conversation to start. And if you really think about it, these two innovations are so trivial, but it creates a huge change in the consumer behavior. So in the case of when the guy has to message first, what it creates is more intentionality. Because on Tinder, guys just always swipe right. Right.
00:36:55.911 - 00:36:59.583, Speaker D: Like there's no upside to just run the treadmill. Yeah, exactly. Just run the treadmill.
00:36:59.639 - 00:37:00.751, Speaker A: It's like tapping on telegram.
00:37:00.783 - 00:37:01.167, Speaker B: Right.
00:37:01.271 - 00:37:03.347, Speaker D: Whereas. Exactly.
00:37:03.471 - 00:37:04.251, Speaker B: Attached to a drawer.
00:37:04.283 - 00:37:18.611, Speaker D: Yeah. You're basically hamster on. Yeah. But if you force the guy to message the girl first, then the guy has to think a little bit more. There's more intentionality, there's more interest. Like the girl the guy cannot always swipe right.
00:37:18.683 - 00:37:19.411, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:37:19.603 - 00:37:48.877, Speaker D: This little friction creates a lot of really good intentions and ultimately increases the likelihood of getting matched with a girl. So my idea with crypto is how do we increase intentionality even further? So one idea is stake a tiny amount of money. It doesn't have to be like $10. It could be like $0.10 or even $0.01. I don't know what the right number is, but if you get matched with a girl, you get the money back. If you don't get matched with a girl, you lose the money.
00:37:48.877 - 00:38:02.237, Speaker D: So this little change, I feel like it can really change the behavior of guys on dating apps, but it's just something I'm thinking out loud. But I think there will be other types of social apps that are based on these micro payments.
00:38:02.301 - 00:38:02.957, Speaker A: Money games.
00:38:03.061 - 00:38:04.149, Speaker D: Money games for sure.
00:38:04.277 - 00:38:07.141, Speaker C: There's. Have you guys talked to Moonwalk Fitness?
00:38:07.213 - 00:38:07.437, Speaker A: Yes.
00:38:07.461 - 00:38:26.515, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. So, so good friends with like, KW and everyone there. And I'm an angel, but I really like that concept. And basically for like, listeners who, you know, don't know it. Essentially, what it is, is. And the current version of it is, you know, players can sign up and say, hey, I'm gonna walk 10,000 steps this weekend. And they all kind of agree.
00:38:26.515 - 00:39:08.955, Speaker C: It can be 10 people, it can be 50 people, et cetera. Everyone locks in some amount of, you know, soul, whether it's $100, a thousand, et cetera. And if you do your 10,000 steps every day that week, you will, at minimum, get that money back, right? But then the rest of the money is distributed back at you. I think that concept is super interesting because you could kind of extract that for a lot of other healthy habits, right? Whether it's sleep, whether it's like, you know, a peloton competition. They already have these on the apps, and I think that's really interesting. I think another cool part about it is, especially if you get some of these crypto protocols who want to sponsor and get different types of users on. I think this is an app that is actually really good for a demographic outside of crypto.
00:39:08.955 - 00:39:49.665, Speaker C: Most people in crypto, hopefully are healthy, but a lot of them just sit inside behind a computer. Whereas one thing I was talking to their team about was, hey, we should sponsor girlfriend and wives of crypto, like, competition, right? Where, you know, all of us put our money up for our, you know, wives or girlfriends who, you know, are. You usually want to be healthy and, like, you know, want to do that. And I think that can help onboard way more women into the space and stuff like that. Or, you know, even my parents, for example, I told my. I told my mom that idea, and she's like, where do I sign up? You know, like, how do I sign up? So I think. Yeah, so I think it's very parallel to.
00:39:49.765 - 00:40:05.445, Speaker D: So in the case of Moonwalk, I don't. Sure, you can use credit card to do payments, but again, you can do small competitions with micropayments. And also, if you lose the competition, you may want to call the credit company and get the money back.
00:40:06.385 - 00:40:08.089, Speaker B: A little more embarrassing this time around.
00:40:08.177 - 00:40:08.617, Speaker A: A little bit more.
00:40:08.641 - 00:40:12.857, Speaker D: Yeah, exactly. A little more. So I think crypto can actually make a difference there.
00:40:12.921 - 00:40:14.365, Speaker C: Yeah, for sure.
00:40:14.785 - 00:41:03.981, Speaker A: One idea that I have, I think, consensus is that prediction markets are going to fail after poly market elections and that. And we talked to Nigel, who's the founder of FanDuel, and he said that, too. And then I've seen investors talk about, you know, they're getting tons of pitches around prediction markets, and it's going to all go to zero. I think it's the opposite. So we're working on a concept where, okay, so like there's two worlds, right? There's the world that we live in and there's a world that, that the younger generation lives in, like the Gen Alpha, Gen zers. And, and we're seeing some interesting macro changes. One change that we're seeing is the fact that we're seeing, you know, like LeBron James, Kevin Hart, Donald Trump, they're joining streams, streamers, right? So like Adam Ross is a part of Trump, right? You saw that stream kai Sonat with LeBron James.
00:41:03.981 - 00:41:44.183, Speaker A: And so what's interesting to me is that is the fact that old celebrities or old, like old school celebrities are starting to endorse this. Newer celebrities are up and coming. And what's even more interesting is that Gen Z, Gen Alpha are finding their own niche and like who they see as the future of celebrities. And so movies, if you look at the numbers in the movies, it's going down, streaming, going down in terms of movies, but streaming in terms of like Twitch Kick all time high. And so the question is, and then, so that was like one interesting data point. The second interesting data point is like betting and like betting in general is going up to the right. Like you saw the Instagram video.
00:41:44.183 - 00:42:25.813, Speaker A: Like we had some data that we were sharing with internally within alliance where it shows that people are more interested in betting, sports betting, et cetera, across the board, globally. So to me, actually what's interesting here is the fact that you could probably add a speculative layer on top of streaming such that you could stream and predict and try to play prediction markets on streamers as an example, whether it's, you know, I don't know if you saw like I show speed one of the streamers jumping over Ferrari. Like you could bet on that example. And so I think prediction market is going to stay. I think we're going to see some interesting interactive elements and it's going to be not for our generation, but for the newer generations.
00:42:25.949 - 00:42:58.685, Speaker C: No, it's funny you mentioned that. There's actually some, I forget what the company is called, but it should be easy to find. I believe in Asia, in India and stuff, there's like a company that at the end of a TV show it kind of like gets like it asks the audience, like, what do you think is going to happen? So it's a little bit more interactive. I think that builds on top of that. And actually so, you know, we, on the research side, we have, we do some consulting for probably like 15, 20 projects a year is max Most of these are crypto native just because they are way more fun to work with. They actually ship. Right.
00:42:58.685 - 00:43:37.233, Speaker C: But we work with some, you know, big Fortune 500 companies as well as like Web2 businesses. One that we were just talking to just last week actually is this pop culture prediction market. It already has a bunch of users around like 70, 100,000, you know, monthly users. No, not crypto at all. But they are exploring coming to crypto. But the cool part about it is it's basically a pop culture prediction market that is used primarily by women and females, which are the same thing, but essentially it's all right. Which essentially is like for certain things, like you know, Love Island.
00:43:37.233 - 00:43:38.345, Speaker C: Who do you think is going to be.
00:43:38.385 - 00:43:41.737, Speaker A: Oh dude, my wife would be all over that. Yeah, that like Kim Kardashian.
00:43:41.801 - 00:43:44.897, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. Or like, you know, Charlie xcx and tricky part of it.
00:43:44.961 - 00:43:46.137, Speaker B: How do you make a line for something?
00:43:46.201 - 00:44:00.303, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, that's what we were talking to them about. Like how do you make. Yeah, yeah. And right now they do very small bets. Right. So. And right now, man, like if you use this app, they have to go through like the whole sweepstakes loophole to not be like, hey, we're betting or gambling on this app.
00:44:00.303 - 00:44:18.235, Speaker C: App. So the UX is, you know, a little bit clunky, but it's still kind of insane to see all the hoops, you know, these women will like jump through to, you know, bet on this app and stuff like that. And right now the bets are very small, like usually 50 cents or something like that. But yeah, that, that's really interesting to us.
00:44:18.395 - 00:44:33.905, Speaker B: One thing we're leading on the. We let it. We're leading a deal called for a company called Contro. So yeah, I agree, I'm bullish. Prediction markets, I think the Poly market, I mean, yeah, the Poly market deal was a tricky one. I think at that VAL is. It was a 400 mil val.
00:44:33.905 - 00:44:51.473, Speaker B: I mean they timed it perfectly in terms of the raise. Right. You want to do it during election year when attention and all of that is at all time highs. But they have a tricky business model in the sense that they have to incentivize liquidity and it's pretty expensive because it's hard to market make that liquidity elsewhere.
00:44:51.529 - 00:44:51.721, Speaker D: Right.
00:44:51.753 - 00:45:11.203, Speaker B: Whereas you can, you can. It's easier when it's a very liquid asset that's in a lot of venues. But when there's only one place where it exists, it's expensive because it's hard for the market maker to be delta neutral. And so they're incentivizing quite a bit. So what contro is basically one of the innovations.
00:45:11.259 - 00:45:12.979, Speaker D: The incentivizing how? Just giving money.
00:45:13.027 - 00:45:13.547, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:45:13.691 - 00:45:14.659, Speaker A: For makers. Right.
00:45:14.707 - 00:45:22.371, Speaker B: It's just like VC money basically to market makers. Yeah. And it's like pretty expensive, you know, a lot more than kind of your standard.
00:45:22.443 - 00:45:25.955, Speaker A: Because they're a club, Right. Or they're using logarithmic.
00:45:26.075 - 00:45:35.467, Speaker B: No, they're club. They're club, yeah. With some underlying, like LP pool as well. But it's. Yeah, it's club. From the perspective of.
00:45:35.491 - 00:45:37.175, Speaker A: Do you know who these market makers are?
00:45:38.075 - 00:45:39.335, Speaker B: Honestly, I don't.
00:45:40.195 - 00:45:49.751, Speaker A: Yeah, I know. I feel like it's like, you know, if you remember like the NFT guys and Dr. Burry or something, I was thinking something like that because it's very bespoke exposure.
00:45:49.823 - 00:46:05.007, Speaker B: Right. It's not. So what this, these guys are doing is called something called a gradual limit order book glob. And so the idea is price. You're adding a time dimension to price. And so it doesn't. It kind of shifts over time.
00:46:05.007 - 00:46:33.011, Speaker B: As people participate and add liquidity and put their bets in, it gradually shifts. So part of what that enables is the initial bootstrapping. So the idea here is, you know, you have these Twitter spats and someone says, like, I wish I could make a market and like people could participate. And now the initial person can go out and create this market. Right. So they basically put up a certain amount of liquidity, saying, I will take all action. Like I'll take up to X dollars of action at this probability.
00:46:33.011 - 00:47:01.305, Speaker B: And then people can come in and put in the other side. And then it creates this pool that can shift back and forth based on people putting in rules around what they want to take, at what price, over what time. And so what we think is it'll really appeal to the long tail of bets. Right. Because what we need prediction markets to do is go beyond just presidential elections, which is where they've. They've seen a lion's share of their volume. And so being able to have this be long tail, bootstrappable by the bettors themselves.
00:47:01.305 - 00:47:10.885, Speaker B: And then I think that adds a very viral element to people as they start to post online. And you can, you know, you can immediately financialize a bet that was otherwise just purely.
00:47:10.965 - 00:47:14.865, Speaker D: So what part would exactly incentivize the long tail?
00:47:15.525 - 00:47:26.221, Speaker B: Because now you could spin up markets very easily. And so long tail of ideas. Yeah. So like long tail of bets that people are having or disagreements on Twitter. You want to put math like Put actual dollars behind it.
00:47:26.293 - 00:47:30.037, Speaker D: And it's because of the glob that enables this. Why?
00:47:30.141 - 00:48:01.733, Speaker B: Because basically it allows you to initially set up a market and say like for example. Yeah. So like the biology bet, right where I forget the order, but it was, he came in saying, I think it'll double at a million dollars. So you could put that on chain and then everyone else can come in and gradually fill and take the other side. And so over time, if people aren't necessarily taking the other side, the price starts to gravitate towards the less liquid side. And so basically.
00:48:01.909 - 00:48:04.645, Speaker D: So this doesn't require a liquidity provider.
00:48:04.805 - 00:48:24.465, Speaker B: No, the initial bet maker is the provider and then people can come in and take the other side. And so is this what Polymarkets are? No, no. So this is contro. This is like. Yeah. Something we're investing in that we're very bullish on. And yeah, I think, I think prediction markets make a lot of sense.
00:48:24.465 - 00:48:28.525, Speaker B: Right. It's just there needs to be, there are some frictions that we need to get around.
00:48:28.945 - 00:48:48.347, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that it's. The pricing mechanism is one. I think resolving is number two. Yep, that's a trick. And I think Umar protocol, it's okay. But you know, there's also a lot of, it's a lot of contention on certain bets because there's nuance that's required pricing. Resolving are the two.
00:48:48.347 - 00:48:48.771, Speaker A: I would say.
00:48:48.803 - 00:49:26.267, Speaker B: Yeah, resolving is a big one. I agree. And I think, you know, what they're kind of doing is you need, I think, an internal council with skin in the game, in the, in not in the market, but in the protocol. Because you know, you as a protocol owner are going to do the fairest thing because if you don't, then you're just hurting your business. Right. And so you need, there needs to be interest aligned between the success of the protocol, which is based on honest and fair resolutions, and the people that are making those judgments. And, and you can kind of put in elements where people can, you know, I want to stake X amount if I disagree with what's happening.
00:49:26.267 - 00:49:46.295, Speaker B: And you can have like step based escalation with penalties and, and, and such that if you're right, you get everything back. And so it's costless in that sense because we've seen it basically on everything that seems very vanilla already. It's just like on this technicality, it kind of breaks and things that shouldn't be disputed get disputed.
00:49:47.035 - 00:50:04.215, Speaker A: I've seen also a lot of mixed feelings around AI and crypto on the infra side. And I know you guys are pretty big proponents of AI and crypto, so I'm curious on your investment thesis. Probably is a good place to start and what are some of the bigger opportunities that people aren't seeing?
00:50:04.575 - 00:50:49.067, Speaker B: Yeah, I'd say like the two, two of the ones that we're very bullish on are noose, which is building a foundational model and then grass, which is basically a way to decentralize the ability for kind of web scraping and providing that data. Because that's one of the bigger issues with kind of how you input into these models. And so we think, you know, how can you benefit from the bottom up distributed nature of crypto and where does that kind of fit into the AI stack? Because there's like, you know, decent argument to be made that centralization is the most efficient form here. And so like, where are the elements that, you know, centralization doesn't help? And that's kind of how we're thinking about approaching investing in crypto and AI.
00:50:49.171 - 00:51:53.633, Speaker C: Yeah, and I think like when we, at least for me, like I was kind of thinking it was very buzzwordy and like, you know, I kind of expected there to be a narrative, but I thought it was a little bit too early for us to see like real applications or real usage of this stuff. We just released this report publicly, actually called the Tower in the Square, which is like part one of these AI series of how our research team and our ventures team is thinking about AI. And it kind of like really got me excited and made me realize this is going to happen much faster. Like, I don't know if you guys read that paper. Situational awareness about how like AGI is like, you know, probably less than a decade away. You know, something that, you know, our partner Jose constantly says is he thinks like everyone, even the biggest AI, like fans and investors are like very underexposed for that reality if that ends up happening. So I think like, as far as the intersection of AI and crypto, I think a couple of things that I've come around to is like, you know, we've always had this meme of like we're building to onboard, like millions of users.
00:51:53.633 - 00:52:15.589, Speaker C: And the reality might be that we've just been building the onboard millions of bots and these AI agents. And I think that could very well happen. And I think one thing that I think about too is all these AI agents, they're not going to like, you think we don't like the tradfi world, they're going to hate it. Whereas crypto is going to be much more their speed.
00:52:15.677 - 00:52:21.125, Speaker A: Can you explain what are the dynamics there, why there's so much friction with treasure?
00:52:21.165 - 00:52:43.857, Speaker C: Yeah. Think about it. Right? Sending a wire today. Right. I just sent one, like earlier this week or I thought, and then I realized it got canceled, and then yesterday I had to send it again. There's so much confirmations. There's so much, you know, like certain things that, you know, are not even on the, you know, JP Morgan's website that have to go get that information.
00:52:43.857 - 00:52:46.177, Speaker C: Go do it. It's so manual. Right.
00:52:46.281 - 00:52:55.505, Speaker D: By the way, my success rate of wire transfers over the last two, three years when the recipient has the word crypto or digital assets has gone down.
00:52:55.585 - 00:52:56.405, Speaker C: Oh, yeah.
00:52:56.825 - 00:53:03.525, Speaker D: It's been very obvious. And I use Chase as well. I don't know if I'm the only one, but last three years, it's, like, crazy.
00:53:03.825 - 00:53:33.679, Speaker C: Yeah. It's kind of insane, actually. I always say when people are, like, feeling bearish and stuff, like, if you're ever feeling bearish, just go to a bank and do any type of transaction and it'll make you more bullish on what we're doing here. Right. So that's one angle that I'm kind of, like, super excited about. And I think also on the flip side, I think, like, obviously right now a lot of the AI, like, focus has been around, like chatbots. I think AI will also be a much better way to use a lot of these crypto applications.
00:53:33.679 - 00:54:04.323, Speaker C: And I think, like, crypto obviously suffers from, like, UX and ui, like, all these wallets and stuff gets so complicated to use even for people like us who are, like, here 24 7. So I think that's also a huge opportunity. I don't know exactly how it's going to happen yet, but it's an area that I think is, like, definitely worth paying attention to and spending a lot of time on. And fortunately, you know, on our venture side, we have, like, Tom and Ken. On the research side, we have, like, Rossin, who just published that report, which, you know, DM me if you can't find it.
00:54:04.339 - 00:54:11.615, Speaker D: But it's like, I haven't read your report yet, but I'm sure you have the answer to this question. But which crypto AI product today has the most traction?
00:54:12.515 - 00:54:16.691, Speaker C: Which crypto AI project today has the most traction? What do you.
00:54:16.763 - 00:54:17.851, Speaker D: Early signs of product market?
00:54:17.923 - 00:54:38.007, Speaker C: Yeah, like, you know, so the second part of the report kind of walks into, you know, the. It's called, like, season. It's called, like, season. The means that one's not public yet. But, you know, if anyone's listening, DMS me, I'll send it to you. That one kind of goes into the current liquid market. I think the main takeaway there is, yes, it's still early, but, you know, they're promising.
00:54:38.007 - 00:54:58.561, Speaker C: Like, I think, you know, Tao is something that is constantly debated. I think there is, you know, and it's like hated coin. And I think people would think that, like the past behind it. And we have a lot of, you know, debates internally. I think Tom is like, very against it too. But I think, like, you can't underwrite that community and how much activity is actually there. And I think the incentives actually work.
00:54:58.561 - 00:55:26.277, Speaker C: We had a friend who is super sharp, and she was like, you know, like, I don't like Tao at all. I'm not gonna, you know, I don't think it's worth it. And then, you know, two, three weeks went by and she's like, wait, how much are those people making? I'm gonna go build on Tao now, you know. So, like, I think Tao is one that I think if in the public liquid market is interesting, we're not investors in it. I have a small bag, but it's more so to have skin in the game to keep tabs on it.
00:55:26.421 - 00:55:46.639, Speaker B: Tao is just kind of the. Oh, man, TradFi. AI based stuff is pumping. How do I get exposure in crypto? And it just became the consensus pick. But the problem is, obviously people like it because they can farm a lot of tao, get paid to basically improve their models. And so when you see a lot.
00:55:46.647 - 00:55:48.235, Speaker A: Of traders talking about it, that's when you.
00:55:51.975 - 00:55:52.855, Speaker B: Exit liquidity.
00:55:52.895 - 00:55:55.295, Speaker C: No, yeah, I'm now comedian.
00:55:55.335 - 00:55:57.995, Speaker A: I saw that with Tron. With the son of memes.
00:55:58.535 - 00:56:00.367, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, the new pump. His pump fund.
00:56:00.391 - 00:56:03.823, Speaker A: Yeah, pump fund on Tron. So every trader is talking about it right now.
00:56:03.879 - 00:56:04.303, Speaker C: Oh, wow.
00:56:04.359 - 00:56:06.383, Speaker D: The son of memes. That's the name of the product.
00:56:06.439 - 00:56:09.063, Speaker A: Yeah. Sun memes or something. Yeah.
00:56:09.079 - 00:56:12.183, Speaker C: You got to lean into it. Honestly, going to the sun, it's like.
00:56:12.199 - 00:56:13.383, Speaker A: Instead of going to the moon, you're going to.
00:56:13.439 - 00:56:20.555, Speaker C: Oh, that's so good. You're gonna get burned. Damn. I mean, at least they're being like, correct.
00:56:21.255 - 00:56:22.599, Speaker A: Well, at least it's being transparent.
00:56:22.647 - 00:56:27.623, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly, man. Damn, that's good. I gotta go Giant.
00:56:27.679 - 00:56:34.847, Speaker A: I mean, I mean. Yeah. So like, some of the coins, I think the first. I think Justin's dog went up to like 400 million.
00:56:34.911 - 00:56:37.447, Speaker C: Oh, of course. Yeah. I mean, that's worth like, ah.
00:56:37.471 - 00:56:39.955, Speaker B: We got to diversify into other dogs that he might have.
00:56:41.735 - 00:56:43.075, Speaker C: Does he have any cats?
00:56:44.525 - 00:56:54.813, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, somebody shared the Tron price chart recently. I was like, that thing looks great. Yeah, I have zero Tron bags. But like, I didn't realize that that chart looked as good as it did.
00:56:54.829 - 00:56:56.117, Speaker C: Yeah. We are underexposed.
00:56:56.261 - 00:56:57.373, Speaker A: We're all underexposed.
00:56:57.429 - 00:56:57.997, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:56:58.141 - 00:57:01.213, Speaker A: I mean, payments is doing really well on Tron.
00:57:01.269 - 00:57:02.765, Speaker C: Yeah. People actually use it. Right.
00:57:02.805 - 00:57:05.437, Speaker A: Because they don't trust tether or circle.
00:57:05.541 - 00:57:06.125, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:57:06.245 - 00:57:15.875, Speaker B: But there's a lot of USDT on Tron too. Yeah, that's one of the bigger. Yeah. I mean, it's hard to say how much of that volume is legit.
00:57:18.975 - 00:57:21.407, Speaker D: How much volume is Justin Sun's own money?
00:57:21.471 - 00:57:22.863, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sending it back.
00:57:22.879 - 00:57:53.355, Speaker B: And zero fees and. Yeah, no, yeah, he's 1:1. Well then the other stuff around AI has been kind of like the adjacent, you know, your renders and things that are more compute based rather than purely AI based. And so, you know, you can kind of see those gaining some attention and demand as, you know, you don't necessarily need to be. Right. You're just providing the means by which people can train. And so I think it ends up being kind of like more picks and shovels.
00:57:53.355 - 00:58:02.503, Speaker B: I do. There's going to be. There are quite a few more tokens that are coming to market pretty soon. So, you know, I think that'll probably eat away at some of the grass.
00:58:02.559 - 00:58:02.823, Speaker A: Right.
00:58:02.879 - 00:58:03.271, Speaker B: Yeah, grass.
00:58:03.303 - 00:58:04.471, Speaker A: We're going to have a token launch soon.
00:58:04.503 - 00:58:15.477, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. And that raised at a. At a. At a pretty rich vowel. That was most recent round was 500. So. Yeah, that'll be interesting.
00:58:15.501 - 00:58:17.757, Speaker C: But also consider that one kind of like deep in as well. Right?
00:58:17.821 - 00:58:18.869, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:58:18.917 - 00:58:19.781, Speaker A: Deep in AI.
00:58:19.893 - 00:58:22.869, Speaker C: Yeah. And you know, we, we definitely.
00:58:22.917 - 00:58:24.141, Speaker B: We did that round, by the way.
00:58:24.173 - 00:58:27.573, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Which. You didn't done that.
00:58:27.629 - 00:58:29.749, Speaker D: You didn't do that round, huh? You didn't do it that round.
00:58:29.837 - 00:58:30.205, Speaker B: We did.
00:58:30.245 - 00:58:30.781, Speaker D: You did. Okay.
00:58:30.813 - 00:58:31.705, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:58:32.065 - 00:59:09.209, Speaker C: But I think, you know, we have been spending more and more time on Deepin. We haven't made that many investments there, but I think it's an area that is really interesting. I also think from an onboarding perspective, it's actually like really, like really novel where the three ways I think about onboarding normies were like one, airdrops, two, meme coins and three, depend. And I think Deepin is actually the more interesting of the three because, you know, airdrops have become, you know, obviously everyone's like upset about them and you have to have a lot of capital for that too. Right. Meme Coins, you need less capital, but you still need capital. Whereas, you know, with some of these deepen projects, like grass, you can just, you know, download an extension and run it in the background.
00:59:09.209 - 00:59:23.937, Speaker C: So I have a bunch of my normie friends who are like, you know, using that and probably don't understand or know that they're going to get these tokens yet. I think that's, you know, really interesting where all of a sudden you get people onboarded in crypto without them having to put any capital up.
00:59:23.961 - 00:59:25.697, Speaker A: It's like Honey. Or was it Honey?
00:59:25.761 - 00:59:26.537, Speaker C: Yeah, right.
00:59:26.681 - 00:59:27.905, Speaker A: That went really viral and. Really.
00:59:27.945 - 00:59:31.539, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. So I think that's like, interesting.
00:59:31.667 - 00:59:32.467, Speaker D: Hivemapper.
00:59:32.531 - 00:59:35.571, Speaker A: No, no, honey, it's a web2app extension.
00:59:35.643 - 00:59:36.059, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:59:36.147 - 00:59:41.715, Speaker A: And you could browse and you earn like credits or something and like coupon codes based on.
00:59:41.755 - 00:59:42.931, Speaker B: Yeah, you get discount codes on everything.
00:59:42.963 - 00:59:46.011, Speaker A: You get discount codes. They ended up raising at a bill or something.
00:59:46.043 - 00:59:46.899, Speaker C: I think they got acquired.
00:59:46.987 - 00:59:47.579, Speaker A: They got acquired?
00:59:47.627 - 00:59:48.971, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, yeah, they were.
00:59:49.003 - 00:59:49.171, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:59:49.203 - 00:59:51.563, Speaker D: And the goal is to capture data.
00:59:51.659 - 00:59:53.979, Speaker A: Data. Like data of your shopping history.
00:59:54.027 - 00:59:54.571, Speaker C: Yes.
00:59:54.723 - 00:59:55.891, Speaker A: And you get like credits.
00:59:56.003 - 01:00:05.245, Speaker C: Basically. Like you're on, you know, you're checking out at Walmart or something, and all you have to do is click this extension and it's like, oh, we found this code that you can apply for 25% off or something like that.
01:00:05.705 - 01:00:08.089, Speaker B: And there's also the Honey Hive Mapper token.
01:00:08.137 - 01:00:09.545, Speaker D: Honey is the token for Hivemapper.
01:00:09.585 - 01:00:11.049, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:00:11.177 - 01:00:25.953, Speaker A: There's also Rakuten, and it's like a Japanese startup, but they're pretty big. Nakung government. But what they do is similar to what Honey does. They have affiliate links. You go in there and you get discounts and stuff like that. I do think there's a crypto angle to this.
01:00:26.009 - 01:00:28.647, Speaker D: Do you know what Rakuten stands for? Do you know what that means?
01:00:28.751 - 01:00:29.639, Speaker A: I don't know what that means.
01:00:29.687 - 01:00:42.487, Speaker D: So, like, it's actually Luk 10, but in Japanese it's Laku, like the Japanese pronunciation, lakuten. So Rakuten. But anyway, it's a huge. It's one of the biggest Japanese conglomerate.
01:00:42.551 - 01:00:43.595, Speaker C: Oh, wow. Damn.
01:00:44.735 - 01:00:51.315, Speaker A: But they're doing this too, so I do think there could be a crypto angle to this. We should think about it.
01:00:52.575 - 01:01:04.549, Speaker D: What data set does there. Does their grasp protocol team think is the most interesting? Because the token side, that's the supply side. What about the demand side? There's going to be people who want to buy that data.
01:01:04.597 - 01:01:05.093, Speaker A: Right.
01:01:05.229 - 01:01:10.585, Speaker D: What data sets do they find the most interesting? Or maybe what you think is the most Interesting.
01:01:11.085 - 01:01:53.515, Speaker B: The big barrier is the fact that there's a lot of anti bot measures for the scraping. So I think it's basically anything that has a good bot defense where it needs to be scraped via organic usage and can't be scraped by like a bot farm. And so I think kind of thinking about it almost that way, which in terms of like what data is the most scarce or most difficult to procure would be the most valuable. And so I think that kind of. Yeah, varies depending on websites and what protections they have against a lot of that stuff. And then there's like you need another protocol to kind of of organize it as well. And so yeah, there's obviously it's just raw information that isn't really as useful without a lot of characterization.
01:01:53.515 - 01:02:07.255, Speaker B: So there's you know, I think another element of the data supply chain basically. Yeah. Are there areas that you guys are excited about in the AI space or are you still. Yeah, a crypto AI, sorry, crypto AI.
01:02:07.995 - 01:02:23.297, Speaker A: I am on the consumer side. Crate is like a good example of that that I know you have some too. So the one I'll talk about is Crate, which is the ability to remix, create your own music using AI and then tokenizing that. Yeah.
01:02:23.321 - 01:02:56.405, Speaker C: How did that launch go? Because I met with Joey like the week before the launch, thought the ideas made a lot of sense. And you know, back then I think his, you know, his model of it was like having protocols like write dissongs to each other. It was like doing the Drake Kendrick beef or whatever. Right. So yeah, I thought it was pretty interesting. I definitely saw some songs the week up but I'm curious about like the retention and then. Yeah, like how do you continue? Because I think the hard part about, and this is what I was talking to him about is like the benefit is that it creates this coin with the ticker right.
01:02:56.405 - 01:03:31.955, Speaker C: Of the song because I think people's attention spans are so like short nowadays that the biggest disadvantage for him was the product that he was like making with these AI songs is even if it's 30 seconds to a minute, that takes way longer than using like a dog with a hat. Right. So I think like that was, you know, the hard part where your niche audience that you can kind of go after who has that attention span long enough to listen to, you know, five, 10 songs on this app is going to be much harder than being able to scroll, pumped out funds like ticker list or something like that.
01:03:32.075 - 01:04:10.635, Speaker A: So the way we, so we did the launch and we've learned a few things. One is there's a group of artists, there's a large group of artists that I would consider under the, under the SoundCloud. So if you look at the kind of music pipeline, it's like SoundCloud, you get virality through like social media like TikTok. Then the last is Spotify. And so it turns out a few things. One is people discover new music on TikTok and Instagram even though they don't like to say it. Like we've analyzed users likes and it turns out most of the time they discover new music on TikTok and then where do they listen? Spotify or Apple Music? That's where they listen.
01:04:10.635 - 01:04:33.159, Speaker A: SoundCloud is the area where we think is the most interesting because they're not doing that well and they're just using TikTok. People or artists are trying to use TikTok as a way to game the algo. So our thought process now is, you know, could we compete against SoundCloud in a way that is gamified and can create like a pump like experience?
01:04:33.247 - 01:04:34.751, Speaker D: What does SoundCloud even do?
01:04:34.903 - 01:04:44.743, Speaker A: It's just a music hosting platform and they have a network effect already of user listeners. And the goal is for up and coming artists to use SoundCloud as a way to kind of shill their.
01:04:44.879 - 01:04:47.319, Speaker D: So why is it different from Spotify?
01:04:47.487 - 01:04:49.407, Speaker A: I feel like SoundCloud is more like Dropbox.
01:04:49.471 - 01:05:15.325, Speaker C: Yeah. You can put it on like copyright like people put on remixes or mixes and stuff. So if you put it on a remix of like a Taylor Swift song on Spotify, you're going to get taken down on SoundCloud. You'll probably be able to be up and then there are plugins on top of it. Like I believe there's one called like Hype Edit or something like that which basically gates it. So it allows. It's like hey, you can only download this song if you comment or like or post your follows on Instagram.
01:05:15.325 - 01:05:19.805, Speaker C: So it ends up being really good to grow the following of an artist. Yep.
01:05:20.425 - 01:05:23.041, Speaker B: I like the timestamp based commenting.
01:05:23.193 - 01:05:24.065, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, that too.
01:05:24.105 - 01:05:24.673, Speaker A: When you first.
01:05:24.729 - 01:05:29.805, Speaker C: Yeah, Sound XYZ has that too. Right. When you like mince a song you can kind of comment.
01:05:29.885 - 01:05:31.637, Speaker B: Ron, say you comment on a certain part of the song.
01:05:31.661 - 01:05:32.825, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly, exactly.
01:05:36.445 - 01:05:38.885, Speaker B: You get to comment like a minute or second. 59.
01:05:38.925 - 01:05:40.149, Speaker A: Oh, I like this part.
01:05:40.277 - 01:05:41.173, Speaker B: That's a good idea.
01:05:41.269 - 01:05:43.973, Speaker C: Yeah, that SoundCloud does that like really well. Yeah, yeah.
01:05:44.109 - 01:06:16.329, Speaker A: So the idea there is like could we create both AI generated music and allow people to upload their own Music and be discovered. And the way we, we were thinking about is through like incentivized viral sharing. So like you pump a song and you click a pump and then you share it with all of your, on all of your socials and you get some incentives for sharing that. And then, you know, we only upload like snippet of a song and you can unlock it once you get enough views or something like that. We're still finalizing the final incentive model, but that's kind of the way we're thinking about it.
01:06:16.377 - 01:06:29.427, Speaker C: There are a lot of startups right now that are building in this intersection of, of incentivizing influencers or creators on Tick Tock to use certain songs, show certain objects and it's actually massive like.
01:06:29.491 - 01:06:31.251, Speaker A: It'S a whole like, like black market.
01:06:31.323 - 01:06:39.963, Speaker C: Yeah, it's a whole black market. Yeah. And you know, some people get paid, you know, a couple hundred bucks, but they pay, you know, 100 bucks to like a thousand influencers.
01:06:40.019 - 01:06:40.259, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:06:40.307 - 01:06:52.235, Speaker C: Or they pay like, you know, five influencers, like $5,000 who they think can you know, really kind of like, like push that song or push that narrative, whatever. Yeah, I think there's pitch hill, huh? Yeah, exactly, exactly.
01:06:52.895 - 01:06:58.927, Speaker A: I mean there's like a viral nation is like a big like these, there's consulting companies are everywhere now.
01:06:58.991 - 01:06:59.455, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:06:59.575 - 01:07:03.615, Speaker A: Like facilitating, you know, interaction between products and creators.
01:07:03.695 - 01:07:33.359, Speaker C: Yeah, for sure. I saw, I saw this platform that actually got disclosures manager is helping build and essentially like the data that they have is kind of insane where you can see exactly like which influencers have been the best for happy songs or sad songs or things like that. So you can really drill in and it's like. Or oh, they do like a long song or they talk about the song and it's in the background or the song is the focus. Right. So you can kind of like mix and match. Right.
01:07:33.359 - 01:07:38.663, Speaker C: And kind of like, you know, take a couple different tactics and kind of like get more bang for your buck possibly.
01:07:38.839 - 01:07:45.921, Speaker A: Yeah. So we're trying to crack that. Yeah, that's somewhere we're still iterating and we got a new name for a new viral fun.
01:07:45.993 - 01:07:47.005, Speaker C: No, I like it.
01:07:47.425 - 01:07:53.625, Speaker A: So the goal is if anyone wants to launch music and they want to go viral, you go to viral Fun and get discovered.
01:07:53.745 - 01:07:55.297, Speaker C: No, that makes sense. I like it.
01:07:55.401 - 01:07:59.609, Speaker A: So you had some AI, like AI Gen, like AI Girlfriend.
01:07:59.777 - 01:08:00.485, Speaker D: Remember?
01:08:00.785 - 01:08:04.585, Speaker C: Yeah, man, you do a lot of testing. Everything okay.
01:08:04.705 - 01:08:05.673, Speaker D: Like two diligence.
01:08:05.729 - 01:08:10.295, Speaker C: Yeah. You got all the dating apps, you got AI Girlfriends.
01:08:12.635 - 01:08:29.935, Speaker D: I think there's going to Be some apps on the app side that will sit at the intersection of AI and crypto. On the consumer side, I don't know what the right configuration is, but there is something there. Generate AI is just really good for creators and then crypto is just really good for getting something go viral.
01:08:30.795 - 01:08:31.895, Speaker A: Invalidation.
01:08:32.315 - 01:08:33.285, Speaker C: Yeah, for sure.
01:08:33.435 - 01:09:01.310, Speaker D: I don't know what the right configuration, but I'm interested in that area. Nothing really excites me so far, but I'm paying very close attention on the infra side. So broad categories is data, that's grass, and then compute. And then you could argue that compute is low level, high level. Low level is providing GPUs. High level is providing straight up inference or training. Training doesn't really make sense, but that's a different story.
01:09:01.310 - 01:09:43.243, Speaker D: And then there's like all these AI oracles like zkml, opml. These are yet another bucket. In general, I'm skeptical, especially decentralized compute. I think it's. I have a very strong argument against decentralized GPUs is that the thesis is by leveraging the latent hardware, the latent GPUs from a laptop or the GPUs are used for ethereum mining, you can reduce the cost. You can ultimately pass some of the savings back to the users, basically providing cheaper service. Empirically, that's just not the case.
01:09:43.243 - 01:10:11.304, Speaker D: Empirically, what does provide help provide cheaper service is not decentralization, it's centralization. It's economy of scale. It's the ability to Procure the latest GPUs and put them all in one place, reduce latencies between the GPUs and then because you have economy of scale, you can procure those GPUs at a cheaper price than the average consumer can. So I'm extremely skeptical of decentralized compute.
01:10:11.884 - 01:10:13.524, Speaker A: Purely from a latency perspective, right?
01:10:13.564 - 01:10:15.900, Speaker D: No, no, no, no. It's latency. It's also economy of scale.
01:10:15.932 - 01:10:16.628, Speaker C: Economy of scale?
01:10:16.756 - 01:10:45.395, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, like, I don't know if you guys watched the Peter Thiel Joe Rogan podcast. I mean, I watched snippets of it, but he talked about how AI has to be highly centralized and that's going to be primarily in like both network effects in San Francisco and the infrastructure is going to be highly centralized. And he sees crypto as a highly decentralized, completely libertarian versus communism. And that's the way it plays. So go ahead.
01:10:46.335 - 01:11:19.583, Speaker D: So it's economist scale latency between the GPUs. But there is another really strong argument, which is that if you think about Airbnb. And Then like decentralized GPUs is basically Airbnb or Uber, but with GPUs. But there is a fundamental difference between the two, is that houses and cars, they don't follow Moore's Law, they don't improve every. Like, they don't double in terms of power every couple of years. GPUs, they go outdated every six months. Every six months, Nvidia releases a new generation of GPUs, and then all of a sudden the older ones are just outdated.
01:11:19.583 - 01:11:36.107, Speaker D: They're not fast enough anymore and they're not cheap enough anymore. And now you want to use these old GPUs sitting in your laptop. They're not going to be as competitive as the latest generation. So Moore's Law is the key difference between Airbnb and decentralized GPUs.
01:11:36.291 - 01:11:42.483, Speaker A: What use cases could we see decentralized compute for like, let's just say you get all the high process.
01:11:42.539 - 01:12:14.289, Speaker D: Oh. So the idea of provide the thesis that decentralized GPUs provide cheaper service, I don't buy that. I think it's just, it doesn't work. But there's one potential use case for decentralized GPUs, which is censorship resistance. That could make sense because if I look at like, so Eric Voorhees released his Venice, right? Venice AI and under the hood he uses, among other GPU providers, he uses Morpheus, right?
01:12:14.427 - 01:12:15.485, Speaker C: Is that Morpheus?
01:12:15.605 - 01:12:41.385, Speaker D: No, it's Venice. Okay, it's called Venice. But they use a cache among other GPU providers. And the reason he stated that, his stated reason is it's decentralized and therefore censorship resistance. No one can censor my inference requests. Right. Which has happened in some shape or form with OpenAI and Gemini, et cetera, et cetera.
01:12:41.385 - 01:12:44.343, Speaker D: So, so I buy that thesis.
01:12:44.479 - 01:12:55.591, Speaker A: I feel like there will be. I don't know exactly what is consensus right now, but I do feel like censorship resistance is like one area. Especially with foundation models.
01:12:55.783 - 01:13:04.687, Speaker B: Yeah, especially you're seeing how like you're getting, you know, non neutral responses in certain situations that are, you know, based on the.
01:13:04.831 - 01:13:08.575, Speaker A: Whether it's like biased model. Yeah, like with ChatGPT.
01:13:08.735 - 01:13:19.045, Speaker B: Yeah, it's just like the bias of the people adjusting the model. Whether it's conscious or subconscious, it's going to represent their internal beliefs as they make their tweaks.
01:13:19.165 - 01:13:43.273, Speaker D: But then the counter to that counter is, well, there's more than one way to achieve censorship resistance. One is decentralize the providers, but another way is just running Open source models on your own device, you can't choose which model you want to run. And as the open source models become more and more performant, more and more those models can be run on your local device as opposed to be on the cloud.
01:13:43.329 - 01:13:48.153, Speaker C: Yeah, I remember you talking about this. Wasn't there a project that you were looking at that was doing this XO xl. Got it.
01:13:48.169 - 01:13:55.601, Speaker D: Yeah. Yeah. So they are able to hack the latest Llama model in such a way that it can run on iPhone.
01:13:55.633 - 01:13:57.169, Speaker C: Yeah, that's really interesting to me for sure.
01:13:57.217 - 01:14:01.881, Speaker D: Yeah. That feels like a more pragmatic solution to the censorship resistance.
01:14:01.953 - 01:14:02.565, Speaker A: Yes.
01:14:03.545 - 01:14:05.673, Speaker B: Also, the privacy element too is a big one.
01:14:05.729 - 01:14:35.215, Speaker D: Privacy and privacy. I realized that privacy, the kind of user segment for whom privacy really matters is corporation. Is companies. Most individuals don't care about privacy, but it's the companies that do. And I realized this when ChatGPT first came out. I wrote a bot that analyzed my telegram messages with our founders so that every day gives me the top things I need to respond. And as soon as I released that bot, I realized, holy shit, I'm sending all these messages to OpenAI.
01:14:35.215 - 01:14:39.175, Speaker D: I should stop doing this. So privacy, it matters to me.
01:14:40.595 - 01:14:52.019, Speaker C: Open AI starts blockchain accelerator. Yeah. What else are you guys seeing in the market right now? Or what's most exciting to you guys? You guys just started your new cohort, right?
01:14:52.107 - 01:15:38.151, Speaker D: Yeah, we have a lot of startups experimenting with new consumer apps that create new consumer behaviors. Yeah, that was impossible before crypto. I don't know where they're going exactly, but there's a bunch of experiments that are really like the dating one, or in general, the ability to leverage the micropayment and the irreversible payment aspect of crypto in the context of consumer apps. I think that's super interesting. Another one that's interesting is leveraging ZK to prove certain online identity. And I'll give you the most absurd or the most extreme, but in hindsight, pretty obvious example is on dating apps. Again, I'm talking about dating apps.
01:15:38.151 - 01:15:39.111, Speaker D: Jesus Christ.
01:15:39.263 - 01:15:40.719, Speaker A: But there's a real need there, Chow.
01:15:40.807 - 01:15:53.663, Speaker D: Prove your net worth. Prove your net worth using zk. I mean, as a first step, you can use ZK to prove your on chain net worth. But also there are some of the latest zk, what's it called? Tls.
01:15:53.719 - 01:15:54.111, Speaker A: Tls?
01:15:54.143 - 01:16:19.195, Speaker D: Yeah, that you can use ZK to prove that when you serve a website like let's say Your bank account, Chase.com, you log in and then that technology can prove how much money you have in the bank, in your bank account and then generate a proof and then like I'm giving you a very extreme example of net worth. But there's other types of identity that you can prove. For example, your affiliation with certain.
01:16:21.895 - 01:16:23.415, Speaker A: Schools or whatever achievements.
01:16:23.495 - 01:17:01.873, Speaker D: So blind is a really good web2 example. Blind is a website where basically employees talk shit about their employer and share sensitive information like their salary. People really want to know how much other their co workers are getting paid. So they go to Blind and they can ask like, and they can ask the questions about the salary and et cetera. But the only identity you know about the person who answers your question is their employer. And the way they verify employment is looking at the corporate email. But there's probably other types of identity that can only be proven with ZK rather than with an email.
01:17:01.929 - 01:17:12.165, Speaker B: For example there do they verify through ZK the salary or is it an honor system? So there's game theory over what you should actually say and versus what the truth is.
01:17:12.545 - 01:17:29.753, Speaker D: Okay, so that's another really interesting area I'm thinking about. I don't know how practical that is, but there could be a type of new apps. It's like a spy network or sensitive information network, Information sharing network. In Web2 it's GLG. It's like people time.
01:17:29.769 - 01:17:30.697, Speaker A: That fun? Yeah.
01:17:30.841 - 01:17:59.245, Speaker D: People find experts on their website and then ask them potentially questions about very sensitive information. But maybe with zk, maybe it's possible to build an app leveraging ZK in such a way that you know, if you're in the possession of a really sensitive information, but you want to get paid before revealing the information. Like what do you, how do you do that? You can use ZK to potentially prove that you're in the possession of that information without reviewing it. You get paid and then you review the information.
01:17:59.405 - 01:18:00.093, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:18:00.229 - 01:18:01.149, Speaker D: Some kind of spy.
01:18:01.237 - 01:18:04.629, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess it had to be very niche on the type of information. Right?
01:18:04.677 - 01:18:19.719, Speaker D: It has to be very niche. But being very niche, some of the niche pieces of information are potentially very, very valuable. So think about it. Just thinking out loud, I don't know how practical that is, but something I'm paying attention to some of the other.
01:18:19.767 - 01:19:11.709, Speaker A: Areas that we're excited about Deepin. So you know, AI is going to probably increase the price of energy over the next three to five years. And so we have a Deepin energy startup that effectively sells you plugs that will analyze your energy output and will like connect with the grid. And then when grid price are starting to creep up, you could turn off certain types of machines, it'll automatically turn it off for you to help you save, save money on your bill. So it's funny, like, I just got my electrical bill yesterday or like a week ago, and it was 30% increase. And my wife's like, what the fuck is going on? I'm like, AI. But I do think this is going to become even more like people are going to pay attention to energy bill.
01:19:11.877 - 01:19:43.107, Speaker D: There's two fundamental very big driving forces behind your electrical bills in the coming, let's say, call it two years. One is the AI is the data centers. Everyone's talking, everyone knows the story, but the other one is just renewable energy. Because wind and solar, they're volatile, they're unstable. You don't get sun every day, you don't get wind every day. So the more renewable energy the grid depends on, the less stable the energy supply is. So what ultimately matters in energy supply is peak usage.
01:19:43.107 - 01:20:25.285, Speaker D: It's not average usage, it's peak usage. Because peak usage is when the grid goes down and you run out of power, there's a power outage. So the instability and the increase from AI demand means that in the coming couple of years, we could see a lot of power outages. And so one way to solve that is they call it the VPP virtual power plant. The way it works. And this exists in Web two, it's not a pure crypto thing. But in Web two you have these startups or companies that try to aggregate edge devices, edge energy devices, such as your Tesla, like Tesla's car, but also the Tesla home battery, but also the plug that you mentioned.
01:20:25.285 - 01:21:35.383, Speaker D: The plug things that use energy, but also can potentially give energy back to the grid. So if you have a battery at home, it stores energy, it can potentially give energy back to the grid, effectively selling energy, effectively selling the energy back to the grid. So basically you create this network that controls all these different edge devices to ultimately stabilize grid usage. So, for example, when there's a lot of usage, when supply is exceeds, when demand exceeds supply, this VPP can tell every node or every household in this network to automatically either sell the energy from their battery back to the grid, or stop charging their Tesla car, or turn down your ac, like using the plug, the smart plug. And that's basically what a VPP is. But the problem with these Web2VPPs is it's really, really hard to bootstrap the network. People don't have that much of an incentive to install these plugs or to connect their Tesla cars to this network.
01:21:35.479 - 01:21:44.227, Speaker A: And they're not even savvy enough. Right. I just feel like, like there's a lack of, like every person I've spoken to so far, they, they haven't heard of any of this.
01:21:44.291 - 01:21:44.843, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah.
01:21:44.899 - 01:21:46.011, Speaker A: So I feel like there's also an.
01:21:46.043 - 01:21:48.467, Speaker D: Educational, there's, there's definitely education problem.
01:21:48.571 - 01:21:54.315, Speaker A: And I do think like having some sort of way to incentivize this type of growth can propel the growth of this industry.
01:21:54.395 - 01:21:56.211, Speaker D: I, I think crypto is perfect for this.
01:21:56.323 - 01:22:01.771, Speaker B: Are you selling back to only other plug users or can you sell back to the, to the, like you sell.
01:22:01.803 - 01:22:04.451, Speaker D: Back to the grid, the, the, the, the, the energy supplier.
01:22:04.523 - 01:22:05.789, Speaker A: You're the buyer of last resort.
01:22:05.907 - 01:22:14.785, Speaker B: So yeah, I guess the reason for that question was just to understand what are the network effect elements of the plug or it seems like you are.
01:22:14.865 - 01:22:43.691, Speaker A: Just, you're buying these devices, right. You're plugging into all of your appliances and it'll communicate with the grid and will effectively turn it on and off. You get points as you're contributing to the data. And essentially the network effects is the more data that you get, the more control you have over appliances and then you can create this like effectively think of it as like clusters of energy and when things go higher, then you're effectively controlling the supply. Right, of energy output.
01:22:43.883 - 01:22:45.235, Speaker B: Yeah, no, and more so.
01:22:45.275 - 01:23:19.849, Speaker A: And then you're getting, you know, and then obviously the users are getting tokens as an incentive model. But that's like layer one, the L2 is the batteries. So they've already manufactured batteries that will sell into these device home households. And effectively the way you want to think about is that, you know, you get energy off peak times and you store it and then essentially the house with all the plugs will rely on that energy when things go really expensive. So it's like a power plant, but it's an incentivized power plant.
01:23:20.017 - 01:23:47.915, Speaker B: And yeah, no, that makes a lot of sense. And honestly the network effects question was not meant as like a slight, but more as like a pro in the sense that, so with DePin, a lot of these, I guess using helium as an example, you need network effects for the project to work because connected devices, right? So like you have a cold star problem, whereas here it's you versus the grid. So as long as you're doing it, you're basically maximizing the benefits of it. You don't necessarily need everyone else to adopt it for you to really get the benefits kind of thing.
01:23:48.615 - 01:24:25.825, Speaker D: The ultimate benefit is actually for the utility company and ultimately for everyone in that network, basically. The network effect is the more of these edge devices the utility company or the energy supplier can control, the more they're able to stabilize the energy supply and demand in clusters. Yeah, exactly. That makes sense. And they have an incentive to do this and obviously by definition, by the very nature of their business, and then ultimately they can pass some of those savings back to these individual nodes in the network. So ultimately the consumers have a financial incentive to do this as well.
01:24:26.235 - 01:24:46.331, Speaker A: I feel like this is one of the devices, it's called Star Power, but it's like one of the first startups that I've seen that actually delivers some sort of benefit outside of just tokens. Right. I mean, obviously helium does too, and there's others that do it, but like seeing a financial bill and it reduces your bill every month immediately, it's like immediate and you're getting paid on top. Right.
01:24:46.363 - 01:24:47.379, Speaker B: So it's nice.
01:24:47.547 - 01:24:50.419, Speaker A: It's an interesting concept that one of.
01:24:50.427 - 01:25:07.645, Speaker B: The positives of that came out of COVID is everyone's kind of trying to build more towards the individual resilience and less reliance on like the supply or supply chain or the grid or whatever it might be that normally I saw a stat that's like 10% of Americans have their own chicken coops.
01:25:07.765 - 01:25:12.305, Speaker A: Yeah. Don't you have one? Or you're about to get one chicken coop?
01:25:12.605 - 01:25:15.413, Speaker D: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm about to get one for my daughter.
01:25:15.469 - 01:25:15.989, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:25:16.117 - 01:25:20.669, Speaker B: Yeah. It's nuts. So it's like, makes a lot of sense. Yeah, yeah. But if you're. If you're actually able to do it. Right.
01:25:20.669 - 01:25:34.981, Speaker B: Because the crazy thing about that stat is, you know that that includes all households. Like, you obviously have to remove from the denominator everyone who's in a condo or in an apartment. So the actual, like home thing is a much higher number. Like the percent, a lot higher.
01:25:35.093 - 01:25:39.505, Speaker A: Why is that? Like, why? Like, I mean, it's interesting. It's an interesting stat.
01:25:40.205 - 01:25:41.253, Speaker B: Yeah. I honestly.
01:25:41.309 - 01:25:42.133, Speaker A: More individualism.
01:25:42.189 - 01:25:47.733, Speaker B: Right. Like, yeah. And just. I think there's also distrust in, in food companies and what they're doing.
01:25:47.829 - 01:25:48.545, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:25:49.325 - 01:25:53.605, Speaker B: And seeing all that stuff come out and like, you know, just people kind of opening their eyes to a lot of this stuff.
01:25:53.645 - 01:26:30.239, Speaker A: And you know what's also interesting? I guess I'm gonna go off tangent a bit, but, like, it seems like Jen's years are more distrustful and even gen Alpha, they're. Cho and I talked about this, but, you know, we're seeing some interesting stats, which is like they don't believe anything in the media anymore. Like, we were already kind of skeptical, but they completely disregard it. And in fact, they're going the other way and they're embracing the things that they don't talk about. I think you and I talked about remilias and all this stuff, like subcultures of ladies, but it seems like they're embracing racism as it is. Like, have you seen that?
01:26:30.287 - 01:26:32.835, Speaker B: Like, yeah, I mean, it's a lot more prevalent. Yeah.
01:26:34.095 - 01:26:48.557, Speaker A: It's just interesting that, like, you know, you have this distrust in the government, you have distrust in the media. You know, like our generation, like millennials and like early millennials, we, like, don't trust them that much. But, you know, it's like, I think.
01:26:48.581 - 01:26:51.397, Speaker C: Once it goes to all the way to this side, it has to swing back.
01:26:51.461 - 01:26:51.821, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:26:51.893 - 01:27:07.345, Speaker C: Right. And at their very core, like, the, you know, when you're growing up, you want to rebel. And I think, like, just being, you know, constantly, especially them. Right. Like millennials, we grew up without phones for a good fortune of our lives. We were able to have a childhood and everything like that. This.
01:27:07.345 - 01:27:24.985, Speaker C: But when they were growing up, their brains were immediately just, you know, just sent into this, like, dopamine factory of just like, here's what we want you to see. Here's how we want you to think. Here's what we want you to do. And then. So, yeah, I'm not surprised that they want to rebel. Yeah. The racism is definitely crazy.
01:27:24.985 - 01:27:25.297, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:27:25.361 - 01:27:27.801, Speaker A: They're like gwh. If you follow them.
01:27:27.913 - 01:27:28.537, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:27:28.681 - 01:27:32.485, Speaker A: I mean, like. Like, what the are they talking about?
01:27:32.985 - 01:27:36.307, Speaker B: Yeah. Like a combination of being terminally online.
01:27:36.411 - 01:27:36.803, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:27:36.859 - 01:27:39.219, Speaker B: Anonymous. And getting a lot like.
01:27:39.267 - 01:27:39.851, Speaker A: Like engagement.
01:27:39.923 - 01:27:52.251, Speaker B: A lot of engagement from that stuff too. It's just like, it's kind of responding to engagement, which is so bearish on that front. Right. It's like, how many people are kind of close because, like, you know, cloud chasers. Cloud chasers. Right. And they're just stoking the fires.
01:27:52.251 - 01:28:14.889, Speaker B: Right. Like, then the people who are actually believing in it are like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, there's a bigger audience. And. Yeah, I guess one of the issues of, you know, everyone being online is before, if you were kind of fringe, you were. It was hard for you to find, like, minded people. And so, you know, your fringe beliefs that were pretty, you know, not great, start to die off, but here you can always find others because also, like, what's the.
01:28:14.937 - 01:28:28.205, Speaker C: You know, if you really want to go viral, racism is, like, one of the easiest ways to guarantee it. Right. So, like, if that has, like, been become a huge incentive it's like, all right, I'm just going to be racist. And, like, now I can go viral. And, oh, by the way, here's my new mixtape. You know.
01:28:28.955 - 01:28:39.731, Speaker A: Yeah, it's. It's a very interesting world that we're entering into. Yeah, but, yeah, I know we're at time, but any final thoughts, words before we head out?
01:28:39.923 - 01:28:41.375, Speaker C: No. Yeah. Thanks for having us.
01:28:41.955 - 01:28:44.175, Speaker A: I would have kept going, but I know we're.
01:28:44.475 - 01:28:45.255, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:28:46.315 - 01:28:47.595, Speaker A: But, yeah, thanks for joining us.
01:28:47.635 - 01:28:59.151, Speaker C: Yeah, I appreciate it. And you guys have been crushing. It's been, like, great to be, you know, listening to the pod and also, like, all the, obviously, applications went to your office last week. The energy there, you can kind of feel it. It's awesome. Yeah.
01:28:59.263 - 01:29:06.487, Speaker A: Nice. I mean, obviously, like, you guys have always been crushing it, so, I mean, we. We still, like, I think we debate on your research stuff all the time. Yeah.
01:29:06.511 - 01:29:06.983, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:29:07.119 - 01:29:08.127, Speaker C: Glad to hear that. Yeah.
