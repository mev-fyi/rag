00:00:00.200 - 00:00:40.974, Speaker A: My current mental model is in the next decade, we're actually going to see a long run decoupling between two categories of crypto, the commodity crypto and the growth crypto. And if the inflationary story proves to be correct, then the commodity crypto will do really well, will outperform the growth crypto and commodity crypto basically means bitcoin and possibly ethereum. Likely ethereum. I would say the problem with ethereum is the supply is somewhat driven by the growth on ethereum. Right. The activities happening on ethereum. More activities means more fees, more ETH getting burned, and ultimately more deflationary supply.
00:00:40.974 - 00:00:52.374, Speaker A: So ETH is somewhat driven by growth, but it's also a commodity. And everything else is so early stage that I would consider them as quote unquote growth crypto.
