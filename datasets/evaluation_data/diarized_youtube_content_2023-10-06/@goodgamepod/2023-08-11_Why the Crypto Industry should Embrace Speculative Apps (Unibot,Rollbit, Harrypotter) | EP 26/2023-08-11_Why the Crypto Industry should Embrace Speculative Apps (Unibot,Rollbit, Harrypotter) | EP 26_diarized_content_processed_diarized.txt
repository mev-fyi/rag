00:00:00.400 - 00:00:20.809, Speaker A: Welcome to Goodgame. Your no BS insights for crypto founders, okay, Every sector has a superpower. Healthcare is about saving lives. If you look at the movie industry, it's about telling a very compelling story for crypto. What is that? Is it speculation?
00:00:20.977 - 00:00:38.823, Speaker B: I mean, for now, yes. The number one thing is speculation. Number two thing for me is entertainment. Like Obama, Sonic, Harry Potter, bald. Like all these people doing social trading in Telegram, sending memes around and then people talking about them on Twitter. That's entertainment for me. So for now, these are the most, the two most important things could change in the future.
00:00:38.919 - 00:01:42.533, Speaker A: Why is it speculation though? Looking for your next startup idea in crypto, Check out our request for startups list and get inspired at Alliance XYZ Ideas. Welcome to Good Game. Today we're going to be speaking about one of the industries where we think is going to first take off in crypto and that's gambling speculation. We talked a lot about speculation over the past few podcasts and in fact I actually forgot to tell you this Chao, but I've had a bunch of listeners that had asked us about speculation generally and I've seen a few tweets also recently at you Twitter on Twitter chow where they talked about how they agree with speculation and how both crypto investors and founders should be embracing speculation versus pushing against it. And I know you had some thoughts around this and I'd love to talk more about, you know, generally what we're seeing today, but historically what we've seen over the past decade. And I'll throw out a couple terms before we get Chow's thoughts on the space, but Harry Potter, Sonic 10inu well.
00:01:42.549 - 00:01:44.709, Speaker B: You forgot Obama again.
00:01:44.757 - 00:02:19.261, Speaker A: Harry Potter, Obama, Sonic 10inu I'll tell you how this meme started too, which I think it's great. Okay, we're starting to see telegram bots, unibot. There's at least another 25 bots that have come out, loot bot, et cetera, et cetera. We'll talk a little bit about the speculative mania that's starting with that and then we'll talk more about like memes, Pepe and others and just kind of dive deep historically on all of this. And so maybe before we get started, let's talk about your thoughts and then I'll give you a couple of my thoughts and break it down.
00:02:19.333 - 00:03:25.677, Speaker B: So to your point, I also got a lot of DMS after our last episode where we actually only very briefly talked about speculation and a lot of our listeners actually wanted us to talk about speculation a bit more by Speculation, I mean the general theme of, you know, gambling, shitcoin trading, you know, even NFT as shitcoins, that kind of stuff. It feels like most serious people in crypto are too embarrassed to talk about this topic. Obviously we consider ourselves as serious people, but precisely for this reason we want to talk about it. And we want to talk about it because I feel like there's just a huge divide between the shitcoiners and then the super like hardcore technical people, right? Like there's like two very distinct communities within crypto. One is like the Shiquan retail traders on the anons on crypto Twitter and the other ones are the super technical builders and then the vcs, you know, the crypto elites. Right. Like there's a divide between the crypto plebs and the crypto elite.
00:03:25.781 - 00:03:52.655, Speaker A: There's even a divide on the newer sectors like NFTs. Like there was a recent tweet I shared with you, Chow where I forgot her name, but she used to be a dev rel at a startup. But she said like, I don't understand the trading community. I don't understand the Harry Potter, Obama, Sonic and Inu meme. And she goes, in fact, I don't even understand NFT communities. So it's something very important that you're touching on there.
00:03:52.955 - 00:04:18.449, Speaker B: So these communities don't really understand each other, especially the quote unquote crypto elite don't understand the crypto plebs. And so that's why we want to talk about this because that's where the users are. The users are the people who are trading shitcoins today. And the builders and the elites and the super technical people, they're too detached from this world. They're too detached from the real user base of crypto today. So that's why I want to talk about this.
00:04:18.537 - 00:05:20.165, Speaker A: Yeah, and I did some research and obviously we've been in a space probably now a decade, so we're pretty much boomers at this point. But some fun facts that I thought was interesting for us to know, at least for listeners that just came into crypto is the fact that if you look at one of the first apps that was built on bitcoin was called Satoshi Dice, which is a gambling app. And at one point it took up 50% of all of bitcoin's transaction. And a lot of the technical folks, people that really believed in the bitcoin is money narrative, hated this. There was a funny video I shared with you yesterday, it was posted 10 years ago, but it was some, you Know, one of the, you know, bitcoin is money maxi groups and he recorded a video and he said like, I hate speculation on bitcoin because bitcoin is not about speculation, it is money. And I feel like it still perpetuates today. Like, you know, people believe that it is the future of money, which in some regard it is.
00:05:20.165 - 00:05:26.925, Speaker A: But if you want real world utility, you know, we gotta talk about the speculative piece because that is the piece that's gonna bring people into the space.
00:05:27.005 - 00:05:43.169, Speaker B: By the way, that argument in itself that bitcoin is money, not speculation, that in itself is self contradict because money is by definition speculative. You want bitcoin as your money because you speculate that the fiat monies are bad.
00:05:43.257 - 00:05:43.569, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:05:43.617 - 00:05:51.005, Speaker B: So by nature it's speculation. But anyway, Satoshi Dice is, I would say at this point is a legend.
00:05:51.625 - 00:05:52.445, Speaker A: Legend.
00:05:53.385 - 00:06:05.675, Speaker B: Eric Voorhees, he's also one of the legends. He's the creator of Satoshi Dice and he sold that, that website. Satoshi dies I think 2013 for.
00:06:05.795 - 00:06:09.971, Speaker A: I forgot the exact number, but 120,000 bitcoins.
00:06:10.083 - 00:06:20.339, Speaker B: Yes, you heard it right, over 100,000 bitcoin, not dollars. So at that time it was worth like $10 million. And at today's price, I don't know.
00:06:20.387 - 00:06:25.095, Speaker A: Like what is it, 2 billion, 3 billion? Yeah, yeah, something crazy like that.
00:06:25.515 - 00:06:48.751, Speaker B: But Eric, Eric is actually like just some history. Eric is one of those OG bitcoiners who actually don't believe in maximalism. He's the one who's really embracing the programmability of bitcoin and later on Ethereum and others. And I'm sure the Satoshi Dais was a big part of it.
00:06:48.823 - 00:07:06.131, Speaker A: Yeah, he was a maxi at one point and then he switched. He was probably the first group of people to switch from the bitcoin is money to programmable money with Ethereum and then obviously with some of the startups that he's built after that. So kudos to him. And then more and more people followed after that.
00:07:06.203 - 00:07:17.735, Speaker B: Do you want to fast forward to the last two weeks? Because there were a lot of very interesting experiments on chain experiment experiments in the last few weeks.
00:07:18.675 - 00:07:19.975, Speaker A: My God, so many.
00:07:20.635 - 00:07:51.985, Speaker B: My favorite cat on the Internet, C.L. he calls it the Retard Summer as homage to the great defi summer of 2020. So instead of Defi Summer, it's the Retard Summer retard. So obviously there's a lot of really retarded shitcoin trading meme coins, et cetera. But I want to dive deep and Figure out if there's anything deeper than just meme coin trading. So do you want to start with some of the things you've personally aped into?
00:07:52.105 - 00:08:38.417, Speaker A: Yeah. Before we do that, I also want to talk about cl. He posted an article, I shared it with you about a month ago, and he talked about the genesis of Retard Summer, but he talked about there's more of a macro like narrative that's at play. And what he said was people. One is like, you have social networks and so like, there's like inherent network effects of people shilling their own tokens. And for most, for the average person that is like, you know, not really into crypto but, you know, trades, shitcoins we call them, like plebs or retail folks. For them, they don't have time to diligence startups, they don't have time to diligence tokens.
00:08:38.417 - 00:09:25.733, Speaker A: So what they do is they just ape into or invest in tokens that they hear about through their friends or through their social feeds. And it makes a lot of sense, right? You know, there's people that I work with that's outside of crypto, and they ping me and ask me, hey, what do you think about this token? And I'm like, where did you even hear about this? And it turns out it's just people within their social feed. And so I do think that what's happening is that there's more awareness of just investing crypto and people just want to make gains, similar to like Pepe Dogecoin and others. That's the narrative. They only know about. They don't know about the other narratives. So what's happened the past few weeks and what have I aped into? I think it.
00:09:25.733 - 00:10:04.075, Speaker A: I think, you know, one of them was hamster, even though it was hamster coin. And essentially for listeners that haven't heard about this, it's a live race, live hamster race. So there's literally a camera in front of like four hamsters. There's a maze, and whoever gets through this maze first wins. And people bet on which hamster that they want to win. And then there's a pot and then it's distributed evenly based on all the people that bid on the right hamster. I think at one point it had over a thousand five hundred viewers.
00:10:04.075 - 00:10:42.185, Speaker A: And there was probably, you know, I love the shitcoin investors on Twitter or the traders, because once they start to collect fees on a daily basis, they'll annualize it automatically and they'll say it's worth, you know, like, you see this on Twitter. And then they'll annualize it and say, like, it's worth $100 million. And so people ape in because of that. And, you know, it's whatever. But that obviously quickly fell through because, you know, the dev wasn't like doing things by the book and people saw through it and then they ended up dumping the token. It went to zero.
00:10:42.265 - 00:11:00.609, Speaker B: I think that the real problem is that just that the games were pretty boring. So I think like three times, and you have to wait like an hour between. So by three times, I mean three races, three hamster races. And between every two races, you have to wait like an hour. And then each race lasts like literally two seconds because the hamster just goes from.
00:11:00.657 - 00:11:01.241, Speaker A: It's so quick.
00:11:01.273 - 00:11:10.257, Speaker B: Yeah, it's too quick. So the game, it was very obvious that you would just lose. Lose interest. People will lose interest very quickly. But go ahead.
00:11:10.281 - 00:11:40.785, Speaker A: Yeah, go ahead. Well, I mean, like, if you think about, you know, every trend that picked up in crypto, like, let's say cryptokitties, and we could talk about that in a bit. But, you know, cryptokitties was this, you know, NFT platform where you could buy mint cats and breed them and sell them. And at one point it took up, I don't know, like, 75% of all of Ethereum transactions back in 2017. I feel like these lightning in the bottom moments are really a precursor to what's going to happen in the future. Right. And I think the same with hamster coin.
00:11:40.785 - 00:12:05.025, Speaker A: Right. Although it's funny and you know, you have the shitcoin traders that will end up purchasing these tokens or whatever, but there's a signal there that we see. And if you think about it, like, what's the biggest, like, live betting race that's out there? It's horse. Horse racing. Right. And so imagine being able to put, you know, these races on chain that's live where people could use crypto tokens as a way to bet on the horses. That could be something very big.
00:12:05.025 - 00:12:17.753, Speaker A: And millions of people travel to these race, you know, race courses and they bet on horses. But imagine doing this live, anywhere from the world with. With crypto. I think that could be something that could be very plausible.
00:12:17.929 - 00:12:25.297, Speaker B: Did I ever tell you how I got into crypto? Crypto or bitcoin? I mean. No, I'm sure I'm told you. I've told you like, several.
00:12:25.361 - 00:12:27.475, Speaker A: I mean, you've told me, but not the audience.
00:12:27.585 - 00:12:47.235, Speaker B: I. And there are several stories. There are several, like, you know, incidents, but one of them was how I aped my entire net worth 10 years ago into offshore sports betting exchange and it got frozen. The money was frozen by the bank for six months.
00:12:47.535 - 00:12:49.343, Speaker A: Wasn't that the scariest moment of your life?
00:12:49.399 - 00:13:18.095, Speaker B: Yes. And that was. That was basically when I realized you need a uncensorable form of money and payment. That was the. I mean, even today I still think sports betting and other like betting platforms is one of the most obvious applications of crypto. Right? Like the fact that when you wire your money, when you withdraw your money, you don't need the permission of the platform or the bank itself. But anyway, that's a side story.
00:13:18.095 - 00:13:25.807, Speaker B: Let's go back to the stuff that we, you and I aped in in the last couple of weeks. So hamster. What else?
00:13:25.871 - 00:13:33.119, Speaker A: Hamster, Harry Potter, Obama, Sonic, Tany Nu bought that. Pretty.
00:13:33.247 - 00:13:36.015, Speaker B: What the hell is that? That's the one I don't get.
00:13:36.095 - 00:14:22.139, Speaker A: Yeah, I bought this a couple months ago, but to me, I tweeted this out earlier, which is like the harder I laugh, the more I buy. But it's a plausible thesis, right? I mean, if you think about art, like NFT art, the consensus is as long as it attracts you, like the art, forget the speculative nature of it. If you like the art, you buy it. And I think that's very common. I think that there's some similar analogies with meme coins, right? I'm not going to say every meme coin is going to take off, but this one in particular, I think this one is special because this is the first meme that isn't related to any Internet culture. So if you think about. Let's think about all the meme coins that are out there.
00:14:22.139 - 00:14:59.579, Speaker A: Dogecoin was the first meme coin that came out soon after was Shiba Inu. And now it's Pepe. All three of them came from, you know, like historically came from like 4chan and these, you know, underground Internet culture factories. I feel like Harry Potter is the first that really came out of crypto Twitter and which I think is very interesting in my opinion. And it's interesting because someone posted a picture of the way this became popularized was someone was in some country. I forgot what country it was. I think it was Thailand.
00:14:59.579 - 00:15:13.287, Speaker A: And someone took a picture of a backpack and the backpack had a logo and that logo had Harry Potter, Obama, Sonic, and the number 10 coin, I think Sheba was added on for the.
00:15:13.311 - 00:15:15.703, Speaker B: Meme effect, but it was bitcoin was.
00:15:15.719 - 00:15:31.255, Speaker A: On it and obviously Bitcoin. Sorry, yeah, bitcoin. And this was Shilled back in. This started In November of 22nd, someone tweeted. October of 22, someone tweeted this out. I saw the tweet. And the ticker, which is the kicker here, is bitcoin.
00:15:31.255 - 00:15:38.887, Speaker A: So it's a dollar sign. Bitcoin. And the beauty behind this is that people cannot afford to buy whole bitcoin. Right.
00:15:38.951 - 00:15:40.315, Speaker B: Ah, okay.
00:15:40.815 - 00:15:45.183, Speaker A: So it's the common man's bitcoin, is the thesis there.
00:15:45.239 - 00:15:46.295, Speaker B: The poor man's bitcoin.
00:15:46.375 - 00:15:59.595, Speaker A: The poor man's bitcoin. And I mean, if you think about. There's two other things that I thought about which I thought this meme was pretty funny. One is, like, imagine if it was on the news and someone had to say that whole thing.
00:15:59.895 - 00:16:00.835, Speaker B: Hilarious.
00:16:01.775 - 00:16:02.527, Speaker A: Hilarious.
00:16:02.631 - 00:16:06.435, Speaker B: Imagine Jim Cramer showing this or shorting it.
00:16:07.095 - 00:16:12.807, Speaker A: Just the very nature of how absurd this is is the alpha. Do you know what I mean?
00:16:12.871 - 00:16:13.475, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:16:14.295 - 00:16:22.495, Speaker A: And then also, if you think about it, it's going to force centralized exchanges to list bitcoin as the ticker to this coin.
00:16:22.615 - 00:16:23.355, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:16:24.055 - 00:16:30.915, Speaker A: So you see, there's some interesting elements there that I could see Take off. That will make it a very strong meme.
00:16:33.335 - 00:16:41.005, Speaker B: You said earlier, the harder it makes you laugh, the more you want to apin. So that leads to bald. So I actually saw.
00:16:41.385 - 00:16:43.473, Speaker A: Oh, yes, I bought bald too.
00:16:43.529 - 00:17:05.705, Speaker B: Yeah. So bald is another one that you and I both aped into. And it's really, really funny because there was. I mean, the first time I came across it was a tweet where, like, it showed, like, some of the most famous bald entrepreneurs in the modern era. So it was Jeff Bezos. So. So for each one of them, there's two pictures.
00:17:05.705 - 00:17:23.017, Speaker B: There's the before and after. So for Jeff Bezos, before, not bald, not rich. After, bald and rich. And then Brian Armstrong, before, not bald, not rich. After bald and rich. And same thing for Elon and others. So when I saw that, I just decided to ape into it.
00:17:23.017 - 00:17:29.663, Speaker B: But I aped into it on, like, Monday. Monday morning. You did it on Saturday night.
00:17:29.809 - 00:17:30.371, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:17:30.483 - 00:17:32.507, Speaker B: Were you not supposed to hang out with your family?
00:17:32.611 - 00:17:47.987, Speaker A: You know, when I see a very good meme and I laugh. Well, let me. Let me tell you this. This is the beauty behind Uniswap. Wallet. So I have a wallet that's mobile. And, you know, if I see something really funny, I ape in right away.
00:17:48.091 - 00:17:58.943, Speaker B: So you. On Saturday night at a FTV of 20, I saw the whole thing. I didn't. I didn't pay attention to my telegram or Twitter the whole weekend. So Monday morning, I Woke up, I.
00:17:58.959 - 00:18:03.391, Speaker A: Saw this thing and it was almost 90 million.
00:18:03.503 - 00:18:04.799, Speaker B: 190 million.
00:18:04.887 - 00:18:05.271, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:18:05.343 - 00:18:19.639, Speaker B: So I felt a lot of FOMO. But then I saw like, I don't know, like I ate it. Like I woke up, it was like 90 or something. And then I was like, I'm going to have lunch, breakfast. So I ate breakfast. Like after that it was. You went another like 200%.
00:18:19.639 - 00:19:00.585, Speaker B: I'm like, fuck, what am I going to do? All right, I'm going to ape into Toshi and what's the other one? The leadswap is a super. I think in hindsight it's probably a mid curve trade. Like, my thinking was, okay, if there's all these new meme coins. Oh, by the way. So all these meme coins that we heard about and aped into that weekend was on Beys, which is the L2 that coinbase built. And so I was like, if all these. There's all these meme coins people are launching, why don't I just ape into the main, you know, decentralized exchange on base? So that's what I did.
00:19:00.585 - 00:19:09.777, Speaker B: So I did that and I did bald. And then like literally five minutes later, I got rugged on both. Literally, they pulled the liquidity and then the whole thing just went to zero.
00:19:09.921 - 00:19:16.887, Speaker A: Well, I mean, I got rugged on bald. I mean, yeah, it went literal. It went to a million dollar market cap.
00:19:17.071 - 00:19:43.915, Speaker B: And by the way, this, this whole thing, like this whole experience that we had last weekend was exactly what CL said on Twitter about how this retard summer reminds him of Defi Summer. Because in Defi Summer, this is exactly what happened. Like if you don't look at your telegram or Twitter for two days, you're going to miss out on like 10,000 gains. And then you know, the moment you apin, you get rocked. So that's. And that happens like literally every day during Defi Summer.
00:19:43.995 - 00:20:01.635, Speaker A: Yeah. And I'd say, like, there's a lot of. Partly this is nostalgic for us, right? Because Defi Summer was such a magical experience. I don't think we could ever see something as magical. I hope we do.
00:20:01.755 - 00:20:25.389, Speaker B: I think if you missed Defi Summer, if you didn't ape into anything, into, if you didn't participate in Defi Summer, you don't understand why, how magical crypto is. It's as simple as that. I think the next best thing is the NFT seasons. But Defi Summer happened first. So that was the first magical moment in the entire. I think for me it's the most magical moment in the entire History of crypto. I'll explain that later.
00:20:25.437 - 00:20:29.645, Speaker A: But you mean explain Defi Summer.
00:20:29.725 - 00:20:31.141, Speaker B: Do you want me to explain Defi Summer?
00:20:31.213 - 00:20:34.757, Speaker A: I think we should, for listeners that haven't experienced Defi Summer.
00:20:34.861 - 00:21:17.151, Speaker B: So Defi Summer was a short bull market in the last bear market. And the bull market only happened to the Defi coins. And there were a lot of interesting experiences. For example, there's these coins called the pickles and yam. You farm pickles and you stake it to farm yam and then you put yam into like uniswap to earn some yield and then you swap that into eth and then you put it into yarn and you earn yield off of like all that, like super weird, super fluid token. Exactly, all that stuff. But there were two really magical things about Defi Summer.
00:21:17.151 - 00:22:11.557, Speaker B: The first is that for the first time, people realized how great of a user experience it was to be able to access multiple products from one wallet. That seamless experience is really, really incredible. And on top of that, you can access all these different products without permission. And what that means is without having to go through kyc, without having to get permission from the centralized exchange to withdraw your money, all that stuff, like the user experience was incredible. So that was the first magical thing. And the second magical thing is that was the first time people really experienced composability in crypto. So all that stuff that I mentioned, like the compose, like all these like super weird things that you can do by combining pickles and yam and uniswap and yarn and you know, AAVE compound, all these things, that was the first time people really experienced composability.
00:22:11.557 - 00:22:32.695, Speaker B: So for me, these were the two most magical things about Defi Summer. And the composability part, arguably we didn't experience that in NFTs. We did experience the first magical thing, which is the accessing, like trading, you know, NFTs from one account, like seamlessly without a permission. We experienced the first thing, but not the second thing with NFTs.
00:22:33.235 - 00:23:19.687, Speaker A: And a couple like additional points that I experienced which I thought was interesting. One is using tokens as a way to incentivize a certain type of behavior. And so we call this now liquidity mining or farming. And two is accessing real world products without having to go through 10 to 20 different steps. An example of this is taking a loan out against your mortgage. The process is cumbersome and it takes, I don't know, six months, three to six months if someone wants to do that. And for Defi Summer, it was the first Time where people were able to literally collateralize their ETH and borrow against it.
00:23:19.687 - 00:23:34.223, Speaker A: And towards the end of like the NFT craze, you had NFT lending platforms where you could lend against your. You could borrow against your NFTs, which I thought, I mean, after using the first Defi product I used was Ethlend, which is now aave.
00:23:34.359 - 00:23:34.839, Speaker B: Yep.
00:23:34.927 - 00:23:37.863, Speaker A: I mean everything just made so much sense.
00:23:38.039 - 00:23:56.913, Speaker B: By the way, what you just said there is exactly what Michael, the founder of Curve, did. So he collateralized crv, put it into AAVE and other like Fraxland and other lending platforms and borrowed probably some stable coin and then bought a giant mansion in Australia.
00:23:57.009 - 00:23:58.889, Speaker A: I think he bought two mansions for 40 million.
00:23:58.977 - 00:24:15.345, Speaker B: Two mansions, that's right. So anyway, that's just without commenting on the whole Curve situation, that that's just a illustration of what you just mentioned about the frictionless Defi, you know, financial products.
00:24:15.885 - 00:24:45.389, Speaker A: And so Defi was just, I think instrumental into thinking about how other sectors could take off. And I think a lot of the focus now is financializing NFTs as an example. So we're starting to see Defi and all the things that have happened over the past few years now those resources are putting into. Which is why we're starting to see more and more speculative types products. Right. So you're seeing blend with Blur. There are a couple other lending products like Bendao and et cetera that are taking off.
00:24:45.477 - 00:25:27.709, Speaker B: So sorry, back to Bolt because it's too far Bold and Bayes, all that stuff. There was a interesting lesson which we've learned a long time ago, but just worth reiterating, which is that based this new L2, however unproven it was, it gathered over, I think, $80 million. 80 million in TVL in 24 hours. In 24 hours. And that number was higher than the vast, vast majority of Layer twos and alt at once. And all that was thanks to speculation. All that was thanks to one meme, coin, which is bald.
00:25:27.709 - 00:25:37.091, Speaker B: And this guy who tweeted that he turned $500 into $5 million. Oh, was it five or something to that effect?
00:25:37.203 - 00:25:38.535, Speaker A: He got wrecked, by the way.
00:25:38.875 - 00:26:05.465, Speaker B: Yeah, he got wrecked. But that kind of story is what attracts retail traders into a new ecosystem. Like when they hear, oh, there's this guy who made this much money by putting only $500 I want to ape into. And that's exactly what happened. People aped into anything, myself included, into anything that happened on Beys over the weekend, despite the fact that there was not even a UI for the bridging Right. You remember, like, can we talk about.
00:26:05.505 - 00:26:22.185, Speaker A: How crazy that is? I mean, there was a tweet by the ball deployer that said, hey, if you want to bridge, use this Ethereum address. Put your money here and you know, you'll have money on base. I mean, think about $80 million going through just that tweet.
00:26:22.265 - 00:26:29.491, Speaker B: Well, to be fair, to be fair, Coinbase actually has their document, they do official documentation where they list the same thing, the same address.
00:26:29.633 - 00:26:33.167, Speaker A: How many people do you think cross checked that? That's the question.
00:26:33.271 - 00:26:57.865, Speaker B: But it's crazy though, because I think that was the only time I've ever bridged without a UI Same. And it was unproven. It was definitely unproven. The whole protocol was unproven. And yet it attracted $80 million in TBL. So speculation and meme coins and defi and airdrops as a way to bootstrap a new ecosystem has been proven to be really effective.
00:26:57.945 - 00:27:24.667, Speaker A: Yeah, Arbor Trump, when they first launched, went through similar issues as Base. You know, they had a meme coin that went up to a billion dollars, I think it was called Nyan Neon and it went to a billion. Now it's like at zero or whatever. There was other like, products that ended up rugging people. It's happening on ZK Sync as well. Like there was three or four products back to back, all rugged. They're all like lending product rugged between 3 to 5 million dollars.
00:27:24.667 - 00:27:45.307, Speaker A: So it seems like, you know, there's an interesting, like, dynamic here. When a new L2 launches, you have, you know, you know, people that are opportunistic, they're taking advantage of people that want to make incredible amounts of money and, and some get out of it and do really well. But most, I feel like, ended up getting rugged.
00:27:45.411 - 00:27:51.053, Speaker B: The other really popular narrative in the last couple of weeks was unibot.
00:27:51.139 - 00:27:51.593, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:27:51.689 - 00:27:53.721, Speaker B: And do you want to talk about it?
00:27:53.793 - 00:28:07.409, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, unibot's been around for, I think six months now. Six to eight months. And the idea is very simple. It's a telegram bot that will manage your private key for you. How secure is that?
00:28:07.497 - 00:28:10.273, Speaker B: I mean, more importantly, how legal is that?
00:28:10.409 - 00:28:26.651, Speaker A: How legal? Yeah, it could be considered as a money transmitter. Transmitter license or. Yeah. So MTL must be. And so Telegram manages your. Or the software manages your private key. You deposit money into it and it allows you to automate trades.
00:28:26.651 - 00:28:55.375, Speaker A: So an example of this is if, if someone shares a Unibot link, Right. And that link is a link to purchase any asset, you click it, it'll automatically purchase it for you. So if you think like from a larger or more broad scale, you could see thousands, hundreds of thousands of people in a group chat and someone can share a link and say, hey, I'm buying this token. And he shares a link and everyone else clicks the link. It automatically executes a trade for everyone. And everyone just eaps in automatically.
00:28:55.415 - 00:28:56.315, Speaker B: It's crazy.
00:28:56.895 - 00:29:35.897, Speaker A: And now they have referral links, right? And referral links gives the main person that introduced the asset to their audience. They get 5% cut plus on the money that is transacted through that referral link. So it kind of automates referral copy trading. Because I know a lot of exchanges tried copy trading. There are a lot of dapps that we've talked to that try to automate copy trading, but it never worked. But in this case, it could work. And in fact, there's a stat that came out recently that said 97% of people that trade lose money on average.
00:29:35.897 - 00:29:53.665, Speaker A: But it turns out 35% people that use Unibot are making money. It's an interesting dynamic there. But now if you think about it from a broad scale now there's like shitcoins that are being deployed. Probably like thousands of shitcoins are deployed every day now.
00:29:54.245 - 00:29:55.421, Speaker B: I'll give you some stats.
00:29:55.493 - 00:29:57.265, Speaker A: Yeah, I'd love to hear some stats.
00:29:57.565 - 00:30:24.353, Speaker B: Okay, so unibot. I'll start with some stats and I'll share some things I learned. So the unibot, last I checked was making 70 million annualized ARR. Annual recurring revenue. Well, I don't know how recurrent it is, but annualized is 70 million. And that's basically more money than pretty much every crypto product except for gmx. Yeah, so that's crazy.
00:30:24.353 - 00:30:49.195, Speaker B: That's crazy. And the way they do that is, well, all these social trading stuff on Telegram, that's super fun. But also they charge 5% per trade, so 10% round trip, every trade. So that's even crazier than all the NFT marketplaces used to charge. And even at that price point, people are willing to ape using unibot. So that's an interesting stat. But I'll share the things I learned.
00:30:49.195 - 00:31:26.243, Speaker B: The first thing is I'll actually just quote one of the founders I spoke with, so it's Mike from Define. So he showed me. Define is like on chain crypto data product. He showed me a data feed of all the shit coins that are being created in real time. Okay, so I saw that tweet, I saw that feed in real time, and basically on average there's one shitcoin being created on chain per minute, not per day, per minute, every minute there's a new shitcoin that's being launched on chain. That's really crazy.
00:31:26.339 - 00:31:27.155, Speaker A: That's insane.
00:31:27.275 - 00:32:17.283, Speaker B: And he said something to the effect of yes, we are in a bear market, but shiquan trading has always been in a bull market. Yeah, the number of shit coins that are being launched on chain has been increasing steadily over the last three years since DeFi summer. And so that's why Unibot has seen the success it has seen, which is to allow people to ape into these new shitcoins that are being launched. So that's the first thing. It's the Shikon bull market. So okay, if you look at the shitcoin secondary market, like if you look at coingeckoin, all that stuff, it seems like the vast majority of alts are in the bear market. But if you focus on the shitcoins that are launched, that are just launched and the number of people who apin to these shitcoins, I almost categorize this as the primary market because like you apin right after it is launched.
00:32:17.283 - 00:32:25.681, Speaker B: So this market has been booming and that's what led to the success or the traction of Unibot and others so far.
00:32:25.793 - 00:33:17.129, Speaker A: So if you think about like what's happening in the space generally, all of this liquidity is being concentrated, right? So Unibot is concentrating liquidity and is directing flows based on where influencers think is going to give them the next thousand, 10,000 x. And you could think of this as like a social coordination, right, between all of these like people that have very strong network effects of shitcoin traders. Um, and look, I, I'm not, I don't know where the alpha is in regards to what next coin is going to, you know, pump or dump or whatever you want to call it. But these influencers do. And so what these influencers are doing now is they're creating their own telegram chats, they're inviting people, it's private. And now they're sharing links and essentially like coordinating with others. And I've seen this happen with other groups into these types of opportunities.
00:33:17.129 - 00:33:40.465, Speaker A: And one that I could talk about is like Toshi. Toshi is like definitely coordinated across all the influencers because of bald. And so I think that's just an interesting element there. The second element is now it's now that people can enter into trades very, very quickly. The next big worry for most of these people are like, when do you exit? And because all of these tokens, what we've seen now is kind of like an up then down.
00:33:40.545 - 00:34:25.251, Speaker B: So to your second point, this was the next thing I learned. So you have to really try the product, you have to really try Uniswap or Unibot to really appreciate this. But the user experience of Unibot is actually really seamless. So when you try to do the same thing with metamask and Uniswap, for example, that experience has not changed since Defi summer and that's extremely cumbersome. Like all the whole like signing transactions, all that stuff is really cumbersome. Is it cumbersome? For me as a crypto native, imagine how cumbersome it's got to be for like the long tail of crypto traders. But with Unibot, it basically offers you a centralized exchange experience.
00:34:25.251 - 00:35:03.814, Speaker B: You don't need to sign transactions, you just click on a button within Telegram or click on a link and boom, you get the tokens in your account. And on top of that you don't need to KYC and all that stuff. By the way, that's the probably the not legal part. But to just illustrate the point, unibot offers the best of both CEFI and DEFI worlds, which is the not ky the permissionless part as well as the better experience part. And this really led me to think about account abstraction. Like I actually haven't fully appreciated account abstraction before. I tried unibody and aped into all these three coins.
00:35:03.814 - 00:35:43.903, Speaker B: Yeah, the hope is that account abstraction will be able to offer a centralized exchange like experience for users. And also as a side note, it seems like account abstraction is not the only thing that can enable this experience. There are some recent developments in NPC that can offer a very similar experience. So by that experience I mean specifically pre signed transactions in such a way that whenever you just make a new trade, you don't need to sign transactions anymore. So that experience is, I think for now has been really underappreciated, at least for me personally. I didn't, I didn't appreciate this until I actually tried the product.
00:35:43.999 - 00:36:02.685, Speaker A: Yeah, and I think it goes back to the thesis, which is like, I think the biggest problem with crypto today is managing your private keys and the wallet experience that needs to be abstracted away in such a way that you're interacting with products that are similar to like Web2 products. I feel like Unibot is like a great example of that.
00:36:02.765 - 00:36:24.325, Speaker B: I also want to add a side note to all of this, which is that I noticed that the traders who do this type of trade that ape into newly launched shitcoins, they're not on CoinGecko or CoinMarketCap, they're on DexScreener. And that is because when the tokens are listed on CoinGecko, it's too late. It's too late for the trade.
00:36:24.445 - 00:36:30.567, Speaker A: Well, I will say it's. Gecko Terminal is the competitor to dexscreener.
00:36:30.671 - 00:36:31.607, Speaker B: I've not used it.
00:36:31.711 - 00:36:32.071, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:36:32.143 - 00:36:32.983, Speaker B: Is it a.
00:36:33.119 - 00:36:33.463, Speaker A: It's good.
00:36:33.479 - 00:36:34.063, Speaker B: Is it an app?
00:36:34.119 - 00:36:45.023, Speaker A: Yeah, they don't have it. I don't think they have an app yet. But Gecko Terminal gives you a very seamless experience that's similar to Screener. It doesn't there. I don't think there's an iPhone app for it. But if you're using desktop, it's there.
00:36:45.079 - 00:36:45.755, Speaker B: Okay.
00:36:46.335 - 00:36:47.927, Speaker A: But it's. It's a good experience overall.
00:36:47.991 - 00:37:30.131, Speaker B: The point I wanted to point out is despite like trading being a core activity that crypto users have been used to or have been using since defi summer or maybe earlier than that, for many years, there's always these new types of behaviors that enable new products to emerge and to compete with incumbents. So what led to the rise of dexscreener, I think is really the fact that what I said earlier about how shitcoins have always been in a bull market. So. So this, this thing itself is what led to the need for a product like dexscreener and others. But anyway, so that's what I learned about. About unibot.
00:37:30.203 - 00:38:08.941, Speaker A: Yeah, I think Unibot overall is going to be an interesting phenomenon because it. It was launched when, if I think it was in parallel to ecc. And there was an interesting argument that was made on Twitter that talked about. Everyone has spent so much time in research and debating, you know, different elements of modularity, thesis or layer one, L2, sequencing. All of these buzzwords that people hear that are the average person and they get turned off by it. And so you have this other community that's been kind of like brewing and it's brewing primarily because they just want to use that thing and speculate. And it was just.
00:38:08.941 - 00:39:00.911, Speaker A: I just thought it was so interesting that both of those kind of emerged at the same time, which is like, know this incredibly like technical group, research groups that are talking about and pushing the blend of the thesis that I mentioned. And then you have like people that are aping into like Harry Potter, Obama, Sonic 10inu. So interesting. And these groups don't know each other. That's the interesting piece. And I think that's primarily there was an article that was written by Nick Grossman from usv. And I'll just summarize it, I'll just summarize it pretty easily, which is like there's an obviously an over concentration of people that are focusing on infrastructure, but apps, there's going to be a trend, right? Meaning that infrastructure is always going to be focused on, but apps are just going to get better and proliferate better, you know, month after month, year after year, because the infrastructure is being built out.
00:39:00.911 - 00:39:16.339, Speaker A: And the thing in crypto is that they don't understand each other. So apps are being built that maybe people that are in the infrastructure side don't really understand and apps that are being built that or, sorry, infrastructure people that don't really understand the apps that are being built. So I just thought that was a very interesting element there.
00:39:16.507 - 00:39:27.747, Speaker B: And relatedly, the everyone at the ecc, you know, basically the crypto elite wants a decentralized web, whereas the real users just want a shitcoin casino.
00:39:27.811 - 00:39:43.277, Speaker A: You know what's funny? Every layer one, L2 that is built now, their main focus is to get first defi on there and get speculation on there. Once you have speculation, then you can start to build out NFTs and all the other stuff that's happening, but it has to start somewhere and it's speculation.
00:39:43.421 - 00:40:11.329, Speaker B: So everything we've talked about so far is about meme coins, shitcoins, all that stuff. But there's another broad category of speculation in crypto, which is gambling. And that's, by the way, how I got into crypto when my. My bank froze my money. Yeah, A while ago. I think that second category of online casino gambling, all that stuff is also really, really interesting. And I would argue that the whole thing started with Augur.
00:40:11.329 - 00:40:14.569, Speaker B: Do you want to talk about the sort of the history of Augur?
00:40:14.657 - 00:40:21.449, Speaker A: Well, it actually started. Did you know the first app on Ethereum was Etherol, which.
00:40:21.497 - 00:40:22.361, Speaker B: Etheroll. That's right.
00:40:22.433 - 00:40:23.105, Speaker A: Ethereal.
00:40:23.185 - 00:40:27.417, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, okay, so arguably, really it started with Satoshi Dice.
00:40:27.521 - 00:40:50.913, Speaker A: It started with satoshi dice 100%. And you know, people realized that, you know, at the end of. It was funny when I was, when I. The video that I mentioned, we'll link in our show notes. But this guy that was talking on YouTube, he's like, everyone just wants to speculate about the price of bitcoin. It's annoying, right? And he was talking about price swings in the dollars at the time. But that brought on 10,000 users onto Bitcoin to use the app.
00:40:50.969 - 00:40:51.473, Speaker B: Yes.
00:40:51.609 - 00:41:19.011, Speaker A: And I'm sure Vitalik saw this, you know, and others saw this and they're like, well, if we can build a more generalized, more expressive smart contracts, you know, with logic that could be given in a way that could be built that great products can be built around, I'm sure this could happen again. And I think that's one of the reasons why Etherolle was first started on Ethereum. And it was started by this guy named Jez. Jez who went on to start Funfair, which I aped into back in the day. You did? Nice. Did you do the ico?
00:41:19.153 - 00:41:23.135, Speaker B: Yes, every. I did like every single one of the ICOs back in the day.
00:41:23.215 - 00:41:41.807, Speaker A: All right. Alpha back then, for those that were, that didn't go through the ico, boom was as long as Vitalik was the advisor and you'll see like, you know, his picture. Right. The coin will tend to 100x.
00:41:41.871 - 00:41:42.595, Speaker B: That's right.
00:41:43.135 - 00:42:22.045, Speaker A: So that was the Alpha back then. Um, but yeah, Jez, who founded a very successful gaming studio who essentially built. I don't know if you remember this, but Star Fox on, on Super Nintendo and Nintendo 64. I played what Nintendo 64, so I thought that was pretty cool. So he went on to start Funfair. But that's kind of how the, you know, essentially gambling started on Ethereum and Augur, which is a prediction market started by Joy Krug, essentially say a decentralized prediction market. They focus more on the decentralized side to prevent regulatory burden, which I think hurt the product in the long run.
00:42:22.045 - 00:42:27.713, Speaker A: Maybe. If you want to talk about the product, I know you used it, what were your thoughts about the product when it launched?
00:42:27.769 - 00:43:09.819, Speaker B: I think it was late 2017 or early 2018, can't remember. But when they first launched their first product, consumer product, not just the protocol, but the actual application, it was a really painful experience. So we download the thing and you have to spend like three hours syncing with the Ethereum blockchain. It was in all that in the name of decentralization because like it's. It's like when you run the whole thing really locally from your computer, it's really like self sovereign kind of product. But it was a really painful experience and obviously the liquidity was really bad. And so ultimately I think Augur didn't go anywhere.
00:43:09.947 - 00:43:15.427, Speaker A: Yeah, I just remember using it and I just remember liquidity was the problem for me.
00:43:15.491 - 00:43:38.609, Speaker B: Yeah, but the idea was really obvious. Like it's still obvious today, I think so I think it was just too early. I think even today we don't really have A super like household name prediction market, Crypto prediction market. Like there's polymarket for example, but I don't think their household name yet. I think the idea was just too early and at some point like prediction markets will exist.
00:43:38.697 - 00:44:03.785, Speaker A: Here's a fun like thought process. Um, Poly Market is, here's a, here's a good one. Um, every time there's some sort of like cultural event that happens that affects all, all of Twitter as an example, or, or all, all, all the sectors are in the space. Poly Market always emerges. I always see their screenshot circulating. So there was one around super conductivity. If you remember that it was, you know, most people believed it that they didn't believe it.
00:44:03.825 - 00:44:05.809, Speaker B: I remember that. That was like literally two days ago.
00:44:05.897 - 00:44:30.455, Speaker A: Yeah. And then you had the AI boom. I remember seeing Poly Market up again and then it came back down. So I feel like there's something there with Poly Market. I mean I think that regulatory stuff has, they passed that now. And if you use a product, it's very simple, right. You just log in, you put in USDC and then you can bet where you want.
00:44:30.455 - 00:44:37.733, Speaker A: So I think partially it's semi centralized, which is why it's so much easier to use than augur as an example, by the way.
00:44:37.749 - 00:44:42.013, Speaker B: As a side note, do you remember like people were worried about assassination markets back in the day?
00:44:42.069 - 00:44:42.589, Speaker A: Yes.
00:44:42.717 - 00:45:08.351, Speaker B: So the idea is that you can bet on people being dead and then people would actually try to actively kill that person. So that was like actually one of the biggest worries among the early, I guess, adopters of prediction markets. But obviously today that's, I think there's other risks before that, for example, like the UX risks, the regulatory risks, like all that stuff. But anyway, just a fun thing to.
00:45:08.423 - 00:46:01.163, Speaker A: Mention another side, I guess, interesting side note was there was a bot called Chirac that tracked the murders and people would be able to bet on the murder. Yeah, yeah, it was interesting. But outside of that, the murders, like betting on the murders or whatever, there's an interesting element of like this off chain data. Right. That people are seeing and people are able to like use crypto as a way to bet for or against it, which I thought was an interesting signal. So there's another one that we forgot to mention and I know we don't know exactly the background of this firm, so I can't speak for it, but Rollbit is another one that has started to gain a lot of traction. I consider this as a centralized platform that offers degen gambling.
00:46:01.163 - 00:46:20.375, Speaker A: So you could do sports betting, you could 1000x long short crypto assets you could borrow against your NFTs. And it seems to me I read a data point similar that they're doing one fifth of all of Binance's perf volume on BTC and eth, which I thought was. I don't know if this is substantiated or not, but I thought that was.
00:46:20.755 - 00:46:25.643, Speaker B: They got all the interesting signal in on influencers.
00:46:25.739 - 00:46:34.603, Speaker A: Osaka. Yeah, I think he rescinded his offer but gainsy a lot of drama but.
00:46:34.619 - 00:46:37.435, Speaker B: They got all the influencers to shill them.
00:46:37.515 - 00:46:41.891, Speaker A: CL is the only one that is against Robit. One of the influencers that's against Robit.
00:46:41.963 - 00:46:58.263, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know anything about them, but some people, some of the people shielding robot are pretty questionable. Um, anyway, I recently spoke with a founder and he told me that 50% of onramp onto Moonpay through Moonpay.
00:46:58.399 - 00:46:59.183, Speaker A: Yes, yes.
00:46:59.279 - 00:47:23.335, Speaker B: Goes to this website called the stake.com and I looked at it. It's. It's online casino and sports betting and that kind of stuff. For those who don't know, MoonPay is the one, the largest Fiat on ramp, off ramp into and from crypto. And 50% of the on ramp goes to this online casino. I haven't verified that number, but it's a really shocking number.
00:47:23.335 - 00:47:36.583, Speaker B: But in hindsight it's not that surprising that people just, I mean people just experience the same thing that I experienced 10 years ago, which is they want a uncensorable form of payment to go on like offshore betting platforms.
00:47:36.679 - 00:47:58.631, Speaker A: I mean even if you look at like the regulatory regime, right. There's so many restrictions in place for anyone to gamble. Right. And the ability to do it online, uncensorable. You don't have to worry about regulatory hindrances. And making it easy for anyone to gamble is I think where the value is for most people. Like even in the states, you have to be a certain age.
00:47:58.631 - 00:48:25.723, Speaker A: Only certain states offer it. An example of this is Illinois just started offering gambling four or five years ago. I'm not sure exactly how many years, but it was five or 10 years. But before then Illinois was gamble free or casino free. And so I do think there is something there from a regulatory perspective. And then also like, you know, doing something online is just so much easier, especially if you use crypto versus like traditional fiat on ramps.
00:48:25.819 - 00:48:30.339, Speaker B: By the way, Illinois was gamble free. Are you sure? I used to go to Horseshoe.
00:48:30.427 - 00:48:31.291, Speaker A: That's in Indiana.
00:48:31.363 - 00:48:32.123, Speaker B: Oh, is that right?
00:48:32.219 - 00:48:32.947, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:48:33.131 - 00:48:34.419, Speaker B: Okay. That's why.
00:48:34.507 - 00:48:49.603, Speaker A: So I think it was 10 years ago, the first casino that opened up in Illinois was Riverside. I forgot, but it's in Rosemont. That was the first casino that opened up. But yeah, Horseshoe and others were all like border Indiana. So people would drive to Indiana just to gamble.
00:48:49.699 - 00:49:09.865, Speaker B: That's right. Another stat I want to share. So I did some quick research on the size of global gambling market online gambling. And there's various estimates, but the estimates range between a hundred billion dollars to half a trillion dollars in annual revenue, not in market cap annual revenue.
00:49:09.985 - 00:49:10.761, Speaker A: That's insane.
00:49:10.873 - 00:49:46.567, Speaker B: And that includes like sports betting, the traditional casinos. Like by casinos I mean like blackjack and you know, that kind of game, like satoshi diets kind of games. Right. And also like stuff like binary options. Like those are like super, super big markets that people don't really talk about. And for me there's just a really obvious opportunity for crypto to disrupt those markets. Just speaking from personal experience, one of the biggest things that the users of those platforms experience, aside from like their money being frozen by the bank, is also like, for example, when you make too much money on a sports betting platform, they will ban you.
00:49:46.567 - 00:49:59.041, Speaker B: They don't want anyone to make too much money, but they will platform you, for example. They will sometimes they even freeze their money. And so a uncensorable platform for that kind of activities, to me is a really obvious idea.
00:49:59.153 - 00:50:28.087, Speaker A: And there is an element of the house playing against you. Right. And the house meaning like the casino playing against you. And there isn't a transparent way for the users or the people that are playing against the house to know whether or not it's done fairly. And so crypto is the perfect technical infrastructure that provides users and the house with provably fair gaming mechanics. Yeah. And an example of this is like Satoshi dice.
00:50:28.087 - 00:50:51.023, Speaker A: The way you would randomly generate its numbers is based on the hash. Right. And so it'll use the hash and say like, okay, this is the number. Now are you over under as an example. And then you have random generated numbers that's designed by chainlink with VDF's et cetera. And I do think that crypto makes it much more plausible to play a game and knowing that it's fair.
00:50:51.119 - 00:50:51.671, Speaker B: Yep.
00:50:51.783 - 00:50:59.479, Speaker A: So not only the uncensorable side, but then also like the gaming mechanics and logic of the game in itself, which I think is appealing for a lot of users.
00:50:59.527 - 00:51:06.695, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, people have been talking about these two ideas for a long time, like for at least 10 years. Like none of these ideas is new.
00:51:06.735 - 00:51:06.911, Speaker A: Right.
00:51:06.943 - 00:51:22.039, Speaker B: Like all these things people are talking about them on like bitcointalk.org like 12 years ago. But I think they were just too early. Like the fact that we haven't seen anything that works, it's just we were too early. But with all the scaling, all that stuff, we could be ready.
00:51:22.127 - 00:51:38.475, Speaker A: I feel like everything that we just talked about today has been tried on bitcoin, colored coins, gambling, NFTs. And we're talking about colored coins as launching shitcoins and real world assets. NFTs, memes, coins.
00:51:38.855 - 00:51:41.415, Speaker B: DeFi is too complicated for bitcoin, I think.
00:51:41.495 - 00:51:44.683, Speaker A: Defi, um, well, I mean like bitcoin.
00:51:44.699 - 00:51:46.299, Speaker B: Doesn'T have the smart contract capability.
00:51:46.427 - 00:52:11.225, Speaker A: It doesn't, but you know, you've seen some elements of it, like with colored coin trading, like, you know, exchanges. Right. But lending and borrowing. I don't remember seeing any of that. No. But you've seen like exchanges that could trade colored coin, maybe early instance of it, not full. So, yeah, I guess all in all, I guess we're in agreement, which is every sector has a superpower.
00:52:11.225 - 00:52:21.669, Speaker A: Healthcare is about saving lives. If you look at the movie industry, it's about telling a very compelling story for crypto, what is that? Is it speculation?
00:52:21.837 - 00:52:41.013, Speaker B: I mean, for now, yes. The number one thing is speculation. Number two thing for me is entertainment like Obama, Sonic, Harry Potter, bald, all these meme coins, that's like all these people doing social trading and telegram sending memes around and then people talking about them on Twitter. That's entertainment for me. So for now, these are the most, the two most important things could change in the future.
00:52:41.109 - 00:53:23.199, Speaker A: Why is it speculation though? Like, and I'm just, you know, spitballing here with you, but is it because users are in control of their assets? Meaning, like, if you look at, like even before crypto or halfway before crypto, most people wouldn't invest their own money, right. They would have Fidelity in these brokerage accounts and Robo advisor, whatever you want to call it, they would just buy or they would allow their 401k to do the, to do the work. There wasn't really a control of what they should buy or not buy. I feel like this phenomena changed recently with the launch of Robinhood. And I think more so is with crypto. And I think crypto and Robinhood kind of came at the same time. Right.
00:53:23.199 - 00:53:41.391, Speaker A: But I feel like there's something there which is people are now more in control of their assets and because of that, they can direct it into anywhere they want. And with the Internet and with network effects like Reddit and Twitter, people are using this as a way to persuade others to purchase the asset.
00:53:41.463 - 00:54:14.585, Speaker B: I see your point, but I think it's something simpler than that. Probably it's that crypto is just a lot more volatile than traditional markets, and people love that. The reason why Robinhood really took off is because people trade options on top of single stocks and they can leverage like 10 times in crypto with the kind of volatility that we have, especially on the shitcoins. It's basically like leveraging up 10x just from the volatility, and then you can leverage another 10 to a hundred x from the pers. So people love the possibility of investing only $500 and make a million dollars.
00:54:14.705 - 00:54:55.875, Speaker A: Well, I mean, I agree with you. I 100% agree that it's the liquidity volatility of these assets that makes it much more fun to speculate. But I mean, from a broader perspective, you saw like AMC and GameStop, right? Ten years ago, this would have never happened. Right. I do think it is two parallels, right? One is like what you're saying. You have the launch of shitcoins, illiquidity of the assets and how volatile they are, and it's essentially like perps. But then in the other parallel is like you have users that are becoming more in control of their assets and with the launch of Robinhood, and it forced Fidelity and others to pivot to some sort of model that's similar.
00:54:55.875 - 00:55:13.843, Speaker A: Coinbase, others. So you could buy these coins and then you could figure out where you want to buy your next coin. As an example. Here's like a perfect example. There are people that I've talked to, retail folks that used to ask me, hey, what? You know, like, I heard about this crypto thing, I want to buy it. And I'm like, do your own research. Don't ask me.
00:55:13.843 - 00:55:29.035, Speaker A: Because I give really bad advice. Go ape into bald. But what happens is they go out and they buy and they learn and then they learn and learn and learn to the point where now they're telling me what to buy.
00:55:29.155 - 00:55:49.269, Speaker B: No, but what you said there is. It's actually the opposite of what you said earlier. Like, people need advice from others to trade and crypto people, like crypto is. The crypto generation is a lot younger, right, Than the Fidelity generation and the crypto generation. They are very used to social media. They spend a lot of time on telegram. And that's exactly why unibot took off.
00:55:49.269 - 00:55:57.893, Speaker B: Because one person sends that link, everyone else apes in because there's this influencer who shares this link that he Aped into therefore I copy trade him.
00:55:57.989 - 00:56:39.939, Speaker A: So I'm not arguing against that. What I'm arguing is that I think because now users are controlling their assets versus allowing centralized institutions to control their assets in the way they should direct the investment of that asset, is what I'm saying. And I think now that more and more people are in control of their own assets, they can invest in whatever they want. And what they end up doing is, and this is going back to CL's point, is that they'll just see whatever's on their feet and they'll just ape in. And that's what's kind of like creating these markets on these shitcoins, outside of what's happening on the macro side. Yeah, I think that's it. I think we covered a lot on the speculative nature of crypto.
00:56:39.939 - 00:56:41.179, Speaker A: Anything else that you want to add?
00:56:41.267 - 00:56:54.459, Speaker B: I feel like sometimes I read investment thesis by some of the VCs. I don't know if they're doing that on purpose, like trying to look smart or what, like cutting them. They're overcomplicating things, like a lot of the crypto.
00:56:54.547 - 00:56:56.259, Speaker A: Give me an example. I need an example.
00:56:56.347 - 00:56:57.619, Speaker B: Okay. I'm not going to.
00:56:57.747 - 00:56:58.967, Speaker A: You don't have to name names.
00:56:59.091 - 00:57:23.575, Speaker B: I'll just use a hypothetical example. Okay. Of zora, for example. What would you say is the thesis behind zora? Like, if you were a vc, like picture yourself in the shoes of a vc. What kind of investment thesis? Or would you investment memo? Would you write to your LPs? Are you going to talk about speculation? No, you're not going to talk about speculation, Right. What would you say to your LPs if I. Crypto is the future of culture? Like that kind of stuff, right?
00:57:23.615 - 00:57:37.419, Speaker A: Yeah, crypto is the future of culture. People know art hasn't been monetized yet and the reach is very hard for artists and, you know, by creating some sort of L2 slash minting platform, they can be users.
00:57:37.467 - 00:57:52.261, Speaker B: Yeah, but in reality, what's happening to OpenSea or Blur or Zora, like all these NFT marketplaces, is it. Is it really because, like they succeeded really because it's the future of culture, or is it because most people just want to make money?
00:57:52.363 - 00:58:24.243, Speaker A: Everyone wants to make money. There's no reason why anyone would. I mean, obviously there's an art appreciation, right? 100% like, I mean, some of the art book blocks, art block collections that I love, like Fidenza's Ringers, Emily's art and a couple others, memories of killing beautiful art. But in the back of my mind, I know that if I hold this long enough that I'll be able to. You'll be able to make money. Right. And so speculation is 100%, I think, part of collecting all of these types of assets.
00:58:24.379 - 00:58:46.303, Speaker B: Yes. So that's exactly my point. There's always an element of both the speculation and the actual collection, like the love for the art. But I think for the most part, over 50% of what really drives the success behind NFTs and all the NFT related products, at least at the moment, is speculation is the possibility of making a lot of money.
00:58:46.399 - 00:58:48.279, Speaker A: Okay, so where are you going with this?
00:58:48.367 - 00:58:59.207, Speaker B: Where I'm going is just let's embrace the reality and stop the bullshit. The reality is the users want to make money and I don't know if your builder just offer them that possibility. If your investors stop the bullshit.
00:58:59.271 - 00:58:59.559, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:58:59.607 - 00:59:08.583, Speaker B: I'm not arguing against the culture, the art, all that stuff. Of course it's there. What I'm saying is I think it's less than 50% of what's really happening today.
00:59:08.679 - 00:59:40.953, Speaker A: Any final thoughts on my side? I would say for founders that are building in the space, embrace speculation. Even though some people will say it's bad and it brings out the worst in people. I've heard it all. But if you look at the history of all of crypto since 2009, why did people buy bitcoin in the first place? They bought it because it was a counter narrative trend. And you can make money and speculate, especially if you had compared against gold. Right. That was the narrative and still the narrative today.
00:59:41.009 - 00:59:53.753, Speaker B: Like Hal Finney literally said, I don't know the exact quote, but he said something to the effect of Bitcoin has a chance to become a trillion dollar asset, so it would be worth to getting some just in case that bitcoin takes off. He literally said this.
00:59:53.849 - 01:00:07.103, Speaker A: And if for folks that don't know, Hal Finney, he was one of the engineers that worked very closely with Satoshi Nakamoto, the founder of bitcoin. Some say the halifini is Satoshi Nakamoto, but we won't know that he was.
01:00:07.119 - 01:00:11.703, Speaker B: The first person who received the first bitcoin transaction from Satoshi.
01:00:11.799 - 01:00:46.479, Speaker A: And I think that once people embrace this and once the industry embraces this, I think we could see a melting pot between the technical group side, the NFT community side, the speculative trading side. Because all of these groups, they don't talk to each other, they don't like each other. They think, you know, one thinks they're too good for this community. The other community thinks that they're too up on a pedestal. You know, I won't name names, but this is what's kind of happening in our dynamics. Once we embrace that it's all one, I think we can build some killer apps.
01:00:46.567 - 01:00:47.007, Speaker B: Agreed.
01:00:47.071 - 01:01:11.171, Speaker A: All right, well, this was, this was a fun episode because you and I have been in the space for a decade and we started out as degens. So degen. Being a degen at heart is it's always you just see different ideas and products differently versus others that come more from a technical research side. And I think, you know, where we're going to see most of the killer apps is going to be on the speculative side. So this was a fun podcast to do.
01:01:11.283 - 01:01:11.883, Speaker B: Likewise.
01:01:11.979 - 01:01:19.995, Speaker A: All right, well, thanks so much for listening. We'll see you again in the next couple weeks. Thanks. Thanks for listening to Good Game. Don't forget to subscribe. We'll see you next week.
