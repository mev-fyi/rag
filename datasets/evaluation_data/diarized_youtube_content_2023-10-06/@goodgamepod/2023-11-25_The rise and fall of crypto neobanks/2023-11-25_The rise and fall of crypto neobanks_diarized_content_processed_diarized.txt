00:00:23.358 - 00:00:42.814, Speaker B: Yeah, so I mean, that's pretty obvious why they failed. And they were only serving one use case, which was just yield and presumably mostly to Americans, I assume. I don't know if that statement's true or not. The opportunity for the next gen of Defi neo banks is USDT first, probably with a very strong and local geo focus.
