00:00:17.606 - 00:00:47.204, Speaker B: Yeah, people are used to sort of 30 years of increasing globalization. 2010 were actually at the peak of globalization, 30 years of that, and then 1020 years of extreme monetary experiments, experiments in monetary policies, and more recently, extreme experiments in fiscal policies. Post COVID, the fiscal policies may not change, in fact, might get even worse in the next ten years. But the other two multi decade megatrends are definitely reversing exciting times.
