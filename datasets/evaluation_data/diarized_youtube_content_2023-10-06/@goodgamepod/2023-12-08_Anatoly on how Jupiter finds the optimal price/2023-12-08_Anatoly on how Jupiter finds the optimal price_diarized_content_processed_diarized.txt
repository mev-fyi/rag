00:00:00.170 - 00:00:38.610, Speaker A: When you have like a thousand L2s, they're all separate little environments that are asynchronous from each other. It's very, very hard to have a guarantee that everything happens at the same time across all of them. And this is why, like, it's beautiful. When you like, do a 20 cent trade through Jupiter, like literally $0.20, it'll hit four different markets and trade them all to give you the best optimal price. It's like literally at the airport if you went to four different curriculum exchanges and be like, have $0.20, give me the optimal price, they would laugh at you, right? Because the work to do that and they'll give you a flat fee for each one of those trades.
00:00:38.610 - 00:00:57.340, Speaker A: It's impossible to actually scale it down. And this really demonstrates the sand and the gears between these asynchronous environments that all have to synchronize at different times. And each synchronization costs a fee and has to settle and the transfers all pay a fee and it's very, very hard to hide it.
