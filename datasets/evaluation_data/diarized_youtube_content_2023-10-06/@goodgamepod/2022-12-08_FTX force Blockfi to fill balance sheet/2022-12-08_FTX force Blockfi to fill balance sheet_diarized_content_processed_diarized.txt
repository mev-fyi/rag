00:00:00.120 - 00:00:19.102, Speaker A: There was a thread that talked about Blockfi's, like, assets. As soon as the acquisition happened, they forced the entire Aum of Blockfi, and they forced it onto FTX. So that is, like, another signal to tell us that, you know, this acquisition was primarily driven by the hole in the balance sheet, and they were trying to cover it up by more acquisitions.
00:00:19.198 - 00:00:24.350, Speaker B: Yeah. Using the customer funds of other c five companies that they acquired.
00:00:24.502 - 00:00:28.550, Speaker A: Yeah. At that point, it's. You're too big, it's too late. Right. Like, you're gonna fail.
00:00:28.622 - 00:00:42.414, Speaker B: Relatedly, I think people tweeted about this on Twitter, so it's not private anymore. But there's startups that raise money from FTX that were forced to store their treasury on FTX, and that was yet another way to plug the hole.
