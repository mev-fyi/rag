00:00:00.200 - 00:00:03.318, Speaker B: Is there anything you can do at this moment immediately?
00:00:03.446 - 00:00:28.604, Speaker A: If Alameda is a significant holder? There's not much you could do. I mean, there was an exchange, right? They gave you capital in return for future equity or tokens. And so the way you'd want to think about this is you have to allow the liquidators do their job in regards to where the token is going to go and how it's going to sit and how it's going to get distributed. I mean, this could take ten years, by the way, if you look at, like, Mount Gox, it took them over a decade, and people still haven't received their tokens.
00:00:28.684 - 00:00:35.604, Speaker B: My Gox coin are, they still haven't been given back to me, and it's been like eight years.
