00:00:00.250 - 00:00:04.190, Speaker A: Welcome to good game, your no BS Insights for crypto founders.
00:00:07.570 - 00:00:45.706, Speaker B: I guess Elliot and I both know that as much money as we raise through maybe a seed round, a series A, a series B, a series C, so on and so forth, none of that matters unless we find product market fit, and money isn't going to help us. Even if we raise like a $10 million seed round, even if we like, hire, you know, 20 engineers, that's not going to help us find product market fit faster than if we just hack away together, the two of us, and then find a product that people like because we talk to these early users. I think the glam and the glitz of raising a large seed round is really attractive to a lot of people and that boosts your ego. But at the end of the day, none of that matters. It's all about just building a product.
00:00:45.728 - 00:01:46.202, Speaker A: That'S looking for your next startup idea in crypto. Check out our request for startups list and get inspired at Alliance XYZ ideas. Welcome to good games. This is going to be an exciting episode. We're going to be talking about product market fit in crypto, and we're going to invite the team Tenzer to talk a bit about how they met, how do they validate their product, the market they're going after, and ultimately how they found success against magic Eden. And I feel like especially in crypto and all the startups that we've supported within our batches chow, I feel like product market fit has been a common topic, and one is because you're dealing with new crypto primitives, that you have this exciting new bleeding edge tech and you don't have the users or market that's pulling from. And so it's very hard to match a two today because we're so early in the space, especially in crypto, compared to more mature markets.
00:01:46.202 - 00:01:49.150, Speaker A: Yeah. Curious to hear your thoughts on this before we get started.
00:01:49.300 - 00:02:34.122, Speaker C: To a point. The space is so early, and one of the toughest jobs for founders is to identify the users they're going after, because there's actually two very large groups of users at a high level. One is the people who are not crypto natives, and the job of the founder is to bring them into crypto. And then the other user segment is those who are crypto natives. Those who have been in this space for a while are comfortable with metamask, et cetera. And for me, this is precisely the battle between Tensor and magic Eden, because magic Eden basically targeted the first user second and tensor targeted the second. It's also pretty much the same story behind Blur and Opensea.
00:02:34.186 - 00:02:34.510, Speaker D: Right.
00:02:34.580 - 00:02:56.646, Speaker C: Blur targeted the crypto natives, the pro traders, whereas Opensea targeted the non crypto natives. So we're going to talk about this, but I guess maybe to kick things off, maybe give the audience a little bit background about tensor. Like who is tensor? Exactly. And why is this discussion going to be a big deal?
00:02:56.748 - 00:04:01.898, Speaker A: Ilya and Richard, both the audience will get to meet, are two devs that met, and they built a couple of different products within crypto. In fact, one of the first products they built was an oracle for NFTs, and they iterated after a few glitches with customers that ultimately led them to Tenzer, which is the NFT pro trading marketplace. Before, on Solana, if you wanted to purchase NFTs, the only marketplace that was available was Magic Eden. And Magic Eden is very similar to OpenSea in that they targeted the general population of crypto users. And if you remember, when Magic Eden launched, they launched about probably about a year and a half ago, and it was probably around the last bull run. So you had a lot of new enthusiasts that wanted to come and speculate on NFTs, and they were able to serve that need because that's what the market asked for. But it turns out that there was a group of folks that weren't being addressed, and those are like the crypto native folks like you and I, and for us, we like data.
00:04:01.898 - 00:04:11.386, Speaker A: I even remember during the bull market where I would have like four or five different tabs open of just ways to validate whether or not I want to purchase NFT.
00:04:11.578 - 00:04:18.720, Speaker C: We like very high density user experience, and we also like buying 100 NFTs at the same time with one.
00:04:19.490 - 00:04:26.654, Speaker A: That's right. And I remember when an example gem launched the floor sweeping app, which ultimately is just a feature.
00:04:26.702 - 00:04:26.914, Speaker D: Right.
00:04:26.952 - 00:04:59.578, Speaker A: Just being able to. But we thought it was incredible. And so then you started to see floors getting wiped clean, and so you had some interesting add ons that ultimately led to what we call today blur and tensor. But the market was asking for it and the pro users weren't being addressed. And I think that's what Tensor did really well. But I also want to talk about, and maybe if you want to add a few points to that before we just talk about product market fit in web two and in crypto, if you have any other final points you want.
00:04:59.584 - 00:06:10.078, Speaker C: To add to that, just to add to what you said, this episode will be the most important episode if you are a founder in your early stage, because no one really talks about this stuff in crypto, and we touched on this stuff maybe here and there in the past, but we never dedicated a whole episode on this. So if you're a founder, this is going to be the most important episode for you. But even if you're an investor, one thing I see investors like, one of the most important alphas that investors are missing is the human aspect of things, because as great as crypto is, we're still very early, and we can rely completely on data, because the data, it doesn't tell the whole story. There is a lot of subjective things and things that happen behind the scenes. The characters of the founders, which we talked about in the past that have very strong predictive power on an asset that they're going to purchase. So even if you're an investor, I think this is going to be a really interesting episode for you to think about Tensor, but also think about how to evaluate founding teams in general. And, yeah, really excited, really excited about this episode.
00:06:10.174 - 00:06:54.642, Speaker A: Same. So we'll talk a bit about where did product market fit come from? Right. So Annie Ratchleff, who was the co founder of Benchmark, came up with that term in the early 2000, and the primary idea was, how do you get founders? What is important within product market fit? Is it the team? Is it the product, or is it the market? And he has this really famous quote that he says, which is very true today. When a great team meets a lousy market, market wins. When a lousy team meets a great market, market wins. But when a great team meets a great market, something special happens. So what it tells you, at least to me, was that market wins, right? Like, if you have team, you have product.
00:06:54.642 - 00:07:42.560, Speaker A: And market market is ultimately the biggest pull factor in validating your product. And he gives out a few really interesting examples. One example he gives was Google. And with Google, when Google launched a search business, it started taking market share from Yahoo, and they wanted to validate if they could get into the ads business. And at that time, if you wanted to put an ad on Yahoo, you have to pay $10,000 a month, and you have to hire a graphic designer, and you have to pay them $5,000 to design a banner. And so the market that they were fulfilling is just people, startup or companies that had money, like expendable cash. They're able to use this as a way to grow their product.
00:07:42.560 - 00:08:13.930, Speaker A: But for anyone else that wanted to get into the ads business, they couldn't. So Sergey and team decided that they're going to create their own ads business. And the way they're going to validate. This is by creating a text based ad. So instead of like, hiring a graphic designer, paying $10,000 a month, you just write a couple of lines of what you're selling and then publish it on Google Ads. And all you have to do is pay $1,000. And it turns out they won the startup scene because startups weren't able to get into the ads business.
00:08:13.930 - 00:08:47.350, Speaker A: And so a bunch of startups flocked to it, and then they kind of validated their beachhead, and from there they ended up growing up the stack until they took over Yahoo. And that's true with any startup, right? Like, you have to find a beachhead and you have to validate the product before you actually put resources behind it and grow out your team. So I thought that was like a very interesting learning moment, at least for me, because we tell our founders every, like, you know, find a beachhead, run lean, find a beachhead, and then validate the product that you're building.
00:08:47.500 - 00:09:45.778, Speaker C: Speaking of the market, which ultimately trumps everything, I think the other topic I really wanted to touch on with the tensor guys is Solana. What's happening in Solana? What's happening specifically in the NFTs on Solana? Why are they building on Solana? Why have they kept on building on Solana? Despite what happened last year with FTX? You and I have been telling our audience for the last like ten episodes since FTX that if you are bearish on Salana, you are wrong. And we'll find out why that's the case. The TLDR is the strongest views that you can form on an ecosystem or on an industry at large or on a vertical is ultimately coming from these bottom up analysis. These bottom up conversations with the people who are really working hard and deep in the weeds of building things. The top down views come from the bottom up analysis.
00:09:45.874 - 00:10:13.440, Speaker A: Yeah, agreed with that. I mean, I think the market's turning now. Like, most people are starting to get bullish on Solana. It's very interesting how sentiment affects the market. Sorry, founders and pretty much everyone in the ecosystem. I remember pretty early on, early this year, we've had investors that told our founders, including Tenzer, that they shouldn't build on Solana. Right.
00:10:13.440 - 00:10:33.398, Speaker A: And if you listen to feedback from investors or other folks and not listening to the market, then you fall into this trap of not being able to find product market fit because you're taking this feedback as a way to find success for your startup. But it turns out that you need to listen to your customers and the market that you're providing support for.
00:10:33.484 - 00:10:56.638, Speaker C: I remember Tensor got like maybe 15 O's from investors within a span of maybe two to three months. And the single most quoted reason is that they think Solana is dead. The VCs think Solana is dead. I don't know. I've been in this space at least four cycles now, and I can tell if a layer one is dead or not.
00:10:56.724 - 00:10:57.918, Speaker A: We've seen many of those.
00:10:58.004 - 00:11:09.298, Speaker C: We've seen many of those. There's people drawing analogies of Salana to EOS. So, like people calling Salana the yields 2.0. I can tell the yields 2.0 when I see it.
00:11:09.384 - 00:11:12.340, Speaker A: Yes. And there are some EOS 2.0s right now.
00:11:12.790 - 00:11:17.620, Speaker C: That's right. And Salana is not it. Salana is not EOS 2.0.
00:11:17.990 - 00:11:41.642, Speaker A: There are a couple of other things I want to ask the team Tenzer. I want to learn more about how they create the feedback loop with their customers early on. I think that's important for founders that are listening today, which is, how do I launch our product? Who should be our first customers, or how should I approach your first customers? How do we get feedback from those customers? And then how do we iterate over time? I felt like Tensor did that really well early on.
00:11:41.776 - 00:11:43.446, Speaker C: They did a fantastic job. That's right.
00:11:43.488 - 00:11:43.742, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:11:43.796 - 00:12:07.282, Speaker C: Basically, it's the things that don't scale that you have to do in the early days. And by the way, for those who are not aware, Paul Graham wrote a blog post maybe ten years ago. And I think that's the single most important blog post in the entire history of startups, is the do the things that don't scale. If you're going to read one article from Paul Graham, that's the one that you should read. We're going to touch on that as well with the tensor guys.
00:12:07.416 - 00:12:48.466, Speaker A: Speaking of Paul Graham, there's one other point he made, not in that article, but I think it was a couple of articles after that, which is, I always tell our founders this, which is, don't raise three to five, three to $10 million for your seed stage startup. Right. Raise very small and be lean with the capital they have. Be frugal with the capital you have, because it forces you to really build a minimal, viable product that would validate your hypothesis of the market that you're trying to serve. Oftentimes you hear about people that raise a lot of money, and what they end up doing is they think more about what should we be doing with this capital versus how do we validate our product and getting to product market fit.
00:12:48.568 - 00:12:48.930, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:12:49.000 - 00:13:08.674, Speaker C: And the tensor guys dethrone, Magic Eden with two guys, two devs. Magic Eden has a team of almost 100 with almost $200 million in VC funding, and tensor has maybe two or 3 million at most. And they barely used any of it. But they just raised their cash flow positive.
00:13:08.802 - 00:13:16.614, Speaker A: Yeah, but they just raised that, right. It wasn't like they raised it a year ago when they were like, this happened recently.
00:13:16.742 - 00:13:37.774, Speaker C: They just raised that. And I don't think all the money is in the bank yet. And they didn't use any of it because they're self sufficient from the cash flow that they generate from the marketplace, from the fees from the NFT trading. And it's probably the single most inspiring story that founders can hear about in this industry.
00:13:37.902 - 00:13:58.246, Speaker A: For founders that are listening, a couple of points I want to make. One is don't worry about raising capital right away. Don't worry about growing the team. Don't worry about all the things that everyone else is doing. What you need to focus on. And this is primarily the only thing that you need to focus on, is product market fit. Right.
00:13:58.246 - 00:14:43.240, Speaker A: Who are your core users and how are you going to serve them? And are they going to spend money or give you all the validation you need to continue to grow your team? That's like, the one thing that I want founders to think about in crypto. We don't need to hide this. There's just a lot of dry powder in crypto. And so crypto VCs are going to give you whatever you ask for, especially if you're building in a compelling area within the crypto market that hasn't been served yet. The question for you is, how do you be frugal? How do you stay lean? How do you get to product market fit and et cetera? And with our conversation with Tenzer, we're going to touch on all of this and how they did it with literally no startup funding until later on. So I'm excited to talk to team Tenzer. Let's get started.
00:14:43.240 - 00:15:08.654, Speaker A: Richard, Ilya. Great to have you guys. I know we've been talking to each other for quite a bit, especially through our accelerated program, which we'll touch a bit on. But we want to hear more about the tensor story and how you guys got started. Maybe if you could give us a quick, maybe one to two minute background on each of yourselves, and then we'll get started from there.
00:15:08.692 - 00:15:33.778, Speaker B: Yep. Thanks for having us. Imran and Chow, we've been chatting for quite a few months. You guys were there since the early days, so really appreciate the opportunity. I guess I'll give a bit of backstory on myself and then I'll hand it over to Ilya to tell his story. Before I started working on tensor and before I even got into crypto more seriously as a dev, I was working at a quantitative trading firm in New York City. It's called two Sigma.
00:15:33.778 - 00:16:36.710, Speaker B: So there I was doing essentially alpha research, taking machine learning and statistical models, taking a bunch of data, whether it's technical data, fundamentals, data, creating features, and then trying to predict stock returns, essentially. So it was a very research and engineering focused role that I had. It wasn't until sort of like a year or two in into the pandemic when I sort of had the entrepreneurial itch to try something different. And that's when I started to basically try to look for a co founder. Went through the YC Startup school program, which is sort of this free program online that anyone can join, and was just basically going through a bunch of profiles to find a co founder I could seemingly work with and hopefully start something together. And that's sort of like when I came across Ilia's profile, which was very interesting to me because he had been building in web3 for quite a while and had enough GitHub open source projects to show for. And that's like one high signal for a good co founder is if they have a really good GitHub profile.
00:16:36.870 - 00:17:15.286, Speaker D: Cool. I think I said this to Chris, our investor, and ever since, he's kind of stuck with me. There's only really three things I've been excited about in life, and that's basically gaming, tech and finance. I think crypto is kind of in the middle of all those three. And so I think I was just kind of destined to end up in crypto one way or another, I guess. I did a lot of gaming when I was a kid, up until the age 20 ish, and then ended up going into investment banking, hated it, kind of became a self dev and got into tech and, yeah, fun story. I almost didn't put up that profile on YC startup school because I thought it was silly, it was like tender for co founders, but I thought, whatever, I'll just do it, see what happens.
00:17:15.286 - 00:17:37.182, Speaker D: And then Richard reached out, I looked at his background and I told my better half, I said, he's going to laugh me out of a call because he was two sigma, all of that, and I was like a self taught dev. And I thought, he's going to laugh me out of a call and, yeah, here we are, I guess a year and a half later, building tensor. So that's the story.
00:17:37.316 - 00:17:57.810, Speaker C: Ilya, I remember you said, I forgot which one of you said this, but you said that your co founder is the greatest edge that tensor has. And was it you, Ilya, who you were originally based in Europe, and you flew from Europe to Toronto in order to work with Richard on site, face to face?
00:17:57.960 - 00:17:59.426, Speaker D: Yeah, that's right.
00:17:59.528 - 00:18:01.906, Speaker C: Yeah, tell us about it. What made you make that decision?
00:18:02.018 - 00:18:33.866, Speaker D: Dude, honestly, it was like a no brainer, because at that point, I was looking to found something with somebody for about a year, and I tried every possible option. I tried asking friends, and I tried asking people I worked with, and I tried finding people in Solana discord to build something. And every time, it just didn't go well. Some people just weren't committed, others just didn't have the technical jobs. It was, like, all over the place. And I was basically at a point where I was deciding that, okay, I'm probably going to be a solo founder, because just can't find a co founder. And then I met Richard.
00:18:33.866 - 00:18:52.114, Speaker D: We did a trial project together, remotely, worked together for a month. And it was just like, we got done with the two of us. I would have probably done with, like, five people or something. It was just incredible. And so then I told my better half, I said, I think this is it. I just have to go and try. And she said, we'll just book tickets.
00:18:52.114 - 00:19:02.154, Speaker D: And we just booked all the way flights to Toronto. We came here on a tourist visa, stayed for six months, and then halfway through, we're like, all right, well, I guess we got to figure out more serious visas, and the rest was history.
00:19:02.272 - 00:19:24.782, Speaker A: A follow up question is, a lot of founders are always looking for co founders, and they're looking to connect and build product, and oftentimes those matches don't work out. I'm curious on, did you guys have an internal checklist? How did you validate that? Maybe Richard or Ilya were the right people to work with for the next decade. What were some of the internal checklists that you guys use to validate that?
00:19:24.836 - 00:20:20.738, Speaker B: Yeah, it's funny you mentioned a checklist, because I think we did exactly that. Or rather, I think Ilya had a checklist. And he basically, when we first met, he basically told me to fill this out, and then we'll go on another call to chat about it, which is kind of funny, because Ilya mentioned that he had been spending a year trying to find a co founder. But for me, I was actually just starting to find a co founder, and I hadn't actually gone through basically chewing glass of trying to find a good co founder. And so my expectations were like, maybe I'll talk, get on a phone and chat with a bunch of people, get a feel for who might be fun to work with, and then actually work on a trial project together for a week on my end to figure out if this person is a good person to work with as a. But, you know, I personally didn't have a checklist prepared or ready to fill out and to check off. So it was quite interesting initially when I first met Ilya and he had a checklist for us.
00:20:20.738 - 00:21:15.470, Speaker B: But I think in hindsight, it really worked out well because, one, it sort of gets you to think more intellectually honest about why you're doing this and what kind of co founder are you exactly? And what kind of co founder are you looking for? So some things on that checklist includes, what is your motivation? Is it money? Is it building something cool? Is it building something large and impressive? Is it the fame and the glory that comes with it? I think that's something that every co founder should talk about before they even start working together because I think that will just understanding your co founder's motivations will help you figure out whether or not you want to work with this person, whether or not your motivations are aligned as well as going forward. It gives you an idea of how do you give your co founder what you want and how do you both accomplish the same goals that you both want to achieve.
00:21:15.550 - 00:21:56.338, Speaker D: And I guess to quickly add to that, I think a checklist like that is sort of like hiring interview in a sense that it will not help you figure out if this is the right person, but it will help you figure out if this is the wrong person pretty quickly. Because when people say things like, oh, well, my expectation is I work five days a week, or my expectation is that I want to sell out at this price. You just benchmark that with your expectation, and you can very quickly tell, like, okay, this is not going to work, but just like hiring interviews, it's not going to tell you if it's the right person because to be honest, really smart guys, they understand what you're looking to hear and they will tell you exactly that. And so you're not going to know.
00:21:56.424 - 00:22:08.194, Speaker A: And you mentioned you did a small work project with each other before it became crystallized. What was it within that work project that kind of gave you the crystallization that you're going to be working with as founder for the next ten years.
00:22:08.312 - 00:22:08.546, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:22:08.568 - 00:23:13.382, Speaker B: I think the biggest thing about sort of the trial and what I got out of it was that, I think, for me, I was mainly looking for someone who had a similar or even higher work ethic than me. I think that's super important. So I think the best prior experience I had with this is just working on group projects together in school, in university, even in high school, you get a sense that if you're the only one sort of pulling the weight of the entire group, then it's not very fun to work in that environment. If you're the only one who's willing to put in the work, putting the time to actually get things done, then obviously it doesn't become a group project, it doesn't become fun for you, and over time, you get burnt out. So I think one of the important things I was looking for from a trial with anyone was someone who was willing to put in the same work ethic, as well as someone who obviously knows their stuff, doesn't need a lot of handholding, who's independent. And I think from that two, three week trial, which we know the project itself was just like some intellectually curious thing that we wanted to build. It was an NFT pricing oracle.
00:23:13.382 - 00:23:30.222, Speaker B: We later submitted that to one of the first Solana hackathons, Solana Riptide. We actually placed third, which was pretty good, but it was like a project that let us both experiment with how we work together, how we communicate, and what kind of work ethic we both are willing to put in.
00:23:30.276 - 00:23:55.174, Speaker C: I remember that was the idea you submitted to alliance in your alliance application. I think we told you on the call that the idea is a bad idea, but we liked you so much that we wanted to work with you, both of you. But walk us through how you went from that idea to where tensor is today.
00:23:55.292 - 00:24:29.570, Speaker D: Actually, a really important detail is, and this is like a huge shout out to Salana, because I really think that they're doing something right here. So, together with the third place came a bit of money. Specifically, it was like 30 grand. And that 30 grand actually paid for our offices and our expenses for, like, six months. And then later, we got a second place in another Salona hackathon, this time with the trading product. That got us another 30 grand, which paid for another six months of expenses. And together with the AWS credits that you guys have helped us get, we basically didn't need any funding for over a year.
00:24:29.570 - 00:25:10.494, Speaker D: And so that gave us a year with zero pressure to focus on fundraising, to try to create a beautiful story for investors, just to know, just to see what sticks. So I think anybody who's thinking about funding anything, I think something like Solana hackathons, where you actually can basically fund yourself by putting your skills and ambitions to work, is just a great way of doing it. Yeah. So I guess how we went from that idea to tensor, that trade was we built the oracle. We spoke to a bunch of protocols, and we realized two things. One, the market for an NFT pricing oracle was very small. There were only a handful of protocols that would actually pay for it, and it was just not enough to build a big enough business.
00:25:10.494 - 00:25:54.158, Speaker D: So then the question was, okay, do we go more into data, or do we go more into financialization of NFTs? And we felt that the data landscape was pretty packed. There were a lot of really smart teams, including Helios, who we know really well, building, and we just frankly didn't think we could compete there. And then the financialization landscape for NFTs in particular was, like, bare naked. There's like, barely anything. There were, like three marketplaces, one lending tool, and three things on Ethereum, and that was it. I guess most people saw NFTs as a toy, and we sort of saw the beginning of a new asset class where like, hey, it's just anything digital and non fungible. And if you extrapolate that thought forward, then you start to think about all the financial primitives that need to exist in the future.
00:25:54.158 - 00:26:16.530, Speaker D: So we started thinking about perps, and we started thinking about options and things we can build. And they were like, wait a second. But in order to do that, the first thing you need is a two sided order book where you have both bids and asks. And for anybody who doesn't remember, that was the time when there were no bids. There were no collection wide bids. There was literally no bid side of the book. And so initial inclination was to build a trading product where you would have both.
00:26:16.530 - 00:26:29.522, Speaker D: And then added to that, we sort of started thinking about, like, well, what if it was faster? What if it was more analytical? What if there was more data? There was a chart and all of that. And that sort of led us to this whole version of pro NFT trading on Solana.
00:26:29.586 - 00:27:54.286, Speaker B: Yeah, to add on to that, I don't think it was clear what exactly we were going to build at the time. We had a couple of other ideas that we were playing around with, like a buyer of last resort, which we think is something that needs to happen in NFTs eventually. But how exactly do we get there? We can't just build a protocol that's like a buyer of last resort protocol that will just suddenly be able to acquire a bunch of users and get them to use it and build up liquidity that is required for a buyer of last resort. We basically thought that we have to build the entire end to end user experience from the front end all the way down to the protocol in order to bootstrap the liquidity and the users required to build out this bar of last resource protocol. And that turned out to be like building, almost like an exchange interface for NFTs where we can slowly acquire users first by building an aggregator, which we knew at the time was something that people needed and wanted to use, and then slowly sort of like using that to bootstrap our own liquidity, including a bid side and an ask side. And now it turns out our bid side is a very good buyer of last resort for a lot of protocols, like these NFT lending protocols on Solana that needs to liquidate NFTs whenever a loan goes to underwater. I guess one of the takeaways I think we got from this was that don't think too abstractly or don't think you need to build a perfect protocol from the very beginning and then try to sell that protocol to consumers.
00:27:54.286 - 00:28:07.730, Speaker B: Think about building a consumer app that people need. And then maybe the ultimate result of it is you build this really cool protocol that happens to fulfill a use case that we think is necessary, which is like a buyer of last resort.
00:28:07.810 - 00:28:50.018, Speaker C: I think you brought up a really important point, which is that you have an envision for where NFTs are going. Basically you think of NFTs as this new asset class and you work backwards from that envision into the current status quo. What is needed? Right, because you go from the envision to, oh, maybe we need perps and options and buyers of last resort. But then you realize in order to build all these things, you actually need a two sided spot market. And so you start building something that can be immediately useful to a lot of people that haven't been built. And you start from this point and eventually you can work forward into that envision. So that's my takeaway.
00:28:50.114 - 00:29:12.958, Speaker A: How did you assess that buyers of last resort was such a big problem that you wanted to solve? How did you get to that point from thinking about NFT, Oracle price feeds, and then thinking about this underserved market? Did you do customer interviews? Did you see users that were complaining on Twitter or did you just say, hey, look, we figured that this was a market that was unserved and we wanted to pursue it.
00:29:13.044 - 00:29:57.802, Speaker D: Yeah, it was a mixture of feedback and hunches, where there's some feedback from lending protocols who were talking to that, that's something they wanted. But to be honest, probably more than 50% of it was us kind of saying, we just have a hunch that you need it. Given where the altcoin market has gone, and most likely NFTs will go like, it's a market. Right. And it's going to mature and become more efficient over time. And if that is to happen, then you just need this primitive. I think for founders, they just have to walk this very delicate line of listening to users and to other people, but also listening to yourself, because ultimately, those people aren't starting a company, you are.
00:29:57.802 - 00:30:09.882, Speaker D: And so you need to trust that your vision and your hunch is correct. And if it's not correct, then you have to validate that as fast as possible and get to the next hunch.
00:30:10.026 - 00:30:21.170, Speaker C: And Ilya, before you got to that final idea, the order book idea, how long, both you and Richard, how long had you been in crypto, or paying attention to the markets, at least?
00:30:21.240 - 00:30:29.302, Speaker D: I think it was a bit more than Richard. I spent like a year, maybe a year and a half, and I think Richard was just kind of jumping in. So maybe like two, three months?
00:30:29.436 - 00:30:40.758, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I was, like, dabbling on Coinbase, but not seriously. I was dabbling in Coinbase on 2017, but I didn't really get into crypto until March of 2022. Shit.
00:30:40.774 - 00:30:42.780, Speaker A: Coining. Notice them.
00:30:43.150 - 00:30:44.140, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
00:30:44.910 - 00:31:30.338, Speaker C: Because what I noticed is that it usually takes founders at least six to twelve months of getting really deep into crypto before figuring something that works, figuring out an idea that has a promising future. Because this hunch that you said, Ilya, this hunch doesn't come out of nowhere. It's something that you can only build once you've truly immersed yourself into this industry. Until then, you won't have a good hunch, you won't have good judgment, you won't have good sense, and it takes a lot of talking to observing Twitter, or talking to customers or whatever, but ultimately, I tend to agree with you. The best ideas tend to come from this hunch, which takes six to twelve months to really build.
00:31:30.524 - 00:32:09.858, Speaker A: Agreed. I mean, Chow, you and I have used d five for a few years, NFTs for a few years. We know what's missing. Right. And so that hunch of, like, I wish there was a way to sweep the floors of NFTs as an example. And then all of a sudden you have gem, and then all the pro traders flock to that, and then the next iteration of that is like, well, I wish I had data, because data is an important factor in assessing whether or not you want to buy NFTs. And then people went from this open marketplace like Opensea, to gem, then to this gem, which is kind of like an aggregator, then to something more like pro trading, where you have the data and all the other analysis that's needed to make an informed NFT purchase.
00:32:09.954 - 00:33:12.506, Speaker B: Yeah, actually, to add on to that, the reason why we decided to build a pro trading product might have been like the accumulation of a couple of acute problems that we ourselves personally experienced, as well as personally have heard from the community. So I'll give you an example. The reason why we wanted to push forward on the real time aspect so much like try to make the fastest NFT exchange or NFT marketplace on Solana was because at the time when we were thinking about pivoting away from the oracle, we were actually trading NFTs ourselves. There were these really hot mints, like new NFT collections that were minting and selling on Magikeden and all the other marketplaces that were around. One of the biggest problems I experienced was trying to sweep these NFTs when there was a lot of trading going on. And the issue was that a lot of these marketplaces had very stale data, which meant me as a dGen user who's clicking through the UI versus running a bot, I was unable to purchase any NFT from the floor because the data wasn't fast enough. It wasn't coming in fast enough.
00:33:12.506 - 00:33:32.766, Speaker B: So me as a human user, can't buy these NFTs. I think that was like one large motivation for why we felt that real time was going to be one of the end states for NFT trading. Obviously, this doesn't occur every single time, it only happens for new mints. But at the time, new mints were a large part of the NFT market.
00:33:32.948 - 00:33:34.654, Speaker A: You had something to add, maybe just.
00:33:34.692 - 00:34:04.970, Speaker D: Wanted to add that. I think hunch is important, but I guess for a founder, there's actually another variable that is equally as important, and that's the size of the opportunity. So you can have a really good hunch about something that's needed, but that might be able to serve twelve and a half people. And at that point, you don't have a business because there's not enough for you to hire people and grow and become a profitable company. And that was kind of our story with the Oracle. The Oracle had a customer. In fact, we had more people asking for access by the time we shut it down.
00:34:04.970 - 00:34:26.290, Speaker D: The problem was that we couldn't see how we grew out of there because what are you going to do after you've served three out of the nine potential customers in crypto and now you're out of people to call, right? And so you really need to not only think about, okay, is this something that I feel is needed and not done yet, but you also need to ask yourself, if this is successful, how big can this be? And the answer to that question is really important.
00:34:26.440 - 00:35:05.226, Speaker A: This is a very important point you're mentioning, which is iterating and pivoting is a large part of how startups actually find the product that they want to build to assess a big market. And so it seems that what you've done was assess the product that you built and you realize that this isn't the right market because the market isn't big enough. And so you decided to move away from that. How hard was that for you to do? What would you tell a founder that is doing something similar? What should they be thinking about when they're in a place where they validate their product, but maybe they're blindsided by how big the market is or whether or not to pour more resources into developing this product further.
00:35:05.338 - 00:35:49.322, Speaker B: For us, it was not as difficult as I would imagine if we had gotten traction. Yeah, the lucky thing that happened to us was that none of our users really paid us or none of the customers that we talked to really paid us or tried to implement us. If they had done that, I think we would have held on a bit longer to false hope and not reevaluate how big the market actually is for us. Most of them said, we'll implement it after we implement X, Y and Z. And we're like, okay, we'll give you a few weeks. And then we circle back a few weeks later and they were also saying like, oh, some other priority came up. So that was a pretty telling sign for us to maybe this isn't as big of a pain point for them.
00:35:49.322 - 00:36:34.634, Speaker B: And there were only like five people we were talking to. And so even if we got all five of these people to sign on, we'd be making maybe a couple of month if they paid us like X amount. I think for other founders who may be seeing a bit of traction but might be blindsided by the market size, I think it's really difficult. I think one thing that helped us was, again, going with our intuition and going with our hunch of do we want to be doing this for the rest of our lives? Do we want to be trying to pry teeth from these protocols and trying to sell them this oracle thing that they're taking like a few weeks to think about? And I think the answer to that for both of us was no, we don't want to be spending the rest of our time trying to convince these protocols to use this oracle. It doesn't feel like we're building a successful business.
00:36:34.752 - 00:36:54.666, Speaker C: So once you pivoted from the NFT pricing oracle to this two sided order book marketplace for pro traders, what did you do to acquire your first ten to 100 customers? Because you must have done a lot of things in an extremely brute force way on the customer acquisition side of things, what did you do? What are some of the creative things that you've done?
00:36:54.788 - 00:37:25.386, Speaker D: Yeah, we found a couple of lists off really active NFT wallets on Solana. Some of those lists were associated with Twitter accounts. And so we were able to go Twitter by Twitter and just message people, send them like a screenshot of the product and just say, look, this is what we're building. Do you want to be in the beta? And this is like June, August? No, this was even before it was May. August, yeah, sorry, May to June last year. And, yeah, we were just basically like going Twitter to Twitter, asking people how.
00:37:25.408 - 00:37:29.594, Speaker C: Did you match the addresses with their Twitter accounts? Is it the sol?
00:37:29.792 - 00:37:57.666, Speaker D: There were a couple analytics portals that did that for free. And so we just went there, we had the address and we could kind of look up Twitter. It wasn't just to be clear, this wasn't always possible. Like out of the top 100, maybe like 30, we could match. And then out of those 30, maybe, I don't know, five came back to us and out of those five, three said, we'll do it, and didn't laugh at us. So it wasn't a lot of people. After like a month or two of messaging people, we had 50 guys in the telegram group.
00:37:57.666 - 00:38:20.106, Speaker D: And with those guys, we rolled out the first version, we showed it to them, they said, holy shit, it works. And then they gave us a bunch of feedback how they can't find any buttons. They don't understand how to switch tabs. Everything is confusing. The frog was one page, by the way, back then. So the fact that they couldn't find how to switch tabs or anything, then that we really fucked up on the UX and, yeah, we just slowly iterated from there, I guess.
00:38:20.208 - 00:38:42.722, Speaker C: But even the 50 people that you Dm that eventually joined your telegram. They're not enough to solve the costar problem because you're ultimately building a marketplace of NFTs. You need people who list NFTs and you need people who buy the NFTs. So I assume those guys, when those 50 people first come to our website, there is no NFT to trade. So how do you solve the cold start problem?
00:38:42.856 - 00:40:06.410, Speaker B: Yeah, so we actually didn't solve the cold start problem. Our first product was an aggregator, and we knew there's going to be a cold start problem if you just built the marketplace from the outset, we had to essentially build a product where we can just get users in and they'll have something to do without solving that cold start problem. So, yes, you're entirely right that it would be impossible for us to do what we did and try to build a marketplace from the very beginning. I think for us, those 50 users, one thing that was interesting was that even though that's, like, in absolute terms, it's not a lot of users, one thing that we looked at was like, how often were these people coming back? Did they just come initially and show up and just not use the product ever again? Or did they retain week over week and actually come use the product for whatever reason that they're using it for? It was a weak indicator because obviously the data is noisy, but retention rate was a good early indicator that we had something there that people wanted that was differentiated enough. So it was differentiated enough. And so we started talking to users, and the one thing that they mentioned was that our platform was better for, let's say, new mints because we had faster data and it would come to tensor versus the existing marketplaces or the existing agitators, because we did that very well. We just sort of, like, dug into that and kept building the product until we had more and more users before we considered actually building our own liquidity and trying to tackle the two sided dynamics of a marketplace.
00:40:06.490 - 00:40:24.846, Speaker C: So you built an aggregator that aggregates existing marketplaces. You didn't have a cold start problem to solve. You built something immediately useful to people that brought your initial set of users in. And then how did you transition from this to this two sided marketplace where there is a costar problem? How did you make that transition smooth?
00:40:24.958 - 00:41:28.870, Speaker D: Yeah. To be honest, the little bit of alpha here was that we were a little bit forced, and that's because at the time, there was a single marketplace on Salana that controlled 90% of the volume. And those guys basically pulled our key and they just thought that tensor could do damage in the future. They pulled our key, and we could be an effective aggregator. And if you go and look at our stats at that time, we lost probably 80% of our users within a week because people, there was no reason to come back to tensor anymore. And that was like a pretty, I guess, eye opening moment for us because we realized that even if we somehow persuade them to give us the key back, then what happens in a month when they pull it again? So that was kind of like, okay, we set out to build a product, and we have a bunch of users that like us, and it sounds like they're telling their friends, which was really important, so why don't we just try and build it? And so at that point, this whole excitement wave for Amms on Ethereum, and we thought, okay, well, maybe we can build one of the first amms on Solana. And that's how tensorswap, the amm, got started and how we launched it later on.
00:41:28.870 - 00:41:54.910, Speaker D: Today, tensor is not just an amm, it's an amm. It's an aggregator. It's a normal marketplace. It's like so many different things in one. But at the time, it was like this kind of amm functionality, but that was also pretty cool because that was differentiated to the existing wave of marketplaces. And so that, again, gave certain people a reason to go and check us out. And from there, we just started growing a user base from the 50 guys to 100 guys to 200 guys, and kind of got to, like one 2% market share.
00:41:54.910 - 00:42:32.550, Speaker D: Yeah. And I think, really there was a moment when FTX collapsed in December when it kind of felt a little bit hopeless because we were struggling to get past the one 2% of users, and we didn't see why was it not clicking. Even though we were listening to feedback, iterating the product every week, shipping all the features, we could not see why it was not clicking. It was almost like, imagine, like you have a jar of water and you kind of add, add, and then somebody just tips over. And that's exactly what happened. We're just like, adding features, listening to users, and then one day there's like 3% market share, 4%, 5%, 10%. It was like, insane.
00:42:32.550 - 00:42:48.958, Speaker D: And then all of a sudden, we're like 30, 40, and that's just like, unthinkable numbers three months ago and looking backwards, I think it's a mixture of things, right? It's a bit of luck. It's a lot of hard work. It's about being in the right place at the right time. Getting the right people involved in the seed round. So there's a lot of variables.
00:42:49.054 - 00:43:21.786, Speaker A: One thing I wanted to touch on, just going back a little bit earlier, which is the feedback loop that you had with those 50 people that you invited. How did you create that feedback loop? Like, did you start your own telegram chat? Did you invite everyone to that chat? Did you ask for feedback? The biggest problem that I see startups make is taking feedback from the customers and implementing it. And it turns out it was really bad feedback. So how do you decisively choose what's the right feedback versus what's the wrong feedback? And then how do you create that feedback loop so that you get to where you are today with the jar tipping over?
00:43:21.888 - 00:43:44.958, Speaker B: Yeah. So we messaged all of these people through Twitter or through connections. Maybe our initial priority referred someone else. So we would create essentially a telegram chat with every single one of them. But we also had a group telegram chat. I mean, there were only like 50 to 100 people, and so we could create a group telegram chat without it becoming unmanageable. And then we also had a discord.
00:43:44.958 - 00:44:26.266, Speaker B: I think the most effective thing for us initially was just like chatting with these people individually and are sort of like three person DMs. That's because they don't feel like they don't have the bystander effect of not giving feedback, because there's like 50 other people in the group who can give feedback. And also if we dm them directly, it puts the pressure on them to respond to us. Initially, a lot of users will be maybe a bit hesitant to give you feedback just because it takes some time. They're not sure if they'll offend you. It's very difficult to get good feedback from users without really pushing them. And it's a bit like prying teeth, where you have to get them going for them to give you useful information.
00:44:26.266 - 00:45:14.238, Speaker B: I think on the point about not implementing feedback that turns out to be bad. I think one thing that, I don't know who mentioned it, but you should never implement solutions that your users suggest. You should always listen to their problems and try to across a bunch of user feedback, try to dissect what are the most important problems your current users are facing. Because the one thing that users will never tell you is the thing that you should be building. But they'll always tell you in hints, like one way or another, that these are the problems that they're facing. And you kind of have to read between the lines to figure out what those problems were. For us, a lot of people were telling us, oh, you should maybe add this additional statistic to your platform, because I see the statistic on this other platform and it's useful for me to see it all on one screen.
00:45:14.238 - 00:45:28.614, Speaker B: So the only thing that they can tell you is what they know. And that may not necessarily be the thing that helps you build a successful product. It's usually the things that doesn't exist that they can't really tell you what it is that you have to figure out on your own by listening to their problems.
00:45:28.812 - 00:46:17.998, Speaker C: Richard, what you just said there about listening to your customers problems, not their solutions, is the single most frequent phrase that I tell our founders in this batch, because for whatever reason, they love doing user surveys, those quantitative surveys, where they ask users, do you want this feature? Do you want that feature, et cetera, et cetera. And I tell them, first of all, quantitative service in this early stage is pretty much useless. And two, you cannot ask them for solutions. You need to understand the problems because they don't know what they want. They don't know what's the best solution for them, but they know what their problem is. Your job as a founder is figure out their problems, then propose a solution to them, not the other way around. So really good insight there.
00:46:18.104 - 00:46:58.174, Speaker A: Another final point is you also want to know who your target customers. You know, maybe some of those customers aren't your target customers, and then you automatically, by accident serve your product to a group of customers that weren't yours right to begin with. And so it really changes your focus. And I think from one of the Mark Anderson published his paper called the only thing that matters that talks about product market fit. And one thing he highlights is when you're building product, don't iterate right in the sense that that will take you away from your target customers. Stay focused on the customer. Just continue to listen and get feedback and understand what are the problems that you're trying to solve.
00:46:58.302 - 00:47:30.106, Speaker D: I think there's a lot of blog posts around product market fit that emphasize analytical thinking. And I think we're both pretty analytical. And for me personally, that's sort of always been the way I thought about it. But actually in recent years, I came to think that's the wrong way to think about it. I think analytics take you that far. But what really gets you to product market fit is, frankly, your intuition. At some point you as the entrepreneur just put down the flag and just say, my understanding of the market is such, and I think this is going to work and you ship it.
00:47:30.106 - 00:48:04.806, Speaker D: And if it doesn't work, then you admit the fader and you ship the next thing. And I think there's like two really important things here. One is you have to have strong beliefs weekly held, where if you believe in something, you take it to a logical conclusion and you see if it works. And the second one is, if that logical conclusion ends up bringing you not the results you expected, you have to ask quickly dispense of it and just say, okay, this is wrong. What's the next idea? That's like the closest, I think, listening to users, yes, of course, works, but it doesn't work in a sense that it tells you what to build. It actually builds up your intuition. That's what it does.
00:48:04.806 - 00:48:10.890, Speaker D: Because the more you listen to users, the better your hunch becomes. And it's ultimately your hunch that is going to make or break your company.
00:48:11.040 - 00:48:14.758, Speaker C: Talking to users is basically fine tuning your own neural network.
00:48:14.854 - 00:48:15.402, Speaker D: Exactly.
00:48:15.536 - 00:49:03.046, Speaker C: Which is a black box to you, to yourself, and to everyone else. But the more you talk to them, the more fine tuned your own neural network is. And the other thing I wanted to touch on is you mentioned that your traction was basically flat and sometimes down due to competitors pulling the plug on you. So it was flat for several months, until all of a sudden things just started picking up. It sounds like these months of flat traction, in hindsight, it was a combination of a bunch of things that you've built, which all of it led to this sudden growth. Like none of the work that they've done during these many months of flat flatness was wasted. It all led to this eventual growth.
00:49:03.046 - 00:49:33.220, Speaker C: And then I remember at the outset of this sudden growth, that was the time you started pitching investors for your fundraise. And I just can't remember how many no's you got from investors, but eventually you power through it. You raised after maybe two to three months of fundraising effort, and you got a bunch of no's from investors because Solana was dead. Quote unquote, solana was dead because of FTX. Any lessons that you've learned during these three months of pain.
00:49:33.830 - 00:50:02.522, Speaker B: So, on the flat traction part, obviously, flat metrics are not great for any startup, because startups are supposed to grow. If you don't grow, you're dying. I think for us, one thing that helped, one thing that was positive that we kind of looked at, was retention, as I mentioned earlier, because if you're not actively acquiring users, if you're not shoveling money to do marketing and acquire users, but you still have consistently the same group of users coming back, then that's a positive signal.
00:50:02.586 - 00:50:04.654, Speaker C: What was your four week retention rate?
00:50:04.772 - 00:50:26.830, Speaker B: Our retention wake rate was probably around 30% at the time. 30 40% four weeks out. That's decently high. It's not like great, but it's good. And I think that gave us a bit of confidence that we're not just like building a leaky bucket. If you were actually putting a lot of money in and acquiring users, then sure your metrics will go up. But if you have a leaky bucket, none of that matters.
00:50:26.830 - 00:51:09.182, Speaker B: So I think that's like one important thing is that we knew that we weren't shoveling money into acquiring users and we didn't have a leaky bucket. So Ilya mentioned we had this explosive growth all of a sudden. I think a lot of it was probably due to timing and luck. I think that undeniably was on our side. Throughout this entire journey, I think we had essentially met the right people. So one person who actually was a power user of our product was working at Solana Ventures at the time, and he connected us with this group of essentially like power NFT users or power NFT Salana users. It was this group of like 50 people who were like whales who had a ton of money, who did a bunch of stuff on Salana.
00:51:09.246 - 00:51:10.578, Speaker D: Shout out shoe and head.
00:51:10.664 - 00:52:04.030, Speaker B: Yeah, that's the private group DM name. And they just liked our product and continued to use it and showed it to their friends and they were doing a nontrivial amount of volume. So when we actually implemented our own liquidity and had our own marketplace, these guys were one of the biggest traders on our platform. And that helped a lot with the cold start problem. We also got lucky with working with partnering up with other platforms when it comes to marketing, when it comes to integrating our platform into theirs, and we would integrate their platforms into their platform into ours. And then of course, the whole blur wave really helped us in picking up the narrative at the very end. It was almost like the thing that sealed the deal for us to take off on Solana, because undeniably like they them launching a token really helped us in getting a bunch of people to pay attention to our platform versus other marketplaces on Salana.
00:52:04.110 - 00:52:54.686, Speaker A: Yeah, I wanted to go back a bit and talk about the competitive landscape when you decided to go into the NFT marketplace. I remember at the time you and I were chatting about this, there was 90% market share for Magic Eden, and we talked about it and you said, this is the market we're going to enter. I said, okay. And so oftentimes we get founders that say, well, I don't want to build this market because dominant person company X is building this space. And so they end up serving another product or customer base that ultimately doesn't work out. So why did you enter this market, even though knowing that you had Magic Eden, you had hateswap, et cetera? And then number two was, Solana's narrative was diminishing. What made you say, this is where we're going to build? And then thinking about the competitive landscape.
00:52:54.718 - 00:52:56.878, Speaker B: Of magiciden, I'll start with the Solana.
00:52:56.894 - 00:53:28.560, Speaker D: Part, because that one is easier to answer. I think what we saw from the inside was that the ratio of community excitement and stuff being built to fud was just silly. There was a lot of really cool stuff happening compared to literally other ghost change where you go. And there's like three developers in the discord. Even during the time when FTX went to $10, in fact, when FTX went to, sorry, Salana went to $10, Salana hit its record NFT volume. It was like 600,000 sold per day. That is crazy.
00:53:28.560 - 00:54:22.698, Speaker D: So I think to us, that was a signal that no matter what, Salon is going to be fine. I think the second question was, the first one is more difficult to answer, right? Like, how do you decide to go into a market which already has, well, you could call them winners, right? Or like just very successful participants. And the answer to that is, first of all, you should almost never pick a market that doesn't have any participants, because chances are that market doesn't exist unless you have a very specific hunch, a very specific inclination of how the world is going to change in the next, whatever your timeline is, that that market starts existing. This is what the opensea guys did, right? They said, yes, the NFT market today doesn't exist, but we will go and build with the understanding that it will exist. And all kudos in the world to those guys, because I think that's probably the bravest thing for a founder to do. But outside of that, you're looking at the market. It probably has the market participant.
00:54:22.698 - 00:54:55.942, Speaker D: The only question that matters is, can you segment this market in some interesting way so that all of a sudden that competitor is not a competitor? Because when we went in with our first tool, if you had seen it, you would very quickly understand that this was not a competitor to magic Eden because it was super nerdy, it was super analytical. It was basically looking like Bloomberg. Anybody who hasn't been coming from that world looked very skeptically at it. But the people that did come from that world. They loved it, right, because it was exactly what they used. It's exactly what they wanted. And so I would actually say that in the beginning we didn't compete directly.
00:54:55.942 - 00:55:19.218, Speaker D: It was only maybe like now that we're both kind of like magic in is implementing features that we have to make their product more advanced. We're implementing features that they have to make our product more consumer friendly, that we're kind of like more head to head. But I think at the time that wasn't the case. So the answer is segmentation. Like can you find an interesting segment in the market that the other competitors overlooking? And do you have a hunch for why that segment is actually going to be important?
00:55:19.384 - 00:55:55.946, Speaker A: An interesting lesson there for founders is, and you see this all the time. We see this all the time. Even with alliance applications, which is whenever there's an incumbent competitor, you'll see like products being launched, there's nothing that differentiates from product X to let's say Opensea. And for us we see them as like we call them copy pastas and they don't serve any market because they're essentially competing for the same customer. And you've kind of seen this not calling out any products but like Gem as an example that's building the aggregator from the OpenC team. It's very similar to blur. There isn't like a ten x differentiator that would enable someone to go from blur to gem.
00:55:55.946 - 00:56:10.286, Speaker A: And so your specific point on segmentation is actually very important for founders that are listening. The next point I want to touch on is there's a narrative behind you guys, which is two devs and a dream, right? Two devs.
00:56:10.478 - 00:56:20.222, Speaker C: Two devs, two cups of coffee or a truckload of coffee. 2 hours of sleep and a wild dream.
00:56:20.366 - 00:56:42.906, Speaker A: And I remember you and I chatted about this eight months ago. I'm like, do you guys want to raise now? And you said no. And you guys said, we want to continue validating our product and building out who our customers are going to be. One is why did you say no? And how were you so frugal in the way you spent money and why did you guys decide to stay lean?
00:56:43.098 - 00:57:50.466, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think the way we saw it was that there was really no point for us to raise money if we ourselves can't build a product that people love. Like hiring people isn't going to solve that. Like hiring, let's say two additional devs, maybe two additional BD people. That's not going to help us find product market fit because at the end of the day, really, the founders or the people early on, are the ones who can identify a product that people will want to use and identify the problem that they're solving that will end up eventually becoming a large, successful product. I think hiring can definitely take some things off your plate, but for us, we weren't afraid to grind. And at that point, we wanted to essentially build the company almost like the prototypical Silicon Valley garage, where both of us would just be in a room together for maybe like 14 hours a day, 15 hours a day, and just like hack away until we find something that lightning in a bottle. I think that comes a bit from like, we also were maybe a bit selfish in that we didn't want to dilute ourselves and just raise a ton of money for no reason before we found product market fit.
00:57:50.466 - 00:58:05.266, Speaker B: I think it's much easier to find product market fit, know that we have something here that we just need to put more resources into, whether it's dev bandwidth, whether it's BD bandwidth, and just go into growth mode once we find that initial lightning in the bottle.
00:58:05.378 - 00:59:10.934, Speaker C: I think what you said there about being frugal probably applies to 99% of startups, at least in crypto. The only exception I can think of is the layer ones, because they just need to spend a lot of money to acquire devs for them. The product market fit risk is very low because Ethereum works all the other layer ones, like Salana works, product market fit risk is low. The challenge is acquiring the devs and build a tech that's hopefully ten x better. But for everyone else, for all the other startups, this story, I just come across it over and over again, which is founders raising $10 million seed rounds and spend all day thinking about how to spend that money, how to hire people. And once they've hired a bunch of people, 30 people, they spend all day thinking about how to manage them, how to solve the interpersonal conflicts, creating layers of hierarchy within the organization, instead of focusing on the only thing that really matters, which is product market fit. And they do this pre product market fit, which is an incredible waste of money and time and effort.
00:59:10.934 - 00:59:22.586, Speaker C: I mean, it's perfectly fine to scale teams and raise a lot of money after that. After the moment, you think that you really have a product that people love, but before that, it's a complete distraction.
00:59:22.698 - 00:59:48.418, Speaker D: I think in crypto we're lucky that we can do that. Like you can build a startup in a garage if you're doing biotech or you're doing something with real hard science, you won't be able to do that. And that's when you really need to raise money before you can validate the idea. But in this industry, guys, what do you really need? You need to build a protocol in solidity. You need to set up a front end. It doesn't even need to be like real time. You don't need to have data pipelines.
00:59:48.418 - 01:00:03.574, Speaker D: You don't even need a back end. You can hack all of that together in a month alone. Right. And you can very quickly see if there's something there or not. And if there is something there, then, yeah, go ahead and hire. Of course, there's also slightly more difficult ideas. I know some of the guys doing kind of AI and crypto intersection.
01:00:03.574 - 01:00:17.778, Speaker D: I think that becomes more challenging because you might have to spend money on GPUs and even that, but even that you can bootstrap, which is getting credits and basically trying to get to something that just proves, at least somewhat proves your hunch that, yeah, there's something there. People want this.
01:00:17.864 - 01:00:50.134, Speaker A: I mean, I'll make a bold claim and say that I'd say 90 plus percent of founders that have raised capital in crypto have not found product market fit. And it's very unfortunate because I think the mental model for founders that are building in crypto, I'm just talking, speaking specifically around crypto, is that they raise on their credentials or the idea they want to pursue, and they'll pick a random number based on what competitors have raised at. And I get this question all the time. Well, my competitor raised at X, so here's what I'm going to raise. And you guys could have done that, too, but you guys didn't.
01:00:50.182 - 01:00:50.730, Speaker D: Right?
01:00:50.880 - 01:01:13.378, Speaker A: And the thought process I want to give founders are listening, is if you really want to validate your product, go out and talk to customers, come up with an MVP and validate it, because you could raise it at a far higher valuation if you were to validate the product and have some early use cases and then give you more ammunition to double down on the product and the team that you're scaling out.
01:01:13.464 - 01:01:59.758, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's also like framing what your perspective on when you're building the company for us. We know, I guess Elia and I both know that as much money as we raise through maybe like a seed round, a series A, a series B, a series C, so on and so forth, none of that matters unless we find product market fit. And money isn't going to help us. Even if we raise like a $10 million seed round, even if we hire 20 engineers. That's not going to help us find product market fit faster than if we just hack away together, the two of us, and then find a product that people like because we talk to these early users. I think the glam and the glitz of raising a large seed round is really attractive to a lot of people, and that boosts your ego. But at the end of the day, none of that matters.
01:01:59.758 - 01:02:02.274, Speaker B: It's all about just building a product that people like.
01:02:02.392 - 01:02:09.014, Speaker C: Any lessons you've learned from, I don't know, 50 plus rejections from VCs in this bear market?
01:02:09.212 - 01:02:56.898, Speaker D: I guess the big lesson for us, we sort of went into these meetings initially pretty unprepared, where we thought like, oh, just talk about our story and we'll talk about the beautiful vision that we had. We found that pretty quickly people would hang up on us, and that was because it was not crisp enough, it was not structured enough, it was not to the point enough. And I think for maybe some of the other founders that think that just because they're a founder, people are going to listen to them, the answer is no. You'll have to put in the time to structure your pitch. And just like when you're talking to customers, you talk to them in a certain way, or you're trying to sell your product, you do it in a certain way. You'll have to pitch VCs in a certain way. You have to understand what they're looking for and you have to give it to them fast, otherwise they switch off.
01:02:56.898 - 01:03:19.354, Speaker D: Outside of that, I would say we pretty quickly developed a hunch for what VCs were worth talking to and what were not. There's like a world of difference between somebody like Chris, who is our main lead, and a bunch of other guys that we spoke to. And that world of difference is visible in the first five minutes of the conversation. It's just the questions they ask. Chris never asked us for a financial model.
01:03:19.392 - 01:03:21.642, Speaker A: And we're talking about Chris Berninski from placeholder, right?
01:03:21.696 - 01:03:35.200, Speaker D: That's right, yeah. Chris from placeholder, exactly. He never asked us for a financial model. He never was like, but guys, what if you don't charge one and a half percent, but you charge 1.49? Is that going to ruin your business? These were the type of questions we were getting from people.
01:03:37.090 - 01:04:02.326, Speaker C: Whenever I see a founder ask me about financial, like their VCs, asking them about financial models, I just tell them, forget about this VC, not the right person to work with. My God, this financial model, that makes zero sense in this stage of the startup. So many assumptions go into it. Like, Richard, you know that it's coming from a quantitative finance background. I mean, those assumptions, you'll never get them right. So it's just a frugal.
01:04:02.438 - 01:04:11.914, Speaker B: It's almost like busy work. It does nothing to hedge the investors risk, and all it does is waste the founders time and I guess the investor's time.
01:04:11.952 - 01:04:12.410, Speaker D: That's right.
01:04:12.480 - 01:04:17.822, Speaker B: But it's like busy work, at least before seat stage or before product market fit.
01:04:17.956 - 01:04:52.806, Speaker D: Yeah, I think models start to make sense when you actually have repeatable revenue that you know is going to be there. Okay. Yeah. At that point, you can forecast it, you can do scenarios, you can think about it when it's two guys in pajamas in a room and they're like, hey, we have this idea. You got to understand that their idea is going to change 17 times over. And really, the bet you're making at that point is on the team. You're saying, like, are these two guys smart enough, convicted enough, have good intuition enough to keep trying, keep going and find something that works? And honestly, the vibes we got from speaking to Chris were exactly that.
01:04:52.806 - 01:05:27.122, Speaker D: He made the decision to take over half the round on the back of 230 minutes calls, one of them with him, and the other one was his team, and that was it. And the questions were about us, about the team, about the vision, like, how are we thinking about the market? And by the way, we had 1% market share that way. So it's not like he was buying a product that was successful. He was actually making a pretty controversial bet at the time, saying, one, Salana is going to be fine. Two, these two dudes are going to do something useful. And at the time, when everybody else told us there's no market, there's no nothing, where's the financial model? So, yeah, I guess for founders. Look, if your hunch is telling you that this VC is wasting your time, he's probably wasting your time.
01:05:27.122 - 01:05:45.894, Speaker D: And if you're only able to get calls with those types of VCs, then you're not ready to raise, and you need to go back and work on the product and on the customer and get it to the point where you're able to get on better calls. That's the point. And that's when you get on better calls and you convince those guys to invest. You no longer need the long tail of people who ask you for financial.
01:05:45.942 - 01:06:28.470, Speaker B: Models to add on to that. I think when we were raising at the bottom of the FTX collapse, a lot of investors told us to move to a different chain I would say even some of the better investors asked us what our plans were to move to Ethereum, to move to even Aptos, to move to suite. And I think they were a bit shell shocked from what happened to FTX, what happened to Solana, and we don't blame them because they're investors. They sort of see the macro landscape in a certain way. But I think as a founder, you should never be influenced by what an investor tells you. You should always make decisions based on what you and your co founders have intuition on. And obviously take into account everything that you've learned from your customers.
01:06:28.470 - 01:06:54.478, Speaker B: Because I think one thing that investors will never have, or maybe most investors will never have, is that deep and nuanced experience within the category that you're building it. I don't think any other person besides you will understand your market more than what you and your team are building. I think investors have a good macro view, but they don't necessarily have that nuanced experience to tell you, this is a good idea, this is a bad idea.
01:06:54.564 - 01:07:31.178, Speaker A: I mean, this goes back to you speaking to customers every day, right? Whereby investors aren't talking to those customers every day, and you're developing this intuition that no one else can develop. And for founders are listening. I'd say that when investors give you feedback or pushback, don't take it to heart. I get many founders that take it to heart and say, maybe we should pivot or maybe we should do something else. If you have strong conviction, you have the data that backs it up. That intuition, so to speak, continue to build in that area. And over time, luck and other things can play or talk about when that jar tips over in terms of product market fit.
01:07:31.264 - 01:08:13.098, Speaker D: That said, I will add that if you actually like your investor and you guys have a good relationship, definitely use them for feedback for things that you don't have access to. So for example, hey, what are people doing on another chain? Or like, who do you think in the ecosystem we should work with? Like, when we ask Krisky, who is pretty director, is like, guys, I really like the backpack team. You guys should get closer with the backpack team. And we really like the backpack team. And hearing that from Chris, it was very validating for us because we knew, okay, well, here's somebody who has been pattern matching startups for the last ten years of his career, or how many he's been doing it for. If he's telling it, it's a good product and a good company. We should probably really think about how we can work together on those guys.
01:08:13.098 - 01:08:19.098, Speaker D: So I think being smart about what does your investor know? You don't. And then pulling that information out of them.
01:08:19.184 - 01:08:55.954, Speaker C: I've been wanting to ask this question for half an hour now, but how do you feel about Solana now? Because when our founders, like you guys, go on and fundraise, I get a lot of questions from vcs back channeling and asking about the team and the market. The VCs that talked to me about you guys, I told them Richard and Ilya will be very rich in ten years. I think some of them believe me and a lot of them don't believe in Salana. And they say Salana is dead. And every time they say Salana is dead, I just shake my head. I just don't want to say anything. I'm done with this discussion.
01:08:55.954 - 01:09:03.642, Speaker C: But I want to hear from the source. How do you feel about Solana now? And how do you feel about Solana in maybe two to three years?
01:09:03.776 - 01:10:18.382, Speaker B: I think it all goes back to the idea of intuition, conviction and thinking from first principles. I think for us, despite all the fud about downtime, FTX, whatever you throw at us, I think there are examples that we're seeing right now, like evidence that we're seeing right now that validates some of our first principles, thinking about why Salana will succeed. So one of them is obviously like cheap and fast transactions amongst sort of the whole meme coin situation right now, where gas fees on Ethereum are like $150 and if you want to take out an NFT loan, or if you want to even list your NFT, it's going to cost you like fifty dollars to one hundred and fifty dollars in gas fees. That is more substantiating evidence that Salana will become a dominant player in NFTs in the long term. We don't think that Ethereum L1, which is the next biggest market for NFTs, will ever be a mass market product for NFTs. Not for a few years, but we think that Salana is that today. And if we want to onboard a million a billion users to crypto and eventually have them interacting with NFTs, then we think Solana is one of the most primed chain to achieve that because they are number two in, I guess, market share of NFT volume.
01:10:18.382 - 01:10:34.546, Speaker B: They do have a thriving developer community. They have great builders like backpack, even like Magikidan, our competitor. They're great builders and they decide to stay on Solana. So that just substantiates our confidence and our conviction in Solana becoming a great chain for at least NFTs.
01:10:34.658 - 01:11:20.420, Speaker D: Yeah. I think the other framing that helps here a lot is, and again, this is something we stole from Chris, but I just thought it was really astute. He basically said the world has different people in know some people, they prefer to think about rainbows and blue skies and positive things and this and that. Other people, they wake up and they think about efficiency, they want faster, they like to do low level programming, they just think about the world differently. And one group isn't better than the other, they're just different. And Ethereum, in its current state, caters to a certain type of person, somebody a bit more visionary, somebody who got into crypto earlier because of some of the promises of decentralization. And Ethereum, was that really first validating blockchain? They managed to achieve that.
01:11:20.420 - 01:12:03.758, Speaker D: All the kudos in the world to those guys. But actually, there's a lot of people in the world that care about that far less than they care about a good user experience. And we would put ourselves into that camp where we are Ux maxis and the UX that you can build on Solana, because of its programming model, because of its development environment, is just way, way better. And so again, it's not better or worse. It's just that some guys, they choose to take up a career in HFT, and then when they get tired of that, they decide, well, what's the fastest blockchain can work on? And they end up on Solana. And Solana has like a ton of those people. And I think respecting and understanding that different people have different preferences and there's going to be different chains that cater to those people is how you should be thinking about these blockchains.
01:12:03.934 - 01:12:46.866, Speaker C: My bullish argument for Solana has always been exactly what you said, which is that Solana makes very meaningful trade offs from Ethereum. And those trade offs are basically, number one, you sacrifice a little bit of decentralization for much, much cheaper fees. And two, you have this one global layer, execution and consensus layer without too many layers above, which is the case in Ethereum, which hurts user experience when it comes to bridging, and it hurts the just makes things feel very complex. You have a lot of layers. You have decentralized sequencers, you have, oh my God. It's just really painful for me to think about. But Salala is just one thing.
01:12:46.866 - 01:13:06.534, Speaker C: It's just one layer where everything executes and they're composable with each other. So meaningful trade offs from Ethereum, and obviously I'm an ethereum bull, but I think Solana comparatively is still the most undervalued, the most contrarian bet on the layer one right now.
01:13:06.652 - 01:13:53.846, Speaker A: I also think there's some upcoming problems for Ethereum that they need to start addressing, which is the canonical NFTs that are on Ethereum are on Ethereum, right? Like if you look at crypto punks, autoglyphs and all the other NFTs, and it's increasingly becoming more and more expensive to transact on those platforms, right? So you're going to see less and less people, and we're talking retail that are going to be using those, are going to use Ethereum versus something like a Solana that has NFTs that are at a very low cost. So from a user acquisition perspective, with the fragmented market on all of Ethereum compared to like a singular marketplace on Solana, I feel as if Solana is primed for acquiring all the new retail customers that are coming into the space moving forward.
01:13:53.948 - 01:14:09.414, Speaker C: And we're seeing that from all the proof of physical work projects moving to Solana because their target users are the non crypto natives, the mainstream, who care a lot about fees and so know Hivemaper, render protocol, they're all moving to Solana.
01:14:09.542 - 01:14:43.574, Speaker A: So I know we're probably close to time here, but maybe to end off, how did you feel when you achieved product market fit? And what I meant by how did you feel like, how did you know you had product market fit and how do you feel about your positioning today? I just saw a tweet earlier today that you guys had hit cumulative 3 million Sol, which is close to $60 million in trading volume. Congrats. So maybe to cap this conversation is how did you know when you found product market fit and how do you feel about your position today and where do you think this goes in the future?
01:14:43.772 - 01:15:51.910, Speaker B: Yeah, I think for me, my perspective on when we've hit product market fit was when we stopped really trying to think about user acquisition. And we focused way more on making the product more robust, adding features that users have essentially demanded for three, four weeks now. And we just can't keep up with the amount of inbound we're getting from users asking for new features, asking for maybe a better way to trade NFTs, whether it's on margin with lending, some mix of that. I think right now our user acquisition is entirely organic. We've spent like $0 in marketing. We've essentially done maybe two and a half spaces through the lifetime of the company, and we still have users coming in the door every single day, which is pretty cool to see, and I think that's when, you know, you've hit product market fit is when you stop having to think about continuously acquiring users. Of course, once you get into growth mode and you just want to see up into the right metrics, then, yes, maybe you need to spend money on some sort of marketing, some sort of user acquisition.
01:15:51.910 - 01:16:00.954, Speaker B: But for us, we're sort of, right now, trying to improve the product, increase stickiness so that we don't have a leaky bucket before we move on to full on growth mode.
01:16:01.082 - 01:16:51.994, Speaker D: I will also add that a part of me still doesn't think we're a product market fit. It's really nice to see users coming into the door, but there's two variables that are really important. One is still market size, and two is that the landscape in crypto shifts so fast that you could be at product market fit today and no market fit tomorrow. And you have to be very conscious of that. We're super paranoid. In fact, I'm more scared now than I was when we were starting this, because now we actually almost have something on the plate. And I don't think for us, that the battle is anywhere near the end, if anything, is getting started, because some of the more aggressive competitors have woken up to the fact that there's other players that are doing interesting things, and now they want to eliminate them from the place, from planet Earth.
01:16:51.994 - 01:17:25.386, Speaker D: So we're very conscious of that. And so, yeah, we're going to be thinking very seriously about how do we bring new users to Solana? How do we ten x the market size? How do we become leaders in new categories that are emerging, that are not yet present? The one thing that is a truism is competition is for losers. You never want to be competing with somebody, but the only way you do that is by basically opening new markets and entering those markets as the first player and winning them entirely. And so, I guess, yeah, that's what's going through our heads right now. I don't think we're a product market fit. I think we're lucky to have users and we still have a lot of work to do.
01:17:25.488 - 01:17:29.146, Speaker A: I think that's the right mental model. Chow, any final questions?
01:17:29.328 - 01:17:32.940, Speaker C: No, I think you've covered everything I wanted to.
01:17:34.750 - 01:17:47.538, Speaker A: Team tensor. Tensor is near and dear to Alliance's heart because you were part of alliance batch number nine, and we're seeing great things that are coming out of you guys. So we're rooting for your success on the sidelines here.
01:17:47.624 - 01:18:09.580, Speaker B: Appreciate it. I mean, it goes without saying that you guys have alliance and the entire community actually has been a blessing for us. You guys have helped us personally have helped us in so many ways, and we've just had so much help from other alliance members. It's kind of crazy to imagine that we were accepted into the program to be a myth with our oracle idea.
01:18:10.830 - 01:18:16.250, Speaker A: All right, well, thanks for hopping on, and thanks for listening. Hit subscribe if you haven't. Thanks so much for your time.
01:18:16.320 - 01:18:16.986, Speaker C: Thanks, guys.
01:18:17.088 - 01:18:18.060, Speaker B: Thanks, guys.
01:18:22.830 - 01:18:33.598, Speaker A: So much to learn that I've learned, and also for people that are listening. But maybe we could do a quick recap, maybe chow if you want to start. And then you could talk about a few things that I've learned as well.
01:18:33.684 - 01:19:07.786, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, there's a few lessons that I keep on repeating to our founders. The first one is stay frugal. Don't raise a ton of money if you don't need it, because money is actually a distraction. It's at best a distraction, and many times it puts you at a disadvantage compared to your competitors like Tensor, who are much more frugal. A lot of problems in crypto are not problems you can solve by throwing more money at it or throwing more developers at it. Two deaths plus a truckload of coffee is more than enough. So that's one thing.
01:19:07.786 - 01:19:49.946, Speaker C: The second thing is, best ideas come from your hunch rather than from quantitative surveys or metrics or even talking to customers. The point of talking to customers is really to build your hunch. So your hunch ultimately trumps many other things when it comes to your initial idea. Do things that don't scale. For example, identifying the salana pro trader or the salana NFT whales and matching them to their Twitter, and then dming every single one of them. And then bring the 5% of them that responded into your telegram and kept on chatting with them, pushing them to give you feedback, and so on and so forth. Did I miss anything important?
01:19:50.128 - 01:20:17.170, Speaker A: No. I think, yeah, I mean, like a couple of things that I'll also highlight. One is the importance of establishing customer feedback loop, as you mentioned, a bit about emailing or dming the 50 individuals. Also creating this group where you're able to facilitate feedback, support, and just understanding more of how you build that intuition, I think is going to be very important. And it's also about brute force work.
01:20:17.240 - 01:20:17.714, Speaker B: Right?
01:20:17.832 - 01:20:45.322, Speaker A: Like picking up the phone, calling someone, dming someone cold dming someone cold, emailing someone. Sometimes you have to do the hard work up front to bear the fruits in the future. And oftentimes I see founders fall into this like well, we don't have enough customers. I'm like, have you dmed your customers? Have you emailed your customers? What have you done to get customers into your pipeline? Nothing. Well, a Twitter post isn't going to do it. You have to go out and get those customers. It's really important to do that.
01:20:45.322 - 01:20:53.734, Speaker A: Otherwise your competitors are going to DM those customers and get them into a group chat and start to talk to them before you do so. Time is of the essence.
01:20:53.862 - 01:21:41.706, Speaker C: Speaking of customer acquisition, if you have a co star problem, like in the case of a marketplace, of course you need to do those things to acquire your customers. But if you don't have a costar problem, I've said this to our founders all the time, customer acquisition is the easiest thing. It's probably not something you even need to focus on initially. If you have a couple of customers, two to five customers, and you can make them really happy and your retention is really high and your net promoter score is really high, that is far more important than the efforts that are going into customer acquisition itself, because if you make these five people really happy, they're going to acquire customers for you. Organic, the word spread very quickly in this space. Everyone is on Twitter, everyone is in discord, everyone knows each other. All your customers know each other.
01:21:41.808 - 01:21:42.074, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:21:42.112 - 01:22:29.180, Speaker A: And another point that I love making is competitions for losers. Obviously, this is like a quote from Theo, Peter Theo. But when you're building a product, think about what you could offer that's highly differentiated, that can serve a particular group of customers similar to what tensor did. Magic Eden had 90% market share. There's hate swap and all these other competitors, but the way they thought about building tensor was like, well, what if we put in data, make it easier, faster to use our product? Maybe there's something there. And they went with that hunch and ultimately established a beachhead that led to where they are now. And so I do think instead of thinking about copying or doing what your competitors are doing, try to come in with a very different mindset that allows you to serve a particular user group.
01:22:29.180 - 01:22:48.014, Speaker A: All right, well, I think that's it. From my mean, it was incredible talking with the tensor team. And for founders that are building a space, please use this content as a way for you to think about your product, getting to product market fit and then hopefully getting your 1st 100,000 customers. Thanks so much for listening. We'll chat with you guys soon.
01:22:48.212 - 01:22:49.386, Speaker D: Thanks, Alex.
01:22:49.578 - 01:22:53.920, Speaker A: Thanks for listening to good game. Don't forget to subscribe. We'll see you next week.
