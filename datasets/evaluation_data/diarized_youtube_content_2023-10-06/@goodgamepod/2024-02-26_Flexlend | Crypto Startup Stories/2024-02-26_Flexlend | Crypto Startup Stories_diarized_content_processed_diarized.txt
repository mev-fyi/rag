00:00:00.200 - 00:00:18.718, Speaker A: Thanks for listening to Goodgame. We wanted to take a quick moment for a short new segment, crypto startup stories, where we spotlight founders who went through the alliance accelerator. Today we're focusing on startups shaping the Solana ecosystem, like Jupiter and tensor. So without further ado, let's hear from Daniel Garay, the founder of Flexland.
00:00:18.806 - 00:00:20.198, Speaker B: Daniel, what are you building?
00:00:20.326 - 00:00:34.922, Speaker C: We're building Flexland. It's a tool to make defi much easier and less time consuming for people. Essentially, we've aggregated all the lending apps on Solana and allow you to lend from one place. We're going to move your funds around so that you're always earning as much as you can.
00:00:35.018 - 00:00:37.946, Speaker B: Great. How did you come up with the idea?
00:00:38.050 - 00:00:58.048, Speaker C: User feedback. So we had originally started building a different product called Lulo. That one didn't go as great as we wanted, but it did generate a lot of feedback and a lot of touch points with people. And slowly we collected a lot of feedback. We saw a lot of patterns, and that's how flexible was born. It's essentially a product built 100% based off user feedback.
00:00:58.176 - 00:01:01.936, Speaker B: Did you reach out to the customers to get feedback? What was the process like?
00:01:02.040 - 00:01:28.642, Speaker C: So early on? We used the communities my co founder and I were part of. So, you know, I would reach out to every community. I was part of an NFT group, a trading group, defi group, and try to get two or three people from each group to try out the product and become early users. And that's kind of how we got our first, like, 50 people to try it out. And from there, you kind of see what groups they're part of and trying to go deeper into those groups, and that's kind of how we did it. Spider web style.
00:01:28.778 - 00:01:32.522, Speaker B: What's one piece of advice that you give to founders that are building this space?
00:01:32.658 - 00:02:15.384, Speaker C: Yeah, I'd say don't forget to live it sounds a little like cliche, but I think I see personally as a founder, like, a lot of hustle content that's maybe targeted to me, and I don't really agree with it. I think it's important to take care of your body, it's important to take care of your mind, it's important to have hobbies, it's important to develop yourself as a person, because you know you're going to be working on this for five years or more. So regardless if it succeeds or if it fails, if you're not enjoying the time, if you don't come out of it as a better person holistically, then I think it's a losing proposition. So I don't really think sitting at the computer 16 hours a day is the way to go about it. I think you need to carve out time for other activities and other things and to take care of yourself.
00:02:15.544 - 00:02:48.730, Speaker B: In terms of Flexland, how is the momentum going? You got the feedback with Lulu and then you built an aggregator. You talked to customers, you did the spiderweb effect of getting users to give you feedback. You use that feedback as a way to enhance your product, which is flux lend. Now you're an aggregator and you're aggregating lending across all of Solana Defi and I guess how has the usage been? And maybe if you could describe in one or two sentences of the value proposition of Flexland and why people should use it.
00:02:48.842 - 00:03:20.586, Speaker C: You know, I used to think user feedback was a part of early stage startups. I now think it is the only thing that matters because at the beginning you should be just optimizing for generating feedback as much as you can. And once you build something people actually want, which is based on feedback, growth is not easy, but it's much easier. So Flexone has definitely grown a lot faster than Lulu has. We get a lot more positive feedback. We get a lot more like organic usage and people like really feeling like they're solving an issue when they use it. So that's really exciting to see.
00:03:20.586 - 00:03:47.694, Speaker C: I think the growth confirms you don't actually know what you should build just based on instinct. You really have to listen to people. It's the only way to do it right. So I think from here it's, you know, there's more product market fit. So now the user feedback also becomes more focused on the product and like how to make it better, rather than like being very sporadic, which is kind of how it feels. When you don't have product market fit, the feedback is from all over the place. And so the quality of feedback also changes as you get closer to something people want.
00:03:48.074 - 00:03:50.054, Speaker B: And why should people use flex lend today?
00:03:50.874 - 00:04:02.098, Speaker C: If you don't want to spend hours a day optimizing your lending, and you want to earn really, really good rates on USDC specifically and stablecoins, then flex lend is definitely the product for you.
00:04:02.186 - 00:04:04.202, Speaker B: Great. Daniel, thank you so much for your time.
00:04:04.298 - 00:04:05.274, Speaker C: Yeah, thank you. Imran.
