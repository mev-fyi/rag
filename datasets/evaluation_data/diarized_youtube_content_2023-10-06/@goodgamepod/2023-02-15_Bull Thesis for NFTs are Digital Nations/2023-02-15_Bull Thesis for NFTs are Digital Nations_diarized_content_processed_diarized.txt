00:00:00.200 - 00:00:39.314, Speaker A: People are all bounded by a single identity. Like single meta identity, right? Like I am bounded by where my family is from in India, right? And so when I go back there, everyone talks the same, they eat the same, etcetera. Now, you have this on the Internet, and the identity that's governing this new group of people is under the ethos of, like, the bored apes or the cryptopunks, and they all have different ways to communicate and talk and different rights, whatever. But it's interesting to see some of these properties develop on the Internet.
