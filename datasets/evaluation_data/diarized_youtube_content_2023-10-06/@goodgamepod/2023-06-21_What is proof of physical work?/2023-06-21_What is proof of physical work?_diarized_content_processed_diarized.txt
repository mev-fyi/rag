00:00:00.200 - 00:00:17.086, Speaker B: I think proof of physical work is pretty much doing verifiable work off chain, recording it on chain, and then getting paid in tokens for that. It could be in the form of data. You can contribute in the form of data, which is the most popular way. There are other forms that are coming into light, but I'd say data input is the most important right now.
00:00:17.150 - 00:00:45.444, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, for me, the definition is pretty much the same. The only thing I would add is, what inspired all of this? I think what inspired all of this was really the OG crypto, which is bitcoin. In bitcoin, we do pretty proof of work, and the work that the miners much do is solve a computationally very difficult math problem that is easy to verify. That's one and two. They process the transactions, they order the transactions and process them, and in return, they earn the bitcoin token. So that's the work that they do and the reward that they get.
00:00:45.444 - 00:00:59.484, Speaker A: Now, the natural next question is, what is some other work that you can do in the physical world, in the real world, that as a contributor of the work, you can earn tokens for? And this is what led to the idea of helium, hivemapper, and so on and so forth.
