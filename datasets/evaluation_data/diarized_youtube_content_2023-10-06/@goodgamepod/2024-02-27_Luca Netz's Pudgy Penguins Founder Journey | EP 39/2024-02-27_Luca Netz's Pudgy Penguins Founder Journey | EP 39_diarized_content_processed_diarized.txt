00:00:00.320 - 00:00:04.140, Speaker A: Welcome to GoodGame. Your no BS insights for crypto founders.
00:00:07.280 - 00:00:28.210, Speaker B: I think for us we're interested in winning the current battle that we're in today. The current battle that we're in today is, you know, I want Pudgy Penguins to be the face of NFTs and the face of Web3. And to do that we have to have the highest floor price. That's just the nature of what it means to be that, to be the leader of the space. And so that's my focus above all.
00:00:28.250 - 00:01:04.224, Speaker A: Else, looking for your next startup idea in crypto. Check out our request for startups list and get inspired at Alliance XYZ Forward slash ideas. Welcome to Good Game. We have Luca Netz, the founder of Pudgy Penguins, joining us to discuss his journey as a founder, how he sees the Pudgy Penguins ip, what he thinks about marketplaces, different collections, defi or specifically nft Fi and the future of Pudgy. So there's a lot to unpack, but yeah, those are some of the topics that I'm most interested in. How about you?
00:01:04.312 - 00:01:22.166, Speaker C: I'm very curious about the Walmart stuff that just came out last week. Obviously this is not the first time they announced something with Walmart. The first time was like a few months ago, end of last year. I'm curious what happened? Why did they want to do that?
00:01:22.318 - 00:01:26.726, Speaker A: It's a big deal. Especially doing season two. That shows that there's product market fit.
00:01:26.838 - 00:01:45.704, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. And every time they do this, they get a lot of mind share. Like I think this whole exercise is about mind share. Right. It's not. I don't think they make a lot of money from selling the toys, but like having Walmart tweeting about you in front of everyone, that's a big deal.
00:01:45.792 - 00:02:08.664, Speaker A: I also think it's marketing. So in marketing, I took a marketing class a long time ago and I remember one thing, the class, and that is you got to have 8 to 10 touches in front of a user before the user actually recognizes the brand. Right. And you could see this in the form of advertisement. You'll see this in the form of like billboard signs, et cetera. Right. Just all over the place.
00:02:08.664 - 00:02:50.872, Speaker A: And so for Pudgy, really it's, it's interesting. They are taking the marketing first approach, which is something that no other NFT project is doing or was doing until now. If you look at their Instagram following, they have over 1 million followers. If you look at, there's an incredible lineup of stickers for Pudgy Penguins that's on like WhatsApp and Telegram that goes viral. You have funny GIFs. And I've told the story last time to our audience, but when I landed in Malaysia, the first welcome GIF I got from my friends was a Pudgy Penguins gif. And so all of this is just a viral effect that is touching you as a user.
00:02:50.872 - 00:03:09.206, Speaker A: And over time it just becomes a recognized brand. And when that happens, then you could launch a movie, you could launch a game, do these things. And it just. People know they're acclimated with the brand like Mario Brothers did a billion in the first week of box office, because everyone knew the brand. Right.
00:03:09.358 - 00:03:46.096, Speaker C: I don't know if it's because I live in my own Pudgy Penguin bubble, because I follow all the pudgies, pudgy analysts on Twitter, but I don't see other collections do this. I don't see other collections trying to create like, do these partnerships with Walmart, with like the Malaysian airport, et cetera, to expand their mind, share, at least not as much as, as pudgies. And certainly punks don't do any, any of this, right? I don't. Punks doesn't do anything. It's just being an OG and, and being the, the digital, the. The bitcoin of, of NFTs. Am I red or am I just living in my own bubble?
00:03:46.208 - 00:04:20.520, Speaker A: You're right. Well, now Azuki is following the same steps as Pudgy Penguin. So Zaga Bond tweets about this often, but he talks about his Instagram following and the views and likes TikTok, et cetera. So I do think he's taking a page out of Luca's book, which is, hey, if I want this brand to be acclimated with the everyday person, we need to use frictionless ways to attract those types of communities. And I think that's like, I think they're taking a lesson, following Luca's footsteps.
00:04:20.680 - 00:04:31.994, Speaker C: So do you know much about the history of pudgies, how you got started and then, you know, at some point got a lot of FUD and then got acquired by Luca. Are you familiar with that, with that history?
00:04:32.082 - 00:04:55.064, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I kind of got. Went through it because I ended up buying during that period. So I followed the fud. And so from high level, what happened was Cole was the original, like founder, creator of Penguins, but he had a pretty bad rep or a bad history. And so when they launched, after some time, people started tracing his addresses.
00:04:55.192 - 00:04:58.424, Speaker C: And this was 2021, 2022.
00:04:58.592 - 00:05:09.480, Speaker A: Yeah, it was around, it was around that time. I just can't remember but it was 2022. It was dark times because everything was down only no matter what.
00:05:09.520 - 00:05:10.968, Speaker C: Okay, so it's early 2022.
00:05:11.024 - 00:05:44.348, Speaker A: Yeah, it was just down only. So the community went live. People started dumping their penguins and it was almost like a repulsive like effect from the people that were holding the NFT and they didn't want him as the leader of the brand. So he definitely got it and stepped back and he received a bunch of offers and he took Lucas offer at $2.5 million. And then the, I remember the floor just bounced around 0.60 to back.
00:05:44.348 - 00:06:05.500, Speaker A: I think it was over 0.8. Then it went up to. But that was the high level of it. So he came in and he bought it for $2.5 million. And you know, I think that the notion is to build an Internet based community brand for Pudgy penguins. And that's kind of like the high level history of, of how Luca took over Pudgy.
00:06:05.500 - 00:06:13.098, Speaker A: To be quite frank, I'm going to say this. It's probably, probably will be one of the best acquisitions of all time.
00:06:13.234 - 00:06:21.594, Speaker C: How much do you feel Pudgies is worth today? The IP? It's at least 100x from that. It's 100x at least, at least today.
00:06:21.762 - 00:06:41.582, Speaker A: I feel the same because the thing about Pudgies is that it appeals to everyone. Every category of age. Like you share it with a 70 year old or if you share it with a 5 year old, it's pleasant to the eyes and they're cute. Right. And so it brings in like human soft emotions which gives you more like affinity to the, to the brand.
00:06:41.686 - 00:07:15.268, Speaker C: When Pudgies first came out, I actually tweeted about this. I said Pudgies was the first NFT collection that ever appealed to me aesthetically. Every single other collection up to that point in time was just appalled me and, but, but, and that's still the case that like two years later, still the case today. Like Pudgies is still the only collection that I like from an art point of view. I hold a bunch of other NFTs, but they, I hold them purely, I mean it purely for the money. Whereas Pudgies, I meant it for the money and the art.
00:07:15.404 - 00:08:00.930, Speaker A: The way I see the NFTs is primarily like the design of the NFT will predicate what types of people you're going to attract to the community like bored apes. I mean you could tell like not everyone will like it. There's this like tier of users that will, that will enjoy something like that like more older, maybe wealthier, et cetera. And that's a very small segment of the entire user base that there is. Like pudgy Penguins serves an entire town that's open, whereas monkeys are, I'd say, a sliver of that. That's why I like mokes, because it has a similar general appeal of cats and it's cute. So I do think the art, when you design.
00:08:00.930 - 00:08:13.074, Speaker A: When you design the art, you have to design it in a way that you know the types of customers you're tap into. Even Azuki's like, Azuki is like an anime community. And so people that love anime will tap into that market.
00:08:13.162 - 00:08:15.250, Speaker C: Azuki is very Asian.
00:08:15.410 - 00:08:25.080, Speaker A: Yeah. Asian manga anime lovers. I mean, there's a huge anime community in the States too, so. And I think that's the idea with where he wants to go with.
00:08:25.200 - 00:08:50.818, Speaker C: I feel like I just have an unfair advantage in NFTs and meme coin, which is that in those things, I'm such a normie and whatever I like just ends up being liked by other normies. Like ends up being liked by a fairly large number of people. So the only two things I've ever liked, one is Pakistan, one is with. And both are doing pretty well.
00:08:50.954 - 00:09:14.458, Speaker A: Well, it's just general appeal. Right. The more people can understand it or will have some sort of affinity to it. Yeah. So I think NFT communities, I'm just really curious what's going. Like, what's the end game? Is the end game you create. You're bootstrapping this community and you're building out IP so you can get the IP in front of everyone.
00:09:14.458 - 00:10:00.190, Speaker A: You're doing Twitter, all the social media, get in front of enough people, then once people have an affinity to their brand, then you what, build out a cartoon, a movie, a game? What's next? Is it to be the next Disney and have your own theme parks around this character? I think that's where it's going. What we're seeing here is the early foundation of what Disney is going to look like, which is why I call Luca's acquisition as one of the best acquisitions of all time. If he does it right. If he does it right, I think that is what it could look like. But obviously I'm like, mega bull posting here. But it's all about execution at the end of the day. But that, in theory is where I think NFTs can go.
00:10:00.190 - 00:10:22.392, Speaker A: And NFT communities can get a cut of all of what's happening. Like shareholders and maybe like getting a first access pass to movies without paying for it getting theme park. People pay tens of thousands of dollars to go to a theme park a year. Free access to theme parks. Sure. Like if these are all like benefits I get in perpetuity, I'd love to hold one.
00:10:22.416 - 00:10:38.618, Speaker C: Anyways, I do feel there is a very fundamental difference between NFTs and Disney, which is that Disney's enterprise value comes from the revenue that they generate from Disneyland, et cetera. They actually make a lot of money from selling the product, selling the theme park, et cetera.
00:10:38.704 - 00:10:39.062, Speaker A: That's right.
00:10:39.086 - 00:11:15.764, Speaker C: Whereas with NFTs you may not need to do that. And all you need to do, which is very crypto native, which is to create Mindshare. And with more Mindshare comes with higher price, higher floor price for the NFT collection. And I think that's exactly what Padgis have have done so far. They are making some revenue from selling the toys on Walmart or building the pudgy world. Everything they're doing there really is to create, is to boost mindshare rather than generating revenue. And the mindshare ultimately leads to higher and higher and higher floor price.
00:11:15.932 - 00:11:22.660, Speaker A: So Mindshare, that's an interesting point you bring up, which is okay, without NFTs, how do you compete with someone like Disney?
00:11:22.740 - 00:11:27.108, Speaker C: I mean, NFT sounds like, feels like the first way to do that.
00:11:27.244 - 00:12:07.094, Speaker A: That's what my gut tells me, because you have it committed army of holders, bag holders, tribal holders, religion that will do whatever it takes to make sure this brand becomes like an armor for their growth. Right. You could at least guarantee that there will be, you know, if you were to sell a product, 7,000 people or 6,000 people that would buy the product. Right. So you, you bought your users, your users bought into you. There's a dual investment that happens here and I think that's very powerful and that is something that Disney doesn't have. I'm also curious about what he thinks about Yuga Labs.
00:12:07.094 - 00:12:19.222, Speaker A: And Yuga Labs is like, I feel as if they haven't found product market fit just yet. They're trying a bunch of experiments. You see them like launching mini games where people mint NFTs. They're launching a bunch of collections across the board.
00:12:19.326 - 00:12:27.620, Speaker C: What do you think of some of the controversy recently about Yuga Labs? There was a lot of FUD about the acquisition of.
00:12:28.080 - 00:12:29.880, Speaker A: Yeah. Of Yuga Labs and Moonbirds.
00:12:29.960 - 00:12:31.656, Speaker C: Moonbirds, yeah, yeah.
00:12:31.768 - 00:12:49.454, Speaker A: And the idea is very simple. Kevin Rose founded Moonbirds, didn't give enough support to that ecosystem. That ecosystem kind of went down. Zero. And the community was very upset. Right. To the point where I think Kevin Rose just kind of signed off Twitter, stopped using Twitter.
00:12:49.454 - 00:13:24.906, Speaker A: Yuga Labs ended up acquiring them. And so obviously it's great for moonbirds, but it's also diluting the attention and resources of Yuga Labs, because now I've read many threads on how they're criticizing Yuga Labs, the board, ape holders, but specifically what they're saying is, like, you are giving all of the attention to all of these new collections, but what about us? What about the community that helped you start this entire revolution? What are you gonna do for us? And I feel like over the past two years, Yuga Labs has ignored their community. And some tweets said that they were very extractive. Right?
00:13:24.978 - 00:13:48.172, Speaker C: Yeah. So some other people say the acquisition dilutes the brand value of their existing collections, whereas pudgies is the total opposite end of the spectrum, which is the only focus on pudgies. There are some twists that spoke very highly about pudgies at the expense of the Moonbird acquisition.
00:13:48.316 - 00:14:03.676, Speaker A: What I like about Pudgies is the fact that so far, the one collection that they dropped two, but the one that I'll talk about is Little Pudgies, which was just a free mint for pudgy holders. Right. Feel like that's how you reward a community. Don't charge them.
00:14:03.748 - 00:14:05.788, Speaker C: Did any other collections do this?
00:14:05.924 - 00:14:13.920, Speaker A: No. I mean, I'm sure many have done this, but the ones that I know about Azuki Yuga Labs, they all charged like.
00:14:13.960 - 00:14:14.416, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:14:14.528 - 00:14:17.552, Speaker A: And it was very annoying. It was very annoying.
00:14:17.616 - 00:14:22.416, Speaker C: And it dilutes the existing collection.
00:14:22.528 - 00:14:36.552, Speaker A: Who wins here? Right. And what I like about Luca is the fact that he's community first. Right. He understands the community and goes with that. You die for your community. Community will die for you. Your community is what holds the brand up.
00:14:36.552 - 00:14:42.952, Speaker A: Your brand gives you an edge against competitors and helps you bring it out to the market, things like that.
00:14:43.056 - 00:15:04.440, Speaker C: Yeah. I mean, I don't know if this for a fact, but I do see a lot of holders of yoga labs collections see yoga labs. Yoga labs as value extractive. And I never see any Pudgy holders say the same thing about pudgies. I don't know if it's because number go up for pudgies. I don't know if that's. That's the reason, but that's what I've observed so far.
00:15:04.480 - 00:15:15.032, Speaker A: They haven't done anything. They haven't done anything to be extractive. And maybe just because he's only older for 14 months, but I haven't seen it. So I Like it.
00:15:15.136 - 00:15:15.656, Speaker C: Cool.
00:15:15.768 - 00:16:04.048, Speaker A: All right, let's bring Luca in. Welcome to Good Game. Today we have our guest, Luca Nuts, the founder of Pudgy Penguins. There's a lot to talk about, which is, you know, how did the acquisition process went down, why did he acquire it, what are his future plans? How did he build a community in the bear market? Because that's like key question for a lot of our founders. And what's the future? Right. Where do we think NFTs go? We're seeing a lot of discussions around, let's say the Bored Apes community or the Yuga Labs community, as far as turning the IP into games, mini games, turning into maybe in real life destinations. So just really kind of boiling down to what, where is this IP going and how is this going to be monetized? And more importantly, what does the community get out of it? So that's the high level of what I think.
00:16:04.048 - 00:16:04.928, Speaker A: How about you, Chow?
00:16:05.024 - 00:16:43.856, Speaker C: I'm just really curious how big NFT brands get started? How is the community bootstrapped and how does it go from zero to one and then from one to infinity? It's just really interesting. It's very different from other crypto projects. In other crypto projects, you build a software and then you distribute it, you get the customers, et cetera. But for NFT Collection, a brand, a community, that's really fascinating. I'd love to learn from you, Luca, on how that got started and also more recently the Walmart stuff, how you think about distributing toys and also Pudgy World, which is a game on top of Pudgy Penguins.
00:16:44.048 - 00:16:53.240, Speaker B: Well, first and foremost, happy to be here. Thanks for having me on. There's a lot of questions there. I'll maybe let you guys, let me know where you want to start.
00:16:53.360 - 00:17:11.544, Speaker A: I think let's start with the acquisition. I'll be quite frank. I did buy the NFTs around the acquisition time, but I didn't think it was going to get as big as it did today. And I'm curious if you thought the same when you initially made the acquisition, was this your vision or how did you think about the acquisition?
00:17:11.592 - 00:17:20.304, Speaker C: Just generally and also maybe just tell the story, tell us the story. For those who don't know about the acquisition, tell the story. When that happened, what happened?
00:17:20.472 - 00:18:00.808, Speaker B: Well, we definitely bought this with the intent to be the best. Where I was in my career, where some of our partners were in their careers, you know, we sacrificed, I think, huge opportunities. Our president was going to raise a really huge seed round around his software company. You know, I was CMO of Gel Blaster. And, you know, at the time we were doing, you know, $100 million a year in revenue. And I still had a lot of options to vest and had huge incentives because I was such a big shareholder in the company. And so there was really no reason to kind of pivot outside of what we were already doing, outside of our belief that the NFT space was ultimately going to be the future.
00:18:00.808 - 00:18:38.508, Speaker B: And we believe that because, you know, just like I own the T shirt on my back, I should own the assets that I purchased digitally. And the way the technological revolution is kind of going is it's going into a place where people are only going to live more and more in this digital digitized universe. And being able to own those assets digitally, I think is a basic human right. And typically businesses that disrupt or kind of embody what I refer to as basic human rights usually have humongous upsides. Right. Like the basic human right to socialize and interact. What was that? Social media.
00:18:38.508 - 00:19:03.192, Speaker B: Right. The basic human right to transact freely. What was that? Crypto right. The basic human rights to communicate, you know, cell phones. There's a lot of categories that I think have emerged over the last 20 years around this notion of basic human rights. And it's something that I think psychologically we always kind of migrate towards. And so I think the opportunity in the NFT space is humongous.
00:19:03.192 - 00:20:04.332, Speaker B: I think it's one of the most important technological innovations from a blockchain standpoint. And I think closing my eyes and envisioning what society is going to look like 20 years from now, NFTs, I think are going to play a huge part of it. So. So, you know, understanding where NFTs are going, you know, the TAM, you know, the fact that we're buying something for two and a half million dollars, which I think is no small amount of money, we're definitely don't have the luxury to think to ourselves that two and a half million dollars is not a small amount of money. We definitely built this and bought this business under the precedent that we were going to be the best. And why I believed we had a good shot at doing it is because of how low I felt the bar was up until that point. And so what had people really accomplished prior to, I think, you may know, maybe the last six to 12 months, because I think the NFT space has taken a turn for the better in terms of habits of founders and habits of companies and actual deliverables and execution.
00:20:04.332 - 00:21:21.142, Speaker B: You know, when we purchase the product or the project, the Bar for brand building and the bar for what it meant to build an ip, I thought was incredibly low. And I was a little bit frustrated from a collector standpoint that everybody had made so much money from venture and community off of a precedent of they were building a brand and a cultural icon, yet they weren't really doing what I felt like a brand or a cultural icon would do on a daily basis. And so, you know, obvious physical product strategy, content distribution strategies, just basic things that I think are natural to me being a brand builder for the last seven, eight years. And so that was the impetus for, hey, we're going to buy an NFT project. And Pudgy, for those who are familiar, was a collection that I think built a community and a culture that was perfectly primed for somebody to come in and kind of, you know, expedite that process. Just to be clear, I always believed, as a really big pudgy holder from pretty much day one, that Pudgy Penguins and its destiny was preordained. I think it would have succeeded with or without us.
00:21:21.142 - 00:22:04.496, Speaker B: What I believe we're doing is we're accelerating that process and adding fuel to the fire that I think already existed long before we came into this. And so, you know, Pudgy Penguins, from a. From a holistic point of view, what are the ingredients that I think make it so great? You know, it's the most universal IP in the space, the most universal nft. And what I mean by that is anyone can identify with it. That's important because, you know, I believe NFTs and their success from a collectible standpoint is really driven by supply and demand. And being the most universal ip, I think, entails that it has the highest room to have the most demand. Right? It is not subjugated to, you know, certain interests or certain ethnic groups.
00:22:04.496 - 00:22:35.404, Speaker B: It really is such a big and broad spectrum of people that could potentially want a Pudgy penguin that ultimately, you know, gives it what I think is probably the most important ingredient, which is potential for demand. Second, you had a culture that I think was, bar none, Pudgy Penguins got hit with every piece of FUD that a community could possibly get hit with. It's honestly not comparable to anything else. And the lowest floor price that Pudgy Penguins ever hit was like 0.6, 0.7 Ethereum. And for most, that would be a huge accomplishment.
00:22:35.404 - 00:23:29.302, Speaker B: And what that signaled to me is people were buying the Pudgy Penguin because they loved the culture, because they loved the art, because they loved the penguin, not because of any future utility or what the team was doing. You know, the Pudgy Penguin community was formed amongst a team that didn't have any idea what they were doing. All in all, the market was there, the ingredients for the Pudgy Penguin IP was there. And we felt like we had the right skill sets to do something that had never been done before, which is build a real brand in the real world and do something for crypto that I believe has been a keyword for many, many years, which is mass adoption. How can you actually create that and not just use that as a hot keyboard to sell more tokens or to, to, you know, galvanize a group without actually doing it? And so that's kind of how we came to this moment. It's been a wild ride for the last two years almost, and excited for the many years to come.
00:23:29.406 - 00:23:51.422, Speaker C: I have many questions related to what you just said. One is, you said that Pudgy Penguins is the most universal brand. What does that mean exactly? Does it mean that, you know, for example, it's a set of very cute animals and anyone can identify with it? There's no race, there is no gender or whatever. Is that what you mean by that?
00:23:51.526 - 00:24:37.354, Speaker B: I mean, when you look at a pudgy penguin, you compare it to the lot, right? A lot of NFT projects are categorized as either super cool and exclusive, or maybe they're in the anime niche or maybe they're in, you know, another niche. With Pudgy Penguins it is borderless, it is boxless, meaning I could be black, white or Asian or hispanic. And I could identify with a pudgy penguin. I could be a man or a woman and I can identify with a pudgy penguin. I could be a developer or a consumer product guy or a cool kid and I could identify with a pudgy penguin. I could be a family oriented guy. And this is an IP that I think could resonate and could impact not only the 50 year old or the 30 year old who's the collector, but also the 5 and the 7 and the 10 year old.
00:24:37.354 - 00:25:08.630, Speaker B: And that to me, I think is more important than I think people realize it has to be a broader spectrum where right now I think crypto has really developed a bro culture and that's great. But if we want crypto to win, I think it has to be so much more than that. And I think you have to bring the family and have to get the family involved and have to get other people from other walks of life to get interested here. And I believe Pudgy Penguins is the most well positioned to attract that audience.
00:25:08.790 - 00:25:23.120, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm not trying to dunk on the other collections, which I also own the leading collections on Solana or. Or Cosmos. Bat kids, for example. Bat kids and matlads. They're all males, right? The collection is all males.
00:25:23.280 - 00:25:24.784, Speaker B: Matlad has women in it.
00:25:24.872 - 00:25:47.894, Speaker C: It has. Okay, I never see anyone with female matlads. But anyway, what you described is the same reason that basically Doge is the number one meme coin, right? Because everyone loves dogs. There's basically two types of people. There's people who love dogs and there's people who love cats. So is that what you mean by being universal in that sense?
00:25:48.022 - 00:25:58.050, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's net neutral, it's for everyone. And just like a Doge is net neutral, one for everyone, I think a penguin is as well.
00:25:58.350 - 00:26:15.880, Speaker A: Just a funny side note was I showed my daughter all of the NFTs that were out there. Pudgy penguins, mutants, apes, etc. And I told her, which one would you pick? And she picked pudgies. And I asked her why. She said it was cute.
00:26:16.780 - 00:26:40.258, Speaker C: I did the same experiment with my wife because my daughter is too young for that. But my wife. I showed a bunch of meme coins and NFT collections to my wife and there's two things she liked. One is whiff and the other one is pudgies. So I aped into both. Okay, I have another question related to the acquisition, and it's a little bit more technical, but what did you actually acquire?
00:26:40.434 - 00:26:55.538, Speaker B: A pool of assets. It wasn't really a business, so about 60 different assets, from contract addresses to penguins in their treasury, to social media handles, it was just a pool of about 60 assets.
00:26:55.634 - 00:26:59.650, Speaker C: Which one of the assets do you feel is, in hindsight, the most valuable?
00:26:59.810 - 00:27:06.714, Speaker B: The contract address. Without the contract address, you don't own. Pudgy penguins probably be the most important.
00:27:06.882 - 00:27:19.466, Speaker C: Okay, what about the ability to monetize by selling toys at Walmart? Is that something that came as a result of the acquisition that was previously not possible?
00:27:19.618 - 00:27:50.672, Speaker B: Yeah, I think what we've done, I think for this space is show that there's a conundrum. Right. The conundrum is previous NFT projects monetized by selling more digital collectibles, which ultimately segments the liquidity. What you really want to do is you want to concentrate liquidity and you want to concentrate demand. Right. And the idea of selling more digital collectibles, though you can make hundreds of millions of dollars doing it, I think ultimately is a means to an end. And if you create under that cadence.
00:27:50.672 - 00:28:30.656, Speaker B: I think it is a recipe for short term success, but long term disaster. And so what's the solution? The solution is you have to build a self sustaining business. Now, are we getting rich selling toys and other products? No, not necessarily. But does it cover our bottom line? Does it put us in a position of strength where we're not forced to mint more digital collectibles at the expense of our community? Yes. And so the toys and the products for us is really a mindshare game and a marketing game. You know, are they, are they the things that are going to make Pudgy Penguins and the Igloo Company a billion dollar business? No, but they're going to create the mind share that's going to give us the opportunity to then become that. Right.
00:28:30.656 - 00:29:08.732, Speaker B: And so, you know, I think of it as an additive layer to the ecosystem instead of an extractive layer to the ecosystem where a lot of founders I think will tell you that, you know, NFTs and adding more NFTs is additive. And I do think they can be. It's important to note that minting, you know, NFTs, I don't want people to get the wrong impression. Like I, I think that can be a huge positive. And to be frank, there's very few things more exciting that gets the whole entire space more excited than a new NFT collection. It can be the biggest growth driver and it can be a huge revenue driver. It's an amazing mechanism to grow.
00:29:08.732 - 00:29:46.796, Speaker B: However, you have to do those things right and you have to do those things when, you know, when there's clear, overflowing demand for your product. Currently people just mint NFT collections and add NFT collections to their ecosystem without clear overflowing demand. And that is the key. You have to do things when demand is overflowing and you have to do things, you know, when the time is right and when the ecosystem and the collection will allow it. And so building a real business really does two things. It creates more mindshare and more marketing to people outside of our ecosystem as well as inside of our ecosystem. It creates a forecastable and growable revenue stream.
00:29:46.796 - 00:30:32.290, Speaker B: And it also creates a number non intimidating and non taboo narrative for people who know nothing about Pudgy Penguins. Because I don't want to sell people on NFTs, I want to sell people on the love of the penguin. And so these three combined factors then morph into, you know, a place where our armor from a company perspective is strong, I think where people begin to buckle and work. These businesses have Failed is once you have a chink in your armor, the chink begins to crack the rest of the suit. And then you ultimately get into a, a position where you're either, you know, really well capitalized as a company, but your community is miserable. Which is never a place where I would want to consciously put our community members in, or, you know, the whole business has failed. Either one of the two.
00:30:32.290 - 00:30:55.940, Speaker B: That's kind of our thought process behind, you know, building a real brand. And I want to show the world that we can take something that's crypto native, we can take something that's blockchain native, and build something real that tens of millions of people know and love. Right. Right now, crypto adoption is predicated on price going up or price going down. And it starts and stops there. Right. Like, I think crypto and blockchain technology is so much more than that.
00:30:55.940 - 00:31:12.168, Speaker B: I think Web3 is so much more than that. And I believe there has to be somebody who, you know, looks at that and says, let's create an emotional bond, let's create something that's real, let's create something that's tangible, and let's do it in a way that I think this industry specifically has never seen before.
00:31:12.364 - 00:31:52.876, Speaker A: One follow up question I have is when you talk about minting additional collections, I actually like the fact that you airdropped or pudgy penguins airdropped little pudgies as opposed to buying the actual nft. So Yuga Labs went through this kind of like gamified experience where you're able to mint a mutant or a kennel, et cetera, and you had to pay for those. And I think that turned out to be, at least at the time, net positive. It created this flywheel that you were just talking about. But for the Azuki's case, it was actually net negative. And it was a net negative because people thought they were getting something much more differently. And so it turns out to be it's almost the exact same replica.
00:31:52.876 - 00:32:14.106, Speaker A: Right. So there was like more of a dilutive process there. So I guess the question I'm getting at here is like, how do you know like the type of experience you want to create? And like, do you think about it from a dilutive perspective? Do you think about it from a growth driver perspective? Do you feel like minting additional collections is diluted, Net diluted?
00:32:14.218 - 00:33:09.128, Speaker B: I think 99% of the time it has been, I think there's been a few occasions where it's been a net positive. And if we were to ever do it, I have Enough case studies in front of me to know when is something a net positive and when is something a net negative. And I think the underlying variable here that determines whether it's going to be a net positive or a net negative is the current price of your cheapest item in your ecosystem. Is it incredibly clear that your cheapest item in your ecosystem is so expensive that new people just can't get in? Because then eventually you have to like tier it out like a pyramid, right? Hey, pudgy penguins at 20 eth. Most people can't afford a pudgy penguin at 20. I understand you have a little pudgy, little pudgies cost, you know, five, six grand, they're still affordable, right? But one day, hopefully if we do our job, a pudgy, a little pudgy is worth 20 grand. And then all of a sudden it doesn't become affordable.
00:33:09.128 - 00:33:52.194, Speaker B: And now people who might not have the same capital, you know, for 20 grand little pudgy or 100 grand big pudgy, are now put in a position where, you know, they would love to be a part of the ecosystem. They support us, they love what we're doing, they love how we're leading and they love how we're building and they, more importantly, they love the community and they want to be a part of it. And now you need to give them a cheaper price point for them to get in. You know, floor price signals demand. And so if you have a high floor price, then ultimately it's clear that there's demand for your digital product. And after a certain point, if demand is so clear, clear that a lot of people want more of this, then that can be a huge growth driver. Mutant Apes is a perfect example.
00:33:52.194 - 00:34:15.452, Speaker B: Mutant Apes blew the roof off of the board ape ecosystem because they added 20,000 more NFTs, more people wearing the PFPs, more people championing the product, more people galvanizing around the community, more people building that. It was a huge positive versus, you know, there's maybe other examples where it was the complete opposite. You clearly did not. The floor was not indicative of overflowing demand.
00:34:15.636 - 00:34:49.686, Speaker C: Slightly separate topic, but related this problem of unit price, floor price not being affordable to most people in the long term, like it'll continue to happen. As you mentioned, little pudgies will appreciate in price and at some point so high that most people will be priced out. Now, are you going to launch new collections like new little little pudgies or at some point? Because at some point, ultimately the only solution to this problem is to launch a Fungible token, because the fungibility makes it so that everyone can afford it. Like, are you thinking along those lines or.
00:34:49.838 - 00:35:20.914, Speaker B: Yeah, it's interesting. Like, I think for us, we're interested in winning the current battle that we're in today. And the current battle that we're in today is, you know, I want Pudgy Penguins to be the face of NFTs and the face of Web3. And to do that, we have to have the highest floor price. That's just the nature of what it means to be that, to be the leader of the space. And so that's my focus above all else. Now, there's interesting, because you're right, but this is where I think the beauty of crypto innovators kind of comes in.
00:35:20.914 - 00:35:48.224, Speaker B: There's a guy called FLC who built Flooring Lab. Right now you can go on Flooring protocol and buy $1 worth of a Pudgy penguin. And he has hundreds of pudgy penguins in the vault that basically are fractionalized. Basically one penguin is a million UPPG tokens. And this is where I think things are going to open. And that got listed on Woo. So you can just go to woo, which is like a decentralized decks, and just buy that, or you can go to Flooring Protocol and buy that.
00:35:48.224 - 00:36:55.330, Speaker B: And, you know, the goal for him is he gets that, you know, up PG on Finance and UPG on Coinbase. And, you know, all of a sudden, you know, you actually get the liquidity that you need for these NFT collections because it, because it brings up an interesting elephant in the room. The elephant in the room is, you know, Pudgy penguins is a $500 million market cap. NFT. You know, you look at, you know, coin market cap, and you look at all the NFT, you know, all the coins that are worth 500 million, even some that are worth a billion. When you stack up their accomplishments versus ours and like, you know, their marketing, their exposure, their engagement, you know, what they've actually done for the space, like the innovation behind what they've done versus what we've done, I would argue we are way more innovative, we are way more awareness, we have way more brand appeal, we have way more exposure than they do. And so ultimately, it's a very interesting little moment here where I think the NFT side of it is critically undervalued when you just look at it from a market cap perspective, compared to, I think a lot of the vaporware that kind of exists today that doesn't really do anything.
00:36:55.330 - 00:36:57.634, Speaker B: And that's why I'm so bullish on NFTs.
00:36:57.762 - 00:37:02.502, Speaker A: So, side note, what are your thoughts on ERC or DN 404?
00:37:02.606 - 00:37:23.090, Speaker B: I think it's dope. I love things that are applicable to existing collections. And so that's why I'll give flooring labs their flowers. Like, I think that's a huge solution because I believe, I believe the companies that will lead the NFT revolution, I think at least two of the two of the three, if you're going to assume that three are going to lead it, they already exist now.
00:37:23.790 - 00:37:25.302, Speaker C: Sorry, and who are they?
00:37:25.406 - 00:37:56.918, Speaker B: I think it's us and Yuga, in my opinion today. But that does not mean I don't think Azuki could do it or I don't think Doodles could do it. I think those would probably the two closest runner ups. But I obviously believe in ourselves, like we put our money where our mouth is and we bought this thing. And I think we've proven ourselves to be an unequivocal leader in the space. And then, you know, Yuga is still the top dog, so I can't pretend that they're not. And so as long as they're the top dog, I think right now we're the two leaders.
00:37:56.918 - 00:38:16.970, Speaker B: And a third or a fourth might emerge that's already existing and then maybe a new one might emerge. And so to the question, the current standards that you mentioned are really relevant for new collections. So I don't know how impactful that will be because I think the leaders are already existing.
00:38:17.310 - 00:38:21.592, Speaker A: So if you were to launch a new collection today, would you use one of these standards?
00:38:21.656 - 00:38:48.124, Speaker B: Launch? I probably. I, I really heavily consider it because you're in the game of liquidity and you want as many people to have exposure to your brand as possible. That's why tokenizing is always seems like probably the last step is like I want to bring as many people in, I want hundreds of thousands of holders. And so it's a, it's an interesting dilemma and, and I'm glad to see those guys innovate over there. And Sidegar is doing a great job.
00:38:48.292 - 00:39:15.202, Speaker C: So Pudgy Penguins basically went from the lowest was what, like 06 ETH all the way to today? 20 ETH. Obviously you've done a lot of things to make that happen, but I mean, building a brand is like building a startup. It's always a culmination of many, many things. But what would you say is the most important thing, project milestone that you did throughout the last two years in terms of impact on the floor price?
00:39:15.306 - 00:39:59.962, Speaker B: I think the single biggest moment in an announcement has been the Walmart announcements because of how significant and real. And if you understand consumer brand, it's not only just an incredible feat for blockchain and crypto, it really is also just an incredible feat for consumer products. The program and the shelf space that we have in Walmart is unheard of for a brand that's been around as long as we've been around, like nobody gets those type of placements. We've basically been a brand for 14 months. You know, the first seven, eight months of building this thing, it was like black swan after black swan contagion across the board. We had no money in the bank, we were barely building and you know, incorporating the company and making sure we had all the things to actually run in a real business. We all worked for free.
00:39:59.962 - 00:40:29.882, Speaker B: So, you know, there was, you know, some guys were distracted, you know, paying the bills and doing other things. So we've only really been building this brand for 14 months. And to be able to build a brand in that short amount of time and to dominate the world's biggest retailer the way that we've dominated it is a herculane feat, I think obviously for Ethereum and blockchain and just the bunch. But I also think from a consumer products perspective. So I think if you're talking about moment that, if you're talking about in general like why.
00:40:30.066 - 00:40:35.524, Speaker C: And you're talking about the one in September last year, we announced in October.
00:40:35.572 - 00:41:22.004, Speaker B: Yeah, October, October. Okay, but, but if you were to ask me like why are we here? It's not because of Walmart, because I think we had momentum before then. It's really because of delivering on the expectation that we set and proliferation. Billions and billions of impressions have been accrued since we took over around the Penguin. And so what does visibility around the Penguin do? It creates demand. And when you create demand and awareness and you have 8,888 NFTs, which is not many, and you continuously are creating demand and awareness, the elementary school supply and demand model kicks in and eventually you have that explosive moment which I think we've seen as of recently.
00:41:22.172 - 00:42:08.050, Speaker A: So you talked a bit about this, but I'd love to expand, which is tribalism in crypto. Obviously it's a net positive for NFT communities, but when it comes to like being on different chains, it turns out to be a net negative. So if you look at D Gods as an example, he moved, Frank moved from different chains as an example. So he got backlash from one community out of the Other, you know, pudgy penguins tried a different route, which is like bridging the asset to different chains. And you're seeing maybe Yuga Labs, like launching ordinals and other experiments. What would you tell founders? Do you kind of settle on one chain, you focus on building communities there? Do you see yourself ever launching a collection on other chains? How do you kind of build an organic community on these types of different tribal chains?
00:42:08.210 - 00:42:47.722, Speaker B: Yeah, I love what Layer Zero is doing. So I think the future is ultimately Omnichain. I do believe that if you are going to mint, there's a couple clever ways to not be dilutive. I think minting on other chains is a great way to reduced 30% of the net negative effects. So, like, if I minted something on Salana, it wouldn't be the same as minting something on Ethereum, because I'm really just capturing so much extra liquidity. Now some people that have like, you know, some people in the Ethereum ecosystem will sell some things off and try to go with the thing in Solana, but, you know, a majority. If I were to mint a 10,000 NFT collection on Solana, I'd probably assume at least 50% of the buyers had.
00:42:47.722 - 00:43:25.338, Speaker B: Had never had any pudgy penguin exposure before, versus if I minted the collection on Ethereum, I would probably assume 80% of the buyers there or a part of the pudgy penguin ecosystem at some point. Right. And so it is like a great hedge to the dilutiveness. And I think we haven't seen any of this as of recently. I believe we'll see a lot more of this kind of going, this new paradigm shift. And I'm thinking about it like if we were to add something existing and it's not in the roadmap and it's so far from my peripherals, I'd probably do it on another chain, to be frank.
00:43:25.434 - 00:43:49.128, Speaker C: And also related to this, choosing one chain versus launching on multiple chains, it makes me think about Yuga Labs, which has acquired a bunch of ips and meanwhile you focus on just one. What's the rationale behind the strategy of focusing on one IP versus Yuga Lab, which is obviously the elephant in the room, and just keep acquiring new IPs.
00:43:49.224 - 00:44:22.002, Speaker B: I'm pretty open. I don't know if I necessarily agree with their strategy there. Now I think I know you can kind of entail what they're doing and it's almost like this NFT capture this dominate, like we are the guys, because look at the top 10 Ethereum collections it's usually like we, we are him, we are them. And I actually think like that's a, that's a great, like that's not a bad approach because it's like you, you own the board. Right. But I will take a little bit of a different approach. I plan on owning the board as well.
00:44:22.002 - 00:44:42.542, Speaker B: Right. But I have every intention to own the board. I want to own the board and the table in which the board sits and the chairs in which the, the people are playing on the game on the board and the chair and all the whole night. So you know, I like that. But I think these businesses are incredibly hard. I'm just going to just say it. This is not an easy company to run.
00:44:42.542 - 00:45:46.200, Speaker B: And I say that positively because I love a challenge and I think this is what has matured us to be, you know, even better entrepreneurs than when we came into this. But I want to solidify the Penguin as the unequivocal Mickey Mouse to Web3 and NFT IP. Like I want it to be the guy above all else, the one that broke the most barriers, the one that changed the entire landscape of what everybody is doing. And for me to then, you know, absorb other collections. The idea that you can have multiple teams running autonomously like a machine is amazing in principle. But if you've actually run an org before, the challenge of executing that, there is only so many companies in the world that have ever been able to pull that type of organization and system and processes off. And I think from my perspective, I don't think we are at a level yet to sit there or I don't think we've accomplished the things that we need to accomplish yet.
00:45:46.200 - 00:46:03.590, Speaker B: You guys also in a different spot. They can go and work on the board because they've won. Right? Right. They, they have been the winner for the last three years. So when you've won for the last three years, it is the, it is the next step. We haven't won yet. I can't even own the board if I don't even own the king or, or in this case the queen.
00:46:03.590 - 00:46:32.156, Speaker B: I've got to, I've got to be the most powerful, you know, chip on the board before I can go and think about owning the board in which we haven't accomplished yet. So I respect the strategy. I, I see what they're doing and it's going to create a natural moat for them to always be on the top of NFT collectors minds. But from, from our perspective, we have a goal right now which is to be the face of NFTs and the face of Web3 and we haven't accomplished that. Until we do, I have no other focus.
00:46:32.308 - 00:46:47.586, Speaker C: Is there any reason why Pudgy Penguins wouldn't ultimately overtake Punks? Like how would you Steel Man Punks? I mean, because obviously Imran and I are both very, very bullish pudgies. So are you, obviously. But can you Steel Man Punks?
00:46:47.698 - 00:47:07.150, Speaker B: Yeah. The Steelman would be that, you know, there is no execution risk, which I hate that. But there is, there is like that. That is the Steel man is the Punk is the first. I think we put too much precedent on the 1st. It's not about who did it first, it's about who did it best. And this idea that there's like low risk.
00:47:07.150 - 00:47:45.404, Speaker B: Right. And so I think, I think Punks will be the most stable PFP out of the bunch, but I don't think they yield the highest upside. And for someone not to bet on execution I think is not to bet on innovation and is not to understand how this space has even come to fruition in the first place. Betting on Bitcoin in 2009 was. Execution was on its face, the code on the Bitcoin dev team. Same with Ethereum. Every barrier that's been broken and every giant leap that any industry has ever made has been made off of the bet of execution risk.
00:47:45.404 - 00:48:31.442, Speaker B: But punk OGs will tell you or I talk to big funds that only have like trad art exposure or punk exposure. And it's because there's this notion that, you know, there's a long term thesis and for some reason, you know, they don't want to bet on execution. And I just think those guys are just going to severely underperform. I know somebody specifically, he has an NFT fund and I know he has outperformed every NFT fund out there. He's the highest performing percentage NFT fund. He's also one of the biggest Pudgy Penguin holders and he bets on teams who are executing and doing things right. And every other fund who's deployed tens of millions of dollars in capital has bet on art and provenance.
00:48:31.442 - 00:48:44.802, Speaker B: And they're just losing. And they're going to continue to lose now. They'll perform. I think they will do well, but they will not outperform the guys who are betting on execution because I think that's just where the highest upside ultimately will live.
00:48:44.906 - 00:48:53.010, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't say this on Twitter, but I'm secretly pretty bearish. Art in general. Art NFTs relative to PFPs.
00:48:53.170 - 00:48:59.232, Speaker A: Yeah, I think there are a few collections like Fidenza, Squiggles, Autoglyphs, but relative.
00:48:59.296 - 00:49:01.984, Speaker C: Speaking, I'm far more bullish. Pfps.
00:49:02.112 - 00:49:02.704, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:49:02.832 - 00:49:14.368, Speaker A: I mean, yeah, I guess the customer base is different, right? I mean, for art, you're going to tap into more of the classical art collectors. Right. Whereas for PFPs, it's going to be retail community.
00:49:14.504 - 00:49:30.886, Speaker C: Because PFP just go viral a lot more easily. Like because you see them, you see them all the time on Twitter. It's literally in the PfP. It's everywhere. But when you want to flex a art nft, you have to actually tweet it out. So it takes effort and you can only do it once.
00:49:31.038 - 00:49:40.278, Speaker A: And you kind of look like a jerk doing it because it's worth. Right. I guess. What is your favorite art collection, Luca?
00:49:40.374 - 00:50:10.404, Speaker B: I have an interesting taste, I would probably say I'm starting to get really excited about. I love the squiggle, I love the autoglyph. I really like. The best one though out of the bunch to me is a guy named Sam Pratt and he's got the Monkees. I mean, sorry, Sam, to bake you into them. He's more than the monkey guy, but he really makes masterpieces. And I think Sam Pratt is going to be the star this time around, in my opinion.
00:50:10.532 - 00:50:48.672, Speaker A: Cool. What are your thoughts on the OpenSea Magic Eden competition? Obviously, OpenSea had the first movers advantage where obviously a lot of their work has helped NFTs kind of go mainstream. And I feel like the whole royalty dilemma really kind of kept them conflicted with users and creators. And now that Magic Eden is moving into the space, to me, from the outside, it seems as if they're trying to get exclusivity from our creators to reinforce royalty fees. What's your thoughts on both magic Eden and OpenSea and which way are you going?
00:50:48.776 - 00:51:13.450, Speaker B: Yeah, I think I'll forever be grateful for what OpenSea did for the space. I think without OpenSea, none of these collections really thrive the way that they do. But talk about a cataclysmic fumble. And even as of recently, when we were exploring Magic Eden and I talked to opensea, they made so much money on everyone and they are just not willing to put it back into the ecosystem. I don't know what the plan is. I think I know what the plan is. I think.
00:51:13.450 - 00:51:30.938, Speaker B: I think they just want to ride this. I think they just want to pay that. I think they just want to pay themselves insane salaries. And just why this ride this thing until zero. Because if you actually look at OpenSea's revenue numbers. It's insane how much money they made and they haven't built anything or marketed anything. So the money must be in the bank.
00:51:30.938 - 00:52:00.504, Speaker B: And so he can't down rounded or any. They don't need to do any of that. They can just pay themselves a boatload of money. Like I would the, the salary there would be totally indicative of this thesis. But they have no interest in putting any liquidity back into the ecosystem. Whether that's through marketing, whether that's through partnerships, whether that's through events. It's like how can you pay yourself a 2 1/2% marketplace fee and pay the cruise greater zero.
00:52:00.504 - 00:52:56.988, Speaker B: That is so out of touch with reality that the only reason why OpenSea gets any volume today is because of the natural behavior that people get to go and look at floor prices and their moat on SEO. They have a crazy moat on the Google indexing and once they lose that, it's kaput, dude. Now royalties are an interesting conversation. I'm a firm believer that royalties to drive growth. Simple reason is like how did YouTube find success? They paid their creators and web3 and why did web3 find success? Because creating a web3 versus creating on YouTube got paid a thousand times more thousand impressions than you did in YouTube. Like you could get 500 likes on your Twitter posts and make tens of millions of dollars. In web3 you can get fucking 10 million views on YouTube video and make a million bucks a year.
00:52:56.988 - 00:53:21.084, Speaker B: Right? Like it's just creators drive eyeballs, you know. And when creators drive eyeballs, they bring more people to the space in which they kind of want people to go. They're basically, they control the attention and this is an attention economy. Now our community specifically is super crypto native. They're super trader native. I'm probably going to assume that our community will not let us enforce royalties. There's going to be a.
00:53:21.084 - 00:53:49.326, Speaker B: You know, I think a lot of collections are to go down that route. And I'm at the end of the day, I'm the muscle, that is the brain, that is the community. I will not do anything they do not want me to do, even if I think it's in the best interest of the space or the best interest of the company. I will win if they win. And that's kind of been our motto and it's worked so far and so I'll continue on that path. But I believe royalties are a net positive to the space. Now I do think there should be a minimum royalty and there also should be a maximum.
00:53:49.326 - 00:53:55.638, Speaker B: Do I think you deserve 10%? No. Do I think you deserve seven and a half percent? No. Do I think YOU deserve 5% also?
00:53:55.694 - 00:53:56.022, Speaker A: Probably.
00:53:56.086 - 00:54:08.566, Speaker B: No. How much money some of these groups made is absurd. Do I think it's.5%? No. I actually think the number is somewhere between 1 and 2% is a fair minimum enforceable royalty. And then you keep it moving. Right.
00:54:08.566 - 00:54:25.502, Speaker B: If I got paid 1%, which right now I get paid 0.5%, I would be really fricking good. We would be scaling way harder, we'd be building way harder. And I think that's fair. Right. But this idea that you can enforce 5% I think is a fool's errand. Truthfully.
00:54:25.646 - 00:54:29.022, Speaker C: Enforcing the relative. Is it up to you or the marketplace?
00:54:29.166 - 00:54:39.726, Speaker B: It's up to the marketplace and me. But ultimately I can enforce it, but the marketplace won't enforce it. Which right now blur enforces 0.5% and 0.5% is what we get.
00:54:39.878 - 00:54:45.604, Speaker C: But you can't single handedly enforce it without the marketplace, right? Correct.
00:54:45.732 - 00:54:54.004, Speaker A: So Yuga Labs is going down the route of their own exclusive marketplace with Magic Eden. What are your thoughts on that?
00:54:54.092 - 00:55:09.720, Speaker B: I think it's great. I think it's a great decision. I think it's a great partnership for Magic Eden. I think Magic Eden has all of the room to completely dominate and take market share from pretty much everyone. They are in the driver's seat. And so it's up to Magic Eden to execute and do what they need to do. But I have full faith in them.
00:55:09.720 - 00:55:39.838, Speaker B: We're supporting the Magic Eden marketplace. I will obviously try to drive attention to that marketplace. I want people to pay royalties when they're trading, but I am not going to say that you can only trade it and here and not trade it anywhere else. I believe in the power of decentralization and freedom of choice. And our community will have the freedom to choose where they trade their NFTs and what royalties they pay. But from a company perspective, I hope no one blames me. I'm going to try to point you to Magic Eden because it's how we keep the lights on and how we keep doing amazing things for the industry.
00:55:39.974 - 00:55:44.014, Speaker C: And it sounds like you're not that bullish on Blur either.
00:55:44.142 - 00:55:46.078, Speaker A: Are they net positive or net negative?
00:55:46.174 - 00:56:07.726, Speaker B: I was very pessimistic in the beginning and today I'm less pessimistic. I think they've created something that is super exciting and if he were to just bump that royalty rate to 0.5%, to 1% or 0.75%, just something a little bit more than 0.5%, which I think is like a little egregious. Like spreads in traditional markets. Guys make more than that.
00:56:07.726 - 00:56:27.630, Speaker B: Obviously they make less. But, you know, I know certain assets that you can trade where the people, the intermediaries are, you know, making way more than that. I would scream Pac Man's name to the back of the bleachers if he just bumped it up a little. And I still kind of do. I think their group is incredibly bright. A group of geniuses. I mean, that whole crew, they get it.
00:56:27.630 - 00:56:55.882, Speaker B: They're so smart, they're so talented. I was really pessimistic in the beginning, but I think ultimately they created a product that is the best product in the space right now, just from a trading perspective, one that was necessary. My only disagreement with where they stand today is just their minimum enforceable royalty. And I really didn't enjoy them when they first came to light. I thought it was a huge net negative. But now seeing what has transpired, I'm very bullish on that crew and Blast and Blur and the whole night.
00:56:55.986 - 00:57:23.474, Speaker A: What are your thoughts on Blur farmers and. And you know, you see CBB and many others that are farming blur via purchasing NFTs, lending them on blend, et cetera. Do you feel that that's healthy market activity? Do you feel like. Because now you're starting to see, obviously now pudgy penguins is getting dominance. A lot of these farmers are going in holding pudgies now. And so I see that as a positive too. But I'm just curious on how you see it.
00:57:23.562 - 00:57:42.156, Speaker B: I think in its totality, again, it's like freedom of choice. And you mentioned CBB specifically. I think of all the farmers, he has a really fair way of how to farm. I think it's when thing. When things get tricky. Like, for example, there's a thing that happened recently, and I'll explain to you that science, it's like a money printer. If you have thousands of eth.
00:57:42.156 - 00:57:59.354, Speaker B: There's a guy that literally did this yesterday. He dumped 40 penguins. He brought the floor down like 7, 8%. And then what he did is he listed the rest of his penguins. He put like a monster wall at 2.3, like 3:30 penguins at 2.3, basically indicating that this thing is not going to go over or 20.3.
00:57:59.354 - 00:58:25.074, Speaker B: This thing's not going to go over 20.3. So anybody who's trading or holding or has like paper hands, like looking at that and they're capitulating, and then what he does is he'll put like a bid at like 18.5. And he'll just absorb it, all right, and then take it back up, break all the walls. Momentum kicks, goes at 22, 24, 25, and then sells it. And because he has these thousands of eth. And like, you know, there. There isn't much listed.
00:58:25.074 - 00:58:43.826, Speaker B: There's, you know, good news. So he's not like, but. But he'll basically sell at a high price, try to push it lower, and then. And go out and like, it's like, well, dude, you know, that it's cool. But that can't be the free market. That seems like the rich man's market, right? Like, that seems.
00:58:43.858 - 00:58:53.596, Speaker C: You know who that is, because it sounds like, like a lot of very sophisticated market makers and tradfi do exactly this in, like, stock markets and stuff. Spoofing. Yeah, exactly.
00:58:53.708 - 00:58:53.980, Speaker A: If.
00:58:54.020 - 00:59:16.588, Speaker B: If they do, they do, right? And. And I'm not. I'm not as experienced in tradfi as the next guy, so. But, like, when I see that, I'm like, ah. But, you know, at the end of the day, they're free to do what they want. And, you know, liquidity, all liquidity is good liquidity. I think there could probably be a little bit more of a focus and an understanding as to like, how not, you know, one guy could completely manipulate things.
00:59:16.588 - 00:59:35.392, Speaker B: But, you know, I'm in the business of just doing my job. And my job is, like, it's. It's interesting to watch. And so I pay attention and I want to understand how the market works. I think that's really important. But my job is to make tens of millions of people know the penguin. At the end of the day, if I can make tens of millions of people know and love the penguin, all of that stuff won't even matter.
00:59:35.496 - 00:59:35.760, Speaker A: Right?
00:59:35.800 - 00:59:53.880, Speaker B: You could farm, you could try all you want, but the Penguin thesis. The Penguin thesis. And we will. We will win regardless. But if you're just asking me for the sake of this conversation, I would love. You know, I know CBB specifically has, like, a really fair way of approaching it. I've kind of, like, read his tweets and seen how he comes in that dialogue.
00:59:53.880 - 01:00:07.476, Speaker B: And it's like, yeah, you shouldn't be doing the pulling up the bids and then pulling the bids. It's like you're kind of killing the fun and the momentum for everybody. But it's the nature of the space. And my job is not to micromanage that or to figure that stuff out.
01:00:07.548 - 01:00:12.052, Speaker C: Lucari Bullish Ordinals I'm super Bullish ordinals. Why is that?
01:00:12.156 - 01:00:24.932, Speaker B: If you buy an ordinal, it feels like buying an Ethereum nft before Opensea was around. It feels slow and clunky and something nostalgic about it.
01:00:25.036 - 01:00:25.908, Speaker A: I love it.
01:00:26.044 - 01:00:31.252, Speaker B: It feels really good when you buy an ordinal, really. I'm incredibly bullish.
01:00:31.396 - 01:00:32.724, Speaker A: What's your favorite collection?
01:00:32.852 - 01:00:53.540, Speaker B: I probably have the biggest bag of Node monkeys. It's probably the biggest. Yes. And then Ombs. I think ZK Shark is the leader of ordinals. He is the guy. If you look at me or Gordon or Garga for Ethereum NFTs, he is that for ordinals.
01:00:53.540 - 01:00:59.552, Speaker B: So Node Monkeys Ombs, what's the other one that I got a ton of?
01:00:59.576 - 01:01:01.552, Speaker A: Bitcoin puppets. Puppets?
01:01:01.696 - 01:01:08.820, Speaker B: Nope, nope. No puppets. But they look cool. I got to get some puppets. Those. Those guys are. I feel like.
01:01:08.820 - 01:01:21.800, Speaker B: I feel like I'm just joining the Remilia world order. When I buy the puppets, I'm like, I already got my Romelios and my. My ladies. But I. With those, you got to let them. You got to watch them a little bit. Because if they have staying power, it will work.
01:01:21.800 - 01:01:33.138, Speaker B: If it. You know. If not, it's just. You don't know if they're going to treat it like a meme coin or not. But they are on the radar. The R6. I have a ton and your mining rune ZK told me to buy a ton and I bought a ton.
01:01:33.138 - 01:01:42.562, Speaker B: And I don't know what to do with them, so I'm just holding them. He said, don't sell them. It's a little. I bought a bunch of brcs. So I. I'm dabbling. I'm having fun.
01:01:42.562 - 01:02:02.348, Speaker B: I have fun still here. So it's important to me too, because if I don't, then I'll get miserable and I don't. Like, I'm. I'm still spending 15, 20 minutes a day at night, like right before I go to bed, like trading. Moving things around in the wallet. Because if I don't, then I'll lose touch with the culture and then I'll just become a suit and then I'm just a suit that I'm a loser. And then I just got to.
01:02:02.348 - 01:02:06.620, Speaker B: I'll get crushed if I let that happen. So I'm still having fun here.
01:02:06.740 - 01:02:09.692, Speaker C: What's her favorite collections on Solana?
01:02:09.836 - 01:02:33.090, Speaker B: Mad Lads, Clay knows, Galactic Geckos, SMBs. Got to pay homage to the SMBs, though. I don't know. All the drama and all the new. I don't know what's happened there, but SMBs are still dope. Probably the dopest art for me there. And then Tensorians, just because you got to pay homage to whatever those guys are doing.
01:02:33.790 - 01:02:40.810, Speaker C: So that's my Solana picks and top Ethereum picks. Outside of pudgies, only pudgies.
01:02:41.950 - 01:02:51.650, Speaker B: You know, there's a couple. Dude, there's a. There's a couple. I think Yuga, obviously, you know, the top dog. I didn't say Yuga. I'd be a fool. Azuki is great.
01:02:51.650 - 01:03:19.116, Speaker B: I think they're starting to really come out here. They're going to come out of the woodworks here, I think pretty shortly. Doodles. Doodles, I think is the dark horse. I think they said this on multiple podcasts recently, but I think what they've got going on is just awesome. I like the sappy seals. I think Wab's tenacity to just push through is really commendable and respectable and he really embodies, I think know Pudgy Penguins really I think is like the.
01:03:19.116 - 01:03:38.588, Speaker B: The what Pudgy Penguins has in terms of its culture. I think he has over there and obviously D gods. I know from a technical standpoint what happened with Frank. Like what. Why the collection is taking the beating that it's taking. Just elephant in the room. Just like one person, you know, a couple people just dump a couple hundred of these things and that.
01:03:38.588 - 01:03:56.860, Speaker B: That this happened to Pudgy. So last December, pudgy went to 7 and a half E and we had 200. Basically the biggest holder at the time just, you know, had to just disperse the penguins. He's dumped 200 of them over the course of two weeks. It took us a whole year to get that out of. Out of the farmer's hands. Just.
01:03:56.860 - 01:04:08.924, Speaker B: It just was impossible. It took us a whole year. And like that happened to Frank. Times like two it feels like. And I think it's got a bad rap. But let's not forget he is a leader in this space. He is one of the greats.
01:04:08.924 - 01:04:31.250, Speaker B: I mean to pretend that he's not just because, you know, they took a beating is to not understand his contributions. We got to pay homage and pay respect where respect is due. And all he needs is a little bit of a kick and just that. That some somebody just to take 200 out of the blurs farmers hands and let those guys run. And I know when that happens, they'll be back to where they once were.
01:04:31.370 - 01:04:46.904, Speaker C: All these collections that you mentioned that you're bullish on. Let's do a fun exercise can you use one word to describe each one of them? What is the word that embodies the culture of that community? Let's start with pudgies.
01:04:47.032 - 01:04:47.832, Speaker B: Greatness.
01:04:47.976 - 01:04:48.792, Speaker C: Punks.
01:04:48.936 - 01:04:49.980, Speaker B: Provenance.
01:04:51.440 - 01:04:52.472, Speaker C: No. Monkeys.
01:04:52.616 - 01:04:54.820, Speaker B: Next up, Next up.
01:04:55.760 - 01:04:56.824, Speaker C: Malads.
01:04:56.952 - 01:04:57.704, Speaker B: Innovation.
01:04:57.832 - 01:04:58.952, Speaker C: Tensorians.
01:04:59.096 - 01:04:59.864, Speaker B: Builders.
01:04:59.992 - 01:05:01.032, Speaker C: Azukis.
01:05:01.176 - 01:05:06.044, Speaker B: A couple. I just want to pick the right one. I was gonna say art. That's good.
01:05:06.132 - 01:05:08.524, Speaker A: What are your thoughts on Mokemons?
01:05:08.652 - 01:05:10.844, Speaker B: Oh, those, those base ones.
01:05:10.972 - 01:05:11.660, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:05:11.820 - 01:05:36.542, Speaker B: Guys. You guys are just using me to. I think it's great. I mean, I, I, you know what I don't like? I don't like that somebody doesn't give me a call and be like, yo, man, I got whitelist for you. You know, because I, I buy these things and I, so no one gets me into the party and so I got a little upset when I'm not into the party. But Antoine Mingo is a huge part of the Pudgy Penguin lore and I have a ton of respect for what they got going on over there.
01:05:36.646 - 01:05:42.558, Speaker C: So it's the same artist that created Pudgy Penguins that created Mokemon. Right.
01:05:42.614 - 01:05:47.662, Speaker B: I haven't talked to Mingo in forever, but it seems like that's the case.
01:05:47.766 - 01:05:50.830, Speaker A: That could be a perfect part of the Pudgy Penguins family.
01:05:50.950 - 01:05:51.918, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe.
01:05:52.014 - 01:06:04.380, Speaker A: Final questions. Defi. What do you think about NFT? DeFi? Right, right. So you have startups like Wasabi, NFT Perp and others that are building Defi infrastructure for NFT Future. Future.
01:06:04.680 - 01:06:30.724, Speaker B: It's necessary. Some people don't like it, some people do, but it just adds use cases to these things. And, you know, I can own my pudgy penguin, take 70% out on it and like, you know, hit big or lose it all. But like, that's just like, I can triple win there. Like, there's, there, you know, ETH can go up, Pudgy Penguins can go up. I can take the 70% I can make, I can double up on the trade. I can like quadruple win in a way that you can't quadruple win anywhere else.
01:06:30.852 - 01:06:34.276, Speaker A: You know, what's your go to defi protocol for NFT Arcade?
01:06:34.388 - 01:06:51.732, Speaker B: Just because I will always resonate with people who represent the Pudgy Penguin brand and their whole C suites, basically. Pudgy Penguin, you know, PFPs, that's just naturally, I will always gravitate towards that and I think they have the best product. But just giving you that context, we.
01:06:51.756 - 01:07:06.696, Speaker A: Have the founder, Wasabi, who is part of Alliance 12 cohort Iran. What's one advice that you would give future Founders building a space. Since you've been in space for the past two years, do things that don't scale. This is actually something that you guys.
01:07:06.728 - 01:07:08.136, Speaker C: Have been hammering on us.
01:07:08.288 - 01:07:15.368, Speaker B: But as a founder, a personal goal of mine is actually to speak to all of my users. If I haven't reached out to you.
01:07:15.424 - 01:07:17.576, Speaker A: Please reach out to me over Twitter.
01:07:17.688 - 01:07:21.290, Speaker B: I want to learn what your feedback is. What how do you think we can.
01:07:21.330 - 01:07:23.722, Speaker C: Improve the product and implement those as.
01:07:23.746 - 01:07:27.482, Speaker A: Soon as possible and remind our audience what Wasabi does.
01:07:27.586 - 01:07:32.362, Speaker C: If you want to long or short any NFTs, you can go to Wasabi XYZ.
01:07:32.506 - 01:07:34.042, Speaker A: Great. Thanks so much for your time around.
01:07:34.146 - 01:07:34.950, Speaker C: Thank you.
01:07:39.010 - 01:07:40.730, Speaker A: Have you used Wasabi?
01:07:40.810 - 01:07:42.506, Speaker B: I have used Wasabi. They're dope.
01:07:42.618 - 01:07:43.418, Speaker C: Meta Street.
01:07:43.554 - 01:07:51.580, Speaker B: Oh. David Choi is as big of a legend as it gets. Seriously. I mean, everyone must pay respects to Mr. Choi.
01:07:51.740 - 01:08:02.572, Speaker A: Last question. Yuga Labs recently passed an approval with Arbitrum to launch your own chain. I guess. Yeah, thoughts on that. And then thoughts on the future of kudgies, where it's going to go.
01:08:02.676 - 01:08:45.167, Speaker B: I think it's a great move for them, it's a great move for holders, It's a great move for that community. The benefit of building a chain when you have an NFT ecosystem is you need to capture the upside of what you're creating, which I think NFTs are going to be the ones. And I've already seen this. Just look at gas fees when NFTs popped off on Ethereum. I think NFTs are the mass market product for crypto. I think it is that. And when you create and get people excited about crypto and you bring people into crypto and you're an nft, the upside really goes to the chains who are capturing all of that value long term.
01:08:45.167 - 01:09:20.684, Speaker B: And I'm conscious of this and I'm not in the business of giving other people the upside, but I have to be focused and I have to win. And we have a long ways to go. But I am conscious that the upside at some point has to be the value capture of the demand that you're creating. If I'm just giving the value to every other ecosystem, I'm kind of shooting myself in the foot. And I think there's a lot of tooling and infrastructure. That Pudgy Pen was already built that could serve a slew of other communities. So we'll see.
01:09:20.684 - 01:09:29.148, Speaker B: But right now I'm very chronological. I have a battle to win and the battle is the face of NFTs and the face of Web3. Till I win that battle, nothing else matters.
01:09:29.244 - 01:09:34.124, Speaker C: My final question. When do you think you will win that battle? Meaning becoming number one.
01:09:34.212 - 01:09:49.628, Speaker B: I believe pudgy penguins will be the face of NFTs and the face of web3, hopefully by the quarter, probably by the summer. And no question, am I going into 2025, not the clear leader? Like, no chance, no shot.
01:09:49.724 - 01:09:54.220, Speaker C: When you say clear leader, you mean actually surpassing punks by 2025?
01:09:54.340 - 01:09:56.172, Speaker B: No question. No doubt in my mind.
01:09:56.276 - 01:09:57.036, Speaker A: Let's do it.
01:09:57.108 - 01:09:57.740, Speaker C: Love it.
01:09:57.860 - 01:10:13.782, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, Luca, thank you so much for your time. Great conversation. Learned a lot. And I'm sure the founders that are listening also did. Any final words for founders that are building the space? If they were to ask you one advice, what advice would you give them?
01:10:13.886 - 01:10:21.702, Speaker B: You are a servant to your community, whether you like it or not. Accept it. The sooner that you accept it, the better off you will be.
01:10:21.806 - 01:10:22.662, Speaker A: That's my advice.
01:10:22.726 - 01:10:23.302, Speaker C: Love it.
01:10:23.406 - 01:10:25.296, Speaker A: All right, thanks, Luca, for your time. Take care.
01:10:25.398 - 01:10:26.508, Speaker B: Thank you for your time.
01:10:26.644 - 01:10:53.726, Speaker A: That was great. I've learned a lot from Luca. Specifically, what stood out to me was his feedback on different collections, their different strengths and weaknesses. It helped me understand how to build, like, what Luca looked for when he was building the original brand of Pudgy Penguins. And it also. He's very open, like I thought. I mean, look, if you ask me what my favorite brand is and if I was the holder of Pudgy Penguins or the founder of Pudgy Penguins, you asked me, I would say not.
01:10:53.726 - 01:10:57.678, Speaker A: Nero Budgie Penguins is the only brand that I like.
01:10:57.814 - 01:10:58.366, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:10:58.478 - 01:11:06.094, Speaker A: But he was actually the opposite. And he was very open about different brands being great as well. So I like that about him.
01:11:06.182 - 01:11:09.582, Speaker C: And. And his bags are the same as ours. Yours and I's.
01:11:09.726 - 01:11:13.810, Speaker A: Yes. Which also helps the situation.
01:11:14.150 - 01:11:31.030, Speaker C: Yeah. Yeah. Jokes aside, the Matlabs and Tanzorians milk monkeys. It feels very good to have my bias confirmed by one of the NFT legends.
01:11:31.370 - 01:11:56.328, Speaker A: Yes. And he also talked about the different marketplaces like OpenSea and how OpenSea hasn't really been delivering listening to their customers. And there's a wide gap opense that is enabling Magic Eden to take share and blur. Right. Blur Magic Eden. And so I do think there's a small window of opportunity to open here for someone to take share and become pretty big here.
01:11:56.464 - 01:12:01.944, Speaker C: He's basically saying opensea prints so much money that they don't even care anymore.
01:12:02.072 - 01:12:02.696, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:12:02.808 - 01:12:05.400, Speaker C: Can they make even more money by launching a token?
01:12:05.480 - 01:12:07.032, Speaker A: They could do, yeah. Why not?
01:12:07.136 - 01:12:08.504, Speaker C: So why are they not doing it?
01:12:08.592 - 01:12:10.334, Speaker A: Principles is what I see.
01:12:10.472 - 01:12:10.962, Speaker C: Okay.
01:12:11.026 - 01:12:47.260, Speaker A: Regulatory Principles. I feel as if NFTs became very crypto native and moving where the hockey puck is going is something that I don't see. I don't, I haven't seen yet from OpenSea. And you have to move fast, right? And it could be a function of a big team, it could be a function of just, you know, where he finds his own insights. It's, it's hard to say, but yeah, I mean, I, I, I did email and Devin to come onto our podcast to help us think about his strategy. So we'll see what he says. What else he did talk about Bored Ape's app chain.
01:12:47.260 - 01:13:33.648, Speaker A: With the recent approval to launch your own chain on opportunity, he feels that it is a great opportunity and that's something that he could see himself doing right now. Excuse me, not right now, but in the future once he wins. And so I could see this similar to Axie Affinity and Ronin. And then I feel like a lot of NFT projects are thinking about the same thing, which is like Tensorians is an example or Tensor. They want to become a platform for developers to build on their ecosystem, right. Axie Infinity, they have this incredible ip, right? And this IP is used to create games and other things on Ronin, right? And Yuga Labs is doing the same thing, create their own chain and have other people build on their platform. And that world is very big.
01:13:33.648 - 01:14:07.922, Speaker A: Like just look at Pokemon, right? And so if you can build a pudgy Penguin that's worth a version of Pokemon Go or other types of products, that's huge. And so I do think that maybe I'm just guessing here is that that's probably where the world is going to go is like you have this platform where you're building these incredible IP games or products or apps, services that's under, and you own the chain and then you have, you know, and then you just start to become more and more Disney, like over time.
01:14:08.026 - 01:14:55.160, Speaker C: Yeah. I mean even, even on a broader point, basically pudgy Penguins and, and apes, what they're doing is, is app chain as a L2, right. And we talked about this more than over a year ago and I mean we saw this coming. There's just going to be a massive proliferation of L2s and app chains. Like today, basically any app that has some strong signs of product market fit or community market fit, which is the case of NFTs, is thinking about launching an app chain if they haven't already launched one. Right. So I think, you know, in, in two to three years there's just going to be Hundreds, if not thousands of app chains.
01:14:55.160 - 01:15:10.552, Speaker C: We're. We're actually seeing an acceleration of app chain rollups right now right in front of our eyes. And maybe the. The broader community doesn't see this because they're. They participate. The broader community participates in. In the public markets you and I participate in.
01:15:10.552 - 01:15:28.466, Speaker C: In the private market. And we see a lot of new things happening earlier than everyone else does. Right now, there is both an acceleration of new app chain L2s launching and existing apps turning into L2s.
01:15:28.578 - 01:15:30.194, Speaker A: Futures app chain, it seems.
01:15:30.322 - 01:15:50.348, Speaker C: Yeah. It's funny that I tried to tease the possibility of fungible token APUD token similar to the APE token, or maybe even similar to the Doge token. Right. But it sounds like he's not thinking about it. Did you hear the same thing as I. Yeah. Okay.
01:15:50.348 - 01:15:54.920, Speaker C: Okay. So he's really focusing on the full price of the NFTs rather than.
01:15:55.220 - 01:15:56.476, Speaker A: That's his North Star.
01:15:56.628 - 01:16:05.794, Speaker C: Yeah, that's his North Star. Rather than expanding the affordability of the Pudgy ip.
01:16:05.972 - 01:16:19.330, Speaker A: Yeah. So there's a balance. Right. So when Azuki launched Elementals, they did it at the wrong time. It was the wrong time. It was in the bear market, PvP and the floor price. They didn't win the floor price.
01:16:19.330 - 01:16:35.442, Speaker A: They were maybe second. No, sorry. Maybe second or third. And so he made this distinct, like, distinctive point, which is we're not. If we were to launch a collection, it's not going to be until we're number one. So that was an interesting learning for me.
01:16:35.546 - 01:16:44.674, Speaker C: Oh, and he said Pudgy's number one by 2025. Oh, my God, that's it. I thought I was very bullish on pudgies.
01:16:44.802 - 01:16:46.470, Speaker A: I'll never sell my pudgies.
01:16:46.890 - 01:17:10.134, Speaker C: He's even more aggressive than I am. Obviously, he's the founder of pudgies. He needs to be bullish. But if he really means what he said, I mean, it's. But the trend is pointing into that direction. In the last two months alone, Padres went from like 5 ETH to 20 ETH. So if this trend continues, I mean, flipping punks in summer or something.
01:17:10.222 - 01:17:28.000, Speaker A: This year he was also bullish. Two other things. Bitcoin ordinals. Like, he's calling it similar to Ethereum NFTs in the early days. And he also called out Layer 0, an omnichain as a way to bring IP across different chains. Those are two things I remember.
01:17:28.160 - 01:17:41.552, Speaker C: The rationale for being bullish on ordinals is the user experience is so painful and it's reminiscent of buying Ethereum NFTs before OpenSea. So it feels good. You felt that, Imran, you felt that.
01:17:41.576 - 01:17:42.300, Speaker A: I did.
01:17:43.320 - 01:17:45.456, Speaker C: I didn't bother going through the pain.
01:17:45.568 - 01:17:47.792, Speaker A: It was such a pain.
01:17:47.936 - 01:18:19.828, Speaker C: But it's like going from. Okay, so the analogy is Solana is broadband and Ethereum is something else. And Bitcoin is. And then Bitcoin is 100% dial up. I didn't bother going back to dial up, so I didn't want to go through the pain. There is a broader point here, which is historically, in crypto, a lot of the alphas do come from operational pain. This was true in the early days of Bitcoin.
01:18:19.828 - 01:18:51.636, Speaker C: So when you wanted to buy Bitcoin in early days in 2012, 2013, you had to go through extremely laborious process of wiring money to this unknown bank in Japan, which just looks like a total scam, and then buy stuff there and the wiring takes forever later. In 2024, 2025, you had an opportunity to buy Monero, but the Monero wallet was so painful to set up. It's very janky. It was in the early days, but you could have bought it and put it into your own wallet.
01:18:51.748 - 01:18:56.420, Speaker A: I did that with Stellar. Yeah, that was a lot of these.
01:18:56.460 - 01:19:16.864, Speaker C: New coins in the early days. Their wallet infra was just not retail friendly. And so it was an opportunity for the somewhat technical savvy people to get exposure earlier than everyone else. And the same thing happened to early Ethereum NFTs and currently possibly with ordinals.
01:19:16.992 - 01:19:35.698, Speaker A: I'm excited. I'm excited about ordinals. Another cool fact I learned was that if he was to launch a collection today, it's likely to be an ERC or DN404 standard. I should have asked more deeper questions around that. But he did say it's likely that he would launch it on those types of forms.
01:19:35.824 - 01:20:00.302, Speaker C: I mean, overall, he just sounds very optimistic about all sorts of experiments in crypto. Like he's bullish on NFTFI, NFT lending 404, even Yuga Labs. He speaks highly of Yuga Labs, his main competitor. And he's bullish on basically all the blue chips on Solana, on Ordinals and on Ethereum. He seems like a pretty optimistic guy.
01:20:00.446 - 01:20:18.238, Speaker A: Yeah, we need more optimism or. Well, sorry. We need more optimistic people and builders in the space. Not optimism, sorry. Oh, Nvidia just boost their earnings.
01:20:18.334 - 01:20:19.054, Speaker C: Oh, shit.
01:20:19.182 - 01:20:34.110, Speaker A: 22 billion. Well, I mean, I just got the news. Nvidia says generative AI has hit tipping point. Nvidia 4th quarter rev 22.1 billion estimated 20.4 billion.
01:20:34.410 - 01:20:35.346, Speaker C: So it beat.
01:20:35.458 - 01:20:45.190, Speaker A: It beat. So I guess we're going back up. Guys, it was a lot of fud around. Jeff Bezos, Zuckerberg and Bill Gates all selling their shit coins.
01:20:45.690 - 01:20:47.362, Speaker C: Yeah, it makes me nervous.
01:20:47.506 - 01:20:51.106, Speaker A: They do this all the time. It's so annoying. It makes me nervous, too.
01:20:51.258 - 01:20:54.690, Speaker C: Like, Jeff Bezos, I mean, sold $8.
01:20:54.730 - 01:20:56.230, Speaker A: Billion worth of stock.
01:20:56.570 - 01:21:03.122, Speaker C: Okay, look, I can make a case for Jeff Bezos. He might be selling his shares to fund Blue Origin.
01:21:03.266 - 01:21:04.818, Speaker A: I was hoping that was the case.
01:21:04.954 - 01:21:09.810, Speaker C: And Elon Musk might be selling his shares to fund some random new shit that he wants to build.
01:21:09.930 - 01:21:10.834, Speaker A: So who sold?
01:21:10.962 - 01:21:12.818, Speaker C: Zuckerberg has no reason to sell.
01:21:12.954 - 01:21:14.786, Speaker A: Yeah, how much did he sell? Do you remember?
01:21:14.898 - 01:21:16.322, Speaker C: I don't know, but some big number.
