00:00:00.160 - 00:00:06.358, Speaker A: It's interesting because I wouldn't say most, but I'd say there's a huge subset of developers that are on Ethereum, and they'll never go to another chain.
00:00:06.446 - 00:00:16.814, Speaker B: I think that's right. But I think the number one reason is actually solidity is very different from move, whereas it's much easier for a Solana dev to move to apples and sui.
00:00:16.894 - 00:00:18.966, Speaker A: Huh. So there's like, switching costs, right?
00:00:19.070 - 00:00:19.974, Speaker B: Switching costs, yeah.
00:00:20.054 - 00:00:44.534, Speaker A: I also think it's because back in 2015, 2014, well, when Ethereum launched, let's say, 2016, more or less, back then, people used to shit on smart contracts, especially the bitcoin community. And I felt like the Ethereum community had to harden. Right. And become this, like, very strong cult or community that will fight back against everyone that didn't believe in a smart contract world.
