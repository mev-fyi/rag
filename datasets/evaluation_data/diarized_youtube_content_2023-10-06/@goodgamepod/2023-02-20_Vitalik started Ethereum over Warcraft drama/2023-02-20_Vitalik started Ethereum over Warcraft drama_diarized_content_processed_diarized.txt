00:00:00.200 - 00:00:47.654, Speaker A: I think gaming NFTs in general just makes a lot of sense. It was the entire reason why Vitalik started Ethereum. By the way, Vitalik used to play World of Warcraft, and one day he noticed that one of his favorite characters got weakened by Blizzard, the developer of the game. And that's when he realized the danger of centralization. And at least that was his version of the genesis story of Ethereum. And so it makes sense to turn those in game assets in World of Warcraft into nfts that the game developer has no way to really affect. Obviously, it's much harder than that, because the game developers can potentially do other things to the nfTs, right? Like they can change the entire game loop in a way that basically the older nfts become less relevant in the new game loop.
00:00:47.654 - 00:00:54.294, Speaker A: But at least that's the hope. That's the promise of turning in game items into nfts that the users truly own.
