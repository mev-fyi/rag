00:00:00.320 - 00:00:38.842, Speaker A: Sometimes people say, like, DAos are like corporations. Actually, I think DAos are way more than corporations. Like, the fundamental difference between DAos and corporations is that when a corporation owns some assets, do they really own the assets? Like, who guarantees their property rights? It's the broader legal system, right? Their ownership of those assets is guaranteed by the social consensus of an entire country. Whereas if you're a dow and you own some assets, you truly own those assets. On chain, you actually have full ownership. Your property rights are not ultimately guaranteed by an entire country. Your property rights are fully on chain.
00:00:38.842 - 00:00:57.914, Speaker A: They're guaranteed by the consensus of the chain itself. So the key difference between DAos and corporations is property rights. And with property rights, truly native property rights, you can build digital nations. So that's how I think about this whole analog or concept behind PFTs as digital nations.
