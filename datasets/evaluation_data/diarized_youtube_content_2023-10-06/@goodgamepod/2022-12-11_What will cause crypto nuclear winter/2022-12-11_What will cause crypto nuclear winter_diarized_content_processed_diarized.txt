00:00:00.160 - 00:00:25.046, Speaker A: The other day I was thinking about this, and there are only two things that I can think of that if they fall, it's going to be much worse than the things currently are. And those two things are, number one, the collapse of a major stablecoin. And by the way, I don't see any evidence of that. And the second thing is the collapse of a major crypto bank. A bank that banks crypto startups. If the bank runs into a bank run, then it's nuclear. Winner.
00:00:25.046 - 00:00:30.334, Speaker A: All the startups are fucked. By the way, there's no evidence. I haven't seen any evidence of that either. Just to be clear.
