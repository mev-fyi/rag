00:00:00.120 - 00:00:22.990, Speaker A: Taproot went live and basically nothing happened. If you look at the graph, nothing happened like taproot adoption was, I don't know, below 1% or something like that for a while. It's been live for almost a year or more, and then ordinals comes around like it's basically skyrocketing. The taproot adoption is skyrocketing. People are scrambling. Wallets are scrambling. Other services are scrambling to actually integrate taproot.
00:00:22.990 - 00:00:51.314, Speaker A: I'll tell you about two companies in the SaCs ecosystem. One is exworze. It's a mobile wallet that released a web extension, involved those people weren't sleeping, they saw so much demand, and they upgraded to taproot, like in their wallet with Ardnell's encryption support. So now imagine that a web wallet actually has a reason to integrate with tap. When initially I was trying to use Ardnals, I realized even electrum, the OG wallet, didn't support tap, or at least my version doesn't.
