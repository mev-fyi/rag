00:00:00.400 - 00:00:04.085, Speaker A: Welcome to Goodgame. Your no BS insights for crypto founders.
00:00:08.025 - 00:00:29.583, Speaker B: I think we as an industry were on the verge of finding some really cool use cases that could go mainstream. So payment is already mainstream. Cross border payment. Socialfi feels like it's next. Like if you think about Pump. Pump fun. Like people think of Pump as a meme coin launchpad, but there's a lot of social component going on on Pump.
00:00:29.583 - 00:00:33.319, Speaker B: I think we're close, we're very close for social fact to go mainstream.
00:00:33.407 - 00:00:36.335, Speaker A: I agree. Looking for your next startup idea in crypto?

00:00:38.103 - 00:01:04.983, Speaker A: And get inspired at Alliance XYZ Ideas. Welcome to goodgame. This week, at least last week, a lot has happened, right? You had fantasy that launched it, finished its first tournament. There's been a lot of interesting feedback there. Fronttech did the airdrop. So there's some interesting dynamics that happen pretty early on which we could talk about. I'd say it was far con.
00:01:04.983 - 00:01:37.117, Speaker A: Oh, farcon. Yeah. And I saw some interesting tweets around that. Yeah, it seems like a lot of the more trendier stuff is all on socialfi. And so I'm excited to dig deeper as to what's going on here and explore what are some of the up and coming trends. Because even if you think about our hackathon that we launched a week ago, a lot of the applicants that are coming in are more leaning social, which I thought was an interesting signal for us. So yeah, I'd love to kind of dig deeper and explore.
00:01:37.117 - 00:01:39.317, Speaker A: What do you think of the frontec drop?
00:01:39.461 - 00:02:17.897, Speaker B: The frontech drop is the most egalitarian thing and if it works, it will reshape the fabric of our society. But it was good. It was okay. So the most interesting thing I found about friend tech is the airdrop. Not the product itself, not the group chat itself, the club thing. Okay, so for those who don't know, the airdrop is given to all the users who collected points from the V1 and 0% of that went to the team and the investors. So there's no insider allocation.
00:02:17.897 - 00:02:19.737, Speaker B: And I found this to be very interesting.
00:02:19.881 - 00:02:21.725, Speaker A: Is this the greatest thing since bitcoin?
00:02:22.745 - 00:02:23.885, Speaker B: Since yarn?
00:02:24.985 - 00:02:30.921, Speaker A: To be pedantic, Yeah, I was joking about bitcoin, but yarn, yeah, you're right.
00:02:31.033 - 00:03:19.745, Speaker B: So the reason why I think this is a very interesting experiment is because it's the polar opposite of the current paradigm, which is 50% going to the insiders and the rest, I mean, actually maybe usually 10, 20% goes to airdrop farmers, 50% goes to the insiders and Maybe the remaining goes to the quote, unquote, treasury like marketing budget, all that stuff. So the result of the current paradigm is the vast majority of good projects when they launch tokens, the float is very low, the supply overhang is very high. And after years of playing this game, the community has figured this out. The community knows that this is bad. They're getting dumped on. So fronttech Airdrop is doing the opposite. And I think there should be more experiments, more projects doing that experiment.
00:03:19.865 - 00:03:58.267, Speaker A: But you know, it's. There's another wedge that fronttech has that no other token has, in my opinion, which is the pure utility of the token. Not only has it airdropped, 100% or 90% of the tokens have been airdropped, 10% is being used as a reward to provide liquidity for Zelpool. 10% which gets allocated over. Over a period of 12 months. And in fact, not only that, but all the swaps are conducted within the dex, the fees part of the fees flow back to people that are staking or providing liquidity. Sorry, so there's two streams of revenue if you were to lp.
00:03:58.267 - 00:04:12.767, Speaker A: One is fees earned based on the swaps that are conducted on its own dex. And because it's its own dex, it can control the fee generation model as well. Right, and so what are the two streams?
00:04:12.791 - 00:04:14.063, Speaker B: One is the fees. And what's the other one?
00:04:14.079 - 00:04:27.375, Speaker A: And one is the FrontTech airdrop, the token itself. Because of the 100% tokens that FrontTech has, 90% airdrop, 10% is left in its treasury. That 10% is being allocated to people that are providing liquidity for the LP pool.
00:04:27.455 - 00:04:29.175, Speaker B: Oh, okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:04:29.335 - 00:04:31.017, Speaker A: So two streams of revenue.
00:04:31.191 - 00:04:37.709, Speaker B: But the other thing is you must use the friend token to buy clubs, to buy into clubs.
00:04:37.837 - 00:05:00.473, Speaker A: And that's the other thing. Right, which is. That's another sync for the front tech, the token itself. So not only is there utility whereby you stake or you use a token to buy into the clubs, but then it also is a liquidity sync for the token itself. And so far, from what I read, I think about two to two and a half million frontech tokens are. Are allocated to clubs.
00:05:00.569 - 00:05:06.369, Speaker B: Out of seven out of 70, right? 70 million, I believe.
00:05:06.457 - 00:05:30.663, Speaker A: So I can take a quick look and check that out. But I think of the circulate. Let's see, a total circulating supply is 91 million. Oh, sorry. So total supply is 91 million. So I'm assuming that's not accounting for the, the tokens that are held because it also says circle I think Coingecko might be. Let me see a second here.
00:05:30.663 - 00:05:49.295, Speaker A: All right, here we go. Yeah, I think the numbers are off right now. I'll have to check ether scan. So let's just hypothetically say that if there's 90 million tokens they're circulating, there's 10 million that are still in its treasury. That 10 million will eventually be airdropped to people that are providing liquidity to the pool.
00:05:49.415 - 00:05:51.715, Speaker B: So I mean, the biggest problem.
00:05:52.415 - 00:06:02.751, Speaker A: Yeah, most tokens have no utility outside of governance. Right. In this case, there's actual utility of the token. There's something happening.
00:06:02.823 - 00:06:43.123, Speaker B: Yeah. The biggest problem they need to solve is addressing the potential conflict interest between the equity holders and the token holders because they're not aligned. In a typical token project, the equity holders are also token holders, like AKA insiders. But in this case, in the Frantic case, the Frontec team and Paradigm are the equity holders, but they don't have the token. So there's going to be some conflict of interest. In the Frantic case, the insiders so far have accrued value from the revenue that are generated from the trading of the keys and they generated what, like 40 million?
00:06:43.219 - 00:06:47.055, Speaker A: 40 million, 40, 50 million, something like that that I saw on Twitter.
00:06:47.875 - 00:06:58.227, Speaker B: So that's going to be a big problem in the medium to long term as far as the Frentech token is concerned. So I actually put this tweet out and that pissed off a lot of people.
00:06:58.331 - 00:06:58.851, Speaker A: Okay.
00:06:58.963 - 00:07:29.165, Speaker B: But I said, so there a lot of people are saying FriendTech token is extremely, extremely undervalued at 200 million FTV. By the way, I think the Friend Tech token is undervalued, but I don't think it's that obvious, it's not that extreme. And the reason I put out there was because the Frante token is actually not a typical token in a sense that the Franti token is actually, you can think of it as the community or the airdrop farmer portion of the total supply.
00:07:29.325 - 00:07:31.933, Speaker A: So where does the rest of the tokens come from?
00:07:32.069 - 00:07:50.453, Speaker B: Exactly. So one way that the FriendTech team can do this is to launch another token, a second token, whereby the community portion of the second token is airdropped one to one to the holders of the current token. And the second token also has the insider allocation.
00:07:50.589 - 00:07:53.149, Speaker A: So that could be the governance token then. Yeah.
00:07:53.197 - 00:07:58.909, Speaker B: And it can still retain all the liquidity, all the utility that's baked into the first token.
00:07:59.037 - 00:08:10.535, Speaker A: But I mean, obviously there's going to be a fragmentation of liquidity. So. Right. In that when you look at people that hold either or token, they'll have to think about which token they want to hold actually.
00:08:10.835 - 00:08:16.835, Speaker B: Oh, if they launch the second token and it's airdropped to the 1 to 1 to the first token, then the first token will be worth zero.
00:08:16.955 - 00:08:17.379, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:08:17.427 - 00:08:32.021, Speaker B: Yeah. All the value. Like just by sheer social consensus, the value will accrue to the second one. Essentially it's a token migration. Like remember AAVE did this back in the day. AAVE did it, Polygon did this. Or even Tensor.
00:08:32.021 - 00:08:53.955, Speaker B: Tensor is another good example. So the tensorian NFT, you can consider that as analogous to the FriendTech token. Right. And then the tensor token, which was later airdropped to the tensorians, you can consider that as analogous to a potential second version of the frantat token.
00:08:54.085 - 00:09:15.159, Speaker A: I think you're right. I also think frontech, the token will lose its value if the second token was to come out, but it will still be a utility token. And I consider this similar to Smooth Love Potion by Axie Because SLPs. Is it SLP? Yeah, SLP token was a token that you would use to breed and earn.
00:09:15.287 - 00:09:20.295, Speaker B: Oh yeah. So that was essentially a meme coin with some utility.
00:09:20.375 - 00:09:37.477, Speaker A: Yeah. And when that first launched, everyone bought into that, if you remember. And I think it went up to. Yeah, it went up to 34 cents. So the market cap equivalent of that would be. Yeah, like 285, 300 million up to. And then it came crashing down.
00:09:37.621 - 00:09:40.585, Speaker B: It crashed after they launched the axs.
00:09:41.805 - 00:10:00.479, Speaker A: When did AXS token launch? Yeah, I'm not sure exactly. November 2020. It launched. So that was way before. Yeah. Cause this, the increase happened August of 2021, so about a year after. So a year before AXS launched.
00:10:00.479 - 00:10:34.471, Speaker A: I think back then it wasn't as clear how S SLP was going to play, but everyone needed SLP to breed from what I remember. So that was like the main utility of slp. So in our case, in the frontech case, frontech is still needed to buy into the clubs no matter what. So if you want to get into, I don't know, let's say Ansem's Club or the Fight Club, there's a bunch of clubs that are active right now. If you want to get into any of those, you'll need to have front tech. So I think frontech, the token will have utility. But I think if this governance token was to launch, I think the liquidity will migrate there.
00:10:34.623 - 00:10:47.879, Speaker B: I think the governance token, if they launch the governance token, the V2 of the token, it would be worth like 5x. Yeah, that's my rough estimate because actually AXS is about 10x SLP.
00:10:47.967 - 00:10:48.431, Speaker A: Is it?
00:10:48.503 - 00:10:59.023, Speaker B: Okay, so that's another way to view the relationship between this meme coin and the governance coin. And also the friend token. You cannot buy anywhere else.
00:10:59.159 - 00:11:13.291, Speaker A: You cannot buy anywhere else. You have to use bunny swap, which is the dex. And I tried to transfer out my friend tech token to other wallets. It wouldn't let me do it. So it's like confined. I'm not sure how. I don't know how it works technically, or maybe I was doing something wrong.
00:11:13.291 - 00:11:36.435, Speaker A: But I did try it three different occasions and it wouldn't let me. So if I had to put this into perspective, I think the front tech token or the frontech is a closed ecosystem. You can't trade this token anywhere else. You have to use it within the decks. All the dex accrues the value and anyone that is LPing will accrue some of that value back.
00:11:36.595 - 00:11:48.311, Speaker B: Everything is because there's. There's four centralized exchanges that listed Friend, BingX, xt.com, ascendX and BitMart.
00:11:48.463 - 00:11:49.275, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:11:49.935 - 00:11:52.967, Speaker B: Which would mean that the token can go out of the system.
00:11:53.111 - 00:12:00.839, Speaker A: Okay, maybe this was also like the day of. So maybe it changed. I'm not sure. I tried. Let me try again.
00:12:00.967 - 00:12:22.199, Speaker B: I think the point being, if FriendTech actually launched a token as projects normally would, I think it will be worth about a billion, like plus or minus 50% or whatever. But that's my fair value valuation of the friend token. If it was a normal token, a.
00:12:22.207 - 00:12:48.885, Speaker A: Normal governance token, this transaction is likely to fail. When I try to send the Frontech token outside of using MetaMask, I can't send it out. So I'm not sure something's going on there. Maybe it's just my own experience, but I thought that was interesting. Yeah, I'm not sure it's interesting. So within fronttech in itself, there's some new behavior that's taking place. And maybe we could Talk about what FrontTech is allowing you to do.
00:12:48.885 - 00:13:02.753, Speaker A: One is FrontTech enables you to create clubs. Anyone can create a club. There's two bonding curves that you can select from. One is standard, which isn't exponential, so the price doesn't move up as much, which creates a more open group.
00:13:02.809 - 00:13:05.793, Speaker B: So that was one of the biggest complaints about the V1.
00:13:05.889 - 00:13:12.385, Speaker A: Yeah, two is there's another bonding curve that's exponential. So you could have, you know, very limited groups.
00:13:12.465 - 00:13:13.617, Speaker B: That's V1 basically.
00:13:13.721 - 00:13:38.303, Speaker A: That's V1 basically. And then once you create the group, you have the ability to buy the club key yourself. Once you buy it, it opens up to everyone else and anyone else can buy into it. And so I'm seeing a ton, a ton of groups being created. Activity has been primarily limited in terms of what people are doing with the within the group chats itself. Some are lit up every day, most aren't. And so I'm just keeping an eye on, like, where have you tried to.
00:13:38.319 - 00:13:39.191, Speaker B: Create a group yet?
00:13:39.303 - 00:13:40.055, Speaker A: I did it.
00:13:40.175 - 00:13:52.035, Speaker B: Okay, so Will created a group this morning. Will. Will rob Mr. On our team. And within 10 seconds, about 30 bots. 30 bots just sniped the keys.
00:13:52.175 - 00:14:12.335, Speaker A: Yeah, it's like V1 all over again. As soon as you launch your key, you'll get a bunch of snipers that come in and buy up the keys. So the groups I'm in right now, we can just go through a quick list. One is called Fight Club that was launched by Racer. That's an exponential price curve and some zarmi.
00:14:13.035 - 00:14:14.295, Speaker B: What are they fighting?
00:14:14.595 - 00:14:41.879, Speaker A: Fight Club? I think they're just talking about looking through it. People are just talking about friend tech, you know, they're talking about the different groups that are available. How can club creators earn more revenue from a successful club? Things like that. Someone said, I love you, Racer. There's a lot of simps for Racer, by the way. I'm in the Remilio Group chat. I'm in the Retardio Friends Group chat, Hero Club, CBB, the Cabal, Frontech Pirates, Cyi Club.
00:14:42.007 - 00:14:49.623, Speaker B: So I mean the V2, the club thing, I mean, it's interesting, but to me it's not a step function improvement over the V1.
00:14:49.719 - 00:14:50.839, Speaker A: Yes, you said that.
00:14:51.007 - 00:15:07.495, Speaker B: The reason is the group leaders in V2 in those clubs are the same people are the same influencers that are very valuable in the v1. So it's like almost 1 to 1. The social graph isn't very different from the v1 to v2.
00:15:07.615 - 00:15:57.437, Speaker A: The social graph isn't different. But I think what's different about this is that I see this as more analogous to like a Telegram group chat, WhatsApp group chat, Facebook groups. I'd say it's like in that, like, if there's different quadrants of like types of messaging, social apps, it would be under that quadrant, which I think is interesting because right now, like Telegram, if you join Telegram, like there's an admin that will like cut you out. Right. If you're in a WhatsApp group or a Telegram chat, someone can kick you out. In these, like in this chat, you aren't bound by social status per se, but more about economic status. Like can you buy into that key in that room and no one can kick you out? So I was just thinking through like different interesting use cases and you know, things like Silk Road came to mind.
00:15:57.437 - 00:16:05.959, Speaker A: Right. Like if people wanted to create a group chat to buy and sell drugs. I'm not saying this, I'm not telling people to do this, but people could do this, right?
00:16:06.047 - 00:16:08.875, Speaker B: Someone's going to do it. This stream right after this podcast.
00:16:10.535 - 00:16:26.155, Speaker A: I'm not advocating for this, but I'm just kind of giving you like an interesting behavior that could have come to this. Right? Like if you want to do, I don't know, peer to peer bitcoin purchases. I don't know, I'm just throwing out different ideas where you. It's like unregulated.
00:16:26.615 - 00:16:30.625, Speaker B: Don't you think this club thing should be implemented on ton with Telegram?
00:16:30.735 - 00:16:30.957, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:16:30.981 - 00:16:32.345, Speaker B: Isn't that more natural?
00:16:32.645 - 00:16:58.063, Speaker A: It's more natural, but I think from a product perspective, it is probably harder to like undo what the. Like you almost have to create a completely different product set unless or migrate Telegram chats to this new type of schema. Right. Or create a net new product that enables people to do this. Also, like introducing Telegram. Like, yeah, like, I don't know, it seems like a whole different product.
00:16:58.229 - 00:17:00.867, Speaker B: I just feel that V1 has so much potential.
00:17:01.011 - 00:17:04.083, Speaker A: I don't think V1's going anywhere. V1 is still being used.
00:17:04.219 - 00:17:17.587, Speaker B: Yeah, but if I were Racer, I would scale the V1. I would put all my resources into building a very normie friendly onboarding process.
00:17:17.731 - 00:17:55.289, Speaker A: I think the problem Racer got into was one, is that the product's already live. Two, is it's harder to edit or update the smart contracts because it's already out. And so everything that spun up moving forward is on an exponential price curve. So he almost has to create a completely new product and migrate that over, which I think is the idea behind clubs. Eventually the idea could be that if you want to talk to, let's say Chow Chow has a group chat and anyone can join in and anyone can chat. So I think that's his wedge to winning everyone over from the key side. But I'm not sure.
00:17:55.289 - 00:18:11.465, Speaker A: It's hard to say because you could also argue, and I've read this in Racer's chat, that key holders could eventually get some value back from the creators. I'm not sure how he's thinking about it, but he's threw out that idea before. He's thrown out that idea before. So it's still yet to be seen.
00:18:11.585 - 00:18:16.851, Speaker B: But I'm following, I'm following. I don't want to draw a conclusion too quickly.
00:18:16.993 - 00:18:37.519, Speaker A: Same. But I do like the, I mean, I mean I do think crypto based group chats are interesting. We just have to see where it goes, I think. Yeah, but I am, I am like actively following. I'm in group chats talking to people and we just have to see where it goes. So far can happen. Over the week we had a lot of founders that went to the event.
00:18:37.519 - 00:19:18.245, Speaker A: There was a lot of excitement around the event and there was also some disappointment, disappointing moments also which we could talk about. But what's clear is that the forecaster community is strong. One of the founders I spoke with said that every person that he spoke to was a builder in that space. There weren't any investors there or very limited investors were there, but it was mostly builders there. Which to me shows me that it is still contrarian, there's still opportunity there or other people just don't see the value. Right. Two is that a lot of the news that came out of the forecaster community has been really like Warpcast client focused, which kind of pissed off a few, you know, a few people on Twitter.
00:19:18.245 - 00:19:43.513, Speaker A: And three, you could just tell that, you know, there's a pretty strong, vibrant community overall, which keeps me excited about what's happening within Farcaster. There was a tweet that went out yesterday. I'll read this out to our audience. Ironically, this is by 0x designer. He has some really good tweets. But one tweet said ironically, leaving Farrakhan more bearish on Farcaster. The Protocol wants to compete and win at the client level.
00:19:43.513 - 00:20:02.765, Speaker A: Client wants to win and avoid being dependent on the Protocol. All roads leads to winner take all. What's the point? I replied back to a tweet. I said, this makes sense. No one has more skin in the game than the Forecast or Protocol team. Ultimately, it's up to the Warp Class client to onboard millions of users to the protocol. So the Protocol needs at least one client to succeed for the Protocol itself to succeed.
00:20:02.765 - 00:20:11.247, Speaker A: And to be frank, no external client has more skin in the game than Warpcast. If Warpcast can onboard billions, external clients can be built to meet their needs.
00:20:11.321 - 00:20:20.475, Speaker B: I don't understand the original criticism. Is he saying that because Warpcast is so successful, there's no motivation for other clients to compete?
00:20:20.595 - 00:21:08.727, Speaker A: What he's saying is that, yes, same vein. But he's also saying that a lot of the announcements, a lot of the product Upgrades are. Product development is around Warpcast, the client. But to me it makes a lot of sense, right? Which is you have a hero device or a hero product, and this hero product is what other clients should aspire to become and compete with. If you want like a high client, if you want a very high quality client, then you gotta have some sort of benchmark. Otherwise you'll have, you know, products that come out by, you know, from everyone that may not be of high quality, of high quality, of highest quality, that could ultimately burn users and then that could create a negative churn. So to me, it makes a lot of sense as to why Dan and team are focusing a lot on building a great client.
00:21:08.727 - 00:21:19.679, Speaker A: Because a great client will attract more users, which is great for the social graph within Forecaster. And once you have a very robust social graph, then people can build for those use cases.
00:21:19.807 - 00:21:47.255, Speaker B: Exactly. Because if you compare Warpcast with Lens, in hindsight, the Warpcast strategy was the more successful one, right? Like forecasting now probably has more, at least has more users and more discussion, more funding, more hype around it than Lens. Do you agree or no? I'm feeling that.
00:21:49.115 - 00:22:37.815, Speaker A: As of right now. You're right. But there's two different approaches, right? One is centralized to decentralized, one is decentralized to decentralize, right? And Dan is taking a curated approach as to building a very highly curated social graph, right? His I think his thesis is once you have a very strong social graph, then you could build, you know, and grow through a centralized client. Then you could grow the social graph and then you could build more apps, right? Whereas with Lens, Lens is more decentralized, which is like, all right, we're going to let everyone build, which is what's happening. But some clients are surfacing to the top. So I've been using orbs every other day now because that it started to come up in my Timeline feed and it's not a bad experience. The quality of the client is actually very, very good.
00:22:37.815 - 00:23:19.007, Speaker A: So the quality of client is good. The social graph is starting to build up. It seems to me it's more geared towards creators like musicians and in that kind of industry. And the really cool thing that I'm starting to see is that people are launching their own, like songs and music videos and you could tip them or you could mint it using Banzai. And the creator earns some money from that, right? So like I can post a song. So someone posted a song recently and he made like, I don't know, it was like 200 bucks, something like that. For just posting up a song and, you know, he thought it was very valuable.
00:23:19.007 - 00:23:40.765, Speaker A: He's a pretty popular musician, so he went on Twitter and talked about how great Lens is because he's earning a lot of money. I mean, 150 may not be a lot, but like, if you compare it to streams, it's pretty significant, right? Or like SoundCloud or YouTube or whatever for up and coming artists, that is. So I thought it was an interesting signal. So I'm following Orbs pretty closely now. The client itself is pretty nice.
00:23:40.895 - 00:23:51.281, Speaker B: I'm looking at a Dune dashboard. So Today Lens has 10,000 data active users and Forecaster has 50,000.
00:23:51.433 - 00:23:53.073, Speaker A: Big difference in terms of numbers.
00:23:53.209 - 00:23:59.249, Speaker B: However, just in January, Forecaster and Lens were about the same in terms of what?
00:23:59.337 - 00:24:09.489, Speaker A: Oh, in January, in terms of monthly active users. Daily active users, yeah. So it grew 5x, and in October, December.
00:24:09.577 - 00:24:18.785, Speaker B: Last year, Lens was 5x forecaster. So farcaster has grown a lot, whereas Lens has mostly stalled.
00:24:18.865 - 00:24:34.941, Speaker A: That's the approach, right? The decentralized versus centralized. Yeah, decentralized. You're allowing the clients, the protocol is trusting the client to go get its users and build its own social graph. Whereas Dan is like, no, no, no, we're going to do that ourselves. So it's two completely different approaches.
00:24:35.053 - 00:25:00.855, Speaker B: Like the fact that Webcast is so dominant compared to other Forecaster clients. I don't think it's an issue at all. I think it's. If anything, it's a good thing. Yeah, you want that, you want that. And I don't think it's fair to say no other clients will succeed and Warpcast will win everything, because that's just not possible. Just because Reddit is extremely dominant doesn't mean Twitter cannot succeed.
00:25:00.855 - 00:25:28.005, Speaker B: And vice versa. It's not possible to mesh dramatically different user experiences into one app. By definition, you're going to have to have quite a few clients in the long term. And the other thing is, Farcaster started as a social app, but I think there are signs of Farcaster or a social protocol, but there are signs of Forecast are becoming more and more of a financial protocol call with transaction frames.
00:25:28.045 - 00:25:29.085, Speaker A: You're talking about, right?
00:25:29.245 - 00:25:37.405, Speaker B: Frames and also other clients where you can conduct transactions. So for example, BountyCaster is one.
00:25:37.525 - 00:25:40.597, Speaker A: Yep. So that's what's Bounty Caster for our audience.
00:25:40.741 - 00:26:12.437, Speaker B: Bountycaster is you can post any bounty on the forecaster. So BountyCaster will have their client. And the idea is anyone can post a bounty on the Forecaster, a social graph, and anyone can take the bounty and do the work and get paid. So you can almost think of that as a crypto native LinkedIn sitting on top of the Forecaster social graph. So bouncing is one. Another One is minting NFTs within the frames. That has been happening for a few months now.
00:26:12.437 - 00:26:44.603, Speaker B: I'm sure there are startups that are funded that are doing that kind of stuff today. So Frames is actually a really good medium for minting NFTs and trading meme coins. Because the alternative, if you think about the alternative, the alternative is you see Ansem Shield as a meme point on Twitter and then you go to another app and ape. There's a lot of friction between going from Twitter and the financial app. Whereas if you do everything within Farcaster, it removes the friction going from the social into the trading.
00:26:44.749 - 00:27:23.273, Speaker A: So just building on what you said within, one of the major announcements within Farcon was the fact that they want to make more Legos within Farcaster or within. Yeah, within the Forecaster. So maybe transaction Frames is another one Lego. But I think to the point you're making about financialization of Forecaster makes sense because the more legos you build, the more differentiated clients can be built around it that can attract different types of use cases. And so you could go back to, you could go Back to like 2010 as an example, or earlier when Facebook launched the ability for open APIs where you could build on top of Facebook.
00:27:23.369 - 00:27:26.769, Speaker B: Yeah, Farmville on that stuff that shut down.
00:27:26.897 - 00:27:50.823, Speaker A: Farmville did incredibly well and they were growing very, very fast, but Facebook ended up cutting them out because they found it to be competitive. Right. If you look at what happened on Twitter in the early days is Twitter APIs were open and so there was different types of clients that were built for Twitter, if you remember this, back in the day. And Twitter ended up shutting them down because they wanted to focus on one client.
00:27:50.919 - 00:27:53.755, Speaker B: Or making it extremely expensive.
00:27:54.095 - 00:28:10.629, Speaker A: Or making it very expensive. Right. But now if you come back to what Forecaster is doing, Farcaster is like, well, we are a protocol first. Right. And so for us, we want a healthy client diversity. We want things to be built on it, we want to see games and et cetera. So I do think they're taking a different approach.
00:28:10.629 - 00:28:21.021, Speaker A: And it seems like the signals that we've seen in the past, like different diversity of clients or games being built on social media apps are going to become very, very popular and very, very big.
00:28:21.133 - 00:28:28.677, Speaker B: Like a year ago, I would have put Forecaster in the same category as Twitter. So I would have said Forecaster is competing with Twitter.
00:28:28.741 - 00:28:29.205, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:28:29.285 - 00:28:35.775, Speaker B: But today I think Farcaster is actually competing with Telegram and Ton. Yeah, if that makes sense.
00:28:35.855 - 00:28:37.015, Speaker A: That's a hundred percent.
00:28:37.175 - 00:29:04.887, Speaker B: In both cases you start off with a social app, which in turn turns into a financial app. So Ton is trying to do that with the Ton blockchain. Telegram is trying to do that with the Ton blockchain. There's a ton of mini apps built on top of the chain. And the Telegram app, the Telegram super app. So there's games, there's like swapping, there's lending, all that stuff and NFTs, all these things are very early, but they're happening today on Telegram. Forecaster is the same thing.
00:29:04.887 - 00:29:06.359, Speaker B: Social turn into finance.
00:29:06.447 - 00:29:34.715, Speaker A: Yeah. And in fact we're seeing a lot of people that are building, you know, a front tech like experience on the, on Forecaster id. Right. Or fid. And so really what Forecaster has that's really, really valuable is the social graph and then also the fids, which is like the way. And what I mean by Forecaster ID is just the identity of the user that's stored on its protocol, which is where all the value, there's a lot of value in that. Right.
00:29:34.715 - 00:30:29.849, Speaker A: And so you could see a front tech experience on the Forecaster ecosystem easily. And so I do think there is some interesting. You're seeing frontech growing within base and then you're also seeing Forecaster kind of growing within the optimism ecosystem and there will be some convergence and then because you could totally see competition happening from that perspective as well. So during the Far con announcements we saw a ton of funding announcements. I saw maybe, I could count maybe three different clients that have been funded now and they're all clients are building on the far, far con ecosystem. I saw one specifically that was launched by Coupa. Cupa is a well known influencer on Twitter and he is more geared to like his, like a lot of his investments and a lot of his time is geared towards the music industry.
00:30:29.849 - 00:31:07.595, Speaker A: So he's building a music client that sits on top of Farcaster. Sorry, on top? Yeah, on top of our Castro. And the idea here is that they're going to launch a tipping token and the tipping token will be used to. So the client itself will only service musicians. Right. And the idea here is that musicians will post their, their, their music or whatever. And the tipping token, which is a music token, would be used to tip these artists and then gravitate or bring up or surface up the highest quality music content to people's feeds was the idea.
00:31:07.595 - 00:31:25.901, Speaker A: So, so we're starting to already see like client diversity for like musicians only timeline or for other types of verticals. But the idea of a tipping token or tipping is becoming more ingrained into the forecaster ecosystem.
00:31:26.013 - 00:31:28.053, Speaker B: Yeah, it started with Degen.
00:31:28.109 - 00:31:28.705, Speaker A: Basically.
00:31:29.645 - 00:32:06.705, Speaker B: Degen was, I think it was towards the end of last year where people started tipping each other with the Degen token, which back then was not really a token, it was not on chain, it was just some entry in their centralized database. But earlier this year, Degen became a token. But tipping was a really good way to distribute the DJEN token. The distribution is directly correlated with how much contribution you make as a user towards the network. Right. You make a good cast and then if people like your cast, they will tip you. So it's a very objective way to distribute the token.
00:32:07.015 - 00:32:07.995, Speaker A: It's positive.
00:32:10.535 - 00:32:18.263, Speaker B: Separately, that was one of the reasons, the distribution was one of the reasons why I think the Degen token really took off.
00:32:18.399 - 00:32:31.175, Speaker A: Well, it depends on how you see it, but I think partly it's also because there's nothing social to speculate on. And so a lot of people bought into Degen because.
00:32:31.255 - 00:32:34.521, Speaker B: Right, that's right. The timing was great.
00:32:34.633 - 00:32:35.897, Speaker A: The timing was great.
00:32:36.081 - 00:32:41.205, Speaker B: People thought of DJEN as the index bet on forecaster and base.
00:32:41.945 - 00:33:02.077, Speaker A: But outside of that, it did grow and I think it gave a model of what others can do. Right. And so we're starting to see tipping tokens for almost every channel now. Right. So like an example is MFers, they want to tip each other in MFR tokens within the channels. And you're seeing this with others like musicians with coupon, etc. Etc.
00:33:02.077 - 00:33:50.915, Speaker A: So I do think it's an interesting way to bootstrap community for those channels. But it's also a good way to bootstrap active users like surface of good content because people are willing to promote themselves more because they can earn something out of this. Right. So if I'm within the, say, the MFR channel, like I will promote more MFA related stuff, I will build stuff, hoping to get some tokens in return. And I think we're going to start to see that, which is why I think this is actually a. Which is a trend that I actually believe is going to continue on. If you think about this, there's 8 billion people that live in this world and a lot of them will find this as a way to bootstrap community in a way that they could earn for themselves, but then also kind of grow these channels specifically.
00:33:50.915 - 00:34:11.513, Speaker A: It's one of the reasons why Facebook groups does so well. I mean, there is no monetary value that they Earn. But they do this purely to help each other out. Right. So now if you add a speculative component to it, you know, I could see things churning really well. So I'll give you an example. One example is like, so my wife is part of a mom's group chat for Facebook.
00:34:11.513 - 00:34:36.047, Speaker A: So there's like 10,000 or 20,000 moms that are all out there. You ask a question, within seconds, you get 25 different answers. It's like very, very supportive group. That's global. Now, if you think about this from a perspective of different avenues all across the world, or different subjects all across the world, you could see this working really well, especially with the monetary component to it. So I thought that was just an interesting signal that wanted to surface up.
00:34:36.151 - 00:34:39.275, Speaker B: Was there talks about the base token at Farcon?
00:34:40.215 - 00:34:48.861, Speaker A: I think there was, but it seems like the answer has been no. No token for base, which is, I think, made a lot of people upset.
00:34:48.973 - 00:35:01.317, Speaker B: But it's not surprising. I mean, you have a SEC, FINRA, regulated public company at a market cap of $50 billion. You don't expect them to launch a token.
00:35:01.461 - 00:35:18.513, Speaker A: I also think that it works for base. Invisible carrot that's there keeps people highly in tune to what's happening within the base ecosystem. And it works in several ways. One is like, people will still want to farm it. Even if people say no, there will be a token. Right. Someday.
00:35:18.513 - 00:35:45.383, Speaker A: Two is the speculative capital rolls into other tokens in the search for the same upside of what you would have with base. So it went to Degen. Now it's going to go into friend or friend tech. They'll go into these other types of products that will look for that base exposure and kind of give it that growth that's needed. So I do feel like there's some positives in this by not releasing a token right away. Do you see the same thing?
00:35:45.479 - 00:35:46.335, Speaker B: I agree with you.
00:35:46.455 - 00:35:47.155, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:35:47.575 - 00:35:49.215, Speaker B: I don't ever see a token.
00:35:49.335 - 00:35:51.591, Speaker A: Oh, so you're saying no token whatsoever?
00:35:51.703 - 00:35:59.503, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm seeing no token whatsoever. But I can see why people would. Even knowing that the chances are very low they would still want to farm it.
00:35:59.639 - 00:36:16.377, Speaker A: I think farmers are farmers. They will. I think that people that have already farmed it, they farmed it. I think they're done. They're moving on to other things now. But in the early stages at least, I saw this to be a very, very strong signal for farmers. Okay, so there's two other things, right.
00:36:16.377 - 00:36:22.353, Speaker A: CMS talked about why liquid opportunity is the future. Do you remember that thread, Chao? Yeah.
00:36:22.369 - 00:36:25.361, Speaker B: I didn't Read the details. Okay, but I agree.
00:36:25.553 - 00:36:33.435, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I do. So there's that. There's also. Ionet lost 75% of its GPUs.
00:36:33.595 - 00:36:34.531, Speaker B: Wait, what happened?
00:36:34.643 - 00:36:35.523, Speaker A: Ionet?
00:36:35.619 - 00:36:37.331, Speaker B: No, but what happened? What caused it?
00:36:37.443 - 00:36:38.295, Speaker A: Martin.
00:36:38.915 - 00:36:43.963, Speaker B: Oh, Martin flooded it. And then people just took their GPUs off.
00:36:44.059 - 00:37:06.645, Speaker A: Yeah, and a lot of it is also bullshit too, right? Because they supposedly had 500,000 GPUs, and it turns out they had, from what Martin said, maybe 20,000. And I think the rest then got scared and then they fleeced because the token isn't valuable anymore because they were supposed to have a Binance listing and.
00:37:07.905 - 00:37:10.697, Speaker B: Yeah, and then Martin fudded it the day before.
00:37:10.841 - 00:37:30.505, Speaker A: Yeah, Martin fudded it to the point where if he was shady, I'm glad Martin did that, because a scam artist. I mean, like, if he was a scam, I'm not sure. I haven't looked into it in detail. So I'm not going to say if he's a scam artist or not, but if he was, then I think Martin did the right thing by calling him out.
00:37:30.965 - 00:37:47.063, Speaker B: Here's the. Like, I don't know anything about the founders, whether or not they're criminals or shady or whatever, but there is a very interesting tweet from Suhail, who's so. Hell, he's not a crypto Guy, he's a Web2Guy, the founder, Mixpanel.
00:37:47.189 - 00:37:48.147, Speaker A: Okay, got it.
00:37:48.251 - 00:38:28.795, Speaker B: Das Suhail. He said his tweet reads, August 2023. Impossible to find a cluster of even 2056 A1 hundreds May 2024 can find 512 H1 hundreds with next week delivery. So H100 is the state of the art GPU for AI training. And basically he's saying that those state of the art GPUs were in shortage last year, half a year ago, or actually nine months ago, and today they're in abundance. And. Well, my immediate reaction is this is kind of bearish for Nvidia.
00:38:28.795 - 00:39:08.273, Speaker B: So H1 100 is Nvidia GPUs, and it seems like the supply is now outpacing demand, at least compared to a year ago. So this somewhat bearish Nvidia. But my second thought was Ionette, because one of the thought points that Martin put out about Ionet was there weren't actually many H1 hundreds, meaning most of the GPUs on Ionet were just mediocre average GPUs that are not used for AI training, just the kind of stuff that the average person has access to and is in abundance. But today people can get H100 very easily.
00:39:08.369 - 00:39:09.805, Speaker A: So where are you going to get with this?
00:39:10.425 - 00:39:32.889, Speaker B: That's, number one, kind of bearish for Nvidia, and number two, kind of bearish for the whole decentralized GPUs. Because the whole point of decentralized GPUs is that those GPUs are in shortage. You can't find them, so you contribute them to the network so that others can rent it. But today, even the state of the art GPUs are no longer in shortage.
00:39:33.057 - 00:39:51.445, Speaker A: I'm surprised that people aren't like farming. Obviously, you could see a speculative component where people would just farm these protocols. Right. If those that want to buy into this crypto AI thesis, those buy a bunch of H1 hundreds and then start GP or start farming these protocols.
00:39:52.145 - 00:40:09.657, Speaker B: Well, but that was the problem. That has been the problem a year ago, where the H1 hundreds, now, a year, half a year ago, where the H1 hundreds were actually in shortage. So you couldn't even buy them even if you wanted to farm those GPU networks. Decentralized GPU networks, you couldn't even find them. You can't even find that H1 hundreds.
00:40:09.761 - 00:40:24.513, Speaker A: So what does that mean for crypto AI? And then, you know, these are like pendulums. Right. And so let me add another point. Stanley Druck, he ended up selling. He mentioned it, I think, a month ago, where he sold Nvidia.
00:40:24.609 - 00:40:26.485, Speaker B: I think that was rumors. That wasn't.
00:40:26.825 - 00:40:42.875, Speaker A: No, apparently someone tweeted that he was in the. Like Stanley was speaking to a group of people and the guy. So it's a rumor. Let's put as a rumor. But that's what happened. But I remember as soon as that tweet went out, it created waves. And yeah, I didn't.
00:40:42.875 - 00:40:47.575, Speaker A: I mean, Nvidia wasn't performing as well since then, so I'm not sure. I'm not sure, but I thought that was.
00:40:48.155 - 00:40:59.155, Speaker B: So I'm looking at the SEC filings of Druckenmiller's family office, and the latest filing is from February. So a quarter ago.
00:40:59.275 - 00:40:59.803, Speaker A: A quarter.
00:40:59.899 - 00:41:10.627, Speaker B: The latest one might come out soon. Yeah, but the last filing, Stanley Druckenmiller was, he was selling Nvidia stock, but buying Nvidia calls.
00:41:10.771 - 00:41:11.251, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:41:11.323 - 00:41:13.495, Speaker B: So I don't really understand this.
00:41:14.035 - 00:41:16.291, Speaker A: Maybe to capture whatever upside that's left.
00:41:16.443 - 00:41:17.175, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:41:18.515 - 00:41:28.331, Speaker A: Minimizing the downside would be the only reason why he would do that. Right. Just in case he's wrong. So. Interesting.
00:41:28.483 - 00:41:39.075, Speaker B: And also, if you combine that with what Zuckerberg said Last month, yes. He said GPUs were no longer the bottleneck. The bottleneck is now energy.
00:41:39.195 - 00:41:39.923, Speaker A: Energy, yeah.
00:41:40.019 - 00:42:19.473, Speaker B: So energy that's using those data centers for training AI, that is going to be the bottleneck that is going to be in shortage. Then there's another guy from Microsoft that went on Allot. The Allot podcast. He was the first hire of energy at Microsoft, and he said the same thing. He said that Microsoft is working with the utilities to build out more energy supply in order to help OpenAI, basically. So I think given all these data points, it does seem to be the. To be the case that GPUs are now in abundance.
00:42:19.649 - 00:42:23.633, Speaker A: Now, is this cyclical or is this a secular change?
00:42:23.769 - 00:42:28.697, Speaker B: I mean, according to Zach, it's probably more secular.
00:42:28.801 - 00:42:33.873, Speaker A: Yeah. If that's the case, then this is bearish, at least for the time being. It's bearish crypto AI.
00:42:33.929 - 00:42:36.441, Speaker B: Well, it's bearish. Decentralized gpu.
00:42:36.473 - 00:42:37.665, Speaker A: Decentralized gpu, sorry.
00:42:37.745 - 00:42:40.281, Speaker B: Because there's a lot of stuff going on in crypto.
00:42:40.313 - 00:42:40.951, Speaker A: That's what I meant.
00:42:41.033 - 00:42:51.491, Speaker B: Oh, by the way, so in all of AI crypto, I want to call out one project that I find really interesting, and that's the Mohammed Bayoumi's project. So he's one of our.
00:42:51.683 - 00:42:52.787, Speaker A: What is he building?
00:42:52.931 - 00:43:06.091, Speaker B: So he's building a edge AI. So what edge AI means is you can run AI models on your local device, such as your smartphone or your laptop.
00:43:06.203 - 00:43:08.805, Speaker A: So you can compute locally on your device.
00:43:08.885 - 00:43:41.367, Speaker B: Yeah, AI compute locally on our device. And where crypto comes in is not really cryptocurrency or crypto, it's cryptography. So he uses cryptography to encrypt the LLM models in such a way that the end user cannot steal them. Because imagine you're an LLM developer. You put the model locally, you send the model locally to the end user's smartphone. If it's not encrypted, the user can steal it and replicate it.
00:43:41.471 - 00:43:42.071, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:43:42.223 - 00:44:08.211, Speaker B: So now I don't understand in details how the tech works, but that is a real problem. The problem that this edge AI thing is solving is real. Because I remember a year ago when ChatGPT first came out, I built a bot using ChatGPT to analyze my telegram messages in order to prioritize them. And I quickly realized that, oh, shit, I'm actually sending information to OpenAI, and I shouldn't do that.
00:44:08.323 - 00:44:10.175, Speaker A: Yeah, because you're training the model, right?
00:44:10.835 - 00:44:27.397, Speaker B: Well, it's training the model, but also revealing confidential information to a third party. So I thought if I could use OpenAI locally, that'd be great. It's primarily a privacy concern.
00:44:27.531 - 00:44:57.087, Speaker A: So it's like having a secure enclave just for your LLM that's encrypted. And I could see a world where you'd want to monetize the LLM Right. And allow other people to use it via crypto. That could be a thing. Right. And what's also interesting is as you're feeding in information to OpenAI and other LLMs, you're obviously making it better. And so I could see data being useful for those that actually provide positive feedback loops for data.
00:44:57.087 - 00:45:18.023, Speaker A: Data. Right, yeah. So like professors and researchers, et cetera. So I could see a. An EARN component. I mean, obviously you have to analyze the data in such a way that we know it's high quality. If you could do that locally, then you can contribute to an LLM that allows people to monetize it and.
00:45:18.023 - 00:45:26.645, Speaker A: Yeah, sorry. And I wonder if there's a way where you could still allow others to use the LLM without having to reveal the LLM itself. I don't know. That could be interesting too.
00:45:26.765 - 00:45:38.973, Speaker B: Anyway, I wanted to call out this one because this is one of the very few AI crypto projects that I feel is solving a hair on fire problem today. And if it works, it could reshape the fabric of our society.
00:45:39.149 - 00:46:08.641, Speaker A: All right, so we have front tech that can reshape the fabric of our society. We have fantasy that could reshape the fantasy of our fabric of our society. And now we have AI or edge AI. This is exciting. I think this is. Of all the AI projects that I've heard about, nothing really like GPU clusters. Decentralized GPU clusters was okay, interesting, but I don't know, I didn't really find it to be that fascinating.
00:46:08.833 - 00:46:17.191, Speaker B: I find it extremely fascinating. But also at the same time, Fuda on our team, he pointed out 10 reasons why it wouldn't work.
00:46:17.313 - 00:46:18.971, Speaker A: Oh, latency. Right. Was one.
00:46:19.003 - 00:46:36.259, Speaker B: Latency was a big one. We argued when you train a huge model, you want to use a ton of GPUs, but if these GPUs are distributed around the world, how do you solve the latency problem? How do you orchestrate GPUs that are not in the same data center? That's hugely problematic.
00:46:36.387 - 00:46:53.661, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay, So I was listening to Bell Curve, the most recent podcast was the end game for multichain or for chains generally. And one of the arguments they made was that there will be only five to six chains that will rule crypto.
00:46:53.733 - 00:46:55.589, Speaker B: Does that include the app chains.
00:46:55.757 - 00:47:28.745, Speaker A: I think he means just layer ones. He didn't mention app chains, he just said, I think layer ones. So like Solana, Ethereum, things like that. So he argued that there'll be 68 layer ones that'll dominate the world moving forward. The value right now is, and you and I have chatted about this before, which is a lot of the value is stuck on layer ones. There's a lot of excitement around infrastructure projects, but eventually these layer ones will become commodity like products. So he says, you and I've talked about this.
00:47:28.745 - 00:48:11.843, Speaker A: The next five to 10 years, all the value, a lot of the attention will be on layer ones, but eventually it'll move away from layer ones to apps. And these, these assets will be trading like commodities moving forward or mimic like the commodity markets. And then apps are the value, where the value will be. Regan also tweeted about this recently from Lattice where he talked about how a lot of the excitement around investors is around infrastructure, but it should be apps. You and I have chatted offline about this for, from, for a long time now. Where, you know, apps is where I think a lot of value should be accruing to versus where it's at now even today. Even the excitement today is around infrastructure.
00:48:11.843 - 00:48:30.591, Speaker A: But we're starting to see some signals where apps could actually make a difference. So Frontec or Fantasy and other apps that are coming out, we could see what this could become. So I guess like one is like maybe talking through the dynamic today and then we could talk about how value could accrue to apps and go from there.
00:48:30.703 - 00:49:05.467, Speaker B: So in my mind, the reason why all these infra products are valued so much, there's two reasons, and both reasons are kind of dumb. The first reason is that all these infra products are comped against BTC. So if you really think about BTC, BTC is valued at what, like $2 trillion, 1.5 or whatever because it's comped against gold, which is at 20 trillion. And then Ethereum, the Ethereum community has been pushing the ultrasound nanny narrative. So essentially they're comping Ethereum against Bitcoin. That's why Ethereum is valued so high as well.
00:49:05.467 - 00:49:50.249, Speaker B: And then all the alt layer, layer ones and L2s are comped against Ethereum and that's why they are, you know, the largest L2s are trading at over 10 billion FTV despite generating very little revenue. So this whole chain of comparables is the reason why the infra, that the whole infra sector is valued so high. So that's One of the reasons, but the second reason is that the VCs have so much money. Like when you have a billion dollar fund, you have to invest in things that can be easily comped against like trillion dollar networks. So pour a ton of money into those infra projects. Pre product. Just an idea.
00:49:50.249 - 00:50:51.351, Speaker B: At like 100, 200 million FTB, all these gazillion L2s and infra middle layer projects that are raising tens of millions of dollars at hundreds of million dollars of FTV pre product, how are they going to make a return for their investors? How are the investors going to make return for their LPs? Because if you really think about ultimately the exchanges, the centralized exchanges like Binance, OkX, Bybit, Coinbase, they are the king makers, but they also have to be selective. When they are presented with gazillion L2s, which ones are they going to list? They can't list everything, they have to be very selective. So wouldn't the majority of these $100 million FTV projects go into zero because they'll never get listed on centralized exchanges or at least on the big ones. Isn't that what's going to happen? Isn't there going to be a mass extension of these overfunded projects?
00:50:51.503 - 00:50:57.311, Speaker A: Yeah, that's why we're playing the low float high FDV game, aren't we?
00:50:57.423 - 00:50:57.959, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:50:58.087 - 00:51:11.963, Speaker A: Which is like wormhole opening up. Look, I have nothing against anyone, but I do want to talk about this, which is like you have wormhole opening at 15 billion, whereas if you look at a cross or synapse, they're trading at $200 million FTV, $300 million FTV.
00:51:12.079 - 00:51:12.595, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:51:12.715 - 00:51:21.815, Speaker A: You have these real skewed spectrums of FTVs and it's just between wormhole and across.
00:51:22.875 - 00:51:25.035, Speaker B: I looked at their numbers, they're pretty similar.
00:51:25.155 - 00:51:26.055, Speaker A: They're similar.
00:51:26.515 - 00:51:30.495, Speaker B: The biggest difference is just whether or not you're listed on binance.
00:51:30.875 - 00:51:36.067, Speaker A: It's binance of how much of the supply is circulating, right?
00:51:36.091 - 00:51:36.571, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:51:36.683 - 00:51:41.425, Speaker A: Because you get the. The same amount of buying power can give you a different price impact, Right?
00:51:41.545 - 00:51:41.985, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:51:42.065 - 00:51:58.353, Speaker A: And that's what's happening. And I do think that this is becoming more important moving forward. Like retail. There's different sites that will track everyone's vesting, you know, arbor terms like like recent overhang of like X amount of supply. It was on everyone's radar.
00:51:58.489 - 00:51:59.153, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:51:59.289 - 00:52:09.385, Speaker A: And I think this is going to become more and more important, which is why I think like meme coins has become such a interesting phenomena because most of the tokens are Fully diluted.
00:52:09.965 - 00:52:20.101, Speaker B: Which is why earlier I said the friend tech token airdrop. More people should experiment with it. It's the polar opposite of the current paradigm of low float high ftv.
00:52:20.253 - 00:53:00.449, Speaker A: Exactly. But then it also presents an opportunity. Right. And the opportunity is that one, there's so much supply of tokens that are sitting in the market that has real cash flows, has the right metrics where I think institutional funds can come in and scoop these relatively cheap assets up. So I do think there is a market in demand for hedge funds and like liquid funds to start allocating to this space. And you know, obviously between you and I, we've talked about this many times, but I do think there's the market is too skewed VC and so there's just a ton of capital that's waiting on the sidelines. Everyone is trying to find an edge to get the next founders right.
00:53:00.449 - 00:53:33.529, Speaker A: So we saw this phenomenon with like everyone launching their own accelerator programs as a way to build a wedge into attracting top of funnel. You're seeing, I don't know, grants programs and all these like interesting wedges. That is just trying to make it earlier, just trying to capture some sort of high quality like founder flow. But really I think the focus should be is like scooping up cheaper assets that are sitting in the markets that no one's really paying attention to. I think that's where people should be allocating in the space today. And now like CMS's recent tweet about that, he brought that up.
00:53:33.617 - 00:53:38.985, Speaker B: I do want to go back to the. I mean all this is related but I do want to go back to the app in infra.
00:53:39.105 - 00:53:41.325, Speaker A: Yeah, let's go back to that. We haven't talked enough about that.
00:53:42.025 - 00:54:10.725, Speaker B: So the current landscape is such that the infra is over. I wouldn't say overfunded, but it's certainly at least compared to apps, it's overfunded. And the large VCS would only who prefer to go for those infra projects. Infra projects take much, much longer to disprove. Whereas if you build an app, if you don't have users, you're disproved. The market will call bullshit on you. Whereas it's much harder for the market to call bullshit on infra.
00:54:10.725 - 00:54:43.863, Speaker B: Will this phenomenon change in the coming years? I think it'll change of infra priced much higher than apps and getting much more funding than apps. I think this will change, but I think this will take a while to change, like maybe three to five years. But apps, at least in my mind apps should start to accrue more and more value as more and more real apps are getting built. There was a tweet this morning about Google paying like $20 billion to Apple.
00:54:43.999 - 00:54:45.791, Speaker A: Oh yeah, the search or search make.
00:54:45.863 - 00:54:58.231, Speaker B: Google search the default search on Apple devices. And that accounted for like 20% of Apple's operating income. And my immediate reaction was if you own the end user, you own the rest of the supply chain.
00:54:58.343 - 00:54:58.695, Speaker A: That's right.
00:54:58.735 - 00:55:27.647, Speaker B: Like Apple is the prime example of this. Apple really owns the end user with the local devices, like with the smartphone and laptop. And even Google needs to bow in front of Apple as big as Google is. So I think the same thing is going to play out in apps and infra in crypto. If you own any users with your app, then you have a lot of bargaining power against the middleware, against the chains, and you can become a chain yourself.
00:55:27.791 - 00:55:56.967, Speaker A: The end game for crypto apps on layer ones, L2s, will have no loyalty to the underlying chain and all infrastructure will become commoditized over time. Yeah, I mean it's very apparent with what's happening in Web2. Right. But it seems like the thesis is the fat protocol thesis. Right. And I think we're kind of in that stage now where at least to everyone's mind and thesis and narrative protocol should accrue all the value. The way I think this would happen in the long run is that, you know, apps will own the end customer.
00:55:56.967 - 00:56:09.497, Speaker A: And then essentially, and I think Mike said this from Blockworks, that block space will just become cheap and available and whoever has the best, cheapest block space will win. They're like train carts.
00:56:09.601 - 00:57:15.815, Speaker B: There's a new phenomenon of apps turning into infra and we've seen that with Axie turning into Ronin, Blur turning into Blast, DYDX, HyperLiquid, going from an app into a layer one on Cosmos. And there's many apps that are doing this in stealth as well, or at least considering doing this. And so, and actually David from metastreet provided a really good analogy for what this is for. It's basically the crypto version of super apps. Like when you go from a, when you turn your app into a chain, a L2, for example, you're essentially becoming a super app. But every super app actually started off as one app that solved their specific problem. So for example, WeChat started off as solving the, the messaging problem, became really successful and then they acquired a bunch of third party developers to build in app experiences solving different problems like getting an Uber, making a payment, that kind of stuff.
00:57:15.815 - 00:57:24.335, Speaker B: And you're seeing the same thing with Axie turning into Ronin. Ronin is basically, you can think of Ronin as the super app. You can think of Blast as the super app.
00:57:24.675 - 00:57:31.237, Speaker A: Here's a problem though, I see is that for every app that becomes successful, they will want to launch your own chain.
00:57:31.341 - 00:57:36.261, Speaker B: Yeah, that process is the app turning into a super app.
00:57:36.373 - 00:58:02.565, Speaker A: Exactly. So I feel like this is going to continue happening. Here's a perfect example. I have founders that I speak to that are launching on all these different L2s that you mentioned. Their main goal is to become a L2. And so I don't know when this phenomenon will stop, but it will continue to be this way so that you know, one, the value of what you're building becomes much larger. Right.
00:58:02.565 - 00:58:29.755, Speaker A: Right now you're capped. So let's say if you're building an NFT marketplace, you're probably capped at a billion FDB to 2 billion FTB. But if you open it up to a layer 2, then you're maybe a 5 billion FTB, which is great for your token holders, but then it also gives you a much bigger surface area so that you can start to experiment and see what you could do. Right. And so I do think it's interesting, but I don't know when this phenomenon will stop, but I think it's going to continue happening until there's saturation in the market.
00:58:30.175 - 00:58:40.127, Speaker B: The amount of pitches I'm seeing that just slap L2 or even layer one onto their pitch is absurd.
00:58:40.231 - 00:59:08.595, Speaker A: It's absurd. And so I think it's like, all right, let's get rid of all of that. Focus on what, what can you build in a market today that'll get you maybe 50,000 users. Right, let's start with that. I mean, if Forecaster has, I don't know, Warpcast has what you said, 100,000 monthly active users. I think that's a great benchmark for social apps. And so if you can start to build towards that, then I think you have something that's very valuable, thus making your L2 and whatever else you want to build behind it much more valuable.
00:59:08.595 - 00:59:22.255, Speaker A: And so DY DX is doing this really well. As you mentioned, Hyperliquid is doing this well and other chains. So it'll be interesting to see how this plays out. Cool. I think we're at time. Any final thoughts, Chow?
00:59:22.375 - 00:59:48.673, Speaker B: I think we as an industry were on the verge of finding some really cool use cases that could go mainstream. So payment is already mainstream. Cross border payment, Social fi feels like it's next if you think about Pumpkin Pump fun like people think of Pump as a Meme Coin launchpad. But there's a lot of social component going on on Pump. I think we're close, we're very close to for social fat to go mainstream.
00:59:48.769 - 01:00:22.163, Speaker A: I agree. And I think we need one lightning bottle in a moment to get users. So it was. I wrote a tweet yesterday, a couple days ago, which talks about what you just mentioned. There has been extensive discussion about market structure and speculation regarding the VC and Meme Coin Meta. The trends were apparent as early as August of last year when you and I got rugged by bald and became even more pronounced in November 2023 when we brought up the thesis around when Grok first came up, we saw Grok Token or Cybertruck Token. That was back in November 2023.
01:00:22.163 - 01:00:54.595, Speaker A: But the problem with crypto is that there are no compelling stories. There's no compelling stories in crypto outside of infrastructure. And now Meme Coins. And so we have achieved, I mean, Outside of like MetaMask, Coinbase and Phantom, we haven't really achieved success as an industry. There isn't any story. When I talk to LPs or limited partners for those that want to invest in alliance, as an example, they asked me like, point me to some success stories and I point to those three. You know, I can talk about Jupiter and other things, but they don't understand what that means yet.
01:00:54.595 - 01:01:41.437, Speaker A: There isn't like a household brand that, that I could point to and say like, here's a decentralized app that you could use today. There's nothing like that. And I think what's happening with retail isn't like, yeah, you could blame high fdv, low circulation, you could blame all this stuff. But I could simply put it this way, is that people are tired of constant market rotations and trying to figure out where the hot ball of money is going to go next. They're just tired of all this shit, right? I think it's simpler for them to just have social consensus on what memes are going to go mainstream and bet on that. That just to me seems to them and to me seems simpler. And so the only thing that I anticipate that will compete against the Meme Meta is when you start to see consumer apps with tokens getting millions and billions of users today.
01:01:41.437 - 01:01:45.653, Speaker A: That's the only time where I think Meme tokens will start to face competition.
01:01:45.749 - 01:01:51.501, Speaker B: But even those social apps are going to have, are very likely going to have a Meme Coin component.
01:01:51.653 - 01:02:32.363, Speaker A: They have to, I mean that's like kind of like the go to market. I mean, like even look at Pumpkin pump is a meme coin launchpad, right? Look at friend tech, the friend token, it's a bunny. I think that's a part of the gtm, right? The go to market strategy. But if you think about it, when you ask, okay, so here's an example, right, I did a search the other day of the top five stocks for every decade, and there's five, right? And I forgot some of them. But there's oil was one that was dominant every decade. There's like computing, right? There's telecom. These things that people can use and see every day are the ones that they'll bet on, right? Because that's what they know.
01:02:32.363 - 01:03:03.005, Speaker A: And I think for us, at least in the retail world, when you ask anyone, they'll say Coinbase. So they'll buy Coinbase stock. So what I guess where I'm getting at with this, like, if we have more real world products that people can see and feel, then they'll buy it, right? And that's a form of advertising. People buy Tesla stock because they see Tesla everywhere, right? And so the argument I'm making here is that once we go mainstream, then it's easier for people to, you know, that success of a, of a product is a meme in, in itself, is what I'm saying. And so until we have that, we're just going to bet on shit coins.
01:03:04.145 - 01:03:05.617, Speaker B: It is what it is and I'm.
01:03:05.641 - 01:03:29.275, Speaker A: I'm good with that. Like, I think that's a good way to start. Cool. All right, well, thanks for tuning in. Catch us up next time.
