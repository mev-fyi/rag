00:00:00.200 - 00:00:57.240, Speaker A: The more interesting chart that I want to talk to you about is a chart of the S and P plotted against the last eight us recessions, so dating all the way back to 1970s. Interestingly, six of the last eight recessions, the S and P bottom during the second half of the recession, one of the last eight recessions, the S and P bottom in the first half of the recession, and the remaining one recession, the S and P bottomed after the recession. That one instance was actually the 2000 tech bubble, and the current market actually feels eerily similar to the 2000 tech bubble. So the point I'm trying to say here is right now, we're not even talking about recession yet. We haven't even hit official recession. The NBR official recession. Yep, all the pundits, the media is thinking about when the recession will happen, not whether or not the recession is happening.
00:00:57.240 - 00:00:57.344, Speaker A: Currently.
