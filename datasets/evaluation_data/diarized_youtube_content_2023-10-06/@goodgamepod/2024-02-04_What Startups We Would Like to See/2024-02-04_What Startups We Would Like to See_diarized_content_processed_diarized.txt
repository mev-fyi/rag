00:00:00.280 - 00:00:25.976, Speaker A: What startups would you like to see? Rwn payment the data is so compelling. Socialfi as well. I think it's a new asset class and no one has cracked it. No one's correct. I'm most excited about social fi. A lot of things that we could have seen a few years ago but haven't seen was simply due to that blockchain didn't scale. If the blockchain was faster cheaper, then we probably would have seen social fi apps a while ago because that kind of stuff requires pretty big trading fees.
00:00:25.976 - 00:00:55.444, Speaker A: The scaling of the blockchain really matters to enable scaling costs. I think UI UX infrastructure, you know, all the things necessary to scale apps and users rpcs. I think we're going to see more login using web, two credentials using Google and Apple ID, kind of onboarding experience, and more mobile apps as well this year compared to desktop. Again, that's a very easy prediction to make because that is the trend we're seeing and there's no reason why the trend wouldn't continue.
