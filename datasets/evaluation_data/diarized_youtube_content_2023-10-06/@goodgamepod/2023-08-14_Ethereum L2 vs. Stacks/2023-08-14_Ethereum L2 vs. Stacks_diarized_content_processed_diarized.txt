00:00:00.240 - 00:00:55.704, Speaker A: I agree that, you know, stacks is much earlier. So the way I look at this is bitcoin is like roughly $500 billion of capital and all of these l two side chains, however you classify them, are barely like in a one or $2 billion market right now. Whereas on Ethereum Ethereum is roughly $250 billion. And the l two side chain market is I think just the public part might be 25 billion but there's a private part to it which might take petrol market like 40 50 billion. So one would be just very early and I think a much bigger untapped market. And I think the ordinals analogy works really well that as soon as bitcoin nfts really could happen we saw a ton of interest and both from developers, from collectors, from artists and so on. And I don't think our industry has seen like a true bitcoin defi moment, right, like where a ton of BTC capital is actually flowing into a contract getting locked and getting used to.
