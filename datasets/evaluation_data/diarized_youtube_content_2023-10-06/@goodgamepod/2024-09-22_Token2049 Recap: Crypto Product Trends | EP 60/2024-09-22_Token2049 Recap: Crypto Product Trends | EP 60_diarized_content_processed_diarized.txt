00:00:00.440 - 00:00:16.913, Speaker A: Welcome to GoodGame. Your no BS insights for crypto founders. It's like we're going back to the early days of the og When I got into crypto and original vision though, we used to see these ideas all the time.
00:00:17.009 - 00:00:17.489, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:00:17.577 - 00:00:21.405, Speaker A: And I don't know what happened. Like, I mean, there was Nucypher, if you remember that.
00:00:21.825 - 00:00:43.673, Speaker C: What happened is a few things. One, crypto attracted the wrong people. I mean, like these products that I just talked about, messaging, the mesh network, these are not going to make you rich within a few months. It takes a long time. Like the session app, it took them six years. They've been building this for six years. Yeah, like this time product is not something you can get rich very quickly.
00:00:43.769 - 00:00:45.945, Speaker A: Looking for your next startup idea in crypto?
00:00:46.065 - 00:00:47.641, Speaker C: Check out our request for startups list.
00:00:47.673 - 00:01:09.803, Speaker A: And get Inspired at Alliance XYZ Ideas. So at Token 2049, Ciao and I have spent a few days here and I think it's been pretty fun. There's been incredible amount of founders. I'd say this event, I'd probably seen more founders than I have VCs.
00:01:09.979 - 00:01:16.775, Speaker C: Has that always been the case in other crypto conferences? I don't go to a lot of them, so I don't really know.
00:01:17.795 - 00:01:21.131, Speaker A: Well, yeah, I think so. Yeah. I feel it.
00:01:21.243 - 00:01:21.739, Speaker C: Okay.
00:01:21.827 - 00:01:26.163, Speaker A: Apparently there's about 20, 000 people that have signed up to come to this event.
00:01:26.219 - 00:01:27.179, Speaker C: Oh, my God.
00:01:27.347 - 00:01:35.027, Speaker A: 20, 000 crypto guys and girls that came to this event. Every place that I've went is slammed.
00:01:35.131 - 00:01:35.627, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:01:35.731 - 00:01:41.163, Speaker A: And in parallel to this, there's a F1 race, so there's just a ton of traffic everywhere we go.
00:01:41.219 - 00:01:41.787, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:01:41.931 - 00:01:47.361, Speaker C: The flight I booked is the. The most expensive flight I've ever booked in the hotel as well.
00:01:47.523 - 00:01:50.825, Speaker A: But that's just because everyone just came here.
00:01:52.005 - 00:01:52.745, Speaker C: Sure.
00:01:54.245 - 00:02:37.351, Speaker A: My flight wasn't that bad in terms of price, but overall, I think the event's been great. And we're getting ready to head to Breakpoint Solana. Breakpoint as well. So I'm pretty excited about that. What are some interesting trends that you've seen so far here? And we did a founders therapy session yesterday. Spent like, I don't know, an hour, hour and a half talking to, let's say, 30 random founders that joined our event, which we did kind of last minute. And so it kind of gives you a kind of a good spectrum of what people are working on.
00:02:37.351 - 00:02:56.215, Speaker A: And so there's some interesting ideas. So curious on. On what your thoughts are, but I think the one that. I think there are a couple some Are building consumer. I still see consumer as a vertical tokenization like RWAs as 2.
00:02:57.955 - 00:02:59.859, Speaker C: From the panels or from the founders who talk.
00:02:59.907 - 00:03:03.475, Speaker A: Just the founders at our confessions, our feedback session.
00:03:03.555 - 00:03:04.379, Speaker C: Therapy session.
00:03:04.467 - 00:03:40.733, Speaker A: Therapy session, what else? So I'd say consumer. I'd say in consumer specifically I've seen prediction markets. What was the other one? Yeah, I can't think of it right now, but I saw a couple of prediction markets and then social networks and RWAs and some infra. Like the layer one that wants to build the hyper liquid competitor. Yeah. So it seems like in terms of ideas, I don't think I've seen anything really net new.
00:03:40.829 - 00:03:44.225, Speaker C: No, I didn't. I've seen many good ideas.
00:03:45.085 - 00:03:50.945, Speaker A: Do you feel like we're hitting a ceiling in terms of ideas?
00:03:51.245 - 00:03:55.357, Speaker C: I think across the industry, yes. But you and I have a lot of ideas.
00:03:55.461 - 00:03:56.265, Speaker A: We do.
00:03:56.845 - 00:04:00.701, Speaker C: There aren't enough founders to work on that we can find to work on these ideas.
00:04:00.733 - 00:04:01.425, Speaker A: That's right.
00:04:01.955 - 00:04:22.975, Speaker C: But it seems to me that deep hint is now the shelling point of narrative because people ran out of ideas. Every time crypto runs out of idea, we just pick a narrative to give it to something, become the shelling point. And now that. Right now that shelling point is deepin.
00:04:24.755 - 00:04:28.965, Speaker A: So what in deepen. So are just people pointing to Helium?
00:04:29.155 - 00:04:30.985, Speaker C: I think helium is the biggest one.
00:04:31.065 - 00:04:38.165, Speaker A: Yeah. Is it because of the success of the mobile network Data offloading?
00:04:38.625 - 00:04:39.425, Speaker C: Data offloading?
00:04:39.465 - 00:04:52.033, Speaker A: Data offloading from T Mobile and other carriers which is directly tied to the token. Right. So there are some pretty strong use cases around here.
00:04:52.049 - 00:04:53.525, Speaker C: Do you think helium has product market?
00:04:56.115 - 00:05:21.939, Speaker A: They're slowly getting into product market fit. I mean like yeah, they do have product market fit. I think what's, what I, I'm less sure about is the entire network that they're building on the back end. Right. So an example of the data offloading, I think that's very strong. But the question is could they ha. Like how much could they handle in terms of bandwidth, in terms of offloading the data? Right.
00:05:21.939 - 00:05:22.867, Speaker A: I'm unsure.
00:05:22.971 - 00:05:25.975, Speaker C: There is a new narrative that I heard called payfi.
00:05:26.595 - 00:05:27.979, Speaker A: Yeah. Have you heard Puma?
00:05:28.027 - 00:05:30.091, Speaker C: Right. You know how that works?
00:05:30.203 - 00:05:39.459, Speaker A: It's like a, it's like a lender, Right. That lends like short term loans to between companies.
00:05:39.507 - 00:05:41.843, Speaker C: Corporate short term loan cover loans.
00:05:41.939 - 00:05:46.073, Speaker A: Yes. And so you know I did hear about this.
00:05:46.179 - 00:05:46.821, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:05:46.973 - 00:05:54.373, Speaker A: And there are startups that need this type of like short term lending, such as on and off ramps.
00:05:54.429 - 00:05:55.065, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:05:55.365 - 00:05:56.325, Speaker A: They're like a big customer.
00:05:56.365 - 00:06:14.831, Speaker C: I met the founder yesterday, last night. But I need to catch up with them on the details of what he's building. But I think the high level thesis or idea is that by leveraging crypto rails you can reduce the, the time of settlement.
00:06:14.983 - 00:06:21.315, Speaker A: Basically, yeah. Because you could, you could do it, you could instant settle, you could instant settle the loans.
00:06:21.975 - 00:06:31.235, Speaker C: So that reduces the, or improves the capital efficiency of, you know, between the companies lending to each other.
00:06:33.535 - 00:06:35.635, Speaker A: I mean it is an interesting narrative.
00:06:36.695 - 00:06:41.161, Speaker C: And apparently they're close to becoming profitable. Net profitable.
00:06:41.273 - 00:06:41.809, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:06:41.897 - 00:06:42.329, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:06:42.417 - 00:06:50.025, Speaker C: So they're like, they have real users and they're solving real problem and it's on Solana.
00:06:50.145 - 00:06:54.729, Speaker A: It's on Solana. Who are the customers that they're servicing?
00:06:54.857 - 00:07:17.469, Speaker C: I don't know exactly. I need to catch up with the founder today, but that's one I'm paying attention to. That's probably the most interesting one I've seen. That's solving a real use case. There's a couple other ones that I talked to that I found interesting. One is building like Signal, an alternative to Signal called Session. You actually showed me the app two years ago.
00:07:17.469 - 00:07:20.405, Speaker C: Yes, we tried it, but the onboarding was pretty bad.
00:07:20.445 - 00:07:22.037, Speaker A: It was really bad back then, but.
00:07:22.061 - 00:07:53.161, Speaker C: Now it's pretty good. The onboarding is pretty seamless and the idea is a stronger privacy guarantee than Signal. Apparently. I don't understand the technical details yet, but they do some onion routing in order to hide. So when you send messages to each other, they onion route the messages through an onion network. It's like a tour. Right, but specifically designed for messaging.
00:07:53.161 - 00:08:28.235, Speaker C: And then the idea is to hide your IP address because apparently IP address is something that Signal has access to. They say they don't store your information but you have to trust them on that. So the onion routing, routing effectively hides the IP address. And they do some other stuff with phone number as well. They try to hide your phone. Apparently phone number is a weakness in Signal as well because Signal stores a encrypted version of your phone number in their database. A mapping between the phone number and your public key.
00:08:28.615 - 00:08:37.975, Speaker A: So that's Hindik also had an exploit recently or there's some something went on with Signal.
00:08:38.055 - 00:09:14.625, Speaker C: Yeah, there was some FUD risk a few months ago where the client, the Mac client, someone called them out for. So Signal is open source. So someone downloaded the code, tried to run the server, the server side code and then realize that it doesn't work. I don't know the details but apparently it didn't work. So apparently effectively Signal is not running the version of the code that is public. That is Open source. Oh, so that is.
00:09:14.925 - 00:09:15.933, Speaker A: That's kind of shady.
00:09:16.029 - 00:09:24.775, Speaker C: Yeah, it's shady. Again, I haven't verified that information. I just got this. I heard this from the Session team.
00:09:24.815 - 00:09:25.887, Speaker A: So there could be a backdoor.
00:09:25.951 - 00:09:35.991, Speaker C: There could be a backdoor, but session is interesting. Apparently they have like a million daily active users. How many?
00:09:36.143 - 00:09:36.783, Speaker A: Two million?
00:09:36.879 - 00:10:05.645, Speaker C: One million. And they don't know who the users are exactly, but they think that most of the users are not crypto natives. There are people everyday, everyday people who actually need privacy. So one time they got a message from the Switzerland government and saying like, hey, we love what you guys are building. By the way, Switzerland is like one of the few European countries who's very big on privacy.
00:10:05.945 - 00:10:07.005, Speaker A: Why is that?
00:10:07.345 - 00:10:19.825, Speaker C: I don't know, like, maybe historical reason. Like Switzerland has always been this neutral. Also, they're very big on banking privacy. Right. That's why all the rich people store their money in.
00:10:20.125 - 00:10:25.013, Speaker A: I just created a sessions account in 10 seconds.
00:10:25.069 - 00:10:26.533, Speaker C: Yes, onboarding is very good.
00:10:26.629 - 00:10:30.637, Speaker A: The onboarding is great. It doesn't ask you for any information.
00:10:30.741 - 00:10:31.477, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:10:31.661 - 00:10:42.287, Speaker C: Oh, the ALN routing is the deepin part of the project. So there's like a bunch of nodes route messages through each other and they're incentivized.
00:10:42.311 - 00:10:43.475, Speaker A: You don't have to run a node.
00:10:43.975 - 00:10:50.915, Speaker C: No, no, you don't. Need you as a user. You can, you can, you can run it, run a node and earn some tokens.
00:10:51.895 - 00:10:52.795, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:10:56.535 - 00:10:58.463, Speaker C: One million data active user. It's pretty good.
00:10:58.479 - 00:10:58.967, Speaker A: It's not bad.
00:10:59.031 - 00:10:59.391, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:10:59.463 - 00:10:59.879, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:10:59.967 - 00:11:02.955, Speaker C: And the Swiss government is apparently using it.
00:11:04.475 - 00:11:11.627, Speaker A: Well, they have to counter. Did you hear about the Mossad, like, blowing up pagers?
00:11:11.771 - 00:11:13.067, Speaker C: Oh, yeah, that was yesterday.
00:11:13.171 - 00:11:13.723, Speaker A: Yesterday?
00:11:13.819 - 00:11:15.515, Speaker C: What happened there exactly? I was in the.
00:11:15.595 - 00:11:19.935, Speaker A: I think they were trying to target like some key. Hezbollah.
00:11:20.235 - 00:11:20.595, Speaker B: Who?
00:11:20.635 - 00:11:21.419, Speaker C: Israel.
00:11:21.587 - 00:11:36.175, Speaker A: Israel. And I guess they did a sting operation where Hezbollah knew that their phones were compromised no matter what phone they use. So they went to pagers. But it turns out the pagers that they bought was from Assad.
00:11:37.915 - 00:11:40.555, Speaker C: And the pagers blew up. Okay.
00:11:40.635 - 00:11:46.075, Speaker A: And they were manufactured from Taiwan. And so Taiwan put out a tweet or whatever.
00:11:46.115 - 00:11:48.035, Speaker C: They're like, hey, we have nothing.
00:11:48.075 - 00:11:52.019, Speaker A: We just. We have nothing to do with. We just sold the devices. They're one of our licensed partners.
00:11:52.107 - 00:11:52.775, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:11:53.435 - 00:12:03.735, Speaker C: And then Today, like apparently 20,000 more cell phones or something exploded again, like a day after the pagers exploded.
00:12:04.275 - 00:12:13.575, Speaker A: Does it have anything to do with token 2049? But. Interesting. Is that true?
00:12:14.235 - 00:12:16.535, Speaker C: I saw it on the newspapers this morning.
00:12:18.115 - 00:12:20.135, Speaker A: Interesting. So going back to.
00:12:20.475 - 00:12:21.687, Speaker C: I read newspaper.
00:12:21.851 - 00:12:23.487, Speaker A: You still read a Paper.
00:12:23.551 - 00:12:24.119, Speaker C: Like paper?
00:12:24.167 - 00:12:24.415, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:12:24.455 - 00:12:25.319, Speaker A: You do that every morning?
00:12:25.407 - 00:12:30.315, Speaker C: No, just here in Singapore, they gave me a newspaper. Physical paper. Newspaper.
00:12:31.935 - 00:12:35.415, Speaker A: So that's like Jamie Dimon. Did you watch his.
00:12:35.575 - 00:12:36.135, Speaker C: What did he say?
00:12:36.175 - 00:12:41.487, Speaker A: Every morning he wakes up at 4am and he reads 12 newspapers from back to front.
00:12:41.551 - 00:12:41.951, Speaker B: That's.
00:12:42.023 - 00:12:45.915, Speaker C: That's me this morning. I actually Woke up at 4am Because I couldn't sleep.
00:12:46.815 - 00:12:47.795, Speaker A: Oh, my God.
00:12:49.075 - 00:12:58.763, Speaker C: Session is interesting. And there's another one. There's a molecule. Bio xyz. Like the DSI guys. The og.
00:12:58.859 - 00:13:00.555, Speaker A: Yeah. How is that?
00:13:00.715 - 00:13:31.147, Speaker C: So they're cooking a new project. It's called the Cooking. They're cooking Pump Science. Oh, pump science. Effectively, you launch a token on a scientific ip, typically a drug discovery ip. You tokenize it and then it trades and then. Well, you tokenize it and you raise some money from the crowd.
00:13:31.147 - 00:13:43.405, Speaker C: A crowd sale, basically. And then it trades and then there's token. There's liquidity immediately. The idea is twofold, the fundraising and the liquidity. The ip, immediate liquidity on the ip.
00:13:43.565 - 00:13:44.277, Speaker A: That's cool.
00:13:44.381 - 00:13:53.317, Speaker C: So apparently they have some really good scientists wanting to try this.
00:13:53.501 - 00:14:10.439, Speaker A: So they will launch a token and let's say that they want to do some DNA research. So then they will launch a token. People would buy it. The money that's earned from trading fees would go to the. Or would it be the bonding curve itself?
00:14:10.487 - 00:14:25.635, Speaker C: I mean, the design space is the open, but what they're thinking is an actual crowd sale instead of training fees going back to the creator. But that's also on the table.
00:14:26.015 - 00:14:27.115, Speaker A: That's interesting.
00:14:29.135 - 00:14:30.647, Speaker C: That makes a lot of sense to me.
00:14:30.711 - 00:14:31.395, Speaker A: It does.
00:14:32.215 - 00:14:41.169, Speaker C: The idea of channeling DJ and energy into new science. Into new science. Yeah, it makes a lot of sense to me. Meme Coin basics.
00:14:41.257 - 00:14:48.025, Speaker A: Yeah. Sometimes I feel like Meme Coins is not the right naming factor for.
00:14:48.105 - 00:14:51.713, Speaker C: It's a terrible naming. People draw wrong conclusions.
00:14:51.809 - 00:14:57.665, Speaker A: Exactly. And so I do think we need to go through a rebrand when it comes to Meme Coins.
00:14:57.745 - 00:14:58.289, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:14:58.417 - 00:15:01.603, Speaker C: Call it intersubjective token.
00:15:01.659 - 00:15:07.635, Speaker A: Third party staking, yield, restaking token.
00:15:07.675 - 00:15:10.035, Speaker C: I haven't heard any restaking so far.
00:15:10.155 - 00:15:11.435, Speaker A: Oh, I got pitch restaking.
00:15:11.515 - 00:15:11.947, Speaker B: You did?
00:15:12.011 - 00:15:12.211, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:12.243 - 00:15:12.899, Speaker C: Okay.
00:15:13.067 - 00:15:15.655, Speaker A: But it was lending.
00:15:16.515 - 00:15:17.347, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:15:17.531 - 00:15:18.155, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:18.275 - 00:15:19.459, Speaker C: There's another project.
00:15:19.587 - 00:15:20.415, Speaker A: Which one?
00:15:21.275 - 00:15:24.579, Speaker C: That one is building a mesh network of.
00:15:24.627 - 00:15:25.881, Speaker A: Oh, Bluetooth. Right.
00:15:26.043 - 00:15:41.877, Speaker C: Bluetooth and WI Fi direct. So the idea is you can text each other without the Internet and you text each other using the WI FI signal and. Or Bluetooth. WI fi has a max distance of 200 meters.
00:15:41.981 - 00:15:42.381, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:42.453 - 00:15:44.877, Speaker C: And then Bluetooth is 30.
00:15:45.021 - 00:15:47.309, Speaker A: So between the two radiuses.
00:15:47.397 - 00:15:47.717, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:15:47.781 - 00:16:07.249, Speaker C: You're able to message people as long as there's. So then. So as long as there's a node within 30 meters the user, if you're using Bluetooth or 200 meters for using Wi fi, then you can send messages to someone else within the same radius.
00:16:07.377 - 00:16:15.601, Speaker A: Do you think something like this could go big? I could see this definitely in countries where there's a lot of control.
00:16:15.713 - 00:16:16.369, Speaker B: Yes.
00:16:16.537 - 00:16:20.055, Speaker C: That's probably the most interesting use case of this mesh network.
00:16:20.145 - 00:16:20.611, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:16:20.723 - 00:16:27.595, Speaker C: And so in the past there has been many cases of people wanting to organize protests.
00:16:27.635 - 00:16:27.995, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:16:28.075 - 00:16:29.491, Speaker C: Like peaceful protests.
00:16:29.523 - 00:16:30.135, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:16:30.675 - 00:16:39.335, Speaker C: And they couldn't do it because the government shut down the Internet or the messaging app so they couldn't self organize.
00:16:39.755 - 00:16:47.345, Speaker A: It's also happened in Turkey where they shut down like all the DNS resolvers point. So you came next to the Internet.
00:16:47.425 - 00:16:48.137, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:16:48.321 - 00:16:56.525, Speaker C: And it happened in Egypt during their revolution revolt, I think probably Hong Kong as well.
00:16:57.225 - 00:17:13.635, Speaker A: So it seems like generally it's like we're going back to the early days of when I got into crypto and original vision though we used to see these ideas all the time and I don't know what happened. Like, I mean there was Nucypher if you remember that.
00:17:14.055 - 00:17:39.875, Speaker C: What happened is a few things. One, crypto attracted the wrong people. I mean like these products that I just talked about, like the messaging, the mesh network, these are not going to make you rich within a few months. It takes a long time. Like the session app, it took them six years. They've been building this for six years this time. Product is not something you can get rich very quickly.
00:17:40.425 - 00:17:55.761, Speaker A: No, it's like an open source model. Right. You kind of commit a lot of time. You want to make like founders aren't here to get rich quick. They believe in this as a core principle.
00:17:55.873 - 00:17:56.329, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:17:56.417 - 00:18:07.153, Speaker C: And the fact that these technologies are fundamentally anti government, anti authoritarian, makes it difficult for most founders to jump into this kind of opportunities.
00:18:07.289 - 00:18:09.393, Speaker A: Yeah, it just takes a very, takes.
00:18:09.409 - 00:18:10.521, Speaker C: A very different kind of founder.
00:18:10.553 - 00:18:10.977, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:18:11.081 - 00:18:25.329, Speaker C: Founder mindset. And then also the centralized exchanges are not going to. They don't want to fuck with the government. They're not going to list your token if you have a token. So again it's hard to get rich quickly if you build this kind of product. So.
00:18:25.417 - 00:18:35.487, Speaker A: But I'm really interested, I'm interested in more censorship resistant products. Messaging, Internet access, domains. The entire stack.
00:18:35.551 - 00:18:44.191, Speaker C: The entire stack. DNS is still one of the points of centralization of potential censorship.
00:18:44.263 - 00:18:46.447, Speaker A: Yeah. What was the project?
00:18:46.511 - 00:19:14.485, Speaker C: Oh, there's another one. I'M going to meet tomorrow. That's a decentralized Tor. Forgot to name the. It's called anyone Anyone but it's a decentralized Tor. They want to make Tor great again. But what happened like they told me about like Tor, it's, I think it's pretty well known that big percentage of the Tor nodes are controlled by the CIA nsa and in fact it was a project by the CIA nsa.
00:19:14.485 - 00:19:49.677, Speaker C: And so users of Tor effectively have no real privacy when they surf the Internet through Tor. So they want to make a new version of Tor. Tor is open source by the way. Yeah, but they want to make a new version, fix some of the technology stuff. But more interestingly using token incentives to bootstrap a greater number of nodes so that it becomes more decentralized, less prone to a central entity like CI nsa.
00:19:49.781 - 00:19:53.111, Speaker A: So some messages could be routed, but not all.
00:19:53.303 - 00:20:14.663, Speaker C: Is the idea that one is interesting. I don't know the details yet. I'm going to meet the team in person. But in general decentralized Tor VPN mesh network messaging, like offline messaging without the Internet and then privacy preserving messaging. This kind of stuff is super interesting.
00:20:14.719 - 00:20:19.863, Speaker A: Yeah, we've also seen a number of decentralized VPNs as well.
00:20:19.999 - 00:20:24.235, Speaker C: Yeah but VPN is kind of, it's a very crowded space.
00:20:25.215 - 00:20:35.663, Speaker A: I don't think there are winners yet for decentralized VPN and I think that's primarily because for the average person there's no real difference that they'll see. Right, right.
00:20:35.799 - 00:20:39.555, Speaker C: Like there, there's a couple ones I use like the ma, the major ones. Right.
00:20:40.095 - 00:20:41.275, Speaker A: Which ones do you use?
00:20:42.535 - 00:21:03.943, Speaker C: Like Proton and NordVPN. Like these are some of the brand names and a few other like less well known. But the ones that I use but the main ones are you know the likes of Proton and so there's a few brand name ones and I think all of them are pretty good product wise at least from the end users point of view.
00:21:03.959 - 00:21:22.453, Speaker A: Yeah, I think NordVPN I did a quick research on this before but that one instance where they went down and you know the decentralized VPN guys, they always argue that they'll never go down, their uptime is high. But NordVPN uptimes has been very good over the years.
00:21:22.549 - 00:21:38.985, Speaker C: The uptime is one concern but the bigger concern is that is the central point of Central point affiliate. They store, they store a lot of the information about you and so you have to assume that they aren't compromised.
00:21:39.145 - 00:21:41.285, Speaker A: To be quite frank, I think they're all Compromised.
00:21:41.585 - 00:21:43.585, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that that's, it's.
00:21:43.705 - 00:22:30.245, Speaker A: They're all compromised. I think everyone has a back door. It's all compromised. That's the way I think about it. I mean, even if you think about like going back to the Hezbollah example, I mean these guys, like, like I think the, the President of Iran or there was a situation where like the guy that was negotiating a peace treaty with Israel, the main guy went to go see the President, Iran, and in front of the President, Iran or like around that vicinity to kill them. Like, how do you, how do you even have that? Like, how do you do that? Right. In an enemy controlled environment, you need to have data and control of, you know, access points.
00:22:30.375 - 00:22:31.045, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:22:32.225 - 00:22:37.521, Speaker A: So to me, I think the agencies that are out there are very, very, very powerful.
00:22:37.593 - 00:23:07.531, Speaker C: I learned something interesting related to that. I learned something interesting about GPS and like GPS technology. So apparently every country has their own GPS system because they don't want. One of the reasons is they don't want the outside, the, their presidents to, to reveal their like, exact location because it's very, very dangerous. Like the drone attacks. The drones can be very dangerous if they know your exact.
00:23:07.643 - 00:23:08.123, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:23:08.219 - 00:23:08.715, Speaker C: Precision.
00:23:08.795 - 00:23:09.363, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:23:09.499 - 00:23:10.535, Speaker C: Or location.
00:23:10.835 - 00:23:47.545, Speaker A: So I do think we're like, you know, we're in America and like, you know, there are a lot of things that we take for granted, but then also we do give up a lot in terms of privacy. But I do think we're entering this new world where, you know, people all over the world are going to be, oh, here, here's a funny example. So I was watching this TikTok video and they're interviewing like old mafias. Right. And so, and so I was watching this, this guy who used to be part of. You ever watch a movie, Casino with Joe Pesci? Okay. It's, it's a classic.
00:23:47.545 - 00:24:21.825, Speaker A: So long story short, they interviewed this guy, 80 years old, and he's like, yeah, the mob, they don't kill people anymore. And the guy asked him why, he goes, electronic devices, it's just too hard to hide evidence. You know, phones, cameras, gps, all of it. And so we just don't do it anymore. We just have to find other ways to do it. But he goes, he also said that, you know, because of that, our power has dwindled. Like we don't have the power that we used to 40, 50 years ago.
00:24:21.825 - 00:25:02.075, Speaker A: So I just thought that was an interesting antidote that I heard. So I do feel like a lot of our power is going away, like, you know, I mean, for good. Right. There's a lot of good reasons for that, but also bad. So we talked about, it's funny, we just talked about listings, right? Like how decentralized networks don't get, will not probably will not get support and in fact they're probably delist. Like what happened with Monero as an example and zcash. Also, I think there could be an interesting angle for an exchange that can list tokens that are unwanted by.
00:25:02.075 - 00:25:08.725, Speaker A: I mean obviously you have Uniswap and others, but like I feel like they could also be controlled.
00:25:09.665 - 00:25:48.665, Speaker C: Hey, I had a quick chat with Kartik, the Youth Global. Yeah, the organizer, the guy, the mastermind behind Youth Global. He told me that currently the US is still the biggest country for hackathon or hackathon for developers. And the number in the US has actually gone up in the last couple of years for ETH Global. And that is the total opposite of what we see. Because what we see is founders. What CAR sees developers is hackers who have a full time job somewhere else, most of whom are outside of crypto.
00:25:48.665 - 00:26:22.593, Speaker C: They go there for a weekend project, free food and potentially some money prizes. So the number of hackers actually have gone up in the last couple of years despite the extremely hostile regulatory regime. And we see the opposite because we see our number of US based founders go down dramatically in the last two years. That's one data point. And then Japan is apparently one of the top countries for ETH Global. And then India. India is very consistent in this.
00:26:22.593 - 00:26:23.345, Speaker C: What we see.
00:26:23.425 - 00:26:30.331, Speaker A: Yeah, Japan doesn't make sense to me. I don't think I've seen any Japanese founders.
00:26:30.483 - 00:26:49.051, Speaker C: I've seen a couple, but talking. Yeah, that applied to our program. But the thing with. Oh, I talked to another guy who told me about the ecosystem in Japan. You remember a few, a couple months ago Sony announced their product Sonium. Yeah, Sonium.
00:26:49.083 - 00:26:51.555, Speaker A: Yeah, Sonium, whatever.
00:26:52.255 - 00:27:41.215, Speaker C: And apparently the Japanese ecosystem is like one cycle behind the frontier. So they're now playing NFTs, whereas for the frontier NFTs was like a cycle ago. And they're extremely separate, isolated from the rest of the international crypto ecosystem. And we're talking about why, like why is that, and I give a very simple reason, because I know this from first experience talking to the Japanese founders is that the language barrier is just impossible to overcome. It's very, very hard to communicate with Japanese founders.
00:27:42.685 - 00:27:46.517, Speaker A: But that's also true for other parts of the world. Right?
00:27:46.661 - 00:27:49.429, Speaker C: Japan specifically is very difficult.
00:27:49.557 - 00:27:56.757, Speaker A: I mean Vietnam is the same. I feel like Vietnam's community is very strong. I mean coin 98.
00:27:56.861 - 00:27:57.545, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:28:00.165 - 00:28:04.185, Speaker C: But most Vietnamese founders I spoke with are pretty good.
00:28:04.685 - 00:28:06.261, Speaker A: Oh, no. There's a language barrier.
00:28:06.373 - 00:28:06.885, Speaker C: There is.
00:28:06.965 - 00:28:08.585, Speaker A: Yeah. It's hard.
00:28:09.485 - 00:28:12.797, Speaker C: Okay. But I mean, the ones that apply to. But.
00:28:12.821 - 00:28:17.869, Speaker A: But. Okay, so let's just say there's parts of the world where language is a barrier and Japan is one of them.
00:28:17.917 - 00:28:19.029, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:28:19.077 - 00:28:24.305, Speaker C: Japan is one of the top three, apparently. Us, Japan, India. Interesting for ETH Global.
00:28:26.165 - 00:28:36.073, Speaker A: I wonder how much of it is, you know. Yeah, I'm just curious, like, what the demographic breakdown is for Japan, because, you know, a lot of the people that come to these hackathons come from other parts of the world correctly.
00:28:36.119 - 00:28:50.021, Speaker C: So that's the sampling bias. So right now we're talking about. So East Global does events in many countries across the world. So when. When they do an event or hackathon in Japan, it's not necessarily Japanese, it's actually people flying all around.
00:28:50.053 - 00:28:51.949, Speaker A: And I know many that have done that, which is.
00:28:52.037 - 00:28:52.261, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:28:52.293 - 00:28:54.045, Speaker C: So there is a bias. Simple bias there.
00:28:54.085 - 00:28:54.613, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:28:54.749 - 00:28:56.957, Speaker C: But India is definitely all Indians.
00:28:57.021 - 00:28:58.509, Speaker A: Yeah. Oh, I know.
00:28:58.597 - 00:28:58.837, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:28:58.861 - 00:29:07.889, Speaker A: You know, because you went there. I went there last year, and there were 2,500, the largest hackathon ETH Global has ever done.
00:29:07.977 - 00:29:09.129, Speaker C: Which city was it?
00:29:09.297 - 00:29:42.635, Speaker A: Bangalore, which is considered Silicon valley of India. 2500 devs, of which 2450 were Indians. No, it's a joke. But I did see some people outside of India, but it was like I could probably count how many people that were outside of India, so they were all Indians. And so, funny enough, I went to. When I landed three days ago in Singapore, CoinDCX, who is the Coinbase of India, hosted like a Consumer day. So I was there.
00:29:42.635 - 00:29:52.615, Speaker A: I gave a talk. They did like this, like, kind of a hacker session. And all of these, all of them are Indian. And they all flew in from India.
00:29:52.915 - 00:30:01.515, Speaker C: For this event, the one in two days, Singapore. Okay. So I saw a lot of Indians in the last couple days.
00:30:01.675 - 00:30:04.923, Speaker A: Well, Singapore has a lot of Indians generally, but I saw a lot of.
00:30:04.939 - 00:30:07.043, Speaker C: Indians who flew from India.
00:30:07.099 - 00:30:21.969, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, the flight's not bad at all. But, yeah, I do think India is a. An emerging country. So we'll see what. What comes out of there.
00:30:21.969 - 00:30:24.753, Speaker A: But there are some interesting products coming from there.
00:30:24.849 - 00:30:27.065, Speaker C: I had a quick chat with Ajit last night.
00:30:27.145 - 00:30:27.745, Speaker A: I did, too.
00:30:27.825 - 00:30:28.441, Speaker C: Our lp.
00:30:28.513 - 00:30:29.009, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:30:29.137 - 00:30:57.565, Speaker C: And he was talking about how Bangalore, like, Bangalore has a lot of founders, crypto founders, but he doesn't think that the best ideas come. Come out of there. He wants the Indian founders who are based in India in Bangalore to spend like three months in New York to get closer to the forefront. Yeah, that's what he told me. But I don't have a strong view there.
00:30:57.905 - 00:31:31.465, Speaker A: I just think that most of the Indians that I've spoken to, they all want to build a startup, but I don't think they have real world startup experience. So they're like net new devs. They're like hackers. Hackers that want to be startup founders is the way I see that archetype. So I think it's less about spending time in New York. Like you could spend three months in New York, that's fine. But I think they just need to cut their teeth and start startups fail and then learn, like, what it is that it takes to build a great startup.
00:31:31.465 - 00:31:33.493, Speaker A: So I think it's more experience.
00:31:33.669 - 00:31:36.285, Speaker C: But you see Vitalik sing the song.
00:31:36.365 - 00:31:39.745, Speaker A: Yeah, he was singing a song and then everyone said, eat to zero again.
00:31:41.825 - 00:31:42.805, Speaker C: Do you agree?
00:31:43.545 - 00:31:49.257, Speaker A: I don't know. I don't know. I really don't know what Vitalik's doing with songs and dancing. That's just the.
00:31:49.321 - 00:31:51.625, Speaker C: It wasn't very founder mode of him.
00:31:51.785 - 00:31:52.649, Speaker A: No, it was.
00:31:52.777 - 00:31:53.937, Speaker C: It was very.
00:31:54.001 - 00:31:57.393, Speaker A: Go ahead, say it. Say it. No, say it.
00:31:57.489 - 00:31:59.009, Speaker C: It was not very founder mode.
00:31:59.137 - 00:31:59.945, Speaker A: Say it.
00:32:00.105 - 00:32:01.585, Speaker C: It was manager mode.
00:32:01.745 - 00:32:02.217, Speaker A: Huh?
00:32:02.281 - 00:32:08.175, Speaker C: No, it was not. Yeah, it was not even manager mode. Neither founder mode or manager mode.
00:32:08.995 - 00:32:12.747, Speaker A: It was. Yeah, it was a mode.
00:32:12.811 - 00:32:13.347, Speaker C: It was a mode.
00:32:13.371 - 00:32:21.907, Speaker A: It was a mode. I don't know, maybe he does these things to go viral, but there was.
00:32:21.931 - 00:32:28.075, Speaker C: Another funny tweet about how ETH BTC went down 24, 25% since Vitaly got a girlfriend.
00:32:28.235 - 00:32:29.455, Speaker A: That he got a girlfriend.
00:32:30.115 - 00:32:36.295, Speaker C: There was. There's rumors of him getting girlfriend a few months ago. BTC down only.
00:32:36.715 - 00:32:37.735, Speaker A: That's great.
00:32:38.235 - 00:32:40.175, Speaker C: But overall, what do you feel about the market?
00:32:40.955 - 00:32:49.587, Speaker A: Yeah, let's talk about the market. 50 bips. Your puts.
00:32:49.691 - 00:32:54.147, Speaker C: Powell calls your puts. Jay Powell has you buy the balls.
00:32:54.211 - 00:32:56.027, Speaker A: He has everyone buy the balls.
00:32:56.211 - 00:32:59.405, Speaker C: Jay Paul is a winner. I love this guy. I don't know.
00:32:59.445 - 00:33:02.317, Speaker A: He would be a part of our program. He was to apply. I would. I would take him in.
00:33:02.341 - 00:33:03.237, Speaker C: He's a founder mode.
00:33:03.301 - 00:33:03.893, Speaker A: He's founder mode.
00:33:03.909 - 00:33:04.517, Speaker C: He's founder mode.
00:33:04.541 - 00:33:05.505, Speaker A: He's founder mode.
00:33:06.085 - 00:33:16.757, Speaker C: He's really entertaining. I love him. I love this guy. And I think he handled the economy really, really well last couple. Like, he's completely screwed up in 2021, 2022 with the inflation.
00:33:16.821 - 00:33:18.501, Speaker A: Do you think that's because of Trump, by the way?
00:33:18.613 - 00:33:40.199, Speaker C: Oh, for sure. Trump is. Trump should be blamed yeah. At least partially for the inflation. I think Biden should be blamed as well because Biden printed like $2 trillion when the economy was rebounding in 2022. But Trump was the one who opened the floodgate in 2021. No one before him printed that much money.
00:33:40.199 - 00:34:02.325, Speaker C: Even close to that much money. Like he printed $3 trillion. It's insane at the bottom of COVID that, like, he should be blamed for sure for. For the inflation. And back then he, Jay Powell was partially a puppet for like, Trump wanted to control the Federal Reserve.
00:34:03.225 - 00:34:10.769, Speaker A: And he did through, like tweets and like, he did, like there's like internal badgering, then there was external tweeting.
00:34:10.897 - 00:34:11.645, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:34:12.425 - 00:34:15.121, Speaker A: Which I think influenced his decision.
00:34:15.313 - 00:34:24.909, Speaker C: But J. Palman, in the last two years, he saved. He fucking engineered the most incredible soft landing slash. No landing of all time.
00:34:24.957 - 00:34:25.413, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:34:25.509 - 00:34:27.949, Speaker C: No one expected him to achieve.
00:34:27.997 - 00:34:29.597, Speaker A: I think the market is so confused by that.
00:34:29.701 - 00:34:30.665, Speaker C: Market is so.
00:34:33.365 - 00:34:37.265, Speaker A: Everyone's confused. I think everyone is confused, including myself.
00:34:38.125 - 00:34:39.341, Speaker C: I think it's very bullish.
00:34:39.453 - 00:34:39.837, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:34:39.901 - 00:34:42.945, Speaker C: 50%, the rate cut cycle is going to be very bullish.
00:34:44.855 - 00:34:48.079, Speaker A: I think it's going to take time for the market to digest.
00:34:48.207 - 00:34:48.887, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:34:49.031 - 00:34:58.535, Speaker C: Hopefully there's no recession. I don't have a view there. You show me the one where Peter Thiel said he was.
00:34:58.615 - 00:35:12.485, Speaker A: Yes. I was actually listening to the all in pod, which is a great. So they had the summit where they had Peter Thiel. They had. Who else? They had Travis Kalanick and J.D.
00:35:12.525 - 00:35:12.941, Speaker C: Vance.
00:35:13.053 - 00:35:17.101, Speaker A: J.D. vance. Some really strong speakers.
00:35:17.213 - 00:35:24.665, Speaker C: Someone told me. I met a guy last night, he went to the Alden Summit. He said it was like the Republican Convention.
00:35:28.045 - 00:35:30.149, Speaker A: Oh, my God. Pretty much.
00:35:30.277 - 00:35:31.105, Speaker C: Pretty much.
00:35:31.525 - 00:35:39.259, Speaker A: So Theo said, you know, my base case, or my contrarian view is that Trump gets elected, but he'll underperform.
00:35:39.427 - 00:35:41.235, Speaker C: Underperform what he wants.
00:35:41.315 - 00:35:55.075, Speaker A: Underperform from what he's mentioned. So. So economy will underperform. And so all the things that he said he would do. It'll never hit. It won't hit. He says.
00:35:55.075 - 00:36:03.729, Speaker A: He also said two, if Kamala and Trump are neck and neck, Kamala is going to win because they will cheat. Cheat or fortify.
00:36:03.867 - 00:36:04.141, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:36:04.173 - 00:36:05.749, Speaker A: Because he had to clean himself up after that.
00:36:05.797 - 00:36:06.425, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:36:07.525 - 00:36:26.625, Speaker A: And I think that's consistent with what we know. Like, we've talked to other, like large, liquid, liquid managers and fund managers, and they all feel the same way that, you know, if it. Well, that there's someone's putting more weight, like Kamala. Like people are putting weight behind Kamala.
00:36:27.525 - 00:36:28.165, Speaker B: Okay.
00:36:28.285 - 00:36:44.895, Speaker A: Like the big money, the corporate sure, yeah. Sponsors, they're putting their weight behind Kamala. And you could see this in the, in the news as well. Right. And so there's that. And then he went on to say that overall, I just think that. And then he was also very bearish.
00:36:44.895 - 00:36:45.675, Speaker A: AI.
00:36:46.055 - 00:36:46.695, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:36:46.815 - 00:36:50.423, Speaker A: Like you could just tell like he was, he was done with AI.
00:36:50.519 - 00:36:50.959, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:36:51.047 - 00:36:56.925, Speaker C: He said AI is right now, AI is the equivalent of the dot com bubble 99, 2000.
00:36:57.015 - 00:37:02.593, Speaker A: Yeah. He's like, who's making money? He goes, the only people that are making money is Nvidia.
00:37:02.689 - 00:37:02.993, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:37:03.049 - 00:37:08.841, Speaker C: He said Nvidia is making over 100% of all the revenue, meaning everyone else is losing money.
00:37:08.873 - 00:37:20.793, Speaker A: Losing money. He goes, everyone's just rappers of rappers. And you know, Nvidia's the he. And then he went on to say, like, you should be building an open AI competitor. You should be building an Nvidia competitor.
00:37:20.889 - 00:37:21.565, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:37:21.945 - 00:37:22.769, Speaker A: Which I agree with.
00:37:22.817 - 00:37:44.091, Speaker C: Nvidia has a lot of startup competitors who are really, really good. I think Nvidia is facing a lot of competition from number one, all these startups that are launching like super hardcore hardware ASICs that are specialized for AI training and inference.
00:37:44.203 - 00:37:44.803, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:37:44.899 - 00:37:50.187, Speaker C: And they're very well funded. Nvidia is gpu. It's not really specialized, it's generalized.
00:37:50.291 - 00:37:50.651, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:37:50.723 - 00:38:08.639, Speaker C: Nvidia's mode is the cuda. It's the software, the software that's on top. Everyone is used to using the CUDA to develop the AI software and the CUDA is probably their biggest moat. But pure hardware wise, the other moat.
00:38:08.687 - 00:38:15.599, Speaker A: That Thiel said is that they've been around since 93. Sure. Time. Lindy.
00:38:15.647 - 00:38:47.809, Speaker C: Yeah, Lindy. The brand. Another less well known mode is Jensen is friends with the CEO of tsm. The fabs, basically. And TSM helped Nvidia a lot when Nvidia struggled a few years. Nvidia actually struggled at least twice in the last few years. The second time was when Ethereum moved from a proof of work to proof of stake.
00:38:47.809 - 00:38:50.229, Speaker C: So all the GPUs went to became useless.
00:38:50.277 - 00:39:09.945, Speaker A: Yeah. But they also made a strategic decision to do that too. I think in terms, and I remember they were hiding the sales under like when they did their filing for the quarterly reporting, they hid the cryptos miners under general sales. And that threw people off guard. Yeah.
00:39:10.645 - 00:39:47.775, Speaker C: So Nvidia is facing a ton of competition from all the competitors, the startup competitors, but also from his own, their own customers. The customers, biggest customers being Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, they're all building their own because they don't want to rely too much. On Nvidia because they're paying too much money. Like exactly what Peter Thiel said. Everyone's paying so much money to Nvidia. So Google tpu for example, is. Google works with a Broadcom to develop their gpu, which is a specialized version hardware for AI.
00:39:47.855 - 00:39:49.695, Speaker A: It's a commodity, right? At this point?
00:39:49.815 - 00:39:51.519, Speaker C: No, not at all.
00:39:51.647 - 00:39:56.695, Speaker A: Meaning like once they develop their own GPUs then it's.
00:39:56.775 - 00:39:59.355, Speaker C: No, it's far from being a commodity.
00:39:59.815 - 00:40:00.519, Speaker A: Tell me more.
00:40:00.607 - 00:40:04.595, Speaker C: Because commodity is usually something that doesn't improve over time.
00:40:05.135 - 00:40:07.519, Speaker A: Oh, in that case, yes, the AI.
00:40:07.607 - 00:40:10.975, Speaker C: Hardware, like it improves extremely fast.
00:40:11.055 - 00:40:11.915, Speaker A: Yes, yes.
00:40:12.775 - 00:40:23.959, Speaker C: Like every 6 to 12 months Nvidia launches a new generation of GPUs and the old ones become obsolete. And everyone is playing this well.
00:40:24.047 - 00:40:53.355, Speaker A: So the way I see it is just like, you know, if you just look at like intel chipsets, amd, they're all neck, neck to neck. Right. So from that perspective I see it as a. Over time if you have the same infrastructure, then it's more or less a commodity is the way I see it. In terms of performance, I think it's going to get upgraded every year or two years. But in terms of developing and manufacturing, it's going to become a commodity.
00:40:54.695 - 00:40:59.175, Speaker C: Personally on the AI side I only hold tsm.
00:40:59.295 - 00:41:02.231, Speaker A: Yeah, that's probably the best at this point.
00:41:02.303 - 00:41:02.791, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:41:02.903 - 00:41:04.431, Speaker A: Because they'll get the business no matter what.
00:41:04.463 - 00:41:04.727, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:41:04.791 - 00:41:33.645, Speaker C: Except if there is a war in the next four years in the Taiwan Strait, then it's over. But then if there is a war in the Taiwan straight in the next four years, then TSM is the least. Is the last thing I worry about. There's going to be world war. Maybe not world war, but like a conflict in Taiwan Strait is going to be worse than Ukraine, Russia and Israel Palestinian sign. It's probably going to be 10x 10x worse. Well, it's because then we're talking about a real.
00:41:34.185 - 00:41:38.385, Speaker A: Well, it adds to the global conflict. Right. I mean people, there's already like proxy wars happening.
00:41:38.425 - 00:41:45.745, Speaker C: But. But then it's going to be a direct conflict between the two super powers. Yeah, it's no longer a proxy war anymore.
00:41:45.825 - 00:41:46.441, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:41:46.593 - 00:41:54.131, Speaker C: Russia, Ukraine is, is the number one superpower against the number three. Number three with which is a late empire.
00:41:54.283 - 00:41:59.135, Speaker A: Yeah, late. So what would you consider China Early.
00:42:03.795 - 00:42:05.491, Speaker C: China is a shitshow right now.
00:42:05.643 - 00:42:06.899, Speaker A: Internally it's all fucked.
00:42:06.987 - 00:42:21.809, Speaker C: It seems like I talked to many founders, many of whom are crypto founders in the last few years and I hear this very consistently from every single one of them that the smartest people are leaving the country.
00:42:21.977 - 00:42:24.737, Speaker A: Well, I mean, okay, I think you.
00:42:24.761 - 00:42:26.401, Speaker C: Saw that, you saw that data. Like.
00:42:26.433 - 00:42:27.905, Speaker A: Yeah. That you tweeted this out.
00:42:27.945 - 00:42:28.605, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:42:29.665 - 00:42:31.305, Speaker A: But if you want to talk about that.
00:42:31.345 - 00:42:31.497, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:42:31.521 - 00:42:41.441, Speaker C: So the, the number of companies that are founded in China in the last 10 years. So it, it peaked in like 18, 19, 20ish.
00:42:41.473 - 00:42:43.321, Speaker A: And then it's been down.
00:42:43.353 - 00:42:43.569, Speaker C: Away.
00:42:43.617 - 00:42:44.249, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:42:44.417 - 00:42:58.273, Speaker C: And some people pointed out that the numbers are incorrect. Sure. The absolute value is probably incorrect but directionally it is absolutely spot. It's very consistent with all the anecdotes I've collected in the last few years.
00:42:58.369 - 00:43:07.625, Speaker A: So I read through that article and they make a point by saying that the fund managers, their LPs are, it's essentially China.
00:43:07.745 - 00:43:08.433, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:43:08.569 - 00:43:39.595, Speaker A: And they, for in China you can't. You have to pay the government back. Like and so they have this clause in the fund mandate that states that you need to have some sort of clause with your startups that they pay you back even if they fail. You have to get paid back. So now it turns out that a lot of these founders are in debt to their LPs and they're now going after their, they're garnishing their wages, they're going after their bank accounts, they're going after their family members to get the money.
00:43:40.975 - 00:43:43.967, Speaker C: Which it's hard to believe but it's.
00:43:43.991 - 00:43:45.367, Speaker A: What the article stated.
00:43:45.511 - 00:43:46.071, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:43:46.183 - 00:43:51.515, Speaker A: But I also think it's something even bigger than that. I think it's because Jack Ma got arrested.
00:43:51.895 - 00:43:54.743, Speaker C: Sure. That was, that was big because he.
00:43:54.759 - 00:44:03.521, Speaker A: Was the pinnacle of. To me like from an outsider. I don't know if this is true internally but like I think he put the startup world and China on the map.
00:44:03.593 - 00:44:04.313, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:44:04.489 - 00:44:28.259, Speaker A: And I, I mean I listened to some his po like his combos and in the early days of my life and I, I thought he was like a pretty big deal in China. And so when you have someone like that that gets shut down by the government, you're then you think to yourself, well I look up to Jack Ma and now Jack Ma is silenced because he was trying to open up to start up ecosystem in China. Why would I want to build here?
00:44:28.347 - 00:44:34.627, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. Even if I become successful, my money is going to be taken away. Yeah, I'm going to be shut down by the government.
00:44:34.691 - 00:44:38.867, Speaker A: So. So those two things I think, I mean obviously I'm sure there's other factors.
00:44:38.931 - 00:44:52.531, Speaker C: There's many, there's. Jacob was a big one but the, yeah, there's many other. Like there's the COVID lockdowns in in 2022. Two years after Covid. That was not good. That crushed people's spirit.
00:44:52.603 - 00:44:53.295, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:44:55.155 - 00:45:29.945, Speaker C: And the government. The government didn't realize it until there were almost violent protests in the street, at which time it was almost too late. There's that and there's. Oh, of course. The big real estate deleveraging in China that crushed the macro economy. I talked to three Hong Kong residents independently in the last few days, and independently, they all tell me that this is the worst they've ever seen in the last 30 to 40 years of Hong Kong in terms of economy.
00:45:30.325 - 00:45:30.925, Speaker A: Hong Kong.
00:45:31.005 - 00:45:33.573, Speaker C: Hong Kong. It's worse than 2009.
00:45:33.709 - 00:45:34.165, Speaker A: Wow.
00:45:34.245 - 00:45:55.913, Speaker C: GFC. So. And one morning I just, you know, I saw my tweet. I tweeted out, you know, most people think Asia is the. Is, you know, the, you know, the 21st century is Asia century. I'm not sure about that.
00:45:55.969 - 00:45:58.765, Speaker A: My contrarian thesis is that I think it'll be India.
00:46:00.105 - 00:46:01.569, Speaker C: Here's my counterpoint.
00:46:01.737 - 00:46:03.085, Speaker A: Give me your counterpoint.
00:46:03.585 - 00:46:08.817, Speaker C: India and China started around the same starting point in. Call it in the 1960s, 70s.
00:46:08.921 - 00:46:09.473, Speaker A: Sure.
00:46:09.609 - 00:46:16.627, Speaker C: Similar population, same similar GDP. This is a question. This is more of a question than a counterpart.
00:46:16.811 - 00:46:17.675, Speaker A: I know, I know.
00:46:17.755 - 00:46:21.499, Speaker C: Why has China gone up so much faster than India?
00:46:21.587 - 00:46:35.907, Speaker A: Because China is heavily centralized. You know, communism, people are all one, which is, I think, a net benefit. And they all kind of align from that perspective.
00:46:35.971 - 00:46:37.615, Speaker C: So you're saying the system works?
00:46:39.675 - 00:46:57.695, Speaker A: It does. Right. Obviously there's negative factors to this, but from that perspective, it does. India, on the other hand, has too many religions, too many dialects. It's harder to get everybody under one, like mission.
00:46:58.475 - 00:47:00.295, Speaker C: Well, what's the percentage of Hindus?
00:47:01.835 - 00:47:20.797, Speaker A: So there's 1.4 billion, of which I think 300 million are Muslims. So let's say 1.1 billion to 1 billion are. But they're in the Hindus. There's. And then there's Punjabi, Sikhs, and there's other six.
00:47:20.821 - 00:47:21.685, Speaker C: Is part of Hindu.
00:47:21.765 - 00:47:22.525, Speaker A: No, they're separate.
00:47:22.565 - 00:47:23.185, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:47:23.925 - 00:47:26.861, Speaker A: And then there's other religious. Christianity. There's.
00:47:27.013 - 00:47:31.029, Speaker C: So there's Bahami. Is Hindus, what, like 50%, 60%?
00:47:31.077 - 00:47:37.909, Speaker A: I'd say over 60%. But even within Hindus, there's different types of castes, right?
00:47:37.957 - 00:47:38.389, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:47:38.477 - 00:47:47.837, Speaker A: There's different groups. Okay, so here's an perfect example. When British came to conquer India, you know why they were able to conquer India so easily? Because they're all infighting.
00:47:47.981 - 00:47:48.745, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:47:49.685 - 00:47:52.065, Speaker C: I mean, that's why they created Pakistan.
00:47:52.365 - 00:48:06.677, Speaker A: Exactly. Right. I mean. I mean, that happened later on because. But in the 60s. But it's just that India is so fragmented that it's easier to conquer, at least for them, but then it's also harder to emerge.
00:48:06.781 - 00:48:13.025, Speaker C: So right now, is there a class war between, like, different religions and also different castes within Hinduism?
00:48:13.525 - 00:48:24.317, Speaker A: I'm not sure about specifically about Hinduism, but I do know there is different wars happening with different religions. Okay, yeah. Within India, there's definitely that.
00:48:24.381 - 00:48:25.025, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:48:25.605 - 00:48:29.265, Speaker C: But then also it's like in the US Like Woke versus.
00:48:29.765 - 00:48:49.275, Speaker A: But India is also not organized. Like, they're. Okay, so they're very corrupt. There's a lot of corruption in India in the government or government, local government, the farmer. I mean, like, across the board, there's a ton of corruption. So Charlie Munger said this famously. He goes.
00:48:49.275 - 00:48:51.831, Speaker A: I'm not quoting him.
00:48:51.983 - 00:48:53.879, Speaker C: He said he's more bullish China than India.
00:48:53.967 - 00:48:56.159, Speaker A: Yes. Because India is just corrupt.
00:48:56.287 - 00:48:56.995, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:48:58.855 - 00:49:00.327, Speaker A: And. And then. But, but.
00:49:00.351 - 00:49:03.895, Speaker C: But India is corrupt in a decentralized way. China is a corrupt in a centralized way.
00:49:03.935 - 00:49:08.967, Speaker A: Exactly. So. So the corruption happens locally, right? Yeah, in India.
00:49:09.031 - 00:49:09.727, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:49:09.911 - 00:49:29.433, Speaker A: So I think from that perspective, India is much more slower in terms of growth. But because China. Because now people are realizing China is becoming a nexus for like, like Foxconn or for Apple. And all the manufacturing that's happened. India, they realize that at least the U.S. they think that they gave too much power to China.
00:49:29.529 - 00:49:29.929, Speaker C: Sure.
00:49:30.017 - 00:49:41.045, Speaker A: So now they're offloading a lot of this into India. So there's a Foxconn in India now? Yeah, there's manufacturing companies that are opening up in India. Vietnam's also a byproduct of that.
00:49:41.085 - 00:49:41.637, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:49:41.781 - 00:49:52.125, Speaker A: But a lot of this is going to India now. And so I do think India will have a big leg of growth. Okay, here's another interesting.
00:49:52.205 - 00:49:54.145, Speaker C: Yeah, but India is not Asia, though.
00:49:54.485 - 00:49:56.477, Speaker A: India is South Asia.
00:49:56.541 - 00:49:59.549, Speaker C: India is your. You have your own continent.
00:49:59.717 - 00:50:03.125, Speaker A: We do, but we're classified in between. Right.
00:50:03.205 - 00:50:08.505, Speaker C: Like, historically, Asia is one continent and India was actually separate.
00:50:09.475 - 00:50:10.787, Speaker A: It kind of got grouped and it.
00:50:10.811 - 00:50:13.123, Speaker C: Collided and it created the Himalayas.
00:50:13.259 - 00:50:13.935, Speaker A: Yes.
00:50:14.595 - 00:50:16.095, Speaker C: Anyway, I'm just.
00:50:20.715 - 00:50:22.695, Speaker A: So do you consider India Asia?
00:50:23.275 - 00:50:28.899, Speaker C: Technically, yes. But do you consider. You don't call yourself Asians. You call yourselves Indians.
00:50:28.947 - 00:50:53.235, Speaker A: Yes, we're considered South Asians. But I mean, there's a lot of interesting influences between the border of India, China, like Nepal and Burma. And so there's interesting, like, Chinese, Indian, like, cuisines and. And religions and stuff like that that I've seen. But I guess going back to.
00:50:53.355 - 00:50:55.323, Speaker C: So why do you say India is the future?
00:50:55.379 - 00:50:58.355, Speaker A: I just think India is going to be up for next leg of growth. I Don't know.
00:50:58.395 - 00:50:58.755, Speaker C: Yeah, sure.
00:50:58.795 - 00:50:59.067, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:50:59.131 - 00:51:05.237, Speaker C: I mean, India is. The trajectory is like they're. They're growing like 10% year on year.
00:51:05.421 - 00:51:07.029, Speaker A: So a lot of growth in India.
00:51:07.117 - 00:51:07.785, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:51:08.085 - 00:51:20.541, Speaker A: In fact, funny enough, my. My cousin in India owns a, like a, like real estate beautician slash plastic surgery.
00:51:20.613 - 00:51:23.485, Speaker C: Oh, you have many cousins? You have, like, many. Probably 100.
00:51:23.605 - 00:51:54.777, Speaker A: Yeah. At this point. But she owns a, like a plastic surgery, like, medical center, whatever you want to call it. And so she only services, like, high class, like, people. Yeah, like, that's her customer base. And she's like, I've seen so many people from the villagers villages that are coming in to get their face done, Botox and skin brightening and all this stuff. And they come in and like, they look like they're homeless, but then they pull out and they have wads of cash.
00:51:54.777 - 00:52:04.741, Speaker A: She's like, I've never really seen this before. And to me, it's just a sign that the economy is growing and a lot of the people that were in poverty are starting to go up to the middle class.
00:52:04.813 - 00:52:05.465, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:52:06.365 - 00:52:23.897, Speaker A: And my aunt, My aunt, she just came from India who visited me a month ago. She's like, imran, I just bought, like, me. My. Your family members bought a bunch of plots or land in India over the past 12 months at 3x in price. I'm like, why don't you tell me about this? Like, I wanted to buy it.
00:52:23.961 - 00:52:24.257, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:52:24.321 - 00:52:29.713, Speaker A: But so I'm just hearing this stuff from the inside. And to me it seems like, yeah.
00:52:29.809 - 00:52:31.225, Speaker C: I don't know, India is doing well.
00:52:31.305 - 00:52:32.313, Speaker A: India's doing really well.
00:52:32.369 - 00:52:32.937, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:52:33.081 - 00:52:50.765, Speaker A: Now I could see them becoming a part of. I mean, they're already part of the global superpower, but there could. They could have more influence over time. All right, we're at time. I have to do this podcast with Ansem, iggy and Joe McCann.
00:52:51.865 - 00:52:52.745, Speaker C: When? What time?
00:52:52.825 - 00:52:54.537, Speaker A: I gotta be there by 11:00.

00:52:57.601 - 00:52:58.489, Speaker C: The Shikhwin panel.
00:52:58.537 - 00:52:59.805, Speaker A: It's a Shikhwin panel.
00:53:00.905 - 00:53:03.497, Speaker C: You, Iggy and Macan.
00:53:03.561 - 00:53:03.977, Speaker A: Yes.
00:53:04.081 - 00:53:04.297, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:53:04.321 - 00:53:05.225, Speaker C: The shitcoin panel.
00:53:05.345 - 00:53:10.485, Speaker A: Panel. What should we talk about? What do you want to hear?
00:53:11.265 - 00:53:19.235, Speaker C: I want to get Alphas, which. Oh, actually, I want to. I want to know what. What's. What Iggy's plans are for. For Mother.
00:53:19.395 - 00:53:22.203, Speaker A: Okay. Iggy plans for Mother.
00:53:22.259 - 00:53:22.899, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:53:23.067 - 00:53:28.683, Speaker A: Because I feel like she's the first celebrity token that has some legs and.
00:53:28.699 - 00:53:29.939, Speaker C: The only one so far, I think.
00:53:30.027 - 00:53:35.603, Speaker A: And we were bullish. Remember three, three, four episodes ago, we talked about why Iggy could be.
00:53:35.699 - 00:53:37.811, Speaker C: I Mean, she's still working on it, which is incredible.
00:53:37.883 - 00:53:38.107, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:53:38.131 - 00:53:38.617, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:53:38.731 - 00:53:40.077, Speaker C: Although the press has been.
00:53:40.221 - 00:53:54.645, Speaker A: No, it did well. Like, I mean, obviously from 100mil to now went to like 20mil. Now it's sitting around 50mil. But things are looking pretty good. She ended up not. She's not speaking at salon event either. You hear about the drama?
00:53:54.725 - 00:53:55.189, Speaker C: What happened?
00:53:55.237 - 00:53:59.917, Speaker A: She wanted some dancers to come and dance before her talk or whatever. They wouldn't allow it.
00:53:59.981 - 00:54:00.605, Speaker C: Why not?
00:54:00.725 - 00:54:06.059, Speaker A: I don't know. So she's kind of upset about that.
00:54:06.107 - 00:54:06.651, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:54:06.803 - 00:54:11.215, Speaker A: Okay, so you want to know what's the future mother token? Some alpha. What else?
00:54:14.115 - 00:54:33.417, Speaker C: I'm curious what she thinks of Only Fans, because yesterday or last week I did some research on only fans versus athletes, but I showed you the. The stats. The top 5 only fans creators earn as much. Earn as much money as the top athletes of any sports. So that includes Cristiano Ronaldo.
00:54:33.481 - 00:54:33.817, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:54:33.881 - 00:54:54.689, Speaker C: Messi, Steph Curry, and a couple others in other sports. But anyway, the OnlyFans creators earn as much, as much money as Ronaldo and apparently. So Iggy is actually one of the top five earners. I didn't realize. I didn't know her until, like, she asked her.
00:54:54.817 - 00:54:56.417, Speaker A: So what does she think about it? Yeah.
00:54:56.521 - 00:54:59.845, Speaker C: Like, why. Like, what's. What's the thing with OnlyFans?
00:55:00.145 - 00:55:12.561, Speaker A: Cool. All right, well, that's. We're at time. I know. We have to record our pod with Nick Carter coming up on Saturday. That'll be fun. But, yeah, thanks for tuning in.
