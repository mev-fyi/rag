00:00:00.320 - 00:00:04.074, Speaker A: Welcome to good game. Your no. B's insights for crypto founders.
00:00:07.534 - 00:00:43.246, Speaker B: Boring types of assets, but assets that, like, don't have liquid secondary markets and, like, don't have that many players that are securitizing them. In traditional finance, think about like, auto loan market, SMB, receivables, trade financing. Like, these types of things that aren't like, as huge as, like, treasuries or mortgage backed securities or like high pay corporate debt, but are maybe a little sleepier, probably a little more efficient cost structures. That's kind of like where I think, like protocols will maybe have. And the crowdsourcing that comes with protocols might have, like, the biggest efficiency gains.
00:00:43.390 - 00:01:15.330, Speaker A: Looking for your next startup idea in crypto? Check out our request for startups list and get inspired at Alliance XYZ ideas. Welcome to good game. We took some time off. I think it's important, especially running this podcast for over a year now, that we take some time off and start to do some deep research and understanding where we see the future. And we also had a demo day with alliance, which turned out to be incredible for the founders that we're backing. So overall, I thought it was fun and good to take some time off.
00:01:15.442 - 00:01:17.382, Speaker C: So what are we going to talk about today? Imran?
00:01:17.498 - 00:01:19.670, Speaker A: Uh, real world assets?
00:01:19.862 - 00:01:20.518, Speaker D: Yes.
00:01:20.646 - 00:01:39.382, Speaker A: I see a lot of tweets every day about it and why it's the future of finance. You have the chain link marines that are gearing up for their narrative. I hear it humming. I hear it humming. They've been wanting a narrative for a very long time. They're dying, and they need it. And I think we might have one for them.
00:01:39.382 - 00:02:30.944, Speaker A: You could see Sergey, you know, going on to many, many podcasts and talking about how Chainlink will enable traditional finance on chain. You're starting to see Robert Leshner, who launched his company Superstate, which we can talk a bit more about. We're seeing some uptick in some of the Defi protocols that have launched around the real world asset space, such as Ondo and others that have upticked in volume, including Makerdao. And it seems like all the signals to me is pointing up. But the question is, what is this space? How does it look like? Where does it go? What's the regulatory framework look like, and where should founders build? And so those are the things that I'm thinking about as we talk about rwas. How do you feel about real world assets? I mean, to me, I'll be quite frank, doing research around real world assets. And all of that was very boring.
00:02:30.944 - 00:02:34.508, Speaker A: I don't know what it is.
00:02:34.636 - 00:02:43.568, Speaker C: By definition, it's a boring asset class like trap fight by definition for us. But you know what that implies about you, Imran? That means you're not a boomer.
00:02:43.656 - 00:03:15.504, Speaker A: Oh, well, that's great news. But yeah, I guess when you talk about friend, tech, or, I don't know, yoloing into Harry Potter, Obama, sonic and others, there's certain types of synapses that go off in my brain that gets me excited. But then when you talk about yoloing into treasury bills, I don't know, corporate stocks or corporate bonds or municipal bonds, I mean, I start yawning.
00:03:16.204 - 00:04:22.214, Speaker C: So I did a lot of research, and I share your feeling, but the research was also pretty illuminating. So, obviously, a few months ago, we talked about rwas, and we said that our view actually evolved over time and what really triggered that evolution. So previously, we were actually fairly bearish. But what triggered a change of mind was a few months ago when we saw Maker and the collateral that underlies Dai growing at an extremely rapid pace. So, to give you some data, around December and January, December 2022 and January 2023, the dollar amount of RWas that is in maker that backs diet, the stablecoin, has grown from basically zero to $3 billion. $3 billion in less than a year. And then at the same time, we've seen protocols like Ondo that you mentioned and others that have grown their TVL to over $100 million very quickly.
00:04:22.214 - 00:04:53.610, Speaker C: And so these data points, which cannot ignore them. And on top of that, there's an elephant in the room, which is stablecoins. Obviously, stablecoins are an RWA because it's tokenized us dollar, right? And so Peter Johnson from BH Digital, he published a research paper on stablecoins a few months ago, and there are some really interesting findings. I'll quote him. For example, in 2022, stablecoin settled over $11 trillion on chain. 11 trillion?
00:04:53.762 - 00:04:54.534, Speaker D: That's insane.
00:04:54.634 - 00:05:28.442, Speaker C: That's insane. Dwarfing the volumes processed by PayPal, which is 1.4 trillion, almost surpassing the payment volume of visa, which is 11 trillion and reaching 14% of the volume settled by ACH and 1% of the volume settled by Fed wire. It is remarkable that in just a few years, a new global money movement, rail, can be compared to some of the world's largest and most important payment system. So that's one. And I'll also quote a few very interesting anecdotes from anecdotal data points from that report. And that might really surprise our audience.
00:05:28.442 - 00:06:14.728, Speaker C: Just for fun, okay, now, given what I just said, the audience could argue that, well, you know, probably much of the $11 trillion that's settled on chain is for speculative reasons. They're like, I don't know, like people settling stable coins on a centralized exchange and then trading and stuff like that, and then, you know, participating in yields and stuff like that. Sure, you can argue that, and it's probably true. But here's another really interesting data point. Again, I'm quoting Peter. Stablecoin usage has decoupled from crypto exchange volumes, indicating that significant stablecoin transaction volumes may be driven by non trading and speculative activity. Since December 2021, centralized exchanges volumes are down 64%, and decentralized exchange volumes are down 60%.
00:06:14.728 - 00:06:25.636, Speaker C: During the same period, stablecoin volumes are only down 11%. And weekly active stablecoin addresses and transactions are up 25%.
00:06:25.740 - 00:06:26.892, Speaker D: Product market fit.
00:06:27.028 - 00:06:31.844, Speaker C: Product market fit. And I'm going to share some more interesting data points just for fun.
00:06:31.964 - 00:06:32.724, Speaker D: Okay.
00:06:32.884 - 00:07:04.692, Speaker C: The majority of stablecoin activity uses tether. Tether represents 69% of stablecoin supply and accounting for 80% of weekly active addresses. This is not surprising, right? But it is still fun. Like, most people expect USDC to be the dominant player, but it is actually tethered today. And a lot of that has had to do with the banking crisis earlier this year, in April, and USDC deep pegged from that. Another really interesting data point. Most stablecoin activity occurs on the TRON and BSc blockchains.
00:07:04.788 - 00:07:06.076, Speaker A: Mic drop, Justin.
00:07:06.220 - 00:07:16.960, Speaker C: Mic dropped Justin. Year to date, the TRON and BSc blockchains collectively account for 77% of weekly active addresses, 75% of transactions, and 41% of volumes.
00:07:17.032 - 00:07:26.360, Speaker A: How did Tron get there? I'm very surprised. Like, they did know, like, direct marketing. And where is this happening? Is this latam?
00:07:26.472 - 00:07:26.744, Speaker D: No.
00:07:26.784 - 00:07:38.712, Speaker C: Okay, so there's arguments and counter arguments or data points against them for. So the argument against TRON is, okay, maybe most of that volume is just Justin's own wallet.
00:07:38.808 - 00:07:39.016, Speaker D: Right?
00:07:39.040 - 00:08:27.752, Speaker C: Like, just creating fake transactions. I have no idea if that's true or not, but people have said that the counterpoint is, we know for a fact from talking to Felipe, who's building Cravada, who's part of our program. Cravada, by the way, is a fiat on our ramp for Latin America. He's very deep in that market, and he told us that Tron USDT is by far the number one crypto payment that is used in Latin America. The way people do, the way people transact with each other is people go to, like, finance, peer to peer, and then they initiate a transaction, person on binance, peer to peer, and then they meet each other in person to give each other TroN USDT and also fiat back. So they use like native Tron wallet. So I don't know, the adoption seems real.
00:08:27.888 - 00:08:41.092, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm very, I mean, like, obviously we'll have to do more research on this, but how did Tron get a foothold into that market and other markets as well? It's just something that I'd love to do more research on and get insights on.
00:08:41.228 - 00:09:03.464, Speaker C: And for those who are listening that are building any sort of crypto payment startups, talk to us. We are extremely bullish. And I think that obviously in the past five to ten years, there have been many attempts at crypto payments businesses and they all failed. There is a historical reason for that. I think, for example, many years ago you invested in a latin american remittance and payment.
00:09:03.624 - 00:09:04.744, Speaker A: Yeah, five years ago.
00:09:04.864 - 00:09:25.792, Speaker C: Five years ago. But what changed in the last five years? Well, there are two things that changed. One is five years ago bitcoin was the only liquid settlement layer. And bitcoin is not really a good settlement layer for two reasons. One is the price is very volatile, and two, the block time is very long. It's quite long. It takes an hour to really fully settle.
00:09:25.792 - 00:09:40.282, Speaker C: And the second reason is, well, obviously the stable coins have really taken off. So today there are enough wallets and enough on chain wealth that is stored in stablecoins. And now we really have a critical mass of users that can pay each other.
00:09:40.378 - 00:10:01.798, Speaker A: Im going to throw a third reason too, which is the infrastructure that enables this to happen. Heres a good example. The startup that I invested in five years ago, back then there was a very different mindset where everything had to be built on bitcoin. Bitcoin was the de facto way to build around. It created a lot of mind share because bitcoin was kind of pretty dominant at that point.
00:10:01.926 - 00:10:02.526, Speaker D: That's number one.
00:10:02.550 - 00:10:15.342, Speaker A: Number two is there wasn't enough stablecoin activity to really deem any one stable coin successful. So the founder that I invested in also built their own type of stablecoin that's backed by BTC.
00:10:15.478 - 00:10:15.990, Speaker D: Right.
00:10:16.102 - 00:10:42.504, Speaker A: So that's number two. The number three is there was no on and off ramps in LATaM, so they also had to build their own on and off ramp in LATam. And in LATAm there's, you know, 30 plus countries that all have different jurisdictions that have all different legal requirements around how on and off ramps should be processed, and different banking systems different banks, different banking systems. So that was number three.
00:10:42.584 - 00:10:43.204, Speaker D: Right.
00:10:43.704 - 00:11:10.318, Speaker A: Let's start number four, crypto infrastructure. Right. We didn't have account obstructed wallets. We didn't have on and off ramps that was directly integrated with wallets, et cetera, et cetera. And I feel as if all of those have been validated now and there is a decent solution for it. And that's one of the reasons why Cravada, who was a part of our last batch, is really solving that across the LAtAM market, and they grew 20 times this year.
00:11:10.446 - 00:11:10.830, Speaker D: That's right.
00:11:10.862 - 00:11:14.322, Speaker C: That just goes to show the amount of demand for stable coins.
00:11:14.478 - 00:11:15.186, Speaker D: That's right.
00:11:15.290 - 00:11:16.986, Speaker C: US dollar stablecoins, Latin.
00:11:17.090 - 00:11:32.530, Speaker A: That's right. So I think with all of that being solved now, we have a real world asset that is finding utility, and there's, and they're commercializing that utility through products and startups, which is what some of these startups that we're talking to are doing, which is cross border.
00:11:32.602 - 00:12:11.302, Speaker C: There's a broader, very important point about what you just said, which is timing matters. In my over ten years of observing crypto products and startup ideas, I don't think I've seen like actually bad ideas, but most ideas that failed actually were just too early. And so stablecoin is an example, but another really good example is basically the rest of the RWAs, all the real world assets. Because if you think about it, okay, you can be, we can all be really bullish on rwas, but if you really think about it, every asset that you see in front of you, like including this computer that you're watching this podcast from.
00:12:11.438 - 00:12:11.998, Speaker D: Right?
00:12:12.126 - 00:12:58.476, Speaker C: Like it can be tokenized, of course. But does it actually make sense to tokenize this computer today? Maybe at some point, yes, but today, of course not, right? So there is a path dependency. And there's a thing about timing, which is why stablecoins has worked really well so far. And the next obvious one that has worked is on chain treasuries, which you mentioned. T bills, basically ust bills, which you mentioned, that Ondon and others, have gotten pretty good traction. And then the next obvious question is, what are some of the other asset classes for which it makes sense to tokenize today? And in order to answer this question, we need to critically ask ourselves, where does the demand come from? Because demand, I think, is actually the number one problem, the number one hurdle. The other hurdle is the legal, the custodian, all that stuff, the actual solution.
00:12:58.476 - 00:13:16.456, Speaker C: How do you solve this problem? How do you put stuff on chain? But before that can even be thought about. You need to think about the demand. Where does the demand come from? If we tokenize real estate, who buys that? Like, if you're tokenized a single property, by the way, here's another really interesting attic build, which is David. David on our team.
00:13:16.600 - 00:13:17.432, Speaker A: David Ma.
00:13:17.568 - 00:13:23.560, Speaker C: David Ma on our team. He built a tokenized real estate startup back in 2017.
00:13:23.712 - 00:13:25.648, Speaker A: He did? Oh, I didn't know that.
00:13:25.696 - 00:13:27.560, Speaker C: Then they pivoted into the AI startup.
00:13:27.592 - 00:13:28.320, Speaker A: Oh, that's right.
00:13:28.432 - 00:14:07.138, Speaker C: For 60 million. But their first idea was tokenized real estate and it didn't work out. And asked David, why do you think that didn't work? I think he said something to the effect of if you tokenize individual properties, there's just no liquidity. People don't want to have exposure to individual properties, because if you want exposure to individual properties, you can just buy stuff. You can just buy a property on zillow or whatever, just find a real estate agent and buy from them. But when you're someone who's on chain, you have some money and you want to diversify that money into, you want to buy something with the money. What you want is not exposure to a single property.
00:14:07.138 - 00:14:24.822, Speaker C: What you want maybe is exposure to a broad group of real estates, let's say real estate in New York, real estate in Chicago, and then you can long New York and short Chicago and so on, so forth. So point being, we need to ask ourselves, is the timing right for a given asset class?
00:14:24.958 - 00:15:21.268, Speaker A: Well, I will argue that I think the timing is right to tokenize treasury bills and it might be the right narrative or tailwind that RWAs need outside of stable coins to grow the asset class. You could say that the macro backdrop, if you look at the macro backdrop, Powells increasing rates, and this is fundamentally hurting all of the risk on assets like crypto. Right. In fact, it's crushing it compared to what's happening in any other market. But you could also flip it and say that, well, because there's no yield, the decent yield on chain, the yield that's coming from treasury bills, if tokenized properly, could be a way to bring in more tvl into the broader crypto ecosystem. And in fact, that could bring be a tailwind for other startups to build around this ecosystem and start to grow from that perspective. And I think that's why we're getting a lot of narrative.
00:15:21.268 - 00:15:25.492, Speaker A: The narrative buildup on real world assets is starting to increase. It's because of that.
00:15:25.628 - 00:15:26.132, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:15:26.228 - 00:15:55.918, Speaker C: So I mean, again, timing matters because if you started, which is a t bill tokenization platform. Five years ago, you wouldn't have worked because the federal fund rate was zero five years ago, but now it's five. And if you can get 5% on chain, whereas on avid and compound, you can only get, by the way, like zero one or 2%. Of course you're going to pick the t bill. The on chain t bill, because it's higher rate, is actually safer from a duration point of view, and you're not taking any smart contract risk.
00:15:56.046 - 00:16:15.510, Speaker A: And if you think about it, I also think the other reason for this is like, yeah, I mean, if you're just holding dollars right now, it's fine, but you're still like, there's an opportunity cost that you're losing by not doing t bills. And if there's $38 billion, I think I saw the number on DeFi llama, $38 billion in TBL, let's say. I mean, that's $38 billion, that's not earning a yield.
00:16:15.622 - 00:16:16.182, Speaker D: Right.
00:16:16.318 - 00:16:42.034, Speaker A: And so they're switching costs in getting that money out off ramp and then being able to go to a bank or brokerage and buying that, they're switching time costs. There's a lot of issues with doing that. There is no seamless process, and there is a chance that there are security issues and vulnerabilities, too, by doing this, especially large sums of money. So it actually really makes sense for some of that money to go into RWAS, which makes it easier from a switching cost perspective.
00:16:42.154 - 00:17:22.356, Speaker C: If I could rephrase what you said. Well, actually, I'm just going to quote David again, because I've been talking to David a lot about this. If I could summarize the thesis behind RWAs. Basically, the question is, what would be the potential reasons for RWAS product market fit? Well, there's two sides of the same coin, number one. One side of the coin is you have a lot of this on chain non KYC wealth that needs diversification. So you and me and maybe some organizations and those, we have some money on chain. We historically, over the last 15 years, we went from BTC, then to ETH, then to stables, then to treasuries, and then the natural.
00:17:22.356 - 00:17:44.728, Speaker C: Next question is, what else can we diversify into? So, obviously, you can have a bunch of other real world assets on chain that we can potentially diversify into. So the need comes from on chain treasury diversification. And then the other side of the same coin is the RWAs is basically a way for traditional assets to tap into cheaper liquidity sources.
00:17:44.856 - 00:17:45.424, Speaker D: Yes.
00:17:45.544 - 00:18:01.562, Speaker C: Or adverse selection, so to speak. What that means is, if you're a trapfire person or organization, you can't raise money in that world. Well, why don't you just tap into the degen liquidity on chain? Because that money is less informed and they wouldn't append to anything.
00:18:01.658 - 00:18:02.226, Speaker D: Right.
00:18:02.370 - 00:18:24.010, Speaker C: So these are two coins, two sides of the same coin, because one side is supplied, the other side is demand, and they match perfectly with each other. So that's the thesis behind RWAs. Now, again, back to timing. Is the timing right for a given asset class in run up? And curious what you think, but let's go through a list of asset classes, and then we can share our thoughts. So, first one.
00:18:24.122 - 00:18:24.922, Speaker D: I don't know.
00:18:25.058 - 00:18:25.706, Speaker C: Bonds.
00:18:25.810 - 00:18:26.562, Speaker D: Bonds?
00:18:26.698 - 00:18:31.514, Speaker C: What kind of bonds, by the way? Like commercial debt. Real, like, obviously, us government bonds.
00:18:31.554 - 00:18:32.274, Speaker A: Commercial?
00:18:32.434 - 00:18:33.174, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:18:34.234 - 00:18:35.802, Speaker A: I mean, us, too.
00:18:35.978 - 00:18:40.786, Speaker C: I don't know, to be honest. Because us treasuries is already 5%.
00:18:40.930 - 00:18:41.730, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:18:41.922 - 00:18:48.520, Speaker C: With commercial, like bonds, like corporate bonds, maybe you can yield a little bit more than that by taking on extra risk.
00:18:48.632 - 00:18:49.816, Speaker D: But it's. I mean.
00:18:49.840 - 00:19:02.104, Speaker C: Yes. So corporate bonds offers you a combination of two risks. The first risk is the federal fund rate plus some default risk. So it does offer something new. So maybe. Yeah, maybe. Maybe some people will want it.
00:19:02.184 - 00:19:03.004, Speaker D: I don't know.
00:19:03.504 - 00:19:04.484, Speaker C: I'm not sure.
00:19:04.824 - 00:19:07.008, Speaker A: I'm looking at one of the pools here.
00:19:07.136 - 00:19:20.822, Speaker C: I've seen a pool with AbS asset backed securities, which is really djen. I don't know how they did it, but they tokenized. I think it was on centrifuge and one of the vaults on centrifuge.
00:19:20.878 - 00:19:22.750, Speaker A: Oh, it was centrifuge.
00:19:22.862 - 00:19:25.670, Speaker D: Yeah. And it's.
00:19:25.702 - 00:19:30.414, Speaker C: By the way, it's. I think. I'm not 100% sure, but that vault is used by maker.
00:19:30.534 - 00:19:31.062, Speaker D: Yes.
00:19:31.158 - 00:19:33.310, Speaker A: The die. Yeah, yeah, I saw that.
00:19:33.382 - 00:19:33.662, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:19:33.718 - 00:19:35.870, Speaker A: I mean, I did see commercial real estate also.
00:19:36.022 - 00:19:39.550, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. Related emerging markets.
00:19:39.622 - 00:20:05.914, Speaker A: Emerging markets at 10% structured credit, 4% real estate, around 8% commercial real estate. So there's some, like, interesting yield opportunities. But, I mean, obviously they all come with their own risk parameters. Yeah, but that increases the yield opportunity, because if you think about what drove Defi summer was primarily yield, wasn't it? Like, people would just compare different yield opportunities.
00:20:06.414 - 00:20:07.110, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly.
00:20:07.182 - 00:20:08.846, Speaker A: I mean, it was a different time. It was a different time.
00:20:08.910 - 00:20:09.134, Speaker D: Right.
00:20:09.174 - 00:20:14.894, Speaker C: 10,000. 10,0000% yield versus 100% yield, like the rebasing stable coins.
00:20:17.034 - 00:20:17.666, Speaker A: Good times.
00:20:17.730 - 00:20:29.214, Speaker C: Oh, Imran, here's a few fun ones, because we went through a bunch of boring ones, like the trap eye boomer stuff. But here's a few fun ones. Pokemon cards and magic the gathering cards and Michael Jordan cards.
00:20:29.634 - 00:21:01.444, Speaker A: Yes. Obviously, we chatted offline about this, but I'm quite bullish on at least cards because I'm a pretty big collector of Jordan. I own a lot of his cards. And some of the biggest issues that I have with holding cards at home is the fact that they could damage. They can get damaged by humidity, heat, etcetera. And it could get stolen, and it could get damaged, too. Like, if you have pets or kids, you have to store it somewhere safe.
00:21:01.444 - 00:21:40.514, Speaker A: And so there's a lot of risk involved in storing this at home. And so having a custodian that could store it in a very cost effective way that can also keep the quality high, like, temperature controlled rooms secured within some sort of, like, vault, and having some sort of digital representation on the Internet, like an NFT that is backed by this company, like brinks, could give me the optionality to sell it if I want to sell it quickly or borrow against it if I want to borrow against it or do other things like show up, showing it off. So I do think there is some value in, like, holding, like, very high valued collectibles.
00:21:40.554 - 00:21:43.186, Speaker D: Like. Like Jordan. Yeah. You're a Pokemon.
00:21:43.250 - 00:21:50.698, Speaker A: Weren't you a magic the gathering? Like, weren't you involved in trading those cards? I mean, let the community know. Let the people know.
00:21:50.866 - 00:21:57.858, Speaker C: When I was in high school, I was extremely poor. All my friends play the gathering with real cards. Real magic the gathering cards.
00:21:57.946 - 00:21:58.258, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:21:58.306 - 00:22:04.948, Speaker C: I wanted to play with them, but I didn't have the money to buy the real cards. I just printed them. I printed the cards black and white.
00:22:05.036 - 00:22:07.744, Speaker A: So you did what Powell would do at this point, right?
00:22:10.324 - 00:22:11.028, Speaker D: So, yes.
00:22:11.116 - 00:22:18.724, Speaker C: The thing with all these, like, you know, magic the gathering or Pokemon or Michael Jordan, is it taps into your. Your childhood, your nostalgia.
00:22:18.804 - 00:22:19.180, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:22:19.252 - 00:22:24.924, Speaker C: By the way, have you seen, like, how much magic the gathering cards have appreciated in the last 2030 years?
00:22:25.004 - 00:22:25.894, Speaker A: I have not.
00:22:26.044 - 00:22:39.978, Speaker C: When I was in high school at Black Lotus, for those who are into gathering, black Lotus is the most expensive card in magic the gathering. I don't know if it's still the case today, but it was $700.20 years ago. Today, it's like five figures.
00:22:40.146 - 00:22:41.018, Speaker A: Geez.
00:22:41.186 - 00:22:41.658, Speaker D: And.
00:22:41.746 - 00:23:04.988, Speaker C: And, you know, why? Like, I thought about this for a long time, and I finally realized that that why that has appreciated so much, which is that when we were young, we were all poor. But as all of us, that generation, like millennials or whatever, the boomers are in their thirties or forties or whatever, they now have some wealth, and they want to go back to their childhood and buy that stuff.
00:23:05.116 - 00:23:05.708, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:23:05.836 - 00:23:07.744, Speaker C: And so. Yeah.
00:23:09.844 - 00:23:10.580, Speaker D: That'S a good idea.
00:23:10.612 - 00:23:13.492, Speaker C: I would own a tokenized magic that got black lotus.
00:23:13.628 - 00:23:13.988, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:23:14.036 - 00:23:15.812, Speaker A: Or a charizard for pokemon.
00:23:15.908 - 00:23:16.824, Speaker C: Charizard.
00:23:17.124 - 00:23:29.786, Speaker A: I mean, I collected Pokemon cards, and charizard was the one I always wanted. So, yeah, I think just to go back to nostalgia, I would definitely buy one of those. I would buy charizard. Tokenized charizard.
00:23:29.930 - 00:23:30.514, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:23:30.634 - 00:23:42.170, Speaker C: Oh, by the way, magic Eden, they announced this product, like, last week or something where people can buy pretty rare Pokemon cards. I saw charizard one. A very rare one.
00:23:42.282 - 00:23:42.882, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:23:43.018 - 00:23:50.770, Speaker A: Interesting. On a side note, the biggest bearish person that I know about crypto is Nikita bear.
00:23:50.922 - 00:23:51.306, Speaker D: Right.
00:23:51.370 - 00:24:08.010, Speaker A: Like, people call him the product God, and maybe he is, but he's probably the biggest bear in crypto. There's an interesting tweet that he just shared that said, I don't believe in crypto, but with the debt levels where they are at and world war three unfolding, I'm not sure what else I can believe in.
00:24:08.122 - 00:24:08.770, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:24:08.922 - 00:24:10.058, Speaker A: Crypto is the end state.
00:24:10.186 - 00:24:23.968, Speaker C: By the way, gold went back to $2,000 today. I know this is a boomer asset class. You don't care about it, but gold just went back to almost all time high, flirting with all time high. I think some people on chain would want to own some gold tokenized gold.
00:24:24.056 - 00:24:24.536, Speaker D: They do.
00:24:24.600 - 00:24:31.712, Speaker A: And I think PAX. Paxful. Pax has Pax gold. There's Pax gold. So there is some. And I think that's. It's in the rc 20.
00:24:31.712 - 00:24:48.000, Speaker A: So you can actually buy that on uniswap. Yep. From what I remember, that's another. I mean, I'm just thinking about the demand. Like, the story I was trying to put to this is like, you know, with World War. Let's say what Nikita Bear says. Okay, World War three, I have no other asset class I want to hold.
00:24:48.152 - 00:24:48.904, Speaker D: But bitcoin.
00:24:48.984 - 00:25:05.244, Speaker A: Right. Because it's a global currency. What's his name? Fink. The Larry Fink from. Yeah. He also said out of bitcoin, he pumped it so well that I just went and bought one spot, BTC, just. Just for him.
00:25:05.244 - 00:25:40.588, Speaker A: But if you think about it, there's the macro headwinds. And the macro headwinds right now is raising interest rates. That makes sense. We're all yield chasers, and we're going to run to t bills. But the other larger macro backdrop is what's happening in other parts of the world, and there isn't a one unified currency that anyone can purchase right now. And I think thats obviously going to be bitcoin. And thats what Larry Fink said recently about bitcoin.
00:25:40.588 - 00:25:51.172, Speaker A: And thats another large narrative driver that was going to bring these investors into bitcoin and on chain activity. So its interesting to see where all of this goes in the future.
00:25:51.308 - 00:25:51.836, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:25:51.940 - 00:25:58.124, Speaker C: Heres one last fun one. What do you think of carbon credits? Because technically that is also a real world asset.
00:25:58.244 - 00:25:58.904, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:25:59.364 - 00:26:46.270, Speaker A: Glow is David's company. And another thing that there's the concept of tracking carbon offsets and then burning carbon offsets to show that different companies can run carbon neutral. As an example, many companies run carbon plus, so they're emitting a lot of carbon. And that could be bad for the environment, as an example. And so what these companies do is they purchase carbon offsets as a way to offset the carbon that theyre emitting. So thats the way carbon offsets work. So there are startups like Glo that are tokenizing carbon offsets so that enterprises and companies could buy that carbon offset and burn it, as an example, so that theyre carbon neutral.
00:26:46.422 - 00:27:48.146, Speaker C: And they have real traction from real demand from hedge funds and other companies asking for on chain carbon credits. And the idea of tokenized carbon credits is very interesting for another reason, which is that I wrote about this a few months ago. One potential bear case for tokenized assets is that if that asset, that if it's a traditional, traditional finance asset, already has a very liquid secondary market, let's say stocks, it's less likely for it to succeed on chain because there's already a very liquid marketplace for people to trade. But if there's an asset class for which there's not LRI, already a very liquid secondary marketplace, then the value proposition of putting it on chain all of a sudden becomes extremely large because you can just trade it on permissionless protocols like Uniswap, let's say. That's why tokenized carbon credits is really interesting because carbon credits doesn't already have a very liquid secondary market in the real world.
00:27:48.290 - 00:27:49.082, Speaker D: Interesting.
00:27:49.218 - 00:28:10.032, Speaker A: There's some things that you said that stood out to me. One is like, if I want to buy carbon offset credits, I don't even know where to, where to start exactly. And from what I've read and heard, there are a couple marketplaces for carbon offset credits, and the prices are all over the place. That's number two. Number three is the quality of the carbon offset credit. We don't know the rating of the carbon offset credit.
00:28:10.088 - 00:28:10.352, Speaker D: Right.
00:28:10.408 - 00:28:38.182, Speaker A: Is it really 100% tracking the carbon offset of where it was originated from. So they have a. A third party company that values these carbon offsets to determine whether the quality is high or low. And then it gets put on a marketplace, right? And then people can, companies like Microsoft and others could purchase this and show to the public that they're carbon neutral. But there isn't really a way to track any of this. It's done all off chain. It's done through paperwork.
00:28:38.182 - 00:28:56.072, Speaker A: Somebody comes in and investigates and does this. But you could do all of this on chain, put it up on a layer, one like Ethereum or on Uniswap, and allow the market to provide discovery in terms of pricing, and create one unified marketplace. That's very easy. That sounds really cool to me.
00:28:56.168 - 00:28:57.536, Speaker D: Yep, 100%.
00:28:57.680 - 00:29:01.484, Speaker A: And you could buy it, and then you could get a loan against it.
00:29:01.864 - 00:29:29.028, Speaker C: And by the way, this is the other really important value prop of RWAS, which is composability with the other Defi protocols. So imagine you have, hypothetically, you have Apple shares on chain. Well, now you can put it on Aave and. Or not aave specifically, but a permissionless lending protocol, and borrow some money against it, which is much harder in tribe five, by the way. You can borrow money off of your apple shares, but not everyone can do it. And there's some really, there's a lot.
00:29:29.036 - 00:29:51.614, Speaker A: Of frictions with it. So here's another thought exercise I want to give you. Defi. There was no narrative for Defi for a very long time. If you look at the DeFi TVL, let's say, 38 billion, you could say they're all like, crypto natives. As an example. And for a very long time, for the past three years, we were trying to figure out how do we get DeFI to the hands of the everyday user.
00:29:51.614 - 00:30:18.910, Speaker A: We talked to Kane about this, and Kane said, yeah, we need to create a consumer app or something of that nature that brings in more people, like a neo bank app or. Or whatever, that makes it easy for anyone to interact in DeFi. But it also seems as if RWAs could indirectly bring in different types of institutions or constituents in these different types of sectors, which could create a whole different onboarding flywheel that we haven't seen yet.
00:30:19.022 - 00:30:19.806, Speaker D: Is that true?
00:30:19.870 - 00:30:29.938, Speaker A: What do you think about the consumer versus the institutions, the RWA institutions versus, like, the DeFI as a mullet biology Cain thesis?
00:30:30.066 - 00:30:30.282, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:30:30.298 - 00:30:37.154, Speaker C: I mean, of course, if you put more assets on chain and there's more options for institutions and individuals to a pin to.
00:30:37.274 - 00:30:37.618, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:30:37.666 - 00:30:41.242, Speaker C: So, yeah, of course that will drive potentially more, more onboarding.
00:30:41.378 - 00:30:51.974, Speaker A: Which one are you bullish or bearish on? Is the question, are you bullish? Consumer versus institution. Consumers for defi, consumers first, why is that?
00:30:52.314 - 00:31:14.754, Speaker C: Less, less friction internally, less compliance. Like, you know, compliance officer telling me, hey, you can't do this because blah, blah, blah. But individuals from, let's say, emerging markets, they don't have access to super high quality assets. Their currency goes down 5% a year. They don't have stocks that go up like the US stocks do. Yeah, of course they would want to buy some stuff on chain, some rwas on chain.
00:31:14.874 - 00:31:15.346, Speaker D: I see.
00:31:15.410 - 00:31:16.082, Speaker A: Okay.
00:31:16.218 - 00:31:16.530, Speaker D: Okay.
00:31:16.562 - 00:31:21.378, Speaker A: So we talked about bonds, real estate, gold, collectibles.
00:31:21.546 - 00:31:22.266, Speaker D: Oh, okay.
00:31:22.290 - 00:31:38.816, Speaker A: Let's talk about Makerdao. So Makerdao's endgame, if you read his runes manifesto, talks about creating a new brand, this new Makerdao brand. So it won't be maker or die anymore, it will be a new brand. It's a new code name.
00:31:38.880 - 00:31:39.160, Speaker D: Okay.
00:31:39.192 - 00:31:40.624, Speaker C: On Solana, is that right?
00:31:40.784 - 00:32:05.852, Speaker A: I think it's not on Solana. It's going to use Solana's virtual machine. Virtual machine, yeah. So it's going to have its own chain. And the reason for it actually quite makes a lot of sense, which is if decisions were made that like large maker holders were to governance attack maker, then he has the ability to roll back the chain. That's his primary reason for doing that.
00:32:05.948 - 00:32:07.220, Speaker C: He as in himself.
00:32:07.372 - 00:32:40.934, Speaker A: Well, he meaning that the community, like the community, not like, you know, Lord Vitalik back in the day when he remembered that reentrancy attack that happened with the DAO. And. Yeah, so it won't be that, but you know, the community that wants to govern the protocol in a, in an efficient manner, you may have a adversarial attacker that will attack the governance and say, like, all right, give me $10 million worth of maker, right. So they can roll back the chain is the idea behind it. And he says, this is the final end state for security.
00:32:41.674 - 00:32:42.386, Speaker D: Thoughts?
00:32:42.490 - 00:32:48.938, Speaker A: I mean, and I'll talk about the real world assets around, around what Maker is doing, but I'm just curious to hear your thoughts on this.
00:32:49.066 - 00:32:53.378, Speaker C: No thoughts. I don't actually get it, but yeah, talk about the rwas.
00:32:53.506 - 00:33:11.170, Speaker A: Okay, so you see, so maker has these new tokens that will represent the new maker, new Dai, and they're going to create subdaos and they're going to be, there's going to be like six, subdivision two are facilitator daos and four are allocator daos.
00:33:11.282 - 00:33:11.856, Speaker D: Okay.
00:33:11.970 - 00:33:17.804, Speaker A: And these allocator daos are going to be given stable coins as a way to try to generate more yield.
00:33:17.924 - 00:33:18.664, Speaker D: Okay.
00:33:19.244 - 00:33:31.508, Speaker A: And he said in a manifesto, this is going to make Makerdao one of the most flexible DaO products that are out there. And I think I know where he's going with this. I'm curious to hear your thoughts, but think about it this way.
00:33:31.636 - 00:33:33.364, Speaker D: There's four subdivisions.
00:33:33.484 - 00:34:06.620, Speaker A: The first subdao could be primarily focused on buying t bills. Second subdoubt could be municipal bonds. Third sub dot could be commercial real estate. And you can start to see where he's going with this. They're essentially spv, or special purpose vehicles that enable maker to extend its capital base into real world assets. And then buying maker would give you the ability to get exposure on all of those things that they're extending to. Obviously, there's the defi component to this, but.
00:34:06.620 - 00:34:17.856, Speaker A: And so each of these subdaos, they will have their own token. So it's very likely a subdao that has t bills would be a maker t ball token that would basically gives.
00:34:17.880 - 00:34:28.008, Speaker C: The DeFi DJNs a lot of options of diversified portfolios, from tradfi that they can ape into ETF's. ETF's exactly.
00:34:28.136 - 00:34:28.856, Speaker D: On chain ETF's.
00:34:28.880 - 00:34:34.912, Speaker A: So maker is becoming the vanguard, or whatever, of crypto.
00:34:35.088 - 00:34:38.884, Speaker C: And rune is the Larif think of, or the blackrock.
00:34:39.504 - 00:34:41.560, Speaker A: I mean, it's plausible.
00:34:41.592 - 00:34:42.104, Speaker D: It makes sense.
00:34:42.184 - 00:34:53.224, Speaker C: It makes sense. I did see a bunch of really interesting random products on centrifuge, by the way, and they're all like diversified portfolios, like a bunch of things, not just one asset.
00:34:53.344 - 00:34:53.600, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:34:53.632 - 00:34:57.848, Speaker C: And I can see this going that way in the long term.
00:34:57.976 - 00:35:04.044, Speaker A: The way I see centrifuge, it has 250, $45 million in tbL.
00:35:04.164 - 00:35:05.388, Speaker D: Not bad, right?
00:35:05.476 - 00:35:42.936, Speaker A: And I see this as like an open RFQ system or lending product. Right. Where people will create pools. And for certain, you know, there's a vetting process. Once they get vetted, they can create a pool and say, hey, I'm going to start a commercial real estate pool, as an example, or I want to start a receivables for small to medium sized businesses pool. And it brings more institutions here because there's attractive capital base with attractive yields, and it also brings in the demand because people that are participating in those spaces can tap into the liquidity of Defi.
00:35:43.080 - 00:35:46.808, Speaker C: Now, the only question is whether or not Garrett Ansler will let this happen.
00:35:46.936 - 00:36:28.492, Speaker A: Nope, he's going to come. All right, well, there's a lot that we need to talk about. And we're bringing on Scott Lewis, who is the founder of Defi Pulse Defi app, which is now Slingshot, one of the first buyers of cryptopunks. In fact, he has probably one of the largest holdings of cryptopunks. And he launched Kanto, which is a layer one off the new polygon ZK EVM. And he is now setting his sights on real world assets, which is another interesting signal for us to just dive deeper into the space. So we're going to have him on to talk more about why he's bullish on real world assets.
00:36:28.628 - 00:36:29.596, Speaker D: Cool. Let's do it.
00:36:29.620 - 00:36:29.844, Speaker A: All right.
00:36:29.884 - 00:36:30.748, Speaker D: Let's do it.
00:36:30.916 - 00:37:16.668, Speaker A: Welcome to good game. Today we're going to be talking about real world assets, and there has been a growing narrative in the space around real world assets, starting with centrifuge Makerdao, with the end game proposal in, I think it was around May, and you're starting to see Maple and other startups that are offering treasury bills to defi users and other types of users. So want to learn more about this trend and get a better understanding of where the space is going. And so we're bringing on Scott Lewis, and he's been recently very bullish on real world assets. And I'll talk a bit more about why, but I want to see what Chow has to say before we get started.
00:37:16.786 - 00:37:43.040, Speaker C: You know, everywhere I go, every crypto conference I go these days, people talk about two things, friendtech and rwas. Those are the only two things people talk about. And yet I haven't really seen, like, super strong thesis from people like why does it actually make sense to tokenize things and put it on chain and where does the demand come from? What is the legal solution to this problem? Right. And so that's why we have an expert today to go through this.
00:37:43.192 - 00:37:43.640, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:37:43.712 - 00:38:15.596, Speaker A: And funny enough, every time I scroll Twitter, you see a lot of noobs that will tweet out traditional assets worth $10 trillion. And this is why you should long chain link. But really we got to figure out what is the thesis behind real world assets or traditional assets. How do we bring it on chain, if that's the way, what's the legal regulatory requirements or the frameworks around it, and what is considered real world asset and what isn't considered real world asset.
00:38:15.740 - 00:38:16.332, Speaker D: And so we have.
00:38:16.348 - 00:38:24.636, Speaker A: Scott, Scott, obviously you've been in a space for a very long time, so if you want to do a quick 32nd background check and then we'll kind of go from there.
00:38:24.740 - 00:39:12.250, Speaker B: Yeah, I was a trader in traditional finance for eleven years, then kind of fell down the Ethereum rabbit hole late 2016, early 2017. Started as kind of a trader in crypto, then built like a public service site about like ICO scams back in 2017 and then kind of caught the bug to start building stuff. And yeah, I just like did a handful of startups and which I'm still active in a number of them. And then, yeah, was part of the pre launch contributor group for Kanto, which is a layer one that we kind of like, you know, didn't, didn't raise any money for. Tried to have sort of a bootstrapped, decentralized launch. Yeah, just been focusing on that and some of the other stuff I would co found.
00:39:12.402 - 00:39:32.910, Speaker A: But I feel like you're a perpetual or serial entrepreneur. You started Defi pulse. I remember using Defi pulse quite actively very early on in my defi journey, especially tracking the TVL. I would use defi pulse to track the TVL of defi. Back then it was like, I don't know, 5100 million. I remember that. Dexag, which is now slingshot.
00:39:32.910 - 00:39:38.034, Speaker A: Right. And Slingshot is probably one of the top apps for swaps today.
00:39:38.934 - 00:39:39.502, Speaker D: Yes.
00:39:39.598 - 00:39:57.250, Speaker B: Slingshot has been doing great. Yeah, it's been pretty fun. There's going to be a reinvention of slingshot. I think it's just getting out very privately right now. But I think it's really exciting and I think paradigm change for Defi and on chain interaction, but I think that'll be, I don't announce it yet.
00:39:57.322 - 00:40:22.106, Speaker A: And then you were pretty early on in NFTs, right, with, I think you were one of the, I would say there's like maybe three groups of people that were in the NFT space, those that caught it very early where, you know, like an example is cryptopunks. People were able to actually mint crypto punks around the 2017, 1819 period, right? Yeah. And it was available for a very long time to mint. And no one really minted it.
00:40:22.130 - 00:40:23.214, Speaker B: Well, wait, no.
00:40:23.354 - 00:40:24.286, Speaker A: Okay, tell me the history.
00:40:24.350 - 00:40:27.486, Speaker B: Okay, so it was on Reddit and it was all free.
00:40:27.670 - 00:40:28.078, Speaker D: Yes.
00:40:28.126 - 00:40:55.644, Speaker B: And they actually minted out fairly quickly. I saw it on Reddit and was like, that's really cool. But then, like, one of my companies had a lot of fires that day and so I basically couldn't, and I missed, I missed it. But then about two or three weeks maybe it's more than that, actually sort of just really dove into it. But you could buy them for very cheap, like $1015, $20, $30, $40 at that time. But it was fun.
00:40:55.724 - 00:41:25.196, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, yeah, you were very early on crypto punks. I came in phase two, which was around the five to six mark. That's around. And that was more in the 2019 2020. So you identified Defi early, you identified nfts early, and now it seems like a lot of your tweets recently has been around robiled assets. I guess the first question I'd like to ask is what are some the signals that you saw in real world assets that is incline you to work on this full time?
00:41:25.300 - 00:42:03.266, Speaker B: There are two types of things that I think are going to be really disruptive. This is a completely new idea, and I think if people like it, they might like it a lot. And I think crypto punks and nfts fit that mold. But I think for real world assets, it's a completely new way of solving a problem. That's very important because I think when you look at traditional finance, there are a lot of different ways people get loans. People do finance with each other. Putting everything on chain in protocols, like, solves a lot of, like, really important problems in a much cleaner way than currently exists in traditional finance.
00:42:03.266 - 00:42:29.962, Speaker B: And so, like, when I sort of see those things and you see, like, the potential for, like, cost reductions and redirections and friction in, like, how people do business, it just sort of feels like, you know, like, the default case is that, like, this was a better way. And there's, like, a lot of ways that can derail the default case. But, like, I don't know, when I see those sort of differences, this kind of, like, this could be huge.
00:42:30.098 - 00:42:43.330, Speaker C: Scott, just double clicking on that. Can you pick an example of a real world asset and describe how exactly putting it on chain solves the problem that exists in traditional finance?
00:42:43.522 - 00:43:30.060, Speaker B: Just as a counterexample, imagine, like, I held, like, apple stock, very popular asset. I could put that, I could hold that stock at a brokerage and borrow margin, own that stock on margin, borrow dollars against it. I wouldn't have to put up the full value of each share. Now imagine we own, like, an asset that does not trade as liquidly on exchanges, right? Like, maybe that is like, puerto rican sovereign bonds or puerto rican debt. Not sovereign, obviously. Or maybe that's just like a small and medium business, receivables financing, right? I could, like, take that to a brokerage and be like, hey, here's my assets as collateral. Let me borrow against it.
00:43:30.060 - 00:44:08.508, Speaker B: I'd like to belong this on margin. It's just like, no one does that or no one will do that for me. Maybe if I'm one of the largest hedge funds in the world, Goldman or JP Morgan might do it, but it's pretty restricted. But imagine a different world where we had those financing from small and medium businesses. Maybe they're collateralized, secured against like assets that business owns. And now you just say, hey, I post those collateral in a protocol and anyone can lend me money. It's like I'm not just going to a Goldman or JP Morgan, I can just crowdsource that.
00:44:08.508 - 00:44:24.724, Speaker B: And that's something that you can't really do well in the traditional finance. But there's not really reasons why that wouldn't work on the types of protocols that DeFi has been researching and developing over like the last six, five, six years.
00:44:24.884 - 00:44:38.036, Speaker C: So let me summarize. The benefit of tokenizing some of these traditional assets on chain is giving it access to the open blockchain and therefore the open liquidity. Basically giving them more liquidity.
00:44:38.180 - 00:45:01.294, Speaker B: Yeah. More people can be counterparties with more people. And also things are just transparent unless you make them not. They're transparent by default. And I think in traditional finance, things are like opaque by default. And kind of like that composability, less permissioning of the system. It just kind of worked better.
00:45:01.414 - 00:45:01.974, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:45:02.094 - 00:45:20.286, Speaker A: A counter question to that is obviously with real world assets, for the most part, all the products that I'm seeing, you have to KYC ML. So how does that counter act, your positioning based on allowing anyone and everyone to participate? Do you see a separate world where everyone has to be KYC to AML?
00:45:20.430 - 00:46:11.990, Speaker B: I don't like calling finance with real world assets defi because it's not fully decentralized. I've sort of, just, because it's not really a good term for it. I've started trying to call that neo finance and just, it's because it's a new way of doing traditional finance. I would say that definitely kind of each the different issuers and tokenizers of real world assets, they're sort of picking what their regulatory approach will be. I think different jurisdiction, have different rules on who can participate, who cannot. Kyz seems to be present everywhere, but the other parts of the regulatory compliance process to follow are different based on their setups. And so like, I do think it's important to be like, this is not fully decentralized, but I think there are parts of it that are open and permissionless.
00:46:12.142 - 00:46:12.454, Speaker D: Right.
00:46:12.494 - 00:46:29.904, Speaker B: So even if, like, if you have to be permission to create the real world asset, supplying liquidity to borrowing against it, that would be just sort of like a compound or aave style money market that doesn't really require that. That may not require the same compliance process.
00:46:30.204 - 00:46:30.652, Speaker D: Got it.
00:46:30.668 - 00:46:35.492, Speaker A: So it really depends on the money market. Right. Because some money markets may want counterparties to be KYC as well.
00:46:35.588 - 00:46:51.118, Speaker B: Yeah. Like, like, I think it's sort of like, there are, like, no high level rules that can be applied to every. But it is sort of like a hybrid in that some parts of the system will require some complex approaches and others will require different compliance approaches.
00:46:51.206 - 00:47:24.984, Speaker A: Recently, Gabriel Shapiro, GC Adelphi, he tweeted at a long manifesto, I think, a couple of days ago, and he said there's really three types of rwas that exist. One is, like, real securities. Two is ownership titles to off chain assets, and three is receipts, certificates of deposits of an off chain asset. He says, real securities are very hard to natively launch on chain. So, like, let's say a Microsoft stock, right? Like, Microsoft already issued his stock, and porting that over is going to be very hard. Right. Without violating security laws.
00:47:24.984 - 00:47:43.106, Speaker A: So you see these weird hybrids such as, like, USDC and USDT, which is a representation of a stable coin, representation of the dollar. And he said, that's okay. Two is ownership titles to off chain assets. It will really depend on, like, can you really tokenize a deed to a property?
00:47:43.210 - 00:47:43.474, Speaker D: Right.
00:47:43.514 - 00:48:02.044, Speaker A: Like, and what are the laws that are around it? And will it withhold within with a layer one or blockchain? He's bearish on that. What he's bullish on is receipts and certificates of deposits of on chain assets. So just similar to, like, super. I'm sorry, off chain assets. Thank you. Which is similar to what Robert Leshner is doing with superstate.
00:48:02.114 - 00:48:02.656, Speaker D: Right.
00:48:02.800 - 00:48:13.712, Speaker A: Which is. He's an investment manager. Right. He has a fund administrator. He'll talk to investors, kyc them, take the capital, and give them, like, a private portal where they can purchase treasury bills.
00:48:13.768 - 00:48:14.224, Speaker D: Right.
00:48:14.344 - 00:48:29.694, Speaker A: And then they will be issued a token, and that token could be freely traded. Do you agree with that thesis? Or how do you kind of see the regulatory, like, how do you see the onboarding of types of real world assets? Does that resonate with you? Do you disagree with that statement? Like, how do you see that?
00:48:29.784 - 00:48:31.826, Speaker B: I mean, I'm not a lawyer.
00:48:32.010 - 00:48:32.754, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:48:32.914 - 00:48:42.134, Speaker B: And I'm also not an RWA issuer. I'm more just, like, build infrastructure for all the lawyers and compliance people.
00:48:42.594 - 00:48:43.882, Speaker A: You represent the builders.
00:48:43.978 - 00:48:44.282, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:48:44.338 - 00:48:45.258, Speaker A: You represent the builders.
00:48:45.306 - 00:48:50.154, Speaker B: I mean, the third case, like, rings pretty true to me.
00:48:50.234 - 00:48:50.618, Speaker A: Okay.
00:48:50.666 - 00:49:47.950, Speaker B: And it feels like a lot of people are kind of, like, working within that model. I more just, like, when I post things, I'm thinking this is just, like, very cloudy, and, like, there's, like, this is a new thing, and so it's really hard. Like, good rulemaking hasn't happened for it, and so I kind of just approach it that. I mean, I like, you know, Gabriel is, like, he's a smart dude, and so, like, I think that's a pretty good perspective. But at the same time, I kind of know in my head, probably over the next two to five years, there will be a lot of clarity, or hopefully there will be a lot of clarity and just adjust. Adjust as, like, that stuff sort of becomes, like, as you learn more, like, just adjust how you're doing things at that point. You know, any new technology, you're sort of, like, waiting for, like, how it will be regulated.
00:49:48.062 - 00:50:01.446, Speaker C: I definitely have a question. Question for Gabriel. I don't quite understand the difference between us putting a stock on chain and putting us treasuries on chain. Like, both are securities, but he somehow puts them into separate categories. But anyway, that's for another day.
00:50:01.630 - 00:50:11.726, Speaker B: I will be wrong, but I think the difference is, like, are you trading the literal stock, or are you trading, like, a deposit receipt for a stock?
00:50:11.910 - 00:50:12.998, Speaker A: That's exactly right.
00:50:13.046 - 00:50:30.842, Speaker B: And I don't know, even, like, in traditional finance, and I don't know if this would qualify under his framework, but, like, american depository receipts trade pretty well on other stock exchanges, and there are, like, depository seats for foreign stocks on us markets, so I don't know if that's a problem.
00:50:30.978 - 00:50:38.290, Speaker C: Speaking of ADR's, I feel like ADR's are tokenized, like, bridging a stock into a different chain kind of thing.
00:50:38.322 - 00:50:38.466, Speaker D: Right.
00:50:38.490 - 00:50:43.346, Speaker C: Because you take a foreign stock and put it into the american system, it's literally, like, bridging.
00:50:43.450 - 00:50:44.778, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah.
00:50:44.866 - 00:50:50.454, Speaker B: No, I mean, it seems like a good model. It seems like it works well.
00:50:50.754 - 00:51:05.522, Speaker C: Yeah, so we mentioned a bunch of, like, asset classes, right? Like, stocks, treasuries, and blah, blah, blah. And is there any one or two asset classes, asset classes, that you are particularly excited about to tokenize?
00:51:05.698 - 00:52:14.184, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think there's, like, two sort of, like, profiles. I think short term tables are really interesting on protocols because they're really safe and they don't have much duration. So, like, you know, when you're looking at, like, TLT or, like, super long dated bonds, like, they're going up and down a lot. T bills, very probably global apocalypse event, right. If, like, T bills went down by 20%, a day. And then the other types of assets are things that once you get a little bit farther out on the risk and liquidity tail, like boring types of assets, but assets that don't have liquid secondary markets and don't have that many players that are securitizing them in traditional finance. Think about auto loan market, SMB, receivables, trade financing, like these types of things that aren't like as huge as like treasuries or mortgage backed securities or like high pay corporate debt, but are maybe a little sleepier, probably a little more efficient cost structures.
00:52:14.184 - 00:52:23.004, Speaker B: That's kind of like where I think, like protocols will maybe happen, and the crowdsourcing that comes with protocols might have like the biggest efficiency gains.
00:52:24.584 - 00:52:48.366, Speaker C: So on your second point, I completely agree. And in fact, Imran, in our request for startups, I wrote exactly this as a reason for RWAs, which is to create a liquid secondary market for those traditional assets that don't already have a liquid secondary market. On your first point, T bills. On chain T bills. So, like, right now we have, there's like Ondo, there's have a few other names.
00:52:48.470 - 00:52:49.238, Speaker A: Maple.
00:52:49.366 - 00:52:51.230, Speaker C: Does Maple do T bills today?
00:52:51.342 - 00:52:53.326, Speaker D: Yeah, I believe so.
00:52:53.350 - 00:52:54.274, Speaker A: Yeah, they do.
00:52:54.894 - 00:52:55.326, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:52:55.390 - 00:52:59.062, Speaker A: Tax receivables, market making, and then t bills.
00:52:59.198 - 00:53:15.478, Speaker C: Okay, so I have in my notes on the, on the matrix, matrix stock opened, and you mentioned Maple. So there's a bunch of them that do tokenized T bills. And the TvL is pretty high. It's like over $100 million. That order of magnitude.
00:53:15.606 - 00:53:15.982, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:53:16.038 - 00:53:22.572, Speaker C: And my question is, who are the buyers? Like, who actually owns these on chain t bills today?
00:53:22.718 - 00:54:21.734, Speaker B: I think you sort of have like two epochs in, like, rwas so far, and I would say the first one was RWA startups looking to like, solve an access problem. On the t bill side of the access problem, there might be people that don't have access to fed direct, and that was like, interesting, and I'm really happy those teams were building that. I think what we're starting to see now also though, is kind of this, like tbils is kind of like an asset in protocols, which like Ondo's has flux protocol where you can post your tables and get liquid against them. And then for Kanto, we're sort of integrating t bills into a canto lending market with fortunify and hash notes. Tokenized t bills so far, and kind of using that as like, as sort of like the backing for node, which is like Canto's unit of account, kind of like.
00:54:22.154 - 00:54:49.404, Speaker C: So maybe to expand on my question, I've always wondered where the demand comes from, because for me, that is the biggest challenge for all rwas. Yes, you can tokenize on chain, but where does the demand comes comes from? Who are the buyers? So are the buyers of t bills on chain T bills today? Are they those who are, let's say, based in emerging markets, they need high quality assets that yields 5%? Or are they more like crypto native on chain organizations that need some treasury diversification or something like that?
00:54:49.524 - 00:54:50.324, Speaker D: Any visibility?
00:54:50.444 - 00:55:42.590, Speaker B: I'm not completely sure. What I do know is there's a lot of people lending stable coins to defi protocols for aprs that are actually below the t bill rate right now. And then they're also taking smart contract risk to do that. And so I feel like just if you can own a token, that CB's probably a bit better just given where that yield is right now. So, like, I'm not completely sure exactly where all that those depositors are, but what I do think is true is that kind of like having on chain assets that kind of give you. That give you a yield that's similar to the overnight riskless rate is pretty important for using infinance. And that's kind of like what I'm more excited about that I am less excited about the access problem, even though I think it's important.
00:55:42.590 - 00:55:44.954, Speaker B: It's just how it gets me out of bed.
00:55:45.894 - 00:56:22.968, Speaker A: When speaking about demand, there's two things that come to mind. One is everyone is trying to figure out who's providing the LP or liquidity for uniswap, especially taking all the toxic order flow. There's a lot of that that's happening on Uniswap. And if you look at like DeFi protocols across the board, you know, you see upwards of 100, 200, 300 million tvl. I think in, within real world assets, you see 200 million in Ondo, you're seeing 100 million in like realty. And it kind of like spread across. I'd say there's about like a billion plus in TVl in real world assets.
00:56:22.968 - 00:57:17.002, Speaker A: And I think partly a lot of these users are, are crypto whales that have been successful over the past few years. There's actually an underground trading group, many underground trading groups that I've learned about that are actively providing markets for these protocols, which I thought was very interesting, number two, which is, I think with the current macro status of raising interest rates, it's actually a strong tailwind for DeFi, because now you have this pull effect of people that want to get access to interest rates or the yield by t bills, and they're willing to do whatever they can to get access to the, to the yield. Because if you could compare to the yield on defi, it's like, I don't know, three to five, three to 4% maybe. And if you get access to t bills, then you're getting upwards of 5%.
00:57:17.138 - 00:57:17.762, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:57:17.898 - 00:57:25.072, Speaker A: And so I think what's happening also is that this can, can also become a tailwind to help accelerate rwas across the board.
00:57:25.208 - 00:57:26.696, Speaker D: Do you find that thesis to be.
00:57:26.720 - 00:57:28.408, Speaker A: True and do you think this is going to hold?
00:57:28.536 - 00:58:15.884, Speaker B: I mean, generally, if you look at how much money is in stablecoins and then multiply that by, like, the overnight rate, that's how much people are, like, losing by doing nothing. And so I think, I mean, just like, the more expensive that gets, the more likely those people will do a thing. So, I mean, that definitely kind of rings true to me personally. Like, I'm more excited about kind of like pulling people in from traditional finance, especially people that are, like, currently experiencing, like, the somewhat inefficient cost structures in traditional finance and bringing that on chain. But, yeah, there's a lot of money in stablecoin that's just earning a big zero. So why wouldn't it do something better? It makes pretty good sense to me.
00:58:16.464 - 00:58:44.296, Speaker A: Just moving aside from the traditional assets like treasuries, we're starting to see, like, structured credit, commercial real estate. I was just scrolling through centrifuge, and I'm starting to see different types of offerings, even carbon offsets. And so I guess the question is, yes, securities, bonds, t bills, et cetera, make a lot of sense. What about for the rest of the asset classes, and is there enough structural demand for those types of products?
00:58:44.440 - 00:59:39.228, Speaker B: I think it depends. I think a lot of people sort of approach rwas in that I'm going to put these tokens on chain and then people would just want to buck them. I don't think, sort of like the pet rock approach is going to work that well with those assets, because most of the people that kind of like, want to get in and learn about those assets enough, they probably can just buy them elsewhere and they can buy them through, like, traditional finance channels, which are probably more competitive today and also don't carry private key risk. I think where it starts to change is when you can do something with those assets, when you own them on chain that you can't do with traditional finance. And if the people need that thing, there's going to be a strong incentive to own that asset. On chain. And for me, that answer is, like, financing and being able to borrow against them and lever up on, like, an asset class you like or yield.
00:59:39.228 - 00:59:40.332, Speaker B: You think it's too high?
00:59:40.428 - 00:59:55.652, Speaker C: Let me rephrase Imran's question. So there's all these asset classes around the world. I want to ask you one at a time if you're bullish or bearish when it comes to tokenizing them. I know you don't necessarily have a good answer, but I'm curious what your hunch says. So let's start with our real estate.
00:59:55.788 - 01:00:11.500, Speaker B: I haven't seen a model that works well yet. I think it's completely possible someone will invent one, and when they do, I'll be super excited. I just, like, just hasn't come across my desk. Something that's like, oh, this just works. Let's do it.
01:00:11.652 - 01:00:19.780, Speaker C: Now, what about precious metals or industrial metals like gold, silver, but also, like, lithium? Like, these things, maybe.
01:00:19.812 - 01:00:22.652, Speaker B: I don't know. I don't get it.
01:00:22.828 - 01:00:23.476, Speaker D: You don't get it?
01:00:23.500 - 01:00:24.982, Speaker C: Okay, so you don't believe in it.
01:00:25.068 - 01:00:29.194, Speaker B: I'm not, like, super embarrassed. I'm just like, I don't understand why that's better.
01:00:29.234 - 01:00:32.738, Speaker C: Yeah. What about Pokemon cards and the gathering cards?
01:00:32.826 - 01:00:34.602, Speaker B: I'm too old for those, I think.
01:00:34.738 - 01:00:39.970, Speaker C: I don't know. I know you have some thoughts on your Michael Jordan cards.
01:00:40.122 - 01:00:42.138, Speaker A: I'm bullish on collectibles.
01:00:42.266 - 01:00:42.738, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:00:42.826 - 01:01:02.880, Speaker A: It's a $6 trillion market. I mean, it ranges, obviously, from sneakers all the way to musicians signing off on vinyls. And then, you know, you have art as well that's included in that. So I do think that there is an ability for people to. And we're starting to see this with Courtyard. Right chow.
01:01:02.992 - 01:01:03.376, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:01:03.440 - 01:01:21.936, Speaker A: And I think magic Eden recently launched the ability to buy packs, Pokemon packs that have been wrapped, that's custodied by companies like brinks. And you could easily buy and sell these packs, and then you could redeem it to open up the pack that will be sent to your house. So I'm quite bullish on that.
01:01:22.000 - 01:01:44.472, Speaker C: I asked you earlier, Imran, if you remember why you would hold the token rather than the physical card itself. And you said two things. One is you were worried about humidity and heat, which could damage the cards. Damage the cards. And then the other reason is you're worried about theft. Both problems can be solved if you have a trusted custodian.
01:01:44.608 - 01:01:45.536, Speaker D: Yep. Yeah.
01:01:45.560 - 01:01:51.672, Speaker B: Like, but don't you lose the chance to put it on your bedroom dresser and look at it every day?
01:01:51.808 - 01:01:53.216, Speaker D: Well, it depends on how much you have. Right.
01:01:53.240 - 01:02:02.364, Speaker A: You could always have one that could, you could hang on the wall. Oh, you could just create an NFT and then I'll just have a. It's the same.
01:02:02.904 - 01:02:21.054, Speaker B: No, like, I think if, like. Yeah, like, markets like that, you know, like in sneakers, there's, like, people, there's like, financial speculators, sort of collectors, but they're also, like, hoping the sneaker they buy, they can flip it later, and then there's, like, people that just wear them.
01:02:21.214 - 01:02:21.894, Speaker D: Right.
01:02:22.054 - 01:02:46.406, Speaker B: And, like, I think, I mean, I could see if there's like a. If you can bifurcate the market from the speculators and, like, the end users or the end collectors, you could create more efficiencies for the speculators and the traders in the markets. Like, I just don't know if anyone's done that yet, but it doesn't mean that they can't just. Maybe it's been a little too early on some of the prior tries.
01:02:46.550 - 01:03:08.086, Speaker A: Yeah, because, you know, I would consider, like, collectibles being an emerging real world asset sector as well. Like, collectibles with cards and, I mean, Pokemon. Or if you just think about Pokemon, there's a very strong user base of die hard culture fanatics that love Pokemon, and that could extend across many different ips and brands across the board.
01:03:08.230 - 01:03:21.558, Speaker B: I don't disagree with that. It's just a hard bootstrapping problem because, like, if right now all the collectors go to, like, a less efficient system like eBay, or is that the market center right now, these types of collectibles?
01:03:21.726 - 01:03:27.814, Speaker A: So eBay is the marketplace where you could buy and sell cards. Yes. Like the physical item.
01:03:27.894 - 01:03:28.554, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:03:28.864 - 01:03:46.072, Speaker A: But there's also this company called Courtyard or magic. You know, magic Eden, where they use a custodian like brinks, where they store the actual packs and cards, and then the digital item exists on these marketplaces where people can buy and sell.
01:03:46.168 - 01:04:26.034, Speaker B: If you think about, like, who wins in a market like that, I sort of think of that as like, okay, whoever has that relationship with, like, the real customer, and I think the real customer is that person that comes and they buy one and they put it on their bedroom dresser, they frame it, they put in their living room or something. And, like, getting that person to stop just typing in eBay and looking at what's there and getting them to go to courtyard or magic Eden or the different website is challenged. Like, it's not an impossible burden. It's not like an impossible, like, hurdle to get over, but it might be hard and expensive.
01:04:26.154 - 01:05:00.672, Speaker C: There's a, there's a wine RWA company that we talked to. Super interesting. I'll tell you that the thesis, it's very interesting. So there is people who want to collect one, have exposure to one prices, expensive one premium wine. But because they're based in Singapore, there's an import tax. So if we add, if you, if you want to have exposure to one prices previously without tokenization, you would have to pay a huge import tax. And so with tokenization, you can just leave the one where, where it was, whether it's in France or California, and you save like 30, 40% super interesting pieces.
01:05:00.728 - 01:05:05.644, Speaker B: Yes. Sort of like the art. Like the art warehouses.
01:05:05.984 - 01:05:06.712, Speaker D: Like the art.
01:05:06.768 - 01:05:11.048, Speaker B: Like, you basically buy the art and just ship it to your offshore warehouse and then keep it there.
01:05:11.176 - 01:05:12.160, Speaker D: Yeah, that is pretty.
01:05:12.272 - 01:05:18.998, Speaker B: Do they end up importing it eventually to drink it or just like you, you drink it. When you visit California, you can choose to.
01:05:19.086 - 01:05:33.674, Speaker C: So, like, similar, so like the wine and also the Pokemon cards and whatever, all these collectibles and art you can do create, redeem, as long as you have the token. So you have the token, you can redeem the physical item, et cetera.
01:05:34.254 - 01:05:35.718, Speaker B: I mean, it sounds fun.
01:05:35.886 - 01:05:36.834, Speaker C: It is fun.
01:05:38.174 - 01:05:45.776, Speaker A: Antonio from Dydx said we need to move away from obsession with porting real world assets to crypto and double down on fundamentally new things.
01:05:45.870 - 01:05:46.188, Speaker C: I saw it.
01:05:46.196 - 01:05:49.196, Speaker A: Crypto enables thoughts, reactions.
01:05:49.380 - 01:06:39.008, Speaker B: Okay, no, I don't know. It's like humans need to borrow money from each other. It's like capital formation. To do things with those capital is like something that's been going on for thousands of years, and it will be continue to be one of the most important reasons why humans need money. So, like, like, yeah, we can, like, do like, jpegs. Like, we can put jpegs on chain. Like, we can put, like, these Internet only things, right? Like visual nfts, like, you know, dynx doing like, perp swaps on, like, crypto coins, right? Like, all of these, like, things to do around stuff that exists on the Internet.
01:06:39.008 - 01:07:09.774, Speaker B: And that stuff's interesting. Like, for me personally, I see crypto rails as kind of being the next financial infrastructure for how the economy of the world runs. And so to say we're just going to ignore all of the real economy forever. It's just kind of like, I don't know. Obviously I like the finance around Internet native things, but I don't think it's like most of the market.
01:07:10.074 - 01:07:31.626, Speaker C: I mean, we already had validation of this, which is stable coins. Like, that's the elephant in the room. Stablecoin is RWA. And guess what? Last year, stablecoins settled $11 trillion. And guess how much PayPal settled, like, 1.4. Stablecoin has already surpassed PayPal by seven times. There's no better validation than this.
01:07:31.770 - 01:07:58.750, Speaker B: Yeah, and I mean, also, like, most of DeFi is really stable. Coins versus protocol, tokens too. Like, obviously there are a lot of, like, tokens trading as ETH, but like, the meat of the market in, like, perks, defi lending and on Dexs is stablecoins first, like ETH when it's on ads, stablecoin versus Sol when it's on Solana, like, I don't think you can write over.
01:07:58.862 - 01:08:36.826, Speaker A: So to me, it seems like why real world assets or traditional assets should exist on chain. To me, it seems like you could get more demand for these assets. Right now, the demand is localized in different markets across the world, right? So the US market is primarily us market, and those that want to get access to it, you have to be maybe ultra wealthy, or you need to have an investment manager that could get access to the structured products or stocks or securities, or if you're savvy. And so to me, it seems like the ease of getting access to rural assets will be an order magnitude easier, and so that people can get access to these assets, I would sort of push back.
01:08:36.890 - 01:08:56.310, Speaker B: I would say that is definitely sort of the epoch, one of rwas and this access problem, I would say in my mind, I think epoch too, though, is actually removing using protocols to decrease the friction on counterparties finding each other.
01:08:56.462 - 01:09:02.238, Speaker A: Well, yeah, because you're opening it up to everyone, right? So people can like an open RQ system, right?
01:09:02.326 - 01:10:10.456, Speaker B: I would almost guess. But if like, let's say we just have everyone in the world that trades mortgage backed securities, right, and tokenizations of that MBS all existed on chain, right? And let's just assume in our little thought experiment that all of the counterparties and people doing the transaction in MBS also were comfortable transacting on chain. Would they choose to transact on chain with protocols, or would they choose to transact through traditional methods with the contracts and the clearing facilities they currently have? I think the on chain protocols are going to be way more efficient, but there's an enormous problem in that the existing traditional, more efficient traditional finance system has all the counterparties. Everyone's onboard to the clearing facilities. They have the is with each other. And so that network effect is strong. And so it will probably be a very, very long time before there's anything that's competitive on chain for something that says, like, developed as that.
01:10:10.456 - 01:10:39.424, Speaker B: But I think the on chain version would have lower frictions if it had all the counterparties and MDS issuers and the originators already onboarded. And so I sort of think of it as just kind of a matter of time until the bigger, like the. The more efficient systems eat away at the less efficient systems. And I wouldn't start with MBS either, because it's like a very mature market with lots of counterparties and a good amount of competition.
01:10:40.564 - 01:10:47.796, Speaker A: So, to summarize, one is demand, and then also the cost efficiencies across the board.
01:10:47.900 - 01:11:40.884, Speaker B: Yeah, like, the cost structure is like just getting onboarded. To be able to trade something like MBS is very expensive, and the barriers are very high. Getting a loan against MBS you own is a pretty high bar. And if you want to switch who is financing you, like, who your prime brokerage was, that would also be a very long process. If you compare that to what's on DeFi with just, if you wanted to do finance with f, AaVE is not paying any money to onboard you to deposit a bit of f and borrow dollars against it, and you're switching costs. If you want to switch from aave to compound is just like two or three transactions in five minutes. And so it's just like radically, the competition is like orders of magnitude closer to perfect competition than you see in traditional finance.
01:11:40.884 - 01:11:59.920, Speaker B: And so it's really a question of like, okay, so how do you bootstrap individual markets to have enough counterparties of that market on chain to where the better competition can take over and pull the rest of the market into the smaller network effect with more efficient cost structures?
01:12:00.072 - 01:12:12.216, Speaker C: Talking a little bit about the future after t bills, what do you think might be the most, the asset class that's the most likely to get tokenized and succeed on chain sleepier markets that.
01:12:12.240 - 01:12:59.150, Speaker B: Are boring, but also high yielding markets where it's not like a frontier market, where you're worried if this loan defaults will, will I be able to actually get a recovery rate over z boat? Like, if we're lending in countries with less of a tradition of rule of law, that might be problematic. But I think if you think about other markets, like small and medium american businesses, and they have receivables, they need the cash now, so they'll put those receivables up and borrow against them. Right? Those sorts of markets, interest rates on notes in those markets, you know, can be 1516, 17%. And it's not.
01:12:59.182 - 01:13:02.278, Speaker A: It's on maple now. It's on maple now for 14%.
01:13:02.406 - 01:13:31.484, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, like exactly like that. That type of stuff. And it's like, you know, like maybe not mortgages, right? But something like auto loans is a much smaller market, right. And a bit more efficient relative to the mortgage market. And so like those sorts of sleepy, not as big, more inefficient markets are the thing with less counterparties currently transacting are kind of like what I think the market said will be the best.
01:13:31.644 - 01:14:10.512, Speaker A: Putting rwas to the side. Where do you see other sectors taken off? I know before we started our recording, we talked about music nfts. And obviously music NFTs are interesting because you have sound XYz. That was probably the forerunner in this that started with kind of minting and teas. Now they have a tiered approach where you could buy maybe a set of 30 music nfts and then the rest could be minted for free as a way to increase distribution. You also have vault that's launched on Solana that's taking more of a traditional approach of buying albums.
01:14:10.638 - 01:14:11.444, Speaker D: And I feel like you have a.
01:14:11.444 - 01:14:20.340, Speaker A: Lot of insights around this because that's probably the next market you're looking at. So maybe give us a high level overview of music nfts and why you're bullish.
01:14:20.492 - 01:15:14.284, Speaker B: I think music nfts, it's sort of like they have so much potential, but they haven't done that well. And it's like why? I think they have tons of potential because the emotional connection people have with music is probably is like more intense than the emotional attachment people will have with a picture. And we've seen this like drive to collect picture JPeg NFTs. Like cryptopunks for daves, many others. But we haven't seen that same drive to collect music nfts. And so it's like, for me as a builder, I'm sort of trying to figure out, hey, why does the same thing feel like it should work so well, but it's not working so well? And kind of like, I see a couple key, two key problems. One, the lot of music NFTs are incompatible with traditional distribution.
01:15:14.284 - 01:16:25.462, Speaker B: Yeah, like Spotify. Like if you make a really, really good song and put on music entities, it's not like a clear, like coherent path to also using that song in traditional distribution unless you sort of just issue a copy of that song as an NFT. And if like, I'm listening to that song in Spotify and it's on like my like list and I feel like this is one of my favorite songs. What does the extra copy of that song do for me? I think for some people it does appeal. And there are a lot of people that really like your music NFTs. But I think for a lot of people, it's like, what, what is this? What is this dealing? And so, like, me just kind of as a builder trying to kind of solve that, those two problems to hopefully realize the potential. And so, like, I'm kind of thinking about music NFTs as being like, you have to create a format that's both completely compatible with how music gets out normally for, like, a mainstream artist, while also giving something, people, something that they can, that they can own, that they can't just have in Spotify and it's theirs and other people don't have 50 copies of them.
01:16:25.598 - 01:16:43.734, Speaker C: That's really interesting, because if you think about why jpegs have taken off, images are by default compatible with all the social media. Like, you can just put a picture on the Twitter, right? You can post it on Reddit, on instagram or whatever, it's completely compatible. Whereas music is music NFTs are not today.
01:16:43.894 - 01:16:47.298, Speaker B: Very good insight, finding a format that kind of does both.
01:16:47.446 - 01:16:56.266, Speaker A: But how does that work, though? I mean, like, if you look at streaming, like, I think most people stream today, right? So Spotify and, and Apple Music.
01:16:56.370 - 01:16:56.890, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:16:57.002 - 01:17:09.050, Speaker A: So that's the current format today. You could stream through YouTube. You could stream through. I mean, I think the older generation probably has MP3 s, but in the post music NFT world, what would that format look like?
01:17:09.122 - 01:18:10.146, Speaker B: There's been some. Some projects that have kind of worked in this direction on the format side, but maybe not pairing it with Richard distribution, but kind of the format I settled on is essentially, let's say you make ten songs that would kind of be the album, but the pieces of that song are kind of interchangeable, like legos and so kind of like your, your kicks, your snares, the hi hats, they kind of have a common structure. The chord progressions in the song. You know, the songs have the same tempo. There's like modular structure of the songs and the way the chord progressions work. Every chord progression kind of fits with all the bass lines, right? And so essentially it has, like, we create kind of this collage of sounds, but it's like an album's worth of material. And then that collage of sounds could be recombined into ten coherent songs or 10,000 coherent songs, which is kind of your NFT collection.
01:18:10.146 - 01:19:25.456, Speaker B: And then from those 10,000 songs, ten of them might be the official album version. And so sort of like, because it's an album and like a collage or an album from a collage, we're going to call it an elage. And it kind of juxtaposes the way music and nfts work now, and that sometimes, like, if you did distribute the song on Spotify, the music NFt is just kind of like a sidecar copy of that single on Spotify. What we want to do with the elage is kind of. The elage is the whole body of the artist's work, but the album on Spotify is like a subset of the true art that you collect when you buy the individual song nfts. And so kind of maintaining the structure where when the artist creates songs, so it's just become part of their catalog and they just stand right alongside all the other songs in that, on that art Spotify page while also having a deeper experience to really go deeper into the art if you want to explore the way that artists meant for them all to be recombined in the iloch and kind of make the NFT format kind of be the deeper meaning of the music while making the traditional distributed music still completely coherent and able to stand on its own.
01:19:25.600 - 01:20:00.942, Speaker A: Interesting. The way this would work is you would have to work hand in hand with the artist and the artist would release an album, a very standard album, right, on Spotify and Apple Music. But this will also be on chain, and there'll be 10,000 different copies that could be minted out of this original album, all with very unique changes to the tones of the music. Right. Or the background of the music or the vocals, etcetera. Generative piece, let's say. And then those 10,000 copies are minted and exclusive to the superfans that are.
01:20:00.942 - 01:20:02.318, Speaker A: They're holding that copy.
01:20:02.406 - 01:20:03.030, Speaker D: Yes.
01:20:03.182 - 01:20:15.622, Speaker A: And some of those copies could be enhanced. Right. Like, I mean, sometimes you listen to music, you're like, well, I like the vocals, but I don't really like the background music. And so you could change it to the point where the user is like, oh, I actually like this copy much more for myself.
01:20:15.718 - 01:20:24.306, Speaker B: I mean, yeah, I would hope so. Because you can imagine, like, I don't know if any of you listen to, like. Yeah, sort of like, different remixes, right?
01:20:24.330 - 01:20:24.934, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:20:25.234 - 01:20:30.674, Speaker B: Or, like, definitely dating myself, but, you know, nirvana unplugged album.
01:20:30.794 - 01:20:31.494, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:20:31.994 - 01:20:35.058, Speaker B: Versus, like, the original production of songs.
01:20:35.226 - 01:20:35.626, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:20:35.690 - 01:20:48.302, Speaker A: I mean, many. I've seen these special albums, right. That released pre released before the original album, and they may have this extra song that's included, and you have to buy that album just to get that extra song. But in this case, it's like, ten xing that.
01:20:48.358 - 01:20:48.550, Speaker D: Right.
01:20:48.582 - 01:20:59.846, Speaker A: Which is like, you as a fan, have the ability to create unique music based on my vocals and my background, and that's specific to you, and that could hold unique value because that's the only copy that's available.
01:21:00.030 - 01:21:00.350, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:21:00.382 - 01:21:05.782, Speaker B: Like, in one song, the middle section of song might include, like, a jazz piano solo.
01:21:05.918 - 01:21:06.382, Speaker D: Right.
01:21:06.478 - 01:21:13.970, Speaker B: And other copies of the song. You know, there might be more, like, you know, it might be like an improv synth and just kind of, like, pull size.
01:21:14.002 - 01:21:14.194, Speaker D: Great.
01:21:14.234 - 01:21:30.170, Speaker B: And so trying to find a different way to allow people to kind of experience the artist's intention. Intent, and have kind of, like, a deeper way to explore the work and also hopefully have a way to kind of form an emotional connection that's kind of, like, more meaningful.
01:21:30.322 - 01:21:51.530, Speaker A: Very interesting. So what does this mean for, like, on chain generative music? I mean, you had oiler beats that first launched, if you remember that, where you have the masters, then you can mint the LP's, and then they also release another collection called Futura. So that's, like, pure, just like, generative music, right?
01:21:51.602 - 01:21:52.018, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:21:52.106 - 01:21:57.050, Speaker A: And then you have in parallel sound music and sound XYZ that's creating, like, in the art.
01:21:57.162 - 01:21:57.714, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:21:57.834 - 01:22:22.376, Speaker A: And that's primarily, like, you know, a different way to distribute to super fans that superfans thesis, which is, you know, anyone that likes our music can mint for free, but the superfans get the actual copy of the song, and that's only specific to you. So that's kind of what's happening in a space right now. Do you see that merging? Is that what it is? Like, you know, could you see Euler beats importing music or background into these types of songs? Like, where does it all kind of go?
01:22:22.400 - 01:22:50.160, Speaker B: I would say it's sort of, like, a little bit of a hybrid. Like, euler beats, I think, was really going all in on, like, the beat is, like, literally, algorithmically generated. Yes. I think that was really interesting. Was a fan of oily beats as a project. I'm not sure that I would, like, put an oily beat on my playlist to listen to in the car, if that makes sense. And so I'm sort of.
01:22:50.160 - 01:23:10.470, Speaker B: But I think there was a lot of magic in that, if that makes sense. And so kind of finding a way to get that while also getting the chance that, hey, this could literally be your favorite song at the same time. And so kind of, like, maybe hybrid approach. Maybe if it works, it might end up looking like the best of both worlds.
01:23:10.622 - 01:23:11.046, Speaker D: Cool.
01:23:11.110 - 01:23:17.994, Speaker A: Well, I think we're at time. Any final thoughts, words that you want to leave our audience with?
01:23:18.574 - 01:23:25.374, Speaker B: Don't get too confident in anything because it's just a very, everything's really new and, you know.
01:23:25.494 - 01:23:25.862, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:23:25.918 - 01:23:27.386, Speaker B: Things can change very quickly.
01:23:27.510 - 01:23:28.170, Speaker D: Cool.
01:23:28.322 - 01:23:40.314, Speaker A: Scott, thanks so much for your time. And for those that want to reach out to Scott, you could find him on Twitter. He's working on Kantos as well, and that's something you can find on his, on his profile. Thanks so much for joining, and we'll catch you next time.
01:23:40.394 - 01:23:41.810, Speaker B: Thanks, y'all. Really appreciate it.
01:23:41.842 - 01:23:46.754, Speaker A: Thanks. Thanks for listening to good game. Don't forget to subscribe. We'll see you next week.
