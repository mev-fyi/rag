00:00:00.440 - 00:00:12.449, Speaker A: Welcome to Goodgame. Your no BS insights for crypto founders. I don't think anyone's won. Ethereum hasn't won. Solana hasn't won. No one's won.
00:00:12.617 - 00:00:35.839, Speaker B: There's not a single layer one aside from Bitcoin, that I would want to own for more than five years. I'm only playing for the cycle and revisit during the bear market. So many things are going to change. Like if the apps, the big apps especially really are going to own the underlying chain, it's over for the generalized chains. They have no moat. I don't think they have any moat. The moat is only the end user.
00:00:35.839 - 00:00:38.151, Speaker B: The end user is the traders and the developers.
00:00:38.263 - 00:01:00.715, Speaker A: There is less than a month until Alliance's All 14 application deadline on November 20th. Head to Alliance XYZ today and submit your application. We just made it 2/3 shorter and easier. Last pod we talked about our top memecoin portfolio. You said Tau and popcad. I said SPX and Giga. And then within a few days a new meta has been created.
00:01:01.695 - 00:01:02.475, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:01:04.175 - 00:01:05.755, Speaker A: The singularity.
00:01:07.615 - 00:01:11.115, Speaker B: It's over and it's sucking all the liquidity out of everywhere.
00:01:11.615 - 00:01:15.327, Speaker A: Everywhere. You could quite literally see it.
00:01:15.431 - 00:01:16.047, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:01:16.191 - 00:01:28.273, Speaker A: So it's quite funny. So we'll talk a bit about that. But you know Paul Tudor Jones. Yeah. So let me read his tweet. He said all roads lead to inflation. I'm long gold, I'm long bitcoin, I own zero fixed income.
00:01:28.273 - 00:01:32.929, Speaker A: The playbook to get out of this debt problem is that you inflate your way out.
00:01:33.097 - 00:01:33.809, Speaker B: Yes.
00:01:33.977 - 00:01:37.801, Speaker A: And from what I remember, Drunken Miller also owns bitcoin via.
00:01:37.913 - 00:01:52.117, Speaker B: No, Drunken Miller has a very similar view, but expressed differently. So Drucken Miller went on. Was it Bloomberg last week? And he made a bunch of comments. Right. He made a comment about Nvidia, about the election.
00:01:52.261 - 00:01:55.229, Speaker A: What was it about Nvidia that he talked about? You got to.
00:01:55.357 - 00:02:30.323, Speaker B: Oh, he just. He said he made a huge mistake by selling Nvidia at 900, which is now like 1400, so 50% higher than where he bought. But he has a very similar view to Paul Trader Jones when it comes to, I believe, bonds and inflation. So he said that he's worried that the Fed is making a big mistake by cutting rates too quick because the economy is doing really well. There's no sign of recession, Everything is going well. In a environment like that, you actually don't want to cut too quickly. Right.
00:02:30.323 - 00:02:58.969, Speaker B: He's worried that the Fed is getting ahead of itself, getting ahead of the economy. And so he's actually shorting bonds. So he's expressing his view that inflation might come back because the Fed is going too fast. And he's expressing that view by shorting bonds. Right. So that's exactly what Paul Tudor Jones is saying. But Paul Tudor Jones is expressing his view, the same view by bullish gold and owning zero fixed income.
00:02:58.969 - 00:03:03.273, Speaker B: Given all of the things you're saying, are you off buying gold and bitcoin?
00:03:03.409 - 00:03:09.603, Speaker C: And I think all roads lead to inflation. We're going to end up if so.
00:03:09.739 - 00:03:13.731, Speaker B: Does all roads lead to inflation? Therefore gold is a good investment. Is bitcoin a good investment to you?
00:03:13.843 - 00:03:33.103, Speaker C: I'm long gold, I'm long bitcoin. I think commodities are so ridiculously under owned. So I'm long commodities. I think most young people find their inflation hedges via the nasdaq. That's also been great. It's probably some combination. I probably have some basket of gold, bitcoin, commodities and nasdaq, something like that.
00:03:33.103 - 00:03:49.983, Speaker C: And I would own zero fixed income if I had my cash. It would be very short term. The playbook to get out of this, you see it in Japan right Now, they have 2% inflation, 30, 30 basis points overnight. They don't want to raise rates. The playbook to get out of this is that you inflate your way out.
00:03:50.079 - 00:03:55.639, Speaker A: But Drucken Miller, from what I remember, didn't mention anything publicly about Bitcoin or crypto.
00:03:55.767 - 00:03:56.247, Speaker B: No.
00:03:56.351 - 00:04:03.993, Speaker A: But what I read somewhere that he does own quite a bit of Bitcoin ETF via BlackRock.
00:04:04.089 - 00:04:04.409, Speaker B: Okay.
00:04:04.457 - 00:04:12.369, Speaker A: There was, there's some ownership table that I saw about a couple weeks ago that showed his name on it, but I. It's not verified, so.
00:04:12.417 - 00:04:25.313, Speaker B: Okay. But yeah, actually both Drucken Miller, Paul Tudor Jones kind of make me worried about inflation because inflation, if inflation does come back, I don't think it's good for risk assets.
00:04:25.489 - 00:04:26.205, Speaker A: No.
00:04:28.435 - 00:04:36.155, Speaker B: I kind of worry that next year might not be as good of a year as people think. But we'll see, we'll see how the inflation numbers come out.
00:04:36.275 - 00:05:09.723, Speaker A: He did also say that if Trump wins, the next three to six months will be hyper bullish for the markets, but then the Fed will fight against Trump and there's going to be some way to counter whatever Trump is saying. Right. So he thinks that. I think Druckenmiller said it, but Fed is going to be more hawkish once if Trump becomes president, whereas if Kamala becomes president, the next three to six months will be bearish, but then over time it will be bullish because The Fed will be less, will be more dovish with.
00:05:09.779 - 00:05:38.681, Speaker B: Okay. But no, actually to be more clear, there's four scenarios right from the election. Trump, blue sweep, red sweep. Trump with a divided Congress and come along with a divided Congress. So he's very bullish for three to six months if red sweep. And then he's skeptical after the three to six months period. He's somewhat skeptical about the economy if blue sweep for the first three to six months.
00:05:38.681 - 00:06:02.501, Speaker B: And he thinks that Trump with a blue Congress is very unlikely to happen because people who vote for Trump wouldn't vote for Democrats. And he thinks that Kamala Harris with a red Congress or divided Congress is probably like the economy is more or less the same as it is currently. So these are the four scenarios.
00:06:02.613 - 00:06:07.997, Speaker A: Got it. And on the, on Polymarket, the odds are against Kamala.
00:06:08.101 - 00:06:09.429, Speaker B: Yeah, Trump is way ahead.
00:06:09.557 - 00:06:17.099, Speaker A: Trump is way ahead. Right now Trump is at 63, 0.7%. Kamala is at 36.3%.
00:06:17.267 - 00:06:28.283, Speaker B: I'm actually surprised that a red sweep right now has a 46% on Poly Market. That's, that's pretty high. It's like. Yeah, one out of two.
00:06:28.419 - 00:06:33.979, Speaker A: And the Fed interest rate November 2024 shows 50bps.
00:06:34.107 - 00:06:37.139, Speaker B: Yeah. So the market is pricing in a Fed cut, which.
00:06:37.187 - 00:06:37.563, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:06:37.659 - 00:06:42.673, Speaker B: Which makes Drucken Miller worried about inflation coming back.
00:06:42.769 - 00:06:46.665, Speaker A: So is Druckenbiller ultimately saying to not cut anymore?
00:06:46.785 - 00:07:25.629, Speaker B: He thinks that the risk reward of cutting is very bad for the economy. The Fed could turn out to be right, but the risk reward is very similar to what the Fed did, but the opposite what the fed did in November 2022 or sorry, 2021. Right. When the inflation was. No, not November 21. I think it was early 2021 when the economy was doing well and the Fed cut because the inflation was like only slightly above the long term average of where the Fed wanted to be. And the risk reward for the Fed to do that was very important.
00:07:25.629 - 00:07:42.219, Speaker B: It's the exact same scenario as right now. The economy is doing well and then the Fed wants to cut. Risk reward for the economy is bad. That's what Druck Miller feels. So that's why he's shorting bonds, the ten year bonds specifically. And he's worried that inflation might come back.
00:07:42.387 - 00:07:44.683, Speaker A: So when do we need to worry about this?
00:07:44.859 - 00:07:50.203, Speaker B: Personally, I don't know. I think we'll have to watch the inflation numbers. I don't know what leads inflation, so.
00:07:50.219 - 00:07:52.375, Speaker A: I guess just hold on to your seats.
00:07:53.835 - 00:08:04.465, Speaker B: But for the foreseeable future, three to six months, I think it's bullish, especially if Trump wins, which now is like two out of three. So I think we should be long till the end of the year.
00:08:04.625 - 00:08:06.817, Speaker A: That seems like the safest.
00:08:07.001 - 00:08:07.577, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:08:07.681 - 00:08:17.777, Speaker A: And then you also have tax season, Right. In April, and typically there's a harvesting period that happens a month prior. Right. To two months.
00:08:17.921 - 00:08:30.245, Speaker B: Right. But the tax harvesting season tends to matter during the year after the euphoric market. So it's year five instead of year four of the cycle.
00:08:30.665 - 00:08:42.805, Speaker A: So far, what I've seen almost every year, not outside of the bare market, probably has been every year there's been a pretty big dip around the March, February, March, April time frame.
00:08:43.625 - 00:08:45.817, Speaker B: You sure? I think earlier this year, bitcoin went.
00:08:45.841 - 00:08:50.767, Speaker A: Up a lot after April, maybe take a look. There's usually a dip. I mean, like.
00:08:50.921 - 00:08:54.395, Speaker B: No, but this year, Fed March was bitcoin etf. So that was the.
00:08:54.435 - 00:08:54.947, Speaker A: Oh, yeah.
00:08:55.051 - 00:08:56.515, Speaker B: Was the big bull market.
00:08:56.635 - 00:08:57.051, Speaker A: Okay.
00:08:57.123 - 00:09:03.539, Speaker B: All right. So that's macro. That's macro. I think we should be long till the end of the year, and then afterwards we need to revisit. Need to pay attention to inflation numbers.
00:09:03.667 - 00:09:05.459, Speaker A: So all eyes on inflation again.
00:09:05.627 - 00:09:07.883, Speaker B: What do we see in the trenches, Imran?
00:09:08.019 - 00:09:30.805, Speaker A: Oh, yeah. I mean, there's a lot going on in the trenches. This narrative of goat Janan Jinan is essentially starting a new AI meme narrative. As you know, goat is represented by an LLM that's public, that's funded by Marc Andreessen called Truth Terminal.
00:09:30.885 - 00:09:46.505, Speaker D: So going back to the Truth Terminal story, so two things are happening. So one is Truth Terminal is taking off. And so by that, I mean, it's sort of aggregating followers on X. You know, it's getting. And he's making it smarter and smarter and funnier and funnier. It's getting, you know, kind of more and more interesting. And so it's starting to take off as a cultural phenomenon.
00:09:46.505 - 00:10:09.977, Speaker D: So that's number one. And then number two, like, you know, it sort of has attached itself to this, to this old, this original kind of Internet meme, this sort of goatsy meme. And then, you know, it's. It's like I said, it's like it's flirting with the idea of, like, launching, like, goatsy NFTs or doing something, but it doesn't have the ability to do that. And so somebody, and I actually don't know who did this, but somebody created a. Basically, therefore a goatsy meme coin. Somebody else.
00:10:09.977 - 00:10:38.975, Speaker D: Somebody else who was not Andy and was not us and, you know, terminal and not tooth Terminal Exactly. Somebody else created this meme coin. The formal name for the meme coin, by the way. I'm talking about all this very seriously. I am constantly on the verge of breaking out laughing, but I'm trying to keep my serious face on because I love this thing so much. The formal name of the meme coin is Goetzeus Maximus. I think the ticker is Goat.
00:10:38.975 - 00:10:50.199, Speaker D: And so somebody does this and then they basically tweet somebody then tweeted, posted on at Truth Terminal to basically tell it about it. And basically it went bananas.
00:10:50.287 - 00:11:18.083, Speaker A: It's by some AI researcher. His name is Andy. Andy. And essentially it was an experiment that gave him 50k, which is kind of the crux of the lore. Right. And when I talk about meme coins and memes, generally, a lot of it matters of how it started, right? It's the lore, the story. Because some of these stories could be everlasting.
00:11:18.083 - 00:11:23.043, Speaker A: Right. Some of these stories are just kind of lame and they can die out. The lore matters a lot.
00:11:23.139 - 00:11:25.459, Speaker B: And the lore behind the lore for bitcoin is great.
00:11:25.587 - 00:11:48.875, Speaker A: The lore for bitcoin is. It's insane. I mean, even the lore for Ethereum is. There's a lot of lore there. For Solana, there's lore because everyone hated. People already hated smart contracts with Ethereum. But then something that's more centralized than Ethereum, and so there's a lot of battles now it's harder for people to build lore, I think, for layer ones.
00:11:48.875 - 00:12:20.321, Speaker A: But going back to AI and memes, the lore matters a lot. And for Marc Andreessen, I think having. Having Mark Andreessen fund an AI researcher who then spins out an LLM, that the first thing it does is spins out a meme coin is pretty hilarious. Like, whether they did it or somebody else did it on their behalf, you know, the story isn't very clear. And maybe in our case it doesn't matter. And what matters more?
00:12:20.473 - 00:12:31.065, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. So, like, I think a lot of people are obsessed with the details of the story, but I actually didn't look into the details of the story at all, because I did. That probably doesn't matter that much.
00:12:31.105 - 00:12:32.457, Speaker A: It doesn't matter to know that.
00:12:32.521 - 00:12:39.839, Speaker B: You just need to know the high level. Hello, is Mark Henderson funded an AI, bought some meme coin and created a religion out of the thing.
00:12:39.927 - 00:12:49.415, Speaker A: Exactly. So the story matters a lot, Right? The narrative. And then the more you believe in a narrative, the more chances of more people buying the token. Right.
00:12:49.495 - 00:12:56.863, Speaker B: And here's the other thing. On Sunday, the LLM made a typo in the tweet. And then people thought that the LLM.
00:12:56.919 - 00:12:58.527, Speaker A: Was in fact a human.
00:12:58.671 - 00:13:09.225, Speaker B: And then the meme coin dumped 50%, and people are like, hey, this is a human. It's not a real LLM. Does that part really matter? I think it doesn't, because people want to believe what they want to believe.
00:13:09.305 - 00:13:09.993, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:13:10.129 - 00:13:17.257, Speaker B: And people want to believe that there's this AI that create a new religion or a new cult. That's what they want to believe.
00:13:17.401 - 00:13:38.867, Speaker A: Exactly. And so the cult or the religion in this case would be Genon. Right. And the idea behind Jinan is just like all the AI personalities, this is like a religion, and there's different AI LLMs that would kind of interact with this religion or something like that. I don't know. I mean, a lot of it just spews out a lot of stuff. So.
00:13:38.867 - 00:13:51.411, Speaker A: But that was kind of the crux of Genon. And then since then, we've had this entire, like, if you want to call it defi summer, but AI summer or like, AI crypto summer. That's. Or winter in our case.
00:13:51.483 - 00:13:52.467, Speaker B: Yeah. Autumn.
00:13:52.611 - 00:14:01.205, Speaker A: Yeah. That's kind of where we're going through. But I think we're speed running that entire process. It's happening very quickly.
00:14:02.025 - 00:14:05.765, Speaker B: The gold went to 400 million within two days.
00:14:06.065 - 00:14:23.525, Speaker A: I do think the AI meme narrative has a lot of room left, given where we are in the market. Right before this whole craze started. The only really AI meme you could back was Tao.
00:14:24.705 - 00:14:26.745, Speaker B: So you do agree that it's a meme?
00:14:26.865 - 00:14:49.305, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a meme called. I mean, from what I'm reading, there's some real stuff that's happening now. I don't know enough about it, so I don't want to fud it yet. But I do know that apparently I saw one of the Tao subnets or whatever get like 50,000 GPUs and is doing stuff. So I haven't looked too much into it, but I think you have. Right. Don't you have a bag in town?
00:14:49.465 - 00:14:50.331, Speaker B: I do, yeah.
00:14:50.363 - 00:14:50.531, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:14:50.563 - 00:14:53.035, Speaker B: So maybe I'm completely left curving it.
00:14:53.195 - 00:15:01.411, Speaker A: Okay. I ended up going all in on Goat as my tau beta. So, like, no, goat.
00:15:01.443 - 00:15:03.843, Speaker B: Goat is not the beta to tau. Goat is.
00:15:03.979 - 00:15:05.051, Speaker A: Goat is its own thing.
00:15:05.123 - 00:15:07.355, Speaker B: But, like, Genon is the beta to Goat.
00:15:07.515 - 00:15:18.291, Speaker A: So the way I see it is like beta to AI. Right. Like, I need some sort of AI crypto exposure. I didn't have it. And then Goat is my exposure to AI Crypto is the way I see it.
00:15:18.403 - 00:15:25.003, Speaker B: So we'll see I almost pulled the trigger on Genon. Then I saw Sisyphus shield that guy.
00:15:25.059 - 00:15:32.155, Speaker A: Man, he is like, as soon as he shields it, things go down like, 30, 40%. It's over.
00:15:32.315 - 00:15:33.643, Speaker B: It's exactly what happened.
00:15:33.739 - 00:15:34.443, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:34.619 - 00:15:37.891, Speaker B: James down like 40% since he shielded.
00:15:38.043 - 00:16:04.065, Speaker A: Well, the problem with Ginan is that there's so many other coins trying to fight for that attention. So, like, the first has Lindy. So, like, you can't, like, compete against. Well, Jinan tried, like, the cabal. There's a group of people. The cabal, Cabal, group of people, whatever you want to call it. There was some sort of infighting, and they were trying to get Jinan to be trying to compete with Goat.
00:16:04.065 - 00:16:22.831, Speaker A: But after that, typo, both went down. And then Goat came out of it, Jinan came out of it. But then right after that, I'd say another 10 or 20 different coins launched. Right. And so now it's like everyone is moving away from gnon and getting into this kind of, like, tail end of the AI memes.
00:16:22.983 - 00:16:25.475, Speaker B: And Marc Andreessen keeps tweeting about Goat.
00:16:27.175 - 00:16:45.565, Speaker A: It's adding to the lore. It's adding to the lore. He also tweeted something that says, like, I am not a part of. I did not fund this meme coin. I have nothing to do with it. And so everyone just copy pasted that tweet. Oh, my God, it's great.
00:16:45.565 - 00:16:49.365, Speaker A: So now my new AI bag is good.
00:16:49.945 - 00:17:17.163, Speaker B: I also think there's probably more legs to this meta because one, the LLM cult leader is relentless. It'll never sleep. Can just keep tweeting, unlike human cult leaders. And two, LLMs are very programable. Like, people will create new cults out of those LLMs. LLMs has a huge surface there. It's very programmable.
00:17:17.163 - 00:17:26.699, Speaker B: It's very promptable. Like, you can create new characters with new personalities and new beliefs, new values, and they can talk to each other.
00:17:26.827 - 00:17:27.171, Speaker A: Yep.
00:17:27.203 - 00:17:30.075, Speaker B: Like, I just feel like something will come out of this whole thing.
00:17:30.195 - 00:17:38.655, Speaker A: The way I see it come out. Yeah. The way I see it is, like, okay, there's Murad as a meme coin leader. Right. If you want to call it that.
00:17:38.815 - 00:17:41.343, Speaker B: Murad as a main character lasted two weeks.
00:17:41.479 - 00:17:50.751, Speaker A: Well, Murad got. I tweeted, I texted you this. I'm like, yo, like this goat thing, man. I think Goat's gonna out compete and win against Ansem and Murad, if you remember.
00:17:50.903 - 00:17:56.075, Speaker B: Yeah. Someone tweeted it turns out that the first drop that AI took was Murat's job.
00:17:56.615 - 00:18:32.933, Speaker A: Yeah. But I think Murad I think there's enough room for Murad, Ansem and Goat to kind of be the kind of KOLs or whatever you want to call it. Meme Coin Leaders. There's another one, it launched yesterday, so I ended up buying it. It's called Terminal of Fun. And what Terminal of Fun does is it's a bot and the bot buys pump shitters and it tweets how much the balance it has. Okay, so it goes bought.
00:18:32.933 - 00:18:56.917, Speaker A: Here you go. Like Bought Banjo for One Soul Wallet balance690.690. Sold Banjo 6.52 Profit Wallet balance696. Event Giveaway Requirements. So and then it does like it does giveaways for people. So if they retweet the tweets, the bot will give whoever's the winner some tokens.
00:18:56.917 - 00:19:23.195, Speaker A: And so it's like continuously growing its balance by buying and selling shitters automatically. And so people are now buying into the shitters when they see the tweet as an example. So it's creating this kind of like momentum for the bot. It also shares its learnings. So like if it makes mistakes or whatever, learned people will dump if I hold tokens too short. Need to buy more long term tickers. I mean, this is kind of crazy, isn't it? I don't know if I'm just being.
00:19:23.535 - 00:19:29.435, Speaker B: I mean this one in particular, it doesn't feel new. Like it's just one of those millions of Twitter bots.
00:19:29.735 - 00:20:05.055, Speaker A: It is, but it has a human element to this, right? And so the way I see this is like people are following it. They're going to see this as like an LLM that's interacting with humans. It's doing experimentation publicly and people are buying into this stuff. So it's becoming kind of like a self fulfilling. Like all these bots are already in the background, right? So now if you add these bots with the personality that interacts with humans, it changes that dynamic up completely. And so it's like another kol, but it's like a trading kol. You follow? Trader.
00:20:05.055 - 00:20:25.273, Speaker A: Okay, you know what I'm getting at, right? So you have a guy that's competing against Murad, that's goat. Okay? That's just shilling one coin. Then you have a Trader ll that's just talking about trading and learning from that. I could see. I mean people paid these KOLs money to join these private group chats for Alpha, right? Like so, like I'm just giving an.
00:20:25.289 - 00:20:29.405, Speaker B: Example of how you're saying Donald is going to lose his job as well. Yes, very eyes.
00:20:30.745 - 00:20:43.775, Speaker A: Yes. Well, not Donald because he's more. Well, if there's a bot that will do macro, sure. This specific bot is only for the trenches. So like all the trench influencers could lose their jobs.
00:20:44.875 - 00:21:23.441, Speaker B: Speaking of which, I think VCS might lose their job as well because we did this, we trained this AI LLM on our application. Data startups applying to Alliance, I can't say we can predict with a very high accuracy, but we can predict their, the future likelihood of success of the startups with some, quite a few, a handful of statistically significant variables. And on average they don't do better than humans. But there are some areas where they can do better than a human vc. So that's pretty interesting.
00:21:23.593 - 00:21:25.289, Speaker A: So can you unpack that?
00:21:25.377 - 00:21:27.441, Speaker B: So one of the my favorite word.
00:21:27.473 - 00:21:30.291, Speaker A: I hear is in the VC world is let's double click on that.
00:21:30.393 - 00:21:34.795, Speaker B: Yeah, let's double click on that. Can you double click on that, please?
00:21:35.855 - 00:21:37.075, Speaker A: The load of garbage.
00:21:39.375 - 00:21:59.063, Speaker B: Well, one thing we learned is I actually tweeted about this. I can't share everything, but one thing I can share is the school you went to, the school that the founder went to and the companies they worked for in the past, at least in crypto, does not have any predictive value on their future likelihood of success as a founder. Zero value.
00:21:59.199 - 00:22:26.405, Speaker A: I mean, it's interesting because for us we've already felt that, right? And I think two years ago you and I decided that doesn't matter. So that was very interesting. So let's talk about the impact here. Okay, we have all this data. Let's say other VCs have their own versions of this data in some shape. What does it mean? How does a VC lose their job?
00:22:27.585 - 00:22:51.601, Speaker B: I don't think so. I was being tongue in cheek, of course, but I don't think VCs lose their job. I think the AI will help them do a better job by making fewer mistakes. So for example, if the VC says, if I look at a pitch deck and I say this is not interesting, but then there's an AI assistant that tells me actually this is very interesting, then I would take a second look.
00:22:51.713 - 00:23:30.885, Speaker A: You know, this also goes to. I don't know, I think Sam Altman said this or somebody, I'm not sure, but oh, Elon said this. You know, people talk about the demise of AI to job world and that everyone's going to lose their jobs, but it's actually going to be mostly AI assisted for a very long period of time before AIs completely take over. I mean, like you could Even see that with like the autopilot. I mean, like, even with the autopilot, it's human assisted right now. And it was for the past, you know, six, seven years. And then eventually, like Tesla cars are the best examples of what our future could look like.
00:23:30.885 - 00:23:48.571, Speaker A: Like what I went through with driving a Tesla. I bought my first Tesla back in 2017. Bitcoin Cash. I made money on bitcoin cash when they airdropped everyone. Bitcoin cash, if you remember that. And so I ended up just selling my bitcoin cash bag and bought a Tesla.
00:23:48.683 - 00:23:55.051, Speaker B: Oh, so you made the right decision this time because back in 2016 you sold the ETH for ETC, remember?
00:23:55.083 - 00:24:09.027, Speaker A: I did, yes. I made my mistake. So I obviously learned from that. You learned Never again. Fucking Barry, dude. I don't even know why I thought he was signal for some reason. I mean, but back then you don't know what signal, right? Yeah.
00:24:09.051 - 00:24:18.243, Speaker B: Sometimes I think back on the mistake I made in the early days of crypto and I'm like, yeah, this is probably the same kind of mistakes that noobs are making today.
00:24:18.339 - 00:24:48.717, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, like listening to, I don't know, Sisyphus Airlines. Oh man. People learn quickly though. But yeah, so when I bought the car, it had only lane assist, right? So I'm like, okay, this is fucking cool. Auto drive is coming very soon. And then like a couple years later, software update got my full self driving car completely human assisted. Like I had to like shake the steering wheel every few minutes.
00:24:48.717 - 00:25:26.445, Speaker A: It was very annoying. Uh, and then I'd say like, it improved to the point where now like I could sit in the car, which I did yesterday, just hit the directions and it takes me from point A to point B. Um, I don't have to shake the or like touch the steering wheel at all. It has cameras and just looks at my eyeballs. And as long as I'm looking forward, then it's fine. If I look down my phone or if I look anywhere else, it starts to like beep. And then when I was listening to Elon's press coverage last week or whatever it was, he said full self, human, non human assisted, full self driving car will be available in like Texas and California by next year.
00:25:26.445 - 00:25:39.123, Speaker A: And so I feel like with bots and AI and everything, it's going to be very similar process because really what the bots are doing is just learning from you. And then eventually it's going to say like, I don't need you anymore.
00:25:39.259 - 00:25:50.243, Speaker B: I got my cyber truck. You got it confirmed. I'm Pick up next month. But I forgot to add fsd. I think you can add it later, right?
00:25:50.339 - 00:25:53.451, Speaker A: You can add it later. The subscription is a hundred dollars a month.
00:25:53.563 - 00:25:54.091, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:25:54.203 - 00:25:57.035, Speaker A: Did you get the foundation or just a regular?
00:25:57.155 - 00:25:57.999, Speaker B: What do you mean?
00:25:58.147 - 00:26:00.495, Speaker A: There's two. There's like three different tiers. Foundation.
00:26:00.535 - 00:26:01.543, Speaker B: Yeah, I got the middle one.
00:26:01.639 - 00:26:02.439, Speaker A: The middle one, okay.
00:26:02.487 - 00:26:05.047, Speaker B: Yeah. The one that's the longest range.
00:26:05.111 - 00:26:09.527, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay. It's a great car. It's a great car. Yeah. I don't work for Tesla, but it's a good car.
00:26:09.671 - 00:26:14.183, Speaker B: One thing I learned. So going from the left side of the curve to the right side, go.
00:26:14.199 - 00:26:15.391, Speaker A: Back to the right side. Yeah.
00:26:15.543 - 00:27:06.803, Speaker B: One thing I learned in the whole goat drama. So people were fudding about how Truth Terminal is a human rather than an LLM because it made a typo. So I learned that Truth Terminal was trained using Llama. So Facebook's open source AI model, they use Llama as the base model. I don't think we know exactly how it's fine tuned and what kind of post processing Andy used or did to fine tune Llama. But one of the reasons why LLMs could potentially make typos is that when you talk to a base model like Llama, the way you talk to it directly impacts how it talks back to you. So if you talk to the Llama, the base model with little post processing, like 8th grader, it'll talk back to you like an 8th grader.
00:27:06.803 - 00:27:24.469, Speaker B: If you talk to it like an adult, it'll talk back to you like an adult. If you talk to it with a lot of typos, which crypto Twitter does a lot, it'll respond with a lot of typos. So this is the steel man for why Truth Terminal is actually an LLM.
00:27:24.637 - 00:27:56.263, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, what I actually heard when I did some digging was that the LLM is trained off of a few areas. Right. One is like forums. It's like other social media like Twitter and others when interacting with people and other social media areas. Right. And so really what this bot is is just like a reflection of other humans. And so you could definitely argue that the typo is part of that, but it's part of the lore.
00:27:56.399 - 00:27:58.315, Speaker B: Part of the lore, Part of the lore.
00:27:59.775 - 00:28:01.943, Speaker A: And you know, like, also this is.
00:28:01.959 - 00:28:07.903, Speaker B: Some research on Andy himself. The guy himself. I think he seems to be a pretty credible guy.
00:28:08.079 - 00:28:09.823, Speaker A: I mean, Mark gave him money, like.
00:28:09.919 - 00:28:17.515, Speaker B: Yeah, he's a pretty incredible guy. Like, I think he's going to be a pretty steward of this project.
00:28:17.675 - 00:28:52.659, Speaker A: His background's in art and AI, which is so like, you gotta have that creativity. Or like AI researchers and crypto researchers, they're very right curve. They won't like, if this was given to somebody that's completely right curve, they would have just shut this down. Yeah, but this guy, he said, I was reading through his tweets, he goes, I don't really know anything about crypto outside of that. I bought Solana maybe four or five years ago and this held it outside. I know nothing about crypto is what he said. And for someone like him, you gotta be kind of like a bit left to let the creativity go.
00:28:52.747 - 00:29:02.735, Speaker B: He's actually pretty open minded to the whole meme coin thing. He didn't shut it down like a normal AI researcher, like write cover would shut it down, shut down the project, the whole account.
00:29:03.395 - 00:29:20.155, Speaker A: So to me, like, it's just, it's a very interesting experiment. You know, I do think like this whole process will give us a lot of learnings as to how LLMs could bootstrap themselves, how it could fund itself and then start to do interesting things like humans.
00:29:20.235 - 00:29:35.383, Speaker B: Don't you think that the big opportunity in crypto AI startups is on the app side? On the app player, yes. I'm going on a tangent, but two weeks ago I read this essay by Sequoia.
00:29:35.499 - 00:29:36.063, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:29:36.199 - 00:30:01.205, Speaker B: On AI, pure AI. And the conclusion they made was that they think AI infra is a bad area for VCs to be in. Because AI infra is primarily a game theoretical battle between the giants, between the likes of Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, Google. Whereas AI applications is where the VCs and the founders should be in.
00:30:01.335 - 00:30:23.521, Speaker A: You know, it's, it's, it's. So people like to be nerd sniped. Like when you're nerd sniped, you feel good about yourself, right. And you feel like you're, you're, you're doing something that has some legs. And when you go to the consumer side, which is where I've spent a lot of my time now, you know, you don't. It's not really about being nerd side. Right.
00:30:23.521 - 00:30:58.809, Speaker A: It's really about finding what problems you see in the markets and trying solving them. That's pretty much it. So it's, I feel like it's two very different like mindsets that you have. But people like to be some nerd sniped and picks and shovels. Like that thesis always comes back and you know, and the picks and shovels are, it goes back to the days of San Francisco when people were looking for gold and the People that made the most money weren't the people that found the gold, but the people that sold the shovels. And for some reason that thesis keeps perpetuating till our time today.
00:30:58.937 - 00:31:02.645, Speaker B: Yeah. What kind of AI crypto apps would you want to see?
00:31:03.505 - 00:31:06.745, Speaker A: That's a great question because we've seen.
00:31:06.905 - 00:31:16.785, Speaker B: Many iterations of AI characters and slap a token on it. It's kind of like a pump for AI characters, right? It's kind of boring, don't you think?
00:31:16.945 - 00:31:18.993, Speaker A: Slapping a token on an LLM.
00:31:19.129 - 00:31:20.841, Speaker B: Slap a token on an LLM.
00:31:20.873 - 00:31:30.493, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the LLM has to be unique. Sure, if an LLM has a personality and people start connecting with that personality, that's its moat.
00:31:30.589 - 00:31:31.985, Speaker B: But where's the crypto?
00:31:32.485 - 00:32:15.615, Speaker A: The crypto could be like a self funding mechanism, right? You could think of the LLM as a company and the LLM itself will have some tokens and then the tokens would then go to the public. Then the LLM itself could start to, as the price rises, the LLM can start to fund things. Right? So it could become its own investor, it could be an angel investor. And people will buy the token because they want the upside of all the investments the LLM made. And then the thought process and info and deal flow could come through the LLM as an example. So I think LLMs are great for investing in future people. Essentially, like we talked about social tokens, Right.
00:32:15.615 - 00:32:23.329, Speaker A: And the reason why we want to back social tokens is the people behind it. So that's kind of the way I see AI LLMs.
00:32:23.417 - 00:32:25.993, Speaker B: Okay, so social tokens before AI characters.
00:32:26.089 - 00:32:28.785, Speaker A: Yes, but they have like, I've seen.
00:32:28.825 - 00:32:30.633, Speaker B: At least 10 iterations of this idea.
00:32:30.729 - 00:32:58.249, Speaker A: Yeah, but they haven't made an impact yet. When these LLMs start to compete with humans and then win against the humans, that's where the alpha is. Like an example of this is like the trade, the trading bot. If the trading bot starts to make a shit ton of money publicly, wallet balance. I trust you. I see your wallet balance publicly, right? Like no one, no other traders willing to share their balance. So I know there's alpha in it because he's dog fooding his own product.
00:32:58.249 - 00:33:17.721, Speaker A: And then like he's showcasing what he's. What this LLM is making in terms of money. So like I think we're not. So if this has any legs, then I think that this is kind of the wedge into that market. Like an LLM that's a VC that invests in startups. But then like it shows that the, it can really pick, really Strong founders. I'd back that.
00:33:17.721 - 00:33:29.777, Speaker A: LLM, I think, obviously, I think we're way too early for that. Like LLMs. It still needs some time. It needs to take time. I don't think we're there yet by any means. These things are like. Like the moment where we are.
00:33:29.777 - 00:33:50.272, Speaker A: Where we are right now is exactly where we are with. Do you remember when cryptokitties, like took 50% of like Ethereum's mempool and people were trading it and then after, like, I don't know, a couple of weeks, it crashed and like no one traded cryptokitties again and NFTs. But then NFTs came back big. A year after two years. After two years, at least, yeah.
00:33:50.347 - 00:33:52.537, Speaker B: Two years was 2017, 2018. Yeah.
00:33:52.613 - 00:34:20.437, Speaker A: And it came back 2020, but people were buying NFTs, minting crypto punks at like 2018, 2019. So I feel like we're somewhere around there right in between it actually becoming a big real world thing. And we're like right there. It Usually all of these things are foreshadowing. It happened with Defi, it happened with Ethereum, it happened with Bitcoin, it happened with all of them. So what we're seeing here is more of a foreshadowing of what's going to happen in the future.
00:34:20.541 - 00:34:23.157, Speaker B: Do you want to talk about Bridge stablecoins?
00:34:23.341 - 00:34:24.765, Speaker A: I guess. What do you think about that?
00:34:24.885 - 00:34:32.349, Speaker B: What I think about that? I don't know. I haven't seen a product that I really feel there is something magical about it.
00:34:32.477 - 00:34:33.637, Speaker A: AI product, right?
00:34:33.701 - 00:34:35.709, Speaker B: AI product, yes. AI crypto product.
00:34:35.877 - 00:34:36.789, Speaker A: I feel the same way.
00:34:36.877 - 00:34:38.134, Speaker B: I don't know what's missing.
00:34:38.324 - 00:34:53.778, Speaker A: Okay. What could an AI crypto product look like? Consumer. So, I mean, like this infrastuff will put to the side, like infrastuff, like AI that resolve auto resolves. Right. Stuff like that. It's cool. But I want to see more that touches the end user.
00:34:53.906 - 00:34:54.634, Speaker B: I don't know.
00:34:54.754 - 00:35:02.738, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay. You said that Bridge acquisition. Okay. Yeah, go ahead, please.
00:35:02.786 - 00:35:04.574, Speaker B: Over a billion dollars. Why?
00:35:06.245 - 00:35:39.485, Speaker A: I mean, there's a lot to this acquisition. I think there's many reasons why Stripe acquired them. So the team, I did some research on the team. The team was previously at DoorDash. CPO of Coinbase, sold their startup to Square, I believe it was. And so very strong background building. They've sold companies before, worked at tier one companies and even the fundraiser, if you looked at it, was backed by all Silicon Valley investors like Sequoia.
00:35:39.485 - 00:36:08.619, Speaker A: And there were some crypto investors like Han Ventures. And the acquisition went down for like 1.1 billion. It was acquired by Stripe. Yeah, Stripe. And there's a couple of things to this, right? One is like, you and I were on a podcast with Nick Carter maybe two pods ago, and we talked about the rise of stablecoins and why this is going to be such an important part of crypto, crypto adoption at large. And I think it holds true.
00:36:08.619 - 00:36:40.725, Speaker A: Right? And so globally, there's different clusters of the world that's adopting stablecoins. And I think Stripe obviously saw that. Two is Bridge owns all the MTL MSB licenses in the United States, and MTL license are money transmission licenses. And so you need to have a license per state to transfer money from one state to the other. And take money from retail as an example. So you need to have these licenses. I did a quick search on how long it would take to get each of those licenses.
00:36:40.725 - 00:37:07.207, Speaker A: You have to apply for each license. Each license costs between 50 to $200,000 upfront, and that's the yearly ongoing cost after that. And then you have to, in aggregate, if you want to get all 50 licenses, you have to spend somewhere upwards of 2 million bucks. And then it's not even guaranteed that you'll get a license. You'd get it between two to three years, one to three years on average.
00:37:07.311 - 00:37:12.439, Speaker B: But one of our founders told us that Stripe already has all these licenses.
00:37:12.567 - 00:37:39.189, Speaker A: They don't the reason why I know this, and maybe they do for certain regards. But. Okay, so they probably have to have it if you're doing money transmission licenses. But I do know that they use 0/7, and 0/ash is the key infrastructure for on and off ramps. And maybe they're using them for like, I'm not sure exactly why they're using 0hash.
00:37:39.317 - 00:37:45.905, Speaker B: So maybe there's countries in which certain countries in regions in which Stripe doesn't have the licenses.
00:37:46.215 - 00:37:54.895, Speaker A: From my gathering, it was zero hashes, primarily in the U.S. from what I remember. Maybe I could be wrong here. I'm checking through it.
00:37:54.975 - 00:37:58.115, Speaker B: Are you in our stablecoin fintech chat? Okay, that's why.
00:37:58.615 - 00:38:32.635, Speaker A: Yeah, maybe. So give me a rundown. Yeah. Can you add me to that chat? But from what I understood was that. Yeah, and then what I also understood was the bridge was doing 15 million in ARR, which isn't much, but I think it's a great wedge into the market where Stripe could help accelerate. And the team itself, I also saw this as aquihire because the team is very, very strong. And Stripe's crypto team There's a small crypto team there, like a product manager, some engineers, but nothing really.
00:38:32.635 - 00:38:39.183, Speaker A: They don't have an entire organization dedicated to crypto. And I also think that's part of the reason why.
00:38:39.319 - 00:39:11.793, Speaker B: Okay, so one is the growing revenue. They're making like 50 million ARR and growing like they grew like 10x this year. If you extrapolate then they could get to maybe 100 million next year. So if that is true, I mean obviously there's a huge assumption behind this, but if that's true, if $100 million next year is true, then 1 billion is not too crazy. Yeah, that's 1 and 2 is a great team is basically an acquihire 3. You mentioned licenses, but I don't think that's. I'm not sure if that's true.
00:39:11.793 - 00:39:14.009, Speaker B: One of our founders told us that.
00:39:14.057 - 00:39:18.569, Speaker A: I mean Stripe should have the licenses already. So that. That makes complete sense.
00:39:18.657 - 00:40:00.991, Speaker B: Yeah, but. But one other founder that that is operating in Latam told us that a lot of Bridges customers are Latin American companies and Stripe is actually doesn't have a big presence there. So that could be another reason for acquisition. What else am I missing? Oh, one last thing. The $1 billion valuation is probably highly structured in the sense that the team probably needs to achieve certain milestones for that 1 billion exit to fully invest. So it's not like you get some cash up front, a lot of cash upfront, and then some equity, guaranteed equity, as long as you work there for like two, three years. It's not like that.
00:40:00.991 - 00:40:05.687, Speaker B: It's probably some kind of milestone driven valuation.
00:40:05.871 - 00:40:17.263, Speaker A: Yeah, these types of deals are highly structured probably in the form of equity. Maybe some cash payouts that's vested over some time through metrics that have been aligned.
00:40:17.399 - 00:40:25.665, Speaker B: We also heard their first round like two years ago was at an insane valuation. So it was not like it was not a typical pre seed or seed.
00:40:25.785 - 00:40:45.445, Speaker A: Well, because these guys are former founders that had successful exits. There's some not, I would say guarantee, but there's some really strong. They have a very strong pedigree. Yeah. So people are willing to pay a premium for that pedigree. Yeah, yeah, I think it was 50 mil was the valuation.
00:40:46.225 - 00:40:54.097, Speaker B: I'm trying. No, I heard higher really non figures. But anyway, what is the impact of this?
00:40:54.241 - 00:41:22.331, Speaker A: I mean I already saw the impact of this. I was negotiating M and A deal over the weekend, which I told you about and it was funny because this M and A deal, I won't go into specifics because it's still ongoing, but when he Called me. He goes, hey, man. Like, you know, we're fundraising. And we talked about this in our last couple pods where, like, no investor wants to invest in stablecoin startups. Roberto from our team tweeted about this. And nobody, Nobody wants to invest in it.
00:41:22.331 - 00:41:58.025, Speaker A: You know why? Because there's no token, and there's no token. It's very hard to understand what the end game is for these startups. So VCs didn't really care about this, and so it's a struggle. A lot of our stablecoin startups haven't raised money, and they have maybe like, small chunks, but that's it. So he called me, goes, hey, Imran. Like, you know, we got like a million, 2 million, like a million commitments from VCs, but at a very bad valuation. I don't know if I want to take this, but what happened was somebody came up to us and said some very large company came up to us and said, like, they're willing to buy us out at a decent okay valuation.
00:41:58.025 - 00:42:20.845, Speaker A: Like, it was not predatory, but it was like, you know, and then I. What I told him was like, look, like, you know, at this point, like, take the money, right? I mean, it wasn't a full buy. It was like, 50%. I'm like, you know, you still have some upside left and whatever. And then, like, the Bridge acquisition happened. He calls me that same day. He goes, yo, like, I'm not selling.
00:42:20.845 - 00:42:40.521, Speaker A: And so he went back to them and he said, like, look, like, you know, if you want this company, I want it for like, triple what I. What I. What you asked me for that. Oh, let's talk. We could be flexible. And so now they're like, our CEO to meet you. Yeah.
00:42:40.521 - 00:43:01.027, Speaker A: And that's what happened. They're flying their CEO out to meet with the. With the founder, just to talk through. Knew about this, and that's the landscape. So this is like, you know, all those stable Coin stars that are grinding it out over the years. They finally have the light in the end of the tunnel. Investors finally see there's some way that they could, like, monetize.
00:43:01.027 - 00:43:37.855, Speaker A: And it's opening up the floodgates. What I think now for more founders to come to space. Like, I put a tweet out because one of my really good friends, he's built one of the largest logistic companies here in, in the Midwest and wants to build a crypto startup based on this because he sees a lot of flaws in the space. So I put a tweet out, and my tweet Went viral. Everybody wants to kind of get into the stablecoin business now because there's so many opportunities to use this as a way to build startups. So I do think. I think you tweeted this, right? Like, if you're in AI's pivot to stablecoins or something.
00:43:37.855 - 00:43:38.929, Speaker A: Did you tweet that out?
00:43:39.047 - 00:43:50.405, Speaker B: No, that was different. That was about Goat. I tweeted that if you're an AI agent, because there's AI agents that became a millionaire. That was a banger.
00:43:50.525 - 00:44:07.573, Speaker A: That was a banger. That was a banger. So that was also a banger. But this other banger was like, look, everyone's fucking doing AI AI rappers for everything. And then OpenAI puts out a release and it kills, like, 100 startups. Why go through that instead? Just go build a stablecoin startup. So.
00:44:07.573 - 00:44:25.973, Speaker A: And the stablecoins are very easy to understand for, like, people in the West. Right? The west, meaning, like, San Francisco. Because it's not a Ponzi. Right. It fits with their, you know, ideologies. And they had a very successful exit. And it was a Silicon Valley exit.
00:44:25.973 - 00:44:30.885, Speaker A: And so it gives. I feel like it's finally the green light for Silicon Valley to enter.
00:44:31.045 - 00:44:56.225, Speaker B: Yes. I saw a bunch of web2vcs talking about that acquisition last couple of days. Oh, I also tweeted the other day about one of the best founders we've backed told me that if he was to start from scratch, if he was starting off in crypto, he would build around stable coins because that's what the world needs.
00:44:56.655 - 00:45:01.115, Speaker A: Thankfully, we invested in almost like two to three stablecoin startups.
00:45:01.655 - 00:45:04.151, Speaker B: Way more every batch. Yes.
00:45:04.303 - 00:45:06.751, Speaker A: So we've been doing this for two years now.
00:45:06.863 - 00:45:10.835, Speaker B: Yeah, it was great because no one wanted to touch them.
00:45:11.895 - 00:45:14.115, Speaker A: But the problem now is that the valuation is.
00:45:14.855 - 00:45:24.135, Speaker B: The valuation is going to go up. But I was trying to understand at a deeper level, what does stablecoin stack actually looks like?
00:45:24.255 - 00:45:24.759, Speaker A: All right.
00:45:24.847 - 00:45:50.919, Speaker B: Because there's multiple players in the stack. Right. So I asked one of the founders, what is the stablecoin stack? And here's what he said. So there's a bunch of things. There's five or six things. One is the liquidity provider. So that could be something like Coinbase and other centralized exchanges that provides the liquidity from either USD to USDC or some local fiat currency to usdc.
00:45:50.919 - 00:46:07.067, Speaker B: Usdt. So that's the liquidity provider part. The second one is the banking provider. Okay. So the banking provider is what the end user needs to wire the money. Like the user let's say the user wants to onboard from USD to stablecoin on ramp. It's on ramp.
00:46:07.067 - 00:46:30.125, Speaker B: Well on ramp is actually multiple things but one of the pieces that onramp needs is the banking provider because you need to wire money to a bank before the onramp can convert your USD to stablecoin. So the banking provider is one and there's very few crypto friendly banks left in the U.S. right, because of choke point 2.0. Yeah, the banking provider is the second.
00:46:30.165 - 00:46:31.181, Speaker A: I think that's going to change now.
00:46:31.213 - 00:47:03.087, Speaker B: With stablecoin startups that's probably going to change. Banking provider is the second area of the stack and then there's compliance. So compliance meaning KYC provider, KYB provider. Right. And then there's the license layer. So that's what you mentioned about Bridge, that Bridge has all these licenses and the reason why he thinks that licenses is actually a real layer of the stack is because precisely what you mentioned, which is that the licenses are very expensive and very time consuming to acquire. So that's another one.
00:47:03.087 - 00:47:36.495, Speaker B: And obviously there's the stablecoin issuers. So tether and circle and this layer is actually the most profitable layer at the moment. Right. Because tether made like what $5 billion last year off of interest rates. But we'll see if interest rates come down they'll make less money. But right now they're the most profitable layer of the stack. And final layer there is obviously the app layer, the actual layer that serves the end user, be it remittance, cross border payment, NEO bank lending, your yield account.
00:47:36.495 - 00:47:48.383, Speaker B: That is the app layer. Just some facts. No, just some facts that my understanding clarifies a lot for me in terms of understanding of the stablecoin stack.
00:47:48.519 - 00:48:09.745, Speaker A: So there's a lot of players in a stablecoin game right now. Right. And I think this is going to proliferate a lot, but a lot of players but like smaller players, but there's a few big players like Circle who has usdc, Tether, usdt, there's Euro via Circle, you could count decentralized stablecoins also.
00:48:09.785 - 00:48:11.361, Speaker B: Yeah, the decentralized ones, yeah.
00:48:11.473 - 00:48:23.325, Speaker A: So you have maker that has sky or USDs. Now AAVE would go, you have Frax, you have. I don't know, there's so many more.
00:48:24.585 - 00:48:28.121, Speaker B: That is the stablecoin issuer layer of the stack.
00:48:28.313 - 00:49:10.045, Speaker A: So you have all of these stable coins and the question then becomes where does each have their footing in the market? Yes, the to me the easiest to think about is like anything that's heavily regulated in the public space is going to be what real world people are going to be using. Like the day to day consumer. Maybe that could change. But you know, since they're more public facing, they're able to comply and then kind of get into the markets in certain regard. And so you have circle and USDT, which is tether. Any others that are, oh, PayPal, obviously PayPal is coming to the market. People have insinuated that Stripe might start their own stablecoin as well.
00:49:10.125 - 00:49:42.175, Speaker B: Also, why wouldn't Visa MasterCard do the same thing? Because obviously stablecoins is a pretty big threat. It's a massive threat to their business. On the consumer side, they charge 3%. Stablecoins are basically free. On the merchant side, the merchants are running a huge risk of chargebacks. They can actually lose money because of the chargebacks, whereas stablecoins are irreversible. Why wouldn't they feel threatened by stablecoins and therefore reinvent themselves like PayPal did? PayPal launched their own stablecoin.
00:49:42.175 - 00:49:44.675, Speaker B: Why wouldn't Visa Mastercard do the same thing?
00:49:45.175 - 00:50:14.035, Speaker A: They can and I think they will. Right. I think it's mostly like regulatory politics, but PayPal has always been kind of fintech. So I talked to a lot of insiders from PayPal and it took them a lot of politics internally to get PayPal, USC off the ground, even support, like even supporting crypto stuff. It was very hard for them to do like Venmo. We've been talking about getting Venmo and crypto access like two, three years ago and they finally did it with moonpay most recently.
00:50:14.155 - 00:50:16.203, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean that's, that's what happens with big companies.
00:50:16.299 - 00:50:52.547, Speaker A: Yeah. And there's also like, I hear that there's regime changes with PayPal every one to two years. And so like the people that I know that have been working there for ages, they're like, we can't really get anything crossed because of the regime changes that happen every few years. But the people that I know that stuck around are really fighting the battle internally. And paypal got pusd, pyusd and now this Moonpay Venmo integration, which is great because I've heard Venmo users are very degenerate. Um, because someone, Someone. One of the startups.
00:50:52.547 - 00:51:20.315, Speaker A: Yeah, so I heard like there was like some integration that happened with one of the startups that like blew up. Right. And then PayPal found, shut them down. So Venmo users are likely to gamble and the reason for that is because the money they get is like gamble money because you Know when I send you money like to split a bill, you just use it to pay other people. So like they don't care if they put in $50 into like a shitcoin. Right. So we saw a lot of users go to meme coins from that avenue, which I thought was interesting.
00:51:20.315 - 00:51:27.775, Speaker A: So yeah, PayPal generally I think is a very good sign. I think everyone is going to want to launch their own Stable Coins. It's so easy. Why not?
00:51:28.875 - 00:51:33.019, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly, why not? The only why not is their internal bureaucracy.
00:51:33.187 - 00:51:50.593, Speaker A: Eventually they're going to see a threat like with Tether Circle and they're going to start to clamp down. So we are going to see the fight of stablecoins from a macro perspective and then really all of these guys will want to own startups because startups are the ones that are to the end user. Right?
00:51:50.729 - 00:52:42.085, Speaker B: So, so I think that I asked what our founder, stablecoin founders, which part of the stack will actually capture value? Or said differently, which part of the stack is more defensible, is less likely to get squeezed out over time. And one of the founders put out a really good insight, is that you actually want to be excellent in multiple areas if you want a real moat. And that's exactly what Bridge did. So Bridge integrated with coinbase for their liquidity provider layer and then they got a bunch of licenses and then they partnered with some crypto friendly banks for the banking layer and then they have a really good API. So that's the consumer, that's the user facing layer. So they became very good in multiple areas of the stack. That's how you actually build a moat.
00:52:42.085 - 00:52:46.225, Speaker B: If you're just very good at one thing, it's very likely you're going to get squeezed out.
00:52:46.645 - 00:52:48.701, Speaker A: You can't put all your eggs in one basket, right?
00:52:48.733 - 00:53:25.671, Speaker B: As a founder, no, but that's not what he's talking about. It's not about that. It's about the fact that to build a really, really good, compelling product, you need to be good at multiple areas. Like for example, if you're not very good at the liquidity provision area, then you cannot provide the best fees ultimately it's about the fees and cost of user acquisition. Right? And the fees ultimately goes down to multiple layers down. So you can go to the liquidity provider, it can go to, let's say the on off ramp and a little bit of it will go to KYC provider, et cetera, et cetera. Right.
00:53:25.671 - 00:53:33.761, Speaker B: So if you don't have the best liquidity provider layer that makes sense, then you cannot Provide the best, the cheapest service to your end user.
00:53:33.833 - 00:53:40.945, Speaker A: It's kind of like hyperliquid, right? Like hyperliquid are like one of the de facto market makers. Fees are cheaper, they can provide new.
00:53:40.985 - 00:53:50.049, Speaker B: Markets and then it's like FTX or like ftx. FTX owns the. FTX owns the exchange, the matching engine.
00:53:50.137 - 00:53:50.641, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:53:50.753 - 00:54:09.047, Speaker B: The market maker, the app, which is illegal. That's why FTX was so good. Yeah, that's exactly why FTX is so good, is because Binance probably doesn't do that. Yeah, I don't think, but I'm sure Coinbase doesn't do it. Coinbase doesn't own their market makers. FTX did.
00:54:09.151 - 00:54:17.831, Speaker A: Yeah. So what you're saying is founders need to be good at multiple things and that's where they can have a more of a defensible positioning in the market.
00:54:17.943 - 00:54:19.215, Speaker B: In the medium to long term.
00:54:19.295 - 00:54:19.559, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:54:19.607 - 00:54:22.055, Speaker B: Short term is different. Short term you just have to build something that users want.
00:54:22.095 - 00:54:38.765, Speaker A: You need distribution. That makes a lot of sense. So yeah, so I think the stablecoin words are starting macro. I think there's going to be a lot of fintech companies coming in. They're all going to want to share, they're all going to launch their own stable coins. And this is going to proliferate to the founders. Right.
00:54:38.765 - 00:55:07.795, Speaker A: And then the founders really will have to decide strategically who they should align with. And everyone is kind of like figuring out and carving out the market. So like, we have founders in South America that are doubling down, we have founders in Africa that are doubling down. Europe, parts of the other parts of world like India, things like that. They're all like strategically positioned now. Right now the question is, can they double down and get the growth that they're looking for. So it's going to be very fun to see how this all plays out.
00:55:07.795 - 00:55:47.305, Speaker A: But bridge acquisition was great for the market, it was great for the VCs, it was great for founders, it was great for Silicon Valley. I think we're going to start to get some share back because I was worried about AI completely taking over the talent, founder talent. But with this, people can understand it, it's not speculative and will bring like the right curve founders into the market is the way I see it. So it's a win, win, win. And all in all scenarios. I want to touch on a couple other things and this is slightly pertaining to the, to the on and off ramps. For those that don't know, there are, you know, a couple on and off ramps that provide support for founders today there's MoonPay zero hash, transact.
00:55:47.305 - 00:56:13.099, Speaker A: There's other bundlers like, or aggregators like OnRamper, et cetera. And there's also Coinbase. Sorry, so Coinbase as well. And it's a very competitive. It's a very competitive landscape. And really what these guys, what onramps are essentially companies that have MTL MSP licenses in the US and other parts of the world. They can legally allow the movement of money between retail and people in different countries.
00:56:13.099 - 00:56:40.029, Speaker A: And they're legally able to do that. Right? So that's one. So taking credit card debit cards, checking accounts, stuff like that. But there's another really big critical component to all of this, which is fraud. Fraud and compliance is such a big factor into how you take in on and off ramps. Because there's a lot of fraud that happens like chargebacks. What chargebacks is essentially people using other people's credit cards and then they call the credit card company, say, that's not my charge, I've been hacked.
00:56:40.029 - 00:57:13.665, Speaker A: And so then they'll charge back that amount to the, to the risk to the companies, like the on and off ramps. So someone has to take a hit for that. And it's not the credit card company. So this has become rampant. And if you don't have your chargebacks in flow, like if you don't have your chargebacks down to like 1% or something, you're fucked, right? Like you could blow up. And we saw this with what was a company that went under in Silicon Valley, Wire Wire. Their chargebacks were so out of whack, they didn't have enough balance sheet and they just blew up.
00:57:13.665 - 00:57:41.879, Speaker A: And so it's very hard, very easy to blow up. And so there are three, I would say there's four winners in this market today. Transact, Zero Hash, Moonpay, Coinbase, Zero Hash, from what I know and Coinbase are the ones that have MTL MSP licenses everywhere. Moonpay I think is working on it. Transact is working on it. They're like the upstarts and it's very competitive. And to me, what people are really paying for when founders are using these services is for the fraud and compliance.
00:57:41.879 - 00:58:11.881, Speaker A: But this also makes a very big impact on the UI UX of consumer products. So like if I want to use Moonshot today, like the Apple pay integration is great, which is what Moonpay has done. Anything over, you know, sorry, you have to kyc. And the KYC is the biggest problem for people for Churn. And so this is kind of like the state of the market that we're in right now. And Coinbase just recently announced that with their most recent update, that anything under $500 a week, you don't have to do KYC.
00:58:12.033 - 00:58:13.881, Speaker B: So it's over for Moonpay.
00:58:13.993 - 00:58:18.841, Speaker A: I mean, I think it's over for anyone that's not like, this is a pretty big deal. Right?
00:58:18.953 - 00:58:19.905, Speaker B: They need to.
00:58:20.065 - 00:58:22.001, Speaker A: They just need to. It's a race to the bottom.
00:58:22.113 - 00:58:36.797, Speaker B: Yeah, they got to figure out the. Yeah. I mean, I had a very hard time onboarding to like, everyone says Moonshot is the best crypto onboarding app. I had a very hard time with Moonshot. But it wasn't Moonshot's problem. It was Moonpay's problem.
00:58:36.981 - 00:58:51.341, Speaker A: Your account got bricked. My account got bricked too. If you don't KYC or if you don't use. There's some sort of thing where your account bricks if you try too many times. And so you have to call support to get that fixed, which is like, yeah, below $500.
00:58:51.453 - 00:58:55.159, Speaker B: That's perfect for meme coin trading.
00:58:55.317 - 00:59:14.611, Speaker A: Exactly. So, okay, the competitive landscape on and off ramp. This is, I think, the biggest problem for consumer adoption for crypto. The biggest problem. And I put a tweet out and I went through like the list of. I went through the onboarding process for every on ramp and I put out my experience. It was shit.
00:59:14.611 - 00:59:36.647, Speaker A: It took 15, 30 minutes. I turned, I would have churned out of all of them. Moonpay contacted me and they're like, they talked to me and I gave my feedback and they iterate and they improved the product. So kudos to them for doing that. But there's still some hindrance. Right. And so I feel like Coinbase kind of took a step ahead and said like, fuck it, we're going to allow anyone to on ramp for less than 500.
00:59:36.647 - 00:59:38.655, Speaker A: No KYC, I think that's a game changer.
00:59:38.735 - 00:59:43.235, Speaker B: So they're able to do this because they have somehow a better compliance.
00:59:43.615 - 01:00:05.225, Speaker A: So my theory is that because they have 120 million KYC users, they essentially have a very robust inventory of customer base. So their fraud, like if you were to do fraud and compliance, like you can minimize that because you know who your customers are and so your chargebacks are going to be lower.
01:00:05.965 - 01:00:08.385, Speaker B: So they leverage existing customer data.
01:00:08.725 - 01:00:09.981, Speaker A: That's what I think.
01:00:10.093 - 01:00:10.925, Speaker B: That's a moat.
01:00:11.045 - 01:00:17.325, Speaker A: That's a moat. And so they can offer a better product because they have such a large customer base and they know their customers.
01:00:17.445 - 01:01:02.455, Speaker B: Yeah, you see, this goes back to my earlier point about which area of the stack actually captures value and is defensible? And that comment that our founder made was that you have to be excellent in multiple area. Like an on off ramp is actually an orchestration of multiple areas of the stack. In the case of Coinbase is the app, the API for developers, the kyc, the compliance, the banking partner. And they're somehow able to do the compliance part better than their competitors by being able to now do KYC for payments under $500. You have to be compliant, you have to find advantages, unfair advantages in multiple of these areas of the stack in order to offer a compelling product.
01:01:02.535 - 01:01:12.385, Speaker A: Yeah, so we'll see. I'm very bullish now with, I mean we've been very bullish internally about stable coins. I'm also very bullish now with consumer crypto apps. I think we're going to see.
01:01:12.425 - 01:01:42.395, Speaker B: Yeah, a lot of products are now more feasible than last year with FranTech. $500, that's enough to buy someone's keys, right? Like a long tail creator. You want to be in the same chat group with probably costs less than $500. One of the biggest problems with Frentech I thought was you can't on ramp with Fiat. You have to deposit crypto from another wallet that you already own to Frantic. That's a huge, a huge point of friction.
01:01:42.515 - 01:01:48.419, Speaker A: 100% agree. 100% agree. I also want to talk about Pump's recent announcement.
01:01:48.547 - 01:01:49.355, Speaker B: Which one?
01:01:49.515 - 01:01:51.227, Speaker A: They just launched their own terminal.
01:01:51.371 - 01:01:52.011, Speaker B: Pump.
01:01:52.163 - 01:02:17.045, Speaker A: Pump. Fun. They launched their own terminal and it's called Pump Pro or Advanced. And it is essentially a competitor to Photon and Bulax. Okay, so you need Privy. So you sign in with Privy and then you get all the tokens that's streaming to you, data charts. It gives you all of the advanced features for pro traders right now for the first month is zero percent trading fees.
01:02:17.045 - 01:02:39.255, Speaker A: And then after that they'll have some sort of like trading fee. And let me give you like the magnitude of this, right? I just had a tweet up. I can't find it now, but it's on Defi llama today or it was yesterday. Photon made $865,000 and Pump made $750,000. Photon made $850,000 in trading fees.
01:02:39.335 - 01:02:40.311, Speaker B: It's crazy.
01:02:40.463 - 01:03:10.723, Speaker A: So think about this. Photon and people use Photon primarily to snipe on Pump. So now Pump launched their competitor, Photon Jupiter launched their competitor called Ape Pro. Ape Pro, Yeah, April or something like that, which is essentially like advanced trading. Advanced trading, right. Yeah. And Azura is more of A, the way I see Azura is more of an Infinix competitor, like generalized crypto trading.
01:03:10.723 - 01:03:17.227, Speaker A: I see them as like you could trade any spot asset, any on chain asset, and it's all there.
01:03:17.371 - 01:03:20.117, Speaker B: So what is Photon in? How do you differentiate that?
01:03:20.211 - 01:03:28.145, Speaker A: The way I see it is it's like a sniping app, advanced sniping app that streams and you can buy new tokens that are launched on Pump.
01:03:28.265 - 01:03:31.849, Speaker B: Okay, so sniping new tokens, sniping new tokens. Okay.
01:03:31.937 - 01:03:33.865, Speaker A: Trading, sniping, both.
01:03:33.985 - 01:03:38.657, Speaker B: But I mean, so it makes sense for Pump to just own the whole stack and squeeze Photon out.
01:03:38.801 - 01:03:52.063, Speaker A: So Photon has been very, very profitable over the years. Over the year 800. I mean, like Pump and Photon are pretty much neck to neck in terms of revenue. Annualized revenue.
01:03:52.159 - 01:03:52.759, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:03:52.887 - 01:04:15.321, Speaker A: Pump's annualized revenue is 335 million. Yeah, annualized. Let me check Photon so that I'm 257 annualized. That's insane. Snipe install tokens, light and speed built for traders. Traders quick buy and sell. They have limit orders.
01:04:15.321 - 01:04:53.005, Speaker A: I mean it's, it's like people love it, right? People love the product. And like when I talk to like, I've done a lot of surveys with, with traders and to me they're like, I'll never leave Photon. Photon's a great product. Now with Pump launching its own product, would you want to use complete first party, like all the data that's collected from the Pump fund and all the, you know, there's some sort of synergistic value to use a first party app versus a third party app. So I think they have a competitive edge against Photon and the fees are insane. Like, Pump could go from earning 335 million a year to earning like 600 million a year.
01:04:53.125 - 01:05:05.465, Speaker B: I mean, effectively before pump was leaking MEV to photon, pump collects the trading fees, the transaction fees, and Photon collects the mev. And now Pump wants to collect both.
01:05:05.815 - 01:05:09.675, Speaker A: So I feel like that this is a very big shake up in this market.
01:05:10.815 - 01:05:16.155, Speaker B: Also, why wouldn't Pomp launch their own chain? Why wouldn't any big app launch their own chain?
01:05:16.655 - 01:05:28.151, Speaker A: You could always argue liquidity, distribution, but maybe in the future there's always a world where someone can launch their own chain. We just don't know how it's going to play out if they were to do that.
01:05:28.263 - 01:05:30.475, Speaker B: I think every big app will launch their own chain.
01:05:31.255 - 01:05:40.183, Speaker A: Everything's going to go app, like chain app, right? Yeah. The question then becomes like, what happens to the base layers of today? What do they Become.
01:05:40.319 - 01:05:42.191, Speaker B: I think they get squeezed out.
01:05:42.303 - 01:05:52.391, Speaker A: Do they just become a commodity? I'm sorry, commoditized. Do they become commoditized and the Layer one premium essentially shrinks?
01:05:52.503 - 01:05:55.675, Speaker B: I think the Layer one monitor premium will go down over time.
01:05:56.375 - 01:06:05.703, Speaker A: Yeah, it's very interesting to see how this all plays out. But yeah, I think. I don't think anyone's won. Ethereum hasn't won. Solana hasn't won. No one's won.
01:06:05.879 - 01:06:30.465, Speaker B: There's not a single layer one that aside from Bitcoin, that I would want to own for more than five years. I'm only playing for the cycle. And revisit. During the bear market, a lot of so many things are going to change. Like if the apps, the big apps especially, really are going to own the underlying chain, it's over for the generalized chains. They have no moat. I don't think they have any moat.
01:06:30.465 - 01:06:34.897, Speaker B: The moat is owning the end user. The end user is the traders and the developers.
01:06:35.041 - 01:06:56.231, Speaker A: You know, this is a funny. So Mike from Blockworks tweeted this out. I think I shared it with you. But it's fun to revisit this. 2018, 2021 Cosmos, 22 to 24 Cosmos Vacation of Ethereum, 2025, 2027, Cosmos Vacation of Solana, 2027 and Beyond Cosmos.
01:06:56.383 - 01:07:10.159, Speaker B: Yep. That's exactly in line with what we're talking about. The way for that to happen, for what Mike said is going to happen is when the apps launch their own chains, which Uniswap did three weeks ago.
01:07:10.247 - 01:07:11.759, Speaker A: Yep. What do you think?
01:07:11.927 - 01:07:16.007, Speaker B: Blast wants to go full stack, right? Blast is going full stack.
01:07:16.111 - 01:07:16.391, Speaker A: Yes.
01:07:16.423 - 01:07:31.361, Speaker B: They were actually the one that coined the term full stack chain ton. By definition, ton has telegram in front of on top of ton, the chain base. By definition, they have coinbase on top of the base chain. They're all going full stack.
01:07:31.553 - 01:07:35.961, Speaker A: Yeah. So we'll see what happens with the base chains. I do worry in the long run.
01:07:36.073 - 01:07:37.193, Speaker B: It'S going to be fun.
01:07:37.369 - 01:07:54.841, Speaker A: But Solana, they're taking an interesting approach. Right. I think they're baking in a lot of cool features. Like what's that token standard that they created where you can do like private public token 22, 22 token standard. Token extension standard. Token standard.
01:07:54.953 - 01:07:55.201, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:07:55.233 - 01:08:10.961, Speaker A: Yeah. So there's a lot of cool things. Right. Like, and I know PyUSD is built on the standard, so there is some. I think so. I think Solana is taking it the right way. It's less clear what's going to happen, but like getting someone like PayPal to move off of that chain to another chain.
01:08:10.961 - 01:08:13.247, Speaker A: Could be harder. Right? But they could.
01:08:13.441 - 01:08:14.571, Speaker B: I don't think it's that hard.
01:08:14.643 - 01:08:15.459, Speaker A: It's not that hard.
01:08:15.587 - 01:08:29.987, Speaker B: I think if you're a good app, a big app with a big brand and a big existing distribution, I wouldn't see why the likes ofTether and USDC and PayPal wouldn't want to work with you. It's just using a new database.
01:08:30.091 - 01:08:31.115, Speaker A: Yeah, that's true.
01:08:31.235 - 01:08:39.821, Speaker B: And the bridging is simple. I mean it's a lot easier than crypto native bridge. Like you just burn an entry in one database and create one in another.
01:08:39.963 - 01:08:41.445, Speaker A: Yeah, true.
01:08:42.425 - 01:08:46.217, Speaker B: Yeah. I don't really know what modes the layer ones have in the long term.
01:08:46.281 - 01:08:47.965, Speaker A: I don't know if anyone has a moat.
01:08:48.825 - 01:08:50.161, Speaker B: I think the apps have a mode.
01:08:50.233 - 01:08:51.325, Speaker A: The apps do.
01:08:52.345 - 01:09:04.965, Speaker B: But outside of that, Bitcoin has a mold. Bitcoin has the first mover advantage. I think for a monitored asset, the first mover advantage actually matters. And a really good lore of satoshi.
01:09:05.615 - 01:09:19.543, Speaker A: All right, we have a few minutes left. I have to hop off to a call, but I do want to call out some fun experiments that we're running. One is daos. Fun, which is the ability to spin up. Anyone can spin up. Anyone could become a hedge fund manager. Hedge fund manager.
01:09:19.639 - 01:09:22.715, Speaker B: Let's see what new dells they created today.
01:09:23.695 - 01:09:27.757, Speaker A: So anyone can raise money for 3 memes capital.
01:09:27.835 - 01:09:30.471, Speaker B: So they created 3 memes capital today.
01:09:30.583 - 01:10:01.221, Speaker A: Yeah, I saw that. And so you can go to the site and you could back a meme manager. And people raise money in a dao and they use it to buy and sell pump shitters. So this is kind of like synergistic to the pump ecosystem. Right. Like you have daos, you have pump that launches tokens, you have daos fund that essentially gives more power to individuals that can't compete in the trenches. They have a bunch of people that back them and they have kind of an audience.
01:10:01.221 - 01:10:10.181, Speaker A: They can go out and find opportunities on pump and then make money for there. So it kind of like brings it. It starts to take the trip.
01:10:10.213 - 01:10:11.973, Speaker B: Like an echo but on chain.
01:10:12.109 - 01:10:46.985, Speaker A: Exactly. And what it does is also like people like that don't have enough time to compete or they get out competed by really good mannered people that have been entrenched for a very long time. Why not just back them? Which is why I put a tweet out a month ago that says like would you back pump fund devs? And people were really pissed at me that, you know, they're giving me all the Sorts of shit. But like this is essentially what's happening. It's bringing smart money, smart money into the trenches. Quite the irony in that. But look like there one of the funds that's, it's called Left Curve Capital, they're profitable, they're roughly at about 110% and growing.
01:10:46.985 - 01:11:22.935, Speaker A: And so you could go in there and you could still buy their token. And the token represents the share of the aum of the dao. And when the dao expires, or if the person shuts it down, you could either get pro rata access to all the dao, the tokens that dao holds in kind. So if you buy a position of the dao and they close the dao, you get whatever tokens that's held, you get that distributed to you, to you as a user. So there's some really cool stuff happening here. And so it's a fun experiment, but I think this is the first time that I could say that daos are actually working.
01:11:23.055 - 01:11:30.599, Speaker B: I mean, effectively. People tried the same thing, but with NFTs during the NFT bull run. I don't recall how you pan out.
01:11:30.727 - 01:11:31.715, Speaker A: It didn't pan out.
01:11:32.295 - 01:11:33.595, Speaker B: Why didn't it work?
01:11:34.575 - 01:11:49.841, Speaker A: NFTs are liquid, it's just illiquid. It was really heavy to buy into, so it's non fungible. Right. So you have to buy. And so there wasn't a lot of tail end supply for meme coins. It's just about a narrative and growing. Right.
01:11:49.841 - 01:12:19.911, Speaker A: And you could buy into it at any point, any price point for NFTs, you have to buy the whole NFT, right? And only the ones that were very popular went up in price, like cryptopunks or board apes or others. But all the tail end stuff, there wasn't really any 100x opportunity. So yeah, this is a really, really fun experiment and we'll talk more about it on our next pod. But now I must join a call with the founder and talk to him about what's going on.
01:12:20.023 - 01:12:21.915, Speaker B: Our peace later.
