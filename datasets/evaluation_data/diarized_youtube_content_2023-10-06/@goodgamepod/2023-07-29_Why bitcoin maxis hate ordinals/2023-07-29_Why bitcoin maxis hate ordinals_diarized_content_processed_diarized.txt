00:00:00.120 - 00:00:12.126, Speaker A: So people that weren't really using bitcoin as a way to transact, but people were using as a way to store data. And so what that ended up doing was creating a lot of bloat. And the bitcoin community and the bitcoin core dev community hated that.
00:00:12.230 - 00:00:21.174, Speaker B: And it's exactly, exactly what's happening recently with ordinals. Like the bitcoin maxes hate ordinals because it's actually bloating the block space.
00:00:21.294 - 00:00:33.546, Speaker A: Yes, I actually went down some interesting bitcoin community talks. Felt a little dirty because they kept talking about shitcoin peddlers and, you know, and so it was. So you.
00:00:33.570 - 00:00:34.346, Speaker B: Have to take this with.
00:00:34.370 - 00:00:37.694, Speaker A: A very neutral state of mind when you're listening to these conversations.
00:00:38.034 - 00:00:52.674, Speaker B: Whenever bitcoin maxes hate something, whatever thing that they hate becomes interesting to me. That was the case originally with Ethereum. They all hated Ethereum back then, 2014, 2016, and now they're hitting on ordinals. That's what led to our deep dive into ordinals.
