00:00:00.170 - 00:00:38.450, Speaker A: My advice for founders is not to be so obsessed about the math. The algorithm building a product is so much more holistic than improving whatever AmM model or liquidation engine. It's far more holistic. For example, the front end like making things easier, lower friction for users, growth hacking like the central exchanges are so good at that by using stuff like referral programs, I think DeFi founders somehow lack a little bit of this more holistic things you can never pinpoint. One thing to say this was the thing that led to the success of this protocol project. It's always a number of things. So that would be my advice for founders is to look at things more holistically.
