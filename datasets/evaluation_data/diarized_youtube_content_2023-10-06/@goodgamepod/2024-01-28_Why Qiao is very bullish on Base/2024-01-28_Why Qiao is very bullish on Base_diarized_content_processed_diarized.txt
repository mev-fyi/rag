00:00:00.160 - 00:00:25.622, Speaker A: I am very bullish. Base I think baze is actually the most interesting layer. Two, from a non tech point of view. The reason for that is Coinbase has 140 million KYC users. Something along those lines. And Coinbase can decide to port the KYC information in one way or another through their base chain. And all of a sudden you have many real identity addresses on the base chain.
00:00:25.622 - 00:00:51.894, Speaker A: So essentially, Coinbase is this identity layer for the base chain. And I don't believe any other chain can easily do this. They would have to use something like clique, which is, by the way, one of the companies that allow the user support their off chain identity credentials to on chain. But base has this baked in, essentially. And so as a result, they can do very interesting things like RWAS, because RWAs require quite a bit of KYC, AML, that kind of stuff.
