00:00:00.280 - 00:00:34.318, Speaker A: When you ask me, like, why would you buy stuff on bitcoin? I'm like, well, I feel more comfortable buying bitcoin inscriptions because it's built on digital gold. It's like digital gold. Like, there's a luxury aspect to buying something on bitcoin, and then you named it a luxury chain, which is exactly right. It is why East Asians, and I believe South Asians will like about bitcoin, because in South Asia, India specifically, everything is gold. Everything we buy is gold. This is how we share value. This is everything we do.
00:00:34.318 - 00:00:54.334, Speaker A: So bitcoin will be the natural extension of this behavior. And if that's true, then inscriptions is a perfect gateway drug for Indians to buy stuff because this is a. It's gold, right. And that's the way they'll think about this. Agreed. So bitcoin will become the luxury chain is the idea here.
