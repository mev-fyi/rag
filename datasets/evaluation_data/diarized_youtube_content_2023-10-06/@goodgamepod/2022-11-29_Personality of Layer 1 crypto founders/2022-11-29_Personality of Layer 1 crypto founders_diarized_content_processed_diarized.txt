00:00:00.200 - 00:00:45.184, Speaker A: Basically, the personality of the founders of layer ones are almost like the DNA of the entire blockchain ecosystem. In the case of Ethereum, despite the fact that Vitalik has been trying to decentralize and, you know, give power back to the community, despite all his efforts in doing that, Vitalik's own personality is the DNA of Ethereum. It's very, very grassroots, very technical, whereas Polygon on the other side is almost like the marketing arm of Ethereum, due to the focus of the founders themselves. Right? So by learning about the founders, their personality, their focus, you can almost predict what the ecosystem might look like in a few years. That's why I think it's important to talk to the founders themselves of those layer one blockchains.
