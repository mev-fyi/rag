00:00:00.120 - 00:00:35.824, Speaker A: The impact is, as an industry, we can't build real products that people use, because real products that people use do not take only two years to build. They take fucking ten years. It doesn't matter how permissionless, how turing complete this blockchain thing is, it takes ten years to build a really good product. And I think that's why up until now, we haven't seen any real mainstream products in crypto yet. I think it's a big deal. It's a big problem. Neither the investor nor the founder are committed for building a product that can last decades because both parties can dump their tokens on retail within two years.
