00:00:00.200 - 00:00:32.026, Speaker A: The hardest part with building a new exchange is bootstrapping liquidity, and bootstrapping users. If there are no users, market makers are not going to care. There's not going to be any liquidity. If there's no liquidity, users are not going to show up. So that's like, the hard, cold start problem. And we felt like we had this pretty big vault product, which was basically like a very big whale just selling a bunch of options every single week. And we thought, yeah, can we use this, like, product that we have to bootstrap this new exchange? Because we know we have at least one very big user which sell sells.
00:00:32.026 - 00:00:50.722, Speaker A: So that was the core idea. I didn't know that. Yeah, our ribbon vaults is basically going to be like the whale of Abel, basically. Got it. Okay. Yeah. We can funnel all this flow onto our exchange and, like, incentivize the market makers to start showing prices, because they know there's going to be this big, dumb seller every week who's just going to sell options.
00:00:50.722 - 00:00:59.244, Speaker A: So I just felt like options landscape in defi back then was terrible. Plus, we thought we had an edge in building a new exchange, so that's why we did it.
