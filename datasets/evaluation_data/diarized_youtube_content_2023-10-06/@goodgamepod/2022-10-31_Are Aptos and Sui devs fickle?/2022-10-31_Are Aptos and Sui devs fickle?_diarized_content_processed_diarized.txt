00:00:00.170 - 00:00:13.866, Speaker A: The thing that is unclear to me is how missionary the developers on Aptos and Sui are, because a lot of them come from Solana, some of them come from Ethereum, and some of them are new. A lot of them. I think the majority of them come from Solana.
00:00:13.898 - 00:00:41.330, Speaker B: Do you think that's a good thing or bad thing? I mean, for me, as an example, I want to attract net new developers. Obviously we'll get some developers from all the other ecosystems, and that's fine. But to me, having organic pull from net new developers is a great signal. Just vampire attracting other layer one developers from one specific ecosystem may not be the best strategy, because what you're doing is you're attracting mercenary founders versus missionary founders.
