00:00:00.200 - 00:00:41.434, Speaker A: If you look at all the ecosystems today, like Avalanche and all the general purpose chains, right, whether monolithic or others, they just focus on everything, right? Like, you know, if you're building something, come build with us. It turns out, at least from the things that I've saw over the past couple years, is it's always better to focus on one sector and grow it. Because when you grow it, then you can invite every developer and build whatever you want. Having them focus on gaming or another sector, you could probably be very specialized over time, and it'll help you get faster to validation in terms of product market fit. And so I do think that having a focus like that is very important in the layer one, layer two, space.
