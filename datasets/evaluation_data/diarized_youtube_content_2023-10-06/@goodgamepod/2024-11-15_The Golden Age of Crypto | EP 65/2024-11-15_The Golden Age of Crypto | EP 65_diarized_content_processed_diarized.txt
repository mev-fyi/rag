00:00:00.440 - 00:00:22.645, Speaker A: Welcome to goodgame. Your no BS insights for crypto founders. 2018 or 2017. We met and I think the common conversation back then was like, when is the final boss? And we're like, oh, shit, it's gonna be like another 10, 15 years before we fight the final boss. And it's gonna be a very, very bad. Like, it's gonna be a very deep battle. Yeah, I think we defeated the final boss.
00:00:23.905 - 00:00:24.641, Speaker B: Keep going.
00:00:24.753 - 00:00:41.525, Speaker A: Okay. Obviously there's still, you know, there's people in Congress and Senate that will still push against crypto products or just crypto generally. So not saying we're all the way there, but I do think we've high level defeated the final boss. And the final boss being that president's all in on crypto. Right.
00:00:41.605 - 00:00:48.069, Speaker B: I want to believe what you said, that we've defeated the final boss, but I just don't want to get complacent.
00:00:48.197 - 00:00:49.485, Speaker A: It's absolutely true.
00:00:49.525 - 00:00:50.165, Speaker B: You know what I mean?
00:00:50.205 - 00:00:51.917, Speaker A: Like, yeah, 100%.
00:00:52.021 - 00:00:55.585, Speaker B: Was it that easy or. We haven't really seen the final boss yet.
00:00:56.165 - 00:01:18.941, Speaker A: I mean, I think what you're going through is like trauma. There is less than a month until Alliance's all 14 application deadline on November 20th. Head to Alliance XYZ today and submit your application. We just made it 2/3 shorter and easier. It's like I w. I wake up every day now. I just jump out of bed, don't even look at my phone, don't even look at the markets.
00:01:18.941 - 00:01:20.365, Speaker A: These are the moments I live for.
00:01:20.445 - 00:01:22.239, Speaker B: I was very euphoric last few days.
00:01:22.397 - 00:01:34.947, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I could tell from your tweets. It's like every hour it's about the market. So I have the opposite effect when I'm euphoric, I'm like, I have paralysis.
00:01:34.971 - 00:01:35.987, Speaker B: I don't know what to say.
00:01:36.131 - 00:01:52.955, Speaker A: I don't know what to say. So I haven't tweeted in like a few days. It might be bearish for my fan card holders, but I'm working through it. But I haven't had this type of euphoria in over two years. So it's like paralysis.
00:01:53.975 - 00:02:01.447, Speaker B: I was so mad this morning when I looked at Tesla because obviously I should have bought Tesla calls on the election night and I didn't.
00:02:01.591 - 00:02:03.595, Speaker A: Yeah, that's the best prediction market.
00:02:03.895 - 00:02:09.991, Speaker B: But then I looked at Doge. Doge is way up, way higher than Tesla because Doge and Tesla are the same trade.
00:02:10.143 - 00:02:21.143, Speaker A: Same trade, same trade. I missed both. But, you know, but that. But that's the bull market, right? Like, it doesn't matter like, everything's going to pump, right?
00:02:21.199 - 00:02:21.503, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:02:21.559 - 00:02:31.719, Speaker A: And then. And like, you just get chopped up if you just kind of move from one trade to the other. So I'm just going to hold my trades until the dip or close to the top and then figure out where to rotate to.
00:02:31.807 - 00:02:39.295, Speaker B: Yeah, it's going to suck because we're all going to get outperformed by the. By the people with 20, 20 IQ points lower.
00:02:39.415 - 00:02:53.755, Speaker A: Yes. Which was like peanut. And I thought about Peanut too. I'm like, peanut is such a good trade, especially given the fact that some people have said that peanut is the result of how Trump won. Just that narrative alone, or that it swayed.
00:02:54.175 - 00:02:56.275, Speaker B: Why do you think Binance listed peanut?
00:02:56.815 - 00:03:15.689, Speaker A: So here's what I've heard. Yeah. So I've heard this from one of the other larger exchanges. And so I was talking to him and I said, you know, Binance listing that nero, whatever at $15 million cap. I'm like, that's bullshit. He goes, actually, it's not. I'm like, tell me more.
00:03:15.689 - 00:03:31.497, Speaker A: Why am I wrong? He goes, binance is trying to shift its positioning or narrative, quote unquote, from infrastructure to these net new low valuation tokens such that people could get rich over time.
00:03:31.641 - 00:03:32.417, Speaker B: Yes.
00:03:32.601 - 00:03:49.495, Speaker A: And so if you list 15 million, I mean, the upside, I mean, Nero just hit a billion. So all the people that made money on Nero, even after it was listed on the exchange, people were still able to get this opportunity because it was roughly around 100mil val or 200mil val when it was listed on Binance.
00:03:50.115 - 00:04:05.439, Speaker B: This is the exact thesis we discussed half a year ago, that the fact that all these centralized exchanges are listing high FTV tokens and the fact that the moment that the tokens listed, all the users started losing money will ultimately hurt the exchanges themselves.
00:04:05.587 - 00:04:06.199, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:04:06.327 - 00:04:08.023, Speaker B: Like we discussed this half a year ago.
00:04:08.159 - 00:04:08.911, Speaker A: We did.
00:04:09.063 - 00:04:12.423, Speaker B: And that's precisely the reason why they're shifting the strategy.
00:04:12.519 - 00:04:31.931, Speaker A: Yep. Which is, in my opinion, I think it's the right strategy. I mean, I did give Binance some shit, but I take some of that back because I think that was over two to three years of just seeing high FTB tokens being listed. But I think this is the right move and I think everyone else is going to follow.
00:04:32.063 - 00:04:32.779, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:04:32.947 - 00:04:39.375, Speaker A: So what does that mean? Mean for me? Which is 95% memes.
00:04:40.395 - 00:04:43.003, Speaker B: Your bag's not mine. Your bags are 95% memes.
00:04:43.059 - 00:04:45.955, Speaker A: No, it's not 95. I'd say it's 50. 50.
00:04:46.115 - 00:04:55.563, Speaker B: Okay. I don't know what their criteria is for listing A meme coin. Peanut. Makes sense. What is act? I don't even like they list the ACT as well.
00:04:55.659 - 00:05:00.057, Speaker A: That's the AI I followed a part of it.
00:05:00.081 - 00:05:01.305, Speaker B: Yeah, that's the AI thing.
00:05:01.425 - 00:05:26.861, Speaker A: Yeah, I remember it was part of AI the AI prophecy. So I do think that AI right now we're in a moment where I think AI coins are building its own sub section of the quality of AI tokens that they're going to list. It's similar to culture coins or animal coins. I think AI coins are also going to have a very robust offering coins.
00:05:27.013 - 00:05:29.225, Speaker B: Oh, ACT is a pump coin.
00:05:29.525 - 00:05:54.365, Speaker A: They're all pump coins. I mean, like, if it isn't a pump coin, it's not a meme coin is my opinion. It's a joke. But the reason why I like that it's pump. It's because it's gone through the trenches, it's gone through all the PvP. And if it goes through PvP and it survives, then to me it has been battle tested. And if it's been battle tested, then I think it's one of those tokens I'll buy.
00:05:54.365 - 00:05:55.625, Speaker A: If it hasn't got.
00:05:56.365 - 00:05:59.469, Speaker B: I don't understand why they aren't listing goat.
00:05:59.557 - 00:06:03.877, Speaker A: Because goat is listed Goat, not token. I think perps.
00:06:04.021 - 00:06:23.035, Speaker B: Right. I meant the spot because gold had I looked at a bunch of AI agent, like I call it Agent Fi. A bunch of Agent Fi coins and gold had the largest volume. I would imagine that centralized exchanges would list the most liquid ones. Yeah, I've heard of HCT before.
00:06:23.695 - 00:06:41.279, Speaker A: I've seen it in the early days and then I ignored it. So there's like five or six that I've seen. Luna Virtual Goat Fart coin. So here's some. Here's some alpha that I'm gonna share with everyone. I don't know if this is going to be a thing or not. I could be completely wrong.
00:06:41.279 - 00:07:11.217, Speaker A: Don't take this as financial advice, but I do think stuff that's happening in Daoza Fund could be the next meta. And you know, it gives me similar vibes to when I saw Crypto punks at like 2 to 3 eth. Like nobody was buying it. You started to hear some buzz. People are like, oh, could NFTs be a thing? That's kind of where I feel dows fun is with AI16Z hitting 100mil cap, it went down to like 10:15 then.
00:07:11.401 - 00:07:14.415, Speaker B: You mean DOW tokens as a new meta, you.
00:07:14.915 - 00:07:26.947, Speaker A: Sorry, DAO tokens. Yeah, as a new meta. Specifically Daos fun as a platform. And then DAOS tokens generally AI16Z is becoming like a sort of an incubator.
00:07:27.091 - 00:07:29.811, Speaker B: For they have a very legit team behind them.
00:07:29.923 - 00:08:11.845, Speaker A: Yeah, so I spoke with Shaw. Yeah, I spoke with Shaw, who's behind the person that's behind AI6 and Z. We actually had a call or a Twitter space two weeks ago with Meow and Bao from Dao Zafen. A lot of learnings. I mean there are times where I was asking a lot of questions because I didn't understand where this meta was going. But to me, some things high level that I'll tell our audience is one, you know, automation for AI bots is not there yet. I think it's going to take some time, but they're thinking that it's going to be ready in like two to four months fully where bots can control their own private keys and they can transact on crypto rails autonomously.
00:08:11.845 - 00:08:33.885, Speaker A: And number two is the people behind the AI 16Z team is actually very researched both in AI and crypto. You see most of the skew that I've seen with founders is 70% crypto, 30% AI. You could call out the bullshit. Like if I, if I can ask questions, they can't answer it. Then like I know that they know shit about AI. Right. I mean that's my understanding.
00:08:33.885 - 00:08:47.029, Speaker A: And so these guys, they're very, very good. I'd say 70% AI, 30% crypto or 60, 40, roughly that angle. And I think that's the right angle to build a great AI crypto startup.
00:08:47.117 - 00:09:06.251, Speaker B: Do you want to talk about what will change now that we have a new president elect? I think that's the topic that's top of mind for everyone. I thought it was clear last week. I thought it was clear, but then I realized there were a bunch of founders that asked me that exact question. So I don't think people, yeah, what will change?
00:09:06.403 - 00:09:27.535, Speaker A: I think, okay, 10 years ago or like when do we, like 2018 or 2017 we met and I think the common conversation back then was like, when is the final boss? And we're like, oh shit, it's going to be like another 10, 15 years before we fight the final boss. And it's going to be a very, very bad, like it's going to be a very deep battle. I think we defeated the final boss.
00:09:29.215 - 00:09:30.047, Speaker B: Keep going.
00:09:30.191 - 00:09:58.875, Speaker A: Okay. I think that obviously there's still, you know, there's people in Congress and Senate that will still push against crypto products but or just crypto generally. So not saying we're all the way there. But I do think we've high level defeated the final boss. And the final boss being that president's all in on crypto. Right. And so what does that mean? Well, I, I skimmed through like the A6 and Z's regulatory paper of what could change.
00:09:58.875 - 00:10:56.345, Speaker A: And in terms of token launches, completely green now, like you can launch tokens in the US as an example. And so that changes a lot, right? From a perspective of how a founder structures their governance, how they structure their or how they're domiciled, the convoluted things that you have to do to launch a token, I think this really helps founders focus on what they need to focus on, which is building a product that people want. Even like you and I have worked with so many founders And I think 50% of mind share goes to that, whereas the 50% goes into product. But the problem with the product is that governance and product is so intertwined to a certain degree. It turns out whenever they release a product, it's ship production. And so I do think from a product perspective and a founder's perspective, I think that's changed. Making it easier to launch tokens means you could focus more on the product.
00:10:56.345 - 00:11:03.193, Speaker A: So that is what I could say with confidence. I mean, a lot of other stuff has changed, but I want to talk about this specific one for founders.
00:11:03.289 - 00:11:10.033, Speaker B: I want to believe what you said, that we've defeated the final boss, but I just don't want to get complacent.
00:11:10.169 - 00:11:11.441, Speaker A: It's absolutely true.
00:11:11.473 - 00:11:12.537, Speaker B: You know what I mean?
00:11:12.721 - 00:11:13.881, Speaker A: Yeah, 100%.
00:11:13.993 - 00:11:17.565, Speaker B: Was it that easy or. We haven't really seen the final boss yet.
00:11:18.105 - 00:11:49.651, Speaker A: I mean, you know, I think that, I think what you're going through is like trauma and like you want to safeguard yourself. Right? You always have to do that. But I mean, I mean you have the largest institution in the world, BlackRock, one of the largest. BlackRock, that is like swallowing bitcoin. And then you have Trump and that just did an ico, which you and I talked about. I'm like, what the fuck is this guy doing who only raised 10 million bucks, whatever. But it was a defi project.
00:11:49.651 - 00:11:58.003, Speaker A: And then you have Baron, that's behind Trump, that's controlling the go to market for Trump. So this piece is out.
00:11:58.099 - 00:12:04.827, Speaker B: Isn't it hilarious that the former president's defi project raised less money than Keynes infinix.
00:12:04.971 - 00:12:31.839, Speaker A: It's insane. 70 million. But I think people are going to start buying his token now. I think it's going to go, it's going to be up only I think that's the official meme coin for Trump. Yeah, I should have done the sale, but I didn't want to kyc. But yeah, so it is hilarious, I think. So what do you think, outside of you being apprehensive, what are your thoughts on the implications of Trump being president for founders?
00:12:31.987 - 00:13:11.719, Speaker B: Well, the most important thing and the immediate thing is the vibe shift. We now have an administration that is welcoming crypto founders, so that's probably the most important thing because over the last three years, we've seen this in our data, that the number of US based startups have gone down dramatically from 80% to something like 20%. We had hard beta on this. I actually tweeted this many times. I said that, you know, something to the effect of politics really matters. And the night of the election, I said, the fate of US crypto will be decided today. And a lot of people gave me shit for it.
00:13:11.719 - 00:13:47.381, Speaker B: But I really meant what I said because we actually see this in our data. We have hard data to show that crypto entrepreneurship has been alienated over the last few years. And a lot of that is really the hostility from the government of the United States. So that's changing. That's changing on the new government. I think more founders in the US who were previously afraid of political attacks and wouldn't build in crypto, they will now build in crypto. Especially the many of the San Francisco Bay Area founders.
00:13:47.381 - 00:13:54.307, Speaker B: San Francisco, like Bay Area has completely flipped AI from crypto over the last couple of years. So that's one thing. The other thing that.
00:13:54.331 - 00:13:55.251, Speaker A: Can I add to that?
00:13:55.363 - 00:13:56.035, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:13:56.195 - 00:14:27.585, Speaker A: So I was talking to our lead engineer, Carter, and he's in a lot of the AI groups in San Francisco because that's where he lives. He goes, even the crypto hacker houses are so dead that AI people have taken over those hacker houses. So he goes, crypto in San Francisco. There's nothing. I asked him if there was any. I mean, obviously you have like the highly technical projects like, you know, XYZ that are there, but outside of that, you know, the average person that's building is not there.
00:14:27.745 - 00:14:44.129, Speaker B: Here's another observation. The vast majority of the startups that we backed that abandoned their product that folded over the last two years, they're based in San Francisco. And in hindsight, it makes sense. They probably faced a ton of peer.
00:14:44.177 - 00:15:10.055, Speaker A: Pressure because everyone in SS example, okay, I'll give you a team that right before they pivoted, she called me and she's like, my friends are building things that can change the world. And I'm here building fucking speculative or like casino. She said, I'm building casino products and that makes me feel like shit. That was the word for word what she said. So to add to your point of why she pivoted.
00:15:10.675 - 00:15:52.295, Speaker B: But yeah, going back to how the new government will change things, US based founders will probably be more open to building crypto and international founders who are already building crypto will be more likely to come to the US because the US will become, I'm very confident that sometime in the next four years the US will reestablish itself. New York specifically will reestablish itself as the crypto capital of the world. So that's very important. And this will happen immediately. I mean it's going to be slow, but the effect will start seeing the effect immediately. And hopefully on day one, Trump will fire Gary Gensler. I think that's pretty much guaranteed.
00:15:52.295 - 00:16:25.093, Speaker B: And hopefully install a Treasury Secretary that's not hostile towards crypto. So that can happen on day one. And then after that, hopefully we're going to see a bunch of legislations around stablecoins, around securities laws, around token issuance and crowdfunding. All these things will enable new use cases, but those things will happen, will take a long time. Oh, and for sure there needs to be an investigation into choke 2.0 because there's still a ton of crypto startups that are currently unbanked due to that.
00:16:25.229 - 00:16:58.875, Speaker A: Agreed. Touching on Your choke point 2.0, we still don't have the right infrastructure for banking such that founders have an easy way to open accounts. It's still very hard for founders to open accounts in crypto and so we push them to like banking as a service apps like Mercury and others. And they're a bit more lenient on the types of products that they can build or the types of companies they can support. But when you do the application, you have to do it as a fintech app, you can't do it as a crypto app.
00:16:58.975 - 00:16:59.387, Speaker B: Yep.
00:16:59.451 - 00:17:51.343, Speaker A: I mean there's just so many, you know, what I call hurdles for crypto founders to build. In crypto you have the peer pressure, you have the regulatory overhang, you have the banking infra. And then, you know, because I think because of this three or four issues, most of the products skew degens and crypto natives and because of that then you have this virtual cycle where the marketing and what you see on Twitter is primarily gambling and casino, which then turns off the would be founders that are building in Silicon Valley to build other products outside of speculation. So it's like rightfully so. Like, that's kind of where we are in the market. And now I think with clarity in the regulatory framework, or at least in the paper that I read by asics, they, they think we're going to get regulatory clarity in the next, like year or so.
00:17:51.439 - 00:18:24.555, Speaker B: I'm really bullish next few years. I think, like, if you're. For our listeners, if you're not in our shoes, it's actually really hard to appreciate how big of a deal this is because we've been watching our startups getting crushed by the government over and over again and getting debanked, unbanked left and right over the last few years. Like, it's been really, really painful few years. So it's paramount that this new government, that we have this new government first of all. And I think I'm just really bullish, I'm euphoric.
00:18:24.675 - 00:18:50.709, Speaker A: We talk about luck, right? Optimizing for luck. And what that means for all of our founders is no matter how, you know, if you're directionally correct, just build in a space and eventually things will work out in your favor. And when it does, you double down, triple down on it. I think this is one of those moments for not just, you know, you and I, but for every startup founder that's building crypto and so appreciate this moment.
00:18:50.757 - 00:18:53.589, Speaker B: There's never been a better time to pivot to crypto.
00:18:53.717 - 00:19:09.741, Speaker A: Yes, golden age of crypto is what I call it. I think the next four to five years are going to be some of the most impactful years for us. And it's going to be one of those times where I think we're going to actually see new business models work that we've never tried before.
00:19:09.813 - 00:19:39.867, Speaker B: We already accepted a bunch of startups to our next batch that revolve around the idea of crowdfunding. Crowdfunding and tokenizing new things. Right. Like previously was just pump fund, pump fund tokenizes memes, but there are so many other things you can tokenize. So we're already making a big bet on first of all, the regulatory change on that front and then the resulting startups from those regulatory changes.
00:19:40.031 - 00:20:13.931, Speaker A: Yeah, I think pretty much you could crowdfund anything at this point. Right? I mean, anything that has substance. And so I'm very bullish on at least the new batch of founders that we've accepted and ultimately enabling new users to come into crypto that we've never touched before. And I hope this will also change a perception of how people think of us in crypto. It's funny, like Working with some of these founders because we hosted the 10 day hackathon. And so here's a perfect example. Like, the gaming industry hates crypto.
00:20:13.931 - 00:20:39.841, Speaker A: The creator, artist, community, they hate crypto. The sports teams, sports, they hate crypto. So it's actually very funny to see how there's this divide between the crypto people and then everyone else around us. I can't think of one group of people outside of crypto that actually loves crypto and embraces crypto.
00:20:39.873 - 00:20:49.953, Speaker B: Yeah. I'll give you a counterpoint. On the sports teams, I noticed last week I was watching a Premier League. I probably don't follow English soccer, I don't watch football.
00:20:50.049 - 00:20:50.281, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:20:50.313 - 00:21:01.777, Speaker B: I watched the games last week and I noticed that Man City is the number one team right now in probably all of Europe. And their jersey was OkX. It had an OkX branding on it, sponsored by OkX.
00:21:01.961 - 00:21:06.593, Speaker A: So I think branding, I feel like is different than using crypto products.
00:21:06.729 - 00:21:15.481, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. But what I'm saying is if you want to tokenize sports teams, then you need the sports teams to be open to crypto.
00:21:15.633 - 00:21:29.995, Speaker A: Sure. I think that's a good first step. For sure. Even if you think about Dao's Fun, that was also a very bleeding edge product. That wouldn't have happened, right?
00:21:30.115 - 00:21:30.855, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:21:31.475 - 00:21:44.251, Speaker A: But I think with the current regulatory regime change, you know, products like this, we're going to see other types of products like this for sure, which I'm very excited about. Coinbase. Holy shit. Did you see the stuff? You know what?
00:21:44.363 - 00:22:08.301, Speaker B: Yeah. Let me tell you this. At 160, that was like maybe two weeks before the election. I told my parents, hey, let me manage your retirement portfolio. And I dumped everything in their portfolio and I bought Coinbase at 160. Today it's trading over 300. And my parents never believed I made a fuck ton of money in crypto.
00:22:08.301 - 00:22:09.349, Speaker B: But now they do.
00:22:09.517 - 00:22:11.505, Speaker A: Very nice. Very nice.
00:22:13.045 - 00:22:16.285, Speaker B: Double their retirement portfolio in two weeks.
00:22:16.445 - 00:22:32.715, Speaker A: Remember when we chatted a year ago about where we like, where would you put your money in stock market? And we talked about how Coinbase would outperform bitcoin. Do you remember that talk we had? So around that time, I put my mom's entire retirement full portfolio into it.
00:22:35.415 - 00:22:38.279, Speaker B: Now your mom also believes you're rich from crypto.
00:22:38.327 - 00:22:55.085, Speaker A: So it's funny because my mom texted me. My mom is like, she's pretty funny. After Trump got elected, she went on Coinbase. She goes, son, why isn't the price moving up? I'm like, it was like at nighttime, right? I'm like, mom, you gotta wait till the market opens up.
00:22:55.175 - 00:22:56.725, Speaker B: The market is closed, Mom.
00:22:57.665 - 00:23:09.645, Speaker A: Not crypto, mom. I'm like, you think this is like an on and off switch, that you just print money because Trump is elected. Like, I don't get it. But she has to call me in a few days and I think she's euphoric.
00:23:13.905 - 00:23:22.437, Speaker B: My parents asked me if they should sell Coinbase and I said, fuck, no. Yeah, pull that shit till at least inauguration at the very least.
00:23:22.581 - 00:23:26.261, Speaker A: Well, if everyone is waiting for the inauguration, that has become consensus now.
00:23:26.413 - 00:23:27.413, Speaker B: Oh, fuck.
00:23:27.589 - 00:23:39.349, Speaker A: Everyone's saying till January 20th. So I'd have to say, you know, end of December or after post inauguration. Yeah, so it's one of those two.
00:23:39.477 - 00:23:43.549, Speaker B: I'll just wait for Druckenmiller to give me the macro indicators.
00:23:43.717 - 00:23:45.469, Speaker A: Yeah, just text them.
00:23:45.597 - 00:23:57.335, Speaker B: By the way, Drucken Miller did an interview a week ago. He's very bullish. Tech stocks, tech stunks, which is great. Very good, very good econ. Yeah, that's going to be very good for bitcoin.
00:23:57.455 - 00:23:58.155, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:23:59.255 - 00:24:20.755, Speaker B: Economy is great. There's no sign of recession. Trump will bring is bringing animal spirits back. So that's the next three to six months and then medium term again. He's worried about inflation, so we'll have to watch for that next year. And a good play for inflation is commodities. I bought a lot of copper.
00:24:20.755 - 00:24:31.719, Speaker B: I've been buying copper for a few months. Copper is good for. It's a bet on AI data centers that need more electricity. So that's that.
00:24:31.847 - 00:24:34.239, Speaker A: Got it. So copper is a good hedge.
00:24:34.367 - 00:24:38.941, Speaker B: Good hedge for inflation. And also there's a secular trend in AI.
00:24:39.063 - 00:24:44.449, Speaker A: Yeah. Is that the best way to play AI outside of owning AI stocks? Stocks?
00:24:44.577 - 00:24:49.881, Speaker B: I think so. How about you also mentioned uranium for building nuclear power plants.
00:24:49.993 - 00:24:53.881, Speaker A: Yeah. How about any energy stocks?
00:24:53.993 - 00:25:03.745, Speaker B: Yeah, I actually looked into this a few months ago. I couldn't find any. I couldn't find any strong conviction. Energy stocks, like utility companies or something.
00:25:03.905 - 00:25:04.551, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:25:04.673 - 00:25:14.563, Speaker B: Because the companies are largely government backed, like semi regulated. Tend to shy away from these stocks.
00:25:14.699 - 00:25:47.501, Speaker A: Okay. I wanted to talk to you about this. I haven't had a chance to talk to you about this, but throughout my whole life, fucking war every five to 10 years, right? There was war, war, war. There was this concept, a notion that I grew up believing that you're not going to make it. You know, whether it's because of jobs, in terms of how wages weren't growing, cost of living was going up, school paying for school. Like there was this, like you're in this, like, forever debt. And the second thing I want to talk about is, you know, this.
00:25:47.501 - 00:26:17.807, Speaker A: With the war and where America was headed, I was very bearish. There was times where I even called you. I'm like, man, I'm thinking about moving out of the U.S. like, I don't know where this shit's going. Yeah, I feel like we're plateauing as a civilization and, you know, maybe going into another country that's growing and that's much more organized and efficient could be the better play for my kids. But I think with what happened with how J.D. vance, like, if you just listen to his talks, I mean, I totally align with how he thinks about the future.
00:26:17.807 - 00:26:33.159, Speaker A: And for the most part. And I watch a lot of his videos on how he grew up. And he grew up with a single mom who was addicted to drugs, alcoholic. Right. Put himself to school. You know, like, you don't hear that from a president. Right.
00:26:33.159 - 00:27:01.165, Speaker A: So he grew up just like an average American, like, from an average American lifestyle. I feel like more or less a lot of people could be found and have some overlap to J.D. vance's youth. And now he's bringing a new perspective on how the world should be ranked. Which is America First. Right. And so no wars as an example, or talking about free speech and pro protech things that I wanted to hear.
00:27:01.165 - 00:27:23.041, Speaker A: And so I guess going back to the question I want to talk to you about is, do you feel like we're entering a phase where this is the new America and the America that's built for millennials and Gen Z's? Or is this all like, smoke and mirrors and it's really just going to be neocons or whatever running the world, and all they want is total world domination. And is it still that? I don't know.
00:27:23.153 - 00:27:49.995, Speaker B: You know, I've been very euphoric last few days, but part of it is I'm actually feeling very hopeful. Remember the day J.D. vance was announced as the VP candidate? We recorded an episode and I said I wasn't sold on TRUMP, but J.D. vance, I really. Because I've been following J.D. vance well before his presidency or candidacy, and I really like the guy. And J.D.
00:27:49.995 - 00:27:59.975, Speaker B: vance as VP really sealed the deal for me. I was under TDS, by the way, for a very long time. Remember? Like, remember.
00:28:00.315 - 00:28:03.123, Speaker A: No, no, you said tds. Sorry, Trump.
00:28:03.179 - 00:28:04.895, Speaker B: Trump Derangement Syndrome.
00:28:05.315 - 00:28:09.083, Speaker A: Okay, okay, okay. There's a TDS shit token that's that launched too.
00:28:09.099 - 00:28:32.615, Speaker B: But that's exactly that. That's Trump Derangement Syndrome. Yeah, I'm Pretty sure I was pretty, pretty brainwashed in 2016. And I've only changed my mind on Trump over the last few months, like, since I really started paying attention to him. But either way, like, Aside from Trump, J.D. vance, I really like him. I really like the team, the rest of the team around Trump, J.D.
00:28:32.615 - 00:28:45.331, Speaker B: vance, Vivek, Elon. So this morning, Vivek said something that really resonated with me. He tweeted that a band of small government revolutionaries will save our nation.
00:28:45.403 - 00:28:45.723, Speaker A: Yes.
00:28:45.779 - 00:28:58.651, Speaker B: It's the only way I saw that tweet. I was like, yes. And then a few minutes later, Elon retweeted, quote, retweeted, absolutely. It would be interesting to hear recommendations for roles in the new administration for consideration by the president.
00:28:58.803 - 00:29:01.347, Speaker A: I am so fucking bullish. When I heard that, when I read.
00:29:01.371 - 00:29:07.815, Speaker B: That they're on the same page, Elon and Vivek. Oh, by the way, I think Vivek is being considered as the secretary.
00:29:08.415 - 00:29:10.275, Speaker A: Secretary State. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:29:11.455 - 00:29:12.675, Speaker B: I'm very hopeful.
00:29:13.175 - 00:29:40.391, Speaker A: I really want to get out of this whole old neocon regime where they just have total domination of the world and world resources and politics. I just hate it. I just hate it. And then, you know, this from the outside looking in. But, you know, the government, the way it's ran, where people are perfectly, you know, it's very clear they prefer they have, you know, conflict of interest everywhere. Everywhere. There's conflicts of interest everywhere, but no one calls.
00:29:40.391 - 00:30:12.295, Speaker A: No one can call out because we're powerless. And so this is what Elon said also. He tweeted this a couple days ago, but he put a tweet and it showed, like, you know, like, the one example he gave was like, the president of the fda, how he both worked for corporations and then now is the regulator of those corporations. He goes, that's a massive conflict of interest. And what he said essentially is like, we need to get rid of this. It should be people from the ground up working and regulating these industries, not people that are switching from one side to the other. That's a conflict of interest.
00:30:12.295 - 00:30:26.435, Speaker A: Right. Like, okay, another example is like, I don't know, like, I've seen so many people from blackrock that ended up going into the. Into the administration. Yeah. Like Bush's administration, et cetera. I mean, that's a conflict of interest, if you ask me.
00:30:26.735 - 00:30:30.939, Speaker B: And a bunch of former SEC employees and working crypto.
00:30:31.067 - 00:30:34.455, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Like, what's our boy? Gary Gensler?
00:30:34.755 - 00:30:46.763, Speaker B: So didn't Trump. Or was it Trump or Elon? Elon said he will. Oh, no, it was Trump. He said he will ban former, you know, employees of the government to work in industries that they deal with.
00:30:46.899 - 00:31:15.609, Speaker A: Yep. I'm very. I mean, personally, I think it's a good thing. But going back to your original conversation, original note, I do think smaller governments are going to be very bullish and deregulation and smaller governments, more efficiency will come out of it. And then the final point I want to make is he's also said that he can. I don't know how he's going to do it, but Elon said that he could probably cut 2 trillion in deficit.
00:31:15.697 - 00:31:16.805, Speaker B: 2 trillion? Yeah.
00:31:17.665 - 00:31:43.341, Speaker A: And if this is the case. And so, like the way I. Okay, so now marrying this all together, I felt like between the Gen Xers and the Millennials, they kind of took power away from the boomers in a very forceful way. And when I say Gen Xer, I'm putting Theo in this because Theo groomed JD and essentially what they did was, you know, now it's our time and we're going to put J.D. vance, but J.D. vance is going to come as a Vice President. Trump is kind of the flag bearer to J.D.
00:31:43.341 - 00:31:50.193, Speaker A: vance. And I think if this works out the way it does, then I think JD Vance is going to be president or run for president. Next. Next.
00:31:50.249 - 00:31:51.945, Speaker B: Vance. Vivek 2028.
00:31:52.065 - 00:31:59.289, Speaker A: Vance. Vivek. I'm bullish. I'm bullish. Vivek, too. Like all the things that I've seen and read from Vivek. Bullish.
00:31:59.289 - 00:32:00.445, Speaker A: Bullish. Indians.
00:32:04.705 - 00:32:06.365, Speaker B: Indians took over the world.
00:32:07.265 - 00:32:09.073, Speaker A: Yeah, man, we got fucked for, like.
00:32:09.209 - 00:32:10.753, Speaker B: You guys took over the uk.
00:32:10.929 - 00:32:17.585, Speaker A: Well, that. Yeah. You know, chicken tikka is the national dish now in London.
00:32:17.625 - 00:32:18.839, Speaker B: Also the Prime Minister.
00:32:18.977 - 00:32:22.443, Speaker A: Yeah, the Prime Minister. And the Mayor. The Mayor of London.
00:32:22.499 - 00:32:23.483, Speaker B: Of London.
00:32:23.619 - 00:32:30.435, Speaker A: Yeah, the Mayor of London. I forgot his name. He gets a lot of shit. Sadiq Khan.
00:32:30.555 - 00:32:32.323, Speaker B: Also, Vivek's wife is Indian.
00:32:32.459 - 00:32:34.775, Speaker A: Yeah. And Vance's wife is Indian.
00:32:35.835 - 00:32:38.563, Speaker B: Oh, no, that's what I meant. Vance's wife is Indian.
00:32:38.699 - 00:32:39.415, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:32:39.835 - 00:32:41.531, Speaker B: Vivek's wife. I'm not sure.
00:32:41.603 - 00:33:02.665, Speaker A: Vivek's wife is Indian too. But we're just getting our revenge for being fucked by the British for so long. I mean, they. We had a total economic collapse because they just took all of our gold and all of our goods for so long now that, yeah, I noticed every.
00:33:02.705 - 00:33:08.885, Speaker B: Indian I've ever spoken with on the topic of the British, they hate the British, every single one of them.
00:33:09.745 - 00:33:26.147, Speaker A: But now it's. I think it's the fastest growing crypto hub too, so. I do think there's gonna be a lot of cool things coming out of there soon. Going back to. So anything else you wanna chat about? Politics? What's your favorite product that you've used so far in crypto?
00:33:26.251 - 00:33:27.455, Speaker B: What do I mean so far?
00:33:27.995 - 00:33:33.995, Speaker A: Anything that stood out to you or any new experiments? There's a couple apps I wanna talk about that.
00:33:34.035 - 00:33:34.883, Speaker B: Yeah, go ahead.
00:33:35.019 - 00:33:51.511, Speaker A: Yeah, I think one of the apps that I'm enjoying, there's a few apps that I'm enjoying, but one app that I log on every day is is Tribe Run. It's a spin on Friendster or Friends or Friend Tech God Soap, Uber Friend.
00:33:51.543 - 00:33:56.271, Speaker B: Tag is to Friendster, what Tribe is to Facebook.
00:33:56.463 - 00:34:26.769, Speaker A: That's the hope. And we did this experiment, it's still invite only. We have maybe 500 users that are using the platform at this point. But the cool thing, there's a couple of cool things that are going on here. One is obviously, instead of using keys as a way to purchase someone's attention, you're using tokens, right? And then you get access to the gated chat. But there's some fun spins on this, right? 1 is 12 top 12 holders gets to immediately chat with the creator. So it's not everyone, it's not open to everyone.
00:34:26.769 - 00:34:59.869, Speaker A: You can ask questions for a fee. So if you don't want to buy the tokens to chat, you can ask a pointed question for a fee. And one more. There was one more thing. Oh, and the other is, let's just say that you don't want to buy, you know, like in Frontec, if you want a long Kobe, you had to buy a key. And the key is, you know, it could be price of 4,000, 3,000. So the fungibility aspect of buying someone or longing someone is very hard to do on frontech.
00:34:59.869 - 00:35:22.701, Speaker A: And so in this case, you could buy a fraction of a token if you wanted to. So anyone can buy a token along this person as well. So there's that speculative access to it as well. So all in all, I think it's a new refreshed experiment that's on Solana that we're running. And I'm pretty hopeful that this product can get traction. I mean, there's already a cult following. So, like there's people that come in every single day, use a product, they love it.
00:35:22.701 - 00:35:30.787, Speaker A: Now the goal is to over time expand it. So I'm very bullish on where this experiment's going. You've used it too?
00:35:30.891 - 00:35:50.779, Speaker B: Yeah, but I churned one time they made an update and it was impossible for me to send a message. I just turned that once. What was the update? And also my price has been down only since that. Because since I churned. My price has been down only at one point. I flippant you.
00:35:50.867 - 00:36:01.665, Speaker A: No, you churned after I beat you. Because remember we were competing one on one for price and then I beat you and then you turned that same.
00:36:01.705 - 00:36:10.485, Speaker B: Day you beat me. And then they send the updates. So I couldn't. They updated the app and I couldn't send messages to my group.
00:36:10.905 - 00:36:11.257, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:36:11.281 - 00:36:12.017, Speaker B: So I've been downloading it.
00:36:12.041 - 00:36:12.553, Speaker A: Remember that?
00:36:12.649 - 00:36:13.441, Speaker B: Down bad.
00:36:13.593 - 00:36:14.865, Speaker A: Down bad. Down bad.
00:36:15.025 - 00:36:16.153, Speaker B: What's the other app?
00:36:16.289 - 00:36:47.981, Speaker A: I started using the new Define Mobile app and I've made the transition. Now I'm fully 100%. Whenever I want to look for new tokens, trending tokens, data on mobile, I use Define. Now. I was told that I was not talking shit about Dexscreener, but I was being very negative about Dexscreener, so I'm just not going to call them out anymore. That was the feedback I received from one of our audience members. And that is fair advice or fair feedback.
00:36:48.093 - 00:36:54.293, Speaker B: Hey, if you had a 100k today, dollars, do you think you can turn into 10 million?
00:36:54.429 - 00:36:54.813, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:36:54.869 - 00:36:57.005, Speaker B: Over the next year. And how would you do that?
00:36:57.125 - 00:37:20.129, Speaker A: First I would go into the trenches and I would look for. I mean, I'd say like every. Every few weeks there's a shitter that goes from zero to a hundred million. And so you got to be in the trenches. So like I've. I've been using Pump Pro as an example pretty actively. I didn't catch it, but you have to be on Pump Pro or Photon others.
00:37:20.129 - 00:37:47.981, Speaker A: But I'm using Pump Pro because I'm obviously a Pump fanatic. And So I bought 250 tokens. You get streams of tokens that launch and you just got to look at the picture, you just got to look at the meme and then you just got to make a gut choice on whether to buy it or not. So I just buy coins all the time. And so the idea here is I haven't caught anything good, but is to catch something from there. Right.
00:37:48.133 - 00:37:56.205, Speaker B: I think you to go from 100k to 10 million, you would have to be doing this full time to develop really good, really good intuition.
00:37:56.365 - 00:38:22.031, Speaker A: 100% you have to do this full time. So there's two ways. There's two ways. So I'm giving the trench version, then I'm going to give you the other version. You asked me how you do it. The trench version is you Catch something you get and it gets to a certain market cap, you sell it because you don't like you want to cash out completely. Then you go for, you know, more, you know, then you go for tokens that have sustainability, right.
00:38:22.031 - 00:38:43.695, Speaker A: The ones that are established. And then you find like, like I found goat around 80 mil and I had the anti coping mechanism so I bought it 100 and then go that to like 900 million. Right. So like you have to then go for those plays. And so that's like one way to think about it. So you go for ones that are established. Like Peanut was another great one that went from 100 to 400 million.
00:38:43.695 - 00:39:13.661, Speaker A: And so there's going to be a lot of these tokens that are going to be like 80, 90 million that can get to a bill easily. Okay. So one way is being in the trenches and finding and being and getting luck. The other is just going after like 2 to 10 mil caps. And there's a lot of these 2 to 10 mil caps, right. Some will be on the radar of Mitchell and so like he'll put it on this list and like it'll go up to like, then it's on everyone's radar. So 10 to 20 mil or sorry, 1 to 10 mil but it takes some time.
00:39:13.661 - 00:39:59.223, Speaker A: The other one that I'm looking at is like believe in something or bis that is supposed to be the beta for spx. I'm still looking into, I'm doing my research on it. But you gotta find this stuff that's still like there's a lot of noise now that there's so much noise. I actually say that meme coin investing is much easier now because you could find these things that they're harder to get because of all the noise that's out there. So I mean there's so many opportunities, right? You could be in the trenches, you could go to 2 to 10 mil or you can go after established memes like 80, 90, 100 mil. I try to avoid stuff over 20 miles. The 20 to 90 mil, 20 to 90 mil are the ones where you just get chopped up.
00:39:59.223 - 00:40:06.519, Speaker A: Unless they're like, you know, like goat was like one that I saw around 80, I didn't then I saw a hundred, then I bought it. How about you?
00:40:06.607 - 00:40:12.519, Speaker B: I don't know how to turn 100k to 10mil. Given what I know today, I would have to be doing this full time.
00:40:12.647 - 00:40:13.079, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:40:13.167 - 00:40:41.505, Speaker B: And probably develop really good intuition. Like you can probably. So like the stuff under 10 miles, let's say you yolo the whole 100k into that coin you own, maybe like single digit percentage of the supply. Hopefully it goes up 10x and then you turn 100k into 1 million. Right. But with a 1 million stack you can't participate in those sub 10 million caps anymore. You have to participate in like 100 mil.
00:40:42.525 - 00:40:55.581, Speaker A: Let's see what else. Oh, NFTs. You and I have a bag of Retardios. I'm very bullish. Retardio community for NFTs. It's a cult. I mean I'm looking at cults.
00:40:55.581 - 00:41:15.397, Speaker A: I'm not looking at any. If NFTs are cults, like cults, what are the strongest cults? Well, Pudgy penguins, Crypto punks, Tardios. I think Murad has an NFT list and he puts up there a couple others. I'll pull that up and we can go through it real quick. Quickly.
00:41:15.501 - 00:41:18.149, Speaker B: I feel like Maladies is the strongest one right now.
00:41:18.317 - 00:41:23.437, Speaker A: Yes. I also think, well, everything is a derivative of mes, right?
00:41:23.541 - 00:41:24.221, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:41:24.373 - 00:41:44.909, Speaker A: Like all the like Retardios. Bando I think was another one. There's Mameini was another one or something like that. I've been in all of these telegram chats and like everything's a derivative of Maladies. But the problem with Maladies is that it's on eth. So the spec. I.
00:41:44.909 - 00:41:52.709, Speaker A: I don't know if it's a problem or not, but you know, the speculative degen capital I feel like sits. I said 70, 30.
00:41:52.757 - 00:41:52.941, Speaker B: Right.
00:41:52.973 - 00:42:08.749, Speaker A: 70% on Salana, 30% on Ethereum. You know, you still have MOG on ethereum. You have SPX6900, that's on Ethereum, which has a bridge to Solana. And so for NFTs, I feel like it's harder to get that speculative capital. It's. It's a risk on risk. Right.
00:42:08.749 - 00:42:28.705, Speaker A: So. But Project Aon is on NFT is a NFT project based on SPX 6900, the Sproto Gremlins. That's an NFT project based on Harry Potter. Obama Sonic. Do you remember Harry Potter? That was like the first shitcoin we called back in early 2023.
00:42:28.865 - 00:42:29.605, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:42:30.985 - 00:42:47.757, Speaker A: And then obviously Retardio, which is on Solana. So. Yeah. And then obviously like the traditional ones as well, like Cryptopunks and. Sorry, not board apes. Crypto Punks and Pudgy Penguins are the.
00:42:47.781 - 00:42:50.461, Speaker B: Ones that I feel like Punks. Is Boomer funded?
00:42:50.573 - 00:42:52.197, Speaker A: It is, it is.
00:42:52.341 - 00:42:59.397, Speaker B: All right, Price prediction end of year. Here's mine, here's mine. Because I got my cyber truck the one btc.
00:42:59.461 - 00:43:07.393, Speaker A: Tell me about. Wait, you know how many people stopped me and they found it hilarious that you bought a cybertruck because you and I talked about it.
00:43:07.489 - 00:43:08.673, Speaker B: Yeah, and then I aped.
00:43:08.809 - 00:43:09.805, Speaker A: And then you aped.
00:43:10.985 - 00:43:17.905, Speaker B: One BTC equals one Cybertruck, 100k. Yeah, I bought it for. Mine is like 90 something close to 100.
00:43:18.025 - 00:43:32.305, Speaker A: Yeah, I bought mine. I bought. I got. I got scammed into buying the foundation and then a week later they dropped the price to 80k. Those fuckers. I mean, I did get self driving or the fully autonomous driving, and then I got up.
00:43:32.465 - 00:43:47.105, Speaker B: Yeah, I have one small regret. I have the not. I didn't buy the Cyberbeast because I didn't think I needed it. But even the normal one is really, really good. I loved it. Like the acceleration. Holy shit.
00:43:47.105 - 00:43:56.393, Speaker B: Fuck. From 0 to 60, I think it's what, 3 seconds, 3.5 or something? The Cyber Beast is like two something. It's the fastest car. Like it's faster than any sports car in the world.
00:43:56.409 - 00:43:57.753, Speaker A: Wait, you didn't get the Cyberbeast, right?
00:43:57.849 - 00:43:59.205, Speaker B: I didn't get the Cyberbeast.
00:44:00.785 - 00:44:02.321, Speaker A: Did you get the foundation?
00:44:02.513 - 00:44:10.685, Speaker B: There's a trade off between acceleration and range. So I call the longest range one. I felt that I needed the range, not acceleration.
00:44:12.625 - 00:44:23.473, Speaker A: So, funny enough, I have a Kalchi bet. I use Kalchi. So I put $500 on whether Bitcoin will be above 100,000 and I said yes, I bet it.
00:44:23.489 - 00:44:26.269, Speaker B: Yes, by end of year.
00:44:26.397 - 00:44:30.333, Speaker A: This one was by. This bet was designed to be by 2026.
00:44:30.469 - 00:44:33.773, Speaker B: I mean, it'll happen next month. Like it'll happen maybe next week.
00:44:33.909 - 00:44:49.157, Speaker A: Yeah, it's an easy bet. Easy bet. So I went all in. I mean, I. It was just 500 bucks, but yeah, I just aped into it. It was partly to test the product to see how it was, and also went long on Trump on Kalchi. So that was fun too.
00:44:49.157 - 00:45:05.923, Speaker A: But Yeah, I think 100k it sounds right. What about. I can't tell where Solana and Ethereum will be. Bitcoin seems more like, yeah, it'll break 100k by end of year. But wait, didn't Sailor Ape 2 billion into a bitcoin today?
00:45:05.979 - 00:45:07.027, Speaker B: He did. He did.
00:45:07.091 - 00:45:15.135, Speaker A: What the fuck is wrong with this guy? He's worse than the people in the trenches at this point.
00:45:17.205 - 00:45:31.981, Speaker B: So Sailor for eth. Sailor for eth. Who's building this? Who's building Sailor for eth? That's what ETH is. Eth is not missing all the technology. All this like you know, this and that. What is missing is a sailor for eth.
00:45:32.133 - 00:46:09.405, Speaker A: There's a big announcement coming out for eth by the way. There's a lot of rumors but I want to read this out to you, but it seems like Justin Drake made an announcement and he said announcement of an announcement. Tomorrow at 5pm on the Devcom main stage, I will unveil my most ambitious initiative to date. For one year I've been thinking about what a from scratch redesign of Ethereum consensus layer could look like. The goal is to suggest a credible strategy to ship what is an extremely ambitious and exciting beacon chain roadmap all on a reasonable timeframe. After months of research alongside researchers and consensus devs, I'm finally ready to publicly present my proposal. It's early days and your participation is key.
00:46:09.405 - 00:46:14.337, Speaker A: Should this new approach to tackling the consensus layer roadmap ever achieve rough consensus?
00:46:14.481 - 00:46:15.525, Speaker B: Is it tomorrow?
00:46:15.905 - 00:46:44.389, Speaker A: This was posted today. So here's a rumor now. So Doug from Ambient Finance, he says rumor is E3 point announcement this week will be a second merge into a new consensus targeted 1 second block time SSF and native ZKVM. Native ZKVM is particularly huge. The gas limit can be eliminated entirely. Builders can build arbitrarily large blocks. Since nodes only need to verify the snark, the only scaling limit left would be bandwidth.
00:46:44.389 - 00:46:53.373, Speaker A: From a certain perspective, this basically eliminates a need for roll ups entirely because the L1 would have arbitrary scalability. Is eth back? I mean it's substantiated.
00:46:53.509 - 00:47:01.689, Speaker B: Depends on how they're going to execute, how well they can execute. Like because this comes from Justin Drake, is there a consensus among him and.
00:47:01.837 - 00:47:08.473, Speaker A: Yeah, there's a lot of hurdles. Yeah. But I think all the Solana shit talking finally got to the researchers.
00:47:08.649 - 00:47:09.405, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:47:09.865 - 00:47:33.305, Speaker A: Which is great, right? I mean that's what we kind of wanted, right. I do think EVM has strong network effects. I mean 60%, 70% of our builders are still EVM based. I'm bullish on Ethereum was less bullish, but seeing this makes me more bullish. But we have to see if they can go through the hurdles. They got to make sure the philosophers can agree on this before they go out and build.
00:47:33.645 - 00:47:39.905, Speaker B: I mean empirically, they've never been able to execute fast enough just over the last 10 years.
00:47:40.205 - 00:47:41.797, Speaker A: Very slow with the rollouts.
00:47:41.941 - 00:47:46.061, Speaker B: Very slow. Hey, but also Solana went down this morning. Did you see that?
00:47:46.093 - 00:47:46.705, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:47:48.605 - 00:47:58.597, Speaker B: That'S the fundamental philosophical trade off between Ethan Solana. Solana just moves fast and break things yeah. And ETH is very conservative.
00:47:58.781 - 00:48:11.945, Speaker A: Move slow, research oriented. Let's get multiple community feedback loops in place and let's debate. Cool. Did you read Vitalik's article?
00:48:12.285 - 00:48:13.025, Speaker B: No.
00:48:14.565 - 00:48:18.517, Speaker A: So he called prediction markets info Finance.
00:48:18.661 - 00:48:20.589, Speaker B: Yeah. He's out of touch with the users.
00:48:20.637 - 00:48:32.165, Speaker A: He's so out of touch, dude. I mean, I mean, I respect Vitalik. I respect all his articles. Like, he's great, but he shouldn't be speculating on products.
00:48:32.825 - 00:48:35.897, Speaker B: I'll read his deep tech stuff, but.
00:48:36.041 - 00:48:48.049, Speaker A: I'll read all his deep tech stuff. He has all valid points, but when it comes to products, I feel like you got to leave it to the product builders. Cool. What's your prediction on Ethan Solana?
00:48:48.177 - 00:48:53.937, Speaker B: End of year? Solana? 420. E. Whatever the the price is today.
00:48:54.041 - 00:48:55.873, Speaker A: Okay. Doge.
00:48:56.009 - 00:49:04.433, Speaker B: Doge. Where's Doge now? 32 cents. Probably 69 cents for Doge.
00:49:04.609 - 00:49:13.923, Speaker A: 69 sounds like a nice, nice amount number. Yeah. All right. Six, nine. It. Solana. 420.
00:49:13.923 - 00:49:17.400, Speaker A: I think Ethereum will be at 33.
00:49:17.530 - 00:49:18.115, Speaker B: 14.
00:49:18.455 - 00:49:19.119, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:49:19.247 - 00:49:21.659, Speaker B: And then Bitcoin. 96.
00:49:21.811 - 00:49:43.415, Speaker A: 96. 420. All right, well, that's a wrap. We'll hit you back up next time. Thanks for watching.
