00:00:00.160 - 00:00:38.818, Speaker A: The point being, scarce assets like gold does track inflation, or does perform really well against inflation over a long period of time. Hopefully we see that with bitcoin. Obviously, bitcoin so far has acted more like a growth stock rather than a commodity rather than like an inflation hedge. But the theory if more and more people believe in that theory. By the way, bitcoin is an extremely reflexive asset. The more people believe in the theory, the more bitcoin will actually act that way. If more people believe in what Paul tutor Jones said about bitcoin potentially acting as a digital gold and inflation hedge, then it may actually behave that way in the coming decade.
00:00:38.818 - 00:00:47.354, Speaker A: Again, you can't expect bitcoin to track inflation month to month, but over the course of a decade it could, in theory, do really well.
