00:00:00.240 - 00:00:36.020, Speaker A: Nothing in tech goes from zero to almost, okay, there's AI. It's always a gradual process, and there's stepwise changes along the way. But we can trace the history of AI way back decades ago. AI is not really a new thing. It's not something that just emerged ten years ago. We can trace it back two decades ago and throughout the 20th century. But anyway, so this is sort of my understanding of what really led to AI, like this mathematical breakthrough, as well as the constant improvement in, in compute power and the huge amount of data that we managed to gather around the Internet, around the world over the last couple of decades.
00:00:36.020 - 00:00:43.924, Speaker A: By the way, that was thanks to web two, that we have so much data that can be used for training. So these three factors led to what AI is today.
