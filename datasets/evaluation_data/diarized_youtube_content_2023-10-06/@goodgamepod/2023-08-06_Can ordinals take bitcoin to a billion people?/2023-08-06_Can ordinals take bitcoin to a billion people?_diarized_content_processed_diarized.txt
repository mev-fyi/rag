00:00:00.160 - 00:00:16.526, Speaker B: You tweeted a few days ago that ordinals is a Trojan horse that can take bitcoin to a billion people. So the implication of that is there has to be some interesting use cases, right? What are some of the most interesting use cases or applications that are built on top of the ordinals protocol that you've seen so far? Yeah.
00:00:16.550 - 00:00:49.684, Speaker A: So I think that tweet like a big reason behind it is simply nfts. Like the last bull market to me it seems like a lot of the new users were actually onboarded because of nfts. In fact this might be actually the first cycle that I've seen so I've seen three. I think this might be the first cycle where maybe the onboarding wasn't happening through bitcoin as much as maybe even nfts where people were directly sort of like discovering stuff. I've seen some stats from hardware wallet sales number. I think a lot of the hardware wallets were actually being sold because people wanted to keep nfts there so I think that was one reason.
