00:00:00.090 - 00:00:30.770, Speaker A: So I think there are two different types of defi. So the first type of defi, the infra, they must exist, whereas the second one, they're not critical for the success of these layer one blockchains. And by the way, that is the reason why you've seen DYDX moving from an Ethereum layer two into its own app chain. But you don't see, like, Uniswap do that, because Uniswap is the core infrastructure of Ethereum. UIDX is not a core infrastructure of Ethereum. So this is how I think about defi.
