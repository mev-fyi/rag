00:00:00.400 - 00:00:31.349, Speaker A: Welcome to GoodGame. Your no BS insights for crypto founders. Have you noticed Brian Armstrong's announcement a couple weeks ago? I think he was at an event, it was a Coinbase summit. I think someone asked him, like, what's the future of Coinbase? And you know, the average person probably thinks, oh, you know, like an exchange. He threw out something. He threw out a curveball, which is he wants to be the WeChat for crypto. And I thought that was an interesting statement because, to be quite frank, everybody wants to be the WeChat for something.
00:00:31.517 - 00:00:44.053, Speaker B: Exactly. I was going to say Elon wants. Wants Twitter to be the WeChat of, you know, like social media or whatever, even something with threads. Like they were doing something that forget. Exactly. But they were doing something with payment.
00:00:44.149 - 00:00:47.861, Speaker A: They did a while ago. They were getting like MTL MSB licenses.
00:00:47.973 - 00:00:48.733, Speaker B: Yeah, that's right.
00:00:48.829 - 00:00:49.933, Speaker A: Money transfer licenses.
00:00:49.989 - 00:00:55.509, Speaker B: Yeah, that's right. They want, you know, Instagram or threads to be the WeChat of whatever. Yeah, everyone wants him to be the.
00:00:55.517 - 00:01:04.461, Speaker A: WeChat, but I don't think anyone can become the WeChat. Yeah, I don't know if I see that behavior happening anytime soon, at least not in the U.S. i think there.
00:01:04.493 - 00:01:11.981, Speaker B: Is some path dependency that apps in the west might not be able to replicate what WeChat did.
00:01:12.013 - 00:01:13.885, Speaker A: Do you think it's because we're too lizard brain?
00:01:14.005 - 00:01:14.597, Speaker B: No.
00:01:14.741 - 00:01:15.157, Speaker A: Okay.
00:01:15.221 - 00:01:17.157, Speaker B: Chinese people are just as lizard brain.
00:01:17.221 - 00:01:56.415, Speaker A: Looking for your next startup idea in crypto? Check out our request for startups list and get inspired at Alliance XYZ or forward slash ideas. Welcome to Good Game. Today we're in London. We had a team off site and decided we should record a impromptu podcast. And there's been a lot of new updates over the past couple weeks. And the one that I want to talk most about is, I think it was yesterday Google announced that their Apple or their app store, Play Store. Play store now enables NFTs.
00:01:56.415 - 00:02:32.719, Speaker A: And so you could sell NFTs, you can enable NFTs within your games and everything. But gambling, which I thought was a little bit interesting, but in fact when I was reading through the article, it talked about two partners that enabled them to do this. One was Reddit with their avatar launch and the second was a company called Mythical Games. It's like a crypto game. And so they were like the thought partners that enabled them to get over the line in regards to allowing NFTs to be enabled in games in the.
00:02:32.727 - 00:02:45.535, Speaker B: App Store in terms of influencing them. Because Reddit launched their NFT avatar a year ago. And so they saw the opportunity and they did something completely different from Apple.
00:02:45.615 - 00:02:46.015, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:02:46.095 - 00:03:00.559, Speaker B: Because Apple charges what, like 30% on every transaction, which makes it pretty much impossible for any sort of in app NFT trading transactions for crypto projects.
00:03:00.647 - 00:03:11.617, Speaker A: Yeah. Everyone's like, it's actually pretty crazy. I have founders that are doubting themselves. They're like, well, we're not going to build a consumer NFT app if Apple is going to charge us 30%.
00:03:11.711 - 00:03:12.173, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:03:12.269 - 00:03:13.517, Speaker A: We should just build something else.
00:03:13.581 - 00:03:14.265, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:03:14.605 - 00:03:27.725, Speaker A: And so with this move, it's actually a very big deal. So there's a couple of elements. Right. One is, you know, we're heavily weighted on infrastructure and less so on consumer. And I feel like NFT is very consumer.
00:03:27.805 - 00:03:28.509, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:03:28.677 - 00:03:39.333, Speaker A: And the gatekeepers are Apple and Google. And so by this announcement, I feel like this is going to open up the floodgates for a lot of new opportunities for founders in space.
00:03:39.389 - 00:03:39.797, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:03:39.901 - 00:03:54.523, Speaker B: I think we actually talked about this maybe a couple episodes ago on what is the biggest missing piece for the next cycle. And mobile is one of them. But if Apple does that to nft transactions like 30% transaction fees, there's no way.
00:03:54.579 - 00:03:55.411, Speaker A: There's no way.
00:03:55.563 - 00:04:09.595, Speaker B: And there's no way to do NFT based consumer applications. And NFTs are probably the most important category of consumer applications, at least for now. So I think this is a big deal for consumer applications.
00:04:09.755 - 00:04:22.579, Speaker A: It is. It was actually pretty interesting because I was scrolling to Twitter today, this morning right before we got here and Anatoly, founder of Solana, he said that they should get all the credit for. For this move.
00:04:22.707 - 00:04:23.331, Speaker C: Oh yeah.
00:04:23.443 - 00:04:24.387, Speaker B: Because Solana Phone.
00:04:24.451 - 00:04:25.091, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:04:25.243 - 00:04:27.643, Speaker B: Solar Phone pushed them to make this move.
00:04:27.699 - 00:04:34.043, Speaker A: And I think we talked about this in a couple episodes ago too, that you know, the worst outcome is probably the best outcome for crypto.
00:04:34.139 - 00:04:34.819, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:04:34.987 - 00:04:36.587, Speaker A: And I think that's what just happened.
00:04:36.651 - 00:04:37.131, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:04:37.243 - 00:04:44.695, Speaker A: So I don't know if anyone's going to be buying Solana phones anymore, but you know, I. More consumer apps are going to be built within the Solana ecosystem.
00:04:44.775 - 00:04:45.319, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:04:45.447 - 00:04:54.271, Speaker A: And so I think that's like one element. Right. Second element is like what do we think is going to be built within the consumer NFT ecosystems? Like what do you think this enables?
00:04:54.423 - 00:05:01.679, Speaker B: I mean, last time we talked about more speculative applications, so that's the most obvious one.
00:05:01.847 - 00:05:06.503, Speaker A: So like trading marketplaces, blur, whatever.
00:05:06.599 - 00:05:41.147, Speaker B: Yeah, you know, trading is the most obvious one. But even general purpose or consumer applications outside of trading, social applications. We talked about this last time and we said there needs to be some kind of or speculative Activities are one of those features that our lizard brains is one of the three things like speculation, dating and let's say entertainment. Like memes or like comedy. Right. Like speculation is one of the three things that our lizard brains do on the Internet.
00:05:41.291 - 00:05:42.575, Speaker A: What are lizard brains?
00:05:43.275 - 00:05:48.259, Speaker B: It's just, you know, the thing that we do without thinking. Okay, right.
00:05:48.307 - 00:05:50.179, Speaker A: So very simple, basic apps. Right.
00:05:50.227 - 00:06:15.521, Speaker B: Very primitive things that we do on a day to day basis. And so NFTs enable one of the three things which is speculation. Yes. And so even if you're building a consumer applications, like a social application, social media, social network or whatever, I think one of the things that makes a crypto based social application fundamentally interesting compared to, you know, the existing ones like Twitter threads. We can talk about threads later.
00:06:15.553 - 00:06:16.485, Speaker A: Yeah, it'll be fun.
00:06:16.865 - 00:06:29.561, Speaker B: Is the speculative nature. You know, like consumers didn't come to crypto last cycle for anything other than. Yeah, anything other than trading other than the, the possibility of making money.
00:06:29.713 - 00:06:37.245, Speaker A: I mean, what's. What better use case? Like, you know, we talk about product market fit. I think we already have product market fit.
00:06:37.905 - 00:06:38.841, Speaker B: We do.
00:06:39.033 - 00:06:40.265, Speaker A: And that's pure speculation.
00:06:40.345 - 00:06:40.913, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:06:41.049 - 00:06:47.993, Speaker A: And then I think that will enable real apps to get product market fit and then it kind of will trickle down from there.
00:06:48.049 - 00:06:48.641, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:06:48.793 - 00:07:06.541, Speaker B: I feel like a lot of people feel insecure about, they do about talking about speculation because it feels dirty, you know, but especially VCs. They always say, okay, it's time to move on from the speculative phase of crypto to this utility phase, blah, blah, blah.
00:07:06.613 - 00:07:09.653, Speaker A: How many people came up to you afterwards after when you mentioned.
00:07:09.749 - 00:07:19.747, Speaker B: A lot of them. A lot of them DM'd me after that episode saying. I appreciate saying that because no one else says that.
00:07:19.941 - 00:07:31.215, Speaker A: I think VCs and others are ashamed by it because if you compare it to like other industries like defense tech, like they're saving the world. Right. And if you think about healthcare, they're saving people.
00:07:31.295 - 00:07:31.847, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:07:31.991 - 00:07:39.035, Speaker A: Here I don't know, we're not saving people, but we're increasing hopefully people's bank accounts.
00:07:41.015 - 00:07:41.575, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:07:41.655 - 00:08:06.925, Speaker A: And I think that's a form of saving. Right. I mean, more money to do what you want to do, but you know, it's just a very different way of thinking about it. And so I want to talk about a couple other things within NFTs. Right. I know we touched on this, but like compressed NFTs, we talked a bit about it, but I really do think it's going to be the major onboarding for the masses into crypto.
00:08:07.005 - 00:08:08.541, Speaker B: So expand on it. Like what's yeah.
00:08:08.573 - 00:08:57.309, Speaker A: So compressed NFTs is essentially an NFT that has been truncated in terms of size and transaction. So much so that you could deploy, let's say a million NFTs for $1,000 on the Solana layer one. And so if you were to try doing that on Ethereum, it would cost you, let's say half a million dollars. I'm not sure, don't quote me on Ethereum's numbers, but somewhere in that magnitude. So you think about this, right? Like why do we have 10,000 collections? I mean there is some sort of like ceiling for how many collections you can have because the cost to minting those collections is expensive. Right. So if you were to do 20,000, 30,000, it'll just become more and more expensive.
00:08:57.309 - 00:08:58.709, Speaker A: And so it's harder for.
00:08:58.877 - 00:09:02.789, Speaker B: And I'm just speculating, you're saying collections of 10,000 NFTs, right?
00:09:02.877 - 00:09:09.901, Speaker A: Because if you look at like all the collections on, on ethereum, it's between 10 to 20,000 elections and it's never gone higher than that.
00:09:09.973 - 00:09:10.533, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:09:10.669 - 00:09:12.077, Speaker A: And why is that? Right.
00:09:12.101 - 00:09:12.749, Speaker B: Yeah, it's too expensive.
00:09:12.797 - 00:09:16.133, Speaker A: It's too expensive to mint. And so we've always stayed.
00:09:16.269 - 00:09:17.765, Speaker B: Actually Azuki happened recently, right?
00:09:17.805 - 00:09:19.517, Speaker A: Oh yeah, we'll talk about Azuki.
00:09:19.581 - 00:09:20.037, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:09:20.141 - 00:09:22.773, Speaker B: And it was really expensive. Like there was a, it was insane.
00:09:22.829 - 00:09:23.397, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:09:23.541 - 00:09:24.285, Speaker B: Race to the bottom.
00:09:24.325 - 00:09:25.165, Speaker A: It was a race to the bottom.
00:09:25.205 - 00:09:25.785, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:09:26.925 - 00:10:11.345, Speaker A: And so I always thought about like, why not, you know, have 100,000 collections or 200,000 collections. There's so many people that want it. And so what compressed NFTs enabled in this regard was being able to mint hundreds of millions of NFTs for a fraction of a dollar. And there's a company called Drip House that allows the creation and the minting of compressed NFTs. But also they drop like every day or every week they'll drop a new NFT into your wallet by famous artists. It's like a way for artists to get their name out there and it's a way for speculators to get some high quality assets for free or very, very low cost. So it's like a growth mechanism.
00:10:11.345 - 00:10:27.357, Speaker A: And so like the previous collection, 2, 300,000 was pretty insane, right? So, and it turns out 2 to 300,000 people minted these NFTs. And how much did they pay? Pennies. Nothing. Pennies on Solana.
00:10:27.421 - 00:10:28.051, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:10:28.213 - 00:10:42.223, Speaker A: But it also showed there was some interesting data points that showed that a lot of these people that were minting aren't even from the US or Europe, they're from India. Bangladesh, Southeast Asia. And if you think about it, those.
00:10:42.239 - 00:10:45.275, Speaker B: Are the lower income, lower income users.
00:10:46.095 - 00:11:14.435, Speaker A: And so Ethereum is focused on 10,000 to 20,000 collection. Minting is, I don't know, like for elements it was 2 ETH. Like, who's going to spend 4 grand on an NFT? Like people all over the world is priced out. Right. And now Drip House and Tensor and others are enabling people to onboard into crypto NFT specifically for pennies on the dollar. That's fine. Right.
00:11:14.435 - 00:11:18.571, Speaker A: That's going to bring more users into the ecosystem. So I think that's one.
00:11:18.683 - 00:11:25.401, Speaker B: I like the meme that the Tensor founders said about Solana. Solana is the blockchain for the poor.
00:11:25.523 - 00:11:44.053, Speaker A: Yes, yes. Yep. And you said two podcasts ago that Solana is focused on like, if Ethereum is for crypto natives, then Solana is for consumers. Yep, that's right. So. And I think the more these products come out, the more this is holding to be true.
00:11:44.109 - 00:11:44.745, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:11:45.205 - 00:11:46.985, Speaker A: Which I thought was very interesting.
00:11:47.405 - 00:11:50.905, Speaker B: Do you know on a technical level how they do the compression? Do they.
00:11:51.975 - 00:11:54.247, Speaker A: They have like a Validium.
00:11:54.391 - 00:11:54.975, Speaker C: Okay.
00:11:55.095 - 00:11:58.591, Speaker A: And that's where the NFT minting and.
00:11:58.623 - 00:12:08.615, Speaker B: Compression happens, like the actual JPEG list on the Validium. So for those who don't know, the general concept of Validium is like an off chain storage.
00:12:08.655 - 00:12:09.875, Speaker A: It's an off chain storage.
00:12:10.655 - 00:12:12.047, Speaker B: Anyway, I don't know exactly how it.
00:12:12.071 - 00:12:14.047, Speaker A: Works, but it's through Validium.
00:12:14.111 - 00:12:14.559, Speaker B: Okay.
00:12:14.647 - 00:12:30.305, Speaker A: And that's managed by the Solana ecosystem. And then it's semi centralized. Right. Okay. But it works. And people are being onboarded from all over the world because of this. And I think that's something that Ethereum should be thinking about.
00:12:30.385 - 00:12:31.045, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:12:31.425 - 00:12:59.523, Speaker B: But you see as a meta point, the two things we talked about so far, the Google Play Store and the compressed NFTs, these are enabling things that happen constantly throughout the bear market. And we talked about this many times in the past. As a founder, if you don't survive long enough, you're not going to see these enabling things happen and you're going to miss the opportunities to create things off of these enabling technologies.
00:12:59.579 - 00:13:17.835, Speaker A: Yep. This even reminds me of the last bear market, where open finance or DeFi, very similar in nature. Even RWAs. We'll be talking about RWAS soon. But these things happen in the bear market. And so no one really cared about open finance or Defi at that time. They're like, yeah, whatever.
00:13:17.835 - 00:13:47.437, Speaker A: Right. But that was what led us to the last bull market or one of the things that enabled us to the last Bull market. And I feel like we're very similar in like NFTs, compressed NFTs, RWAs and other topic points that we're going to be talking about later today. So that was. CNFTs was one interesting element. The other was sound XYZ. They just raised around like a couple days ago for 20 million.
00:13:47.437 - 00:14:18.685, Speaker A: It was on my radar. And browse through their website, I know they have like 10,000 holders that are buying these music NFTs. And we talk a lot about non consensus bets. Right. That's what we look for in startups that apply to our program. I'm starting to get an inkling that you know, on chain media is going to be a thing like in a thing meaning like consumer application. What are your thoughts on that? Like music NFTs on chain media.
00:14:18.725 - 00:14:28.877, Speaker B: Are you sure that's non consensus? I feel like it's pretty consensus. I felt like my view was very non consensus because my view was that like have you, have you tried, have you bought a music nft?
00:14:28.941 - 00:14:29.957, Speaker A: I haven't, I've listened.
00:14:30.021 - 00:14:30.525, Speaker B: Okay.
00:14:30.645 - 00:14:31.221, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah.
00:14:31.253 - 00:14:44.451, Speaker B: So I mean I haven't either because I don't feel the urge to own music NFT myself. I just, I just don't get it. I mean owning a JPEG makes sense to me because I can trade. Yeah, I could, I can trade. I mean music and that music and trade.
00:14:44.483 - 00:14:45.019, Speaker A: You could speculate.
00:14:45.067 - 00:14:51.323, Speaker B: I mean for me, the JPEG NFTs, I can use them as avatars on Twitter.
00:14:51.419 - 00:14:55.371, Speaker A: But what about like, okay, let's, let's take a fun hypothetical.
00:14:55.443 - 00:14:55.979, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:14:56.107 - 00:14:57.683, Speaker A: Up and coming indie artist.
00:14:57.819 - 00:14:58.659, Speaker C: Yeah, right.
00:14:58.787 - 00:15:03.563, Speaker A: Turns out like they, right before they signed a record deal, people bought his or her nft.
00:15:03.659 - 00:15:04.027, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:15:04.091 - 00:15:07.095, Speaker A: Then they signed a deal. What do you think is going to happen to the price of that nft?
00:15:07.875 - 00:15:08.667, Speaker B: It'll go up.
00:15:08.731 - 00:15:12.339, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. So I think it's an indirect way to go long or short.
00:15:12.467 - 00:15:17.195, Speaker B: No, exactly. That's my point. Like the point of music is speculation.
00:15:17.315 - 00:15:18.163, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:15:18.299 - 00:15:26.621, Speaker B: It's, it's the same thing as, remember what's that thing? There was a personal token from back in the day.
00:15:26.693 - 00:15:33.065, Speaker A: Oh, oh, are you talking about Diesel? Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, that's right.
00:15:34.205 - 00:15:41.397, Speaker B: I think fundamentally it's the same idea. You're betting on the artist. So in a sense music NFTs are a personal token.
00:15:41.541 - 00:15:41.949, Speaker A: It is.
00:15:41.997 - 00:15:53.745, Speaker B: So I kind of get that. But aside from that, the very fact of storing music as an nft, it doesn't.
00:15:53.905 - 00:16:27.205, Speaker A: Okay. So there's a concept in the music world called super fans and these fans will do Anything. So an example of this is my brother in law, he holds like what do you call seats at the Soldier field. So he gets airdropped a lot of like tickets and he can do whatever he wants with it. And so he ended up getting like Taylor Swift tickets. He sold it for like 10 grand each and people bought it. We're talking as soon as he listed it, within hours it sold out.
00:16:27.205 - 00:16:41.329, Speaker A: And there's a concept of super fans where they'll do anything to be able to watch a Taylor Swift or others. And so from that perspective, I feel like people will buy these NFTs just so they can get closer to the artist.
00:16:41.417 - 00:16:42.161, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:16:42.353 - 00:16:47.961, Speaker B: So you can think of music NFTs as also access tokens to the artist.
00:16:48.033 - 00:16:48.641, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:16:48.793 - 00:17:04.129, Speaker B: So it's two things. It's personal token. Well it's three things actually. It's personal token, it's a access token and it's a speculative, speculative coin. Okay. So I get those value props.
00:17:04.297 - 00:17:47.025, Speaker A: The reason why I bring up why it's consensus, non consensus because there are a group of people that are pushing this, but there are a lot of people that are also like what's the point? Right. So I feel like maybe we're in the middle. Maybe we're not like all the way like pro bullish and at Music NFTs nor the other way. And we're seeing some interesting applications that are coming through Reliance that are enabling this on chain media category to hopefully blossom. Right. Like imagine if now you have now that Google approved its Play Store. You could download this app that allows you to access any on chain media like the music, the videos.
00:17:47.025 - 00:18:07.779, Speaker A: Because we have like glass statics yz that does video NFTs. So maybe this is a new form of consumption of media. I'm not sure but it's an interesting signal that I'm seeing. I don't know where it's going to go. It's too hard. It's too early to say. But we're seeing some applications of startup founders that are building in this space.
00:18:07.779 - 00:18:17.399, Speaker A: So it was interesting call out just because we're talking about NFTs right now. We talked about some interesting use cases and you mentioned Azuki.
00:18:17.487 - 00:18:18.155, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:18:20.615 - 00:18:46.131, Speaker A: So maybe we could talk to our audience a bit about what happened there and what's happening broadly within the NFT ecosystem. So Azuki launched something called Elementals and it's like the secondary collection to the main collection. So the main collection is like 10,000 pictures, profile pictures and then they launched a subsidiary which is like 20,000 and.
00:18:46.163 - 00:18:51.787, Speaker B: Usually so is analogous to what mutant apes is. To the original.
00:18:51.851 - 00:18:58.295, Speaker A: Yes, apes or little pudgies with pudgies. Although mutants were ugly.
00:18:59.755 - 00:19:09.413, Speaker B: Actually, we talked about this. So I like Hazuki as artists, as JPEGs, apes and punks. I don't like them. I like penguins. I like Azuki.
00:19:09.469 - 00:19:14.077, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Punks. I like. I like the rest you mentioned.
00:19:14.141 - 00:19:14.645, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:19:14.765 - 00:19:20.437, Speaker A: And it's funny though, like, on a side note that there aren't actually that many, like, aesthetically good collections.
00:19:20.501 - 00:19:20.981, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:19:21.093 - 00:19:26.865, Speaker A: You just have to have a. Just gotta like them. And I don't know, when the price goes up, I like them even more.
00:19:27.845 - 00:19:30.893, Speaker B: When the price goes up, it's ten times more pretty.
00:19:30.949 - 00:19:51.067, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So Azuki dropped their Elementals. I mean, we're bean holders and Azuki holders. So I tried to mint. I couldn't get anything, thankfully. I would have been down bad. And so then people started minting.
00:19:51.067 - 00:19:56.067, Speaker A: And it turns out the Azuki Elementals look identical to the main collection.
00:19:56.131 - 00:19:56.775, Speaker B: Okay.
00:19:57.115 - 00:20:25.097, Speaker A: And so Azuki OG started selling their NFTs. They're like, well, yeah, you're diluting our collection. You should make something that's different. And so the price went from like, I don't know, 15e to the main Ozuki OG collectors, or the collection went from like 15e to 5e. Like, it dropped like 70% rock. Yeah. And Azuki elementals went from, you know, 1.8
00:20:25.097 - 00:20:40.073, Speaker A: eth to 0.7. So people were pissed so much. So that first one, azuki collected like 40 million, was it? 40 million? Yeah, 40 million out of his mint.
00:20:40.209 - 00:20:41.145, Speaker B: Ridiculous.
00:20:41.305 - 00:21:01.847, Speaker A: Too much money. Right. So that's something that we'll talk a bit about, like why you need to. But the way they did it too, you know, 2 ethanol. 10 minutes for azuki holders to mint, 10 minutes for bean holders to mint, and then 10 minutes for the community. By the time it got to beans, like within the first two minutes, it was. It was done.
00:21:01.847 - 00:21:05.687, Speaker A: Sold out. That's where I lost. Right. Which was fine.
00:21:05.751 - 00:21:06.191, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:21:06.303 - 00:21:09.423, Speaker A: And once people started minting, they're like, this is fucking. It's the same thing.
00:21:09.479 - 00:21:10.231, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:21:10.423 - 00:21:30.765, Speaker A: So then the collections dropped. People were questioning Azuki. Then they started questioning the entire NFT ecosystem right there. What's all like all of a sudden people realize board apes were just ugly ass monkeys. And so that dropped. And then every collection after that dropped 50%. 50%.
00:21:30.765 - 00:21:42.871, Speaker A: And I felt like the NFT community just came to realization that they were just holding JPEGs and they were all at the same time. Obviously, it rebounded after that.
00:21:43.033 - 00:21:44.547, Speaker B: I Thought that was the capitulation.
00:21:44.691 - 00:21:55.651, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. So we secured a bag. So that was good in the capitulation. Yeah. Thankfully I didn't mint, so. So that's kind of what happened. Right.
00:21:55.651 - 00:22:13.409, Speaker A: But something else happened in this capitulation was the Blur Blend liquidations. So while this capitulation was happening, like as the prices were going down, the reason why some of these NFT collections mega dumped was because of Blend.
00:22:13.587 - 00:22:16.525, Speaker B: Okay, are you sure that that is the case or is it. What?
00:22:16.565 - 00:22:22.145, Speaker A: Oh, I saw. Yeah. People were talking about this on Twitter and I was on. I was watching the queue because I wanted to buy.
00:22:23.045 - 00:22:24.781, Speaker B: No, I know people are talking about this.
00:22:24.813 - 00:22:25.045, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:22:25.085 - 00:22:30.581, Speaker B: But are you sure it's really Blend that caused this? Or is it that people blamed Blend for it?
00:22:30.733 - 00:22:39.939, Speaker A: So the catalyst was Azuki and Azuki Elementals and then I think the Macro NFT markets finally realizing that this all was a shitshow.
00:22:39.987 - 00:22:42.379, Speaker B: Like, right, it was all pasta, it.
00:22:42.387 - 00:22:59.995, Speaker A: Was all coffee pastas or whatever. And so everyone started dumping. Right. That caused the liquidations to happen because people were longing, you know, Azuki's. And so like, you know, These are like 24 hour loans. They could go on longer if you want. And so people started to call back their loans.
00:22:59.995 - 00:23:01.459, Speaker A: Right, okay.
00:23:01.507 - 00:23:16.697, Speaker B: So they were borrowing money using their azuki or other NFTs as collateral, unblended. And then the NFT started dropping. So they get liquidated and the NFT has dropped even more as a result.
00:23:16.801 - 00:23:17.145, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:23:17.185 - 00:23:18.001, Speaker B: So I can see that.
00:23:18.033 - 00:23:35.297, Speaker A: Yeah. But the auction list from Blend, I think there was like 300 to 400 liquidations that happened on the Zuki. It was insane. So it kept dropping, the price kept dropping. And that's when I knew like between the liquidations and the macro.
00:23:35.361 - 00:23:37.209, Speaker B: Yeah, that was the capitulation.
00:23:37.297 - 00:23:38.743, Speaker A: Capitulation, the bottom.
00:23:38.799 - 00:23:39.447, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:23:39.631 - 00:23:54.279, Speaker A: But that also shows you that, you know, financialization is happening within NFTs too. Like this is very true with like Bitmex. When Bitmex first launched. You remember that? Yeah, like those really volatile moments where like, you know, one day you're at. I don't know.
00:23:54.447 - 00:23:56.607, Speaker B: Yo, the back of the data was so stressful, man.
00:23:56.631 - 00:23:57.799, Speaker A: Like so stressful.
00:23:57.887 - 00:24:02.647, Speaker B: 10% candles, daily candles. Like it was really often, really common.
00:24:02.711 - 00:24:03.447, Speaker A: It was very common.
00:24:03.471 - 00:24:04.145, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:24:04.335 - 00:24:07.477, Speaker B: Nowadays bitcoin is just a stable coin pegged at $30,000.
00:24:07.541 - 00:24:33.387, Speaker A: Yeah. And so I think if you were to ask me where we are in the NFT space, where exactly where we are with BITMEX and the 10% movements, I think that's where we are. And I Think it'll get better over time with more liquidity, better guardrails for liquidations and stuff like that. But it was just interesting to see that while this was happening Also speaking.
00:24:33.411 - 00:24:39.747, Speaker B: Of that, I'm seeing. We're seeing a lot of new NFT startups.
00:24:39.851 - 00:24:42.627, Speaker A: Yes. And that is another point. That's a really good point.
00:24:42.691 - 00:24:43.267, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:24:43.411 - 00:25:16.913, Speaker B: So a year ago, we started seeing some of those about a year ago and I was a little bit skeptical because NFT Fire. What is NFT Fire is NFT Finance. And we thought that like who were the users of NFT Fire? Like who are the people who would, you know, do some leverage trading using their NFTs as collateral or trading their NFTs or, you know, trading, you know, derivatives on top of their NFTs, perps or options on top of their NFTs. And the Venn diagram of NFT people.
00:25:17.009 - 00:25:17.569, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:25:17.697 - 00:25:27.307, Speaker B: And people who understand those complex derivatives and financial instruments. The intersection of the two felt really small a year ago.
00:25:27.371 - 00:25:27.739, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:25:27.827 - 00:25:43.923, Speaker B: But now you have projects like. So we're seeing data points around NFT Perp. The project that got crushed, I got crushed by the way, a couple last week, but they were doing. Before that they were doing like what, a few million dollars worth of trading?
00:25:43.979 - 00:25:46.371, Speaker A: They were pretty good in terms of volume. I was surprised.
00:25:46.443 - 00:25:47.123, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:25:47.299 - 00:26:14.245, Speaker B: So we're. And we're seeing other startups building not just perps on top of NFTs but also options and more like lending and borrowing. There's Sharkify on Solana and there's Bandao on Ethereum, those type of projects. So that's actually pretty. It's a fairly new trend that we're seeing in this bear market.
00:26:14.665 - 00:26:28.845, Speaker A: Yeah, it's very similar to Defi, Right. In the early days where people were just using AAVE and compound and borrowing and just going trip along on an asset class. But it's very similar now on the NFT side and it's actually pretty robust.
00:26:28.965 - 00:26:36.925, Speaker B: And the volume that we're seeing now in those NFT 5 projects is similar to what we saw in the early days of Defi.
00:26:37.005 - 00:26:37.365, Speaker A: Yes.
00:26:37.445 - 00:26:38.933, Speaker B: In early 2020.
00:26:39.069 - 00:26:39.621, Speaker A: Yes.
00:26:39.733 - 00:26:41.477, Speaker B: Before the real Defi summer.
00:26:41.541 - 00:26:57.981, Speaker A: Yep. Where it went from like 50 million to like 500 million before DeFi summer happened. Yeah, that was like a crazy. I mean obviously it was also like in line with the price of eth. Right. Yeah, but yeah, it all kind of was like a catalyst that all happened so quickly.
00:26:58.093 - 00:26:58.597, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:26:58.701 - 00:27:01.997, Speaker B: I think NFTFI is still pretty non consensus now.
00:27:02.061 - 00:27:02.381, Speaker A: Yes.
00:27:02.453 - 00:27:11.709, Speaker B: But it's within the realm of possibility that we'll see something similar to defi summer with NFTs. NFTFI summer?
00:27:11.797 - 00:27:25.375, Speaker A: Possibly, I think. Well, there are a couple interesting anecdotes. One that Richard from one confirmation said NFT total market cap will surpass tokens.
00:27:25.675 - 00:27:30.307, Speaker B: Market cap, yeah, that disagree. I mean I see his point, but I fundamentally disagree.
00:27:30.451 - 00:27:40.775, Speaker A: It was just interesting and I wonder if financialization of this asset class could enable it to grow similar in a similar growth trajectory as tokens.
00:27:41.115 - 00:28:06.509, Speaker B: So as nftfi I think could be really interesting. But the reason why NFTs won't surpass fungible tokens is precisely because of the non fungibility which leads to fundamentally lower liquidity. When you have an asset that is not fungible with other assets within the same asset class, you cannot do arbitrage, you cannot do.
00:28:06.557 - 00:28:07.565, Speaker A: Can't bring liquidity in.
00:28:07.645 - 00:28:10.759, Speaker B: Yeah, it's just. I think it's Finance 101.
00:28:10.807 - 00:28:25.815, Speaker A: So you were talking about some of the NFT phys. What are some. You talked about options and perps. Maybe we could dive a little bit deeper into those and like the fungible markets, perps make a lot of sense. Yes, but does it make sense for NFTs?
00:28:25.975 - 00:28:34.151, Speaker B: It's a really good question actually. Paradigm posted that paper on NFT per pricing maybe a year ago.
00:28:34.263 - 00:28:35.147, Speaker A: Was it perps?
00:28:35.271 - 00:28:35.859, Speaker B: It was perps.
00:28:35.907 - 00:28:36.299, Speaker A: Okay.
00:28:36.387 - 00:29:05.267, Speaker B: But what's difficult about perps on top of NFTs I think is how do you calculate the index price? Because with a perp you need an index price to do the funding between the long and short. Because NFTs are fundamentally non fungible and therefore illiquid, the calculation for the index price is very tricky and it's very easy to manipulate the oracle. Right, the Oracle problem.
00:29:05.331 - 00:29:14.307, Speaker A: Yeah. Which is what happened with. What was the start of that? Just. Well, NFT purpose, NFT perp.
00:29:14.331 - 00:29:14.515, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:29:14.555 - 00:29:17.451, Speaker A: And then Roblox was another one.
00:29:17.643 - 00:29:55.423, Speaker B: I think the problem with NFT Perp was something different. But you know the vam, it's the VAM problem. But there's a more general problem with NFT Perp which is the how tricky it is to calculate the settlement price. The index price, it might be solvable, I'm not sure. But there's a cleaner way to do derivatives on top of NFTs, which is to do physical settlement rather than cash settlement. So perps is a cash settled derivative. Well, upon every expiration you settle by transferring cash from one person to the other from longs to short.
00:29:55.423 - 00:30:04.947, Speaker B: For example, physical settlement is when upon expiration there is an actual transfer of the Underlying which in this case is the nft.
00:30:05.051 - 00:30:07.163, Speaker A: Yeah, that goes to the other side.
00:30:07.219 - 00:30:07.883, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:30:08.059 - 00:30:14.735, Speaker B: So you could potentially build a physically settled futures contract.
00:30:16.075 - 00:30:17.811, Speaker A: How would that work at scale, though?
00:30:17.963 - 00:30:33.165, Speaker B: So you would expire, let's say every two weeks or every month. And upon expiration, there's a physical exchange of NFTs from the buyer of the futures seller. So futures could work. Options could work.
00:30:33.205 - 00:30:35.437, Speaker A: Options could work. And it's so much cleaner.
00:30:35.581 - 00:30:46.125, Speaker B: Options could work because again, upon expiration or upon exercise of the option, you can physically transfer the NFT from one person to the other.
00:30:46.165 - 00:30:56.791, Speaker A: We're seeing a lot of options protocols. I mean, options make sense in this case. I just don't think your average degen is savvy enough to use options.
00:30:56.863 - 00:31:27.705, Speaker B: Yeah, but okay, here's the counter argument. Robinhood. On Robinhood, the amount of options trading. So Robin has a bunch of like, options on stocks, and that's the pure, purest form of degen trading. Options trading is doing way more volume than single stocks, even if retail. Don't understand at all how options work. But what they love about options is the ability to leverage.
00:31:27.785 - 00:31:28.345, Speaker A: Yeah, that's.
00:31:28.385 - 00:31:36.361, Speaker B: That's all they need from options. Same thing with potentially options on NFTs. Because right now, one of the problems with NFTs. Well, there's actually two problems.
00:31:36.393 - 00:31:36.721, Speaker A: Okay.
00:31:36.793 - 00:31:40.969, Speaker B: One is leverage isn't. I mean, you can do leverage with blend.
00:31:41.057 - 00:31:41.353, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:31:41.409 - 00:31:42.665, Speaker B: But you can't get that much leverage.
00:31:42.705 - 00:31:43.593, Speaker A: You can't get that much leverage.
00:31:43.649 - 00:31:45.657, Speaker B: Options, you can do far more leverage.
00:31:45.721 - 00:31:46.441, Speaker A: Yes.
00:31:46.633 - 00:31:48.751, Speaker B: And two is you cannot short.
00:31:48.873 - 00:31:49.291, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:31:49.363 - 00:31:58.595, Speaker B: Like people who own NFTs, they want to be able to hedge their price. Right. Without selling the NFT itself. So options solves these two problems.
00:31:58.715 - 00:32:14.875, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. A solid point on Robinhood. You know, I've read stories of like, kids degenerating their entire life savings, parents, life savings into this and now they're down like 200k. There's a story about this.
00:32:15.035 - 00:32:17.895, Speaker B: I mean, they were up like 2 million, now they're down to 200.
00:32:18.355 - 00:32:27.019, Speaker A: So, yeah, there's a lot of that. Yeah, I'm actually pretty excited about NFT5. I feel like it's a growing asset class. It's going to get big very soon.
00:32:27.067 - 00:32:27.735, Speaker C: Yep.
00:32:28.115 - 00:32:37.283, Speaker A: Have you noticed Brian Armstrong's announcement a couple weeks ago? About what? I think he was at an event. It was a Coinbase summit.
00:32:37.339 - 00:32:38.099, Speaker B: That's right.
00:32:38.267 - 00:32:58.885, Speaker A: And I think someone asked him, like, what's the future of Coinbase? And the average person probably thinks, oh, you know, like an exchange. He threw out something. He threw Out a curveball, which is he wants to be the WeChat for crypto. And I thought that was an interesting statement because to be quite frank, everybody wants to be the WeChat for something.
00:32:59.385 - 00:33:10.977, Speaker B: Exactly. I was going to say Elon wants. Wants Twitter to be the WeChat of, you know, like social media or whatever, even something with threads. I think Zuck said something about like they were doing something that.
00:33:11.121 - 00:33:11.505, Speaker A: Forget.
00:33:11.545 - 00:33:14.085, Speaker B: Exactly. But they were doing something with payment.
00:33:14.445 - 00:33:18.261, Speaker A: They did a while ago. They were getting like MTL MSP licenses.
00:33:18.373 - 00:33:19.133, Speaker B: Yeah, that's right.
00:33:19.229 - 00:33:20.333, Speaker A: Money transfer licenses.
00:33:20.389 - 00:33:27.265, Speaker B: Yeah, that's right. So they want Instagram or threads to be the WeChat of whatever. Everyone wants them to be the WeChat.
00:33:27.805 - 00:33:36.261, Speaker A: But I don't think anyone can become the WeChat of. Yeah, I don't know if I see that behavior happening anytime soon, at least not in the U.S. i think there.
00:33:36.293 - 00:33:43.791, Speaker B: Is some path dependency that apps in the west might not be able to replicate what WeChat did.
00:33:43.823 - 00:33:45.835, Speaker A: Do you think it's because we're too lizard brain?
00:33:46.415 - 00:33:59.543, Speaker B: No. Okay, Chinese people are just as lizard brain. But I think the path dependency is that when WeChat first came out, there was no other social apps in the China region.
00:33:59.679 - 00:34:00.015, Speaker A: Okay.
00:34:00.055 - 00:34:44.307, Speaker B: WeChat was really the first at scale social application and it dominated the entire user base and there was no competition at all. And that's how they were able to roll out other applications such as financial applications, insurance, even Uber dd, that kind of stuff. But in the US the path dependency is much more different. You have like, there's so much competition, so many different choices for consumers and so many existing payment rails. I don't see how anyone can dominate everything in the U.S. maybe they can, I'm not sure. But my point being like, just because WeChat can do something doesn't mean you can do it.
00:34:44.307 - 00:34:46.491, Speaker B: There's so much history is highly path dependent.
00:34:46.523 - 00:35:54.941, Speaker A: Yeah, agreed. But okay, let's take a fun trip, right? Let's say there's no one else that competes with Coinbase and Coinbase becomes the de facto app to access crypto because it kind of feels like that way. Anyways, if that's true and they are the gateway to, I don't know, 175 million KYC wallets today or accounts, could they enable those accounts to get like access to crypto apps? Right. And if that's true, then maybe there is a pathway to at least to be the window for crypto. Not maybe for this whole super app thesis across the board, but maybe a window to Crypto, because I don't think anyone's really targeting this. And if, let's say, I mean, we're obviously both very bullish on crypto and we think that crypto is going to, at some point, touch every industry that's out there at some point. So do you think Coinbase is positioning itself now for that world that we're going to be living in 10 years from now?
00:35:55.013 - 00:35:59.505, Speaker B: Yeah, it's entirely possible. And they're best positioned to do it.
00:36:00.085 - 00:36:04.485, Speaker A: There's the most trusted party to do it. I trust Coinbase more than I trust anyone else right now.
00:36:04.565 - 00:36:16.653, Speaker B: Yes, but that's just you. But let's play devil's advocate, because Coinbase is probably the best position to do that. But they have fierce competition in Binance, for example.
00:36:16.789 - 00:36:18.113, Speaker A: But not in the US though.
00:36:18.229 - 00:36:30.489, Speaker B: Not in the us, but, I mean, like, crypto is way bigger than the US, 100%. But my point being, Binance is equally well positioned to do that outside of the us.
00:36:30.577 - 00:36:31.321, Speaker A: Okay.
00:36:31.513 - 00:36:37.529, Speaker B: I think even Metamask has the ability to do it because they own the crypto native people.
00:36:37.657 - 00:36:42.209, Speaker A: But that's not many users though, right? 40 million. 50 million. Let's say now they hit 50 million.
00:36:42.257 - 00:36:42.417, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:36:42.441 - 00:36:45.207, Speaker B: So Coinbase can continue to own the on ramp.
00:36:45.361 - 00:36:48.371, Speaker A: They can own the onramp and the KYC users.
00:36:48.443 - 00:36:49.091, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:36:49.243 - 00:37:05.867, Speaker A: Their goal is now to turn those kyc. Okay. They got to control the deflection that's happening. Yes, because they have a big deflection problem. The deflection problem is KYC users that come into Coinbase, that leave Coinbase to.
00:37:05.891 - 00:37:11.323, Speaker B: Binance, which is what happened in the last bear market, from Coinbase to Binance, for example.
00:37:11.459 - 00:37:15.627, Speaker A: Now what's happening is Coinbase Uniswap, but.
00:37:15.651 - 00:37:17.575, Speaker B: Really it's Coinbase to Metamask.
00:37:18.035 - 00:37:20.067, Speaker A: Yes, Coinbase to Metamask.
00:37:20.091 - 00:37:20.251, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:37:20.283 - 00:37:21.827, Speaker B: Coinbase doesn't own the users yet.
00:37:21.851 - 00:37:40.461, Speaker A: They don't yet. Yeah. Well, that's the reason why they launched the Wallet. The Wallet. That's the reason why they launched Base. Right. And I think the goal now is to own the identity, the wallet, the user in crypto on crypto rails and off crypto Rails.
00:37:40.563 - 00:37:41.105, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:37:41.225 - 00:37:49.361, Speaker A: And that's where the deflection was happening. So all these people were leaving and then MetaMask started gaining adoption and these other apps and et cetera.
00:37:49.433 - 00:37:50.089, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:37:50.257 - 00:37:55.529, Speaker A: And so now I think Coinbase is trying to position themselves to like, own the customer end to end.
00:37:55.577 - 00:37:55.881, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:37:55.953 - 00:37:59.497, Speaker A: You can go anywhere you want, but use us as the identity provider.
00:37:59.561 - 00:38:05.545, Speaker B: Coinbase is so powerful in a way. I love Coinbase I love, you know.
00:38:05.585 - 00:38:06.977, Speaker A: I mean you're long Coinbase, so I'm.
00:38:07.001 - 00:38:25.687, Speaker B: Long Coinbase and I love what they are doing for our industry. But in a way I almost wish they won't be able to execute as well. They'll kill a lot of startups because the startups have not nearly as much aggregation power as Columbus does.
00:38:25.871 - 00:39:12.323, Speaker A: Well then let's say Brian Armstrong was in this room. He would counter by saying, well, that's why we're building base. We want all the startups to build on our future and that's how we're enabling more founders to build in space. I think what they're killing is the wallets because that is the window to the world. But I don't know what the plan is for base. Is the idea that startups that are building on base are only going to please KYC users, then does that mean that all of base is going to be KYC liquidity? And if that's true, then would that bring in more institutions into the space? Because now they know who their counterparties are. I don't know.
00:39:12.419 - 00:39:13.243, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know either.
00:39:13.299 - 00:39:33.935, Speaker A: Yeah, but yeah, I mean I thought that was very interesting when they made that announcement and then yesterday they just made an announcement that they are, they've launched Wallet to Wallet messaging. And in the summit that Brian Armstrong was talking at, he said, we want to enable social experiences, wallets a wallet.
00:39:33.975 - 00:39:35.335, Speaker B: Messaging within the Coinbase. Wallet.
00:39:35.375 - 00:39:35.623, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:39:35.679 - 00:39:36.215, Speaker B: Okay.
00:39:36.335 - 00:39:38.927, Speaker A: I haven't used messaging.
00:39:39.071 - 00:39:39.895, Speaker C: Yeah. Yet.
00:39:39.975 - 00:40:17.891, Speaker A: Yeah, I get a lot of inbound from like degens that want to buy my NFTs at like shitty prices where on block scan. And now, now what they do is they air, they drop an NFT and it has a message on the NFT. So like one time I opened up my OpenSea account, I was just like looking through my collections and I saw this like weird like nft. I'm like, I never bought this. I opened it and there was a text message on that NFT says hey, I'll buy X for this price. Message me on Twitter.
00:40:18.003 - 00:40:21.187, Speaker B: That's really interesting. Where did you see that? You saw that on OpenSea?
00:40:21.211 - 00:40:23.403, Speaker A: Yeah, and my collection.
00:40:23.579 - 00:40:24.171, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:40:24.283 - 00:40:34.175, Speaker A: So and then like then I clicked on his or her profile profile and they were sending out these NFTs to, I don't know, hundreds of people.
00:40:34.595 - 00:40:39.835, Speaker B: That's the most crypto, native address to address messaging form of messaging.
00:40:39.875 - 00:40:56.703, Speaker A: But that also shows you that like human behavior can usually predict what products should be built. And that is like a very natural human behavior. Right? Like, yeah, Messaging makes a lot of sense. It makes a lot of sense. It's just how is this going to work? Because there's so many different messaging protocols.
00:40:56.799 - 00:40:57.351, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:40:57.463 - 00:41:31.039, Speaker A: It seems like XMTP is leading the way in this because they integrated with Lens, they integrated with Coinbase and they may become the. I'm not saying they are, but they may become like more or less the de facto for messaging within these different architectures or ecosystems. So it seems like Coinbase is paving the way for wallet to wallet messaging and social interactions. DAP development and just being the window to crypto. You could also say that about backpack too. Sort of. Right.
00:41:31.039 - 00:41:32.239, Speaker A: Yeah. Interesting.
00:41:32.327 - 00:41:44.535, Speaker B: Convince did something very. They started going from just a DJing Shikon casino into a full on like crypto native developer.
00:41:44.615 - 00:41:44.991, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:41:45.063 - 00:41:47.503, Speaker B: You know, ecosystem about a year or two ago.
00:41:47.559 - 00:42:03.631, Speaker A: I wasn't expecting that at all. And that's probably the smartest thing you could do. And we talked about this in our, in our podcast when we were comparing Sam Bankman Fried with we did Brian Armstrong and we said like, well, our.
00:42:03.663 - 00:42:12.897, Speaker B: Prediction, I remember our prediction, it was ftx Will would dominate Tradfi and Coinbase would dominate Cryptonatus.
00:42:13.001 - 00:42:15.097, Speaker A: In the long term, crypto natives is the way to go.
00:42:15.161 - 00:42:16.265, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah.
00:42:16.425 - 00:42:20.885, Speaker A: Because you have so much more optionality. Right. Versus Tradfi's.
00:42:21.505 - 00:42:22.081, Speaker C: What?
00:42:22.193 - 00:42:35.045, Speaker A: You know, price, speed, liquidity. Right, that's it. One more thing he mentioned was, I just thought very small point was, you know, people that hold a certain type of NFT or PO app could message each other.
00:42:36.775 - 00:42:38.383, Speaker B: Nft. Gated messaging.
00:42:38.439 - 00:43:06.191, Speaker A: Yeah. I just thought that was interesting because, you know, we're always talking about, you know, what are NFT communities? I mean, are they just JPEG holders that are all of a certain DNA? Like if you look at D gods, you know, I call them like frat boys or girls. Right. And so like each of these communities has some sort of DNA that brings people together of similar DNAs to buy into so they could participate in this like group chat.
00:43:06.263 - 00:43:06.955, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:43:07.375 - 00:43:25.515, Speaker A: And so then like, you know, messaging, could that enable more people to just like, you know, be closer? I don't know. I just thought that was an interesting point that he brought up. I think we touched on this a little bit, but real world assets. What are your thoughts?
00:43:25.815 - 00:43:39.855, Speaker B: I am very surprised by the amount of traction we've seen so far. Even Robert Leshner announced his new startup. I don't know what's happening with Compound. Actually.
00:43:40.435 - 00:43:41.819, Speaker A: Compound has a new CEO.
00:43:41.907 - 00:43:51.563, Speaker B: Okay. But anyway, Leshner was the founder of Compound and now he's working On a new startup, Superstate. Forgot the name.
00:43:51.619 - 00:43:52.395, Speaker A: Yeah, I think Superstate.
00:43:52.435 - 00:44:05.019, Speaker B: But the idea is to bring tradfi assets on chain like bonds, bonds, and, you know, other assets. But the first asset class to bring on chain, I believe is Treasuries.
00:44:05.147 - 00:44:09.203, Speaker A: Was it Treasuries? Was it not? I think it was bonds.
00:44:09.339 - 00:44:10.595, Speaker B: I mean, Treasuries.
00:44:10.635 - 00:44:10.899, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:44:10.947 - 00:44:15.747, Speaker B: But specifically there was US Treasuries is a form of bond.
00:44:15.811 - 00:44:19.355, Speaker A: It is a form of bond, but there was, I think municipal bonds.
00:44:19.515 - 00:44:20.139, Speaker B: Oh, is it?
00:44:20.187 - 00:44:20.675, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:44:20.795 - 00:44:39.233, Speaker B: Okay. I think I forgot the details, but whatever. Yeah, I saw the, I just quickly went through this. I saw the SEC filing, but I would not be surprised that it's US Treasuries that. Well, so far, Treasuries are the main RWA that got traction so far.
00:44:39.289 - 00:44:42.257, Speaker A: Why is that? Obviously macro has a lot to do with. But maybe.
00:44:42.361 - 00:45:55.935, Speaker B: Yeah, I think there's two, It's a combination of two reasons. One was actually Silver Bank, Silvergate bank or Silicon Valley bank that, you know, the whole drama with the banking crisis a few months ago that led crypto native startups or organizations to think about diversifying their Treasuries or their money. Right. Well, if you are a crypto native organization and you want to avoid the counterparty, minimize counterparty risks, you don't want to hold cash, you don't want to hold US dollar in a bank account, you want to hold either Bitcoin, ether or US Treasuries held at the Federal Reserve. Because Treasuries have arguably the lowest level of counterparty risks, you don't want to be exposed to that. And so for a crypto native organization, in order to have exposure to US Treasuries, it's a lot of operational work. You have to open bank accounts with the banks that support this kind of assets, or you need to open an account with the Federal Reserve.
00:45:55.935 - 00:45:57.907, Speaker B: It's a pain in the ass for.
00:45:58.011 - 00:46:02.035, Speaker A: And we're talking for retail? No, no, just for institutions. Right.
00:46:02.075 - 00:46:02.555, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:46:02.675 - 00:46:03.787, Speaker A: So what about for retail?
00:46:03.891 - 00:46:05.859, Speaker B: You mean retail trading Treasuries?
00:46:05.907 - 00:46:06.251, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:46:06.323 - 00:46:07.579, Speaker B: Is that happening? I don't think it's happening.
00:46:07.627 - 00:46:08.043, Speaker A: It's not.
00:46:08.099 - 00:46:08.667, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:46:08.811 - 00:46:16.735, Speaker B: I think it's crypto native organizations that want U.S. treasuries, but users do too.
00:46:16.895 - 00:46:18.839, Speaker A: And so users can KYC and.
00:46:18.927 - 00:46:31.951, Speaker B: Yeah, they can. But those who are willing to trade or own US Treasuries, they already have like interactive brokers or like some tradfi brokerage account. But for crypto native startups, it's, it's, it's, it's Harder. It's harder.
00:46:32.023 - 00:46:32.675, Speaker A: Okay.
00:46:33.375 - 00:46:49.185, Speaker B: By the way, the banks are. Some of the banks are deplatforming crypto. Crypto companies left and right. So the easiest way to. For the crypto startups to own Treasuries, it's just to buy it on chain. It's a lot lower friction and the.
00:46:49.225 - 00:46:54.553, Speaker A: Process is very seamless. You just sign in what you wallet KYC and deposit usdc.
00:46:54.609 - 00:46:54.993, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:46:55.089 - 00:47:12.943, Speaker B: So it's a combination of that need from the whole banking crisis and the fact that treasuries are yielding 5% now, which is ridiculously high. It's never happened in the last like 10 years. It's a real source of revenue. So I think that's what's leading to the rise of tokenized Treasuries.
00:47:12.999 - 00:47:38.631, Speaker A: Yeah, I didn't see this coming. I thought it was going to be more defi crypto native assets. So some interesting points on what you mentioned is Franklin Templeton, they have their own tokenized treasury bill fund. They issued it on Stellar. You remember the Stellar piece back in the day?
00:47:38.743 - 00:47:39.435, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:47:40.015 - 00:47:42.287, Speaker A: I don't know why, But Stellar has.
00:47:42.311 - 00:47:45.183, Speaker B: $300 million in TVL from RWAs.
00:47:45.279 - 00:47:54.783, Speaker A: From RWAs. And I think whichever layer one can capture this can become the de facto RWA layer that we aren't thinking about yet.
00:47:54.919 - 00:47:55.927, Speaker B: Oh my God.
00:47:56.031 - 00:48:24.561, Speaker A: Which means that layer ones need to think about this. Like, if you can bring this TVL into. Onto your layer one, that can expose them to KYC liquidity. Which means that could be a big competitor to. Let's say base was trying to go after Coinbase's base was going to go after like KYC liquidity. Because then you can see institutions easily building their own DEFI protocols or even trading because it's all KYC liquidity.
00:48:24.673 - 00:48:30.689, Speaker B: Why did they choose Stellar? It makes no sense. There's no interoperability with the rest of Defi.
00:48:30.857 - 00:48:47.583, Speaker A: There's none. Yeah, I'm not saying this is going to happen, but maybe that will be differentiated in terms of what's happening on Ethereum. Like KYC liquidity. Non KYC liquidity. But it was just a very interesting point because there's a total of 600 million TVL. Half of it is on Stellar.
00:48:47.719 - 00:48:53.903, Speaker B: Jesus. But hold on. $600 million of TVL?
00:48:54.039 - 00:49:06.105, Speaker A: This is right before like. And I'm giving you an antidote which is like 2020, March, April 2020, whatever it was, we were at like 500 million TVL in DeFi.
00:49:07.725 - 00:49:15.621, Speaker B: Okay, but. But to be fair, the RW Treasuries is not really comparable to DeFi, like crypto native assets.
00:49:15.693 - 00:49:16.213, Speaker A: Right.
00:49:16.349 - 00:49:27.309, Speaker B: Like $600 million worth of treasuries compared to, let's say, equivalent number of defi assets. It's far less meaningful because it's far less volatile.
00:49:27.397 - 00:49:27.885, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:49:28.005 - 00:49:42.485, Speaker B: If it's far less volatile, it means it. Because the platforms where these assets are traded and issued can capture a smaller percentage of transaction fees. So for me, 600.
00:49:42.605 - 00:49:44.149, Speaker A: I see. Revenue wise.
00:49:44.237 - 00:49:59.773, Speaker B: Revenue wise, yes. Because if it's less volatile, there's less trading and then you can't charge that much money. So $600 million of treasuries for me is equivalent to $6 million of shit coins.
00:49:59.829 - 00:50:18.819, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay, so Scott Lewis, pretty popular Twitter. He was one of the founders of Kanto. He launched Code Arena. Well respected builder in the space. He sent out a tweet which I forwarded to you that says RWAs to $1 trillion.
00:50:18.957 - 00:50:25.711, Speaker B: Yeah, I see that. I mean like fixed income is $100 trillion order of magnitude.
00:50:25.743 - 00:50:26.191, Speaker A: Yes.
00:50:26.303 - 00:50:31.075, Speaker B: Stocks is what, like in the US is 20?
00:50:31.375 - 00:50:32.155, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:50:32.975 - 00:50:39.591, Speaker B: And then you have real estate, which I'm a little bit skeptical. Real estate is also multi hundred trillion dollars.
00:50:39.663 - 00:50:40.623, Speaker A: We can talk about that too.
00:50:40.679 - 00:50:52.755, Speaker B: Foreign exchange is multi hundred trillion dollars. Derivatives is tradified. Derivatives is on the order of quadrillion dollars.
00:50:52.915 - 00:50:54.731, Speaker A: So derivatives is obviously the biggest market.
00:50:54.803 - 00:50:59.659, Speaker B: Yeah, so yeah, like one trillion out of one quadrillion. Yeah, sure, I can see that.
00:50:59.707 - 00:51:05.275, Speaker A: Yeah. The question is one. Right. I mean, how soon do you think we could hit a trillion dollars?
00:51:05.435 - 00:51:06.291, Speaker B: I don't know.
00:51:06.443 - 00:51:09.467, Speaker A: Obviously it's speculation, but yeah, it depends.
00:51:09.491 - 00:51:19.995, Speaker B: On how Tradfi perceives crypto, I think largely. And their perception are changing as a result of the very. Larry Fink.
00:51:20.535 - 00:51:23.207, Speaker A: Larry Fink, man, for those who don't.
00:51:23.231 - 00:51:38.095, Speaker B: Know, CEO of BlackRock, which recently filed for a Bitcoin ETF. The reason why that is really meaningful is because Larry Fink is a big figure in Tradfi and blackrock.
00:51:38.175 - 00:51:39.079, Speaker A: Why is he a big figure?
00:51:39.167 - 00:52:24.015, Speaker B: Well, blackrock, Larry Fink apparently is very well connected with the politicians. And as a result, partly as a result of that, BlackRock has been very successful in their ETF business, among other businesses. But in terms of ETF, like a lot of people know this, but only one out of their 300 ETF applications got denied and every single one of the rest got approved by the sec. And the one that got denied was called something like non transparent etf. I mean the name itself, the SEC wouldn't like that. So the reason why. Well, okay, so the most obvious immediate effect of the bitcoin filing is that it's likely that this one will get approved.
00:52:24.015 - 00:52:58.761, Speaker B: I don't know what the probability, but it's far more likely than every other ETF application we've seen so far for bitcoin. But more importantly, the fact that BlackRock and Larry Fink, the fact that BlackRock filed for this ETF and Larry Fink has been talking about this, has been talking about bitcoin on various media says gold. Yeah, it really changes the perception. It's influencing the perception of tratfi towards crypto. And this happened in the last two weeks.
00:52:58.833 - 00:52:59.457, Speaker A: Conditioning.
00:52:59.561 - 00:53:00.113, Speaker C: Yes.
00:53:00.249 - 00:53:25.961, Speaker A: Two things I want to point out to what he said on that interview. One was bitcoin is a form of digital gold that isn't a US based issuance. Like it's an international currency. Kept saying international currency, which I thought was a very interesting positioning. The number two thing he said is that everything's going to be tokenized. He kept saying tokenized, tokenized, tokenized. And so those are two things that I got out of.
00:53:25.961 - 00:53:45.899, Speaker A: Like him speaking on different event circuits and now seeing, you know, bonds and treasury bills and getting tokenized. Right. And Franklin Templeton, I mean we're not talking like, you know, a startup in crypto. Right. We're talking like a premier traditional finance player.
00:53:45.987 - 00:53:46.323, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:53:46.379 - 00:54:12.535, Speaker A: That issued T bill treasury bills, tokenized treasury bills and they're already at 300 million. Right. It's very easy. I could, I could foresee rwas picking up steam over the next six months to a year. And although the way it monetizes and captures fees is different, it's probably going to be much easier for them to bring on more TVL than it is for DeFi.
00:54:13.115 - 00:54:14.811, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely more TVL.
00:54:14.963 - 00:54:57.455, Speaker A: But what does it mean in terms of monetization and revenue? It'll be different, but we'll probably see an influx of growth there. And there are other couple players that are out there too, like Maple Finance and Ondo and others that are working to build out this crypto native like T bills. The other area of real world assets is Goldfinch private credit. So essentially what Goldfinch does is people deposit their USDC and then they find legitimate borrowers. They're in the space. And specifically the borrowers that they bring are people or growth, like growth stage startups as an example.
00:54:57.535 - 00:54:57.815, Speaker C: Yep.
00:54:57.855 - 00:55:12.631, Speaker A: And it turns out it's very predatory. Like the lenders in the space right now are very predatory to these types of customers because they don't really have, you know, let's say reputation. Right. Or collateral or because they're in growth, right?
00:55:12.703 - 00:55:13.167, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:55:13.271 - 00:56:07.379, Speaker A: So it's a very capital intensive period that they're in and so they need access to credit too. And we're talking well known growth stage startups, right? Not like your mom and pop store or like a startup that was just funded by whoever they need access to good terms. And it turns out they found this like niche. And now the way this works is like, you know, people deposit usdc, they get some sort of like fixed Yield, let's say 15 to 20%, and they find these borrowers that are credible and they provide collateral in the form of real world assets. It could be their equity, it could be other things that they look for. And once they're approved, then they can take out this loan and then they pay an interest rate of 18% or 15% or whatever. And then they also give out their token as yield as well.
00:56:07.379 - 00:56:25.743, Speaker A: But there's like a whole new form of users that are coming into crypto that previously didn't come into crypto and now they're getting access to credit. And USDC is like the main form of stablecoin that's being used. What are your thoughts on that? And it's a $1.5 trillion market.
00:56:25.839 - 00:56:26.515, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:56:26.935 - 00:57:07.425, Speaker B: The common theme between private debt and previously the US Treasuries is that we've always known that tokenization of RWAs will happen. That's the end vision. We just didn't know how long it would take. But oftentimes people try to tokenize stocks, for example, people tokenize the real estate. None of these things actually worked. I think you can't picture this envision of tokenization of everything and start working on the end state of things. You have to start with things that are immediately useful to certain user segments.
00:57:07.425 - 00:57:14.885, Speaker B: So in the case of US Treasuries, it's the startups that need US Treasuries to diversify their portfolio now.
00:57:14.965 - 00:57:19.093, Speaker A: And the macro too, right? I mean there's a couple of things that played out that enabled this to.
00:57:19.109 - 00:57:50.157, Speaker B: Kind of take off. Yes, the 5%, like the Jerome Powell race had the fastest rate in the history of humanity. And then in the case of private debt of Goldfinch, it's these underserved growth startups that need money now. So even if the envision is the tokenization of everything, you have to start with things that are immediately useful. And that's the lesson, that's the main lesson. Okay, so then the question is what other.
00:57:50.301 - 00:57:51.465, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly.
00:57:51.925 - 00:57:58.385, Speaker B: Existing immediate needs do people have now in terms of like tradfi like traditional assets.
00:57:58.765 - 00:58:04.085, Speaker A: Well, okay, so let's maybe lay out all the real world asset categories. I think real estate's another obvious one.
00:58:04.125 - 00:58:15.125, Speaker B: Yeah, real estate. I don't really. I mean, I'm. Broadly speaking, I don't really see it. Except for maybe REITs.
00:58:15.205 - 00:58:15.789, Speaker A: Okay.
00:58:15.917 - 00:58:17.109, Speaker B: Like tokenized REITs.
00:58:17.157 - 00:58:17.639, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:58:17.757 - 00:58:26.419, Speaker B: But the question is, why do you want to tokenize REITs? Maybe again, crypto native organizations want to diversify their portfolio.
00:58:26.507 - 00:58:55.885, Speaker A: Yeah, crypto native. Even institute like. Okay, let's move this to the side. What's the onboarding process for institutions that want access to T bills right now? Because there are startups that are outside of crypto that are looking for this, right? Yeah, it's a process. It's not easy to get access to, you know, T bills. So you have to get kyc, then you have to go through different brokerage accounts and talk to service desk people. And like there's a whole process.
00:58:55.885 - 00:59:02.085, Speaker A: There isn't a way where I can just log in and buy it. Do you think that's. That's all it takes?
00:59:03.145 - 00:59:24.137, Speaker B: It needs more than that. Okay, well, so there needs to be easy onboarding, but also there needs to be an immediate need for demand for the asset class. Of course, I'm not sure if there is a real demand for REITs by crypto organizations now because the vast majority of REITs are commercial real estate and they're going to.
00:59:24.201 - 00:59:25.905, Speaker A: They're the great fit right now. Yeah.
00:59:26.065 - 00:59:29.737, Speaker B: Because of again, Jerome, Lord.
00:59:29.761 - 00:59:30.345, Speaker A: Jerome.
00:59:30.465 - 00:59:36.153, Speaker B: The only asset that benefited from Jerome is the very short term government.
00:59:36.249 - 00:59:36.657, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:59:36.721 - 00:59:55.975, Speaker B: Treasury. Everything else is price in relation to that. So everything else went down and are going down. So. Yeah, Reece, I'm not sure. By the way, I don't think we should talk about asset. Broad asset classes because it's too broad, it's too general.
00:59:55.975 - 01:00:13.075, Speaker B: Within every asset class, there's specific assets that specific users might need today that you and I just don't know. Maybe there might be some really interesting assets that certain groups of people really want now, but it's hard for us to speculate on.
01:00:13.375 - 01:00:24.375, Speaker A: Yeah, I think you're right. But I want to bring up some interesting points. We get a lot of startups that are applying for like tokenized real estate. I think to me, I'm very bearish on that.
01:00:24.495 - 01:00:26.471, Speaker B: Just it depends on the specifics.
01:00:26.623 - 01:00:32.449, Speaker A: Again, agreed. But generally tokenizing each real estate, like.
01:00:32.497 - 01:00:36.961, Speaker B: Property, each house, I don't think too fragmented. It's too fragmented.
01:00:37.033 - 01:00:37.313, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:00:37.369 - 01:00:38.005, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:00:38.425 - 01:00:41.245, Speaker A: But maybe as a collection of houses.
01:00:41.745 - 01:00:43.113, Speaker B: But again, like, why would you do.
01:00:43.129 - 01:01:09.231, Speaker A: That versus buying REITs yeah, exactly. So from that perspective, yes. But what I would do is I would buy a deed like right now if I go on MLS, which is the, you know, in the U.S. mLS is like the platform you use to like browse real estate and then like, you know, go to open houses so you can look at the house and make a purchase. And that process is horrible.
01:01:09.303 - 01:01:09.767, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:01:09.871 - 01:01:16.879, Speaker A: Like you have to get Realtors from both on the buy side and the sell side. They both collect 2.5% each on the sale of the property.
01:01:16.927 - 01:01:17.871, Speaker B: It's crazy.
01:01:18.063 - 01:01:26.287, Speaker A: Okay, that's 5%. Lawyers collect a fee. The person that transfers the deed collects the fee. The state collects a fee. I mean, you have all of these.
01:01:26.311 - 01:01:28.551, Speaker B: You pay like what, like 8, 9%.
01:01:28.703 - 01:01:34.703, Speaker A: At the end of the day. Yeah. On an average property that's worth between 300 to a million dollars. That's a lot of money.
01:01:34.759 - 01:01:35.607, Speaker C: Yeah. Would.
01:01:35.631 - 01:01:38.455, Speaker A: I would avoid it. Yes, that's a lot of money.
01:01:38.535 - 01:01:39.079, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:01:39.207 - 01:01:47.275, Speaker A: And so I could see a world where MLS just becomes an exchange and these properties are just NFTs.
01:01:47.615 - 01:01:52.927, Speaker B: Maybe. We'll see. By the way, I think Zillow is more. Is better positioned to do.
01:01:52.991 - 01:02:21.319, Speaker A: Right, right. I'm not saying that OpenSea is going to do this. I'm going to say. What I'm saying is like I could see a player coming into this space that could revolutionize the way we buy property. But, but this is, you know, a very hard problem tackle because you have to get. Each state has its own way of settling property, sales of the property and regular regulations. So you have to do like an uber, like move.
01:02:21.319 - 01:02:24.991, Speaker A: Right. Going to each state and demanding uniformity across different states.
01:02:25.063 - 01:02:25.383, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:02:25.439 - 01:02:26.775, Speaker A: So it's a very hard problem. I know.
01:02:26.855 - 01:02:35.547, Speaker B: I think the time horizon we're looking at for stuff like, like tokenizing individual properties is on the order of decades, not even years.
01:02:35.611 - 01:02:49.495, Speaker A: Yes, yes. NFTs, maybe 10, 15. Yeah. Over a decade. I don't see this happening anytime soon. But it's just fun to talk about because I think this is something that could happen. Which leads me to our next point.
01:02:49.495 - 01:02:52.379, Speaker A: So did we cover everything with real world assets, you think?
01:02:52.467 - 01:03:24.765, Speaker B: I think we did. So when we talk about real world assets, the most obvious one, the most obvious form of real estate asset, a real world asset is stablecoins, of course, because the US dollar, of course, is the real world asset that was first tokenized and first getting adopted at scale. And it was first adopted for arbitragers to do cross exchange arbitrage to trade one coin here and then transfer the Funds to another exchange.
01:03:25.335 - 01:03:46.175, Speaker A: I think even before that. I'll just tell you about my like 2016, you know, I was, let's say I had shitcoins full of. In a wallet, right. Like everyone did. But you know, the market was going down and there's no way to exit tokens. Right. So like, I think one problem it solved was having some sort of stable asset in an environment like that.
01:03:46.175 - 01:03:47.759, Speaker A: The second is arbitragers. I think.
01:03:47.807 - 01:03:48.199, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:03:48.287 - 01:04:13.765, Speaker B: I remember in2016 I was looking at USDT. Yes, it was USDT on Poloniex. So Poloniex doesn't do, at least back in the day, they didn't do fiat quoted pairs. They did it. It was either quoted in BTC or usdt. And there was also Monero for some reason as a quota asset. But anyway, one of the quota assets was usdt.
01:04:13.765 - 01:04:59.005, Speaker B: And I remember looking at it, I was like, what the hell is usdt? I actually didn't get it back then. But what I realized at some point was that you could do arbitrage between Poloniex and other exchanges that supported USDT by trading on Poloniex and then transferring the asset from one exchange to another via usdt. Because previously the way you do arbitrage across exchanges, even in Tradfi, for example, is there needs to be some sort of rail, some sort of rail for. For Fiat, for US dollar and that rail, those rails are very slow. But with usdt, it's instant. It's pretty much instant. It depends just on the settlement time of the layer one on which the USDT is issued.
01:04:59.005 - 01:05:13.245, Speaker B: But again, this brings back to the point of how do rws get adopted? You can't start with the envision. Start building for that envision. You have to start with some initial, very niche use case.
01:05:13.785 - 01:05:14.825, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah.
01:05:14.905 - 01:05:18.497, Speaker B: And that, that niche for stable clients is arbitrage for me.
01:05:18.521 - 01:05:48.135, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, very solid point. And that goes into exactly how founders should be thinking about this is don't go in and say like, I want to tokenize real estate. I'm like, yeah, what problem are you trying to solve, dude? Like, there's REITs, there's other things, but you know, try to find specific problems like the. What you mentioned here or what Goldfinch is doing, or tokenized treasure bills they're doing. Find a beach head and then focus on that. And then over time you can expand into the broader market.
01:05:48.215 - 01:05:48.735, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:05:48.855 - 01:06:04.927, Speaker B: And don't worry if the niche looks small today because serendipitous things happen over time. Yeah, luck happens and you're going to figure out other use cases, e.g. stablecoin or tokenized treasury or tokenized whatever.
01:06:05.031 - 01:06:06.535, Speaker A: Yeah, right. Yeah.
01:06:06.655 - 01:06:12.167, Speaker B: Focus on the immediately useful problem to solve immediate pain point for people.
01:06:12.351 - 01:06:19.351, Speaker A: Exactly. And that kind of like brings us to our next point, which is, did you see that crunch based report?
01:06:19.503 - 01:06:20.335, Speaker B: I didn't see it.
01:06:20.415 - 01:06:24.207, Speaker A: How about the pitch book? No, you did see.
01:06:24.311 - 01:06:25.551, Speaker B: I saw the electric.
01:06:25.703 - 01:06:27.703, Speaker A: Maybe talk a bit about what you saw.
01:06:27.839 - 01:07:00.445, Speaker B: So electric updated. So for those who don't know, Electric Capital, one of the VCs, later stage VCs in crypto and they have this ongoing like live data for. Well, not, I don't know how live it is, but ongoing data for developer activity in crypto. And the last data point shows that the number of active developers in crypto is down almost a quarter over 20% from the top.
01:07:00.745 - 01:07:01.433, Speaker A: Wow.
01:07:01.569 - 01:07:09.713, Speaker B: And the number of new developers coming to crypto, these two are somewhat different. Is down almost half.
01:07:09.809 - 01:07:10.409, Speaker A: Okay.
01:07:10.537 - 01:07:11.361, Speaker B: From the top.
01:07:11.473 - 01:07:12.153, Speaker A: That's huge.
01:07:12.249 - 01:07:12.925, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:07:13.785 - 01:07:20.953, Speaker B: And it's not surprising. We felt it. We knew this was going to happen. We felt it through our application pipeline.
01:07:21.049 - 01:07:22.401, Speaker A: This is typical in everyday market, right?
01:07:22.433 - 01:07:23.121, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:07:23.313 - 01:07:42.649, Speaker A: What's atypical though is, and maybe this is like, I don't know how accurate this data is, but I think it was Crunchbase that published a report recently that showed that crypto startups being founded at this period is at an all time low. And we're talking back from 2012.
01:07:42.777 - 01:07:44.441, Speaker B: Wait, all time low?
01:07:44.553 - 01:07:55.667, Speaker A: All time low since 2012 or something like that. If you look at the bar graph, it goes from 2012, then you see these spikes and now we're seeing it measure up against 2012 numbers.
01:07:55.731 - 01:07:56.515, Speaker B: How is that possible?
01:07:56.595 - 01:07:57.739, Speaker A: I don't know how true this is.
01:07:57.787 - 01:07:58.131, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:07:58.203 - 01:08:17.655, Speaker A: But it's being circulated all over Twitter right now. And then I saw another data point, I think Jacqueline from TechCrunch reported, that showed that last bull market, which was two years ago, a year and a half ago, total crypto venture funding was at 12 billion. Now we're at 2.2 billion.
01:08:19.295 - 01:08:21.167, Speaker B: 12 billion is the bull market.
01:08:21.231 - 01:08:22.647, Speaker A: Bull market for that quarter.
01:08:22.711 - 01:08:29.567, Speaker B: Okay, which quarter? Oh, like Q4, 2021. Yeah, that was the top of.
01:08:29.711 - 01:08:30.439, Speaker A: That was the top.
01:08:30.527 - 01:08:35.835, Speaker B: Every bubble. Every asset class bubble. So the mother of all bubbles, mother of all.
01:08:36.815 - 01:08:42.275, Speaker A: And then she compared it to this recent one, which is like Q2 of 2023.
01:08:42.905 - 01:08:44.729, Speaker B: So down 80%.
01:08:44.841 - 01:08:46.161, Speaker A: 80%, yeah. 2 billion.
01:08:46.233 - 01:08:46.561, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:08:46.633 - 01:08:55.601, Speaker A: Which is interesting. Right. And then we're seeing. We're not. And even like the types of. So we're seeing. I'm seeing A couple of things.
01:08:55.601 - 01:09:01.321, Speaker A: Right. One is, like, venture funding investing is actually becoming harder than it has over the past two years.
01:09:01.393 - 01:09:01.977, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:09:02.121 - 01:09:13.804, Speaker A: Like, you would expect, like, when FTX happened that, you know, venture funding would dry up. It didn't. Like, it was. It was harder not getting. Not saying it wasn't, but it was okay.
01:09:13.884 - 01:09:14.544, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:09:15.124 - 01:09:25.092, Speaker A: You know, when Three Arrows or Luna. All of these, like, cattle events that have happened, it didn't really dry up, but it's drying up now.
01:09:25.148 - 01:09:25.596, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:09:25.700 - 01:09:26.664, Speaker A: Which is weird.
01:09:26.964 - 01:09:27.636, Speaker B: It's not.
01:09:27.740 - 01:09:31.348, Speaker A: Do you think it's because, you know, public, private market lag, six months.
01:09:31.436 - 01:09:38.952, Speaker B: Yeah, there's always that kind of lag. The private market always lags the public market by, I don't know, half a year. A year.
01:09:39.048 - 01:09:39.456, Speaker A: Okay.
01:09:39.520 - 01:09:46.952, Speaker B: You know, prices go down, VCs get scared, but it takes them a long time to really adjust to the new expectations.
01:09:47.048 - 01:09:47.720, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:09:47.872 - 01:09:50.768, Speaker B: And right now, we're at the rock bottom.
01:09:50.936 - 01:09:55.632, Speaker A: I feel like we have to be, because, I mean, there's so many founders that I know that are grinding it out.
01:09:55.688 - 01:09:56.364, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:09:56.744 - 01:10:09.385, Speaker B: But also, like, there's a lot of founders that have extremely unrealistic expectations of where the valuation is and what kind of money they can raise, what kind of terms they can get.
01:10:09.465 - 01:10:12.169, Speaker A: This is one part that just annoys me.
01:10:12.257 - 01:10:31.685, Speaker B: It's really frustrating. And they don't listen to our advice. Like, we see so many data points. I don't think anyone sees that many data points as we do. And they just come into this fundraising effort with extremely high expectations of what they got. But the market has completely changed from two years ago.
01:10:32.425 - 01:10:38.545, Speaker A: I think one common mistake that I see founders make is that they compare. They compare themselves against their competitors.
01:10:38.625 - 01:10:39.361, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:10:39.553 - 01:10:47.017, Speaker A: Oh, you know, person A raised at a $50 million valuation. So I'm gonna do it, too. I'm gonna do 51.
01:10:47.121 - 01:10:47.617, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:10:47.721 - 01:10:55.857, Speaker A: And then, you know, the feedback I give is like, don't worry about your competitors. Worry about yourself. The market's not asking for this right now. The market is asking for lean founders that are able to.
01:10:55.921 - 01:11:00.999, Speaker B: Their data points are from, like, a year ago. Like, a lot of things can change within a year.
01:11:01.177 - 01:11:01.627, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:11:01.691 - 01:11:21.675, Speaker B: And by the way, the fundraise announcement can happen a long time after the actual fundraise happens. So the fundraise itself might have happened much earlier than the announcement itself. So if you use a data point that you see in the public, it might be really, really outdated.
01:11:21.755 - 01:11:40.077, Speaker A: Yeah. And that's, like, one element. But I think that the root of this is don't compare yourself to competitors. Focus on you. I think Peter Thiel, which has been quoted 100 times saying this, like competitions for losers. Right. Worry about your, your product, worry about what you need at your time and focus on growth.
01:11:40.181 - 01:11:46.293, Speaker B: It's definitely, I'm not sure how true it is for large mature companies, but it's definitely 100% true for startups.
01:11:46.349 - 01:11:46.797, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:11:46.901 - 01:11:52.309, Speaker B: Because what's going to kill you is now the competition is that your product size and no one wants your product. Exactly. It is what it is.
01:11:52.357 - 01:12:04.331, Speaker A: And I think Jeff Bezos has said this too, is like, you know, when Barnes and Nobles came, I think there were a team of 30 and Barnes Nobles had, I don't know, a team of 3,000.
01:12:04.443 - 01:12:04.923, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:12:05.019 - 01:12:20.791, Speaker A: Some sort of. And everybody was freaking out like, oh, Barnes and Nobles is going to come and steal our product and our customers. And I think Bezos said, and he was quoted by saying, like, you know, we need to just focus on continue serving our customers. That's it.
01:12:20.923 - 01:12:50.821, Speaker B: And there are so many examples of this in crypto. Two person startups on sitting incumbents and I think Tensor. Tensor, yeah. And I would Bet that in five to 10 years, all the crypto incumbents today will be unseated. None of the. There may be a handful of them that will still be there in five to 10 years, but the vast majority of them will be irrelevant. I'll tell you which ones I think will be here to stay.
01:12:50.893 - 01:12:51.333, Speaker A: Okay.
01:12:51.429 - 01:13:02.557, Speaker B: I think the most likely ones are the ones that are related to security by security, because the Lindy effects, and that is really, really hard to overcome.
01:13:02.621 - 01:13:03.573, Speaker A: Nose to save.
01:13:03.709 - 01:13:04.525, Speaker B: Nose to save.
01:13:04.605 - 01:13:06.877, Speaker A: Like everyone just uses nose to save.
01:13:06.941 - 01:13:24.241, Speaker B: MetaMask, no matter how shit it is, people still use MetaMask. No one has unseated MetaMask because it's lending you trust. MetaMask. Because the single most important thing with wallets, with MetaMask, with gnosis, is the security is nothing else. None of the other stuff.
01:13:24.313 - 01:13:27.657, Speaker A: That's crypto natives though, right? Do you think retail users are coming.
01:13:27.681 - 01:14:04.779, Speaker B: Into the space, they will learn the lesson as they've done with ftx, for example. So if your product is a security related product, there's a huge leaning effect. The longer that you've gone without getting hacked, the more people will trust you. But for every other type of product that we have today, even if it's the likes of Uniswap, no one thinks Uniswap will be dethroned. I think they will in five to 10 years. I shouldn't say they will. It's very likely that someone else comes in and does Something completely different with new enabling technologies.
01:14:04.779 - 01:14:08.507, Speaker B: We don't know what it is, but it's very likely to happen.
01:14:08.611 - 01:14:25.543, Speaker A: This is analogous to search engines. I mean, I thought like, Yahoo was it. I mean, I was like, I know, really young at the time, but I mean, I. Even when Google came, I didn't want to use Google. I'm like, I'm going to use Yahoo. And over time, it was Google and they won.
01:14:25.599 - 01:14:25.887, Speaker C: Right.
01:14:25.951 - 01:14:28.103, Speaker B: Same thing with MySpace and MySpace and.
01:14:28.119 - 01:14:29.879, Speaker A: Friendster and now Facebook.
01:14:29.967 - 01:14:30.687, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:14:30.871 - 01:15:00.145, Speaker B: The thing is, the current crypto market is so small that the number of users, it doesn't matter, is basically zero. So even if you're the front runner, even if you're the incumbent, it doesn't matter at all. As more new users come in, new users can come in at any time and they can grow very quickly within a very short period of time due to whatever reasons. Could be Jerome, it could be some enabling technologies, and things can change very, very quickly. And if you're not careful, you're going to get unseated.
01:15:00.225 - 01:15:08.849, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, even if you told me two years ago, like, you know, all of the startups are now defunct, I've been surprised to hear that. Right?
01:15:08.897 - 01:15:09.129, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:15:09.177 - 01:15:16.817, Speaker A: In a matter of two years, I'd say, like a lot of your trade fi slash startups that were incumbents are gone.
01:15:16.881 - 01:15:17.525, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:15:17.905 - 01:15:20.565, Speaker A: So that only happened in two years. Two years.
01:15:22.025 - 01:15:43.113, Speaker B: So aside from the enabling technologies and the fact that things generally move really fast, another very obvious reason why those incumbents can get unseated is because the founders made it. They made so much money, they don't care about their product anymore. They stop working on it. And if the founders don't stop caring about it, no one, no one else will care.
01:15:43.169 - 01:15:47.753, Speaker A: Well, this brings us to an interesting point, right, With DEFI protocols, specifically because.
01:15:47.769 - 01:15:49.673, Speaker B: I think that a lot of them stopped working on it.
01:15:49.689 - 01:16:24.419, Speaker A: A lot of them worked on it, but they're still like public goods and that's being maintained by the community, which is great, but is that what's supposed to happen? Or like, you know, I don't want to call out names, but let's say Compound and aave, right. They're both working on different startups now. So what's going to happen with AAVE and Compound? Is there going to be someone that's going to care as much as Robert and Stani, that's going to continue innovating, or they're just like, this is the core infrastructure and that's it?
01:16:24.507 - 01:16:25.163, Speaker C: Right.
01:16:25.339 - 01:16:26.187, Speaker A: It's hard to say.
01:16:26.251 - 01:16:26.855, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:16:27.435 - 01:16:29.283, Speaker B: If it's not your baby. You're not going to care about it.
01:16:29.299 - 01:16:32.755, Speaker A: Yeah. And maybe the community will care about.
01:16:32.795 - 01:16:36.035, Speaker B: It, but they care about their tokens.
01:16:36.075 - 01:16:57.127, Speaker A: Tokens, yeah. Price go up. But, you know, like, we tried that with Sushiswap and they failed horribly. Right. Where they left it up to the community to decide whether they should do product fragmentation into different areas or should they focus on one. They chose product fragmentation and everything got fragmented to the point where the price went to, like, nothing. Right.
01:16:57.191 - 01:16:57.647, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:16:57.751 - 01:17:00.207, Speaker A: And the users ended up leaving, went somewhere else.
01:17:00.351 - 01:17:10.475, Speaker B: And a lot of times you think a founder is still working on it, but you don't really know, as no one knows. No one really knows how much they still care and whether or not they're still working on it full time.
01:17:11.055 - 01:17:23.157, Speaker A: So then let's. This brings back to the point of, like, if you look at the traditional markets, you know, you have a startup that, you know a founder that's like, let's say Airbnb and Brian armstrong. Right.
01:17:23.261 - 01:17:25.405, Speaker B: Takes 10 years to actually monetize their work.
01:17:25.485 - 01:17:26.213, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:17:26.389 - 01:17:31.517, Speaker B: In crypto, it takes a token launch, which can happen in less than two years.
01:17:31.621 - 01:17:50.087, Speaker A: Okay. So you have that element. Right. Then you have the element of going public. Then you have the reporting requirements for being a publicly traded company and all the eyes that are on you. Like, imagine Brian Armstrong just stops coming to work and reporting on the quarterly reports. What's going to happen? Right.
01:17:50.087 - 01:17:58.839, Speaker A: We don't have that. And so, I mean, I don't know. I do feel like partly the crypto ecosystem needs to grow up a bit more.
01:17:58.887 - 01:17:59.047, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:17:59.071 - 01:18:12.975, Speaker B: The incentives are really poorly aligned. Investors prefer very quick monetization as well. Most founders do. Very few people actually want to work on something for a very long period of time because it's painful. It's painful and it's too long and too long.
01:18:13.015 - 01:18:34.381, Speaker A: And then people have new attention, like new interests, and then they switch to that. But yeah, it's a bit unfortunate because I do think that these types of products are built. I think the founder should focus on it. That's why of all the founders so far in OG Defy, I respect Kane a lot.
01:18:34.573 - 01:18:38.349, Speaker B: Still working on it. He left and he came back and.
01:18:38.357 - 01:18:43.395, Speaker A: Then he realized that he can't go. He has to come back and focus on the product or he's going to lose.
01:18:43.485 - 01:18:44.159, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:18:44.327 - 01:19:13.789, Speaker A: And so he came back and now like quenta is number two perp in all of DeFi against DYDX. And then you have Lyra, then you have other products that are built within the Synthetix ecosystem. They're doing really well. And so that's a testament to the way he sees it. And I really hope, like founders that are in the space that have products that are being built or have been built, that you take a long term view versus a short term view. Because you could go out and build another product, but like imagine if you spent 10 years on it and you. It becomes a trillion dollar asset class.
01:19:13.789 - 01:19:17.557, Speaker A: Imagine what the value you've created for yourself and for the people that built the product.
01:19:17.661 - 01:19:18.277, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:19:18.421 - 01:19:27.797, Speaker A: Well, this was fun. I feel like we should be doing this more often. I feel like the, you know, like you could always do this on, on Zoom or whatever, but like it feels different in person.
01:19:27.901 - 01:19:29.205, Speaker B: Everything leads to.
01:19:29.365 - 01:19:30.029, Speaker A: In real life.
01:19:30.077 - 01:19:30.653, Speaker B: In real life.
01:19:30.709 - 01:19:35.357, Speaker A: Yeah. So maybe. I think we're gonna be in Berlin in the next couple months, so.
01:19:35.421 - 01:19:35.757, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:19:35.821 - 01:19:36.957, Speaker A: Should do our next one then.
01:19:37.061 - 01:19:37.709, Speaker C: Yeah, we should.
01:19:37.757 - 01:19:46.815, Speaker A: All right, well, thanks for tuning in. Hit subscribe if you haven't and we'll catch you next time. Thanks for listening to Good Game. Don't forget to subscribe. We'll see you next week.
