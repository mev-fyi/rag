00:00:00.400 - 00:00:04.085, Speaker A: Welcome to Goodgame. Your no BS insights for crypto founders.
00:00:07.345 - 00:00:19.057, Speaker B: People in crypto are trading based on a single narrative or a couple of narratives. We had to jump on inscriptions. Otherwise we might have faced disruption by some other startup who jumped on it quicker than us.
00:00:19.161 - 00:00:25.921, Speaker C: I think basically in crypto more so than in web2, you can never rest on your laurels. You really need to like the help.
00:00:26.073 - 00:00:27.419, Speaker A: You guys like.
00:00:27.547 - 00:00:33.775, Speaker C: More paranoid that I would like to be. Yeah, it's easier to say what I don't lose sleep over at this point.
00:00:35.675 - 00:00:37.095, Speaker D: But your girlfriend like that?
00:00:37.515 - 00:00:38.855, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess.
00:00:40.635 - 00:00:49.387, Speaker D: I mean, it's a real problem, right? It's like you're trying to go on a date or something. Like, can I look at the girl? But I think NFT is like market share. It's a problem, man. Yeah, yeah.
00:00:49.451 - 00:00:52.051, Speaker A: I mean we do live in a 247 market.
00:00:52.203 - 00:00:53.615, Speaker D: 24 7.
00:00:54.155 - 00:00:58.775, Speaker A: I wake up crypto. I sleep crypto. Looking for your next startup idea in crypto?
00:00:58.915 - 00:01:00.511, Speaker C: Check out our request for startups list.
00:01:00.543 - 00:01:04.515, Speaker A: And get inspired at Alliance XYZ Ideas.
00:01:05.295 - 00:01:05.735, Speaker C: All right.
00:01:05.775 - 00:01:15.511, Speaker A: Welcome to Goodgame. Today is Valentine's Day. I feel like we're spending some quality time together here. Very cozy over here, especially you guys over there.
00:01:15.663 - 00:01:16.663, Speaker B: I don't know how it's just for.
00:01:16.679 - 00:01:51.635, Speaker A: This, but today's a special episode because we have both the Tensor team and Meow from Jupiter. They came to speak to our founders within the alliance cohort. We're running our program here in New York and we figured why not run a quick podcast session, talk about what's happening on Solana. There's a. I would say many narratives are running place, but I'd love to kind of touch on one, which is points. It seems like people are starting to dislike points or they're just getting overwhelmed with points. Know you.
00:01:51.635 - 00:02:09.979, Speaker A: You start to see startups that don't even have product market fit run points, thinking that they can get their next ten to thousand users. But obviously that's not the case. Having that you've both ran points programs, so I guess, you know, what are your thoughts on. On the points meta now, are you bullish? Bearish? Where do you see it going?
00:02:10.107 - 00:03:03.843, Speaker C: I think points like everything in life has its place and yes, I know that's very deep, very deep. Okay, but in all seriousness, I think if you're pre product market fit and the way you find that out is that you don't have even a small number of users that show up to your product daily and repeatedly, that's really important. I think if you're before product market fit, you shouldn't be thinking about rewards at all. Whether that's points or something else. Once you hit product market fit, rewards is just a way for you to take your product from like a tiny minority of users that discovered it by themselves to a larger kind of subset of users that are almost like incentivized to try it. But there better be a good product underneath for them to stick around, because if there's no product, then they're just going to come and go. And so I think the point of the points is to not think about the points too much.
00:03:03.843 - 00:03:07.867, Speaker C: It's about building the product and then using rewards to drive users to it.
00:03:08.011 - 00:03:59.333, Speaker B: Another practical consideration of points is that there's a lot of flexibility in what you can do with them. As in once you, let's say, give someone points, you at least have some way to modify it. As you sort of experiment with your rewards program, maybe you notice that a lot of people are doing the wrong things or doing unintended things that you didn't want to induce on your product, right? And it gives you the flexibility to change it as you go. At least for us, right? We had multiple seasons and we basically had to revamp the entire point system every single season just because we saw some of the negative externalities of the way that we formulated the initial points formula that we learned from and adapted in subsequent seasons. And that's like a very powerful optionality you get as a founder for using.
00:03:59.389 - 00:04:05.261, Speaker E: Points as opposed to tokens, right? Because tokens are much harder to change in terms of token economics.
00:04:05.333 - 00:04:08.021, Speaker B: It's almost like a benefit that they're non transferable, right?
00:04:08.093 - 00:04:08.705, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:04:09.245 - 00:04:10.625, Speaker A: And you can't get rugged.
00:04:11.365 - 00:04:12.005, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:04:12.085 - 00:04:12.757, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:04:12.941 - 00:05:00.353, Speaker D: I feel like tokens points are interesting because tokens are in some sense very definitive, right? It's like once the token is out there, it's out there, right? Whereas for points, as you said I mentioned earlier, there are many ways you can actually change it, adapt it. I guess from a user point of view, the frustration becomes like, okay, I do all these things, but I don't know how much I'm getting, right? And actually there are many to go by it, right? It's like you can have a point system or you can have a point system that denotes a certain percentage in the protocol or certain point system for certain end time. So I feel like a big part of it is like, how do you manage attention, right? Because if you don't promise anything, right? I think of two extremes, right? One extreme says, okay, you don't know how much you're getting. You don't know what's ending, you don't know what's the cap. Right. The other version is. Okay, you know exactly how much you're getting.
00:05:00.353 - 00:05:14.283, Speaker D: Right. So one point goes to one token. Almost. Right. So you know, exactly. So I feel like there's no good answer here, but I think communication, Yeah. I feel like the main thing is that combined with what he was saying, Right.
00:05:14.283 - 00:05:28.851, Speaker D: Elo was saying, is that I think, can you communicate early on and set expectations and slowly converge into a more concrete thing? Right. So I feel like that expectation and that convergence is very important, if you ask me. Right. Yeah.
00:05:28.923 - 00:06:00.521, Speaker A: I think what's driving obviously the points meta is the regulatory arbitrage. Right. Which is, at least in the US and certain parts of the world, you can just airdrop tokens to their users. So this is a way to at least save some time so that products startups can kind of think about what their regulatory strategy is when they're airdropping tokens. And I think that's kind of the fundamental, like, narrative for founders. But I also think it's a great way to gamify your experience and attract new users. So I do think there's an opportunity to, like, gamify, keep people engaged and things like that.
00:06:00.593 - 00:06:08.259, Speaker E: So do you guys feel the. The points matter is here to stay? Let's say six to 12 months from now, or is it being played out?
00:06:08.347 - 00:06:38.007, Speaker C: I think six to 12 months, maybe. I do think that two years from now, probably not, because there's like, levels of tiredness and I think we're kind of itching into the lost quartile of tiredness, where it's like, okay, like it's getting a little tiresome. And honestly, if I was starting a new product right now, I wouldn't do points, I would do something else. Just find a creative. What would you do? I know, leaderboards, badges, NFTs, like, NFTs that morph, NFTs that change. I think NFTs is this form factor that is infinitely flexible.
00:06:38.111 - 00:06:38.751, Speaker A: Dynamic.
00:06:38.863 - 00:06:48.471, Speaker C: Yeah, like dynamic stuff. Right. Just find interesting things. NFTs that level themselves up. I don't know, like, do something different. Do something that people are going to talk about on ct.
00:06:48.583 - 00:07:05.107, Speaker A: I think that's how you win Tushar from multicoin. I think he tweeted about this. He wrote an article about this, which is back in our day, you could mine bitcoin to get bitcoin, right? And then that was like the fundraising landscape. Then the second phase was ICOs.
00:07:05.251 - 00:07:05.555, Speaker D: Right.
00:07:05.595 - 00:07:23.429, Speaker A: And that speculative mania, then the next phase was NFTs, like buying NFTs early. Now he says it's points. So it could very well be that the meta that you mentioned could change into something more gamified. We just don't know what that is exactly. But I'm sure there's someone that's going to be cracking that could crack that.
00:07:23.477 - 00:07:24.629, Speaker B: I'm going to take the other side.
00:07:24.717 - 00:07:25.029, Speaker A: Okay.
00:07:25.077 - 00:08:09.355, Speaker B: I think if you have a good product and you just want some reward structure to maximize growth or to increase the rate of growth, I think points are perfectly fine. Because if people are using your product because there's product market fit and it's intrinsically useful, it doesn't matter what kind of weird gamification convoluted setup that you can give them points are, I think fine. However, if you're a new startup that hasn't really reached product market fit and you just want to make a big splash with something like novel, something unique, and you want to also drive a bunch of distribution that you don't already have, then yes, you'll have to think of something else besides points.
00:08:10.295 - 00:08:24.059, Speaker D: I think it's all going to be there. I think if you look at incentives in crypto, it never goes away. Every single incentive happened in the past. Still in the future it just runs more. More interesting and more fancy and more diversified. Right. And that's great, I think, you know.
00:08:24.059 - 00:08:24.571, Speaker D: Right. Yeah.
00:08:24.603 - 00:08:26.495, Speaker A: So we'll see everything. Yeah, I mean, we'll see everything.
00:08:27.835 - 00:08:38.307, Speaker D: And even the product market fit thing. Right. Sometimes you don't even need product market fit. Right. We all know projects that just launch a. No, no. Or even a, like a replica of a different project.
00:08:38.307 - 00:08:44.875, Speaker D: Right. And then just oh, hey, we have points or we have tokens or something, you know. Right. We see that all the time. Right. A new L2, a new NFT marketplace. Right.
00:08:44.915 - 00:09:03.015, Speaker C: I feel that never goes well. I feel that never goes well though. Like if somebody launches a pure replica with a token versus something that doesn't have a token. Like to me a great example is looks rare, copy paste open C slap on a token went to zero because it didn't try to do anything new versus Blur and us that actually tried like a different form factor.
00:09:03.435 - 00:09:05.331, Speaker A: So yeah, sushi shop did it pretty well.
00:09:05.363 - 00:09:08.395, Speaker C: I feel like, well, where's sushi now though? Where's sushi now?
00:09:08.435 - 00:09:10.923, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean they have like maybe 10% market share.
00:09:10.979 - 00:09:35.505, Speaker E: I look at the history of all copy pasta in the history of crypto, only one worked and that was Monero. So Monero is actually not the original. There was a. Monero is actually a fork of another project that. And this was like, back in 2013 or something. Monero is the only copy pasta, the only fork that turns out to be the winner. Everything else that forked a previous project has failed.
00:09:36.325 - 00:09:49.559, Speaker B: I think if you copy pasta and then you just iterate on new things really quickly, that could also turn out to be a good outcome. But I think maybe the SushiSwap example is bad because I feel like execution was also not as great as Uniswap.
00:09:49.607 - 00:09:50.395, Speaker A: Yeah, Sushi.
00:09:50.775 - 00:09:59.447, Speaker B: Yeah. And so they didn't take advantage of all the momentum they got initially. They just kind of like, oh, cool, now we're like 50% market share. And they just sat in their hands.
00:09:59.471 - 00:10:00.755, Speaker A: They got too decentralized.
00:10:01.255 - 00:10:01.919, Speaker E: Too many products.
00:10:01.967 - 00:10:02.915, Speaker A: Too many products.
00:10:03.655 - 00:10:07.879, Speaker E: Their front end had like 10 different products you can choose. Whereas Uniswap is super clean.
00:10:07.967 - 00:10:10.075, Speaker A: They kept it the same. They never really changed it.
00:10:10.625 - 00:10:36.053, Speaker C: So that actually goes to something that I feel you start to understand the more time you spend in crypto, and that is the importance of narratives and the importance of keeping them very clean and simple. As a founder, you basically want your product and your company to have one narrative and one narrative only. It's also the hardest thing to do because you can only pick one. You can't do seven narratives. But the founders that do that, I think do really well.
00:10:36.129 - 00:10:40.105, Speaker E: Wouldn't meow, take the other side of this, because you're launching many products.
00:10:40.965 - 00:10:46.909, Speaker D: The best on chain exchange. The narrative is the best on chain exchange. That's it.
00:10:46.957 - 00:10:50.093, Speaker E: But for Spot and derivatives and Launchpad.
00:10:50.229 - 00:10:50.597, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:10:50.661 - 00:10:52.265, Speaker A: All unchained binance.
00:10:54.845 - 00:10:57.685, Speaker C: So typically, this is not products, this is narratives.
00:10:57.725 - 00:10:58.141, Speaker D: Right.
00:10:58.253 - 00:11:04.605, Speaker C: You want one narrative, like for densers, like the liquidity layer for NFTs. That's all we're doing. That's the only thing we're doing.
00:11:04.645 - 00:11:31.177, Speaker A: You know, I realized with SushiSwap, the reason why I think they failed was the fact that they didn't think from first principles. Right. They copied someone else's vision. And then they kind of put in their own way that they thought that the product should go, and it obviously fell flat. So copying some, like another product, fine. But really, you got to find the inspiration of understanding what your users want. And you could only do that by building the actual product first, for the most part, actually.
00:11:31.241 - 00:11:44.751, Speaker D: Just let me share something here real quick. Right. It's the idea of synergy. Is that for us anyway, Right. I think the reason why I think we did well is that it's too early tell so far. Okay? So far it's not too bad. No, no, no, no.
00:11:44.751 - 00:12:21.915, Speaker D: So far it's not too bad. I think the key idea here, right, Is that synergy, right? It's like, for example, if you went off to do something like a completely different. I can't tell you why, right? But when the user comes to Jupiter, right, You know, what else is he going to do, right? What else he's going to be interested in, right? Is he going to be interested in sport in dca? Is he going in pubs? Is he going to be interested in new projects that are forming? I think yes. So that's actually a very. So I think a few things, right? First of all, it's narrative. I think it's really, really important to have one narrative. And for us, it's okay, can we build the best on chain exchange possible? Simple, sharp, to the point.
00:12:21.915 - 00:13:27.843, Speaker D: And the second thing that we really care about is synergy, okay? Hey, when a user comes in, right? Would they find everything interesting, right? You know, anything, Anything that we don't think interesting is no go for us, right? And thirdly is also team strength, right? You know, like, because again, I'm telling you guys, like, building is easy. I'm telling you, like, just building new stuff is easy, right? Coding is very easy, right? But building, like real competencies is very hard, right? Like every single product we built and stuff. Oh, my God. I'm telling you, like, to get there was really tough, right? So I think a big part is, okay, if we do this thing, does it leverage on the competencies that we have, right? And secondly, is, okay, is this competency important to us in the future, right? And it can be very trivial things like Cloudflare, you know, or like RPCs. How do you handle many RPC and stuff, right? So I think, like, for example, we did Launchpad, right? Man telling you there was a big decision, right? Instead of launching Duke, we had to build Launchpad. Yeah, But I think. But I think part of at least, at least a big part of like what drives the decision was, okay, are the lessons that we learned from doing it.
00:13:27.843 - 00:13:32.147, Speaker D: It's going to be good for us or not, right? You know, are we. We're going to have to massively scale our.
00:13:32.291 - 00:13:33.411, Speaker A: It's like a record launch, right?
00:13:33.443 - 00:13:52.027, Speaker D: Yeah, precisely, right? It's like how. And is it gonna kind of add an interesting dynamic to our community, right? You know, so I. So I feel like. Yeah, so that's how I think about it, right? It's like it's in terms of like very synergistic narrative. Synergistic to users and synergistic to kind of like the team competence. Yeah.
00:13:52.211 - 00:13:59.971, Speaker B: Add on to that. The way I think about it is I think like startups and like working on products is a market in itself.
00:14:00.083 - 00:14:00.419, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:14:00.467 - 00:14:11.907, Speaker B: And if you believe in the efficient market hypothesis, there's probably a better team out there who can do something better like some other like unrelated product, orthogonal product to your product if there's no synergy.
00:14:12.051 - 00:14:12.659, Speaker D: Right, yeah.
00:14:12.707 - 00:14:19.303, Speaker B: So for us, hypothetically, let's say we decided to build some sort of token experience. Right? Go head on with Mail and Jupiter.
00:14:19.359 - 00:14:20.315, Speaker D: No, no, no, no.
00:14:21.615 - 00:14:23.155, Speaker C: Stop leaking the plans.
00:14:24.815 - 00:14:39.463, Speaker B: Yeah. Like, yes, we could maybe capture this massive market, which is fungible tokens on Solana. But now we're going up against Meow and his competent team who has been thinking about this market, thinking about the products around it for more time than we've spent working on Tencent.
00:14:39.519 - 00:14:41.415, Speaker A: Sorry, you think about SPL22s?
00:14:41.535 - 00:15:07.715, Speaker D: Oh, that's interesting actually to add on to that point. Right. It's like I think, I think anyone who is new to crypto, they will think of product as code and UX or maybe markets. Right. But the truth is that there's a huge component around ecosystem and community. It might surprise you, but the DEFI community and the NFT community are very different. They are in the same ecosystem.
00:15:07.715 - 00:15:19.275, Speaker D: They kind of sort of talk in CT at the same time, but they're very, very different. Right. So it's like even if you really kind of understand like DeFi, you don't understand NFTs and vice versa. Right. You know, it's actually really interesting, very.
00:15:19.315 - 00:15:45.229, Speaker E: Speculative by the way, at that point, like about communities. We had this conversation maybe two years ago, one or two years ago, about NFT options or NFT perps. And the argument we had was if you draw the diagram of DEFI and NFT people, the intersection is probably too small for a product like this to thrive. But now things might have changed a little bit. Maybe there's greater intersection. You guys launched a.
00:15:45.317 - 00:16:25.451, Speaker B: Basically it's different now. So we launched a different type of product on top of NFTs and that's price lock. Long story short is you can long and short NFTs given a certain period of time. Right. Within a certain period of time. What's interesting is that we're not trying to appeal to the DEFI folks where uses this concept of like longing and shorting like a token or something. We're actually trying to Appeal to the NFT crowd who basically have voiced, you know, in user feedback sessions that they just want to like be able to ape into mad lads or Tensorians with just like 2 soul, 3 soul, basically a fraction of what mad lads and cost.
00:16:25.451 - 00:16:37.739, Speaker B: Or they might want to like hedge out their portfolio where they have like 100 mad lads and they know that perhaps there's an announcement coming up and they want to hedge their downside exposure. Right, so we're still appealing to the NFT crowd. It's not really the defi crowd at all.
00:16:37.787 - 00:16:40.611, Speaker A: So you're building tool sets for NFT traders.
00:16:40.723 - 00:16:41.979, Speaker B: Exactly, yeah.
00:16:42.147 - 00:16:42.499, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:16:42.547 - 00:17:20.863, Speaker C: I think your point about competencies is spot on. It's very easy to look at a wallet or to look at a perp exchange or to look at an NFT marketplace and to say, hey, how hard is that to build? It's like, you know, it's like two days of work. And then what you discover is that, yeah, it's two days of work to ship the basic most version of that. But then there's a long tail of shit that you have to deal with of like all kinds of issues that you just, you could not have thought about. And the teams like Jupiter, teams like ours, you know, like backpack, that are building the wallet, they've gone through that, they've built all of that and that is like super valuable.
00:17:21.039 - 00:18:02.483, Speaker D: It's like the number of things go wrong. Insane, Insane. Insane. And one thing that I really care about is customer service, right? You know, because it's all about customers. All about customer service. It's like, it's funny, right, because like what you read and what you can think of is the top end of the tail, right? You know, the fat tail, right? You know, right? But the many, the endless number of things that your users deal with, right, Is the long tail, right? And you know, it's like. And you really need to tackle a big part of the tail, right? You can just leave them alone, right? So I feel like, I actually feel like great teams, including like Tensor and also Backpack and also like pretty much all the OG teams like Kamino, I won right margin, everyone.
00:18:02.483 - 00:18:38.245, Speaker D: It's like these are all teams that have spent the last two years, bear market last two years, right? Really dealing with their long tail shit, right? You know, even when it wasn't quote unquote economically wise, right? And I love that. Guys, isn't it great? Isn't it great that like, I mean, obviously we have a lot of competition and everything, right? But we are as a community, right? It's like, we dealt with it, right, in the last two years when everyone was like, hey, get off this shit. You know, child is great. Child is great. Talk about that. But I think. But, but we, we just like, you know, work through all the issues, right? You know, even when it was like the long tail issues.
00:18:38.245 - 00:18:39.605, Speaker D: Right. You know, even when it was like.
00:18:39.645 - 00:18:42.701, Speaker C: Economically unfeasible, sometimes you're solving issues for like three users.
00:18:42.773 - 00:18:45.109, Speaker D: Precisely. People don't know that it's so important.
00:18:45.157 - 00:18:49.897, Speaker C: People don't know that it kind of sucks you do it. The number of times we had to fix something for like one guy in.
00:18:49.921 - 00:19:18.511, Speaker B: Discord, it's like the devil's devil in the details. Where the analogy is you can either use an Apple product or you can use like a knockoff copycat Apple product from like China, right? Yes. They're practically speaking almost the same products. But you're not going to get Apple care. You're not going to be able to walk into a store and get your knockoff fixed. You're not going to be able to connect it seamlessly with your iPhone. And like, yes, you get 90% of the experience, but it's really that 10% that people are paying a premium for.
00:19:18.583 - 00:19:28.991, Speaker D: And you. And when you scroll, there's something that's a big deal because when you scroll, you scroll like 90% of the time, right. And it just like tiny twitch things. We get to you.
00:19:29.063 - 00:19:37.463, Speaker A: But if it wasn't for them, you know, you wouldn't have a product that's like pristine now at this point. Right. It's like the early days, the feedback that helps you guys to where you are today.
00:19:37.519 - 00:19:45.711, Speaker D: I can't emphasize this more, man. I feel like. I really feel you, man. It's like that, like, it's like that one user and not just like, guys, I think one.
00:19:45.783 - 00:19:47.151, Speaker A: It's like that one anal user.
00:19:47.223 - 00:20:03.303, Speaker D: No, no. It's actually really important. Let me share something here, right? It's like to all the builders here, right? Anyone? Right? It's like all the users as well, right. It's like the things that sometimes when you cater to that one user, right. You learn something like, oh, wow, I didn't know that shit broke this way. Right. It really helps you later.
00:20:03.303 - 00:20:08.547, Speaker D: Right? You know? Right. So I feel like, I think one thing that we do a lot of is that we just really care about that one user.
00:20:08.611 - 00:20:08.851, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:20:08.883 - 00:20:10.931, Speaker D: You know? Right. Just really care about that stuff, you know? Yeah.
00:20:10.963 - 00:20:17.035, Speaker E: And it helps much better to have 100 users that love you than 10,000 users that kind of like, you yeah.
00:20:17.075 - 00:20:25.683, Speaker D: You know, and I feel like the way you get to. And remember, like for the last two years, Solana didn't have many users, you know. Right. So we had no choice but to get 100.
00:20:25.779 - 00:20:27.855, Speaker A: Yeah, all the hundred.
00:20:28.395 - 00:20:33.135, Speaker D: There were no thousand, just hundred. Yeah, precisely. Yeah.
00:20:33.595 - 00:20:59.723, Speaker A: So we talked about how, at least before Defi, NFT communities were separate. Right. And then you're building tool sets that enable NFT traders to make better decisions. What do you guys think about these two new standards that just came about? One is in the Ethereum role or the EVM role. That's the ERC404 or 404 DN404. On the Solana side you have SPL22.
00:20:59.779 - 00:21:00.241, Speaker D: Right.
00:21:00.363 - 00:21:23.469, Speaker A: With Ghost and a couple other launches. So to me it seems like they're kind of being blended. Right. And so some of the startups, like Wasabi on Ethereum, they're building more defi like products on top of the fractional token model for these NFT communities. So do you feel like these new standards are novel? Are they here to stay? And what types of products do you see being built because of that?
00:21:23.557 - 00:22:10.511, Speaker B: So kind of speak from basically the mind maze or idea maze that we went through when thinking about how do we make trading NFTs more efficient? And I'll give you a very concrete example. We wanted initially to build an order book for NFTs on Solana. TLDR is we looked at Phoenix, we looked at Serum and we basically, you could do it in a way that is somewhat user friendly, but not fully user friendly. But there's a lot of trade offs in that. Like if people start spamming your order book with just like a bunch of NFT orders, eventually you'll get filled out and you'll run into a lot of issues. At least in my mind. The only way to solve it was to basically fractionalize NFTs.
00:22:10.511 - 00:23:08.317, Speaker B: But there are a lot of downsides of fractionalizing NFTs if they're not natively, you know, in this ERC 404 or SPL 22 on Solana, the downside is there's this decoupling between the NFT and the tokens and it's entirely managed by, let's say, a different protocol. So it's not even like the collection never decided to opt into it. It's being fractionalized by some other protocol that builds fractionalization. But the benefit of these new standards is someone can opt in and decide on day one that we want this collection to trade as both fungible tokens and NFTs. And what's interesting, at least for us, is maybe we can start to build an order book for NFTs. And what's interesting about an order book for NFTs is you don't get this terrible UX where if you're trying to sweep a bunch of NFTs at the floor, you just get a bunch of failures because there's no on chain matching engine. That's still an issue we're struggling with.
00:23:08.317 - 00:23:11.493, Speaker B: So potentially this could be an interesting way around that.
00:23:11.669 - 00:23:53.525, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's definitely an interesting new form factor. The one thing I will say is I tend to believe in simplicity and I think the markets that end up being the largest in the world are the simplest markets. So to me that is still the two extremes of it's non fungible or it's fungible. I think those two markets are going to be by far the largest. Now is there a really interesting market in the middle that is starting to form and are there going to be really interesting new use cases that we discovered this year? Yeah, absolutely. And I think Tensor is there to experiment and try and discover them. But I think like 10 years from now I still think the barbell of fungible, non fungible is going to be the largest markets.
00:23:53.945 - 00:24:08.577, Speaker D: Sometimes the meter can be really big, right? Like yu tokens. It's like panda, right? Yeah. I mean panda is interesting because they take a token and they take staking and they say okay, can we take the u of it? Can we tokenize the U of that? Right.
00:24:08.601 - 00:24:10.513, Speaker A: You know, so appendle token, right?
00:24:10.609 - 00:24:28.657, Speaker D: Yeah, everything. Right. So it's like can you create amms or markers of this U? Right. So I feel like sometimes I agree with you, by the way. I think that the biggest one is still going to be fungible and non fungible. Right? But I think if those two become big enough, right then in a meter then interesting things happen, you know?
00:24:28.721 - 00:24:56.077, Speaker E: Yeah, there is a meta point about this which is I know a lot of some of the best founders that we work with See 404 as an opportunity to take advantage of and possibly dethrone the bigger players. And in crypto or just maybe in tech in general, there's constantly these new things that just pop up out of nowhere that create opportunities for founders to take advantage of.
00:24:56.221 - 00:24:56.885, Speaker D: Right.
00:24:57.045 - 00:25:09.583, Speaker E: In your experience just building the last three years, have you observed such new things that come out of nowhere that people have taken advantage of or you personally have taken advantage of?
00:25:09.719 - 00:25:50.615, Speaker B: Yeah, this is. So we talked about this during the Talk. Right. Finding your wedge as a startup who doesn't already have overwhelming market share in your category, you have to find something that is differentiated, that is so different, that the incumbents are not doing for us. We've actually encountered this a couple of times on solana, just with NFTs themselves, and those are like new standards or even like inscriptions on Solana. So, you know, taking a step back, there was basically a whole movement of taking the idea of inscriptions and ordinals from Bitcoin and copy pasting it to every other chain. Makes no sense intuitively, like, why someone would do inscriptions on Solana.
00:25:50.615 - 00:26:13.421, Speaker B: Because it's not like on Bitcoin, it's the only way to do NFTs. On Solana, it's not the only way to do NFTs. You can do it much more efficiently. That being said, people latch onto that narrative. So going back to the idea that people in crypto are trading based on a single narrative or a couple of narratives, we had to jump on inscriptions. Otherwise we might have faced disruption by some other startup who jumped on it quicker than us.
00:26:13.533 - 00:26:19.405, Speaker C: I think basically in crypto, more so than in web2, you can never rest on your laurels. You really need to.
00:26:19.445 - 00:26:22.141, Speaker A: Like how parents Are you guys more.
00:26:22.173 - 00:26:28.135, Speaker C: Paranoid that I would like to be? Yeah. It's easier to say what I don't lose sleep over at this point.
00:26:29.995 - 00:26:31.415, Speaker D: But your girlfriend like that?
00:26:31.835 - 00:26:33.215, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess.
00:26:34.995 - 00:26:43.747, Speaker D: I mean, it's a real problem, right? You try to go on a date or something where you look at a girl. But I think NFT is like, market share. It's a problem, man. Yeah, Yeah.
00:26:43.811 - 00:26:46.387, Speaker A: I mean, we do live in a 247 market.
00:26:46.531 - 00:26:47.935, Speaker D: 24 7.
00:26:48.475 - 00:26:50.975, Speaker A: I wake up crypto. I sleep crypto.
00:26:51.275 - 00:26:57.947, Speaker D: My biggest moment for me when I realized that crypto doesn't sleep, was the one inch I dropped and stuff, like, in Christmas, like, two weeks back.
00:26:58.051 - 00:26:58.563, Speaker A: Oh, that's right.
00:26:58.579 - 00:27:02.575, Speaker D: Yeah. That was, like, funny. I was like, yeah, the Christmas. Yay, Brick. What the fuck?
00:27:03.515 - 00:27:05.131, Speaker C: Or the D Gods last Christmas.
00:27:05.163 - 00:27:05.307, Speaker E: Right.
00:27:05.331 - 00:27:08.467, Speaker C: Do you remember that the D Gods transitioned to a different chain that took over ct?
00:27:08.571 - 00:27:09.955, Speaker E: Yeah, that was the bottom.
00:27:10.035 - 00:27:10.995, Speaker C: That was the bottom.
00:27:11.155 - 00:27:13.635, Speaker A: That was on the bottom. Oh, my God.
00:27:13.675 - 00:27:16.259, Speaker D: Such a great bottom, though. Yeah, that's so much.
00:27:16.307 - 00:27:33.639, Speaker A: Well, I mean, he's permanently D Gods. Frank is permanently like. Like, it's really hard for him to come back to Solana, it seems. I heard he's trying to come back. I don't know. Thanks for listening to Goodgame. We wanted to take a quick moment for a short New segment, Crypto Startup Stories, where we spotlight founders who went through the alliance accelerator.
00:27:33.639 - 00:27:44.671, Speaker A: Today we're focusing on startups shaping the Solana ecosystem, like Jupiter and Tensor. So, without further ado, let's hear from Daniel Garay, the founder of Flexland. Daniel, what are you building?
00:27:44.783 - 00:27:59.383, Speaker F: We're building Flexland. It's a tool to make DEFI much easier and less time consuming for people. Essentially, we've aggregated all the lending apps on Solana and allow you to lend from one place. We're going to move your funds around so that you're always earning as much as you can.
00:27:59.479 - 00:28:02.407, Speaker A: Great. How did you come up with the idea?
00:28:02.511 - 00:28:22.519, Speaker F: User feedback. So we had originally started building a different product called Lulo. That one didn't go as great as we wanted, but it did generate a lot of feedback and a lot of touchpoints with people. And slowly we collected a lot of feedback, we saw a lot of patterns, and that's how Flexlim was born. It's essentially a product built 100% based off user feedback.
00:28:22.647 - 00:28:26.447, Speaker A: Did you reach out to the customers to get feedback? What was the process like?
00:28:26.551 - 00:28:53.129, Speaker F: So early on we use the communities my founder, my co founder and I were part of. So, you know, I would reach out to every community I was part of, an NFT group, a trading group, DEFI group, and try to get two or three people from each group to try out the product and become early users. And that's kind of how we got our first, like 50 people to try it out. And from there you kind of see what groups they're part of and try to go deeper into those groups. And that's kind of how we did it. Spiderweb style.
00:28:53.257 - 00:28:56.961, Speaker A: What's one piece of advice that you give to founders that are building this space?
00:28:57.073 - 00:29:39.839, Speaker F: Yeah, I'd say don't forget to live. It sounds a little like cliche, but I think I see personally as a founder, like a lot of hustle content that's maybe targeted to me and I don't really agree with it. I think it's important to take care of your body, it's important to take care of your mind, it's important to have hobbies, it's important to develop yourself as a person because you know you're going to be working on this for five years or more. So regardless if it succeeds or if it fails, if you're not enjoying the time, if you don't come out of it as a better person holistically, then I think it's a losing proposition. So I don't really Think sitting at the computer 16 hours a day is the way to go about it. I think you need to carve out time for, for other activities and other things and to take care of yourself.
00:29:40.007 - 00:30:13.191, Speaker A: In terms of flexlant, how is the momentum going? You got the feedback with Lulo and then you built an aggregator. You talked to customers, you did the spiderweb effect of getting users to give you feedback. You use that feedback as a way to enhance your product, which is Flexland. Now you're an aggregator and you're aggregating lending across all of Solana Defi. And I guess how has the usage been and maybe if you could describe in one or two sentences of the value proposition of flexlan and why people should use it.
00:30:13.303 - 00:30:50.941, Speaker F: You know, I used to think user feedback was a part of early stage startups. I now think it is the only thing that matters because at the beginning you should be just optimizing for generating feedback as much as you can. And once you build something people actually want, which is based on feedback, growth is not easy, but it's much easier. So Flexone has definitely grown a lot faster than Lulo has. We get a lot more positive feedback, we get a lot more like organic usage and people like really like feeling like they're solving an issue when they use it. So that's really exciting to see. I think the growth confirms you don't actually know what you should build just based on instinct.
00:30:50.941 - 00:31:12.155, Speaker F: You really have to listen to people. It's the only way to do it right. So I think from here it's, you know, there's more product market fit. So now the user feedback also becomes more focused on the product and like how to make it better rather than like being very sporadic, which is kind of how it feels when you don't have product market fit. The feedback is from all over the place. And so the quality of feedback also changes as you get closer to something people want.
00:31:12.535 - 00:31:14.595, Speaker A: And why should people use FlexLend today?
00:31:15.375 - 00:31:26.553, Speaker F: If you don't want to spend hours a day optimizing your lending and you want to earn really, really good rates on USDC specifically and stablecoins, then Flexlin's definitely the product for you.
00:31:26.649 - 00:31:28.617, Speaker A: Great. Daniel, thank you so much for your time.
00:31:28.721 - 00:31:30.245, Speaker F: Yeah, thank you, Imran.
00:31:33.945 - 00:31:41.313, Speaker A: So, you know, SPL22 was an interesting kind of like wedge that we're seeing and we'll see what types of products are being built.
00:31:41.489 - 00:31:51.291, Speaker D: But the actually, sorry, can I just real quick. It's like, I mean, I don't know, Frank, but I'm just Amazed at the community he has built. Right.
00:31:51.323 - 00:31:52.335, Speaker A: He has a good community.
00:31:52.795 - 00:32:03.683, Speaker C: I actually don't think Frank is a bad guy. I think people overdo it. I think he tried some shit, he learned some shit and some things worked. Something didn't. Did he make a bunch of mistakes? Maybe. I don't know. I still think, yeah, I think the.
00:32:03.699 - 00:32:23.467, Speaker B: Meta point is maybe it's because everything is so. Everyone in crypto. Twitter is so connected and so there's this like, like, like these extreme feedback loops where people just like pile on people. Because it's fun too. And it's entertainment and competition also. Right, right, exactly. Like everyone is just talking.
00:32:23.467 - 00:32:31.963, Speaker B: Like competition is talking to each other at light speed. And I think like in crypto, like, realistically, all of these projects, these NFT founders, they're basically doing startups.
00:32:32.059 - 00:32:32.435, Speaker C: They are.
00:32:32.475 - 00:32:54.411, Speaker B: And if you take like web two startup metrics, 90% of these guys will fail just by statistics. Right? But CT expects everyone to execute perfectly and to not make any mistakes, which is not the case if you're trying to build something innovative, if you're trying to start this brand new Web3 community, you're going to make a ton of mistakes along the way. And you can't fault a guy for ending up deciding to take this path, which turned out to be wrong.
00:32:54.523 - 00:33:04.895, Speaker A: To be quite frank, I don't think any NFT community has actually found product market fit yet. Except for pudgy penguins, which is. They're coming very close. They're coming very close.
00:33:04.935 - 00:33:08.287, Speaker C: But like, if Budget Orient. That's the real question.
00:33:08.471 - 00:33:09.755, Speaker B: Hit us up. Lucas.
00:33:10.535 - 00:33:12.031, Speaker E: Lucas will be on our podcast.
00:33:12.143 - 00:33:13.135, Speaker A: He'll be on our podcast.
00:33:13.215 - 00:33:14.023, Speaker D: Okay, nice.
00:33:14.119 - 00:33:16.395, Speaker C: When Jupiter NFTs, that's what we want.
00:33:17.055 - 00:33:22.407, Speaker D: Dude, it's crazy. It's like I just say something. I tweeted like, I tweeted like, hey, the Dow, the dao.
00:33:22.471 - 00:33:23.391, Speaker A: Oh, I remember this.
00:33:23.423 - 00:33:31.207, Speaker D: I tweeted the DAO can consider funding NFTs. And then, oh my God, it became big news. Oh, Jupiter is doing NFTs.
00:33:31.231 - 00:33:33.031, Speaker C: We're in your DMs, like, so when are we doing this?
00:33:33.063 - 00:33:46.929, Speaker D: Yeah, I'm not kidding. So many people DM me after that, right? I was like, no, I didn't say we're doing NFTs. I said that Dao should consider funding NFTs for fun community project. That, honestly, that moment was a come to Jesus moment for me. I'm like, okay, wow, I really gotta be careful.
00:33:46.977 - 00:33:47.845, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:33:48.225 - 00:33:49.849, Speaker A: You are a public figure now.
00:33:49.937 - 00:34:00.347, Speaker D: No, no, dude. You know, it's funny because I'M so used to talking. Right. Yeah. No, seriously, I was so talking. Right. I'm so used to like, just like, oh, no, man, doesn't.
00:34:00.347 - 00:34:11.823, Speaker D: Yeah, but, yeah, but that was interesting because, like, I tweeted that I went to. And I tweeted that I went to sleep. Right. You know what I'm saying? And then the next morning, I bombarded. I'm like, oh, my God. Everyone's like, you know what I mean? Yeah.
00:34:11.999 - 00:34:15.239, Speaker E: These days your tweets get like easily 5000 likes.
00:34:15.327 - 00:34:15.823, Speaker D: No, I don't.
00:34:15.879 - 00:34:17.311, Speaker B: I am very impressed by your engagement.
00:34:17.383 - 00:34:17.751, Speaker D: Sorry?
00:34:17.823 - 00:34:19.575, Speaker B: I am very impressed by your engagement.
00:34:19.695 - 00:34:21.195, Speaker A: He attracts all the cats.
00:34:24.935 - 00:34:31.912, Speaker D: Let's just say that it has been a really big lesson for me recently, but it's how to engage here, you.
00:34:31.928 - 00:34:33.600, Speaker A: Know, I want to go back to the nft.
00:34:33.712 - 00:34:45.792, Speaker D: Sorry, just one last thing real quick. I just want to say that I think I feel like I'm actually pretty impressed by the. Frank's community. Dgo's community. I'm sure you guys, as well as. It's incredibly resilient. Right.
00:34:45.792 - 00:34:51.680, Speaker D: And Frank did reach out to me recently, you know. Nice. Yeah. And then just say hi. Right. And I think, yeah, I feel like.
00:34:51.712 - 00:34:52.838, Speaker A: He could have easily walked away.
00:34:52.936 - 00:35:03.694, Speaker D: Yeah, I walked away. Yeah. I think, I think he's still in the game. He's trying to. I think the tribalism of crypto got to him. You know, I don't think he. I'm not sure, but I think he probably.
00:35:03.694 - 00:35:08.514, Speaker D: He probably didn't. It's a good topic as well, the tribalism. Right. You know, crypto and stuff.
00:35:08.554 - 00:35:08.866, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:35:08.930 - 00:35:17.586, Speaker D: You know, yeah. But in summary, I don't, I don't drag this topic on. But just don't say that. Like, you know, I feel like, you know, I feel like we should all be understanding and stuff. Yeah.
00:35:17.610 - 00:35:21.383, Speaker A: We should be less harsh on. On Frank, at least on the salon side.
00:35:21.399 - 00:35:23.471, Speaker E: We should be less harsh on founders in general.
00:35:23.503 - 00:35:25.855, Speaker A: And founders in general 100% agreed.
00:35:26.015 - 00:35:40.031, Speaker E: I mean, founders just get a lot of shit all the time on Twitter. All the time. Like, even if they do something good, well intentioned, they're human and successful. Like your airdrop. It was very successful in my mind. And people just anyone who didn't get airdrop or missed out on Drupal.
00:35:40.063 - 00:35:40.279, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:35:40.327 - 00:35:40.919, Speaker A: And they're coping.
00:35:40.967 - 00:35:44.551, Speaker E: Yeah, they're coping. And now imagine eth maxes are coping too.
00:35:44.583 - 00:35:44.823, Speaker A: Right.
00:35:44.879 - 00:35:45.143, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:35:45.199 - 00:36:03.135, Speaker C: I feel like the longer you stay in crypto, the more you learn that at the end of the day, you can't make everybody happy. Like, no matter what you do, there's going to be somebody unhappy. Like, you can drive a truck of gold into someone's apartment and they're going to say, well, why only one truck? You know, like. And I don't know, at some point you just kind of. You just kind of learn to deal with it and you just.
00:36:03.175 - 00:36:16.225, Speaker E: By the way, on that note, I feel like some of the best marketers in crypto are those who have found a really good nemesis, and they're constantly at them like they have enemies and they're aware of it, and they take advantage of that to build their personal brand.
00:36:16.265 - 00:36:18.401, Speaker B: Have you guys seen this? Solenn versus Margin.
00:36:18.473 - 00:36:19.345, Speaker C: Oh, my God, no.
00:36:19.385 - 00:36:20.009, Speaker D: What happened?
00:36:20.137 - 00:36:20.885, Speaker A: Tell me.
00:36:21.345 - 00:36:23.681, Speaker B: I'm not going to comment too much because we like both of them.
00:36:23.753 - 00:36:24.193, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:36:24.289 - 00:36:26.593, Speaker A: No, I didn't know this drama existed.
00:36:26.769 - 00:36:36.273, Speaker B: It's like, drama, but it's not really drama. It's just a lot of, like, fun competition, like, really good, like, disses between the two, you know, founding teamers.
00:36:36.329 - 00:36:53.085, Speaker D: It's a red spot. It's entertainment. Yeah. I would say this, though. I think I did learn a lot about how to improve in the range of things. You know, I do actually think that even though it's intense, but I feel like there are two things that twist. Look at it, right? It can be like, oh, it's so unfair, blah, blah, blah.
00:36:53.085 - 00:37:06.477, Speaker D: But I think on my end, I think I generally feel like if I can just take a step back and go, okay, what? Did I do anything? Right? Could I have done anything better, you know, to cause this thing? Right. Yeah, I think I learned. No. Yeah. And to everyone watching and stuff, and I learned. Yeah.
00:37:06.661 - 00:37:09.225, Speaker E: Oh, I'm actually curious. What would you have done differently?
00:37:10.135 - 00:37:12.835, Speaker D: Oh, that requires a completely different podcast.
00:37:13.935 - 00:37:15.155, Speaker B: Jupiter Podcast.
00:37:15.975 - 00:37:24.191, Speaker D: Let's do a. Let's schedule a podcast, like, three months from now, you know, and go. Go through all the mistakes and stuff. Yeah, that'll be fun, I think. Yeah. Yes. But quite a few going back to.
00:37:24.223 - 00:37:46.471, Speaker A: Digots and the larger meta one is like, I saw Frank's recent announcement. I think it was a month ago where he came back, he was quiet for a bit. He came back and he's building this entire community. Right. Kind of like a YC book face for all of the members of the NFT community. And so you're seeing this with D Gods as an example, with Pudgy penguins, what you're seeing is you can license your IP and earn some of that revenue.
00:37:46.543 - 00:37:47.039, Speaker D: Interesting.
00:37:47.127 - 00:38:10.177, Speaker A: And then you have Azukis that are using their IP as a way to Create anime art and comics, et cetera. So I guess the question for you guys is where is the NFT space going? Where are these communities going? You have people that buy and sell these NFTs. What happens next? Like where do you see this going? What's the product market fit look like here for NFTs?
00:38:10.241 - 00:38:11.065, Speaker E: Beyond JPEG trading?
00:38:11.105 - 00:38:12.313, Speaker A: Beyond JPEG trading.
00:38:12.449 - 00:38:17.521, Speaker B: So maybe specifically talking about Frank, one of his biggest strengths is building the community, right?
00:38:17.593 - 00:38:17.881, Speaker D: Amazing.
00:38:17.913 - 00:38:40.245, Speaker B: The DGODs community is probably one of the best, most tight knit communities in all of crypto and resilient. And I think he should just double down on that. I think you should focus everything like whether it's throwing more events, whether it's creating this homegrown community of founders and builders within D gods and just double downing on that and just focusing on community versus maybe other things like IP or utility.
00:38:40.325 - 00:38:47.185, Speaker D: Question for you, how though, how did that come about? I'm just astonished at how resilient that community is. How did it come about?
00:38:47.525 - 00:39:20.467, Speaker B: I think the idea is he was a very different person at the time compared to other NFT founders. He was very vocal and he knew how to play the game. So he knew how to attract a bunch of attention from everyone who was on crypto Twitter at the time. He basically had a very interesting narrative which was creating almost like the. He describes it as like a frat house or a sorority house for everyone in crypto. Right. And I think that spoke to a lot of people because a lot of people at the time, which was during COVID wanted that feeling of belonging to a community.
00:39:20.571 - 00:39:21.415, Speaker D: Interesting.
00:39:22.235 - 00:39:56.411, Speaker C: I think to answer your question of like, where are NFTs going? I actually think the answer is they're going to become more and more diversified and each community is going to become a mirror of the founder in some way. Like you think about Mad Lads and maybe Tanzorians, they're like very oriented towards building and kind of towards like, hey, like let's make something cool. There's a lot of that kind of spirit there. Then you look at some of like Kleinos, right? It's a totally different group of people. They're excited about ip, they're excited about movies, they're excited about art, they're excited about creative. Their shorts are some of the funniest I've seen on Twitter.
00:39:56.563 - 00:39:56.851, Speaker D: Right.
00:39:56.883 - 00:40:04.659, Speaker C: Like they're hilarious, interesting. And then you pick the next 10 communities and they're all different and that's what NFTs should be. They shouldn't be all the same, they should all be different. Right?
00:40:04.747 - 00:40:05.099, Speaker D: Interesting.
00:40:05.147 - 00:40:29.697, Speaker B: I also think the idea of NFTs as communities is just one use case for NFTs. Definitely it's the current meta. It's the most obvious meta that makes sense or that people have found when NFTs became a thing. That just makes sense to be the first meta of this, of people trading NFTs back and forth. But obviously NFTS is just a form factor. It's like fungible tokens. You can use it for many things, right? It doesn't have to be just a community.
00:40:29.697 - 00:41:00.465, Speaker B: It could be real world assets. It could be basically tokenizing everything in the real world, where most things in real life are non fungible by nature. Like every single item you buy at a store has a serial number. And if you wanted to tokenize and then eventually financialize all of these items, they have to be NFTs. And I think that's what's interesting to us as tensors. We've built the financial rails for all of this stuff. And if crypto eats the world and everything becomes tokenized, then all of this stuff hopefully trades on tensor.
00:41:00.965 - 00:41:28.891, Speaker E: There is some really weird shit happening on Ethereum already. There's like luxury watches being tokenized as an NFT on chain. And then people would borrow money, borrow fungible like USDC or something off of the watch as a collateral. And so this idea of combining of putting all the assets on chain, it is happening like a few years ago. If you asked me a few years ago, I would have said too early, we're too early for this. But it is happening now and possibly it's going to Happen.
00:41:29.003 - 00:41:38.963, Speaker B: Yeah, the 10x feature there is watches, like think about like in the real world, where would you go to get like a loan on your watch? There's probably like two guys in the world who would do that.
00:41:39.019 - 00:41:40.443, Speaker C: You go to a pawn shop, there's.
00:41:40.459 - 00:41:43.051, Speaker B: A loan, or you go to a pawn shop, which you get like completely ripped off.
00:41:43.083 - 00:41:44.563, Speaker A: Yeah, ripped off, yeah, like loan sharks.
00:41:44.619 - 00:41:54.963, Speaker B: But now you basically get access to this global permissionless liquidity. The djens, the degens who are ready to earn yield on anything, they have so much money just because they were.
00:41:54.979 - 00:42:47.125, Speaker C: Earning the power of the web or like Internet in general. And crypto just accelerates it, which is things that used to be niche start to become global. Like what did Reddit do? Right? Reddit created a place for niche communities to go global. And you can all of a sudden find like if you're interested in, I don't know, collecting red tiles for your house, then all of a sudden you can find another guy who's interested in collecting red tiles for his house and you guys bond. Crypto takes that to a. Yeah, I mean, yes, crypto takes that to another level where not. Not only do you bond based on interest now, but you also bond financially because you guys probably both invested in some reptile startup and you guys have their tokens, their NFTs, and it's all fun and games and it just like creates another level of connection and brings people together even more.
00:42:47.235 - 00:42:52.753, Speaker A: It almost seems like crypto is sucking the real world in slowly but surely.
00:42:52.809 - 00:42:54.009, Speaker D: Slowly but surely. Yeah.
00:42:54.097 - 00:43:03.841, Speaker A: And, you know, when we always talk ciao to founders, we're like, you know, just focus on the users that are in crypto. It's very hard to attract people that are outside of crypto. And eventually, on that note, I'm really.
00:43:03.873 - 00:43:47.709, Speaker E: Annoyed every time someone gives advice on Twitter about, hey, let's focus on the real world rather than, yeah, don't build a token. Yeah, it doesn't make sense because historically, for the last 15 years, what has been happening for the last 15 years is you have the real world installing Metamask one at a time, one at a time, always one at a time. And once they're into MetaMask, they start doing some defi stuff, NFT stuff, and they get converted because they make money. And this whole process of user conversion through wallet installation and then making money has been happening for 15 years. And now we have a critical mass of those. There's like one. There's $2 trillion of on chain wealth in the hands of those people.
00:43:47.757 - 00:43:48.093, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:43:48.149 - 00:43:55.997, Speaker E: Why would you. In the vast majority of startups, it does not make sense to target that world, just target this world. There's $2 trillion sitting there for you to target.
00:43:56.101 - 00:44:08.739, Speaker C: It's also a lot harder to build anything for the real world. You're going to be up against existing regulations, you're going to be competing with existing players who don't want you there. You have to deal with atoms rather than bits. I mean, it's literally taking the hardest path.
00:44:08.877 - 00:44:09.415, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:44:09.535 - 00:44:23.847, Speaker D: I feel like on this point, let me put a pitch in for Solana. Right. You know. Right. Is that so me. So I talked totally about this quite a bit, is that there's actually a lot of value in having a critical mass of markets on Solana. Right.
00:44:23.847 - 00:44:34.327, Speaker D: And I mean, I didn't say assets in the markets. Right. Because you can have the. You can have assets on. You can have assets on Solana or any chain, but it doesn't matter. Right. In the markets for Them, right? That means that you need extremely liquid.
00:44:34.327 - 00:45:03.249, Speaker D: For example, it's one thing to put your luxury watch on chain, right? It's nothing to have a. To have a functioning market, right? You know, for that fractionalized watch or for the loans and everything, right? So I feel like that's actually a really big part of it. I think the question becomes the. I mean, think about, right? So I had an edge on technology, right, for like last couple years probably, right? But as we were talking before the show, it's like at some point swee app dos and everyone's going to come up with like as good technology.
00:45:03.337 - 00:45:04.337, Speaker A: Yeah, right.
00:45:04.401 - 00:45:16.209, Speaker D: So question is, okay, so what is Solana's edge going to be, right? You know, I argue that the edge that the community ecosystem the chain has to build towards is having a critical mass of markets, right? You know, and what do you mean.
00:45:16.217 - 00:45:17.601, Speaker A: By critical mass of markets?
00:45:17.633 - 00:45:53.637, Speaker D: That means that it's quite simple, right? It's like, can we. Because Solana, the main thing is that I'm from Jupyter, right? So we take a view on this, right? It's like we want there to be like a lot like all the Forex rwa, you know, shitcoins, right? Meme coins, good coins, whatever, right? You know, to be on one single chain, right? Because when you have one single chain, when you go from WAN to like RWA to like a PayPal transaction, right? You know that that's powerful, right? You know, when you have things like PayPal PyUSD, right? And go from like any given coin like with to PayPal USD, then it gets the payment. That's powerful, right?
00:45:53.661 - 00:45:55.865, Speaker A: You know, with to Microsoft stock.
00:45:57.765 - 00:46:14.649, Speaker D: And another idea, always flirt was quite simple, right? Can we actually do it such that. Can we actually build and this kind of one of Jupiter's thing, right? My thing, okay, Around. Can we actually build something where we actually incentivize people instead of to list on chain, right?
00:46:14.737 - 00:46:15.545, Speaker A: Yeah. You're talking about.
00:46:15.585 - 00:46:58.931, Speaker D: Yeah, it sounds like a crazy idea, but here you go, right? When you list on a penny stock, whatever, right? It's like you don't get much, right? You just get, you know, you don't really. You really don't get much, right? And you just get a lot of shit, you know. But then if we can build a parallel kind of like auditing, parallel verification mechanism such that if you run, for example, if you run a successful Internet company, right, you want to list on chain, you get community, you get capital, you get all the degens. More fun. Why not? So I feel like that's the word that I think we want to move towards, right where, okay, can you really have a critical mass of tokens and markers and like use cases right in like remittance, everything, you know, and there's tremendous power in having all those things on one network.
00:46:59.083 - 00:47:04.283, Speaker A: It's almost as if like every startup that builds in any sector in the space should just tokenize.
00:47:04.379 - 00:47:06.979, Speaker D: Yeah, precisely. You know, do you guys, do you.
00:47:06.987 - 00:47:09.335, Speaker E: Guys feel threatened by aptos and sui?
00:47:09.795 - 00:47:46.723, Speaker B: Here's my take. So I am sure that SUI and Aptos are technically, probably technically equivalent for all intents and purposes. Like, same tps, same, maybe even better deliver experience based on what I've heard. But if you think about all of these different chains as snowballs, all of them start rolling down this big hill at different times. Solana basically started rolling down this hill two, three years ago, right during the bull market. They were able to battle test their infrastructure. They were able to onboard everyone who was priced out of Ethereum to start trading NFTs on Solana.
00:47:46.723 - 00:48:29.197, Speaker B: Hence why there's such a big NFT community on Solana right now. And they're just further down the hill and they're getting bigger and bigger than SUI and Aptos. And all this momentum tends to compound in that if you see a big snowball like Solana rolling down the hill and you're a builder and you want to follow the biggest snowball, you'll probably choose to build on Solana more often than you choose to build on aptos or sui. And as you start to see these compounding effects occur amongst builders, amongst liquidity, amongst products and infrastructure, that's where Solana can probably pull ahead of SUI and aptos to a significant point where it doesn't matter if these other chains are just as technically capable as Solana.
00:48:29.261 - 00:49:07.975, Speaker D: Precisely. So just to elder that, right, first of all, Developer Pin is a feature not about. Okay, sorry. I mean, the 75 developers on Solana will tell you that, right? You know, it's like really like having gone through that period, you know, we just really figured out a lot of things. I think, you know, I think it's actually a sense of pride, you know, among Solana developers. But beyond that, I think Richard is exactly right. Say, for example, say you're building a RWA thing, right? And what was the main, what's the first thing you need, right? You need access to users and people use you and buy your stuff.
00:49:07.975 - 00:50:00.525, Speaker D: You can build Ethereum, but mainnet, because that's actually where most of the liquidity is. But then Your user base is going to be quite limited because of the gas cost. You can be on L2, but there are very few L2s that have sufficient critical mass. You can build on your aptos or any other Cosmos chain, which is fine, but they wouldn't have the same level of user adoption. So I feel like for the next couple of years at least, I feel like Solana is going to have, I think, a new date, right? A really big advantage, you know, in being the only chain that's performant enough with critical mass of users and guys, by the way, the fact is that like the Meme Coin community and the NFT community and the perps community is very strong on Solana and it's the only chain that has a really strong like Meme Coin and apart from Ethereum Mainnet. Right. You know, but again, Bitium Minute has an issue of like, you know, being responsive to use.
00:50:00.525 - 00:50:13.389, Speaker D: Right? But apart from that, think about it. Solana is the only chain that has like a very strong NFT community, micro community and Purge community and training community. Right? And I think that cannot be understated in terms of new assets coming on chain.
00:50:13.517 - 00:50:17.821, Speaker E: You guys are the three of the most legendary builders on Solana.
00:50:17.893 - 00:50:18.621, Speaker D: No, no, no, no.
00:50:18.653 - 00:50:46.337, Speaker E: You are by objectively, just by looking at the volume and you're fully committed to Solana. You're loyal to Solana, at least for now, for the foreseeable future. Now I want you guys to steel man Ethereum. What are some of the things that are good about Ethereum that you appreciate or maybe even ask another way? What are some of the reasons why Ethereum would ultimately beat Solana?
00:50:46.441 - 00:51:29.759, Speaker C: I think the obvious one is liquidity mode. Ethereum still has a lot more liquidity and Ethereum also has a lot more mindshare with more mature institutional players. I think if somebody seriously thinks about storing millions dollars of on chain assets, probably Ethereum is their number one choice right now. So I wouldn't underestimate that and how difficult that is to surmount. I still think that I know that Santiago and some other guys are saying like, oh, there's a good chance Solana beats Ethereum. I think that chance is pretty small and I think Solana would really need to pull a miracle for that to happen. Obviously we're going to work our asses off to make that happen, but at the end of the day, I don't think that chance is near 50% or something.
00:51:29.759 - 00:52:01.329, Speaker C: And I think it's basically that liquidity mode, developer mode as well. Better tooling, more developers Ethereum has probably what, four or five times more developers. And maybe one other thing I observed is often Ethereum developers tend to be a little bit more mission driven and that means that sometimes they're more enduring and they build products that maybe take a bit longer to build but end up being a little bit more interesting. And I think Solana builders have a little bit to learn there, us included.
00:52:01.457 - 00:52:42.925, Speaker B: Yeah, my perspective is so like I mentioned, with momentum compounding for Solana vs Swe and Aptos, the same thing applies for Ethereum. I think that compounding effect is very hard. It's very hard for Solana to catch up to the point where it can flip Ethereum. The other thing is, I'll give you an example, Angellist, for example, if you want to invest through crypto, they don't accept Solana, they don't accept anything else. And that goes back to the idea that people just have that narrative in their mind that Ethereum is more secure. These big institutions who do want to jump into crypto and have some notion of, okay, Solana is this newer chain. Ethereum is the basically the first smart contract L1 that took off.
00:52:42.925 - 00:53:25.949, Speaker B: Probably better just from a risk mitigation perspective. Just go on, go with Ethereum, even though it may cost our users a bit more, they're paying a premium for that because of risk. I think on Solana we tend to, and I do this a lot on Twitter, we tend to trash Ethereum because it's technically inferior in certain ways and you're paying a lot more for gas fees. But a part of me thinks at a certain point Ethereum will get to the point where the fees are a lot lower. Maybe it's not like a penny of a penny, but it's a tenth of a penny and that's good enough for most people. And their snowball is still big enough to capture most of the mind share and they'll do fine in the long run.
00:53:26.037 - 00:53:37.833, Speaker A: We're starting to see a new behavior change with builders where they're starting to take mini roll ups or app roll ups and they're starting to pay for their customers fees. So like AVO is an example, who we interviewed last podcast.
00:53:37.889 - 00:53:38.665, Speaker D: Oh, I love Julian.
00:53:38.745 - 00:53:39.313, Speaker A: Julian's great.
00:53:39.329 - 00:53:40.285, Speaker D: I love Julian.
00:53:40.825 - 00:54:05.177, Speaker A: Julian, I love you. And so what he's doing is specifically him is they're using data, they're using different ways to like make the fees cheaper to the point where now that he's paying for all the fees so customers don't see the fees at all. And so they are like Looking for ways to compete with Solana in ways that can kind of give them similar experiences. So just kind of a thought to that.
00:54:05.321 - 00:54:20.609, Speaker D: Yeah. I think I love Ethereum. I mean, we go way back, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, way back and stuff. Yeah, we've done, I mean, wtc, Right. You know, and so I don't know, I don't really see that as a competition, you know. Right. I don't.
00:54:20.609 - 00:54:44.131, Speaker D: Which is why I feel sad when I get trash born by. I mean, you made. But let's look at that. I think Ethereum has a. I mean if you go to like Stanford Blockchain Week, right? You are, you'll be astonished. Right. All these like really top level researchers coming from every single part of the world, every single institution and they have such a unique view of Ethereum.
00:54:44.131 - 00:54:52.225, Speaker D: Right. You know, and that's coming at all kinds of angles, right. You don't see them. Solana, not by far. Right. The only blockchain that can ever be that is Bitcoin. Right.
00:54:52.225 - 00:55:03.909, Speaker D: Just like the pure diversity of like researchers just coming in into solving all the different problems, roll ups and everything. You just don't see anywhere else. Right. So I think that's actually one huge thing.
00:55:03.957 - 00:55:11.149, Speaker A: You know, Mert's trying to create that, right. With Xerox. Mert, I don't know is that they had a research.
00:55:11.237 - 00:55:11.653, Speaker B: Mert.
00:55:11.709 - 00:55:12.189, Speaker A: It's Mert, right?
00:55:12.197 - 00:55:13.373, Speaker D: Yeah, I know.
00:55:13.509 - 00:55:16.945, Speaker C: I think it's from Toronto, the hub of crypto.
00:55:18.205 - 00:55:22.221, Speaker A: But he's trying to create like a research. More people to research for Solana, right?
00:55:22.253 - 00:55:29.603, Speaker B: Yep. It's like a telegram group. I'm not in it because I'm apparently not smart enough. Whenever you think I'm smart enough, add me into the bro.
00:55:29.619 - 00:55:31.895, Speaker C: If you're not smart enough, there's hope for the rest of us.
00:55:32.595 - 00:55:35.575, Speaker A: But he's trying to recreate some of this, right? It seems like.
00:55:35.995 - 00:55:37.299, Speaker D: Yeah, I think it's very difficult.
00:55:37.347 - 00:55:37.975, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:55:39.115 - 00:55:42.295, Speaker C: It's a different culture you guys talked about. It's like engineering driven.
00:55:42.995 - 00:55:49.841, Speaker E: Tweeted this. I said, Solana is engineers and Ethereum is computer science. And somehow the Ethereum Max were pissed at that.
00:55:49.873 - 00:55:50.161, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:55:50.233 - 00:55:51.489, Speaker E: It's a fucking compliment.
00:55:51.537 - 00:55:52.665, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't know.
00:55:52.745 - 00:55:54.537, Speaker A: I mean, anything you say to them, they'll get pissed.
00:55:54.561 - 00:55:55.605, Speaker E: Yeah, that's right.
00:55:56.145 - 00:56:10.689, Speaker D: But guys, get to the point, right? I think the point here is that there's no good or bad. Right. The fact that Solana is so engine driven. Right. Also means that you have more single source of failure. Right. You know, whereas the Ethereum is Like very, like the whole.
00:56:10.689 - 00:56:35.531, Speaker D: The whole research arm is like very decentralized at this point. Right? Yeah, it's a good thing. I think the other good thing is that I think we are actually seeing. So you know how we talked about Solana having like one big network, everything, right? You know, but the good thing about our tools is that like, you know, the tools. Look at our tools, right? When you spin our L2, we can think of, ah, ni O2. Why the fuck do we care, right? You know, oh, idea. Wow.
00:56:35.531 - 00:56:37.931, Speaker D: NI O2. New tokens, new farms, new users, Right.
00:56:37.963 - 00:56:40.067, Speaker A: You know, Ah, that's a good way to look at it.
00:56:40.091 - 00:56:48.583, Speaker E: No, no, I have a tweet for this. I didn't want to tweet it out because that will piss off the Ethereum maxes. But that's exactly, that's exactly the boy.
00:56:48.599 - 00:56:49.595, Speaker B: You already said it.
00:56:49.935 - 00:56:53.223, Speaker E: That's exactly the bull case for precisely.
00:56:53.279 - 00:57:08.151, Speaker D: It's a bull case. It's very, very hard for like, there's no way someone can go on Solana right now and spin up sp out token slot and be like, hey, token, it's very hard. No one care, right? You know, but come on, man on, spin on your auto. You copy space UNISWAP V2 copy paste.
00:57:08.183 - 00:57:10.567, Speaker A: You sound like.
00:57:10.751 - 00:57:15.045, Speaker D: No, no, that's exactly. You go on now.
00:57:15.085 - 00:57:17.061, Speaker C: Leaking the next six months of his roadmap, right?
00:57:17.093 - 00:57:30.853, Speaker D: Now, I'm just saying, right? Like it's a bookcase, right? And I'm saying that's the bull case. Hey, there you go. The bookcase. It's not a bad case. It's a bookcase, right? And what that means, that gives you so much more room to bootstrap an entirely new ecosystem.
00:57:30.949 - 00:57:31.845, Speaker E: Exactly.
00:57:32.005 - 00:57:34.565, Speaker D: See, it's not a shitcase, it's a bookcase, right?
00:57:34.605 - 00:57:35.165, Speaker A: It's a bookcase.
00:57:35.205 - 00:57:47.211, Speaker D: It's a bookcase. You can go to any part of the world and be like, hey, I want to do a Papua New Guinea L2, right? And I'm not. I'm serious, right?
00:57:47.363 - 00:57:48.747, Speaker A: They'll go, no, I'm serious.
00:57:48.771 - 00:57:58.099, Speaker D: And then you can spin your own. You spin your own. You can spin your own defi code system from scratch, right? And your own culture, own community. You can't do that on Solana is a community already, right?
00:57:58.147 - 00:58:00.035, Speaker A: Well, I mean, you could build roll ups for some.
00:58:00.115 - 00:58:07.299, Speaker C: There's another actually benefit to all twos, and that's like segregation of apps might actually be good.
00:58:07.347 - 00:58:08.003, Speaker D: Yeah, precisely.
00:58:08.059 - 00:58:35.513, Speaker C: Because if you have an app that's doing a lot of damage to the chain, the problem with Solana is even though there's kind of local fee markets, they don't quite fully work right now. But the problem is like something like drip, which is like printing NFTs in the millions, is actually kind of making our life hard because we need to ingest all those NFTs in all of our data pipelines right now. And the benefit of these L2s is that you take a very heavy app that needs like a lot of the chain's capabilities and you segment it away.
00:58:35.609 - 00:58:42.225, Speaker A: What about like localized fee markets and dimensionality that Anatoly talks about? Does that. Do you guys. How are you guys thinking about that?
00:58:42.265 - 00:58:49.441, Speaker D: So actually one. Actually it's not perfect yet. Right. Okay. But thankfully I think 1.1 and we know because we do that a lot. Right? We did a lot.
00:58:49.441 - 00:58:55.945, Speaker D: So I think 1.1 is going to be a lot better. Right. So it's actually. It's not binary. Right. It's never works perfectly.
00:58:55.945 - 00:59:08.503, Speaker D: Right. But the thing is that I think over time it has worked. It worked better and better. Right. I think the next major upgrade, 1.18 is supposed to be like the version that really makes it much better, you know? Yeah, that's concern everything.
00:59:08.559 - 00:59:08.855, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:59:08.895 - 00:59:10.319, Speaker E: Do you guys go ahead?
00:59:10.407 - 01:00:02.285, Speaker B: I was going to say, like in theory, localized fee market is you're basically taking like parallel parallelism to the extreme. We optimize the heck out of it in hardware and you just hope that hardware will scale to the point where it can service basically all state that will ever live on a blockchain or live in crypto. Yes, in theory that might work, but there are practical limitations, like just engineering bandwidth. Solana, they have a great team, engineering team. But even then there are bugs come up. They might be hampered by some other unrelated performance thing that they have to deal with. The practical situation is they're roadblocks and they're friction points as you work towards this vision of localized fee markets taking over anything that you need to do when it comes to parallelization.
01:00:02.285 - 01:00:19.565, Speaker B: Whereas I think the app chain model, you can see it working practically now. And at a certain point, maybe we do need app chains in order to act as that bridge between the current state of localized fee markets and the perfect theoretical model of localized fee markets.
01:00:20.145 - 01:00:48.527, Speaker D: I mean, AV is a good example. Right. They take something that is really going to be extremely hard to build Ethereum, and also probably subject to a lot of other constraints on Solana and just say, I'm going to be an Altool. It's very, very specific for the given purpose. And I feel like that would be probably a good model for Altus. In the end it's like how do I create Altoo that I don't care about anything else else, nothing else at all. And I don't care about what's happening on a chain.
01:00:48.527 - 01:01:36.815, Speaker D: I don't care about drip minting a million things. So my honest answer is that I have a bookcase for both Solana and Ethereum. My bookcase for Solana is that I think the world would seriously move a big step forward when you have all the use cases like payments and remittances and transfers and all the markers on one chain. Because there's no way that there's no way that multi chain work can be as good as that. But on the other hand, as we discuss this, is that there's also many, many reasons why, including the ability to create a new ecosystem with its own tokens, ability to kind of create your own self resilient use case and decentralization. Everything that will make it feasible for Ethereum L2 ecosystem. So I'm a big boo of both.
01:01:38.485 - 01:02:08.095, Speaker A: What I like about Solana specifically is that, you know, there's a team that's like focused on onboarding new use cases and new users. And an example of this is like token extensions, right? A way to create private transactions, a way to list RWAs, a way to do X. I feel like those are some interesting ways to onboard new types of product builders to build some products around it. What are your thoughts on extensions? I guess maybe it's the pivot, I guess super bullish.
01:02:09.275 - 01:02:45.151, Speaker C: I think most people underappreciate the power they unlock. So for those who don't know, extensions are basically these things that let you create a token with God powers. It can do things like oh, I'll only allow this transfer if XYZ conditions are met or oh, this transfer is completely private, it's hidden. Or oh, every time a transfer happens, some percentage of the transferred funds is paid as royalty to the creator. It just unlocks a swath of use cases that are very hard to do for token creators. Otherwise it's a library.
01:02:45.263 - 01:02:48.615, Speaker E: It's a set of smart contracts that other people can can build on top of sort of.
01:02:48.655 - 01:02:59.093, Speaker C: It's actually even easier than that. It's basically a bunch of methods you call when you create the token. So you don't even need a separate smart contract for it is baked into the runtime itself. Nice. It's super powerful.
01:02:59.149 - 01:03:51.561, Speaker B: This sort of goes back to like the idea that Solana is more practical they're trying to meet the real world where it is instead of sort of a theoretical argument that maybe if crypto eats, you know, the entire world, then this, this system will work perfectly. But right now that's not the case. Like a lot of people think a lot of institutions, the biggest like kick kickback that they give crypto is they can't do kyc. And the only way to do KYC is maybe what Uniswap did where they introduced a transfer hook specifically to Uniswap, but maybe not other programs. And yes, a lot of people on Ethereum basically funded it because it's not decentralized. They're basically trying to corrupt crypto. But Solana, seeing it from a different perspective, where their mission is to onboard as many people into crypto and the only way to do that is to meet in the middle with institutions and give them these transfer hooks, give them a KYC hook in order to get people to build on Solana.
01:03:51.743 - 01:04:12.741, Speaker A: It's funny, the whole ERC 404 dilemma, right where people that want to introduce their own standards, you really can't. There's a whole EIP process that people have to go through just to get some sort of real world use cases. And on Solana by introducing these set of libraries, anyone can build any types of use cases. And I think that's what Ethereum should be doing also.
01:04:12.853 - 01:04:32.861, Speaker E: The other big thing coming up in Solana is fired. Answer and I have two very important questions I've never been able to find the answers to. First question is when. And the second question is how much, how much faster? You guys are builders, you may not know the answer, may or may not know the answer. But I'm curious if you have a view, any rough estimate on these two questions?
01:04:33.053 - 01:05:11.925, Speaker B: I'd be lying to you if I knew when. It sounds like it's right around the corner. Maybe this year I think they might go on DevNet from what I've heard in terms of TPS. So caveat this. A lot of TPS numbers you see in general for any chain is completely unrealistic. It kind of reminds you of benchmarking and databases where you have these very contrived artificial benchmarks and they say like oh, this database can achieve a million tps, but in practice that's not the case. And I think that's the same with Fire Dancer where yes, it can do 3 million TPS, which is actually massive.
01:05:11.925 - 01:05:29.415, Speaker B: I think given real world use cases. It's still very bullish in that from what I've Heard if you just take all of the existing transactions on Solana and try to plummet through Fire Dancer, it could probably get to 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 easily. Which is basically a 10x improvement on Solana.
01:05:29.495 - 01:05:44.615, Speaker C: Currently our AWS bill will go from 70k a month to 700k a month. Yes, people forget that who has ingest all that data? The real beneficiary from all of this is Bezos.
01:05:46.155 - 01:06:03.651, Speaker D: No, it's funny because he said that your revenue goes up. It's not necessary because like when. No, no, no, no, no, no. Guys, it's actually really interesting because people always think that like a data equals more revenue. Right. Or something. And no, that's not true because like when, when your cost of putting data on chain becomes much lower.
01:06:03.651 - 01:06:12.685, Speaker D: Right? What increases spam. Yeah, spam. Right. So it's like. So, so as builders, right, we're actually dealing with a lot of spam, you know. Right. Literally.
01:06:12.685 - 01:06:27.341, Speaker D: Right. It's like, like, like for example, like 20 but 20 tokens account for like the vast majority of trading volume. Right. You know, but they're like a gazillion tokens that we have to cater to everyone. Right. You know, and, and yeah, our AWS is a. Yeah.
01:06:27.341 - 01:06:55.987, Speaker D: But actually on this part of Dancer, right. I think, I think I feel like people are, and correct me, I'm wrong, okay? But I feel like people are somewhat like obsessed with the TPS numbers and all these things. But I feel like the real benefit here is around diversity. Right. It's going to be a first chain that. One of the first chains besides Bitcoin, Ethereum, that has an entirely different validator system. But note, this is not good or bad.
01:06:55.987 - 01:07:01.973, Speaker D: It's more complicated, you know, like how will these two vegetatives work in practice together, you know? Right, right.
01:07:01.989 - 01:07:04.269, Speaker E: You have one that's much faster than the other. How do they.
01:07:04.357 - 01:07:12.925, Speaker D: And one that's more proven than the other. Right. You know what I'm saying? Right. So I think the answer is that we don't know. Right. You know? Right. I think we can probably find answers if you look at Ethereum's.
01:07:12.925 - 01:07:25.429, Speaker D: How Ethereum has done in the past. Yeah. How they've done stuff. But I think. Yeah. But I have no idea how the two TPS systems would kind of hang out together.
01:07:25.557 - 01:07:29.505, Speaker C: So what I want to know is do I get points if I'm going to run.
01:07:32.845 - 01:07:39.989, Speaker D: Dollar fire. Let's go. Hey, there's WMP fire points. There's WMP for you want a fire on my fire?
01:07:40.077 - 01:08:13.343, Speaker B: The practical concern is so I think if Fire Dancer is really pushing 10x if not more TPS than the original client, then you can imagine all these validators would just move to Far Dancer because they can make 10x. Yeah, I think this is how it works. They can make 10x the transaction fees and then you sort of like perhaps see this big shift of people just moving to another client and you don't get that client diversity. That's my layman view of it. Maybe it's actually different. But that's like maybe one sticking point that might come up in the client diversity argument.
01:08:13.439 - 01:08:14.725, Speaker D: Interesting, interesting.
01:08:14.895 - 01:08:16.057, Speaker E: This actually.
01:08:16.201 - 01:08:40.641, Speaker C: So again like going back to like we kind of spoke about other blockchains coming online. I kind of feel it's pretty hard for them right now because I feel there's like two like counter positioning spots the same way that there's two in mobile, there's two in operating systems. And I feel the two in blockchains are slower but more decentralized and faster but more kind of maybe not centralized but like just different, built differently.
01:08:40.673 - 01:08:41.480, Speaker D: More focus. More focus.
01:08:41.552 - 01:09:03.552, Speaker C: More focused. Yeah. And good one. But yeah, so I guess what I'm getting at is well holy shit, like Sui or Aptos better have a connection to Jump to build another Fire Dancer. Right? Because this thing took what, years in the making and it's going to go online and it's going to be really hard to compete with. And so I don't know actually I don't know if there's going to be a third blockchain that pops the same way these two did.
01:09:03.608 - 01:09:21.075, Speaker E: The distant third right now is Cosmos. If you view the trade off areas in the 3D visualization that you have Ethereum orthogonal to Solana. But then there's a third dimension which is Cosmos, which provides a lot of customizability.
01:09:21.735 - 01:09:22.711, Speaker C: Like app chains, right?
01:09:22.743 - 01:09:24.431, Speaker A: Yeah, app chains, but like really big apps, right?
01:09:24.463 - 01:09:25.395, Speaker D: Are you fading?
01:09:27.935 - 01:09:28.583, Speaker C: No.
01:09:28.719 - 01:09:36.951, Speaker E: I can't speak my mind about Polka Dot empirically. If you look at the data of great founders building on Polka Dot, it's been going downhill.
01:09:37.023 - 01:09:38.351, Speaker A: Yeah, they've been leaving Polkadot.
01:09:38.383 - 01:09:53.783, Speaker B: Do you guys have an idea of why? Let's say Polkadot or even. What's the other one? The other Ethereum founder, Cardano. Cardano. Why did they not take off at all?
01:09:53.919 - 01:09:57.495, Speaker E: I don't know. I have two hypotheses. I have no idea if it's true or not.
01:09:57.615 - 01:09:58.407, Speaker D: I love that.
01:09:58.551 - 01:09:59.711, Speaker A: I have one idea too.
01:09:59.823 - 01:10:00.471, Speaker C: Let's hear it.
01:10:00.543 - 01:10:01.431, Speaker D: Let's hear it.
01:10:01.583 - 01:10:31.733, Speaker E: Polka Dot go to market for. So every chain for Every chain, their customers are developers. Basically Polkadot's go to market first go to market. They went for, in my experience, very mercenary developers. And that was like peak ZIRP, Peak 2020, 2021. There were a lot of developers that were not missionary, they were very mercenary. They built on Polkadot for, to make a quick buck and the moment the bull market died, the whole zurb died.
01:10:31.733 - 01:10:54.133, Speaker E: They just went away. So they lost their developer community. So you and I spoke with quite a few Polkadot developers from back in the day in that era and we just didn't see in terms of quality of developers building on Polkadot, there's certainly. The quality is certainly there, but the quality was never on par with Solana and Ethereum and Cosmos.
01:10:54.189 - 01:10:57.605, Speaker A: I also think it was the way you secure the parachains was the biggest issue.
01:10:57.645 - 01:10:59.213, Speaker E: Yes, that was my other arguments.
01:10:59.269 - 01:11:20.813, Speaker A: Okay, yeah, so like, yeah, I mean like for, in order for you to have a parachain you need people to stake their dot and they go through this auctioning process. You have to hit at a certain threshold and it's like it went to like 50 million. I mean it was really hard to compete and so only very few people were able to secure that much dot to secure the chain. And I think it was like three or four and then it kind of fell off from there.
01:11:20.869 - 01:11:26.845, Speaker E: That was a self owned, like they didn't have to do this. They did, they did this because they wanted to have some kind of value across.
01:11:27.865 - 01:11:40.233, Speaker D: Precisely, precisely. Actually so, so that, I mean that, that's the, that's the main thing, right is that I feel like it became a system whereby like everyone became working for the dot holders as working for their own.
01:11:40.289 - 01:11:45.209, Speaker A: They were trying to like sell me like, like come on, just take your. I'm like, dude, just remember those, those.
01:11:45.257 - 01:11:46.361, Speaker E: Builders who pitched us.
01:11:46.433 - 01:11:46.937, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:11:47.041 - 01:11:52.395, Speaker E: They, they asked, they told us if you want an allocation in our product you need to say some dot.
01:11:52.475 - 01:11:53.255, Speaker A: Exactly.
01:11:53.755 - 01:11:55.747, Speaker E: Back in the day it completely reversed.
01:11:55.811 - 01:11:59.051, Speaker A: Like the founders should be thinking about themselves, not the product. Not the product they're building on.
01:11:59.083 - 01:12:00.659, Speaker D: Precisely. Yeah, precisely. Precisely.
01:12:00.747 - 01:12:03.139, Speaker A: So I think that was the sec. Yeah, so that's the other.
01:12:03.187 - 01:12:18.587, Speaker D: So you end up, you end up with founders that were really good at talking because you had to go to all the dots holders and be pitch yourself and high. I'm so great. Everything. Right. So I feel like created a system where besides Mercenary you have people that promise a lot of front. Right. And not just that.
01:12:18.587 - 01:12:28.531, Speaker D: So they promised a lot front, but they also had to offer a lot front. Right. You know, so what end up is that? They actually offer a lot. Right. You know, to the, to the holders. Right. And obviously you know what happens in the end.
01:12:28.531 - 01:12:28.923, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:12:29.019 - 01:12:50.987, Speaker A: I also think the team kind of lost their magic. Like I think the token went live. People, people got rich. And you could tell, like, you know, we worked pretty closely with the Polkadot team and you know, they kind of, I felt like they lost yet like the competitiveness, the hunger. Like when you talk to Anatoly, like, I'm like, God, like it's like he just started his startup like he's so hungry.
01:12:51.051 - 01:13:05.835, Speaker D: That fucker is like talking about dual poly. It's like they're going all day long. Oh, I'm going to disrupt the dual poly, you know, of like Apple and Google. I'm like, what the hell? Like where does this come from? All right. But it's amazing. He's like calling everybody, how do you do these things?
01:13:05.875 - 01:13:20.203, Speaker C: Sorry, I have one question that I'm curious to get your guys takes on. So obviously today crypto is super tribal. Each blockchain is basically its own little nation with like patriots. Do you guys think 10 years from now it's still going to be tribal?
01:13:20.379 - 01:13:23.171, Speaker A: I think as long as there's a token, there will be tribal.
01:13:23.323 - 01:13:24.147, Speaker D: Yeah, me too.
01:13:24.211 - 01:13:25.459, Speaker E: I think it'll get more tribal.
01:13:25.547 - 01:13:26.155, Speaker C: More tribal.
01:13:26.195 - 01:13:26.411, Speaker D: Wow.
01:13:26.443 - 01:13:27.295, Speaker A: It'll get worse.
01:13:27.835 - 01:13:29.395, Speaker D: I think racism.
01:13:29.515 - 01:13:31.699, Speaker A: But it's religion.
01:13:31.747 - 01:13:33.491, Speaker E: It's religion but with money.
01:13:33.563 - 01:13:43.319, Speaker B: At least for the intellectually honest people. Which is like you two guys. Right. Clearly you guys started off on Ethereum and actually Mel too. You guys started off on Ethereum, but we were super open minded on Solana.
01:13:43.367 - 01:13:43.575, Speaker D: Right.
01:13:43.615 - 01:14:00.917, Speaker B: And that's why you guys accepted us into Accelerator. I think if you fundamentally believe that this chain is different enough and offers some unique value prop that Ethereum, let's say, doesn't offer. You don't care about being traveled to Ethereum all the way through just because you made a massive bag on Ethereum.
01:14:01.111 - 01:14:06.041, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean for me it's just coping. Right. It's an anti cope effect for me.
01:14:06.193 - 01:14:20.065, Speaker D: I feel like, I actually feel like totally has a really. And probably as well. They have a pretty healthy mindset on these things. Right. They kind of know that like okay, whatever we do, there's always going to be other things around. Right. And also it's pretty important to just have an open mindset on things.
01:14:20.065 - 01:14:32.897, Speaker D: Right. So I feel like Tensor and us are probably similar as well. You know, it's not about like being maxi, it's just about recognizing what we want to build and what's good, what was good, right? You know? Yeah. So I feel like, yeah, that's. Yeah.
01:14:32.921 - 01:14:55.953, Speaker C: It's like when people ask us, is Stencer planning to move off Solana? And we say no. It's actually mainly driven by the fact that there's just so much to build on Solana and we just, we just want to build it. Like, why would we leave? There's like so much design space now. Is that answer going to be the same 10 years from now? I don't know. Maybe not. Right? Maybe there's the new, you know, not Lana Chain and we go there. I don't know.
01:14:55.953 - 01:15:02.037, Speaker C: But like, at least right now there's like hyper unexplored design space on Solana to go and play with.
01:15:02.101 - 01:15:29.919, Speaker D: It's very stimulating for us, Right. I feel like the main thing for us is that we want to provide deep value. Right? And you have to provide deep value when you are spread out, you know, you actually want to like say, hey, how do. Also, not just that I think you guys know, right? It's like, I feel like another thing that real builders know that other people don't is that a lot of times value is from being embedded in the ecosystem, you know? Right. It's not just when you go to an ecosystem, the tech can be the same, but you are not. It's not the same because the ecosystem is different. Right.
01:15:29.919 - 01:15:53.251, Speaker D: So I feel like for us right now, I think we have this very deep connection in the community ecosystem and I think that that's actually really big for us. Right. And for me personally, you guys know, right. I've been working on Multi chain for a long time. So for me it's not so much like, okay, I don't think it makes sense for us to build Jupiter and I chain. Right. You know, but finding ways to kind of like connect Solana to other change, that's a pretty big topic for us, you know.
01:15:53.323 - 01:15:59.763, Speaker A: So question for you guys. What are your thoughts on Blur launching Blast the founder?
01:15:59.899 - 01:16:04.339, Speaker C: I think Pacman is solving a problem, but he has right now sounds like.
01:16:04.347 - 01:16:05.575, Speaker A: A very political answer.
01:16:06.395 - 01:16:08.571, Speaker D: What problem is that? What problem is that?
01:16:08.643 - 01:16:37.759, Speaker C: Well, he wants to build a perp product or like more advanced primitives and Ethereum is too slow for him and he saw an opportunity to verticalize and only entire stack. And I respect that because when you verticalize and own the entire stack, you can build things that other people can't build. DYDX did the same thing. Now do I think the whole multisig drama is the way it should have been done. I mean, probably. No, but like the decision of a builder to go verticalize and build an Apple esque experience. Holy shit.
01:16:37.759 - 01:16:39.195, Speaker C: Let's go. I think that's awesome.
01:16:39.495 - 01:16:53.265, Speaker B: I want to take a different take. And that is, I think he also saw this massive opportunity which is to build an L2 that just, I guess I don't know what you call it, like restaking or you natively stake when you bridge over. It's already staked.
01:16:53.305 - 01:16:53.481, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:16:53.513 - 01:16:54.385, Speaker B: So you're already earning yield.
01:16:54.425 - 01:16:55.633, Speaker E: So beautiful, so elegant.
01:16:55.689 - 01:17:09.617, Speaker B: It is, right? It makes so much sense. Like why would you build or why would users use Arbitrum or Optimism where they're not earning no yield Naturally by using all of these protocols like Uniswap, when you just port over to Blast and just earn like, you know, 3%, 4% yield.
01:17:09.721 - 01:17:25.679, Speaker E: People were so upset about Blast, but this thing alone, the native field is really elegant. And that just speaks to me that Taishun, the founder of Blaz and Blur, is one of the handful of people who truly understand the degens like he understands the users better than anyone else.
01:17:25.807 - 01:17:49.937, Speaker C: I mean, whenever you get a polarizing reaction, you're onto something. The worst one is when you do a product drop and nobody cares. People are like doing good. Whenever you get a polarizing reaction, you know you're onto something. If people just give you a thumbs up and they're like this is cool, well then they're going to forget about you the next five minutes. But if how the people can't live without it and how the people think you're a dumbass, then you're definitely.
01:17:50.081 - 01:18:08.643, Speaker B: It goes back to like crypto is part building the future of finance, but also part entertainment. Where in entertainment you don't want to be someone in the middle. Right. You don't want to be like non controversial. You don't want to have like mid. Mid curve takes. You want to either be on the extremely like, like positive side of things, like optimistic side of things.
01:18:08.643 - 01:18:09.843, Speaker B: We want to be a pessimist.
01:18:09.939 - 01:18:12.851, Speaker A: That's why every day I either wake up laughing or crying.
01:18:13.003 - 01:18:13.483, Speaker C: Nice.
01:18:13.579 - 01:18:14.171, Speaker B: Both.
01:18:14.323 - 01:18:31.187, Speaker C: My version of that is the evening shower. So I always, I always say that evening shower. And I'm always staring at the wall and I'm always either too fucking worried to fall asleep or I'm too ecstatic to fall asleep. And I'm just like standing there in the shower for like an hour, just like staring at the white wall.
01:18:31.291 - 01:18:32.251, Speaker A: That's why I love crypto.
01:18:32.283 - 01:19:12.167, Speaker C: I'll never do it Yeah, I actually think so. I don't think people outside of crypto realize how much more you're taking on as a founder in crypto. Well, like in Web two you have all the problems of hiring operations, fundraising, product, market fit like all of that stuff. In crypto you have all of that and you're a public speaker and you're a public Persona and you're running a community and you have to deal with regulations and securities and legal and like it is basically like two, three jobs combined in one. And I don't know, like if I knew everything right now, if I knew everything I know right now, would I start a crypto startup? Yeah, I definitely have to like think about it.
01:19:12.191 - 01:19:20.583, Speaker B: I don't know. Well, I mean the fact that there's so much you have to consider as a founder going to the space and we saw like a bunch of like founders actually leave crypto and go into AI.
01:19:20.639 - 01:19:21.235, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:19:22.575 - 01:19:24.055, Speaker A: That they're like, fuck this, I'm out.
01:19:24.135 - 01:19:27.191, Speaker B: Yeah, for us, like, I mean that's an opportunity.
01:19:27.223 - 01:19:27.367, Speaker D: Right.
01:19:27.391 - 01:19:31.289, Speaker B: Because there's less competition and the upside is much higher.
01:19:31.337 - 01:19:31.521, Speaker D: Right.
01:19:31.553 - 01:19:37.761, Speaker B: Because now you're building on this hyper financialized platform, if you will, or technology hyperconnected.
01:19:37.793 - 01:19:38.793, Speaker C: Right in the first place.
01:19:38.889 - 01:19:44.129, Speaker B: Hyperconnected. And the opportunity is massive for us. Right. So I think it's worth it.
01:19:44.257 - 01:19:45.965, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess we'll find out.
01:19:46.625 - 01:20:01.033, Speaker A: What is the future of Tensor. I know the future of Jupiter, at least you mentioned, which is like getting more start like real world assets on chain as an example or sorry, like stocks. Right. Like pink sheets. Right.
01:20:01.089 - 01:20:20.201, Speaker D: I just not really reward numbers. But just like I think the whole point here is that what is like how do we get as many like markers and assets and use cases on the one chain as possible? Right. You know, and do. Including, like, including. Can we really bring like listing on chain. Right. I think that was huge.
01:20:20.201 - 01:21:00.223, Speaker D: You know you can do that because I think if we start doing those, if we start doing those trading. Firstly, migration, can we actually get enough people to migrate on chain? Secondly, can we get enough? Because for example, in the real world, for example the NASDAQ and CME and all these things, they're fundamentally separated, but Forex are fragmented. But then on chain they're the same thing. We don't care. The, on chain, the cme, the nested, the Forex market can list in one, one transaction. And it's amazing, I mean from anyone who is like in traditional finance, they go, wow, holy shit. It's like you have all these things on chain in one market, fully transparent and the whole transaction costs like 0.002
01:21:00.223 - 01:21:23.161, Speaker D: cents. Right. And all the fees and everything is fully transparent. Right. So I feel like that's the second thing, right? Can we really bring as many markets on chain as possible? Right? And thirdly, is that. And thirdly, is that like okay when it comes to stocks? I don't really think of it as like I think a real game here is not really in bringing NASDAQ on chain. I think a real game here is can we actually make it such that people want to list on chain instead.
01:21:23.161 - 01:21:28.525, Speaker D: And don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that's easy. Although I do want to run a pilot this year.
01:21:31.985 - 01:21:35.377, Speaker E: Traditional companies listing on Jupiter.
01:21:35.561 - 01:21:43.937, Speaker D: Yes, Jupiter, providing the framework for that to happen. And guys, we actually have enough degens that will ape in.
01:21:44.081 - 01:21:47.721, Speaker E: I'll open DJS will ape into anything will.
01:21:47.793 - 01:22:36.655, Speaker D: Precisely. So I feel like right now I do want to run the pilot this year, but I think the way to do it is not to say hey, let's do it right away, but more like a pilot, right? So I think the future of Jupyter is quite simple. I think first of all, I think we just need to execute really well on things that we have, including a launchpad, including all the products, the first thing, right? And then the longer term is around either multichain, but not bring Jupyter on our chains, but more how do we make it easier to transact between chains different things. I don't think we ever go like Jupiter on do that. And thirdly, it's like, okay, can we do the more futuristic stuff? Can we really think about how do we say what are the most common pain points of credify and how do you stop them on chain? So that's actually something I'm really interested.
01:22:36.765 - 01:22:41.883, Speaker E: For me, the main pain point is just all the fucking paperwork. The KYC every year sign something.
01:22:42.059 - 01:22:57.975, Speaker B: Don't you think eventually all that stuff will catch up to crypto in that, let's say hypothetically we somehow get stocks onto crypto rails. Wouldn't the SEC come in and say, okay, you have to kyc everyone.
01:22:58.555 - 01:23:07.397, Speaker E: I think this stuff is extremely malleable. Still we as an industry, the possibility and the ability to shape how we wanted to.
01:23:07.461 - 01:23:37.673, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, I think so. Yeah, for example, that can be also I feel like we are taking a very western way of the world look at it, right? There are probably a gazillion like good startups in like, you know, Nigeria, you know, or like a lot of places that will strongly benefit like for Example, when I say I want to do the stock exchange thing. Right. People automatically assume that, okay, I'm going to target like a famous like web company in the, in the Western world. Western world. Maybe not. Maybe there's this like, maybe there's a future startup.
01:23:37.673 - 01:23:52.617, Speaker D: Yeah. This really, really good company in Kenya. Right. You know that, that would benefit from having an auditing firm that is like based somewhere legitimate auditing firm by someone else. And then we can promote them. Right. You know, so I feel like there's a lot of ways you can go about it, you know? Yeah.
01:23:52.641 - 01:23:55.801, Speaker E: So I feel like that's a really interesting thesis. I've never thought of it.
01:23:55.833 - 01:23:57.445, Speaker D: Yeah. I think right now, I think right now.
01:23:59.415 - 01:24:05.295, Speaker E: You'Re basically making NASDAQ open to the entire world. Precisely because blockchain enables that.
01:24:05.335 - 01:24:10.751, Speaker D: Yeah. Besides it. Because why are we. That company will find it really hard to list on NASDAQ.
01:24:10.783 - 01:24:11.823, Speaker A: Are you competing with NASDAQ?
01:24:11.879 - 01:24:22.215, Speaker E: There's only ever 4,000 public companies listed in the US and the vast majority of companies don't meet the bar. Don't meet their standards requirements.
01:24:22.295 - 01:24:22.575, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:24:22.615 - 01:24:28.063, Speaker C: Or they're just democratizing capital markets, which is exactly what crypto set out and.
01:24:28.079 - 01:24:29.039, Speaker A: SPACs tried doing it.
01:24:29.087 - 01:24:29.715, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:24:30.095 - 01:24:46.199, Speaker B: Reminds me of the stablecoin movement where the adoption of stablecoin, it seems like it's not skyrocketing in the west, except for amongst crypto people, but it's skyrocketing in these, I guess, overseas countries that don't have financial rails.
01:24:46.247 - 01:24:58.527, Speaker D: Precisely. Precisely. So that's a really, really good point. Right. For me, transferring something asset is what. What is seemingly very trivial for us. Right.
01:24:58.527 - 01:25:06.951, Speaker D: It's very difficult for other people. You know, like stable assets is great example. Right. You know. Right, yeah. Like if you're in us, US dollar is a thing. It's like, it's just everything you use.
01:25:06.951 - 01:25:15.471, Speaker D: Right. It's cash and everything. Right. But then if you are like say in South America or America, why, man, even getting access to a dollar is very difficult. You know, it's crazy difficult.
01:25:15.503 - 01:25:19.031, Speaker A: You know, we have a startup that's trying to solve that in South Africa.
01:25:19.223 - 01:25:20.535, Speaker E: We have one in South Africa.
01:25:20.615 - 01:25:21.003, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:25:21.079 - 01:25:32.771, Speaker E: One in Nigeria, one in Central America and then one is South America in this batch because I'm personally so fucking bullish. The whole landscape of stablecoin being adopted.
01:25:32.883 - 01:25:36.987, Speaker A: In emerging countries because USD is not available. It's all dried up, I'm telling you guys.
01:25:37.011 - 01:25:49.185, Speaker D: Yes. So it's interesting. Everyone who's interested in this thing should really read up on. So anyone who actually Thinks of USD as something that is easily accessible. Should really go read up right on how difficult is to get USD.
01:25:49.565 - 01:25:53.549, Speaker E: There is a massive shortage of US dollar in the whole of Africa right now.
01:25:53.677 - 01:25:57.021, Speaker D: Massive shortage, right. And the whole liquidity rate is crazy.
01:25:57.093 - 01:26:00.733, Speaker A: This is like a perfect wedge into Africa and stable coins.
01:26:00.829 - 01:26:11.541, Speaker B: I'm surprised, like, I mean maybe the, I don't know, the Fed hasn't really picked up on this, but this is their way to just continue to push US dollars down people's like other people's throats.
01:26:11.733 - 01:26:14.887, Speaker E: Such a cell phone to not support stablecoin.
01:26:14.991 - 01:26:19.351, Speaker A: Well, if Trump becomes president, maybe they'll be more pro crypto.
01:26:19.463 - 01:26:21.475, Speaker D: I mean I have so many thoughts on this, but I'll just.
01:26:21.975 - 01:26:34.271, Speaker A: So for the Tensor team, what is the future of Tensor? Is it always going to be a place where you sling JPEGs or is it going to be a platform for RWAs and like what is the future?
01:26:34.383 - 01:27:10.155, Speaker C: Yeah, it's super simple. I mean half the assets in the world, maybe more, are non fungible and clearly everything is trending towards digitalization. So a lot of those assets are going to end up as NFTs. And what we're building is hopefully the liquidity layer that powers all of that. So the trading of all non fungible assets. And just like you guys, I mean we're super excited to bring on real world assets that are non fungible onto the chain, whether that means working with partners or doing that ourselves. But you know, financializing the world on Solana and making all that trade on Tensor.
01:27:10.315 - 01:27:11.235, Speaker D: Let's do it.
01:27:11.395 - 01:27:19.531, Speaker E: You would expect different clients, different front ends serving different verticals and you would provide SDK, the API, the backend.
01:27:19.603 - 01:27:27.651, Speaker B: Yeah. I think the other point here is at least I genuinely believe that this is only possible on Solana. And there are two reasons.
01:27:27.723 - 01:27:28.299, Speaker E: Opos.
01:27:28.387 - 01:28:16.623, Speaker B: Opos, exactly, opos. The first reason is there's enough of an organic NFT community already that will basically help us bootstrap and basically like help fund us essentially with all the fees we're collecting to build up this infrastructure for this like utopian view of how NFTs will become. Everything in the real world will become financialized as NFTs and will provide the rails. The second point is Solana is one of the future. I mean compared to Ethereum L1, everything happens on chain on Solana, which means you don't have to communicate to some off chain database that has some signed message for a listing. You can do everything on chain, which means that you can actually build a permissionless marketplace layer without someone ever having to talk to the core team. I think that's pretty powerful.
01:28:16.623 - 01:28:20.999, Speaker B: I think it's one of the only things. It's the opportunity for Solana. It's the opportunity for us, actually.
01:28:21.047 - 01:29:10.737, Speaker D: Just want to add on that real quick, right? Is that. I feel like what people don't see, right? Is that, yes, people trade shitcoins, right? And meme coins right now, right? People are able to generate assets and just, like, treat them super easily, right? Like someone can literally create an asset on Meteora Iridium immediately. Jupiter picks it up immediately. It's like routed, routable across everything, right? Same thing for Tensor, right? Someone can create NFT anywhere you get picked it up, right? Things like that. I feel like what people don't see right now is that how. How is a direct line, right? Like when, like, Tensor can easily Support any other RWAs, right? Or any NFTs, right? It's like supporting this, like what the JPEG think, right? Is very. The technology and the use case is extremely similar, right? To in the future, supporting all kinds of other, quote unquote, more serious.
01:29:10.841 - 01:29:15.017, Speaker C: The JPEG is the proof of concept. You do it for fun, but that's how you bootstrap.
01:29:15.081 - 01:29:26.173, Speaker D: Precisely. People try to. People try to. Yeah, precisely. People don't see that, right? People try to go the other way around, right? You know, but I go, oh, let me take the most serious and boring thing and put it on chain, right?
01:29:26.229 - 01:29:37.045, Speaker C: It's like forums, right? Forums are web. Two initially were used by, like, San Francisco nerds talking about what they had for lunch. And now all of a sudden, forums is how the world communicates. And so that's the same thing that's going to happen to us.
01:29:37.085 - 01:29:44.187, Speaker D: Yeah. And then every. I mean, every tweet is a forum, right? You know, every Facebook post. Instagram is a power format as well, right? You know, so I feel like.
01:29:44.261 - 01:29:48.015, Speaker A: And contain my bullishness. Keep going.
01:29:48.095 - 01:29:50.183, Speaker C: Keep Valentine's Day at the end of it.
01:29:50.279 - 01:29:51.607, Speaker D: Yeah, Valentine's Day, right? There you go.
01:29:51.671 - 01:29:53.635, Speaker A: This is a perk. Valentine's Day gift for me.
01:29:54.055 - 01:29:54.471, Speaker D: Chow.
01:29:54.503 - 01:29:55.375, Speaker A: Any final questions?
01:29:55.455 - 01:29:58.063, Speaker E: I think this is the greatest episode we've recorded.
01:29:58.239 - 01:29:58.995, Speaker A: Wow.
01:29:59.455 - 01:29:59.863, Speaker B: Wow.
01:29:59.919 - 01:30:03.435, Speaker C: Let's go. All right, Big shoes to step into.
01:30:04.535 - 01:30:08.595, Speaker A: Maybe one last question. When? Token?
01:30:10.845 - 01:30:14.865, Speaker D: When? When? When? Not if, but when.
01:30:15.165 - 01:30:16.973, Speaker B: Mel, maybe you could answer this.
01:30:17.149 - 01:30:18.397, Speaker D: Oh, for you guys.
01:30:18.501 - 01:30:18.933, Speaker B: No, no, no.
01:30:18.949 - 01:30:19.101, Speaker E: For.
01:30:19.133 - 01:30:19.581, Speaker B: For you.
01:30:19.653 - 01:30:20.021, Speaker D: Oh, me.
01:30:20.053 - 01:30:21.629, Speaker B: He only had a token when. When. Token.
01:30:21.677 - 01:30:22.265, Speaker D: When.
01:30:26.525 - 01:30:32.133, Speaker C: You'Re like. You're like. You're actually very poetic, right? You're actually like a romantic deep inside because, like, you write poems and stuff.
01:30:32.189 - 01:30:32.965, Speaker E: Totally, totally.
01:30:33.005 - 01:30:33.925, Speaker D: I'm totally romantic.
01:30:33.965 - 01:30:39.145, Speaker A: I feel like sometimes when you talk to the community, it's a girl. I swear to God.
01:30:40.515 - 01:30:42.459, Speaker C: He has that sensitive side to him.
01:30:42.627 - 01:30:46.683, Speaker D: Very sensitive. Which is, I'm so hurt recently, you know, I'm so bothered recently. Yeah.
01:30:46.819 - 01:30:48.387, Speaker A: Don't worry, you're doing great.
01:30:48.451 - 01:30:50.643, Speaker D: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
01:30:50.699 - 01:30:51.923, Speaker A: Others would have walked away.
01:30:52.059 - 01:30:53.135, Speaker D: Thank you. Thank you.
01:30:54.275 - 01:30:56.575, Speaker A: So should we address? All right, well.
01:30:58.635 - 01:31:00.811, Speaker C: Token. What Token? Never heard of a token.
01:31:00.923 - 01:31:03.295, Speaker E: Five more minutes. Why don't you guys shill Alliance?
01:31:07.555 - 01:31:09.615, Speaker D: I'll show you guys. Can I.
01:31:11.635 - 01:31:12.587, Speaker C: Full force?
01:31:12.771 - 01:31:21.963, Speaker D: Okay. Shill. All right, let me go. Let me draw all my poetic and dramatic energy, okay? To show, to show alliance, you gotta.
01:31:21.979 - 01:31:23.015, Speaker B: Look into the camera.
01:31:23.435 - 01:32:10.129, Speaker D: I'm always looking camera. So I feel like alliance is like seriously the first wife, okay? No, the firm that I think is the most well suited to take on the next era, you know, in the sense that like, first of all, I feel like, at least from my point of view, I think Xiao and Imran has always been there, right? You know, I think like when, like everybody just. They're also like, for example, they're also like very focus on first principles, right? You know? Right. In the sense that last couple of years, I think Imran and Chow has always been here, not just with me, but also with the ecosystem.
01:32:10.257 - 01:32:10.521, Speaker B: Right?
01:32:10.553 - 01:33:20.723, Speaker D: And I think everyone really appreciates that, right? You know, and that actually is a very interesting quality because it reflects the ability to like, look past. Because 99% of investors are narrative driven, right? Whatever the. Whatever the main narrative is, they follow. So the ability to just like, hey, you know what? Let me just not get caught up in whatever city is saying, right? But actually think for myself and be able to like, you know, invest. I mean, that's why you guys are on here, right? Because, you know, because of this relationship, right? You know, that's why I'm here too, right? You know, because. And the ability just like, okay, look past the current narrative to invest in what they really believe in, right? Not just money, by the way. Money's easy, right? By repetition, right? And willing to make a statement, right? So I feel like that's actually one thing that's actually really amazing, right? And then, and then, and the second, and then the second thing about alliance is that it's the ability to go deep, right? Like really go deep, right? There is not just talk about high level thesis because, I mean, let's face it, right? Most investors, they talk high level thesis, right? You Know, but they go deep, right? They go deep into working view, figuring out the partners understand ecosystem.
01:33:20.723 - 01:33:30.055, Speaker D: You know, degening into shitcoins, it is really important. It's actually really important. It's like, it's like you cannot be a good VC in this day and age if you don't degen.
01:33:30.835 - 01:33:33.227, Speaker E: You know, I would say the same about founders, to be honest.
01:33:33.291 - 01:33:41.163, Speaker D: Yeah, precisely. Right. It's like you can't stay at, yeah. You can't stay on. You can't stay at arm's length. Yeah, right.
01:33:41.219 - 01:33:41.715, Speaker C: Don't get it.
01:33:41.755 - 01:33:50.801, Speaker D: You just don't get it. You don't get how a space works. Right. And then you're always like. So I feel like that's actually really awesome because these two guys, they try everything, you know, they ape into staff, they ginger into staff.
01:33:50.873 - 01:33:51.257, Speaker A: It hurts.
01:33:51.321 - 01:33:52.577, Speaker D: They shoot. Huh?
01:33:52.761 - 01:33:54.441, Speaker A: Sometimes it hurts financially.
01:33:54.473 - 01:33:55.045, Speaker C: Right.
01:33:56.345 - 01:33:59.365, Speaker A: The whole thing is called the game goes to zero.
01:34:00.345 - 01:34:03.065, Speaker C: If you never lost money on a shitcoin, you're not part of the club.
01:34:03.105 - 01:34:25.261, Speaker D: No, but that's it. No, no, no. Even worse if you never aped into a shitcoin after reading a tweet about it, like, I am the most, I'm the best investor in the world. Hey, I read a tweet and who has time for looking at Rock Check, right? You know, things like that, right. The fact they try products, you know, they, they, they, they get, they get. It's great, right? You know, and thirdly, is that I think just great friends. Yeah.
01:34:25.373 - 01:34:26.901, Speaker E: You know, just, that's the most important thing.
01:34:26.933 - 01:34:49.749, Speaker D: Yeah. I think just the ability to like not judge you, you know. Right. No, no, seriously, that's really important, right? Because I, I think most, I think a lot of people what, what I do is that because I mean, let's face it, right? Crypto is extremely reputation based thing. Right. So it's like it, I, I, I think most people just want to be seen with the hottest thing at the moment.
01:34:49.837 - 01:34:50.853, Speaker C: Kind of Hollywood, right?
01:34:50.909 - 01:34:51.125, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:34:51.165 - 01:34:53.837, Speaker C: It's like you want to be seen on the right party with the right people.
01:34:53.901 - 01:35:02.597, Speaker D: Yeah. And happy to share that. These guys don't do that way. They don't work that way. Right. They have never that way. You know, they never worked in a sense that, oh, okay, oh, you're hot, I'm gonna go after you.
01:35:02.597 - 01:35:06.237, Speaker D: Right. They've always like, whether you're good or bad, they're always there for you, you know? Right. Yeah.
01:35:06.261 - 01:35:37.115, Speaker C: The other thing I will say about alliance is just the quality of companies and builders. We constantly interact with other alliance companies like Liquify, you know, like the pound no more guys helped us a lot. It's just like building what I was saying earlier, like building a startup was hard. Building a crypto startup is twice as hard. But building a crypto startup as part of alliance, yeah, you can, you can. It's kind of stomachable because, like, there's other builders supporting you and you get some help and a bit of fun along the way. So.
01:35:37.115 - 01:35:37.987, Speaker C: Highly recommended.
01:35:38.051 - 01:35:42.515, Speaker B: Yeah, I would say you guys would make for great NFT project founders.
01:35:42.675 - 01:35:46.175, Speaker C: And the reason why I say that always be closing.
01:35:47.595 - 01:36:09.751, Speaker B: I mean, honestly, you guys should launch with us. But yeah, I mean, on a serious note, you guys have built an awesome community of builders, founders, companies right in crypto that have done super interesting things like mail here with Jupiter. We're friends with like the Steppen guys who've like made this big splash on Salon.
01:36:09.783 - 01:36:16.223, Speaker D: We all love you guys. Like, guys, I'm telling you, dude, it's gonna be Valentine's Day. I'm telling you. Marius loves you.
01:36:16.319 - 01:36:16.775, Speaker E: Marius.
01:36:16.815 - 01:36:22.223, Speaker D: Marius fucking loves you, man. He's like, it's unhealthy, I swear. I'm just saying it's unhealthy, you know?
01:36:22.239 - 01:36:22.343, Speaker B: Right?
01:36:22.359 - 01:36:23.423, Speaker D: Whatever, you know?
01:36:23.599 - 01:36:24.335, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:36:24.495 - 01:36:39.581, Speaker D: Well, and one last thing. Another awesome thing about alliance is that if you look at their structure, they try everything. You know, they tried the fund structure, they tried the DAO structure, they tried every single thing. Right. You know, they, they really do crypto. They dog food, everything, right? And I really respect that.
01:36:39.653 - 01:36:47.205, Speaker E: We're builders. We just try shit. We just launched our office like a week ago, literally. Like we had an MEP for our founders for this badge.
01:36:47.325 - 01:36:47.749, Speaker D: It's very.
01:36:47.797 - 01:36:49.197, Speaker A: If you look at it, there's really nothing there.
01:36:49.221 - 01:36:49.813, Speaker E: Yeah, there's nothing.
01:36:49.869 - 01:36:54.277, Speaker C: Which is exactly how it should be. Otherwise I'd be worried, like super factor.
01:36:54.341 - 01:37:12.997, Speaker D: No, no, it's great because if you look at other investors, right, they don't really degen. So in summary, I think my pitch is that they don't. My pitch for alliance is that I think if you look, they degen. They trash it out. Everything that you are doing, including NFT or Degen or whatever, they probably do too, you know. Right. And, and, and I was on the leaf here.
01:37:12.997 - 01:37:21.517, Speaker D: I was, I was getting coffee in Ren and he was just pitching me non fucking stop about a new his pop for the company. Right. I was getting annoyed. I'm like, what the. No.
01:37:21.541 - 01:37:23.305, Speaker C: But he showed up.
01:37:24.285 - 01:37:26.741, Speaker D: It was great. I'm like, wow, this guy is passionate. Holy.
01:37:26.813 - 01:37:29.469, Speaker A: I. I just, you know, I'm passionate. Yeah.
01:37:29.517 - 01:37:30.461, Speaker E: Love the game.
01:37:30.613 - 01:37:31.429, Speaker D: Love the game. Great.
01:37:31.477 - 01:37:38.165, Speaker A: And then, like, when Tenzer was coming out, like I was telling everybody, you got to try out Tensor. You got to try out Tenzer, Jupiter, Matora, whatever. Mercurio.
01:37:38.285 - 01:37:38.933, Speaker C: Just go.
01:37:39.029 - 01:37:39.285, Speaker B: Nice.
01:37:39.325 - 01:37:39.893, Speaker D: This is.
01:37:40.029 - 01:37:40.645, Speaker A: What do we do?
01:37:40.685 - 01:37:42.477, Speaker D: N. I love that. It's great. Yeah. That's all.
01:37:42.581 - 01:37:44.269, Speaker C: All right. Happy Valentine's Day, everybody.
01:37:44.357 - 01:37:44.597, Speaker A: All right.
01:37:44.621 - 01:37:45.069, Speaker D: Happy Valentine.
