00:00:00.250 - 00:00:41.700, Speaker A: Especially with the validation that Dydix moved over to Cosmos shows that there is a strategy for those that are building unmodolithic chains that value accrual or value leakage is actually very important for the app itself. Not having to compete with others like blockspace as an example. Being able to accrue more of the value and using that value to secure your own chain is probably the right model when you have maybe x amount of users right? But starting off like building on Ethereum makes a lot of sense, just the ease of cost, being able to pull synchronous composability from others, and just building a brand for yourself. But the end goal, I think, is to ultimately own the customer relationship.
