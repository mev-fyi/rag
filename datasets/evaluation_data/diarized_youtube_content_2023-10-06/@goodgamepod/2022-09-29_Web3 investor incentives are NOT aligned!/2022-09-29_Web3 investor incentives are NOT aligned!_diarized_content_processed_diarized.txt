Now you have this interesting dynamic where you have liquidity events that are much more quickly. People are making much more money very quickly. Is there enough incentives for investors to support founders? Because now it seems like every investor is just trying to go after the next big project.
00:00:22.228 - 00:00:37.090, Speaker B: Basically that turns investors who are post to help founders into active portfolio managers, into liquid market traders, into timing the market like it's a huge incentive disalignment.
