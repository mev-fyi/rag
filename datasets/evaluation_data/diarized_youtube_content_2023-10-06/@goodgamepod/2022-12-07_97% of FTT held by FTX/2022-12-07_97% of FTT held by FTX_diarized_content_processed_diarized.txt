00:00:00.160 - 00:00:13.166, Speaker A: And this is probably another big red flag that the industry may or may have not seen it until like later on was the fact that they only sold 3% of their entire supply of tokens. 3%. So 97% of tokens were held by FTX.
00:00:13.270 - 00:00:23.950, Speaker B: And it was vesting for like seven years or something. That was the thing that really stood out for me. Like, I've never seen a token project that would vest over seven years. Maybe it was ten. I can't remember. It was a really large number to me.
00:00:24.022 - 00:00:34.268, Speaker A: Like seven years at least at the time signified that. Okay, he's long term committed. Right. But now in hindsight, it's because he didn't want enough circulating supply.
00:00:34.356 - 00:00:35.076, Speaker B: That's right.
00:00:35.220 - 00:00:45.284, Speaker A: And so these are like all the kind of the yellow flags that we're starting to see. And even if you look at its balance sheet, there's about $2.2 billion worth of tokens that are sitting on FTX's balance sheet of serum.
