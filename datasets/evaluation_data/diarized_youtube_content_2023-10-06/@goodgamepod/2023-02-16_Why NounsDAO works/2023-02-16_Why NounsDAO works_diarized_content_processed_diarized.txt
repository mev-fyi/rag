00:00:00.200 - 00:00:57.984, Speaker A: I was an early announced buyer top 30 and the idea resonated with me at least because the concept of being able to manage and vote on that treasury could in the long run become very powerful, especially for a brand like Nounsdao, just because of the way it was started and using the premise of CC Zero as a way to extend that brand to other ecosystems. Like if you really think about it, you could use that treasury to buy a gaming studio. I'm not saying that that could could happen, but why couldn't it happen, right? And infuse that gaming studio with its ip and branding and create killer games and so that money that's just sitting and just growing over time will become the largest cofactor for people that want to be a part of that community. Even if you go down to like nouns doll forums, like there's hundreds of posts, hundreds of posts of people that just want access to that capital so that they could do something with it.
