00:00:00.250 - 00:00:32.806, Speaker A: My point has never been that roll ups are inherently bad. It's that they're being done too early, especially if you take the point of view like a longer time horizon. It's like, okay, crypto is going to be around for hundreds of years, decades, whatever, some long time horizon and we're in like smart contracts have been around since Ethereum. So like a few years. Why are we creating this much tech debt this early if we actually have a long time horizon? It doesn't really make sense. And like, yeah, I agree that Solana is a improvement obviously right now. And the interesting part about that is it does that while also itself being quite broken right now.
00:00:32.806 - 00:00:44.260, Speaker A: Like Salana is half not working right now and it's still quite impressive. And the reason I say that is because, okay, if that were to be fixed, what would the difference be then at that point at the L1, right.
