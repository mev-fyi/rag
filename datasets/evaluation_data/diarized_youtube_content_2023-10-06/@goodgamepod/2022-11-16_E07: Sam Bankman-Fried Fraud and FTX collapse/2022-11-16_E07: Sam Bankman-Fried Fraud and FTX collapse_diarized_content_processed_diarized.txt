00:00:00.320 - 00:00:46.720, Speaker A: Welcome to Good Game, a podcast for crypto insiders with your host Imran and Chow. Welcome to episode seven of Good Game. A lot has happened over the past week to two weeks. And so what we're gonna do today is we're gonna take a different approach, which is answer questions from our audience, but more or less talk about, you know, how we feel about the space, where we think the space is going to go forward, and what the contagion may mean for the industry at large and maybe chow, let's just get your quick thoughts on your thought, you know, over what happened over the past week, and then we'll talk a bit about the FTX blow up.
00:00:46.912 - 00:01:24.564, Speaker B: Yeah, well, it's fair to say that this last week was the single most absurd week in the entire history of crypto that have been here for almost ten years. I think even Mount Gox was unrivaled by what happened with FTX. So I think there's a lot that we don't know for sure yet, but we can speculate on a few things. Imran, I don't know if you want to talk about some of the facts first with what happened with FTX.
00:01:25.024 - 00:02:15.400, Speaker A: Well, I mean, let's just talk. Let's talk about what happened, right? And what was interesting was, I just want to point out a few pointers. First, what was very interesting was when FTX Alameda, when they were unwinding, the first entity or protocol they paid back was aave and compound. And so, which was very interesting. Right? I mean, like, we always talk about decentralized finance and, like, how important it is to the industry, but, you know, admits of a collapse, we're seeing, you know, aave and compound being paid back fully. And so if you look at the priorities, it shows you that decentralized protocols have the most priority. And so I thought that was very interesting.
00:02:15.400 - 00:02:58.104, Speaker A: Yesterday, JP Morgan tweeted out, there's just too much power concentrated with centralized exchanges, and there is a clear opening for decentralized protocols. So JP Morgan published his research, and it talked a bit about the need for decentralized finance. I thought those were two interesting points I wanted to point out before we just talk about the contagion, generally some of the facts. Jason from Blockcrunch had put it in depth, tweet thread in regards to the entire FTX from the start formation all the way to the collapse. But I'll point out a few interesting tidbits. Alameda was first started. It wasn't FTX.
00:02:58.104 - 00:03:26.534, Speaker A: It was Alameda. And the way they went out and approached investors was that they wanted to raise capital, and the promise was low risk, high returns. You're going to get guaranteed returns of 15% whenever you see something like that. Typically not all the time, but 90 plus percent of the time, it's a red flag. There's an edge case, and the edge cases are primarily, if they're incredible traders in the space, et cetera.
00:03:28.794 - 00:04:07.000, Speaker B: The better of a trader you are, the less you should be posting that kind of stuff, like high return, no risk. By the way, I got caught in the crossfire. We can talk about that stuff later. But I was among the people who saw the Alameda's pitch deck back in the day, and a lot of people were skeptical about the returns that Almeda was generating at that point in time. They saw the p and L graph that El Mita showing in the pitch. I don't have the source anymore. It's been three years.
00:04:07.000 - 00:04:51.784, Speaker B: The p and L charts that the Alameda showed was like a straight lineup, and people were really offended by that, and justifiably so, because in the vast majority of asset management businesses, you don't see that kind of returns. However, I actually come from HIV background. I knew that kind of stuff was believable, but at the same time, the words that put in the pitch deck, high return, no risk, that was a huge red flag and then pointed out, but anyway, that was 2019. That was before FTX even started, I believe. So let's move forward in time.
00:04:51.904 - 00:05:19.824, Speaker A: Yeah. So 2019. Sam launched FTX, and the premise was, there's an opportunity for another exchange, being that Alameda already has some share. They can use Alameda as a way to provide more liquidity to FTX. They can bring on more overtime, bring on more market makers, and then token listings. So that was kind of the edge. And they later raised seed capital.
00:05:19.824 - 00:06:20.576, Speaker A: They raised $8 million. I think some of the folks that stood out were raised capital and fanatic. But soon after, that's when the beef started between Alameda and Binance. I believe when Binance launched their futures exchange around that time, Alameda ended up nuking one of the markets. And so there's a tweet that's out there that shows CZ talking about this event and how they talked about a smaller market maker that was trying to nuke the market. But then they had a index price oracle versus just like a futures price oracle or something like that, which ultimately ended up saving finance. But that was where the epitome of the beef started, with Sam and CZ, and then there was pretty much hyperbolic growth right from there, because if you look at the exchanges at the time, primarily, there were mostly asian exchanges, and then you had FTX.
00:06:20.576 - 00:07:01.224, Speaker A: That was more of a trading focused exchange that really understood the problems that traders were looking for. So they launched some great products, and during the Defi summer, they had hyperbolic growth. They launched serum, and Serum was the ability for them to. They launched both FTT, which was the token that represents FTX, and then later on, they launched Serum, which is essentially a cloud based, decentralized exchange. And that was primarily predicated on Solana. Fun fact. At its peak, serum was at $122 billion, fully diluted valuation.
00:07:01.224 - 00:07:14.588, Speaker A: Fun facts. So let's talk a little bit about serum. I mean, do you want to touch on anything with the FTX story? Otherwise, I'm going to talk, but about.
00:07:14.716 - 00:08:19.854, Speaker B: I think the single biggest elephant in the room that we, as an industry somehow ignored was the fact that you have this giant exchange and you have this giant market maker, a really dominant market maker, and they had the same route. They were probably run by the same group of people in the same penthouse in tradify. This would not, would not fly. They would not fly. There's a reason why there's regulations around, like, around, like, chinese walls between the market making branch and the banking business at those investment banks. By the way, this regulation, actually, I think it was ruled out during the GFC in 2008. Right? They put a chinese wall between the market making and the banking side of things, but somehow we as an industry, just normalize this.
00:08:19.854 - 00:08:24.294, Speaker B: But in hindsight, that was one of the biggest red flags for me.
00:08:25.874 - 00:09:07.264, Speaker A: And, you know, many people memed about it where Sam, they would have, like, Caroline or Trabako or, or, and Sam, and they would always say, like, how Alameda and or FTX would be trading against their, their users. So the meme was there, the story was there. It just wasn't validated. Yeah. And over time, people have validated, folks like Hasaka on Twitter and many others validated this through just the way the product has been ran. Yeah. So let's talk about serum next, because all of this is gonna play an important story to the collapse of FTX serum.
00:09:07.264 - 00:09:41.308, Speaker A: They had about. So, serum launched pretty early, and the idea behind serum was, let's launch a decentralized exchange that is going to be primarily predicated on Solana. It'll be a cloud based versus Dex. So price discovery, et cetera, will be much, much more better. And so they launched. I think at launch, the valuation was at 1.2 billion at the day of the launch, which I thought was pretty extraordinary over time.
00:09:41.308 - 00:10:16.840, Speaker A: The main function for the serum token was that those that hold it would see the appreciation value, because the protocol itself would collect trading fees and use part of the trading fees to buy and burn SRM. The other, and this is probably another big red flag that the industry may or may have not seen it until later on, was the fact that they only sold 3% of their entire token. Their entire supply of tokens, 3%. So 97% of tokens were held by FTX.
00:10:16.952 - 00:10:28.976, Speaker B: And it was vesting for, like, seven years or something. That was the thing that really stood out for me. Like, I've never seen a token project that would vest over seven years. Maybe it was ten, I can't remember. It was a really large number to.
00:10:29.000 - 00:10:41.044, Speaker A: Me, like, seven years, at least at the time, signified that, okay, he's long term committed. Right. You know, but now, in hindsight, it's because he didn't want enough circulating supply.
00:10:41.664 - 00:10:42.564, Speaker B: That's right.
00:10:42.984 - 00:11:32.444, Speaker A: And so these are, like, all the kind of the yellow flags that we're starting to see. And even if you look at, like, its balance sheet, there's about $2.2 billion worth of tokens are sitting on FTX's balance sheet of serum. And so that kind of brings us to the point of, like, FTX is, like, assets and liabilities. Like, what is the assets liabilities? Like, how bad is it really? And how is it going to affect people generally? Typically, how it works is that if you're an exchange, and if you have customer deposits, you typically hold those customer deposits in cash or something, you know, or, like, treasuries or something that's deemed to be safe. If you hold it against bitcoin, you know, it's still very risky. But fine.
00:11:32.444 - 00:12:49.884, Speaker A: What FTX did instead was the. If you look at its balance sheet, about $14 billion of its balance sheet was in its own tokens. So a total of $19 billion are. There's a total of $19 billion in FTX is like exchange, right, from all the customer deposits. Of that, $14 billion is in its own shitcoin. You have, let's say, 4 billion in illiquid investments, and then a billion in, like, cash and crypto and the Robinhood stock. And the other thing you want to keep in mind is that FTX, and so all of this is just predicated on launching more tokens, where it retains a lot of its own token, and then market these tokens to investors as a way to generate FOMO and increase the value of its token so that they can start to collateralize and borrow against it, so they can do x, Y and Z.
00:12:49.884 - 00:13:13.796, Speaker A: And so with the crash of. With the three arrows crash, it turns out Alameda was in a. Was in a very deep hole, and that deep hole, like. Like, they should have just, like, closed the doors and walked away. But instead, what Sam did was they lend out. I don't know the exact number. It hasn't been validated yet, but let's.
00:13:13.820 - 00:13:46.616, Speaker B: Say 10 billion, basically in was in May or June. I can't remember when Terra collapsed. That ultimately affected Almeda. Sam had two choices, at least that's my speculation. Sam had two choices. One is let al Mira go bankrupt, and two is save Almira by giving Almeda FTX's customer deposits. And Sam chose the latter.
00:13:46.616 - 00:13:48.604, Speaker B: That was the beginning of the downfall.
00:13:50.984 - 00:14:31.418, Speaker A: That's what they ended up doing. Somehow, Alameda magically had enough FTT tokens, so they collateralized it with FTX, and FTX gave them the customer deposits. And obviously we know what happened after that. Alameda went down or lost customer deposits. And in fact, what they did was they started using customer deposits to invest in startups, which I think was horrible mistake. And many of these startups, when I've looked at the types of startups they're funding, they were very shady, like, red flag, yellow flag type.
00:14:31.516 - 00:14:43.110, Speaker B: So Jacob actually wrote a tweet on this, like, yeah. Where. How. How is that $10 billion worth of balance sheet, whole breakdown broken down?
00:14:43.262 - 00:14:43.638, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:14:43.686 - 00:15:15.914, Speaker B: How's that broken down? Well, there's 1.15 billion on Genesis, one point one to two billion dollars on Binance's stake in FTX, one to 3 billion on other vc. I think he means like, the. All the venture investments that Almira or FTX invested in. $1 billion on advertising. I assume that means, like, all the stuff with, like, Tom Brady. Yeah, Tom Brady, like, all those things.
00:15:15.914 - 00:15:57.132, Speaker B: Ten figures or nine figures worth of real estate? Nine figures worth of donations, you know, including the donations to the Democrats FTX foundation, all that stuff. And then unknown amount on lending. The unknown amount on lending is also interesting, because this whole contagion is related. Everything that happened since Terra to Almighty and FTX, this whole chain of contagion is one chain. They're all interrelated. At least that's my speculation. Again, we don't know this for a fact yet, but we can only talk about things probabilistically.
00:15:57.132 - 00:16:50.764, Speaker B: But this is my understanding. So when terror collapsed, three arrows happened. To be recklessly leveraged, and they lost a lot of money. And the money that they lost were actually the money that they borrowed from centralized lenders, including like, genesis and probably a bunch of other big lenders. And then those lenders, in turn borrow money from others, even others. Right, including Alameda themselves. And so when some of these C five lenders went bankrupt or they went into a situation of insolvency, Almeda got affected by the same chain of contagion.
00:16:50.764 - 00:17:37.944, Speaker B: So now Almeida has a hole. And then Almeda ultimately borrowed money from FTX. And so. And the FTX money, whose money is that? It's the customer's money. So basically, this whole thing was basically converting the collapse of terra into a hole on three arrows, which ultimately converted into a hole on the centralized landing platforms, which ultimately converted into a balance sheet hole on the balance sheet of Almeda and ultimately FTX, and ultimately the customers of FTX. So this whole chain reaction happened over the last half a year. And how did it take so long to play out? Well, it's just because FTX is such a big player.
00:17:37.944 - 00:18:16.304, Speaker B: Like, the smaller players were surfaced and basically discovered dead immediately, but the big players took a while. And this is exactly what happened in 2008, by the way, there's a huge difference between Alameda IFTX in 2008 in terms of fraud. But the chain of reaction, the contagion, happened in 2008 over many, many months, from Bear Stearns to Lehman. It took many months for all the players to surface. But anyway, so that's my probabilistic understanding of what happened over the last few months.
00:18:17.124 - 00:19:04.474, Speaker A: Yeah. And then in parallel to that, we saw when that collapse happened. It turns out like, Voyager was one of the largest holders of FTT tokens. The. And so there was a fuel of getting, you know, making sure that FTT tokens didn't land into the public markets, or at least that. That is the. The narrative that's playing on Twitter today is that, you know, one of the reasons why that acquisition happened was so that they could get customer deposits and the tokens as a way to kind of, like, fulfill that hole, that ever growing whole that is going to continue to grow.
00:19:04.474 - 00:19:47.664, Speaker A: And so you started to see this, like, acquisition strategy, which in part was primarily fueled by the hole in his balance sheet as a way to cover it up and then start to grow. And so he acquired Voyager Blockfi as a way. And then, in fact, within, like, there was a tweet thread or there was a thread that talked about Blockfi's, like, assets as soon as acquisition happened, they forced the entire aum of Blockfi, and they forced it onto FTX. So that is, like, another signal to tell us that, you know, this acquisition was primarily driven by the hole in the balance sheet, and they were trying to cover it up by more acquisitions.
00:19:47.824 - 00:19:53.084, Speaker B: Yeah. Using the customer funds of other c. Five companies that they acquired.
00:19:53.224 - 00:19:58.300, Speaker A: Yeah. At that point, it's. You're too big. I mean, you're gonna. It's too late. Right. Like, you're gonna fail.
00:19:58.372 - 00:20:14.788, Speaker B: Like, and relatedly, I think people tweeted about this on Twitter, so it's not private anymore, but there's startups that raise money from FTX that were forced to store their treasury on FTX.
00:20:14.876 - 00:20:15.584, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:20:16.084 - 00:20:18.584, Speaker B: And that was yet another way to plug the hole.
00:20:18.884 - 00:20:53.702, Speaker A: So, um, there was an article that talked about how much do you think crypto funds, um, custodied, uh, their assets on FTX? Well, it turns out between one to $5 billion was custody on FTX that is now lost. Um, I think that the right answer is somewhere, always in the middle, because truth is usually somewhere in the middle. So, let's say two. Two and a half billion was lost, which cons. Which is, uh, about seven. Five to 7% of all. Like, the crypto funds aum, in entirety of the crypto market.
00:20:53.798 - 00:20:54.638, Speaker B: How much?
00:20:54.806 - 00:21:00.118, Speaker A: 7% of the entire market of the crypto funds aum. So it.
00:21:00.246 - 00:21:07.566, Speaker B: 7%. Okay. I. Frankly, these are. Yeah, it's.
00:21:07.590 - 00:21:32.234, Speaker A: It's. It's not much, but, you know, for large funds, could probably withstand it. Right. The smaller funds are, like, ikigai and a couple other funds that. That went on public on Twitter talked about how they're going to need a bailout, or they'll need some way to get out of that hole. So I don't know what that means for crypto funds that are smaller size, which are liquid assets.
00:21:33.334 - 00:22:15.930, Speaker B: The funds that probably got hit the hardest are those who did short term trading because they had to have funds on exchanges in order to do short term trading, whereas the long term funds, they can just custody their assets within a separate non exchange custodian. And so if you look at the funds that do short term trading, then chances are, among those people, I think maybe a third of their. On average, a third of their aum is on FTX. Because the alternatives are what? Like finance, Coinbase? That's pretty much it, right?
00:22:15.962 - 00:22:35.474, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, it's binance, Coinbase, and FTX. Like, I mean, for the average fund that I talk to in the US or Europe, etcetera, it's usually those three. And in fact, traders that are like high speed frequency traders or like professional traders, they primarily use. They primarily use FTX.
00:22:35.514 - 00:22:43.134, Speaker B: That's right. Yeah. The market makers are definitely affected. They're the ones who have to be on FTX in order to provide equity on FTX.
00:22:43.714 - 00:22:51.994, Speaker A: Yeah. A couple more thoughts around there. We did a deep dive on Sam. Was it last session? Yeah, I think it was two sessions ago. Two sessions ago.
00:22:52.034 - 00:22:52.754, Speaker B: A month ago.
00:22:52.874 - 00:23:29.196, Speaker A: A month ago. And we talked about how Sam dominated institutions compared to Coinbase, and it turns out about 70% of all trading activity that comes out FTX institutions, whereas there's only a third of the total trading volume. And Coinbase are institutions. So it gives you the kind of the difference of the customers that they attract. So this hurt. This hurt institutions a lot more than it did retail from the. At least the trader side.
00:23:29.196 - 00:23:35.864, Speaker A: Obviously, there's a lot of retail that custody their assets. Not saying that, but the industry at large got hit.
00:23:38.844 - 00:24:15.684, Speaker B: Anecdotally, I've heard that a lot of asian. All the asian retail traders that I've spoke with pulled their assets out on time. They were on extremely high alert relative to western, you know, retail traders. And I just found it really interesting because asian. Asian retail traders get fucked all the time by centralized custodians. So they were always on high alert.
00:24:16.184 - 00:24:18.256, Speaker A: How many. Sorry, go ahead.
00:24:18.400 - 00:24:28.684, Speaker B: No, but like. But at the same time, I also know a bunch of people who got. Who are based in, like, Hong Kong, who got really screwed by FTX. By. Anyway, just an anecdotal observation.
00:24:31.664 - 00:24:46.924, Speaker A: Why don't we pause here? There's a bunch of questions we got asked, and let's answer some of them. All right, so this is. Do you think regulators even understand the difference between DeFI and CFI?
00:24:49.544 - 00:25:29.274, Speaker B: Well, my answer to this a year ago would have been no, but my answer now is yes, they do understand. They actually. I think the average regulator understands this stuff better than the average person on CT. But I think some of the aggressive stance does actually not come from the lack of understanding, but actual conflict of interest between, you know, how DeFi might potentially disrupt traditional finance.
00:25:30.094 - 00:26:16.296, Speaker A: And, you know, there's a crooks of the conversation, at least for regulators, is who is liable, right? Or like, who, like, if we are a regulator, who do we regulate? Do we regulate the protocol? Do we regulate the people? Do we regulate, you know, the community? And there is a question of, like, trying to understand who are the regulars gonna go after? And, you know, the argument that that is live today is you know, we need to regulate the decoders or that. You probably heard the term on Twitter, like the super shadowy coders. That was a term coined by. Was it Yellen? I'm not sure. Someone. Someone from the. I forgot who it was.
00:26:16.296 - 00:26:42.394, Speaker A: But there is somebody on the. In Congress or. Yeah, yeah. So that was very interesting. So I think that regulators know, but they don't know who to put into, like, who to hold accountable. Yeah. So the next one is, can Alameda manipulate serum tokens legally?
00:26:46.134 - 00:27:07.604, Speaker B: Well, I mean, market manipulation is never legal. Yeah, especially given how unlikely serum was a commodity. Oh, there's probably rules around marketing manipulation for commodities, too. I'm not an expert, but market manipulation is never legal.
00:27:07.764 - 00:27:17.024, Speaker A: I mean, you could argue that serum was already manipulated by only providing 3% of its total supply to investors.
00:27:17.804 - 00:27:25.304, Speaker B: There's probably some very specific definitions for, quote unquote market manipulation, but not a legal expert. So.
00:27:25.684 - 00:27:43.048, Speaker A: So next question is, oh, so what's happening with serum? Are they forking, you know, all the protocols that, that FTX launched? I've heard of one, yeah, I've heard of some rumors.
00:27:43.176 - 00:27:44.924, Speaker B: I don't know what's happening there.
00:27:45.264 - 00:28:17.094, Speaker A: Serum is being forked because serum is obviously central to a lot of the DeFi protocols. And so there are a group of people that I know are looking to fork serum or have fork serum already without the token as a way to provide this as a. As a greater utility for the Solana ecosystem. I did hear about that multicoin catching a lot of smoke. Do you want to address that, Chub?
00:28:17.954 - 00:28:37.128, Speaker B: I mean, there's nothing I know that the public doesn't know. I mean, yeah, I think their lp letter was. Got leaked or something, and. And obviously, they invest in FTX, and they had, like, some unordered of 10% of their exposure on FTX as well.
00:28:37.216 - 00:29:22.158, Speaker A: So, yeah, look, I mean, the game, like, the. The whole venture capital, like, industry is predicated on, you know, backing great founders. You know, obviously, there are going to be mistakes that happen, you know, whether intentional or unintentional, and there is going to be, you know, reputational hit based on what those founders do, and to the extent that they do it. And, you know, I think it's one of those cases where multicoin backed Solana and then in return backed FTX and serum, and, you know, one of those investments turned out to be really bad for them.
00:29:22.206 - 00:30:01.314, Speaker B: So we, we discussed this yesterday just among us, and the question I asked was, would VC's have been able to, you know, catch this hole if they really did due diligence, and the answer was yes. And there were two red flags. Really major red flags. One is the lack of independent board on FTX, and two is their auditing firm made up auditing firm. The first accounting firm in the metaverse. Can't remember the name.
00:30:02.214 - 00:30:41.724, Speaker A: I forgot what it's called. But, yeah, they apparently were the first gap audited exchange, and it turned out to be some auditing firm that is primarily in the metaverse, quote, unquote. And if you look on the Twitter handle, hopefully we'll share it after this call. But, yeah, it was something like shady auditor and, like, some bespoke country. But, you know, that's, like, more on the growth side, on the early stage side, like, when you're investing in a seed round, it's very hard to differentiate. Like, a bad. Well, you know, like, usually during a seed round, you're not, like, asking the founder to create a board.
00:30:41.724 - 00:31:00.692, Speaker A: Right. Or others. So this diligence should have been given to the later stage investors, like the series a and b. And those are the ones. I mean, like, ultimately, it's. The onus was on them to do that. And I'm actually very surprised, because sequoia, I mean, they've been around.
00:31:00.692 - 00:31:50.510, Speaker A: I mean, they pretty much started the venture capital business, and they read this. Like, they wrote this article that talked about effective altruism and why Sam is the next Elon Musk. And quite surprisingly, I'm surprised that they didn't catch this. And it tells you a lot about our venture industry generally, which is that a lot of it is just social signaling, and it's just a bet on the founder of what they see on Twitter and, you know, the product and et cetera. And I feel like that needs to change because it's primarily driven around that. It's never driven around, like, actual, like, let's sit down and figure out X, Y, and z. Like, a lot of the work that we do within the alliance is making sure that there's product market fit, there's validation for the founders.
00:31:50.510 - 00:32:10.664, Speaker A: They find the first 100, 200 customers, and so we see the users. But if you go on, like, out in just the industry generally, like, primarily, it's just like, okay, what are you pitching? Okay, we'll invest, like, fine. But I think there needs to be more work around diligence and, like, working with the founders and understanding what they're building, who they are.
00:32:12.004 - 00:32:15.104, Speaker B: Everyone assumes everyone else has. Has done the due diligence.
00:32:15.684 - 00:32:16.464, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:32:19.364 - 00:32:19.772, Speaker B: Not the.
00:32:19.788 - 00:32:35.444, Speaker A: Right. Yeah. I mean, I think that is one area that that needs to change on the venture side. Okay. So chow got caught in the crosshairs with the private chat with deleted users. Give us details.
00:32:38.824 - 00:33:16.312, Speaker B: By the way, I left the group chat, so I don't even know the details anymore. But the context was Almeda's fundraising deck was being circulated among private telegram groups. And I saw the deck myself. I had no intention to invest, but people who know me know that I always try to give a balanced view on things. And by the way, that was 2019. I didn't know Sam at all. I had just heard of Alameda and how they dominated the market.
00:33:16.312 - 00:33:53.134, Speaker B: So I provided the stuff I heard of, which is Alameda was a very dominant market market maker. And I also saw their p and l chart, which is basically in the pitch deck, which was a straight lineup that was extremely controversial. I also saw that they were raising at an interest rate of 15%. People were really shocked by that. I'm not sure why, but that 15% is very standard. In the last two years, by the way, a lot of market makers have been borrowing at a rate similar to that. So these are the things that I mentioned.
00:33:53.134 - 00:34:42.640, Speaker B: And at the same time, in the same group chat, I provided skepticism. I said that this high risk, no return quote that I put in the pitch deck is just pure amateur. But, yeah, so that's basically what happened. I think, you know, in hindsight, my alert level wasn't as high as it should have been. The high return, no risk. The next time you see I or anyone else sees that, just, you know, you know, it's probably a. A scammer.
00:34:42.640 - 00:34:45.684, Speaker B: Just don't. Don't dissociate from them.
00:34:46.344 - 00:35:19.130, Speaker A: But the thing is, like, you know, this was so early on. We're just coming out of a bear market, and so, you know, like, we see, like, hundreds of pitch decks, and, you know, we don't know which one is going to do what in the next two to four years. Right. So this was just your two minute overview of what you skimmed, and you gave feedback on it and you moved on. Right. Who would have known that? You know, they went on to become this big exchange that crashed and hurt a lot of people. So I feel like it was just a very modest feedback that you gave about albedo.
00:35:19.130 - 00:35:26.134, Speaker A: Yeah. Will crypto VC's continue to prefer tokens over equity?
00:35:30.314 - 00:35:54.184, Speaker B: Every market cycle in the past, in every bear market, VC's prefer equity over tokens. In the bull market, they start preferring tokens over equity. And founders know that in the bull market, they raise for a token. And in the bear market they raise for equity. So it's a cyclical thing. So in the next couple of years, probably we're going to see more equity deals.
00:35:55.484 - 00:36:39.826, Speaker A: Yeah. And the question also is like, where does value accrue for the company in the long run? Right. I think that is still a question, especially given where we are with regulations and what the token can actually do. Primarily, tokens are launched as a governance token, but how does value then accrue back to the token? You can't distribute profits back to the token holders. And so there are so many different regulatory regimes that tokens have to follow, especially given the fact that there is this classification of securities tokens or securities. And if you are deemed a security by providing profits to your shareholders or your token holders, then you are a security. So right now, governance tokens are meaningless.
00:36:39.826 - 00:37:01.626, Speaker A: And the way they add some value is by giving you some rights into how things should be voted. But then again, there's a lot of, like, theatrical, you know, ways where you can change the scale of the vote or the weight of the vote. And we could talk a bit about that later, but. Yeah, so that's kind of.
00:37:01.690 - 00:37:01.906, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:37:01.930 - 00:38:02.474, Speaker A: And then the other is like, we're starting to see a lot of startups add more businesses. Right? So, like, a great example of this is Stepn. And stepn first launched its program, which is like run to earn, et cetera, turned out to be very, you know, a lot of users, and they ended up launching an exchange under the fine Satoshi brand, and then now they're launching other product lines. So owning equity in the long run is going to be beneficial for the. For investors and the community members, because long term, there could be a lot of great products that can come out of these great companies. What were people saying about salmon FTX behind the scenes? Okay, why don't we just talk about what we thought of him?
00:38:04.294 - 00:38:09.194, Speaker B: I mean, we already shared what we thought of them two episodes ago on the podcast.
00:38:09.774 - 00:38:11.594, Speaker A: Well, we were very unbiased.
00:38:11.974 - 00:38:56.484, Speaker B: I tried to be unbiased. I always tried to. You were not unbiased. You. I mean, we just called it out as it was. But I think the first red flag for me that happened around three months ago when Almeda, or when Sam went on out lots with Joe Weisenfell and he bashed crypto. He crashed trash talk crypto, and he called crypto like Ponzi or Pym or whatever, something like that.
00:38:56.484 - 00:39:45.834, Speaker B: The whole episode was the first time I realized Sam was not a true believer in crypto. But even then, there was nothing that really suggested to me that he would have played with customers money. Three weeks ago, we learned that Sam was backing DCCPA, the bill that would have killed Defi secretly in DC. He was lobbying for that bill in DC. We wrote a thread from. Originally, the thread should have come from my personal account, but we decided it should come from, should go out of the airline's official account. But we cut out the bullshit that was happening behind TCPA.
00:39:45.834 - 00:40:15.392, Speaker B: That was the time I realized that Sam was a bad actor in this space. He was a net negative to this space. But again, there was no suggestion evidence that Sam was playing with customers money. And so when the collapse happened last Tuesday, I was pretty shocked. The first day I was shocked. The second day, I was angry. The third day, I was laughing at this whole thing.
00:40:15.392 - 00:41:25.184, Speaker B: It was so absurd that I started just laughing at ourselves as an industry. But, yeah, that's how my view has evolved around Sam. I know what some founders who were new to this industry thought of FTX and Sam, and I've spoken with founders who raised from FTX or Alameda, and some of them had been in this space for a while, for many years. Others were new to this space, but they all thought that FTX played a pivotal role in the rise of Solana, which, by the way, was true. But they also, the tone that I heard was that they thought Alameda and FTX were good players. And in private, I expressed my skepticism to them without knowing that the FTX was even committing fraud. I just expressed skepticism because I saw how Sam was not a true believer in this space, and he was backing TCPA.
00:41:25.184 - 00:41:29.124, Speaker B: So those are some of the things I've heard.
00:41:30.744 - 00:42:14.204, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I've heard very similar things, in fact, specifically with Alameda and founders. What I heard was Alameda is known to quick, were quick to dump tokens on founders, very quick. And it obviously, like, you know, as much as we all hate to say, but, you know, the health of the token, you know, is important for the community, is important for the founder, and, you know, they keep an eye on it. And when you bring Alameda onto your. To your round and they get a significant amount of liquid tokens in return, you know, that could be dumped on founders. Right. And so I've heard stories of that from.
00:42:14.204 - 00:43:03.676, Speaker A: Directly from founders where they will do that. SAM just generally, you know, from a long time, I'd say over the past year, year and a half, I never considered him as part of the core crypto group. His ideas and thoughts were, you know, very institutional and against the crypto ethos. But that didn't make me feel like, I didn't feel like it was a red flag. Maybe it was good for adoption in the long run, bringing on great institutions, etcetera. But as the DCC Pa came around, that's when his true color showed, which is that he will kill the ethos of crypto so that his institution can thrive. And if that's the case, then, you know, that is someone that is very negative to the industry.
00:43:03.676 - 00:43:30.512, Speaker A: And so our manifesto that was published on Twitter on October 13 was one of the biggest momentum shifts in regards to how serious people should be taking this, and, in fact, brought on a lot more people to go against Sam, along with, like Eric Voorhees doing this debate on bankless in regards to DCCPA.
00:43:30.568 - 00:43:40.304, Speaker B: So the first tweet, as far as I've seen, was against them, was one confirmations tweet.
00:43:40.384 - 00:43:41.064, Speaker A: Richard Chen.
00:43:41.144 - 00:44:04.844, Speaker B: Yeah, Richard. It was a short tweet, but obviously started the whole thing. The second tweet was ours, and we detailed why DCCPA was bad for the industry. And that was probably the thing that kick started this whole change of opinion on public opinion on Sam.
00:44:05.924 - 00:44:36.244, Speaker A: But then, you know, what's also interesting is, like, you know, people are, like, usually not saying most, but a lot of people are afraid to talk or call people out on Twitter. You know, and there is that notion of, you know, like, when is the right time to call someone out? I know there's a core group of, like, Ethereum, maxis that do this very often to the point where it just becomes noise, but there are times where they're right. And so the question is, you know, how should we think? How should we be thinking about this?
00:44:37.144 - 00:45:27.884, Speaker B: I mean, when we were preparing for that thread on Twitter, we were debating whether or not we should do it. Just imagine how much, like, how much we would have lost if we were wrong, right? Like, the downside was not immediately clear to us. That would outweigh the upside for us to call out someone like that before it was popular, before it was consensus against a really powerful player and all their allies. Ultimately, we made the call to do it. And in hindsight, I think we could have been more aggressive. And it was my failure to not have been more aggressive when I first saw the podcast, a lot. In fact, I subtweeted Sam several times without you did.
00:45:27.884 - 00:45:52.076, Speaker B: I don't know if you. Anyway, the tweets are still out there. But I said something like, we can't let someone who got so astronomically rich within the cycle represent our industry. If that person does not believe in crypto, go ahead.
00:45:52.100 - 00:46:21.992, Speaker A: So the odd lots conversation, if you listen to it, there's a part where he talked about a black box. Do you remember that? Yeah. He's like, well, you have this black box, which is like, let's assume it's a protocol that issues a token. Everybody knows that. It's a protocol that issues a token. Nobody really knows what's inside of it, what it's doing. And so you could effectively launch this black box or this protocol that may have no value or utility, but you could issue a token against it.
00:46:21.992 - 00:47:09.924, Speaker A: You can get a bunch of buyers that are willing to buy it and set up market price that they deem to be fair, and from that, you could collateralize and borrow against those tokens. He was pretty much explaining what he was doing exactly, which is insane. He was talking about what he was doing. There was six protocols that he launched where he was effectively doing that. All right, next question. Say you're running a DeFi project, and Alameda was a significant holder of both equity invested and invested tokens. Your cap table is in disarray.
00:47:09.924 - 00:47:11.064, Speaker A: What do you do?
00:47:12.684 - 00:47:22.698, Speaker B: Yeah. So this touches a broader topic on Solana. Like, if you're a Solana project, what do you do? But let's address the first specific question.
00:47:22.866 - 00:47:23.574, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:47:26.034 - 00:47:29.974, Speaker B: I mean, is there anything you can do at this moment, immediately?
00:47:32.394 - 00:48:07.828, Speaker A: If Alameda is a significant holder? There's not much you could do in regards to. I mean, there was an exchange, right? They gave you capital in return for future equity or tokens. And so the way you'd want to think about this is like, you know, you have to allow the liquidators do their job in regards to where the token is going to go and how it's going to sit and how it's going to get distributed. I mean, this could take ten years, by the way. I mean, like, if you look at, like, Mount Gox, it took them over a decade, and people still haven't received their tokens.
00:48:07.916 - 00:48:16.230, Speaker B: My Gox coin, or they still haven't been given back to me, and it's been like, eight years.
00:48:16.382 - 00:48:55.764, Speaker A: Yeah. So I guess, you know, there's some assurance that at least your tokens won't be sold against you for a very long time. And so that's like one, right? Two is, you know, if you want to change the cap table or, like, bring on more healthier investors, and if you're doing, depending on where you are in the project cycle, it might be good for you to raise some capital and increase your Runway and bring on more diversity of investors on your cap table. And that is pretty much predicated on where you are in terms of success, et cetera. I guess those are like two immediate feedback points I can give.
00:48:55.844 - 00:49:40.990, Speaker B: As for Solana in general, I think right now the consensus view is that Solana equals FTX. FTS goes down, Solana is fucked. I hold the opposite view. I think that view is wrong. That consensus view is wrong. I think if this whole FTX thing happened a year ago, yes, I would have agreed that Solana is probably setback for many, many years because FTX back then was a dominant player in Solana. It's true that FTX was responsible for the early growth of Solana, but it's been a year now, it's been more than a year.
00:49:40.990 - 00:50:48.374, Speaker B: And I think, relatively speaking, FTX and Alameda are less dominant of a player. It's no longer an indispensable player in the Solana ecosystem because Solana actually attracted a bunch of really high quality developers. And why can I say that with confidence? Is because we receive, I review, 1000 applications to alliance per quarter and the stats shows that 20% of our applications are super high quality Solana developers. And so Solana has definitely reached this critical mass of developers, quality developers. I would actively bet against that consensus view that Solana is going to die with FTX. Now, obviously there's still a risk, because right now I think that all the Solana developers are in a sort of prisoner's dilemma kind of mental state. Meaning they're looking up to each other, right.
00:50:48.374 - 00:51:20.414, Speaker B: If they're peers are going to leave Solana to join, let's say, abduls or sue, they're probably going to do that too. But if their peers stay in Solana, they're probably going to stay as well. So it's a prisoner's dilemma. So I think ultimately it boils down to the leadership of Solana in the deaths that Solana devs look up to. So they need to take leadership to rally everyone around. And I think they're doing that. So we'll see how it plays out.
00:51:22.034 - 00:51:25.054, Speaker A: Yeah. My two cent on that is.
00:51:28.674 - 00:51:28.938, Speaker B: I.
00:51:28.946 - 00:52:30.084, Speaker A: Think this is the rallying moment for Solana. What we're seeing is Solana. If you look at all the layer ones today, a lot of the organic growth outside of Ethereum and the layer two s Solana is like number two to Ethereum and all the layer two. So I'm putting that aside. And so what they should focus on, which I'm hearing they are, is visiting founders, getting them back to focus on building in the space, making sure that they confirm that Solana is here to stay and it's going to be successful in the long run. The other thing is, I'm kind of like, I hate to say this, but it's better that it happened now than later. And the reason for that is, if Solana gets bigger and FTX starts to continue being a large part of the Solana's ecosystem, who knows what the ecosystem could look like in the future, right? Given how much of a central point serum plays into a lot of these DeFi protocols.
00:52:30.084 - 00:52:45.914, Speaker A: So even though I find this to be very bad and horrific, getting serum and the Sam out of the Solana defi Solana ecosystem is probably going to make it much more stronger in the long run.
00:52:47.054 - 00:53:03.104, Speaker B: That's what I said to our Solana founders as well. The alternative that FTX does not die is probably a worse universe, parallel universe, than the one that we live in.
00:53:05.404 - 00:53:11.664, Speaker A: What's next question. What surprises me is paradigm. I mean, Fred built Coinbase.
00:53:14.644 - 00:53:18.236, Speaker B: Surprising in what sense? That they backed FTX.
00:53:18.340 - 00:53:19.024, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:53:22.164 - 00:54:17.714, Speaker B: I mean, it feels like it was Mat that led the investment. I mean, it's against my speculation, but Matt is the one who tweeted about FTX. But I feel like in general, for those mega funds, they tend to have someone internally who would vouch for a potential investment and try to push internally within the investment committee. So there's usually one person within the investment committee to lead the investment. And so they probably vote or something. I don't know how the system works, that paradigm, but it feels like Fred was not directly involved. But again, that's my speculation.
00:54:19.574 - 00:54:44.810, Speaker A: Yeah, similar to yours. Next question. Would love your take on the healthiest approach to centralized exchange regulation. Let's all assume we all love DeFi, but centralized exchanges are necessary bridge for now, should still be lose, should be still be used less than more. So I guess an example of this. Yeah, go ahead.
00:54:44.962 - 00:56:04.040, Speaker B: I should have a prediction for this for the coming years. Again, at the beginning of this session, I mentioned that the biggest elephant in the room is the fact that with FTX, or even centralized exchanges in general, in crypto, you have the front end, the user front end, retail user front end, the matching engine, the clearing, the settlement, and the market maker. In the case of Alameda, all these things are lumped together into one giant entity. And I was actually debating with Kyle like it's still on Twitter. I was debating with Kyle a few months ago. Kyle was saying this is a huge innovation I said this gave huge perverse incentives to those giant entities to do potentially bad things to their customers, and FTX did. So my prediction for the next few years is there's going to be more push from users, like actual demand from users and definitely the community to decouple all these different layers of the stack, from the front end to the settlement, to the matching agent, to the clearing to the market maker.
00:56:04.040 - 00:57:01.760, Speaker B: I think that has to happen. If that happens, then we're going to have a solution where you as a user, you store your money, let's say, in some custodian, but you trade your assets on a centralized exchange, and these two will be totally separate. If you look at how trapfire works, trapfire is decoupled when you open, let's say, a fidelity account, and fidelity is your user friend end. But fidelity, I don't believe they hold your money. Your money is probably held at a bank or something, or a prime broker, and the trade is done. The matching engine, at the matching engine level at Nasdaq or NYSE. And if you trade derivatives, there's a separate clearinghouse that would clear your derivative trades.
00:57:01.760 - 00:57:44.404, Speaker B: All these things are decoupled in tradfi. I think we're going to see something similar in crypto with the centralized exchanges, and I hope that the leaders at those centralized exchanges will push towards that vision as well. Obviously, it's going to be a humongous task when it comes to the tech, the organization, the logistics, the legal. It's a big challenge, but I think we're going to see that. And if we do see that, we're going to have a solution, a c five solution. That's, again, it's still worse than defi, in my opinion. I just want centralization, but it will be close to what we have in DeFi in terms of security for users.
00:57:47.184 - 00:58:27.954, Speaker A: Two additional points to Nolan's question is proof of reserves. What are your thoughts on that more or less regs for centralized exchanges? I think personally they're all good snapshots, but everything could be faked, right? As you've seen with Gate IO and crypto.com comma, they were sending each other funds back and forth so that they can create the snapshot of their proof of reserves. And so exchanges, especially that are offshore outside of the US, it's very hard to hold them accountable for anything, really, and it's up to them on what they can do based on a jurisdiction they're out of.
00:58:28.874 - 00:59:01.222, Speaker B: The other really obvious way to fake the proof of reserve is, let's say the exchange has $10 billion worth of customer deposits, but no one knows. And then they show a proof of reserve for $5 billion and claim that they have $5 billion worth of customer deposit. How would you ever know that there is a $5 billion hole? You can only prove, like, you're proving a equals b. Right? But the proof of reserve only shows a. You can never prove b. Right?
00:59:01.398 - 00:59:19.154, Speaker A: I mean, this is like back to 2008. Like re hypothecation of assets, right? Like people just borrow against assets that just. It's like recursive and the whole ship can just blow up just based on people acknowledging that there's money in someone's balance sheet. But we don't know.
00:59:21.034 - 00:59:29.002, Speaker B: By the way, I'm not saying proof of reserve is useless. It probably has some utility, but it's not sufficient. That's what I'm trying to say.
00:59:29.138 - 01:00:09.044, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm actually very bullish on Coinbase's NPC tech as well. The NPC wallet, obviously, is the ability for Coinbase to Coinbase and the. The user to custody their own assets where they own it, right? And it gives Coinbase some sort of like, security clearance over your assets so that you're able to go out and do whatever you want, whether it's to protect your assets, whether it's to use the assets on Aave or Uniswap or whatever. But I'm pretty bullish on Coinbase's MPC tech.
01:00:09.584 - 01:00:36.912, Speaker B: The NPC tech is actually in line with what I mentioned earlier about decoupling. Right. Like, when you use the Coinbase NPC wallet, you're basically using Coinbase as the front end, but you still have. You're basically doing self custody well in a semi custodial way alongside Coinbase, but it's far more decoupled than things currently are.
01:00:37.088 - 01:01:35.364, Speaker A: So what's interesting, that over the past hour, we were talking about just Sam FTX centralization, it turns out a lot of our solutions to these problems are protocols and crypto. Just generally the wallet, the NPC tech. What we were talking about is a multi party computation, which is essentially a bunch of keys that represents the private key. You hold one of three, maybe two of three is held by Coinbase. Their acknowledgement to validate your key so that you can host a transaction or post a transaction. And it turns out like Aave Uniswap and all of the infrastructure that's behind it. It's more important than today that technologies like this need to be in place versus giving our trust to a group of people that will manage the capital on behalf of us.
01:01:35.364 - 01:01:48.966, Speaker A: Given the fall of Voyager, Celsius, the arrows and et cetera, I think it's more important than now that we use DeFi and wallet infrastructure.
01:01:49.110 - 01:02:22.974, Speaker B: Yeah, and in fact, if you look at the data from this past week, I think there was a lot of data suggesting that DeFi usage has gone up across spot exchanges as well as decentralized exchange. In fact, last week, in the top hundred assets on Coingecko, the only two, maybe a handful, but two of the assets that were up, that stood out to me was GMX and DYDX. Everything else was down like 20% to 50%.
01:02:24.474 - 01:02:39.178, Speaker A: So the future is there if you could look for validation for DeFi. All right, thoughts on twelve week digital dollar experiment launch? Yeah, I saw this announcement. I think this was yesterday or today.
01:02:39.306 - 01:02:40.294, Speaker B: What is that?
01:02:42.114 - 01:03:12.894, Speaker A: So the New York Federal Reserve and partnered with a bunch of global banks to launch a twelve week digital dollar pilot. Interesting timing. In fact, this was, oh, today, this was 2 hours ago. And so CBDC, right. Central bank, digital currencies, timing wise is very interesting because it was right at the end of the collapse of FTX.
01:03:14.274 - 01:03:30.062, Speaker B: You look at everything that happened over the last week, it's very hard not to get conspiratorial. Very hard. The NYT article that spoke positively about, about Sam and, you know, previous one negatively about Coinbase, it's, it's absurd.
01:03:30.238 - 01:03:42.274, Speaker A: I mean, Sam's, I don't want to put my tinfoil hat on here, so I'll pass on this. What are your thoughts about the Solana Defi state now?
01:03:47.394 - 01:04:14.464, Speaker B: I mean, Solana just lost a major market maker and a major venture investor. So in the short term, Solana is going to hit. But as I've said many, many, many, many times in the past, the only leading indicator that you should care about when it comes to future growth of an ecosystem, layer one ecosystem is the number of high quality developers. That's the only thing I'm tracking.
01:04:16.804 - 01:04:56.406, Speaker A: Yeah, same. I mean, like if you look at, you know, Solend, I think Soland's at like $30 million tvl now. I mean, at one point they were at like a couple hundred million, I think a billion. At one point they're during the bull market. Obviously it's inflated, but Soland and many of the core protocols to defy are still building. In fact, many of the startups are, as chao mentioned, that have applied, many of them are coming from the Solana Defi ecosystem and we're talking like incredible founders in the space. And so the growth of talent isn't going to stop what happened with the liquidity crisis within Solana's Defi ecosystem.
01:04:56.406 - 01:05:35.434, Speaker A: Yes, there is enough liquidity, obviously, in the space to help scale the DeFi products, but I think that's probably true for many areas of Defi today, except for, like, uniswap, Aave and compound and synthetix. And so I think over time, that will be resolved. But for now, I think it's just really putting your heads down and, like, building and coming up with some great products that could solve the catastrophes that we went through over the past couple weeks. With FTX gone, there's a void for non Kyc perps. In your opinion, who is the front runner in that category?
01:05:36.854 - 01:05:49.062, Speaker B: I mean, right now, by the numbers, it's GMX. And yeah, Dy DX is doing Kyc. Right. So dy DX is out of the question. I mean, by the numbers, use GMX.
01:05:49.118 - 01:05:51.670, Speaker A: Wait, why is dy DX out of the game?
01:05:51.702 - 01:05:52.834, Speaker B: Don't they do KYC?
01:05:54.774 - 01:06:25.110, Speaker A: What they do is they don't allow you. Like, it's a VPN or it's a IP block. Right. So if your ip is originated from us, you can't trade on platform. And they will do, like, random id verification check, which I think they stopped from what I remember, because people found that to be annoying. And so I think they stopped it. But I think DydX, you can still trade, technically, outside of the US.
01:06:25.302 - 01:06:49.744, Speaker B: Okay. I haven't used DUI DX in a very long time. You know, the last, last time I looked at DyDX as a user was like a year ago, and back then there was no. I can't remember when that was, but there was no Kyc. I remember at some point they started doing some Kyc stuff, but I didn't follow the details. But, like, even if you include Dy DX, I think we had the numbers. I think GMX is number one.
01:06:49.744 - 01:07:09.414, Speaker B: The top Defi protocols right now are by. By seven day. Fees are uniswap Lido, if you consider as defi pancakeswap.
01:07:09.494 - 01:07:17.038, Speaker A: GMX pancakeswap. Yeah. Wow. Binance change is still alive and thriving.
01:07:17.166 - 01:07:18.062, Speaker B: That's right.
01:07:18.238 - 01:07:34.084, Speaker A: Very surprising. Yeah. Dy DX, I think, is, and others are front running right now on that side. What does FTX blockfi collapse mean for crypto? So many regular people won't trust crypto anymore.
01:07:34.384 - 01:08:04.490, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, that's right. What's gonna happen in the next two years is obviously, average users are not gonna trust crypto. Regulators, policymakers are not gonna trust crypto. They're gonna try to deploy aggressive regulations. I'm not even speculating. Like, this is something that happens over and over again in history. Every time shit like that happens, you get more aggressive regulations.
01:08:04.490 - 01:08:46.703, Speaker B: It's just history. It's not even my speculation. And developers, builders that last year there were a lot of web two builders that joined web three, and we're not going to see that. We're going to see much less of that in the coming years. So the combination of these three things means that the industry has probably been set back, has been set back for at least a year or two. But the silver lining is that in 2014, I said to myself, after Mount Gox, I said to myself, there's no light at the end of the tunnel. Like, this is a nuclear winter.
01:08:46.703 - 01:09:27.854, Speaker B: There's no way crypto is going to come back for the next five years. And yet crypto came back in 2017. And what led that? Well, obviously, the 2017 bull market was, it was not pretty. It was led by icos, but icos were fundamentally enabled by Ethereum. Ethereum was fundamentally an innovation when it comes to programmability, layer one, programmability. So in my opinion, that the 2017 bull market was actually led by tech innovation. The 2020 2021 bull market, in my opinion, was led by the Fed, mostly.
01:09:28.474 - 01:09:30.706, Speaker A: Sir Jerome Sergeant Rome.
01:09:30.810 - 01:09:45.214, Speaker B: So, point being, yes, it looks like it might feel like there's no light at the end of the tunnel, but if we can build real products, real innovation in this bear market, the bull market is going to come back sooner than you expect.
01:09:47.634 - 01:10:41.180, Speaker A: Look, crypto is very volatile. You're going to have euphoric moments and you're going to have moments where things are going to completely die out. That's just what an emerging technology is going to feel like. The difference with this sector versus any other sector that has ever come out is that there is a, there's a financial asset that is directly tied to the industry, and everyone's net worth is a part of that industry as well. So this becomes a very emotional game or industry for everyone that's building in the space, including people that are looking in to build. And so it's very different than your average industry. Like, if you look at artificial intelligence or machine learning, there isn't your, your net worth isn't tied to those industries except for the startups that you build, right? In this case, everything is a part, like everything that you do is a part of this industry, including your net worth.
01:10:41.180 - 01:10:51.604, Speaker A: So it is a very polarized effect compared to any other industry. But I mean, that's why I'm here for it, right?
01:10:51.684 - 01:11:05.934, Speaker B: The market that, the price and the token is a magnifier of everything. In the bull market, the price attracts, growing price attracts more people. In the bear market, the falling token price makes people more skeptical about this field.
01:11:08.994 - 01:11:17.498, Speaker A: All right, how bad is the contagion? How many companies VC's are hit? What we'll see coming out contagion is obviously not over.
01:11:17.546 - 01:11:44.804, Speaker B: There's going to be more dominoes to fall. But I mean, again, the liquid funds are probably hit, the VC's probably less. So unless they also run a liquid on which a lot of them do. And I don't know, like, that's the only thing that came to mind. Do you have anything, any insights?
01:11:45.104 - 01:12:32.234, Speaker A: Yeah, I mentioned this a bit earlier, which is like 7% of all of crypto funds AUM in the industry has been affected. So between one to 5 billion, I'd say probably two to five, two to 3 billion from the investor side. On the startup side, on average, I've seen about 50% Runway cut for those investors or for those startups that have put some assets on FTX. I haven't seen startups shut down yet. Maybe I've seen one on Twitter that talked about it publicly. So obviously, like, Runway is cut short, and so they need to either come with, get to product market very quickly, or they need to turn it off and return the money back to their investors, which is probably a diligent thing to do, or raise more capital depending on where they are in the product lifecycle.
01:12:35.654 - 01:13:40.392, Speaker B: Part of the question was, how much worse can this get? Well, I said earlier there will be more dominoes to fall, but I think it's very hard for things to get meaningfully worse than they already are today, meaning FTX was so dominant, so big, that after the fall of FTX, it's very hard for someone else, like for someone else to create a much worse impact. That entity to fall, that domino to fall, needs to be even bigger than FTX. If they're smaller than, the impact, is marginal, is incremental. And I think there are only, the other day I was thinking about this, and there are only two things that I can think of that, that if they fall, it's going to be much worse than, it's going to make things, much worse than things currently are. And those two things are, number one, the collapse of a major stable coin. And by the way, I don't see any evidence of that. And the second thing is the collapse of a major crypto bank.
01:13:40.392 - 01:14:02.704, Speaker B: A bank that banks crypto startups. If the bank runs into a bank run, then it's nuclear. Winner. All the startups are fucked, by the way. There's no evidence. I haven't seen any evidence of that either, just to be clear.
01:14:03.164 - 01:14:38.750, Speaker A: Well, there's another one, which is probably the last or the final boss. You remember that meme where you had the grim reaper that goes, knocks on each door, and then there's like an x mark, the final microstrategy. Microstrategy or Sir Michael Saylor. Some people consider him not human, and so he's not. He can't be on that list. I tend to agree with that. So, yeah, I mean, that could happen.
01:14:38.750 - 01:14:59.104, Speaker A: I mean, like, I mean, everything's on the table. I wasn't gonna. I didn't see FTX on my. On my. My list here. So I think his, uh, position, like, I think he could be liquidated at 13 five was what I saw last bitcoin, where he has to post up, like, $400 million more in collateral, but. Yeah.
01:14:59.224 - 01:15:00.884, Speaker B: How much bitcoin do they all?
01:15:01.744 - 01:15:04.200, Speaker A: 2 billion, probably.
01:15:04.232 - 01:15:05.124, Speaker B: More billion.
01:15:06.904 - 01:15:08.384, Speaker A: I think. More. I'm not sure.
01:15:08.464 - 01:15:20.894, Speaker B: Again, like, even if $2 billion, I mean, it's going to have some market impact, for sure, but 2 billion for half a trillion dollar asset class, it's not too bad.
01:15:21.594 - 01:15:27.094, Speaker A: But he owns. Oh, okay. It's at 3.4 billion.
01:15:28.794 - 01:15:43.004, Speaker B: More importantly, if microstrategy gets liquidated, it's just liquidation. It's not a reputational damage, as much as FTX has done to our industry. The main problem with is the fraud, is the reputational damage.
01:15:45.144 - 01:15:59.056, Speaker A: Cool. I think those are it for our questions. So want to thank our audience for tuning in and listening and asking some great questions. Do we want to share some. Maybe some lessons learned before we tune out?
01:15:59.240 - 01:16:03.124, Speaker B: Yeah. You want to go first or.
01:16:04.224 - 01:16:41.194, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, look, for me, it has been that, well, this is just me observing what I've observed over the past two years is the fear of missing out or the FOMO piece. Right. And this has become probably the single largest problem that I see in our industry, which is this whole ape first culture. Right. If you. If you remember that. That, you know, there's opportunity costs if you don't ate first, and that has kind of, like, propagated to.
01:16:41.194 - 01:17:22.586, Speaker A: To everyone in the industry. Right. If you look at why, you know, three arrows went down, or why Sam went down, or. Or terra Luna, whoever, it's this idea that, you know, like, you need to go in and you need to go heavy and lever up, because you know that there's a missing of an opportunity and you're starting to see, you saw, you saw this with investors, too, if you remember over the past year, two years, like, if we didn't commit within 24 hours of an opportunity for a startup, that, like, we, they would just move on to another investor that would commit first. Right. And so that put a lot of pressure on us to commit. But, you know, thankfully, we focus on our diligence for the most part.
01:17:22.586 - 01:17:37.454, Speaker A: I mean, there were times where we also committed, but there is this kind of industry wide push to fomo in on opportunities and go all in. So I feel like that's one area that I think that we all could improve on as an industry.
01:17:44.194 - 01:18:23.524, Speaker B: The funny thing about both SPF and three arrows was that they both talked about linear wealth. I don't remember back in the day, basically. Well, just in short, linear wealth means like, well, the implication is if you see an opportunity and if you think the expected value is positive, you're going to go all in. You don't care about risks of total ruin. And they both bragged about being a linear wealth seeker. And look down on the log, wealth seekers. Well, it's fine if you're a linear wealth seeker.
01:18:23.524 - 01:18:34.184, Speaker B: It's, you know, I don't care. But if you, if you're gonna play, if you're gonna pursue a linear wealth, don't borrow money from others. Don't play with the wealth of others.
01:18:34.964 - 01:18:36.024, Speaker A: No, leverage.
01:18:36.364 - 01:19:15.954, Speaker B: Don't, don't leverage. The lesson being, next time you see linear wealth seekers, don't lend them money. It's destructive. And don't leverage recklessly. The famous Charlie Munger quote, there are three ways our smart man can go broke. Liquor, ladies, leverage the three L's. And that was leverage was the thing that everyone from Terra to three arrows to Celsius to Alameda committed.
01:19:15.954 - 01:19:57.154, Speaker B: So that's one lesson, I think that another lesson is, again, like the separation of market makers, clearing settlement, matching engine user, friend end. We need to get that done in the coming years. Another one would be, you know, just be more aggressive in calling out bad actors. And, I mean, I failed at that. I should have done it much earlier, much more aggressive. But we can't let bad actors, we can't give them the second chance. What else?
01:19:58.494 - 01:20:00.214, Speaker A: For custody, go ahead.
01:20:00.254 - 01:21:09.134, Speaker B: Yeah, self custody. I mean, it's fine to use centralized exchanges for trading, but for custody, do self custody, or if you're an institution, use a reputable institutional custodian. And one thing I really want. I came across this problem myself yesterday. This pain point was, why is there not a decentralized, stable coin that I can trust my crypto there? Because the alternatives right now are putting your money on a centralized exchange or putting your money in a centralized stablecoin, which, by the way, also has counterparty risks. Even if you do self custody, there's counterparty risks because you don't like the US dollar that's backing the stable coin that has counterparty risks. So I would love for us to have a really good, decentralized stablecoins in the coming years.
01:21:10.794 - 01:22:09.904, Speaker A: For me, some of the areas, and I think a lot of. Part of the FOMO culture that crypto built was also propagated by media, which is, they largely don't know what they're talking about, and you don't know what happens behind closed doors. And so the narratives that are built, like, for me, the biggest narrative that I questioned was, like, SBF's, like, rise to fame, right? Why is it that, like, the media, you know, created this monster as an example, right, in a way that ultimately hurt our industry? What are the diligence that they do? What are. I mean, like, someone. And so what are the messages that they're putting out there? Why are they doing this? And so what you see in the media, don't, like, always be skeptical and don't use that as a way to validate or invalidate your thesis. Like, think about it and start to do reference checks. And don't let that.
01:22:09.904 - 01:22:45.292, Speaker A: Don't let the media decide what you want to. Like, how are you going to make. Do your. How are you going to move forward? So media is, like, large part, don't believe it, be skeptical, and then do proper diligence. You. I'd say the other is like. Like, a lot of assets, a lot of founders, like, were hurt by the FTX situation, where they put their assets on FTX.
01:22:45.292 - 01:23:57.912, Speaker A: So I always tell our founders that you should have a redundancy plan, right? So, like, even though Coinbase is the most valuable and, you know, secure exchange today in the world, make sure you have a redundancy plan where you have some on, you know, fire blocks, you have some on Coinbase and in your traditional banking account, because ultimately, you'll never know what's going to happen. And so always have a backup plan. And then the last thing I just thought of was just going back to my first point, which is, like, you'll see a lot of narratives. The biggest narrative that I saw was Brian against FTX, hence, why we did our podcast around Brian and Sam, and you'll see a bunch of people that will validate a thesis that may not be true. And so, again, when you see these narratives play out, make sure that you do your own proper diligence and you don't like, ape in or automatically trust the assumptions of people that are providing that assumption for you. I see this happening all the time. And so, in introspect, just, like, think about it and make sure you make the calls the way you think they play out.
01:23:57.912 - 01:24:09.654, Speaker A: So those are just, like, some final tidbits on that. Cool. All right, well, thank you for tuning in, and we'll catch you again on episode seven in two weeks. Thanks so much.
01:24:09.774 - 01:24:10.674, Speaker B: See you later.
01:24:11.134 - 01:24:14.854, Speaker A: Thanks for listening to good game. Don't forget to subscribe. We'll see you next week.
