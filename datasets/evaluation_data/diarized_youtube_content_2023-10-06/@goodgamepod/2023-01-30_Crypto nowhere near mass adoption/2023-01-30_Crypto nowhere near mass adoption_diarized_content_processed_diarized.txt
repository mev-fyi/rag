00:00:00.160 - 00:00:21.510, Speaker A: I feel like for at least growth crypto, there still is so much work that needs to be done in order for us to get mass adoption right. We have. I don't know, I've mentioned this before, probably like 1011 million monthly active users. They're using metamask, and I'd say maybe 50% are using DeFi. I'm just throwing out a number. I don't even think it's that much. I think it's just a million users less.
00:00:21.510 - 00:00:40.164, Speaker A: So at least with like traditional growth startups and companies, they have users, they have real product, they have revenue. Defi, and like crypto generally aren't nowhere near where traditional companies are right now, is the way I see it. So what you're saying is if the narrative holds true, then I think crypto growth assets will get affected much more.
