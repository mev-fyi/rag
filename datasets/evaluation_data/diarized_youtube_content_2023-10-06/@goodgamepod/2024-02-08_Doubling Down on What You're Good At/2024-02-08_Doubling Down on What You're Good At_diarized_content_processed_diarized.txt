00:00:00.200 - 00:00:44.952, Speaker A: We don't want to be this chain where you deploy nfts, you deploy all sorts of random stuff, social stuff. I think we have built our whole product around speculation. People come to able to trade perps options or speculate on these like premarket launches. Can we just like double down on that and build other stuff which are in the same vein? So stuff like prediction market, sports betting. I think the type of user who comes and trades at Jupiter pre launch is also interested in doing a prediction market. I think we need to build something where the core culture of the chain is sort of very focused around one thing and in our case it's just like speculation. Like people actually bridging to able to use the market.
00:00:44.952 - 00:00:48.704, Speaker A: So I do think we want to build stuff in a similar vein as well.
