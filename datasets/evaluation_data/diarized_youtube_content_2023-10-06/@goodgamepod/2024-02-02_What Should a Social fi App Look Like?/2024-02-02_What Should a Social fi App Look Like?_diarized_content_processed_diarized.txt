00:00:00.160 - 00:00:37.488, Speaker A: What should a socialfi app look like? I think you and I have chatted a lot about this in detail, but to me in crypto, I think the idea of being able to trade personal token assets is still very big. I remember during the hype cycle of runtech people wanted to know who were the undercover or lower follower count Twitter gems that have a lot of alpha or value. And so they started buying up all of these like keys of these users. And so I'm just going back to speculation. People want to speculate on people. I think that's still going to become very important. I don't think chat is a way to differentiate.
00:00:37.488 - 00:00:43.056, Speaker A: Like offering chat is not going to give you anything of value. You can't predicate your product on chat.
00:00:43.160 - 00:00:52.504, Speaker B: The chat is a distraction. Actually the token is what makes it interesting. It's a whole new asset class and people want to gamble on people. It's so obvious that behavior.
