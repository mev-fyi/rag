00:00:00.120 - 00:00:38.626, Speaker A: I don't find music nfts that interesting. I think they will be a thing. In the same way that you collect some limited edition albums or CDs, right? Of your favorite rapper. I think that will be a thing, but it won't be as big of a game changer as NFTs in games, or certainly not PFPs as digital nations. I think where the intersection between music and crypto will happen is not nfTs. It's the other point that you mentioned, which is the fan engagement. I don't think that has to do with NFTs music nfts per se, but you may have to do with the concept of daos, this community aspect of crypto.
00:00:38.626 - 00:00:41.834, Speaker A: I don't know exactly what it is, but that's my gut feeling. I would agree with that.
