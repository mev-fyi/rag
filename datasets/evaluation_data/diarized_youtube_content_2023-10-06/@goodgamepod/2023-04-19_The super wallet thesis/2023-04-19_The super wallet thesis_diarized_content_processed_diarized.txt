00:00:00.200 - 00:00:18.110, Speaker A: Any predictions from you chow super wallet thesis of course. I think not only are we going to see more financial applications built into the wallets but also social and gaming. There could be one or two de facto like web, three social platforms and they will be built in into the wallets and the wallets are going to have a lot of power. Obviously account abstraction is a big deal.
00:00:18.182 - 00:00:19.182, Speaker UNK: I'm going to see much.
00:00:19.238 - 00:00:53.034, Speaker A: Better user experiences interacting with complex smart contracts, not having to sign every single transaction, bundling all the transactions, et cetera. Mobile wallets of course. Oh multi chain wallets. I just can't see myself using six different browser extensions to access six different chains. It's gonna be one wallet that will allow the user to seamlessly interact many different chains and potentially not even having to store assets on the different chains to store asset on Ethereum but bridging natively in the wallet and access the other applications on the other chains.
