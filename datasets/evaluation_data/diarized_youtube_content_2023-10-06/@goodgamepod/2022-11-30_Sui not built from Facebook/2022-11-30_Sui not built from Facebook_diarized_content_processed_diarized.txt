00:00:00.330 - 00:00:33.734, Speaker A: Well, is this based on the technology we develop at Facebook? Right, at Meta? There's a lot of underlying technology, yes, that we start developing, thinking of them back then. But the big difference is we did not take that blockchain and using it, right. We decided to build something from the ground up. This whole concept, the data model being objects, are completely new. So even our version move is significant change. We really pretty much design and build everything from the ground up. So that's the biggest, I think misunderstanding by everyone.
00:00:33.734 - 00:00:44.260, Speaker A: But almost everyone is like, oh, you guys came out of Facebook Meta. Is this based on DM? It's not, right? It's actually almost very, very little code come out of that DM code base.
