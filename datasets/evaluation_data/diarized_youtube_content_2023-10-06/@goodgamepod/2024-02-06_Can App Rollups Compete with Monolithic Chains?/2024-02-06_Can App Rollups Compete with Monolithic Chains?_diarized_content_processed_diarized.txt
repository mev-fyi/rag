00:00:00.250 - 00:00:04.190, Speaker A: Welcome to good game. Your no BS insights for crypto founders.
00:00:07.410 - 00:00:42.998, Speaker B: I don't think it makes sense to just keep jumping to the hottest chain of the month. You sort of just lose your community every time and I think your brand and sort of your whole message gets really diluted if you just keep jumping around or you just deploy in like a hundred different places. Yeah. So I think as the founder, you need to just choose, like where you want to be built, who's your sort of core community, which sort of tech you want to align yourself with. I mean, crypto is very tribal, so I think being part of no tribe is worse than being part of one tribe. So, yeah, I think we have chosen to be sort of ethereum aligned. I like Ethereum.
00:00:42.998 - 00:00:53.738, Speaker B: I think we have the community from Ethereum since day one, all our tvls, sort of from the Ethereum ecosystem. So yeah, we are sort of like doubling down on the ecosystem.
00:00:53.834 - 00:01:23.862, Speaker A: Looking for your next startup idea in crypto? Check out our request for startups list and get inspired at forward slash ideas. Welcome to good game. Today we're going to have the founder of Avo and Ribbon on. Julian Co. Julian's been, I'd say, probably one of the OG builders in the space. Now, he originally worked at Coinbase in the early days. I would say he's probably one of the first batches of Coinbase employees to leave Coinbase to start a startup in the early days.
00:01:23.862 - 00:01:32.154, Speaker A: So I would say the wave of 2020, there was a batch of founders that left. I mean, yeah, there were batches before, but I would.
00:01:32.192 - 00:01:34.598, Speaker C: Before they all started funds, Fred.
00:01:34.694 - 00:01:52.750, Speaker A: Before they all started funds. That's right. You had scalar capital, you had polychain. Polychain. Oh, Nick Tamino at one confirmation. So those were like the early phased. I would say they were the 2013 to 2017 cohort, right.
00:01:52.750 - 00:02:20.038, Speaker A: I think 2017, 2020, that bear market pretty much killed Coinbase because 70% of the people quit or it was like 50% of people quit. Do you remember that or. No, they got let go. It was like a very large number. It was either that they were let go or they quit, because at that point, no one knew if the industry was going to be around any longer, if you remember that narrative. And then I think the batch after is where crypto solidified. There was products people were using.
00:02:20.038 - 00:02:37.086, Speaker A: It was much more clear that people from Coinbase can leave and start a startup. And I think internally within Coinbase, they actually made this kind of like a mandate where they can work on projects on the side. So, yeah, it's really cool to see some startups like this come back around. We've known Julian for a long time, but yeah, I'm really excited about this.
00:02:37.188 - 00:03:08.594, Speaker C: So Julian built ribbon, which was the first structure product D five protocol. That was 2020. Arguably he's part of that D five summer cohort ribbon, at least was. And then at some point, I think last year, they pivoted into decentralized options. And I just checked the numbers today they are number one decentralized options protocol by quite a large margin. Number one in terms of trading volume. That's the metric that really matters for exchanges.
00:03:08.594 - 00:03:32.078, Speaker C: And then a few months later, he also launched a decentralized perp protocol. It's fairly new, so they are not among the top protocols yet, but they're getting there. Also, an alliance alumni, alumnus, and he came back a few times to give talks to our founders. He's one of those crypto standard, pretty experienced, have seen at least two cycles now.
00:03:32.164 - 00:03:55.986, Speaker A: Yeah, he's probably one of the few founders that actually stayed back on Ethereum and doubled down on Ethereum. So he ended up building out Avo via an app rollup and using celestia as a data availability layer. So the question here is, I'd love to compare and contrast that versus those that are building on, let's say, solana on a monolithic chain.
00:03:56.098 - 00:04:01.386, Speaker C: I feel like Avo is like the first app rollup in production, right?
00:04:01.488 - 00:04:02.346, Speaker B: They are.
00:04:02.528 - 00:04:06.406, Speaker C: And the second roll up to use Celestia.
00:04:06.518 - 00:04:08.486, Speaker A: The first was Manta. Right, Manta.
00:04:08.598 - 00:04:10.234, Speaker C: First one is Manta, who was also.
00:04:10.272 - 00:04:53.578, Speaker A: Part of our batch, both Ribbon, Avo and Manta, and Caldera, who's also doing app roll ups. I want to learn more about if founders were to look at the space. You and I have chatted about this before, but building on app roll ups from the outside perspective sounds very kludy and very cumbersome. The question is, is it really? And can developers that are building in the EVM space get on board and build on an app roll up and a data availability layer? Easily? And what are the cost savings? What are the design choices against Solana? And are they both comparable? Because I think the narrative has been skewed mostly on Solana, rightfully so, because great products, great teams and all of that.
00:04:53.664 - 00:04:56.300, Speaker C: Well, I think that's because the max is all went to.
00:04:57.150 - 00:05:10.906, Speaker A: Ah, so the narrative has been invisible for crypto Twitter, but probably still very vibrant. But that's happening on forecaster.
00:05:11.018 - 00:05:11.438, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:05:11.524 - 00:05:48.890, Speaker C: Did you see the Franklin Templeton tweets about Solana and Ethereum? What did it say, just tweeted a bunch of. Just both posted about Solana in one tweet and then ethereum in another tweet. But the Solana one ratioed the ethereum one, so that's one data point. And then last week, Hayden, founder of Uniswap, tweeted about who's the best chain, which included Taco Bell, Ethereum and Solana. And again, Solana ratioed ethereum, which is really surprising, given in theory, how many ease holders there are in the entire world.
00:05:49.040 - 00:06:19.954, Speaker A: Recently, Chris Dixon went on a book tour for his new book. He was on Andrew Sorkin's talk show or whatever. He does this bit every 30 minutes or once a day on stuff and money. And he talked about the bitcoin ETF and how of a positive impact it was. The very next thing he said was like, oh, and the Solana ecosystem. We're talking like primetime CNBC, and usually the narrative is bitcoin and then ethereum. Interestingly enough, it was bitcoin and then solana.
00:06:20.082 - 00:06:22.242, Speaker C: Who brought it up? Andrew or Chris?
00:06:22.386 - 00:06:24.370, Speaker A: Andrew did. Not even Chris.
00:06:24.530 - 00:06:25.350, Speaker B: Andrew did.
00:06:25.420 - 00:06:33.042, Speaker C: Chris is not a Solana guy. Andreessen is not a Solana firm. They haven't made any investments in Solana except for Solana itself.
00:06:33.116 - 00:06:34.538, Speaker A: There's no way Chris Dixon would bring it up.
00:06:34.544 - 00:06:34.714, Speaker B: Right?
00:06:34.752 - 00:06:35.894, Speaker C: Yeah, they're eth aligned.
00:06:35.942 - 00:06:37.446, Speaker A: They're more ETH aligned than Solana.
00:06:37.478 - 00:06:37.674, Speaker B: Right.
00:06:37.712 - 00:06:47.370, Speaker A: For Andrew to bring it up, of all people, tells me that even retail or even people that are outside speculators are seeing the Solana narrative.
00:06:47.450 - 00:06:49.962, Speaker C: You know who else talked about Kathy Wood.
00:06:50.106 - 00:06:50.462, Speaker B: Yes.
00:06:50.516 - 00:06:51.438, Speaker A: Yes, she did.
00:06:51.524 - 00:06:55.870, Speaker C: She's like, solana is the next crypto asset to get an ETF after Ethereum.
00:06:55.950 - 00:07:24.090, Speaker A: It seems very consensus. So. Which is why I think, interestingly enough, today, standard big talked about the ETH ETF launching potentially in May. So it might be a good time to swing back and see what's going on on Ethereum. And that's why we have Avon, to learn more about the interoperability challenge that founders face. And is it really a challenge? Or it might be a slower chugging for now, but maybe in the long run it might be the better move.
00:07:24.160 - 00:07:24.442, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:07:24.496 - 00:07:31.638, Speaker C: I'm very curious why he stayed on Ethereum versus Solana, knowing that he's actually also bullish Solana.
00:07:31.734 - 00:07:34.526, Speaker A: Yeah, he has a big bag of Solana, from what I heard.
00:07:34.628 - 00:07:44.826, Speaker C: And I'm also curious why he picked an Ethereum roll up as the app chain rather than what DyDX did, which is Cosmos SDK.
00:07:44.938 - 00:07:47.794, Speaker B: That's right. Yeah. It seems like there are a few.
00:07:47.832 - 00:07:59.878, Speaker A: Front runners in the derivative space and they're all kind of going this route, which is either like an app specific product versus building on a monolithic chain or a L2.
00:07:59.964 - 00:08:28.686, Speaker C: We talked about this a year ago, more than a year ago. That was before conduit and Caldera even existed, which is like, we kind of saw that launching a app roll up would be the end game for all the ETH aligned protocols. Because there's no other way. There's no other ways to do this. Even if you go on a generic L2, like arbitram or autism, you're still competing for block spaces with everyone else. And so the only thing for you to do once you've reached PMF is to do your own roll up.
00:08:28.788 - 00:08:49.782, Speaker A: So this begs the question for Solana. Yeah, you talk about localized fee market dimensionality of fees. Sorry I had to use that word because that's how they describe it. It turns out that I've talked to a bunch of Solana founders, and that narrative might be way ahead of where.
00:08:49.836 - 00:08:53.362, Speaker C: We are right now, meaning it'll take time to ship.
00:08:53.426 - 00:09:28.866, Speaker A: We have a long way to go before this actually gets implemented the right way, and things could break. It's not efficient, from what I mean. It's just going to be very interesting to see how what founders will do that are building on Solana. Once there's like this threshold, you know, obviously you got to wait for hardware to scale, things like that. You have localized fee market, and then you have now ethereum starting to come back up with the app roll ups. Things are working, and we're seeing founders that are building successfully using these types of infrastructure. So, yeah, it's just fun to see how this is all going to play out.
00:09:28.968 - 00:09:30.578, Speaker C: Cool, let's have him on.
00:09:30.664 - 00:09:33.054, Speaker A: All right, let's bring on Julian.
00:09:33.182 - 00:09:55.574, Speaker C: Julian is a founder. He's a builder of crypto derivatives protocols, but he himself is also a trader. We're going to talk about why founders should trade use their own product. But I love to talk to Julian about his trading experience. I know he trades perps, options and meme coins. Meme coins are a big topic these days, so we'll talk about that. We'll also talk about Julian's downer journey.
00:09:55.574 - 00:10:09.690, Speaker C: I remember talking to Julian last bear market when he was still at Coinbase. Or maybe you were doing some, I think at that time, you were doing some projects for tazos, I think, and you were also doing some site tazos.
00:10:09.850 - 00:10:11.966, Speaker B: Yeah, it's like two cycles ago.
00:10:12.148 - 00:10:37.906, Speaker C: Two cycles ago. Yeah, and you were doing some liquidation bots, and you talked to me about matrix port, which, by the way, is the company of Jihan, who liquidated the market a month ago. His intern liquidated the market a month ago. Matrixport was the original inspiration for the original version of Ribbon. And then later on, you started building options and imperps so we can dive into all that journey.
00:10:38.018 - 00:11:20.310, Speaker A: I want to learn more about your move to working with conduit as an app roll up for founders. Like, what was experiences like? I know you compensate a lot of fees for the users. Curious to see how that's going. Celestia, I think you just announced a partnership with Celestia. So what are the cost reductions like? Is it real? And how easy is it for you to move from Celestia to, let's say, prototynct sharding or other types of layers? And really, how did you get your first few customers when you started ribbon? I'm curious about that as well. You mentioned on one of your pods that you've built some relationships with users to the point where you could start any product and they'll always be there for you. So I'm curious on how you build those long term partnerships there.
00:11:20.310 - 00:11:53.242, Speaker A: But obviously, there's a lot to talk about. But the first thing on my mind, and I think on everyone's mind, is the Jupiter Airdrop tomorrow. And it's funny, Avo has kind of become the kind of the price discovery platform for all tokens that are about to launch. Dimensions is another one. The list goes on and on. And so maybe with Jupiter, you've mentioned that you've used the product and you trade as a founder, so maybe kind of talk through the Jupiter airdrop, how has it been from a user acquisition perspective, and then maybe talk a bit about trading, et cetera.
00:11:53.306 - 00:12:28.266, Speaker B: Maybe I'll start with the genesis idea of why we created. We were basically the first guys in DeFi to try this free market stuff, like FTX tried this back in the day. They listed Coinbase stock before Coinbase IPO. That was such a crazy market to trade. They did this crazy trump market as well, which was really fun and interesting. So I think subconsciously these ideas were already in my head. But, yeah, maybe just six months ago, one of the more interesting or hyped projects, say, binance sort of announced, like they were going to list, say, on their launch pool or something like next week.
00:12:28.266 - 00:12:32.346, Speaker B: And I think within our office, who was it, say from?
00:12:32.448 - 00:12:34.442, Speaker A: You were talking about you were launching it or another exchange?
00:12:34.506 - 00:12:35.966, Speaker B: No, Binance was going to list it.
00:12:35.988 - 00:12:36.394, Speaker A: Binance.
00:12:36.442 - 00:13:31.326, Speaker B: Okay, Binance announced, okay, we're going to list, say, next week, and there are a bunch of traders in our office and we're all just trying to guess, do we think it's going to be over under a billion? Like, everyone's sort of guessing where the price is going to be. And we just had this idea, like, okay, what if we just made a market for it and we just launched it on, like, what if we made this into a perp that people could just trade on abo? Would that even be feasible? So that was the idea. We basically came up with this sort of combined what FTX did and sort of put it in like a Dex style format. And it was really interesting. I mean, I think the market was already immediately somewhat efficient, like the launch price or where we opened the market ended up being pretty close to where binance launched it. We just kept doing it again and again. And each time we did it, more users came onto the platform, more people wanted to speculate on these things.
00:13:31.326 - 00:14:11.782, Speaker B: So it has somehow naturally become one of the things Avo is most known for. Like the Jupiter thing has been basically the biggest one so far by a lot. There are all these YouTube videos about airdrop farming and Jupiter Airdrop, and all these guys teaching Jupiter Airdrop recipients on how to hedge their airdrop on Avo. So it's really become like a big thing. But, yeah, I mean, for Jupiter specifically, it's an amazing product. I think the team there has spent the last two years grinding it out and the product is almost perfect. I think they work on every small optimization from how quickly tokens show up on your feed.
00:14:11.782 - 00:14:37.446, Speaker B: They care about the little details. So I think it's like a really amazing experience. I personally really like the DCA function. It's so easy to sort of like, I mean, on Ethereum, if you want to get in or out of a token that's illiquid, you're not going to sit there and click transactions for like 6 hours. Right. So you're just going to say exactly. Oh, I'm just going to take the 2% slippage or 5% slippage and just do it right now.
00:14:37.446 - 00:15:05.470, Speaker B: Exactly. So, yeah, I think Jupiter has somewhat unlocked this new type of trading behavior where if I'm in something really liquid, I know I can tee up every minute for the next 24 hours and my price impact is pretty low each time. Yeah, it's great. I mean, I use it all the time. I think they're going to crush it. I do think it's sort of become like the rallying cry across the whole ecosystem. And, I mean, they do deserve it.
00:15:05.470 - 00:15:19.202, Speaker B: Yeah. Where the market is going to actually launch. I think it's going to be very interesting. Currently, the prices are like between six b to seven B FTV. My guess is it's going to trade around there, but, yeah. Very interested to see what happens tomorrow as well. Awesome.
00:15:19.202 - 00:15:20.194, Speaker B: Six B.
00:15:20.312 - 00:15:23.662, Speaker C: Isn't that higher than uniswap or close to uniswap?
00:15:23.726 - 00:15:24.900, Speaker B: I think it's higher.
00:15:25.270 - 00:15:26.462, Speaker A: That's fDv.
00:15:26.526 - 00:15:27.342, Speaker B: Yeah, fDv.
00:15:27.406 - 00:15:32.018, Speaker A: So people are trading on the market cap, I think, which is at 1.3 billion circulating.
00:15:32.114 - 00:15:52.222, Speaker B: It will be bigger than unisoft. I think they have, like a million people who are excited about this. So I think just the momentum behind it is going to be a very big launch. And if you care about fundamentals, they also do have revenues and stuff like that from their perps product, so you can justify why it may be actually more valuable. By the way, Julian, did you see.
00:15:52.276 - 00:15:55.040, Speaker C: Hayden's tweet the other day? Which is the best?
00:16:00.370 - 00:16:01.258, Speaker B: Taco Bell.
00:16:01.354 - 00:16:07.086, Speaker C: Taco Bell, yeah. Not Chipotle and Ethereum. Solana. Do you think he's going to Solana?
00:16:07.198 - 00:16:22.770, Speaker B: No, I think just like, culturally, I think they've built their whole identity around the theorem ecosystem. I don't think he'll ever sort of leave the. You know, I'll be very impressed if he does. I think at this point he won't.
00:16:22.850 - 00:16:24.550, Speaker C: Are you going to Solana?
00:16:25.210 - 00:16:49.854, Speaker B: We have thought about it. I think I'm, like, a big fan of Solana. I own a lot of soul. I use the ecosystem a lot. I think as bullish as you guys on it, but I do think as a project, I don't think it makes sense to just keep jumping to the hottest chain of the month. You sort of just lose your community every time. And I think your brand and sort of your whole message gets really diluted if you just keep jumping around.
00:16:49.854 - 00:17:15.218, Speaker B: Or you just deploy in like, 100 different places. Yeah. So I think as the founder, you need to just choose where you want to be built. Who's your sort of core community, which sort of tech you want to align yourself with? I mean, crypto is very tribal, so I think being part of no tribe is worse than being part of one tribe. So, yeah, I think we have chosen to be sort of ethereum aligned. I'm obviously still. I like Ethereum.
00:17:15.218 - 00:17:26.234, Speaker B: I think we have the community from Ethereum since day one, all our tvls, sort of from the ethereum ecosystem so, yeah, we are sort of like doubling down on the ecosystem. Yeah.
00:17:26.272 - 00:17:52.654, Speaker A: You're seeing that with magic Eden, right? I mean, magic Eden went from focusing purely on Solana, where they had a very strong community, to focusing on other chains. And the people on Solana felt neglected, and so then they realigned with tensor, and then if you look at magic Eden across the board, they probably have sparse usage across some chains, but heavy usage on bitcoin. So I think what you're saying is true, which is founders should be focusing on one ecosystem to build very few defi protocols.
00:17:52.702 - 00:17:55.086, Speaker C: Actually succeeded by going multi chain.
00:17:55.198 - 00:17:55.522, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:17:55.576 - 00:18:10.082, Speaker C: The other example I can think of is Opensea. Opensea went to Solana last cycle, didn't do any volume there. The only app, it's not really a protocol, it's an app that I can think of that is succeeding. Going multi chain is phantom.
00:18:10.226 - 00:18:13.002, Speaker B: And I think Phantom is doing pretty.
00:18:13.056 - 00:18:24.446, Speaker C: Well on Ethereum, still far behind metamask, but they have like 100,000 users. But I think there's a fundamental reason behind that is because people hate managing five different wallets. Much easier to use one and to.
00:18:24.468 - 00:18:50.794, Speaker B: Use five, I think. Yeah, we've just seen, I like to think about it as if a lot of projects, they don't know what to build next. They just deploy the same thing on somewhere else, and they hope that will magically bring or fix all the problems, but that's usually worse. And, I mean, there are these apps who just list, like, oh, we are on 20 different networks, but 99% of them drive zero value. It's just more and more management, more headaches.
00:18:50.862 - 00:19:04.170, Speaker A: I think the only startup that did well in the early days was Ave, where they launched on every EVM chain, and they ended up just becoming the de facto liquidity layer for all those chains. But that was just because of. I think it was just early in luck.
00:19:04.990 - 00:19:40.100, Speaker B: I do think their market share has also been cannibalized on different ecosystems, like arbitrum has their own native lending or whatever. So it's not clear to me that there's really no moat. Yeah, exactly. I think if you are lucky enough to be the biggest player on one of the biggest chains, you should just focus on that. So I think our goal now is just like, we want to be the biggest prop decks on Ethereum. That's like a big enough market for now, and then we can focus on different things adjacent, but we don't want to be the decks that's on five different chains and just sucks across the board.
00:19:41.050 - 00:19:47.702, Speaker A: Well, you decided to move to conduit because of that. Right. And you were the first customer there.
00:19:47.756 - 00:19:50.920, Speaker B: Yep. The first customer to launch like a.
00:19:51.630 - 00:20:06.398, Speaker A: That's pretty. I'm sure a lot of founders would have been scared to do that. What did you see so clearly on why Avo should have been an app roll up? What were the design decisions you made as a founder to decide that you're going to go app roll up?
00:20:06.484 - 00:20:26.414, Speaker B: Yeah. So this was over a year ago. I think even the word op stack was not a thing. No one mentioned the op stack as a stack that people could use. Even base wasn't even born yet at that point in time. But I think we felt already that obviously we couldn't build on Ethereum mainnet. Like the gas was just too crazy.
00:20:26.414 - 00:21:16.526, Speaker B: The next alternative is like, do we build on another layer one salana, maybe something else. But for the reasons I said before, we wanted to stay on Ethereum. So I think the next natural sort of progression was like, okay, do we build on arbitram or existing L2s? Or sort of like, can we just build our own L2? And I think for many reasons, we decided just to choose the latter. Some examples is like, we felt it was really important for an exchange to have an isolated execution environment. So, for example, we saw this when Arbitrum dropped their token, right? Like the whole chain basically was unusable. All the explorers were going down. And I think it's really bad experience for users if some other random app on the chain takes down the whole chain, especially if you're trying to trade.
00:21:16.526 - 00:21:46.122, Speaker B: So I think we felt like, can we build this one chain that's sort of focused around trading for now and wouldn't get clogged up by some NFT mint. That was sort of one of the major considerations. We also wanted to change some of the parameters around the default layer. Two parameters like optimism and Arbitrum have this seven day withdrawal window. We thought that didn't really make sense. If you are using Avo as the exchange, you're trusting the exchange. Like our order book is sort of off chain.
00:21:46.122 - 00:22:28.934, Speaker B: You already have a bunch of trust around this application. You don't actually need this crazy seven day super long dispute, period. I think we felt like we could just shorten a lot of that and improve the UX. I think we felt that if no exchange in the world charges you a percentage point to withdraw. But if you use a bridge, if you want to bridge 10 million out of arbitram or optimism, you got to pay some basis point on that transaction, which is like really insane. For an exchange, every exchange in the world, you just pay the move $10. So I think, yeah, we just felt like even if we keep the seven day period and use all these bridges, the UX would just be like terrible.
00:22:28.934 - 00:23:07.960, Speaker B: So I think that's some of the reasons why we decided to do our own app roll up. And sort of the decision then became like, do we build it ourselves? Do we run all this infrastructure in house or could we work with a different company? And actually like, funny story, there was a different company which we were trying to work with. They're now called Kildera. Maybe you guys are investors, I'm not sure. But yeah, we actually used them for, okay, cool. We actually used them for our testnet for the first few months while we were building it. And yeah, like one month before mainnet, paradigm basically were chatting with us and we were like, oh, by the way, we're incubating our own version of this.
00:23:07.960 - 00:23:42.878, Speaker B: And I think at that point we were already pretty locked into Kildera. But after speaking to their team and just knowing for sure that I can call the CTO of paradigm and say, yo, the thing's not working. That was pretty good security. And also we were like the first customers. They offered us pretty good terms. I felt like their team was pretty stacked on a DevOps background, so we felt more confidence in sort of using them as a team. And yeah, I think we had one sort of opportunity to move before Mainnet.
00:23:42.878 - 00:23:52.630, Speaker B: I think once we had already done mainet, we don't want to move anymore. So we just decided, yeah, let's make that switch to conduit. Yeah, they've been great so far, so no regrets there.
00:23:52.700 - 00:24:01.254, Speaker C: I think today. By the way, I'm familiar with the backstory of volume switch because I was talking to Caldera. Why is their first customer switching to their biggest competitor?
00:24:01.382 - 00:24:03.626, Speaker B: And we're like, just scratch our head.
00:24:03.648 - 00:24:06.630, Speaker C: And we're like, the only possible reason is paradigm.
00:24:06.710 - 00:24:07.820, Speaker A: Oh, that's right.
00:24:09.150 - 00:24:10.794, Speaker C: It's the only possible reason.
00:24:10.912 - 00:24:36.098, Speaker B: To be fair, there was no pressure. I think there was no sort of, oh, you have to do it as a portfolio company. Obviously we can make our own choice. I think we just felt like since we were getting sort of like vip service from them to just make this happen, make this deal work to our favor. I mean, they were also just trying to get off the ground. So I think it worked out for us. I think we got some pretty good terms on the economics as well.
00:24:36.098 - 00:24:52.298, Speaker B: I've heard these roll ups now have to sort of do some sort of sequencer, rev share and stuff like that. But I think we were pretty firm in having it being fixed fee only. If we were ever to do rev share, I wouldn't want to use it. So that was sort of baked into our deal on day one.
00:24:52.384 - 00:24:57.834, Speaker A: So what are not your terms, but like the average terms that founders would have to think about?
00:24:57.952 - 00:25:32.630, Speaker B: I actually don't know what the market is at right now, but I've heard through the grapevine some of these newer customers are paying some sort of rev share on the sequencer fee or something. So you pay per month or something. So the calculus in my head is like, is this cheaper than hiring one full time DevOps engineer in house? And it was, yes. And I get like a 24/7 DevOps team who's pretty good with strict slas and so on. So I think the choice for me is pretty clear. And yeah, they've been good so far.
00:25:32.700 - 00:25:38.434, Speaker C: The users of Avo, what token did they use to pay for the transaction fees?
00:25:38.562 - 00:26:27.030, Speaker B: So yeah, that was like a key part of our design as well. We didn't want users to pay for transaction fees at all because I think if you're trading on an exchange and let's say you want to do a million dollar order, I don't want you to think about is it cheaper from a gas perspective, if I do like ten hundred k trades or just one big trade, I don't want the number of actually orders that you send in to cost you something from like a mental calculation. I think we just decided we need to make it feel like a centralized exchange. I can literally spam as many orders as I want and I don't pay anything for it other than transaction fees, like actual exchange trading fees. So yeah, I think we just decided we are just going to subsidize all gas for users. All transactions that happen on the chain, we pay for it. And yeah, users just don't feel that at all.
00:26:27.030 - 00:26:52.154, Speaker B: I think even if it's like tiny, the mental stress of thinking about is this adding up in the background is really bad. So we just made it basically free. From a gas perspective, do you accrue value right now? Yeah, we have trading fees and that's sort of where we make all the money. What we subsidize is just the cost on our users don't take gas fees.
00:26:52.202 - 00:26:54.398, Speaker C: But there is a trading fee that.
00:26:54.404 - 00:26:59.230, Speaker B: They pay to you, which is sort of like in line with the other exchanges.
00:26:59.310 - 00:27:02.030, Speaker C: It's in line with centralized exchanges.
00:27:02.110 - 00:27:03.010, Speaker B: Right? Yeah.
00:27:03.080 - 00:27:09.106, Speaker C: And recently you started using Celestia as your DA layer. Talk to us about that decision.
00:27:09.218 - 00:27:42.762, Speaker B: Yeah. So because we subsidized this gas, there were like three major things that changed in Q four. One of them is our users started going exponential. I think now we have about 15,000 daily actives and about 30 something thousand weekly actives. So it's a lot of small accounts, just like trading, trading, trading. Each time they trade, we pay for the gas and Ethereum started going up in price and the Ethereum chain got more congested. So it's like a triple whammy for us in terms of how much we were spending on gas.
00:27:42.762 - 00:28:28.878, Speaker B: Yeah, I think within Q four itself, it went from, definitely changed what we expected in terms of the economics. So Celestia was just getting up and going. We spoke to them and I think we just realized that if we can switch the DA layer to Celestia, that cost becomes effectively close to zero, and that's another two hundred k a month in our pocket, which we can give back to users in different ways. So we thought that was like the best business decision to do at that time. Celestia was just like getting their main net up. So I think we were like, okay, let's try to be like customer number two of Celestia on main net. Yeah, we just made it happen, like, last week.
00:28:28.964 - 00:28:30.746, Speaker C: First customer was mental.
00:28:30.778 - 00:28:31.678, Speaker B: Right? Yeah.
00:28:31.764 - 00:28:42.834, Speaker C: So effectively, when you switch from Ethereum to Celestia for DA, you almost reduce the fees by 100%. Close to 100%, is that what you're saying?
00:28:42.872 - 00:28:55.686, Speaker B: Yes. It's like in the 90s, it's like extremely dramatic drop in Da fees, and that is like our biggest cost. So I think it made sense from a business perspective, for sure.
00:28:55.788 - 00:28:59.658, Speaker C: From what I've heard, 48, 44 doesn't even come close to that.
00:28:59.824 - 00:29:31.150, Speaker B: Right? Yeah. So that's what we have heard as well. I think a lot of people have different benchmarks and numbers, and ultimately it really depends on the actual usage of the protocol. Yeah, I think it's still a market, still like a bidding market for this blob space. So I think we don't actually know exactly how much cheaper or more expensive it's going to. Yeah, I mean, I think if it's sort of like dramatically, if it's in line with Celestia, maybe we would shift back to native Ethereum. Da.
00:29:31.150 - 00:29:32.418, Speaker B: Why would you do that?
00:29:32.504 - 00:29:36.070, Speaker A: Is it just being ethereum aligned or. I'm just curious.
00:29:36.890 - 00:29:53.194, Speaker B: They're just like less trust assumptions if the DA is on Ethereum as well. Now you're sort of trusting that the ethereum to celestia, communication is sort of secure, but I think it's like a fine trust assumption for now. But, yeah, we'll see how four it goes.
00:29:53.312 - 00:29:54.454, Speaker A: What about Eigen?
00:29:54.582 - 00:30:09.486, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, Eigen we also spoke to. They're great. I think they're going to do very well. The main issue for us was just they were not live, so we couldn't really consider it. We could wait a few months and pay another half a mil or million bucks in gas, but we didn't really want to do that.
00:30:09.588 - 00:30:15.170, Speaker C: Is there any reason for you to use more than one DLA for, I don't know, data redundancy purpose?
00:30:15.510 - 00:30:48.618, Speaker B: Yeah. So when we actually did this Celestia thing, it was sort of a partnership with conduit as well. They helped us build it, and there's this sort of fallback system that they have. So if Celestia goes down for any, like, the sequencer can basically just post DA back to Ethereum. So there is an easy baked in switch to just either post in two chains at once, or fall back if necessary. So we felt like that was good as well, just in case selvester goes down or something.
00:30:48.784 - 00:30:51.150, Speaker A: When Eigen on Avo.
00:30:52.210 - 00:30:52.960, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:30:53.650 - 00:30:56.634, Speaker C: Everyone always asks pre token per prelaunch.
00:30:56.682 - 00:31:40.918, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm sure it'll trade at like ten BFDB or more, but I think what I've learned, making these markets or launching them is the best time to do it is maybe a month or two before the actual token launches. I think if you launch, for example, layer zero is a good example. They have been teasing this token for so long, no one knows when it's going to launch. Do I actually want to trade this market? If it comes out in two years, I don't think I care enough to do it. So the sweet spot is when we know token is confirmed, it's going to be on this date. This is the supply everyone's doing the math on. Like, everyone's playing the speculating game on where it's going to trade.
00:31:40.918 - 00:31:57.186, Speaker B: I think that's a much more interesting market to trade than something which may never launch. Really? Yeah. So we have just found, like, the sweet spot is between one week to a month, or, you know, when I get announced this, they're going to do a token, we'll be ready to make a market for it.
00:31:57.288 - 00:32:07.314, Speaker C: So, Julian, you build a perp exchange, decentralized exchange, and options, decentralized exchange. But you are a trader yourself as.
00:32:07.352 - 00:32:14.006, Speaker B: Well, which, to be honest, not every dex scientist is right, but you are.
00:32:14.028 - 00:32:18.178, Speaker C: A user of your own product or at least of the ecosystem. So what do you trade?
00:32:18.274 - 00:32:19.090, Speaker B: What do you trade?
00:32:19.170 - 00:32:22.486, Speaker C: Do you trade or meme coins or the majors?
00:32:22.598 - 00:33:03.494, Speaker B: And what's your strategy? I don't have a strategy. I think generally I do own a bunch of stuff which are, like, more of my long term holds, but I think I do very active in the daily, weekly narrative rotation game. I think it's fun, obviously. I think I'm decently good at it. And also what I tell myself is it keeps me sharp on what the market is thinking and talking about. So, yeah, I think a lot of people have actually praised this or spoken about Avo being actually really in tune with what the market wants to trade. And that's really just like me knowing what the narrative is right now.
00:33:03.494 - 00:33:09.558, Speaker B: I want to trade this coin. I'm just going to list it as well. Yeah, I think. And actually, that's, like, a big part of what we do.
00:33:09.644 - 00:33:13.034, Speaker A: Are you just trading perps or meme coins also?
00:33:13.152 - 00:33:16.710, Speaker B: Whatever is hot. I think I've been in all the Solana meme coins.
00:33:16.870 - 00:33:18.870, Speaker A: Did you catch GameStop this past weekend?
00:33:18.950 - 00:33:45.122, Speaker B: I didn't get into the stock coins, unfortunately. I was, like, bag holding Anita Maxwin. Yeah, that one's a zero. And also, like, the mock jube. Yeah, mock jube stuff is very interesting. I mean, I think just seeing the founder in the discord like, shit, posting with everyone else and just, like, telling everyone this coin is going to zero and people just keep buying it. It's very fun and interesting.
00:33:45.122 - 00:33:47.670, Speaker B: So I was participating in that as well.
00:33:47.820 - 00:33:50.934, Speaker C: What's the rotation of the next two weeks?
00:33:51.052 - 00:34:16.710, Speaker B: Next two weeks? I don't know, man. I think it's been very choppy since the ETF. I actually had a plan to sell on the ETF day, but I got caught up in the hype as well. Like, just seeing the influence. I thought it was, like, too big to. Yeah, basically I was bull pill, so I didn't buy a bunch of calls and stuff, unfortunately, but, yeah, I mean, in the last sort of.
00:34:16.800 - 00:34:17.914, Speaker C: You bought calls on Avo?
00:34:17.962 - 00:34:35.090, Speaker B: Yeah, I only trade on Avo for options these days, but, yeah, I think obviously that was wrong. So I got wrecked there. But in the last sort of two weeks, just been trading a bunch of Seoul. I'm in a bunch of Seoul eco coins now as well. Seoul's great.
00:34:35.160 - 00:34:39.734, Speaker A: I mean, Seoul's doing great. Wiff is doing holding pretty steady as well.
00:34:39.852 - 00:34:42.950, Speaker C: What are your long term bags, Tao?
00:34:43.850 - 00:34:44.822, Speaker B: Oh, my God.
00:34:44.956 - 00:34:46.546, Speaker A: We're just talking about it, Chow.
00:34:46.578 - 00:35:07.182, Speaker B: And I don't think I'm qualified to explain why it's good. I just like the coins upon it. It's been just going up. Ethereum, Sol. I think those are my three big ones on the gaming side, I like Ronan a lot. Been buying and staking since last year. We're going to have Alexander on our.
00:35:07.236 - 00:35:10.298, Speaker C: Pretty soon to talk about Ronan. What is your thesis on Ronan?
00:35:10.394 - 00:35:41.234, Speaker B: I mean, I've just looked at the numbers of the users and the players, and it's just been growing like crazy. So I don't have a clear tech thesis on why this chain is better than another chain. I don't think it really matters. I think, yeah, like, pixels was one of the big games that launched on Ronan, and that's been really popping off. It feels like the XE 2.0, basically. Same crowd, like, run it back, same type of user, which is like indonesian filipino airdrop farmers.
00:35:41.234 - 00:35:49.386, Speaker B: And there are so many of them across YouTube, TikTok, every normie platform. So that was sort of my thesis when I bought Ronin last year.
00:35:49.488 - 00:35:53.914, Speaker C: Ronin has more than one game now because it used to be just axie.
00:35:53.962 - 00:35:54.222, Speaker B: Right.
00:35:54.276 - 00:35:57.738, Speaker C: And now you're saying there's an ecosystem of games.
00:35:57.834 - 00:36:14.542, Speaker B: Yeah. Pixels is the big one in the last few months. What kind of game is it? It's kind of like MMORpG, but it looks a bit, like, pixelated, I guess. I don't know too much about the game, unfortunately. That's why I didn't buy the token of the game. I just bought the infrastructure.
00:36:14.686 - 00:36:18.150, Speaker C: Yeah, infrastructure token still outperforms the app tokens.
00:36:18.650 - 00:36:22.022, Speaker B: Yeah, usually. And Saul. Right.
00:36:22.076 - 00:36:27.314, Speaker C: You have Saul in your long term. I feel like. Like so many people are bullish.
00:36:27.362 - 00:36:27.714, Speaker B: Tao.
00:36:27.762 - 00:36:29.794, Speaker C: No one is able to explain the thesis.
00:36:29.922 - 00:36:33.194, Speaker A: There's no articles that really explains it deeply enough either.
00:36:33.232 - 00:36:33.434, Speaker B: Right.
00:36:33.472 - 00:36:37.226, Speaker C: I read, like, articles this morning. There's no good explainer of how it works.
00:36:37.328 - 00:36:39.450, Speaker A: All I know is that AI and crypto.
00:36:41.230 - 00:37:05.570, Speaker B: Yes. The original thesis was, like, it's AI and crypto. It has, like, a cult following. It's really difficult to buy. So had to make, like, a maxi account, bought like, tao, got the wallet, withdrew the thing into this random wallet I've never used before. But, I mean, we were also, like, the first Dex to list, like, a tao perp. So that got a bunch of attention when Tao had its first run.
00:37:05.570 - 00:37:11.830, Speaker B: But, yeah, I mean, Bybit just launched it, like, today. So now there are multiple venues to trade tao purps. Awesome.
00:37:11.980 - 00:37:36.142, Speaker A: So going back to your journey as a founder, you started with ribbon, and then you made this fundamental shift to avo and that was because of the last bear bull market cycle. And founders are always thinking about pivots, right? I wouldn't consider this a major pivot. I think you just added more product lines, but to a certain degree it's a pivot. How did you think about this pivot? Why did you decide that this was the right move? Or how did you know that this was the right move?
00:37:36.276 - 00:38:03.638, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think maybe for some context we were working on the ribbon product, which was mostly like this whale centric defi yield product for the first year and a half, almost two years. And I think we already saw the writing on the wall. When the bear market started coming, especially like the week of the lunar collapse, we just saw like 30% of our tvl disappear in one day.
00:38:03.724 - 00:38:07.686, Speaker C: Why would a bear market hurt a structured product? Yield product.
00:38:07.788 - 00:38:42.558, Speaker B: So our yield product was sort of denominated in coins, etH, BTC primarily. We had a different product which was selling puts, which basically got wrecked on that one week when everything went down. So, yeah, I think that one week our vaults had a bunch of losses. The vaults that didn't have losses basically were denominated in coins. So those went down a lot as well. And I think immediately there was like a vibe shift of people just want to pull out money from the riskiest yield stuff in DeFi and either move them to the safest stuff in DeFi or just exit to fiat.
00:38:42.574 - 00:38:46.226, Speaker A: I think DeFi was exiting, period. Everyone was just scared. I remember at that point.
00:38:46.248 - 00:39:14.630, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. So, yeah, I think that one week we just saw a massive drop in TVL. We already knew. I think we already felt it coming, but that was like confirmation that this was not going to come back anytime soon. We were already brainstorming new ideas at that point. We've been brainstorming new ideas since the first year. I think we always had this feeling that the product that we built, even though TVL was massive, like half a b, we are printing out quite good cash flows.
00:39:14.630 - 00:39:47.174, Speaker B: We had a strong brand. I think we knew fundamentally we didn't have a strong moat for a lot of these sort of structured products. It's mostly like a sales and distribution game. A lot of banks basically have salespeople to sell it to their networks, and there's no liquidity mode or any reason why any of these things get consolidated into a single winner long term. I think we knew that and we knew we needed to sort of escape from this product to something else. Hopefully it could be adjacent. Hopefully it could be some synergistic thing.
00:39:47.174 - 00:40:06.926, Speaker B: So yeah, I think we were already brainstorming a bunch of stuff and I think when the lunar collapse happened, we already had been building a few things and I think we just went all in on building an exchange. We just felt like we don't want to build this seasonal yield product where people come when markets are risk on and people disappear when they're risk off.
00:40:07.028 - 00:40:09.966, Speaker A: What was the competitive landscape look like on chain then?
00:40:10.068 - 00:40:52.834, Speaker B: Yeah, so we initially started out by building like an options exchange. I think we just felt like at that point in time, realistically, even today, we feel like every options protocol sucks. I wouldn't want to trade on any of them. I think all of them at that point in time were these amm centric products where if you are doing size, it was just impossible to trade on any of them because the curve would just give you an extremely bad price. So, yeah, I think no serious trader could actually do size on any of these AMM protocols. And we thought the only way to do size was to trade against one of these ten big institutional market makers. And they were not touching amms.
00:40:52.834 - 00:41:29.526, Speaker B: They price options however they want. They're not going to stick their money into this passive lp product. So, yeah, we sort of worked backwards from there and thought like, okay, can we actually build a product where we can get all these institutional market makers on board? At that point in time, we knew everyone on the options side as well. So we had very good relationships with basically all the big options market makers, or the big options market these days. I would say like Galaxy, QCP, Genesis was pretty big. There's some smaller ones as well. There's some who are sort of more specialized on the order book side of things.
00:41:29.526 - 00:41:57.618, Speaker B: Some are more specialized on client services and OTC. So it's kind of like segregated into those two categories. But yeah, we knew all of them and we spoke to them and we thought the hardest part with building a new exchange is bootstrapping liquidity and bootstrapping users. And if there are no users, market makers are not going to care. So there's not going to be any liquidity. If there's no liquidity, users are not going to show up. So that was like the hard cold start problem.
00:41:57.618 - 00:42:15.270, Speaker B: And we felt like we had this pretty big vault product, which was basically like a very big whale just selling a bunch of options every single week. And we thought, yeah, can we use this product that we have to bootstrap this new exchange? Because we know we have at least one very big user, which is ourselves.
00:42:16.730 - 00:42:19.142, Speaker A: I didn't know that you're dogboating your own product.
00:42:19.276 - 00:42:44.330, Speaker B: Yeah. Our ribbon vaults is basically going to be like the whale of Avo, basically. Got it. Okay. We can funnel all this flow onto our exchange and incentivize the market makers to start showing prices because they know there's going to be this big dumb seller every week who's just going to sell options. So, yeah, I think that was the core idea. And, yeah, so I just felt like options landscape in defi back then was terrible.
00:42:44.330 - 00:42:48.882, Speaker B: Plus, we thought we had an edge in building a new exchange, so that's why we did it.
00:42:48.936 - 00:43:11.670, Speaker A: If you look at the market today, there's maybe two other competitors. Dydx, obviously, is one that's been around for a while, and they've kind of gone the same route as you have. Right. Which is building out their own Cosmo zone app chain, et cetera. And they were previously on Starknet. And you will have, which I'm just starting to hear a lot about, is hyperliquid. I think they came out of nowhere.
00:43:12.570 - 00:44:07.706, Speaker B: They are great. Maybe I could talk a bit about our transition from options to perps and the landscape there. So we launched this options exchange in April of last year, and I think pretty quickly we became the leader in the DFI space because the DFI space is just so small. I think in Q three and Q four, we were between 50% to 70% of defi market share at that point in time for the option side. So I think we felt like, do we want to just keep pushing the options thing even though we have kind of tapped out the market already, or should we build an adjacent product? And, yeah, I think we just felt like the option thing sort of required some timing. There may be a big market shift from perps to options, but it's not happening right now. But we know for sure we have the tech to build perps adjacent to options as well.
00:44:07.706 - 00:44:45.526, Speaker B: There were some natural use cases between options and perps. So we just started building, like a perps product as well. And, yeah, just in Q four, we started growing it a lot, and that has become basically the majority of our volume now is on the perps side. So it used to be like 20% of our volume was perps, but now it's like 95%. So I think clearly the current market cares more about perps. For now, if there's a shift to options, we're going to be there to capitalize. But for now, people want to trade non BTC and ETH options.
00:44:45.526 - 00:45:18.530, Speaker B: They want to trade Solana, they want to trade Avax, say injective, all this stuff. So yeah, I think we had to build what the market really cared about right now, which is these thematic coins. They want to play the rotation game as well. So yeah, I think we started working on the perps and it's been pretty successful on the perps side. We are still like a pretty small player on the perp side. But yeah, I think hyperliquid, which was another exchange that launched maybe six months before us, they've been growing like crazy. It's a great product.
00:45:18.530 - 00:45:37.218, Speaker B: I actually do think they're actually one of the best or maybe even the best on the perp site. So yeah, I always scold my team if hyperlickid is doing something better than just like, why can't we be as good as them? So definitely use them as the gold standard in terms of just like product and liquid lease.
00:45:37.314 - 00:45:41.500, Speaker C: Julian, why do you think people prefer to trade perks than options?
00:45:42.030 - 00:46:27.778, Speaker B: Yeah, I think honestly the primary reason in the last six months at least, I think there actually was a lot of options interest around the ETF stuff. So the BTC options actually grew a lot, especially on the CME side in the last quarter. Everyone's sort of speculating on the BTC ETF and people actually trade options quite a bit. But I think for the average trader like you and me, I don't think we care about getting, I don't know, 30% return on a call spread or something on BTC. I think what was just much more exciting, especially in Q four, was just like catching the three x's on sale or injective. And there's no market to trade these options. If there are, they're going to be super wide.
00:46:27.778 - 00:46:47.358, Speaker B: There's probably like one or two market makers in the world who want to make a market for these altcoins. And if the market's so wide, might as well just trade the perk. So I think that's been where the market is right now. It may change in the future, but we're kind of stuck in this place where no one wants to make the all coin markets yet. Maybe a change in the future.
00:46:47.524 - 00:46:53.482, Speaker C: Hyperliquid, you really like their product, but I can't find any information about their team. Are they amon?
00:46:53.546 - 00:47:20.762, Speaker B: They're not. I think the founder is like an ex prop trader. Yeah. So from what I've heard, their team used to do just prop trading and they made a bunch of money trading last cycle, I guess so the current products just like self funded. They didn't do any vc thing. So I think, yeah, I mean, they've been really successful in how far they've gotten without any external funding. Yeah, I think they actually have gotten a lot of mind share and interest from crypto tutor as well.
00:47:20.816 - 00:47:22.170, Speaker A: And they're on Cosmos, right?
00:47:22.240 - 00:47:38.698, Speaker B: Yeah. So it's technically not cosmos. Yeah, they're like using the tenement code base or something. It's not open source, so we don't actually know what the code base looks like, but, yeah, some flavor of tenement cosmos.
00:47:38.794 - 00:47:42.410, Speaker A: Chad, do you have anything else you want to add to that? Before I move to a different topic.
00:47:42.490 - 00:47:59.686, Speaker C: I'm just looking at the ranking of top derivative projects. There's so many names that I either don't recognize or they just launched recently, like maybe in less than a year ago. It's wild how many perps projects there are.
00:47:59.788 - 00:48:43.950, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's like one. I mean, like, the perp market is probably one of the most competitive markets in DeFi right now. And I actually do think it's like competing over a fairly small pie right now. The set of users who trade on Dexes perps is still pretty limited to basically the same guys who are participating in DeFi last cycle, maybe a few new users, but it's like, nowhere reached a mainstream, stealing market share from centralized exchanges. So I definitely do think it's, like, an extremely competitive market for where the market is. That's sort of why we've been also just looking at other things adjacent to Pervdex's. I don't think unless you are sort of the best, I think you would sort of be nowhere.
00:48:43.950 - 00:48:51.490, Speaker B: So, yeah, I think a lot of people are trying to gun for the top one or two spots, but I think everything in the middle is sort of just going to die.
00:48:51.570 - 00:48:54.354, Speaker C: What other products are you looking at adjacent to perps?
00:48:54.482 - 00:49:33.362, Speaker B: Yeah, so I'm actually going to announce this next week or in a few days, but I think one of the advantages that we have, especially over some of the other app chains, like DyDX, hyperliquid, those guys have built chains which only sort of facilitate trading. It's sort of by nature an app chain. You can't do anything else on the chain, like, by nature except trade. Those are the only type of transactions that the trade actually facilitates. But since we sort of forked, like the op stack, we actually can deploy a bunch of other stuff next to our exchange with pretty much no effort. What do you mean by that?
00:49:33.416 - 00:49:34.830, Speaker A: Are you talking like osmosis?
00:49:34.910 - 00:50:16.206, Speaker B: It could look somewhat like osmosis, I think. Yeah, basically, we have just seen some of these L2s get pretty big, like Manta and Blast got a lot of attention, we think, attracting a lot of capital. Everyone's trying to build an ecosystem. So, yeah, I think we are going along that route, and that's going to be our major focus this year, we think some interesting things that no one has ever done before. Two things, actually. So first one, I think it's really interesting that all L2 projects don't actually own anything at the app layer. Maybe it's sort of for decentralization sake, but optimism doesn't actually own any apps on optimism chain arbitram doesn't own any apps on arbitrum chain.
00:50:16.206 - 00:50:54.190, Speaker B: But we have this exchange, like a big app. And what if instead of having to monetize at the chain level, we just monetize at the app level, but we can sort of give back all sort of chain level surplus to users, so no sequence of fee, or we just use our app to subsidize the whole chain because our app actually makes money. These are some interesting ideas that we are thinking about. The second sort of interesting data point that we have is, like, the most difficult things for a L2 to be successful is users don't want to bridge. Like, the friction of bridging is just extremely.
00:50:57.410 - 00:51:00.670, Speaker A: I'm not chasing any meme coins anymore on ethereum.
00:51:02.370 - 00:51:42.566, Speaker B: Yeah. So, I mean, if someone tells you you need a bridge into this L2, you're just not going to do it, it's over. But we have sort of made the UX of depositing into Avo so seamless that these users don't even know that they're bridging onto our chain. So when manta network launched on finance or whatever, they had 100,000 users who have bridged into their chain. I think blast is also in the range of 100 to 200. But, yeah, just like an interesting stat, like, 80,000 users have deposited into AvO already, which is pretty close to where blast is, actually. And these 80,000 wallets who have basically deposited into Avo haven't thought about it as bridging into a chain.
00:51:42.566 - 00:52:23.114, Speaker B: That has nothing to do. They sort of thought about it as, oh, we're going to come here to use able to exchange. Yeah, I think we have gotten quite a big user base just from that. And our idea now is like, can we actually take these users and send them to other apps on the chain as well? Does that make sense? I think that dramatically lowers the friction of getting users in if they're already here, they're already using one of the biggest apps on the chain itself. They already have something to do. If you give them sort of adjacent stuff to farm or to do other things on chain, I think they will do it. So, yeah, these are some of our ideas of how we can bootstrap an ecosystem beyond just like a single app.
00:52:23.114 - 00:52:30.506, Speaker B: And I think those are some of the advantages that we have over UIDX, for example. So that's something we are thinking about a lot.
00:52:30.528 - 00:52:55.860, Speaker C: Now, that's a really interesting point, because if you think about it, centralized exchanges are essentially L2s. They're centralized, and when you deposit money into a centralized exchange, you don't think about bridging. In your head, the verb is deposit, not bridging. Moment you see the word bridge on the front end, it just raises. It's really stressful. So just changing that word.
00:52:57.270 - 00:52:58.222, Speaker A: Security assumptions.
00:52:58.286 - 00:52:58.658, Speaker B: Right.
00:52:58.744 - 00:53:00.942, Speaker A: Also, like, you think about the security assumptions.
00:53:01.086 - 00:53:56.230, Speaker B: Yeah, I know you guys are bullish on base, but Coinbase does a very similar strategy. When you withdraw eth on Coinbase, you can withdraw it to a bunch of networks and they will tell you like, oh, if you withdraw the base, it's the cheapest route. And the reason for that is they subsidize that from all the revenues on their main product. So, yeah, I think we have some ideas of like, can we just take all the revenues we make on this one exchange? Can we actually use that to basically give back to the users to try everything else around the exchange? That actually is much more compelling for a user to use the ecosystem compared to bridging into this ghost chain that has nothing on it. So, yeah, I think those are some of the interesting ideas that we have. And, yeah, I find it interesting that no other L2 project also owns the apps on it. Maybe Kanto was actually an interesting example.
00:53:56.230 - 00:54:05.514, Speaker B: So Kanto had the lending protocol baked into the protocol level, no token. Yep. So I think it might look something.
00:54:05.552 - 00:54:09.482, Speaker A: Like that because layer one also has incentives for apps that are being built on them, right?
00:54:09.536 - 00:54:10.090, Speaker B: Yes.
00:54:10.240 - 00:54:21.002, Speaker A: And so by enshrining lending, then they're capturing some of the volume and the users, and then they can use that as a way to bootstrap new apps that are coming onto the Kanto ecosystem.
00:54:21.146 - 00:54:52.198, Speaker B: Yep. So that was a very interesting idea. And optimism and arbitram are never going to do that. So I think that's like a place that we are interested in playing. I think one angle that we find very interesting as well is we don't want to be this chain where you deploy nfts, you deploy all sorts of random stuff, social stuff. I think we have built our whole product around speculation. People come to able to trade perps options or speculate on these pre market launches.
00:54:52.198 - 00:55:24.130, Speaker B: Can we just double down on that and build other stuff which are in the same vein? So stuff like prediction market, sports betting. I think the type of user who comes and trades a Jupiter pre launch is also interested in doing a prediction market. I think we need to build something where the core culture of the chain is sort of very focused around one thing. And in our case it's just like speculation. Like people actually bridge into Avo to use the Jupyter market. So I do think we want to build stuff in a similar vein as well.
00:55:24.200 - 00:55:42.566, Speaker C: I feel like out of all the L2s, arbitram is the only one that has an identity. Arbitrum is speculative chain and the other ones like op and bayes, and they all have a variety of different things, arbitram like. So basically you want to have this very strong identity about your chain.
00:55:42.678 - 00:56:12.946, Speaker B: Yeah, I think you just got to double down on it. It even makes marketing easier. I think you just lose your user interest when you do everything and you do everything not very well. I think if you do a few things extremely well, people would know you for that and actually want to use it. We think it's just a stupid strategy to build like a general purpose chain where everyone's welcome and you just have hackathons with all these different categories. I think that's like a dumb growth plan. But if we have some very specific ideas for stuff we can do, I think that makes a lot more sense.
00:56:12.946 - 00:56:15.682, Speaker B: So that's sort of my focus this year.
00:56:15.816 - 00:56:21.074, Speaker A: So what you mentioned earlier is, well, I'm curious, does optimism then have a moat?
00:56:21.122 - 00:56:21.430, Speaker B: Right.
00:56:21.500 - 00:56:42.210, Speaker A: What you're saying is apps that are building on your roll up, as an example, they're building on it specifically to capture the users that are on that platform, that liquidity and et cetera. And if that's the case, then I guess what I'm trying to get at is what is the moat that optimism has versus you building your own identity and your own users? You're going the inverse.
00:56:42.230 - 00:56:42.462, Speaker B: Right?
00:56:42.516 - 00:56:45.534, Speaker A: Like optimism. Like everyone just build on us.
00:56:45.652 - 00:56:46.030, Speaker B: Right?
00:56:46.100 - 00:56:50.026, Speaker A: What you're saying is build on us because we have users and liquidity.
00:56:50.138 - 00:57:25.642, Speaker B: Yes, exactly. And we know the type of users who came here are basically pseudo gamblers. And if you're building some sort of gambling related app, this is sort of the type of user you want. So, yeah, I think we are super focused right now just on user acquisition and actually getting a lot of people using the product. And we think once you have that, you can build stuff around it. If you start out as this general purpose chain, I don't think it works. I mean, we have just seen that happen again and again for some of these up and coming new chains like scroll and linear and stuff like that.
00:57:25.642 - 00:57:52.706, Speaker B: Not to call them out specifically, but I think, yeah, it's just difficult to reason about why people would want to build there, even though they have some different tech. Ultimately, the user is sort of like, there are still no users there. So I think getting the people using it is still, like, the hard part of the equation. Yeah. So I think Solana has actually done fairly well on both the builder side and the user side, which is, like, rare, I think.
00:57:52.808 - 00:58:18.262, Speaker C: I really like her strategy. It's so different from everyone else's. Everyone else is pursuing the same strategy. It's actually getting tiresome now. You have, like, 50 different roll ups and ten different layer ones, all trying to airdrop some tokens to users to boost the TBL up on a ghost chain, and then at the same time, trying to reel in some third party developers, build some apps.
00:58:18.326 - 00:58:21.702, Speaker A: Charles, are you having points fatigue? Because I'm kind of having points fatigue.
00:58:21.766 - 00:58:23.018, Speaker C: I'm okay with points.
00:58:23.184 - 00:58:44.414, Speaker A: Okay, you're in a shopping mall, right, and everyone's trying to give you free shit. How do you, as a user, figure out where you want to dedicate your time to shop? Do you know what I mean? There is a problem, a fundamental problem, which is, like, everyone is offering points, and now users are inundated with all of these options. So is it just whatever attracts the users?
00:58:44.462 - 00:58:55.858, Speaker C: There's actually a really beautiful thing about points, I think, which is that you know what you will get. And crypto djs love that. They love the lottery aspect of it. That actually is strictly better than getting tokens.
00:58:55.954 - 00:58:57.590, Speaker A: Well, I mean, it is tokens.
00:58:58.330 - 00:59:40.726, Speaker B: I do think the pendulum is swinging the other way now against points. I think teams know that they can give you something at their own arbitrary decision, and they can delay this decision for months. Right. So the team ultimately has the ability to tell you what you get, and I think a lot of teams are deciding to give you as little as possible. So you are getting farmed by the team instead of you farming the project. So, yeah, I do think the more projects that basically take all this interest through points and basically give back the users, like, nothing or close to nothing that is happening now. And I think that's what's going to make people hate points.
00:59:40.726 - 01:00:03.820, Speaker B: I think it's just like if the culture has just sort of swung in the other direction and you are getting what is supposed to be like, this interesting meta game that people want to play and speculate on is becoming just like a very bad game to play when the team decides to just give you nothing. So I kind of feel that vibe shift in the last few weeks. So I don't think we're going to do a point system.
01:00:05.070 - 01:00:33.378, Speaker C: But, julian, speaking of, like, if you look at Menta and blast, both of them have over a billion dollars in TVL without any real apps, and people just go there for the potential airdrops and the yield, by the way, airdrops is a form of randomized yield, of course, and the strategy works. But how do you think about that? Are you thinking of doing another token to incentivize this behavior?
01:00:33.554 - 01:01:07.154, Speaker B: I don't think it's a repeatable strategy. I think the early movers who create the meta would basically get the most out of it. But the 10th project, who's going to launch, like, the 10th L2, which has points, no one's going to care. So I do think someone needs to change the meta first and create something interesting, and that's going to get all the traction. So maybe in this case, blast invented the meta, Manta copied it once. Maybe the third one is not going to work so well. I don't know how either we have to reinvent a new type of user acquisition game or find something else.
01:01:07.154 - 01:01:19.030, Speaker B: Actually, one kind of interesting alpha that we've been looking at is we've been doing a lot of marketing and we've been doing a lot of Normie marketing. It's been working shockingly well.
01:01:19.100 - 01:01:22.242, Speaker A: What's Normie marketing? Like YouTube or TikToks?
01:01:22.306 - 01:01:43.242, Speaker B: Yeah, a very recent one, just like two or three days ago, is we worked with this influencer to make like a TikTok about Avo, and it got like 100k views. So it's like extremely impressive ROI. And all those are really different set of users from the crypto Twitter world. It's just like a TikTok crypto influencer.
01:01:43.306 - 01:01:44.814, Speaker A: I'm looking it up now.
01:01:45.012 - 01:02:07.846, Speaker B: It's surprisingly not easy to find, but, yeah, I think it's really overlooked by a lot of teams. I think crypto Twitter is extremely competitive in terms of attention, but it's easier to play the attention game outside of crypto Twitter. So we've been just trying to double down on that. A lot of non english content has worked actually pretty well.
01:02:07.948 - 01:02:11.186, Speaker C: Russians, Russians and Chinese. A lot of Russian.
01:02:11.218 - 01:02:53.806, Speaker B: Chinese. Exactly. So, yeah, I think, interestingly, if you look at Avo, the only two languages that are supported which are not English is Russian and Chinese. So we just looked at the demographics. It naturally skewed to those Ukraine slash like russian speaking zones and Chinese, so we just doubled down on that. We're doing a lot more chinese content, working with a lot of russian speaking folks as well, like Kol networks. So I think it's like a very interesting place to play instead of just paying the same Twitter influencers to tweet some thread about Avo on English CT.
01:02:53.806 - 01:03:07.882, Speaker B: That's something we've been actually trying to focus on. And I think that's like a way more robust audience and user set than the people who are just jumping from points to points. So, yeah, we've just been really focused on that now.
01:03:07.936 - 01:03:24.646, Speaker C: YouTube is also really interesting. I feel like there's a very distinct culture on YouTube versus CT. Like, for example, CT really despises Cardano and XRP, but if you go on YouTube, there's so many people shilling Cardano and XRP.
01:03:24.838 - 01:04:12.186, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I've been super deep in the crypto YouTube rabbit holes. We actually got like an intern in our team who basically his job is to watch all these YouTube channels. Just get a transcript of every video, put it into AI, just summarize all the videos, get all the ticker symbols and put it in like a spreadsheet so we can literally have a view of across all these different channels. What are people talking about right now? Everyone's talking about ETF and then everyone's talking about X. I don't think it's actually something you can use to trade because it's usually like a delayed indicator. It's like a lagging thing, not a leading indicator. But it's extremely interesting just to see the sentiment and the picks that people are talking about.
01:04:12.186 - 01:04:31.582, Speaker B: But, yeah, I mean, I think someone should build an automated AI to sort of get all this information instead of just getting some intern to just click and transcribe everything. I find that very interesting. And maybe it's an area that most people are just not looking in right now, especially our competitors.
01:04:31.646 - 01:04:34.770, Speaker A: I think the YouTube thumbnails are so cringe.
01:04:35.430 - 01:04:36.754, Speaker B: They work really well.
01:04:36.872 - 01:04:41.670, Speaker A: But they work really well. I mean, we tried it within. Good game for a bit.
01:04:41.740 - 01:05:01.606, Speaker B: One of the keywords that you guys needed to use is like, you know how you guys call things coins or tokens? All of them call it cryptos. Top ten cryptos to watch for the new bull run. That's sort of like the keyword when I know it's like a normally targeted audience. Good to know. They don't say tokens at all, they just call it cryptos.
01:05:01.718 - 01:05:09.450, Speaker A: Interesting. One more point I want to ask you before we go to founder lessons. There's this market called Wales OTC.
01:05:09.610 - 01:05:09.994, Speaker B: Yep.
01:05:10.042 - 01:05:42.506, Speaker A: And you could think of this as a kind of a pre market trading as well. And what people do is they deposit some collateral for the points that they have and people are able to buy and sell points. So recently, and I've been following Wales OTC for some time, I think they have like $18 million in volume done now, which is pretty impressive. People are buying juke points and I've seen friend Tech token points also trade and I'm seeing many, many popular points systems trade. So I guess how do you see this market? And is this kind of competitive to your pre, I mean, perps product as well?
01:05:42.608 - 01:06:15.826, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's definitely a clear extension of the prelaunch markets. Like prelaunch markets are already taking the idea of building something that people want to speculate on to the next level. You're not just trading the token, you're trading the token before the token launches and you're playing this game of what the price is going to be and points are sort of like the next level. It's like we don't even know if these things are going to translate to tokens, but we're going to make a market for it. So it's great. It's very interesting. I wish we did it first.
01:06:15.826 - 01:06:33.946, Speaker B: I think, yeah, they're doing really well and right now there is a lot of interest in just trading these things. I think one of the issues for us, or what we have seen is our pre launch stuff drives a lot of attention in users, but in terms of actual revenue, it's extremely small part of the whole business.
01:06:34.048 - 01:06:35.334, Speaker A: It's a go to market strategy.
01:06:35.382 - 01:07:14.118, Speaker B: Right, exactly. So it is like user acquisition, but the volume numbers are just not big enough to justify a big business. So I haven't done the math, but if I were to guess, I think our prelaunch revenues are less than 2% of the total exchange revenues. Most of the revenue still comes from people trading majors and sort of the coin of the month. So yeah, I'm not sure. I think it's a great idea, but I'm just not sure if it can be a big standalone project. So I'm happy that we worked on the prelaunch stuff as the user acquisition, I just don't know if it's big enough to be a standalone company.
01:07:14.118 - 01:07:15.094, Speaker B: Got it.
01:07:15.212 - 01:07:40.254, Speaker A: Now, Julian, you know, a part of our user base is primarily founders that are building in the space. I know you spoke to our cohorts in the past many times to kind of give them feedback on your journey as a founder. If you had to distill some of the lessons that you've learned, what are some key lessons that you've learned as a founder in crypto? Building crypto? I mean, there's many, but, yeah, just high level, and then we'll kind of go deeper, I think.
01:07:40.292 - 01:08:24.814, Speaker B: Yeah, one of the obvious ones is just like, obviously you just got to persevere through the market cycles. So, yeah, one interesting thing is, I think in Q three or Q four of last year, there was one week where our metrics just started doubling and it didn't stop. It was kind of flat for two quarters, and then it started doubling and tripling. So if you gave up one month before that or one week before that, you would have missed the sudden change in market environment. I think you sort of just got to stick it out for. I think if you are like a long term believer in the space, if you actually believe in crypto, long term things will probably come back. So, yeah, just being able to stick it out till then is super important.
01:08:24.814 - 01:08:45.940, Speaker B: I couldn't tell you when the market would have come back, but it just did randomly, and everything just started looking better. So it's hard. There's so many NFT exchanges that gave up in the first cycle. Right. Like the 2017 cycle. Like openc sort of just stuck it out and one day they became like a $10 billion company.
01:08:47.670 - 01:08:54.930, Speaker A: It's more about being resilient to the market conditions, your emotions and the environment around you, and focusing on the long term goal.
01:08:55.010 - 01:09:43.480, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think that's right. The hard part about that is I don't think you can just sit around and wait for the market to come back. You still need to still try and find something interesting. So even when the markets were super quiet, we were still just trying to figure out what is the meta now, even if we don't have 100,000 users, can we find 100 people, build something interesting for them? I do think you got to constantly be chasing market feedback instead of just praying that this vision is going to become something one day. So I think if your vision is correct, there'll be a small set of users who actually believe in it already. So you just got to find all of them I'm sure you guys know this from the Tensor days, right? Solana NFTs were in sort of max depression zone. Oh, my.
01:09:43.480 - 01:09:59.542, Speaker B: Few people still interested in it, and just building something for them is really important instead of just chilling and waiting for the NFTs to come back if they were ever going to. So, yeah, I think those are like two things you got to balance, and they are somewhat contradictory.
01:09:59.686 - 01:10:21.858, Speaker C: You know what I found by talking to even some of the best founders in the space? I think at some point they almost all thought of pivoting away from crypto, but they still ended up staying crypto because there's no other industry in which they have an unfair advantage, so they just stuck with crypto. And two, they just took a leap of faith. Has this thought ever crossed your mind?
01:10:21.944 - 01:10:55.562, Speaker B: It hasn't really crossed our mind. I think there's never been a point where I thought that the crypto is going to disappear as an industry. The pivot that we made kind of was like one section to a bigger market or like a more interesting market. So for sure we can make those pivots. But I was pretty convicted. I don't think I ever thought it was going to disappear. Yeah, maybe an interesting sort of side quest that I did was I took a week off to learn AI stuff, like, two years ago, and coincidentally, that was the week that FTX collapsed.
01:10:55.562 - 01:11:19.622, Speaker B: So my week of rest and self learning was completely disrupted by the whole FDX situation. I was interested in some other stuff and just learn about it on the side. But I don't think we ever thought about pivoting completely. I just have such a strong aversion to. I don't want to be the type of person who pivots to AI at the crypto bottom. And there's so many of those. So many, so many.
01:11:19.756 - 01:11:20.950, Speaker A: Rest in peace.
01:11:21.610 - 01:11:29.290, Speaker B: I'm very aware that that's, like, a common phenomenon. So I've been in crypto for, what, almost eight years or something?
01:11:29.360 - 01:11:30.474, Speaker A: Long time now.
01:11:30.672 - 01:11:49.774, Speaker B: I met, like, Charles so many years ago when I was still in university. So I think I do obviously care about the core beliefs of the space. I love BTC as an idea. So, yeah, I think some of those core principles keeps me in the space instead of just, like, pivoting to the next hot thing.
01:11:49.892 - 01:11:54.660, Speaker A: All the ogs that I know always pay respect to bitcoin, of course.
01:11:55.990 - 01:11:56.642, Speaker B: Cool.
01:11:56.776 - 01:11:59.522, Speaker A: Well, chow, any final thoughts, notes, questions?
01:11:59.656 - 01:12:17.734, Speaker B: No, I'm good. Julian. No, I mean, thank you for having me on. I think I've been doing a lot of like, I am on a little media tour now, so appreciate the platform and, yeah, I mean, hopefully your audience isn't bored by my trading stories. We love the trading part.
01:12:17.852 - 01:12:43.598, Speaker A: Those are the mean. Obviously, Avo is a great product, but we love to talk about coins. Couple tweets that I just saw. One is standard Chartered bank thinks that ETF is going to get approved in May, and Ethereum just pumped. Ken Griffin from Citadel thinks that we're going to have a soft landing and the fed is going to cut rates. And so markets are looking very green, which is all great for able, is what I'm saying.
01:12:43.684 - 01:12:54.354, Speaker B: Yeah, no, it's great. I managed to get some salana at like $80, so I'm happy about that trade. Like, in the last week or so on leverage or. No, no, I just bought good stuff. Yeah.
01:12:54.472 - 01:13:02.870, Speaker A: All right, well, exciting times. Exciting next six months, a year. Julian, always good seeing you. Thanks for your time, and we'll catch you soon.
01:13:02.940 - 01:13:03.798, Speaker B: Cool. Thanks, guys.
01:13:03.884 - 01:13:14.426, Speaker A: That was a great convo. I've learned a lot specifically around. I mean, I thought it was much more challenging for founders to build on app rollups and da layers and all.
01:13:14.448 - 01:13:16.714, Speaker B: This stuff, but it may not be.
01:13:16.752 - 01:13:18.506, Speaker A: As difficult as I thought it would be.
01:13:18.608 - 01:13:35.602, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, conduit and Caldera have done a pretty good job of making this easy. But you know what really strikes me the most is that by using Celestia as a separate Da layer versus ethereum as the main da, they're able to save nearly 100% of their cost.
01:13:35.736 - 01:13:36.382, Speaker B: It's insane.
01:13:36.446 - 01:13:55.558, Speaker A: $200,000 a month. That's a lot of money saved. In our last pod, I had said that the narrative probably way too further along than where the tech is, and maybe that's just because Celestia hasn't really turned on the monetization engine yet. Right, and maybe it's rightfully where it's at. I'm not sure. I'm not saying they don't need to.
01:13:55.564 - 01:14:02.810, Speaker C: Turn on the monetization. They just need to get a bunch of roll ups to deploy on Celestia, and then the narrative will get going, and then the token will pump.
01:14:04.350 - 01:14:06.940, Speaker A: It already has just how crypto works.
01:14:09.150 - 01:14:22.042, Speaker C: But, yeah, I'm shocked by the savings of using Celestia again, like we said this, but 48, 44, which is going to launch in March or April, will not come anywhere close to using celestia as a DA.
01:14:22.186 - 01:14:32.370, Speaker A: The only reason why someone would use for it for, based on what Julian said, is for security reasons. Right. And maybe it could be a good redundancy right?
01:14:32.520 - 01:14:42.402, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. So that's what he said. So he uses celestia as the primary DA. But then if Celestia goes down, they can switch the da in real time back to ethereum.
01:14:42.546 - 01:14:59.510, Speaker A: Then by all means, protodank sharding is great for people that are very aligned with Ethereum, but I would expect the cost savings. They'll see the cost savings, say, like we're just going to use celestia and then we'll use Ethereum protein sharding as a backup or eigen layer and protang sharding.
01:14:59.590 - 01:15:20.126, Speaker C: Yeah, it's wild how much difference there is. The full dank sharding. So proto dank sharding is this year in a couple of months. But the full dang sharding, it's not in plain sight. The full dang sharding is supposedly another year. I don't know how long it's going to take, but supposedly close to being as good as Celestia.
01:15:20.238 - 01:15:31.350, Speaker A: I'd love to see some competition in his space. I want to see Ethereum compete for stuff that's being abstracted away from Ethereum. We need to see the. Was it the chad Vitalik?
01:15:33.210 - 01:15:34.482, Speaker C: The fit vitalik.
01:15:34.546 - 01:16:08.542, Speaker A: The fit vitalik. Yeah, we need to see him back on. Funny enough, he put a tweet out. Was it today where he said meme coin holders be like meow, meow, meow. And then he bottom ticked, sold a part of his Harry Potter Obama sonic ten in you. I guess someone sent him a bunch and he bottom ticked it to the t like he sold like $40 where he still has a bunch left. And all of the Harry Potter Obama Sonic Inu holders saw that as very bullish.
01:16:08.542 - 01:16:35.914, Speaker A: Similar to how Vitalik tweeted about Salana as salana was hitting $8. And so now Obama, Harry Potter is pumping. Ethereum needs a meme coin. They need something to rally around. And I think this is like it gives people come back, get that speculative power ball of money to come back to Ethereum. So it's good to see that. It's just a side note, the other.
01:16:35.952 - 01:16:41.254, Speaker C: Meme coin that julian talked about is tau for me. It's a meme coin.
01:16:41.302 - 01:16:42.162, Speaker A: What? A meme coin.
01:16:42.246 - 01:16:50.650, Speaker C: It's the best meme. It's Aix crypto, and I've seen so many people bullish on it, but no one is able to explain why they're bullish.
01:16:50.810 - 01:16:53.294, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a cult. It's a cult.
01:16:53.412 - 01:17:12.582, Speaker A: They were early. They made it very hard to use a product, which is what's the alpha, the harder the product to use, the more money you can make. I mean, like when I tried using ordinals, it's such a. My God, it was hard and you have to be so, yeah, maybe we'll see where it goes.
01:17:12.716 - 01:17:18.466, Speaker C: You know what's interesting? Julian is actually very bullish solana, long term bullish solana.
01:17:18.498 - 01:17:20.506, Speaker B: He has a bag of solana and.
01:17:20.528 - 01:17:56.782, Speaker C: Yet he's staying on Ethereum. And he made it very clear, which is that it's much better to be aligned with one tribe than to have no tribe at all. That's the primary reason why he's not migrating to solana, despite himself being bullish solana. And we've seen this multiple times in the past, where a protocol or an app switching the chain from solana to Ethereum or vice versa, end up failing on the new chain seems like a consensus idea now. Like founders are fully aware of this and they want to be aligned with a particular tribe.
01:17:56.846 - 01:18:10.490, Speaker A: It makes sense if you think about it. Oh, there was a funny tweet you shared with us internally. I don't know how I feel about it, but I'll just bring it up anyways. But bitcoin is like Judaism.
01:18:13.390 - 01:18:14.298, Speaker C: Christianity is.
01:18:14.304 - 01:18:39.038, Speaker A: Like Ethereum, and solana is like islam, which I don't know anything about it, I don't agree with it, I'm just bringing it up, which is these communities are, it's very religion based. Right? I mean, you're invested in these communities for the long run. You're a bag holder, you have to protect the bags and you do so by creating this tribalistic community of bag holders that continue to protect the narrative so they become successful.
01:18:39.134 - 01:18:42.098, Speaker C: The top layer ones are all religions, right?
01:18:42.184 - 01:18:43.390, Speaker A: They're all religions.
01:18:43.550 - 01:18:48.210, Speaker C: Imagine 2000 years ago if you could long Christianity.
01:18:48.370 - 01:18:50.022, Speaker B: Yeah. Would you have done it?
01:18:50.076 - 01:19:21.550, Speaker C: Of course you would long a Christianity 2000 years ago if it had a token. And the same idea applies here. I mean, if Christianity had a token, Christianity and Islam both had a token. It would be the top two most valuable tokens in the world by FDB, period. It would be more valuable than gold, by the way, gold is the asset with the highest MCAP market cap. It's the one asset that has the highest market cap. But I think if Christianity and Islam had tokens, they would be number one and two.
01:19:21.620 - 01:20:03.106, Speaker A: I would long which, you know, the founders that are listening, if you're building frontech like products, meme coin like products, hit us up. We're always looking for startups that are doing that. And in fact, actually we're looking for products that are being built around the islamic finance ecosystem too. Yes, a mega bullish islamic finance. What else did we learn? Comparison between centralized perps versus decentralized on chain perps, where he wants to abstract away all of the experiences that traders go through to use on chain perps.
01:20:03.238 - 01:20:13.858, Speaker C: No more quote unquote bridging, even though under the hood is bridging. Replace the word bridging with deposit. That would remove the distress level of traders. Yeah, I know that feeling myself.
01:20:14.024 - 01:20:20.340, Speaker A: Yeah, it's just the fees, all this stuff, just the security. Like, you worry about security.
01:20:21.350 - 01:20:22.002, Speaker B: And.
01:20:22.136 - 01:20:28.898, Speaker A: Yeah, deposit is just a great framing for how you should build your product if it's an app roll up or et cetera.
01:20:28.994 - 01:21:11.294, Speaker C: He has a very contrarian strategy for user acquisition and growing the L2, because every single other L2 and layer one, they use the same playbook, which is getting listed on exchanges points, the token points, airdrop, getting the user new paradigm. Menta and blast use the airdrop to attract users onto the chain, grow the TVL, which in turn attracts developers to build third party apps, which is a sound strategy, but it is. Everyone does that. And Julian's strategy is the total opposite, which is to enshrine their own first party apps as opposed to depending on third party.
01:21:11.422 - 01:21:11.762, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:21:11.816 - 01:21:35.130, Speaker A: So this is like similar to the osmosis strategy, right, or the Kanto strategy, which is try to build more stuff within the layer one or roll up so that they don't ever have to leave. Because the goal really is to keep the liquidity there. Like, don't let the liquidity leave. And that'll act as a forcing function to increase the TVL users. And it gets stickier.
01:21:35.790 - 01:21:57.074, Speaker C: And the interesting point there is, if the L2 owns the apps, first party apps, rather than third party apps, then you can use the apps to monetize. Yes, rather than using the chain to monetize. So users don't need to pay any on chain transaction fees anymore to the sequencer itself, but rather pay fees to the app.
01:21:57.192 - 01:21:59.950, Speaker A: So we talk about moats for L2s.
01:22:00.030 - 01:22:00.514, Speaker B: Right.
01:22:00.632 - 01:22:12.498, Speaker A: And to me, after I got off the call, I felt as if L2s may not really have a moat. They do now. Right. Obviously, infrastructure that they provide sequencing.
01:22:12.674 - 01:22:15.186, Speaker B: But if you build an app roll.
01:22:15.218 - 01:22:21.530, Speaker A: Up, let's say in Julian's. Let's just say in Julian's case, he has the best perps on there. He has the best decks on there, whatever.
01:22:21.600 - 01:22:21.882, Speaker B: Right.
01:22:21.936 - 01:22:37.120, Speaker A: And then founders go and look like, okay, well, I'll just build here because there's this incredible vibrant ecosystem. Is there the inverse? That could happen from this, where app roll ups could cannibalize L2s? Like L2.
01:22:37.490 - 01:22:38.602, Speaker C: Generic L2s.
01:22:38.666 - 01:22:39.966, Speaker A: Generic L2s, exactly.
01:22:40.068 - 01:22:41.390, Speaker B: Yeah, of course.
01:22:41.460 - 01:22:49.826, Speaker C: I mean, ultimately if you have a bunch of app specific roll ups, then again the L2s just become testnets for the new products.
01:22:50.008 - 01:23:11.222, Speaker A: Who owns what in terms of moat here? We talked about this last podcast, which is base could easily spin out and they could create their own op stack, right, where they don't have to use op, they can just fork op, build out their own stack and allow people to build on it. But then those app roll ups, if they get big enough, they could do the same thing. So who owns what? What's the actual mode here?
01:23:11.276 - 01:23:13.722, Speaker C: The brand is the mode to start with.
01:23:13.856 - 01:23:16.042, Speaker A: But then once you build your own brand, then what?
01:23:16.096 - 01:23:36.338, Speaker C: But the tech stack is also a mode. Like when Bayes uses op stack and they have a bunch of developers such as Friendtech building on top of bays, which is basically building on top of op stack. Base cannot easily switch to another tech stack because if they do, they lose the developers. The tech stack is not compatible with each other.
01:23:36.424 - 01:23:50.102, Speaker A: Well, I guess I get where you're getting at. Okay, so that stack is harder. Well, yeah, because if you were to fork op, convince developers to build on that. But that's just a completely new chain that you have to convince developers to build on, right?
01:23:50.236 - 01:24:01.926, Speaker C: Yeah, but pure point. The fact that op is open source, op can monetize in some other way by selling the op stack. I don't know how much revenue.
01:24:02.118 - 01:24:23.262, Speaker A: Yeah, I think sequencing makes sense from us as a source of revenue, right. For them, sequencing, I don't know. It's still unclear for me how I get the framing of like the tech stack is kind of what drives some sort of alignment to op. But there's still no value accrual, right? Yeah, I'm not sure. It's still very unclear for me.
01:24:23.396 - 01:24:26.310, Speaker C: After so many years in crypto, I just stopped thinking about moats.
01:24:26.410 - 01:24:27.406, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean there's no moat.
01:24:27.438 - 01:24:28.526, Speaker A: Who gives a shit?
01:24:28.718 - 01:24:34.926, Speaker C: There's that. But also the fact that the space moves so fast, you cannot think much more beyond one cycle.
01:24:35.038 - 01:24:35.794, Speaker B: You can't be right.
01:24:35.832 - 01:24:36.510, Speaker A: Curve here.
01:24:36.600 - 01:24:49.222, Speaker C: It's futile to think that far into the future. Yeah, I just think in terms of one cycle, but within that cycle, within the time horizon of one cycle, I don't think mode matters that much.
01:24:49.356 - 01:24:50.474, Speaker B: At the end of day, within one.
01:24:50.512 - 01:24:52.490, Speaker C: Cycle, it's attention, it's narrative.
01:24:52.830 - 01:24:56.474, Speaker A: Well, it's a treasure, too, right? It's the treasury. It's the people.
01:24:56.592 - 01:24:57.530, Speaker B: It's the.
01:24:57.680 - 01:25:00.830, Speaker A: I think I know what it is. It's the religion.
01:25:01.650 - 01:25:02.874, Speaker B: That's the moat.
01:25:03.002 - 01:25:24.306, Speaker A: It's the religion. Interesting. This was a good revelation. Thank you. I have been now baptized. All right, this is fun. We're going to have some special speakers coming around the next few weeks.
01:25:24.306 - 01:25:36.086, Speaker A: A fun one is with Zion. We're actually going to be meeting him up in real life and recording a podcast with him, so that'll be fun.
01:25:36.188 - 01:25:36.486, Speaker B: All right.
01:25:36.508 - 01:25:40.758, Speaker A: So if you have any questions for him, hit us up. Otherwise, we'll catch you next time.
01:25:40.844 - 01:25:41.334, Speaker B: Next time.
01:25:41.372 - 01:25:46.100, Speaker A: Thanks for listening to good game. Don't forget to subscribe. We'll see you next week.
