00:00:00.120 - 00:00:56.274, Speaker A: I think this is probably one of the most critical lessons for every founder, probably every founder in every vertical, but certainly more pronounced in prefixal work, which is that you will never get your token design right on the first attempt. No matter how hard you try, no matter how much financial modeling you do, no matter how much you prepare, no matter how many independent pairs of eyes to look at and criticize your initial draft, you will never get it right. And you should expect to change it in production and to experiment with new models. In production, helium has changed their models multiple times, and it's still changing right. The latest iteration from what I've seen is creating this two new sub tokens, one mobile, like the mobile token for the 5g network, and the other token for the IoT network, and then having the HNT token backing both under the hood. So it's still changing, and that's the expectation that every founder in this space should have. You'll never get it right and continue to experiment in production.
