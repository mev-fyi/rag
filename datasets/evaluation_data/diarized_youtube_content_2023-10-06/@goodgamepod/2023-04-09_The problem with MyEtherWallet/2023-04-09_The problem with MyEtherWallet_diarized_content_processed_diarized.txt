00:00:00.200 - 00:00:17.678, Speaker A: The other way. I remember using myether wallet. Myether Wallet curates a number of applications that you can access from my ether wallet website, but the problem with that is you have to rely on their curation. You cannot just access any decentralized applications. And two.
00:00:17.846 - 00:00:18.726, Speaker B: I'm not sure if you.
00:00:18.750 - 00:00:35.500, Speaker A: Could use hardware wallet in conjunction with Myether Wallet to access these decentralized applications, but in other case, metamask as a browser extension was really groundbreaking in terms of the personal impact from my own personal experience. User experience without metamask, Defi summer would not have happened.
00:00:35.572 - 00:00:41.892, Speaker C: Basically, without ethereum mist without metamask, we wouldn't be where we are today.
00:00:41.988 - 00:00:42.284, Speaker A: That's right.
