00:00:00.400 - 00:00:46.573, Speaker A: Welcome to Goodgame. Your no BS insights for crypto founders. The way I see this ciao is this is the first phase, right? Maybe the third phase, maybe the third cycle, the next cycle, the cycle after, there will be more infrastructure or tooling or et cetera that's available. Or maybe celebrities see that, hey, maybe I could start to use my token holders as a way to enable my influence or increase my influence or try out new products and things like that. But you have to start somewhere, right? And right now I think the experiment is whether or not celebrities will launch their own token and if they do, what type of effects will they see from it?
00:00:46.669 - 00:00:59.799, Speaker B: Okay, so here's how I think about it. Celebrity coins are probably going to be a thing and a pretty big thing. And if you really think about it, friendtech and fantasy, they are celebrity points for crypto. Twitter microcelebrities.
00:00:59.927 - 00:01:03.055, Speaker A: Yep. Looking for your next startup idea in crypto?
00:01:03.175 - 00:01:04.791, Speaker B: Check out our request for startups list.
00:01:04.823 - 00:01:33.595, Speaker A: And get inspired at Alliance XYZ Ideas. Did you see, I just watched a video on Twitter about what was it? Jim Cramer interviewing Gary Gensler. He's like, look at all these tokens. Sushiswap, bonk, et cetera. They're all trading millions. Why don't we have a bonk ETF yet? You should have seen Gary's face when Jim Kramer said that.
00:01:33.975 - 00:01:35.711, Speaker B: What did he say? What did Gary say?
00:01:35.823 - 00:02:11.895, Speaker A: He goes, he paused for a second and you could see his face twitching a bit. But what he ended up saying was something about like tokens need disclosures, people. And then he like pivoted really quickly to how it was SEC's 90th birthday or some shit like that. But he didn't, he didn't really have a compelling reply to that. Which to me means that I feel the war between tokens became becoming securities or not. I think the war is being won slightly by us, the crypto natives, which is a very good sign. But yeah, we have a lot to talk about today.
00:02:11.895 - 00:02:23.009, Speaker A: We haven't done our one on one interviews. It's been some time, so I think we have a lot to cover and there are a lot of people that want to know what's going on, what some of the newer trends that are coming to place.
00:02:23.137 - 00:02:25.081, Speaker B: Yeah, what's on your mind?
00:02:25.273 - 00:02:43.235, Speaker A: Celebrity tokens is one. The other is I haven't had a chance to watch the battle between Anatoly and Justin, but I've seen some tweets so we could talk about that. One was the economic security is a meme. I Think that was very interesting.
00:02:43.615 - 00:02:45.943, Speaker B: Let's just start with the celeb coins.
00:02:46.079 - 00:03:05.879, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, celebrity tokens. I feel it's the same as any new token that enters into any new category of tokens that come into the crypto ecosystem. People come and they shun it. They think it's bad for crypto and then you have two sides that are fighting it.
00:03:06.047 - 00:03:14.869, Speaker B: I feel like it's a knee jerk reaction based on what happened last cycle. Weren't there a lot of celebrities that launched their NFT collections last cycle?
00:03:14.917 - 00:03:16.505, Speaker A: Mostly it was NFTs. Yeah.
00:03:17.125 - 00:03:18.493, Speaker B: And they all went to zero.
00:03:18.629 - 00:03:34.565, Speaker A: Yeah. But so many other projects went to zero as well. Almost every NFT project went to zero, except for maybe four. I mean, like a handful, right. That didn't go to zero. Everything else went to zero.
00:03:34.685 - 00:03:43.035, Speaker B: So do you remember who launched last cycle? I feel like Mayweather did one.
00:03:43.455 - 00:03:52.783, Speaker A: Mayweather. I had the list up earlier. Snoop Dogg, Gary. Gary V. Tony Hawk, Paris Hilton.
00:03:52.959 - 00:03:59.335, Speaker B: Wait. They all wait. Snoop Dogg launched his own nft or he lost.
00:03:59.375 - 00:04:00.423, Speaker A: I thought it was apes.
00:04:00.559 - 00:04:01.675, Speaker B: I thought he was just.
00:04:01.855 - 00:04:25.895, Speaker A: The collection features NFT themed artwork and original soundtrack referred to as nft. The rapper released another NFT collection dubbed the Snoop Dogg Passport series. Gary Vee obviously launched his own NFT collection called Veefriends, which went to zero. Tony Hawk, the Last Trick Skateboard. NFT collection. Paris Hilton, the Planet Paris. NFT collection.
00:04:25.895 - 00:04:36.645, Speaker A: Grimes. Yeah, so I mean, they're Lindsay Lohan, Floyd Mayweather, Mike Tyson, Robert De Niro. I remember Robert De Niro's NFT collection.
00:04:36.805 - 00:04:44.785, Speaker B: My God, Trump. Trump did three. There's some research. Trump released, released three collections, all went to zero.
00:04:45.445 - 00:04:54.517, Speaker A: I mean, that's no different than any other. I mean like I could name like 10 well known. Oh, here's a good one. Murat, Pakistan. Do you know that Twitter handle?
00:04:54.621 - 00:04:55.509, Speaker B: Who's that?
00:04:55.677 - 00:05:15.733, Speaker A: He's a very well known digital artist and everyone in the NFT community idolized his artwork. Like literally idolized him. He did an NFT sale. He took in about 70 or 80 million dollars. Clutch went to zero. Not a celebrity. Not a celebrity.
00:05:15.733 - 00:05:40.427, Speaker A: We're talking NFT crypto digital artist, native extracted 70, 80 million dollars and went to zero. He doesn't even talk about the collection anymore. So I don't know. I think there's both sides to this argument, which is, I think NFTs may not have been the right medium. Two is, I think utility is another meme. I don't know if it's true or not. Where people want to see some Sort of meme effect to it, which is.
00:05:40.451 - 00:05:41.779, Speaker B: Basically what Vitalik tweeted.
00:05:41.867 - 00:05:47.165, Speaker A: Yeah. What do you tweet once you read that up or just summary?
00:05:47.665 - 00:06:03.385, Speaker B: He says something to the effect of he's not very inspired by the celebrity coin experiments of the cycle, blah, blah, blah. He wants to see some utility and I can't remember what type of utilities he wanted to see.
00:06:03.425 - 00:06:05.921, Speaker A: Maybe some something about donations or something, right?
00:06:05.953 - 00:06:06.737, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, donation.
00:06:06.801 - 00:06:09.285, Speaker A: Yeah, but he always says that.
00:06:10.145 - 00:06:11.289, Speaker B: Yeah, that's true.
00:06:11.417 - 00:06:26.405, Speaker A: But then somebody else sent a tweet that says Samson and his Twitter handle is fuck your puts. He says, casino owner gets mad, everyone is gambling.
00:06:31.305 - 00:06:39.805, Speaker B: Oh. Vitalik wanted to see some downloading, like basically the holders of the celebrity coin to influence what the celebrity can do.
00:06:40.225 - 00:07:19.743, Speaker A: I think, look, the way I see this chow is this is the first phase, right? Maybe the third phase, maybe the third cycle, the next cycle, the cycle after, there'll be more infrastructure or tooling or et cetera, that's available. Or maybe celebrities see that, hey, maybe I could start to use my token holders as a way to enable my influence or increase my influence or try out new products and things like that. But you have to start somewhere, right? And right now I think the experiment is whether or not celebrities will launch their own token and if they do, what type of effects will they see from it?
00:07:19.839 - 00:07:32.967, Speaker B: Okay, so here's how I think about it. Celebrity coins are probably going to be a thing and a pretty big thing. And if you really think about it, FriendTech and fantasy, they are celebrity coins for crypto. Twitter micro celebrities.
00:07:33.111 - 00:07:33.879, Speaker A: Yep.
00:07:34.047 - 00:08:06.605, Speaker B: And Frantic provides some utility, which is messaging, enabling the super fans to chat with the celebrity, the micro celebrity in a small chat group. And fantasy is more speculative, but it's also fun. It's also very entertaining. The crypto Twitter micro celebrities compete with each other and shitpost. It's pretty fun. But the way I think about the celebrities, the quote unquote, real celebrities outside of crypto, is that either that'll happen this cycle or next cycle. So you might be too early.
00:08:06.605 - 00:08:30.909, Speaker B: So for friend tech and fantasy, I mean, they currently work very well within crypto, but my guess is at some point they're going to expand beyond crypto. And the question is whether or not the people outside this crypto bubble are willing to embrace a consumer experience like FriendTech and fantasy. So that might be this cycle, that might be next cycle, but either way I think it's going to happen.
00:08:31.077 - 00:09:02.885, Speaker A: I'm in agreement with that, but it's just interesting to see the vitrol Right, Yeah. And it seems to me that the crypto community, they want adoption and they want more and more people coming to space. But you have to be open. You have to be a bit more open about the types of changes that could come from being open. We can't be this nerdy groups of technical research or et cetera, just kind of working on your own thing. You have to open it up to everyone. And the world has 7 to 8 billion people.
00:09:02.885 - 00:09:14.733, Speaker A: You're going to see different types of cultures that are going to embrace crypto in different ways. And some of it you're going to like, some of it you're not. But you know, you have to at least have an open mind as to how people are going to use it in their own day to day lives.
00:09:14.829 - 00:09:23.949, Speaker B: I think people are shooting down the entire concept of celebrity, celebrity coins, which is a little bit too premature. What they should be doing is calling out the bad actors.
00:09:24.077 - 00:09:54.537, Speaker A: Yes. I mean, like we should be donating to Zach xbt. He's doing an incredible job on calling out bad actors. It's funny, as soon as some of these celebrity tokens went live, you and I chatted about donating more to Zack XBT on the side. And I think that's what everyone should be doing is like investing more time and infrastructure on calling out bad actors so that we could filter out the good from the bad and allow people to decide or give them an easier way to decide on who they want to buy.
00:09:54.601 - 00:09:59.825, Speaker B: I wanted to see people like why people are so angry. So I tweeted this all.
00:09:59.985 - 00:10:01.393, Speaker A: When did you tweet it? Today.
00:10:01.569 - 00:10:02.961, Speaker B: I think it was last week.
00:10:03.073 - 00:10:03.769, Speaker A: Okay.
00:10:03.937 - 00:10:28.335, Speaker B: Share screen. All right, here. All right, so I asked why weren't people angry at Trump NFTs because he was NFTs, not tokens. Or because it was the former POTUS and not some C tier celebrities? Or because Trump was rich enough that we knew he wasn't going to rug retail. Or because he created utility by inviting NFT holders to Mar a Lago. Where do we draw the line? Genuine question. So there were a lot of answers.
00:10:28.335 - 00:10:57.491, Speaker B: So I'll just quote a few that I found interesting or reasonable. So John Charbonneau said, the person doesn't matter at all. It's transparency. Selling NFTs for dollars have ongoing royalty fees, et cetera is fine. No different than any artist launching a meme coin. You don't disclose that you own or snipe a bunch, pump it, then dump on people without disclosing is wild. So I agree with this one.
00:10:57.491 - 00:11:22.725, Speaker B: But the solution here is also very simple, right? Which is you either don't let the celebrities, you know, do some pre mine, quote unquote, pre mine, or you do let them own or snipe a percentage of their own tokens, but with vesting in a way that basically they can't dump immediately. So if this is what people are angry about, the solution seems fairly.
00:11:23.745 - 00:11:49.953, Speaker A: I don't agree with the. If you read, I replied to that tweet too, I remember this. But I don't agree with John's reasoning either. Because people that launch NFT collections, it's a one sided market, they just take the money up front. So like the guy that Murad Pak that I talked about, he raised 70 million bucks and he never did anything afterwards. So I mean, that's effectively dumping on his, on retail.
00:11:50.129 - 00:11:51.409, Speaker B: Oh, I agree with you.
00:11:51.537 - 00:12:19.555, Speaker A: So like having royalty fees or it doesn't matter. Like what matters is whether or not the celebrity is going to pay attention to the project. That's what it comes down to. Are they going to make this as part of their, you know, identity is essentially what we want to know. You don't even have to provide utility. Okay, so like if you look at Mother, right, Iggy's coin, she's not providing any utility. What she's doing is she's making the token as part of her brand identity.
00:12:19.555 - 00:13:01.735, Speaker A: And that is enough, that is enough for people to say like, okay, she cares about the token, she's going to make it a part of her brand identity. People will continue to buy. That's a start, right? I'm not saying that is the end all solution, but I think what the market wants is artists to pay attention to the collection they launched and to provide some attention to it throughout its course. That's it. Like with Trump as an example, he provided some attention and the way he did that was by inviting people to the conference so that he could get their opinion on crypto. Right? That's all we have to do. We don't have to do anything else.
00:13:01.735 - 00:13:03.903, Speaker A: And I think that's a very good starting point.
00:13:03.999 - 00:13:15.471, Speaker B: Wait, but Iggy and Trump are two very different cases. Trump tried to create some utility, quote unquote utility the third time around. Yes, the third time.
00:13:15.503 - 00:13:16.359, Speaker A: Yes, yes.
00:13:16.447 - 00:13:19.631, Speaker B: Iggy is a Mother, is a pure meme coin.
00:13:19.783 - 00:13:50.069, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm just giving you both examples. One for NFTs, one for meme coins. What I'm trying to get at is it's the same thing, right? At the end of the day, whether you launch an NFT Collection. Whether you launch a shitcoin that's tied to your identity, what the market wants at the end of the day is some attention to that collection or to that token. That's it. So if you go on Iggy's Twitter right now, a part of her entire feud is mother. Exactly right.
00:13:50.069 - 00:14:19.425, Speaker A: I'm not saying you need to completely, like, become a shitcoin chiller. Not saying that. What I'm saying is you need to make this as part of your identity in order for the token to have some growth and attention. Then once you give it some attention, then you could start to build products around it if they decide to do it. I just think we're an inning one of celeb and just like creator tokens in general, I do think over time there will be a lot of products that will be built around this, but you have to start somewhere.
00:14:19.725 - 00:14:34.821, Speaker B: Here's another take. Basically, people are angry because Ansem is on the other side and he's the main character of the cycle. How much do you think that contributed?
00:14:34.973 - 00:14:55.989, Speaker A: I think there's a part to it. Yeah. I mean, people aren't. Ansem is the main character and, you know, there are some takes that he has. Okay, so like, you know, the other. Maybe for the audience that haven't watched or haven't been on Twitter and some also co launch. I wouldn't say co launch, but he was part of the.
00:14:55.989 - 00:14:59.181, Speaker A: The launch of only one, which is like an only fans and crypto.
00:14:59.253 - 00:15:00.933, Speaker B: Yeah, that. That coincided.
00:15:01.069 - 00:15:01.861, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:02.053 - 00:15:03.189, Speaker B: With the celebrity points.
00:15:03.237 - 00:15:15.519, Speaker A: Yeah. So this happened right before celebrity tokens. And, you know, obviously the community, the crypto community, they were upset because they're calling him, you know, all sorts of, you know, words.
00:15:15.687 - 00:15:18.119, Speaker B: Ansem Angels is a meme. Right. It's.
00:15:18.247 - 00:15:19.391, Speaker A: It's just a meme.
00:15:19.543 - 00:15:22.455, Speaker B: It's not Ansem's like, he's not getting.
00:15:22.495 - 00:15:23.279, Speaker A: Anything out of it.
00:15:23.367 - 00:15:25.231, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. It's a meme.
00:15:25.343 - 00:15:44.113, Speaker A: It's a meme. It's a marketing, Branding. Right. It's really what it is. So, yeah, I mean, the community got upset because he's, you know, quote unquote, taking advantage of women or whatever you want to call it, but really it's just an only fans and he's just building a narrative around only fans and crypto.
00:15:44.249 - 00:15:44.993, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:15:45.169 - 00:15:56.593, Speaker A: So I do think there's also other narratives that are pushing against ansem and like the celeb tokens, which is why people are so angry about this to start with. So there is some truth to that.
00:15:56.769 - 00:16:27.989, Speaker B: There are some very Politically incorrect views. I won't quote them, but do you think there's a. Is it a coincidence that the vast majority of those celebrities that launched the token last couple of weeks were rappers? So basically, there's Rich the Kid, there's Davido. Davido Money Back, Yo Up Red Iki is also a rapper, right?
00:16:28.077 - 00:16:29.213, Speaker A: Iggy's a rapper.
00:16:29.349 - 00:16:34.185, Speaker B: The only one who's not a rapper is Caitlyn Jenner and Mayweather.
00:16:34.725 - 00:16:39.705, Speaker A: Caitlyn Jenner. That came out of nowhere. I. I did not expect that at all.
00:16:40.565 - 00:16:45.069, Speaker B: But that was a rug. That was the. Was this Sahil.
00:16:45.237 - 00:16:48.349, Speaker A: Sahil Aurora? Yeah, yeah. He.
00:16:48.477 - 00:16:52.233, Speaker B: Apparently he's engineered those celebrities for launching a coin.
00:16:52.349 - 00:17:04.201, Speaker A: I don't think Caitlin knows at all. She just. They probably just tell her, hey, record this video for me, and she just repeats what they say. So, I mean, that. That in itself is a different situation.
00:17:04.393 - 00:17:07.885, Speaker B: Do you think it's a coincidence that most of those people are rappers?
00:17:08.305 - 00:17:41.913, Speaker A: Well, I mean, like, I think rappers are the easier targets, in my opinion. I don't know. Like, maybe it's the culture, maybe it's the rappers are trying to get attention. Maybe the D List rappers that want to make, you know, quick money or whatnot, grifters, et cetera, they've turned into grift. I know Soulja Boy Zach. XBT called out Soulja Boy many, many times because he launched like three or four collections, whether it was Shitcoins or NFTs, and they all went to zero. So, yeah, I do think that there is some, like, commonality over.
00:17:41.913 - 00:18:16.435, Speaker A: Over the years of, like, rappers like D List, F List artists that come in and they just take advantage of their wealth or their network for wealth, and it's primarily because they probably can't get any deals right. I mean, all they could do is post on Instagram and Twitter, and for them it's like, okay, if I can make 50,000 or $100,000 rugging my fans, so be it. I don't have anything else to sell them anyways. I think that's kind of the way they think about it. Those types of actors have to be called up 100%. But there are some that are. They're genuinely good.
00:18:16.435 - 00:18:22.683, Speaker A: And obviously it's still an experiment. I could be wrong and they could also go to zero, but I do think it's worth a shot.
00:18:22.779 - 00:18:27.539, Speaker B: Do you remember when. When Pump got hacked a couple of weeks ago.
00:18:27.707 - 00:18:28.083, Speaker A: Yes.
00:18:28.139 - 00:18:31.763, Speaker B: Exploited and then Stack. Who was the hacker?
00:18:31.899 - 00:18:32.651, Speaker A: Stack Overflow.
00:18:32.683 - 00:18:41.099, Speaker B: Yep. He. He organized a Twitter space and I listened to it and I made you listen to part of it?
00:18:41.147 - 00:18:41.635, Speaker A: Yes, I did.
00:18:41.675 - 00:18:51.667, Speaker B: I was really shocked. There is a world that I didn't know existed. Like, there is a world of users who are on chain that I didn't know was actually on chain.
00:18:51.811 - 00:18:53.851, Speaker A: And, like, tell me more about what you mean by that.
00:18:53.963 - 00:18:57.923, Speaker B: Like, I don't. I don't know who these people are, but they sound like they come from the hood.
00:18:58.059 - 00:19:00.707, Speaker A: Like, oh, yeah, okay.
00:19:00.771 - 00:19:01.659, Speaker B: You know what I mean, right?
00:19:01.707 - 00:19:02.775, Speaker A: Yes, yes, yes, yes.
00:19:04.235 - 00:19:11.339, Speaker B: And also, I think they sound white. They're not. They don't sound black. They sound white. And they're. They sound like they come from the hood.
00:19:11.467 - 00:19:14.587, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I remember.
00:19:14.651 - 00:19:15.819, Speaker B: You know what I'm talking about.
00:19:15.947 - 00:19:16.307, Speaker A: I do.
00:19:16.331 - 00:19:19.131, Speaker B: I do my fingers on what it is. Exactly. But.
00:19:19.243 - 00:19:25.531, Speaker A: And they're so naive also, from what I realized. Like, they. Bullet. They seem to be easily influenced.
00:19:25.683 - 00:19:29.371, Speaker B: Like. Like, one of them was like, yo, bro, you did the right thing.
00:19:29.523 - 00:19:35.175, Speaker A: Yeah, power to the people. Or you're like our Robin Hood. I'm like, what the fuck are you talking about?
00:19:35.835 - 00:19:39.547, Speaker B: The guy got rugged and he praised Stack as the hero.
00:19:39.651 - 00:20:09.969, Speaker A: But I'll tell you why that happened, though. Stack launched a token, or people launched Stack tokens for Stack Overflow. And so a lot of them are bag holders, too, of Stack Overflow's token, which prompted me to tweet, about which I sent a tweet out soon after that said something in order of people that could be bad actors and they want to sway people's opinion about them. All they need to do is launch a token and they could sway their opinion in any way they want. Right?
00:20:10.097 - 00:20:10.805, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:20:11.105 - 00:20:43.219, Speaker A: All you got to do is just get a bunch of people holding your token, and you could be wrong, and you could convince them that you're right because they can make wealth on it. I think we just scratched the surface on social tokens, if you really think about it. I mean, even if you think about, like, you know, like, really big cases that. That everyone is watching, like, I don't know, like, name the next last big case that everyone's following. I don't know. So let's say. I mean, everything that I know right now is crypto.
00:20:43.219 - 00:21:10.121, Speaker A: So I know what. But, you know, like, you know, these large cases or, like, even with Trump. Right. With the Trump token, people are all willing for Trump to win, Right? Because they're all MAGA holders. Or he has a very strong meme. I do think there is a chance for influence, both good and bad, to use a token as a way to convince your audience that you're either right or wrong, it's going to be a very interesting experiment.
00:21:10.193 - 00:21:14.169, Speaker B: So what's in your mind? A good celebrity coin design.
00:21:14.337 - 00:21:20.281, Speaker A: Phase one, I think is just making the token a part of your identity. Phase one, I'm not saying the token.
00:21:20.313 - 00:21:25.409, Speaker B: Itself doesn't have anything special like the on chain. The smart contract doesn't have anything special.
00:21:25.457 - 00:21:55.825, Speaker A: It's just the make it part of your identity. Like if you're doing a music video, shout it out, right? If you are doing, I don't know, some, you know, I don't know, you're talking to people or you're on Instagram or Twitter, just shout it out. Like make it a part of your brand identity, I think is the number one thing. Then we know that this is the consensus that the token will continue to live on. It's not just a shitcoin that people drop. Make it a part of your. That's I feel like the lowest hanging fruit.
00:21:55.825 - 00:22:15.465, Speaker A: Phase two, three. Phase two could be something as simple as the top 20 token holders could get a VIP status to one of the events that I'm hosting. Right. It could be a screener for a movie that you're doing. I mean this is, this already exists today. That's how we do this.
00:22:16.215 - 00:22:17.127, Speaker B: A chat group.
00:22:17.231 - 00:22:35.247, Speaker A: A chat group. Eventually, like a chat group, right? Like that's like phase three. Or maybe that's phase two is a chat group and then phase three is like external events. But all of this will come together into like one platform. Right. But you have to start somewhere and I think the way you started is first making it part of your identity to begin with.
00:22:35.351 - 00:22:41.605, Speaker B: I think both, both friend tech and fantasy are better positioned than anyone to win this.
00:22:41.735 - 00:22:50.337, Speaker A: If they wanted to, they can, but they both have their, you know, they have different trade offs that they have to run through. Right?
00:22:50.481 - 00:22:51.205, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:22:52.065 - 00:22:56.625, Speaker A: For Frontec it's the bonding curve I think is the. Is a problem.
00:22:56.705 - 00:23:01.113, Speaker B: Oh, you mean you wanted to graduate into amm?
00:23:01.249 - 00:23:09.325, Speaker A: Yeah, I feel like a token of some sort would be the right approach to get distribution. Fantasy, same thing, right? Like fantasy card to token.
00:23:09.655 - 00:23:14.151, Speaker B: But fantasy doesn't need to do anything more, anything extra. I think they just need to onboard.
00:23:14.183 - 00:23:21.607, Speaker A: The celebrities and then anyone that holds the card could get access is what you're saying. Or maybe like the. Not even that.
00:23:21.671 - 00:23:33.375, Speaker B: Like you just need the celebrities to become a hero on fantasy and without doing anything extra they can monetize their Twitter activity.
00:23:33.495 - 00:23:36.185, Speaker A: But you'll want a token, right? I mean that's what people want.
00:23:36.295 - 00:23:45.685, Speaker B: But people clearly also want the cards and people trade the cards and the revenue that's generated goes to the hero.
00:23:45.805 - 00:23:48.573, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's right.
00:23:48.709 - 00:23:57.797, Speaker B: But in the case of fantasy, the card is the token. The NFT is basically an NFT celebrity coin rather than a token celebrity coin.
00:23:57.861 - 00:24:00.885, Speaker A: But you still want tokens for distribution.
00:24:01.045 - 00:24:06.515, Speaker B: It's too complicated. I mean, you just do one or one or the other, not both.
00:24:07.135 - 00:24:16.143, Speaker A: Yeah, unsure. So then people would have to onboard through the app, buy the NFT card and then they get access to the celebrity. Is that the idea?
00:24:16.279 - 00:24:17.183, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:24:17.199 - 00:24:18.671, Speaker A: I could see it work, but I can.
00:24:18.703 - 00:24:35.391, Speaker B: Another path is this company that we're incubating. It's called Circle Tech. So basically by owning the token of the celebrity, you have access to the celebrity's time that is proportional to how much you own or the price you paid.
00:24:35.463 - 00:24:43.639, Speaker A: Tell me more about the time. Actually, I know we've been talking about this, but how do you see this being different than say a celebrity token?
00:24:43.767 - 00:24:49.335, Speaker B: Well, think of, think of it this way. Think of calendar, but financialized.
00:24:49.455 - 00:24:50.015, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:24:50.135 - 00:25:04.385, Speaker B: So you put time on some. So you. A bunch of people, a bunch of super fans bid for the celebrity's time and whoever gets the highest bid gets to place a meeting on the. On the calendar.
00:25:04.505 - 00:25:20.485, Speaker A: I like the timing. I think it's. I think it'll skew more towards. If you remember Intro.com, it's like a very popular app. I wouldn't say they're celebrities per se, but they're probably celebrities in different. I'd say they're domain experts in different experts.
00:25:21.085 - 00:25:23.245, Speaker B: Intro.com is more like a GLG.
00:25:23.405 - 00:25:52.409, Speaker A: Yeah, GLG. So GLG. So I feel like Circle Tech will skew more towards that. I'm sure celebrities will use it, but this is probably going to be more of a meaningful, like income for. For these experts versus celebrities. I think celebrities want low touch and high scale. And so for them, I think something like a fantasy front tech could also work, which is, you know, one message group with all of their super fans in one group.
00:25:52.409 - 00:26:03.433, Speaker A: And it's just, they're just, you know, instead of sending a tweet, you're sending a message to your group. Right. And they've given you millions of dollars a year. Like, of course you're going to spend some attention to it. Right.
00:26:03.489 - 00:26:34.395, Speaker B: Oh, so the low touch, high scale, that's a good mental framework because that's like the fantasy probably falls under that category because all you need to do as a celebrity is to ship host and you don't need to deal with the Individual super fans one at a time, which would be very high touch. Whereas friend tech is more higher touch. It's higher touch, lower scale because you're talking to maybe 30 super fans at a time rather than 30,000, 30 million.
00:26:35.815 - 00:27:11.775, Speaker A: We know this through experience. But if you're not actively engaging in community, we have our own good game chat on frontech as an example. If you're not actively engaging that chat, people will sell your key because they don't see the value. So I feel like I'm like, I feel like I'm on pressure all the time and celebrities that feel like they're on pressure, they're going to say fuck this, like, you know, I'm going to go spend time somewhere else. So high touch, low scale for celebrities is I think the right approach, which is why I think tokens make the perfect sense, most perfect sense. Because it's scale and slow touch. All you got to do is talk about it.
00:27:11.775 - 00:27:39.075, Speaker A: Like you don't have to just talk about it. And then you start with that and then over time you could start to see products being built. It's simple, as if you're doing something in real life. You can ask your token holders what they should do next. What do you guys think I should do next? Just get them involved. And that's what people want. I mean, what is reality tv? I mean, it's the same thing, isn't it? Like you're getting people involved in your life and people watch it.
00:27:39.075 - 00:28:02.701, Speaker A: I mean, I don't watch it, but billions of people watch it. So I think tokens will. Could play the same effect, but a little bit more. I feel like tokens could become, I mean like the bad effects of token celebrity tokens could be that, you know, surveillance. Right. I mentioned this on the side, which is, you know, people want to know everything that's happening. They want to start speculating on people's lives almost to the.
00:28:02.853 - 00:28:03.625, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:28:05.165 - 00:28:15.661, Speaker A: I mean that it could become. I don't know if it could become like that, but it could, right? Like. Like something happens bad to a celebrity, you sell it. I don't know, but I could see something like that playing out.
00:28:15.733 - 00:28:29.031, Speaker B: Kanze, do you remember? I mean, this is very dark and extreme, but remember back in the day people thought that Augur was. Or predation markets were going to become or. Or were going to create assassination markets.
00:28:29.133 - 00:28:30.739, Speaker A: Yes, I remember that.
00:28:30.867 - 00:28:33.179, Speaker B: That hasn't happened yet. I don't think that has happened.
00:28:33.307 - 00:29:06.157, Speaker A: No, but I don't want to see it happen. No, but yeah, like it could become very. I Mean, it could, we could live in a very weird world in the next 10 years where every celebrity token, every token, every celebrity has a token that represents them. Right. It could become dystopian in that sense and everything is hyper financialized and people could get movie parts just based on the token holders and the token value because you know, you could guarantee that there are enough people to watch that movie as an example. Yeah, right. I don't know, just thinking out loud.
00:29:06.181 - 00:29:14.325, Speaker B: Here, I feel like a lot of people don't want us, don't want that to become a reality. But I feel it's going to happen regardless.
00:29:14.485 - 00:29:37.995, Speaker A: It's going to happen regardless. I mean, you know, there are parts of where of it where I don't like either. You know, a living stock ticker about your life. I mean, like, do you really want that? Yeah, I don't know if everybody wants that. Wealth could be created but then you're also. Your life is put on a bonding curve. Do you really want your life on a bonding curve? No.
00:29:38.895 - 00:29:43.343, Speaker B: I mean, I experienced that with Frantic and it's a lot of pressure.
00:29:43.479 - 00:29:44.823, Speaker A: It's a lot of pressure.
00:29:44.959 - 00:29:45.439, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:29:45.527 - 00:30:06.693, Speaker A: It's almost similar to. Do you remember, I may have talked about this in the last pod, but do you know that guy that started off on YouTube in 2007 or eight just trying out different food items. He was like a skinny young guy, I don't know, 25 years old. And he's experimenting the food. This was, I don't know, 20 years ago or something. Now if you go on this.
00:30:06.829 - 00:30:08.685, Speaker B: Huh, Was that on YouTube?
00:30:08.805 - 00:30:20.139, Speaker A: YouTube. I'll get the guy's name in a second. But now if you go on YouTube, he's like 400 pounds, taking all these food items, putting in a blender, mixing it and drinking it.
00:30:20.267 - 00:30:20.899, Speaker B: Oh my God.
00:30:20.947 - 00:30:45.721, Speaker A: Do you know who I'm talking about? Yeah, yeah, I forgot his name. But that's what streaming did to people. Streaming views, likes. What do you think happened? That's what happened. You put your life, you base your life on unlikes and views. So what you're saying is correct in that the world that we're heading towards, we're already in that world whether we like it or not. And it's just going to become hyper financialized.
00:30:45.721 - 00:30:53.145, Speaker A: I mean, people are getting paid for the views and likes already. They're already getting paid for it. I think it's just going to be more integrated is the way I see it.
00:30:53.265 - 00:31:41.233, Speaker B: By the way, for those who are experimenting with celebrity coins, the Solana token extension could be very Interesting to look at. So one of the things that it enables is enforcing a royalty on every transaction, even if the token is trading on an AMM like Raydium or Orca. So when you launch a celebrity coin or even an NFT on Ethereum, remember back in the day, like maybe a year ago, there was a lot of discussion, debate around royalty, nft, royalty, and the fact that it couldn't be enforced. So with Solana celebrity coins, or with a Solana token extension, you can enforce a tax on every trade and that tax can go back to the creator. So that's one of the things that the token extension can enable. But there's probably other things.
00:31:41.329 - 00:32:02.643, Speaker A: I think I like that idea because then you're putting the. Then it changes the dynamics of how a celeb views its coin. Right. From either sniping a large percentage early on and then waiting for the right time to sell or whatever. You could change it to the point where you just want people trading your token. Right. So volatility.
00:32:02.819 - 00:32:06.683, Speaker B: But you're constantly encouraged to create attention.
00:32:06.859 - 00:32:26.841, Speaker A: Exactly. So then you have this volatility. And volatility is, you know, there's attrition and then that's how you make your money. Right. And so that is another design choice that I'd love to see more out there and see how it looks like. So the creator I was talking about, sorry, was Nicholas Perry. It's pretty sad, but, you know, it's the world we live in.
00:32:27.003 - 00:32:40.069, Speaker B: There's a new trend I'm seeing on TikTok. I use TikTok way too much, but there's a new trend where I see people stream, you know, very mundane, you know, parts of their life, like sleeping or cooking. Like, nothing interesting happens.
00:32:40.117 - 00:32:45.109, Speaker A: Oh, yeah. Or eating. People eating. Yeah. And people watch it.
00:32:45.237 - 00:33:00.857, Speaker B: Yeah, people watch that. People want to feel connected to normal people. Like, people love seeing very mundane aspects of other people's life because people's own life is pretty mundane and boring. So people want to feel that they're not alone.
00:33:01.041 - 00:33:16.097, Speaker A: I also think it's different perspectives. Right. So for me, I. I don't say I watch mundane per se, but I do watch videos of, like, villagers. You ever watch those videos of villagers? They, like, create a house from, like.
00:33:16.161 - 00:33:17.329, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, I love watching that.
00:33:17.417 - 00:33:18.601, Speaker A: It's so much fun. Right?
00:33:18.673 - 00:33:21.989, Speaker B: Or like primitive. Primitive. Primitive, yeah.
00:33:22.077 - 00:33:34.613, Speaker A: Yeah. I enjoy primitive content because it's, you know, if you were to live in a world with nothing, what would that world look like? But I think it's similar in that sense to them. It's probably mundane. Right. But to us, it's something new and interesting.
00:33:34.749 - 00:33:35.341, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:33:35.453 - 00:33:44.037, Speaker A: And so it's like different perspectives of different lives. Sorry, what point were you getting at with that? With TikTok specifically?
00:33:44.181 - 00:33:58.499, Speaker B: No, just the fact that people are willing to do everything to generate attention and to get paid by streaming their own life day to day life. And there's demand for that. It's kind of wild.
00:33:58.627 - 00:34:27.045, Speaker A: It's wild. I mean, there's demand for any content, really. And so how do you think. I guess, like, how do you think tokens play into this? I mean, I don't know. I don't want to pigeonhole a token. Every crevice of every area I want to talk about, but I do feel like that's going to probably become a thing. So do you think creator tokens could be extended to all creators on YouTube and TikTok? Is this the world that we're going to live in?
00:34:27.165 - 00:34:33.101, Speaker B: There might be new apps that are similar to TikTok, but very financialized.
00:34:33.253 - 00:34:33.781, Speaker A: Got it.
00:34:33.853 - 00:34:41.821, Speaker B: The thing I came to realize by playing fantasy and friend tech is that I don't need to do much to make a lot of money.
00:34:41.973 - 00:34:42.581, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:34:42.693 - 00:34:54.709, Speaker B: Like the content that I put out on Twitter. Oh, okay. So, very interestingly, I get paid on both Twitter and fantasy by tweeting. Right. So when you get a Twitter blue checkmark, you get paid as a creator.
00:34:54.837 - 00:34:56.565, Speaker A: Oh, so are you on that paid list now?
00:34:56.685 - 00:35:07.929, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I make like maybe 500 bucks a month or something. Not bad by tweeting. But on fantasy I make an order of magnitude more, which is really interesting.
00:35:08.057 - 00:35:16.441, Speaker A: I mean, Elon should. I mean, like, Elon would want this. Right? Like, like essentially it's just leverage farming on Twitter.
00:35:16.593 - 00:35:27.121, Speaker B: Yeah. But what I'm trying to get at is I'm doing the. By definition, I'm doing the exact same activity, blue checkmark. And on fantasy.
00:35:27.193 - 00:35:27.473, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:35:27.529 - 00:35:32.451, Speaker B: And yet I get paid way, way, way more on fantasy because people love trading my cards.
00:35:32.563 - 00:35:39.307, Speaker A: So ads could be. Because right now the main revenue generation for Twitter's ads.
00:35:39.451 - 00:35:50.219, Speaker B: Correct. And by extension, the main revenue generation mechanism for creators, Twitter creators, is also ads. Because money, they may come from the money that Twitter makes.
00:35:50.347 - 00:35:51.083, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:35:51.219 - 00:35:56.863, Speaker B: And what you're saying is that mechanism for creator to make money can be replaced.
00:35:56.939 - 00:36:21.663, Speaker A: Yes, Token speculation. Speculation, NFT trading and the chance to earn upside. Right. It's all about the upside at the end of the day. And so the upside is the end goal for all the users. And the attrition or the fees that are collected is what gets you paid As a creator. And that is worth more than what you're getting with ads.
00:36:21.663 - 00:36:53.747, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I see the same with Crate with song music, music tokens. I've talked about Crate before, but you know, Crate is a platform where you could publish your own music by uploading your songs or creating using AI. It generates a token with the bonding curve that's associated with the song. And the creator makes a half a point for all trading fees. And the idea here is pretty simple. If the song is good, people will buy it because they love the song and they see it early. And if it goes viral, then there's upside.
00:36:53.747 - 00:37:23.295, Speaker A: And that upside is what's earned for the people that found the songs early. And the creator gets fees from the trading of the fees. Right. So I do think like trading versus like streaming. As an example, we've talked about how Taylor Swift, she her most popular song, which is like, was it a 100 billion streams? She earned only $4 million in streaming revenue as an example. You could probably say that if it was a token. If she had a token.
00:37:23.295 - 00:37:29.555, Speaker A: If that specific song had a token, it could probably be worth, I mean, she could have collected 5x more easily.
00:37:30.095 - 00:37:49.289, Speaker B: So Joey, the founder of Crate actually made this tweet the other day. We have a case study with the first song, welcome to Crate. At its peak, the artist's tokens were worth $35,000. That's roughly equal to 40 million streams. And this was with zero marketing, promotion, hype, or attention.
00:37:49.417 - 00:37:50.385, Speaker A: It's insanity.
00:37:50.505 - 00:37:57.121, Speaker B: Yep. Like there aren't that many artists or musicians that can generate 40 million streams.
00:37:57.273 - 00:38:19.465, Speaker A: No. And so then the goal for artists is just to go viral. That's it. Right. If they can go viral, then they could get the attention that they're looking for and sign a deal with record companies and then create this whole suite of products around this creator, Whether it's clothing, whether it's music, movies. That's how they generate their wealth. Right.
00:38:19.465 - 00:38:34.813, Speaker A: Product lines. If you're looking, if you look at like celebrities, they all own like a tequila company or you know, a cell phone company. Like there's, there's other ways that they're trying to find and ways to create wealth. And so I do think tokens could subsidize a lot of that.
00:38:34.869 - 00:38:43.701, Speaker B: I mean, I'm okay with a world where we channel some of the djen energy into supporting well intentioned and competent.
00:38:43.853 - 00:38:50.549, Speaker A: Artists, creators, or even finding the next artist or creator. Right. Using tokens as a way to find the next artist.
00:38:50.637 - 00:38:52.381, Speaker B: Tokens would be a great discovery.
00:38:52.413 - 00:38:59.149, Speaker A: Mechanism versus discovering algorithms and other promoters. Right?
00:38:59.277 - 00:39:06.833, Speaker B: Yeah. So you discover content and great artists through the market rather than through algorithms.
00:39:07.009 - 00:39:12.401, Speaker A: So I do think that's interesting. Just forgot I was going to say something. I can't think of it.
00:39:12.553 - 00:39:16.601, Speaker B: Any other hot take, hot take you've seen on Twitter about celebrity coins.
00:39:16.753 - 00:39:19.953, Speaker A: I mean, it's either. It's very binary. People either hate it or they love it.
00:39:20.049 - 00:39:22.673, Speaker B: Yeah. That's why. That's what makes it so interesting.
00:39:22.809 - 00:39:45.783, Speaker A: Yeah, that's why I'm paying attention to it. I mean, I see that, you know why I like, you know, nfa. I have to say this why I like the iggy trade. It reminds me of the whiff trade. I'll tell you why. There was a lot of hate about meme coins around that time and people didn't believe meme coins is a category. So it was very.
00:39:45.783 - 00:39:59.385, Speaker A: I. People did, but it wasn't very clear. Right. And so nobody was really paying attention to meme coins, which is why I thought with was the right trade at that time. To me, iggy seems the same. Same thing. Right.
00:39:59.385 - 00:40:13.165, Speaker A: As long as she doesn't rug. It's very contrarian. No one believes in it. It's not consensus. And eventually, basically the first of its category. It's the first of its category. So I see whiff as the.
00:40:13.165 - 00:40:17.065, Speaker A: I see this as a. As a whiff trade is the way I see it.
00:40:17.145 - 00:40:20.001, Speaker B: Yeah. So zero, zero or a billion.
00:40:20.153 - 00:40:23.641, Speaker A: Correct. Zero or a billion is the way I see this.
00:40:23.753 - 00:40:25.725, Speaker B: The ticker is good, right? Ticker is.
00:40:26.165 - 00:40:51.757, Speaker A: Yeah. She could be the mother of all celeb tokens. So I do think there's some legs there. We just have to wait and see. It's funny. Every time I tweet about celeb tokens on Twitter, Nigel will reply to this tweet to every one of my celeb token tweets and he says, unless Iggy Ruggs and then all bets are off. Every time I tweet about celeb tokens.
00:40:51.901 - 00:40:53.613, Speaker B: There's a lot of truth to that. Right?
00:40:53.709 - 00:41:16.269, Speaker A: It is. And then I then reply back with an emoji with that's a crossing fingers emoji. Obviously, we're taking a bet on our reputation by talking about this stuff, but I feel a bit strongly about it. Right. I do think it can be a category. I could be wrong. Do your own research.
00:41:16.269 - 00:41:29.661, Speaker A: If it becomes a thing, it'll become a very big thing and it could be bigger than or as big as meme coins is the way I see it. Because celebrities have a lot of influence globally. Right. I mean, imagine if you had a Tom Cruise token. How much would you think that would be worth?
00:41:29.733 - 00:41:34.381, Speaker B: I feel like CT would ape into Cindy Sweeney or.
00:41:34.493 - 00:41:35.205, Speaker A: Oh, yeah.
00:41:35.325 - 00:41:37.065, Speaker B: Or Taylor Swift.
00:41:37.925 - 00:41:43.705, Speaker A: Yeah. I feel like that's like two sides of crypto. The research side and.
00:41:44.505 - 00:41:45.473, Speaker B: And ape side.
00:41:45.569 - 00:41:54.205, Speaker A: The consumer side or the ape degen side. Who do you think would ape into Taylor Swift tokens? What side? The research or the consumer?
00:41:55.025 - 00:41:58.577, Speaker B: Taylor Swift. Taylor Swift is the research side, Right? Yeah.
00:41:58.601 - 00:42:09.241, Speaker A: She's a smart. She's smart, like business entrepreneur. Right. And then Sweeney is more like showy, if you know what I mean.
00:42:09.353 - 00:42:10.045, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:42:11.915 - 00:42:13.315, Speaker A: That's great. All right.
00:42:13.355 - 00:42:16.355, Speaker B: I didn't know Mother made all Time high. It's crazy. I thought it was.
00:42:16.395 - 00:42:17.575, Speaker A: Oh, yeah. Nice.
00:42:18.795 - 00:42:21.243, Speaker B: A week ago, I thought. Or maybe four days ago, I thought.
00:42:21.259 - 00:42:29.275, Speaker A: It was the top that I. I bought a bag keeps going Right before. You tweeted that out, right?
00:42:29.315 - 00:42:37.805, Speaker B: Yeah, I. No, I almost tweeted it. This was the top, and I refrained from it because I knew I was gonna. I also get laughed at if I was wrong.
00:42:39.545 - 00:42:41.625, Speaker A: All right, I have to hop off to my next call.
00:42:41.745 - 00:42:43.049, Speaker B: Okay, that's fun.
