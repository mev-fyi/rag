00:00:00.250 - 00:00:41.170, Speaker A: Curve is very interesting because they're taking a complete decentralized approach. Uniswap and curve, even though they seem like their competitors today, over time, the target market of their customers are going to become very different because curve takes a very decentralized approach into their customers. They could list any asset if they wanted to. They don't care about securities laws. They're decentralized in nature. Even if you remember the token launch of curve, it was some anon, if you remember that tweet, it was some llama that somehow got access to the curve smart contracts and kicked off the curve token when it went public. So no one really knows when that happened, how it happened, but it happened versus Uniswap, where Uniswap had like, a certain date where they airdropped tokens.
00:00:41.170 - 00:00:59.500, Speaker A: It was a celebrated event. There was a cool video that came out that celebrated the launch, whereas we had an a on dude that kicked off the token launch for curve that no one who it was. So I think over time, there'll be two different complete markets. And our thesis in a space is that there will probably be two worlds in a space which is regulated and like, completely decentralized world.
