00:00:00.280 - 00:00:27.300, Speaker A: So it sounds like basically developers can build custom features into the browser extension. I've seen the demo of it recently where the user, upon signing transactions, they can see whether or not the transaction is a scam. Yes. They can see whether or not some money is going out. Yeah, this is huge for onboarding retail. Basically, they can see if assets are going out that are receiving an equivalent amount of another assets coming in. Right.
00:00:27.300 - 00:00:38.804, Speaker A: So, for example, when you buy nfts, you're going to spend some ETH, and you want to make sure that you're actually getting nfts in return rather than getting scammed. And so that feature is developed by a third party team, not by Metamask itself.
