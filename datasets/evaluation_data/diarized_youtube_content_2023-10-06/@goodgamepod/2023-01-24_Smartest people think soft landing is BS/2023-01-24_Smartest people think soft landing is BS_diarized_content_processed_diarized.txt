00:00:00.160 - 00:00:24.910, Speaker A: When we talk about hard landing, maybe just do a quick summary. The Fed has always argued that if we were to control the monetary fiscal policy based on where we are, quote unquote, we should hit like a soft landing so that the market wouldn't get impacted too much. But you're arguing, or Drucken Miller is arguing, that there is going to be hard landing. And what does that mean specifically?
00:00:24.982 - 00:00:29.170, Speaker B: All the smartest people I follow believe that the soft landing is bullshit.
00:00:29.242 - 00:00:30.490, Speaker A: So Powell is not right.
00:00:30.602 - 00:00:44.554, Speaker B: Powell is never right. The Fed is a reactive function, not a proactive function, and they might pivot when there is a hard landing, but they can't prevent that from happening. They can't engineer itself landing if they wanted to.
