00:00:00.280 - 00:00:38.224, Speaker A: My problem with that view, the oversight view, whether or not it's good for crypto, I don't have a strong opinion. I can see arguments both ways. But the single biggest problem right now is there's no clarity. And that's what puts founders in a really difficult position. There's no fucking clarity. Like, they're trying to interpret laws from 100 years ago, and we don't know which tokens under what exact criteria should be classified as securities versus commodities. And until Congress comes out with new laws, we can only make some educated guess and take some really conservative stance, like, from a founder's perspective, they want to get into trouble, they need to stay on the conservative side, which, by the way, stiffles innovation.
