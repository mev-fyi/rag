00:00:53.334 - 00:00:56.134, Speaker A: War daddy Capital. Mikado.
00:00:56.294 - 00:00:57.486, Speaker B: Or what's the founder?
00:00:57.550 - 00:00:58.390, Speaker A: Rippet fan.
00:00:58.502 - 00:01:00.814, Speaker B: The other founder, Eric Wall. Nice.
00:01:00.934 - 00:01:06.594, Speaker A: Eric Wall. Mark Chainsaw.
00:01:08.094 - 00:01:09.074, Speaker B: Jennica.

00:01:18.118 - 00:01:36.194, Speaker A: Lawrence. What a beautiful experience. Oh, look, there you are. All right, that was a fun experience. Like the music, the lights. Looking for your next startup idea in crypto?
00:01:36.314 - 00:01:37.946, Speaker B: Check out our request for startups list.
00:01:37.970 - 00:01:41.934, Speaker A: And get inspired at Alliance XYZ ideas.
00:01:42.754 - 00:02:24.934, Speaker C: Introducing minimum viable product by Alliance. MVP is an IRL hackathon at the alliance headquarters in so go from idea to MVP in two weeks. Step one, register. Apply solo or with a co founder with a clear product in mind to bring to MVP. Feel free to build anything on any chain. Step two, compete. 20 teams will be accepted where they'll receive hands on guidance from the alliance team and other industry leaders.
00:02:24.934 - 00:02:40.174, Speaker C: Step three, win. Pitch our judges and the team who comes out on top will win an immediate entry into the next alliance cohort and take home the title of MVP. Sign up today and prove that you're the real MVP.
00:02:41.714 - 00:03:01.298, Speaker A: So we just announced MVP by Alliance, which also stands for minimal viable product. And the reason why I think this new product that we're launching is quite interesting compared to typical hackathons is that a lot of the hackathons that I've joined are, you know, just people that are excited about trying new things and.
00:03:01.346 - 00:03:02.802, Speaker B: Make a little bit of money and.
00:03:02.818 - 00:03:43.848, Speaker A: Make money right from bounties and things like that. Maybe some status, prestige for winning the hackathon. But it's very rare that you see companies that come out of there. And I do think this process is a bit broken. Meaning like, I think a hackathon should always exist. I think they're an incredible place for developers to come in and try out new things. But what if there was a hackathon that kind of pushed the edge or pushed the developers to build something that could change the world? And that's kind of the concept of minimal viable product or MVP by alliance, which is a more of a hackathon that's geared towards people that want to become founders by founders for founders.
00:03:43.848 - 00:04:09.170, Speaker A: And our tagline is take an idea to MVP in two weeks. And the fun part about this, Chao, is that you and I get to work with the founders, hand in. Hand over a course of two weeks in real life to help shape the ideas and help founders, or, you know, would be founders, to come up with a product that can really enable new use cases in crypto. What's exciting about this for you?
00:04:09.242 - 00:04:21.810, Speaker B: I just love working with founders in person. It's just a really magical experience. As opposed to chatting on Telegram and then doing Zoom, the in person experience just cannot be replaced.
00:04:21.922 - 00:04:58.656, Speaker A: So the program starts May 20 till May 31, and you get to work with us. Within the alliance office, we are only picking 20 to 25 teams or individuals, and the goal is to get to product market fit within those two weeks. And so for those that are excited about this, feel free to hit up MVP Alliance XYZ, and, yeah, we'll see you there. Welcome to good game. Today we're going to be talking about if it's over or not, the market. I signed on to Twitter today, and it was death. I signed on to Twitter yesterday, it was death.
00:04:58.656 - 00:05:07.154, Speaker A: I signed onto Twitter a week ago was death. And the way the market makes it, at least what the timeline makes it seem like it's over. What do you think? Ciao.
00:05:07.234 - 00:05:12.338, Speaker B: I've never seen a cycle end with this much fud on the timeline. Have you seen any?
00:05:12.466 - 00:05:35.050, Speaker A: No, I actually haven't. So I'm just curious as to why the market, or at least Twitter, thinks that it's over. And I think it's maybe partly due to over indexing on the ETF inflows. Partly as soon as it turned zero, the market went to zero. You could just tell there was no excitement for crypto whatsoever.
00:05:35.202 - 00:05:45.874, Speaker B: Yeah, I thought the correction that we're seeing right now, I mean, on bitcoin right now, we corrected, what, 25%? And that's a very typical of the bull market correction, right?
00:05:45.954 - 00:05:50.730, Speaker A: Yeah, it just hit 57,000. I think you go to 50.
00:05:50.882 - 00:06:03.994, Speaker B: So what I think what happened was bitcoin just overshot. We went straight from, like, 30k all the way to 75. 73. Right. And it was just. Yeah, over. Overextended.
00:06:03.994 - 00:06:12.818, Speaker B: And so now we're just correcting. Clearly lost the momentum when the ETF inflow stopped, and now we're just. We're just correcting.
00:06:12.946 - 00:06:41.440, Speaker A: Well, there's a lot of talks about why it's over. You know, one is the, as I mentioned, ETF inflows. Two is no new narratives that are coming there that are emerging. Yet all the narratives that we've seen have already played out. So if you think about Solana becoming the retail chain, it has now kind of taken that narrative and it's fully formed now. Base. I don't see anything new coming out of base.
00:06:41.440 - 00:07:00.114, Speaker A: Ordinals. Ordinals played out, runes played out. Everyone thought that, including myself, thought runes was going to be a spectacular bang. And I think I know why some of those issues led to where it led to, and we can talk through that. But what else? Like, what else do we have going on?
00:07:00.154 - 00:07:19.314, Speaker B: Maybe all these things that quote unquote played out were a result of the bitcoin consolidating or correcting. If bitcoin stays at around seventy k and consolidating, then the. All these, all these narratives should be. Should be doing fine.
00:07:19.434 - 00:07:26.386, Speaker A: Okay, so I guess maybe, looking forward, how do we think the market is going to play out in your mind?
00:07:26.490 - 00:07:48.478, Speaker B: I have no idea. What do you think? My base case. My base case is we're going to consolidate for a couple months. Look, so far we've not seen a. We're not seeing a 30% correction yet. So even today, as 57, at 56, the correction from the top was like 25%. But typically in a bull market, we should see a 30%, even 40% correction.
00:07:48.478 - 00:07:57.214, Speaker B: So this is entirely normal. And so I would not be surprised that we just hang out between 50 and 70 for the upcoming months.
00:07:57.334 - 00:07:57.966, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:07:58.110 - 00:08:50.192, Speaker B: And I don't see any strong reason why the cycle is over. In the grand scheme of things, the cycle is always driven by liquidity, by global liquidity. So, for example, if you chart bitcoin with the stock market S and P 500, it's virtually the same chart. If you chart bitcoin, actually, if you chart bitcoin with the semiconductor ETF, which has been the leader of the stock market so far, it's basically the same chart. And all these different markets are actually both driven by the same underlying factor, which is the global liquidity. And as long as the economy is doing fine and the Fed is not hiking rates or doing a ton of quantitative tightening, the liquidity should expand from here. And as a result, all the risk markets, risk assets should do okay.
00:08:50.192 - 00:08:55.048, Speaker B: And I'm talking about a time horizon of a few months to maybe 1218 months.
00:08:55.176 - 00:08:56.768, Speaker A: We do have the upcoming election.
00:08:56.936 - 00:09:01.818, Speaker B: Yeah. So that's the other factor. The left will not let the market crash.
00:09:01.986 - 00:09:18.106, Speaker A: Exactly. So I do think we'll get a curveball here in the next couple months. I feel that this is typical after maybe being in the market for a while now, typically after tax day, markets either chop or go down till summer.
00:09:18.250 - 00:09:36.800, Speaker B: And then around summer, taxing is actually another good factor. Yeah. Because last year, we've been basically been up only, and people probably made a lot of money, and they needed to take some money off the table to pay taxes, which is why, in hindsight, the market actually topped around the tax day. That's a good point.
00:09:36.912 - 00:10:19.318, Speaker A: So I think between that and I don't know how much of the institutions really take summers off in crypto. I think between those two, the macro and the overextension, as you mentioned, I think all kind of played a part. All right, well, looking forward, there's some really interesting narratives that are coming around that I'm actually really excited about, one of which. Well, actually, let's talk about this. This is still pertaining to the markets, which is you sent a tweet out to a bunch of our courts that are building the RWA space around Blackrock's on chain fund, which hit 375 million. I'm curious why you shared it also, like, where do you see this going moving forward?
00:10:19.446 - 00:10:51.314, Speaker B: I mean, I shared it with them because essentially, I think there are two things that happened the last month in the whole RW and stablecoin sector. One is the Blackrock fund, $100 million. They started with $100 million, and now they grew very quickly to 375 within a month or so. This basically instantly legitimized the whole RWA space. Before it was not like people talk about RWA. Before it was not consensus, especially the crypto purists. Right.
00:10:51.314 - 00:11:16.472, Speaker B: The crypto natives that are very purists, they didn't think RWAs were very interesting because it was not intellectually satisfying for them to put traditional assets on chain. But BlackRock basically legitimized the whole space. But that's one thing that I thought was very interesting. The other thing that happened was stripe, that started adopting stablecoin payments.
00:11:16.648 - 00:11:22.696, Speaker A: That's a big deal. I think the last time they had this was in 2018. Did you watch your video?
00:11:22.880 - 00:11:23.680, Speaker B: The demo?
00:11:23.792 - 00:11:48.092, Speaker A: The demo. He said a couple interesting, like, a couple of things that I think could be interesting for our audience. He insinuated that they did try this in 2018. It didn't work because it's too expensive. And he kept calling out how cheap the gas fees were and how quick it took to conduct the transaction. So he called out two things, speed, cost, and the demo was done on Solana.
00:11:48.268 - 00:11:57.532, Speaker B: I thought that was the most interesting part. Like, they supported ethereum, Polygon, Polygon, and Solana. And out of the three, he chose Solana to do the demo on.
00:11:57.628 - 00:12:10.880, Speaker A: And so we're starting to see what I call kind of lightning, the bottom moments where I do think this is going to become more common moving forward. And this is driven by what people want ultimately, which is speed and cost reduction.
00:12:10.952 - 00:12:18.712, Speaker B: So they knew in 2018 that this thing was going to work at some point, but the tech was just not ready. But today they feel the tech is ready.
00:12:18.848 - 00:12:31.556, Speaker A: The tech, the narrative, even, especially after, you know, if you look at what Solana has gone through over a period of, you know, congestion over a period of time, all the congestions and things like that, they remain resilient after that.
00:12:31.640 - 00:13:21.048, Speaker B: In hindsight, the fact that stripe adopted stablecoin is not surprising to me at all, because we see a ton of people in emerging markets in Africa and Latin America use tron USDT for day to day payments, for cross border payment, and for hedging as well. To me, the natural next step was for a quote, unquote big startup like stripe to adopt this technology. It's really good for the space because people have questioned what is the first non speculative use case of crypto. People have questioned this for 15 years, and now we have one which is using USDC and USDT for payment. That's great. I think the stripe one not only legitimized stablecoin specifically, but also the whole space, the non speculative, quote, unquote real world use case of crypto. It was a big deal.
00:13:21.176 - 00:13:40.016, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know what the market's crying about. I mean, you have Blackrock, one of the largest asset managers in the world, that is doubling down on, on chain rwas with this tokenized fund. The other news is that they're hosting, like, bitcoin investor events for.
00:13:40.080 - 00:14:05.218, Speaker B: But you know, here's what's interesting about the public discord discourse around crypto, which is people don't care about the non speculative stuff. Like, the speculative stuff is what leads to the, to the, to the discourse, to the conversations, the debates and the arguments. Like, people are naturally driven by highly volatile assets and markets. And whenever you like, a stable coin is not interesting to talk about because the price doesn't move.
00:14:05.346 - 00:14:07.254, Speaker A: Well, there's no token attached to it.
00:14:07.634 - 00:14:27.612, Speaker B: There's a token, but it doesn't move right. And it's the same thing. It's a real use case. But you earn 5% per year from UST bills. No one talks about it. It doesn't mean it's not important. There's billions of dollars in t bills on chain today, and there's trillions of dollars being transferred on chain on stable coins.
00:14:27.612 - 00:14:30.700, Speaker B: But people don't talk about that stuff because it's not volatile.
00:14:30.812 - 00:15:05.590, Speaker A: I do think RWAs and all the stuff that we're seeing with blackrock, you know, eventually people like one, I think it's just gonna grow tremendously. Like, there isn't enough intention to this because people don't realize how big this opportunity is. Everyone's thinking about ETF inflows. I think that's also a big deal. I'm not getting, don't get me wrong, but tokenizing treasuries, tokenizing securities, tokenizing real estate is actually a very big deal. And once we all realize how big the global demand for it is, we're going to start to see that shoot up like a hockey stick. And I think people will get more bullish.
00:15:05.702 - 00:15:09.542, Speaker B: I should drew an analogy between bitcoin ETF and RWAs.
00:15:09.638 - 00:15:11.510, Speaker A: Oh, you did? Ok, go ahead.
00:15:11.702 - 00:15:38.360, Speaker B: Both are actually, uh, used for the main value proposition of both the ETF and RWAs is diversification. The difference is, the bitcoin ETF is used for diversification by tradvi, whereas RWAs are used for diversification by on chain capital. So basically, the bitcoin ETF is to tradfi what RWAs is to on chain capital. It's the exact same purpose, just for different user segments.
00:15:38.512 - 00:16:01.878, Speaker A: So. All right, let's, let's play some numbers here. I remember before DeFi summer, we were sitting maybe around 250 million, maybe 500 million. I don't remember, quite frankly, but let's say 500 million total. TvL DeFi summer happened, yield farming happened, and we, like, went over billions within, like, six months. Could you say that we're almost where we are with Defi Summer? With our.
00:16:01.966 - 00:16:39.258, Speaker B: I was actually thinking about this earlier today. I feel like that is exactly where we are, because the whole meme coin thing actually reminds me of Defi summer. So, like, right now, I feel like we're reaching the end of the Defi summer, and the speculative bubble sort of collapsed a little bit, and then bitcoin went down about. I think bitcoin at that time went down from 14,000 to 12,000. So it was a small correction. And today, bitcoin also experienced a small correction. In my mind, it's pretty small, like from 73 to 56, that's a pretty small correction.
00:16:39.258 - 00:17:04.614, Speaker B: Same order of magnitude as the one that happened during, at the end of Defi summer. There's a lot of similarities. So I kind of agree with you. And also, in terms of timeline, it's like, if you think of, like, I don't necessarily buy the four year cycle anymore, but if you still believe in the four year cycle, then we're around the same timeline as well, right? Like we're year three, year two, year three. Into the bull market or into the market.
00:17:04.734 - 00:17:05.310, Speaker A: Right? I mean.
00:17:05.342 - 00:17:06.030, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:17:06.222 - 00:17:20.622, Speaker A: All right, so let's talk about this. It's. To me, it's consensus now that. And look, you know, I don't know. Everyone is telling, everyone on Twitter is saying we're halfway through the market. Everyone is saying that. Like, it's consensus to the point where it's annoying.
00:17:20.622 - 00:17:38.214, Speaker A: It's annoying me. It wasn't like this last cycle. No one knew what. What the fuck was going on last cycle, if you ask me. And the cycle before that, I mean, it was just pure euphoria. Do you, like, obviously you don't subscribe to thesis that, you know, like, every cycle could become a different cycle moving forward?
00:17:38.334 - 00:17:39.886, Speaker B: No, I subscribe to that thesis.
00:17:39.910 - 00:17:47.070, Speaker A: Oh, you do subscribe to that? So you think that is, historically, we'll still be in a four year, like every four years?
00:17:47.182 - 00:17:49.606, Speaker B: No, I think the four year thing is a coincidence.
00:17:49.750 - 00:17:54.626, Speaker A: It's a co. Okay, yeah, but is that going to be a coincidence moving forward, is the question.
00:17:54.750 - 00:18:05.594, Speaker B: Well, again, the current cycle could very well end at the four year mark, but if it does, it's a coincidence from this point on. Again, like I mentioned before, it's driven by global liquidity.
00:18:05.634 - 00:18:06.930, Speaker A: Global liquidity, yeah.
00:18:07.082 - 00:18:12.442, Speaker B: And it just so happens that global liquidity cycles last around four years, like every time.
00:18:12.578 - 00:18:13.202, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:18:13.338 - 00:18:19.946, Speaker B: So I don't buy the four year cycles and I don't buy the. What is it called, the left translated cycle, the shorter cycle.
00:18:20.090 - 00:18:32.782, Speaker A: Well, okay, let me. Let me add more context. Okay. So crypto is becoming mainstream. Is becoming mainstream. Right. Is it fair to say that crypto could become less volatile than previous cycles?
00:18:32.918 - 00:18:39.606, Speaker B: Of course. With more liquidity, more institutional adoption? Sure. On average, the volatility trends down.
00:18:39.750 - 00:18:46.726, Speaker A: Okay, so I guess with volume trending down, will the cycles be as dramatic as they were before?
00:18:46.790 - 00:18:48.768, Speaker B: Is the question less dramatic?
00:18:48.896 - 00:18:49.496, Speaker A: Okay.
00:18:49.600 - 00:18:57.096, Speaker B: I mean, possibly four year. But if it ends up with. If it ends at the four year mark, then again, it's probably a coincidence.
00:18:57.280 - 00:19:06.928, Speaker A: All right, what assets are you most excited about in crypto? Yeah. Like, yeah, let's say that we trend down for a bit.
00:19:07.056 - 00:19:12.216, Speaker B: Yeah. What would you buy? What would you buy at the bottom? If you're able to pick the bottom.
00:19:12.320 - 00:19:21.144, Speaker A: What would you buy? Look, ETh has been historically, like, over the past six months, Eth has been. Has burned me every time.
00:19:21.444 - 00:19:23.864, Speaker B: There were so many funny tweets about ETh.
00:19:25.204 - 00:19:29.004, Speaker A: Oh, my God. Like, I read so many funny tweets about it.
00:19:29.124 - 00:19:37.064, Speaker B: There's so much fun. Let me read it out. I love ethereum so much. I made it, too in the toilet this morning.
00:19:43.384 - 00:19:44.712, Speaker A: Oh, my God.
00:19:44.848 - 00:20:16.508, Speaker B: But anyway, I'm not here to fudge, but I mean, like, yeah, I do think so. The Eth ETF will be very important. In fact, the ETH ETF is probably the biggest catalyst I can think of. I know a lot of people are saying, like, Eigen layer. We're going to talk about Eigen layer as well, but a lot of people are saying Eigen layer is was the biggest catalyst or 48 44 was the biggest catalyst. Obviously, I love the technology, I love the innovation. But when it comes to price impact, the ETH ETF is probably the biggest catalyst for ETH.
00:20:16.508 - 00:20:23.668, Speaker B: And I think if the ETF does not get approved, I think ETH will continue to underperform BTC in Seoul.
00:20:23.796 - 00:20:26.444, Speaker A: Oh, wait, you're saying ETH is going to outperform?
00:20:26.604 - 00:21:00.282, Speaker B: No, no. If ETh gets the ETF, it could outperform BTC and. And solve. But if it doesn't get the ETF, it will probably underperform. Because the problem with ETH is, and someone pointed this out, it's over owned by crypto natives. That's why it's so hard to go up, because there's no net marginal buyers. The only thing that people can do among the crypto natives is to diversify from ETH to Sol and not the other way around because ETH is over owned and Sol is under owned.
00:21:00.282 - 00:21:19.534, Speaker B: At the same time, BTC actually gets marginal inflow from the ETF. So that's the fundamental problem about ETH. It's over owned by crypto natives and doesn't have marginal inflow from tradfi. So, yeah, we'll see. But I still think my base case is still that this is BTC and Solana cycle.
00:21:19.654 - 00:21:25.390, Speaker A: Okay, so is the barbell approach because this is also becoming very common on.
00:21:25.422 - 00:21:30.016, Speaker B: Twitter, but it's not a BTC solid is a short barbell. Barbell?
00:21:30.120 - 00:21:30.804, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:21:31.424 - 00:21:49.992, Speaker B: The long barbell is BTC and width BTC. Well, I'm actually really surprised with didn't go down as much as much as BTC did in the last couple of weeks. Wifi is actually holding up a lot better than BTC. That's really impressive. Not financial advice.
00:21:50.128 - 00:21:51.216, Speaker A: Not financial advice.
00:21:51.320 - 00:21:53.384, Speaker B: Don't yell over time. Dong Yolo.
00:21:54.044 - 00:22:08.532, Speaker A: I mean, there's some really good narratives that are picking up for some of these meme coins. Maybe we can transition to memes. Although I do feel like memes have been overplayed. I kind of put a tweet out that said, I'm done with shitcoins.
00:22:08.708 - 00:22:09.732, Speaker B: I'm done too.
00:22:09.868 - 00:22:15.116, Speaker A: I don't think I'm done with. It's fun to talk about, but need a little bit of a break.
00:22:15.220 - 00:22:37.480, Speaker B: I feel like there was a chart of the number of meme coins that are created on pump. Let me find it. Okay, so pump kind of launched or pump took off in mid March. So now it's been about a month and a half. Do you have a guess for how much. How many tokens have been deployed on pump? What's your best estimate in the last one and a half month?
00:22:37.632 - 00:22:42.192, Speaker A: Okay, so about 6000 tokens per month on average.
00:22:42.328 - 00:22:45.424, Speaker B: Per month. You are off by two orders of magnitude.
00:22:45.544 - 00:22:46.632, Speaker A: Wait, what? How many?
00:22:46.768 - 00:22:49.804, Speaker B: Close to.
00:22:52.824 - 00:22:53.800, Speaker A: Are you serious?
00:22:53.912 - 00:22:56.408, Speaker B: Yeah, it's on dune analytics.
00:22:56.576 - 00:22:57.324, Speaker A: Wow.
00:22:58.464 - 00:22:59.568, Speaker B: Okay, so 400,000.
00:22:59.616 - 00:23:02.484, Speaker A: I got the numbers from somebody from.
00:23:03.384 - 00:23:07.128, Speaker B: Okay, so close to 10,000 tokens launched per day.
00:23:07.256 - 00:23:14.220, Speaker A: Oh, shit. Okay. I was expecting. Maybe I'm definitely off.
00:23:14.252 - 00:23:17.428, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe the data is wrong. I don't know. But it's on Dune.
00:23:17.556 - 00:23:22.508, Speaker A: And no, that's insane if that's true.
00:23:22.676 - 00:23:43.376, Speaker B: But my point being back to our earlier point, there's so many tokens that are being deployed on chain and the attention is fragmented across 400,000 coins or 10,000 coins per day that's being generated. And so it's very hard for these coins to go up when there's so much competition for attention.
00:23:43.520 - 00:23:47.644, Speaker A: I mean, like, look, I got burned by many coins. I can tell you from experience.
00:23:47.984 - 00:23:56.728, Speaker B: Oh, we should talk about the. Okay, the most interesting thing that happened in the meme coin space is the whistleblower.
00:23:56.856 - 00:24:33.434, Speaker A: All right, let's talk about it. So there was a, you may have seen this tweet thread where there's a pedo, and he was doing weird things and it was shot on, like, I think it was a news channel. And in the background he was there doing something weird. And everyone was trying to figure out, including the authorities, were trying to figure out who this person was and how do we find them. And this crypto degen, which, who we think are the pioneers of the space, ended up doing some research, found out who it was. His name was like, Stevano Stefano Vici or something.
00:24:33.554 - 00:24:35.730, Speaker B: You see a. No. Is that his pseudonym?
00:24:35.842 - 00:25:07.484, Speaker A: No, no, no. This is the. The pedo's name. Oh, the djen's name was something with starting with love, Lu or Luv, and he put a tweet out and he said something. Something to this nature, which is, I did some research, found out who this person was, and I don't have a very strong following. I only have, like, a thousand followers. And so I figured the best way to get attention around this is by launching a token with his name on it to dox the person.
00:25:07.484 - 00:25:27.768, Speaker A: And if this goes viral, then I've contributed to helping the authorities find this individual. And it did, in fact, go viral. And it got to a point where the person that initially called out this person a couple weeks ago, someone that's not in crypto, he tagged the crypto dj and thanking him about calling this person out.
00:25:27.856 - 00:25:29.480, Speaker B: Do you know what market cap he went to?
00:25:29.592 - 00:25:31.712, Speaker A: I followed it. I think went up to a million.
00:25:31.888 - 00:25:32.504, Speaker B: Oh, my God.
00:25:32.544 - 00:25:41.164, Speaker A: I think it died after that. So this is obviously not buying advice or financial advice, but the ticker's tv pedo. Yeah, it's a.
00:25:41.464 - 00:26:03.608, Speaker B: So, basically, he used a meme coin to get this thing to whistleblow. This. This. Yeah, this guy, and. And to help spread the message and get the attention, because for him, creating the meme coin actually helped the thing go viral more than tweeting out from his own account, because he doesn't have that many followers.
00:26:03.736 - 00:26:04.408, Speaker A: That's right.
00:26:04.496 - 00:26:19.464, Speaker B: And that. That was the most interesting thing I've seen in the last two weeks in the meme coin space. Like, I don't understand why people dismiss meme coins so early. Like, I'm not saying it's necessarily good or bad for me. It's just. It's not moral or immoral. It's just amoral.
00:26:19.464 - 00:26:30.210, Speaker B: But every time you see a new thing that becomes so controversial right off the bat in crypto, it's dangerous, very dangerous, to dismiss it too quickly.
00:26:30.362 - 00:26:40.410, Speaker A: I mean, if you think about it, this cycle has happened many times. When bitcoin first came out and everyone was meming that it's going to be the next gold, everyone dismissed it, right?
00:26:40.522 - 00:26:41.034, Speaker B: No.
00:26:41.154 - 00:26:45.338, Speaker A: Same thing with Ethereum, same thing with, you know, Defi.
00:26:45.426 - 00:26:47.056, Speaker B: Same thing with nfps.
00:26:47.210 - 00:26:49.700, Speaker A: Same thing with nfTs. Same thing with Cardano.
00:26:49.852 - 00:26:51.580, Speaker B: Well, Cardano is kind of a bad example.
00:26:51.652 - 00:26:56.384, Speaker A: It's a joke. I wanted to see if you caught it.
00:26:59.684 - 00:27:00.868, Speaker B: But with my.
00:27:00.996 - 00:27:03.836, Speaker A: There are some legitimate people that believe Cardano is still the future.
00:27:03.940 - 00:27:19.784, Speaker B: That's true. Yeah. Actually, I was talking to a friend of mine who's a crypto native, very smart, and he has Normie friends, also very smart, well educated, who thinks Cardano is the real deal. So Cardano actually has a lot of real believers.
00:27:19.904 - 00:27:26.560, Speaker A: Believe me, I know. I talk to retail all the time, and I think it has to do with Charles being the ex co founder of Ethereum.
00:27:26.712 - 00:27:31.568, Speaker B: Yeah. Charles is the reason why Cardano is at $10 billion FDB.
00:27:31.656 - 00:27:31.952, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:27:32.008 - 00:27:33.080, Speaker B: He's the cult leader.
00:27:33.232 - 00:27:33.872, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:27:34.008 - 00:27:56.490, Speaker B: Which, going back to the meme con, all these new things that we met, like bitcoin, Ethereum, defi. NfTs. People dismissed them right off the bat. And meme coins get dismissed because they're silly. But there's always these new immersion behaviors that come out of these new experiments. Like this whistleblower guy using meme coins to spread the message. That is fascinating.
00:27:56.490 - 00:28:01.882, Speaker B: And I think we might see even more interesting behaviors coming out of the meme coin space.
00:28:02.018 - 00:28:20.822, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think this should be launched by then. But another team that we're working with is called crate. And, you know, the way, like, okay, let's talk about music. Crypto music, as an example. Generally, crypto music, I always felt like it was skeuomorphic, you know, like, we're so used.
00:28:20.878 - 00:28:22.982, Speaker B: NFTs were skeuomorphic.
00:28:23.118 - 00:28:25.878, Speaker A: Yeah. Oh, and that. These are skeuomorphic. In what?
00:28:26.006 - 00:28:28.062, Speaker B: Like, the music. NFts were script.
00:28:28.118 - 00:28:28.398, Speaker A: Yes.
00:28:28.446 - 00:28:30.966, Speaker B: Like the one song equals one NFT.
00:28:31.150 - 00:28:41.566, Speaker A: That MP3 file. Right. Or an itunes file. Yeah, it reminded me a lot of that. Right. Or catalog, which is, you know, on chain streaming. Right.
00:28:41.566 - 00:29:27.130, Speaker A: You have vault where you buy digital copies with USDC of the album in itself, these are all, like, behaviors that we're already accustomed to in the real world. But the real question is, what can crypto enable that hasn't enabled music today? That is, like, the way you'd want to think about it. The way I've thought about it was as follows. Well, for musicians, they had to compete to get on the right algorithm to get the right network effects. With the distribution that Spotify and YouTube has, you need to have the right influencers, you need to have the right people that are talking about it, and you have to work really hard to get there. But it's much easier than what it was previously. If you look in the web one world, you have to have mixtapes or tapes.
00:29:27.130 - 00:29:39.526, Speaker A: You release the mixtapes, you start to build local buzz. Maybe then the radio station locally takes your song, then maybe other radio stations take your song, and that's kind of the way things used to go viral before.
00:29:39.630 - 00:29:40.558, Speaker B: You're that old.
00:29:40.686 - 00:30:00.172, Speaker A: I'm a boomer, yo. But, yeah, that's how things went viral back in the day. Now it's streaming network. So an example of this is Justin Bieber. How did he get recruited? He was recording live on YouTube, right. And Usher saw it, picked it up and introduced him to P. Diddy.
00:30:00.268 - 00:30:03.140, Speaker B: Oh, is that how he started? Yeah, started as a YouTube influencer.
00:30:03.212 - 00:30:20.124, Speaker A: Yeah. So YouTube launched around 2004, 2005, something like that. Or maybe 2006. He was discovered 2008, I think it was 2006. So 2008, he got discovered two years later. And so the question then is. And the way he got discovered was because of reach, everyone liked the song and.
00:30:20.124 - 00:30:39.790, Speaker A: And that's became the new meta for the next two decades or decade and a half. Right. That became the decade, the meta. Like, you go on YouTube, you go on Soundcloud, you drop your stuff, you share it and hopefully it goes viral. You know, maybe the right algorithm, the right, you know, you just, you just hit it, right. But now it's becoming, I think, overpopulated. Right.
00:30:39.790 - 00:30:42.886, Speaker A: There's just everyone's just trying to become the next musician.
00:30:43.030 - 00:30:44.878, Speaker B: Yeah. And hack the Algo.
00:30:45.006 - 00:30:59.064, Speaker A: And hack the algo to get there. So the question is, how can crypto compete against the algorithm? How can crypto compete against the distribution or the network effects that YouTube and Spotify has? I think we have an answer to it now.
00:30:59.604 - 00:31:02.700, Speaker B: Through the free market. Through the free market meme coins.
00:31:02.852 - 00:31:05.732, Speaker A: Exactly. It's probably very contrarian still today.
00:31:05.868 - 00:31:19.952, Speaker B: Oh, that. No, it's. It makes a lot of sense to me. Like, like this is the same story as the pedo whistleblower. Like, you use coins to spread the message, to go viral, to help something, to go viral.
00:31:20.088 - 00:31:32.424, Speaker A: That's right. So what I think is going to happen is every medium is going to be tokenized and it's going to create a completely new experience for both sides of the marketplace.
00:31:32.584 - 00:31:33.160, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:31:33.272 - 00:32:01.956, Speaker A: Those that want to deliver value to customers and customers that want to receive value in return, but it's going to be done in a very different way. So here's like an example. Today we are being mined for data. So because we're being mined for data, we get free products, right. Number two is we also pay, you know, if we want additional services or whatever. There's also a SaaS model, right. That typically comes with these products that we receive.
00:32:01.956 - 00:32:34.630, Speaker A: And the question is like, okay, how do you compete with that via crypto? Well, you can't compete with free. It's just, you just can't. But we could give them the opportunity to make upside and that will compete with any business model that's out there moving forward. So in return, I think what's going to happen is instead of people being mined for data or subscribing for services, everyone's just going to become capitalist. And maybe this is too polarizing, and maybe there's somewhere it's happy medium somewhere. I'm not saying this is all going to be like that.
00:32:34.702 - 00:32:47.838, Speaker B: It's going to be very polarizing, but I can see it work. And people will not be happy, at least in the first few years. Like, people were not happy with Facebook, people were not happy with Tinder. But now these things become widespread.
00:32:47.966 - 00:32:48.438, Speaker A: Yep.
00:32:48.526 - 00:32:52.914, Speaker B: Mainstream consensus. So people just live with it. People accept it.
00:32:56.454 - 00:33:05.334, Speaker A: Welcome to founder stories. Today we have Joey on from Crate. Joey, can you talk a bit about who you are and what you're building?
00:33:05.454 - 00:33:20.406, Speaker D: Yeah, I'm Joey building crate, which is the song crowd funding platform, a place where artists can launch their songs on chain with a token as a means to bootstrap funding, and their community can show their patronage with a token that shows they were there first.
00:33:20.550 - 00:33:27.750, Speaker A: Nice. How does Crate's tokenization of music differ from previous NFT music narratives that fell flat?
00:33:27.902 - 00:33:58.856, Speaker D: I think music nfts were on the right track. They had the right idea. I think they didn't work because they have no liquidity and no secondary market. So, you know, you buy an NFT for 1000, $2,000 and you know you're never going to sell it. So I think that just inaccessible to most people, I think they were trying too hard to be skew morphic to physical collectibles when we need something new. So I read a Santiago tweet, like right before this. It says tokens are more accessible and fun versions of nfts.
00:33:58.856 - 00:34:08.754, Speaker D: And I think it's exceptionally true for music. There's no sticker shock, no unit bias, and most importantly, you can buy and sell instantly, like locking in your gains or losses.
00:34:08.874 - 00:34:12.834, Speaker A: What does Crate offer artists and fans that current streaming services don't?
00:34:12.914 - 00:34:54.424, Speaker D: Current streaming platforms are like gatekeepers between fans and artists. They control the economics. You pay your $15 a month, and most of that money goes to Taylor Swift and Drake, regardless of if you actually listen to them or not, because they pay out in their pie charges. So that means if there's like a new upcoming artist and you're their biggest fan and you listen to them every single day, they could be not even getting one cent a month out of the $15 you pay, even if they're the only artists you listen to. So obviously it's completely broken. So with Crate, we're bringing the relationship between fan artists closer than before. You can directly choose how much money you want to put, whether you want to listen to for free, and just not spend any money.
00:34:54.424 - 00:35:01.956, Speaker D: You can do that, or you can put thousands of dollars into your favorite artist songs. There's basically no middleman controlling that relationship.
00:35:02.060 - 00:35:03.732, Speaker A: Great joy, thank you so much for your time.
00:35:03.828 - 00:35:04.664, Speaker D: Of course.
00:35:08.284 - 00:35:13.652, Speaker A: Why can't anyone else become the next Justin Bieber or Usher is the question, right?
00:35:13.748 - 00:35:14.068, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:35:14.116 - 00:35:18.884, Speaker A: Like, you and I, we hear good music all the time. Why can't we just buy a token and support them?
00:35:19.004 - 00:35:25.752, Speaker B: Yeah. And it's okay if I. If I lose a little bit. Like, if I put in, like, $10 or something. I don't care if a dollar, like.
00:35:25.768 - 00:35:36.136, Speaker A: Put a dollar in. Like, you don't even need to put. So, like, here's the other thing, right? I think, look, as much as we're advocating for meme coins, et cetera, people could lose money here, right? So that.
00:35:36.200 - 00:35:41.880, Speaker B: I also think that the terminology, the meme coin is we should change it.
00:35:42.032 - 00:35:42.792, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:35:42.968 - 00:35:53.784, Speaker B: The terminology is what leads people to look down on it. Like, it has a silly connotation, a negative connotation with it. I think we should call it intersubjective token or something.
00:35:57.164 - 00:35:59.424, Speaker A: What the fuck was that all about?
00:36:01.484 - 00:36:04.796, Speaker B: I study. Study. Yuval Harari.
00:36:04.940 - 00:36:06.664, Speaker A: Ah, yuval Haru. Yeah.
00:36:07.524 - 00:36:12.700, Speaker B: I actually learned that word from sapiens. Yeah. Did you read the book?
00:36:12.812 - 00:36:21.738, Speaker A: I read half of it. I didn't read the whole thing, but I read enough to. To get an understanding of what he was talking about.
00:36:21.786 - 00:36:36.546, Speaker B: The inter subjectivity part was actually the most important I got out of that book. And what the word means is basically memes. Right. It's a shared story. It's a story that a group of people can resonate with.
00:36:36.650 - 00:36:36.930, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:36:36.962 - 00:36:45.794, Speaker B: So it could be a religion, it could be a funny Internet meme. It could be a song. Right? All these things are quote unquote, inner subjective.
00:36:45.914 - 00:36:51.490, Speaker A: Humans love storytelling. People love to be told stories. People, you know, not only that, people.
00:36:51.562 - 00:36:55.978, Speaker B: Love connecting with each other over a story. That's the most important thing.
00:36:56.066 - 00:36:56.306, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:36:56.330 - 00:37:10.536, Speaker B: So people love connecting with each other over a funny dog with a hat on the Internet, and people love connecting with each other over a religion or over nationality, ethnicity, or over a song. Right? That's the case of music, meme coins.
00:37:10.650 - 00:37:36.790, Speaker A: So I guess going back to, like, shitcoins, meme coins, whatever you want to call it, attention tokens. Intercept, intercept, interceptive tokens. IsT ist is that each token will create a narrative that can connect people together and the reward is the financial upside. Yeah, I mean, I think that's pretty simple, right?
00:37:36.932 - 00:37:51.578, Speaker B: I think it could work. I really think it could work. Like basically pump fun but more specialized. Yeah, like specialized version of pump fun across different verticals, like music videos, videos, forecaster channels, subreddits.
00:37:51.746 - 00:37:59.986, Speaker A: I can see, by the way, all the verticals that Chow is mentioning, we have founders already building that space that are part of our next batch.
00:38:00.130 - 00:38:05.916, Speaker B: I'm very excited. I don't know if all of them will work, but I'm very excited to see the experiment play out.
00:38:05.940 - 00:38:22.692, Speaker A: Yeah. It's almost as if, you know, I don't know, maybe I just feel like sometimes we're in the future. I don't know if this thing really was to take off. I mean, the entire world could be reimagined, look very differently.
00:38:22.828 - 00:38:25.796, Speaker B: Yeah. And it's going to be very polarizing in the beginning.
00:38:25.820 - 00:38:51.270, Speaker A: It'll be very polarizing. You know, I was listening to this. Okay, so this is, I'm pretty old now, right. But when Xerox, before it first came out, this was 2016. 2017. And what really got him into crypto, like deeper into crypto and like token was division Zero X had back then. And back then, if you know, Xerox, it's a matcha.
00:38:51.270 - 00:39:13.166, Speaker A: Matcha is an aggregator. Xerox is a liquidity protocol that bridges between different amms, and it's supposed to unify the liquidity experience so that matcha and other users can tap into it and create rich experiences for their end users. He said something to the order of, I believe. And this was when Shaquanian wasn't even a thing. He said, I believe there's going to be, everything is going to be tokenized.
00:39:13.350 - 00:39:17.462, Speaker B: The whole world. I remember this. Who said that? Was it will? A will. Okay.
00:39:17.558 - 00:39:22.638, Speaker A: He said, everything is going to be tokenized. There's going to be an amm for every vertical that's out there.
00:39:22.806 - 00:39:34.022, Speaker B: I remember Olaf. I remember Olaf said the same thing in 2017, and I didn't buy it. I didn't buy the story. But in hindsight, he was right. Everything's gonna be tokenized.
00:39:34.118 - 00:39:36.238, Speaker A: Everything's gonna be tokenized like tradfi assets.
00:39:36.286 - 00:39:37.726, Speaker B: In the form of RWAS.
00:39:37.830 - 00:39:38.230, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:39:38.302 - 00:39:43.234, Speaker B: Music videos, subreddits, forecaster channels. Everything will be tokenized.
00:39:43.734 - 00:39:59.150, Speaker A: So kudos to Olaf and will from Xerox that called it up. And so, like, if that vision was realized today with, you know, like the liquidity layer, with all the amms and all of the liquidity being bridged to Xerox, protocol, I think could be very successful. Right?
00:39:59.182 - 00:39:59.366, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:39:59.390 - 00:40:02.994, Speaker A: Like I think that is going to become a big problem today. But now we have Solana.
00:40:05.574 - 00:40:09.958, Speaker B: By the way, Solana congestion is, has gone away.
00:40:10.126 - 00:40:10.478, Speaker A: Yes.
00:40:10.526 - 00:40:11.230, Speaker B: You see that.
00:40:11.342 - 00:40:15.514, Speaker A: I did see that. The update happened and all the copers left.
00:40:17.494 - 00:40:37.192, Speaker B: It seems to me I ruined this. I didn't pull this from, from myself, but I learned this from a few people who are knowledgeable. The patch probably helped, but it was mainly because the ore mining thing stopped, you know, you know, the quote unquote proof of work. DDos attack.
00:40:37.328 - 00:40:38.080, Speaker A: Yes.
00:40:38.232 - 00:40:44.128, Speaker B: So the moment that thing went away, Solana was, was the congestion was, was done.
00:40:44.256 - 00:40:49.022, Speaker A: Yeah, I saw that. And fire dancer is supposed to come out too soon, right?
00:40:49.168 - 00:40:53.570, Speaker B: I saw. Well, I just saw a tweet. Yeah. Yeah.
00:40:53.602 - 00:41:00.082, Speaker A: What was the original final integration of the Solana jump? Fire dancer client is well underway.
00:41:00.218 - 00:41:05.690, Speaker B: Yeah, but that's pre testnet. So I think the next step is testnet.
00:41:05.802 - 00:41:06.114, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:41:06.154 - 00:41:11.706, Speaker B: And then Mainnet. So probably still, what, six months out? Yeah, something like that.
00:41:11.810 - 00:41:31.652, Speaker A: But I'm really excited about it. Between that, between all the L2s that are coming out on Ethereum. Oh, maybe we could talk about Monad and Vera chain and Tom, because those are the three, I think, that people are talking about as the next big narrative. You've spent a lot of time within Monad, so maybe we can touch on Monad.
00:41:31.788 - 00:41:46.604, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know if it'll work. I mean, the tech, I think the tech will work. Technology is super interesting. I think the core problem it solves is that the EVM sucks. So they rewrite the EVM from scratch to make EVM faster, more scalable.
00:41:46.724 - 00:41:50.716, Speaker A: But it's EVM compatible. Right. So anyone can transfer. Yeah.
00:41:50.780 - 00:42:23.688, Speaker B: So, yeah, so if you have smart contracts on Ethereum, ideally, or at least theoretically, you should be able to deploy the same thing on Monad. The problem is, the biggest difference between Monad and some of the recent high throughput Ethereum L2 s is that with the L2, you can basically deploy or migrate your ETH directly to the L2, whereas Monad, you don't have native ETH on Monad. So that, that's the biggest challenge for Monad as a layer one because you don't have the liquidity. The ETH liquidity.
00:42:23.816 - 00:42:29.488, Speaker A: So by not having ETH liquidity. Yeah, I mean, like, that's. Oh, that has always been the problem though, right?
00:42:29.536 - 00:42:31.992, Speaker B: For that's, that has always been the problem.
00:42:32.128 - 00:42:34.992, Speaker A: But I mean, like, that could be solved easily by like, farming. Right.
00:42:35.128 - 00:42:43.904, Speaker B: Um, could it not but you're still not going to have like $500 billion worth of. How much is ETH worth now?
00:42:44.284 - 00:42:45.052, Speaker A: Let me check.
00:42:45.148 - 00:43:14.234, Speaker B: Yeah. $300 billion worth of ETH ready to go. If you launch Monad or any layer one, your native asset will be worth maybe at most like 20 billion, I would say, because solar right now is 50 billion, 55 billion. So you're just not going to have as much liquidity as you would as L2 on Ethereum, because on Ethereum you can have native ETh and there's 500, $300 billion worth. So that's the biggest challenge.
00:43:14.354 - 00:43:15.854, Speaker A: But I think it's kind of.
00:43:16.554 - 00:43:22.522, Speaker B: They need to solve this. They need to solve this problem. If they solve this problem, the local problem, then I think it'll probably work.
00:43:22.658 - 00:43:23.414, Speaker A: Huh.
00:43:23.754 - 00:43:27.682, Speaker B: But there's some newer L2s. Have you heard of mega Eth?
00:43:27.818 - 00:43:30.138, Speaker A: I have not. Oh, I saw it on Twitter. Sorry.
00:43:30.186 - 00:43:31.216, Speaker B: Yeah, I saw it on Twitter.
00:43:31.330 - 00:43:31.628, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:43:31.676 - 00:43:40.812, Speaker B: Um, and I was talking to the founders, one of the founders, and she, uh, she was, she was telling me that mega eth should be faster than Monad.
00:43:40.908 - 00:43:41.868, Speaker A: How is that possible?
00:43:42.036 - 00:43:45.264, Speaker B: I don't know what the underlying mechanism is, but, um.
00:43:46.604 - 00:43:47.556, Speaker A: As a layer, too.
00:43:47.580 - 00:43:48.144, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:43:48.804 - 00:43:54.004, Speaker A: Okay, so. So you don't know the, how the infrastructure or the info works, right?
00:43:54.124 - 00:43:55.204, Speaker B: I don't know how it works, yeah.
00:43:55.244 - 00:43:55.716, Speaker A: Okay.
00:43:55.820 - 00:43:57.824, Speaker B: She wasn't actually able to explain to me.
00:43:58.374 - 00:43:58.942, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:43:59.038 - 00:44:00.902, Speaker B: She's not the technical co founder.
00:44:00.998 - 00:44:01.794, Speaker A: Got it.
00:44:02.254 - 00:44:12.934, Speaker B: If what she says is true, Mona is going to face a lot of competition from the L2s, because launching a L2 is easier, is easier, and it gets more and more commoditized.
00:44:13.094 - 00:44:36.354, Speaker A: So here's another thought I have from a fee perspective. If the average transaction is $100 on Ethereum, layer one, layer one, main net, and now you have. What's the. Okay, so if, if, if their main is a transaction, let's say, or maybe even $50, because I will get a lot of DM's about this. So let's just say $50.
00:44:37.294 - 00:44:42.974, Speaker B: Well, right now the average is lower. Actually, the average is probably $1020.
00:44:43.094 - 00:44:43.834, Speaker A: Okay.
00:44:44.294 - 00:44:47.662, Speaker B: Today, on a day like today is probably a lot higher because the market is crashing.
00:44:47.758 - 00:44:53.978, Speaker A: Let's say $25. Okay. No, what would, in theory, the fee would be on L2.
00:44:54.106 - 00:44:57.538, Speaker B: Well, on base right now, it's like two cent.
00:44:57.586 - 00:44:57.850, Speaker A: Okay.
00:44:57.882 - 00:44:58.314, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:44:58.434 - 00:44:59.362, Speaker A: And Solana?
00:44:59.538 - 00:45:00.314, Speaker B: Same thing.
00:45:00.434 - 00:45:10.114, Speaker A: Okay. The way I see this is going from $10, $20 a transaction to $0.02 is a dramatic user behavior change, right?
00:45:10.194 - 00:45:10.810, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:45:10.962 - 00:45:18.494, Speaker A: Now, going from two cent to a fraction of a penny, I don't know if it makes a, that it doesn't make a dramatic impact as it does from $10 to.
00:45:19.664 - 00:45:31.960, Speaker B: You sound just like Eth Max right now, because I know a lot of EtH Maxis say the same thing, but I fundamentally disagree with that. I think every order of magnitude improvement in fees will enable you new use cases.
00:45:32.072 - 00:45:33.776, Speaker A: Okay, that I agree with.
00:45:33.840 - 00:45:37.680, Speaker B: So for you, as an individual user, you may not make too much difference.
00:45:37.832 - 00:45:39.856, Speaker A: So I agree with, let's say for.
00:45:39.880 - 00:45:42.640, Speaker B: Someone who can barely afford a smartphone.
00:45:42.792 - 00:45:50.090, Speaker A: I think, I don't know, I'll push back on that by saying, okay, I agree. Maybe there's some new use cases, right?
00:45:50.122 - 00:46:34.724, Speaker B: Like the biggest new use case, I think is two things. One is people living in developing countries, and two, the bots, and bots have a bad rap. But the fact of the matter is, like, without bots, order books, central limit order books won't work without bots. So algorithmic trading is one of the things that much lower fees can enable because you're going to do a lot of order book updates and AI is another one if you want to do inference or whatever on chain with AI also, by the way, is technically a bot, right? Much cheaper fees will enable those use cases. So whenever eth mask, you say eth is the AI money. I mean, like, it's bullshit. You cannot pay $100 per transaction.
00:46:34.724 - 00:46:44.308, Speaker B: Like, I think even Solana is not good enough today for AI. You have to bring the cost down by at least one or more orders of magnitude.
00:46:44.436 - 00:47:09.244, Speaker A: So what is the right fee structure? And the reason why I brought up this thesis or thought is I've given you some emergent behavior. What the tensor team went through, which is between CNFTs, the launch of CNFTs and the low fees within Solana, a lot of the emerging countries are actually buying CNFTs as an example. So Thailand.
00:47:11.224 - 00:47:12.376, Speaker B: Because it's cheaper.
00:47:12.520 - 00:47:47.566, Speaker A: It's much cheaper. So I subscribe to a thesis that I think two cent is good enough to onboard the masses versus Ethereum mainnet. You're also seeing this with solana or stripe, using solana as stablecoin transactions as an example. I think it's good enough to onboard the masses. I think what you're talking about is even a step further, which is, you know, AI algo trading and things that are much more advanced, which I also agree with. And so I would probably bucket this as two different use cases. Yeah.
00:47:47.566 - 00:48:17.638, Speaker A: So for I think the everyday person, like even my brother, who, you know, whoever, right? Like I think for them, like Solana is good enough. Base or blast or other L2s are good enough for them trade shit coins. But for advanced, advanced use cases, I 100% agree with what you're saying. So there is a world, I guess there is a world where every like Monad can exist and all these other places can, or other L2s can exist, right? Is what you're making argument for.
00:48:17.726 - 00:49:05.510, Speaker B: I want to share a book that I read recently, which I shared with you actually. Yeah, it's called the Chip war. That book has nothing to do with crypto. It's a book on semiconductors. And basically it's a history book on what happened in the last 70 years. So basically, since the second world war, up until today, and the key lesson that we learned over the last 70, 80 years was Moore's law and the profound impact of Moore's law. So basically every, let's say, call it ten years or so, we get an order of magnitude, one order of magnitude improvement and the speed of semiconductors given the same size and same cost, right? Another way to think about it is those chips get cheaper by an order of magnitude every year given the same speed and size.
00:49:05.510 - 00:49:43.434, Speaker B: And so what happened was during the second World War and the cold War, chips were first used for military, for weapons. As the chips got cheaper and cheaper one decade later, in the 1970s, people realized, oh, we can use chips for computers, to be used for commercial, for commercial use cases by companies, basically. And then the next decade, we realized, oh, chips now are cheap enough to produce personal computers. So that was the rise of Apple and Microsoft. That was 1980s and then 1990s. People realized, oh, we can now use chips for Internet. So that was the.com
00:49:43.434 - 00:50:20.996, Speaker B: bubble, right? And then the decade later, it was 2010s. People realized, oh, we can actually now produce smartphones because now the chips are as fast as it was a decade ago, but much smaller. So now we can produce equally performant but smaller devices. So that was smartphones, and the decade later it was AI, and that's now. So the compute is now powerful enough to run a very high throughput AI. And then the next decade it could be quantum computing. So as chips get more and more performant every year and every decade we enable new use cases.
00:50:20.996 - 00:50:47.400, Speaker B: So this was the most important lesson from that book. And I think the same thing will happen actually with crypto. So, remember going back to the stripe example in 2017, stripe knew that stablecoins were going to be big, but it was not fast and cheap enough to support it for mass adoption. But now it is. Now, imagine that with Solana or the L2s becoming cheaper and cheaper. In the next decade, there will be new use cases.
00:50:47.552 - 00:50:48.120, Speaker A: Yep.
00:50:48.232 - 00:50:58.088, Speaker B: And it's actually very hard for us to foresee to predict what those use cases will be in the next decade. But there will be new use cases. I'm very confident of that.
00:50:58.216 - 00:51:21.448, Speaker A: That makes me excited. As much as you're in the crypto bubble today and all you see is all people tweet about casinos and shitcoining and all of that. Being able to see new use cases, like AI and others, actually keeps me really excited about the future of crypto. I mean, look, I think meme coin trading, all this stuff is fun, but typically new things.
00:51:21.616 - 00:51:24.072, Speaker B: I love training meme coins, but all.
00:51:24.088 - 00:51:31.024, Speaker A: Of this is usually a precursor to what is really to come. Right. Things often look like toys before they actually become full fledged products.
00:51:31.184 - 00:51:33.400, Speaker B: Do you want to quickly touch on eigen layer?
00:51:33.512 - 00:51:49.374, Speaker A: I do. I also want to open up this pack, so I have to bridge base. I had to bridge blast. So. So let me do this while we talk. Okay. Oh, how much I love bridging.
00:51:49.374 - 00:51:56.578, Speaker A: Let's talk about. I mean, I really want to talk about tan.
00:51:56.746 - 00:51:57.586, Speaker B: Yep.
00:51:57.770 - 00:51:58.762, Speaker A: I think there's just.
00:51:58.818 - 00:52:00.362, Speaker B: So let's talk about tan.
00:52:00.498 - 00:52:17.202, Speaker A: There's just. There's so many exciting use cases, and I'll talk about a few that I'm most excited about. But. But you've been diving deeper into space. I know when we last chatted in our last pod, you talked about some of the fee. Like, one, onboarding is hard because us. They're not allowed to.
00:52:17.298 - 00:52:19.434, Speaker B: Us. Phones are geo fenced.
00:52:19.594 - 00:52:32.922, Speaker A: They're geofenced. Everyone else able to. The fees are a little bit expensive. I had a chance to play around with it. So let's talk about maybe. Let's dive deeper into the ton thesis. Some of the things that we're seeing.
00:52:32.922 - 00:52:41.496, Speaker A: They just made an announcement with tether. So I think there's two to $300 million now. Bridge to ton.
00:52:41.640 - 00:52:42.444, Speaker B: How much?
00:52:42.784 - 00:52:51.644, Speaker A: Two or 300 million USDT is bridged to ton now. So, yeah, let's maybe talk about that. I mean, you know, high level.
00:52:52.144 - 00:53:25.980, Speaker B: The high level thesis is exactly the same as Bayes and BSc. So, if you think about it, Bayes has Coinbase, BSc has binance, and ton has telegram. All these three are huge products, consumer facing products with huge distribution. And they're going to bring the users to the chain from the consumer facing front end to the chain. And we actually saw this a year ago with Baze when Baze was not consensus at all. And we said on this podcast that Bayes was going to be really, really big, and that's exactly what happened. And so I think the same thing is going to happen for ton.
00:53:25.980 - 00:53:57.972, Speaker B: But the problem is people, at least in the US and western Europe, is they're not talking about Tan because Tan's, I guess, home base is Eastern Europe or the countries that were part of the former Soviet Union. And I started talking to some of the founders that are building on Tan. There's a lot of asian founders, really good asian founders that are building on Tan as well. So that's what I'm seeing. Try the products. They're still very early. Uh, the products I tried are very janky.
00:53:57.972 - 00:54:00.836, Speaker B: That's opportunity for, for startups. What do you see?
00:54:00.900 - 00:54:40.126, Speaker A: So what I'm seeing is they're becoming more crypto native. Let me, uh. Okay, they're becoming more crypto native. So an example of this is the stickers are becoming tokenized. I don't know how big of a deal people think like this is, but I personally think it's such a, such a big deal because essentially they're NFTs, right? And being able to share and send NFT stickers is what makes crypto crypto. Like, I think the biggest problem with crypto is the fact that it's very expensive for nfts. They don't have distribution power and they're just stuck in your wallet, right? So like, you change it as your PFP and that's it.
00:54:40.126 - 00:54:51.384, Speaker A: And so let's put that to the side. You know, Elle, right, the anon on Twitter, he said something, which I 100% agree with, is that stickers are the new white papers.
00:54:51.494 - 00:54:52.504, Speaker B: What does that mean?
00:54:53.484 - 00:55:35.336, Speaker A: They're the new white papers for meme coins. So let's, let's play, let's play some fun things here, right? If you want to buy bowdoin, you buy bowdoin, right? You buy the bowdoin token and you tell your friends about it because that's what you want to do, right? Like you, I bought bowdoin. I think it's hilarious. Buy it. But what if you get a pack of stickers of Bowdoin and they're all nFTs and you just share it with your friends, right? Like you're extending the meme because stickers are so cheap and free to use, right. And because telegram has distribution, right. You could create frictionless ways of sharing memes to your friends and family.
00:55:35.480 - 00:55:40.872, Speaker B: But why, why is that better than just sending the stickers that don't have an NFT?
00:55:41.048 - 00:56:21.144, Speaker A: Whether there's NFTs or not, it doesn't matter. I'm just talking about stickers generally. Yeah, I think that could be a very powerful behavior now, being nfts. I think there's things that you could do that you cannot do with stickers, right? Such a, maybe you could introduce one claimable tokens, beardrop. So let's say you share stickers and you're like, hey, I'm sending you a sticker and you may receive an airdrop for a token. The way I think about it is that you could create, you could increase the unique users a token by sending this more freely to others. Like there's ways where you could really extend the unique user base.
00:56:21.144 - 00:56:33.416, Speaker A: You could extend the meme to other friends and family. And that should, in theory, create more buying power for memes that become more connected to the kind of sticker. Sticker user base. Do you buy that or no?
00:56:33.520 - 00:56:39.292, Speaker B: No, not really. Okay. I would have to see it. I would have to see it work and go viral in order to believe it.
00:56:39.348 - 00:56:46.004, Speaker A: On other news, did you see polymarket intern Hugo Bartingdale? His tweets?
00:56:46.124 - 00:56:47.144, Speaker B: What did he say?
00:56:48.764 - 00:57:08.520, Speaker A: I got to pull it up, but it's too funny. Okay, so polymarket, the Twitter handle and phantom the Twitter handle were egging each other on to say the word retardio. And so Phantom said, r e t a r d I. So they went through like a series of tweets where it spelled out which.
00:57:08.552 - 00:57:11.808, Speaker B: Phantom, the wallet or the chain, the wallet.
00:57:11.936 - 00:57:58.490, Speaker A: And then right after that, the poly market intern said that he was called into the HR's office. Her name was like, susan something. This is great. And apparently he got disciplined and he can't say the word retardio. And then they put out a, like a one page pr release that talked about how the word of retardio is bad and it's against the polymarkets ethos. But in that letter, they said the word like ritterio like four times and then that he had to. And so he went, he got disciplined and they apparently took his axes away from polymarket, the handle, whatever.
00:57:58.490 - 00:58:07.034, Speaker A: But I thought it was just really funny because polymarket in and itself is a very, it's not a DJ product, it's very serious.
00:58:07.154 - 00:58:09.290, Speaker B: It's a very serious production market.
00:58:09.442 - 00:58:47.118, Speaker A: But the stories and how it's getting deeper into the DGEn community and surfacing up ways to use the product. To use like, what's really interesting is that now it's for like getting DJ's to use a product by speculating things that are more DJ. Right. Yeah. Like an example of this is, like, with the boxing event with Ansem that happened recently with Barney the boy. They brought that as a market on polymarket. And to me, the strategy is, like, you and I have been bearish prediction markets.
00:58:47.118 - 00:59:08.528, Speaker A: Right. In the sense of crypto, I think it will be a thing, but I think the. The opportunity may be taken by meme coins. And coins, in terms of attention, there'll always be a place for prediction markets. But because it's capped, I think the excitement around the average user using that may be limited compared to meme coins.
00:59:08.616 - 00:59:23.680, Speaker B: So I was actually talking to an executive who come from a web two sports betting website. A very famous one. Yeah, very popular one. And he told me that the market share or the sports betting web, two sports betting websites are losing market share. To meme coins.
00:59:23.832 - 00:59:25.632, Speaker A: That's a pretty big. That's a pretty big.
00:59:25.688 - 00:59:27.616, Speaker B: That was a huge aha moment for me.
00:59:27.720 - 00:59:29.272, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a pretty good.
00:59:29.368 - 00:59:31.128, Speaker B: Because it all makes sense.
00:59:31.296 - 00:59:31.880, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:59:31.992 - 00:59:49.674, Speaker B: Like, the people who go do sports betting on those web, two sports betting websites are the same people that trade meme coins. And actually, Ansem. Ansem tweeted about this in December last year. I didn't pay attention last. Like, I. It didn't click with me when he first tweeted about it, but now it all makes sense.
00:59:49.834 - 00:59:50.330, Speaker A: Huh.
00:59:50.402 - 01:00:10.186, Speaker B: And because ultimately, like, what sports betting is about, ultimately, is, first and foremost making some money and second, the entertainment. And that's exactly what meme coins are. And I do think meme coins are a strictly better product so much. Because. Because the upside is unlimited, and it's unknown and unlimited.
01:00:10.290 - 01:00:25.828, Speaker A: Even if you think about, like, betting, you know, there's financial losses. Right? Like, I'm not saying that you don't lose money on meme coins, but you could, you know, in theory, limit the risk of how much you lose. Like, in theory. Whereas with pure financial betting, you lose your. It's like an option, right.
01:00:25.956 - 01:00:28.708, Speaker B: Well, I mean, the downside is 100% in both cases.
01:00:28.876 - 01:00:51.120, Speaker A: I mean, if you're talking about zero, right? Like, at least you have optionality. Like, there's a spectrum, right, in betting. I've never bet, so I don't know. So I've never made a bet in my life. But from what I've seen, it's either zero or hero meme coins. You could say it's hero, but you could say that there's a spectrum before you go to zero.
01:00:51.272 - 01:00:56.124, Speaker B: Yeah, fair enough. But let's face it, most people are going for the hero. Zero.
01:00:57.304 - 01:00:58.524, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:00:58.944 - 01:01:00.112, Speaker B: 100 x or zero?
01:01:00.208 - 01:01:13.484, Speaker A: 100 x? Zero. Yeah, 100%. Like if you're going to hold this thing to whatever, 100% agree. But you could say that it's a safer, to a certain degree, it's a safer bet than doing a pure binary trade. That's the way I see it.
01:01:13.524 - 01:01:18.084, Speaker B: Oh, by the way, Kyle, Simone also tweeted about meme coins yesterday. I thought it was interesting.
01:01:18.204 - 01:01:18.904, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:01:20.924 - 01:01:24.596, Speaker B: Isn't meme coins the best way to monetize open source projects?
01:01:24.700 - 01:01:25.556, Speaker A: He's getting it.
01:01:25.660 - 01:01:26.660, Speaker B: Do you agree with that?
01:01:26.772 - 01:01:36.524, Speaker A: I do. I think you could use just tokens as a way to monetize anything and increase the behavior of anything if it's done the right way.
01:01:36.684 - 01:02:07.760, Speaker B: If you really think about it, it's obvious in hindsight, because the crypto infra products are essentially open source products that are being monetized within meme coin. They don't accrue any value to the coin, at least with the exception of maybe Ethereum, which does have some real yield. The vast majority of infra projects are open source and are not accruing any value to the coin itself. So to me, they're meme coins and they're priced based on the level of attention.
01:02:07.872 - 01:02:15.168, Speaker A: And isn't there like projects that are scraping GitHub repositories and using it for their own advances from a product perspective?
01:02:15.216 - 01:02:15.640, Speaker B: Sure.
01:02:15.752 - 01:02:27.554, Speaker A: So could this, in theory, solve that problem where, like, you could scrape data, but then you get airdrop tokens? Thanks for contributing to this network. We're going to use your data, and every time we use your data, you get tokens.
01:02:27.674 - 01:02:34.778, Speaker B: Sure. Or every time you contribute to the or you do a pull request, you got a. Yeah, you got a token.
01:02:34.906 - 01:02:39.090, Speaker A: So I 100% agree. I think there's something, there could be something here with that.
01:02:39.202 - 01:02:41.530, Speaker B: Anyway, it's interesting. I can see that happen.
01:02:41.682 - 01:02:50.800, Speaker A: So I think the era that we're running into, that we're going into is the hyper tokenization era, I think.
01:02:50.962 - 01:02:51.732, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:02:51.908 - 01:02:54.036, Speaker A: And I think people are starting to get it.
01:02:54.180 - 01:02:57.984, Speaker B: Hyper universal interceptive tokenization.
01:02:59.044 - 01:03:00.524, Speaker A: Should we talk about Eigen?
01:03:00.644 - 01:03:04.068, Speaker B: Let's talk about Eigen layer, because there is a lot of FUD.
01:03:04.196 - 01:03:49.918, Speaker A: There was a lot of fudge. There's a mismatch of technical talent and their users. Obviously, the Eigen lair team is incredibly talented, very technical, research heavy, and you can see that through the DNA of the products that they're building. Even if you look at the tagline intersubjective tokens or a 42 white paper, just about the token. And then you have farmers that are very profit oriented that have maybe 100 different tokens that they're farming at the same time. So the attention that they give to any one project is probably nil or zero. And when you come out and say, hey, by the way, guys, here's a 42 page white paper.
01:03:49.918 - 01:04:08.382, Speaker A: I expect you to read this to figure out when you're getting your token. I mean, their only thing that they think about is one token and how much of it I'm getting. Then you come out and say, oh, by the way, here's a catch. We're going to hold your token. Well, why'd you even give it to us in the first place? Why'd you even tell us about it in the first place? You should have been upfront with us about it.
01:04:08.478 - 01:04:09.158, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:04:09.326 - 01:04:21.818, Speaker A: And so there's this, like, invisible social contract between protocols and farmers. They're both playing the dance. No one knows what the outcome is going to be, but the expectation is that it's going to the moon.
01:04:21.986 - 01:04:22.626, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:04:22.770 - 01:04:44.334, Speaker A: Right. And the protocol wants that to happen, but they also want to. They also know that most farmers are mercenaries and profit oriented and that they're just going to dump the token. And that's kind of the game that happens, right? Like, that's what it is. And so every now and then, you get someone, a protocol, they'll say, no, you. You know what? We're gonna do this. I think paradox.
01:04:44.334 - 01:04:47.382, Speaker A: Was it paradox or parasol?
01:04:47.558 - 01:04:49.438, Speaker B: Paras, right? Paraswap.
01:04:49.526 - 01:05:03.326, Speaker A: Paraswap. Sorry. Paraswap. Paraswap, who's also an alliance alum, did something kind of interesting, which kind of, like, upset the community. Starknet did this recently. That upset the community, and now it's Eigen lair. So, yeah.
01:05:03.326 - 01:05:04.166, Speaker A: What are your thoughts on it?
01:05:04.230 - 01:05:58.234, Speaker B: From a pure capitalist point of view? Sure, the farmers have the right to be angry, but they should also know that they knew from the beginning that whether or not they will get the airdrop and how much they will get was uncertain. They don't really have anyone else to blame. By the way, I'm not saying this to. I'm not defending or criticizing either side, but that's just the reality of things. It's the free market. If you want to farm something that has no certainty on the value and the amount, then, yeah, you bear the consequences. At the same time, I think what airdrop farmers don't know is that sometimes even the team doesn't know from the beginning how the airdrop will be conducted, because as you design the airdrop, in the token, as the dev, you start to realize that the whole legal and regulatory landscape is a huge black hole.
01:05:58.234 - 01:06:48.956, Speaker B: You learn new things every week, you learn new laws every week, new rules every week, and your legal counsel gives you new recommendations every week. So it's a constant moving target. And so it's true that eigen layer could have been more upfront about the geofencing and the non transferability of the tokens. It's also entirely possible that when they first launched the program, they had no idea that they had to geofence all these countries and had to do non transferrability. By the way, for those who don't know, I think the most likely reason why they implemented the non transferability of the tokens is actually legal. It's not the stuff that they put out on their website, like what they put out on the website is they wanted, you know, like they want decentralization and blah, blah, blah. That's not the real reason.
01:06:48.956 - 01:07:20.110, Speaker B: The real reason is legal. And I know this because I, some of the startups that we work with get legal advice like this from their council to lock the token for a year. So it's a legal thing. And it's entirely possible that Eigen layer team didn't know about this when they first launched the program. So yeah, Eigen layer team could have done better. But ultimately I think the right target to redirect our anger or for the airdrop farmers that redirect their anger towards is the regulatory regime and the three ladder agencies.
01:07:20.232 - 01:07:37.194, Speaker A: I agree, but with the caveat that you should be more upfront with farmers, you know, getting $15 billion in TVL. Right. It's a lot. Right. And so, you know, I think farmers have many opportunities ahead. Right. So there's an opportunity cost for farmers.
01:07:37.194 - 01:07:45.002, Speaker A: And so I do think that, you know, protocols need to be a tad bit more upfront about the way they're thinking about it, that's all.
01:07:45.178 - 01:07:57.556, Speaker B: The airdrop aside, the thing that I really struggle with is, are the avss real? How many avss will actually use Eigen layer and how much yield are they going to give to the Eigen layer stakeholders?
01:07:57.580 - 01:08:00.604, Speaker A: Can you talk about avss for, for audits? What does it mean?
01:08:00.644 - 01:08:31.752, Speaker B: And yeah, so avss basically are, it could be new protocols, new dapps that need security to secure their protocol, but they don't have their own token yet. So where would that security come from? It could come from the ETH restakers that use Eigen layer. So you can basically think of eigen layers as a two sided marketplace on the one side is those avss that need security, and then on the other side is the ETH restakers that provide ETH to secure those avss.
01:08:31.928 - 01:08:39.560, Speaker A: So why would avss need to launch their own tokens if they have, if they're using Ethereum as a way to secure their network?
01:08:39.672 - 01:08:57.944, Speaker B: Well, everyone has, has an incentive to launch their tokens, of course. So what I found is by talking to some of the avss, or potential ABS's, is that at the beginning of their startup journey, they are considering using Eigen layer, because launching a token is very, very difficult.
01:08:58.324 - 01:09:00.140, Speaker A: Oh, so like a bootstrapping mechanism.
01:09:00.212 - 01:09:11.182, Speaker B: Yeah. So Eigen layer is basically a bootstrapping mechanism for new protocols, but in the long run, every protocol has the incentive to launch of their own token.
01:09:11.318 - 01:09:31.234, Speaker A: I think that's a fair proposition, in my opinion. Why worry? It's almost like what Cosmos was trying to push with validator as a service model, which I think was the right approach, but obviously, and then the return the validators would have is that they would just get tokens of that new network.
01:09:31.534 - 01:09:55.624, Speaker B: But what I struggle with is how many protocols actually need security right off the bat. Because if you think about the L2s, people say L2s could become ABS's and then a bunch of middle layer protocols can become avss, can use Eigen layer. But if you think about the L2s, they're centralized. Like the way they secure their protocol at the beginning is to be centralized.
01:09:55.704 - 01:09:56.764, Speaker A: Centralized, yeah.
01:09:57.704 - 01:10:04.548, Speaker B: Their token has no reason to exist yet. They don't need avss. They don't need Eigen layer, but.
01:10:04.636 - 01:10:10.644, Speaker A: Okay, so let's say that, well, yeah, what if L2s want to decentralize.
01:10:10.804 - 01:10:13.692, Speaker B: But now they have their token, they can use their tokens.
01:10:13.868 - 01:10:14.460, Speaker A: Yeah, that's right.
01:10:14.492 - 01:10:24.284, Speaker B: Secure their protocol. So I'm sure there will be use cases, there will be good candidates for Eigen layer, but I just struggle with the number of that.
01:10:24.444 - 01:10:25.116, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:10:25.260 - 01:10:32.552, Speaker B: So we'll see how it plays out. I think Eigen layer has a good reason to exist, but how big, really the market is, we'll have to see.
01:10:32.648 - 01:10:59.260, Speaker A: And then you also have karak, which is a competitor to Eigen Lair. Some people have said that the recent speed of movement from Eigen Lair has been because karak and others are starting to compete with them. So I'm unsure of that notion or thesis, but just calling it out for our audience. But overall, I think Sriram and team are incredibly strong. I think they will do well. They just have to kind of. I mean, this happened with tensor.
01:10:59.260 - 01:11:01.060, Speaker A: Like, people flooded tensor when the token.
01:11:01.092 - 01:11:04.300, Speaker B: Dropped every arrow drop, because every airdrop.
01:11:04.372 - 01:11:17.828, Speaker A: There'S always a mismatch of expectations. Most people forget they demand one side with their picket, with their, you know, signs and pitchforks about why they need to get more tokens and yada, yada, yada.
01:11:17.956 - 01:11:18.564, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:11:18.684 - 01:11:41.012, Speaker A: But I do think there is a way. I think public comms is important. If you have, if your protocol launch your token, you know, try to be like, try to like, be more upfront, because as more as front load information and then drop the token versus dropping a token and then trying to fix it afterwards is the only suggestion I would have for protocols.
01:11:41.108 - 01:11:58.904, Speaker B: I agree you want to treat your users well, but at the same time, a lot of the fud is, it's a little bit misplaced as well. So honestly, I would take the, what's that guy, what's the health guru's name again? The guy who dated the six women at the same time.
01:11:59.324 - 01:12:00.484, Speaker A: Oh, a Huberman.
01:12:00.604 - 01:12:34.000, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah. I would take the Andrew Huberman approach, which is just not deal with it. Like, he just posted through the whole week. Like the week where there was so much fud, he did not address it at all, neither on his podcast or on Twitter. He just posted through, like, he just posted, kept on posting and talking and doing the podcast as he normally would, and the week later, everyone forgot. So I think the same thing, you know, with, with airdrops, I think the airdrop farmers will forget about this whole thing in a week.
01:12:34.152 - 01:12:40.438, Speaker A: Someone famously said that most users have like, short term memory. So, like, as long as.
01:12:40.566 - 01:12:44.406, Speaker B: Especially the airdrop farmers, they're by definition missionary.
01:12:44.550 - 01:13:00.902, Speaker A: Yeah. Speaking of airdrops, fantasy launched mainnet today, and I'm really excited about this team. They were part of our most recent batch. Maybe talk about how you, uh, your experience finding the, like, connecting with the fantasy team and, uh, we could talk a bit about.
01:13:01.078 - 01:13:12.106, Speaker B: Yeah, when they first launched the product, they just tagged me, like, because they, they have a bunch of cars, right? And every car represented, quote unquote, influencer. And I'm somehow one of the influencers. So they would.
01:13:12.170 - 01:13:14.666, Speaker A: No, no, no, you're not an influencer. You're a kol.
01:13:14.770 - 01:13:16.850, Speaker B: I'm a kol. Key opinion leader.
01:13:17.002 - 01:13:22.058, Speaker A: My opinions are key to leading the future of Defi.
01:13:22.186 - 01:13:45.500, Speaker B: Exactly. But anyway, so they thought footed their own product, and so they play the game. They collect the cards, and they collected me, and they tagged me on Twitter saying they collected my card of the card of me. So that's how I found out about them. And started chatting with them, and I really liked the team, and then we flew them to New York to work with us for two weeks, and they're just the most hardworking team of the cohort.
01:13:45.612 - 01:13:55.996, Speaker A: These guys are insane. 03:00 a.m. they would leave the office. I mean, I would leave at, like, I don't know, 09:00 p.m. every day. Every day. It's insanity.
01:13:55.996 - 01:14:11.264, Speaker A: But, you know, I would say that because they stayed so late and worked so hard, they inspired a lot of our other founders to. To work just as hard. So they have this, like, energy, even on Twitter. Like, just the energy. It makes me want to open up a pack every time.
01:14:12.084 - 01:14:20.988, Speaker B: I love their, like, you know, when you. When you create a referral call and tweet about it, and they have a new message every time.
01:14:21.116 - 01:14:21.468, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:14:21.516 - 01:14:37.800, Speaker B: And the latest is fantasy is the most egalitarian. Blah, blah, blah. You know that thing. Right? Most egalitarian. If it really, if it works, we'll really change the fabric of society. Like, they're so good at this stuff. They're so good at making and be funny and making things go viral, and it's very natural.
01:14:37.800 - 01:14:39.608, Speaker B: It's not cringe. It's very natural.
01:14:39.696 - 01:15:27.712, Speaker A: Very natural. All right, so I put this tweet out the other day that said, consumer crypto founders will have to master the art of incentives along with the art of attention. And those that do it really well can really onboard, like, a large group of, like, users, like, or core users. And I put, right after that tweet, I put in, those that followed the existing playbook will not make it, because every, like, every art or every launch has to be so unique, so special that people will, like, get rid of all the farming opportunities out of the way because there's a thousand, and they'll give 30% of their attention to this one protocol or this one special project. And that's very hard to do. That's very hard to do. But these guys have managed to do it.
01:15:27.712 - 01:15:38.496, Speaker A: And I think, moving forward, consumer crypto founders not only have to compete for attention, but they also have to compete for opportunity cost. Right. For farmers and just users generally.
01:15:38.600 - 01:15:42.832, Speaker B: So my current mental model for selecting founders, I have a very simple mental model.
01:15:42.928 - 01:15:43.424, Speaker A: Okay.
01:15:43.504 - 01:16:08.024, Speaker B: And there's obviously a lot of exceptions to this, but I love Ivy League kids who build infra, and I love DJ's who build apps. That's it. And I think if you're not a DJ, you cannot build great apps. Like, every team that I've seen that built really good apps in crypto are DJN's themselves. By being DJ's, they understand the users 100%.
01:16:08.444 - 01:16:38.988, Speaker A: I mean, it just goes back to this, right? You got a dog food crypto. If you can't dog food crypto for two years, then you won't understand the problems that crypto founders or users go through. I mean, like, you and I have talked to many founders that apply to our program and, like, the basic concepts of certain things that may seem so, like the problems of onboarding into wallets and bridging and all of that. Like, we can tell whether founders actually have gone through this. It's very easy for us to tell. Yeah. And so for founders are looking to apply to our program.
01:16:38.988 - 01:16:54.704, Speaker A: We're very heavy deep into crypto, and we're degenerating everything. We're, we're doing all of what users are doing today, and we'll get to pretty quickly. All right, I'm going to share my screen here. All right, live pack opening, guys, with top fantasy. What do you think I'm going to get?
01:16:55.324 - 01:17:01.836, Speaker B: You're going to get me? I think I get me if you get me. Simulation confirmed.
01:17:01.980 - 01:17:12.804, Speaker A: Simulation confirmed. Okay, let's see. All right, let's see what we got. Oh, I have more packs left open. All right, let's do this.
01:17:14.704 - 01:17:32.204, Speaker B: Music. Who is it? Sex offender, Dex offender.
01:17:34.244 - 01:17:39.300, Speaker A: War daddy Capital, Mikado, or what's the founder rippet fan.
01:17:39.412 - 01:17:41.724, Speaker B: The other founder, Eric Wall. Nice.
01:17:41.844 - 01:17:57.304, Speaker A: Eric Wall. Mark Chainsaw. Nate. Alex.
01:17:58.444 - 01:17:58.972, Speaker B: Lawrence.
01:17:59.028 - 01:18:17.364, Speaker A: Lawrence. What a beautiful experience. Oh, look, there you are. All right. That was a fun experience. Like the music, the lights. Well, thanks for catching good game.
