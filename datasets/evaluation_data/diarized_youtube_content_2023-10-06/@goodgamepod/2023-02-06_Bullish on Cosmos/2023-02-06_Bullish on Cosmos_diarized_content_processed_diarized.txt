00:00:00.090 - 00:00:33.894, Speaker A: I mean, overall, I just got far more bullish than I used to be on Cosmos. The combination of their focus on creating an actual value accrual mechanism to the atom token and the fact that there's more and more organic missionary developers building on top of cosmos. Adam is definitely something I want to buy in the bear market. And if you look at the chart, Adam is barely up from, like, the last bear happened. It hasn't moved. It's been, like, five years, whereas everything else has gone up, like, ten X. Like, ethereum is up ten x.
00:00:33.894 - 00:00:40.726, Speaker A: One order of magnitude. Atom barely moved. I don't know. I want to own Adam when the capitulation event actually happens.
00:00:40.828 - 00:00:49.330, Speaker UNK: Yeah, I'm looking at the chart, too. Holy. Yeah. I mean, this is insane. So I do see a very bright future for Cosmos and Adam.
