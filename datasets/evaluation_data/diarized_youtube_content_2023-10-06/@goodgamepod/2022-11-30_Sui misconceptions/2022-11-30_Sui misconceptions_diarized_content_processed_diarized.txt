00:00:00.170 - 00:00:37.654, Speaker A: A lot of times when folks look into Sui first, the first thing they see is these two different paths through consensus. The fast path that can do parallel commitment that has very low latency and then the route that uses sequencing using narwhal and bullshark. And I think there's a common misconception where it's like, oh, if I want to use this fast path then Swee is the best thing ever. But if I don't then Swee is somehow worse than other platforms and that part isn't the case at all. Where we think of it as like Narwhal and Bullshark are the best in breed. We have very fast consensus, very fast sequencing and it's just this other path gives you a way to skip that and have even lower latency for some class of transactions. So that's one technical misconception that I see a lot and possibly because we emphasize that first part so much because it's new.
00:00:37.654 - 00:00:41.300, Speaker A: But that's something I want folks to know is that both of these paths are really quite good.
