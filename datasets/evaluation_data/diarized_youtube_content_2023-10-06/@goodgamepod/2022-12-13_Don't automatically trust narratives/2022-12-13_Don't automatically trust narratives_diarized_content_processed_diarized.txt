00:00:00.160 - 00:00:32.444, Speaker A: You'll see a lot of narratives. The biggest narrative that I saw was Brian against FTX, hence why we did our podcast around Brian and Sam. And you'll see a bunch of people that will validate a thesis that may not be true. And so again, when you see these narratives play out, make sure that you do your own proper diligence and you don't like ape in or automatically trust the assumptions of people that are providing that assumption for you. I see this happening all the time. And so in introspect, just like think about it and make sure you make the calls the way you think they play out.
