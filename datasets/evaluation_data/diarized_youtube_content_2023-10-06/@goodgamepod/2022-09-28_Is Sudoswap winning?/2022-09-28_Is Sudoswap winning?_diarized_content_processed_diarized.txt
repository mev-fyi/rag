00:00:00.160 - 00:00:20.518, Speaker A: The analogy I'm hearing about Sudo swap is it's like uniswap and copper launch. All four jpegs is like the theme that I'm hearing and some of the interesting stats that I started to see as well is so far the total volume since launch of the AMM which was probably like less than a month ago was $30 million in total trading volume, which is interesting.
00:00:20.566 - 00:00:24.286, Speaker B: How much market share is that? Because the entire market went down in terms of trading volume?
00:00:24.390 - 00:00:29.950, Speaker A: I don't have the exact numbers but I think it was like 1015 percent of opensea trading volume.
00:00:29.982 - 00:00:30.614, Speaker B: Very meaningful.
00:00:30.694 - 00:00:40.070, Speaker A: In fact they've surpassed looks rare and I believe x two, y two which is the other NFT marketplace. This is all without incentives by the way.
00:00:40.102 - 00:00:42.718, Speaker B: Yeah, and looks rare used incentives, a.
00:00:42.726 - 00:00:50.334, Speaker A: Shit ton of incentives. Not only that, they had, I don't know, like every NFT influence in the world that backed the project publicly, right.
