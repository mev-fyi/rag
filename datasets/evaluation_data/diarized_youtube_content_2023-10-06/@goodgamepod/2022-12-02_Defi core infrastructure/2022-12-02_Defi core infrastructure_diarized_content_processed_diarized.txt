00:00:00.170 - 00:00:31.638, Speaker A: Defi is actually two things. There's defi infrastructure and there's DeFi applications. So in my mind, the likes of Uniswap and Aave basically spot decentralized exchanges and lending and also the core NFT marketplaces. I consider NFT marketplaces as Defi as well, by the way. These things are core infrastructure. Like, they just have to exist. Because if you think about what crypto is, it's an open ledger of assets that have some value.
00:00:31.638 - 00:00:43.170, Speaker A: And what do people do with these assets? They need to trade it, they need to lend it. So trading and lending of these assets, be it fungible or non fungible, they must exist. They're part of the core infrastructure.
