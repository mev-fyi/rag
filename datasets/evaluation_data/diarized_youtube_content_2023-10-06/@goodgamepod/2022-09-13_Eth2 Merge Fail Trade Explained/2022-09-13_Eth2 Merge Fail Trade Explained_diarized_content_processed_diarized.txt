00:00:00.240 - 00:00:28.102, Speaker A: So talk a little bit about the merge. I think about a week ago, the Ethereum foundation announced that the merge is confirmed for September 15, and there's a small community that thinks that it's not going to happen. They think there's a 4% chance that it will fail, which is priced by the staked ETH versus discount to ETH. That's right. So they're like shorting futures quarterlies. Oh, yeah. It's priced by the backwardation of futures.
00:00:28.102 - 00:00:53.024, Speaker A: That's right. Because the trade is if you long the ETH spot right now and assure the ETH future, then after the merge you're going to get ETH proof of stake and ETH proof of work, right? That's right. And so there's so much demand for this trade that the futures is now trading at a discount to ETH spot around 4% or something like that. So that's how they got the number of 4% probability.
