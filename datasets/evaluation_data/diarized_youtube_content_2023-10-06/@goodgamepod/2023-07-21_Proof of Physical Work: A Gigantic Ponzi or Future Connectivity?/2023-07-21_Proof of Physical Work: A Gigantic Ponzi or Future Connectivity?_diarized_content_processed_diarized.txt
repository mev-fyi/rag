00:00:00.200 - 00:00:37.420, Speaker A: If you read Matt Levine's newsletter, money stuff, he talked about proof of physical work. It was pretty funny because I read through it, and it pretty much said, yeah, you get people to run these devices, and they get paid in tokens. It's like a giant Ponzi scheme. But the hope is that more people come than they leave, and then the Ponzi may not. May not be Ponzi anymore. But then he ended up talking about, like, who needs Internet access in a rural area? How big of a customer base is that? Yeah. And the demand side has been plagued with, like, how is the demand gonna come? Where is it gonna come? And ultimately, we're giving out too much token, and there's not enough people that are gonna use the network.
00:00:37.420 - 00:00:38.244, Speaker A: Yeah, but helium.
00:00:38.284 - 00:00:39.204, Speaker UNK: In rural areas.
00:00:39.284 - 00:00:39.700, Speaker A: That'S.
00:00:39.772 - 00:00:41.316, Speaker UNK: That's not the market that helium is.
00:00:41.340 - 00:00:42.980, Speaker A: Going after. From what I see.
00:00:43.092 - 00:00:45.764, Speaker UNK: Like, the Internet in the rural areas, that's Elon Musk.
00:00:45.844 - 00:00:52.564, Speaker A: That'S starlink. Well, helium was the early days. Right now, I think there's a more concrete plan of where they're going next.
