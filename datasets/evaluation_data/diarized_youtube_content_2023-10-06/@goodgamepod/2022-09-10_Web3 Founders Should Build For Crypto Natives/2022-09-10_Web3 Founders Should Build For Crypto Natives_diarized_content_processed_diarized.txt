00:00:00.160 - 00:00:52.814, Speaker A: Well, at least from a practical point of view, there's two hurdles to this. One is whenever you deal with the real world, whenever you deal with the traditional legal system, there's just so much more friction. Like getting your startup, getting your first product built has so much more friction. It's so much harder to build real world product, quote unquote real world products than building crypto native products. But two more importantly I think that where crypto is going in the long run ten years from now is these centralized bridges that connect the crypto world to the real world. Yes they're gonna exist and yes they're gonna be successful, but the vast majority of economic activities are going to move more and more towards the crypto native side and that's where the opportunity is. That's just the natural trend of, that's just the natural state of things, right? Like more and more people are gonna become more crypto native.
