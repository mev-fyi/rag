00:00:00.200 - 00:00:28.706, Speaker A: What's interesting is the amount of time that's spent using a wallet versus the asymmetric bet in terms of how much money could be made right. In the early days, you were rewarded to going through different hoops and steps to learn how to like, develop or use a wallet that you may never have used before. And now, as crypto gets easier and easier to get onboarded, it makes it easier for people that want to use the apps itself to use it and find other ways to extract value, like DeFi or NFTs and etcetera.
00:00:28.810 - 00:00:46.914, Speaker B: In other words, you are rewarded for taking on the operational risk in the early days. One of the reasons why the early adopters of crypto made so much money is because they took on the operational risk of using super hard to use wallets, and the operational risk ultimately was compensated by the reward.
