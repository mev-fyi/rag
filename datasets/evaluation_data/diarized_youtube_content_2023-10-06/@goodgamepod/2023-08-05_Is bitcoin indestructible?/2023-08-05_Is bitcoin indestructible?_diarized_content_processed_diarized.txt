00:00:00.200 - 00:00:40.154, Speaker A: Bitcoin is sort of like indestructible. Like, think of this way, if something really bad happens to bitcoin, there's a good probability that the rest of the industry might not also survive. But inverse, like, if really bad things happen to the rest of the industry and bitcoin still survives, that can still happen at this point in time. I'm not saying that this will always be the case or something like that. If bitcoin doesn't keep its lead and so on and keep attracting developers, it's possible that something else becomes more interesting. I don't think I'm religious in that view, but for now that is the reality. Bitcoin is by far the biggest asset and the most decentralized and durable thing out there, and it's optimized for that.
