00:00:00.090 - 00:00:27.942, Speaker A: I've bought some NFTs on Solana, and I'm down bad on many of them. Specifically, I bought, like, Solana monkey business because it's, you know, one of the first genuine communities. But Djen apes is another one. But those two, I feel like, are forks or derivatives of board apes. So they have a pretty good community. But I don't think it's as genuine as, you know, the board apes community or the crypto punks community. Right.
00:00:27.996 - 00:00:35.122, Speaker UNK: Even between apes and punks, I feel like there is a difference. I feel like the punks are a lot more genuine, authentic.
00:00:35.266 - 00:00:36.018, Speaker A: Missionary.
00:00:36.114 - 00:00:37.394, Speaker UNK: But I might be biased.
00:00:37.522 - 00:00:38.420, Speaker A: No, you're right.
