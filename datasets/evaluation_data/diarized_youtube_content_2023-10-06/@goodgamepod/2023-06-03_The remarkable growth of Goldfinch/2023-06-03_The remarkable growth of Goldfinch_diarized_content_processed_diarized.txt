00:00:00.160 - 00:00:28.774, Speaker A: Goldfinch grew pretty consistently this year. The assets that are issued on Goldfinch are also debt instruments that are issued and bought by institutions. And Goldfinch has something around $100 million worth of real world assets. It's obviously much smaller than maker, but combined, we have already almost a billion dollars worth of real world assets, and that is within one order of magnitude of the top lending platforms like AaVE and compound. It's actually pretty remarkable.
