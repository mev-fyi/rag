00:00:00.120 - 00:00:20.302, Speaker A: Imran, when was the last time you came across a crypto social network and you were like, this is really interesting, instead of like, nah, this is just yet another Twitter clone. None so far. None so far. None so far. Because they all look like Twitter and existing web, two social networks. Yeah. My issue with that is if you clone Twitter or whatever, I think it's possible to get a decent amount of success.
00:00:20.302 - 00:00:59.464, Speaker A: You may be able to really appeal to a small group of users, but there has never been a single case in history where you copy an existing big, a successful product and achieve mainstream adoption with 6 billion people. A world changing product has to be something that's fundamentally different, that enables fundamentally new behaviors. The next Google will look nothing like Google. The next Facebook will look nothing like Facebook. So almost by definition, the first crypto network that will bring this space to the mainstream needs to be something so fundamentally different, so ridiculous, potentially even laughable. To a lot of people, it may seem like a total toy, but it needs to be fundamentally different from existing, very successful products.
