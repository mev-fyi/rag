00:00:00.170 - 00:00:08.890, Speaker A: This is something that just crossed my mind lately is that there is a real chance that monolithic chains are just testnets.
00:00:09.050 - 00:00:10.282, Speaker B: For cosmos.
00:00:10.426 - 00:00:21.326, Speaker A: Have you thought about it? Like, basically, you can use monolithic chains to prototype, quickly build a brand, attract a initial funnel of users, and then eventually just move.
00:00:21.348 - 00:00:22.122, Speaker B: To Cosmos.
00:00:22.186 - 00:00:26.146, Speaker A: What if every project wants to do that? Then those chains are just testnets.
00:00:26.178 - 00:00:26.882, Speaker B: For cosmos.
00:00:26.946 - 00:00:29.700, Speaker A: They could do that. Yeah. There's a real possibility for this.
