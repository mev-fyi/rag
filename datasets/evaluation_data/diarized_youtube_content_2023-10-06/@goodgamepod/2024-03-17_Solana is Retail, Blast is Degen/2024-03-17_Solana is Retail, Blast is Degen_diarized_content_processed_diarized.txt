00:00:00.170 - 00:00:11.470, Speaker A: Because the right community is there that the meme coins would launch. But it turns out, like taking a step back, I've realized that I was wrong, because the Djen community and the retail community are two different communities.
00:00:11.970 - 00:00:12.766, Speaker UNK: Oh, that's a good.
00:00:12.788 - 00:00:13.470, Speaker A: Point. Yeah.
00:00:13.540 - 00:00:14.254, Speaker UNK: So you're saying.
00:00:14.292 - 00:00:39.394, Speaker A: Solana is retail and blast is djen? Yes. Interesting. I didn't put two and two together until after the fact, and because of that, it just two different, very different communities. Right. Solana is a retail chain, and blast is a dgen chain for whales, crypto natives. And so. Okay, the distinction is crypto natives versus the non natives.
00:00:39.394 - 00:00:40.486, Speaker A: Yeah, I.
00:00:40.508 - 00:00:41.110, Speaker UNK: Can see that.
00:00:41.180 - 00:00:59.820, Speaker A: That's why you and I are so aligned with both, because retail is where newflow money comes in, which gives us great new insight into user behavior, and blast gives us new insight into crypto natives. Those are the two things that I align with so. Well, obviously, like, base has some really cool stuff, and some of the other layer twos have some really cool stuff.
