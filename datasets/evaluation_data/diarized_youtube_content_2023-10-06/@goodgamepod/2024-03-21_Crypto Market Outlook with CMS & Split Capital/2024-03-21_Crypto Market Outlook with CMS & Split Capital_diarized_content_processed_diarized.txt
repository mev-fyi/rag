00:00:00.320 - 00:00:04.074, Speaker A: Welcome to good game. Your no b's insights for crypto founders.
00:00:07.294 - 00:00:11.534, Speaker B: Where are we in the cycle? Are we still in a four year cycle? Are we in a super cycle? Are we.
00:00:11.574 - 00:00:14.314, Speaker C: You're always in the first inning left.
00:00:15.614 - 00:00:18.034, Speaker B: Are we in the left translated cycle?
00:00:18.854 - 00:00:22.206, Speaker C: Where are we? I'd say we're about halfway through it if I had a guess.
00:00:22.310 - 00:00:22.942, Speaker D: Say it again.
00:00:23.038 - 00:00:24.254, Speaker B: We're halfway through it.
00:00:24.414 - 00:00:26.214, Speaker C: Halfway through? Yeah, halfway through.
00:00:26.334 - 00:00:27.586, Speaker A: I didn't want to do that.
00:00:27.750 - 00:00:35.098, Speaker C: No, but maybe it's a super cycle. Maybe the ETF's just permanently keep us out. I mean, we haven't even had the hamming yet.
00:00:35.266 - 00:00:42.754, Speaker D: Yeah. It's also like, what does it even mean to be a four year cycle anymore? Do I think, like, we'll have rampant fraud like we did last time? Most definitely. Not.
00:00:42.834 - 00:00:44.954, Speaker A: Looking for your next startup idea in crypto?
00:00:45.074 - 00:00:46.666, Speaker B: Check out our request for startups list.
00:00:46.690 - 00:01:14.606, Speaker A: And get inspired at Alliance XYZ ideas. All right, welcome to good game. Today we have Zaheer from Split Capital and Dan from CMS. And today we're going to talk macro, where the market is today. How should founders be thinking about raising their round if they haven't raised their round yet? Thinking more about where the Ethereum ETF is. We just had the CPI update. Trump or Biden.
00:01:14.606 - 00:01:20.184, Speaker A: We can talk a bit about politics and whether or not we're going to choose rich today.
00:01:20.374 - 00:01:24.644, Speaker C: Is that like this? Is that the official saying? And we just like, it seems done now.
00:01:24.764 - 00:01:27.220, Speaker E: Is it already over it? No, no.
00:01:27.292 - 00:01:32.892, Speaker C: It's like, it's like done. Like it's side, like that's decided to be like the insane year.
00:01:32.948 - 00:01:36.252, Speaker A: It's, it's going to be that. We're going to make it. Not going to make it.
00:01:36.388 - 00:01:39.104, Speaker B: It's the new have fun staying poor.
00:01:40.324 - 00:01:40.708, Speaker C: Right?
00:01:40.756 - 00:01:41.124, Speaker E: Exactly.
00:01:41.164 - 00:01:45.740, Speaker D: That's what we just need. We need the CMS username not to reflect it. Right.
00:01:45.772 - 00:01:54.254, Speaker C: We need, I can't, I can't change it anymore. I had to. The stupid Twitter blue thing, it's like a pain.
00:01:54.414 - 00:01:55.094, Speaker E: Oh, that sucks.
00:01:55.134 - 00:02:07.102, Speaker C: For those of you talking, I know they buried me because I didn't have it. Like, it actually became unused like that. Like really nice, but like, you were just like yelling into the void if you didn't have the like, little blue ticker.
00:02:07.158 - 00:02:07.630, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:02:07.742 - 00:02:09.814, Speaker C: And then I enjoyed those trends.
00:02:09.934 - 00:02:10.766, Speaker E: I enjoy it.
00:02:10.790 - 00:02:14.794, Speaker C: I know you need to lobby and write Elon and I'm sure he'll read.
00:02:15.174 - 00:02:19.674, Speaker A: It gave me some idea where we are in the market. I mean, that was like my only indicator.
00:02:21.134 - 00:02:25.382, Speaker C: I was crowdsourcing them at the end. People would just give them. It got very easy.
00:02:25.518 - 00:02:26.486, Speaker E: I got one in there.
00:02:26.510 - 00:02:42.888, Speaker D: It was Boston Dynamics. When the robot dogs were gone with CMS, Boston Dynamics, that was my one user submission, so. And I actually got. I got the blue chip, so I got the CMS logo in blue. That was, that was also me, thankfully. Just a little bit of credit. I'll take.
00:02:43.056 - 00:02:43.800, Speaker E: No, I.
00:02:43.872 - 00:02:46.720, Speaker C: Guys, listen, I wish I could continue to change it.
00:02:46.832 - 00:02:47.784, Speaker E: What about the picture?
00:02:47.824 - 00:02:49.536, Speaker A: Like, the PFP?
00:02:49.680 - 00:02:50.560, Speaker E: You can't change it.
00:02:50.592 - 00:02:51.844, Speaker D: They'll nuke your.
00:02:52.144 - 00:02:52.924, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:02:54.704 - 00:02:56.088, Speaker C: They lock you in.
00:02:56.256 - 00:02:56.784, Speaker E: You can't.
00:02:56.824 - 00:02:58.096, Speaker C: It's just, you can do this stuff.
00:02:58.120 - 00:02:58.848, Speaker D: It's just a bitch.
00:02:58.896 - 00:03:00.984, Speaker C: Like, they just like make it take time and.
00:03:01.104 - 00:03:02.832, Speaker E: Yeah, like, I could change it.
00:03:02.848 - 00:03:04.808, Speaker C: It'd just be like, it's too much of a hurdle.
00:03:04.896 - 00:03:08.184, Speaker A: You almost want to get paid for it at that point. Like, it's just too much time.
00:03:08.224 - 00:03:08.848, Speaker D: Correct.
00:03:09.016 - 00:03:10.824, Speaker E: You do get paid. Yeah.
00:03:10.864 - 00:03:11.600, Speaker D: Oh, too true.
00:03:11.672 - 00:03:16.888, Speaker C: The narrative. $20. Yeah, I got $600 last month.
00:03:17.016 - 00:03:18.004, Speaker E: That's a big.
00:03:19.264 - 00:03:22.804, Speaker D: That's huge. Holy crap. Wow. You're eating good, huh?
00:03:24.504 - 00:03:26.084, Speaker E: Did you yolo into it?
00:03:28.504 - 00:03:35.776, Speaker B: Um, let's get, let's get straight to it. Uh, what's. What's you guys, uh, what's your guys, uh, macro view?
00:03:35.920 - 00:03:36.536, Speaker E: Where are we?
00:03:36.600 - 00:03:42.128, Speaker B: Where, where we are in the cycle? What about the ETF flow? You know, anything else you track?
00:03:42.216 - 00:04:24.476, Speaker C: I don't think much of the, like, traditional macro stuff. Like, I would be honest. I'm like, bearish people that trade crypto, like, getting involved in that stuff in aggregate, but like, even more so right now. I think it's like pretty irrelevant. I kind of think it really is just about these ETF flows until they slower stab, but as long as they're consistently putting in, I don't know, 300 to 500 million sort of a day, I think it's a pretty easy trade where you just sort of run with that. I really don't think you care about anything else that's going on in the world, obviously, absent a real exogenous shock. But little macro changes are irrelevant in the grand scheme of things.
00:04:24.476 - 00:04:28.444, Speaker C: When you've got the flows being as big as they are still now, they may slow.
00:04:28.484 - 00:04:28.636, Speaker E: Right?
00:04:28.660 - 00:04:37.124, Speaker C: Like, they're not gonna. I mean, maybe they'll be like this for a really long time, but like, it's not like a guarantee, but while it continues, just like, ride that wave.
00:04:37.244 - 00:04:57.784, Speaker A: When do you think. I mean, obviously it's very hard to figure out when it'll slow down. But like, if you're, if you're a traditional fund manager looking into this, you would obviously comp it to gold. So would you comp it against gold? And what, like from a market cap perspective, like how would you think about where investors will say, like, all right, this is enough?
00:04:57.944 - 00:06:06.174, Speaker D: I think it's kind of irrelevant, right? Because, like, I think what, what bitcoin represents to people at this point is just like, like everyone's accepted that it is just like the excess valve of, you know, monetary policy, right? Like it could be worth infinite and it doesn't have to mean anything, right? But I think the problem becomes for a lot of people, like how allocated you are overall to it. And if you are or aren't, it's like a binary bet, right? Like, am I in crypto? Am I not in crypto? And if not, and this thing is running away from me, why am I not in it, right? And I think that's more of the question that's being asked than what is a reasonable price target for bitcoin, right? Because objectively speaking, there's no reason why it's trading at 70k versus 100k plus. And that's also the interesting thing about price discovery. What's the fair value? Who knows? Where does it head to from here? Bitcoin is the pinnacle momentum asset, right? So we could be trading much higher. And I think Dan and I probably agree that we probably will be trading much higher within reason. But how and why does someone get there is I think, whatever kind of moon map they want to come up with themselves.
00:06:06.474 - 00:06:24.974, Speaker C: I think there's been some outflows from the gold products that people have attributed to inflows into the bitcoin. I just don't think people penetrate it that much or even really think about it a ton. Maybe if we start to approach it in a larger percentage, it'll start to become a narrative. But in the short term, I don't think it's a ton of what people are thinking.
00:06:25.394 - 00:06:43.972, Speaker B: Guys, maybe taking a step back. So every trader, every investor has different time horizons. For me, for example, I have maybe two strategies. I have a cycle long time horizon and I have short term time horizon, one to two months kind of thing for you guys. What is your primary focus? At what time horizon do you feel you have an edge?
00:06:44.058 - 00:07:10.146, Speaker C: That's a good question. I don't know, like one to three sort of month time horizon, if that makes sense. I'm not trading super short dated stuff, but I think we try to see where flows are moving and then what the corollary, like, if you push one part of the system, like, what will react next? I mean, a lot of it is like a lag lead relationship between stuff. And I think that time kind of plays out on a weekly and then maybe like a monthly sort of level.
00:07:10.280 - 00:07:10.590, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:07:10.622 - 00:07:26.390, Speaker D: Generally what we do is we take like, a year long approach, and then we will condense it back to, like, six months, three months, one month, one week, and we'll liquidity adjust each one of those different tab horizons. So we'll make one big, bold claim for the year.
00:07:26.422 - 00:07:27.486, Speaker E: Right. It's like ETH.
00:07:27.510 - 00:07:36.752, Speaker D: ETF. ETH is bullish, let's just say. Or like, last year was bitcoin. ETF. Bitcoin is bullish kind of idea. Very simple, very easy to kind of wrap around and very easy to falsify, too. Right.
00:07:36.752 - 00:08:01.844, Speaker D: If that narrative doesn't hit, then, like, you can actually reduce your positioning, but everything else in between. Right? Like, you know, nobody can tell you what is the next narrative. I think that's like, the biggest trap, but it's more like, okay, there's money moving in this direction, and this direction seems like it has legs, and then we can reason out, like, there's generally some. Some good momentum moving in that direction. So that's. That's how we think about it more broadly. And then also, like, you know, final point being that, yeah.
00:08:01.844 - 00:08:14.614, Speaker D: Once you can kind of think about, like, the next a couple of months, then you will have those periods where markets will move, like, countercyclically, and then things change very drastically. That's why we have high pensions for liquidity, too.
00:08:14.734 - 00:08:31.194, Speaker B: Okay, so I agree with you guys that probably the most important metric to track right now is the ETF flow, and that almost outweighs anything else at this moment. But I would assume that there might be some things that would lead the ETF flow itself.
00:08:31.354 - 00:08:31.746, Speaker E: Right.
00:08:31.810 - 00:08:35.890, Speaker B: So the ETF flow is a reflection of other pieces of information, potentially.
00:08:36.042 - 00:08:36.810, Speaker A: So one thing I can.
00:08:36.842 - 00:08:54.330, Speaker B: I can think of is, I feel like Nvidia, this one stock is actually pulling the entire market up, the entire stock market upwards, and the stock market bleeds into crypto a little bit. Do you feel the same, do you feel there's any other leading indicators that might be interesting?
00:08:54.442 - 00:09:30.690, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, like, risk assets in general are going to trade, like, sort of in the same direction. I think, like, the biggest issue you have with the ETF that you, like, can't sort of, like, pull, like those sort of heuristics sat with yet is that, like, the access is a little, like, it's stepwise, right? Like, and we don't really. I'd say everybody in this conversation has no fucking idea. And, like, in general, sort of the, like, crypto spot, market participants like, that we're going to talk to, like, don't have any ideas. Like, the access and sort of the decision allocation of putting into the ETF for, like, larger pools of capital is, like, completely out of our purview. Like, some of this stuff is, like, people can't even, like, access the, like, product yet. And it's, like, opening up and it's stepwise.
00:09:30.690 - 00:10:08.446, Speaker C: And, like, certain, like, advisors get access to it and then, like, their client base can touch it. Or certain, like, approvals and risk committees need to go through certain, like, larger, like, allocators that, like, may. So they take. So, like, that whole decision making process is absent to us. And I think that is going to drive a lot of the fun flow for the first year of this thing. And that's more important than, like, what is the s and p sort of done over, like, sort of the year. So I think, like, that's the problem is, like, yes, if we're in a steady state where, like, anybody who wants to trade this thing is able to trade this thing and get a piece of it, and whatever sort of exogenous or shocks you're seeing in the equity market move demand for that.
00:10:08.446 - 00:10:18.422, Speaker C: The thing is, the demand is being driven by access still, I think, for a while. And the problem is we're really just not going to really be able to get a good view into that from our world.
00:10:18.558 - 00:10:49.326, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that's the most important point. These flows are so sporadic, we can't even, like, I can't tell you what the flow will be tomorrow. The only thing is, I can see it on the tape generally, and then from there, then we can kind of, you know, do some reverse engineering on the math, but altogether, like, you know, can it trade another 500 million daily for the next 30 days easily? Can it also not, like we. I have no more certainty in one outcome than another, necessarily, which is make makes it way more difficult to trade, and I'm sure Dan can probably agree to that.
00:10:49.430 - 00:10:53.854, Speaker C: Yeah, I think we're really outgunned here. I think it's just like a world we don't play in.
00:10:54.154 - 00:11:06.994, Speaker B: Earlier you said that you're bullish on ETH this year and probably due to the ETH ETF. What is your probability estimate for the ETF approval in May?
00:11:07.114 - 00:11:29.674, Speaker D: Guys, I miss Ethel lines as they come, but I don't know. I can't tell you. Right. Whatever my probability is worth has the volatility of swinging 70% in either direction overnight. So I'm optimistic that the ETF will pass in the next year or so. Whether that's in May or not, I don't know, but I'd probably see pretty good odds that that's the case.
00:11:29.834 - 00:11:35.226, Speaker B: Have you heard any informed takes from other people? Let's say the bloomer ETF guys?
00:11:35.370 - 00:11:35.842, Speaker E: No.
00:11:35.938 - 00:11:55.024, Speaker D: I mean, honestly, and I don't mean to call these guys out because they've done good work in other areas, but they just don't seem to understand what the point of ethereum is, broadly. And they kind of seem pretty backed up on. On bitcoin as a whole. I'm like, no, I mean, I tweeted this last night, too. I was like, there's been no cogent argument. Like, Nate. Is it Nate grassy from.
00:11:55.024 - 00:11:56.624, Speaker D: From ETF store?
00:11:56.744 - 00:11:57.184, Speaker E: He's been.
00:11:57.224 - 00:12:06.824, Speaker D: He's been, like, probably the only, like, tradfi guy who's kind of like, nobody's giving me a good reason why ETH won't pass outside of just, like, the administration hates it, which isn't a real narrative.
00:12:06.864 - 00:12:07.016, Speaker E: Right.
00:12:07.040 - 00:12:15.502, Speaker D: That's not a real, like, you can't. You can't just hate something and then, like, oh, I'm not gonna approve it. Like, you'll get sued. And they have gotten sued, and, like, do they want to run it again?
00:12:15.598 - 00:12:19.354, Speaker A: I don't know. All the legal experts, at least, are very bearish.
00:12:19.734 - 00:12:20.874, Speaker B: Trevinsky.
00:12:22.334 - 00:12:32.910, Speaker C: Yeah, he's bearish everything now. He comes out like the world. I mean, I love him and I like him a lot. He's just like, he skews so hard. Negative.
00:12:33.062 - 00:12:33.794, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:12:34.334 - 00:12:36.278, Speaker B: Isn't that a common thing among lawyers?
00:12:36.366 - 00:12:56.188, Speaker C: Like, a lawyer lawyers, I think in general, you're dealing with, like, the not greatest display of people. So you just, like, you. If you end up in a court, right? Like, something has gone wrong and, like, somebody is. So I think they just have this very skewed outlook of, like, I don't know, that's my take, or at least, like, well, people that are way deep in it.
00:12:56.356 - 00:12:56.756, Speaker E: So.
00:12:56.820 - 00:13:10.094, Speaker D: So usually, like, your first job in whatever sector you're in will shape your outlook. And Jake, I believe, joined in, like, 2017, 2018 in crypto. Like, pretty much full time defi on top of that.
00:13:10.204 - 00:13:10.474, Speaker E: Right.
00:13:10.514 - 00:13:25.850, Speaker D: Like, crypto policy. Right. Like, when it was, like, hyper demonized. Right. So he's probably just like, oh, like, you know, in the same way that, like, I just view everyone as an anti. Against the crypto. Like, but that's very much a byproduct of like the environment that I kind of like got my, you know, standing in crypto.
00:13:25.850 - 00:13:31.442, Speaker D: So I would imagine there's some amount of bias there. By the way, Jake Jerinski is a great guy. He's a great guy.
00:13:31.538 - 00:13:58.116, Speaker C: Yeah, he's very nice. I don't know the same question plus, but I put it in a coin flip, which is maybe a little bit better than like the, I think one of the implied odds seem like 30% by like the random sort of poly markets. Yeah, I put stock in it. The Bloomberg UTF guys, like, they have like a very high weighting in my mind on this stuff. Like they've been pretty on it for everything. But there's a couple of smart people that are making arguments on the other side. I got nothing, so I'm just going with a coin.
00:13:58.116 - 00:14:14.968, Speaker C: But I do think we'll have it before year end. I just don't know if we'll have it. May like the timing is a little like I'd be very shocked if we're here this time next year talking and there's not, there's not a lot of reason, I think, to hold it up that long. But may I, may short, I could see it getting kicked.
00:14:15.016 - 00:14:15.544, Speaker E: I don't know.
00:14:15.624 - 00:14:22.376, Speaker C: So I'm not, I probably agree with that. Trading it, if that makes sense. Like, I don't think there's a ton of that.
00:14:22.400 - 00:14:24.088, Speaker D: Dan is just naturally aligned with ETH.
00:14:24.136 - 00:14:49.202, Speaker C: So I look, I think, I think we need more. You put an ETF wrapper on everything. If you can get it through, I will say I don't think we're going to see ETF products, anything else further down the curve for a long time. I think that flow is going to pretty much be get a CME future, get that trading for a bit, then roll in ETF. There's people who keep talking about, oh, we're going to have this ETF. Anything further out. I do not see a world they're putting that through any time.
00:14:49.202 - 00:14:51.054, Speaker C: Even if ETF gets approved.
00:14:52.154 - 00:14:58.216, Speaker B: One of the Bloomberg ETF guys said the trapfire world doesn't care about ETH. Something to that effect.
00:14:58.370 - 00:14:58.868, Speaker E: Do you agree?
00:14:58.916 - 00:15:22.388, Speaker C: I think that's probably doesn't care versus like, has less demand than like it definitely has less demand than bitcoin. I mean, it's like a smaller asset. I think that they're probably not getting ton of inbound interest for ETH from the people they're speaking to. And I think that probably does meet the demand. I think the bigger problem is, though, they're missing retail interest in it, and there's also interest in it once it exists.
00:15:22.436 - 00:15:22.596, Speaker E: Right?
00:15:22.620 - 00:15:37.040, Speaker C: Like, if you've got bitcoin there, those people who are taking positions in it are, like, at least naturally going to, like, look at ETH. So I don't know. I think it's a little skeptical to be like, oh, they're only interested in bitcoin. They won't take a look at this whole gateway drug concept with, like, crypto.
00:15:37.072 - 00:15:38.248, Speaker E: Is, like, sort of always been a thing.
00:15:38.296 - 00:15:48.648, Speaker C: I don't know. I think people, if you put it out there, it'll get inflows and it'll trade. I think there's more demand for it then just because people aren't coming up to you being like, I really want to, like, get to meet, like, I.
00:15:48.656 - 00:15:51.384, Speaker A: Don'T know what would be the narrative that will get them going on Ethan.
00:15:51.384 - 00:15:57.400, Speaker D: I think staking, honestly, it's, like, a pretty. Pretty lucrative one, right? Like, imagine getting dividends on ETH, right?
00:15:57.512 - 00:16:00.504, Speaker A: What the alternate bond was what I heard.
00:16:00.664 - 00:16:02.684, Speaker D: I mean, it's easy, right?
00:16:03.104 - 00:16:04.032, Speaker E: Yeah, it's super attractive.
00:16:04.048 - 00:16:09.904, Speaker D: Well, also, like, this is also part of the reason why ETH doesn't hold up well as an index asset, because.
00:16:09.944 - 00:16:12.184, Speaker A: Like, it's so usable, right?
00:16:12.224 - 00:16:17.084, Speaker D: Like, you can collect yield. You can do a lot of things with ETH that you theoretically can't do with BTC today.
00:16:18.624 - 00:16:19.656, Speaker A: That narrative is changing.
00:16:19.720 - 00:16:28.352, Speaker D: It is changing. For sure. For sure, it's changing. But I'm just saying, like, generally speaking, like, you see, like, the largest holders of ETH have been the same holders, and they'll go park it from, like.
00:16:28.488 - 00:16:29.792, Speaker E: You know, like, we'll put it in.
00:16:29.848 - 00:16:45.322, Speaker D: Lido, and now it's an eigen and, you know, whatever else, right? Like, mantle or Morpheus or whatever, you know, other kind of staking platform they so choose. But I think the yield narrative is pretty attractive for ETH, right? Because it's deflationary, and you get yield, like, pretty sick.
00:16:45.458 - 00:16:46.498, Speaker E: I think it's just easy enough to.
00:16:46.506 - 00:16:59.306, Speaker C: Be like, it's a diversity thing. Like, you buy a little bit of this. Like, I don't know, you size it. You buy 80, 20 bitcoin ETH. Like, I don't know. We would see this historically back in the day, like, circle. Like, guys would come in, they'd buy, like, a slug of bitcoin, they'd buy a little bit of ETH, and then they'd, like, spray out.
00:16:59.306 - 00:17:04.634, Speaker C: Like, it was almost never, like, I just want to buy, like, one. Like, I take, like, a little bit of a basket approach.
00:17:04.794 - 00:17:05.994, Speaker D: Diversification.
00:17:06.154 - 00:17:42.084, Speaker A: I don't know if you saw Jim Bianco's tweet from Bianco research. I want to throw this out there just to get your thoughts. He talked about how, I think he said this at the bottom, by the way, this is like 60k or whatever. And he said that because it settles in cash, we could have a polarized effect of up only and then down only, or we'll have a liquidation cascade. A cascade of liquidations. Because ultimately, when you're selling back via ETF, it'll settle in cash, it'll automatically impact the market. What are your thoughts on that thesis or theory that, that Jim Bianco put out there?
00:17:44.224 - 00:17:47.600, Speaker C: But wait, what? I mean, like, if you're selling, it's going down. I get that. But, like, his thought process.
00:17:47.632 - 00:17:49.200, Speaker D: Yeah. That's all he's saying.
00:17:49.352 - 00:17:49.664, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:17:49.704 - 00:17:53.584, Speaker C: Is he saying it's worse because it's a cash create redeem mechanism?
00:17:53.624 - 00:17:54.160, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:17:54.312 - 00:17:55.048, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:17:55.216 - 00:18:22.600, Speaker C: I don't think that really matters too much. I mean, I think what matters more is, like, if the people that have, like, purchased the ETF, I don't know, what has been, like, 10 billion of flows. Right. Like, if those, like, people are more or less sort of likely to dispose of the position if it starts moving against them. I. I would actually say it's like a group of people that probably less, like, I think, like, that money is a lot stickier than you sort of see with the traditional pools of capital that were purchasing crypto. Like, crypto was still is, like, very retail heavy.
00:18:22.600 - 00:18:31.146, Speaker C: Right. So, like, that tends to be a very shaky user base. I think the ETF probably skews less, though. I haven't seen a good breakdown of that flow at all.
00:18:31.240 - 00:18:32.238, Speaker E: I don't even know if you can.
00:18:32.286 - 00:18:40.334, Speaker C: Get a good breakdown of it. Like, if it's all just, like, people buying in their brokerage account instead of going on Coinbase, it's just the same group of people anyway, and it won't matter.
00:18:40.454 - 00:18:41.046, Speaker E: But I don't know.
00:18:41.070 - 00:18:47.846, Speaker C: I don't think the cash create redemption mechanism, like, will add volatility on the way down. I'm not a buyer of that.
00:18:47.990 - 00:18:48.654, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:18:48.814 - 00:18:50.014, Speaker D: It's just naturally bearish.
00:18:50.054 - 00:18:50.206, Speaker E: Right.
00:18:50.230 - 00:19:09.866, Speaker D: If people start redeeming, which is something he did say. Right. Like, because it goes up so hot, then it might come off so hot. But, yeah, I generally think, like, the average buyer of the ETF is not, like, like Dan said, some random, like, retail buyer who's pumped in ETF's number one like, you can't even get options on the number two. It's like, why would you wait all this time to just start suddenly pounding in?
00:19:09.970 - 00:19:10.882, Speaker E: You could have just done it on.
00:19:10.898 - 00:19:42.182, Speaker D: Coinbase all these years. So I think the only rational narrative is probably, like, the people underestimate drastically how large the RIA market in the US is and how many people are just considered high net worth individuals, and how many of these people can just, like, you know, the aggregate, like, number of dollars that exists in the US just from, like, private wealth is an insane amount of money. And we're not even, like, close to having, like, any material flow into crypto from. From these people. And it's already had such a drastic, you know, price impact.
00:19:42.238 - 00:19:42.718, Speaker E: Right.
00:19:42.846 - 00:19:44.998, Speaker B: What are you guys, uh, trading these days?
00:19:45.126 - 00:19:48.902, Speaker E: Meme coins. Basis trading. Anything else?
00:19:49.078 - 00:20:00.302, Speaker C: AI coins should have been trading meme coins. That's been all the action. We trade a lot of the l one s that's still been our dominant. It's liquid, it's big.
00:20:00.358 - 00:20:01.034, Speaker E: You can.
00:20:01.374 - 00:20:23.190, Speaker C: That's kind of, like, been our bread and butter. We do do a fair bit of the basis. The basis has been hard just because the cash, like, flow. Well, and I say the ETF flows are so big that you tend to, like, to have this, like, heuristic where if the curve gets really steep, right? Like, that's like, gravity, like, comes, like, sort of back. The problem is if, like, the cash bid is so big and it just keeps, like, ripping it up. Like, that's. You're.
00:20:23.190 - 00:20:58.864, Speaker C: There's a lot of leverage in the system right now, but it's not as relevant because there's also a lot of, like, cash pushing through the system. Like, it's. It's hard to then, like, use sort of that natural, like, function. I mean, that being said, like, it's not going to last forever, and the curve will, like, come meet it and you'll still get, like, that roll down, but you've had, like, better luck just, like, being allocated, like, long. So we're doing a lot of the rotation of the l one s that has caught a pretty good bit the last week as Solana slowed sort of its growth. But we've also just been looking a lot at the new stuff that's getting built on bitcoin. We've been taking a deep dive into that stuff.
00:20:58.864 - 00:21:03.988, Speaker C: There's a lot going on there fast, and we're just trying to get up to speed to it. So that's where we've been playing around.
00:21:04.116 - 00:21:15.366, Speaker D: Yeah, very much the same, but I would say more of our focus has kind of been on, like, the hottest of narrative, right? Which is like, AI has taken off. Like, that's been a decent sized position for us.
00:21:15.510 - 00:21:20.030, Speaker A: What AI sector? I guess startups or companies or tokens you're looking at?
00:21:20.142 - 00:21:22.074, Speaker D: Oh, I get to show my bags.
00:21:23.134 - 00:21:24.582, Speaker A: This is not investment advice.
00:21:24.678 - 00:21:54.842, Speaker D: Not investment advice, no. Being more serious, I think that the simpler the narrative, the easier it is for people to understand. I think the biggest mistake you can make in any of this stuff is just acting like you understand what the potential technological implications are. I'll be first to say I don't. And to understand that, like, this is equally, in the same eyes of, like, l one valuation. What's the value? Well, whatever the comp of the other value is, right? Like, you know, so that's how everything in crypto trades. It's how everything the world trades.
00:21:54.842 - 00:22:10.848, Speaker D: So render tao. These are obviously the two biggest names that people are really looking at. There's been a lot of, like, seed deals, pre seed deals, series a deals that are doing, like, AI, whatever, billion dollar valuations. It's insane, right? It's insane.
00:22:10.936 - 00:22:12.256, Speaker C: Yeah, we're back.
00:22:12.320 - 00:22:37.240, Speaker D: That we're so back. This is another problem we can talk about, too. It's just like venture dollars and crypto, like, this has been, like, the scourge of the space. Sorry, Dan. That just, like, all of these dollars coming into, like, these deals, like, you can. You, like, I've coined this term, like, the crypto VC supernova. Writing research on this, but you're seeing, like, kind of this almost implosion of, like, how much money is going into deals and how quickly.
00:22:37.240 - 00:22:57.152, Speaker D: Right? Like, you have, like, incremental dollars kind of coming into the space, and then, like, ten x, the VC demand all of a sudden, like, it's crazy. But I think, you know, overall, like, in the other things that we kind of take a. Take a look at, really is just like, ETH related products, I think Eigen will be very, very large. Blast. Two has been pretty, pretty interesting. We're seeing a lot of these tokens.
00:22:57.168 - 00:22:59.804, Speaker A: Kind of like, are you farming either of those?
00:23:00.264 - 00:23:40.260, Speaker D: We haven't only taken a look at Eigen. We've been spending time there and then, you know, on an Eigen related products like mental Morpheus, that kind of stuff. But I think Eigen will be, like, one of the more sticky narratives for ETH and can create a pretty reflexive ETH bid, too. That's also why we're pretty much very interested in ETH in particular. But a lot of it really just comes down into, like, how much exposure can you get in the market broadly, right? Like, a lot of the stuff trades pretty cyclically anyway. Like, AI came back after meme coins went down kind of thing. Right? Like, so you can see all these, like, market rotations happen within themselves, which don't make sense historically, right.
00:23:40.260 - 00:23:54.698, Speaker D: In the past, it used to be index, you know, mid caps, and then, like, garbage, right? But now it's kind of like we'll cycle through different bags of garbage before, you know, I don't know, eventually, like, imploding. But.
00:23:54.866 - 00:24:24.870, Speaker B: So I have a question on render versus tao. So my thesis is that AI coins are the meme coins of the cycle. But then the question is, I have in mind is, let's say a new retail comes to this market, how do they pick which AI coin to buy? Because there's actually a very meaningful differences between Tal and render. Tal is has a much worse unibios than the render, and it's not listed on a centralized exchange.
00:24:25.022 - 00:24:28.206, Speaker D: Yeah, those are, those are two.
00:24:28.270 - 00:24:33.718, Speaker C: I mean, if you can't access it, that's huge. And then, like, the unibytes. The unibytes is very real.
00:24:33.846 - 00:24:34.554, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:24:35.654 - 00:24:50.536, Speaker D: Also, it's just like in the name. Right? Like, I think that's like a very underappreciated aspect of this. Ultimately, I don't. Yeah, it's like Bittenzer tao. Like, I don't understand AI from that. Right. Render AI, I feel like it's kind of hard to mess that up.
00:24:50.536 - 00:25:09.888, Speaker D: Right? So. But they've both done, like, tremendously well. Right? So it's just more of a function of, like, how much liquidity can you get on the asset, right? Like, that's what I care about more. It's like, okay, you want to buy some AI index, whatever, right? But, like, ultimately, like, the only differentiating factor is just how much can I pair off against, like, some other asset in the portfolio?
00:25:10.056 - 00:25:14.752, Speaker B: What about that, that coin that's listed on binance with the ticker AI, sleepless.
00:25:14.808 - 00:25:16.324, Speaker A: AI or something like that.
00:25:17.744 - 00:25:19.644, Speaker C: There's literally a great ticker.
00:25:20.544 - 00:25:26.608, Speaker A: They have no product. I mean, like, maybe they do have a product, something with games or something, from what I read when I went on the website.
00:25:26.776 - 00:25:29.536, Speaker B: No, no, it's not x AI. You were talking about x AI, Imran.
00:25:29.560 - 00:25:34.284, Speaker A: No, sleepless AI. That's the AI.
00:25:35.064 - 00:25:35.664, Speaker E: Right?
00:25:35.784 - 00:25:38.728, Speaker A: I mean, from the website, I feel like it was just.
00:25:38.856 - 00:25:41.736, Speaker C: Yeah, that's the one on sleepless is on binance.
00:25:41.880 - 00:25:42.604, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:25:43.344 - 00:25:44.240, Speaker C: About this.
00:25:44.392 - 00:25:44.768, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:25:44.816 - 00:25:48.284, Speaker A: Which is the OG AI ticker. It's worth like, to 1.2 billion.
00:25:48.904 - 00:25:51.576, Speaker C: I guess that's what an AI ticker on finance is worth.
00:25:51.720 - 00:25:52.456, Speaker E: Right.
00:25:52.640 - 00:25:58.484, Speaker D: But the ironic part is because, you know, american retail can't access finance anymore, it might not be that bullish. Right.
00:26:00.514 - 00:26:11.778, Speaker B: You know what I found out recently? People say China bans bitcoin or China bans crypto. In actuality, chinese citizens can open an account on binance and american citizens cannot.
00:26:11.906 - 00:26:12.386, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:26:12.490 - 00:26:14.586, Speaker D: No part of that is surprising, I guess. I suppose.
00:26:14.730 - 00:26:16.530, Speaker C: Well, they never really banned it.
00:26:16.562 - 00:26:16.682, Speaker E: Right.
00:26:16.698 - 00:26:19.978, Speaker C: It was just like, certain people couldn't move cash in and out.
00:26:20.106 - 00:26:21.130, Speaker E: Like, there was restrictions.
00:26:21.162 - 00:26:23.618, Speaker C: But, like, you've always been able to hold it natively.
00:26:23.746 - 00:26:25.374, Speaker E: Right? Yeah.
00:26:26.304 - 00:26:34.704, Speaker C: Dealing with this since 2013. Yeah, well, I mean, because binance runs a giant p two POTC market still. At least I think so.
00:26:34.744 - 00:26:34.872, Speaker E: I.
00:26:34.888 - 00:26:37.912, Speaker C: Not that I deal with it a ton, but, like, at least that's how people were getting in.
00:26:38.048 - 00:26:38.512, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:26:38.608 - 00:26:47.064, Speaker D: Also, like, binance is way deeper on. Sorry, China's way deeper on the bitcoin narrative. Overall, most of the BRC stuff that's been happening has been.
00:26:47.104 - 00:27:09.564, Speaker C: Oh, yeah, 100%. I'd say they're a good six months ahead of anybody. There was multiple assets that were, like, over a billion dollars. Like, trading, like, big size in that sector that you. I swear to God, you would have taken ten people in the west that were, like, actively trading crypto and maybe, like, one of them had heard of either. It was, like, wild. This was, like, probably six months ago, so.
00:27:09.944 - 00:27:11.136, Speaker E: Yeah, like, 40 was the big one.
00:27:11.160 - 00:27:14.016, Speaker C: Was like, the other track was another.
00:27:14.080 - 00:27:14.684, Speaker E: One.
00:27:16.664 - 00:27:19.600, Speaker C: Track, I guess, like, stack that I heard of.
00:27:19.632 - 00:27:20.620, Speaker E: But anyway.
00:27:20.652 - 00:27:37.636, Speaker C: Yeah, but, like, there was. There was a whole just, like, movement over there and we were just, like, complete. It is, like, a little wild to me. Like, how different the west and the east are still not so much with, like, bitcoin, but, like, the further, like, tail assets. Like, there's, like, really two different worlds still going on. And we try to keep a good line with people that are over there. It's like.
00:27:37.636 - 00:27:44.036, Speaker C: It's hard, but it's, like, pretty beneficial to know, like, how they're thinking and they have no idea what we're, like, looking at half the time.
00:27:44.180 - 00:28:09.810, Speaker D: Yeah, it's ironic, right? Like, we. One of the core thesis we had around stacks internally was literally, we love stacks because nobody in the US, like, really is paying attention to it. And it does well in that narrative. And because the american VC's are so caught up in Solana versus Ethan, more like modularity. Whatever nonsense you want to come up with. Right. Whatever buzzword you want to insert.
00:28:09.810 - 00:28:27.010, Speaker D: But instead, people really overlooked how much flow, like these. Like, I remember already was doing like, top five volume, like, for a few weeks straight, like, on binance, which is just nuts. Like. And like, not one person I knew, like, held this thing, other than, like, my friends at Utxo. That's about it.
00:28:27.042 - 00:28:27.186, Speaker E: Right?
00:28:27.210 - 00:28:36.058, Speaker B: Like, so speaking of bitcoin and modularity and all that stuff Danny mentioned, your. Your biggest trade is on the lir one rotation.
00:28:36.146 - 00:28:36.346, Speaker E: What.
00:28:36.370 - 00:28:41.816, Speaker B: What are you excited about? What are you bullish on these days, both from a short term and long term perspective?
00:28:41.960 - 00:29:12.790, Speaker C: God, I guess, like, so on the short term perspective, I think you've got a lot of money that moved into bitcoin, Ethan Solana, over the last, I don't know, year. Right. Let's call it, I think a lot of that money, if it does look to sort of just, like, if it looks to diversify in any, like, capacity, or if it looks like to, like, sort of move into any other bets, like, I think there's other l ones. I don't want to, like, name names because they just don't want to get, like, about, like, sort of like, picking sides, anything. But, like, there's a bunch of the other l one s that are sort of. Of the same vintage that.
00:29:12.982 - 00:29:14.190, Speaker E: Even if your argument is like, they're.
00:29:14.222 - 00:29:30.794, Speaker C: Not going to sort of hold the candle, they're going to be like a competitor. They're probably trading too cheap on a relative basis. So I think there'll be, like, capital flow sort of into that as a pair trade. I would never, like, advocate going short like the majors sort of against those, but I do think that there'll be some more rotation of stuff into that.
00:29:31.694 - 00:29:33.622, Speaker D: He's talking about Avax, by the way.
00:29:33.758 - 00:29:34.286, Speaker E: Yeah, I know.
00:29:34.310 - 00:30:07.940, Speaker C: I'm not talking about Avex. There's a bunch. I'd say there's five that we've, like, taken shots on, but there's also the whole l two world for bitcoin isn't a thing yet, but when it is, I do think they'll be like the same sort of parrot thing where people look to those as an allocation decision versus taking sort of money out of their bitcoin. Ethan solar positions that have done well, we're pretty excited. Like Monad. We think that's going to be a big one as it comes down to. That's like a longer term one.
00:30:07.940 - 00:30:10.860, Speaker C: Like, Kevin works there. Like, it was our intern for a bit.
00:30:10.892 - 00:30:11.188, Speaker D: Sorry.
00:30:11.236 - 00:30:34.532, Speaker C: Like, it's got a soft spot in my heart, but really, like, sort of what they're doing over there. But that's, you can't action on that, so I can name it. I don't know. That's like sort of how we, we think of stuff. Like, our decisions are less technical and more just market flow than they to be, like, completely. Like, we're not really making strong technical, like, fundamental levels decisions on, like, where we think, like, pricing is going. Like, we're not.
00:30:34.532 - 00:30:44.576, Speaker C: Like, this is better because of XYZ whatever, like, technical implementations. It's more just like, we think this is cheap on a relative basis. We think flows will sort of go there to continue.
00:30:44.760 - 00:30:45.408, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:30:45.536 - 00:31:26.544, Speaker D: Generally we look at it pretty similarly. The only big thing that we kind of, like, really differentiate on, I guess it's just like we just like holding the index more. Like if we're just optimistic ETH, like, anything that, anything that isn't ETH that we want to hold, like, if we're bullish, ETH has to really outperform in our minds. It has to be for a specific reason. So Solana was our biggest conviction bet from $10 because it's just free money. And then that obviously switches at a certain point when it's like, okay, everyone's way over allocated Solana now it kind of goes back to ETH. And that rotation alone can make a fund and then more so on the l two s on ETH, too.
00:31:26.544 - 00:31:40.992, Speaker D: I think we're going to start seeing a lot of those kind of taper off in value a bit, because just how, like, expensive they are on a relative basis to, like, a lot of alto ones, like, average from being worth like 20 something billion is quite expensive.
00:31:41.048 - 00:31:44.912, Speaker C: So the l two's trade is so rich in my mind.
00:31:45.048 - 00:32:07.314, Speaker D: Yeah, they're insane. They're just, it's absurd. Those are ones that, like, we're not as fond of anymore. But it'll change. Right. It all ebbs and flows and, like, this is why we don't give, like, we don't call pod shots, like, you know, across the board. Like, Avax has done tremendously well in the last, like, week or two on this, like, maple story narrative, but, you know, you're seeing like, a pretty, pretty fat bid on that.
00:32:07.314 - 00:32:35.136, Speaker D: But for newer technologies, like, you know, obviously, like, Monad has been, like, the biggest one that everyone's kind of talked about, but initiative as well. Another, you know, modularity kind of narrative that I think will do quite well. Team is good, obviously, like, I'm biased. I have a, of an angel investor. But at the same time, like, generally, it's these teams that I think will have a differentiated product, but we'll be able to deliver also. It just really is 100% driven by market value.
00:32:35.200 - 00:32:35.424, Speaker E: Right.
00:32:35.464 - 00:32:39.760, Speaker D: Like, what's to say the stuff should trade at 1020, $30 billion when it goes live.
00:32:39.912 - 00:32:40.224, Speaker E: Right.
00:32:40.264 - 00:32:45.672, Speaker D: I'd never thought say would trade at 10 billion like it does. But, you know, congrats to the team for making it happen.
00:32:45.728 - 00:32:46.232, Speaker E: Right?
00:32:46.368 - 00:32:53.598, Speaker A: Is there organic activity happening on avalanche? I haven't been really following it closely. I know there's a meme coin called.
00:32:53.776 - 00:32:55.210, Speaker C: They got a meme.
00:32:55.402 - 00:32:55.954, Speaker E: Say it.
00:32:55.994 - 00:32:56.774, Speaker D: Say it.
00:32:59.554 - 00:33:00.454, Speaker A: Cock.
00:33:01.074 - 00:33:02.330, Speaker D: Cocky new.
00:33:02.522 - 00:33:03.386, Speaker A: Cocky new.
00:33:03.490 - 00:33:18.306, Speaker C: I am, like, definitely not just talking about Avax either. Like, there's. There's definitely multiple ones that are. I don't know why everybody's, like, inferring that, but I'm gonna. It depends. If it goes up, I'll take credit for it. No, I think there's, like, a handful that, like, matter.
00:33:18.306 - 00:33:23.800, Speaker C: The thing with the activity is, like, the tv on the activity. Like, a lot of times, price drives it, too.
00:33:23.952 - 00:33:24.304, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:33:24.344 - 00:33:26.136, Speaker C: Like, I think that's, like, part of the problem.
00:33:26.320 - 00:33:26.640, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:33:26.672 - 00:33:41.520, Speaker D: The fundamentals get better when the price goes up kind of thing. I mean, but it's really real. Right? Like, people want to start using things when the price goes up or they have an incentive to go do things. Right. And this is, like, I don't know. We probably can talk about the points thing, right. But, like, that's probably, like, the best abstraction of this concept.
00:33:41.520 - 00:34:06.406, Speaker D: Right. Where, like, people are like, how do we pre influence the pre tge of the pre product, pre whatever, right? Like, it's like the announcement of announcement, right? It's like Justin sun, like, cubed, you know? Like, how do we. How do we financialize this market, right? So, I mean, we're seeing it. I mean, crypto. Crypto is the best market in the world for. For creating levers of financial speculation. So I'm all.
00:34:06.406 - 00:34:07.126, Speaker D: I'm here for it.
00:34:07.150 - 00:34:25.426, Speaker A: So when ethinal first launched, there's a lot of, like, criticism. What side of the coin are you? Are you for Athena? Obviously, like, I think they hit a billion dollars or something. Tvl but I'm curious on would you have invested if they pitched you pros, cons? What are your thoughts? Maybe Dan with you first.
00:34:25.570 - 00:35:04.302, Speaker C: Yeah, I think, look, Athena, like, at its core is, like, it's a trade that's, like, packaged up and, like, which I don't have a problem with. I think, like, my issue, if any, with it is that people don't, like, realize that it has risk. I think, like, that is my concern with it is that I think sometimes it gets confused to be like, whatever they call like a dollar peg. It's close enough that people sort of get to this, like, stablecoin idea on it, which I think is bad. Look, packaging up, like the basis, like, roll down and, like selling that and, like throwing on some, like, staking yield with it is like, clearly there's demand for it and, like, people want that yield and, like, that's like a thing and that's fine. Like, I don't have, like, a core problem with it. I just, like, do want sort of the market to be aware there is risk.
00:35:04.302 - 00:35:25.312, Speaker C: Like, this thing could get toasted. Like, it's not like guaranteed. And like, I'm not saying, like, it's unlikely that we're going to just like, suddenly start trading like, crazy, like backward aided. But, like, there's been times where, like, the curve is like moved down like 35, 50%, like in the course of like 48 hours. Like, it can get. Have like, real shocks to it and, like, you think you can, like, execute on these things and you can't. So I don't know.
00:35:25.312 - 00:35:26.408, Speaker C: As somebody who's, like, traded a lot.
00:35:26.416 - 00:35:27.712, Speaker E: Of it, like, just want to make.
00:35:27.728 - 00:35:35.888, Speaker C: Sure that people aware sort of the risk on it. But, like, there's, I got no beef with, like, it as like a concept. Like, I think, like, it's fine as long as people are aware of that.
00:35:36.016 - 00:36:29.190, Speaker D: Yeah, I think, you know, it's ironic that, you know, you guys brought us on. I was like, I'd probably say, like, I know Dan's trader, the futures curve, probably more than anyone else I know in the space, but, you know, I've spent a tremendous amount of time on it as well. It's definitely not a free ride in any way, shape or form. It's also like, I got into, like, a bit of a spat the other day with someone talking about, like, unifying rates on, on, like, across the board. It's like, you should never want to unify rates like, counterparty risk, credit risk between different exchanges. It's massive, right? Like, what happens when one exchange blows out or, like, you can't put enough size on another, right? And then there's, like, a lot of things that I think, like, again, it just depends on how you, how you kind of want to advertise it again. I have friends who've invested in this, friends working on the project, so I'm not trying to knock it, but, like, at the same time, like, there's definitely, like, inherent risks and also, like, counterparty risk on exchanges that you actually want to, you know, go and put this money on.
00:36:29.222 - 00:36:29.366, Speaker E: Right.
00:36:29.390 - 00:36:30.854, Speaker D: Like, this is a good question.
00:36:30.894 - 00:36:31.046, Speaker E: Right?
00:36:31.070 - 00:36:45.224, Speaker D: Like, and you can ask Dan on this, but how much money do you think the futures curve can even take? Right. Um, at, like, a decent yield. It's not as large as people think. Right. So there's even a cap to it. Like, you. You are bringing your own kind of cap into how much rates can go, right.
00:36:45.224 - 00:36:49.672, Speaker D: So, like, the product works really well when it's not that large, theoretically, or.
00:36:49.688 - 00:36:51.400, Speaker C: You got a bull market, but even.
00:36:51.432 - 00:37:01.044, Speaker D: Then, like, I don't know, the rates will come off enough. Or, like, then you'll have, like, really weird arbs between CME and, like, it's, like, a bunch of things, right? Like, they call it.
00:37:01.744 - 00:37:11.912, Speaker B: They call it the synthetic dollar, and the ticker is usde, which, to me, that. For me, that's the biggest problem with it, which is that it's pretty misleading for retail.
00:37:12.088 - 00:37:12.804, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:37:13.424 - 00:37:23.424, Speaker C: If I got any gripe with it, it's just like. Just call it more, like. Just like, this package trade that, like, you're looking to sell, and, like, that's fine. And then just, like, put the wrist on it and let it go.
00:37:23.504 - 00:37:24.304, Speaker E: I don't know.
00:37:24.464 - 00:37:28.556, Speaker D: Yeah, this is OG Babel finance. I mean.
00:37:28.580 - 00:37:29.012, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't know.
00:37:29.028 - 00:37:29.180, Speaker E: We.
00:37:29.212 - 00:37:55.764, Speaker C: I mean, we did talk to him a lot, too, and they were, like, setting it up, and, like, we. I don't think there's, like, any bad intentions or any, like, hiding of stuff. I just, like, I just want to make sure everybody's aware of the risks and the stuff going into it. I mean, that being said, like, it's crypto, right? Like, there's. There's a lot of risks and a lot of things that, like, nobody's, like, seeing when they're doing it. So it's like, this is not even probably top ten sort of real risks I've seen, like, not put in front of people. I mean, we had many such cases two years ago.
00:37:58.264 - 00:38:02.844, Speaker A: So do you think this will be around to. This product will be around two years from now?
00:38:03.624 - 00:38:11.688, Speaker C: I think, yeah, I do, probably. Yeah. My concern for it is, like, that there's, like, just a giant shock. Like, you guys remember XIV?
00:38:11.816 - 00:38:12.584, Speaker E: You remember that?
00:38:12.624 - 00:38:19.236, Speaker C: Like, sort of, like, whole side. It's great. It's great. It's great. It's dead.
00:38:19.360 - 00:38:20.212, Speaker E: I don't think it's going to end.
00:38:20.228 - 00:38:22.620, Speaker C: Like that, but I just think there is, like, tail risk on it.
00:38:22.732 - 00:38:24.076, Speaker E: Yeah, yeah.
00:38:24.220 - 00:38:45.860, Speaker D: Also, it's really hard to kill these stable coin projects for what it's worth. Like, even like the worst, like, I don't know, tusd or whatever, you know, random stable coin. Like, they never actually fully die because someone can always park, you know, USD in there and it looks good. So I guess the better question is, like, will it be, you know, will it massively grow in two years time? I'm not. I'm not entirely sure. And it's very much, it's very much market beta.
00:38:45.892 - 00:38:46.036, Speaker E: Right.
00:38:46.060 - 00:38:56.638, Speaker D: And I think sue actually said this, right, which is like, you're actually better off. Just like longing ETH if you're bullish on Athena, which is ironic, but, yeah, the truth. Right? It only goes up if heath goes up.
00:38:56.766 - 00:39:01.750, Speaker B: Where are we in the cycle? Are we still. Are we still in a four year cycle? Are we in a super cycle?
00:39:01.822 - 00:39:04.994, Speaker C: Are we always in the first inning left?
00:39:06.294 - 00:39:08.714, Speaker B: Are we in the left translated cycle?
00:39:09.534 - 00:39:12.942, Speaker C: Where are we? I'd say we're about halfway through it if I had to guess.
00:39:13.078 - 00:39:13.754, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:39:14.164 - 00:39:15.268, Speaker A: Wait, I didn't hear that.
00:39:15.396 - 00:39:16.676, Speaker B: We're halfway through things.
00:39:16.820 - 00:39:17.588, Speaker E: Halfway through?
00:39:17.676 - 00:39:18.388, Speaker C: Yeah, halfway through.
00:39:18.436 - 00:39:20.364, Speaker A: Sorry, I didn't want to hear that.
00:39:20.524 - 00:39:28.348, Speaker C: No, but maybe it's a super cycle. Maybe the ETF's just permanently keep us out. I mean, we haven't even had the hamming yet.
00:39:28.516 - 00:40:07.092, Speaker D: Yeah, it's also like, what does it even mean to be a four year cycle anymore? Do I think, like, we'll have rampant fraud like we did last time? Most. Most definitely not. Like, I don't think peak to trough will be ever, like, as bad as it has been in the past, but at the same time, do I think a lot of the VC supernova can persist? Probably not as well. But again, it's funny, it's like you ask two guys who primarily run their businesses as liquid, so it's literally embedded in the outlook we have every day, which is. I don't really know, but I don't really have to know necessarily in order to continue doing my job. And that's literally why we started split capital as a liquid fund.
00:40:07.218 - 00:40:08.168, Speaker E: If we didn't do it, then it.
00:40:08.176 - 00:40:12.984, Speaker D: Would be a huge problem because I don't know how much harder markets can run from here. And I hope it's forever. Right.
00:40:13.024 - 00:40:19.832, Speaker B: So what is the biggest bullshit you guys are seeing in the market or in the industry that you want to call out?
00:40:20.008 - 00:40:36.834, Speaker C: Oh, they want to call out. That's like a slightly different question. I think there's a lot of. There's a lot of things being attached to meme coins, like in their market action that I think is just kind of nonsense.
00:40:37.334 - 00:40:38.710, Speaker E: Like, and I'll say this, like, first.
00:40:38.742 - 00:40:55.734, Speaker C: Off, like, I have no beef with them as, like, an asset. I know beef with people, trading them. Like, I think the whole thing's fine, but there's this whole idea that, like, this is, like, culture incarnate. And, like, this is, like, the great. There's, like. And there's, like, people writing crazy thesis is about some of this. I just, like, I'm not there.
00:40:55.734 - 00:41:14.924, Speaker C: Like, maybe I'm old and, like, I just don't get it anymore, which is possible, but I have personally, like, I don't see it as much more than, like, people like to speculate, and they're gonna find the fastest thing to speculate on, and they're gonna do it, and that's fine. And I think that's, like, cool. Like, doge isn't, like, a new thing, right? Like, it's been around forever. It's had, like, multiple cycles.
00:41:15.044 - 00:41:16.052, Speaker E: And it doesn't mean, like, all these.
00:41:16.068 - 00:41:29.294, Speaker C: Things are gonna die either. People are, like, inferring crazy things. Like, people inferring that, like. Like, the entire financial system is gonna be overthrown because, like, meme coins have, like, changed the way, like, people, like, think about. I just, like, a little. Something's a little out there for me.
00:41:29.414 - 00:41:31.494, Speaker A: But the vc's coming in now, right? So.
00:41:31.654 - 00:41:35.110, Speaker E: Yeah, I don't know. I.
00:41:35.142 - 00:41:45.806, Speaker C: Like, I've seen meme coins raising rounds now. I think that's, like, wild. Like, I don't. I'm not even. I. Whatever, I guess, like, do it, disclose it.
00:41:45.830 - 00:41:46.654, Speaker E: I'm not sure.
00:41:46.814 - 00:42:30.076, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, the meme code stuff has definitely, like, moved pretty far out there, I guess, in, like, calling things out, I would say it's just, like, something I've been telling a lot of people, just been talking about pretty actively, is just how real returns are and, like, what it actually means to return capital and, like, make money in the space. And I think there's a lot of, like, glorification of, like, a handful of people that can make money, but ultimately, like, doing this stuff day in, day out is extremely difficult. And, like, I would not tell the average person to ever do this as their primary function, most definitely, because, like, it's. There's nothing to glorify about this. Like, it's. It's incredibly difficult. And, like, getting to a point where you can consistently do it is.
00:42:30.076 - 00:42:46.424, Speaker D: Is impossibly difficult, and it's. It's. It can all go away in a minute, too, right? Like, you can. You can always can like end up with a reality where like your edge no longer works and you can lose your money and you don't realize it. So I just, you know, kind of call out like more the p and l flexing.
00:42:50.394 - 00:43:00.122, Speaker A: Today we have Jackson, the founder of Thunder Terminal, to talk to us a bit about what he's learned building a crypto startup. Jackson, what are you building right now?
00:43:00.138 - 00:43:08.866, Speaker F: We're trying to build a trading platform on chain that lends the same user experience as you might have with like Coinbase or finance or any of the sort.
00:43:09.010 - 00:43:12.170, Speaker A: What's one thing that you've learned while you were building this product?
00:43:12.282 - 00:43:27.018, Speaker F: One of the main takeaways I had was that crypto index is way too hard on the tech and that's fine to do, but the issue is that all of Defi in aggregate has less users than some note taking apps on the App Store. So until there's user adoption, what's the tech good for?
00:43:27.106 - 00:43:27.706, Speaker E: I don't know.
00:43:27.770 - 00:43:29.986, Speaker F: That's one of the main takeaways most definitely.
00:43:30.130 - 00:43:37.058, Speaker A: How do you think about sourcing feedback from customers and users, especially being that it's much harder to reach them versus.
00:43:37.146 - 00:43:45.576, Speaker F: Traditional web two, we have communities on Telegram and Discord and I usually get DM's on Twitter, those respective apps as well.
00:43:45.680 - 00:43:47.048, Speaker E: I think like, you know, the community.
00:43:47.096 - 00:44:00.360, Speaker F: Is pretty vocal about stuff they want, but to be frank, a lot of our developers and myself included also use the application and are traders by trade. So we don't need to source too much user feedback to know sort of what the next thing is.
00:44:00.392 - 00:44:02.216, Speaker A: To build your dog food, your own product.
00:44:02.320 - 00:44:03.544, Speaker E: Yeah, pretty much.
00:44:03.664 - 00:44:07.960, Speaker A: What's one lesson that you've learned that you want to give to future founders or building this space?
00:44:08.112 - 00:44:10.768, Speaker E: Try to build a business as opposed.
00:44:10.816 - 00:44:23.704, Speaker F: To just like a token launchpad. I think incentives are kind of misaligned in crypto where founders effectively are able to IPo at any point in time, whenever they want, like an IPO equivalent. And that's fine, but you should build something sustainable.
00:44:23.784 - 00:44:25.752, Speaker C: I think that's like one of the.
00:44:25.768 - 00:44:29.104, Speaker F: Things I very rarely see in crypto is something that lasts more than a single cycle.
00:44:29.184 - 00:44:30.432, Speaker E: It's very rare.
00:44:30.608 - 00:44:40.510, Speaker A: Obviously crypto is a very volatile market. Some days you have really good days, some days you have really bad days. Given that youre building a on chain trading terminal, how do you take this?
00:44:40.622 - 00:44:41.622, Speaker E: Ill be frank.
00:44:41.758 - 00:44:54.982, Speaker F: A lot of people come to me and theyre like, oh, x tangentially competitive product has like y feature or does this amount in volume or whatever it is, but the truth is, ive been talking to some of the folks that weve been working with recently, and I.
00:44:54.998 - 00:44:57.238, Speaker E: Realized that we just are really the.
00:44:57.246 - 00:45:10.696, Speaker F: Only project reinvesting back into itself and not taking money off the table. I have the utmost respect for lifestyle businesses, but they. They aren't necessarily sustainable in the highest growth stages. They work to a point.
00:45:10.800 - 00:45:12.912, Speaker E: So I would say that back to.
00:45:12.928 - 00:45:38.500, Speaker F: The thing I mentioned regarding sustainability and making it through multiple cycles. I realized that in a bull run, being cash flow positive isn't very useful. So we're pretty much going balls to the wall in this just to ensure that we do last multiple cycles as a cemented project that people go to and are familiarized with and trust. I think right now is the time to scale up. It's not the time to take cash off the table. And not a single project that's competitive with us is doing that.
00:45:38.612 - 00:45:39.780, Speaker E: None that I'm aware of.
00:45:39.892 - 00:45:43.956, Speaker A: You're going all in. I think that is probably the right move. Coming to a bull market.
00:45:44.100 - 00:45:48.172, Speaker F: Yeah, pretty much all in, all ships on the table. We'll see what the river cards are.
00:45:48.188 - 00:45:50.036, Speaker E: I don't know yet, but, yeah, we're.
00:45:50.060 - 00:45:51.396, Speaker F: Going balls to the wall on this.
00:45:51.500 - 00:45:51.844, Speaker E: Awesome.
00:45:51.884 - 00:45:53.284, Speaker A: Jackson, thank you so much for your time.
00:45:53.364 - 00:45:53.748, Speaker E: For sure.
00:45:53.796 - 00:45:54.744, Speaker F: Appreciate it.
00:45:58.404 - 00:46:04.144, Speaker B: What would you recommend? Either the average retail or a crypto founder who has a full time job.
00:46:04.524 - 00:46:09.780, Speaker D: Just buy shit that you believe in, but that's about it. And if you don't like, but most.
00:46:09.812 - 00:46:17.556, Speaker B: Shit that most shit that people believe in are actually shit. And there may be only a handful of assets that's worth holding long term.
00:46:17.740 - 00:46:39.534, Speaker D: I don't think so. I think I push back against that. I think most people know what's value and what's not and why what's real. I think every time someone's like, I'm gonna go buy X and Y and Z coin, they only do it out of greed. I don't think it's. I don't think it's almost ever done out of, you know, anything other than, hey, yo, like, I need to make more money because my friend made too much money. And, like, you know, everyone is making money, and I'm sidelined and poor.
00:46:39.534 - 00:47:08.708, Speaker D: And I think literally every single person on the timeline thinks this, whether subconscious here or not. They just think, like, I'm being sidelined. Everyone else is making infinite more than I am, which is literally not the truth at all. Like, I think one thing that I've learned post FTX, I worked on a lot of claim stuff post FDX. What I learned is literally everyone lost all their money, like more or less in this space. So, you know, there's a pretty, pretty big, like liquidation overall. Like, people don't have the money that they used to have theoretically.
00:47:08.708 - 00:47:25.384, Speaker D: And, like, it's just best not to ever compare it to, like, whatever p and l selection you see on Twitter. It's just not, it's not sticky. We've seen it a hundred times over. Guys like me, you like, im runtime. Weve seen, like, many, many p and l flexors, like lose it all in the dumbest ways possible.
00:47:25.504 - 00:47:27.368, Speaker E: Right? Yeah, yeah.
00:47:27.416 - 00:47:29.480, Speaker C: Sorry. I dont know whats going on my camera.
00:47:29.592 - 00:47:30.284, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:47:30.904 - 00:47:58.698, Speaker C: If anybody ever asked me, I just, this has actually changed a little over time. But its like, I tell him to buy a little bit of bitcoin, a little bit of ETH, and a little bit of Solana and then just like, dont look at it. I think thats just kind of the only advice ill ever feel giving. And that used to be just bitcoin and then it used to just be bitcoin eats and now its like the three. And if something gets really big and stable, I would, like pitch that as like a fourth. But that's like sort and, like size those, obviously, like, accordingly. I think that's like the best advice you can do.
00:47:58.698 - 00:48:03.570, Speaker C: If you're not going to be out there in the weeds, like doing this, like full time, like, I don't think you should be bothering.
00:48:03.722 - 00:48:05.178, Speaker E: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:48:05.226 - 00:48:12.394, Speaker D: This is a, this is another lesson from sue, which was there are no part time doctors, there are no part time lawyers, there should be no part time trader.
00:48:12.434 - 00:48:12.988, Speaker E: Right.
00:48:13.146 - 00:48:45.920, Speaker A: Given where the venture market is, I think Meltham said, tweeted this out yesterday, but what she said was ultimately that VC's are seeing how much valuation has gone up last cycle and theyre bidding up the valuations for the first six months so that they can stop allocating after the first six months of the quote unquote bull market. And it turns out its becoming a self fulfilling prophecy where now valuations are already where, where, where it is at, like in the last half of the bull market. So how do you guys kind of see the venture market today?
00:48:46.072 - 00:49:10.988, Speaker C: There's just so much more money. There's just like a tremendous amount of money. And also, like, a lot of these deals, like, one fund will take the whole thing down. People are just getting crowded out left and right right now. And especially so, like, you may see like a $30 million raise and it's got 25 people on it, but like two guys took 29 of the 30. So it's, I don't know, like, people are scrambling, I think, to, like, deploy. It's like, it's gotten very hard to get into rounds, which is, like, pushing pricing up.
00:49:10.988 - 00:49:17.092, Speaker C: Some of these things are priced too cheap. Like, obviously, if you've got that much, like, demand on it. I don't know if, like, people are.
00:49:17.228 - 00:49:18.188, Speaker E: I don't know if there's, like, a.
00:49:18.236 - 00:49:27.364, Speaker C: Whole, like, really long thought process of it other than just, like, I need to deploy and I can't get access and, like, I got to put it somewhere.
00:49:27.484 - 00:49:27.876, Speaker E: I don't know.
00:49:27.900 - 00:49:34.502, Speaker C: That's, like, sort of where my thought is on the whole thing. There's just a lot of money. There's a lot of venture dollars out there, like, at any given that can deploy.
00:49:34.638 - 00:49:55.950, Speaker D: I mean, you know, time on that, on that point. Like, that's literally our fun thesis overall, right. That there's too many venture dollars in the space. And obviously, most of these people aren't competitive. And obviously most of these people aren't getting tier one deals. Like, I'll get angel allocation into something, right? And I just know, like, I couldn't get size on it. Like, it's the same kind of group of people that will always get the same size.
00:49:55.950 - 00:50:16.070, Speaker D: So it's just. It's like, way more competitive. And brilliance is like, it's logarithmic, right? Like, you're not getting infinite brilliance all the time for some new projects and new protocol. That's groundbreaking. You're getting a lot of c tier projects that are getting insane valuations. It goes back to the same thesis. There are way too many crypto venture dollars pushing way too many, too few deals.
00:50:16.070 - 00:50:42.412, Speaker D: I think it has nothing to do with people allocating. Their only job as venture people is to allocate capital and to raise the next fund. We'll see what happens with the 21 vintage, but I think it's going to be pretty bad overall. So we'll see if there's a reshuffling. Ultimately, this is why we launched a liquid fund as well. So we have that. It's literally a trade embedded in the fund that we think ventures is not going to do nearly as well as liquid will risk adjusted going forward.
00:50:42.412 - 00:51:33.838, Speaker D: Rob Haddock from Dragonfly put out a pretty good tweet thread on this, but he really just highlights all of the kind of issues that exist both globally and locally in crypto for venture overall. I think it's just like, you're getting, like, the last rounds of the last round to just keep pushing out more dollars. Like, valuations go from 100 to 3 billion within eight, nine months. And I think the last kind of part of the whole problem is also liquidity on these things is now getting even better, which is really weird. So it creates way more misaligned incentives of, like, projects launching at 10 billion that don't have anything on them. But, like, at the same time, when those tokens become liquid on market, like, you'll see some pretty nasty flushes. Right? This is also why altcoin open interest is so high relative to last cycles.
00:51:33.838 - 00:51:36.494, Speaker D: We are way, way, way, way beyond.
00:51:36.654 - 00:51:38.062, Speaker E: What we should be in terms of.
00:51:38.078 - 00:52:05.424, Speaker D: Like, altcoin open interest for perpetuals. Because people are, like, now speculating on all these tokens that basically have one in ten, right, one, like, sorry, ten in 100, right. Like, 10% of, you know, FDB is circulating. So now you're getting, like, a really, really, you know, skewed circulating to fdv ratio, which just causes people to short and speculate and all this garbage. But ultimately, it just creates, like, a lot of systemic risk that eventually will come to roost. But we're probably not there yet.
00:52:05.544 - 00:52:18.846, Speaker C: I mean, like, venture is great, right? Like, you put it in and you pray and you don't have mark to market for the most part. It's kind of a great thing to be running in crypto and get, like, long term exposure. It's just like.
00:52:18.990 - 00:52:19.662, Speaker E: Like I said, though.
00:52:19.678 - 00:52:22.302, Speaker C: But it's been, like, there's just a lot of money, like, continuing to do it.
00:52:22.398 - 00:52:25.910, Speaker D: Don't let him psyops you into raising a venture fund, kids. Please don't.
00:52:26.022 - 00:52:27.430, Speaker C: I don't think you should raise any funds.
00:52:27.502 - 00:52:27.734, Speaker D: Correct.
00:52:27.774 - 00:52:30.334, Speaker C: That's always been. I've always told people that for my life.
00:52:30.454 - 00:52:31.038, Speaker E: Correct.
00:52:31.166 - 00:52:35.246, Speaker D: But more seriously, you're not going to get the deals that Dan was getting, so please do.
00:52:35.310 - 00:52:41.112, Speaker C: I don't get the deals. I'm not, like, in the. I'm not in the right information flow.
00:52:41.248 - 00:52:43.764, Speaker D: You're not getting the deals that Imran's getting, that's for sure.
00:52:44.584 - 00:52:47.240, Speaker C: I actually think that's going to get a lot worse, for what it's worth.
00:52:47.312 - 00:52:48.296, Speaker D: Yeah, I agree.
00:52:48.440 - 00:52:57.324, Speaker A: I mean, it's pretty bad billion dollar valuations, but for, at least for AI and bitcoin infrastructure projects and modular.
00:52:57.624 - 00:53:00.216, Speaker D: And modular, which is like, the three hottest sector.
00:53:00.400 - 00:53:00.880, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:53:00.952 - 00:53:02.204, Speaker B: The three horsemen.
00:53:02.984 - 00:53:07.490, Speaker D: When we're launching our new project, guys, I feel like we could do kol. We'll be the Kol for ourselves.
00:53:07.672 - 00:53:11.678, Speaker A: Ordinals. Are you guys trading ordinals or buying ordinals?
00:53:11.806 - 00:53:21.382, Speaker C: We have. Yeah, but I wouldn't say it's like a ton we like. No, I would not say it's like a core thing. We don't. But, like, we have, like, here and there.
00:53:21.518 - 00:53:24.670, Speaker A: Any favorite projects that you like that if you want to name them?
00:53:24.822 - 00:53:25.766, Speaker E: Oh, I'd have to get the guy.
00:53:25.790 - 00:53:28.182, Speaker C: Who, like, handles it. I'm, like, pretty out of the weeds on it.
00:53:28.198 - 00:53:30.274, Speaker E: Okay, how about you here?
00:53:30.654 - 00:53:33.828, Speaker D: Are you talking about, like, on ordinals in particular or anything in general?
00:53:34.006 - 00:53:42.744, Speaker A: I mean, general, like any maybe ordinals, NFT, like anything that you're seeing that. That you're excited about, obviously. Like, if you look at NFTs, they're down only.
00:53:42.904 - 00:54:14.236, Speaker D: Yeah, I'm a cursed NFT trader, so I will simply not touch nfTs. I will buy the index. I will be the index buyer of NFTs and blur and already and whatever else. But I think, you know, overall, there's been a few projects that are, like, more adjacent to, like, core l one s. Like, butterflies have been really interesting that we've been paying attention to. And then also thala as well on Aptos has been really interesting. Yeah, those two, I think, are just like, just great teams.
00:54:14.236 - 00:54:38.634, Speaker D: And, like, again, like, that's kind of what we focus on internally. So we just focus on teams that, like, people overlook or don't have a mandate for, and we focus and see if we can, you know, help them out and push them to a spot where, like, they're, like, literally making money, which might be bearish, actually, but they're literally making money and, like, doing really well and things are growing in the right direction. But I think once the zeitgeist catches up, then different ballgame.
00:54:39.014 - 00:54:44.794, Speaker A: All right, this was a good chat. Any, any final comments, thoughts on the market?
00:54:45.814 - 00:54:46.350, Speaker E: Maybe?
00:54:46.422 - 00:54:51.274, Speaker A: I guess, Dan, you've tweeted this before about the speculative ball of fire.
00:54:51.734 - 00:54:52.954, Speaker C: Hot ball of money.
00:54:53.494 - 00:54:54.054, Speaker A: There you go.
00:54:54.094 - 00:54:55.790, Speaker C: Fuck you, little ball of fire.
00:54:55.902 - 00:55:02.314, Speaker D: Oh, my God. It's literally never been more over for this podcast.
00:55:02.394 - 00:55:03.574, Speaker E: Holy shit.
00:55:04.474 - 00:55:07.714, Speaker C: Oh, no, it's over. Hot ball of fire.
00:55:07.754 - 00:55:08.774, Speaker A: Hot ball of fire.
00:55:09.874 - 00:55:12.774, Speaker C: Hot ball of money. Oh, my God.
00:55:17.114 - 00:55:18.614, Speaker A: We're going to cut this part out.
00:55:19.154 - 00:55:20.866, Speaker D: No, we're running it.
00:55:20.890 - 00:55:21.934, Speaker C: We're running it.
00:55:22.754 - 00:55:24.242, Speaker A: I'm joking. I'm joking.
00:55:24.378 - 00:56:00.514, Speaker C: Yeah, look, I mean, like, I think this is just like, you do see this? I mean, this is like, kind of a consistent behavior of just like, you have gains in, like, one sector, you have money that rotates and it just like, sort of is this, like, wrecking ball that, like, moves around, like, crypto and, like, all different pieces. Like, I think, like, as certain assets just get to a certain size and they're, like, a little more immune to it. But, like, you do still, like, see it, right? Like, there'll be big moves into, like, one corner of the ecosystem. It'll get hot, plateau and then sort of move into the next one. And a lot of what we're doing is, like, looking at, like, where those flows are going. Like, we don't try to predict them more as we like to see them, like, happen, and then, like, we jump in. So we are part of the problem.
00:56:01.694 - 00:56:09.438, Speaker A: I mean, I guess, where would be the next, I guess what's the next sector you look at from where we are today?
00:56:09.566 - 00:56:10.994, Speaker E: Just gotta watch it.
00:56:12.134 - 00:56:23.894, Speaker D: The higher implied volatility in the market goes, the more we have to think about it in this way. Right. Where we literally have to consider how unsustainable the prices of an asset.
00:56:23.934 - 00:56:24.086, Speaker E: Right.
00:56:24.110 - 00:56:39.208, Speaker D: And how nimble we have to be. Right. Obviously, when Solana is at $8, it's a different ballgame, right. You can hold that outright for like, a very long time. But when it's trading like 100 to 140 within like a week and a half, that's just a different game altogether.
00:56:39.376 - 00:56:40.096, Speaker E: Awesome.
00:56:40.240 - 00:56:45.632, Speaker A: Well, thanks for joining. It was a lot of fun chatting with you guys, and we'll have you guys on again.
00:56:45.768 - 00:56:46.936, Speaker D: Maybe we could do like a quarterly.
00:56:46.960 - 00:56:51.984, Speaker A: Macro update on state of things. It'll be fun. We'll do it until we're down only.
00:56:52.024 - 00:56:57.902, Speaker D: Again, and then get us off when we're all bearish circles.
00:56:57.958 - 00:56:59.394, Speaker C: Maybe there's nothing to talk about.
00:57:00.734 - 00:57:04.954, Speaker D: No, there's plenty to talk about anyway. But nobody wants to hear it.
00:57:05.934 - 00:57:06.782, Speaker C: No one looks.
00:57:06.838 - 00:57:09.254, Speaker A: Go on, Zapper or portfolio manager. Look at the portfolio.
00:57:09.294 - 00:57:13.038, Speaker D: Right? Correct. Anyway, thank you so much, guys.
