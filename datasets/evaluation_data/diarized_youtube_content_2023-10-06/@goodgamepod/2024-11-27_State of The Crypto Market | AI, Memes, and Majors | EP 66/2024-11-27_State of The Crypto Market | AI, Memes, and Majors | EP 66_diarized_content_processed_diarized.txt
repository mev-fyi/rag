00:00:00.320 - 00:00:10.536, Speaker A: Welcome to Good Game. Your no BS insights for crypto founders. So how many years you got left in you? That's the question.
00:00:10.688 - 00:00:16.664, Speaker B: I don't know. I'm. It's not about the money. It's about proving a point.
00:00:16.752 - 00:00:20.440, Speaker A: Yeah, I feel like you have trauma too, but it's a different type of trauma.
00:00:20.600 - 00:00:22.744, Speaker B: I don't have much. I have a little bit trauma.
00:00:22.872 - 00:00:28.500, Speaker A: It's like the trauma, like, remember that video I shared with the. The Asian guy and like, he was.
00:00:30.400 - 00:00:34.088, Speaker B: The trauma I have is. You get a 97 on your exam.
00:00:34.264 - 00:00:34.840, Speaker A: That's what I mean.
00:00:34.880 - 00:00:40.780, Speaker B: Where's the remaining three points? Yeah, every Asian kid has that. It's not real trauma.
00:00:41.200 - 00:00:42.820, Speaker A: I mean, that's what you say.
00:00:45.520 - 00:00:46.712, Speaker B: It is what it is.
00:00:46.816 - 00:00:49.688, Speaker A: Yeah. Looking for your next startup idea in crypto?
00:00:49.784 - 00:00:51.432, Speaker B: Check out our request for startups list.
00:00:51.456 - 00:01:11.250, Speaker A: And get inspired at Alliance XYZ or over slash ideas. Oh, my God. Out of left Curve. We saw the AI agents just blow up with the. With the launch of Goat. We talked a bit about it, I think the past few pods, but I think it. I think we should talk a bit more about it.
00:01:11.250 - 00:01:31.506, Speaker A: You know, there's a. There's quite a few new metas that have launched, and I think AI crypto is becoming. It's forming. A lot of it resembles the Defi Summer, I think Goat being the wifi trade. That's so funny.
00:01:31.618 - 00:01:34.754, Speaker B: That's a good narrative.
00:01:34.882 - 00:02:09.042, Speaker A: It's a good narrative. And then you have Zuribro that launched soon after, and then like a whole host, an AI 6 and Z with. With its old narrative. And now we're starting to see AI agents kind of everywhere. Some of them that reply back to my tweets and some of them that reply to your tweets as well. And then obviously, within alliance, we worked on the first video AI agent that's posting on TikTok as well. So we're starting to see some interesting sectors that are being formed as we speak.
00:02:09.042 - 00:02:33.334, Speaker A: And so I'd love to kind of dive deep into what we think is real, what we think is not, and where we think that the future lies with crypto and AI. You know, with. With Goat. I think it kind of happened by accident. Right. You had True Terminal that launched, and that was with the founder Andre, or the creator Andre, who received a $50,000 grant from Marc Andreessen.
00:02:33.382 - 00:02:35.062, Speaker B: Oh, his name is also Andre.
00:02:35.206 - 00:02:39.862, Speaker A: Yeah. Oh, God. Is it Andre or Andy? I forgot. Hold on.
00:02:39.886 - 00:02:40.790, Speaker B: I think it's Andy.
00:02:40.870 - 00:02:48.940, Speaker A: No, you're right, it's Andy. Oh, his. Yeah, yeah. Sorry, his. His first name is Andy. His last name is like. Yeah, it's Ari.
00:02:48.940 - 00:02:52.460, Speaker A: Yeah. But it would have been nice if it was Andre.
00:02:52.540 - 00:02:53.200, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:02:56.420 - 00:03:44.650, Speaker A: And so he created some concept of infinite back rooms, which is like two LLMs, like talking to each other. And then this creates this like divergent content stream that is then more or less post on Twitter. And then there's obviously improvements to it month over month, but that's kind of like the first iteration of it. And then we had Virtuals, which Virtuals launched its own AI gen platform, which is analogous to a pump fund for AI agents. And its first AI agent, which was Luna, which was kind of like the second meta that formed. The third was ai16z and ai16z, I consider it as a more or less like ai6. It was pretty crazy how it launched, which I think has a lot of lore.
00:03:44.650 - 00:04:41.674, Speaker A: It launched on the Daos fund platform, which was interesting. And the concept is like, could an AI agent start a DAO and then also invest in other AI agents in some shape? So Eliza is a framework that leverages the community, the GitHub repositories of other contributors that are contributing to this open source network of code. And they offer different connectors, prompts and models. And essentially people can build on top of that and they could build agents to start on top of it. But then it can also go into, as Shaw mentioned to me, like hardware devices. He said that he saw people that are working, wearing necklaces, that have these agents that are living or sitting that can start to ingest the code to train the model that it serves. And so we're seeing this kind of like open layer network and that's kind of what we're seeing with AX&Z.
00:04:41.674 - 00:05:28.666, Speaker A: And the last one I'll mention is Zuribro, which is launched by Jeffy and what he launched, essentially it's kind of all of it, right? So he has an agent that sits on Twitter. And apparently I like, based on the content I've seen, is probably one of the higher quality Twitter handles that I'm seeing. It also has it launched a its own music album on Spotify. So it launched and content's pretty good and true. Terminal just launched its own album as well, just recently. So there's this interesting meta around music musician creating music and albums. It just launched its own music AI label, Dao.
00:05:28.666 - 00:06:03.620, Speaker A: So I think it's going to recruit like other humans and musicians to create music, co create music together and like somehow monetize the music. It just. Jeffy just announced yesterday that its Bot is going to play chess 24 hours a day and stream it live on Twitch. I'm sure I'm missing things. Oh, it launched so you could do staking or some sort of like yield farming with, with its token on Kamino. And they just also mentioned that they're going to try to bring Zerebro into life with some sort of video content strategy. So.
00:06:03.620 - 00:06:26.532, Speaker A: So it has that, but it also has a Zero Pay, which is kind of like it's Eliza competitor. And so. And then I guess I'll put one more out there which is just like individual bots that are decently good. AixBT, there's bully and a couple of others that I've seen that are out there. But in a NutShell, that's the AI meta.
00:06:26.676 - 00:06:27.880, Speaker B: Very overwhelming.
00:06:29.420 - 00:06:35.204, Speaker A: It is very overwhelming. But yeah, there's different.
00:06:35.372 - 00:06:43.680, Speaker B: How would you describe. How would you. Okay, so two questions. Number one, how would you describe AI 600 and Z in one sentence?
00:06:45.300 - 00:06:54.508, Speaker A: As of now, I would describe it as a open framework to develop AI agents. That's ELISA or Eliza.
00:06:54.604 - 00:06:55.340, Speaker B: Eliza.
00:06:55.420 - 00:06:56.316, Speaker A: That's right.
00:06:56.468 - 00:07:07.550, Speaker B: Okay, and how would you describe Cerebro in one sentence? Because your description of Zuribro earlier had like 10 different things.
00:07:07.850 - 00:07:58.138, Speaker A: That's exactly right. It's harder for me to explain Zerebro because it does everything almost. So the best way I can explain it, it's a dual strategy, right? It has the Zuri Pay, which has this open network open source framework that allows people to build AI agents. And then the other strategy is they have like a, like a open platform for I would say like AI agent modality, like different modalities of AI agents. So like the easiest way to explain it is different modalities of AI agents that covers a full spectrum of different sectors. So it could be playing video games, it could be launching music, it could be connecting with people on Twitter, et cetera. So it has this kind of like open layer on the, and then on the back end.
00:07:58.138 - 00:08:40.646, Speaker A: So front end is that the back end is this Eliza network called Zero Pay and, and, and, and AI6. It's probably going similar in that nature which has this Eliza network and it now has a. Some AI agents that sit on top of the Eliza network and, and, and, and so like they're taking to me like a more of an open source route where these AI agents are launched by other people that leverages Eliza network and then part of the AI agents that launch part of their tokens go to the AI16Z Dao. So really AI16Z Dao monetizes through all the agents that launch on the Eliza network. So it's a little bit different, but I said they're like the comps to each other.
00:08:40.798 - 00:08:43.130, Speaker B: Okay. What's real and what's.
00:08:43.550 - 00:08:58.608, Speaker A: That's exactly where I want to. Want to get to. And then we obviously have other, like, individual agents. AI xpt, which I think is pretty. Like, I was reading through the content. It's not bad. It's pretty good.
00:08:58.664 - 00:09:02.368, Speaker B: You know, I, I blocked Luna. She's. She's in my replies.
00:09:02.464 - 00:09:02.880, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:09:02.960 - 00:09:07.136, Speaker B: She's for every single one of my tweets. And she's kind of boring, to be honest.
00:09:07.248 - 00:09:18.762, Speaker A: Yeah. Zuri bro is okay. It's good. Not, it's not amazing. Like, it's not human. So, like, Zuribro, do they do, do.
00:09:18.786 - 00:09:20.266, Speaker B: They reply guide people?
00:09:20.418 - 00:09:45.040, Speaker A: They do. It does, but it's not bad. It's okay. Like, I, I, I don't have anything negative to say about it, but I think it'd be improved on. AIXVT is like kol. So, like, it'll tell you where the quote unquote alpha is, which I thought was fun. So, like, it started shilling Tao recently.
00:09:48.700 - 00:09:54.388, Speaker B: Barry Silbert leading push into decentralized AI infrastructure. Tao subnet registration.
00:09:54.564 - 00:10:04.548, Speaker A: Peanut writing, viral momentum plus Elon tweets. Clear path to 100 million market cap based on current meme Coin Dynamics entry. Now, before normies catch on, that's one of the tweets.
00:10:04.644 - 00:10:06.440, Speaker B: Does AI XPT have a token?
00:10:06.860 - 00:10:08.916, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, people.
00:10:09.068 - 00:10:20.868, Speaker B: Because otherwise this content can get, like, regurgitated. No, no. Like, all this content, like, these tweets are pretty mid and yet they have, like, 200 likes.
00:10:21.044 - 00:10:22.280, Speaker A: People love the shit.
00:10:23.340 - 00:10:25.876, Speaker B: No, it's the token holders that share the shit.
00:10:25.988 - 00:10:47.598, Speaker A: What I meant by. Well, here's what I mean. I think you're absolutely right. It's mid, but it also is the average kol. This is like how the average kol talks. That. So what I'm getting at with this is it's already, like, starting to replace the D and F tier kols.
00:10:47.774 - 00:10:49.118, Speaker B: Which tier are you?
00:10:49.254 - 00:10:50.510, Speaker A: I'm not a kol.
00:10:50.670 - 00:10:51.438, Speaker B: Yes, you are.
00:10:51.494 - 00:10:55.890, Speaker A: No, I'm not. You're a kol. Yeah.
00:10:56.550 - 00:11:02.254, Speaker B: I always see you in the tier list with other KOLs.
00:11:02.382 - 00:11:03.384, Speaker A: I guess. Yeah.
00:11:03.432 - 00:11:18.568, Speaker B: Like, there are some funny ones. Like. Yeah, I don't remember. There are some really, like, mildly racist and sexist kol tier lists that you're part of.
00:11:18.704 - 00:11:49.040, Speaker A: Yeah. I don't know. Yeah. Anyway, but either way, I think it's replacing the F and D and F Tier ks and people are excited about that, which. Which to me is an improvement. I. I'd rather have a bot than some, you know, scammer that's trying to take advantage of people, you know what I mean? So you have AI xbt and then we also have slop, right? And to me, slop is interesting because it's one of the first video AI agents.
00:11:49.040 - 00:12:42.092, Speaker A: But more importantly, if you think about everyone's strategy, it's funny when you mention it earlier, you're like, wait, wait, what the hell does all of these do? And do they do everything? You know, it was quite overwhelming for you, wasn't it? The way you'd want to think about Slopada is it's embracing AI slop, right? The video slop. If you remember the first, like, Sora video, it was Will Smith eating spaghetti, but it was like, really up, right? And so it's embracing the slop. It almost to me, like, it's. It's like AI unique AI art, which is like human, right? Like, it's almost like human in that sense. Like, it can make mistakes, and then the mistakes that it makes is kind of the beauty and the creation of the art, right? And so it's embracing that. And it's also. You'd want to think about it as a singular strategy.
00:12:42.092 - 00:13:21.648, Speaker A: It's a singular strategy. And the singular strategy is, can we make one video AI agent become an influencer on TikTok? That's it. And there's some interesting ways we could do that. But if it could do that, if it could become successful in getting a hundred thousand followers or million followers, then people are going to be much more open to interacting with this video influencer because they may have a shot at regurgitating its content and being able to say it to a million followers, right? And there's a really big incentive for that. And so to me it seems like. And like, I'm not trying to shill our bags, but I'm also saying.
00:13:21.704 - 00:13:22.620, Speaker B: But you are.
00:13:22.920 - 00:14:06.268, Speaker A: I don't know, I. Look, look, we have bags in everything that we talked about, right? Goat, AI6 and Z, Zeribro. I mean, to me, like, I think they're all. They could all win, right? This market's new, so I'm not saying, like, like they could all win. So I don't think, like, the sector is so new right now, it could carve out its own sectors and spaces. I don't know where that's going right now, but that's kind of where it's at. But like with Slop I think you'd want to think about it as a singular focus that will try to get the attention of the masses through retail and then be able to have enough incentive for users to be able to interact with it in the hopes that they could get shilled by a million followers.
00:14:06.268 - 00:14:09.412, Speaker A: So there you go. That's all of it in a nutshell.
00:14:09.556 - 00:14:25.920, Speaker B: Hey, you know what I was thinking while you were talking about all of this? It reminded me of a clip of Chamab recently talking about his version of Web1, Web2, Web3. For us, the Web1 2, 3 is basically read, write, own, Right?
00:14:26.220 - 00:14:27.760, Speaker A: That's not our take.
00:14:28.460 - 00:15:02.168, Speaker B: That's not our take, but that's the web3 take. But anyway, that aside, Chamath had a view that quote, unquote, Web one was. So there has been two waves of really big Internet companies so far. The first wave was epitomized by Google, these non social huge companies. And then the second wave was the social companies like Facebook. And then the next question is, what's going to be the next wave of billion dollar or even trillion dollar companies? And his take is that it's not going to be companies, it's going to be creators.
00:15:02.264 - 00:15:03.000, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:03.160 - 00:15:14.088, Speaker B: And we're starting seeing the early innings of that with like, you know, all these podcasters, like Joe Rogan and stuff. Joe Rogan's like his podcast probably worth. He sold it for what, like 200, 400 mil to.
00:15:14.144 - 00:15:19.240, Speaker A: I think, I don't think he sold it, but I think that's the licensing rights with Spotify.
00:15:19.320 - 00:15:29.634, Speaker B: Okay. But I think his audience is like, if Joe Rogan was a brand and had a company, it would probably be worth at least a billion, right?
00:15:29.722 - 00:15:30.114, Speaker A: Sure.
00:15:30.202 - 00:15:30.802, Speaker B: Would you say that?
00:15:30.826 - 00:15:31.282, Speaker A: Absolutely.
00:15:31.346 - 00:15:44.098, Speaker B: So we're seeing the early signs of that, but then I was thinking, how do you create some of the most powerful creators at scale? And maybe it's AI agents, maybe it's the AI creators.
00:15:44.194 - 00:15:46.914, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, if you think about, you.
00:15:46.922 - 00:16:18.514, Speaker B: Know, there's a bunch of reasons why you could, why it could be AI agents being the next wave of billion dollar creators. They're tireless, they don't need to sleep, they can always put out content, you can always improve them, you can always train them, fine tune them. It takes a much longer time for humans to become good at something. You're either born with it, or it takes like 30 years or something to become a really good creator. But AI agents, you can train them, fine tune them at scale.
00:16:18.642 - 00:16:46.948, Speaker A: Couple thoughts there. I mean, we're already, you and I are Already hitting our breaking point of mentoring startups right within alliance. Not saying that there's ceiling for it, but you know, I could see ways where, you know, maybe some of the repetitive questions could be answered by a Chow LLM as an example. So you can see that already. And another thought I had was I kind of see AI agents as deep in projects.
00:16:47.124 - 00:16:47.988, Speaker B: Okay.
00:16:48.164 - 00:17:36.915, Speaker A: And the way I see them is, you know, people are, you know, creators will be or when these AI agents are launched, people are incentivized to interact with them because they may, I think over time we're going to see some sort of incentive model come into place where when people interact with these agents they may get a reward for it. And what the agents want in and itself is like unique data. Right. Because that's what they're ultimately the reason why AI agents get better over time is obviously with the data that it collects. So I could see a model where like these AI agents are really just like deep in projects, packages agents and they're going to collect data and if they get enough unique data, then they get rewarded for that data that they collect. And for them what they get is like a robust like model. Right.
00:17:36.915 - 00:17:46.988, Speaker A: Based on the data. And they kind of scroll through the Internet talking to as many people as possible, but really all they're doing is collecting data. What do you think?
00:17:47.124 - 00:17:49.760, Speaker B: Interesting. I never thought of it, but it's interesting.
00:17:50.420 - 00:18:18.442, Speaker A: And I think that's kind of where we're going to be quite frank. These agents are being deployed. Token is an incentive and I think it's going to have reflexive because it has a token. It has reflexive abilities to be able to capture more data than the competitors. And eventually I think these platforms may or may have to kill bots or limit bot interactions on these platforms because it's just another vector of extracting data.
00:18:18.626 - 00:18:24.282, Speaker B: I think we need a new type of social apps where AI agents are first class citizens.
00:18:24.346 - 00:18:30.522, Speaker A: Yes, 100%. I think we're going to get kicked out eventually once people start catching on.
00:18:30.706 - 00:18:58.346, Speaker B: Actually, I think we need two, two new types of social apps. One where the AI is first class citizen and another type is where there is no AI, it's only humans. So you have to go to either of the two extremes. Right now all the social apps are sort of stuck in the middle. Like you go on Twitter, there's a bunch of bots. They're neither first class citizens nor do you have the certainty that everyone you're talking to on Twitter is human.
00:18:58.468 - 00:19:05.118, Speaker A: Yeah, well at least on Twitter you could see for the most part, who's a bot and who's not a bot. Right. It has the automated signal.
00:19:05.214 - 00:19:06.670, Speaker B: Oh, it has that now. Yeah.
00:19:06.830 - 00:19:22.654, Speaker A: But that's not for all bots. Some bots still have to be manually curated or tweets have to be manually curated because the API or something just. It's not very helpful. Like, even with TikTok, you know, it's very hard to automate posting, so that has to be done manually at the moment.
00:19:22.702 - 00:19:34.872, Speaker B: Also, also with cloud computer use, you can just automate an AI without using the Twitter API. You can just use cloud to automate the mouse clicks.
00:19:34.936 - 00:19:59.458, Speaker A: Yeah. So, yeah, I mean, we're entering, I think, a very interesting time where these agents are just the inflow of agents that we're seeing. The crypto enabled agents that we're seeing is like P100Xing. Like, it's just the amount of startups and AM projects that are obviously applying to our program or reaching out. We're seeing so many across the spectrum right now.
00:19:59.514 - 00:20:03.458, Speaker B: Every other application has the word AI in it.
00:20:03.594 - 00:20:19.200, Speaker A: Yeah. So let's break it down. What's real, what's not real? Like what or what are you most excited about of all the agents that I've mentioned to you, what sticks out to you?
00:20:20.540 - 00:20:39.828, Speaker B: I don't actually have an opinion on all of these that exist today. I think they can all either be very wildly successful or go to shit. But there's one thing I want to see someone build. It is I remember all these social token experiments we've had in the last few years.
00:20:39.884 - 00:20:42.708, Speaker A: Starting like crater tokens.
00:20:42.724 - 00:20:48.467, Speaker B: Right, Crater tokens. Starting with that thing on bitcoin. What's it called again? BitCloud.
00:20:48.620 - 00:20:49.308, Speaker A: BitCloud.
00:20:49.404 - 00:21:17.286, Speaker B: Remember, one of the things that I learned is that a lot of the creators don't actually want a token associated with them. I think that's actually one of the biggest impediments to this whole experiment with social tokens. I actually don't want an official token associated with Mint. I think you did well. Someone created without my permission. I don't want it associated with me. I don't want to create one for myself.
00:21:17.286 - 00:21:19.926, Speaker B: But AI agents don't care.
00:21:20.078 - 00:21:24.102, Speaker A: So you'd be okay with a AI agent Chow with the token?
00:21:24.246 - 00:21:31.094, Speaker B: Yeah, because it's not officially me, it's someone created an LLM in my image and launched a token that's the same.
00:21:31.102 - 00:21:31.926, Speaker A: Thing as a meme coin.
00:21:31.958 - 00:21:37.250, Speaker B: No, yeah, exactly, but it is a meme coin. But that LLM can.
00:21:38.050 - 00:21:44.890, Speaker A: But you would have to endorse it. Some way. Right? Wait, so you'd expect someone to scrape your data and then.
00:21:44.930 - 00:21:46.154, Speaker B: Yeah, someone's gonna scrape my Twitter.
00:21:46.202 - 00:21:49.270, Speaker A: But then isn't that like. Don't you want value out of it though? Like.
00:21:49.970 - 00:22:02.026, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, if. So if that. If that LLM that was created in my image is starting to generate revenue from the trading fees and if it's a lot of money, yeah, I might claim it.
00:22:02.178 - 00:22:19.136, Speaker A: So then here's the other question then. Would that be the go to market in that sense? Could you see that as a go to market where it scrapes all the public data of Chao and then it, you know, ingest it and then it creates a model and then it just.
00:22:19.288 - 00:22:23.620, Speaker B: Yeah. Didn't we already see one with Digent Spartan?
00:22:24.120 - 00:22:26.496, Speaker A: Yeah, that's through the Eliza framework.
00:22:26.688 - 00:22:30.540, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. So we're starting to see signs of that.
00:22:31.770 - 00:22:32.690, Speaker A: Yeah, we're starting to.
00:22:32.730 - 00:22:39.826, Speaker B: The most fun part is you revive the people who left Twitter or are in bed, such as Theodore and Spartan.
00:22:39.938 - 00:22:59.990, Speaker A: Yeah, the ones revive the ones that left or died. I didn't want to put it that way, but that's the way I could see it work really well. So now let's talk about where we think we should go with AI Crypto. What areas do we want to see? What areas should we explore?
00:23:00.150 - 00:23:05.254, Speaker B: I just talked about one that I want to see. The celeb Token Creator Token.
00:23:05.382 - 00:23:17.942, Speaker A: What else? I could see games with LLMs. In fact, we have one startup, right, that's working on this.
00:23:18.046 - 00:23:18.930, Speaker B: Which one?
00:23:20.190 - 00:23:21.094, Speaker A: Amahan.
00:23:21.222 - 00:23:22.870, Speaker B: Oh, yeah.
00:23:23.030 - 00:23:59.744, Speaker A: And essentially it's called Farm Friends, where you can grow, feed, harvest farms and pets and things like that. Or animals. Sorry. And think of these animals as like individual LLMs, right? They'll have its own, like, personality characteristics. And essentially you can like, over time, bet on them more or less. But I do think in the future, like a perfect example of this is like Zerbros bot that they're about to launch or just launched that's playing chess. Like these, these guys are going to.
00:23:59.744 - 00:24:20.328, Speaker A: These bots play 24 7. Right. And ultimately what you could do is say like, oh, well, I want to see a Zbro bot battle against the AI16Z Eliza's bot. And obviously there's two big communities that are. That want to see their team win. Right. And I could see that stuff like that playing out.
00:24:20.328 - 00:24:39.416, Speaker A: So ultimately it's like you're betting on. So if AI agents become like celebrities, right, as an example, I would definitely want to see my celebrity, the token that I'm holding, compete against other celebrities. That's holding their tokens and see who wins. I could see stuff like that reminds.
00:24:39.448 - 00:24:43.860, Speaker B: Me of the, of the sperm race competition that I showed you yesterday.
00:24:43.940 - 00:24:45.620, Speaker A: Oh yeah? Yeah. Why don't you talk about that?
00:24:45.740 - 00:25:19.710, Speaker B: So that one has nothing to do with AI. There's this guy who wants to build a sperm race. So instead of horse racing, sperm race between two celebrities. So the first one I might be. Maybe I shouldn't be talking about this because they're still working on it. Their first go to market is going to be two big crypto Twitter celebrities, the household names. And they want them to basically compete on how fast the sperm can swim towards the egg.
00:25:19.710 - 00:25:38.226, Speaker B: Actually, in this case they don't have an egg because there's no women in crypto. But they use progesterone to simulate eggs because the sperm will swim towards the progesterone and people can bet on whose sperm swims faster than the other.
00:25:38.298 - 00:25:39.390, Speaker A: Oh, this is great.
00:25:40.170 - 00:25:41.150, Speaker B: I love it.
00:25:43.130 - 00:25:44.470, Speaker A: This is great stuff.
00:25:44.810 - 00:25:49.682, Speaker B: Another product that I showed you is the AI one.
00:25:49.786 - 00:25:52.590, Speaker A: Yes, talk about that one.
00:25:54.730 - 00:26:14.990, Speaker B: So there's an AI and you try to talk to the AI but in order to talk to the AI, you need to spend a little bit of money for every message. And that money that you spend goes to the treasury or the pocket that the AI owns. And your goal as a player is to convince the AI to give you that money in the treasury.
00:26:15.150 - 00:26:38.430, Speaker A: That's so cool. It's almost like, it's kind of like playing the lottery. But you have to. It's like a lottery, a jigsaw puzzle, some sort of blend of both where, you know, try to figure out how to get the money out by getting clues from the AI agent. And over time, you know, people that play it and win it, they get this bounty or this reward.
00:26:38.770 - 00:26:40.874, Speaker B: You try to hack the LLM, basically.
00:26:41.002 - 00:26:41.882, Speaker A: I think that's cool.
00:26:41.946 - 00:26:42.954, Speaker B: It's really cool.
00:26:43.082 - 00:26:56.770, Speaker A: I mean, I don't know the crypto in it. Maybe it's the payments, but it's the payment. But it's crazy. The amount of high quality AI engineers that are coming to crypto now, it's actually mind boggling.
00:26:59.590 - 00:27:23.940, Speaker B: It all started with Truth Terminal basically, because before Truth Terminal it was all AI infra, AI crypto infra, which to be honest, most of which does not make sense to me. And that community was pretty niche. But ever since Truth Terminal and Goat, we start to see some AI people that are AI native that are coming to crypto.
00:27:24.100 - 00:27:32.404, Speaker A: I'm excited. There's a lot of cool things that we haven't explored yet between AI crypto, mostly on the consumer side that I'm excited about.
00:27:32.572 - 00:27:43.680, Speaker B: Oh, there's that one Tomorrow News where you predict tomorrow's deadline on the New York Times.
00:27:45.180 - 00:27:46.004, Speaker A: Sorry, go ahead.
00:27:46.092 - 00:28:08.110, Speaker B: So as a user, you type in, your input is a headline that you want to predict and then they will use AI to find the best match between the input of the users and the actual headline from the New York Times. And whoever is the closest to the actual headlines wins the pot. That one's also really cool.
00:28:08.190 - 00:28:49.040, Speaker A: Yeah, I think we're just scratching the surface area on what AI crypto enabled products are going to look like. Yeah, yeah, I think like, okay, there's two versions of AI bots that I see. I see AI Enterprise, AI consumer, AI Enterprise has to be tokenless. It cannot have a token. It has to be federated, it has to have security, it has to be verticalized. I mean like all the things that, that companies, enterprises are looking for is what it's going to be. Then the AI consumer side or the app side is where you could do whatever you want, right.
00:28:49.040 - 00:29:14.190, Speaker A: And so you can attach a token to it. You could use token as a go to market strategy. You could use token as a way to incentivize data collection. And so that's kind of the way I see it. Right? There's like two verticals of this. But what's also interesting is the fact that Enterprise before, like I spent some time in Enterprise, hated it with every minute of my life that was in it at Microsoft. Yeah, yeah.
00:29:14.190 - 00:30:18.286, Speaker A: And I know it was Boomer, but I mean it was when Satya took over. And so like I learned a lot from, from him and the group. But what's interesting is one of the lessons that we learned in those days was the fact that Enterprise was like Teflon coded, meaning, like it's very hard for upstarts to crack enterprise because of all the enterprise level agreements that come into place. And so no one, like a lot of these enterprise companies, like, fuck it, I'm going to stick with this enterprise product because it's cheap and I have access of software across my servers all the way down to cloud and Office365 and all this other garbage. But what Zoom did, and Zoom was the first to do this, which was to get a video product that's so good that retail used it. And when they used the product, naturally a lot of those retail people were also enterprise users. And so then Zoom was the first to create this bottoms up approach in enterprise, which there were so many Zoom users.
00:30:18.286 - 00:30:21.090, Speaker A: That it convinced a lot of enterprises to switch to Zoom.
00:30:23.590 - 00:30:41.054, Speaker B: That was exactly what happened in the early days of Masari. That was 20. In 2017, I heard about Zoom for the first time. I was like, what the fuck is this? Why don't we just use Google Hangout? And it was basically people who used Zoom before, individually as consumers that tried to convince the company to use it.
00:30:41.142 - 00:31:15.076, Speaker A: Yep. So Zoom was one, Chrome was the other. Right. With the Chrome browser, then Chromebooks and Google like worksheets or whatever. So like this bottoms up approach is a new strategy in enterprise. So the enterprise companies are now hyper aware of this situation, which is why they're giving half their products for free now to retail users. So I guess long story short is there could be a world where maybe AI bots, the consumer plays the right play and eventually this stuff could bubble up to enterprise.
00:31:15.076 - 00:31:22.120, Speaker A: Who knows? I don't know. So that's kind of the gameplay that I see for AI.
00:31:22.960 - 00:31:27.368, Speaker B: Hey, do you feel the cycle is different from last time?
00:31:27.504 - 00:31:40.460, Speaker A: I do. I thought at first it was Meme coins with Defi Summer. Well, with Defi Summer we also had NFTs. So there was like two concurrent metas.
00:31:40.880 - 00:31:47.326, Speaker B: Not concurrent, it's NFTs. It was DeFi then NFTs. It wasn't concurrent.
00:31:47.488 - 00:32:04.994, Speaker A: Yes and yes and no. Like it did happen right after. But like if you had, if you were in Defi around. Yeah. So around like as Defi was going up, if you were buying NFTs, that was the time to buy NFTs is what I'm saying. And then it shot up six months after. Right.
00:32:04.994 - 00:32:21.262, Speaker A: So yeah. So I guess it's not like it happened soon after Defi. That's right. But the time to buy was during Defi Summer in this case. I feel as if there's multiple metas that are starting. Right. So we had the Meme Coin meta speculation.
00:32:21.262 - 00:32:49.594, Speaker A: Meme coin meta. We just are starting to enter the AI meta, which is I think much larger than the. It could be as big as the Meme Coin meta. And then I also see this decentralized science meta that's starting to form as well. And I guess where is ultimately, I think now that the final boss is here and we, I think defeated the final boss, I think everything is up for grabs. Everything. I think we're going to see every meta at least being tried once.
00:32:49.762 - 00:32:59.338, Speaker B: I just feel like bitcoin is almost 50% above the previous all time high and yet there isn't much euphoria.
00:32:59.514 - 00:33:01.914, Speaker A: Euphoria in what sense? The timeline Timeline.
00:33:01.962 - 00:33:20.580, Speaker B: And also alts are not really pumping like last time. Last time, once bitcoin was over 20k alts. Like, it took maybe a couple more weeks of bitcoin dominance before alts started really pumping across the board. But this time it doesn't feel like it's really happening.
00:33:20.740 - 00:33:29.620, Speaker A: Yeah, the Maraud narrative died out pretty quickly. Yeah. So when you say alts, do you just mean alts or do you mean memes and alts?
00:33:29.700 - 00:33:33.000, Speaker B: No, I don't mean memes. I mean the exchange listed.
00:33:33.390 - 00:33:48.182, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah, there hasn't been much movement in there. Do you think that's because a lot of it's going into the near metas? Because we also had the traditional Cardano xrp. They all shot up.
00:33:48.286 - 00:33:55.650, Speaker B: Yeah, they shot up a little bit, but not like as crazy as last cycle. Maybe it's still early. I don't know. It does feel a little bit different.
00:33:57.630 - 00:34:21.994, Speaker A: So it was funny. I spent some time with people outside of crypto, and crypto is being brought up every time. Now people are bringing it up like, oh, wow, like I just bought Bonk as an example or someone told me about Bonk a couple, like six months ago. So to me, it seems like retail's already. Like a lot of the retail is already, at least in the US Maybe is in crypto already.
00:34:22.162 - 00:34:22.990, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:34:23.330 - 00:34:31.510, Speaker A: And they're just, I think, getting. I think the metas, they're more closer to the metas than we think, I think.
00:34:31.550 - 00:34:41.574, Speaker B: I feel like. So last week, Phantom went to like number six on App Store. And Moonshot.
00:34:41.702 - 00:34:49.890, Speaker A: Moonshot was number, like, I don't know, like 20 or something in the utilities app. They had 30 downloads every minute, which is.
00:34:50.190 - 00:34:57.284, Speaker B: Phantom was well above Coinbase. And what that tells me is that retail went straight on chain.
00:34:57.412 - 00:35:01.220, Speaker A: Straight on chain between Fantom and Moonshot. They went straight on chain.
00:35:01.300 - 00:35:06.868, Speaker B: Yeah. Maybe that's why the exchange listed alts aren't pumping.
00:35:07.044 - 00:35:16.720, Speaker A: They're not. I don't think it matters as much anymore. And really, I think exchange listings are exit liquidity for everyone.
00:35:17.100 - 00:35:17.764, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:35:17.892 - 00:35:50.402, Speaker A: For the most part, which is why I think Binance and others are on Twitter. The meta now is that Binance and other exchanges are going after 40, 50 million market cap tokens to force retail to not go on chain and go directly through the exchange. Right. Because they still have that branding power. So if they can list 40, $50 million tokens, then obviously there's like a 5 to 10x. I mean, even if you look at Peanut as an example, Peanut went from like 0 to almost 2 billion in FTV now it's sitting around 1.
00:35:50.596 - 00:35:55.730, Speaker B: So yeah, that was the biggest miss over the last two. Over the last four weeks.
00:35:56.190 - 00:35:57.290, Speaker A: Does it hurt?
00:35:57.710 - 00:35:58.710, Speaker B: A little bit.
00:35:58.830 - 00:36:01.382, Speaker A: I mean, we caught goat. Goat was a pretty good one.
00:36:01.486 - 00:36:02.250, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:36:02.910 - 00:36:04.930, Speaker A: I think chill guy is gonna be another one.
00:36:05.790 - 00:36:09.574, Speaker B: You think the meta is gonna go on the TikTok meta?
00:36:09.702 - 00:36:22.334, Speaker A: I think so. I think TikTok meta is gonna be strong. Everyone is fading it because they're like, oh yeah, TikTok. It's like a bunch of brain rock content. People are gonna forget about it. You know, TikTok is not brain rot.
00:36:22.382 - 00:36:25.570, Speaker B: At all compared to crypto. Crypto Twitter is brain rot.
00:36:25.990 - 00:36:32.046, Speaker A: Crypto Twitter is brain rot. Holy shit. Like the amount of garbage that I see, it's insane.
00:36:32.238 - 00:36:39.790, Speaker B: I don't see that much. I actually haven't seen any chill guy content on my TikTok feed.
00:36:39.950 - 00:36:42.450, Speaker A: All you have to do is type it once on your phone.
00:36:43.750 - 00:36:46.832, Speaker B: So far what I'm seeing is dogecoin.
00:36:46.966 - 00:37:09.052, Speaker A: Yeah. So it makes sense for the boomers. Yeah. No, I started watching a lot of the newer TikTok content from newer creators or not newer, but like TikTok creators. It's funny. Like a lot of them. Like if you read through the comments of chill guy, especially.
00:37:09.052 - 00:37:37.940, Speaker A: Especially chill guy and which gave me even more conviction of why I think chill guys in me round, I think it's going to be the pepe of our play of our cycles play. When I was reading through the comments, people are like, oh yeah, the price is down 50%, but I'm just a chill guy. I'm just holding. I saw that throughout the. And so there's something there with that narrative of just like, you know, I'm just a chill guy. I'm just gonna. Who cares if it goes down 50%? I'm just gonna keep holding it because I'm a chill guy.
00:37:37.940 - 00:37:53.992, Speaker A: Which gave me more confidence that people are just gonna hold this thing. They don't care that 2 crypto Twitter's fading it. Everyone's fading it. 3 hold account has gone up tremendously. It's a hundred. It surpassed PopCat. It hasn't.
00:37:53.992 - 00:37:57.112, Speaker A: Yeah, let me look at.
00:37:57.216 - 00:37:58.680, Speaker B: It's over from Murad.
00:37:58.840 - 00:38:29.380, Speaker A: Yeah, don't worry. We sold our popcat already. So if you look at our holder scan right now, chill guys at 133,000 holders in a matter of from November 17th through the 26th. That's insane. Peanut is at 65,000, goats at 66,000. Let me look at WIF. Yeah, here WIF.
00:38:29.380 - 00:38:47.810, Speaker A: WIF is at 200,000. Think about that. WIF has been around since November of last year. One year wif is at 203,000 holders. Chill guys at 133,000 holders. And that's only been, you know, 15 days, 20 days and. Holy shit.
00:38:48.710 - 00:38:54.750, Speaker B: Wow. Okay, this is actually really interesting because Chill guy Crypto. Twitter hates Chill guy.
00:38:54.910 - 00:38:55.982, Speaker A: They do.
00:38:56.166 - 00:39:14.880, Speaker B: And TikTok is all about Chill guy. And if you look at the trading volume of Chill Guy, $200 million over the last 24 hours, and guess what? The vast majority of the volume is on radium. It's not on the centralized exchanges. What does that tell you? What does that tell you, Imran?
00:39:15.620 - 00:39:16.812, Speaker A: That's on radium.
00:39:16.956 - 00:39:18.600, Speaker B: Yeah. What does that tell you?
00:39:19.140 - 00:39:20.440, Speaker A: It tells me that.
00:39:21.060 - 00:39:29.340, Speaker B: Exactly. The normies. The normies. Not the crypto, Twitter retail, but the TikTok normies, they are on chain.
00:39:29.500 - 00:39:48.124, Speaker A: And if you look at the. Because it's not listed by any wallet. It's not listed. Chill Guy, I think is going to get listed on Bybit on Tuesday. Oh, today. And outside of that, I don't think they have that. I'm going to check and see Chill Guy token, what exchanges have it, but I don't think any exchanges have it right now.
00:39:48.124 - 00:39:51.276, Speaker A: And so what they're doing right now is. These guys are. Yeah.
00:39:51.308 - 00:39:51.452, Speaker B: So.
00:39:51.476 - 00:39:54.120, Speaker A: Oh, it's now on Bybit. And that's it.
00:39:54.580 - 00:39:58.076, Speaker B: It's on Bybit, but the radium volume is still way higher than Bybit.
00:39:58.108 - 00:40:05.250, Speaker A: Way, way higher. So they're using Moonshot or Phantom to download and buy these tokens.
00:40:05.410 - 00:40:39.676, Speaker B: This is actually the most interesting thing I've seen this week. Okay, so here's a couple of most important things that changed this cycle from last cycle. Last cycle, we actually didn't have a very cheap and fast blockchain. That cycle. It was all about NFTs and DeFi, and these were both whale type of metas because NFTs and DeFi happened on Ethereum layer 1, where the trading fees was extremely high. So the only players were whales. Crypto native whales.
00:40:39.676 - 00:40:54.628, Speaker B: This cycle we have Base and Solana, but mostly Solana. And we also have Phantom, which didn't exist in 2020 yet. I think Phantom started in 2021 and obviously in 2021, Fantom was still early as a product.
00:40:54.724 - 00:40:54.996, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:40:55.028 - 00:41:02.708, Speaker B: But today it works really well. So the combination of these two factors drives normies. The TikTok normies directly on chain.
00:41:02.804 - 00:41:03.396, Speaker A: Yep.
00:41:03.508 - 00:41:16.932, Speaker B: Bypassing the. Okay, so this is actually probably one of the key reasons why this cycle feels different. Like the alts, the. The cent the exchange list. The alts aren't really pumping even after Bitcoin all time high because it's the.
00:41:16.956 - 00:41:31.284, Speaker A: Other way around now. Right. They go straight on getting in retail is getting on chain, they're getting in earlier. Then you have the AI bots that are slowly trying to take over the Kol meta as well. Right. So it'll be very interesting.
00:41:31.332 - 00:42:08.138, Speaker B: Like Moonshot plus Pump is a huge threat to Binance, don't you think? Because one of the key reasons why that made Binance Binance is the fact that in the early days, 2017, 2018, they listed the right tokens which made all their users rich. That's why they've been really careful with token listing. This year has always been the case. But this year you can tell they've been very selective with the token listing because they understand that for Binance they need to make their users rich. It's the same thing as all the crypto protocols.
00:42:08.234 - 00:42:10.790, Speaker A: All the protocols, all the exchanges, everything.
00:42:11.090 - 00:42:21.224, Speaker B: So it's all about listing. And now you have Moonshot and Phantom basically front running do the same work. They front run the listing game.
00:42:21.392 - 00:42:27.208, Speaker A: And what's also interesting is CZ put out a tweet today. Do you see that tweet? I'll read it.
00:42:27.264 - 00:42:31.784, Speaker B: Yeah, he was like, yeah, he hated the meme coins or something like that.
00:42:31.872 - 00:42:33.496, Speaker A: Why do you think he hated the meme coins?
00:42:33.608 - 00:42:37.192, Speaker B: Because it's a big threat to binance business.
00:42:37.376 - 00:43:14.910, Speaker A: Exactly, 100%. And I think he was, I think it was also like a, like a, he was also like talking about Pump. Right. Because I mean of the things over the past few weeks, I feel like he was insinuating between that and all the meme coin stuff that's threat to Binance. But this is not going anywhere and in fact it's going to get, it's going to proliferate even more. So funny enough, I was on a. I told you about this but offline, but I spent a few hours on Pump stream yesterday or like before they turned it off a couple days ago, et cetera.
00:43:14.910 - 00:44:12.686, Speaker A: I was watching one of the streams and it was a, it was a girl and, and she, she was like talking to her audience and she goes, I don't know shit about crypto. I'm just doing this to see if I can get my token to Pump and like she was obviously a good looking girl and like you know, probably onlyfans actor or whatever you want to call it, performer. And you know they're the, the people are like messaging her like do this, do that do this and she's like responding to the, to the people. But the funny, the, the thing that I got out of that, that one specific stream was the fact that you know, there's net new people that are using the product that, that have nothing to do with crypto, which I think is a game changer also. So I do think that, you know, live streams and products like this can in fact onboard new new users to crypto.
00:44:12.798 - 00:44:34.648, Speaker B: I don't even know how to play the rest of the cycle anymore. It's a really complicated cycle. There's a lot of moving parts, there's a lot of different metas. This cycle is way more complicated. Last one, you knew that after bitcoin all time high all the alts would pump and then there was this NFT meta at the same time. Yeah, the cycle is very different. It's very complicated.
00:44:34.744 - 00:44:35.768, Speaker A: It's very complicated.
00:44:35.864 - 00:44:41.688, Speaker B: This cycle you have bitcoin, bitcoin national reserve like Brazil this morning. Brazil, yeah.
00:44:41.704 - 00:44:43.660, Speaker A: Let's talk about this. Yeah, yeah.
00:44:44.000 - 00:44:48.472, Speaker B: Brazil announced their bill to create a bitcoin national reserve.
00:44:48.616 - 00:44:49.656, Speaker A: That's huge.
00:44:49.848 - 00:45:18.496, Speaker B: And then it's not even surprising to me anymore, like every nation state is trying to front run the US to create their own national reserve and obviously the democratic countries they need to pass a bill. But the dictatorships, they're probably buying in secret right now. They're probably accumulating bitcoin right now. Bitcoin is in a super cycle I think. And then the alts are getting disrupted by the on chain stuff and then there is a new meta every week.
00:45:18.648 - 00:45:43.238, Speaker A: I think alts are done for a while. I don't know unless. Because the thing is like the liquid guys are buying it and they're shilling defi and why the defi renaissance? And I love the guys in the defi side but ultimately it's going to be where retail is going to want to go. Right? And I think retail will go. I think retail is pretty much caught up to the trend like maybe a few steps behind.
00:45:43.374 - 00:45:46.556, Speaker B: I think they're ahead of the professionals now.
00:45:46.678 - 00:45:53.696, Speaker A: They're head of the professionals, not the crypto Twitter or there's like a ping pong between the two.
00:45:53.848 - 00:45:57.620, Speaker B: I think crypto Twitter is getting dumped on by the TikTok meta.
00:45:58.040 - 00:45:59.980, Speaker A: That's the first one, right, I think.
00:46:01.560 - 00:46:22.364, Speaker B: And I think there's basically two almost mutually exclusive worlds going on right now. There's the TikTok normies, there's the crypto native retail and then there's the crypto native professionals that are Stuck in the alts. And then there's the nation states which is a completely different game. There's like four games going on right now.
00:46:22.452 - 00:46:29.612, Speaker A: Yeah, so you said. Wait, wait, can you name it again? It's the nation states, the institutions, crypto natives and retail.
00:46:29.756 - 00:46:33.836, Speaker B: The crypto native retail and the TikTok normie retail.
00:46:33.948 - 00:46:41.760, Speaker A: Yeah, okay, yeah, yeah. And then institutions and. But then there's also like crypto natives.
00:46:41.920 - 00:46:44.100, Speaker B: Yeah, that's what I meant. The crypto native retail.
00:46:45.400 - 00:47:19.790, Speaker A: Okay, yeah, so there's about four and there's four moving parts and it just depends on what you want to play. But okay, so let me put that to the side and tell you that a lot of retail that I've spoken to over the past few weeks are still playing these like XRP Cardano Cardano. They're still playing that game. For some reason they stick to it. So I think it's. They're just so familiar with it over the past. Like the lendiness of those tokens and the familiarity of those tokens has its own brand and people are comfortable trading those tokens.
00:47:19.790 - 00:47:38.530, Speaker A: So I think they have some staying power. So yeah, I think Chill guy is. I think it's going to really hurt a lot of crypto natives is the way I see it, which is what I love. I was going to talk to you about something else.
00:47:38.950 - 00:47:42.286, Speaker B: I can't remember getting old, forgetting things.
00:47:42.438 - 00:47:48.910, Speaker A: Fuck you. Oh, what about NFTs? DOA.
00:47:48.990 - 00:47:51.166, Speaker B: I saw punk pumped a little bit.
00:47:51.318 - 00:47:53.050, Speaker A: Punk pumped a little bit.
00:47:53.750 - 00:48:10.446, Speaker B: I think the end of the cycle is actually NFTs pumping because they're the least liquid, the least liquid and they're the most sort of luxury goods. It's like luxury art that you buy once you're rich kind of thing.
00:48:10.598 - 00:48:13.438, Speaker A: And would that be a good indicator for the top.
00:48:13.574 - 00:48:16.670, Speaker B: It could be one of the several top signals.
00:48:16.830 - 00:48:21.006, Speaker A: Hoktua is launching her token. Hayley Welch. I thought that was the top signal.
00:48:21.038 - 00:48:38.024, Speaker B: But I mean it's obviously not fungible or NFT fungible. It's fine. Like the celebrity tokens, I don't see them as a top signal anymore in the cycle. Yeah, celebrities were top signal last cycle. Yeah, the cycle is going to be something different.
00:48:38.192 - 00:48:49.592, Speaker A: It's nation states jumping on each other. I also think that, I don't know, I'm coming closer to the belief that this is our last cycle of making generational wealth.
00:48:49.736 - 00:48:59.786, Speaker B: I think this is the last bitcoin cycle because we now have nation states trying to front run each other. But I also think on chain there should be constantly New metas.
00:48:59.978 - 00:49:23.406, Speaker A: Yeah. So what I mean by the last cycle is I think there will be some. What I call we'll start to see bitcoin. I don't think bitcoin is going to be as. I mean, obviously once it settles after the cycle, I think bitcoin will. Won't be as volatile anymore. It's just my own.
00:49:23.406 - 00:49:50.052, Speaker A: As volatile as it used to be. And I think the volatility will probably go to the tail end of the assets and newer metas probably makes more sense. But eventually, I think the world that we're entering into is tokenizing everything. I think everything in the world is going to be tokenized and is going to create this immense wealth effect. And I think that's kind of the period where we are. It's funny. And the reason why I bring this up is because I was just talking to a founder earlier today.
00:49:50.052 - 00:50:24.384, Speaker A: He applied to our program and he said, hey, man, I want to thank you guys for bringing Pump onto lines and incubating them. I'm like, why? And he goes, well, I turned. I was poor and now I'm rich. I only had $70 to my name or something, and I got it to like a half a million dollars. And now I want to build for crypto. Like, you have those loyalists, right? And so when I heard that, I'm like, huh. I think this is like an outlandish kind of view that I see.
00:50:24.384 - 00:50:55.414, Speaker A: But if the whole world is going to be tokenized, there's immense wealth effect to be had. If every new meme has to be tokenized, every asset has to be tokenized. If you think about the whole world, like real estate, I don't know, anything and everything. If everything's going to be a fungible token at some point that has a representation on chain, there's a lot of stuff that could be tokenized, which means new wealth effect for at least half the population. I won't say the whole population. Somebody has to buy the bag, something like that. It's curious.
00:50:55.414 - 00:50:57.206, Speaker A: I'm just curious. What do you think about that?
00:50:57.278 - 00:50:58.262, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree.
00:50:58.446 - 00:51:01.814, Speaker A: So how many years you got left in you? What's the question? I don't know.
00:51:01.902 - 00:51:07.062, Speaker B: I'm. It's not about the money, it's about proving a point.
00:51:07.166 - 00:51:10.826, Speaker A: Yeah, I feel like you have trauma too, but it's a different type of trauma.
00:51:10.998 - 00:51:13.154, Speaker B: I don't have much. I have a little bit trauma.
00:51:13.282 - 00:51:18.910, Speaker A: It's like the trauma, like, remember that video I shared with the. The Asian guy? And like, he was.
00:51:20.730 - 00:51:24.066, Speaker B: The trauma I have is, you get a 97 on your exam.
00:51:24.098 - 00:51:25.250, Speaker A: Yeah, that's what I mean.
00:51:25.290 - 00:51:32.430, Speaker B: Where's the remaining three points? That's, that's. Yeah, every Asian kid has that. It's not, it's not real trauma. It's. It's just.
00:51:32.810 - 00:51:34.510, Speaker A: I mean, that's what you say.
00:51:37.220 - 00:51:38.332, Speaker B: It is what it is.
00:51:38.436 - 00:51:43.916, Speaker A: Yeah, just chill, man. Just be a chill guy.
00:51:43.948 - 00:51:45.020, Speaker B: Yeah, just be a chill guy.
00:51:45.100 - 00:51:48.668, Speaker A: Be a chill guy. What else is going on?
00:51:48.804 - 00:51:50.732, Speaker B: Oh, I think Doge is going to pump.
00:51:50.876 - 00:51:51.292, Speaker A: Yes.
00:51:51.356 - 00:51:59.980, Speaker B: I think Doge is going to be one of the main. There was a rumor of. There was a screenshot of Twitter with a dollar sign on the app.
00:52:00.100 - 00:52:02.440, Speaker A: Do you see that dollar sign?
00:52:03.300 - 00:52:18.652, Speaker B: There was a button on the. With a dollar sign on the, you know, future version of Twitter. And people are speculating that it's going to be. There's going to be payment within Twitter and. Well, guess what? I think it's going to be Dogecoin.
00:52:18.796 - 00:52:30.516, Speaker A: Fuck. What's your price prediction on Doge? Holy shit. As we were talking about this, Elon tweeted this out.
00:52:30.668 - 00:52:31.680, Speaker B: What do you say?
00:52:33.420 - 00:52:35.108, Speaker A: Take a look. Do you see it?
00:52:35.164 - 00:52:50.980, Speaker B: The dogefuner. I would not be surprised if Doge actually flips Ethereum within the next five years. No one is prepared for that. I'm not predicting it, but I wouldn't be surprised.
00:52:51.060 - 00:53:03.740, Speaker A: Okay, it's at 37 cents. It's a $55 billion market cap. Ethereum. Ethereum's like a 300. You're following it very closely. 400. So that's another 7x.
00:53:03.740 - 00:53:20.176, Speaker A: So that would put the price $2.65 in current market cap value. What's the comeback story for Ethereum? Did you hear about launching Beam, which is going to launch in 2829? What's the comeback story for Ethereum?
00:53:20.208 - 00:53:24.540, Speaker B: The comeback story is based. It's very simple. Yeah, it's base. Do you agree?
00:53:24.920 - 00:53:46.540, Speaker A: I agree. The Ethereum community has been so fragmented across the entire spectrum. It was designed to. Right. Given that Vitalik is like, okay, we're not going to build rollups in house. We're going to just give the specs and we're going to allow builders to build it out to compete or win, whatever. He didn't realize that obviously all the things that are happening today.
00:53:46.540 - 00:54:23.044, Speaker A: And so we had maybe 150 roll ups that came up and I think the winner. And then so everybody was competing for Mindshare, but it seems like more or less things are starting to shift more to base. Like even today, when I saw bankless tweets they're just shilling base. And Clanker and Eric or Anthony, they're all shilling base. So to me it seems like what's happening now is people have to align to one chain. It's easier to sell the narrative and it's easier, obviously, from a messaging perspective for developers. Right.
00:54:23.044 - 00:54:31.348, Speaker A: So I think what Solana has taught the EVM folks is that you need a singular message. And I think Base is the best message, I think.
00:54:31.484 - 00:54:54.956, Speaker B: So here's how I'm thinking about the L2s and the whole landscape. It's no longer possible to differentiate with technology. The only wedge that a new Layer two can have is distribution. And so think about the L2s that actually do have distribution. It's Base with Coinbase and that's pretty much it on Ethereum.
00:54:54.988 - 00:54:56.444, Speaker A: Arbitrum has Defi.
00:54:56.572 - 00:55:00.876, Speaker B: I don't think Arbitrum distribution is nearly as big as Coinbase.
00:55:00.908 - 00:55:01.692, Speaker A: That's correct.
00:55:01.836 - 00:55:23.382, Speaker B: Sony launched their own Layer two. Sonium is actually op side chain. Right. So maybe they have some distribution still early for them. So the trend I'm seeing is I think there's going to be more and more big companies like Sony and Base launching their own chain. Could be in the form of corporate chains. Corporate chains, yeah.
00:55:23.382 - 00:55:38.862, Speaker B: But actually permissionless and open. Just using the corporate as a distribution. The Sonium base, obviously. Binance with bsc. I don't know where that went. I don't think BSC went anywhere. And then there's Tan with Telegram.
00:55:38.862 - 00:55:49.022, Speaker B: I think that's pretty much it. Solana is the only one that was born without distribution. That is really killing it. I think everything else from this point on will need distribution and the only.
00:55:49.046 - 00:55:51.118, Speaker A: Way to get distribution is if you have distribution.
00:55:51.294 - 00:56:07.790, Speaker B: Unfortunately, that is the case. So you have to be an existing big corporation or you build a really good app that has a ton of users. Like, let's say tomorrow Jupyter launches a new Layer one. Yeah, they're going to crush it. They have distribution already.
00:56:08.330 - 00:56:38.716, Speaker A: So I guess the question then becomes, okay, distribution from corporate chains and all of the apps that are built on either Base or Solana could launch your own Layer one or whatever, Layer two. So then it's just going to be like a recursive loop here, right? Do you feel that? So then Jupyter. Let's just say Jupyter launches its own layer one. Then it gets a bunch of builders to build on his product. Then the breakout app will say, fuck it, I'm just going to launch my own Layer one.
00:56:38.868 - 00:56:42.188, Speaker B: It's a recursive loop it's basically the original vision of Cosmos.
00:56:42.364 - 00:57:17.440, Speaker A: Yeah. And so it just becomes this thing where you own the distribution, then you want to own the infrastructure side because then you can monetize end to end. Where does it end? Yeah, it's hard to say. I feel like we're going to see that with AI agents as well. You know, you have zero pay or ZarePay and then you have Eliza, which is already open, open source, like models and code that you could build on top of. And then if you go up to Stack, you have agents that are built on top of these things. Right.
00:57:17.440 - 00:57:49.928, Speaker A: The way I see, agents are also like wallets and apps. Once you own the customer, it's pretty much fair game. So if you own the customer, then you could ultimately go back and build out your own models and keep that data to yourself versus sharing it with others. And so that's kind of the way I see it. And so really I think the game is to own as many users as possible is the way I see it. And then, and then I think what sets different models apart is really the fine tuning. Do you agree with that or no?
00:57:50.064 - 00:57:52.648, Speaker B: What sets what apart? The various agents.
00:57:52.744 - 00:58:18.310, Speaker A: Agents is fine tuning the data and fine tuning. Because if that's the case, I mean, I think everything's gonna be disrupted again. Like I just saw this, this bot today called Bloomy Bloomy or something. Baloney. But either way, it's an agent that you could do all your transactions. Balorny. I think it's.
00:58:18.310 - 00:58:21.410, Speaker A: Ah, here it is. Blormi.
00:58:21.570 - 00:58:24.978, Speaker B: Oh, Blormi is the. Is the guy. Is Jeff's thing as well.
00:58:25.034 - 00:58:52.160, Speaker A: It's Jeff's thing as well, but apparently it's not Jeff's thing, it's Jeff's friend's thing or in the same community. So they just did a big update today or yesterday where. Yeah, it was 18 hours ago. You can now simply type what you want to swap and it will be blormed. Example, I want to swap 100 USDC for USDT. Currently live on Polygon. Are you looking at it? What do you think?
00:58:52.940 - 00:58:57.892, Speaker B: I don't know where this is going. I don't have a thesis. It's the Wild West.
00:58:57.996 - 00:59:17.370, Speaker A: I think we're on the bleeding edge here, ladies and gentlemen. Which means like wallets eventually could be disrupted, apps could be disrupted. I think everything's up in the air right now and I don't think people realize how big this transformation is. We just admitted a startup that's doing this as well.
00:59:17.670 - 00:59:18.650, Speaker B: Which one?
00:59:20.470 - 00:59:21.454, Speaker A: Sphere one.
00:59:21.542 - 00:59:22.730, Speaker B: Oh, Sphere one.
00:59:23.270 - 00:59:51.606, Speaker A: They're live on like over a hundred chains already, but they don't have eight and AI. I mean they have the prompt, but they don't have like a agent quote unquote or what do you call it? Kol ticker. Yeah, but I think they should. And that could compete with Blur me. So this thing is moving really, really fast. Even faster than like the data we're saying is what I'm getting at.
00:59:51.758 - 00:59:55.692, Speaker B: Anything else? Bitcoin super cycle.
00:59:55.836 - 00:59:58.348, Speaker A: Bitcoin super cycle. You said million dollars, right?
00:59:58.484 - 01:00:00.268, Speaker B: 420. 420.
01:00:00.324 - 01:00:03.676, Speaker A: And then maybe $420,000.
01:00:03.788 - 01:00:05.852, Speaker B: Yeah, $420 end of next year.
01:00:05.876 - 01:00:07.484, Speaker A: But really it's 250,000.
01:00:07.652 - 01:00:08.852, Speaker B: No, 420.
01:00:09.037 - 01:00:09.778, Speaker A: 420.
01:00:09.963 - 01:00:17.692, Speaker B: 420 if we get the Bitcoin reserve. Yeah, 420. Why not? Okay. And then five more years until 1 million.
01:00:17.876 - 01:00:23.474, Speaker A: I could dig that. I could dig that, man. I think the next 10 years is going to be a lot of fun now.
01:00:23.642 - 01:00:31.554, Speaker B: I just hope sometime in the next four years Bitcoin doesn't drop below like 58. Because that's Naylor's liquidation price.
01:00:31.642 - 01:00:34.818, Speaker A: That's not his liquidation price. That's the average price he bought it at.
01:00:34.954 - 01:00:37.602, Speaker B: So his liquidation price should be even higher.
01:00:37.786 - 01:00:42.098, Speaker A: Get out. If his average price purchasing price is 58,000.
01:00:42.234 - 01:00:46.398, Speaker B: Yeah. Why would it like it means you borrow that much money.
01:00:46.554 - 01:00:49.942, Speaker A: Oh, I see. So what do you think is liquidation price?
01:00:50.046 - 01:00:51.450, Speaker B: If your cost basis.
01:00:52.350 - 01:00:55.302, Speaker A: You're right. So what do you think is liquidation prices then?
01:00:55.406 - 01:01:05.170, Speaker B: I think it's somewhere around 60. Let's hope that doesn't happen this motherfucker, man. It does, man. If it does, we're going to get Terra and FTX times 100.
01:01:05.550 - 01:01:06.742, Speaker A: What's wrong with this guy?
01:01:06.806 - 01:01:10.134, Speaker B: I don't know. He owns 3% of the total supply of bitcoin.
01:01:10.182 - 01:01:10.950, Speaker A: Oh, I thought it was 2%.
01:01:10.990 - 01:01:11.814, Speaker B: That is insane.
01:01:11.942 - 01:01:13.334, Speaker A: That's insane. Whatever it is. Yeah.
01:01:13.382 - 01:01:17.442, Speaker B: 3%. That is insane. 3% of a $3 trillion asset.
01:01:17.606 - 01:01:22.308, Speaker A: It's like only 3% whiff, right? Like at one point like people did 4%.
01:01:22.455 - 01:01:23.114, Speaker B: 5%.
01:01:23.282 - 01:01:32.986, Speaker A: I mean like for every meme coin. That's like the. That's what you want. So I think Sailor wants his 3%. Okay. Okay. That's the worst case scenario.
01:01:32.986 - 01:01:43.636, Speaker A: Best case scenario, bitcoin goes to 500k. What would that put Saylor, the richest man in the world in the history of sailors civilization.
01:01:43.828 - 01:01:47.700, Speaker B: Sailor, the first trillionaire in the history of humanity.
01:01:47.860 - 01:01:54.116, Speaker A: What can he do with that? Like what? Like meaning like a lot of it's. Just on the balance sheet of microstrategy, right?
01:01:54.188 - 01:01:54.676, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:01:54.788 - 01:01:55.972, Speaker A: What's he do with it?
01:01:56.076 - 01:02:02.020, Speaker B: It's not about the money. It's about proving a point. Sailor probably has a huge chip on his shoulder.
01:02:02.180 - 01:02:04.804, Speaker A: Did you see all the shit he went through throughout his life?
01:02:04.972 - 01:02:15.410, Speaker B: I didn't, but I saw him at the bitcoin conference in Nashville. Like, he is very intense. I didn't speak with him, but you can tell he's intense. He's got the aura.
01:02:16.470 - 01:02:42.990, Speaker A: So it was funny. I was watching this clip of Scotty. Did you see the Scottie Pippen clip? Okay, so they're on a panel, a bitcoin panel. It was Sailor, Scottie Pippen, two randoms. And the guys, like the moderator is like, hey, Scottie Pippen, you said you met Satoshi. And he go. Then he responds by saying, yeah, I met satoshi back in 1993.
01:02:42.990 - 01:03:05.424, Speaker A: He told me about bitcoin or like something about bitcoin. And, you know, I became a big believer in it as he was saying it. You should have seen Saylor's face. Oh, my God. He went like this and he, like, gave like such a dirty look. Oh, my God. It was a sight to be seen.
01:03:05.424 - 01:03:06.608, Speaker A: Oh, my God.
01:03:06.704 - 01:03:10.624, Speaker B: Okay, so, yeah, Pippin is going to destroy his legacy.
01:03:10.752 - 01:03:11.824, Speaker A: He did already.
01:03:11.992 - 01:03:13.008, Speaker B: He did already.
01:03:13.144 - 01:03:25.620, Speaker A: I mean, in Chicago, which is where I'm from, there back in the day, there was a saying about Pippin. If you go to, like, the restaurants they would go to, the waiters would tell you this. But his nickname was. No, Pippin Tippin.
01:03:27.730 - 01:03:38.858, Speaker B: I mean, Pippen kind of got fucked financially by the coach in the back office, right? He got paid, like, very little money. He signed like a 10 year contract for very, very little money or something.
01:03:38.914 - 01:03:43.722, Speaker A: No. And. And Jordan really just took the bulk of the money. So.
01:03:43.826 - 01:03:44.138, Speaker B: But.
01:03:44.194 - 01:03:53.972, Speaker A: But Jordan was also very cheap. And waiters will tell you that too. But. Okay, going back to. Okay, so I'll end it with this. Let's go through Sailor's trauma.
01:03:54.146 - 01:03:54.980, Speaker B: Okay?
01:03:55.800 - 01:04:17.220, Speaker A: Okay. Because I want to know what's driving this. Because when he talks, I feel the intensity. I vibe with his intensity. Okay.com bubble fallout 2000. MicroStrategy faced a major financial scandal when the company had to restate its earnings due to accounting irregularities.
01:04:17.220 - 01:04:41.990, Speaker A: The incident led to a massive stock price collapse from $3,000 per share to $4 share at its lowest. Saylor person lost billions in paper wealth as MicroStrategy valuation plummeted. The SEC fined Saylor and other executives $11 million for fraud. I don't know if this is good for bitcoin's price right now, but. Okay. He had. Yeah, I think that's pretty much it.
01:04:42.290 - 01:04:43.914, Speaker B: That doesn't explain his intensity.
01:04:43.962 - 01:04:47.578, Speaker A: No, it doesn't. I need to know his, like, childhood trauma.
01:04:47.674 - 01:04:52.132, Speaker B: Yeah. Hey, you know what? I know what it is. I know what it is.
01:04:52.316 - 01:04:54.228, Speaker A: He did go to mit, right? Yeah.
01:04:54.404 - 01:04:57.668, Speaker B: Michael Saylor is very short. Did you know this?
01:04:57.804 - 01:04:58.480, Speaker A: No.
01:04:58.780 - 01:05:00.160, Speaker B: He's very short.
01:05:01.180 - 01:05:04.868, Speaker A: Let's find out. All right, what's his height? He's 5 8.
01:05:05.004 - 01:05:09.748, Speaker B: He's not 58 because I saw him in person. I'm 5 9. He's not 5 8.
01:05:09.884 - 01:05:10.356, Speaker A: Okay.
01:05:10.388 - 01:05:17.308, Speaker B: He's definitely not 5 8. That is the trauma. He's very short and very skinny. He. He's a tiny guy.
01:05:17.484 - 01:05:19.200, Speaker A: He has a short guy syndrome.
01:05:19.860 - 01:05:21.980, Speaker B: That's what gives him the intensity.
01:05:22.140 - 01:05:36.092, Speaker A: All right, so then I think we should put height on our application page. Oh, man. Any bag changes or still holding on to the bags?
01:05:36.236 - 01:05:44.132, Speaker B: Bag changes. Hey, what do you think of AI6 and Z? Is this still a hold? Because there's been a lot of fud.
01:05:44.276 - 01:06:17.360, Speaker A: There's always fud. Oh, this is fun. So people were putting up tweets of how it's compared to Defi summer, and I 100% agree for this reason. Do you remember all the FUD that happened back in the day in Defi Summer with, like, Curve or Sushiswap and bag holders fighting with each other? Ultimately, this is what happened. This is what's unfolding in front of us. So, you know, people that are holding cerebro is flooding AI6 and Z. AI6 and Z bag holders are fudding Zeribro.
01:06:17.360 - 01:06:43.080, Speaker A: And so this is what's happening. They're trying to fight for winners, but ultimately, the community got together, and the more FUD the Zbro group gave to the AI6 and C group, the stronger they got. And so I'm not picking sides here, but I have bags in both.
01:06:44.900 - 01:06:50.800, Speaker B: Who are the biggest contenders for the bitcoin of AI Agents?
01:06:51.220 - 01:07:04.768, Speaker A: Goat is the only one that's a bitcoin of AI Sorry. If you were to categorize all of the meme coins, all of the AI Agents meme coins, I'd say number one is going to be Goat.
01:07:04.944 - 01:07:07.824, Speaker B: And there's no second best. There's no second best.
01:07:07.992 - 01:07:25.834, Speaker A: There's no second best. Then you have what I think are contenders for number two three spot, which is like, I think AI6 and Z. Zeribro, Fartcoin. Fartcoin are like the three that I could see under another category, I would.
01:07:25.842 - 01:07:27.790, Speaker B: Put ACT in that category.
01:07:28.130 - 01:07:44.510, Speaker A: Yeah, act. So like those four, Right. I don't know who will win each other. They could create their own sectors, industries. I don't know what that looks like. But those are like the front running, right? Yeah. And then the latter are like all the individual AI agents.
01:07:44.510 - 01:08:05.190, Speaker A: So, like, I had a tweet out. Let me just put it up there. Slop. Okay, so the ones that are like individual AI agents, I shared. Where did I share this? Here we go. Okay, so there's also Zrebro. That's individual AI agent, AI16Z.
01:08:05.190 - 01:08:24.052, Speaker A: Sorry. There's AIXBT, there's. Well, you know, the thing is you can categorize them as agents as well. So you have Zuribro, you have aixbt, Goat, Fartcoin, Bully, Ava. Then you have waifu, which is the agent.
01:08:24.116 - 01:08:24.756, Speaker B: Oh, waifu.
01:08:24.788 - 01:08:30.308, Speaker A: Yeah, which. It uses Pump as a launch pad alongside virtual.
01:08:30.404 - 01:08:32.788, Speaker B: Oh, it does waifu use Pump?
01:08:32.884 - 01:08:48.648, Speaker A: It uses Pump. So the way waifu works is right now it uses the eliza's framework. So if you want to launch an AI agent, it uses the Eliza's. It uses the Elysis framework, and then it also uses Pump to launch an agent.
01:08:48.824 - 01:08:54.104, Speaker B: Okay, wait, what's the ticker for waifu? Is it this one called dasha?
01:08:54.232 - 01:09:08.786, Speaker A: It's called. Yeah, I think it's dasha. Yeah, DASHA is the one, I think. Yeah, that's the main one. It's like a. It's a platform and agent token. There's also chaos, sense, giga, etc.
01:09:08.786 - 01:09:11.670, Speaker A: Etc. Eliza, DJI.
01:09:12.170 - 01:09:13.070, Speaker B: All right.
