00:00:00.160 - 00:00:34.184, Speaker A: When Eigen on Evo? Yeah, so everyone always asks, pre token, perk, pre launch. Yeah, yeah. I mean, I'm sure it traded at, like, ten B FDB or more. What I've learned, making these markets or launching them is the best time to do it is, you know, maybe a month or two before the actual token launches. Layer zero is a good example. They've been teasing this token for so long, no one knows when it's gonna launch. Like, do I actually want to trade this market? If it comes out in two years, I don't think I care enough to do it.
00:00:34.184 - 00:00:59.424, Speaker A: So the sweet spot is when we know token is confirmed, it's going to be on this date. This is the supply. Everyone's playing the speculating game on where it's going to trade. I think that's a much more interesting market to trade than something which may never launch. Really? Yeah. So we have just found, like, the sweet spot is between one week to a month or two. So, you know, when Eigen announces they're going to do a token, we'll be ready to make a market for it.
