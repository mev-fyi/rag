00:00:00.250 - 00:00:04.190, Speaker A: Welcome to good game, your no BS insights for crypto founders.
00:00:07.250 - 00:00:37.922, Speaker B: You know the IQ bell curve meme with AI on the high IQ and meme coin on the low IQ? Yes, it went viral. Honestly, I think what's really happening, the reality is the opposite. Yes, I think the meme coin people are the high IQ and the AI people are the low IQ. Yes, the AI people have actually no ability to dissect whether what's real or not. Like, I'll just put it out there. 99% of coins, AI coins out there are complete bullshit. And you should know exactly what you're getting into when you buy an AI coin.
00:00:37.922 - 00:00:47.994, Speaker B: On the other hand, the people who are the earliest in trading the meme coins, I think they're some of the smartest people and they're really in tune with where the market is.
00:00:48.112 - 00:01:18.418, Speaker A: Looking for your next startup idea in crypto, check out our request for startups list and get inspired at Alliance XYZ ideas. Welcome to good game. Today we're going to talk about the most recent trends in crypto, and some of those include meme coins, the blast transition with all the new apps and their launch, some of the newer NFT PFPs they've launched, and sentiment right, just understanding where we are in the cycle and where we think we're going to go next.
00:01:18.584 - 00:01:22.280, Speaker B: But you look both excited and tired. What's going on?
00:01:22.730 - 00:02:04.254, Speaker A: I'm tired, man. I think I'm at a point now for meme coins where I'm not willing to stay up late at night anymore or cause issues with my sleep. That's what I've been doing for the past month or so. I think now that the general public is aware of meme coins, before it was non consensus, I tweeted about this in November where I said, look, I think meme coins is going to be the catalyst for next run. It's going to be a major driver for new users in crypto. It's not going to be games or et cetera. Now it seems like it's become very consensus to the point where we're getting 20 page manifestos from VCs.
00:02:04.382 - 00:02:05.460, Speaker B: Oh my God.
00:02:10.230 - 00:02:11.726, Speaker A: How do you feel about that show?
00:02:11.848 - 00:02:37.578, Speaker B: Look, if BTC wasn't so strong, I would be calling the top on mean coins right now. The moment you have VCs philosophizing about something that, for which the only reason to exist is to gamble, then it's the top, right? There's people philosophizing about why meme coins are the future of culture, gaming, social fly, blah, blah, blah. In reality. People just love gambling.
00:02:37.674 - 00:02:38.318, Speaker C: That's it.
00:02:38.404 - 00:02:49.826, Speaker A: It's simple, it's more entertaining, and there's adrenaline rush. Right. And then the end goal is to be wealthy. Right. That's like the way you win this.
00:02:49.848 - 00:02:58.310, Speaker B: Game and the entertainment is a secondary benefit. But nothing else is even close to these two.
00:02:58.380 - 00:03:03.078, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, the entertainment is really just the devs that created the project.
00:03:03.164 - 00:03:03.800, Speaker C: And.
00:03:06.330 - 00:03:12.950, Speaker A: Are they a rogue dev? Are they a good dev? Right. That's like the first battle. The second battle is like the jeets.
00:03:13.030 - 00:03:13.322, Speaker C: Right.
00:03:13.376 - 00:04:01.030, Speaker A: Then there's a tweet that was recently. I forgot who it was, but it was a great tweet and encapsulates this perfectly, which is you have the big bosses at the 50K market cap, 100K market cap, then it's a million dollar market cap, then 2 million, then five, then ten, then 20, and there's jeets. And they'll sell. It's so annoying on Dexcreener, if you look at it, you look at their profit and loss. I'm angry because I got jeeted on so many times, and they'll sell for a one dollars profit. It's like you spend $25,000 on this coin for days, and then you dump on the market at the point where we're going to break resistance for a dollar profit.
00:04:01.110 - 00:04:08.054, Speaker B: For those who don't know, I guess the definition for jeets is paper handing djens.
00:04:08.182 - 00:04:08.474, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:04:08.512 - 00:04:10.570, Speaker A: I mean, they'll sell it. Any news?
00:04:10.720 - 00:04:11.238, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:04:11.344 - 00:04:13.546, Speaker B: And also, there is a cultural shift.
00:04:13.658 - 00:04:13.934, Speaker C: Right?
00:04:13.972 - 00:04:20.830, Speaker B: Like three months ago when we talked about you and I, Djan, into bald. Remember on base, August 23?
00:04:20.980 - 00:04:22.206, Speaker C: August, yes.
00:04:22.308 - 00:04:45.990, Speaker B: We got rugged. And then November was the first run for. Or December was the first run for wif. I tweeted about wiff from time to time. I didn't say you should buy or anything like that. By the way, nothing in this episode or nothing ever that we talk about is financial advice. But at that point in time, I tweeted about wifi, about meme coins, and then a lot of people were really pissed off.
00:04:45.990 - 00:04:58.938, Speaker B: But today, it seems like meme coins are the future of culture, future of gaming, future of entertainment, future of social Phi, future of everything.
00:04:59.104 - 00:04:59.818, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:04:59.984 - 00:05:12.080, Speaker B: So there is a cultural shift, which is also interesting. It's obvious why that happened is because price has gone up 100 times and people have finally wrapped their head around it.
00:05:13.010 - 00:05:39.690, Speaker A: I was thinking a lot about meme coins, and I'm not going to philosophize here, but you could think about it in this angle, which is Internet culture has been around for now. Let's say 30, 40 years. And there's many niches in the Internet that has a very loyal, strong following. Right. So if you look at four Chan or Reddit, like, these intersections of the Internet that no one really looks into.
00:05:39.760 - 00:05:40.380, Speaker C: Right.
00:05:40.990 - 00:05:46.940, Speaker A: And that's where a lot of the things that we see publicly, that's where it originates from. Right.
00:05:47.310 - 00:05:53.678, Speaker B: Taipei originated from four chan, a bunch of, like, even Obama Sonic, all of.
00:05:53.684 - 00:06:15.762, Speaker A: These things that are now, you see when you scroll down TikTok and now everyone laughs at it, they originated from these corners of the Internet. Right. And now they're propagated to the top where the world can see. And I think this is just going to accelerate over time. Right. And this is where new media, this is like a new area of media that will come from this.
00:06:15.896 - 00:06:17.694, Speaker B: Yeah, you're philosophizing.
00:06:17.822 - 00:06:22.630, Speaker A: Yeah, but I am a little bit. But I'm trying to get to a point here.
00:06:22.700 - 00:06:24.742, Speaker B: No, that is true. I agree with you. I agree with you.
00:06:24.796 - 00:06:50.378, Speaker A: But the point is that eventually these things are going to be all tokenized and it's going to help them spread the message even faster. And so I feel like where we are in the memecoin area or the phase of meme coins is kind of like the ICo area era for Defi and crypto. Every part of the Internet culture is going to be tokenized, and instead of having a founder and all of it's just going to be like fair drop, like a fair launch.
00:06:50.474 - 00:06:51.022, Speaker C: Right.
00:06:51.156 - 00:07:00.962, Speaker A: So that's kind of the way I see this going. And this is how memes are going to compete for attention in the long run, is the way I see it. Do you feel the same way or no?
00:07:01.016 - 00:07:17.510, Speaker B: Yeah, of course. I mean, that's kind of obvious. And there is a self reinforcing effect. Right. The meme actually helps the token pump because people love funny memes. Right. But also the token helps to spread the virality of the meme itself.
00:07:17.510 - 00:07:32.554, Speaker B: So there is a very strong self reinforcing effect. And funny, when you said earlier that all these meme coins are going to be fair launches or fair airdrops, our legal counsel earlier today said that meme coins are the furthest from securities.
00:07:32.682 - 00:07:33.070, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:07:33.140 - 00:07:43.866, Speaker B: Because there is no insider supply. There is no, what's it called? Common effort. There's no work to make it do something. There's no utility.
00:07:44.058 - 00:07:44.702, Speaker C: Right.
00:07:44.836 - 00:08:32.174, Speaker A: A couple of things. I think if founders are looking to build a startup, you should also think about launching memecoin, because I'd rather back a dev versus someone that's anon. That's a jeep that you don't trust, right? It sounds contrarian today, but I do think that there is some sort of opportunity for really reputable devs to think about that knows growth, marketing, virality, and maybe they get 5% of token supply over a vested period of time, but their focus is to grow this part of the community globally. I do think there's an opportunity for that because there's so much of the Internet culture that hasn't been tokenized yet that is starting to get tokenized. Like, I can go down a list of all the shitcoins I'm following right now, and there's so many.
00:08:32.292 - 00:08:38.302, Speaker B: All right, let's talk about those. What are the top ten shit coins that you're following?
00:08:38.446 - 00:08:39.458, Speaker A: Oh, my God.
00:08:39.624 - 00:08:40.494, Speaker B: NFA.
00:08:40.622 - 00:08:54.598, Speaker A: NFA. So I'll just go down my deck. Screener list. Popcat. Hopcat is actually very interesting. They have a website where you could push a button and then pop the cat's mouth open. Like a pop.
00:08:54.598 - 00:09:23.234, Speaker A: Like a pop cat. And it shows all the regions of the world that have done this, and the numbers are astonishing. So I'll give you some numbers here. Okay, so worldwide, 641,000,000,000 pops have been done, if I'm reading this correctly, of which number one is Hong Kong at 122,000,000,002nd. Is Thailand at 121,000,000,000. Taiwan is at 120,000,000,000. And then it goes on and on.
00:09:23.234 - 00:09:37.620, Speaker A: United States is at 10 billion as an example. But this is interesting if you think about it. Let's take a step back. People are competing on the Internet all over the world to represent their country.
00:09:39.430 - 00:09:40.180, Speaker C: Right?
00:09:40.730 - 00:09:49.414, Speaker A: And they just want to get on top of the leaderboard and so they can represent their country. And so this is like a kind of a global arms race to be number one on the list.
00:09:49.532 - 00:09:51.846, Speaker B: This is truly crypto native gaming.
00:09:51.958 - 00:10:03.740, Speaker A: Yeah, it's not crypto native. This part isn't crypto native. This is just a meme that came. But people could now speculate on a token. Right, which is the popcat token. So I found that to be very interesting.
00:10:04.190 - 00:10:05.210, Speaker B: Harambe.
00:10:06.290 - 00:10:24.366, Speaker A: It hasn't moved that much. But Harambe is another one, which is obviously, if you know the story about the ape that got shot. Right? And it did really well on Ethereum, but there's a derivative of Solana. Stanley cup. I've been tweeting about Stanley cup for a while. Their animation is great. Obviously, if you listen to our podcast.
00:10:24.366 - 00:10:59.438, Speaker A: I forgot which podcast it was. But I talked about Stanley Cups and why. It's like an interesting phenomenon on TikTok. But funny enough, a week after there was a token launch that happened, which was Stanley, Stanley cup. And it's a more of a cultural kind of phenomenon in the US at least, where every high schooler in the world buys a Stanley cup, that's like their thing. So Stanley cup retardio is another one, which I just find to be great.
00:10:59.604 - 00:11:01.278, Speaker B: Are you done? Do you have other.
00:11:01.444 - 00:11:02.686, Speaker A: I can keep going.
00:11:02.788 - 00:11:03.646, Speaker B: Yeah, keep going, keep going.
00:11:03.668 - 00:11:12.514, Speaker A: Whole podcast can be about keep going. There's upside down cat, kpop, upside down.
00:11:12.552 - 00:11:14.002, Speaker B: Cat is USDC, right?
00:11:14.056 - 00:11:29.510, Speaker A: USDC. And the goal is to first cat to $1, 1st cat to $1 arab cat. Kanye Mogcoin dgen which is on base farcaster Trump, Bowden.
00:11:29.850 - 00:11:34.058, Speaker B: Let's talk about Trump and Bowden. That's the one everyone is curious about.
00:11:34.224 - 00:11:37.740, Speaker A: Let's do it. So maybe if you want to give your high level thoughts on that one.
00:11:39.150 - 00:12:11.186, Speaker B: I think Bowden is the most on brand. Funniest meme I've seen since Wiff. Unfortunately, it happened a little bit late in the cycle. I don't know if it'll take off, but I really enjoy that one. It's super on brand with Joe Biden. And you and I chatted about this at the beginning of the year when we put out our request for startups for Alliance 2024. And we said that meme coins will become prediction markets, especially this year for political prediction markets.
00:12:11.186 - 00:12:59.174, Speaker B: And we said that a fungible token like Trump or Biden, dollar sign Trump or dollar sign Biden will trade far more, will be far more active than their traditional binary, traditional market counterparts. And basically two months later, dollar sign MAGA reached 200 million FDV tramp, which is this new meme coin, is a new one. It's also a Trump meme coin, but it's separate from dollars on MAGA. And they're both, what, like 30 million FDV now? And I think that basically as we approach the November election itself, both will become prediction markets. So, meaning if Trump wins the election, the day that Trump wins the election, Trump will go up and Bowden will go down and vice versa. And shorty, go ahead.
00:12:59.292 - 00:13:19.340, Speaker A: Sorry. Just to counter that, I feel like Bowden is so on brand with his character that I feel like it's almost the inverse. And so, like, if you hold both Trump and Bowden, you're actually leverage long Trump.
00:13:22.750 - 00:13:25.530, Speaker B: So you're saying Boden is inverse Biden?
00:13:25.690 - 00:13:36.398, Speaker A: It is. The worse he does the better it should be. Right? It characterizes his character, all the flaws of his characteristics in a meme coin.
00:13:36.494 - 00:13:37.140, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:13:37.750 - 00:14:03.850, Speaker B: And later we had Elizabeth Horn also reach like 20 FDB. Even some BTC Maxis really enjoyed the meme, the horn meme and tweeted about it. Meme coins might be the first thing outside of BTC that brings both the BTC Maxicam and the Ethereum or the non maxicam together, which is quite something.
00:14:04.000 - 00:14:18.074, Speaker A: I mean, that's what the power memes are, right? Like, the memes can unite people together. Like the Arab Spring. Right? What happened in early two thousand s and all the other uprisings. This happens through memes and messages.
00:14:18.202 - 00:14:21.566, Speaker B: Do you have any thoughts on what's your thoughts on Bowden and Trump?
00:14:21.748 - 00:14:58.218, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, ideally what I think is going to play out is like, what you exactly mentioned, right? Bowden and Trump. Biden Trump. Right. Or Bowden Trump. And if Trump wins, then Trump should go up, right? It's like this token based prediction market. There's a lot of nuance to this, right? Because for meme coins to really take off, having been within the WiF community since $2 million market cap, I've realized there's a lot of things that need to go right for a token to do really well. One is you got to make sure that the developer that's really pushing your project stays out of the way.
00:14:58.218 - 00:15:21.554, Speaker A: It's very important that they stay out of the way. Let the meme and provide arsenal for the community to proliferate the meme in and itself. And then there needs to be a main character that pushes the meme to the community. So if it's the dev or if it's one of the key community leaders that has bought the token early and really wants to push it forward has to be there at all times.
00:15:21.752 - 00:15:24.558, Speaker B: Like Ansem for whiff, Ansem for wif.
00:15:24.654 - 00:15:56.110, Speaker A: There's someone for Bowden. There's someone for popcat art something. There's someone for Kanye. So these guys, whoever these representation of the token and the community itself is, they have to continue pushing that message across and they have to keep doing that. And that's, like, one thing that you look for. And so you see this in a lot of these strong communities. But the question is, and I tweeted about this before, too, which is like, should there be a platform that enables this to happen in a much more safe way? And that's something we'll talk about later.
00:15:56.110 - 00:16:03.434, Speaker A: But back to Bowden Tremp. I think seeing this prediction market play out is going to be very cool, especially coming close to the election.
00:16:03.562 - 00:16:41.014, Speaker B: Yeah, I have another way to frame Bowden and Tremp, which is actually very similar to Frantech 1.0. So in front tech 1.0, in the early days, a lot of people thought that it was about a social networking, right? It was about sharing knowledge. But after a while, I came to realization that it was simply far more about trading personal tokens than the knowledge sharing. By and large, of course, there's some knowledge sharing in some groups, but the fun behind friendtech 1.0 was really the personal token trading. And so that was the first iteration.
00:16:41.014 - 00:17:02.610, Speaker B: And then now you have Bowden and Tramp, which to me are the second iteration of the same idea. On the surface, they look very different from each other, right? But to me, Biden tramp are a new attempt at this idea of trading personal tokens. And it solves a very important problem with the frontech 1.0, which is for me, the UX was horrendous.
00:17:03.190 - 00:17:07.400, Speaker A: Taxes too, right? Like the 10% tax, buy and sell 10% tax.
00:17:07.770 - 00:17:31.374, Speaker B: The chat groups, very janky. The onboarding had like five steps, very difficult to use, whereas trading Tremp and Bowden, it's far easier. All you need is a Salana wallet, and then you start trading, and then all the social actually happens elsewhere. The social happens on Twitter, on telegram, et cetera. So it's a much more fun experience. I don't know what the 3.0 will look like.
00:17:31.374 - 00:17:34.766, Speaker B: Maybe it's fantasy, maybe it's something else.
00:17:34.868 - 00:17:42.698, Speaker A: Trends is another app where you can speculate on upcoming trends as keywords. Keywords on Twitter.
00:17:42.794 - 00:17:43.150, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:17:43.220 - 00:18:05.218, Speaker B: And french 2.0 will launch soon. I don't know what it'll look like, but in general, I really like the idea of trading personal tokens. If you take a step back and you think about crypto, crypto enables the tokenization of everything people want to gamble on things. And personal tokens just create a new way for people to gamble with some entertainment associated.
00:18:05.234 - 00:18:06.760, Speaker A: So I'm going to read the tweet out.
00:18:08.810 - 00:18:09.462, Speaker C: Okay.
00:18:09.596 - 00:18:42.418, Speaker A: This is from Doug Colkit. Some criticize memecoin mania as embracing nihilism, and I'm not entirely unsympathetic. But the bigger issue is the government has made it illegal to put value accrual on chain. Imagine a world where in tenements, anyone could start a business and issue tokens granting immediate access to global capital markets. Instead of scouring for fifty K M cap meme coins, the waiter of the entire Internet would direct its effort in capital, finding 50K mcap small businesses who are ready to break out. I've seen a lot of these takes where they blame the regulations on why meme coins are doing so well. But I'll take the counterposition, which is.
00:18:42.504 - 00:18:43.918, Speaker B: It's not the regulations.
00:18:44.094 - 00:19:01.802, Speaker A: Exactly. It's not the regulations. It's the meme itself. It's the marketing behind the meme. It's what you associate yourself and your personality with that matters more. It's easier. Right? Like, do you want someone to do a cash flow analysis of a small business and then invest in.
00:19:01.802 - 00:19:03.306, Speaker A: No one knows how to do that.
00:19:03.408 - 00:19:13.822, Speaker B: Or reading a 50 page white paper on modular layer two, restaking, blah, blah, blah. The buzwords that the average person doesn't understand.
00:19:13.956 - 00:19:41.230, Speaker A: No, they just see all these random coins. Okay, so there's two types of people in crypto. One that knows crypto, one that doesn't know crypto, the one that knows crypto. They're all seething right now, right. Because the tokens that they've invested in aren't going up. And the people that know what's happening, that's really into the culture, they know exactly where to invest their time and money in next. The last run, it was for a lot of people that I knew that were retail.
00:19:41.230 - 00:19:45.014, Speaker A: I asked them, I'm like, oh, yeah, you should buy defi this and this. You should know this already.
00:19:45.052 - 00:19:45.302, Speaker C: Right?
00:19:45.356 - 00:19:53.622, Speaker A: And they're like, oh, no, I don't even know what uniswap is. Right. And so it's almost like we're having the exact inverse of the last run.
00:19:53.756 - 00:20:08.622, Speaker B: Well, last round, the retail bought NFTs in the early days, at least, when NFTs were cheap. Yeah, last round, NFTs was what brought the retail in. And this run, we have the meme coins for me, meme coins and NFTs are fundamentally the same thing.
00:20:08.676 - 00:20:09.294, Speaker C: They are.
00:20:09.412 - 00:20:14.890, Speaker B: NFTs are basically meme coins for rich people, at least for punks and pudgies.
00:20:14.970 - 00:20:24.002, Speaker A: And I feel like those two worlds are going to merge. And we've talked about this before with the 404. I do think those two worlds are going to merge because they're one in the same thing.
00:20:24.056 - 00:20:28.530, Speaker B: Anyways, I want to touch on the blue chip coins.
00:20:28.690 - 00:20:55.854, Speaker A: Yeah, let's talk about the blue chips. So context is that chow and I are very. I think the market is getting too confusing for meme coins. Everyone's, like, launching coins, and you have the general public that finally understood what meme coins are. They're investing. And I think this is a point where you just kind of take a step back and focus on the ones that are the outperformers or the outliers. And that's what chaos is going to be talking about next.
00:20:55.972 - 00:20:56.254, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:20:56.292 - 00:21:09.506, Speaker B: So I saw this tweet, which the guy looked through the country training pages on coinmarketcap to track the top trending meme coin in each. So.
00:21:09.688 - 00:21:10.930, Speaker C: Really? Yeah.
00:21:11.000 - 00:21:40.610, Speaker B: So you can tell which country is into which meme coin. So today, there's this meme coin called floki. I never see anybody on Twitter talk about it. So it turns out that floki is a Europe and Middle east meme coin. And then paypay, obviously, paypay is Asia and Americas with. And Shib are both Americas, and Shib is also Africa.
00:21:40.710 - 00:21:41.454, Speaker A: Does that make sense?
00:21:41.492 - 00:21:45.146, Speaker B: So, like, every meme coin has their own regional stronghold.
00:21:45.258 - 00:21:46.640, Speaker A: Yeah, it makes.
00:21:48.610 - 00:21:49.022, Speaker C: Mean.
00:21:49.076 - 00:21:53.518, Speaker B: In hindsight. It makes sense because the memes spread out within certain communities, and they like.
00:21:53.524 - 00:21:54.806, Speaker A: Their clusters of communities.
00:21:54.938 - 00:21:55.378, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:21:55.464 - 00:22:19.222, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. And so this tells me a few things, right. One is that it isn't crypto Twitter. Before crypto, Twitter was kind of the home for where memes take off, and you have the circle jerk of people that are buying these tokens, as you call it. But to me, it seems like memes have gotten much bigger than crypto Twitter, and that's a really healthy, good sign to me.
00:22:19.276 - 00:22:23.258, Speaker B: So, out of these blue chips, which one are you excited about?
00:22:23.344 - 00:22:38.586, Speaker A: I'm very bullish with. I've seen Floki, I've seen Shiba, I've seen all the others. But to, like, if you were to ask me point blank, what's your favorite one? I'd say whiff, because that one will. I feel like it's the newest coin.
00:22:38.698 - 00:22:39.662, Speaker C: To hit the market.
00:22:39.796 - 00:22:47.810, Speaker A: And whenever something's new and shiny, people are much more excited about it. Like, it's the new thing. Right. All the other stuff is kind of old.
00:22:47.960 - 00:22:48.514, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:22:48.632 - 00:23:20.710, Speaker B: By the way, again, this is not financial advice, but if you guys trade meme coins for me, most likely every single one of these meme coins is a one cycle phenomenon. So if you trade with this cycle, I don't think next cycle it'll do as well. I mean, you won't go to zero, because this cycle, you have Doge and Shiba. Right. They're still not. They're still billion dollar networks. So by the same virtue, I don't expect wiff to go to zero, but I also don't expect wif to do exceptionally well in the next cycle.
00:23:20.710 - 00:23:23.114, Speaker B: Like, next cycle, there will be new, shiny things.
00:23:23.232 - 00:24:03.146, Speaker A: I mean, these are all cyclical, and so expect. I mean, they could all go to zero. So that's just something that you have to keep in mind. I want to mention something that I've been seeing a lot about. This will diverge a little bit, but ever since Wif launched, I'd say maybe when wif hit a billion dollar market cap, I've started to see a lot of crypto Twitter talk about how you need to lower your bar, lower your IQ, quote unquote, to invest in these new asset classes. Right, the meme coins look, yeah, I agree there's a spectrum of IQ, right. But to me, it seems like they're almost looking below them.
00:24:03.146 - 00:24:32.638, Speaker A: It almost feels like they're degrading the retail that's come into the market. And so I put a tweet out yesterday, and I said, it's funny to see crypto Twitter characterize retail as low IQ degenerates. But those same people failed to realize that they were once noobs in crypto and likely bought a shitcoin to enter the space. It's nice that you spent time understanding the differences between modular and monolithic, but that doesn't make you any better than anyone entering the space now. Learn to embrace new people coming to the market. Allow them to experience what you experience. We're part of this mass adoption cycle, so don't be so sour.
00:24:32.638 - 00:24:35.170, Speaker A: I lost a lot of followers because of that tweet.
00:24:38.650 - 00:24:50.866, Speaker B: You know the IQ bell curve meme with AI on the high IQ and meme coin on the low IQ? Yes, it went viral. Honestly, I think what's really happening, the reality is the opposite.
00:24:50.978 - 00:24:51.446, Speaker C: Yes.
00:24:51.548 - 00:24:55.078, Speaker B: I think the meme coin people are the high IQ and the AI people are the low IQ.
00:24:55.174 - 00:24:55.482, Speaker A: Yes.
00:24:55.536 - 00:25:24.274, Speaker B: The AI people have actually no ability to dissect whether what's real or not. Like, I'll just put it out there. 99% of coins, AI coins out there are complete bullshit. And you should know exactly what you're getting into when you buy an AI coin. On the other hand, the people who are the earliest in trading the meme coins, I think they're some of the smartest people, and they're really in tune with where the market is. I think Ansem is super smart, actually. I don't care what people say.
00:25:24.274 - 00:25:37.574, Speaker B: I think Ansem is extremely smart. He lives and breaths crypto markets. Andrew Kang as well. He was fairly early, I think later than us, but fairly early still. Yeah, he was quite for some time.
00:25:37.612 - 00:25:39.610, Speaker A: And then he emerged.
00:25:40.750 - 00:25:55.440, Speaker B: Latest insights are spot on. He said social fi was complete bullshit until meme coins. Like meme coins are the crypto native social fi, which I completely agree with 100%. Who else? Anyway, point being, I don't know.
00:25:55.890 - 00:26:40.380, Speaker A: Well, the point being is this cycle is unlike any other cycle. A lot of the people that have been in this space for a very long time may not feel like they have an edge in this market, and you could see that through their tweets. And the ones that do have an edge are the ones that are closest to culture and tech, and they see where the rhythm of crypto and culture intersects, and that's where they make their bet, which is why we're going down this list, because a lot of the list that we're going down through is actually a lot about culture. So Kpop is another one that I just mentioned. Arab Cat is another really popular meme in the web two world. Harry Potter Obama Sonic. I'm still very bullish on Harry Potter Obama sonic since.
00:26:41.970 - 00:26:44.302, Speaker B: Why is that? Because of the community or what?
00:26:44.356 - 00:26:51.600, Speaker A: The community, they're freaking autistic. And whenever you have an autistic community, you just can't bet against them.
00:26:53.030 - 00:26:56.530, Speaker B: What do you mean by what's an autistic behavior?
00:26:57.350 - 00:27:28.886, Speaker A: The whole world can shun them, right? Which has happened many times, and it almost went to zero, but they just won't sell. They believe in the meme so strongly that they're willing to go to zero than make a billion dollars. That's what I call autistic. And it's also like, the type of memes that come out of this community is so degenerate. Another community that I think is very autistic is bitcoin puppets. I tweeted out one time, like a month ago. Look, I faded bitcoin puppets.
00:27:28.886 - 00:27:38.686, Speaker A: I didn't fade node monkeys, but I did fade bitcoin puppets. I could have bought a lot, but I'll just make a safer bet, which was a very whatever, but I put a tweet out.
00:27:38.868 - 00:27:39.694, Speaker C: It's still a good bet.
00:27:39.732 - 00:28:05.270, Speaker A: I still think it's a good bet, which I think I will buy, given this dip. But I put a tweet out saying like, here are my favorite memes or Nfts I'm going to buy. And I just put for bitcoin ordinance. I only put node monkeys. And the community came and they just started rating my tweets, dming me like, oh, you're not going to make it. You're going to fail. I stopped and I'm like, maybe I am going to fail.
00:28:05.270 - 00:28:39.166, Speaker A: That's another very strong signal. Right. Which is like autistic communities or degenerate autistic communities. They'll fight for that community to the point where people that are tweeting about these communities, they'll feel something, they'll feel the heat. And so I felt that with Harry Potter, Obama, Sonic, I felt that with bitcoin puppets, meladys, Romelios. And the next one, I think is going to be peplicator, which is the. If you know Matt Fury, he's the creator of Pepes.
00:28:39.166 - 00:29:00.134, Speaker A: He finally came out with a Pepe collection that's one to 120 thousand collection. And I think that's going to ride the wave similar to the Pepe coin. This is not financial advice, but I also think that will do really well because of this autistic degenerate community that lives around this area.
00:29:00.252 - 00:29:00.726, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:29:00.828 - 00:29:02.780, Speaker B: Did we touch everything on.
00:29:03.310 - 00:29:11.370, Speaker A: I feel like we did. I mean, there's so many meme coins we could talk about, but generally speaking, that's like the high level overview of, I think, meme coins.
00:29:11.450 - 00:29:20.910, Speaker B: I am feeling some fatigue from meme coins. It's too consensus. And the newer memes are. There's a lot of dog shit.
00:29:21.570 - 00:29:48.298, Speaker A: Look, man, once everyone caught on the wind, when you're early into something in an area so early, and then all of a sudden everyone else comes in and kind of degrades the memes, the quality memes, and then fragments it by creating so many different types of memes, that's when, you know, attention liquidity has been fragmented and you need to take a step back and then double down on the ones that do really well because it's done for the cycle. I feel like it's done.
00:29:48.384 - 00:29:50.300, Speaker B: Do you feel well? Hold on.
00:29:52.510 - 00:29:55.690, Speaker A: Meaning I think now the winners are going to win, right?
00:29:55.760 - 00:29:56.042, Speaker C: Sure.
00:29:56.096 - 00:29:56.314, Speaker B: Okay.
00:29:56.352 - 00:30:11.806, Speaker A: And sure, you'll have outliers that might do really well, but there's too many to choose from, and there's too many opportunistic devs that are out there that will rug you from that perspective. It's done. But I still think meme coins have a long way to go from here.
00:30:11.828 - 00:30:18.030, Speaker B: Like those blue chip, like on chain, there's way too many coins, and that will fragment the attention.
00:30:18.190 - 00:30:18.900, Speaker C: Right.
00:30:19.670 - 00:30:45.222, Speaker B: But on centralized exchanges, there's only a handful of them. So supporting your point about winners will keep winning. I think that's probably true. Do you feel there's something unique about Salana culture that is it just the tech, or is it also the culture about Salana devs that makes it more likely for meme coins to take off on Salana. Because all the meme coins are taking off on Salana.
00:30:45.286 - 00:31:39.414, Speaker A: It's a very good question. I see it just like this 2020, 2021 punks launched on Ethereum, and that kind of became the canonical NFT chain, right? Similarly, same thing with meme coins, right? Like, whether it's wif or some of the other earlier meme coins on Solana, it's become the canonical meme coin chain. And I think it's just going to continue to proliferate on Solana just because it had so many big winners already. And there's a lot of liquidity that is stuck on Solana as one. Obviously, like, as you mentioned, speed fees for retail is very friendly. All the friends I talked to, when I told them to buy, et cetera, when they made the purchase, they called me, they're like, yo, why is it so cheap? They asked me why it was so cheap, like gas fees. I'm like, that's Solana, right? It's supposed to be cheap based on, obviously the infrastructure.
00:31:39.414 - 00:31:46.734, Speaker A: So I kind of explained why that was cheap. But they themselves were surprised as they started to buy more and more and more. They were able to bet more.
00:31:46.852 - 00:31:51.198, Speaker B: But do you feel meme coins could take off on Bayes, for example?
00:31:51.364 - 00:31:54.066, Speaker A: Yeah, well, they're trying very hard, right?
00:31:54.168 - 00:32:13.126, Speaker B: But I feel like the culture on Bayes is somewhat incompatible with meme coins. I don't know how to explain it. Do you feel what I feel? I cannot put what I feel into words, but that's how my internal network thinks about Bayes. Do you feel that?
00:32:13.228 - 00:32:54.846, Speaker A: I do, but here's the way I think about it. To me, every layer two, layer one. If you were to describe layer one, layer twos as countries, or even cities of countries all across the world, they all have their own personalities, they all have their own way of viewing the world. And I think that's happening on layer twos, right? So if you look at base, you could see them as more like left wing, right, more altruistic. Yes. That's like one way to think about blast. I see as a complete group of degenerates, like pioneer degenerates, that are more financially savvy.
00:32:54.846 - 00:32:59.542, Speaker A: Right? As an example, and you could probably say that about each of these communities, right?
00:32:59.676 - 00:33:16.378, Speaker B: Do you feel DJens are more likely to, on the political spectrum, to be more on the right side? Is there a correlation between and being right and voting Republican? Do you feel a correlation? I think I feel a correlation, even though I have no data to prove it.
00:33:16.464 - 00:33:17.162, Speaker A: I do.
00:33:17.296 - 00:33:18.074, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:33:18.272 - 00:33:21.378, Speaker B: And the progressive is less djen.
00:33:21.494 - 00:33:22.160, Speaker C: Yes.
00:33:22.930 - 00:33:25.082, Speaker B: And more maybe artistic.
00:33:25.226 - 00:33:35.714, Speaker A: More artistic. Yeah. Like base optimism. Zora side of the left. Right. And then I feel like the degenerate. Yeah, you're right.
00:33:35.714 - 00:33:39.710, Speaker A: So more degenerate community is more to the right facing.
00:33:39.870 - 00:33:40.242, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:33:40.296 - 00:33:43.090, Speaker B: Like blast Solana arbitrum.
00:33:44.630 - 00:33:53.078, Speaker A: And if that's the case, then I think we're going to see meme coins that are going to take off that's going to be tailored to those communities that we won't understand.
00:33:53.244 - 00:33:53.960, Speaker C: Right.
00:33:55.210 - 00:34:13.278, Speaker A: If we're more blast aligned. My personality is more like blast and Solana. That's kind of where I fit. So there's a meme coin that's called TYBG, which is unbase. And what's it called again? Tybg. It's a base God. Base God.
00:34:13.278 - 00:34:26.260, Speaker A: I mean, it's just really Brian Armstrong and they're putting him in a pedestal. He has like a halo on and he's wearing a white.
00:34:28.070 - 00:34:29.118, Speaker C: Like, if I'm.
00:34:29.134 - 00:34:51.290, Speaker A: Going to long, and if that's the meme coin, I'll long it to make money. But there is a community that's out there that wakes up and they're like, TybG. I would be surprised if they have a picture of Brian Armstrong in the room. I don't know. This is the beauty about memes and culture. Right. To each their own.
00:34:51.290 - 00:35:14.770, Speaker A: I'm not going to criticize what happens in each of these communities, but I will long it if I can. This is not financial advice, but yeah. So you have, like, I feel like what's going to happen. This is actually true because you mentioned this just earlier, which is even the different geographies across the world will align with a certain meme coin. Like Floki in Africa. I never knew that. And so I think this is true.
00:35:14.770 - 00:35:50.910, Speaker A: And memes are going to start to become more aligned with cultural values that will allow them political bias and political bias. And we're seeing some of this offshoots also with, like, Trump maga Biden. There's also Biden token, like a traditional Biden and Trump token. And so it's going to be very interesting to see how this all evolves. But I do think in the future, crypto will be where culture comes from next. It's not going to be the offshoots of the Internet. Right? Like the corners of four chan or the corners of Reddit or whatever.
00:35:50.910 - 00:35:54.862, Speaker A: I think crypto is going to lead culture moving forward.
00:35:54.996 - 00:35:55.726, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:35:55.908 - 00:36:00.526, Speaker B: Because with the token, there is a financial incentive for people to spread the.
00:36:00.548 - 00:36:16.706, Speaker A: Meme which is why when we talked about our first podcast with Wif, when we're wearing the hats, I said with the token should sell hats. And I do think these memes could become more than just memes. Right? They could become real world brands in the future.
00:36:16.888 - 00:36:39.402, Speaker B: By the way, apparently there is a marketing department, quote unquote, marketing department for WiF. And that's the team that put the huge hat on the Wall street bowl. And that's the team that applied for the Las Vegas dome, by the way, everyone has heard this, but they're raising six hundred K to get that ad.
00:36:39.536 - 00:36:41.782, Speaker A: And so many people called the top on it.
00:36:41.856 - 00:36:42.686, Speaker B: Oh my God.
00:36:42.788 - 00:36:54.930, Speaker A: I'm like, dude, the $50 million was raised for the constitution last run, and you're crying about 600K for a week on. And mostly the ETH maxis that are upset about this.
00:36:55.000 - 00:37:08.686, Speaker B: Oh, I mean, even Ethereum. Okay, so I feel like Ethereum base layer and Salana, they're on two sides of the political spectrum. Do you feel that? I feel like Ethereum is more left than Salana, 100%.
00:37:08.808 - 00:37:14.886, Speaker A: I mean, Vitalik is more left. I mean, if you think about it. How so you don't think he is?
00:37:14.988 - 00:37:16.886, Speaker B: I mean, what makes you say that?
00:37:16.988 - 00:37:24.810, Speaker A: I don't know, just things that he talks about, tweets about it. I don't know. That's just my general. Nothing in particular, but I feel like he swings me left.
00:37:24.880 - 00:37:41.550, Speaker B: Vitalik is very libertarian. He comes from the OG bitcoin community. But I don't know if Vitalik is left or right. He's definitely on the libertarian versus autocracy or authoritarian spectrum.
00:37:41.970 - 00:37:42.698, Speaker A: He's more libertarian.
00:37:42.714 - 00:37:44.302, Speaker B: He's a libertarian extreme.
00:37:44.446 - 00:37:45.042, Speaker C: Yes.
00:37:45.176 - 00:37:48.754, Speaker A: And usually there's overlap between libertarians and left right.
00:37:48.872 - 00:37:51.262, Speaker B: I feel like in the US it's the opposite.
00:37:51.406 - 00:38:08.920, Speaker A: There's probably now the entire political spectrum has changed, but traditionally speaking, libertarians overlap with the left. That has changed. I agree. Now I feel like the left has gone so left that the libertarians just stayed where they.
00:38:09.850 - 00:38:21.498, Speaker B: But, but anyway, I do feel not Vitali himself, but the core ethereum maxi community is more left than the core Solana Maxi community.
00:38:21.664 - 00:38:28.400, Speaker A: I'd agree with a. Yeah, I won't divulge into it, but I think Ansem had tweeted something out about.
00:38:30.050 - 00:38:31.342, Speaker B: I don't know what you're talking about.
00:38:31.396 - 00:38:32.398, Speaker A: Do you want me to read it?
00:38:32.484 - 00:38:33.120, Speaker C: Yes.
00:38:35.810 - 00:38:36.910, Speaker A: I'm looking for.
00:38:37.060 - 00:38:39.826, Speaker B: I'm bullish base. I'm very bullish base.
00:38:39.928 - 00:38:43.170, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, I am too. There's nothing wrong with.
00:38:43.240 - 00:38:49.398, Speaker B: But blast. I mean, the same camp as you. Blast and Solana feel like home.
00:38:49.564 - 00:38:53.606, Speaker A: Yeah, I can't find the tweet, but when I do, I'll read it out, too.
00:38:53.708 - 00:39:01.020, Speaker B: He said something to the effect of Bez is to Solana, white girls is to black men or something like that.
00:39:06.270 - 00:39:07.020, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:39:07.710 - 00:39:11.446, Speaker B: I don't know if we want to cut this or not, but it's so funny.
00:39:11.638 - 00:39:31.854, Speaker A: I mean, it's no holes bar, right? We get to talk our thoughts and look, I think this is fair. I do think now if we talk about meme coins, okay, now there's different meme coins. They are geographically aligned. Now, could layer twos have its own geo based chain?
00:39:31.982 - 00:39:32.322, Speaker C: Right?
00:39:32.376 - 00:40:10.974, Speaker A: Like, if you think about it, it's all part of. Even if you look in the world of App Stores, yes, you have a lot of us apps that dominate the world, but there's also a lot of local apps that dominate regional consumption. Right. Like in India, there's very geo specific apps that I rely on when I go there. And that's all I could do in Malaysia. Different parts of the world, they're just very specific. And I always thought about what would a world look like in crypto? And when I first started out, I'm like, oh, yeah, most of the apps that will dominate the role of the Internet first, right? Like crypto native first.
00:40:10.974 - 00:40:31.030, Speaker A: They came in first, like Metamask. 50 million, 100 million monthly active users. I don't know if I buy that as much anymore. I do feel like eventually, over time, people are going to align with what they feel that suits their needs locally. And I do feel like that's going to happen. Wechat in China as an example. It's a perfect example of this.
00:40:31.100 - 00:40:40.170, Speaker B: I can see a layer two for Islam. I can see a layer two for Japan, for example.
00:40:40.320 - 00:40:41.626, Speaker C: Right? Sure.
00:40:41.728 - 00:40:48.854, Speaker B: And currently already with bays and Blaz, I think there is already some sort of political self selection. Unintentionally.
00:40:48.982 - 00:40:56.030, Speaker A: Yeah. I could see a layer two for Africa. I could see a layer two for India. I could see a layer two for Bollywood.
00:40:57.810 - 00:41:04.402, Speaker B: I think there will be a layer two for Africa and a layer two for Islam in the next six months. I can see that coming.
00:41:04.456 - 00:41:29.980, Speaker A: I can see that happening, too. So much so that I think some will launch very know, maybe some fun stuff to lay out. Is Ansem tweeted out, he gets a lot of DMs for projects to get exposure or for meme coins to get exposure. He's like, you know what? Don't sell me your supply or give me your supply. Just airdrop it to the Wif community.
00:41:31.230 - 00:41:32.362, Speaker B: Yeah, I saw that.
00:41:32.416 - 00:41:50.974, Speaker A: Good on know there's a lot of opportunistic people that are out there, but airdropping the Wif community holders could be an interesting strategy to bootstrap new meme coins. I don't know where it's going to go, but it's still very early. But I haven't seen any projects do this yet. But it's an interesting phenomenon if it was to happen and how that would look.
00:41:51.092 - 00:42:05.666, Speaker B: Yeah, it reminds me of a bunch of modular projects that airdropped to. Was it like Pudgy's got a bunch of airdrops? I think Matlads did as well from new projects.
00:42:05.778 - 00:42:06.294, Speaker C: Right.
00:42:06.412 - 00:42:07.554, Speaker B: Same strategy.
00:42:07.682 - 00:43:02.550, Speaker A: So outside of memes, which has been largely dominated my mind space for such a long time, I'm starting to pull up and I'm starting to think about where the trend is going next. I've put a tweet out saying that I think it's going to be social fi, because I do think socialify is on the cusp of real social fi. Summer, I'll read out some of the things that I'm really excited about. Farcaster transaction frames update, which is really cool. I think that being able to conduct a transaction within a frame is like the next iteration of where Farcaster is going to go next or Warpcast is going to go next. So being able to buy or sell a uniswap token as an example, directly in a frame, that is going to create a lot of virality kind of loops. So think about it this way, right? We're thinking about how to grow meme coins.
00:43:02.550 - 00:43:21.194, Speaker A: This is a perfect way to increase your user base much more efficiently, much more quickly than just tweeting it out on Twitter. And so I do think Farcaster transaction frames update is going to be that next iteration of growing farcaster community. Frontech v two. Airdrop is another one.
00:43:21.232 - 00:43:21.482, Speaker C: Okay.
00:43:21.536 - 00:43:23.822, Speaker B: Do we know what Frontech v two is about?
00:43:23.956 - 00:43:48.230, Speaker A: I have some idea. Look, I have many anonymous accounts, and I've been farming frontech for a very long time. I've been in racist chat, I've read all his brainstorming sessions, stuff like that. And I'll give you a high level of where I think it's going to go. It's going to be like a money club. A money club is where you have a trusted influencer that has a trusted group of people.
00:43:48.380 - 00:43:48.886, Speaker C: Right?
00:43:48.988 - 00:44:16.426, Speaker A: It's a one to many, right? So influencer a can engage with his or her community, and then we'll bring up to light any community that messages something that's really good for the community at large. Now that you have this reputable trust layer, you could, or the influencer could share financial advice and could also capitalize on that financial advice. That's like one way, second way is launch.
00:44:16.538 - 00:44:19.114, Speaker B: But what you just described is Frontech.
00:44:19.162 - 00:44:21.054, Speaker C: One version. One. Yeah.
00:44:21.092 - 00:44:35.378, Speaker A: So I'm going to go to. It is, but it wasn't very encapsulated before. Now it's clear what it is. Before, it was more of an experiment. If you were to tell me what front tech V one was, nobody knew what it was. I don't think racer himself knew. At first.
00:44:35.378 - 00:45:11.200, Speaker A: I thought it was just like longing shitcoins. That's what I thought it was first. And so reading through his process from the day one till now, it's now very clear this is where it's going to be. This is the magic. The second thing he's going to do is allow people to issue their own tokens or tradable assets that's trusted. I don't know how that's going to look like, but let's say you're ansome and you're like, hey, I think this is the future of memes, this tradable asset, Harambe 2.0, he'll launch it and his community will buy it, and then they'll proliferate it to other people as an example.
00:45:11.200 - 00:45:40.274, Speaker A: And it's trusted because the problem that I mentioned earlier in our podcast was that you don't trust the jeets, right? You don't know who the jeets are. You don't know if they're going to, sorry, who the dubs are, right. And you don't know if they're going to sell or not, right. Or dump on you. And then also the community members. Now that you don't know, when I look at desk screener, when I see people sell, I don't know who they are, so I can't socially attack them if I wanted to. Right now everything is named.
00:45:40.274 - 00:46:18.770, Speaker A: And so you could say like, hey, why'd you sell? That's messed up, right? So I do think there's like this anti Jeet technology, and I know Pump fund is working on this as well, anti Jeep technology. Pump fund is. I think they named it first and I think Pump Fund is working on it as well, who's a startup that's part of our most recent batch, but that's what they labeled it. And I think that's kind of what I'm labeling this as well. For front tech today we have Noah from Pump Fun, who is part of alliance batch number twelve. Noah, what are you working on?
00:46:18.840 - 00:46:28.578, Speaker D: It's essentially a platform which allows anyone to deploy a token in under 20 seconds for less than $2. We're purely meme coin focus right now and are just looking to have some fun on Salana.
00:46:28.594 - 00:46:35.190, Speaker A: Essentially, what's one or two learning moments that you've learned? Building crypto, the most important thing is just building fast.
00:46:35.260 - 00:46:53.422, Speaker D: When we first launched almost a month ago now, we just shipped feature after feature after feature after feature year, and we quickly learned that obviously the majority of these features didn't get any usage. So what we had to do is we had to make features essentially what people wanted. And then we saw those sort of strongly outperform and we're very easily able to tell the ones which sort of were going to work and we're sort of not going to work, if that makes sense.
00:46:53.476 - 00:46:57.858, Speaker A: What are some lessons learned from building in front of with the community out in public?
00:46:57.944 - 00:47:16.870, Speaker D: Honestly, just build fast, add as many new features as possible and then speak to users. Speak to as many users as possible, see what they want. But on the other side of things, I think especially for our product, a lot of our best features, like the common feature and sort of being able to see the Twitter in our order book was purely what we thought was best, what we ourselves would have thought we would want to use.
00:47:16.940 - 00:47:36.160, Speaker A: So it's really just connecting with your users. Exactly. Well, Noah, thank you so much for your time. No worries. So that's kind of the area they're going next. I can't tell you concretely what it's going to look like at the end of the day, but this is his stream of thoughts of what he said to us.
00:47:36.610 - 00:47:41.950, Speaker B: Aside from Frontech, what else are you excited about in the social Phi category?
00:47:42.530 - 00:47:46.210, Speaker A: I mean, have you seen the numbers that they threw out for front tech points?
00:47:46.360 - 00:47:55.926, Speaker B: Like $70 per point. I don't even know how that works, because if we assume one point is.
00:47:55.948 - 00:48:02.006, Speaker A: One token, that's effectively a billion dollar valuation, based on what I've read.
00:48:02.108 - 00:48:04.294, Speaker B: Because billion dollar valuation? At what price?
00:48:04.412 - 00:48:06.054, Speaker C: A dollar? Yeah.
00:48:06.252 - 00:48:15.110, Speaker B: And people are throwing like $70 per point. That's ridiculous. That put it at 70 billion market cap FDB.
00:48:15.190 - 00:48:25.082, Speaker A: I think they're overly bull posting so that people can ape in, ape in. But if Worldcoin hit it, what didn't? Worldcoin hit 100 billion.
00:48:25.226 - 00:48:36.640, Speaker B: Yeah, but with like 1% circulating, what a scam. I think people will get. Well, people will actually lose a lot of money on work one.
00:48:36.950 - 00:48:58.854, Speaker A: Yeah. I don't like the whole low float strategy. I know it's what everyone uses today. I tweeted this out a couple of weeks ago, which is, I'm divulging here a bit, but Synapse is at a 200 million dollar market cap. Across is at a 200 million dollar market cap. But then you have world wormhole at 15 billion market cap. So it's interesting to see all that play out.
00:48:58.854 - 00:49:10.410, Speaker A: I mean, everyone tweeted, it's all liquidity games. You should know this. I'm like, I know, but it's kind of annoying. There's really good, hardworking founders are out there that also deserves some of that value back.
00:49:10.480 - 00:49:11.002, Speaker C: Right.
00:49:11.136 - 00:49:16.714, Speaker A: But yeah, I'm divulging a bit, but yeah. So frontech points apparently is going to be valued very highly.
00:49:16.762 - 00:49:19.966, Speaker B: The market is at one or $2 per point.
00:49:20.068 - 00:49:23.918, Speaker A: On Wales market, the average bid is a dollar $0.11.
00:49:24.014 - 00:49:26.478, Speaker B: So that's a billion dollar FTV.
00:49:26.574 - 00:49:26.978, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:49:27.064 - 00:49:28.980, Speaker A: Which I think is very fair.
00:49:31.350 - 00:49:33.970, Speaker B: Billion dollar FTV with 300 daU.
00:49:36.070 - 00:49:41.206, Speaker A: Look, I think Sisyphus said this best. There is no social fi token to speculate on.
00:49:41.308 - 00:49:42.006, Speaker C: That's right.
00:49:42.108 - 00:50:25.074, Speaker A: So that's just the way it is. Okay, so next one is district one or district zero one, which is kind of like a front tech derivative on blast. So if you're farming blast, from what I hear, from all the tweets I've seen and read, and I've joined the platform, too, they're saying that it's just a bunch of indian users that are using the platform to farm the points. You have to collect the gems, right. And you can message stuff and then you get points and you buy people's keys and message and you collect gems. And apparently most of the activity happens at, like, indian time. So, interesting.
00:50:25.074 - 00:50:36.262, Speaker A: There's fantasy, which I'm obviously very excited about, and I'm farming that very hard. And they're part of alliance. What are your thoughts on fantasy? You saw the team first, so I'm curious to hear your thoughts on it.
00:50:36.316 - 00:51:02.694, Speaker B: I think the team is extremely one of the most creative teams. I found them because they tagged me. So basically they put together a deck of five influencers, right? And then they tweet about it and they would tag each one of them. So they tagged me. So that's how I found out about them. So I reached out to them and chatted and then admitted them to alliance. I thought that was a really creative go to market strategy.
00:51:02.694 - 00:51:22.790, Speaker B: Just targeting, tagging the initial influencers, and then obviously they came to New York, worked out of our co working office, and they would work like 16 hours a day in our office. They're coming to the office before me and then leave around midnight. Extremely hardworking. So I think they're going to kill it.
00:51:22.860 - 00:51:26.950, Speaker A: They have a lot of grit, and that's what you need to win in social fi.
00:51:27.370 - 00:51:35.786, Speaker B: You got to pivot. It's very likely that your first version won't work, so you got to constantly create new versions and try out. It's like building a game.
00:51:35.888 - 00:52:15.826, Speaker A: And to me, if you look at, I mean, I've scoured the web for social, right? I'm in almost every social fi app that's out there, and I put farcast or warpcast loosely in social fi, but this is more crypto native, and I'd say this is more like crypto web, two native. And so I'll loosely put them together. But there's more crypto native, finance based apps. And from all of them, the first unique, zero to one first principles app is Frontech. If you look at every socialify app that's launched, they're all the copy pasta. It's all copy pasta. I haven't seen anything that's unique.
00:52:15.938 - 00:52:21.370, Speaker B: No, but even Frontech is very similar to diesel from 2020.
00:52:21.520 - 00:53:06.626, Speaker A: It is, but it didn't have the messaging concept, which I think is the truly unique value proposition. I used Frontech for a year or whatever, however long it was out. I'll have to say I've made a lot of close friends through my anon groups, and I feel this is true for a lot of people that have used Frontech for a very long period of time. I criticize Racer because I feel like at times, Racer didn't care about users. But I'm glad to see that pivot. In fact, he's giving 100% of the airdrop of the token supply to the community as a fair launch instead of giving any to paradigm, which I thought was very unique. And so from that perspective, okay, there's some copying, right, from diesel, but I think the messaging is where it's kind of unique.
00:53:06.626 - 00:53:26.700, Speaker A: The other one is fantasy, which I think is very unique, very different than all the other social fi apps. So if you ask me, who are the two competitors that if you look at Defi, you think about, I don't know, Aave synthetics, uniswap. Right. If you think about socialify, I probably think of it as.
00:53:28.510 - 00:53:29.690, Speaker C: Warpcast.
00:53:30.050 - 00:53:32.270, Speaker A: Farcaster are the three I would say.
00:53:32.340 - 00:53:33.726, Speaker C: That I would see agree.
00:53:33.828 - 00:53:36.250, Speaker B: So fantasy launch on blast.
00:53:36.330 - 00:53:37.642, Speaker A: Fantasy launch on blast.
00:53:37.706 - 00:53:38.030, Speaker C: Yes.
00:53:38.100 - 00:53:39.970, Speaker A: It's like front tech launch on base, right?
00:53:40.040 - 00:53:40.946, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
00:53:41.128 - 00:53:48.754, Speaker A: So even then, if you think about the political spectrum and the user base, it could be very different and that could be a competitive edge for each other.
00:53:48.872 - 00:53:57.026, Speaker B: Friendtech is very djen. It is like the core user base is very djen. And wasn't there a beef between racer and Jesse?
00:53:57.138 - 00:53:57.846, Speaker C: There was.
00:53:57.948 - 00:54:28.350, Speaker A: So in the chat he said that, well, he called the base community, kind of like Brooklyn elites or. Because, you know, if you think about Racer, racer is a true djen and there is a mismatch of culture and values. And so I do think there was a lot of friction between the two communities, one of which was like, hey, Racer said, I messaged a base group, but they don't even reply back to me. I don't get the support that I'm looking for. That was one thing he mentioned in his chat.
00:54:28.430 - 00:54:30.974, Speaker B: So do you think Fronttech two will launch on Blast?
00:54:31.102 - 00:55:05.166, Speaker A: No, I think it's going to launch on base because yesterday Jesse Pollock, who's you call him like the on chain lead for base or co creator co launcher of base. He put a tweet out that said, I believe in Racer. And then everyone started to, quote, retweet, I believe in racer. So I do think they're going to launch on base and it'll be a core component to the base ecosystem. Yeah, I think it could become an offshoot of a layer three. Or we'll talk about layer threes in the next pod, but some sort of.
00:55:05.188 - 00:55:06.942, Speaker B: Like, I don't want to talk about layer three.
00:55:07.076 - 00:55:10.526, Speaker A: I don't either, but it's apparently becoming a big thing.
00:55:10.628 - 00:55:18.066, Speaker B: That's why I don't want to talk about it. Yeah, because it's full of shit. But anyway, basin blast. Blast launched, right?
00:55:18.168 - 00:55:19.730, Speaker C: Yeah, let's talk about blast.
00:55:20.310 - 00:55:23.810, Speaker B: On the surface, it looks a little bit underwhelming. Do you feel the same?
00:55:23.880 - 00:55:46.742, Speaker A: Here's how I feel. We helped Wasabi launch on blast and so we saw the ins and outs of the blast launch. There's some things they did really well, some things they could have worked on and improved on. What they did really well was bringing the community together, getting the right types of startups to build on there. But there were also a lot of bad actors that came in. Right. And that rugged.
00:55:46.742 - 00:56:08.974, Speaker A: There was a token called risk. Yeah, it's unfortunate, but I think they were building some sort of like betting platform and they called it risk. I forgot what it was. The name was. But the ticker was risk. So people put in aped in like 500 e as a ico sale of some sort, and then he or she rugged the community. So we had a couple of those instances.
00:56:08.974 - 00:56:36.630, Speaker A: But overall, I think it's off to a decent start. Juice is doing really well. I think they have over $100 million in TVL. Wasabi has about 20 million in TVL, and so it's off to a good start. There's a lot of fud around blast when it launched, a lot of fud to the point where I think a lot of users didn't go to blast because of that. But to me, fud around what? The cost of bridging from Ethereum to blast is expensive.
00:56:36.710 - 00:56:37.660, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, sure.
00:56:38.030 - 00:56:46.314, Speaker A: There's so many rugs, just dumb FUD. And a lot of reputable people were part of this FuD.
00:56:46.442 - 00:56:47.754, Speaker B: They didn't get allocation.
00:56:47.882 - 00:57:11.686, Speaker A: Yeah, that's all it was. But I'll say that there's a lot of unique apps that are built on blast that you can't find anywhere else. And I'll give you one example, baseline protocol. I'll give a quick synopsis of what it is. I want to hear your thoughts. Baseline protocol is a protocol where you can launch a token and the price will never drop exponentially. Right.
00:57:11.686 - 00:57:20.666, Speaker A: So you could think of this as kind of like an Ohm 2.0, right. Some of the developers of OhM went to build this.
00:57:20.848 - 00:57:21.434, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:57:21.552 - 00:57:32.766, Speaker A: Now I'll explain how it works. When they launch a token, they will effectively have a single sided pool where they sell the token for cash. Right. So in this case it was.
00:57:32.788 - 00:57:33.262, Speaker C: Yes.
00:57:33.396 - 00:57:50.766, Speaker A: So they did like a single sided sale, and the baseline protocol got some fees from it. They refactored the liquidity debt pools. So there's higher slippage, and the slippage that gets eaten up. The difference of that would go to. Or the delta of that goes to the protocol.
00:57:50.878 - 00:57:51.154, Speaker C: Right.
00:57:51.192 - 00:57:55.950, Speaker A: So every time somebody makes a swap, the protocol earns fees. So now it has a treasury.
00:57:56.030 - 00:57:56.466, Speaker C: Right.
00:57:56.568 - 00:58:28.746, Speaker A: So what it does now is they refactor the amm so that every tick, they add liquidity of its own. So if somebody sells it, it automatically buys and adds some sort of floor price to the actual price of the token. So effectively, there should always be some sort of buyer of last resort every time somebody sells, because they refactored the amm to the point where they pad each tick with some liquidity. So it buys back when it sells. When the sell happens, I'm not surprised.
00:58:28.778 - 00:58:30.558, Speaker B: It comes from the ohm community.
00:58:30.724 - 00:58:36.710, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, my brain was like, I had to read the white paper. I read the white paper. I'm like, so you read the docs?
00:58:36.810 - 00:58:38.190, Speaker B: You actually read the docs?
00:58:38.270 - 00:58:48.914, Speaker A: I read the docs, and then I had to go on Twitter and read people's explanations of it to fully get it. I read the docs, it just didn't click for me.
00:58:48.952 - 00:58:50.158, Speaker B: Did you able into any?
00:58:50.264 - 00:58:52.374, Speaker A: Of course. So this is the cool thing.
00:58:52.492 - 00:58:54.006, Speaker B: And so it never went down.
00:58:54.108 - 00:58:55.446, Speaker C: So here's the thing.
00:58:55.548 - 00:59:27.554, Speaker A: So that's one element of it, right. The other element is that it also has a built in lending pool, lending market. So once you buy. Yes, you could collateralize it and borrow ETH, and then you could leverage loop continuously so you could buy ETH, you could get ETH, and the lending protocol takes a fee out of it. Right? I don't know. I did some ETH and it took zero point 25 ETH. So I leverage looped and the protocol makes money.
00:59:27.554 - 00:59:29.010, Speaker A: It eats up the money.
00:59:29.080 - 00:59:29.458, Speaker C: Right.
00:59:29.544 - 00:59:54.842, Speaker A: So this is how it works. From what I've seen over the past two weeks, you could earn a lot of blast points from doing this loop. Right. But if there's enough flow of buyers coming in, the price goes up only. But once it stops, once the buyers net, new buyers stop, the price drops 10%, but it just stays there and it'll slowly, like, you see the prices go up very slowly. Right.
00:59:54.976 - 00:59:56.938, Speaker B: So the price can go down.
00:59:57.024 - 01:00:28.450, Speaker A: It can go down, but it's not like, by a lot. Because if you have 10% of buyers, that this is what happens once it goes up to a certain price point, you see so many sales, they'll bring effectively the price down 10%, but then it starts to go back right up. So, yes, it does. But then there's protection, downside protection. So the protocol will slowly start to eat that up again. It's a very different, unique protocol that I've never seen before. So here's what I think.
01:00:28.450 - 01:00:40.218, Speaker A: It's going to become the liquidity black hole on blast, and I could see this thing eating up so much money. This is not financial advice. I did it as an experiment. I'm not going to go all in on this thing.
01:00:40.304 - 01:00:41.334, Speaker C: When did it launch?
01:00:41.462 - 01:00:43.500, Speaker A: It launched like the day of.
01:00:44.350 - 01:00:47.370, Speaker B: How much protocol revenue has it generated?
01:00:47.710 - 01:00:49.558, Speaker A: Let's see. I haven't checked.
01:00:49.654 - 01:00:50.398, Speaker C: I hope.
01:00:50.484 - 01:00:51.258, Speaker A: Blast.
01:00:51.434 - 01:00:52.286, Speaker C: Here we go.
01:00:52.388 - 01:01:11.886, Speaker A: Blast. Baseline has $25 million in TvL as we speak. It hasn't talked about fees. It's how much borrowed, 50 million borrowed USD inflow. It doesn't show how much fees is earned, but, yeah. So I think baseline is like an interesting protocol. You have thruster.
01:01:11.886 - 01:01:30.534, Speaker A: That's an AMM. You have juice protocol. That's a lending market that's offering pretty attractive yields. And then wasabi, what I think is like an NFT, eRc, 20 perps. But overall, I think it went decent. It could have gone better. Pacman knows this.
01:01:30.534 - 01:02:01.650, Speaker A: He's working on it. Updating the API so that people can provide the yield, the accurate yield for developers so they can put it on their website for earning blast gold. I think there's a lot of interesting products that are being built. There's meme coins that have launched on there. The two or three that I can mention is like Mia, which is the bonk for know your favorite one, blast toys. If you guys don't know what blastoise is, it's a Pokemon character.
01:02:04.150 - 01:02:04.466, Speaker C: Okay?
01:02:04.488 - 01:02:15.686, Speaker B: So it goes charizard. Charizard greater than. Blastoise, greater than. What's that thing again? It's not bulbasaur. What's the third one? Oh, my God.
01:02:15.708 - 01:02:21.350, Speaker A: I can't remember it. Top Pokemon characters. I've been so out of the loop.
01:02:21.430 - 01:02:23.702, Speaker B: The third evolution of bulbasaur.
01:02:23.766 - 01:02:26.086, Speaker A: Oh, Ivysaur.
01:02:26.118 - 01:02:36.330, Speaker B: Ivysaur, no, venusaur. Venusaur, yes. Venosaur. Venosaur is the third evolution. So it goes charizard, greater than. Blastoise. Greater than Venusaur.
01:02:36.410 - 01:02:40.270, Speaker A: My God. When I used to see my friends with charizard, I would die.
01:02:41.730 - 01:02:56.306, Speaker B: But speaking of blastoise, I'm just surprised that the front page of Dex Greener is not dominated by blast meme coins. I would have expected it to be on par with Solana, but that didn't happen.
01:02:56.408 - 01:03:12.970, Speaker A: I think my bullishness got ahead of me thinking that memecoin, because the right community is there, that the meme coins would launch. But it turns out, like taking a step back, I've realized that I was wrong, because the Djen community and the retail community are two different communities.
01:03:17.390 - 01:03:21.818, Speaker B: So you're saying Solana is retail and blast is djen?
01:03:21.914 - 01:03:23.374, Speaker C: Yes. Interesting.
01:03:23.572 - 01:03:31.130, Speaker A: I didn't put two and two together until after the fact. And because of that, it's just two different, very different communities.
01:03:31.290 - 01:03:31.758, Speaker C: Right.
01:03:31.844 - 01:03:39.682, Speaker A: Solana is a retail chain, and blast is a dgen chain for whales, crypto natives, and whales. Okay.
01:03:39.736 - 01:03:43.774, Speaker B: The distinction is crypto natives versus the non natives.
01:03:43.902 - 01:03:45.558, Speaker C: Yeah, I can see that.
01:03:45.644 - 01:04:02.214, Speaker A: And that's why you and I are so aligned with both, because retail is where new flow money comes in, which gives us great new insight into user behavior. And blast gives us new insight into crypto natives.
01:04:02.342 - 01:04:02.634, Speaker C: Right.
01:04:02.672 - 01:04:14.854, Speaker A: Those are the two things that I align with so. Well, obviously base has some really cool stuff and some of the other layer twos have some really cool stuff, but yeah. So that's where I would say blast is.
01:04:14.992 - 01:04:16.270, Speaker C: All right, great.
01:04:16.340 - 01:04:25.054, Speaker A: So I think we're at time. Thanks for tuning in. If you have any thoughts, feedback, or anything else, hit us up on Twitter DMs. Thanks for watching.
