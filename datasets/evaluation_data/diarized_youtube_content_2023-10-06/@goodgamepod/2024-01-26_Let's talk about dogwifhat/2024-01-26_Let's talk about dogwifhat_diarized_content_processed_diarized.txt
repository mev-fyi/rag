00:00:00.120 - 00:00:14.794, Speaker A: Why don't we talk about with I think. I mean, we have the hats on. Almost every other tweet these days is about wiff. I sent out a tweet maybe six months ago, and the tweet was like, the harder I left, the more I buy. This was one of those moments.
00:00:15.814 - 00:00:19.398, Speaker UNK: This was the funniest meme since bald for me. But bald, rugged.
00:00:19.446 - 00:00:25.246, Speaker A: Bald would have been great, but they rugged, unfortunately. But yeah, I'd say this is probably the best meme since Bald.
00:00:25.350 - 00:00:48.322, Speaker UNK: My original thesis was that Ansem is the main character of the cycle and with is his pet. That was the original thesis. But as time went on, I realized how scalable this meme is. Like, literally, it's vampire attacking every PFP, every other meme. Like, I don't know if you saw the Phantom logo, a bunch of other project logos putting the hat on. Right.
00:00:48.378 - 00:00:55.754, Speaker A: The hat itself can extend to any meme possible, right? Which adds to the virality of the actual meme itself, which I thought was great.
