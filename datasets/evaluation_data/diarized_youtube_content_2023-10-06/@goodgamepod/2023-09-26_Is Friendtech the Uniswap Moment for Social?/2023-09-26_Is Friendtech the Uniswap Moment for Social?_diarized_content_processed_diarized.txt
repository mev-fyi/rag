00:00:00.250 - 00:00:17.454, Speaker A: Welcome to good game, your no BS Insights for crypto founders. Why is friend Tech so exciting? I mean, we talked a bit about it. Why do we think this is the uniswap moment for Defi, but for social?
00:00:17.572 - 00:00:37.542, Speaker B: By the way, this room is actually the contrarian because everywhere I go, like in real life, when I talk to people in those crypto conferences and ask them, what do you think of Frantech? They're all bearish, every single we're still early. Everyone talks about Frantech, but no one is bullish. So this room is actually the bullish room.
00:00:37.596 - 00:00:58.638, Speaker A: Looking for your next startup idea in crypto? Check out our request for startups list and get inspired at forward slash ideas. Welcome to good game. Today we're going to be talking about Fronttech, and we have two guests with us, and they're from Manifold, if you're deep into Frontech. So why don't you guys give a quick intro?
00:00:58.804 - 00:01:35.370, Speaker C: Yeah, sounds good. So my name is Eric Chang. I'm one of the gps at Manifold Ventures. First got into crypto more along the lines of the regulatory route. Was advising a lot of crypto asset managers and vcs about SEC and state regulations, worked with a lot of regulators and kind of describing to them what crypto is and why my clients deserve to get RIA registrations. Over time, I actually switched on over to the investing side, working alongside certain accelerators and also vcs. Prior to joining Manifold, I was also VP at Wave digital assets, where I was helping to oversee their early stage venture practice.
00:01:35.710 - 00:01:36.122, Speaker A: Cool.
00:01:36.176 - 00:02:16.934, Speaker D: I'm Jay. I got into crypto in around 2017, mostly on the white hat hacking side. Crypto is a great playground because you could go to each protocol and a lot of them copied each other's code. So you could basically find the vulnerability in one thing and then use it everywhere else. During the heat of 2018 and EOS, when EOS was the third biggest market cap, I also managed to find a vulnerability there, and I was paid to not exploit these types of protocols. And then I ran validators for a bit. So kind of like mining altcoins essentially was thankfully earning passive income through that during the bear market.
00:02:16.934 - 00:03:08.710, Speaker D: So I could get pretty aggressive trading and investing into a lot of projects and majors and just accumulate and then, yeah, just right place, right time. During the bull caught DFI, caught nfts, started a fund manifold. Early 2021, we ran liquid trading. So mostly market neutral, pure art market making strategies, which has now become a prop trading fund. So we run our own balance sheet and our own money, and then recently started a venture fund under Manifold as well, specifically to invest into precede seed early stage companies in crypto. And we see a lot more investable companies now where founders who are currently in the space during the deep bear really believe in the tech, believe in what they're building and have resilience. And there's a lot more noise during a bull market.
00:03:08.710 - 00:03:12.854, Speaker D: And I think right now is a great time to invest in these types of projects.
00:03:12.982 - 00:03:53.350, Speaker A: 100% agreed. So Frontech has been on my mind probably 85% of the time now for the past three past month now. And I'm assuming there is a core group of people that are also experiencing what I'm experiencing. And typically when this happens, we know that there is something special, similar to like, chow. I'm going to quote you when I say this, but you said this where when you use Aave, it was like a magical experience. Right. And I feel like what we're going through with Frontek is also a magical experience because there's so many different layers that we can unpack.
00:03:53.350 - 00:04:15.920, Speaker A: And so I guess let's talk about our feedback or just like, what we thought of Frontech when it first launched. I think that's, like, a good place to start. When it first launched, how did you feel about it and when did you sign up? What was your thesis? By signing up, and then we can all go around the room and just kind of talk about what happened there.
00:04:16.370 - 00:04:41.506, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, for me, I was in a group chat. Well, I'm in a group chat with one of those CT type group chats where there's a ton of people. And Kobe was like, have you guys heard about Friendtech? And I responded, no. And he's like, wow, we're so. Oh, interesting. So that's how I first heard about it. And then some guys dropped invite codes on that telegram group chat.
00:04:41.506 - 00:04:48.390, Speaker D: So I copied it, and then I got on the platform. Back then, all these guys were trading very low.
00:04:48.540 - 00:04:48.950, Speaker C: Right.
00:04:49.020 - 00:04:56.442, Speaker D: And I loaded up like two e or something to just play around with it. Back then, you would have to bridge to base for.
00:04:56.496 - 00:04:57.690, Speaker A: And was this on the first day?
00:04:57.760 - 00:05:07.390, Speaker D: This wasn't on the first day. It might have been like a couple of days. Yeah. First week for sure. Yeah. So I get on and I bought some stuff. I bought Suzu.
00:05:07.390 - 00:05:08.526, Speaker D: Good.
00:05:08.548 - 00:05:09.342, Speaker A: Contrarian bet.
00:05:09.396 - 00:05:10.480, Speaker D: Yeah, it's just.
00:05:11.570 - 00:05:14.094, Speaker A: Is it consensus now? Yeah, that's why he's going down.
00:05:14.212 - 00:05:31.142, Speaker D: It was like a meme bet. Plus, I think I bought Kobe, and then I just afk, because back then there wasn't that much activity and then it picked up a bit and so I chatted a little bit and then we actually looked into the arbitrage side of things.
00:05:31.196 - 00:05:32.120, Speaker A: Right, wow.
00:05:32.730 - 00:05:34.082, Speaker D: Looked at sniping.
00:05:34.226 - 00:05:36.854, Speaker A: Nice. Looked at arbitrage with what?
00:05:36.972 - 00:06:15.566, Speaker D: Well, I mean, sniping is somewhat of an arb if you're sniping and you just sell into the bonding curve. And then there was other things, like people were building the fractions. So fractionalized keys through velocity. We do a lot of pure arb cross venue on CFI to DFI. So we're tapped into all types of amms, like uniswap, solidly curve balancer forks, everything. Right. So we could quickly integrate that and be able to run fractions versus key arb.
00:06:15.566 - 00:06:23.110, Speaker D: Only issue is that the trading fees are too high, so it's like you need to wait for a massive dislocation to ever hit an arm.
00:06:23.610 - 00:06:25.426, Speaker A: This was when sysphus launched his token.
00:06:25.458 - 00:06:45.178, Speaker D: Right, right, yeah, exactly. So we were looking at all those opportunities and just playing around with it, really. Like testing, using my account as a test actually to do a lot of stuff. So a lot of people, sometimes my docs main personal account, people ask, why does it say you have like 900 holding right keys?
00:06:45.274 - 00:06:46.714, Speaker A: It was literally because sniping.
00:06:46.762 - 00:07:04.242, Speaker D: There was one day where I just tried a bunch of stuff like random scripts that we were running just to play around and. Yeah, so that's sort of how we got into friendeg. But for like two weeks, we were very inactive afterwards. Know the activity kind of died for a did.
00:07:04.376 - 00:07:09.494, Speaker A: There's a lot of scares. This was before paradigm announced their raise. Yeah, I remember this div.
00:07:09.612 - 00:07:32.746, Speaker D: And yeah, didn't have that much conviction in front tech specifically. I thought that it was really interesting. Social fi was something that I was fascinated by, but wasn't fully convinced that Friendtech was going to be that thing. So I put in a lot of work into launching Cl's account. Right, but after launching it.
00:07:32.768 - 00:07:33.374, Speaker A: Oh, I remember that.
00:07:33.412 - 00:07:39.200, Speaker D: Yeah, Cl deleted it and then we both afK'd from Friendtech after that for over like a week or two.
00:07:39.810 - 00:07:53.700, Speaker A: I didn't snipe Cl because he deleted the app. Rest in peace. Now it's like four e chow. Yeah. What about you?
00:07:54.390 - 00:08:00.440, Speaker B: First week I just mix curved. I was like, this is just big cloud 2.0.
00:08:01.130 - 00:08:05.302, Speaker A: But funny enough, you were one of the first ones to use big cloud.
00:08:05.436 - 00:08:07.874, Speaker B: Yes, but that's why I have PDF.
00:08:08.002 - 00:08:08.680, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:08:09.130 - 00:08:32.062, Speaker B: I can explain the difference between. So later on I realized some of the key differences between big cloud and friendtech. But we can dive into that later. But first week I made curved, but I still played around with it. Then paradigm, they announced that paradigm investment. And then that was another run up. So I just aped in FoMod and then did.
00:08:32.062 - 00:09:03.718, Speaker B: Well, that was the second wave. And then that again died for maybe a week. But that week I started thinking about some of the ways to view friend tag. So you can view friendag as for example, I don't know if you guys have heard of GLG. This company called GLG. What they do is it's like an information network where people share alphas with each other. So the typical users are corporate, so they just fish information from each other.
00:09:03.718 - 00:09:30.594, Speaker B: So I viewed Friendtech as sort of information network back then. But later on I just realized the top groups on Frantech, they were all bullshit. The content in those groups are total garbage. There's no way people are paying six e's for that kind of alpha. The Alpha is worthless. So it's not really an information network. Frantic can't evolve into that, but it is not that yet.
00:09:30.594 - 00:09:58.540, Speaker B: And I started thinking about some other ways to view Frantech. Started viewing frontech as more of a game because all the three three stuff happening, for those who don't know, three three is like, if you own my key, I'm going to buy your key. And so that everyone has a bunch of keys so we can farm the airdrops together, et cetera, et cetera. And there's a bunch of other games that happen later on. We can talk about them as well. So I started viewing frantic as a game. What else is there?
00:09:59.150 - 00:10:04.270, Speaker A: There's Pepe. We can talk about Pepe as well. I giga aped Pepe.
00:10:06.050 - 00:10:44.554, Speaker B: So Frontech is a game. But importantly, Frantech is also one of the most successful attempts at bootstrapping on chain identity. It's not the first time we've managed to do this, but it's one of the most successful ways in which we, as an industry attached real world identity, meaning the Twitter identity, to the onchain address. So from there, I don't know what it's going to be, but there's going to be a lot of different games built on top of this identity network. So that's another way to view Frantech. But very interesting. That week where Frantech died, I started thinking about these things.
00:10:44.554 - 00:10:54.590, Speaker B: And then the third wave. The third wave was when they started announcing the airdrop. That was another huge wave. But sort of the history.
00:10:54.740 - 00:11:31.494, Speaker A: Yeah, for me, I giga ape the first day and my thesis was pretty simple. It's the social layer for crypto. And primarily, it was obviously very risky. But I just bought Xerox Racer. And my thesis was, if you look at Tom from Myspace, if you remember those days, he was the most followed person, and he was one of the founders of Myspace. If you look at Mark Zuckerberg, he's one of the most top five followed individuals on Facebook. And my thesis was like Elon on Twitter, and Elon and Twitter, Dan Romero.
00:11:31.542 - 00:11:35.142, Speaker B: On Farcaster, it's always the founder that's the number, 100% followers.
00:11:35.206 - 00:12:10.962, Speaker A: So ended up betting big on Xerox Racer and a little bit on shrimp and a couple of others, and then just started to use a product. And what was interesting about it was the fact that the product itself, it just hooked me, meaning that I started talking to other people. I started to get some alpha from some of these chat groups, not all. There was one or two chats where I started to get real insights. And then I started to look for opportunities. I'm like, well, wow, this is pretty cool. And I started to go deeper into the front tech ecosystem, and I came across the three three network.
00:12:10.962 - 00:12:43.210, Speaker A: And I'll talk a bit more about this later on. But it's led by many people. But some people that come to mind are like Luke Zero x Breadman, makesy future, and Cyi are like the four or five people that are kind of like top of the funnel. And the idea is pretty simple. It's like, you buy me, I buy you, right? But I think goes deeper than that. And I would call this the phase two of three. Three from the original OHM 33, where it kind of first launched.
00:12:43.210 - 00:13:18.838, Speaker A: And the primary idea is like, hey, if I buy you, you buy me. We're going to farm the points that come within the ecosystem. You help my key price, I help your key price, it keeps it elevated. But you're joining this community, and we'll talk a bit more about this. But I feel like this is an emerging cult that's being built on Frontech. So I agree with your thesis chow, which is I think there's going to be many different metas, and one of the emerging metas is like this three, then there's going to be different games being built, and then social layer and et cetera. How about you? What are some things that maybe your first reaction?
00:13:19.014 - 00:14:06.774, Speaker C: Yeah, definitely. When I first downloaded my friendtech account and kind of eased into it, I was really interested in just kind of looking at what the onboarding process was like. What are the kind of mechanics that are built into the app as well. Got a manifold key started, got some of my own keys as well. And what I was really interested in is just how sticky and effective the app was in terms of value creation. There's still a lot of debate right now versus the speculative versus the true utility value of a platform such as Friendtech, right? But whether you like it or not, you can't dispute the fact that it's a very effective form of value creation. Right now, within a month in, there's like millions of TVL, millions of protocol inflows in terms of capital, and a lot of that is being redistributed over to the creators.
00:14:06.774 - 00:14:42.630, Speaker C: And despite the value add that some creators might be able to actually have interacting with people talking about my own chat room, or looking at the people talking in Manifold's chat rooms, there are people that are actually genuinely interested in the stuff that we're working on, people actually genuinely interested in sharing alpha as well. So I see friendtech in the future perhaps as a very effective template, perhaps like a really good building block for other applications to kind of build upon, for them to iterate upon, for them to see what are other great ways for facilitating value creation for creators.
00:14:43.610 - 00:14:59.420, Speaker A: Maybe this is a good segue into why is friend tech so exciting? I mean, we talked a bit about it. Why do we think this is the uniswap moment for DeFi, but for social? Why is that, by the way?
00:15:00.270 - 00:15:18.706, Speaker B: This room is actually the contrarian? Because everywhere I go, like in real life, when I talk to people in those crypto conferences and I ask them, what do you think of frantic? They're all bearish, every single, we're still early. Everyone talks about frantic, but no one is bullish. So this room is actually the bullish room.
00:15:18.808 - 00:16:17.958, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of things, I think, that come into play. There's the game component, and then there's the real value creation component. I'm not fully convinced if there's going to be long term value created, unless I see hard evidence of that in the coming months. Right now there's this whole incentive of the future speculation on those incentives that's causing certain behavioral aspects of the platform, which is in part driving growth, which could go away if the incentives were not there. And so, like true PMF is, if the incentives weaken, will people still continue to behave and use the platform like they do now? But I think one really big aspect that I saw when onboarding people, right, because as manifold we've been doing snipe prevention. And the first couple of times we did it, we went on video call with each person and helped them launch it live, right? And it's really funny because can you.
00:16:17.964 - 00:16:19.410, Speaker A: Name a few folks that you helped launch?
00:16:19.490 - 00:16:38.550, Speaker D: Yeah. So we helped Cl, we help shill Ivy. Danny Beanstalk. We helped base jackers Yatsu, the CEO of Animoka. So a lot of large accounts, right? And these are all like fully grown adults. And you see them on the video call. We run the bot, and then boom, it hits.
00:16:38.550 - 00:17:00.754, Speaker D: They launch snipe prevented. And immediately normal users start buying into them, right? And they see their account move up in the trading fees. Like, they refresh it, and it's like, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. People are going on their chat, going like, hey, welcome to friend tech, asking them questions, and you see this big smile on their face. Like a baby. Literally like a baby. And it's the magic experience.
00:17:00.754 - 00:17:09.734, Speaker D: Yeah, it's the magic experience. The dopamine hit is immediate and keeps coming, right? If your key price is going down, it's like maybe the other way.
00:17:09.852 - 00:17:10.386, Speaker B: Cortisol.
00:17:10.418 - 00:17:11.000, Speaker D: Right?
00:17:11.530 - 00:17:15.062, Speaker A: I take it very personally, but, yeah, people care.
00:17:15.116 - 00:17:36.238, Speaker D: And it's like some of these guys maybe have nine figure net worth, maybe more, right? But someone dumping their keys for a couple of grand on the high end is very tilting for them. And it's crazy, right? Technically, they could just buy it up themselves, but that's also kind of against your ego because you don't want to be that guy.
00:17:36.324 - 00:17:37.726, Speaker A: Like, you're repeating yourself, right?
00:17:37.748 - 00:17:53.102, Speaker D: Yeah, exactly. That's like a bit of the magic moment that I saw when I saw these guys immediately as the app loads, they're like, whoa. And it's like, okay, there's something here. There's something here that makes me excited.
00:17:53.166 - 00:18:12.822, Speaker A: So touching on that. When there is an active price that's attached to your reputation, they're fully invested in it. Right. I feel like that's what happens, and that's all they care about and think about. And so there was a funny video. This guy named K Money. He comes up with, like, funny videos, and he made a 32nd skit.
00:18:12.822 - 00:18:50.418, Speaker A: And in 32nd skit, he was talking about how he had front tack, he had a key, and he went to sleep for 2 hours. And while he was sleeping, everyone dumped his token because he wasn't engaging. Then he woke up and started trying to engage with his audience. Right. And something special there is happening, right? Which is like, now people are worried of going to sleep or not engaging as much with their audience. And I considered this similar to a comedian or an actor that's acting or giving jokes in front of a live audience, if you're not giving a joke, a good joke, or if you're not engaging your audience, you're going to get a red tomato in your face. Right? And that's essentially what's happening on the Internet.
00:18:50.514 - 00:19:36.242, Speaker C: Right. I think what's interesting is that financial incentive or just wanting to hold value within your own key is also just like a good mechanism for spurring just value adds from creators themselves, right? It's always a two sided market. We're always talking about engagement from the fans and the users, but the creators themselves also have to put out a certain number of amount of effort in order to engage their audience. Right? And that financial incentive is quite interesting. I can kind of see this in the future. Something, perhaps friendtech, perhaps something like friendtech supplementing a lot of the traditional social media platforms that we use today. I think a lot of the chat room phenomenon, like the magic that Jay mentioned, it's very similar, for example, to Reddit Amas, right? Like for some young thug, hosted like an AMA room or something.
00:19:36.242 - 00:20:15.886, Speaker C: People were asking questions or like, I don't know, Bernie Sanders or whoever. This is one of those rare moments where you're actually able to kind of interact with people that you are perhaps fascinated by or admire in the crypto space and actually speak to them in a room. And then that financial incentive also kind of pushes the creator to kind of talk to people that are engaging with them. And perhaps in the future, it's a lot different from a more casual format compared to Twitter or X, for example. I can kind of see how frontech will always kind of be that kind of more monetizable kind of supplements to a more casual, underlying social media layer.
00:20:15.998 - 00:20:29.160, Speaker A: Agreed. I see it as, like, the top 1%. Right? I think all of the social networks will still continue to thrive, but there will be, like, that 1% where you can actually connect with the creator themselves.
00:20:29.690 - 00:20:36.920, Speaker B: Is friendtech really a social network? Is it fundamentally a social network, or is there something else?
00:20:37.770 - 00:20:39.290, Speaker A: Define social network.
00:20:40.270 - 00:20:43.754, Speaker B: A network where people socialize with each other.
00:20:43.952 - 00:20:47.994, Speaker A: And in this case, it has elements of, it has elements of that, for sure.
00:20:48.032 - 00:20:57.070, Speaker B: But is it fundamentally that what it is today? I think it's fundamentally meme coin exchange. It's a shitcoin exchange.
00:20:57.650 - 00:21:01.520, Speaker A: Well, I mean, anything that first starts, will start off looking.
00:21:02.050 - 00:21:09.378, Speaker D: I disagree with that, though. A shitcoin exchange, when you hold a shitcoin, it's really easy to dump it, right?
00:21:09.464 - 00:21:09.762, Speaker B: Okay.
00:21:09.816 - 00:21:36.730, Speaker D: It's not linked to your identity. There are very different connotations, I think, between buying and selling something on front tech, versus buying and selling a shitcoin, there's coin trading is purely about profiting off of a trade, right? Versus, I think, on front tech, it's a little different. Like, during this week, you meet someone and they're on frontech and you go, yo, let's buy each other's keys, right? And you don't do that with shitcoins.
00:21:37.710 - 00:21:39.930, Speaker B: You buy people's keys because you want to meet them.
00:21:40.000 - 00:21:45.114, Speaker D: No, we just hang out. You meet someone and they're like, oh.
00:21:45.152 - 00:21:46.250, Speaker B: Let'S buy each other's keys.
00:21:46.330 - 00:22:11.000, Speaker D: Yeah, stuff like that, right. There's real life social elements, even that come out of this. Is friendtech going to succeed solely on the social network side? Probably not. It's a pretty shitty platform, if that's the main value proposition, in my opinion. But I think it's inherently different from shitcoin casinos. And I actually did want to talk more about the three three component of it. Yes.
00:22:11.000 - 00:22:16.550, Speaker D: So, ohm, right, which all of us know very well and dearly.
00:22:17.210 - 00:22:18.002, Speaker A: Rest in peace.
00:22:18.066 - 00:23:27.914, Speaker D: Yeah, rest in peace. Ohm was a token. And sure, there was this whole community aspect where everyone was putting like three three on their twitter and all of that, which honestly did help a lot in terms of getting more people involved and the Ponzi going longer and longer. But I think one massive element to ohm is that it is, at the end of the day, a shitcoin where it's not really linked to your identity, so you don't feel bad dumping. And the prisoner's dilemma, the defector, will win. Right? So in frontech scenario, if you just viewed it as a simple prisoner's dilemma game, this ends up crashing and burning to death, right? Three three will not work long term. But I thought about it more and I was like, is it really just a pure prisoner's dilemma? I don't know if it is, because, one, your identity is linked to what you're holding, and if you care about your reputation, if you care about your identity, and the fact that everybody can see the decisions you're making live if you're to sell, even though your monetary gain.
00:23:27.914 - 00:23:58.230, Speaker D: So let's say if your utility is purely monetary, it's still prisoner's dilemma. But the whole social aspect actually kind of changes the utility graphs a little bit, where the punishment you get is not only monetary, it's actually social, where all your friends get angry at you or people on Twitter start talking shit about you. And that's a backlash that actually plays into this graph a lot and makes you think, is it actually prisoner's dilemma now? Yeah.
00:23:58.380 - 00:24:10.410, Speaker B: I think I know why we have different experiences. Because you use your real name account. I use my a on. But for me, my only incentive is to make money. I don't care about social stuff. But you do because you use your real name.
00:24:10.480 - 00:24:11.146, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:24:11.328 - 00:24:36.606, Speaker A: So early on I started doing with my docs account. I did three and then I ended up dumping a few folks that are well known and turns out in other accounts I run, they're all talking about me. Imran, just. But something important, something special is happening here, right, which is I'm like shit now. People think I'm a defector.
00:24:36.718 - 00:24:37.880, Speaker D: Did you feel bad?
00:24:38.250 - 00:25:05.230, Speaker A: Not really, no, not. Well, I mean, a little bit, right. But that's just because of the power of the network. It is today, now, let's say a year from now, two years from now. The power of duty network is such that there's other services. That's part of it, right. Let's just say it becomes a very strong community, like the NFT communities where they do events, they provide each other help or support, reputation, all of that, right.
00:25:05.230 - 00:25:24.210, Speaker A: If the network becomes stronger, then yes, absolutely. I would feel like crap. I would never want to leave that community, right. But right now that community doesn't offer me any value, so I just dumped it, right? But now they're talking about me and now I feel bad. And that's the type of conversation I'm having versus like, just dumping dogecoin or Harry Potter.
00:25:25.030 - 00:25:29.842, Speaker B: So you would feel bad if you dump nft that you don't.
00:25:29.906 - 00:25:30.854, Speaker A: I don't feel bad.
00:25:30.972 - 00:25:32.280, Speaker B: Do you guys feel bad?
00:25:32.810 - 00:25:33.878, Speaker D: No, not at all.
00:25:33.964 - 00:25:34.870, Speaker C: Not really, no.
00:25:34.940 - 00:25:46.394, Speaker A: Because you're not tied to the creator, right. And no one really knows who you are, right. And so you just dump it. Blurbids probably mock your brother, but right.
00:25:46.432 - 00:26:02.720, Speaker D: Now, after hanging out with you guys and let's say I own his key, right, I would feel bad if I ever wanted to dump it. It would be one of the last things I would dump. So there is the social element to it. You don't want to dump your friends, you're just going to hold it.
00:26:04.550 - 00:26:33.818, Speaker A: Part of me, I'm OCD with my chats. So with my docs account, all of our alliance crew, we bought each other's chats, right? Or keys. I ended up dumping everyone because I wanted a clean chat and then they all dumped me and I felt bad. I'm like, so then I bought them back because you work with them and I don't want to disrespect them. So I bought them back. So I get what you mean by that. So there is like a personal attachment with people that you've built the relationship.
00:26:33.904 - 00:26:43.234, Speaker B: Okay. This is really important. This is a fundamentally new behavior. I didn't realize until just now, because I've always used my. So this is a fundamentally new behavior.
00:26:43.302 - 00:26:44.240, Speaker D: That's very interesting.
00:26:44.690 - 00:27:15.800, Speaker A: Should we dive deeper into three three? Because I feel like there's a lot of things to unpack there. I guess maybe starting with why do we think this three three that's coming can actually be a guarded ponzi? Is that the right term? Because it's kind of like a ponzi. Right. Like you're buying each other, but there's now reputation attached and identity attached. Right. So I feel like there's kind of like, guardrails in place that prevents it from exploding. Right.
00:27:15.800 - 00:27:29.898, Speaker A: It can still happen. Meaning, like, mass defections have happened. Right. But I feel like the impact will be lower than the impact that, let's say, ohm had. So let's talk a bit more about the three three movement here.
00:27:29.984 - 00:27:51.154, Speaker D: Yeah. So going off of what I talked about earlier, where this might not be a pure prisoners dilemma type of game set up anymore due to different utilities and different incentives coming into play. But another thing is, Cl actually wrote about this in his blog post on Eagle Capital, like a couple months ago.
00:27:51.192 - 00:27:52.286, Speaker A: Retardfi.
00:27:52.478 - 00:27:53.874, Speaker D: Yes, I read that.
00:27:53.912 - 00:27:55.474, Speaker A: It's a good article. We talked about it.
00:27:55.512 - 00:28:05.250, Speaker D: Yeah, long scams. And, you know, there's a graph at the bottom of that blog which talks about a bit more about society and behavior.
00:28:05.330 - 00:28:05.526, Speaker A: Yes.
00:28:05.548 - 00:28:33.760, Speaker D: Right. Yes. When you have a small group of size seven or less, you can have an anarchy, and it's fine. People will not defect and do bad things to each other. Right. Now, if your group size starts going from seven to even 913 and forward, you see a massive spike in the rate of people that defect or do bad things or unlawful things that we would think are unlawful. Right.
00:28:34.370 - 00:28:37.602, Speaker A: Just because of network effects. Like, just so many people, there's more people.
00:28:37.656 - 00:28:47.282, Speaker D: And basically it's kind of like tragedy of the commons, where if you do a bad thing, there's no backlash to you, there's no punishment to you, but your utility increases.
00:28:47.346 - 00:28:47.526, Speaker A: Right.
00:28:47.548 - 00:29:28.850, Speaker D: Okay. And so society controls this by putting in punishments for people that are bad actors. Right. In order to incentivize good behavior. But the study basically showed that if you only punish the actual defectors, the rate of cooperation of society still is not that high. It still diminishes massively as n increases the number of people in the society. But if you start punishing defectors as well as the bystanders that don't do anything about the defectors, then your rate of cooperation massively increases, right, within this society.
00:29:28.850 - 00:30:01.190, Speaker D: And I think maybe friendtech could have something like that of a society where you've got groups, right, police, and the whole group goes, wow, this guy cheated his keys, right? When we were all trying to, three, three. They all want to punish him by everyone selling on him, right? And that's the punishment. And then you might actually get this type of effect where you have a society where the bystanders also get punished if they don't do something about the defectors, the defectors get punished. And then the rate of cooperation starts increasing further.
00:30:01.270 - 00:30:01.658, Speaker A: Right.
00:30:01.744 - 00:30:05.440, Speaker D: Even if they don't want to be, increases exponentially. Yeah. Interesting.
00:30:05.890 - 00:31:10.322, Speaker C: I've been kind of thinking about these social dynamics a lot recently too. It's just, not to get too philosophical, but Nietzsche talked a lot about human relationships and how the core of that is actually the relationship between the creditor and debtor, right. It's a very financial driven relationship that kind of drives a lot of the hierarchical structures that we live in today. And Frontech is just kind of a really interesting kind of like social experiment, that concept of three three, where she's like, I'm going into this type of financial commitment with you as my friend or someone that I have faith in to kind of generate value. So if one of us kind of teach each other's keys, then it's kind of like almost kind of like a loss of faith in your counterpart, right? And then you're kind of breaking that kind of trust. And then from there it'll be interesting to kind of see what kinds of socially constructed kind of rules or games are going to be kind of created on top, right? I even saw on CT people coming out with infographics like friend tech commandments. It's just like, oh, we won't judge someone if you cheat your friend or whatever.
00:31:10.322 - 00:31:20.920, Speaker C: That kind of like copium, right? But there's just going to start to be a lot of that kind of like people are already building commandments right off of such a month old app, right?
00:31:21.850 - 00:32:06.726, Speaker A: Yeah. I see this as like a reputation layer, right? There's obviously the end state of how communities are going to self organize and police each other in a certain way. But I also think that this is a starting of a reputation system that's on chain and it's directly attached to your identity. And it's going to be primarily, it may start with just defecting, but it can start to add other layers based on what your on chain activity is. And so I was talking to Cl about this, and I was talking to him about this reputation system. He goes, yeah, right. Now, if somebody asked me to borrow money, I don't know this person, so I'm not going to let them borrow any money.
00:32:06.726 - 00:32:33.790, Speaker A: But maybe if somebody had a defection score, had a history of no defections, four years, let's say, on chain, I might let them borrow some money. Then that got me thinking, like, I wonder if this could be a start to something new, right? Maybe some sort of like, we're always talking about a credit like system on chain, but we can never build it because everything requires collateral and there's no other way to.
00:32:33.860 - 00:32:35.710, Speaker D: There has to be a financial component to it.
00:32:35.780 - 00:32:41.946, Speaker A: Absolutely. So could this be a start to an on chain reputation system that could interact with defi?
00:32:42.138 - 00:33:36.740, Speaker D: No, I actually think that's really interesting. I think already it is kind of doing that where scammer accounts or new people that enter CT don't actually know who is good and who is bad. Why? Because follower account is such a horrible signal to if you're a good actor or a bad actor, right? Now, if you look on Frontech, though, if you look at the key prices and the type of people that are holding it, you can see the scam or non legitimate accounts that have tens of thousands or even 100,000 followers on Twitter have no traction. Right. The people know who's good to bet on and who's not. And it's actually a good signal in terms of a person's reputation and how they handled themselves in this market over the last several years. Right.
00:33:36.740 - 00:34:13.534, Speaker D: The one thing that I would be concerned about is if people in DeFi or a lot of protocols started using friendtech as a way to judge reputation. One, how could it be gamed? But also, two, how does value accrue back to frontech at all? Right. Can Frontek put in ways where there are easier plugins that they can create in order to make this more of a possibility, but also make the ux better and then also get some value back to this ecosystem? Right. I think there's a ton of things that could be built on top of Frontech, which we're very involved in right now.
00:34:13.572 - 00:34:22.742, Speaker A: Yeah. So I want to go back to the different metas, but let's go to what could be built on Frontech.
00:34:22.906 - 00:34:25.060, Speaker D: Yeah, 99.
00:34:26.310 - 00:34:32.098, Speaker A: So maybe talk about what you released recently and then talk about 99 and all the other good stuff.
00:34:32.184 - 00:35:19.780, Speaker D: Yeah. So what we released recently is sort of like a skeleton or template smart contract. So we implemented a proxy contract that allows you to essentially buy fronttech keys into a proxy contract, which then maps your holdings within it, and then it allows you to transfer free of charge the keys to anyone. It allows the receiver then to sell it directly to the frontech contract, receiving ETH, or transfer it back to another person. So like gifting works now. You can approve for transfers, which is what you do in D five when you approve a protocol to take your ERC twenty s. So you can now build protocols on top of Frontech, like lending and borrowing, for example, which is what we meant by 99.
00:35:19.780 - 00:35:59.998, Speaker D: And then there's also a presale mechanism that allows people to basically launching, I think, is one of the hardest parts of friendtech and one of the big problems, right? Because sure it gives you the dopamine hit, but then you quickly realize, wait, the guy that bought up all my keys is a bot. It's not really a person who immediately extracts all of that value away from the ecosystem and exits. Now we've been doing self sniping, but self sniping is an issue because the creator puts in eth, can't really sell the shares that they sniped. And then the snipe bots just come in right after because they know that the creator is probably not going to dump on them. And then people buy in higher now, right. And then they get dumped on by the bots. So it's still an issue.
00:35:59.998 - 00:37:03.650, Speaker D: Now, we tried some things like sell back in immediately. What we realized is there's so many bots. So even the bot that immediately had an unrealized loss in terms of PNL got saved by another bot that had limited basically to just pump it up again, right? And it's like, oh God, right. So sandwiching doesn't really work on a bonding curve mechanism because people will just buy in after. So essentially what we thought about was, how do we fix this? Let's try a presale mechanism where actually you can give users a fixed price. Creators can then distribute to the users the keys at the lowest possible price below any bot entries, right? So now bots are taking extreme risk to be coming into this trade because after 20% fees, you also need a lot of people that can't sell, right? I mean, you have a bunch of people that now can sell at the cheapest price because their entry is much lower through the presale. So you really need a lot more people to come in, and the bots are just now trading, then they're taking risk like everybody else.
00:37:03.650 - 00:37:27.994, Speaker D: Right. So, yeah, we think that's one of the most fair mechanisms to launch. We've got a lot of accounts that want to use this and try it out. We've had projects basically contact us saying they're going to build a front end for it. They're going to build a launch pad on fronttech. Now we've got two projects that said that they want to build the lend and borrow on top of it. And we can see so many possible things coming out of this.
00:37:27.994 - 00:37:28.294, Speaker D: Essentially.
00:37:28.342 - 00:37:34.478, Speaker B: Can you do peer to peer trading? So instead of buying and selling to the bonding curve, we buy and sell to each other?
00:37:34.564 - 00:38:11.994, Speaker D: Yes, you can. So if you were to buy keys into the proxy contract, then they become transferable. So you could technically swap and trade keys with no fees. But we've not mentioned that as much because then the whole value of, like, going back to the creators sort of goes away. And then I feel like the fronttech team would also not be very happy with that. I do think it's good for this ecosystem to bring value back to the creators, otherwise the cycle sort of breaks down.
00:38:12.112 - 00:38:14.774, Speaker B: Would that also support fractionalized shares?
00:38:14.822 - 00:38:15.942, Speaker D: Yeah, fractionalized shares.
00:38:16.006 - 00:38:19.702, Speaker B: So if you have all these things, you have all the ingredients for d five summer?
00:38:19.846 - 00:38:20.540, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:38:22.530 - 00:38:23.482, Speaker A: It'S not copium.
00:38:23.546 - 00:38:24.314, Speaker B: It's not copium.
00:38:24.362 - 00:38:31.770, Speaker D: We basically turned each key into its own ERC 20 token, essentially, and just built the skeleton contract interface for it, essentially.
00:38:31.850 - 00:38:32.878, Speaker B: Okay. Yeah.
00:38:33.044 - 00:38:34.240, Speaker A: Are you all in?
00:38:35.430 - 00:38:38.722, Speaker B: We still need Jerome to start to turn the printer on.
00:38:38.856 - 00:39:12.366, Speaker A: Jerome, if you're watching this, I just want to dive deeper into this because this is so interesting. So I bought Dan Robinson's key before I ended up selling it. Great Alpha, by the way, so highly recommend buying Dan Robinson's key. I'm going to buy it again soon. But a lot of people were worried about the bonding, like, well, can we change a bonding curve? He goes, no, there's only a certain amount of buys, you know, until it gets just too expensive for someone to, like, they get priced out.
00:39:12.388 - 00:39:12.574, Speaker C: Right.
00:39:12.612 - 00:39:35.330, Speaker A: Because of the bonding curve. And he said something very interesting. He said there is an element of building out read only access keys. Right. And read only access keys could be on top of the key holders. Right. And the idea here is like, someone buys this and they can just read the content, but they can't interact with the creator.
00:39:35.330 - 00:40:35.682, Speaker A: And then the person is like, well, how is that value going to accrue to keyholders? That's not fair. It's just going to create more of an imbalance in terms of where value is going to accrue. He goes, well, technically, price could be split between the keyholders and the creators. And so thinking about what Frontech would do to cannibalize some of the startups that are building on, because if you think about know, Fronttech is going to know they're going to try to take share, right? Because this is their ecosystem, similar to Uniswap, right? Uniswap built out Uniswap, the protocol, then its front end, then Uniswap X, the intent aggregator, its own wallet, and so kind of own the entire value chain. Is that how we're thinking here too, or how are we thinking about this? I know maybe I'm getting ahead of myself, but do we see a flourishing defi ecosystem or do we see some cannibalization happening? I guess the question I'm asking is what is frontech going to build natively, and what do you think is going to be left open to defi?
00:40:35.746 - 00:41:34.780, Speaker D: Yeah, the one issue with Frontech's main contract is that it's immutable. So other than I think the fee switch switching the fee rate, they can't change the bonding curve at all, which Dan's already mentioned. And basically the core mechanism can't be changed. That's why creating a separate contract that handles read only keys is kind of one option they can go with, but the core structure can't change. Now, the reason why I like lend and borrow, although there's a massive risk that comes to the ecosystem with it, is one, it's an oracle free lend and borrow protocol. Why? Because the prices are fixed on a bonding curve, so it's deterministic and you don't need to rely on any oracles. That's amazing, because liquidators can now fully atomically handle liquidations and they're very incentivized to do so easily by just giving them like a 5% cut.
00:41:34.780 - 00:42:09.074, Speaker D: And now you've got a London borrower protocol that has no oracle and basically has very low risk of bad debt, right? Aka this London borrower protocol, becomes as safe as almost ave, for example. So how does value accrue back to Frontech in this case? I thought about it, it's like the liquidations themselves. In order to liquidate, you go from the proxy contract, call sell shares in order to sell the collateral, the sell shares function, then calls the main frontech contract, which then pays 10% back to the creator and friendtech.
00:42:09.122 - 00:42:09.670, Speaker A: Right.
00:42:09.820 - 00:42:37.674, Speaker D: So London borrow protocol, I think there will be some value accrual back to Frontech, because all of the liquidations basically means you're trading the keys through the bonding curve, which has the liquidity, and therefore you're going to end up basically getting something back to Frontek. Now, OTC swaps, it's a bit different. Right. If someone builds an OTC market on top of the proxy contract, essentially you're taking away a lot of the value that would go back to the creators.
00:42:37.722 - 00:42:40.160, Speaker A: In front tech, and I'm sure they're thinking about this.
00:42:40.850 - 00:43:49.078, Speaker C: Yeah, I do think about, these are more potential kind of use cases and things that we can do with keys if we were to kind of turn them effectively into ERC twenty s. But at the same time, at what point does that kind of break the social dynamics on which friend tech is built? Right. If people are just going to be able to kind of PvP trade keys with one another, does that kind of lessen the value and lessen the type of initial commitment that I feel into buying a key? Right. Because if I just buy a racer key, maybe I can just swap it for a couple of other keys of someone else later on or something like that, versus me saying, all right, if I'm buying this racer key, I'm going to hold this because it's a large financial commitment. But I can also kind of see other functionalities, such as borrow lending, kind of even intensifying some of those social obligations that we're kind of forming in Frontech. Right? Like, let's say if someone buys a ton of my keys and they collateralize it to take out, like a huge loan, I'm going to start feeling the pressure, like, oh, man, I need to make sure that I keep bringing value, because if people dump someone out there is going to get liquidated because of me. Right?
00:43:49.244 - 00:44:24.094, Speaker B: So the immutability of the contract, how big of a problem is it, really? In other words, specifically the bonding curve. So there's a lot of talks on Twitter about why the bonding curve is not ideal. For example, it goes up exponentially. It scales exponentially as n goes up, which means probably the number of people per group is going to be limited because people can pay for that much money to join the group. So there's limitations to the bonding curve like that. And the fact that this bonding curve is immutable, how big of a problem it is.
00:44:24.212 - 00:44:56.774, Speaker D: So security wise, it's amazing. If it were to be able to be modified, would be really concerned about the security of fronttech, especially on the smart contract side. So that's good. Now, is it a solvable problem? It is solvable by building in new features that allows more people to access but gates them on specific features. For example, actually talking and interacting in these groups with read only access. Right. I do think that the concerns are a bit like overheated on the bonding curve.
00:44:56.774 - 00:45:54.540, Speaker D: I think it's because there's a lot of people that get priced out of these keys and then they're voicing their opinions and it's a bit of like groupthink happening. But really, don't you want exclusivity into your rooms? Right. As a creator, you don't want 1000 plus people in your room chatting to you because at one point it becomes way too much and the utility actually goes away because it's like I can never get their attention because there's too many people in this room. Right? So actually I think it's very good for it to become virtually impossible to enter a room after a certain number of people unless you're really paying because you're buying in because of the utility, no longer for the financial sort of aspect of the key price going up, just because you want to talk to them. And that actually maintains the utility because there's value in that and there's exclusivity, basically.
00:45:54.910 - 00:46:49.920, Speaker C: That's kind of why I mentioned that fronttech is very much like a template for potential other apps in the future, right? Thinking about the addressable market of something like Frontech, it seems like it's still very much limited to perhaps people with a lot of capital or just people within CT or people within the crypto space that can be djens. Right. And to Jay's point, it seems like itself, like this model, perhaps with its current bonding curve, would be a good supplement as kind of like an exclusivity platform on top of someone else's more traditional social media following. Right? Like, if you like my Twitter content, that's great. If you want to see more exclusive content, then purchase my keys and then we can talk on there. Right. But I do think it's kind of interesting to think about how the social dynamics that the template of friendtech creates can be used for other use cases in the future.
00:46:49.920 - 00:47:23.482, Speaker C: We've talked a lot about proof of identity and scoring people based upon their defections or just their on chain activity, right. This is something that crypto has been trying to solve for a long time in terms of financialization of the world's unbanked. Right. I'm not saying that people in emerging markets and all over the world are going to start purchasing keys, but it's an interesting way to kind of think about is this like a potential way for people to start building some kind of on chain identity that could lead to some kind of financialization in the future?
00:47:23.616 - 00:47:28.010, Speaker A: So question for you, how do you see this against Worldcoin?
00:47:28.830 - 00:47:46.690, Speaker C: Right? Yes, we mentioned a little bit yesterday too. I feel like tech was kind of able to kind of bootstrap and kind of proof of humanity kind of a lot faster than worldcoin, right. And I don't have to scan my eyes or my cornea in order to start having some kind of on chain identity. Right. That's actually tied to me.
00:47:46.760 - 00:47:51.730, Speaker B: Is it actually faster than worldcoin in terms of number of people who scan their eyeballs?
00:47:52.230 - 00:48:00.054, Speaker C: I'm not too sure about the actual figures, but it just does seem a lot more convenient versus just scanning my eyeballs and having to line up.
00:48:00.092 - 00:48:00.294, Speaker A: Right.
00:48:00.332 - 00:48:06.134, Speaker C: I'm hearing wordcoin has a lot of operational logistical issues right now and kind of onboarding a lot of users for.
00:48:06.172 - 00:48:22.170, Speaker B: The non crypto natives. I feel like Frentech onboarding is a very painful process, but it's a solvable problem. It's a solvable problem. I'm just saying that the status quo, I think for non crypto natives work, one is easier to onboard for crypto natives like us.
00:48:22.240 - 00:48:34.990, Speaker D: The thing is that one is very easily solvable. It's not an immutable contract type of thing. It's literally three lines of code in their front end and they could actually fix it pretty quickly where you just give access to the app without having to deposit or buy your first share.
00:48:35.060 - 00:48:35.438, Speaker A: Right.
00:48:35.524 - 00:48:44.260, Speaker D: Let people look at what's going on, see how the app works before they have to commit eth, figure out how to get it there and buy their first share.
00:48:45.190 - 00:49:39.314, Speaker A: Before this, we were talking a bit about the metas. I don't know if this is the end of the meta, but aggregators, right? There's aggregators that are acting as if an index where they'll buy a bunch of keys and then they'll share the alpha. There was something called Friendbook, I think, that got shut down recently from salience, was it? And there's a couple other aggregators, levy and mean, I feel like they don't have a moat, right. And eventually they'll be cut off access if they continue to do this. But how do you see these products are being built around these, around the front tech ecosystem, like aggregators as an example. What other things are you seeing? I also saw something called friend games and stumble upon you or something. And these are games that are being built on top of the front tech ecosystem where use your identity as a way to authenticate.
00:49:39.314 - 00:50:01.786, Speaker A: And then you could see your avatar and you could see your username in these games. So it's kind of crazy. So I just want to kind of touch on things that could be built using your identity. And similar to Google Oauth, right, you oauth into new accounts that you create, I guess. Do you see this going that way as well or how do you see.
00:50:01.808 - 00:50:06.734, Speaker D: That so stumble upon that game? Actually we helped launch friend tech. Yeah.
00:50:06.772 - 00:50:06.974, Speaker A: Okay.
00:50:07.012 - 00:50:13.742, Speaker D: I didn't know that. I actually didn't realize that they were doing that much with Friendtech. I just thought it was.
00:50:13.876 - 00:50:19.778, Speaker A: No, I think friend games was and then stumble upon is using their keys as a way to do something. I forgot what it was.
00:50:19.864 - 00:50:47.034, Speaker D: Yeah. But yeah, we did help them. It's really good to see things like that being built and new utilities being found versus there's already like 50 competitors on aggregators. It's crazy pooling analytics, which is great. It's bullish that so many developers are for free or just because they're incentivized to get their key price up, which doesn't actually mean that they make that much money. Right. It's just reputation almost.
00:50:47.034 - 00:51:45.006, Speaker D: They're spending that much time to release these types of products. Right now there's a ton of these analytics tools and whatnot. But what we're more interested in are these new utilities that people are going to try to find, or real projects like full projects that are getting built on top of it. But it's kind of similar to early days of Defi, right? We had like Defi Pulse and then Coingecko trying to integrate some of the liquidity depth into their pages. And then you had Defi llama. And then with these analytics tools though at the end of the day maybe one survives and becomes like the fully featured one that everyone uses, which Defi llama is now. But with like it'll be interesting to see who actually wins out of that massive red ocean of analytics tooling competition versus there's going to be a couple of projects that come on, I think, that become very big and sort of the major friend tech plays that are built on top of it.
00:51:45.188 - 00:52:05.806, Speaker B: So you said the onboarding was fairly easy. Fix a few lines of code. Let's talk about downboarding because when I first got onboarded, it was really painful. You have to sign in with your apple or Google. You have to sign in with Twitter. You have to bridge some money, deposit some money, then you can get started. It's at least three steps.
00:52:05.806 - 00:52:17.030, Speaker B: Oh, and also you have to enter the invite code four steps. Really painful. Has that changed, and how do you think we can improve the onboarding even further?
00:52:17.370 - 00:53:01.958, Speaker D: So it hasn't really changed. The main thing that friendtech changed was basically allowing users, instead of having to bridge to base themselves, wait until that bridge is done to deposit into the wallet. Now they give you a link to go to, and then from there, you can just deposit to a wallet address on main net, where most people hold their Eth. And so that did make it slightly easier. But the initial web, two login auth, and then linking the Twitter, the invite code stuff hasn't changed. Now, for very large accounts, there's actually a lot of non crypto native artists that I know who actually have tens of thousands of followers or even more on Twitter. And what happened with them.
00:53:01.958 - 00:53:49.400, Speaker D: And even with Yatsu, the CEO of Animoka, who we were onboarding, he goes, wait, there's no step to deposit ETH into an address? And I was like, what do you mean? Yeah, there is. And he's like, no, it just skipped that step. And I'm like, friendtech changed the onboarding mechanism. And then it clicked to me. The sniper bots who don't want to spam for hours waiting for the guy to fund the wallet, they actually send dust to the ETH wallet on base that's connected to their frontech account because they can query the API so they can pull it and make sure, oh, this Twitter account owns this wallet. They throw in dust so that it skips that deposit step, and then, boom, they're getting baited to buy the first key so that they can immediately snipe it. Oh, my God.
00:53:50.330 - 00:53:54.434, Speaker A: The level of sophistication, it's mind boggling.
00:53:54.482 - 00:54:02.250, Speaker D: I mean, it's so beautiful psychology, right? Markets are beautifully efficient, quite efficient. It's hard to find inefficiencies.
00:54:02.990 - 00:54:03.306, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:54:03.328 - 00:54:16.746, Speaker B: I mean, speaking of that, the first two weeks was very easy for us to buy good people at cheap prices. But week three, the moment you see them, they're priced at one e. It's crazy. The market is so efficient.
00:54:16.778 - 00:54:28.622, Speaker A: Now, speaking of onboarding, also, I'm curious. We're hovering around 30 to 35 million tvl, and I think we'll slowly grow, but we won't grow exponentially.
00:54:28.766 - 00:54:30.260, Speaker B: I love how you say we?
00:54:31.510 - 00:55:04.410, Speaker A: It is a part of my platform. We own this token. There's a lot of concerns about security. I feel like we're hovering around 30, 35 million tbl, and I don't think we're going to grow as fast as DFI summer unless we solve security. And privy is like, one element. And then there's also frontech. And the question any legal compliance team will ask is, like, what's the security framework in place? Is it trustworthy? Are there, like, attack vectors?
00:55:04.570 - 00:55:06.510, Speaker B: Is it a cool storage? Which is not.
00:55:06.580 - 00:55:11.358, Speaker A: Yeah, because everyone uses ledger, or they use fireblocks and others.
00:55:11.444 - 00:55:40.422, Speaker B: All the funds, by the way, one of the key alphas in crypto since the beginning of bitcoin is operational risks and custody risks. The reason why the retail front ran all the institutions was precisely because that. And we're seeing the same thing with frantic. All the individuals, all the retail are front running the vcs because of security and custody. So how do you feel about custody?
00:55:40.566 - 00:55:49.274, Speaker D: Yeah, so embedded wallets, right? That's what privy provides. I mean, they provide the whole sign up onboarding flow as well. But it is definitely.
00:55:49.392 - 00:55:54.390, Speaker B: By embedded wallet, you mean not having to sign transactions with, like, a metamask?
00:55:54.550 - 00:55:57.902, Speaker D: That, plus you don't have to create your own wallet. They create it for you.
00:55:58.036 - 00:56:00.382, Speaker A: Talk a bit about what that is. Wallet as a service. Yeah.
00:56:00.436 - 00:56:25.042, Speaker D: So embedded wallets, basically, when you create an account on Frontech or any consumer app that's using privy on the back end, for example, Blackbird. Yeah, or Xeroxpass. So the app info layer, essentially what happens is on a normal account creation, you could use Google Auth even to create an account on the back end. A wallet address is generated for you along with its private mnemonic.
00:56:25.106 - 00:56:25.622, Speaker A: Right?
00:56:25.756 - 00:57:08.662, Speaker D: Now, that secret key, the private key is split into three shares. One goes into the user's local storage device, which neither the app nor privy can see. The other one goes into a database where the user can use an API call with their API key in order to get it. And then the last one is a recovery share that gets encrypted by the user using a password. Now, Frontech didn't actually enable that option to encrypt that third key, so the recovery key is actually unencrypted. So there's three shares. You need two of those three in order to get the private key.
00:57:08.662 - 00:57:22.854, Speaker D: And so when you click export wallet, what happens is it actually combines two of the three shares, one from your local, and then one API request to get the second share. And then, boom, it generates your private key so that you can export the wallet.
00:57:22.902 - 00:57:23.210, Speaker A: Right.
00:57:23.280 - 00:57:48.610, Speaker D: So that's how privy works at the moment. Friendtech unfortunately did not add the password encryption in order to get rid of one extra step on the onboarding. So your keys are actually technically, if know changed a couple lines of their code, they would be able to snoop their users on onboarding and be able to actually reconstruct your private key without your consent. Technically.
00:57:49.990 - 00:57:55.250, Speaker B: But the user needs to update the app. Right, in order for franchise to.
00:57:55.400 - 00:58:00.102, Speaker D: No, users don't need to update the app because it's a browser home screen app.
00:58:00.156 - 00:58:01.014, Speaker B: Oh, that's right.
00:58:01.132 - 00:58:01.800, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:58:03.930 - 00:58:05.014, Speaker B: Pwa, that's right.
00:58:05.052 - 00:58:05.958, Speaker A: We should talk about P. Yeah, we.
00:58:05.964 - 00:58:07.094, Speaker B: Should tell them about that.
00:58:07.292 - 00:58:40.766, Speaker D: So it is concerning, like you're putting a lot of trust. So there's already almost 40 million TVL. Technically, front tech could, if they were to turn into a malicious actor, you're putting a lot of trust in them. Now if the user encryption. So the password encryption were there. And also privy itself is adding two fa on top to add more security to the whole embedded wallet design. It's actually quite secure and apps have the option to enable it, but Fronttech didn't.
00:58:40.766 - 00:58:45.314, Speaker D: But privy will be recommending apps basically to make sure that they do that.
00:58:45.432 - 00:59:03.018, Speaker B: Essentially, if you lose your phone and you want to access your account again, you would sign in with the same Google or Apple ID that you sign up first, and then privy will generate the other shard. So then you have the two of the two to access your account.
00:59:03.104 - 00:59:49.350, Speaker D: Yeah, correct. Now, I think one other thing that I forgot to mention is when you're actually logging into frontech or signing up, it's much safer to use Google or Apple because with your phone number, the whole sim swapping thing, because there's no two FA with fronttech, specifically, when you're logging in, you could be giving someone all access to your keys and your shares and the eth on your wallet within fronttech, if you get Sim swapped. Right, which is not impossible to do, or it's quite easy to do now. So I would say given that fronttech hasn't enabled two FA, new people signing on should definitely use Google or Apple.
00:59:49.510 - 00:59:51.850, Speaker A: When will they enable two fa?
00:59:52.590 - 01:00:21.006, Speaker D: So the issue is that they can't enable friendtech, can't retroactively enable two FA for the users because the two FA is part of the encryption of the recovery key, potentially is what privy is trying to do. But new wallets, they could basically enforce it. And even now they could enforce the user generated password to additionally, encrypt the recovery share so that they can never have control of the user private keys.
01:00:21.038 - 01:00:23.198, Speaker A: So they can enable user generated password.
01:00:23.294 - 01:00:26.546, Speaker D: Today, but for future users only.
01:00:26.648 - 01:00:30.806, Speaker A: Oh, so what do retro users do? Do they have to shut their account down and restart? No.
01:00:30.828 - 01:00:40.600, Speaker D: So retro users would have to authenticate it. Like, each and every one of them would have to authenticate this change, and they would have to migrate their wallet, basically.
01:00:41.070 - 01:00:42.586, Speaker A: Oh, what a painful process.
01:00:42.688 - 01:00:42.954, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:00:42.992 - 01:00:46.854, Speaker A: So they would have to sell all the keys and transfer, or can they reassign the keys?
01:00:46.902 - 01:00:56.160, Speaker D: Yeah, that's why it's probably based on my technical knowledge of how the encryption and decryption works, that's probably what's going to have to happen.
01:00:56.690 - 01:00:57.290, Speaker A: Rip.
01:00:57.370 - 01:01:21.826, Speaker D: Yeah. Or they could basically get the user's private key during the wallet phase and then automatically just re encrypt and then erase the existing shares that are on the local storage and the database and the recovery share, and then regenerate those shares with the new encryption mechanism, essentially. So might not have to actually migrate all the shares.
01:01:21.938 - 01:01:22.600, Speaker A: Okay.
01:01:23.290 - 01:01:34.426, Speaker B: What does it take for funds that have lps money, not prop money, to get onboarded? What kind of security model is required of them?
01:01:34.528 - 01:02:03.426, Speaker C: That's definitely a tough one. Right. With all the security kind of vulnerabilities that Jay just mentioned does kind of put a lot of issues into funds feeling safe enough to custody LP capital into tech. Right. The only reason that manifold is able to do it is because we manage proprietary capital. But for funds, in order to actually manage, put external LP capital onto the platform, that's going to be a much larger hurdle. Right.
01:02:03.426 - 01:02:31.626, Speaker C: There's the security vulnerabilities, but at the same time, Frentech itself would have to be either using a qualified custodian in the back end for some kind of institutional version, or they themselves would have to have qualified custodian licensure. Right. And as we kind of see with regulators right now, even holding assets on an exchange could potentially be some kind of violation of custody fiduciary duty that a fund would have to for its investors.
01:02:31.738 - 01:02:35.358, Speaker D: I mean, most institutions can't even touch defi yet. Right?
01:02:35.524 - 01:02:36.800, Speaker A: We're so early.
01:02:37.170 - 01:02:38.400, Speaker D: We're so early.
01:02:38.930 - 01:02:47.122, Speaker B: Even crypto vcs, crypto natives, could frontec build a desktop app?
01:02:47.176 - 01:02:50.898, Speaker A: They did. I think they did, yeah. It was just announced a day ago.
01:02:50.984 - 01:02:58.082, Speaker D: Yeah. Spamming racers, chat. Can you just support desktop, desktop plus hardware wallet?
01:02:58.146 - 01:03:00.242, Speaker B: Would that be enough for vcs?
01:03:00.386 - 01:03:17.158, Speaker D: Hardware wallets would definitely help a lot of things, but it's just like the UX versus security right. Are you going to give up the UX of better onboarding through privy to now cater towards institutions?
01:03:17.254 - 01:03:29.374, Speaker C: Yeah, I think the risk return profile is still misaligned right now for true onslaught of funds to come in and start actually risking external LP capital on the platform.
01:03:29.492 - 01:03:31.470, Speaker B: I'm just thinking about the top signal.
01:03:32.130 - 01:03:33.166, Speaker A: We're so early.
01:03:33.268 - 01:03:34.080, Speaker D: I know.
01:03:35.350 - 01:03:37.694, Speaker A: Let's wait for the VC thesis articles.
01:03:37.742 - 01:03:40.466, Speaker B: That's exactly what I'm looking for when.
01:03:40.488 - 01:03:42.338, Speaker D: They'Re releasing a thesis soon.
01:03:42.424 - 01:03:44.100, Speaker B: All right, but you guys are not.
01:03:45.210 - 01:03:45.906, Speaker C: Top signal.
01:03:45.938 - 01:03:46.760, Speaker D: Right here.
01:03:50.010 - 01:04:15.280, Speaker A: There'S a xerox. Ngmi, who's the founder of Defi Lama, recently tweeted that there's also another attack vector by attacking the front end of the iframe. Yeah, correct. Can you talk a little bit more about that? Because that's also worried because the technical arguments make sense. And the thing that scares me the most is that all I have to do is open the app and that's it, it's over.
01:04:15.650 - 01:04:54.810, Speaker D: So it's classic attack vectors, right? On the user side, it's like trying to avoid phishing scams. But on the app side, there's a lot of things you can do to prevent a lot of those simple attack vectors. Hopefully, Friendtech is doing a lot of those best practices and also trying to defend against it. Privy. According to Henry, the CEO works with the apps themselves on the front end to make sure they are implementing a lot of those things that prevent those attack vectors from actually occurring. So I think that's less of a concern. It's pretty easily.
01:04:56.830 - 01:04:57.098, Speaker A: Mean.
01:04:57.104 - 01:04:57.226, Speaker C: I.
01:04:57.248 - 01:05:08.350, Speaker A: When I saw that, my heart sunk. Right. But then it also reminded me of early defi summer, like yam and others. And we got rugged with pickle a few times, if you remember that.
01:05:08.420 - 01:05:10.650, Speaker B: But those were not like, they weren't custody.
01:05:10.730 - 01:05:17.262, Speaker A: Yeah, but they were just like different attack vectors. Right. I had PTSD from DFI.
01:05:17.326 - 01:05:17.650, Speaker B: Exactly.
01:05:17.720 - 01:05:24.946, Speaker D: The cool thing about friendtech is the smart contract risk is actually very low. Okay. It's mutable, 50 lines of code and immutable. Right.
01:05:25.048 - 01:05:29.366, Speaker A: But the base stuff, like building on your proxy contract is an example. There's still risk involved with.
01:05:29.468 - 01:05:36.886, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah. So actually, compared to DeFi, smart contract risk is low. Bridge risk is not very bad with base.
01:05:36.988 - 01:05:37.506, Speaker A: Right.
01:05:37.628 - 01:05:49.274, Speaker D: I think the actual bigger security risk is on the SEC security. Well, that plus just the whole. I mean, that's going to take a while to play out.
01:05:49.312 - 01:05:49.994, Speaker A: Right.
01:05:50.192 - 01:06:03.686, Speaker D: But I think the bigger security issue is what you're talking about with the app side. How are they managing everything? Because we're all okay with the compromise for Better ux, but at the same time, the risk definitely increases the more centralized it becomes.
01:06:03.738 - 01:06:04.146, Speaker A: Right.
01:06:04.248 - 01:06:07.858, Speaker B: They could get compromised internally even if the founders didn't want to.
01:06:07.944 - 01:06:16.610, Speaker D: Correct. So one developer at Friendtech who knows their shit could technically rogue. I mean, that's the same thing with metamask, though.
01:06:16.760 - 01:06:17.170, Speaker B: Yes.
01:06:17.240 - 01:06:20.358, Speaker D: Yeah. And we could all get very fucked. Yeah.
01:06:20.524 - 01:06:24.354, Speaker B: I mean, that reminds me of the axe hack, the rolling bridge hack.
01:06:24.402 - 01:06:24.614, Speaker A: Yes.
01:06:24.652 - 01:06:26.230, Speaker B: It was an internal compromise.
01:06:27.130 - 01:06:54.274, Speaker A: That was scary, too. Today's points day. Oh, yeah. So I'm going to hit refresh every few minutes after probably another 30 minutes. I'm assuming everyone else does that. It's great because all the chats start to liven up and they're like, did you get your points yet? Points? Send me a screenshot. And I guess this from a meta perspective, do you think this is just.
01:06:54.274 - 01:07:24.682, Speaker A: I mean, obviously it's speculative driven, right? You know, people are farming the points. You know, I've seen some crazy numbers out there from point 50 or cl said like $100. I don't know. But do you think this is primarily speculative driven? And would this turn into a habit? Is this like habit forming? Is there a reason why they did six months? Right. Is it to form this habit so that people become stickier? How are you guys assessing this?
01:07:24.816 - 01:07:30.234, Speaker D: First of all, self buying will not really be a thing anymore if there's no points associated to it. Right.
01:07:30.272 - 01:07:31.420, Speaker A: They got to nerf that.
01:07:31.790 - 01:07:56.334, Speaker D: You won't have guys like bombatis. There's no point. Right? He's just doing a trade, right. His trade is the fees I'm paying is going to be lower than the airdrop I'm getting. Obviously it's going to be more than like 10% returns on the airdrop. Because if you're self buying and self selling, your round trip is 10%. The trade is a no brainer, right? Yeah, things like that is pretty interesting.
01:07:56.334 - 01:08:00.054, Speaker D: That's going to go away as soon as the airdrop happens. Boom, he's out.
01:08:00.092 - 01:08:00.680, Speaker A: Right.
01:08:01.850 - 01:08:17.510, Speaker D: What other things? Habit building is the same thing, I think, as PMF. It's like what features and what actual use cases does Frontech bring that has PMF Versus what's activity just purely to farm the airdrop?
01:08:17.670 - 01:09:03.000, Speaker C: Yeah, that's what I feel like is the true deciding factor for both Frontech and also other kind of blockchain enabled consumer applications going forward. It's just how do you shift the value of your platform from solely being speculative to actually having some kind of true utility? And that's kind of hard to really imagine concretely for these dapps and for stuff like front tech. Right. I think, as we've mentioned, a lot of people are trying to. There's people that are actually interacting with the application and trying to earn points organically, actually participating. There's people who are looking at it as a trade or people who are just gaming in the process, going through hundreds of chats and just saying GM every day just to try to rack up those points. Right, exactly.
01:09:03.000 - 01:09:41.810, Speaker C: That's gaming the system. But I also think that some of that is still effective in terms of getting over that cold start problem for applications. Right. There's a healthy amount of gaming just so people can just interact with the application as well. Right. But I feel like blockchain is always really good at getting over the cold start problem. But the actual sustenance of value over time is what we have an issue with in this space, which is why I keep going back to the point where I think applications like this as an end all be all might not be very effective in the long term.
01:09:41.810 - 01:09:46.230, Speaker C: But it's very great for initially bootstrapping that crowd base.
01:09:46.300 - 01:09:46.870, Speaker A: Right.
01:09:47.020 - 01:09:54.710, Speaker C: Bootstrapping your fans and having that supplement like a much more sustainable platform underneath.
01:09:54.790 - 01:10:13.146, Speaker B: Come to think of it, six months is a really good number. It hits the great number because if it's too long, people will be like, this is going to last too long. I'm not going to play this game. But if it's just one month. Okay, so one month might be enough to form the habit of because you got hooked.
01:10:13.178 - 01:10:13.562, Speaker A: Hooked.
01:10:13.626 - 01:10:16.434, Speaker B: I got hooked the first day. One day. One day was enough for you.
01:10:16.472 - 01:10:17.060, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:10:17.670 - 01:10:30.054, Speaker B: But one month is not enough for people to build all these games. And the proxy contract, that stuff will take around a few months. That's why the six months. Such a.
01:10:30.092 - 01:10:30.982, Speaker A: It's a genius idea.
01:10:31.036 - 01:10:31.960, Speaker B: Such a beautiful.
01:10:32.490 - 01:10:42.774, Speaker D: You can actually build an ecosystem in that time. Yeah. A tangent that I wanted to talk about, actually is just incentives won't go away completely, even after the airdrop.
01:10:42.822 - 01:10:43.130, Speaker A: Right.
01:10:43.200 - 01:11:04.042, Speaker D: They'll still incentivize, but there's a market value to the incentivization. So it'll clearly be lower in our heads, in our imagination. The thing is, there are a lot of sustainable ecosystems out there where incentives are so low, but people still play the game. And an example is gaming.
01:11:04.106 - 01:11:04.622, Speaker A: Right.
01:11:04.756 - 01:11:13.314, Speaker D: Crypto likes to think that they invented play to earn, but there were play to earn games way before crypto even existed. Right. Maple story is like a big one.
01:11:13.352 - 01:11:13.506, Speaker A: Right.
01:11:13.528 - 01:11:20.774, Speaker D: I grew up with Maple story there are adults that play. Yeah, there are adults that play this game. What, like you don't know what it is?
01:11:20.812 - 01:11:21.330, Speaker A: I don't.
01:11:21.410 - 01:11:22.040, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:11:22.490 - 01:11:26.674, Speaker A: I'm laughing awkwardly. Wait, what's Maple sync?
01:11:26.722 - 01:11:34.858, Speaker D: Yeah, so maple story is a game where you have a character, you buy equipment, weapons, and whatnot, and you kill monsters, do quests, and you get rewarded for it, right?
01:11:34.944 - 01:11:35.980, Speaker A: In what, though?
01:11:36.510 - 01:11:42.954, Speaker D: So there's an in game currency called meso, and then there's also these items, right, with different stats.
01:11:43.082 - 01:11:44.510, Speaker A: But other games have this too, though.
01:11:44.580 - 01:12:17.682, Speaker D: Right? But the thing is, it's actually a really interesting economy because these monsters spawn. So there's an inflation rate, too, because when the monsters get killed, you get gold. Or like mesa. Right? So there's an inflation rate because there's constant supply of this dropping new items and new currency. But at the same time, people keep trading with each other to get the best stats. And you have this economy. But real full grown adults play this game like 14, 16 hours a day sometimes to just farm, hunt and earn this currency.
01:12:17.682 - 01:12:34.766, Speaker D: And they can cash it out. They can cash out the items, they can cash out the ingame currency, but for like $10, $20 a day. Right. With all those hours blood, sweat and tears put into it, and they're like, wow, I made real money. And they're happy, and they're incentivized to keep playing. Right.
01:12:34.788 - 01:12:36.158, Speaker A: Wait, how does it turn into real money?
01:12:36.244 - 01:12:37.534, Speaker D: There's a market for it.
01:12:37.652 - 01:12:51.438, Speaker A: Oh, not crypto. So this is where it's fundamental, because there's other games that offer this type of in game currency. But the difference here is that, okay, that's cool. Roblox do that with skins?
01:12:51.534 - 01:12:55.726, Speaker D: Yeah, this has existed for a long time. This is true play to earn.
01:12:55.758 - 01:12:55.954, Speaker A: Right?
01:12:55.992 - 01:13:22.800, Speaker D: And even without crazy incentives, people keep playing it and coming back. And that really shows real PMF and real human demand to keep playing this thing. And I think apps, in crypto, consumer apps, and front tech as well, need to find something like that where even when the incentives are tiny, where your trading fees are generating you close to nothing, you'll still want to keep building relationships, doing stuff, because you're just happy to be there.
01:13:23.730 - 01:13:29.520, Speaker A: How do you view shares in the long run? Or keys? Sorry?
01:13:29.890 - 01:13:31.486, Speaker B: How do you view it, Gary. Let me try.
01:13:31.508 - 01:13:32.138, Speaker C: Gary gas.
01:13:32.234 - 01:13:33.710, Speaker B: How do you view Gary gas?
01:13:34.550 - 01:13:57.238, Speaker A: No, specifically around keys. Yes, it's a fixed supply. You get 100 keys or whatever. Right? Whatever the binding curve allows one user to do. But what's the evolution behind this? What does it become? I mean, I'll tell you my edge case. My edge case is that this is like equity, right? You're buying into a user. Right.
01:13:57.324 - 01:13:58.890, Speaker B: You're doing this on purpose.
01:14:03.470 - 01:14:27.234, Speaker A: Well, I want to play the dynamics here, right. And you have access to this person. Right. And this person is going to give you content and whatever, alpha or whatever. And eventually others want access to this individual. And you see these other products that are being built and the creator has to monetize other ways. Right.
01:14:27.234 - 01:15:04.094, Speaker A: And so I feel like holding keys could become a yield bearing asset in the long run. Is that true or false? Where do you see this going? I guess where I'm trying to get at is like, where is front tech going next? And do you see the vision that I see? Because there's no way you can scale this to 10,000 people because the rooms have to stay small. Right. And so there has to be a level of exclusivity. But if we're talking scale, you can see the products that are being built on top and all the fees they have to go to keyholders. It's not fair. Is that the edge case? What do you mean?
01:15:04.132 - 01:15:20.034, Speaker D: I don't think friendtech themselves will be able to fee switch in order to give a cut to the key holders. One, regulatory, but two, that would require edits to the smart contract. So with existing keys, I don't think they can do that.
01:15:20.072 - 01:15:20.660, Speaker A: Okay.
01:15:21.750 - 01:15:53.862, Speaker D: I do think what direction do keys go and what additional utilities can they have is actually something that we can decide as a community and developers. Keys becoming a yield bearing asset, what can we do to make that happen? Right. It's actually not that hard. You create a staking contract, right? Using the proxy contract that we built and let the account creator, the room owner, to basically put rewards directly into that staking contract so that people earn rewards for staking into this contract.
01:15:53.926 - 01:15:54.166, Speaker A: Right.
01:15:54.208 - 01:16:06.420, Speaker D: So there are a lot of things you can do to build on top of this ecosystem. And I do feel like there will be a lot more projects being built and developers continuing to iterate with stuff over the next couple of months.
01:16:07.590 - 01:16:29.286, Speaker C: Yeah, cool. Definitely a lot of interesting use cases, right? This is not even considering just the off chain actions that one can do just based off of looking at all their top key holders, right. Or whoever buys as many keys or who defects the least will get some kind of exclusive access or surprise or some alpha that I can share or come to a meetup. And these are all just off chain actions.
01:16:29.318 - 01:16:29.514, Speaker A: Right.
01:16:29.552 - 01:16:33.020, Speaker C: So really the possibilities are really endless in terms of that type of.
01:16:34.910 - 01:17:04.980, Speaker A: Professional or this pro NFT collector. Dingaling. He gives out an NFT every day and we're talking like legitimate NFTs, like azukis and mutants and et cetera. So it's interesting to see how they're creating that engagement every single day to make sure that the keys stay up or above the price. But that's another value prop for holding a key. Cool. Any final questions?
01:17:05.610 - 01:17:14.962, Speaker B: I mean, let's talk about Kerry Gensler. Legal and the securities risk are frantic keys.
01:17:15.106 - 01:17:19.622, Speaker C: Securities, that's hard to say for sure, right.
01:17:19.756 - 01:17:21.050, Speaker A: Not to put the pressure on you.
01:17:21.120 - 01:18:15.002, Speaker C: Yeah, I think I can see arguments made in both ways. Right? Like the very hawkish view is like Howie tests, right? I'm buying keys of someone else, and then that person is also holding their own keys. And then the work that that person is putting into engaging in their chat or sharing good alpha and value leads to the speculation of others to kind of buy keys, which in turn is supposed to kind of lead to the financial appreciation of that key. That is like a very hawkish view, right? I think perhaps like a more pragmatic view is just saying this is not very different from a lot of the monetized platforms that we see in web two, like Patreon or only fans or something like that. You're just purchasing access to view some kind of content. Right. That's what I'm personally kind of hoping is the direction that we're going towards.
01:18:15.002 - 01:19:20.720, Speaker C: Although it does get a little murky, too, when individual creators start saying certain promises or guarantees based upon the purchase of their keys, right? Like, hey, purchase my keys and I'll share the trading fees that I generated or the alpha or the prop that I'm taking with the top five holders. Right. That's kind of pretty clearly a sense of market manipulation of some kind or some kind of securities violation. Right? So it just depends on a case by case basis as to what these creators, how they're actually gamifying this platform, and then as to how the SEC actually will go about with enforcement if they do choose. Gets a little complicated, too, right? Are they going to start looking at every single creator and are they going to go after those that made certain promises on Twitter or made certain promises in chats, or are they just going to go tell frontech to just take the whole platform down? These are all types of regulatory risks that we just don't really know how to fully navigate at this moment.
01:19:21.170 - 01:19:28.690, Speaker A: Yeah, the public chats are kind of scary, right? Anyone can just buy a key and just read your chat log, right?
01:19:28.760 - 01:19:29.538, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly.
01:19:29.624 - 01:19:30.418, Speaker B: So you got to be a little.
01:19:30.424 - 01:19:32.734, Speaker A: Bit careful on what you say in the chats.
01:19:32.862 - 01:20:02.330, Speaker D: Yeah. Another issue is that if fronttech gets shut down, unlike defi protocols, where even if one front end gets shut down, someone else can just spin up a separate front end as an anonymous person. With Fronttech, that's not as possible because you've got the whole centralized layer of not only the key management, but also the API holding the Twitter link to the address. All these things are not recreatable because everything is very off chain.
01:20:02.670 - 01:20:09.994, Speaker B: I remember big cloud actually went through several legal actions.
01:20:10.122 - 01:20:13.614, Speaker A: Did they? Do you remember I completely erased bitcloud.
01:20:13.662 - 01:20:15.758, Speaker B: After the first month after the PTSD?
01:20:15.854 - 01:20:19.746, Speaker A: Yeah. I have no recollection of what happened.
01:20:19.848 - 01:20:28.062, Speaker B: I'm trying to remember what happened, but there was something. So one was big cloud hit with season desist?
01:20:28.206 - 01:20:30.082, Speaker A: By who? By individual folks.
01:20:30.146 - 01:20:30.946, Speaker B: By individual folks.
01:20:30.978 - 01:20:32.646, Speaker A: But that's on them, though.
01:20:32.828 - 01:20:41.580, Speaker B: That's on them. But there was something else. I can't remember. Anyway, I don't know if there's any lesson we can learn for Frantak, but.
01:20:42.350 - 01:21:07.362, Speaker A: The last topic is forks. We're seeing a ton of forks. Most of them. I think they all rugged. I think the most recent one that I got like 100 messages to use post tech or whatever, but we've been in the game long enough with the forks. And outside of sushi, stop being actually a viable competitor at one point. I haven't seen any other forks ever do well.
01:21:07.362 - 01:21:24.274, Speaker A: And now it seems like there's a bunch of forks that are coming after Frontech. Bullish. Bearish. Thoughts. Like, post tech was interesting just because they copied the entire Twitter UI right on arbitrum.
01:21:24.402 - 01:21:26.390, Speaker B: And is it private or public groups?
01:21:27.930 - 01:21:30.286, Speaker A: I think it's public because it's Twitter.
01:21:30.338 - 01:21:31.162, Speaker B: So it's like big cloud.
01:21:31.216 - 01:21:39.930, Speaker A: It's like big cloud. Yeah, I think that's what it is. But you could buy and sell people and you could buy and sell posts.
01:21:40.510 - 01:21:42.490, Speaker B: So that's like lens.
01:21:43.470 - 01:22:10.950, Speaker A: It's like a mashup of lens and. But, yeah, I think they did like a million dollars in TvO at one point. And then somebody tweeted out yesterday that the guy just forked someone's GitHub. Yeah. Open source repo. And just added a token and said, we're going to make a million dollars or something. The tv went down to 350k yesterday.
01:22:11.370 - 01:22:11.974, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:22:12.092 - 01:22:14.082, Speaker A: So forks. Bullish. Bearish.
01:22:14.146 - 01:22:16.114, Speaker B: That is reminiscent of d five summer.
01:22:16.162 - 01:22:22.242, Speaker A: Yes, it's happening, but it's happening at a much slower pace. Much slower pace.
01:22:22.306 - 01:22:22.594, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:22:22.652 - 01:22:23.658, Speaker D: It's exciting, though.
01:22:23.744 - 01:22:26.106, Speaker A: It's exciting because no one's on this meta yet.
01:22:26.208 - 01:23:52.966, Speaker C: Yeah, I'd say I'm quite bullish on forks, right? I wouldn't want frontech to be the last iteration of whatever type of app that it's representing, right? Whether there's going to be long lasting utilitarian value, we can't dispute the fact that this is a very effective form of bootstrapping liquidity bootstrapping, creator fan engagement, at least in the beginning, right? And I think over time, as other applications perhaps improve upon bonding curves, perhaps making it easier for people to purchase, it doesn't have to even be keys in the future, right? It could be just any other form of asset, I guess, for a future application. These can have lots of different widespread use cases, right? Or I guess it doesn't even necessarily need to have some kind of financial aspect, right? Like perhaps in the future, if I'm just like a content creator and I want to create my own little private frontech like platform and say, hey, those who interact with my community the most can rack up. I don't know, Eric points. And then later on you get exclusive access to something else that I'm coming out with. Or as I mentioned earlier, some kind of derivatives of this structure can be used for the building of on chain identity for other use cases in the future as well.
01:23:53.068 - 01:24:00.970, Speaker B: You said earlier that frantech smart contract is only 50 lines of code, which means it's super simple. I assume it's just some bundling curve.
01:24:01.310 - 01:24:01.962, Speaker D: That's it.
01:24:02.016 - 01:24:10.678, Speaker B: And if that's the case, why would you need to fork the smart contracts? You can just build new front ends. You can build a Twitter with gamified.
01:24:10.774 - 01:24:53.350, Speaker D: Yeah, I think maybe fork is not the right word, but more like creating new social web. Three social primitives would be the right way to put it. I would love to see more of those and see who has a really cool design or comes up with something completely different on top of this. And we'd be interested in backing it, right? Straight forks I don't think would be as interesting on teams. Yeah, the derivatives that were created recently were literally just trying to copy and paste it onto other chains, and I just don't see how that makes any sense because with social networks, if you've ever used one, the network effect is what literally gives it the value it has. And the switching costs are so high because you can't copy and paste the whole network.
01:24:53.430 - 01:25:51.382, Speaker A: Let me counter that thought right there. So l tweeted the other day that social fi is going to be like amms on every chain they're all going to have their own right, whatever. Right? But you're starting to see if you look at Solana, right? Anatoly is a big proponent of tip, link and frenzy.com. Well, he doesn't really care for frenzy, but frenzy is like a Solana version of Frontech. And these communities are cults already. The layer ones and layer twos are cults themselves. So why would they want to use someone else's on another layer one if they're cults themselves? So I guess to counter that, I agree with the network effects, but if inherently layer ones and layer twos are cult like systems, then could you see this spreading to other layer one? Like, could you see other users from other chains? They're huge proponents of those chains using something like fronttech.
01:25:51.446 - 01:26:36.074, Speaker D: So I understand what you mean by the l one l two cults. But I think when l mentioned it's like amms and all that, I just don't see that happening because DFI's design is inherently different from social Phi, where you've got these amms, you're fighting for liquidity, right? Protocols are all fighting for liquidity because liquidity gives you the lowest price, which means everything gets routed to you and you get more fees. How do you fight for liquidity? You would have a token and people would farm it and throw LP tokens in there and all of that. Right? But as soon as someone gives you even 1% more APR with similar risk, you have zero loyalty to the platform. All you have to do is click a button to transfer your LP token somewhere else.
01:26:36.112 - 01:26:36.410, Speaker A: Right.
01:26:36.480 - 01:26:56.882, Speaker D: It's very easy because these LP tokens, the liquidity that everyone's fighting for, is so fungible and easy to move. But when you have all of this eth liquidity trapped into a bonding curve, and then all the social connections that you've already formed on a social five platform like Frontech, how do you fork that over or migrate that over?
01:26:56.936 - 01:26:57.250, Speaker A: Right.
01:26:57.320 - 01:27:03.394, Speaker D: Sushi made it really simple with migrating your liquidity from uniswap. You just click a button and boom, you're done.
01:27:03.432 - 01:27:03.826, Speaker A: Right?
01:27:03.928 - 01:27:23.562, Speaker D: But if someone creates a fronttech derivative and tries to migrate that liquidity over or the user base over, there's no easy way to do that one. There's an immutable contract with frontech where that ETH can't be extracted out of the bonding curve. Everybody has to click, sell, and take that eth after paying the fees and move it over.
01:27:23.616 - 01:27:24.314, Speaker A: High switching cost.
01:27:24.352 - 01:27:51.300, Speaker D: Yeah, massively high switching cost. I think Defi I mentioned to you before is a big pie, and I think has true utility, but it's just going to be continuously on the back end. The value and the liquidity will be split across thousands and thousands of players as the ocean becomes more and more populated. Meanwhile, I think with social fi, you're going to have a couple big players taking big chunks of the pie.
01:27:52.150 - 01:28:11.914, Speaker A: Let's go to, what do we want to see built on? Because founders are watching this. Right? What are ten different, maybe 510? So much? Three to five ideas. And we talked about lending already. What other ideas would you like to see built?
01:28:12.032 - 01:28:13.898, Speaker C: Could you expand on that question a bit more?
01:28:13.984 - 01:28:24.270, Speaker A: So you released a base proxy contract, right? Where people can transfer keys, do their presales lending. What other utility can you see for that contract?
01:28:25.010 - 01:29:09.926, Speaker D: It's hard to imagine. If I had something that I was really excited about, I had an idea, I would have started building it already. But I'm also brainstorming right now, what more could be there? I think staking is pretty interesting. You could actually build pools where people put it into an ETF or someone creates a manager. Right? Maybe like why? I've heard of this idea, right? And you can actually permissionlessly pay them a cut and they could spray it into different places, and you never have to manage it yourself. You're only just coming in for the financial gain of the keys. Right.
01:29:09.926 - 01:29:28.740, Speaker D: Could be interesting. I don't know. There's a lot more things that you could just take ideas from Defi and then reapply it. Maybe don't reapply the mistakes we made in Defi, but the things that really worked that could really be translatable into this.
01:29:29.270 - 01:29:29.682, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:29:29.736 - 01:30:03.902, Speaker C: It'll be interesting seeing how keys kind of interact, like you said, with Defi or other on chain assets or even nfts. Right? Eventually having people being able to transact in keys in order to swap for a certain NFT, or collateralize your key for taking out a certain loan or getting a certain amount of tokens. Right now it's still operating very much as like an isolated platform in which we're just all transacting keys with one another. But eventually having that be composable with other types of on chain assets could be interesting as well.
01:30:04.036 - 01:30:58.574, Speaker A: Interesting. I see it as a dow because you have a bunch of folks that are in for a certain reason, right? Whether it's the creator, maybe it's the idea, et cetera. And you could build a wrapper on top that allows people to vote on a certain aspect, like whether it's to sell a key whether it's to redirect trading fees and invest into something mean. I could see this as a Dow. I could also see this as an NFT community also because NFT communities, although releasing jpegs out there, it's great, but there isn't a lot of control and systems in place that allows people to do what they want. So I could see this as a, and I think black noise Ansom mentioned this as well. I could see these communities airdropping nfts for people that buy into these accounts as well.
01:30:58.574 - 01:31:20.198, Speaker A: So there's some really interesting elements that can come out of. Yeah, I think we're just getting started. Seems like I'm super excited about this space. Any final questions? Chow? Any final thoughts guys? Nope. Well, thanks so much for joining. Good game and we'll chat with you soon.
01:31:20.364 - 01:31:21.526, Speaker D: Thanks so much for having us.
01:31:21.548 - 01:31:28.100, Speaker A: Of course, very much. Thanks for listening to good game. Don't forget to subscribe. We'll see you next week.
