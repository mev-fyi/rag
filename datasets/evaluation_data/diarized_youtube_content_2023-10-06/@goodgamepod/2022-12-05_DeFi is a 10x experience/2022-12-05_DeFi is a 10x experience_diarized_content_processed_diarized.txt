00:00:00.330 - 00:00:37.522, Speaker A: DFI. You know that experience where you have one account to access a bunch of different products you trade on Yoniswap, and then you move that assets to ave without having to sign up? Without having to sign in? That experience is ten x better than anything I've ever encountered in traditional finance. Because in traditional finance, you have to open a new account to go through KYC on every new account, every new brokerage account, and then you withdraw the money. It takes a few days. It's extremely painful. Defi was far more frictionless. The only point of friction in DeFi, at least back in the day, was you as a user.
00:00:37.522 - 00:00:47.700, Speaker A: The first time you use DeFi, you have to install a browser extension. That, to me, is the only point of friction. But after that, the experience is great. So I actually think that the metamask experience is not necessarily bad.
