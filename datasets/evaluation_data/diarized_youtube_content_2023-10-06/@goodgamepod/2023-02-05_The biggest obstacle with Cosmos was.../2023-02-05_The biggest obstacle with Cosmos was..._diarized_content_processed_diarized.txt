00:00:00.170 - 00:00:12.266, Speaker A: The biggest problem with Cosmos previously was the inability to spin up zones quickly with validators. Right? Like, you have to create your own zone and then you have to recruit your own validators.
00:00:12.378 - 00:00:33.682, Speaker B: That was by far the number one obstacle for builders wanting to launch a new Cosmos zone. It's the same story with Polkadot. And in fact, it's even worse for Polkadot, because in the case of Polka, ah, you also need to own a shit ton of dot the dot token in order to participate in the parachute auction. So in both cases, it's a huge impediment.
00:00:33.746 - 00:00:34.450, Speaker A: Huge impediment.
