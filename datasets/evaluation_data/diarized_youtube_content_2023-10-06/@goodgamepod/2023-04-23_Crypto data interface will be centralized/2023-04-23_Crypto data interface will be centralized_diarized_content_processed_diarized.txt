00:00:00.120 - 00:00:39.144, Speaker A: I agree with this key point that crypto data is fully public and global and open. However, there is a really interesting counter argument that I heard from one of founder it's really interesting precisely because of all the pain points dealing with, specifically with reading on chain data. More and more centralized data providers are going to be built to make it easy for people to query and to read that data. So even though the raw data is completely global and open and public, the end user facing interface will be more centralized and gated. Again, I'm telling the story precisely because of how painful crypto data is to work with for technical people or non technical people out there.
