00:00:00.200 - 00:00:45.612, Speaker A: NFTs could be a great way for musicians to monetize their art, especially like certain types of art. And then they could build a sense of community around this type of art by becoming closer to those fans that do buy these NFTs. Right. You're already starting to see like this direct to consumer models even when it comes to fans, right? Like there's so many artists that are out there that are tweeting or using Instagram as a way to form that, like direct Bond. Kevin Durant, who's like a pretty popular basketball player, created his own discord channel for himself. He left it open for everyone to join. So you're starting to see these two concepts starting to come together, which is how do I build a much closer relationship with my fans? And then two is how do I monetize directly without any middleman.
00:00:45.612 - 00:00:51.044, Speaker A: Yep. And then the idea of NFTs become even more powerful when you think about it from that lens.
