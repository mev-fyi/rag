00:00:02.862 - 00:00:04.006, Speaker B: Number one obstacle.
00:00:04.110 - 00:00:04.990, Speaker A: To mass.
00:00:05.022 - 00:00:06.486, Speaker B: Adoption of crypto, and it's.
00:00:06.510 - 00:00:07.734, Speaker A: Still an largely.
00:00:07.774 - 00:00:08.734, Speaker B: Unsolved problem.
00:00:08.854 - 00:00:10.758, Speaker A: And in my mind, over the last.
00:00:10.846 - 00:00:12.710, Speaker B: Twelve years, 13 years since.
00:00:12.822 - 00:00:13.262, Speaker A: The beginning.

00:00:18.406 - 00:00:21.262, Speaker A: Is the fact that there has been a lot.
00:00:21.278 - 00:00:23.478, Speaker B: Of money to be made that was the main driver.
00:00:23.646 - 00:00:25.886, Speaker A: But in the ideal world, this should.
00:00:25.910 - 00:00:26.766, Speaker B: Not be the driver.
00:00:26.870 - 00:00:29.438, Speaker A: The driver should be a very user.

00:00:30.502 - 00:00:31.334, Speaker A: To onboard into.
00:00:31.374 - 00:00:32.902, Speaker B: Crypto rather than the money.
00:00:32.998 - 00:00:35.014, Speaker A: And so that's why wallets are so important.
