00:00:00.200 - 00:00:31.700, Speaker A: Actually, we wrote about this in our 2024 startup ideas. But basically what we said was we think that the ten K PFPs in general, not just on bitcoin in general, will probably continue to be the most important category of NFTs because you don't need to do anything for it. So think about music NFts or gaming NFTs and others. The existing distribution channels aren't there already. Like for example, with music nfTs, you would need Spotify or Apple Music to support it. Unless you build your own music NFT trading platform. But that really takes time.
00:00:31.700 - 00:00:46.380, Speaker A: Same story with gaming. Gaming NFts. You need the big games to adopt it, unless you build your own game. But that takes time. But with pfps, Twitter is already there. You can use Twitter profile pic to flex your NFT. All the big distribution channels are there.
00:00:46.380 - 00:00:56.284, Speaker A: Nothing needs to be done for what you want to do. There's just memes. Yeah, yeah. Every NFT community is a meme. Every meme coin is a meme. And it's all the same piece.
