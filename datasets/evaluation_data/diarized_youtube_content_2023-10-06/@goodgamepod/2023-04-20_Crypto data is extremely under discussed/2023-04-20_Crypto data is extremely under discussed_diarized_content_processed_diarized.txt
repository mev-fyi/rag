00:00:00.160 - 00:00:58.194, Speaker A: I think this more general topic of crypto data is an extremely under discussed, yet important topic. And the reason why I say that is because a few months ago, I came to the realization that every crypto company is a crypto data indexing company. Every single company spends so much engineering resource to solve their own data problem, and this problem can be solved at scale, horizontally, by a third party data providers. And yet it has not been solved. All of our founders, all of the founders of alliance, every time I talk to them, I would ask them, what is their pain point? And they would tell me, they have problems with data. There's no good data solutions out there, even though millions of dollars of VC money has gone into funding these data startups. So I think data similar to what we talked about earlier about wallets and their ones in previous episodes, are one of the biggest impediments to mass adoption of crypto.
