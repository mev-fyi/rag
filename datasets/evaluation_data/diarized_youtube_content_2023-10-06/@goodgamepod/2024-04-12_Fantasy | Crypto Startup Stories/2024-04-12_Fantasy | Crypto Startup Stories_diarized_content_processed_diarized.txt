00:00:04.240 - 00:00:14.326, Speaker A: Welcome to Founder story. Today we have the founder of Top Fantasy, Kipanon, to talk to us about some of his learnings when launching top fantasy. Welcome.
00:00:14.350 - 00:00:16.794, Speaker B: Hello, Imran. Yeah, thanks for bringing me here.
00:00:17.134 - 00:00:30.646, Speaker A: To me, Top Fantasy has done an incredible job of virality and growth. What are one or two lessons that you could give to people, founders builders, that want to eventually tap into this growth loop?
00:00:30.750 - 00:00:54.958, Speaker B: I think my best advice would be to focus on the distribution and not the product. Overall, I think it's a mistake that a lot of first time funders especially will do. Just focusing, make sure that the product is perfect, but just ship it and really focus on what matters. So being able to sell it and making sure that people understand what you do, interact with what you do. And then once you have this, you can start focusing on product, getting all the feedbacks and fixing everything.
00:00:55.086 - 00:01:10.406, Speaker A: The tap fantasy, the UI is unlike any other app that I've used. Was that deliberate in the sense that you wanted to use like the updated UI UX or a very different UI UX as a way for your growth loop? Like, how did you think about designing your product?
00:01:10.470 - 00:01:33.594, Speaker B: I guess I think one of the key components was trying to hide crypto as much as possible. We just like, we just want to make it as a game. It's like, it's a fun game to play and we really want people to just have fun with this one. And so really, at the heart of fantasy lies this ambition of redefining the intention of gaming, finance and social interaction. So making sure that crypto was hidden was really important for us.
00:01:34.374 - 00:01:39.750, Speaker A: With your launch within three months, I would say you launched your product three months.
00:01:39.942 - 00:01:47.054, Speaker B: Not even, it's two months and a half, something like this. And we started three months ago. So within two weeks before you hit.
00:01:47.094 - 00:01:49.032, Speaker A: 40,000 users, how did you do that?
00:01:49.118 - 00:02:42.364, Speaker B: So I think fantasy is quite gutted in terms of distribution mechanism because we are on top of. So maybe I can just introduce fantasy a bit more. Fantasy. It's a social trading card, games on top of Twitter, where basically all players will earn reward based on their favorite influencers on Twitter. And so we add all these mechanism loops where players were tagging the heroes and heroes were tagging us to know what was that? And so this growth act really allowed us to go to 10,000 daily active users on the platform quite easily. And then I think at the end it's just matters of is the game fun to play? And if it is, then people will just tell their friends and make sure that everyone is getting onboarded. We also have a referral program that is pretty strong, and we use it a lot so that people are getting rewarded if you are onboarding new friends.
00:02:42.994 - 00:02:52.106, Speaker A: And I also noticed that you've decided to build on blast versus the other layer, too. What were the choices or the trade offs you reasoned with before you decided to build up blast?
00:02:52.250 - 00:03:17.794, Speaker B: So pac man with blast and Blur showed how he was able to align everyone in terms of incentive and make sure that a lot of people will come. And we knew that the incentive for blast would be insane, and we knew that it was onto something bigger. There is, like, definitely potential to be one of the first apps and to be the flagship app on blast. That's what we had in mind.
00:03:18.214 - 00:03:19.910, Speaker A: Kibit, thank you so much for your time.
00:03:20.062 - 00:03:21.214, Speaker B: Thank you. Imran. That was nice.
