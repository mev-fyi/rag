00:00:00.160 - 00:00:12.446, Speaker A: I remember us being invested in Dapper Labs back in the day, like 2017 2018. And people were like, why do they invest in a freaking cats game on chain cats game? Obviously they all missed the point.
00:00:12.550 - 00:00:13.638, Speaker B: They got a lot of shit for it.
00:00:13.686 - 00:00:25.198, Speaker A: Exactly. And NFT games were actually the most obvious go to market for any layer one. That's why they invested in Dapper Labs, who eventually built flow the flow blockchain.
00:00:25.326 - 00:00:33.960, Speaker B: I saw no other use cases for NFTs back then, except for games. Like I was reading through my old articles that I published back then around 2018. I only talked about games.
00:00:34.072 - 00:00:34.608, Speaker A: Same thing.
00:00:34.656 - 00:00:35.512, Speaker B: Never saw anything else.
00:00:35.568 - 00:00:47.424, Speaker A: I thought of nfts as collectibles. I did not think of NFTs as digital identity, which, by the way, five years later today is the main thing behind apes and punks. Yep.
