00:00:00.440 - 00:00:02.761, Speaker A: Welcome to GoodGame. Your no BS insights.
00:00:02.793 - 00:00:04.125, Speaker B: For crypto founders.
00:00:07.905 - 00:00:14.353, Speaker A: Was there ever a period where you're like, we're done. Was there ever a period where you say where you wanted to quit?
00:00:14.449 - 00:00:45.263, Speaker B: First of all, capitalism is like kind of a hack that should eliminate that feeling ever coming up and being persistent. And then within capitalism, crypto is also another hack because in capitalism you can risk capital that is not yours. Sure, you can lose all of it and then you can just go do another thing. So, you know, until you're out of money and out of options, it's never done. And then even when it's done, it's not that bad. You've just gotten a bunch of experience, you can go do it again with another idea or the same idea even. Right.
00:00:45.263 - 00:01:03.747, Speaker B: And then within capitalism, crypto is also such an incredible hack because you can actually have the company fail, run out of money, you can stop making payroll and the project can still. It might actually do better. So where is it over? Where is it truly over?
00:01:03.811 - 00:01:27.885, Speaker A: There is less than a month until Alliance's All 14 application deadline on November 20th. Head to Alliance XYZ today and submit your application. We just made it 2/3 shorter and easier. I want to go back to how you and Anatolia actually met and how did you guys. Founders are always trying to figure, figure out who the right person they should be working with. How did you know Anatoly was the one?
00:01:29.225 - 00:02:21.829, Speaker B: Well, I'll start by saying it's similar to the situation with my wife. I knew she was the one, I knew he was the one. They didn't know I was the one. So yeah, the first time I met Anatoly was I was working with this guy Eric, and we were both in health tech at a company called Amada, where biology was actually on the board of it. I was leading product management, he was leading data science. And that was one of the first really kind of non technical technical partnership situations that really worked out well for me, which was he had this really big vision for randomized controlled trials in population health management. And he knew how to build it, he knew what to do, and he just needed everything out of his way.
00:02:21.829 - 00:02:36.413, Speaker B: And that was the role that I played with Eric. So Eric goes way back with Anatoly. They're friends from way before. They did Iron Man's together. Nice. They go cycling together. They live near each other in San Diego.
00:02:36.413 - 00:03:32.581, Speaker B: So Eric invited a bunch of people, including me and Anatoly, to a camping trip in point Reyes in 2014, I think. And that was the first time I Met Tully. I don't think Tully remembers me, but I remember Tully because I'd been in Silicon Valley for years doing startups. And when you meet an engineer that is so laser focused on their work and yet is funny, is fun, is interesting and kind of low ego, has a personality, it just kind of sticks in your mind. So I had a lot of engineers that I thought might be interesting to work with at some point. And then later in 2017, Eric started telling me, you remember? Totally. You gotta talk to him.
00:03:32.581 - 00:04:03.629, Speaker B: He's got this. He wants to go into crypto, he wants to go into blockchain. He's got this idea for how to solve scalability. And I had spent a lot of time with engineers who were really captivated with crypto. I had done some, you know, very basic, like investing and owned some, you know, Ethereum and Bitcoin. But I wasn't sure, is this like a 20 years off thing or a 10 years off thing or 50 years? Like, when is the time going to be? Because, you know, I wanted to swing for the fences and connect on something. But I took Eric's advice.
00:04:03.629 - 00:05:15.953, Speaker B: I started having coffee with Totally and I pretty quickly got the sense like, you know, if anyone was going to solve this problem, he is probably amongst the best of them that has the most conviction, that is ready to go swing for the fences at it. He at the time was leading compression at Dropbox and he left his job. That to me was the big signal, you know, he left his job, he's going full time writing this white paper. I got to at least, you know, listen to Eric and, and hear him out and see if I can help in any way. And yeah, there was a certain point where, you know, it just sort of clicked that while I wasn't sure if, if the idea was going to work and I wasn't sure if, you know, if it was prime time for crypto. I, I was at least happy to spend six months helping this really awesome guy, just like, get off the ground, not make bad hires, not raise too little or too much money, all the little dumb things that kill startups in the first six months. I was just like, I know how to do that stuff.
00:05:15.953 - 00:05:35.779, Speaker B: Let me just sprint away with him for six months. It was kind of like a project at the time. I just was really gonna help him and then, and then see where it went from there. You know, this was 2018, this was early 2017. Or, sorry, late 2017. Early 2018.
00:05:35.867 - 00:05:39.667, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, the bubble popped. Bear market.
00:05:39.731 - 00:06:02.357, Speaker B: Yep. So, you know, we got the Money. We lost a bunch of it holding. Holding eth, because that's all anyone wanted to transfer to us. And we were really religious about having secure custody, which, you know, we had to go through a lot of hoops for. And getting a bank account was incredibly difficult. So, you know, getting the ETH into dollars was just not a trivial effort.
00:06:02.357 - 00:06:12.397, Speaker B: And by the time we actually did it, we had, we had lost like around $5 million of the, like, you know, 13 that we, that we raised. So was this a public sale or.
00:06:12.421 - 00:06:13.933, Speaker A: This is just an investor sale?
00:06:13.989 - 00:06:28.365, Speaker B: This was with private investors. So, you know, that was when like multicoin and slow ventures and foundation capital. Wow. And all of them came in. Yeah, was in like spring of 2018, basically. Yeah.
00:06:28.905 - 00:06:34.129, Speaker A: Got it. So in his mind, how did he think you were the right founder?
00:06:34.217 - 00:07:27.429, Speaker B: Like, I think I just kept showing up and, you know, and just, you know, tried to get everything out of his way. Right. It's, you know, I didn't want him spending time with lawyers that he didn't need to. I didn't want spending time with accountants that he didn't need to just give him enough visibility and control to give us a sense of what's important for Solana, the open source project to find life and reach its potential. And everything else is implementation details. That's my job to get out of the way. I think an important thing too was, and this is what I always advise, early stage startups that are like two or three people to do is the first five to 10 people that you hire is just so critical.
00:07:27.429 - 00:08:08.553, Speaker B: You're writing the DNA, you're literally putting in genes that are just going to propagate into this organism that you could have never imagined. And it all traces back to those first decisions. And so why wouldn't you just have the highest bar you possibly could? Dream so big that it seems impossible. One of the things that I tried to do in those days was just listen to Tolle and the other founding engineers and get a sense like, who are the people out there that are unhirable? We couldn't get them even if we tried. There's no way we could afford them. We could throw all the money in the bank at them and we'd never win them. I want to know who they are and I want to go get them.
00:08:08.553 - 00:09:01.031, Speaker B: Right. And so one of the ones that, you know, first of all, another thing that was pretty clear about Tully is most every engineer that we talked to, once they heard Tully was doing something, they were pretty at least ready to talk. And Most of them were because he had a reputation. He had a reputation. He was, you know, kind of like in Seal Team 6, solving a lot of the hardest challenges at Qualcomm for many years. And I think a lot of what we know about him today at a much more public level was very apparent to a large group of engineers, primarily the ones who spent time working in the core kernel for brew, the operating system for flip phones. It seemed like in that project there was a lot of legends made.
00:09:01.031 - 00:09:29.193, Speaker B: Yeah, a lot of legends made. And Tully was one of them. And so that makes easy work. Right. When you have a technical leader that has a lot of war stories and battle scars with a lot of other really fantastic engineers, most of the work has already been done. You just gotta convert. So one of the things that I try to do as an example is like really narrow in on those ones that just were hesitating and had really fat salaries.
00:09:29.193 - 00:10:22.763, Speaker B: Maybe they were doing earnouts from some big acquisition at a giant fang company and just push past objections and sell them and convince them that this was the right move. So I did a lot of flying around and doing late night phone calls, sometimes with the spouses, not even the people we wanted to hire, but the people that they shared a home with. And just making sure we constructed that first 10 or so people the right way was really important and totally. He knew exactly who he wanted. Right. He also had to code. And so I think it's really important to have that left brain, right brain, you know, somebody who's, who's really a great technologist and somebody who gets everything out of their way.
00:10:22.763 - 00:10:25.775, Speaker B: If that's the formation you want to have for co founders.
00:10:26.715 - 00:10:58.425, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, but you guys like. I mean, it permeates very clearly as an outside spectator, looking outside in for Solana branding. Right. And the Solana, the Solana Labs, Solana, the ecosystem. It's very clear. There's one message from Toly, which is light speed, throughput scale, efficiency. And then the other side of the message is really the growth of marketing and then growing the ecosystem.
00:10:58.425 - 00:11:08.249, Speaker A: It's 50% on both sides. It's done very efficiently. Is that what you mean by left and right brain? Like utilizing your expert? Is that your superpower?
00:11:08.397 - 00:11:09.017, Speaker B: Well, I think.
00:11:09.081 - 00:11:10.445, Speaker A: What's your superpower? I guess.
00:11:10.945 - 00:11:42.145, Speaker B: I think I'm a generalist. I always have been. I think the things that I, back when we started Solana, the things that I was really good at, I was great at product, actually, I was good at product. Not great. I was not the best Product manager. But I empathize with and worked really hard for the engineering and design and data science teams that I worked with to just like drive them to achieve something that made them really happy and proud. Right.
00:11:42.145 - 00:12:34.375, Speaker B: Was I, you know, the best product owner over many years in a company at a like 9 to 5 job? No, but the skillset of just like coordinating and project managing was something that, you know, that I slotted into really well. And then within that I've always really cared about great design. So, you know, I've probably spent thousands of hours designing, you know, products, brands, logos, I designed our logo, the whole branding, everything like that. I also, you know, do enough kind of front end where I made our whole first website and all the animations and all that stuff. So, you know, I think this is one of the things, I mean we started our first seed round was going to be like 500k, right. So it was really important that we didn't need to hire eight different people to do all these things. That may be different for other teams.
00:12:34.375 - 00:13:30.479, Speaker B: But I think there's something you get out of having a really small, tight team where everyone wears different hats. Because this points to something else we talked about earlier, which is it forces you to actually do and understand enough of the critical things, such that when you do hire a specialist, you have an intimate understanding of what they do and how to manage them and what success looks like and what efficiency looks like. So I still have a lot of opinions about the website, for example, and it's because it's literally the same code base that I started. Right. And yeah, I think the complementary sort of duality of left brain, right brain is like, it's also a very common pattern in crypto. So it's surprising to me sometimes that you don't see more co founder relationships that kind of have that, that duality.
00:13:30.607 - 00:13:34.743, Speaker A: So for founders that are looking for other founders, look for someone that can compliment you.
00:13:34.839 - 00:13:35.555, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:13:36.055 - 00:13:57.487, Speaker A: Versus skills and the skills that overlap and domain expertise that overlap. That's a good point. So there's one like reoccurring like trait that I've learned about you. Just I mean like obviously we've chatted via web, but it's just like you're very persistent. I don't know if that's, if that's.
00:13:57.511 - 00:14:01.195, Speaker B: What it is like bullheaded about. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:14:01.935 - 00:14:48.831, Speaker A: And I think that's. And then like, you know, like going back to like Alon from Pump, he was. And the team, they were persistent. They sent out 3,000 plus DMS to get the product off the ground. If you look back to like the successes of like Jupiter and Matoran, you know, they were persistent even with the rise of competition, the early days or, you know, it's just, you know, I feel like skills are obviously one and domain expertise is one incredible skill that you need. But I also think is, you know, persistence, believing in the vision and especially for, you know, obviously there was, you know, I would say Solano went through many crisis over the past four or five years, but I feel like persistence and long term vision is probably something that held you guys together.
00:14:49.023 - 00:15:16.595, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. I mean, I think it's an inevitability that shit's going to hit the fan, right? Like something's going to go wrong otherwise you aren't taking a real risk. Like if it's predictable, deterministic, that you're building something that's going to work, then it would have already been built and it would have already worked before. And so there's no real opportunity there. So it's all about what do you have to lean on when shit does hit the fan. And I think, you know, let's start with the really easy stuff.
00:15:16.595 - 00:15:54.237, Speaker B: If you just work with people you like, you have a good culture, your friends, you believe in them, which is, you know, for me that was enough in the early days with Toly. It's just like, he's a good guy, I want to help him. You know, that'll keep me getting up at night because he cares enough about this thing that I care about, you know, him winning. I want him to win. That doesn't always take you far, right. Sometimes you might really disagree about the path forward and you need something else to lean on. And I think the much more difficult to nail down end of the spectrum is vision.
00:15:54.237 - 00:16:43.803, Speaker B: Like, you can be a nice person and have a small vision or you can have a really big vision and be a really difficult person. Um, but one thing we were, you know, chatting about earlier is just a vision that is kind of infinitely. It gives you infinite progression. Like, you know, we were talking about Dropbox. I always look back at Dropbox, I was like, you know, they were, they were on fire and then they just sort of like petered out. And I think you can kind of trace it down to, you know, when did they achieve their vision? Their vision was, you know, seamless file sharing across platforms in such a way that the user doesn't really know or care whether they are interacting with a file on the Internet or locally. And they achieved that.
00:16:43.803 - 00:17:25.643, Speaker B: That was an achievable product vision, but that is not an infinitely progressable and unachievable company vision. And so when, when they kind of got to that point, they didn't really know, like, what should our next product be? What is the North Star? What is our truth? And I think, you know, again with Tully, it was very clear from, from day one that as long as there is any delta between the physical limitations of how fast and cheap consensus can be achieved in a permissionless distributed system, as long as there's any delta between the performance you see in the network.
00:17:25.699 - 00:17:26.107, Speaker A: Yes.
00:17:26.211 - 00:18:37.553, Speaker B: And what physical limitations are, and without sharding, that's where there is endless work to do. And the example that he always gave that I just thought was like, so it's kind of a joke, but I thought it was really illustrative of how relentless he was willing to be about this vision is that he said the first boundary we're gonna run into when we make sufficient progress towards this vision is just the latency of light speed around the earth. And you have to deal with curvature. And that curvature is never going to be as efficient as a straight line. And the way you would achieve the straight line is you learn to manipulate and sense neutrinos because neutrinos can cut through matter at some point. If we have to build a neutrino based communication network to reduce latency in the network, we will do that. And yeah, I think like, he genuinely believes that if, you know, if he's alive 50 years from now, and that's the limitation, like, and the science is there, that he will figure out how to do that.
00:18:37.553 - 00:19:41.185, Speaker B: And you know, he loves the problem that much. And you already, it's funny, it's only been four years since we launched the network, right? It was March 16, 2020, and you have now, Double Zero is working on making a faster Internet to be able to make Fire Dancer faster, to be able to make Solana faster. Right. So that relentlessness and unachievability of that vision is, it's happening as part of Solana's culture, not even directly from Anatoly. So I think that is really important. It manifests persistence because, you know, there is, there is a North Star, there is a goal that you're working toward. And then, you know, honestly, there, there, I think Tolle has taught me so much about this, but there's always another motivation you can find, right? Is there, you know, a rivalry, you know, some, somebody in the market that, you know that, that maybe picked on you, that you want to get revenge on you know, is there, I have a big list.
00:19:41.185 - 00:20:19.135, Speaker B: Is there a product experience that you look at and it just makes you feel kind of sick and it makes you feel viscerally like you want to get out of bed and just solve it just so that people don't have to deal with that or you don't have to deal with it. It could be a totally selfish motivation. But I think learning to juggle between these motivations to find that constant persistence is just like having a different motivation in mile one versus mile 23 for why you are just going to put that next foot forward. And I think that is a really important kind of learnable trait for great founders.
00:20:19.635 - 00:20:35.555, Speaker A: Over the past four years, I've seen Solana launch. I mean, I even remember the first days when we had to use Soleil Wallet. And the biggest problem that I had in my mind was the private keys weren't encrypted. I was like, what am I doing?
00:20:35.635 - 00:20:38.825, Speaker B: A lot of problems with that was fun.
00:20:39.245 - 00:21:20.783, Speaker A: But then instantly did a swap and I saw the magic. It was like, wow, I get it. And so I guess from like how did you, like in the early days, how did you recruit your first 50 to 100 people to come build on Salana? Like what, what did you do to get them? And I know you mentioned a lot of like cold DMing and things like that. Was that it? And the reason why I'm bringing this up is because, which will get to my second point, which is, you know, people told you go get KOLs and you mentioned something that was very powerful, which makes sense now, which is don't go after celebrities, make the celebrities so they kind of go hand in hand. So if you can walk me through that.
00:21:20.839 - 00:22:20.781, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I guess, yeah. Let's start with what we, what we didn't do right? To get our first. Let's start with that because, you know, the second you and I'm sure this, this was seven years ago, I'm sure the same thing happens now. But the second you say we have a crypto project and you get any kind of visibility for it, you know, somebody well known in the space, just even retweets or anything, you're going to start getting DMs on every channel saying, I can market your project, I can make the telegram group, I can be a community manager, I can create content, I can recruit other KOLs who will also do all of these things. I'll make the army to make your project successful from a marketing perspective on the Internet. And it's super first of All I just thought it was really annoying. It's like, if 100 people are messaging me with the same thing, this is probably not a valuable service and there's probably a lot of hidden costs.
00:22:20.781 - 00:22:46.967, Speaker B: And also to me, it just felt premature. We had not actually built. We. We had not validated the thesis, can you make a high performance permissionless network that's globally distributed? And so we just basically hit ignore, hit block on all of those messages. Categorically, we said, we'll never pay for anybody to talk about the project.
00:22:47.151 - 00:22:49.407, Speaker A: What led you to that? Was it just.
00:22:49.551 - 00:23:28.415, Speaker B: It just honestly, it felt scammy. It felt like. And honestly, without naming projects, there were other higher performance L1s that had raised 100 plus million dollars, some had raised billions, and they had not validated anything about their architecture. They had not really solved any fundamental scaling problems. Some of them had not even launched yet. And they were building basically multilevel marketing.
00:23:29.035 - 00:23:30.003, Speaker A: Fundraising scam.
00:23:30.059 - 00:24:04.037, Speaker B: Yeah. In China and other developing countries to get people to just be excited about their token. So to me, that seemed, I think to all of us, it just seemed like if you did this in Silicon Valley and tried to manufacture. That's the story of Theranos and other things, just manufacture that kind of capital market interest in something that has no validation, it's like, that's fraud. That's not good. So it was really just sort of instinctive. We probably shouldn't do that.
00:24:04.037 - 00:24:57.595, Speaker B: But even just as a practical matter, this is what we were talking about with the accelerator cohort earlier. Why would you, on day one, outsource, you know, this really important function, which is you need the market to understand and care about your project and get educated about it and learn about it and engage with it. Why would you, like day one, just hand that off to somebody else that you just met on the Internet through a DM like that? That doesn't seem right. So, you know, function of timing, just gut feeling and practicality. We instead just focused on building the network and talking only about the decisions that were going into building the network. And, you know, this was totally. Was really adamant about this, that it should all happen in public.
00:24:57.595 - 00:25:35.017, Speaker B: And to me, as somebody with more of a marketing brain, I was just like, okay, well, this will be good. Because the people who show up, even if it's just fun, 5 or 10 or 100, they're going to be showing up for exactly the right reasons. There will be no signal to them to pay attention to this project other than the technical choices being made at the time it was happening. In a Telegram thread. So literally core engineering was not talking about any engineering decisions in a Slack channel or anything non public. It was all happening in the telegram. And at the time, we didn't know if it was going to pique anyone's interest.
00:25:35.017 - 00:26:30.225, Speaker B: But the people who came in, they didn't have to, like, wade through a wall of when token questions and all these things. They were just able to like, see, you know, the engineering team working and see the quality of the engineering team. And, you know, sure enough, at some point it just went parabolic and there were, you know, overnight there were like 30,000 people in that telegram, literally just watching, you know, engineers debating about, you know, the architecture of what would become Solana. But I think that was an important learning that, you know, just by doing the work well and showcasing the talent and the hard decisions, that is like a form of marketing. It's a form of, you know, of reaching the audience that we cared about. But it was doing it on our terms, in our way. And so, you know, even today, if you, if you look at, you know, Twitter or the press, it's.
00:26:30.225 - 00:27:12.111, Speaker B: Everything that's happening is organic. There's, there's nothing that's been like, paid for and there's always this bent towards coming back to hard engineering problems, hard engineering decisions, practical product decisions, and, you know, talking shop and debating, like that's, that's still really core to the DNA. And it's, it's, it's scaled to a level that like, we could never have predicted. Um, so, yeah, I mean, I think not outsourcing those types of things is really important. And, you know, again, some of this was lucky for us just because, you know, we didn't really have the resources to like, even go hire a bunch of people to do these things.
00:27:12.183 - 00:27:13.575, Speaker A: Constraints. Financial constraints.
00:27:13.615 - 00:27:14.275, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:27:15.095 - 00:27:22.663, Speaker A: Another lesson, I mean, just in the same vein, which is when you do, when you wear multiple hats, you know exactly who to hire for.
00:27:22.759 - 00:27:23.351, Speaker B: Right.
00:27:23.503 - 00:27:27.355, Speaker A: Which is what you. I think you alluded to this during our program.
00:27:27.655 - 00:28:10.959, Speaker B: Yeah, actually, the first BD hire that we made was from that Telegram channel. Oh, wow. There was this guy that we just saw, like around the clock. He was groking, you know, the progress of the development of the network. He was digesting Tully's answers to, you know, observers about why we were, you know, building the network a certain way, and he was reflecting them back and he was accurate and, you know, he showed understanding. And so I just got him on the phone, I was like, hey, man, who are you? And he was a project manager for commercial construction projects in Australia. Wow.
00:28:11.007 - 00:28:12.455, Speaker A: Random. Random.
00:28:12.495 - 00:28:25.115, Speaker B: Yeah. And. And he was incredible. And his. His name is Dom. He's still, you know, still does all kinds of things and is. Is super active, especially in Asia kind of solana communities.
00:28:25.115 - 00:28:49.115, Speaker B: But, yeah, I mean, he was like the main. So if you look at those photos of me and Tully in that Asia Roadshow in late 2019, it was me, Tolle, and Dom. Dom's the one who introduced us to Maotai and gave us the liquor to drown our sorrows when we had no money coming to us in late 2019.
00:28:49.975 - 00:28:58.327, Speaker A: Was there ever a period where you're like, we're done. We're just gonna. Was there ever a period where you said where you wanted to quit?
00:28:58.511 - 00:29:33.695, Speaker B: Okay, so I feel like, first of all, capitalism is, like, kind of a hack that should eliminate that feeling ever coming up and being persistent. And then within capitalism, crypto is also another hack, because in capitalism, you can risk capital that is not yours. Sure, you can lose all of it, and then you can just go do another thing. So, you know, until you're out of money and out of options, it's never done. And then even once it's done, it's not that bad. You've just gotten a bunch of experience, you can go do it again with another idea or the same idea even. Right.
00:29:33.695 - 00:30:25.095, Speaker B: And then within capitalism, crypto is also such an incredible hack because you can actually have the company fail, run out of money, you can stop making payroll, and the project can still. It might actually do better. So where is it over? Where is it truly over? The only place that it ever really ends is when the founders give up, when the team gives up. And everyone just decides this is not a vision worth pursuing anymore. And there's a million ways that they try to act like they haven't given up, but everyone knows when they've given up. And so I think, again, I thought I was persistent, and you know that I am pretty persistent. Tully is persistent at a level I have never encountered in any other human being.
00:30:25.095 - 00:30:48.225, Speaker B: So he has it baked into him. I think it's some kind of, like, USSR thing, or. I don't know what it is. But, you know, he's an endurance athlete, he's a masochist, he loves to suffer. And so he's always going to be showing up. There's no question about that. So that's a constant source of that persistence.
00:30:48.225 - 00:31:19.977, Speaker B: But also, we're playing a game that is. It's like you have the cheat codes on. You're in this great capitalist system and then you have permissionless products that can persist even if you fail. Um, so yeah, I, I think maybe, maybe I should be like a David Goggins of like, you know, I should just make a bunch of recordings just saying that same thing and reminding people like, you're, you're, you can do it. There's no reason to give up. You're, you're, you're living the charmed life already just by working on this.
00:31:20.041 - 00:32:04.311, Speaker A: Yeah. You know, another I think master, like a masterstroke of success that you guys have is like the way you constructed your team both from an, like, you know, I think the biggest challenge that founders go through from a startup perspective is like when to hire your first bd, when to hire your first coo, you know, how do you expand your team? And so like, maybe if you could give us a few lessons on like, how did you do that? Like, how did you know? When was it? Like when Dom came through the telegram chat. How did you know you need a D, a BD person? How did you do marketing? And then. Yeah, and let's start with that. And then I also have to say, like some of the guys that, I mean, most of the people on Salon, I mean, I'd say all of the Solana folks you've hired are pretty goaded too.
00:32:04.423 - 00:32:04.983, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:32:05.119 - 00:32:11.047, Speaker A: So, like, I just want to get dynamics of like, how was it constructed before? And then maybe your transition to where it's at now.
00:32:11.111 - 00:32:11.519, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:32:11.607 - 00:32:13.439, Speaker A: And then we could talk about hiring.
00:32:13.607 - 00:32:34.037, Speaker B: Okay. I think I have maybe 15 minutes until I have to go. And I'd be down to do a whole nother episode just on that. But let me try to just start with, with a few of the things that I, that I think were important. One, I always look back at like WhatsApp, you know, when WhatsApp sold for, what was it? It was so there.
00:32:34.101 - 00:32:34.421, Speaker A: There.
00:32:34.493 - 00:32:36.989, Speaker B: Yeah, it was like $8 billion.
00:32:37.037 - 00:32:38.665, Speaker A: Yeah, it was like that. Yeah. Eight.
00:32:39.365 - 00:32:52.785, Speaker B: It might have even been 18 billion. It was, it was a, it was a huge number. Right. And, and I think there were something like 89 people in the team. And that was kind of like crazy. Yeah. Minecraft, I think was like one guy and sold for a billion.
00:32:52.785 - 00:33:06.233, Speaker B: So, you know, you see this, this trend and Sam Altman talks about it a lot. There's going to be a one person unicorn, which I thought Minecraft was kind of already that. But you know, there will probably be many like one person daos, funds.
00:33:06.249 - 00:33:06.929, Speaker A: Only one person.
00:33:07.017 - 00:33:22.385, Speaker B: Yeah. So that's the goal. Right. That's where we're asymptotically approaching. In fact, at some point it'll be zero person starts. It'll be just AI agents, you know, just making billionaires, spawning companies. So, so, you know, what's.
00:33:22.385 - 00:33:39.929, Speaker B: Where were we on that curve was the question. Right. And our belief was we can make. For us, it wasn't ever about a billion dollar number or anything. It was about achieving the vision. You have this vast, endless, highly ambitious vision. It's probably, it always felt like something like a trillion dollar vision.
00:33:39.929 - 00:34:28.017, Speaker B: Like, you know, whether it's the network or any company within it or just the amount of value that gets produced because this thing existed, felt like a trillion dollar vision. And so we were, we said, can we achieve that with 20 less than 25 people? That, that was one of the hypotheses. Right? We will, we will not hire above 25 and we will achieve everything that we, that we ever sought out to do. Okay, well, you know, when you get to 25, first you have to start asking, all right, who, you know, who's got to go? Because if we're going to keep this, if we're going to keep this headcount low, like you know, who's, who's getting off the boat to let someone else on. And that's, I think, a question that most teams just don't go through. They just blow past 25, blow past 100. Once you get past 100, it's very difficult to ever get back below 100.
00:34:28.017 - 00:35:11.977, Speaker B: Like I've seen this before, you wake up one day and you're 250 and then it's a short path to a thousand. We've seen that. You know, you've seen so many layer one teams, foundations, exchanges, like they get into the thousands and everyone's asking what are they all doing? It's just that it's like a cancer, it metastasizes. So the 25 person rule was hard and fast until we really just were racking our brains and we were missing opportunities and we felt we had to get past it. And then it was 50 and then it was 75 and then it was 100. But we never got into hundreds of people. I think we got to a point where the network really has completely a life of its own.
00:35:11.977 - 00:35:20.801, Speaker B: And there's dozens of people at the orgs that we started. Okay, not hundreds. Right. So I feel pretty good about that. And we actually.
00:35:20.833 - 00:35:21.845, Speaker A: So less than 100.
00:35:22.185 - 00:35:47.685, Speaker B: It's like. So it's split up now. There's Anza, you know, there's the Fire Dancer team. There's teams that we didn't start and then there's the foundation and there's labs where totally is. So across all of those, you know, there's something like 150 or something like that. Right. And in any one of them there's still those small efficient teams where everyone can be in one room and you can kind of feed everybody with a few pizzas.
00:35:47.685 - 00:36:23.591, Speaker B: And those teams are shrinking, not growing, because people keep finding amazing opportunities, they keep starting companies, they get funding, and we don't really do a ton of backfilling because actually a lot of the functions of these teams are being served without the team's help. So I think being relentless about team size, setting these just arbitrary rules and forcing yourself to come back to them, that's one of the things that a co founding relationship can be valuable for. Because one of you could just lose track and the other one's like, hey man, didn't we talk about this?
00:36:23.703 - 00:36:24.447, Speaker A: We read it.
00:36:24.511 - 00:36:51.131, Speaker B: Here's the paper. We wrote that one night. And then the other thing, I learned this in startups before I got into crypto, but just team composition is really important. And again, I think it's important to just set arbitrary rules that you have to consciously violate if you're going to violate them. So for instance, I always thought it was important to have something like three engineers to every non engineer.
00:36:51.243 - 00:36:53.011, Speaker A: Yeah, that's an interesting metric that stood out to me.
00:36:53.043 - 00:37:04.203, Speaker B: Yeah. Why three to one? I don't know. I can tell you that I've never seen a 3 to 1 team where the 1 non engineer ended up like wasting everyone's time.
00:37:04.259 - 00:37:04.571, Speaker A: Sure.
00:37:04.643 - 00:37:44.105, Speaker B: I've seen two non engineers to three engineers where the two non engineers are disagreeing and they're pulling in engineers and they're asking, what do you think? And oh, should we. Is this really achievable in the roadmap? You start thinking and talking all the time because you can't actually build anything. So anytime you get a free cycle, it goes into this analysis. And analysis can cause paralysis. So I think you want to be engineer constrained and you want everyone who's not building to be constantly having to prove themselves as valuable and useful for the people that are building. And one of the ways you can do that is just set these rules about ratio. If you're going to break it, break it consciously.
00:37:44.105 - 00:38:44.811, Speaker B: I learned this because I saw organizations that scaled salesforces way too fast with products that were not mature, they weren't ready, they hadn't validated, they didn't even know if the product was going to scale, but they start hiring the salesforce. When the salespeople outnumber the engineers, they're going to start telling, you know, they're going to start telling you what you have to build to make the sale, you know, and, and it just starts to define the mind of this organism. So, you know, there's a bunch of other stories I can tell and rules and all these things, but it's, it's, it's just about, you know, being really conscious about how you construct that. That org and knowing that the decisions are 10 times as important in the first 10th and then within the first 10th of that 10th, they're 10 times as important. Which all boils down to who's your co founder, who's the person, you know, that you're going to go make this thing with. That is like a critically important decision. So, yeah, we should do another episode.
00:38:44.843 - 00:39:00.095, Speaker A: About we need to do this. Yeah, yeah, we could do. I have a lot of questions and it's the stuff that I've learned as well. Two more questions and I think we'll be good. Obviously, there was no playbook. I think Ethereum was a playbook as far as how to launch a chain.
00:39:00.135 - 00:39:00.359, Speaker B: Right.
00:39:00.407 - 00:39:10.335, Speaker A: And so the demographic for who's on Ethereum within the Ethereum foundation and Ethereum and et cetera, it's very different.
00:39:10.375 - 00:39:10.575, Speaker B: Right.
00:39:10.615 - 00:39:24.839, Speaker A: It's more research heavy. They didn't have a BD team or a marketing team. And I felt like when you constructed a team, you hired a lot of the guys from like, that would say Fang per se, but more startups, you.
00:39:24.847 - 00:39:43.787, Speaker B: Know, Uber was a big Uber. I feel like when I saw, like, because I was in San Francisco. Yeah, like hailing taxis and you just couldn't get to places. And then one day you could call an Uber. It was incredible. It was this, you know, phenomenal thing. And so the, I mean, I'm a huge fan of Travis Gallant.
00:39:43.787 - 00:39:44.803, Speaker B: Me too. Like, I just think he's.
00:39:44.859 - 00:39:45.675, Speaker A: I'm a fanboy.
00:39:45.755 - 00:40:16.595, Speaker B: The biggest badass ever. And you know, the way that he constructed and empowered the Uber launch program, to me felt like it would be very transferable to crypto in some way. So, you know, the multilevel marketing schemes and all that stuff sounded just way wrong. But the important part about launchers were they weren't just about getting. Getting riders. They had to get riders, they had to get drivers. If there was some objection, some roadblock, they had to push through it.
00:40:16.595 - 00:40:55.865, Speaker B: But you had autonomy of people owning markets and having a really long Leash. And they were all founder archetypes. They were people who could have absolutely gone and founded their own company, but they chose to be part of this collective of founders standing up a global marketplace and doing it at record speeds. Right. They took over the world so fast. So, you know, I think there's a lot of things, some of it was literally just hiring X Uber people, but not the late X Uber people. The early, yeah, the early X uber OGs, you know, they knew the playbook, they knew what to do.
00:40:55.865 - 00:41:30.639, Speaker B: And then, and then the other part is just I still haven't figured out how to like, you know, make a rule set for this. But finding founder mentalities, like, you know, I, for me sometimes it's just like I can look in someone's like, you're a founder, I can tell you you're a founder archetype. Like, you know, you're ready to run through walls, you've got something, you know, coursing through you, you've got a chip on your shoulder. Like there's, you know, just smelling that on people and getting them out from whatever non founder situation they're in is, is a really important skill.
00:41:30.807 - 00:42:22.361, Speaker A: Last question. And we were talking about this before the camera was rolling, which is, you know, every founder, you know, we talked about founder success, right? Like once the founder success happens, you kind of burn out because you've achieved your goal. And I, you know, I jokingly said like, I hope we never win, win and that there's continuous like battle so that I can continue battling. In your case, like how do you think about that? Because right now obviously Solana is what a lot of people talk about. A lot of founders are building on there and cycles happen, right. And there could be Ethereum and others that will come back. And how do you continue pushing yourself? The founder mentality, how do you achieve the goal and push the goal forward? And there's this always, I would say this construct of pushing yourself forward.
00:42:22.361 - 00:42:27.045, Speaker A: And how do you do that both yourself internally and then also a team?
00:42:27.125 - 00:43:14.005, Speaker B: Yeah, well, we talked about having an endless unachievable mission and vision. Right. I think that's important. Like, can you give some examples? Well, so we said Dropbox is not a good example, but I think Google is a great example because, you know, organize the world's information is just not an achievable goal. You could always be working towards it and never fully get there, which will always reveal some insight about what comes next to get you closer to that impossible outcome. And I think for Solana it really is it's like one uncharted species wide state machine that achieves consensus at light speed and is bound only by physics. I think actually that is achievable.
00:43:14.005 - 00:43:45.267, Speaker B: It's technically achievable, but we're not there yet. And you know, I think for a, for a decentralized protocol, it's okay to have an achievable goal, but it should be wildly ambitious. Right. Like, you know, I think the kind of unachievable thing is that we want all of this species finance running on that network. Yeah. And so in a way you could say, like our focus is to organize and digitize all the world's marketplaces. Well, you know, everything's a marketplace.
00:43:45.267 - 00:44:20.229, Speaker B: Like literally everything, you know, is finance. Everything is a two sided, you know, deal. So that might be an unachievable vision. But I think so, you know, having a big vision, having people you like working with are probably the two, the two biggest ones. And then, you know, honestly, I think figuring out what form of work life balance matters for you, I think is important. We were talking about kids. I think kids are a great, like, you know, they give you endless, you know, inspiration about how to push forward in some different way.
00:44:20.229 - 00:45:01.351, Speaker B: Yeah. And, and so, you know, I think, I think that's part of just living, living a full life while also building something great. And I think we have bad examples, like we know that, that Steve Jobs didn't really have a family life that he nurtured and he didn't. But later in his life, I remember, I remember hearing about the antenna gate on the iPhone 4. You remember that? Where if you held the same way, yes, the reception would totally cut out. And that was a really big product release for them that was like, as iPhone was hockey sticking. But there was also credible competition from Samsung and others and they had this just glaring design flaw.
00:45:01.351 - 00:45:48.077, Speaker B: And he did a war room with, you know, with the whole exec team at Apple and they ended up coming up with the bumper idea. So they gave everybody a free, you know, bumper case that went around the edges and it also insulated from your hand so it didn't disrupt the antenna. But in that design, you know, meeting in that war room, he, I think his son Julian was like 12 years old at the time. And he brought him into the room and like had him watch and he's like, I want you to see how this, how this happens. I think for me, I also, you know, at some point I met Steph Curry and I was like, what do you. I asked him the same question. It's like, dude, how do you keep, you know, pushing for these championships? Like, where is it coming from? And I think this was two years ago.
00:45:48.077 - 00:46:14.955, Speaker B: And his answer was like, at this point, I'm focused mostly on the next generation. You know, I'm focused on the younger guys. Like, I'm showing them how it's done. I'm thinking about the legacy of the team and, you know, leading by example. So I think you always got to find that chip and sometimes it can come from more positive places. Not. Not just about proving yourself, but it's about, you know, showing by example and thinking about the next generation.
00:46:15.575 - 00:46:22.015, Speaker A: Amazing. We're going to leave it at that. Founders that are listening. Yeah. Take note. There's a. There's a lot of lessons to be learned here.
00:46:22.095 - 00:46:23.431, Speaker B: I would love to come back. This has been awesome.
00:46:23.463 - 00:46:25.087, Speaker A: Yeah. This is great. Raj, we'll do this again.
00:46:25.151 - 00:46:25.535, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:46:25.615 - 00:46:26.223, Speaker A: Thank you so much.
00:46:26.279 - 00:46:27.047, Speaker B: Thank you.
