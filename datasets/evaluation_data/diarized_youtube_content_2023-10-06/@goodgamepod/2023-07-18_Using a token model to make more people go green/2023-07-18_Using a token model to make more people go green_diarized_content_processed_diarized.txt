00:00:00.200 - 00:00:25.282, Speaker A: I just did an estimate to figure out how much solar panels would cost at my house. It's like $35,000. And the payback is like 15 years, right? 1515 years. Ten to 15 years, depending on how many panels I can squeeze onto my roof. And that's only going to offset 60% of my consumption. So I think there is an element of using a token model as a way to pay for some of the cost of the solar panels. Keeps people more green.
00:00:25.282 - 00:00:36.514, Speaker A: And then maybe in the long run, you could even buy carbon offsets. Right. Part of the emissions, you can repurchase carbon offsets as a way to be more green. So there are some interesting experiments that we could run with this idea.
