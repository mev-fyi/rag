00:00:00.090 - 00:00:48.370, Speaker A: I think Uniswap v three, despite being called an AMm, is actually more like an order book because it provides professional market makers with the flexibility to do algorithms that they want to do, rather than using an algorithm that the protocol dictates. And this flexibility is very important for market makers. That's how they can get an edge over the rest of the market participants. If you give them a market making algorithm that they have to use, they have no edge against the rest of the market. And the result of that is with a very general purpose AMm. There is very little professional market making activity, and without those professional market makers, the spread will be high. But the UnisOp v three actually attracted a bunch of professional market makers because of the flexibility.
