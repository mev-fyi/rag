00:00:00.170 - 00:00:41.060, Speaker A: Why do retail in the trapfire world trade options? I think it's just because there's no futures or perpetual swaps on stocks. So options are the only instruments for them, for the retail traders to get leverage and to make a shit ton of money off of a very small amount of investment. But in crypto, the opposite is happening. There is futures, there is perpetual swaps, where retail traders can get a ton of leverage and make a ton of money with little investment. So in crypto, the biggest competitors to options, I think, is actually perpetual swaps. I think both solve the same problem, which is leverage. I think that's why demand for options may not be there yet today.
