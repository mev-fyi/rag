00:00:00.120 - 00:00:29.330, Speaker A: We have a couple founders who build different types of product, amms or NFT marketplaces or whatever, and they basically try to copy an existing product with real product market fit, but with a token. And I just tell them, don't do that. You're never going to know if you have real product market fit if you just do that. And most likely they're not, you're not going to have real product market fit because the product itself is not ten x better. Without the token, the token at some point will run out of fuel and your product is going to be dead.
00:00:29.362 - 00:00:40.154, Speaker B: So I'll name out two protocols that did this really well. Dydx and Arbitrum. I mean, Arbitrum's TVL is skyrocketing and they don't have a token yet, so that's like sticky liquidity in my opinion.
