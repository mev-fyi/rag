00:00:00.170 - 00:00:52.810, Speaker A: What do I think about DFI and the future? Well, I'd say 80% of the innovation DFI is done. We're going through incremental growth that can double down on security and capital efficiency. And we will start to see, at least to me, cannibalization of competitors. So what do I mean by that? Well, ave releasing its own decentralized stablecoin curve, releasing its own stablecoin ribbon, launching ribbon, earn or lend, start to compete in the lending space. We're going to start to see more or less protocols start to take on other sectors of DeFi. And I think this is going to, over time, turn into the DeFi bundling thesis, which is the fact that DeFi could become bundled because many of this products standalone will not work. But if you have a very strong liquidity sink, such as like AavE and compound and others, they can start to build out other products horizontally into other DeFi sectors.
