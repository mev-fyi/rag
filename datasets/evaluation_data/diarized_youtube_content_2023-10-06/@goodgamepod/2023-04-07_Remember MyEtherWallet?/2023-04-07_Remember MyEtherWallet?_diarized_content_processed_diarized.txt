00:00:00.200 - 00:00:27.334, Speaker A: I did see Mount Gox, but I didn't want to, like, wire money to Japan, so I ended up using Coinbase because there was a time where they overlapped. Coinbase worked great for a very long time. Then Metamask came out. Oh, so it was Coinbase then. I remember Ethereum launched. And myether wallet was another way for people to manage your own private keys. Essentially, they would automatically generate a public key and a private key, and you would have to write down that public and private key.
00:00:27.334 - 00:00:47.854, Speaker A: There would be this, like, printout that you would be be forced to print out, and then you would have to keep that in a very safe place. And so I had, like, pages of printouts of all my wallets in a folder that would be like, saved somewhere. And then whenever I need to open one of those wallets, I would use a private key, log in and see my assets.
