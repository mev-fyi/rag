00:00:00.250 - 00:00:50.140, Speaker A: Ultimately, what I think the key innovation with Solana phone is the secure enclave that supports private key management. And so the beauty behind this is that for the average user, you could log in once and ultimately you're signed in with every Dapp that's out there, right? So your private key is managed directly by your secure enclave which is on your phone. And ultimately you can interact like if you're interacting with your apps today on your iPhone, which is really cool. The second is getting your app on the App Store is actually a pain in the ass. Luckily we helped step in, or step in went through our program and they were able to figure out a way to do it through our programming and through some of the key experts that we brought in. But ultimately it's hard for every founder and so being able to get listed on the App Store and not having to pay like crazy fees, that's up to 30% is another important reason why I think Salona phone there.
