00:00:04.200 - 00:00:12.838, Speaker A: Welcome to Founder Stories. Today we have Joey on from Crate. Joey, can you talk a bit about who you are and what you're building?
00:00:12.966 - 00:00:27.922, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm Joey building Crate, which is the song crowdfunding platform, a place where artists can launch their songs on chain with a token as a means to bootstrap funding, and their community can show their patronage with a token that shows they were there first.
00:00:28.078 - 00:00:35.250, Speaker A: Nice. How does crates tokenization music differ from previous NFT music narratives that fell flat?
00:00:35.402 - 00:01:02.430, Speaker B: I think music NFTs were on the right track. They had the right idea. I think they didn't work because they have no liquidity and no secondary market. So, you know, you buy NFT for 1000, $2,000 and you know you're never going to sell it. So I think it's just inaccessible to most people. I think they were trying too hard to be skew morphic to physical collectibles when we need something new. So I read a Santiago tweet like right before this.
00:01:02.430 - 00:01:16.254, Speaker B: It says tokens are more accessible and fun versions of NFTs. And I think it's exceptionally true for music. There's no sticker shock, no unit bias, and most importantly, you can buy and sell instantly, like locking in your gains or losses.
00:01:16.374 - 00:01:20.324, Speaker A: What does Crate offer artists and fans that current streaming services don't?
00:01:20.414 - 00:02:01.908, Speaker B: Current streaming platforms are like gatekeepers between fans and artists. They control the economics. You pay your $15 a month, and most of that money goes to Taylor Swift and Drake, regardless of if you actually listen to them or not, because they pay out in their pie chart system. So that means if there's like a new upcoming artist and you're their biggest fan and you listen to them every single day, they could be not even getting one cent a month out of the $15 you pay, even if they're the only artists you listen to. So obviously it's completely broken. So with Crate, we're bringing the relationship between fan artists closer than before. You can directly choose how much money you want to put, whether you want to listen for free and just not spend any money.
00:02:01.908 - 00:02:09.452, Speaker B: You can do that or you can put thousands of dollars into your favorite artist songs. There's basically no middleman controlling that relationship.
00:02:09.548 - 00:02:11.236, Speaker A: Great. Joy, thank you so much for your time.
00:02:11.340 - 00:02:11.644, Speaker B: Of course.
