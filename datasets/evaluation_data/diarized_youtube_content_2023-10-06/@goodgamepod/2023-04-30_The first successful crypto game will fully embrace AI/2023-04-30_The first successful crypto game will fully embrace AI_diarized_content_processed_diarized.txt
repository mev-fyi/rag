00:00:00.160 - 00:00:59.564, Speaker A: People keep complaining about how crypto is not the best rail to build consumer apps because consumers would have to install a wallet click on signing a message upon every action and they may have to repeatedly re sign the transaction if it fails because transactions fail all the time and so on and so forth. Like all these things create a huge pain point for consumers. But I came to this insight which is that there is one group of users for which crypto actually offers better user experience than web two and that group of users is bots. So bots don't have to go through all this pain that users are going through and at the same time the bots don't need to worry about getting deplatformed by the web two, you know, the centralized social networks or financial services or games because crypto is fundamentally permissionless. So I think that it's very likely that the first decentralized social network or game that will become extremely successful that will gain mass adoption will be one that fully embraces AI.
