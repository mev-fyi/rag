00:00:00.170 - 00:00:34.818, Speaker A: Do you see anything meaningful that's being built on Filecoin right now? Yeah. So I think the characterization of it as a science project has elements of truth to it. I don't think it's outright false claim. I don't think it's correct either. We invested in Filecoin about a year ago because we started getting excited about the launch of the SVM, which launched in March of this year. In the one year since we've invested, I can say a few things have meaningfully improved, and then there's a handful of things that have not yet meaningfully improved. The things that have meaningfully improved are one the FDM launched and the first thing that has really started to grow on the FDM are Filecoin native capital markets.
00:00:34.818 - 00:00:58.380, Speaker A: For those who aren't familiar with how Filecoin works, if you are a storage provider on Filecoin, you have to have some fill that you can pledge as collateral before you can store any files to earn more fill. And so there's a bunch of teams that are working on Filecoin native borrow lend markets where you can actually use as collateral for a loan. Your future failed mining rewards and the smart contract will enforce the loan repayment from those, which is a very cool idea.
