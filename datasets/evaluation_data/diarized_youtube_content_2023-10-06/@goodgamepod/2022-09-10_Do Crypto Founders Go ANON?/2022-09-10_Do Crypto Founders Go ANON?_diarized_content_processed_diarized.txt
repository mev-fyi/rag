00:00:00.160 - 00:00:11.918, Speaker A: And so the question then becomes, if you're a founder in space and you want to build decentralized software and you're worried about the regulatory overhang that's happening from tornado cash, what do you do?
00:00:12.046 - 00:00:18.654, Speaker B: It's a very tough question. I mean, for starters, anons will have a much harder time to get funded.
00:00:18.774 - 00:00:19.434, Speaker A: Right.
00:00:19.734 - 00:00:23.934, Speaker B: Like VC's funding anon projects is a bull market thing.
00:00:24.014 - 00:00:24.582, Speaker UNK: Yep.
00:00:24.718 - 00:00:43.394, Speaker B: It's a symptom of low level of due diligence. So what do you do? If you decentralize too quickly, you're not going to be able to move fast enough initially and build a product that people actually want. Like building a product is not easy. Like, decision by committee is simply not going to work. You can't decentralize too quickly, too fast. It's a very tough question.
