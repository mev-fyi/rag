00:00:00.200 - 00:00:22.182, Speaker A: What does FTX blockfi collapse mean for crypto? So many regular people won't trust crypto anymore. That's right. What's gonna happen in the next two years is obviously average users are not gonna trust crypto regulators. Policymakers are not gonna trust crypto. They're gonna try to deploy aggressive regulations. I'm not even speculating. Like, this is something that happens over and over again in history.
00:00:22.182 - 00:00:44.624, Speaker A: Every time shit like that happens, you get more aggressive regulations. It's just history. It's not even my speculation. And developers, builders that, you know, last year there were a lot of web two builders that that joined web3, and we're not going to see that. We're going to see much less of that in the coming years. So the combination of these three things means that the industry is probably being set back, has been set back for at least a year or two.
