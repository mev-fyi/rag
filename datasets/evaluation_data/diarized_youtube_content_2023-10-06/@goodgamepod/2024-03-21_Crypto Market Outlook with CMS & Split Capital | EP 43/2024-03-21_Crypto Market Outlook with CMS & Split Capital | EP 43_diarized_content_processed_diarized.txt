00:00:00.400 - 00:00:04.085, Speaker A: Welcome to GoodGame. Your no BS insights for crypto founders.
00:00:07.305 - 00:00:11.097, Speaker B: Where are we in the cycle? Are we still in a four year cycle? Are we in a super cycle?
00:00:11.161 - 00:00:14.401, Speaker C: Are we always in the first inning left?
00:00:14.593 - 00:00:19.857, Speaker B: We're always. Are we in the left translator cycle? Where are we?
00:00:20.001 - 00:00:22.217, Speaker C: I'd say we're about halfway through it if I had to guess.
00:00:22.321 - 00:00:22.945, Speaker D: Say it again.
00:00:23.025 - 00:00:24.249, Speaker B: We're halfway through it.
00:00:24.417 - 00:00:25.169, Speaker A: Halfway through.
00:00:25.257 - 00:00:26.225, Speaker C: Yeah. Halfway through.
00:00:26.345 - 00:00:27.629, Speaker A: I didn't want to hear that.
00:00:27.817 - 00:00:35.125, Speaker C: No. But maybe it's a super cycle. Maybe the ETFs just permanently keep us out. I mean, we haven't even had the halving yet.
00:00:35.285 - 00:00:42.765, Speaker E: Yeah. It's also like, what does it even mean to be a four year cycle anymore? Do I think, like, we'll have rampant fraud like we did last time? Most definitely not.
00:00:42.845 - 00:00:44.965, Speaker A: Looking for your next startup idea in crypto?
00:00:45.085 - 00:00:46.701, Speaker B: Check out our request for startups list.
00:00:46.733 - 00:01:11.665, Speaker A: And get inspired at Alliance XYZ Ideas. All right. Welcome to Good Game. Today we have Zaheer from Split Capital and Dan from cms. And today we're going to talk macro. Where the market is today. How should founders be thinking about raising their round if they haven't raised their round yet? Thinking more about where the Ethereum ETF is.
00:01:11.665 - 00:01:20.205, Speaker A: We just had the CPI update. Trump or Biden. We can talk about. Talk a bit about politics and whether or not we're going to choose rich today.
00:01:21.055 - 00:01:24.671, Speaker C: Is that the official saying? And we just like, it seems done now.
00:01:24.783 - 00:01:26.631, Speaker A: Is it already over? It's true.
00:01:26.703 - 00:01:33.195, Speaker C: No, it's like done that's decided to be like the year.
00:01:33.695 - 00:01:36.247, Speaker A: It's going to be the. We're going to make it, not going to make it.
00:01:36.391 - 00:01:40.719, Speaker B: It's the new half on stain pour of the Right.
00:01:40.767 - 00:01:41.475, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:01:42.855 - 00:01:46.365, Speaker E: We need the CMS username not to reflect it. Right. We need.
00:01:46.495 - 00:01:54.281, Speaker C: I can't change it anymore. I had to. The stupid Twitter blue thing, it's like a pain.
00:01:54.433 - 00:01:55.073, Speaker A: Oh, that sucks.
00:01:55.129 - 00:02:07.113, Speaker C: For those of you I know, they buried me because I didn't have it, like it like actually became unused. Like, not that it really matters, but like, you were just like yelling into the void if you didn't have the like little blue ticker.
00:02:07.169 - 00:02:07.641, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:02:07.753 - 00:02:09.785, Speaker C: And then they got those trends.
00:02:09.905 - 00:02:10.665, Speaker A: I enjoyed it.
00:02:10.745 - 00:02:15.473, Speaker C: I know you need to lobby and write Elon and I'm sure he'll read it.
00:02:15.489 - 00:02:19.645, Speaker A: Gave me some idea where we are in the market. I mean that was like my indicators.
00:02:21.065 - 00:02:25.353, Speaker C: I was crowdsourcing him at the end. People were just giving to me. It got very easy.
00:02:25.489 - 00:02:42.937, Speaker E: I got one in there. It was Boston Dynamics when the robot dogs were gone with cms, Boston Dynamics, that was my one user submission and I actually got, I got the blue chips, I got the CMS logo in blue. That was also me, thankfully. Just, just a little bit of credit. I'll take.
00:02:43.121 - 00:02:46.721, Speaker C: No, I. Guys, listen, I wish I could continue to change it.
00:02:46.833 - 00:02:49.537, Speaker A: What about the picture, like the pfp?
00:02:49.681 - 00:02:50.561, Speaker E: You can't change it.
00:02:50.593 - 00:02:50.801, Speaker C: They'll.
00:02:50.833 - 00:02:52.925, Speaker E: They'll nuke your. Yeah.
00:02:54.705 - 00:03:04.785, Speaker C: They lock you in. You can't. It's just, you can do this stuff. It's just a bitch. Like they just like make it take time and. Yeah, like I could change it. It'd just be like it's too much of a hurdle.
00:03:04.865 - 00:03:05.105, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:03:05.145 - 00:03:08.233, Speaker A: Almost want to get paid for it at that point. Like it's just too much time.
00:03:08.289 - 00:03:10.825, Speaker E: Correct. You do get paid. Yeah.
00:03:10.865 - 00:03:11.665, Speaker A: Oh, true, true, true.
00:03:11.705 - 00:03:12.525, Speaker E: The narrative.
00:03:13.225 - 00:03:14.001, Speaker C: 20 bucks?
00:03:14.113 - 00:03:16.889, Speaker B: Yeah, I got $600 last month.
00:03:17.017 - 00:03:18.005, Speaker C: That's a big.
00:03:19.025 - 00:03:22.845, Speaker E: Dude, that's huge. Holy crap. Wow, you're eating good, huh?
00:03:24.505 - 00:03:26.045, Speaker A: Did you YOLO into it?
00:03:30.145 - 00:03:42.163, Speaker B: Let's get, let's get straight to it. What's your guys macro view? Where we are in the cycle? What about the ETF flow? Anything else you track?
00:03:42.259 - 00:04:13.109, Speaker C: I don't think much of the traditional macro stuff. I would be honest. I'm bearish. People that trade, crypto, getting involved in that stuff in aggregate. But even more so right now, I think it's pretty irrelevant. I think it really is just about these ETF flows until they slow or stop. But as long as they're consistently putting in, I don't know, 300 to 500 million sort of a day, I think it's a pretty easy trade where you just sort of run with that.
00:04:13.109 - 00:04:28.439, Speaker C: I really don't think you care about anything else that's going on in the world. Obviously absent a real exogenous shock. But little sort of macro changes are kind of irrelevant in the grand scheme of things. When you've got the flows being as big as they are still now they may slow.
00:04:28.487 - 00:04:28.671, Speaker E: Right.
00:04:28.703 - 00:04:37.135, Speaker C: Like they're not gonna, I mean maybe they'll be like this for a really long time, but like it's, it's, it's not like a guarantee, but while it continues, just like ride that wave.
00:04:37.255 - 00:04:57.813, Speaker A: When do you think? I mean, I, obviously it's very hard to figure out when it'll slow down, but like if you're, if you're a traditional fund manager looking into this, you would obviously comp it to gold. So would you comp it against gold? And what like from a market cap perspective how would you think about where investors will say like, all right, this is enough.
00:04:57.989 - 00:06:06.145, Speaker E: I think it's kind of irrelevant, right? Because I think what Bitcoin represents to people at this point is just like everyone's accepted that it is just like the excess valve of monetary policy, right? It could be worth infinite and it doesn't have to mean anything, right? But I think the problem becomes for a lot of people, like how allocated you are overall to it and if you are or aren't, it's like a binary bet, right? Like am I in crypto, am I not in crypto? And if not, and this thing is running away from me, why am I not in it, right? And I think that's more of the question that's being asked than, you know, what is a reasonable price target for bitcoin, right? Because objectively speaking, like there's no reason why it's trading at 70k versus 100k plus or you know, and that's also the interesting thing about like price discovery, like what's the fair value? Who knows, right? And where does it head to from here? Bitcoin is the pinnacle momentum asset, right? So we could be trading much higher. And I think Dan and I probably agree that we probably will be trading much higher within reason. But how, how and why does someone get there is I think whatever kind of moon map they want to come up with themselves.
00:06:06.485 - 00:06:23.997, Speaker C: I think there's been some like outflows from like the gold products that people have attributed to inflows into the bitcoin. I just don't think like people penetrate it that much or like even really think about it a ton. Like maybe if we start to approach it in a larger percentage, it'll start to become a narrative. But in the short term, I don't think it's like a ton of what.
00:06:24.021 - 00:06:43.959, Speaker B: People are thinking, guys maybe taking a step back. So every trader, every investor has different time horizons. For me, for example, I have maybe two strategies. I have a cycle long time horizon and I have short term time horizon, like one to two months kind of thing. For you guys, what is your primary focus? At what time horizon do you feel you have an edge?
00:06:44.037 - 00:07:10.147, Speaker C: That's a good question. I, I don't know, like one to three sort of month time horizon, if that makes sense. I'm not trading super short dated stuff, but I think we try to see where flows are moving and then what the corollary, like if you push one part of the system, like what will react next? I mean a lot of it is like a Lag, lead relationship between stuff. And I think that time kind of plays out on a weekly and then maybe like a monthly sort of level.
00:07:10.291 - 00:07:30.267, Speaker E: Yeah. Generally what we do is we take like a year long approach and then we will condense it back to like six months, three months, one month, one week. And we'll liquidity adjust each one of those different time horizons so we'll make one big, you know, bold claim for the year. Right. It's like eth. Eth is bullish, let's just say. Or like last year was bitcoin.
00:07:30.291 - 00:07:30.635, Speaker C: Etf.
00:07:30.675 - 00:07:41.689, Speaker E: Bitcoin is bullish kind of idea. Very simple, very easy to kind of wrap around. And very easy to falsify too. Right. If that narrative doesn't hit, then like you can actually reduce your positioning. But everything else in between. Right.
00:07:41.689 - 00:08:14.625, Speaker E: Like, you know, nobody can tell you what is the next narrative. I think that's like the biggest trap, but it's more like, okay, there's money moving in this direction and this direction seems like it has legs. And then we can reason out like there's generally some good momentum moving in that direction. So that's how we think about it more broadly. And then also like, you know, final point being that once you can kind of think about like the next a couple of months, then you will have those periods where markets will move like countercyclically, and then things change very drastically. That's why we have high pensions for liquidity too.
00:08:14.745 - 00:08:54.301, Speaker B: Okay, So I agree with you guys that probably the most important metric to track right now is the ETF flow, and that almost outweighs anything else at this moment. But I would assume that there might be some things that would lead the ETF flow itself. Right. So the ETF flow is a reflection of other pieces of information potentially. So one thing I can think of is I feel like Nvidia, this one stock is actually pulling the entire market up, the entire stock market upwards, and the stock market bleeds into crypto a little bit. Do you feel the same? Do you feel there's any other leading indicators that might be interesting?
00:08:54.413 - 00:09:25.585, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, like risk assets in general are going to trade like sort of in the same direction. I think like the biggest issue you have with the ETF that you like, can't sort of like pull like those sort of heuristics sticks out with yet is that like the access is a little like it's stepwise. Right. Like, and we don't really. I'd say everybody in this conversation has no fucking idea. And like, in general sort of the like crypto spot market participants like that we're going to talk to like don't have any ideas. Like the access and sort of the decision allocation of putting into the ETF for like larger pools of capital is like completely out of our purview.
00:09:25.585 - 00:10:13.183, Speaker C: Like some of this stuff is like people can't even like access the like product yet and it's like opening up and it's stepwise and like certain like advisors get access to it and then like their client base can touch it or certain like approvals and risk committees need to go through certain like larger like allocators that like may. So they take. So like that whole decision making process is absent to us. And I think that is going to drive a lot of the fun flow for the first year of this thing. And that's more important than like what is the S and P sort of done over like sort of the year. So I think like that's the problem is like yes, if we're in a steady state where like anybody who wants to trade this thing is able to trade this thing and get a piece of it and whatever sort of exogenous or shocks you're seeing in the equity market move demand for that. The thing is, the demand is being driven by access still I think for a while.
00:10:13.183 - 00:10:18.399, Speaker C: And I think the problem is we're really just not going to really be able to get a good view into that from our world.
00:10:18.527 - 00:10:39.679, Speaker E: Yeah, I think that's the most important point. Right. These flows are so sporadic we can't even like. I can't tell you what the flow will be tomorrow. The only thing is I can see it on the tape generally. And then from there then we can kind of, you know, do some reverse engineering on the math. But altogether like, you know, can it trade another 500 million daily for the next 30 days easily.
00:10:39.679 - 00:10:49.327, Speaker E: Can it also not like we. I have no more certainty in one outcome than another necessarily, which is makes it way more difficult to trade. And I'm sure Dan can probably agree to that.
00:10:49.431 - 00:10:53.729, Speaker C: Yeah, I think we're really outgunned here. I think it's just like a world we don't play in.
00:10:53.857 - 00:11:07.049, Speaker B: Zahir, earlier you said that you're bullish on ETH this year and probably due to the ETH etf. What is your probability estimate for the ETF approval in May?
00:11:07.177 - 00:11:26.969, Speaker E: Guys, I'm as ETH lines as they come, but I don't know. I can't tell you. Right. Like whatever my probability is worth has the volatility of swinging 70% in either direction overnight. Right. So I'm optimistic that the ETF will pass in the next year or so. Whether that's in May or not, I don't know.
00:11:26.969 - 00:11:29.705, Speaker E: But I would probably see pretty good odds that that's the case.
00:11:29.865 - 00:11:35.305, Speaker B: Have you heard any informed takes from other people, let's say the Bloomer ETF guys?
00:11:35.465 - 00:12:05.457, Speaker E: No, I mean, honestly, like, and I don't mean to call these guys out because they've done good work in other areas, but they just don't seem to understand what the point of Ethereum is broadly. And they kind of seem pretty backed up on. On Bitcoin as a whole. I'm like, no. I mean, I tweeted this last night too. I was like, there's been no cogent argument. Like, is it Nate Grassy from ETF Store? He's been probably the only tradfi guy who's kind of like, nobody's giving me a good reason why ETH won't pass outside of just like the administration hates it.
00:12:05.457 - 00:12:16.359, Speaker E: Which isn't a real narrative. Right. That's not a real. Like, you can't, you can't just hate something and then like, oh, I'm not going to approve it. Like, you'll get sued. And they have gotten sued and like, do they want to run it again? I don't know.
00:12:16.487 - 00:12:19.395, Speaker A: All the legal experts at least are very bearish.
00:12:19.695 - 00:12:20.875, Speaker B: Trevinsky.
00:12:22.295 - 00:12:32.887, Speaker C: Yeah, he's bearish everything though. He comes out like the world. I mean, I love him and I like him a lot. He's like a good guy. He just like, he skews so hard. Negative.
00:12:33.031 - 00:12:33.795, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:12:34.335 - 00:12:37.795, Speaker B: Isn't that a common thing among lawyers? Like a lawyer? Yeah, Lawyers.
00:12:38.495 - 00:12:52.709, Speaker C: I think in general you're dealing with like the not greatest display of people. So you just like you. If you end up in a court. Right. Like something has gone wrong and like somebody's. So I think they just have this very skewed outlook of. I don't know, that's my take.
00:12:52.709 - 00:12:56.213, Speaker C: Or at least like people that are way deep in it.
00:12:56.389 - 00:13:13.791, Speaker E: So usually like your first job in whatever sector you're in will shape your outlook. And Jake, I believe, joined in like 2017, 2018 in crypto, like pretty much full time defi on top of that. Right. Like crypto policy. Right. Like when it was like hyper demonized. Right.
00:13:13.791 - 00:13:31.423, Speaker E: So he's probably just like, oh, like, you know, in the same way that like I just view everyone as the antagonistic crypto. Like, but that's very much a byproduct of like the environment that I kind of like got my, you know, standing in crypto. So I would imagine there's some amount of bias there. By the way, Jake Jabrinsky is a great guy. He's a great guy.
00:13:31.519 - 00:13:55.581, Speaker C: Yeah, he's very nice. I don't know if the same question applies, but I'd put it at a coin flip which is maybe a little bit better than like the. I think one of the implied odds seem like 30% by like the random sort of prediction markets. Yeah, I gotta put stock in it. The Bloomberg ETF guys like they have like a very high weighting in my mind on this stuff. Like they've been pretty on it for everything. But there's a couple of smart people that are making arguments on the other side.
00:13:55.581 - 00:14:12.681, Speaker C: I got nothing. So I'm just going with a coin. But I do think we'll have it before year end. I just don't know if we'll have it. May like the timing's a little like I. I'd be very shocked if we're here this time next year talking and there's not, there's not a lot of reason I think to hold it up that long. But may.
00:14:12.681 - 00:14:16.305, Speaker C: I don't know may short. I could see it getting kicked. I don't know. So I'm not.
00:14:16.345 - 00:14:17.857, Speaker E: Yeah, I probably agree with that.
00:14:18.001 - 00:14:21.577, Speaker C: Trading it if that makes sense. Like I don't think there's a ton.
00:14:21.601 - 00:14:24.097, Speaker E: Of that naturally aligned with eth.
00:14:24.161 - 00:14:49.219, Speaker C: So I look, I think, I think we need more. You put an ETF wrapper on everything if you can get it through. I will say I don't think we're going to see ETF products anything else further down the curve for a long time. I think that flow is going to pretty much be. Get a CME future, get that trading for a bit then roll in. Like there's people who keep talking about oh we're going to have this ETF like anything further out. I do not see a world they're putting that through anytime.
00:14:49.219 - 00:14:51.455, Speaker C: Even if ETF gets approved like for.
00:14:52.155 - 00:14:58.853, Speaker B: One of the Bloomberg ETF guys said the tradfi world doesn't care about eth something to that effect. Do you agree?
00:14:58.909 - 00:15:33.275, Speaker C: I think that's probably doesn't care versus has less demand than bitcoin. It definitely has less demand than bitcoin. I mean it's like a smaller asset. I think that they're probably not getting ton of inbound interest from the people they're speaking to and I think that probably does meet the demand. I think the bigger problem is though they're missing Retail interest in it, and there's also interest in it once it exists, right? Like, if you've got bitcoin there, those people who are taking decisions in it are like, at least naturally going to look at eth. So I don't know, I think it's a little skeptical to be like, oh, they're only interested in bitcoin. They won't take a look at.
00:15:33.275 - 00:15:49.647, Speaker C: This whole gateway drug concept with crypto is always been a thing. I don't know. I think people, if you put it out there, it'll get inflows and it'll trade. I think there's more demand for it than just because people aren't coming up to you being like, I really want to get to meet. I don't know what would be the.
00:15:49.671 - 00:15:51.533, Speaker A: Narrative that will get them going on ethnicity.
00:15:51.619 - 00:15:57.673, Speaker E: I think staking honestly is like a pretty lucrative one, right? Like, imagine getting dividends on eth, right? What?
00:15:57.689 - 00:16:00.505, Speaker A: The earn it bond was what I heard.
00:16:00.665 - 00:16:17.107, Speaker E: I mean, it's easy, right? Yeah, it's super attractive. Well, also, like, this is also part of the reason why ETH doesn't hold up well as an index asset because it's so usable, right? Like, you can collect yield. You can do a lot of things with ETH that you theoretically can't do with BTC today.
00:16:17.241 - 00:16:19.647, Speaker A: So changing, though, that narrative is changing.
00:16:19.711 - 00:16:45.315, Speaker E: It is changing for sure. For sure, it's changing. But I'm just saying, like, like, generally speaking, like, you see, like, the largest holders of ETH have been the same holders, and they'll go park it from like, you know, like, we'll put it in lido. And now it's an Eigen and, you know, whatever else, right? Like Mantle or Morpheus or whatever, you know, other kind of staking platform they. They so choose. But I think the yield narrative is pretty attractive for. For eth, right? Because it's deflationary and you get yield, like, pretty sick.
00:16:45.435 - 00:17:04.659, Speaker C: I think it's just easy enough to be like, it's a diversity thing. You buy a little bit of this, I don't know, you size it, you buy 80, 20 bitcoin eth. I don't know. We would see this historically, back in the day, like, circle, like, guys would come in, they'd buy like a slug of bitcoin. They buy a little bit of eth and then they'd like, spray out. It was almost never like, I just want to buy one. I take a little bit of a basket approach.
00:17:04.827 - 00:17:05.987, Speaker E: Diversification.
00:17:06.131 - 00:17:34.981, Speaker A: I don't know if you saw Jim Bianco's tweet from Bianco Research. I want to throw this out there just to get your thoughts. He talked about, you know, how I think he said this at the bottom, by the way. This was around like 60k or whatever. And he said that, you know, because it settles in cash, we could have a polarized effect of up only and then down only. Or like we'll have a liquidation CAS a cascade of liquidations. Because ultimately when you're selling back in via etf, it'll settle in cash.
00:17:34.981 - 00:17:42.863, Speaker A: It'll automatically impact the market. What are your thoughts on that thesis or theory that Jim Bianco put out there? I don't understand.
00:17:42.919 - 00:17:47.575, Speaker C: So he's saying, but wait, I mean, like, if you're selling, it's going down. I get that. But like his thought process.
00:17:47.615 - 00:17:49.199, Speaker E: Yeah. That's all he's saying.
00:17:49.327 - 00:17:49.639, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:17:49.687 - 00:17:53.599, Speaker C: Is he saying it's worse because it's a cash create redeem mechanism?
00:17:53.647 - 00:17:55.039, Speaker A: Yes, yes.
00:17:55.207 - 00:18:22.913, Speaker C: I don't think that really matters too much. I mean, I think what matters more is if the people that have purchased the ETF, I don't know what has been like 10 billion of flows, right. Like, if those people are more or less sort of likely to dispose of the position if it starts moving against them. I would actually say it's like a group of people that probably less. Like, I think that money is a lot stickier than you sort of see with the traditional pools of capital that were purchasing crypto. Crypto still is like very retail heavy. Right.
00:18:22.913 - 00:18:41.007, Speaker C: So that tends to be a very shaky user base. I think the ETF probably skews less, though. I haven't seen a good breakdown of that flow at all. I don't even know if you can get a good breakdown of it. Like, if it's all just like people buying in their brokerage account instead of like going on coinbase. Like it's just the same group of people anyway and it won't matter. But I don't know.
00:18:41.007 - 00:18:47.823, Speaker C: I don't think the cash create redemption mechanism, like, will add volatility on the way down. I'm not a buyer of that.
00:18:47.959 - 00:19:04.387, Speaker E: Yeah. It's just naturally bearish. Right. If people start redeeming, which is something he did say. Right. Like, you know, because it goes up so, so hot, then it might come off so hot. But I generally think, like, the average buyer of the ETF is not, like Dan said, some random retail buyer who's pumped in ETFs.
00:19:04.387 - 00:19:39.903, Speaker E: Number one. You can't even get options on the number two. It's like, why would you wait all this time to just start suddenly pounding in? You could have just done it on Coinbase all these years. So I think the only rational narrative is probably like people underestimate drastically how large the RIA market in the US is and how many people are just considered high net worth individuals. And how many of these people can just like, you know, the aggregate like number of dollars that exists in the US just from like private wealth is an insane amount of money. And we're not even like close to having like any material flow into crypto from. From these people.
00:19:39.903 - 00:19:42.735, Speaker E: And it's already had such a drastic, you know, price impact. Right.
00:19:42.855 - 00:19:48.903, Speaker B: What are you guys trading these days? Meme coins. Basis trading. Anything else?
00:19:49.079 - 00:20:03.575, Speaker C: AI Coins should have been trading Meme coins. It's been all the action. We trade a lot of the L1s. That's kind of still been our dominant. It's liquid, it's big. You can. That's kind of been our bread and butter.
00:20:03.575 - 00:20:30.733, Speaker C: We do do a fair bit of the basis. The basis has been hard just because the cash flow. Well, and I take it like the ETF flows are so big that you tend to have this heuristic where and the curve gets really steep, right? Like that's like gravity, like comes like sort of back. The problem is if like the cash bid is so big and it just keeps like ripping it up like that's. You're. There's a lot of leverage in the system right now, but it's not as relevant because there's also a lot of like cash pushing through the system. Like it's.
00:20:30.733 - 00:20:58.905, Speaker C: It's hard to then like use sort of that natural like function. I mean, that being said, like, it's not going to last forever and the curve will like come meet it and you'll still get like that roll down. But you've had like better luck just like being allocated like long. So we're doing a lot of the rotation of the L1s. That has caught a pretty good bit the last week as Solana slowed its growth. But we've also just been looking a lot at the new stuff that's getting built on bitcoin. We've been taking a deep dive into that stuff.
00:20:58.905 - 00:21:03.949, Speaker C: There's a lot going on there fast and we're just trying to get up to speed to it. So that's where we've been playing around.
00:21:04.077 - 00:21:15.351, Speaker E: Yeah, very much the same. But I would say more of our focus has been on the hottest of narrative, right. Which is like AI has taken off like that's been a decent sized position for us.
00:21:15.503 - 00:21:20.039, Speaker A: What AI? Guess startups or companies or tokens you're looking at.
00:21:20.167 - 00:21:50.675, Speaker E: Oh, I get to show my bags. Oh, this is not investment advice. Not investment advice, no. Being more serious, you know, I think that the simpler the narrative, the easier it is for people to understand. I think the biggest mistake you can make in any of this stuff is just acting like you understand what the potential technological implications are. I'll be the first to say I don't and to understand that like this is equally in the same eyes of like L1 valuation. What's the value? Well, whatever the comp of the other value is.
00:21:50.675 - 00:22:09.113, Speaker E: Right. Like, you know, so that's how everything in crypto trades. It's how everything in the world trades. So render Tao, you know, these are obviously the two biggest names that people are really looking at. There's been a lot of like seed deals, pre seed deals, series A deals that are doing like AI, whatever billion dollar valuations.
00:22:09.169 - 00:22:10.017, Speaker A: It's insane, right?
00:22:10.081 - 00:22:25.305, Speaker E: It's insane. Yeah, we're back. That we're back. We're so back. I mean this is another problem we can talk about too. It's just like venture dollars in crypto, like this has been like the scourge of the space. Sorry Dan, that just like all of these dollars coming into like these deals.
00:22:25.305 - 00:22:57.161, Speaker E: Like you can you like I've coined this term like the crypto VC supernova writing research on this, but you're seeing like kind of this almost implosion of like how much money is going into into deals and how quickly. Right. Like you have like incremental dollars kind of coming into the space and then like 10x the VC demand all of a sudden, like it's crazy. But I think you know, overall like in the other things that we kind of take a, take a look at really just like ETH related products, I think I can will be very, very large blast too has been pretty interesting. We're seeing a lot of these tokens.
00:22:57.193 - 00:22:59.805, Speaker A: Kind of like are you farming either of those?
00:23:00.265 - 00:23:33.149, Speaker E: We haven't only taken a look at Igen, we've been spending time there and then, you know, on an Eigen related products like Mantle, you know, Morpheus, that kind of stuff. But I think Igen will be like one of the more sticky narratives for ETH and can create a pretty reflexive ETH bid too. That's also why we're pretty, you know, pretty much very interested in ETH in particular. But a lot of it really just comes down into like how much Exposure can you get in the market? Broadly. Right. Like, a lot of this stuff trades pretty cyclically anyway. Like AI came back after meme coins went down kind of thing.
00:23:33.149 - 00:23:54.721, Speaker E: Right. Like, so you can see all these, like market rotations happen within themselves, which don't make sense historically. Right. In the past, used to be index, you know, mid caps and then like garbage. Right. But now it's kind of like we will cycle through different bags of garbage before, you know, I don't know, eventually, like, imploding. But.
00:23:54.873 - 00:24:24.851, Speaker B: So I have a question on Render versus Tau. So my thesis is that AI coins are the meme coins of the cycle. But then the question is, I have in mind is, let's say a new retail comes to this market, how do they pick which AI coin to buy? Because there's actually a very meaningful differences between Tao and Render. Tao is. Has a much worse unibias than Render and it's not listed on a centralized exchange.
00:24:25.003 - 00:24:25.267, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:24:25.291 - 00:24:26.855, Speaker E: I mean, you just answered your own question.
00:24:27.475 - 00:24:33.715, Speaker C: Those are two. I mean, you can't access it. That's huge. And then the unit buys is very real.
00:24:33.835 - 00:24:45.097, Speaker E: Yeah. Also it's just like in the name. Right. I think that's like a very underappreciated aspect of this ultimately. I don't. Yeah, it's like Bittensor Tau. Like, I don't.
00:24:45.097 - 00:24:53.449, Speaker E: I don't understand AI from that. Right. Render AI. I feel like it's kind of hard to like, mess that up. Right. So. But they've both done like, tremendously well.
00:24:53.449 - 00:25:09.889, Speaker E: Right. So it's just more of a function of like, how much liquidity can you get on the asset. Right. Like, that's what I care about more. It's like, okay, you want to buy some AI index, whatever. Right. But ultimately, like, the only differentiating factor is just how much can I pair off against some other asset in the portfolio.
00:25:10.057 - 00:25:16.285, Speaker B: What about that coin that's listed on Binance with the ticker? AI Sleepless AI or something like that?
00:25:17.745 - 00:25:19.645, Speaker C: There's literally a great ticker.
00:25:20.545 - 00:25:26.609, Speaker A: They have no product. I mean, maybe they do have a product. Something with games or something. From what I read when I went on the website.
00:25:26.777 - 00:25:29.521, Speaker B: No, it's not Xai you were talking about Xai Imran.
00:25:29.553 - 00:25:30.665, Speaker A: No, Sleepless AI.
00:25:30.785 - 00:25:32.245, Speaker E: What is Sleepless AI?
00:25:33.065 - 00:25:34.245, Speaker A: That's the AI.
00:25:35.065 - 00:25:35.689, Speaker B: Right.
00:25:35.817 - 00:25:38.705, Speaker A: I mean, from the website, I feel like it was just.
00:25:38.825 - 00:25:40.041, Speaker B: Yeah, that's the one on Binance.
00:25:40.113 - 00:25:41.737, Speaker C: Sleepless is on Binance.
00:25:41.881 - 00:25:42.561, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:25:42.713 - 00:25:44.217, Speaker C: I don't know anything about this.
00:25:44.361 - 00:25:44.753, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:25:44.809 - 00:25:48.365, Speaker A: Which is the OG AI ticker. It's worth like 1.2 billion.
00:25:48.905 - 00:25:51.601, Speaker C: I guess that's what an AI ticker on Binance is worth.
00:25:51.753 - 00:25:58.525, Speaker E: Right. But the ironic part is because American retail can't access finance anymore, it might not be that bullish. Right.
00:25:59.465 - 00:26:00.503, Speaker C: Binance more.
00:26:00.609 - 00:26:11.739, Speaker B: You know what I found out recently? People say China bans bitcoin, or China bans crypto. In actuality, Chinese citizens can open an account on Binance and American citizens cannot.
00:26:11.867 - 00:26:14.603, Speaker E: Yeah, no part of that is surprising, I guess, I suppose.
00:26:14.739 - 00:26:15.299, Speaker A: Well, they never.
00:26:15.347 - 00:26:16.531, Speaker C: They never really banned it.
00:26:16.563 - 00:26:16.707, Speaker E: Right.
00:26:16.731 - 00:26:33.937, Speaker C: It was just like, certain people couldn't move cash in and out. Like, there was restrictions. But, like, you've always been able to hold it natively, right? Yeah. I don't know. I mean, they've been dealing with this since 2013. Yeah. Well, I mean, because Binance runs a giant P2P OTC market still.
00:26:33.937 - 00:26:37.889, Speaker C: @ least I think so. Not that I deal with it a ton, but, like, at least that's how people were getting in.
00:26:38.017 - 00:26:49.417, Speaker E: Yeah. Also, like, Binance is way deeper on. Sorry, China's way deeper on the bitcoin narrative. Overall, most of the BRC stuff that's been happening has been Chinese 100%.
00:26:49.521 - 00:27:13.737, Speaker C: I'd say they're a good six months ahead of anybody. Like, there was multiple assets that were, like, over a billion dollars, like, trading, like, big size in that sector that you. I swear to God, you would have taken 10 people in the west that were, like, actively trading crypto, and maybe, like, one of them had heard of either. It was, like, wild. This was, like, probably six months ago. So, yeah, like, Ordi was the big one. What was, like, the other track was.
00:27:13.761 - 00:27:18.913, Speaker A: Another one, I guess, like, stacked protocol.
00:27:18.969 - 00:27:37.661, Speaker C: That I heard of. But anyway. Yeah, but, like, there was. There was a whole just, like, movement over there, and we were just, like, complete. It is, like, a little wild to me, like, how different the west and the east are still not so much with, like, bitcoin, but, like, the further, like, tail assets. Like, there's, like, really two different worlds still going on, and we try to keep a good line with people that are over there. It's like.
00:27:37.661 - 00:27:44.013, Speaker C: It's hard, but it's, like, pretty beneficial to know, like, how they're thinking and they have no idea what we're, like, looking at half the time.
00:27:44.149 - 00:28:09.819, Speaker E: Yeah. It's ironic, right? Like, we. One of the core thesis we had around stacks internally was literally, we love stacks because nobody in the US really is paying attention to it. And it does well in that narrative. And because American VCs are so caught up in Solana versus Ethan more like modularity. Whatever nonsense you want to come up with. Right, whatever buzzword you want to insert.
00:28:09.819 - 00:28:27.221, Speaker E: But instead people really overlooked how much flow like these. Like I remember Ordi was doing like top five volume like for a few weeks straight like on Binance, which is just nuts. Like and like not one person I knew like held this thing other than like my friends at utxo. That's about it, right?
00:28:27.253 - 00:28:41.797, Speaker B: Like so, so speaking of bitcoin and modularity and all that stuff, Danny mentioned your, your biggest trade is on the layer one rotation. What, what are you excited about? What are you bullish on these days both from a short term and long term perspective.
00:28:41.941 - 00:29:20.489, Speaker C: God. I guess like so on the short term perspective I think you've got a lot of money that moved into bitcoin Ethan Solana over the last, I don't know, year, right. Let's call it, I think a lot of that money. If it does look to sort of just like, if it looks to diversify in any like capacity or if it looks like to like sort of move into any other bets. Like I think there's other L1s. I don't want to like name names because they just don't want to get in like about like sort of like picking sides I think. But like there's a bunch of the other L1 ones that are sort of of the same vintage that even if your argument is like they're not going to sort of hold the candle, they're going to be like a competitor, they're probably trading too cheap on a relative basis.
00:29:20.489 - 00:29:30.805, Speaker C: So I think there'll be like capital flow sort of into that as a pair trade. I would never like advocate going short like the majors sort of against those. But I do think that there'll be some more rotation of stuff into that.
00:29:31.785 - 00:29:33.561, Speaker E: Talking about Avax by the way.
00:29:33.673 - 00:29:35.085, Speaker B: Yeah, I know I'm not doing.
00:29:39.905 - 00:30:08.041, Speaker C: There'S a bunch, I say there's five that we've taken shots on. But there's also the whole L2 world for Bitcoin isn't a thing yet. But when it is, I do think there'll be the same sort of pair thing where people look to those as an allocation decision versus taking money out of their bitcoin. Ethan. So on positions that have done well, we're pretty excited. Monad we think that's going to be a big one as it comes down the pipe. That's a longer term one.
00:30:08.041 - 00:30:18.417, Speaker C: Kevin works there. He was like, it was our intern for a bit. So like it's got a Soft spot in my heart but really like sort of what they're doing over there. But that's. You can't action on that. So I can name it. I don't know.
00:30:18.417 - 00:30:44.547, Speaker C: That's like sort of how we think of stuff. Like our decisions are less technical and more just market flow than they to be like completely out. Like we're not really making strong technical like fundamental levels decisions on like where we think like pricing is going. Like we're not like this is better because of xyz whatever technical implementations. It's more just we think this is cheap on a relevant basis. We think flows will sort of go there to continue.
00:30:44.731 - 00:31:41.021, Speaker E: Yeah, generally we look at it pretty similarly. The only big thing that we kind of really differentiate on I guess is if we just like holding the index more like if we're just optimistic eth, anything that isn't ETH that we want to hold, like if we're bullish, ETH has to really outperform in our minds. Um, it has to be for a specific reason. So Solana was our like biggest kind of like conviction bet from like 10 bucks because it's just free money, you know. And then that obviously switches at a certain point when it's like okay, everyone's like way over allocated Solana now it's you know, kind of goes back to Ethan. Like that rotation alone like can make a fund and then you know, more so on the like L2s on ETH too. I think we're going to start seeing like a lot of those kind of taper off in value a bit because just how like expensive they are on a relative basis to like a lot of Altel ones like arbitrary being worth like 20 something billion is quite expensive.
00:31:41.093 - 00:31:44.909, Speaker C: So the L2S trade is so rich in my mind.
00:31:45.037 - 00:32:07.325, Speaker E: Yeah, they're insane. They're. They're just, it's absurd. Those are ones that like we, we're not as fond of anymore. But it'll change, right? It all ebbs and flows and like this is why we don't give like we don't call pod shots like you know, across the board. Like Avax has done tremendously well in the last like week or two on this like Maple story narrative. But you know, and you're seeing like a pretty, pretty fat bid on that.
00:32:07.325 - 00:32:32.105, Speaker E: But for newer technologies like you know, obviously like Monad has been like the biggest one that everyone's kind of talked about. But initiative as well, another modularity kind of narrative that I think will do quite well. Team is good. Obviously like I'M biased. I have an angel investor. But at the same time, like, generally it's these teams that I think will that have a differentiated product, but we'll be able to deliver. Also.
00:32:32.105 - 00:32:45.689, Speaker E: It just really is 100% driven by market value. Right. Like, what's to say this stuff should trade at 10, 20, $30 billion when it. When it goes live. Right. I never thought SEI would trade at 10 billion like it does. But, you know, congrats to the team for making it happen.
00:32:45.689 - 00:32:46.233, Speaker E: Right.
00:32:46.369 - 00:32:53.627, Speaker A: Is there organic activity happening on Avalanche? I haven't been really following it closely. I know there's a meme coin called.
00:32:53.801 - 00:32:55.075, Speaker C: They got a meme.
00:32:55.495 - 00:33:02.327, Speaker E: Say it, say it, say it. Cocky new.
00:33:02.511 - 00:33:03.383, Speaker A: Cocky new.
00:33:03.479 - 00:33:18.303, Speaker C: I am, like, definitely not just talking about Avax either. Like, there's. There's definitely multiple ones that are. I don't know why everybody's, like, inferring that, but I'm gonna. It depends. If it goes up, I'll take credit for it. No, I think there's, like, a handful that, like, matter.
00:33:18.303 - 00:33:26.141, Speaker C: The thing with the activity is like, the TV on the activity, like, a lot of times price drives it too. Yeah. Like, I think that's like, part of the problem.
00:33:26.293 - 00:34:01.259, Speaker E: Yeah, the fundamentals get better when the price goes up kind of thing. I mean, but it's really real, right? Like, people want to start using things when the price goes up or they have an incentive to go do things. Right? And this is like, I don't know, we probably can talk about the points thing, right? But, like, that's probably like the best abstraction of this concept, right? Where, like, people are like, how do we pre. Influence the pre TGE of the pre product? Pre whatever, right? Like, it's like the announcement of. Announcement, right? It's like Justin sun, like, cubed, you know, like, how do we. How do we financialize this market, right? So, I mean, we're seeing it. I mean, crypto.
00:34:01.259 - 00:34:07.155, Speaker E: Crypto is the best market in the world for creating levers of financial speculation. So I'm all. I'm here for it.
00:34:07.195 - 00:34:25.429, Speaker A: So when ethanol first launched, there was a lot of, like, criticism. What side of the coin are you? Are you for Athena? Obviously, like, I think they hit a billion dollars or something. Tbl. But I'm curious on would you have invested if they pitched you pros, cons, what are your thoughts? Maybe, Dan, with you first?
00:34:25.557 - 00:35:04.347, Speaker C: Yeah, I. I think, look, Athena, like, at its core is like, it's a trade that's, like, packaged up and, like, so which I, like, don't have a problem with. I think like my issue, if any with it is that people don't like realize that it has risk. I think like, that is my like concern with it is that like, I think sometimes it gets like confused to be like whatever they call it, like a dollar peg, like what it like it's close enough that like people sort of get to this like stablecoin idea on it, which I think is bad. Look, packaging up like the basis, like roll down and like selling that and like throwing on some like staking yield with it is like clearly there's demand for it and like people want that yield and like that's like a thing and that's fine. Like I don't have like a core problem with it. I just like do want sort of the market to be aware there is risk.
00:35:04.347 - 00:35:35.901, Speaker C: Like this thing could get toasted. Like it's not like guarantee and like, I'm not saying it's unlikely that we're going to just like suddenly start trading like crazy, like backwardated, but like there's been times where like the curve is like moved down like 35, 50% like in the course of like 48 hours, like it can get have like real shocks to it and like you think you can like execute on these things and you can't. So I don't know as somebody who's like traded a lot of it, like just want to make sure that people are aware sort of the risk on it. But like there's. I got no beef with like it as like a concept. Like I think like it's fine as long as people are aware of that.
00:35:36.013 - 00:36:09.897, Speaker E: Yeah, I think, you know, it's ironic that, you know, you guys brought us on. I was like, I would probably say like I know Dan's trader the futures curve probably more than anyone else I know in the space. But you know, I've spent a tremendous amount of time on it as well. It's definitely not a free ride in any way, shape or form. It's also like I got into like a bit of a spat the other day with someone talking about like unifying rates on, on like across the board. It's like you should never want to unify rates like counterparty risk, credit risk between different exchanges. It's massive, right? Like what happens when one exchange blows out or like you can't put enough sats on another.
00:36:09.897 - 00:36:31.057, Speaker E: Right. And then there's a lot of things that I think like again it just depends on how you, how you kind of want to advertise it again. I have friends who have invested in this, friends working on the project. So I'm not trying to knock it, but like at the same time, like, there's definitely like inherent risks and also like counterparty risks on exchanges that you actually want to, you know, go and put this money on. Right. Like this is a good question. Right.
00:36:31.057 - 00:36:49.213, Speaker E: Like, and you can ask Dan on this, but how much money do you think the futures curve can even take? Right. At like a decent yield? It's not as large as people think. Right. So there's even a cap to it. Like you are bringing your own kind of cap into how much rates can go. Right. So like the product works really well when it's not that large, theoretically.
00:36:49.389 - 00:36:50.773, Speaker C: Or you got a bull market.
00:36:50.949 - 00:37:01.025, Speaker E: But even then, like, I don't know the rates will come off enough or like then you'll have like really weird arbs between CME and like there's like a bunch of things, right? Like they call it.
00:37:01.725 - 00:37:11.885, Speaker B: They call it the synthetic dollar and the ticker is usde, which to me that, for me that's the biggest problem with it, which is that it's pretty misleading for retail.
00:37:12.045 - 00:37:24.305, Speaker C: Yeah. If I got any gripe with it, it's just like, just call it more just like this package trade that you're looking to sell and that's fine. And then just put the risks on it and let it go. I don't know.
00:37:25.205 - 00:37:27.225, Speaker E: This is OG Babel Finance.
00:37:28.185 - 00:37:28.697, Speaker C: I mean. Yeah.
00:37:28.721 - 00:37:29.017, Speaker E: I don't know.
00:37:29.041 - 00:37:51.753, Speaker C: We. I mean, we did talk to them a lot too and they were like setting it up and like we. I don't think there's like any bad intentions or any like hiding of stuff. I just like, I just want to make sure everybody's aware of the risks and the stuff going into it. I mean, that being said, like, it's crypto, right? Like there's. There's a lot of risks and a lot of things that like nobody's like seeing when they're doing it. So it's like this is not Even probably top 10 sort of real risks I've seen, like not put in front of people.
00:37:51.753 - 00:37:55.795, Speaker C: I mean, we had many such cases two years ago.
00:37:58.335 - 00:38:02.835, Speaker A: So do you think this will be around 2, this product will be around 2 years from now?
00:38:03.655 - 00:38:18.151, Speaker C: I think. Yeah, I do. Probably. Yeah. My concern for it is like that there is just a giant shock. You guys remember xiv? You remember that sort of whole sag, right? It's great. It's great.
00:38:18.151 - 00:38:18.575, Speaker C: It's great.
00:38:18.615 - 00:38:19.261, Speaker E: It's dead.
00:38:19.383 - 00:38:23.405, Speaker C: I don't think it's going to end like that. But I just think there is tail risk on it. Yeah.
00:38:24.145 - 00:38:53.025, Speaker E: Also it's really hard to kill these Stable Coin projects. For what it's worth. Even the worst, I don't know, TUSD or whatever, random stable Coin, they never actually fully die because someone can always park USD in there and it looks good. So I guess the better question is will it massively grow in two years time? I'm not entirely sure. And it's very much market beta. I think sue actually said this, which is like you're actually better off just like longing eth if you're bullish on Athena. Which is ironic.
00:38:53.025 - 00:38:56.633, Speaker E: But yeah, the truth. Right. It only goes up if eth goes up.
00:38:56.769 - 00:39:02.185, Speaker B: Where are we in the cycle? Are we still in a four year cycle? Are we in a super cycle? Are we.
00:39:02.225 - 00:39:03.885, Speaker C: You're always in the first inning.
00:39:06.265 - 00:39:10.537, Speaker B: Are we in the left translator cycle? Where are we?
00:39:10.681 - 00:39:12.929, Speaker C: I'd say we're about halfway through it if I had to guess.
00:39:13.057 - 00:39:13.725, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:39:14.145 - 00:39:17.569, Speaker A: Wait, I didn't hear that. Halfway through things. Halfway through.
00:39:17.657 - 00:39:18.841, Speaker C: Yeah, halfway through.
00:39:19.033 - 00:39:20.393, Speaker A: I didn't want to hear that.
00:39:20.569 - 00:39:28.361, Speaker C: No, maybe it's a super cycle. Maybe the ETFs just permanently keep us out. I mean we haven't even had the having yet.
00:39:28.513 - 00:40:12.763, Speaker E: Yeah, it's also like what does it even mean to be a four year cycle anymore? Do I think like we'll have rampant fraud like we did last time? Most, most definitely not. Like I don't think peak to trough will be ever like as bad as it has been in the past. But at the same time, do I think like, you know, a lot of the quote unquote VC supernova can persist? Probably not as well, like, but it's also again, it's funny, it's like you ask like two guys who are, who primarily run their businesses as liquid. So it's literally embedded in the outlook we have every day, which is, you know, I don't really know, but I don't really have to know necessarily in order to continue doing my job. And that's literally why we started split capital as a liquid fund. If we didn't do it then it would be a huge problem because I don't know how much harder markets can run from here. And I hope it's forever.
00:40:12.763 - 00:40:13.467, Speaker E: Right.
00:40:13.651 - 00:40:19.819, Speaker B: What is the biggest bullshit you guys are seeing in the market or in the industry that you want to call out?
00:40:19.987 - 00:40:48.331, Speaker C: Oh, they want to call out. Ooh, that's like a slightly different question. I think there's a lot of, there's a lot of things being attached to meme coins like, in their market action that I think is just kind of nonsense. Like, and I'll say this, like, first off, like, I have no beef with them as, like, an asset. I have no beef with people trading them. Like, I think the whole thing's fine. But there's this whole idea that, like, this is, like, culture incarnate.
00:40:48.331 - 00:41:09.869, Speaker C: And, like, this is, like, the great. There's, like. And there's, like, people writing crazy thesis about some of this. I just. Like, I'm not there. Like, maybe I'm old and, like, I just don't get it anymore, which is possible. But I have personally, like, I don't see it as much more than, like, people like to speculate, and they're gonna find the fastest thing to speculate on, and they're gonna do it, and that's fine.
00:41:09.869 - 00:41:27.587, Speaker C: And I think that's, like, cool. Like, Doge isn't, like, a new thing, right? Like, it's been around forever. It's had, like, multiple cycles. And it doesn't mean, like, all these things are gonna die either. People are, like, inferring crazy things. Like, people are inferring that, like, the entire financial system is gonna be overthrown because, like, meme coins have, like, changed the way, like, people, like, think about assets. I just, like a little.
00:41:27.587 - 00:41:29.683, Speaker C: Some of it's a little out there for me, but it's.
00:41:29.699 - 00:41:30.979, Speaker A: The VC's coming in now, right?
00:41:31.027 - 00:41:46.627, Speaker C: So, yeah, I don't know. Like, I've seen meme coins raising rounds now. I think that's, like, wild. Like, I don't. I'm not even. Whatever, I guess, like, do it, disclose it. I'm not sure.
00:41:46.771 - 00:42:25.745, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean, the meme coin stuff has definitely, like, moved pretty far out there, I guess, in, like, calling things out. I would say it's just, like, something I've been telling a lot of people and just been talking about pretty actively is just how real returns are and what it actually means to return capital and make money in the space. And I think there's a lot of glorification of a handful of people that can make money. But ultimately, doing this stuff day in, day out is extremely difficult. And I would not tell the average person to ever do this as their primary function. Most definitely, because, like, there's nothing to glorify about this. Like, it's.
00:42:25.745 - 00:42:46.445, Speaker E: It's incredibly difficult. And, like, getting to a point where you can consistently do it is impossibly difficult. And it's. It's. It can all go away in a minute, too, right? Like, you can. You can always, like, end up with a reality where like your edge no longer works and you can lose your money and you don't realize it. So I just, you know, kind of call out like more the P and L flexing.
00:42:50.495 - 00:43:00.103, Speaker A: Today we have Jackson, the founder of Thunder Terminal to talk to us a bit about what he's learned building a crypto startup. Jackson, what are you building right now?
00:43:00.119 - 00:43:08.863, Speaker D: We're trying to build a trading platform on chain that lends the same user experience as you might have with like Coinbase or Binance or any of the sort.
00:43:08.999 - 00:43:12.143, Speaker A: What's one thing that you've learned while you were building this product?
00:43:12.239 - 00:43:29.967, Speaker D: One of the main takeaways I had was that crypto index is way too hard on the tech and that's fine to do, but the issue is that all of Defi in aggregate has less users than some note taking apps on the app store. So until there's user adoption, what's the tech good for? I don't know. That's one of the main takeaways most definitely.
00:43:30.111 - 00:43:38.159, Speaker A: How do you think about sourcing feedback from customers and users especially being that it's much harder to reach them versus traditional web? 2?
00:43:38.247 - 00:44:00.909, Speaker D: We have communities on like Telegram and Discord and I usually get DMs on Twitter or those respective apps as well. I think like, you know, the community is pretty vocal about stuff they want. But to be frank, a lot of our developers, and myself included also use the application and are traders by trade. So we don't need to source too much user feedback to know sort of what the next thing is to build.
00:44:00.997 - 00:44:02.229, Speaker A: You dog food your own product?
00:44:02.317 - 00:44:03.549, Speaker D: Yeah, pretty much.
00:44:03.677 - 00:44:07.965, Speaker A: What's one lesson that you've learned that you want to give to future founders who are building the space?
00:44:08.125 - 00:44:30.437, Speaker D: Try to build a business as opposed to just like a token launch pad. I think incentives are kind of misaligned in crypto where founders effectively are able to IPO at any point in time whenever they want, like an IPO equivalent and that's fine, but you should build something sustainable. I think that's like one of the things I very rarely see in crypto is something that lasts more than a single cycle. It's very rare.
00:44:30.621 - 00:44:40.491, Speaker A: Obviously crypto is a very volatile market. Some days you have really good days, some days you have really bad days. Given that you're building a on chain trading terminal, how do you take this?
00:44:40.603 - 00:45:20.893, Speaker D: I'll be frank. A lot of people come to me and they're like, oh, you know, x tangentially competitive product, has like Y feature or does you know this amount in volume or whatever it is. But the truth is like I've been talking to some of the folks that we've been working with recently and I realized that we just are really the only project reinvesting back into itself and not taking money off the table. I have like the utmost respect for lifestyle businesses, but they aren't necessarily sustainable in the highest growth stages. They work to a point. So I would say that back to the thing I mentioned regarding sustainability and making it through multiple cycles. I realized that in a bull run, being cash flow positive isn't very useful.
00:45:20.893 - 00:45:39.777, Speaker D: So we're pretty much going balls to the wall on this just to ensure that we do last multiple cycles as a cemented project that people go to and are familiarized with and trust. I think like right now is the time to scale up. It's not the time to take cash off the table and not a single project that's competitive with us is doing that. None that I'm aware of.
00:45:39.881 - 00:45:43.953, Speaker A: You're going all in. I think that is probably the right move coming to a bull market.
00:45:44.089 - 00:45:51.377, Speaker D: Yeah, pretty much all in. All ships on the table. We'll see what the river cards are. I don't know yet. But yeah, we're going balls to the wall on this.
00:45:51.481 - 00:45:53.281, Speaker A: Awesome. Jackson, thank you so much for your time.
00:45:53.353 - 00:45:54.725, Speaker D: For sure, appreciate it.
00:45:58.355 - 00:46:04.215, Speaker B: What would you recommend? Either the average retail or a crypto founder who has a full time job.
00:46:04.515 - 00:46:08.735, Speaker E: Just buy shit that you believe in, but that's about it. And if you don't.
00:46:09.155 - 00:46:17.563, Speaker B: But most shit that people believe in are actually shit. And there may be only a handful of assets that's worth holding long term.
00:46:17.739 - 00:46:39.545, Speaker E: I don't think so. I push back against that. I think most people know what's value and what's not and what's real. I think every time someone's like I'm going to go buy X and Y and Z coin, they only do it out of greed. I don't think it's. I don't think it's almost ever done out of, you know, anything other than hey yo, like I need to make more money because my friend made too much money. And like, you know, everyone is making money and I'm sidelined and poor.
00:46:39.545 - 00:47:08.719, Speaker E: And I think literally every single person on the timeline thinks this whether subconsciously or not. They just think like I'm being sidelined. Everyone else making infinite more than I am. Which is literally not the truth at all. Like I think one thing that I've learned post ftx, I worked on a lot of claim stuff Post fdx, what I learned is literally everyone lost all their money, like more or less in the space. So you know, this is pretty, pretty big, like liquidation overall. Like people don't have the money that they used to have, theoretically.
00:47:08.719 - 00:47:26.199, Speaker E: And like, it's just best not to ever compare it to like whatever P and L flexing you see on Twitter. It's just not, it's not sticky. We've seen it 100 times over. Guys like me, you like Imran Dan, we've seen like many, many P and L flexors, like lose it all in the dumbest ways possible. Right?
00:47:26.367 - 00:47:43.111, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, sorry. My. I don't know what's been on my camera. Yeah, like, if anybody ever asked me, I just. This has actually changed a little bit over time. But it's like I tell them to buy a little bit of bitcoin, a little bit of Eth and a little bit of Solana and then just like don't look at it. Like, I think that's just kind of the only advice I'll ever feel giving.
00:47:43.111 - 00:48:03.551, Speaker C: And like that used to be just bitcoin and then it used to just be bitcoin eth and now it's like the three. And if something gets really big and stable, I would like pitch that as like a fourth. But that's like so. And like size those obviously, like accordingly. I think that's like the best advice you can do if you're not going to be out there in the weeds like doing this like full time. Like, I don't think you should be bothering.
00:48:03.703 - 00:48:12.399, Speaker E: Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is a, this is another lesson from sue, which was there are no part time doctors, there are no part time lawyers, there should be no part time trader.
00:48:12.447 - 00:48:45.973, Speaker A: Right. Given where the venture market is. I think Meltem tweeted this out yesterday, but what she said was ultimately that VCs are seeing how much valuation has gone up last cycle and they're bidding up the valuations for the first six months so that they can stop allocating after the first six months of the quote unquote bull market. And it turns out it's becoming a self fulfilling prophecy where now valuations are already where it is at, like in the last half of the bull market. So how do you guys kind of see the venture market today?
00:48:46.109 - 00:49:10.969, Speaker C: There's just so much more money. There's just like a tremendous amount of money. And also like a lot of these deals, like one fund will take the whole thing down. People are just getting crowded out left and right right now. And especially so like you may see like a $30 million raise and it's got 25 people on it, but, like, two guys took 29 of the 30. So it's, I don't know, like, people are scrambling, I think, to like, deploy. It's like, it's gotten very hard to get into rounds, which is like pushing pricing up.
00:49:10.969 - 00:49:30.985, Speaker C: Some of these things are priced too cheap. Like, obviously, like, if you've got that much, like, demand on it. I don't know if, like, people are. I don't know if there's like a whole, like, really long thought process of it other than just like, I need to deploy and I can't get access and like, I gotta put it somewhere. I don't know. That's like sort of where my thought is on the whole thing. There's just a lot of money.
00:49:30.985 - 00:49:34.527, Speaker C: There's a lot of venture dollars out there, like in any given point that can deploy.
00:49:34.671 - 00:50:04.701, Speaker E: I mean, you know, on that, on that point, like, that's literally our fun thesis overall, right? That there's too many venture dollars in the space. And obviously most of these people aren't competitive. And obviously most of these people aren't getting tier one deals. Like, I'll get angel allocation into something, right? And I just know, like, I couldn't get size on it. Like, it's the same kind of group of people that will always get the same size. So it's just, it's like way more competitive. And brilliance is like, it's logarithmic, right? Like, you're not getting like infinite brilliance all the time for some new projects and new protocol.
00:50:04.701 - 00:50:37.481, Speaker E: That's like groundbreaking, right? You're getting a lot of like, C + tier projects that are getting insane valuations. It goes back to the same thesis, right? Like, there are way too many crypto venture dollars pushing way too many, too few deals. I think it has nothing to do with, like, people allocating their only job as venture people is to allocate capital and to raise the next fund. We'll see what happens with the 21 vintage, but I think it's going to be pretty bad overall. So we'll see if there's like a reshuffling. Ultimately, this is why we launched a liquid fund as well. So, you know, we have that, like, it's literally a trade embedded in the fund, right, that we think Ventures is going to.
00:50:37.481 - 00:51:23.209, Speaker E: Is going to. Is not going to do nearly as well as liquid will, you know, risk adjusted going forward. Rob Haddock from, from Dragonfly put out a pretty good, you know, tweet thread on this, but he really just highlights all of the kind of issues that exist both globally and locally in crypto for venture. Overall, I think it's just like you're getting like the last rounds of the last round to just keep pushing out more dollars. Like valuations go from you know, 100 to you know like 3 billion within you know, eight, nine months. And I think the last kind of part of the whole problem is also liquidity on these things is like now getting even better, which is like really weird. So it creates like way more misaligned incentives of like projects launching at 10 billion that don't have anything on them.
00:51:23.209 - 00:51:47.701, Speaker E: But like at the same time when those tokens become liquid on market, like you'll see some pretty nasty flushes. Right. This is also why Altcoin open interest is so high relative to last cycles. We are way, way, way, way beyond what we should be in terms of like Altcoin open interest for perpetuals. Because people are like now speculating on all these tokens that basically have, you know, 1 in 10, right. One like so 10 and 100. Right.
00:51:47.701 - 00:52:05.469, Speaker E: Like 10% of you know, FDB is circulating. So now you're getting like a really, really, you know, skewed circulating to FDV ratio which just causes people to short and speculate and all this garbage. But ultimately it just creates like a lot of systemic risk that eventually will come to roost, but we're probably not there yet.
00:52:05.597 - 00:52:22.331, Speaker C: I mean like venture is great, right? Like you put it in and you pray and you don't have mark to market for the most part. It's kind of a great thing to be running in crypto and get long term exposure. It's just like, like I said though, but it's been like there's just a lot of money like continuing to do it.
00:52:22.443 - 00:52:25.907, Speaker E: Don't let him psyops you into raising a venture fund, kids. Please don't.
00:52:26.011 - 00:52:27.363, Speaker C: I don't think you should raise any fund.
00:52:27.459 - 00:52:27.731, Speaker E: Correct.
00:52:27.763 - 00:52:30.363, Speaker C: That's always been, I've always told people that for my life.
00:52:30.499 - 00:52:35.251, Speaker E: Correct. But more seriously, you're not going to get the deals that D is getting, so please do.
00:52:35.323 - 00:52:41.085, Speaker C: I don't get the deals. Like I'm not like in the, I'm not in the right information flow.
00:52:41.205 - 00:52:43.785, Speaker E: You're not getting the deals that Imran's getting, that's for sure.
00:52:44.565 - 00:52:47.237, Speaker C: I actually think that's going to get a lot worse for what it's worth.
00:52:47.301 - 00:52:48.333, Speaker E: Yeah, I agree.
00:52:48.469 - 00:52:58.717, Speaker A: I mean it's pretty bad billion dollar valuations, but at least for AI and Bitcoin infrastructure projects and modular, which is.
00:52:58.741 - 00:53:00.145, Speaker E: Like the three horse sector.
00:53:00.805 - 00:53:02.145, Speaker B: The Three Horsemen.
00:53:02.925 - 00:53:07.447, Speaker E: When we're launching our new project, guys, I feel like we could do kol. We'll be the KOL for ourselves.
00:53:07.621 - 00:53:11.683, Speaker A: Ordinals. Are you guys trading ordinals or buying ordinals?
00:53:11.819 - 00:53:21.379, Speaker C: We have, yeah, but I wouldn't say it's like a ton. We like. No, I would not say it's like a core thing. We don't. But, like, we have, like, here and there.
00:53:21.507 - 00:53:24.667, Speaker A: Any favorite projects that you like that if you want to name them?
00:53:24.811 - 00:53:28.883, Speaker C: Oh, I'd have to get the guy who, like, handles it. I'm, like, pretty out of the weeds on it. Okay.
00:53:29.059 - 00:53:33.849, Speaker E: How about you? Are you talking about, like, on ordinals in particular or anything in general?
00:53:34.027 - 00:53:42.741, Speaker A: I mean, general, like, any maybe ordinals. Nft, like, anything that you're seeing that. That you're excited about? Obviously. Like, if you look at eth. NFTs, they're down only.
00:53:42.893 - 00:54:14.495, Speaker E: Yeah, I'm a cursed NFT trader, so I will Simply not touch NFTs. I will buy the index. I will be the index buyer of NFTs and blur and already and whatever else. But, yeah, I think, you know, overall there's been a few projects that are, like, more adjacent to, like, core L1s. Like, butterfly has been really interesting that we've been paying attention to. And then also Thala as well on Aptos has been really interesting. Yeah, those two, I think, are just, like, just great teams.
00:54:14.495 - 00:54:38.615, Speaker E: And, like, again, like, that's kind of what we focus on internally. So we just focus on teams that, like, people overlook or don't have a mandate for. And we focus and see if we can help them out and push them to a spot where, like, they're, like, literally making money, which might be bearish, actually, but they're literally making money and, like, doing really well, and things are growing in the right direction. But I think once the Zeitgeist catches up, then. Different ballgame.
00:54:39.035 - 00:54:51.335, Speaker A: All right, this was a good chat. Any. Any final comments? Thoughts on the market? Maybe, I guess. Dan, you. You've tweeted this before about the speculative ball of fire.
00:54:51.715 - 00:54:52.935, Speaker C: Hot ball of money.
00:54:53.515 - 00:54:54.043, Speaker A: There you go.
00:54:54.099 - 00:54:57.095, Speaker E: Speculative ball of fire. Oh, my God.
00:54:58.485 - 00:54:59.429, Speaker C: Oh, my God.
00:54:59.597 - 00:55:05.469, Speaker E: It's literally never been more over for this podcast. Holy. Oh, no.
00:55:05.597 - 00:55:11.185, Speaker A: It's over. Hot ball of fire. Hot ball of fireball of money.
00:55:11.605 - 00:55:12.825, Speaker C: Oh, my God.
00:55:17.085 - 00:55:18.585, Speaker A: We're going to cut this part out.
00:55:19.245 - 00:55:19.981, Speaker C: No, run it.
00:55:20.013 - 00:55:21.945, Speaker E: No, we're running it. We're running it.
00:55:22.765 - 00:55:24.243, Speaker A: I'm Joking. I'm joking.
00:55:24.389 - 00:55:51.151, Speaker C: Yeah. Look, I mean, I think this is just like. You do see this. I mean, this is kind of a consistent behavior of just like, you have gains in one sector, you have money that rotates, and it just sort of is this wrecking ball that moves around crypto and all different pieces. I think, as certain assets just get to a certain size and they're a little more immune to it. But you do still see it, right? There'll be big moves into one corner of the ecosystem. It'll get hot plateau, and then move into the next one.
00:55:51.151 - 00:56:00.585, Speaker C: And a lot of what we're doing is looking at where those flows are going. We don't try to predict them more as we like to see them, like, happen, and then, like, we jump in. So, like, we. We are part of the problem.
00:56:01.725 - 00:56:09.485, Speaker A: I mean, I guess, like, where would. Where would be the next ball? Like, where would I guess. What's the next sector? You look at where. From where we are today.
00:56:09.605 - 00:56:10.985, Speaker C: Just gotta watch it.
00:56:12.165 - 00:56:25.949, Speaker E: The higher implied volatility in the market goes, the more we have to think about it in this way. Right. Where we literally have to consider, like, how unsustainable, you know, the prices of an asset. Right. And how. How nimble we have to be. Right.
00:56:25.949 - 00:56:39.209, Speaker E: So obviously, when Solana's at 8 bucks, it's a different ballgame. Right? You can hold that outright for, like, a very long time, but when it's trading, like 100 to 140 within, like, a week and a half, like, that's just a different game altogether.
00:56:39.377 - 00:56:52.033, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, thanks for joining. It was a lot of fun chatting with you guys. And we'll have you guys on again. Maybe we could do, like, a quarterly macro update on State of Things. It'll be fun. We'll do it until we're down only.
00:56:52.089 - 00:56:57.931, Speaker E: Again, and then get us off when we're all bearish circles.
00:56:58.003 - 00:56:59.375, Speaker A: There's nothing to talk about.
00:57:00.795 - 00:57:03.571, Speaker E: No, there's plenty to talk about anyway.
00:57:03.643 - 00:57:09.235, Speaker A: But nobody wants to hear it. Yeah, nobody wants to go on Zapper or Portfolio Manager look at their portfolio.
00:57:09.275 - 00:57:13.099, Speaker E: Right? Correct. Anyway, thank you so much, guys.
