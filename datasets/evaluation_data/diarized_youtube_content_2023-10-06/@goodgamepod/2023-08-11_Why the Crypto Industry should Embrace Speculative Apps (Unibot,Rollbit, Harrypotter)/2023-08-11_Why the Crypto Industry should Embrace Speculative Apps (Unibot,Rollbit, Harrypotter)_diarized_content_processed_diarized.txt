00:00:00.320 - 00:00:20.814, Speaker A: Welcome to good game. Your no b's insights for crypto founders. Okay? Every sector has a superpower. Healthcare is about saving lives. If you look at the movie industry, it's about telling a very compelling story for crypto. What is that? Is it speculation?
00:00:20.974 - 00:00:38.782, Speaker B: I mean, for now, yes. The number one thing is speculation. Number two thing for me is entertainment. Like Obama, Sonic, Harry Potter, Bald, like all these people doing social trading, telegram sending memes around, and then people talking about them on Twitter. That's entertainment for me. So for now, these are the most, the two most important things could change in the future.
00:00:38.878 - 00:01:41.974, Speaker A: Why is it speculation, though? Looking for your next startup idea in crypto? Check out our request for startups list and get inspired at Alliance XYZ ideas. Welcome to Goodgame. Today we're going to be speaking about one of the industries where we think is going to first take off in crypto, and that's gambling speculation. We talked a lot about speculation over the past few podcasts, and in fact, I actually forgot to tell you this, chow. But I've had a bunch of listeners that had asked us about speculation generally, and I've seen a few tweets also recently at you, Twitter, on Twitter chow, where they talked about how they agree with speculation and how both crypto investors and founders should be embracing speculation Versus, uh, pushing against it. And, uh, I know you had some thoughts around this, and I'd love to talk more about, you know, generally what we're seeing today, but historically what we've seen over the past decade, and I'll throw out, uh, a couple terms before we get chaos thoughts on the space. But, uh, Harry potter, Sonic, ten inu.
00:01:42.274 - 00:01:44.682, Speaker B: Well, you forgot Obama again.
00:01:44.738 - 00:02:21.174, Speaker A: Harry Potter, Obama, Sonic, ten inu. I'll tell you how this meme started, too, which, which I think it's great. Okay, we're starting to see Telegram, Bots, Unibot. There's at least another 25 bots that have come out, lootbot, et cetera, et cetera. We'll talk a little bit about the speculative mania that's starting with that, and then we'll talk more about memes, Pepe and others and just kind of dive deep historically on all of this. And so maybe before we get started, let's talk about your thoughts, and I'll give you a couple of my thoughts. And let's break it down to your point.
00:02:22.434 - 00:03:12.324, Speaker B: I also got a lot of DM's after our last episode where we actually only very briefly talked about speculation. And a lot of our listeners actually wanted us to talk about speculation. A bit more. By speculation, I mean the general theme of gambling, shitcoin trading, even NFT as shitcoins, that kind of stuff. It feels like most serious people in crypto are too embarrassed to talk about this, this topic. Well, obviously we consider ourselves as serious people, but precisely for this reason, we want to talk about it and want to talk about it because I feel like there's just a huge divide between the shitcoiners and then the super hardcore technical people. There's two very distinct communities within crypto.
00:03:12.324 - 00:03:25.676, Speaker B: One is the shit one, retail traders, the anons on crypto Twitter, and the other ones are the super technical builders, and then the VC's, the crypto elites. There's a divide between the crypto plebs and the crypto Elite.
00:03:25.780 - 00:03:52.720, Speaker A: There's even a divide on the newer sectors, like NFTs. There was a recent tweet I shared with you, Chow, where I forgot her name, but she used to be a dev rel at a startup. But she said, I don't understand the trading community. I don't understand the Harry Potter, Obama, Sonic and Inuit meme. And she goes, in fact, I don't even understand NFt communities. So it's very. Something very important that you're touching on there.
00:03:52.912 - 00:04:18.472, Speaker B: So these communities don't really understand each other, especially the quote unquote crypto elite, don't understand the crypto plebs. And so that's why we want to talk about this, because that's where the users are. The users are the people who are trading shitcoins today. And the builders and the elites and the super technical people, they're too detached from this world. They're too detached from the real user base of crypto today. So that's why I want to talk about this.
00:04:18.568 - 00:04:56.794, Speaker A: Yeah. And I did some research, and obviously, we've been in a space probably now a decade, so we're pretty much boomers at this point. But some fun facts that I thought was interesting for us to know, at least for listeners that just came into crypto, is the fact that if you look at one of the. One of the first apps that was built on bitcoin was called Satoshi Dice, which is a gambling app. And at one point, it took up 50% of all of bitcoins transaction. And a lot of the technical folks, people that really believed in the bitcoin is money narrative, hated this. There was a funny video I shared with you yesterday.
00:04:56.794 - 00:05:26.906, Speaker A: It was posted ten years ago, but it was one of the, you know, bitcoin is money, maxi groups. And he recorded a video and he said, like, I hate speculation on bitcoin is. Bitcoin is not about speculation. It is money. And, uh, and I feel like it's, it still perpetuates today. Like, you know, people believe that it is the future of money, which in, in some regard it is. But if you want real world utility, you know, we got to talk about the speculative piece because that is the piece that's going to bring people into the space.
00:05:27.010 - 00:05:51.014, Speaker B: By the way, that argument, it's in itself like that, that bitcoin is money, not speculation. That that in itself is self contradictory because money is by definition speculative. You want bitcoin as your money because you speculate that the fiat monies are bad. So by nature it's speculation. But anyway, Satoshi ties is, I would say at this point, is a legend.
00:05:51.594 - 00:05:52.414, Speaker A: Legend.
00:05:53.394 - 00:06:05.642, Speaker B: Eric Voorhees, he's also one of the legends. He's the creator of Satoshi Dice, and he sold that, uh, that website, Satoshi dies in I think, 2013 for.
00:06:05.778 - 00:06:11.218, Speaker A: I forgot the exact number, but 100, 2120 thousand bitcoins. Yes, you heard it right.
00:06:11.266 - 00:06:20.306, Speaker B: Well, a hundred thousand over 100,000 bitcoin, not dollars. So at that time it was worth like $10 million. And at today's price, I don't know.
00:06:20.330 - 00:06:25.162, Speaker A: Like, what is it, $2 3 billion? Yeah, yeah, something crazy like that.
00:06:25.338 - 00:06:48.766, Speaker B: But, but Eric, Eric is actually like just some, some history. Eric is one of those OG bitcoiners who actually don't believe in maximalism. He's the one who's, who's really embracing the programmability of bitcoin and later on Ethereum and others. And I'm sure the Satoshi dice was, was a big part of it.
00:06:48.830 - 00:07:06.130, Speaker A: Yeah, he, he was a maxi at one point, and then he switched. He was probably the first group of people to switch from the bitcoin is money to like, you know, programmable money with Ethereum, and then obviously with some of the startups that he's built after that. So kudos to him. And then more and more people followed after that.
00:07:06.202 - 00:07:17.610, Speaker B: Do you want to fast forward to the last two weeks? Because there were a lot of very interesting experiments on chain experiment experiments in the last few weeks.
00:07:17.722 - 00:07:20.054, Speaker A: And my God, so many.
00:07:20.634 - 00:07:51.994, Speaker B: My favorite cat on the Internet clip, he calls it the retard summer as homage to the great DeFi summer of 2020. So instead of DeFi summer, it's the retard. So obviously there's a lot of really retarded shitcoin trading. Meme coins, et cetera. But I want to dive deep and figure out if there's anything deeper than just meme coin trading. So do you want to start with some of the things you've personally aped into?
00:07:52.114 - 00:08:38.392, Speaker A: Yeah. Before we do that, I also want to talk about Cl. He posted an article, I shared it with you about a month ago, and he talked about the genesis of retard summer. But he talked about there's more of a macro narrative that's at play. And what he said was, one is you have social networks. And so like there's like inherent network effects of people shilling their own tokens. Um, and for most, for the average person, that is like, you know, not really into crypto, but you know, trades, shitcoins, uh, we call them like plebes or retail folks, um, for them, they don't have time to diligence startups, they don't have time to diligence tokens.
00:08:38.392 - 00:09:34.412, Speaker A: So what they do is they just ape into or invest in tokens that they hear about through their friends or through their social feeds. And it makes a lot of sense, right? You know, there's people that I work with that's outside of crypto and they ping me and ask me, hey, what do you think about this token? And I'm like, where did you even hear about this? And it turns out it's just people within their social feed. And so I do think that what's happening is that there's more awareness of just investing in crypto and people just want to make gains similar to like Pepe Dogecoin and others. That's the narrative they only know about. They don't know about the other narratives. So what's happened the past few weeks and what have I aped into? I think. I think one of them was hamster, even though it was hamster coin.
00:09:34.412 - 00:09:53.766, Speaker A: And essentially for listeners that haven't heard about this, it's a live race. Hamster. Live hamster race. So there's literally a camera in front of like four hamsters. There's a maze. And whoever gets through this maze first wins. And people bet on which hamster that they want to win.
00:09:53.766 - 00:10:42.188, Speaker A: And then there's a pot and then it's distributed evenly based on all the people that bid on the right hamster. It would. I think at one point it had over a 1500 viewers and there was probably, you know, I love the shitcoin investor investors on Twitter or the traders, because once they start to collect fees on a daily basis, they'll annualize it automatically and they'll say it's worth, you see this on twitter, and then they'll annualize it and say it's worth $100 million. And so people ape in because of that and it's whatever. But that obviously quickly fell through because, you know, the dev wasn't like doing things by the book and people saw through it and then they ended up dumping the token. It went to zero.
00:10:42.276 - 00:11:10.296, Speaker B: I think that the real problem is that just that the games were pretty boring. So I didn't like three times, and you have to wait like an hour between. So by three times, I mean three races, three hamster races, and between every two race races, you have to wait like an hour, and then each race lasts like literally 2 seconds because the hamster just goes from, it's so quick. Yeah, it's too quick. So the game, it was very obvious that you would just lose interest. People will lose interest very quickly. But go ahead.
00:11:10.320 - 00:11:42.302, Speaker A: Yeah, go ahead. Well, I mean, like, if you think about, you know, every trend that picked up in crypto, like, let's say cryptokitties, and we could talk about that in a bit. But, you know, cryptokitties was this, you know, NfT platform where you could buy mint cats and breed them and sell them. And at one point it took up, I don't know, like 75% of all of Ethereum transactions, uh, back in 2017. I feel like these lightning in the bottle moments are really a precursor to what's going to happen in the future. Right? And, and I think the same with hamster coin. Right? Although it's funny.
00:11:42.302 - 00:12:15.486, Speaker A: And, uh, you know, you have the shitcoin traders that will end up purchasing these tokens or whatever, but there's a signal there that we see. And if you think about it, like, what's the biggest, like, live betting race that's out there? It's horsebay horse racing. Right. And so imagine being able to put, you know, these races on chain that's live where people could use crypto tokens as a way to bet on the horses. That could be something very big. And millions of people travel to these race, you know, race courses and they bet on horses. Uh, but imagine doing this live, uh, anywhere from the world, uh, with, uh, with crypto.
00:12:15.486 - 00:12:17.502, Speaker A: I think that could be something that could be very plausible.
00:12:17.598 - 00:12:25.302, Speaker B: Um, did I ever tell you how I got into crypto? Uh, crypto or bitcoin? I mean, no, I'm sure. I'm told you. I've told you, like, several.
00:12:25.358 - 00:12:27.448, Speaker A: I mean, you've told me, but not the audience.
00:12:27.566 - 00:12:47.264, Speaker B: I, and there are several stories. There are several, like, you know, incidents, but one of them was how I aped my entire net worth ten years ago into offshore sports betting exchange, and it got frozen. The money was frozen by the bank for six months.
00:12:47.564 - 00:12:49.332, Speaker A: Wasn't that the scariest moment of your life?
00:12:49.388 - 00:13:09.600, Speaker B: Yes. And. And that. That was. That was basically when I realized you need an uncensorable form of money and payment. That was the. I mean, even today, I still think sports betting and other, like, betting platforms is one of the most obvious applications of crypto.
00:13:09.600 - 00:13:25.822, Speaker B: Right. Like the fact that when you wire your money, when you withdraw your money, you don't need the permission of the platform or the bank itself. But anyway, that's a side story. Let's go back to the stuff that we, you and I, aped in in the last couple of weeks. So, hamster. What else?
00:13:25.878 - 00:13:32.314, Speaker A: Hamster. Harry Potter, Obama, Sonic, Taninu bought that.
00:13:33.094 - 00:13:36.014, Speaker B: What the hell is that? That's the one I don't get.
00:13:36.094 - 00:14:19.654, Speaker A: Yeah, I bought this a couple months ago, but to me, I tweeted this out earlier, which is like, the harder I laugh, the more I buy. But it's a plausible thesis, right? I mean, if you think about art, like NFT art, the consensus is, you know, as long as it attracts that you like the art, forget the speculative nature of it. If you like the art, you buy it. And I think that's very common. I think that there's some similar analogies with meme coins. Right? I'm not going to say every meme coin is going to take off, but this one in particular, I think this one is special because this is the first meme that isn't related to any Internet culture. So if you think about.
00:14:19.654 - 00:14:59.492, Speaker A: Let's think about all the meme coins that are out there. Dogecoin was the first meme coin that came out soon after was Shiba Inu, and now it's pepe. All three of them came from, you know, like, historically came from, like, four chan and these underground Internet culture factories. I feel like Harry Potter is the first that really came out of crypto Twitter, which I think is very interesting, in my opinion. And it's interesting because someone posted a picture of the way this became popularized, was someone was in some country. I forgot what country it was. I think it was Thailand.
00:14:59.492 - 00:15:14.790, Speaker A: And someone took a picture of a backpack, and the backpack had a logo, and that logo had Harry Potter, Obama Sonic, and the number ten coin. I think Sheba was added on for the meme effect, but it.
00:15:14.822 - 00:15:16.006, Speaker B: Bitcoin. Bitcoin was on it.
00:15:16.030 - 00:15:31.238, Speaker A: And obviously bitcoin. Sorry? Yeah, bitcoin. And this was shilled back in. This started in November of 22, someone tweeted. October of 22, someone tweeted this out. I saw the tweet. And the ticker, which is the kicker here, is bitcoin.
00:15:31.238 - 00:15:38.866, Speaker A: So it's a dollar sign. Bitcoin. And the beauty behind this is that people cannot afford to buy whole bitcoin. Right?
00:15:38.930 - 00:15:40.374, Speaker B: Ah, okay.
00:15:40.674 - 00:15:45.162, Speaker A: So it's the. The common man's bitcoin is the thesis there.
00:15:45.218 - 00:15:46.282, Speaker B: The poor man's bitcoin.
00:15:46.378 - 00:16:02.520, Speaker A: The poor man's bitcoin. And, I mean, if you think about. There's two other things that I thought about, which I thought this meme was pretty funny. One is like, imagine if it was on the news and someone had to say that whole thing. Hilarious. Hilarious.
00:16:02.632 - 00:16:06.444, Speaker B: Imagine Jim Cramer shilling this or shorting it.
00:16:07.024 - 00:16:12.824, Speaker A: Just the very nature of how absurd this is, is the alpha. Do you know what I mean?
00:16:12.904 - 00:16:13.524, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:16:14.264 - 00:16:30.664, Speaker A: And then also, if you think about it, it's going to force centralized exchanges to list bitcoin as the ticker to this coin. Yeah. So you see, there's some interesting elements there that I could see take off. That will make it a very strong meme.
00:16:30.744 - 00:16:41.480, Speaker B: So. So the, you said. You said earlier that the harder it makes you laugh, the more you want to apen. Uh, so that leads to bald. So I actually saw. So.
00:16:41.512 - 00:16:43.456, Speaker A: Oh, yes, I bought bald, too.
00:16:43.520 - 00:17:17.026, Speaker B: Yeah. So bald is another one that you and I both apt into. Uh, and it's really, really funny because there was, I mean, the first time I came across it was a tweet where, like, it showed, like, some of the most famous bald entrepreneurs in the modern era. So it was Jeff Bezos. So for each one of them, there's two pictures. There's the before and after. So for Jeff Bezos, before, not bald, not rich, after bald and rich, and then Brian Armstrong, before, not bald, not rich, after bald and rich.
00:17:17.026 - 00:17:32.458, Speaker B: And same thing for Elon and others. So when I saw that, I just decided to ape into it. But I aped into it on, like, Monday, Monday morning. You did it on Saturday night. Were you not supposed to hang out with your family?
00:17:32.586 - 00:17:47.964, Speaker A: You know, when I see a very good meme and I laugh. Well, let me tell you this. This is the beauty behind uniswap wallet. So I have a wallet that's mobile. And, you know, if I see something really funny, I ape in right away.
00:17:48.074 - 00:17:58.912, Speaker B: So you end up on Saturday night at a FDV of 20. I saw the whole thing. I didn't, I didn't pay attention to my telegram or Twitter the whole weekend. So Monday morning I woke up, I.
00:17:58.928 - 00:18:03.524, Speaker A: Saw this thing and it was almost at 90 million.
00:18:03.864 - 00:18:04.792, Speaker B: Almost 90 million?
00:18:04.888 - 00:18:05.280, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:18:05.352 - 00:18:19.694, Speaker B: So I felt a lot of fomo. But then I saw, like, I don't know, like, I ate, like, I woke up, it was like 90 or something. And then I was like, I'm gonna have lunch. Breakfast. So I ate breakfast. Like, after that, it was. You went another, like 200%.
00:18:19.694 - 00:19:06.634, Speaker B: Like, fuck, what am I going to do? All right, I'm going to ape into Toshi and what's the other one? The lead swap is a super. I think on hindsight is probably a mid curve trade. Like, my thinking was, okay, if there's all these new meme coins on. Oh, by the way, so all these meme coins that we heard about and aped into that weekend was on baze, which is the layer two that coinbase built. I was like, if there's all these meme coins people are launching, why don't I just ape into the main decentralized exchange on base? That's what I did. I did that and I did bold, and then literally five minutes later, I got rocked on both. Literally.
00:19:06.634 - 00:19:09.756, Speaker B: They pulled the liquidity and then the whole thing just went to zero.
00:19:09.900 - 00:19:16.860, Speaker A: Well, I mean, I got rugged on bald. I mean, it went literal. It went to a million dollar market cap.
00:19:17.052 - 00:19:43.914, Speaker B: And by the way, this whole thing, like, this whole experience that we had last weekend was exactly what cl said on Twitter about how this retard summer reminds him of Defi Summer. Because in Defi summer, this is exactly what happened. If you don't look at your telegram or Twitter for two days, you're going to miss out on like, 10,000 gains. And then, you know, the moment you a pin, you get rocked. So that's. And that happens, like, literally every day during Defi summer.
00:19:43.994 - 00:20:01.610, Speaker A: Yeah. And I'd say, like, there's a lot of partly. This is nostalgic for us, right? Because Defi Summer was such a magical experience. I don't think I could, we could ever see something as magical. I hope we do.
00:20:01.722 - 00:20:25.358, Speaker B: I think if you missed Defi Summer, if you didn't ape into anything into, if you didn't participate in Defi Summer, you don't understand why, how magical crypto is. It's as simple as that. I think the next best thing is the NFT seasons, but Defi Summer happening first. So that was the first magical moment in the entire. I think for me, it's the most magical moment in the entire history of crypto. I'll explain that later.
00:20:25.406 - 00:20:29.678, Speaker A: But you mean explain Defi Summer?
00:20:29.766 - 00:20:31.134, Speaker B: Do you want me to explain Defi Summer?
00:20:31.214 - 00:20:34.790, Speaker A: I think we should for. For listeners that haven't experienced Defi Summer.
00:20:34.902 - 00:21:11.294, Speaker B: So Defi Summer was a short bull market in the last bear market, and the bull market only happened to the defi coins. And there were a lot of interesting experiences. For example, there's these coins called the pickles and yam. You farm pickles, and you stake it to farm yam. And then you put yam into, like, uniswap to earn some yield. And then you swap that into ETH, and then you put it into yarn, and you earn yield off of, like, all that, like, super weird, super fluid token. Exactly.
00:21:11.294 - 00:21:11.902, Speaker B: All that stuff.
00:21:11.958 - 00:21:12.294, Speaker A: Bottle.
00:21:12.334 - 00:21:50.204, Speaker B: Yeah. But there were two really magical things about Defi Summer. The first is that for the first time, people realized how great of a user experience it was to be able to access multiple products from one wallet. That seamless experience is really, really incredible. And on top of that, you can access all these different products without permission. And what that means is, without having to go through KYC, without having to get permission from the centralized exchange to withdraw your money, all that stuff, the user experience was incredible. That was the first magical thing.
00:21:50.204 - 00:22:32.674, Speaker B: And the second magical thing is that was the first time people really experienced composability in crypto. So all that stuff that I mentioned, like the compose, like all these, like, super weird things that you can do by combining pickles and yam and uniswap and yarn and aave compound all these things, that was the first time people really experienced compulsability. So for me, these were the two most magical things about DeFi Summer. And the compulsability part, arguably, we didn't experience that in nfts. We did experience the first magical thing, which is the accessing, like trading nfts from one account seamlessly without a permission. We experience the first thing, but not the second thing with nfts.
00:22:33.214 - 00:23:19.682, Speaker A: And a couple additional points that I experienced, which I thought was interesting. One is using tokens as a way to incentivize a certain type of behavior. And so we call this now liquidity mining or farming. And two is accessing real world products without having to go through ten to 20 different steps. An example of this is taking a loan out against your mortgage. The process is cumbersome, and it takes, I don't know, six months, three to six months, if someone wants to do that. And for DeFi summer, it was the first time where people were able to literally collateralize their ETH and borrow against it.
00:23:19.682 - 00:23:37.882, Speaker A: And towards the end of, like the NFT craze, you had NFT lending platforms where you could lend against your, you could borrow against your nfts, which I thought, I mean, after using the first DeFi product I used was Ethel, and which is now Aave. I mean, everything just made so much sense.
00:23:38.058 - 00:23:56.950, Speaker B: By the way, what you just said, there is exactly what Michael, the founder curve did. So he collateralized CRV, put it into Aave and other like Fraxeland and other lending platforms, and borrowed probably some stablecoin, and then bought a giant mansion in Australia.
00:23:57.062 - 00:23:59.518, Speaker A: I think he bought two mansions for 40,000,002 mansions.
00:23:59.566 - 00:24:15.324, Speaker B: That's right. So anyway, that's just, without commenting on the whole curve situation, that's just an illustration of what you just mentioned about the frictionless Defi financial products.
00:24:15.824 - 00:24:45.384, Speaker A: And so Defi was just, I think, instrumental into thinking about how other sectors could take off. And I think a lot of the focus now is financializing nfts as an example. So we're starting to see Defi and all the things that have happened over the past few years now those resources are putting into, which is why we're starting to see more and more speculative types of products. Right. So you're seeing blend with blur. There are a couple other lending products like bendao and et cetera, that are taking off.
00:24:45.464 - 00:25:10.768, Speaker B: So, sorry, back to bolt, because it's too fun. Yeah, bold and bayes, you know, all that stuff. There was an interesting lesson, which we've learned a long time ago, but just worth reiterating, which is that based this new layer two, however unproven it was, it gathered over, I think, $80 million.
00:25:10.816 - 00:25:13.976, Speaker A: 80 million in TVL in 24 hours.
00:25:14.080 - 00:25:37.088, Speaker B: In 24 hours. And that number was higher than the vast, vast majority of layer twos and alt at once. And all that was thanks to speculation. All that was thanks to one meme coin, which is bald. And this guy who tweeted that he turned $500 into $5 million. Oh, it was five or something to that effect.
00:25:37.216 - 00:25:38.604, Speaker A: He got wrecked, by the way.
00:25:38.904 - 00:25:39.856, Speaker B: Yeah, he got wrecked.
00:25:39.920 - 00:25:40.096, Speaker A: But.
00:25:40.120 - 00:26:05.470, Speaker B: But that kind of story is what attracts retail traders into a new ecosystem. Like when they hear, oh, there's this guy who made this much money by putting only dollar 500, I want to ape in two. And that's exactly what happened. People aped into anything, myself included into anything that happened on base over the weekend, despite the fact that there was not even a UI for the bridging right. You remember, like, can we talk about.
00:26:05.502 - 00:26:22.166, Speaker A: How crazy that is? I mean, there was a tweet by the ball deployer that said, hey, if you want to bridge, use this ethereum address, put your money here, and, you know, you'll have money on base. I mean, think about $80 million going through just that tweet.
00:26:22.230 - 00:26:29.464, Speaker B: Well, to be fair, to be fair, Coinbase actually has their document. They do official documentation where they list the same thing, the same address.
00:26:29.614 - 00:26:33.140, Speaker A: How many people do you think crosstrek that? That's the question.
00:26:33.252 - 00:26:57.884, Speaker B: But it's crazy though, because I think that was the only time I've ever bridged without a UI same. And it was unproven. It was definitely unproven. The whole protocol was unproven. And yet it attracted $80 million in Tbl. So speculation and meme coins and Defi and airdrops as a way to bootstrap a new ecosystem has been proving to be really effective.
00:26:57.964 - 00:27:18.156, Speaker A: Yeah. Arbitrum, when they first launched, went through similar issues as base. They had a meme coin that went up to a billion dollars. I think it was called Nyan and it went to a billion. Now it's at zero or whatever. There was other products that ended up rugging people. It's happening on Zksync as well.
00:27:18.156 - 00:27:45.286, Speaker A: There was three or four products back to back, all rugged. They're all like lending product rugged between three to $5 million. So it seems like there's an interesting dynamic here. When a new layer two launches, you have people that are opportunistic. They're taking advantage of people that want to make incredible amounts of money and some get out of it and do really well. But most, I feel like, ended up getting rugged.
00:27:45.390 - 00:27:51.032, Speaker B: The other really popular narrative in the last couple of weeks was unibot.
00:27:51.118 - 00:27:51.500, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:27:51.572 - 00:27:53.740, Speaker B: And do you want to talk about it?
00:27:53.812 - 00:28:07.664, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, Unibod has been around for, I think, six months now. Six to eight months. And the idea is very simple. It's a telegram bot that will manage your private key for you. How secure is that?
00:28:08.004 - 00:28:10.252, Speaker B: More importantly, how legal is that?
00:28:10.388 - 00:28:31.046, Speaker A: How legal? Yeah. It could be considered as a money transmitter. Transmitter license or. Yeah. So MTL, MSB, and so telegram manages your, or the software manages your private key. You deposit money into it and it allows you to automate trades. So an example of this is if someone shares a Unibot link.
00:28:31.046 - 00:28:55.394, Speaker A: Right. And that link is a link to purchase any asset. You click it, it'll automatically purchase it for you. So if you think, like, from a larger or more broad scale, you could see thousands, hundreds of thousands of people in a group chat, and someone can share a link and say, hey, I'm buying this token. And he shares a link and everyone else clicks the link. It automatically executes the trade for everyone. And everyone just apes in automatically.
00:28:55.394 - 00:29:40.904, Speaker A: It's crazy. And now they have referral links, right? And referral links gives the main person that introduced the asset to their audience. They get 5% cut plus on the money that is transacted through that referral link. So it kind of automates referral copy trading because I know a lot of exchanges tried copy trading. There are a lot of dapps that we've talked to that tried to automate copy trading, but it never worked. But in this case, it could work. And in fact, there's a stat that came out recently that said 97% of people that trade lose money on average, but it turns out 35% people that use unibot are making money.
00:29:40.904 - 00:29:53.352, Speaker A: It's an interesting dynamic there. But, but now if you think about, if you think about it from a broad scale now, there's like shitcoins that are being deployed. Probably like thousands of shitcoins are deployed every day now.
00:29:53.448 - 00:29:55.464, Speaker B: And I'll give you some stats.
00:29:55.544 - 00:29:57.024, Speaker A: Yeah, I'd love to hear some stats.
00:29:57.104 - 00:30:21.758, Speaker B: So, okay, so Unibot, I'll start with some stats, and I'll share some things I learned. So the unibot, last I checked, was making 70 million annualized annual recurrent revenue. Well, I don't know how recurrent it is, but annualized is 70 million. And that's basically more money than pretty much every crypto product except for GMX.
00:30:21.926 - 00:30:22.674, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:30:23.254 - 00:30:49.144, Speaker B: So that's crazy. And the way they do that is, well, all these social trading stuff on telegram, that's super fun. But also they charge 5% per trade, so 10% round trip on every trade. So that's even crazier than all the NFT marketplaces used to charge. And even at that price point, people are willing to ape using Unibot. So that's an interesting stat. But I'll share the things I learned.
00:30:49.144 - 00:31:11.038, Speaker B: The first thing is I'll actually just quote one of the founders I spoke with. So it's Mike from define. So he showed me, define is like on chain crypto data product. He showed me a data feed of all the shitcoins that are being created in real time.
00:31:11.166 - 00:31:11.494, Speaker A: Okay.
00:31:11.534 - 00:31:26.222, Speaker B: So I saw that tweet. I saw that feed in real time. And basically, on average, there's one shitcoin being created on chain per minute, not per day, per minute, every minute there's a new shitcoin that's being launched on chain. That's really crazy.
00:31:26.318 - 00:31:27.086, Speaker A: That's insane.
00:31:27.190 - 00:31:37.130, Speaker B: And he says something to the effect of uh, yes, we are in a bear market, but shitcoin trading has always been in a bull market.
00:31:37.242 - 00:31:37.658, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:31:37.746 - 00:32:25.616, Speaker B: The number of shitcoins that are being launched on chain has been increasing uh, steadily over the last three years since Defi summer. And so that, that's why Unibod has seen the success it has seen, which is to allow people to ape into these new shitcoins that are being launched. So that's the first thing. It's the shit one bull market that the, the primary, like the, so okay, if you look at the shitcoin secondary market, like if you look at Coingecko and all that stuff, it seems like the vast majority of all are in the bear market. But if you focus on the shitcoins that are launched, that are just launched and the number of people who ape into these shitcoins, I almost categorize this as the primary market because like you aping right after it is launched. So this market has been booming and that's what led to the success or the traction of Unibod and others so far.
00:32:25.720 - 00:33:19.044, Speaker A: So if you think about like what's happening in the space generally, all of this liquidity is being concentrated, right? So Unibot is concentrating liquidity and is directing flows based on where influencers think are, is going to give them the next thousand, 10,000 x. And you could think of this as like a social coordination, right, between all of these like people that have very strong network effects of, of shitcoin traders. Um, and look, I, I'm not uh, I don't know where the alpha is in regards to what next coin is going to, you know, pump or dump or whatever you want to call it, but these influencers do. And so what these influencers are doing now is they're creating their own telegram chats, they're inviting people, it's private. And now they're sharing uh, links, uh, and essentially like coordinating with others. And I've seen this happen with other groups into these types of uh, opportunities. And one that I could talk about is like toshi.
00:33:19.044 - 00:33:40.444, Speaker A: Toshi is like definitely coordinated across all the influencers because of old, um, and so I think that's just an interesting element there. The second element is now. It's a now that people can enter into trades very, very quickly. The next big worry for most of these people are like, when do you exit and because all these tokens, what we've seen now is kind of like an up then down.
00:33:40.524 - 00:34:11.041, Speaker B: So to your second point, uh, this, this was the next thing I learned. So you have to really try the product. You have to really try uniswap or unibot to really appreciate this. But the user experience of unibot is actually really seamless. So when you try to do the same thing with metamask and uniswap, for example, that experience has not changed since defy summer. And that's extremely cumbersome. Like all the whole signing transactions, all that stuff is really cumbersome.
00:34:11.041 - 00:34:52.747, Speaker B: It's cumbersome for me as a crypto native. Imagine how cumbersome it's got to be for the long tail of crypto traders. But with Unibot it basically offers you a centralized exchange experience. You don't need to sign transactions, you just click on a button within Telegram or click on the link and boom, you get the tokens in your account. And on top of that you don't need to KYC and all that stuff. By the way, that's the probably the not legal part. But to just illustrate the point, Unibot offers the best of both C five and DeFi worlds, which is the not Ky, the permissionless part, as well as the better experience part.
00:34:52.747 - 00:35:41.372, Speaker B: And this really led me to think about account abstraction. Like, I actually haven't fully appreciated account abstraction before I tried unibody and aped into all these three coins. Yeah, the hope is that account abstraction will be able to offer a centralized exchange like experience for users. And also, as a side note, it seems like account abstraction is not the only thing that can enable this experience. There are some recent developments in NPC that can offer us very similar experience. By that experience I mean specifically pre signed transactions in such a way that whenever you just make a new trade, you may need to sign transactions anymore. So that experience is, I think for now, has been really underappreciated, at least for me personally.
00:35:41.372 - 00:35:43.916, Speaker B: I didn't appreciate this until I actually tried the product.
00:35:44.020 - 00:36:02.680, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it goes back to the thesis, which is I think the biggest problem with crypto today is managing your private keys and the wallet experience that needs to be abstracted away in such a way that you're interacting with products that are similar to like web two products. I feel like Unibot is like a great example of that.
00:36:02.752 - 00:36:17.680, Speaker B: I also want to add a side note to all of this, which is that I noticed that the traders who do this type of trade that you know that ape into like newly launched shitcoins, they're not on Coingecko or Coinmarketcap, they're on Dex screener.
00:36:17.752 - 00:36:18.144, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:36:18.224 - 00:36:24.304, Speaker B: And that is because when the tokens are listed on Coingecko, it's too late. It's too late for the trade.
00:36:24.424 - 00:36:30.556, Speaker A: Well, I will say it's Gecko Terminal is the competitor to Dexcreener.
00:36:30.660 - 00:36:34.076, Speaker B: I've not used it. Yeah, it's good. Is it an app?
00:36:34.140 - 00:36:47.956, Speaker A: Yeah, they don't have it. I don't think they have an app yet. But Gecko Terminal gives you a very seamless experience that's similar to greener. I don't think there's an iPhone app for it, but if you're using desktop, it's there. Okay. But it's a good experience overall.
00:36:48.020 - 00:37:30.130, Speaker B: The point I wanted to point out is despite trading being a core activity that crypto users have been used to or have been using since Defi summer or maybe earlier than that for many years, there's always these new types of behaviors that enable new products to emerge and to compete with incumbents. So what led to the rise of Dexcreener, I think, is really the fact that what I said earlier about how shitcoins have always been in a bull market, this thing itself is what led to the need for a product like Dexcreener and others. But anyway, so that's what I learned about Unibot.
00:37:30.202 - 00:38:30.852, Speaker A: Yeah, I think Unibot overall is going to be an interesting phenomenon because it was launched when I think it was in parallel to ECC. And there was an interesting argument that was made on Twitter that talked about everyone has spent so much time in research and debating, you know, different elements of modularity, thesis or layer one, layer two, sequencing all of these buzzwords that people hear that are the average person and they get turned off by it. And so you have this other community that's being kind of like brewing, and it's brewing primarily because they just want to use that thing and speculate. And it was just, I just thought it was so interesting that both of those kind of emerged at the same time, which is like, you know, this incredibly, like, technical group, research groups that are talking about and pushing the blend of the thesis that mentioned. And then you have like people that are aping into like Harry Potter, Obama, Sonic ten, Inu. So interesting. And these groups don't know each other.
00:38:30.852 - 00:39:16.294, Speaker A: That's the interesting piece. And I think that's primarily there was an article that was written by Nick Grossman from USV. And I'll just summarize it. I'll just summarize it pretty easily, which is like, there's an, obviously an over concentration of people that are focusing on infrastructure, but apps, there's going to be a trend, right? Meaning that infrastructure is always going to be focused on, but apps are just going to get better and proliferate better month after month, year after year, because the infrastructure is being built out. And the thing in crypto is that they don't understand each other. So apps are being built that maybe people that are in the infrastructure side don't really understand, and apps that are being built that or, sorry, infrastructure, people that don't really understand the apps that are being built. So I just thought that was a very interesting element there.
00:39:16.454 - 00:39:27.774, Speaker B: And relatedly, the. Everyone at the ECC, you know, basically the crypto elite, wants a decentralized web, whereas the real users just want a shitcoin casino.
00:39:27.854 - 00:39:43.242, Speaker A: You know what's funny? Every layer one, layer two that is built. Now, their main focus is to get first DeFi on there and get speculation on there. Once you have speculation, then you can start to build out nfts and all the other stuff that's happening. But it has to start somewhere, and it's speculation.
00:39:43.378 - 00:40:14.514, Speaker B: So everything we've talked about so far is about meme coins, shitcoins, all that stuff. But there's another broad category of speculation in crypto, which is gambling. And that's, by the way, how I got into crypto when my bank froze my money. Yeah, a while ago. I think that second category of online casino gambling, all that stuff, is also really, really interesting. And I would argue that the whole thing started with augur. Do you want to talk about the sort of the history of Auger?
00:40:14.594 - 00:40:21.874, Speaker A: Well, it actually started. Did you know the first app on Ethereum was ethereal? Which. Ethereal.
00:40:21.914 - 00:40:22.394, Speaker B: That's right.
00:40:22.474 - 00:40:23.098, Speaker A: Ethereal.
00:40:23.186 - 00:40:27.370, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, okay, so arguably, really, it started with Satoshi dice.
00:40:27.482 - 00:40:50.922, Speaker A: It started with Satoshi dice. 100%. And, you know, people realized that, you know, at the end of. It was funny when I was. When I. The video that I mentioned, we'll link in our show notes, but this guy that was talking on YouTube, he's like, everyone just wants to speculate about the price of bitcoin. It's annoying, right? And he was talking about price swings in the dollars at the time, but that brought on 10,000 users onto bitcoin to use the app.
00:40:50.922 - 00:41:15.814, Speaker A: Yes. And I'm sure Vitalik saw this, you know, and others saw this, and they're like, well, if we can build a more generalized more expressive, smart contracts, you know, with logic that could be given in a way that could be built, great products can be built around. I'm sure this could happen again. And I think that's one of the reasons why. Ethereal was first started on Ethereum, and it was started by this guy named Jez. Jez who went on to start funfair, which I aped into back in the day.
00:41:15.974 - 00:41:17.174, Speaker B: Who did I. You did?
00:41:17.254 - 00:41:18.958, Speaker A: Nice. Did you do the ICO?
00:41:19.086 - 00:41:23.110, Speaker B: Yes, I did. Like every single one of the icos back in the day.
00:41:23.182 - 00:41:41.786, Speaker A: All right, Alpha back then, for those that didn't go through the ICO boom was as long as Vitalik was the advisor and you'll see his picture, the coin will tend to 100 x.
00:41:41.850 - 00:41:42.614, Speaker B: That's right.
00:41:43.034 - 00:42:25.794, Speaker A: So that was the alpha back then. But yeah, Jez, who founded a very successful gaming studio, who essentially built, I don't know if you remember this, but Starfox on Super Nintendo and Nintendo 64. I played what? Nintendo 64? So I thought that was pretty cool. So he went on to start funfair, but that's kind of how the, you know, essentially gambling started on Ethereum and auger, which is a prediction market started by Joey Krug. Essentially, it's a decentralized prediction market. They focus more on the decentralized side to prevent, you know, regulatory burden, which I think hurt the product in the long run. Maybe if you want to talk about the product, I know you used it.
00:42:25.794 - 00:42:27.706, Speaker A: What were your thoughts about the product when it launched?
00:42:27.770 - 00:43:09.822, Speaker B: I think it was late 2017 or early 2018, can't remember. But when they first launched their first product, like consumer product, not just the protocol, but actual application, it was a really painful experience. So we download the thing and you have to spend like 3 hours syncing with Ethereum blockchain. It was in all that in the name of decentralization, because like, it's like when you run the whole thing really locally from your computer, it's really like self sovereign kind of product. But it was a really painful experience. And obviously the liquidity was really bad. And so ultimately, I think Auger didn't go anywhere.
00:43:09.958 - 00:43:15.422, Speaker A: Yeah, I just remember using it, and I just remember liquidity was the problem for me.
00:43:15.478 - 00:43:38.588, Speaker B: Yeah, but the idea was really obvious. Like, it's still obvious today, I think so. I think it was just too early. I think even today we don't really have a super household name prediction market, crypto prediction market, like there's polymarket, for example, but I don't think they're household name yet. I think the idea was just too early. And at some point, like prediction markets will exist.
00:43:38.676 - 00:44:03.820, Speaker A: Here's a fun, like, thought process, poly market, here's a good one. Every time there's some sort of like cultural event that happens that affects all of Twitter, as an example, or all the sectors are in the space, polymarket always emerges. I always see their screenshot circulating. So there was one around superconductivity. If you remember that it was, you know, most people believed it, that they didn't believe it.
00:44:03.852 - 00:44:05.772, Speaker B: I remember that. That was like literally two days ago.
00:44:05.868 - 00:44:37.346, Speaker A: Yeah. And then you had the AI boom. I remember seeing polymarket up again and then it came back down. So I feel like there's something there with polymarket. I think that regulatory stuff has they passed that now. And if you use a product, it's very simple, right? You just log in, you put in USDC, and then you can bet where you want. So I think partially it's semi centralized, which is why it's so much easier to use than augur, as an example.
00:44:37.450 - 00:44:41.978, Speaker B: By the way, at a side note, do you remember, like people were worried about assassination markets back in the day?
00:44:42.026 - 00:44:42.538, Speaker A: Yes.
00:44:42.666 - 00:45:08.876, Speaker B: So the idea is that you can bet on people being dead and then people would actually try to actively kill that person. So that was like actually one of the biggest worries among the early, I guess, adopters of prediction markets. But obviously today that's, I think there's other risks before that, for example, like the UX risks, the regulatory risks, like all that stuff. But anyway, just a fun thing to mention.
00:45:08.980 - 00:46:16.706, Speaker A: Another side, I guess, interesting side note was there was a bot called chirac that tracked the murders and people would be able to bet on the murder. Yeah, yeah, it was interesting. But outside of that, like the murders, like betting on the murders or whatever, there's an interesting element of like this off chain data, right, that people are seeing and people are able to like use crypto as a way to bet for, against it, which I thought was, was an interesting signal. So there's another one that we forgot to mention, and I know we don't know exactly the background of this firm, so I can't speak for it, but rollbit is another one that has started to gain a lot of traction. I consider this as a centralized platform that offers DGen gambling. So you could do sports betting, you could thousand x long short crypto assets, you could borrow against your nfts. And it seems to me I read a data point summer that they're doing one fifth of all of Binance's perf volume on BTC and ETH, which I thought was.
00:46:16.706 - 00:46:20.334, Speaker A: I don't know if this is substantiated or not, but I thought that was.
00:46:20.744 - 00:46:25.688, Speaker B: They got all the interesting signal in on influencers.
00:46:25.776 - 00:46:29.552, Speaker A: Osaka. Yeah, I think he rescinded his offer.
00:46:29.608 - 00:46:37.440, Speaker B: But Gainesy, a lot of drama. But they got all the influencers to shield them.
00:46:37.512 - 00:46:42.488, Speaker A: Cl's the only one that is against rollbit. One of the influencers that's against rollbit. Yeah.
00:46:42.616 - 00:46:57.922, Speaker B: I don't know anything about them, but somehow some of the people shilling real bit are pretty questionable. Um, anyway, I recently spoke with a founder, and, uh, he told me that 50% of onramp onto Moonpay. Through Moonpay.
00:46:57.938 - 00:46:59.162, Speaker A: Oh, yes, yes.
00:46:59.258 - 00:47:23.338, Speaker B: Goes to this website called the stake.com dot us. And I looked at it. It's a. It's online casino and sports betting and that kind of stuff. For those who don't know, Moonpay is the one, the largest fiat on ramp, off ramp into and from crypto, and 50% of the on ramp goes to this online casino. I haven't verified that number, but it's a really shocking number.
00:47:23.338 - 00:47:36.554, Speaker B: But in hindsight, it's not that surprising that people just. I mean, people just experienced the same thing that I experienced ten years ago, which is they want a uncensorable form of payment to go on, like offshore betting platforms.
00:47:36.634 - 00:48:00.584, Speaker A: I mean, even if you look at, like, the regulatory regime, right. There's so many restrictions in place for anyone to gamble. Right. And the ability to do it online, uncensorable, you don't have to worry about regulatory hindrances. And making it easy for anyone to gamble is, I think, where the value is for most people. Like, even in the states, you have to be a certain age. Only certain states offer it.
00:48:00.584 - 00:48:25.726, Speaker A: An example of this is Illinois just started off for gambling four or five years ago. I'm not sure exactly how many years, but it was, like, five or ten years. But before then, Illinois was gamble free or casino free. And so I do think there is something there from a regulatory perspective. And then also, like, you know, doing something online is just so much easier, especially if you use crypto versus, like, traditional fiat on ramps.
00:48:25.830 - 00:48:30.318, Speaker B: By the way, Illinois was gamble free. Are you sure? I used to go to horseshoe.
00:48:30.406 - 00:48:31.294, Speaker A: That's in Indiana.
00:48:31.374 - 00:48:32.142, Speaker B: Oh, is that right?
00:48:32.238 - 00:48:32.614, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:48:32.694 - 00:48:34.374, Speaker B: Ah, okay. That's why.
00:48:34.454 - 00:48:49.592, Speaker A: So, I think it was ten years ago, the first casino that opened up in Illinois was riverside. I forgot. But it's in Rosemont. That was the first casino that opened up. But, yeah, horseshoe and others were all like border Indiana. And so people would drive to Indiana just to gamble.
00:48:49.688 - 00:49:09.844, Speaker B: That's right. Another stat I want to share. So I did some quick research on the size of global gambling market, online gambling. And there's various estimates, but the estimates range between $100 billion to half a trillion dollars in annual revenue, not in market cap annual revenue.
00:49:09.964 - 00:49:10.740, Speaker A: That's insane.
00:49:10.852 - 00:49:50.916, Speaker B: And that includes like sports betting, the traditional casinos. Like by casinos, I mean like blackjack and, you know, that kind of game, like satoshi dice kind of games, right. And also like stuff like binary options. Like those are like super, super big markets that people don't really talk about. And for me, there's just a really obvious opportunity for, for crypto to disrupt those markets. Just speaking from personal experience, one of the biggest things that the users of those platforms experience, aside from like their money being frozen by the bank, is also like, for example, when you make too much money on a sports betting platform, they will ban you. They don't want anyone, anyone to make too much money, but they will deplatform you.
00:49:50.916 - 00:49:58.982, Speaker B: For example, they will sometimes they even freeze their money. And so a uncensorable platform for that kind of activities to me is a really obvious idea.
00:49:59.078 - 00:50:44.522, Speaker A: And there is an element of the house playing against you, right? And the house meaning like the casino playing against you. And there isn't a transparent way for the users or the people that are playing against the house to know whether or not it's done fairly. And so crypto is the perfect technical infrastructure that provides users and the house with provably fair gaming mechanics. Yeah. And an example of this is like Satoshi dice. The way you would randomly generate its numbers is based on the hash, right? And so it'll use the hash and say, like, ok, this is the number. Now are you over under as an example? And then you have random generated numbers that's designed by Chainlink with VDF's, et cetera.
00:50:44.522 - 00:50:59.492, Speaker A: And I do think that crypto makes it much more plausible to play a game and knowing that it's fair. Yep. So not only the uncensorable side, but then also like the gaming mechanics and logic of the game in itself, which I think is appealing for a lot of users.
00:50:59.548 - 00:51:22.044, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, people have been talking about these two ideas for a long time, like for at least ten years. Like, none of these ideas is new, right? Like all these things, people are talking about them on like bitcointalk.org, like twelve years ago, but I think they were just too early. Like the fact that we haven't seen anything that works is just, we were too early, but with all the scaling, all that stuff, we could be ready.
00:51:22.124 - 00:51:36.944, Speaker A: I feel like everything that we just talked about today has been tried on bitcoin, colored coins, gambling, nfts. And we're talking about colored coins as launching shitcoins and real world assets. Nfts.
00:51:38.844 - 00:51:41.380, Speaker B: DeFi is too complicated for bitcoin, I think.
00:51:41.452 - 00:51:44.702, Speaker A: Defi, um, well, I mean, like, bitcoin.
00:51:44.718 - 00:51:46.262, Speaker B: Doesn'T have the smart contract capability.
00:51:46.398 - 00:52:11.164, Speaker A: It doesn't. But, you know, you've seen some elements of it, like with colored coin trading, like, you know, exchanges. Right. But lending and borrowing, I don't remember seeing any of that. No, but you've seen like, exchanges that could trade colored coin, maybe early instance of it, not full. So, yeah, I guess, all in all, I guess we're in agreement, which is okay. Every sector has a superpower.
00:52:11.164 - 00:52:21.664, Speaker A: Healthcare is about saving lives. If you look at the movie industry, it's about telling a very compelling story for crypto. What is that? Is it speculation?
00:52:21.824 - 00:52:40.976, Speaker B: I mean, for now, yes. The number one thing is speculation. Number two thing for me is entertainment. Like Obama, Sonic, Harry Potter, bald, all these meme coins, that's like all these people doing social trading, telegram sending memes around, and then people talking about them on Twitter. That's entertainment for me. So for now, these are the most, the two most important things could change in the future.
00:52:41.080 - 00:53:32.798, Speaker A: Why is it speculation, though? Like, and I'm just, you know, spitballing here with you, but is it because users are in control of their assets? Meaning, like, if you look at, like, even before crypto or halfway before crypto, most people wouldn't invest their own money, right. They would have fidelity in these brokerage accounts and Robo advisor, whatever you want to call it, they would just buy, or they would allow their four hundred one k to do, to do the work. There wasn't really a control of what they should buy or not buy. I feel like this phenomena changed recently with the launch of Robinhood, and I think more so is with crypto. And I think Crypto and Robin Hood kind of came at the same time. Right. But I feel like there's something there, which is people are now more, more in control of their assets, and because of that, they can direct it into anywhere they want.
00:53:32.798 - 00:53:41.398, Speaker A: And with the Internet and with network effects like Reddit and Twitter, people are using this as a way to persuade others to purchase the asset.
00:53:41.486 - 00:54:14.534, Speaker B: I see your point, but I think it's something similar than that, probably is that Crypto is just a lot more volatile than traditional markets. And people love that. The reason why Robinhood really took off is because people trade options on top of single stocks and they can leverage, like, ten times in crypto with the kind of volatility that we have, especially on the shitcoins. It's basically like leveraging up ten x just from the volatility, and then you can leverage another ten to 100 x from the perps. So people love the possibility of investing only $500 and make a million dollars.
00:54:14.654 - 00:54:35.890, Speaker A: Well, I mean, I agree with you. I'm not. I 100% agree that, like, you know, it's the liquidity volatility of these assets that makes it much more fun to speculate. But, I mean, from a broader perspective, you saw AMC and GameStop, right? Ten years ago, this would have never happened. Right. I do think it is two parallels. One is what you're saying.
00:54:35.890 - 00:55:11.254, Speaker A: You have the launch of shitcoins, illiquidity of the assets, and how volatile they are, and it's essentially like perps. But then in the other parallel is like, you have users that are becoming more in control of their assets, and with the launch of Robinhood, and it forced fidelity and others to pivot to some sort of model that's similar coinbase, others. So you could buy these coins and then you could figure out where you want to buy your next coin. As an example, here's, like, a perfect example. There are people that. That I've talked to, retail folks, that used to ask me, hey, what? You know, like, I heard about this crypto thing. I want to buy it.
00:55:11.254 - 00:55:28.990, Speaker A: And I'm like, do your own research. Don't. Don't ask me because I give really bad advice. Go ape into bald. But what happens is, like, they, they go out and they buy and they learn, and then they learn and learn and learn to the point where now they're telling me what to buy.
00:55:29.102 - 00:55:56.250, Speaker B: No, but what you said there is, it's actually the opposite of what you said earlier. Like, people need advice from others to trade. And crypto, people like, crypto is. The crypto generation is a lot younger, right, than the fidelity generation. And the crypto generation, they are very used to social media. They spend a lot of time on telegram. And that's exactly why unibod took off, because one person sends that link everyone else apes in, because there's this influencer who shares this link that he aped into.
00:55:56.250 - 00:55:57.866, Speaker B: Therefore I copy trade him.
00:55:57.970 - 00:56:39.908, Speaker A: So I'm not arguing against that. What I'm arguing is that I think because now users are controlling their assets versus allowing centralized institutions to control their assets in the way they should direct the investment of that asset is what I'm saying. And I think now that more and more people are in control of their own assets, they can invest in whatever they want. And what they end up doing is, and this is going back to CL's point, is that they'll just see whatever's on their feet and they'll just ape in. And that's what's kind of like creating these markets on these shitcoins outside of what's happening on the macro side. So, yeah, I think, I think that's it. I think we covered a lot on the speculative nature of crypto.
00:56:39.908 - 00:56:41.172, Speaker A: Anything else that you want to add?
00:56:41.268 - 00:56:53.184, Speaker B: I feel like sometimes I read investment thesis by some of the VC's. I don't know if they're doing that on purpose, trying to look smarter or whatever. They're overcomplicating things.
00:56:54.404 - 00:56:56.268, Speaker A: Give me an example. I need an example.
00:56:56.356 - 00:56:57.628, Speaker B: Okay. I'm not going to.
00:56:57.756 - 00:56:58.924, Speaker A: You don't have to name names.
00:56:59.044 - 00:57:19.454, Speaker B: I'll just use a hypothetical example of Zora, for example. What would you say is the thesis behind Zora? Like, if you were a VC, like, picture yourself in the shoes of a VC. What kind of investment thesis? Or would you investment memo? Would you write to your LP's? Are you going to talk about speculation? No, you're not going to talk about speculation, right. What would you say to your LP's?
00:57:19.794 - 00:57:22.554, Speaker A: If I. Crypto is the future of culture.
00:57:22.594 - 00:57:23.578, Speaker B: Like that kind of stuff, right?
00:57:23.626 - 00:57:37.872, Speaker A: Yeah, crypto is the future of culture. People, you know, art hasn't been monetized yet, and the reach is very hard for artists. And, you know, by creating some sort of layer two minting platform, they can be users. Yeah.
00:57:37.968 - 00:57:52.232, Speaker B: But in reality, what's happening to opensea or blur or Zora, like all these NFT marketplaces, is it, is it really because, like, they succeeded really because it's the future of culture or is it because most people just want to make money?
00:57:52.328 - 00:58:24.212, Speaker A: Everyone wants to make money. There's no reason why anyone would. I mean, obviously there's an art appreciation, right? 100%. Like, I mean, some of the art blocks, art block collections that I love, like fidenzas, ringers, emilys, art and a couple others, memories of killen, beautiful art. But in the back of my mind, I know that if I hold this long enough that ill be able to, youll be able to make money. Right. And so speculation is 100%, I think, part of collecting all of these types of assets.
00:58:24.348 - 00:58:46.262, Speaker B: Yes. So thats exactly my point. Always an element of both the speculation and the actual collection, like the love for the art. But I think yeah, for the most part, like over 50% of what really drives the success behind NFTs and all the NFT related products, at least at the moment, is speculation, is the possibility of making a lot of money.
00:58:46.358 - 00:58:48.254, Speaker A: Okay, so where are you going with this?
00:58:48.334 - 00:59:03.708, Speaker B: Where I'm going is just embrace the reality and stop the bullshit. The reality is the users want to make money. And I don't know if you're, if your builder just offer them that possibility. If your investors. Stop the bullshit. Yeah, I'm not arguing against the culture, the art, all that stuff. Of course it's there.
00:59:03.708 - 00:59:08.540, Speaker B: What I'm saying is I think it's less than 50% of what's, what's really happening today.
00:59:08.652 - 00:59:40.906, Speaker A: Any final thoughts on my side? I would say for founders that are building in the space embrace speculation even though it, some people will say it's, it's bad and it brings out the worst in people. I've, I've heard it all. But if you look at like the history of all of crypto since 2009, why did people buy bitcoin in the first place? They bought it because it was a counter narrative trend. And you can make money and speculate, you know, especially if you had, you know, compared against gold. Right. That was the narrative and still the narrative today.
00:59:40.970 - 00:59:53.790, Speaker B: Like Hal Finney literally said, I don't know the exact quote, but he said something to the effect of bitcoin has a chance to become a trillion dollar asset. So you'll be worth to getting some just in case that bitcoin takes off. He literally said this.
00:59:53.902 - 01:00:06.838, Speaker A: And if for folks that don't know Hal Finney, he was one of the engineers that worked very closely with Satoshi Nakamoto, the founder of bitcoin. Some say that Halifani is Satoshi Nakamoto, but we won't know that.
01:00:06.886 - 01:00:11.678, Speaker B: He was the first person who received bitcoin transaction from Satoshi.
01:00:11.766 - 01:00:54.758, Speaker A: And I think that once people embrace this and once the industry embraces this, I think we could see a melting pot between the technical group side, the NFT community side, the speculative trading side, because all of these groups, they don't talk to each other, they don't like each other. They think one thinks they're too good for this community, the other community thinks that they're too up on a pedestal. I won't name names, but this is what's happening in our dynamics. Once we embrace that, it's all one. I think we can build some killer apps. Agreed. All right, well, this was a fun episode because you and I have been in the space for a decade, and we started out as Degen.
01:00:54.758 - 01:01:11.128, Speaker A: So dgen, being a dgen at heart is always you just see different ideas and products differently versus others that come more from a technical research side. And I think where we're going to see most of the killer apps is going to be on the speculative side. So this was a fun podcast to do.
01:01:11.246 - 01:01:11.868, Speaker B: Likewise.
01:01:11.956 - 01:01:20.004, Speaker A: All right, well, thanks so much for listening. We'll see you again in the next couple of weeks. Thanks. Thanks for listening to good game. Don't forget to subscribe. We'll see you next week.
