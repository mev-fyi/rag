00:00:00.160 - 00:00:41.014, Speaker A: Bitcoin is actually not completely fungible. And this was one of the main criticisms people had against bitcoin in terms of privacy, is that one BTC is actually not one BTC. You can trace every single BTC, every single Satoshi that you own, all the way back to the Coinbase transaction. And the way you calculate your balance is you take all the transactions that come in, you aggregate that, and you subtract all the transactions that go out from that number to get a net balance. But in reality, at the most basic level, the system does not track account balance. It tracks all these individual transactions. And this is the key difference between the bitcoin Utxo system and the Ethereum account system.
00:00:41.014 - 00:00:49.814, Speaker A: This is important because this is what enables ordinals, this is what enables nonfundable tokens as a layer one without a new token standard.
