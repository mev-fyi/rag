00:00:00.250 - 00:00:32.294, Speaker A: Why do I think that ETH are gonna go up after the merge is because ETH has three narratives that institutions absolutely love, and they're gonna pile into ETH after they've gained confidence that the merge has worked. Okay. And the three narratives are number one. The most basic one, meaning ethereum, is a tech platform, whereas bitcoin is a borrowing digital gold. Institutions, after ten years of bull market in tech, they've basically ratted around this new narrative of a tech platform. They love that kind of stuff. That's number one.
00:00:32.294 - 00:00:51.930, Speaker A: Number two is the yield. In a world where real interest rate is negative, where do you get the yield? Right. You get the yield by staking your ETH. Basically, after the merge, ETH becomes a yield generating asset. Now, technically, pedantically, whether or that's true, it's a different story, but that is the meme.
