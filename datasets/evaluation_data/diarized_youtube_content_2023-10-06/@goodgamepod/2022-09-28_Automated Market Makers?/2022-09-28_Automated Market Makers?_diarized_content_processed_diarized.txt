00:00:00.160 - 00:00:35.686, Speaker A: I think there are pros and cons for both Amms and order books. The pro for AMM is that it's much easier to bootstrap liquidity with the AMM model. And that can be attributed to, I think, two reasons. One is that basically, when you launch a pool, you don't need professional market makers to provide liquidity. Right. All you need is to deposit some money into this, this algorithm, and the algorithm will make markets for you automatically recruiting professional market makers is very difficult. Okay.
00:00:35.686 - 00:00:53.614, Speaker A: Like, all these market makers have way too much opportunity cost. They make so much money in other markets, why would they build something bespoke to trade on Amm? Right. That's one problem. The other reason why Amms are better for bootstrapping liquidity is that I think they are cheaper computationally.
