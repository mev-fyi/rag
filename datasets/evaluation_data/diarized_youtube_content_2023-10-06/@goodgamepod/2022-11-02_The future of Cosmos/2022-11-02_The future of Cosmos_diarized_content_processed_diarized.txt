00:00:00.090 - 00:00:54.250, Speaker A: I think what's going to happen in Cosmos in a few years is there's going to be a de facto defi hub or maybe a small handful, like no more than five, maybe one, two, three, and there's going to be a bunch of mature app chains. By the way, Dydx for me is an app. It is not the defi infrite, it's a defi application. So there's going to be Dydx and there's going to be some games, especially on chain games which we can talk about later in future episodes that require a lot of scalability and throughput. There's going to be other consumer products and all these different app chains have their own NFTs and tokens, but they can have their own decentralized exchange. So at some point the users will have to bridge those tokens via IBC into the defi hub, be it osmosis or some other defi hub, and trade it there. I think that's probably what's going to happen to Cosmos.
