00:00:00.080 - 00:00:48.260, Speaker A: If you google the top web, two games, AAA games in the world right now, and you look at their daily active users, they have around 100 million daily active users. So let's assume that each player does 100 actions per day, which to me is a fairly conservative estimate. Like you do all these things, you do all these clicks in the AAA game, I would assume that on average it's way more than 100. But let's assume it's 100 clicks actions per day that are fully on chain. So 100 state changes, 100 transactions per day on chain. So if you do that and you divide that by the number of seconds per day, you're going to get 100,000 transactions per second. So in other words, if you have a fully on chain game that's totally mainstream today, that 100 million people play, it requires 100,000 TPS.
00:00:48.260 - 00:00:58.574, Speaker A: Name one blockchain that can support that today. Just one game? There is none. One game will clog the entire blockchain. That's the issue with fully on chain games today, is that our chains are not scalable enough for that.
