One is manamask, and the other one is an extension that detects scams. But imagine that as a user, it's unusable. Oh my God. Like onboarding. In terms of onboarding, you have to install two different browser extensions instead of one, so that will incur a lot more time.
00:00:24.814 - 00:00:34.754, Speaker A: And two, every time you sign a transaction, you get one pop up from the scan detection extension and another pop up from metamask. Imagine the amount of pain that goes through that.
