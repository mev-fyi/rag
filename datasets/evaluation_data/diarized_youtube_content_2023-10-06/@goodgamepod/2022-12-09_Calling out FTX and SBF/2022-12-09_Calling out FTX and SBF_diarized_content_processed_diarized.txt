00:00:00.240 - 00:00:33.464, Speaker A: When we were preparing for that threat on Twitter, we were debating whether or not we should do it. Just imagine how much we would have lost if we were wrong, right? Like, the downside was not immediately clear to us. That would outweigh the upside for us to call out someone like that before it was popular, before it was consensus against a really powerful player and all their allies. So ultimately, we made the call to do it. And in hindsight, I think we could have been more aggressive. And it was my failure to not have been more aggressive when I first saw the podcast. In fact, I subtweeted Sam several times without you did.
00:00:33.464 - 00:00:44.504, Speaker A: Anyway, the tweets are still out there. But I said something like, we can't let someone who got so astronomically rich within the cycle represent our industry if that person does not believe in crypto.
