00:00:00.200 - 00:00:16.614, Speaker A: Wi Fi or yearn. They had that big bang moment and that is exactly what you want, right? You had thousands of people that were so excited about yearn because yearn was like one of the first, like decentralized yield aggregator that can take capital and use it in ways that other protocols couldn't.
00:00:16.654 - 00:00:17.758, Speaker B: And it was a fair launch.
00:00:17.886 - 00:00:18.582, Speaker A: And it was a fair launch.
00:00:18.598 - 00:00:28.812, Speaker B: It was not VC funded, it was fair launch. There's, you know, a strong, strong leader and building a useful product, at least back in the day.
00:00:28.908 - 00:00:58.434, Speaker A: Yep. And I remember like, I was a part of it, we were a part of it and a lot of talented people. And based on that, I seen how it went from like nothing to being really well governed over a very short period of time. They had their own struggles, don't get me wrong, but it brought in a lot of intellectual capital to help them form endow governance. That worked really well for yearn. So you gotta have that mind share, otherwise you're just gonna have a bunch of speculators that want the price to go up. And typically in the nft communities, that is what will happen.
