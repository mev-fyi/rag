00:00:00.170 - 00:00:46.082, Speaker A: We really want web two style horizontal scalability. We want a system where if you give me a machine with one core I can give you some amount of throughput. If you give me some more cores I can push more throughput. If you give me more machines I can push even more throughput and I can store more data. This is how things work in web two. But web3 platforms don't work this way, or at least most of them don't work this way today and we want to do this also while maintaining socalled atomic composability, the experience variance of a smart contract programmer or a user to be able to touch any piece of the state at once and not have to worry about crosshard communication or write code that deals with two phase commits. We think a lot of the or basically all the value in existing smart contract platforms is to have this abstraction where all of the assets, all of the code, everything is in one place and you can interact with it all at once and atomically.
00:00:46.082 - 00:00:48.530, Speaker A: And so that was the design goal we had in mind with sui.
