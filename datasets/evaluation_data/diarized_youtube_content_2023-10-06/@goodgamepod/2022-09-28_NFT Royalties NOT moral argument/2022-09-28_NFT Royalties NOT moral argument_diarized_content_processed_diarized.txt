00:00:00.120 - 00:00:44.636, Speaker A: I don't think this whole argument should be escalated into a moral one. It's not a moral argument. This whole relative thing is just a contract between the buyer and the seller. It's the contract between the NFT buyer and the NFT creator. As long as it's a contract the outcome will be taken care of by the market. If as a creator you set too high of a royalty fee then maybe your buyers will not play the game and you're not going to be able to make much money off of it. And if you set the royalty too low, yeah, there will be players playing the game but you're not going to be able to make money either, right? So at the end of the day the market will try to find an equilibrium and at the end of the day the market is just a contract between the buyer and the seller.
00:00:44.636 - 00:00:49.884, Speaker A: So it's entirely a pragmatic argument, not a moral argument in my opinion.
