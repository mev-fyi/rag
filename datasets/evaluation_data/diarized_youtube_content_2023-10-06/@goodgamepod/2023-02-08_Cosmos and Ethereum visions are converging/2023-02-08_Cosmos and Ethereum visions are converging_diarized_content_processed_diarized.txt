00:00:00.170 - 00:00:49.010, Speaker A: This idea crossed my mind recently that the Cosmos vision and the Ethereum vision are actually converging. If you think about what's happening on the rollups on Ethereum, I think there is more and more specialization, like with arbitrum launching specific chains for each vertical. But more interestingly, in the future, probably some kind of app specific rollup, right? I mean, Duidx has tried this in the past, and now that Cosmos is doing interchange or shared security, the two visions are almost the same. Now you have Cosmos, where people launch app chains and using the Cosmos hub for shared security, and then you have Ethereum, where people launch app specific rollups and using the Ethereum mainnet for shared security. Right. It's a very interesting convergence of vision, in my opinion.
