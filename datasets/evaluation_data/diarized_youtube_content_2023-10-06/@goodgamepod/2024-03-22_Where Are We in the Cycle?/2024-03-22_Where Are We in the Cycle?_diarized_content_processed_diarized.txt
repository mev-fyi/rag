00:00:00.200 - 00:00:14.806, Speaker B: Where are we in the cycle? Are we still in a four year cycle? Are we in a super cycle? Are we. You're always in the first inning left. We're always. Are we in the left? Translator cycle. Where are we? I'd say we're about halfway through it if I had a guess.
00:00:14.910 - 00:00:15.518, Speaker A: Say it again.
00:00:15.606 - 00:00:27.552, Speaker B: We're halfway through. Halfway through? Yeah, halfway through. I didn't want to hear that. No, but maybe it's a super cycle. Maybe the ETF's just permanently keep us out. I mean, we haven't even had the hamming yet.
00:00:27.678 - 00:00:44.724, Speaker A: Yeah. It's also like, what does it even mean to be a four year cycle anymore? Do I think, like, we'll have rampant fraud like we did last time? Most definitely not. Like, I don't think peak to trough will be like, as bad as it has been in the past, but at the same time, do I think, like, you know, a lot of the quote unquote vc supernova can persist? Probably not.
