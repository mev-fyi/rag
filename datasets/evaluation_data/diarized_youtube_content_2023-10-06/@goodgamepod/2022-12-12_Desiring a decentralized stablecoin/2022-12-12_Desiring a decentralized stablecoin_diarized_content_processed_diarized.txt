00:00:00.160 - 00:00:33.394, Speaker A: One thing I really want. I came across this problem myself yesterday. This pain point was why is there not a decentralized stable point that I can trust and park my crypto there? Because the alternatives right now are putting your money on a centralized exchange or putting your money in a centralized stablecoin, which by the way, also has counterparty risks. Even if you do self custody, there's counterparty risks because the US dollar that's backing the stablecoin, that has counterparty risks. So I would love for us to have a really good decentralized stablecoins in the coming years.
