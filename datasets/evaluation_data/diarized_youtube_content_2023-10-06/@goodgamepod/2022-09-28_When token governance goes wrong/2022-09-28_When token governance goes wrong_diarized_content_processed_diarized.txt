00:00:00.240 - 00:00:36.624, Speaker A: I think this is basically a key issue with token governance, right? Like when everything is going well, when the market is up, only then token governance might be okay. As long as you don't do decision by committee for every single decision out there, token governance might be okay. It might just work out. But when shit hits the fan, you need the traditional legal framework to take care of scenarios like this. And I think this is the issue that people, including myself, have actually brought up many, many years ago about token governance. It does not protect the minority minority rights. When something like this happens, it's always going to be a tyranny of the majority kind of scenario.
