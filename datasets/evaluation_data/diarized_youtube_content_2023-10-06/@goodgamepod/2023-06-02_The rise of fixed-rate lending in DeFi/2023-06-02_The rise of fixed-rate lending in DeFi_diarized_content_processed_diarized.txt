00:00:00.170 - 00:00:38.690, Speaker A: In lending, I've seen the most interesting changes and most interesting disruptions out of all the verticals in DeFi, there's two things. One is that fixed rate lending has really taken off. So fixed rate lending, like notional. The problem that it solves is basically the fact that in the early days, ave compound, they're basically money markets, and therefore their rates basically fluctuate on a continuous basis. So lenders and borrowers, they don't have much certainty in terms of what rate they're going to be getting in the future. So fixed rate lending actually did really well, surprisingly this year, and it's gotten within one order of magnitude from Ave in terms of TVL and lending volume.
