00:00:00.200 - 00:00:09.574, Speaker A: Funny thing about bitcoin is many people who are in this industry today, their gateway drug was Ethereum. Ethereum is what brought this industry into their lives.
00:00:09.694 - 00:00:13.910, Speaker B: Actually, I've been hearing about Solana being the gateway drug and other L2s.
00:00:13.982 - 00:00:19.942, Speaker A: The last I called it was Solana. The 2017 one was Ethereum. For me, it's always been bitcoin.
00:00:20.038 - 00:00:20.782, Speaker B: Yeah, I.
00:00:20.798 - 00:00:39.758, Speaker A: Used to hang out on bitcoin talk and it was really good time. Like, pre 2013 era was really good. Like, people used to talk about dethroning central banks around the world, predating the white paper of Ethereum. My heart has always been with bitcoin, and my brain has been with ethereum, if that analogy makes sense to you.
00:00:39.806 - 00:00:44.358, Speaker B: So is it safe to say that your first girlfriend would be bitcoin and your wife would be ethereum?
00:00:44.406 - 00:00:48.794, Speaker A: I think that's fair to say. That's the right analogy.
00:00:50.414 - 00:00:51.534, Speaker B: Well, we share the same girlfriend.
