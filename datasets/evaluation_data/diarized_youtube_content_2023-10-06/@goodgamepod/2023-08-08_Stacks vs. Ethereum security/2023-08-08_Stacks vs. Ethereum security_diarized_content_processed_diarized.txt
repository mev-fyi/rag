00:00:00.160 - 00:00:29.174, Speaker A: So the key difference, effectively, is that the ethereum definition basically falls down to this key point that if you can move your assets from l one into the l two, and when you're withdrawing it back, you're basically only dependent on Ethereum security. There's no set of keys outside that need to sign something. Then that's a true l two. I actually absolutely agree with that definition, and I think roll ups are sort of like the best example of that. The security is basically the l one security over there.
