00:00:00.120 - 00:00:27.532, Speaker A: I've been dunking on AI crypto for the last couple of months. I felt like it was my duty to do it. But you remember a year ago we actually did a podcast on decentralized AI? I also went on bank list to talk about decentralized AI. The whole idea does make sense to me. Yeah, but what's happening today is it's so easy to raise money. The valuations are being pushed to ridiculous levels easily. Billion dollar valuation without a product.
00:00:27.532 - 00:00:55.384, Speaker A: VC's are fumbling into the sector which in turn attracts a lot of opportunists. Mercenary founders contribute. And again, I wanted to keep an open mind, so I tried a bunch of products. I put together a list of quote unquote top decentralized AI products. I tried all of them and guess what? Most of them didn't work. Can you name any names? I'm not going to name product names, but it takes five minutes to try the product and you'll see what I'm talking about.
