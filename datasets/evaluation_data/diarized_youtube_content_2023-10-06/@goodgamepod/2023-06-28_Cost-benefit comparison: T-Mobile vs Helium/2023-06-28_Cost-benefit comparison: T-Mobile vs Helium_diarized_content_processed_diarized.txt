00:00:00.200 - 00:00:32.314, Speaker A: The cost is pretty insane in terms of like, if you think about what T Mobile offers versus helium, this is just a pure example of like, how much there's a cost benefit to consumers or enterprise. Like an example is like T Mobile offers an eSIM card five gigs for $20, whereas for $20 you can get ten gigs, so you can get double the Internet for the same cost. I just want to throw out an example of how much there is a cost benefit by running a decentralized infrastructure using proof of physical work and how that could be competitive against larger enterprises that you're competing with in the long run.
