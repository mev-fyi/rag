00:00:00.240 - 00:00:48.510, Speaker A: It turns out, like even if you build decentralized software, if you are a founder with a name and the legal jurisdiction, no matter where you live, so as long as it's compliant with american laws and the UN and all of that, then there is a chance that you could be extradited. Right. And so personal liability is actually very important in all of this. The team is actually the weakest layer of the stack. That's right. I guess the question then is like, if you are looking to build decentralized software, do you go out as an a non, or do you figure out a way to become decentralized as soon as possible? I mean the problem with becoming decentralized as soon as possible is that you have to build a company and you have to build a product. There's this whole trilemma effect there, right? And then you have anons which also comes with a lot of issues.
00:00:48.510 - 00:00:57.094, Speaker A: Right? I mean, if you look at all anon soft startups that raise in the past twelve months, I think I'd say about like almost half ended up failing.
