You said the football analogy for me is horse racing, right? Yes. Watch a horse race and then bet on it and then talk shit about each other's horse. But to your point, I love that. I love this combination, because one of the most magical moments I've had, I told you, Marian, about this is so. I'm really obsessed with Jerome Powell. For me, he's just a meme.
00:00:26.186 - 00:00:46.882, Speaker A: Jerome is a meme. I get a lot of memes from him, by the way. Yeah. And I loved him even more yesterday when the comed protests, like, you know that thing, like the protesters, climate protesters. They started protesting in front of Jerome while speaking, and then he's like, close the fucking door. I fucking love that. He literally said it.
00:00:46.882 - 00:00:47.714, Speaker A: Close the fucking door.
