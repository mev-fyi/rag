00:00:00.120 - 00:00:24.886, Speaker A: So, Imran, finally. Yep. Give me your top five NFT collections that you want to hold for the next two to five years. Oh, my God. Two to five autoglyphs, cryptopunks, Azukis artifacts, and I'll throw out two more fidenzas and mebits. So most of them are actually art. Yeah.
00:00:24.886 - 00:00:47.684, Speaker A: I have a high appreciation for art, gender art. Yeah. But I also like some of the PFPs, like cryptopunks, mebits, artifacts, Azukis. I was aboard ape holder in the early days when I first launched. But a lot of stuff they did. Topeka, the bull run. Towards the end, after you heard the Eminem slimmed up rap, you just dumped it.
00:00:47.684 - 00:00:56.744, Speaker A: Rage dumped. That was horrible music video. Horrible. Like, I wanted to throw up.
