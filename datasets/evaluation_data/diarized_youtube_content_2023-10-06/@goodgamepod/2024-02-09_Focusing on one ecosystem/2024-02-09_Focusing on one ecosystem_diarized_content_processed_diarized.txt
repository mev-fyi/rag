00:00:00.160 - 00:00:41.654, Speaker A: A lot of projects, they don't know what to build next. They just deploy the same thing on somewhere else, and they hope that was, like, magically bring or fix all the problems, but that's usually worse. And, I mean, there are these apps who just list, like, oh, we're on 20 different networks, but 99% of them drive zero value. It's just more management, more headache, I think, you know, if you are lucky enough to be the biggest player on one of the biggest chains, you should just, like, focus on that. Our goal now is just, like, we want to be the biggest prep Dex on Ethereum. That's, like, a big enough market for now, and then we can focus on different things adjacent, but we don't want to be the Dex that's on five different chains and just sucks across the board. So, yeah.
