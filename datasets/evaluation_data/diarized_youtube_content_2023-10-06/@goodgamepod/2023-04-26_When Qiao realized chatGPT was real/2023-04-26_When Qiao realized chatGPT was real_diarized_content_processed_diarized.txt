00:00:00.200 - 00:00:37.040, Speaker A: Day three, I managed to get chat GPT to do something interesting for me, asked it for book recommendations and recommendations of Christmas gifts, and then I was like, okay, this thing is actually pretty interesting. It could help me with some stuff in life. And then day seven, I was like, holy shit, this is the real deal. What did I do on day seven? Well, I was writing our request for startups. I asked chat GPT to rewrite things for me, and I realized how powerful it is, especially for people who are not native english speakers like myself. Okay. Whenever I write in English, I have to constantly think about new ways to say the same thing.
00:00:37.040 - 00:00:56.384, Speaker A: I'm always looking for things to or ways to say the same thing in a way that sounds more natural. So I asked chatgpt to do a very simple command, which is rewrite this colon, and I would copy paste the paragraph into it and it would give me something really, really, really good. Like basically, chat TPT helped me rewrite the entire request for startups.
