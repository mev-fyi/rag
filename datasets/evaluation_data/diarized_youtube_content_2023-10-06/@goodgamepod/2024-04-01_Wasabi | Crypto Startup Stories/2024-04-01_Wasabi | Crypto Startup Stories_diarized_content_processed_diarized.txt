00:00:13.846 - 00:00:35.074, Speaker A: Things that don't scale. This is actually something that you guys have been hammering on us. But as a founder, a personal goal of mine is actually to speak to all of my users. If I haven't reached out to you, please reach out to me over Twitter. I want to learn what your feedback is. How do you think we can improve the product and implement those as soon as possible.
00:00:35.234 - 00:00:37.938, Speaker B: And remind our audience what wasabi does?
00:00:38.066 - 00:00:42.818, Speaker A: If you want to long or short any nfts, you can go to Wasabi Xyz.
