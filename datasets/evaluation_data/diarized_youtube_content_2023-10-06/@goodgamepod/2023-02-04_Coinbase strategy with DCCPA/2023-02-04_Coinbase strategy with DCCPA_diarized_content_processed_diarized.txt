00:00:00.200 - 00:00:40.684, Speaker A: Coinbase's strategy is that they support DCCPA, but with some changes. Changes include like, provisions that permits exchanges to self certify that tokens are commodities and gives the CFTC the opportunity but not the obligation to object. Which I think makes a lot of sense, right? Like allowing the exchanges to make the call over CFTC, because CFTC really has no fucking clue what's going on, right? That's one. The other is like they highly praise the Lummis Gillibrand bill, which creates clear regime for web three projects to create commodity tokens. So more helpful for like Coinbase to substantiate listings with regards to SEC, etc. So that's about the coin misses strategy in terms of legal.
