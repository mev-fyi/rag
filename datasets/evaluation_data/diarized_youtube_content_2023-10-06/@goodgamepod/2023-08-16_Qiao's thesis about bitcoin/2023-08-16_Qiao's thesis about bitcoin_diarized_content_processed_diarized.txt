00:00:00.120 - 00:00:39.088, Speaker A: I've always had this thesis about bitcoin. It's probably the first time I'm sharing my thesis about bitcoin is that there will be a smart contract ecosystem on top of bitcoin. That smart contract ecosystem may not be as diverse as Ethereum. It may not do as much as many sets of applications or types of applications as Ethereum does, but there will be one. And it may also just be more semi centralized and ethereum, but there will be one. Just because there's half a trillion dollars worth of bitcoin, or half a trillion dollars worth of value stored on the bitcoin blockchain. And people will want to find things to do with that value.
00:00:39.216 - 00:00:44.064, Speaker B: And they don't want to use rap BTC either, because there is a custody risk. Exactly.
