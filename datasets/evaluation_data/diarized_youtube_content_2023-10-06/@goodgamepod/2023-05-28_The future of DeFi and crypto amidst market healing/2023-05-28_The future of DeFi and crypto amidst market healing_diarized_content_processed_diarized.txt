Right now, I think everyone is burned from the entire rendezvous of pulling out of DeFi protocols, then having to pull out of banks, then having to pull out of regulated banks exchanges. So I feel like the market is healing, and over time, the hope is that DeFi will start to take off compared to exchanges. And fact, it was funny, I was talking to a couple of market makers, and they're absolutely certain that Dexes, they're going to overtake exchanges generally, and that's going to be a thing like for next cycle. And so I thought that was an interesting data point.
