00:00:00.200 - 00:00:47.234, Speaker A: I was on Empire podcast and they asked me like, what is something that has really found product market fit in crypto? The first thing that came to my mind was stablecoins. And this may not be something that people who live in the developed world can really appreciate, but if you walk in the street in anywhere in Latin America and just grab a random person, there's a very good chance that they've interacted with USDT or USDC or Dai, like double digit percentage probability. And they use it, one, as an inflation hedge against their local currency, because despite the fact that we experienced like 8% inflation last year, us dollar outperformed everything else, every other currency in the world. And two, they use stablecoins as a means of transfer, means of payment. So stablecoins very important.
