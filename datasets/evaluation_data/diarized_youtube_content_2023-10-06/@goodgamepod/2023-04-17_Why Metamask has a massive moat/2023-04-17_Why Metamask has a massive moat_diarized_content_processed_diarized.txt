00:00:00.160 - 00:00:47.754, Speaker A: It's about bargaining power. Like, the fact that users are happy to use the built in swapping function in metamask and paying an extra like 50 75 basis points tells me that they value the convenience more than anything else. And so all these different applications, Uniswap, magic, Eden, Opensea, they want that bargaining power. They don't want to be subject to the will of someone else, which is the browser extensions, the wallets. They want to go down the layer from an application to wallets to the wallet layer. Do you think it's too late, or are we early? I think in general, it's never too late in crypto. Yeah, I'm not sure if any product in crypto has really wanted yet, just given the fact that crypto so far has only reached like maybe like 5% of the world population.
