00:00:00.160 - 00:00:36.634, Speaker A: This is just me observing. What I've observed over the past two years is the fear of missing out the FomO piece. And this has become probably the single largest problem that I see in our industry, which is this whole ape first culture that, you know, there's opportunity costs if you don't ape first. And that has propagated, too, to everyone in the industry. Right? If you look at why three arrows went down or why Sam went down, or terra Luna, whoever. But it's this idea that you need to go in and you need to go heavy and lever up, because there's a missing of an opportunity. You saw this with investors, too, if you remember over the past two years.
00:00:36.634 - 00:00:59.314, Speaker A: Like, if we didn't commit within 24 hours of an opportunity for a startup, they would just move on to another investor that would commit first. Right? And so that put a lot of pressure on us to commit. But thankfully, we focused on our diligence for the most part. I mean, there were times where we also committed, but there is this kind of industry wide, like, push to fomo in on opportunities and go all in. So I feel like that's one area that I think that we all could improve on as an industry.
