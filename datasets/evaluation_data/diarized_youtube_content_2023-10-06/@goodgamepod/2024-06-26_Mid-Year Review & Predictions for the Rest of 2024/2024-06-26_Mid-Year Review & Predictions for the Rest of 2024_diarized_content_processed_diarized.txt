00:00:00.320 - 00:00:04.090, Speaker A: Welcome to good game. Your no b's insights for crypto founders.
00:00:08.190 - 00:00:25.732, Speaker B: My main argument is we can go up on good news. We went up a little bit too fast earlier this year, so we're now taking a break. And at the same time, there's no reason to believe that the cycle is over. We'll probably go up, we'll probably be higher at the end of the year than today.
00:00:25.886 - 00:00:30.592, Speaker A: I'd agree with that. I do think, though, that this chop is gonna be brutal. It's gonna be brutal.
00:00:30.736 - 00:00:41.680, Speaker B: The slower, the longer it takes, the more brutal it is, and the more you should delete Twitter. It's gonna be like over the last two weeks where Twitter, crypto, Twitter was insufferable.
00:00:41.800 - 00:00:47.520, Speaker A: It was horrible. I mean, there are certain days where I just wouldn't even log on. Like it was, it was really bad, it was really negative.
00:00:47.640 - 00:00:56.814, Speaker B: You know, I wouldn't have logged on at all, except for the fact that all my fantasy bag holders are shitting on me for not tweeting what's new.
00:00:56.902 - 00:01:09.510, Speaker A: I get shitted on by them. But I try to perform. I try to be a good player. It's bad when I get your players texting me and dming me, people telling.
00:01:09.550 - 00:01:11.290, Speaker B: You to tell me to tweet more.
00:01:11.630 - 00:01:15.790, Speaker A: Hey, man, tell Chow to tweet. Looking for your next startup idea in crypto?
00:01:15.910 - 00:01:17.542, Speaker B: Check out our request for startups list.
00:01:17.566 - 00:01:44.200, Speaker A: And get inspired at Alliance XYZ forward slash ideas. It's been what, like two weeks now since we last caught up? Yeah, I think it's good to discuss where we are in the market. I think we just hit fifty nine k a couple of weeks ago. We thought at least the market thought up only future of France. Donald was wrong. Yeah. And now we're here.
00:01:44.200 - 00:01:56.250, Speaker A: So election is about three months away, and I guess the market wants to know where we're going next. To me, it seems like the consensus trade is that we're going to go to 50k.
00:01:56.990 - 00:02:02.210, Speaker B: By consensus trade, you mean Donald predictions, Donald Ansem?
00:02:02.670 - 00:02:03.690, Speaker A: I don't know.
00:02:04.470 - 00:02:16.506, Speaker B: Bullish. Right? I think Ansem is more bullish. Ansem is a little bit bullish. Ansem is like, we bounce at high fifties, but download is, is more like low fifties, if not forties.
00:02:16.658 - 00:02:32.666, Speaker A: Yeah. Zoran at one point said 44k. Who else? There are a bunch of other traders that are calling for like 50. Oh, Andrew. Andrew King. He called for between forties and fifties. When? Andrew King?
00:02:32.778 - 00:02:33.290, Speaker B: When?
00:02:33.410 - 00:02:34.178, Speaker A: Yesterday.
00:02:34.314 - 00:02:34.970, Speaker B: Really?
00:02:35.130 - 00:02:37.190, Speaker A: Yeah, yesterday or two days ago.
00:02:38.180 - 00:02:43.028, Speaker B: I did see his, I did see his analysis of Ethereum ETF. That was interesting.
00:02:43.044 - 00:02:46.364, Speaker A: Did you read it? I didn't get a chance to read it. Did you read it?
00:02:46.532 - 00:03:20.106, Speaker B: I read it. So it was, I'll get to the conclusion first and then talk about the analysis. The reasoning. The conclusion is the ETH ETF will, or his conclusion is that the east ETF will underperform the expectations. And the reasoning is, there's a lot of reasonings, a lot of assumptions about numbers and stuff and like that. But the reasoning is that it's more or less pressed in. And for example, you can see that in the OI of the ETH futures, it went up a lot.
00:03:20.106 - 00:04:02.946, Speaker B: So, meaning basically people are front running the ETF flow. And that is in contrast to the BTC ETF back then, the OI actually dropped right before the ETF, so people were actually taking profit. People were expecting sell the news at that time, so they sold and then they got punished by the market. So this was one of their reasonings. But he has like three or four lines of reasonings that are similar that led to this conclusion of the ETF potentially underperforming. Personally, I think the analysis is interesting. I don't know if I agree with it because I think there's way too many assumptions going into that analysis.
00:04:02.946 - 00:04:39.618, Speaker B: I just don't know. I don't know if the ETF will outperform or underperform. But if you ask me to compare the ETF flow to the BTC ETF flow and ask me which one would be bigger as a percentage of the market cap, you want to normalize the two. If you ask me which of the two ETF's would have a bigger impact to the price, I would have said the BTC ETF. And the reason for that is every trad five person that I know, the mind sharing among the trad five folks is way bigger for BTC than for Eve.
00:04:39.714 - 00:04:42.890, Speaker A: The narrative is just so much easier to comprehend for people, right?
00:04:42.970 - 00:05:18.822, Speaker B: The narrative is a lot easier. The narrative is just digital gold, whereas Ethereum is a tech play for a lot of the trap five folks. But tech play is a very abstract term. Like what kind of tech play is it? Is it a yield play? Is it a. You know, because Ethereum has some yield, right? Or is it a tech platform where people can build permissionless applications on top? Like, there's a lot of potential narratives that are complicated for traffic to understand. But my point is the mind share for BTC is a lot bigger than for ETH. Among that.
00:05:18.822 - 00:05:46.180, Speaker B: That group of users, that group of buyers, basically the tratfi folks who don't already have access to crypto through Coinbase and others, if they wanted to access crypto, they would have to buy the ETF. So for those people, I think BTC mindshare is a lot bigger. But its a weak opinion for me, its a weak. My opinion on this is not strong enough for me to place a trade. Just gone to my head, I would say eth ETF probably underperformed the BTC ETF.
00:05:46.300 - 00:05:57.060, Speaker A: There was also conversation about investors that are buying ETh ETF. They may note, really understand the dynamics because there's yield that could be earned by just buying it natively versus using an ETF.
00:05:57.140 - 00:06:04.540, Speaker B: Right, so the ETF. Yeah, so this was also one of the reasonings that I can't remember was Andrew Kang or I think it might have been Ansem.
00:06:04.660 - 00:06:05.572, Speaker A: Ansem said it.
00:06:05.676 - 00:06:23.074, Speaker B: He pointed out that the ETH ETF doesn't have the native yield. You can't stake the ETF in the ETF. And so the group of people who see ETH as a yield generating tech play will be less likely to buy the ETF as a result.
00:06:23.202 - 00:06:26.082, Speaker A: That's right. Now, can we still man that argument?
00:06:26.186 - 00:06:30.710, Speaker B: I mean, so on balance, I don't think, obviously, I don't think the ETH ETF is bearish.
00:06:31.010 - 00:06:31.790, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:06:32.610 - 00:06:36.210, Speaker B: I just think the impact is probably less than the BTC ETf.
00:06:36.330 - 00:07:10.236, Speaker A: I don't know, maybe I'm feeling like the market is over indexing on the bearishness. I think this is really obviously very positive. Yeah. And we haven't yet seen the market participants that are actually going to buy the ETF. For anyone to buy it on the balance sheet of a large company or investment, investment management arm, it's going to be very hard for them to actually acquire ETH natively, and it's better off that they buy it through a structured product like an ETF. So I do think there is a market for it, based on what you're saying. I generally agree that I don't know how big that buying opportunity for them.
00:07:10.308 - 00:07:44.602, Speaker B: Back to the earlier topic, where we are in the broader market. So there's one thing that I didn't really like over the last few weeks or even a couple of months is that we had a lot of good news and the market couldn't go up. That was the thing that tells me, man, this thing, like we're probably taking a break. And some of the news were, for example, well, the ETH ETF approval, that was a good news. The SEC withdrawing their investigation into Ethan. Consensus and consensus, all that stuff. That was the good news.
00:07:44.706 - 00:07:45.386, Speaker A: Yep.
00:07:45.538 - 00:08:30.854, Speaker B: Trump shilling crypto in every single one of his speeches. That is really bullish for the entire crypto asset class and industry. That was bullish. And Trump currently, according to the prediction market odds, not just the crypto native ones, not just like polymarket, but also the traditional web, two betting websites, Trump is now around 55%, somewhere between 50 and 60, whereas Biden is in the mid thirties to low forties. And so Trump is fairly ahead of Biden in the race. And the fact that he's bullish. Crypto should be bullish for the market, and yet the market is not going up.
00:08:30.854 - 00:09:06.458, Speaker B: So whenever any market, not just crypto, whenever any market couldn't go up on good news, it tends to be bearish. And vice versa, whenever the market cannot go down on bad news, it's really, really bullish. For example, two years ago, when the whole thing, FTX, all that stuff happened, there was a period of a lot of FUD following the collapse of FTX, including FUD around Binance. But all these news couldn't bring the market down, and that was extremely bullish. That was BTC below 20,000. And today we're seeing sort of the opposite of that, which is a lot of good news. And the market couldn't go up.
00:09:06.554 - 00:09:33.054, Speaker A: Do you think this is a byproduct of the upcoming Mount Gox? Obviously, Mount Gox today announced that they're going to start distributing. Was it 80,140, 4000 bitcoin? I believe it was. And so Galaxy wrote a huge report on it, which I'll share in a bit. But do you think this news had something to do with it over the past few weeks? Because that's what some people are speculating.
00:09:33.222 - 00:09:45.630, Speaker B: It would probably spook the derivative traders, the perp traders, not the spreadsheet. Also, funny enough, this morning a friend of mine asked me if I. If I was going to sell my Mongo. Because, you know, I have Mongox.
00:09:45.710 - 00:09:46.182, Speaker A: Yes.
00:09:46.286 - 00:10:03.544, Speaker B: And he asked me, like, if I was going to sell the Mongox bitcoin. That's when I discovered, oh, actually, Mongox is going to offload a bunch of the BTC. But that's like short term bearish. But the other thing is that Germany, the government Germany, right.
00:10:03.592 - 00:10:05.300, Speaker A: Yeah. They have 4 billion, 3 billion.
00:10:06.680 - 00:10:20.128, Speaker B: And that also spooked some of the traders. But anyway, I think these two are more short term. I think the main thing that worries me is that the good news cannot push the market up. That's generally a bad sign for me.
00:10:20.264 - 00:10:27.018, Speaker A: I feel as if we're running out of good news. I don't know what other catalysts there are outside of the ETTF. Maybe.
00:10:27.154 - 00:10:31.818, Speaker B: I mean, there's, there's two more until the end of the year. One is the rate cuts.
00:10:31.954 - 00:10:33.458, Speaker A: Yeah. The elections and rate cuts.
00:10:33.514 - 00:10:34.754, Speaker B: Yeah. Elections and rate cuts.
00:10:34.842 - 00:10:38.546, Speaker A: Yeah. Aren't, is it rate cuts short term bearish?
00:10:38.698 - 00:10:39.794, Speaker B: No. Why?
00:10:39.962 - 00:10:45.610, Speaker A: For, for the markets? I don't know. Somebody put a report out recently that said that every time there's a rate cut, the markets.
00:10:45.770 - 00:10:49.818, Speaker B: Okay. So yeah, there's a, there's a lot.
00:10:49.834 - 00:10:55.052, Speaker A: Of armchair economists, so I want to make sure that that would address some of this stuff.
00:10:55.116 - 00:11:39.184, Speaker B: So there's a lot of macro larps on Twitter that think that rate cuts are bearish. But what they're looking at is the historical pattern, which is that whenever the Fed cuts the rates, the market tends to go down. But the fact that they missed is that historically, the vast majority of the times when the Fed cuts rates, it's when the market, it was when the economy was not doing well. So the economy was heading towards recession, recession, depression, and the Fed needed some stimulus and rate cuts was one of them. But this time it's actually different. This time the Fed is not cutting rates because the economy is doing poorly. In fact, the economy is doing really, really well.
00:11:39.184 - 00:12:08.418, Speaker B: They're cutting the rates because inflation has more or less stabilized and they want to, well, there's a stated reason and there's a real reason. The real reason, I think, is pumping the markets a little bit ahead of the, ahead of the election for the Democrats. But anyway, the point being, this time the rates cut is fundamentally based on a different reason from the majority of historical instances. So this time the rate cuts are actually bullish.
00:12:08.554 - 00:12:41.030, Speaker A: Yeah, I'd agree with that. So between rate cuts, I just saw, I was just reading a tweet just a few minutes ago that talked about how rig hits may not even happen because the market's doing so well. So there is that. I don't know how big of a reason this is, but because the economy is doing so well, there could be a possibility that the Fed may push till next year. Because before, when we first started the year, I think the market was pricing in three rate cuts this year. Then it went down to two. Now it seems like it's going down to one and that one could go down to zero.
00:12:41.030 - 00:12:51.058, Speaker A: And so it'll be interesting to see how Powell and the Fed reacts to this as the market starts to do well.
00:12:51.154 - 00:12:54.506, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, so far, it looks like they want to do one before the election.
00:12:54.658 - 00:12:55.682, Speaker A: They have to do one.
00:12:55.786 - 00:13:43.410, Speaker B: Can I show you the, like, one of the most ridiculous, absurd statistics I've ever seen in my life is that if you look at the return of the s and p 503 months before the election, 80% of the times, whenever the s and P goes up during those three months, 80% of the time, the incumbent wins, and 20% of the time, or 20% of the time, the incumbent loses. So in this case, Biden is the incumbent and Trump is the challenger, vice versa. Whenever the s and P 500 goes down during the three months before the election, 80% chance that the incumbent loses. It's absurd. It was very consistent over the last call of 50 to 100 years. So 25 elections. Ballpark.
00:13:43.410 - 00:13:53.802, Speaker B: 20 elections. Call it 20 elections. Very consistent. So the Democrats must have figured this out by now. So, yeah, they want the market to go up.
00:13:53.906 - 00:13:58.354, Speaker A: So this is like our version of some sort of ponzi pump.
00:13:58.522 - 00:14:01.346, Speaker B: The cabal. The cabal pumping the market.
00:14:01.498 - 00:14:11.698, Speaker A: I could dig that. Okay, so we have that. We may have a rate cut. And then. Now let's think about the elections. Biden wins, then what?
00:14:11.794 - 00:14:12.626, Speaker B: Probably down.
00:14:12.778 - 00:14:14.130, Speaker A: Trump wins, obviously. Good up.
00:14:14.170 - 00:14:14.794, Speaker B: Go up.
00:14:14.922 - 00:14:32.574, Speaker A: All right, so I think this is a good summary for what's to come over the next six months. I think it seems like on Twitter right now, it's consensus that it's going to be chop down, chop until volume expands and people are hedging their bets against the election.
00:14:32.702 - 00:15:01.620, Speaker B: I don't actually disagree with the consensus most of the time. I don't disagree with the consensus. And the other FuD is Nvidia. People think Nvidia is topping. And some tweeted about the chart looking like parabolic increase. And I tweeted about Nvidia insiders selling their shares at a faster pace than ever while. While their retail flow is incoming.
00:15:01.620 - 00:15:17.316, Speaker B: I'm not sure what to make of Nvidia. The reason why Nvidia is so important is because it feels like Nvidia is what holds the entire market. So if Nvidia holds the stock market, I mean, I don't want to draw a strong conclusion, but Nvidia is. Does seem like the market leader right now.
00:15:17.428 - 00:15:17.980, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:18.100 - 00:15:21.798, Speaker B: So that's the other piece of the FuD. I don't think it's that important.
00:15:21.964 - 00:15:23.922, Speaker A: I don't either. We'll have to see.
00:15:24.026 - 00:15:42.242, Speaker B: But my main argument is we can go up on good news. We went up a little bit too fast. Earlier this year. So we're now taking a break. And at the same time, there's no reason to believe that the cycle is over. We'll probably go up. We'll probably be higher at the end of the year than today.
00:15:42.386 - 00:15:47.122, Speaker A: I'd agree with that. I do think, though, that this chop is going to be brutal. It's going to be brutal.
00:15:47.266 - 00:15:58.150, Speaker B: The slower, the longer it takes, the more brutal it is, and the more you should delete Twitter. It's going to be like, over the last two weeks where Twitter, crypto, Twitter was insufferable.
00:15:58.270 - 00:16:04.014, Speaker A: It was horrible. I mean, there were certain days where I just wouldn't even log on. Like, it was. It was really bad. It was really negative.
00:16:04.142 - 00:16:13.302, Speaker B: You know, I wouldn't have logged on at all, except for the fact that all my fantasy bag holders are shitting on me for not tweeting what's new.
00:16:13.406 - 00:16:26.010, Speaker A: I get shitted on by them. But I try to perform. I try to be a good player. It's bad when I get your players texting me and dming me, people telling.
00:16:26.050 - 00:16:27.790, Speaker B: You to tell me to tweet more.
00:16:28.130 - 00:16:37.410, Speaker A: Amen. Tell chow to tweet. But, oh, we should talk about, you know, obviously today is the launch of Blast.
00:16:37.570 - 00:16:38.354, Speaker B: Oh, is it?
00:16:38.482 - 00:17:01.226, Speaker A: Yeah, the blast foundation. And today ends the 6th tournament for fantasy top as well. And so they're distributing blast gold to everyone. And, you know, everyone's awaiting and speculating what the blast token is in a price out at. And I checked Abel last night, and it was around $3 per token.
00:17:01.338 - 00:17:03.442, Speaker B: And what's the supply?
00:17:03.586 - 00:17:05.946, Speaker A: I'll have to check. I'm not sure exactly.
00:17:06.058 - 00:17:08.314, Speaker B: I would imagine it's a billion or something.
00:17:08.482 - 00:17:09.230, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:17:09.630 - 00:17:10.350, Speaker B: Number.
00:17:10.510 - 00:17:11.734, Speaker A: Nice round number.
00:17:11.902 - 00:17:19.358, Speaker B: Arbitrum right now is 8 billion ftv. So if blast is at three, I would say it's pretty fair.
00:17:19.494 - 00:17:46.018, Speaker A: So Xerox bread guy, who's also a listener of our podcast, said that about. He says 5.8 billion FTV feels low for blast. For blast, 1 billion circulating. So people are speculating right now, you know, 1 billion circulating market cap, 6 billion FTV is roughly what people think about. 14% of the total supply for blast will be an airdrop. 14 billion tokens have been transferred to a smart contract.
00:17:46.194 - 00:17:52.786, Speaker B: I don't think blast should be priced higher than arbitrum. Arbitrum is still the obvious front runner.
00:17:52.898 - 00:18:29.140, Speaker A: Well, arbitrum also has liquidity shocks, right? I mean, they had a huge unlock and two big unlocks, right? One was they had a $200 million fund that they. There was a Dow governance vote, where they're building out like a gaming catalyst fund. So there's 200 million arb that has been allocated for that. And then now they have some big vc unlocks that are happening over the next few years. So I do think there is going to be a supply shock there. So, yeah, I'll be curious to see how blast will turn up, but people are very bullish on blast generally.
00:18:29.260 - 00:18:35.412, Speaker B: We should do an overview, a summary, lessons learned for the first half of the year.
00:18:35.556 - 00:18:36.708, Speaker A: Yeah, let's do it.
00:18:36.844 - 00:18:45.476, Speaker B: Because now it's end of June, 6 months have passed. What happened where we are in the market? Why are people so jaded on Twitter?
00:18:45.628 - 00:19:24.140, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I mean, obviously the first one we're going to talk about is like speculation, right. Speculation was kind of one of our core thesis over the past two years. And one of the byproducts of speculation is meme coins. And so the good and bad, well, high level, I think the good is that attention is now being tokenized. Right? So it is a form of attention. And we're starting to see this with pump fun, friend tech. Well, it really started with friend tech as a core idea of how people were going to tokenize themselves, as an example.
00:19:24.140 - 00:20:05.880, Speaker A: And then it led to pump fun, which led to anyone being able to create their own token and launch it for $2. And so then you started to see a lot of interest around meme coins launch. And then more or less towards the latter half of the year, we started to see tokenizing creators through fantasy top, and then more recently, time fun. And so being able to tokenize time as well for a creator. And then the macro is just like tokens everywhere, right? So you have whiff as an example. We talked earlier about like Dogwift hat, which was one of the leading meme coins for the year. Bonk was another one.
00:20:05.880 - 00:20:21.200, Speaker A: And what else? I mean, we saw pups, we saw wizards, ordinals, et cetera. But we'll talk about more on the, on the macro for meme coins. So those were all the things that went right? I think so, yeah. Let's touch on that.
00:20:23.100 - 00:20:25.068, Speaker B: What do you want to talk about there?
00:20:25.204 - 00:20:43.206, Speaker A: Well, I think those are things that went right. I wouldn't say right. But that's what happened. That was the current market. So I think there's two things that I see right. One is like, I think there's some market fatigue in meme coins. So the rate of meme coins that have launched, I think you had the last number, right.
00:20:43.206 - 00:20:46.510, Speaker A: I think it was like 100,000 coins. A day?
00:20:46.550 - 00:20:51.846, Speaker B: Was it five figures? Five or six figures? Can't remember. But something really absurd.
00:20:51.958 - 00:21:30.036, Speaker A: Yeah, it was something really absurd. And I think there's market fatigue in the sense that people don't know what coins to buy anymore because the rate of tokens that are launching is upwards of 100,000. And so with was easy back then, because all the attention, there was a lot of attention in the room, and people were able to kind of corral the community to buy a token, which was with or bonk. Now it's much harder, like, getting people together to buy a token is very, very hard. And so I think what's happening is, like, there's, like, different fragmentations of the meme coin market. One quadrant is primarily, I'd say, pvP. And.
00:21:30.036 - 00:22:05.806, Speaker A: And so if you look at what's happening on pump as an example, there's. It's very competitive, I would say, to get a token to actually to the market, because you have two sides to this. You have people that want to buy, but then there's people that want to extract value. And for that, I see it being very competitive to even getting it to the market. Number two is the ones that do make it to the market. The average person will not understand what to buy next. So then they look for influencers that are able to be the signal to the market to show which coins that they should buy.
00:22:05.806 - 00:22:19.774, Speaker A: So I'd say that's like quarter number two. Then you have quarter number three, which is like existing blueprint. I don't like blue chip memes. Right. I wouldn't say blue chips, but the ones that have Lindy. And so then you have. But they are higher fDv.
00:22:19.774 - 00:22:51.882, Speaker A: So you have that as kind of like the third quadrant, and then the last quadrant is probably, I would say, meme coins on other chains, the ones that aren't dominant. So right now, the dominant chain is Solana. So a lot of the attention is aggregated on Solana. But then you also have meme coins on base. You have meme coins on Arb Senkou, which their layer three just launched, et cetera, et cetera. So you have this other quadrant of memes. So I would say, generally speaking, this is kind of where we are from a macro perspective, on meme coins.
00:22:51.986 - 00:22:54.550, Speaker B: I'm just really tired of talking about meme coins.
00:22:55.010 - 00:22:59.410, Speaker A: I think the market exhausted. It's. I mean, the fatigue is real.
00:22:59.570 - 00:23:24.820, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, I feel like. So there's fatigue towards meme coins, but also there's, at the same time, fatigue towards infra. And those are the two things that caught people's attention in the first half of the year. Right. Those are the only two things. There's so many infra investments, and that's on the vc side and then on the retail side is the trading meme coins.
00:23:24.820 - 00:23:30.736, Speaker B: It's very bifurcated, it's very binary, actually. There's retail trade meme coins and nvcs.
00:23:30.768 - 00:23:52.960, Speaker A: Fund infra, but the same thing, they're both memes. Right? Yeah. So I think for meme coins, I do feel like the market is taking a break from it. And I think it's just going to be one of those things that people aren't going to talk about as much, at least for the next few months. People are just going to get chopped up. But there will be a few memes that will stand out eventually. And so I think those are the ones that people are going to rally around.
00:23:52.960 - 00:23:59.888, Speaker A: But it seems like Dogwift had is the meme in itself is like, I have been hearing much about it recently except for.
00:23:59.944 - 00:24:08.260, Speaker B: Except from Don, who has been bearish since the top after missing out on a 50 x, of course.
00:24:08.600 - 00:24:10.056, Speaker A: I think he missed out on a lot of things.
00:24:10.168 - 00:24:10.860, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:24:11.200 - 00:24:12.864, Speaker A: But he's great at calling tops, though.
00:24:12.992 - 00:24:15.600, Speaker B: Recently he did sell BTC at 38.
00:24:15.720 - 00:24:37.200, Speaker A: That's right. All right, so let's talk about a couple other things. So I don't know if you saw that announcement that bored apes or Yuga Labs made. Was it like three months, like a month ago where they launched a, some sort of like offshoot of a punk's collection? And did you see the, the punks. Did you see the, the offshoot NFT?
00:24:37.320 - 00:24:40.460, Speaker B: Yeah, it was one of the ugliest things I've ever seen.
00:24:43.290 - 00:25:06.250, Speaker A: I mean, it was horrible. And they like, borrowed the name of punks. They called it punk something. I don't even know, but it looked pretty bad. And so the market reacted aggressively and started selling crypto punks because of that. And then I thought a lot about it. One, because my fantasy top holders kept bugging me to tweet.
00:25:06.250 - 00:25:34.360, Speaker A: So I spent the whole afternoon thinking about, like, a good idea to tweet. And I looked at the NFT market, and recently CBB, who was one of the largest market makers on blur, decided that he isn't going to market make on blur anymore. And as soon as he pulled the liquidity, all of the NFTs say, like, you know, the popular ones like pudgies and bored apes and all, and some other collections ended up going down like another, like ten to 20% wait, but CBB.
00:25:34.520 - 00:25:39.720, Speaker B: Wait. Why did he stop market making? Is it because the rewards, like, the.
00:25:39.800 - 00:25:57.264, Speaker A: Rewards didn't give an exact reason, but he says, he just said it was been a wild ride. Probably one of our most challenging times in crypto so far. It's time for us to close this chapter. He farmed 25% of total points. Farmed top one on rolling 24 hours leaderboard for 175 days. But I don't think the risk reward was there anymore for him.
00:25:57.352 - 00:26:00.626, Speaker B: Crazy. 25% of all the rewards. That's crazy.
00:26:00.728 - 00:26:23.110, Speaker A: Yeah. He was probably by far one of the best performing farmers, probably ever did incredibly well. He lost $3.5 million in his last season, I think. So that was probably a function of that. Right? Like, typically you can lose money because you know that the tokens will make up for it, but there's a point in time where the tokens will not help. Right.
00:26:23.110 - 00:26:32.088, Speaker A: And, you know, if you look at where we are in the NFT macro, NFT perspective, there's not a lot of buying, selling happening on nfts anymore. Yeah.
00:26:32.104 - 00:27:02.280, Speaker B: So, yeah, this is a big theme in the, in the first half of the year. Right. Feels like all the attention shifted away from, from nfts to meme coins among the speculators. I'm looking at the crypto punks price chart right now. It's one of the ugliest price charts I've ever seen. Especially, I mean, since the beginning of the year, since January is down, only it's a straight line down. It went from 60 eth to below 30 now, straight line down.
00:27:02.280 - 00:27:09.420, Speaker B: So the question is, will nfts come back? Will the JPegs come back? The PFPs come back?
00:27:09.540 - 00:28:01.512, Speaker A: I think it will. Here's my thesis. My thesis is that because NFTs are so illiquid, the price action that we see, generally when we see what we see in meme coins will take years to play out versus months to play out. And so that's kind of, it's a function of that, right? The liquidity of the assets. I also say, number two is the market's trying to figure out what are nfts really good for. If meme coins are highly speculative machines or assets, what are left for nfts? And number three is, I think we're seeing the good and bad players come out of, are emerging out of this kind of backdrop of 2021 NFT marketplace or the NFT boom, and we're seeing some slow motion growth and then we're seeing some slow motion losses. So let's talk about the growth, because I think there's a lot of cool stuff happening on the growth side.
00:28:01.512 - 00:28:48.066, Speaker A: Pudgy Penguins is an example, is a really good example of good stories and nfts. And so, like, Luca, as an example, if you don't know, ended up buying the collection from kind of a grifter in the NFT space. And he, I think, rallied around like two, two and a half million dollars about the collection from this person. Right? And then from there, the idea was bringing this IP to more people. And so one concept was license the IP to build toys and release toys out to the consumers. The other idea, which I'm a pretty big fan of, is the concept of bringing more familiarity to the brand by using digital content. And so I did some research on this before I put this tweet out.
00:28:48.066 - 00:29:11.852, Speaker A: But if you look at pudgy penguins presence across social media, it's very, very strong. So here's a, here's some, here's some data they'll share. I'm going to share my screen here to show you. Let me know when you see my screen. But if you look at pudgy penguins, they have 1.4 million followers on Instagram. 372 posts, 95 million for their most popular reel.
00:29:11.852 - 00:29:25.916, Speaker A: If you look at, you know, TikTok as an example, look at all the numbers here, 12 million likes, all time likes. If you look at Giphy as an example, 11,000 GiF uploads, 20 billion views. And the numbers kind of the pachy.
00:29:25.948 - 00:29:27.036, Speaker B: Giphys are the best.
00:29:27.148 - 00:29:39.124, Speaker A: They're the best. And, and so, like, that kind of gives you an idea. 20 billion views. That's insanity. I mean, like, look at this. 23 million examples. Yeah.
00:29:39.124 - 00:30:07.890, Speaker A: So you could tell, like, pudgy understands the market really well and is going for it. Here's a, here's. So let's contrast that to Yuga Labs as an example. Yugo Labs has 547,000 followers on Instagram with 600. Their most viewed real is at 600,000. Yugalabs doesn't even have a Giphy account. As an example, on YouTube is another good comparison.
00:30:07.890 - 00:30:33.682, Speaker A: Pudgy has 1.6 million views. Yuga labs has 1.4 million views, with one video accounting for 800,000 views, which was the other side trailer from two years ago. And so to me, if you look at the market, I feel like there's two players. Like, I'm going to pit pudgy penguins against yuga Labs or igloo against Yuga Labs. Pudgy penguins self funded race, a modest round, and has a clear direction on where they're going.
00:30:33.682 - 00:31:17.614, Speaker A: They're going to get the IP familialized with as many people as possible globally. And then from there you could use that as a wedge to building products. So the first product is toys, but then you can upsell, right, then you could do maybe shows digital content, you know, and then continue to go up from there. Whereas Yuga labs came in from a very different direction, which is they became very successful very quickly, raised $400 million, 450 million, plus all the mints that it did. So let's say $600 million or 550 million total. So they came in with the position of power and influence and they've tried many experiments. So they made a song with Eminem and 50 cent or whatever.
00:31:17.614 - 00:31:40.512, Speaker A: I don't if you remember that horrible song. So they went, they went culture first. They went. So they tried to go top down culture first. Then they tried to, they built a game, dookie Dash, as an example. And so they're doing different things. They have an NFT only club where they're planning to build a kind of a exclusive club or something.
00:31:40.512 - 00:31:49.374, Speaker A: But to me, directionally, I don't know what they're doing. If you were to ask me what a one liners for you collapse, I don't know what that is. It's very hard for me.
00:31:49.502 - 00:32:12.486, Speaker B: They keep launching new things that dilute the value of existing collections. Example, the new collections that launched a couple weeks ago, that was ugly as fuck. Whereas Pudgy's just focuses on one collection, one brand, one identity, and drives all the attention to that one collection 100%.
00:32:12.638 - 00:32:22.470, Speaker A: And I think that's the, the right approach. Joe, actually from our team recently wrote a tweet thread about decentralizing Disney as an example.
00:32:22.510 - 00:32:24.582, Speaker B: I love that thread. You want to read it out?
00:32:24.686 - 00:32:55.458, Speaker A: It's a great thread, and that's probably the right approach. So like Mfers is an example, started going the Giphy route, right, getting more, more and more views. I think they got like 15, 20 million views on one of their Giphy account for mfRs. And I think for some reason, to me, that is the right approach. All of the NFT collections should be on Giphy. They should be on Instagram, they should be in front of as many audience as possible. And once you get that IP familiarized, then that's a great wedge into competing against Disney.
00:32:55.458 - 00:33:15.652, Speaker A: And to me, if you ask me, this is probably the right time to compete against Disney. They're too big. They're starting to lose money, they're starting to lose focus. There's a lot of things that are going wrong for Disney today, and I think there is a wedge against that kind of backdrop. And then being able to build something that's like crypto native, digitally native first, and then building a community from there.
00:33:15.756 - 00:33:57.960, Speaker B: I mean, fundamentally, you were talking about how they should be on TikTok, on Instagram, on Giphy, all that stuff. Fundamentally, that makes me think that NFTs are tokenized attention. Bringing the NFTs back to our original theme of tokenized attention is not fundamentally different from meme coins. It's all about attention, right? It's not different from meme coins, not different from fantasy tokenizing creators. It's not different from time Dot fund, which is tokenizing people's time. All these different products and verticals are basically tokenizing our attention here.
00:33:58.080 - 00:34:16.080, Speaker A: So here's a great example. Disney, their account has 1800 uploads with 17.4 billion GiF views. Pudging peg ones, 11.4 thousand GiF uploads, 22 billion GiF views. I mean, there's something going on over there. There's something going on over there.
00:34:16.080 - 00:35:20.334, Speaker A: And I think what's happening is we're starting to see that Disney is starting to, you know, look, I'm speculating here, but it seems to me that Disney's kind of slowing down on the digital content strategy and just new forms of attention, ways to get attention, TikTok, GiF, Giphy, et cetera. And there are other ip that's starting to take, fill those pockets and get in front of users more. I think that's where I see this going. And then eventually, I think this is still an experiment, but, you know, pudgy penguins has something called overpass where people can license, like, if I have an NFT, I can license this to pudgy penguins. And then pudgy penguins will use this pool of people, that of NFTs that people are willing to license as a way to license it and then return some of that revenue back to NFT holders. I'm not sure if that's the right approach, but at least there's some value being given to NFT holders. I think to me, you know, okay, Disney is an example.
00:35:20.334 - 00:35:39.078, Speaker A: People are willing to die to go to a theme park for, for Disney. They're, they're spending hundreds and thousands of dollars. They get the best hotels. They get as close as possible to the theme park. They go onto the theme park a few times a year. They watch every movie, they buy every toy. There's fanatics that are out there.
00:35:39.078 - 00:35:59.774, Speaker A: Imagine if all that could be given to free for NFT holders as an example how much? I mean, that in itself is a lot of value. Right. And that could be a world where, you know, if pudgy penguins becomes very popular, you know, that could be something that could be a free incentive for NFT holders. Not saying that that's their direction, but that's an interesting speculative idea to think about.
00:35:59.902 - 00:36:01.814, Speaker B: Even this is down really bad.
00:36:01.942 - 00:36:02.718, Speaker A: It's over.
00:36:02.854 - 00:36:06.718, Speaker B: Dodges down over 50% since the beginning of the year.
00:36:06.854 - 00:36:41.234, Speaker A: Yeah, it's 8.4, but I think today was the second time pudgies surpassed bored apes again. Yeah. So I think the market's starting to realize that Pudgy has, at least as of today, a good direction as to where they're going to go. Like, people can understand that. So I think one of the metas in NFTs is like, why would I want to buy an NFt next? Well, I want to buy an NFT because I could see this art or this the NFT as a means to some form of IP in the future that could be very successful. That's like one way to think about it.
00:36:41.234 - 00:36:45.842, Speaker A: Not saying it's all entirety, but that's one way to think about why I would want to buy an NFT.
00:36:45.946 - 00:36:48.858, Speaker B: Any other major themes in the first half of the year?
00:36:49.034 - 00:37:00.442, Speaker A: Defi? You want to talk about Defi? I know Defi hasn't been that important of a topic these days because not much is happening there, but anything in Defi that you want to talk about.
00:37:00.546 - 00:37:02.914, Speaker B: I mean, you could consider restaking as Defi.
00:37:03.042 - 00:37:03.710, Speaker A: Sure.
00:37:04.690 - 00:37:20.586, Speaker B: There aren't that many. Super interesting. Well, Jupiter launched first half of the year. Well, I guess what's interesting DeFi is feel like I haven't seen the numbers recently, but I feel like Solana is ahead of Ethereum now on many of the Defi metrics.
00:37:20.738 - 00:37:21.482, Speaker A: Are they?
00:37:21.626 - 00:37:22.090, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:37:22.170 - 00:37:29.468, Speaker A: Let's see. So right now, Ethereum, are we considering, are we comparing Ethereum to Solana or are we taking a.
00:37:29.554 - 00:37:31.800, Speaker B: Let's start with Ethereum Mainnet.
00:37:31.920 - 00:37:37.328, Speaker A: Ethereum mainnet has 57 billion total value locked and Solana has 4 billion.
00:37:37.464 - 00:37:39.384, Speaker B: No tv. All is not a good.
00:37:39.472 - 00:37:40.544, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't think TVL is a good.
00:37:40.552 - 00:37:43.240, Speaker B: Yeah. Let's look at trading volume.
00:37:43.280 - 00:37:44.672, Speaker A: Volume, do you have it?
00:37:44.776 - 00:37:56.750, Speaker B: Yeah. So Solana, actually, Ethereum is still ahead. Ethereum mainnet is still ahead. But they are within the same order of magnitude. Trading money, training volume. Yeah. Dex volume.
00:37:56.750 - 00:38:03.922, Speaker B: Like last this month, Ethereum has done 35 billion and Solana did 29 billion. Yeah, they're very close.
00:38:04.066 - 00:38:04.826, Speaker A: Very close.
00:38:04.938 - 00:38:35.392, Speaker B: Obviously not including the L2s. Layer twos are doing a lot of volume two. Arbitrum is doing 10 billion, baze is doing ten, blast is doing two. So, okay, so the two main L2s are Bayes and arbitrum. Together they're doing 20 billion. I would imagine that all the L2s combined are doing similar volume to Ethereum main net. Okay, so this is the other really big theme, which is the rise of L2s this past year or half a year.
00:38:35.392 - 00:38:52.690, Speaker B: I think I'm looking at l two beats. Yeah. So the total TPS on L2s has been up only for the last two years. So right now together it's all the L2 s are doing around 140 tps.
00:38:52.850 - 00:38:54.170, Speaker A: 140 tps, yeah.
00:38:54.210 - 00:39:20.430, Speaker B: Whereas Ethereum layer one is doing like 1312. So L2 s now are combined, they're doing ten times more TPS than Ethereum layer one. And the trend is very clear. It's been up for the last couple of years. Obviously a lot of that has to do with, well, so there's several factors. There's 48, 44, which reduce the cost of data availability, which was a couple months ago. And then there's the fact that there's actually more and more L2s.
00:39:20.430 - 00:39:45.050, Speaker B: And all these contribute to the total number of TPS. There's bayes that launched a year ago but really grew in the past half a year or so. There's Taiko, there's blast. Arbitrum continues to dominate optimism. Mainnet is doing pretty well too. So L2 s are really taking off. That's the other big trend of the first half of the year.
00:39:45.170 - 00:40:18.282, Speaker A: And the question is, obviously this is going to continue to accelerate. How many L2s do you think? Well, see, I mean, obviously there's some, maybe we could touch on this, but a lot of startups are going the L2 route raising, hoping to get the market cap from a public markets perspective. There's an Arb there. So founders are arbing that as an example and trying to, and that's somewhat of creating value back to token holders, which I think is false. But if you were to think about the power law, how many successful L2s do you think we'll see in the market?
00:40:18.386 - 00:40:36.058, Speaker B: I think we see a handful of, by handful, I mean literally five. Ballpark. Five successful general purpose L2s that matter. Right. So the, like today, that's arbitrum, optimism, baze, blast. Can you think of anyone else? That's pretty much it.
00:40:36.154 - 00:40:43.764, Speaker A: I mean there's polygon and. Well, not polygon the sidechain, but you have the kind of the CDK model as well.
00:40:43.812 - 00:41:01.160, Speaker B: Yeah, polycon. Polygon. The zke vm isn't. Isn't doing a lot of TPS or volume. You could consider Zksync linear mental scroll, like these. I would say the tier two.
00:41:01.500 - 00:41:21.032, Speaker A: So there's like two. You know, I feel like there's kind of two models, right? One is a super chain model, like optimism. Right? Optimism. Zksync and Polygon CDK. Right. Where you can roll up, essentially create your own roll ups that sync up to the.
00:41:21.176 - 00:41:23.016, Speaker B: Does Zksync also offer that?
00:41:23.088 - 00:41:26.536, Speaker A: I thought they did, because, I mean.
00:41:26.608 - 00:41:33.878, Speaker B: Like, all these major projects want to own their own ecosystem and enable anyone to launch their app chains.
00:41:34.054 - 00:41:54.646, Speaker A: And there's some benefits to it, right? There's with Polygon, there's the AG layer. So there's some sort of composability and speed latency between different roll ups in terms of cross chain comms. Super chain optimism doesn't have that yet. As an example, I'm not sure about Zksync. Maybe I was wrong about Zksync. I have to take a look.
00:41:54.758 - 00:41:57.700, Speaker B: Yeah. Arbitrum has that. Polygon has that.
00:41:58.320 - 00:41:59.100, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:41:59.960 - 00:42:40.790, Speaker B: But point being, I think there will be a handful of these general purpose L2s that matter, and then there will just be hundreds, if not thousands of app chain L2s. If crypto was to succeed, that's what's going to happen. Like, there's going to be a proliferation of app specific L2s because people want. Developers want to, want to own their own stack. They want to accrue all the value instead of letting the value accrue to another L2 or layer one. And they want to make sure that they're not competing for the same block space with other developers. So they want to own their block space.
00:42:40.790 - 00:42:48.446, Speaker B: So it's a very natural trend for app specific layer tools to continue to proliferate.
00:42:48.578 - 00:43:03.598, Speaker A: That sounds about right to me. Yeah. So ZK. The ZK stack is ZK chains, and lens protocol is one of them. It's called Zkstack. Hyperchain. Yeah, I can't deal with the buzz buzzwords anymore.
00:43:03.694 - 00:43:09.530, Speaker B: Super chain, CDK, hyperchain. Hyperchain. What's the arbitrum one called?
00:43:10.390 - 00:43:11.182, Speaker A: Orbits.
00:43:11.326 - 00:43:14.050, Speaker B: Orbits, orbits, orbits.
00:43:14.440 - 00:43:26.620, Speaker A: And so, yeah, I could get around that thesis where we'll have, like, four or five infras. Right? And then you'll have. So we'll have two things. Right. Infra. And then maybe just L2s on its own.
00:43:27.320 - 00:44:01.838, Speaker B: So and then there's the rise of caldera conduit, like these roll ups. As a service, those projects are doing pretty well as a result of more apps wanting to launch their own L2s. So thats another pretty big trend. Anything else? Oh, AI. AI crypto. I dont know how we forgot about that, but AI crypto was a top three trend in the first half of the year, I would say probably on par with the whole meme coin mania.
00:44:01.974 - 00:44:35.662, Speaker A: So tell me more about the AI in the crypto space, because Eric, well, a well known bitcoiner that is working on launching Opcat, as an example, said he made a tweet and he said something in order of if you're a founder looking to build in the crypto AI space, just build in the AI space. Don't dilute yourself by building. He didn't. This is not worth a word, but I'm paraphrasing here, but he said build in the AI space. Don't do crypto AI. You're just diluting yourself or something. Something like that.
00:44:35.662 - 00:44:37.010, Speaker A: What are your thoughts on that?
00:44:37.430 - 00:44:51.490, Speaker B: Well, again, we talked about this before, but I still think most of the AI crypto projects don't make sense, and they are just being very opportunistic, taking advantage of the hype and the VC FOMO and the retail fomo.
00:44:52.590 - 00:44:58.262, Speaker A: Any AI projects you're excited about today? Crypto AI. Let's talk about that instead.
00:44:58.406 - 00:45:17.250, Speaker B: Well, I mean, there are things I'm very open minded to. I don't know if they'll work, but I'm very open minded to the possibility of, for example, Eric Voorhees launched his decentralized AI project a few weeks ago, remember?
00:45:17.330 - 00:45:18.730, Speaker A: Yes, yes, I remember that.
00:45:18.770 - 00:45:59.720, Speaker B: That was exactly the same idea that Excel is working on. So this is the other edge AI product that we mentioned a couple episodes ago, the ability to run open source models on your local device in a way that preserves privacy, decentralization, and unbiasedness. Some of the LLMs, like chat, GPT, or Gemini, are very politically biased. So Exo is one of those projects. And the other one is what air forhees launched a few weeks ago. Those are very interesting to me. They're actually solving a real problem.
00:45:59.720 - 00:46:27.436, Speaker B: The real problem is political bias and privacy. Interestingly, I think I saw that Eric Voorhees product is running on a cache which is the decentralized GPU marketplace. I was really biased against the GPU marketplaces before, but that changed my mind a little bit. So that's interesting. So basically they're running inference on a decentralized GPU marketplace.
00:46:27.588 - 00:46:28.164, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:46:28.252 - 00:46:54.908, Speaker B: But there is a caveat here. So one of the main arguments for decentralized GPU marketplaces is that by leveraging latent hardware, you can actually enable cheaper services than using something like AWS or some major incumbent cloud services because you're just taking a piece of GPU that's sitting there doing nothing.
00:46:55.044 - 00:46:55.404, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:46:55.452 - 00:47:52.788, Speaker B: So the theory is that using that GPU you can offer cheaper services than centralized services. But I don't really buy this because historically, if you think about it's not really using latent hardware that enable cheaper services, lower cost, it's really specialization that actually lowers the cost. So if you think about bitcoin mining for example, sure, today you can use your cpu to mine bitcoin, but you won't even be able to cover the cost. It's not efficient enough. You can use the latent cpu on your own laptop to mine bitcoin, but it's not going to be cheap. What is cheap and efficient is the ASICs, the bitmain specialized hardware, the hardware that's specifically designed for bitcoin mining. That stuff is cheap.
00:47:52.788 - 00:47:55.868, Speaker B: It's cheaper than anything else, but it's.
00:47:55.924 - 00:47:58.180, Speaker A: Highly productive and it has speed, right?
00:47:58.300 - 00:47:59.036, Speaker B: It has what?
00:47:59.148 - 00:47:59.676, Speaker A: Speed?
00:47:59.788 - 00:48:02.284, Speaker B: Yeah. Keep it more efficient and faster.
00:48:02.452 - 00:48:02.964, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:48:03.052 - 00:48:23.692, Speaker B: And I think the same thing is going to happen with the GPU marketplaces is it's not that using the latent GPU's that lowers the cost is it's probably going to be the big players who are able to specialize produce specialized AI hardware that lowers the cost.
00:48:23.836 - 00:48:45.992, Speaker A: So then the thesis then is instead of your GPU's sitting around and you put it to work as an example. The better thesis might be that a provider can aggregate these GPU's. Kind of like cloud mining as an example. Could you see that thesis play out instead, instead of having. Yeah, maybe two.
00:48:46.096 - 00:48:46.968, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe.
00:48:47.104 - 00:48:56.824, Speaker A: Okay. Because then if it's co located in one singular data center as an example, then you can provide the same services as other larger providers, right?
00:48:56.872 - 00:49:10.574, Speaker B: I think it's the providers that are able, that can, that are able to lower the cost are those who can procure the latest specialized GPU's or even manufacture them themselves.
00:49:10.742 - 00:49:12.370, Speaker A: So it has to be centralized.
00:49:12.750 - 00:49:14.142, Speaker B: I think it has to be centralized.
00:49:14.206 - 00:49:15.022, Speaker A: It has to be centralized.
00:49:15.086 - 00:49:56.682, Speaker B: The point. Okay, so here's the nuance. I'm skeptical of the thesis that decentralized GPU's can lower the cost, but I do think that there is a reason to do decentralized GPU's, and that is censorship resistance. And that is why, going back to Eric Voorhees project, he's running his product on a cache, which the goal is not to lower costs, but to actually preserve privacy and unbiasedness through decentralization, through censorship resistance. I think that is the point of decentralized GPU's, is censorship resistance, decentralization, privacy, rather than lower cost.
00:49:56.826 - 00:50:21.150, Speaker A: So that's the thesis. We will know that. Okay, so if you're using any social sort of censorship resistant app as an example, then you know that you're not going to get the speed that you're looking for, but you know that you don't have to worry about the app being revoked or et cetera, right? So there is some sort of nuance behavior that the users will know when they're using these types of apps would be the concept. I could buy that. I could buy that thesis.
00:50:22.430 - 00:50:42.678, Speaker B: So AI crypto is big. Also, another part of AI crypto is proven compute off chain compute. So you run some AI inference off chain, and you send the output of that inference on chain as an input to a smart contract.
00:50:42.854 - 00:50:44.646, Speaker A: Okay. Kind of like an oracle.
00:50:44.758 - 00:51:24.320, Speaker B: Kind of, yeah, an oracle. Or even though you can think of it as a L2 AI, specialized L2. You can use ZK to prove the compute. You can use op, and then there's also teams building tee based solution environments to prove the compute. So that's interesting, but it's also a very hard problem. It's unclear to me what the use cases are today, but we'll see. I'm very open minded to that idea, but the thing I'm most excited about in AI crypto is actually not on the infra layer, it's on the app layer.
00:51:24.320 - 00:51:36.588, Speaker B: And we talked about this. We talked about how AI just becoming better and better at generating content and the speed of improvement is crazy. Every three months, you try a new product.
00:51:36.764 - 00:51:37.772, Speaker A: It's insanity.
00:51:37.916 - 00:51:58.034, Speaker B: You feel the magic, very clear improvement compared to three months ago. And then. So you can use AI to generate photos, to generate videos, text based content, et cetera, et cetera, and songs, et cetera, et cetera. And if you layer a crypto incentive component on top of it, I think there could be some magic.
00:51:58.162 - 00:52:14.712, Speaker A: Let's talk about that magic. I think there's one. Maybe we could start with crate, because that's part of our batch. Yeah, I can touch on it quickly. Crate is a platform where you can launch AI generated songs, and each song also has a bounding curve. Where you can trade the token. We call it song coins.
00:52:14.712 - 00:52:46.526, Speaker A: And eventually, when we think about trading attention as an example, right now, attention is primarily in the form of short form content videos. You're starting to see. Giphys as an example is another way that attention is being specialized. And I think the next form of specialization is going to be coins, tokens. And we're already seeing that with meme coins as an example. Song Coins is another example of how songs could go viral. We saw some form of that already on TikTok with man in finance.
00:52:46.526 - 00:53:08.164, Speaker A: If you saw that short form video, it went viral because it did a few things really well. She took her vocals and uploaded on TikTok and then enabled more people to take that vocal, like producers to take that vocal and make songs out of it. So people ended up making song. One song really hit, and it went viral. She ended up signing a deal with capital Records for $100 million or something crazy. I'm not sure about the number, but.
00:53:08.212 - 00:53:10.788, Speaker B: She did sign a deal with the song the summer.
00:53:10.924 - 00:53:13.380, Speaker A: Song of the summer. Yeah. Man in finance.
00:53:13.460 - 00:53:14.560, Speaker B: Man in finance.
00:53:14.860 - 00:53:32.760, Speaker A: And so there is this kind of form of, like, remixing tokens that will start to take shape. And so we think AI generation is like, the kind of the cusp of that. But there are others. I think you're bullish on content video as an example. AI video, maybe, if you want to touch on that.
00:53:33.740 - 00:54:15.330, Speaker B: I mean, it's very similar to songs. It's just like a guy just getting crazy at producing extremely realistic videos. And you can't tell, like, I'm on TikTok, right? Like, I'm on TikTok a lot, maybe half an hour a day. And I think now maybe close to a quarter of all the videos in my TikTok feed are AI generated. It's an insane percentage. And if I don't pay attention, if I'm not careful, I would miss the fact that it's an AI generated video. Oftentimes I see AI generated podcast of Joe Rogan and Elon Musk, for example, and it's so realistic that I think it's real.
00:54:15.330 - 00:54:38.580, Speaker B: I think it's authentic. But there's a little tag at the bottom of the video that says, this is an AI generated. So TikTok now does some crowdsourced authentication, tagging of the AI generated content, but they're so realistic, it's crazy. Oh, another trend is AI girlfriends or maybe later, boyfriend. Yeah.
00:54:38.580 - 00:54:42.012, Speaker A: Think about this. AI Waifus, right?
00:54:42.196 - 00:54:52.358, Speaker B: AI Waifus. Yeah. There's a lot of interesting things here for example, why is it that AI girlfriends are taking off and not AI boyfriend?
00:54:52.414 - 00:55:01.598, Speaker A: Didn't you send me a tweet recently where some guy got addicted to his waifu and he like, pushed. He ended up, like, not going to school or something. You sent me a tweet thread on it recently.
00:55:01.654 - 00:55:32.212, Speaker B: Yeah. It's like someone posted on Reddit that character AI is down and he's just feeling really sad, lonely. Cause he has no one to talk to. I think he's a teenager. But that's the other really interesting thing, which is that character AI is doing really well. That's a web two version of AI companion. And then there's some specialized versions of character AI that are offering AI girlfriends or boyfriends.
00:55:32.212 - 00:55:51.864, Speaker B: Those are also doing really well. I spoke with a few, I saw their numbers. They're doing crazy. They're growing 20% month over month. There's very strong prior market fit. But then the question is, why are these users of AI girlfriends and boyfriend friends, like, mostly young people? That's another thing. That is another trend that I saw.
00:55:51.864 - 00:55:57.496, Speaker B: Most of them are teenagers or people in their early twenties. That's also very interesting.
00:55:57.648 - 00:56:15.544, Speaker A: Yeah, you mentioned this also in our como. One idea you highlighted was the fact that most people are terminally online. And so they have the inability to converse in, like, in the real world with people, but they're much better off conversing online with people.
00:56:15.672 - 00:56:16.168, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:56:16.264 - 00:56:31.160, Speaker A: Or, sorry, with, with characters instead. It's much easier for. Yeah. AI characters. And I think we're already starting to do this, you and I. I mean, like, I talk to Chad GPT every day and. Yeah.
00:56:31.160 - 00:57:16.368, Speaker A: And so I do feel like this behavior for those that are term like, I use chat GPT maybe for 30 minutes a day, 45 minutes. Oh, really? For what? Yeah, you know, proofreading. I talk, you know, like, I don't, like, I think you and I talked about this, but I don't use Google search as much anymore. And then, like, if I want to learn something or like a concept, then, you know, I'll, like, talk it, you know, like, I'll walk through which IGBT to figure out what, where's the missing gap of my, of information that I'm trying to understand. As an example, I use it with my kids for them to get more accustomed to using chat GBT, the voice, being able to talk through it through a voice. I just bought this rabbit r1. I preordered it when it first came out.
00:57:16.368 - 00:57:38.386, Speaker A: I mean, it's an okay device, but it's a device that I give to my kids so they can start to just like, they ask a lot of questions. So I give it to them to get some answers. But I think I'm gonna re. But the LLM on this sucks. So I'm going to reformat it and then use chat GPT on there instead. Catch. GPT is a lot better for just like general purpose info.
00:57:38.386 - 00:57:43.170, Speaker A: So I feel like we're already doing this now. Just add a personality to it and it's over.
00:57:43.330 - 00:57:44.070, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:57:46.450 - 00:57:50.738, Speaker A: It'S a part of the family already. Like, that means already a part of the family.
00:57:50.914 - 00:58:35.310, Speaker B: So I watched Andrew Huberman episode recently. Some of you might know that I'm actually pretty critical of Andrew human, but that one. So his episodes where he interview a guest, those are generally pretty good, actually. So I watched one of the recent episodes where he interviewed a scientist that studies Gen Z, especially teenagers. And basically there is a very depressing stat that goes back all the way to two thousands. But basically the percentage of teenagers that get depression or anxiety during their teenage years has been flat until 2012. And then since 2012, it's been going up nonstop since then.
00:58:35.310 - 00:59:17.438, Speaker B: So it went from, like, I don't know, 10% all the way to 30 40%. And that's especially true for teenage girls. And people wonder why, like, this stat has been around on Twitter a lot as well. And people have been wondering why I 2012 was the year that everything changed. Well, it's kind of obvious in hindsight. That year, or maybe plus or minus three was when social media, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube all took off. And social media basically led to is causally linked to increased depression, anxiety, and more importantly, inability to socialize in real life.
00:59:17.438 - 00:59:38.834, Speaker B: Because all the teenagers nowadays are always on their phone, right? Like when they go out and hang out with other kids. I see that on my nephews, by the way. I have two nephews. They're like, in their teenage years, and they're constantly on their phone. I mean, so am I. But when I'm with other people, I still talk to them. But when those kids hang out with other kids, they don't really interact with each other.
00:59:38.834 - 01:00:07.132, Speaker B: They're always on their phone. So the year 2012 was, was a big year. And I think that was also directly responsible for the fact that AI girlfriends and boyfriends are taking off right now because people have lost their ability to interact with other humans in real life to find real boyfriends and girlfriends. It's a lot easier. It takes a lot less effort to get an AI girlfriend and to talk to her.
01:00:07.276 - 01:00:09.760, Speaker A: So much easier. You don't have to play the game.
01:00:09.860 - 01:00:32.936, Speaker B: You don't have to play the game. It's so much easier. So that's going to be a mega trend. But anyway, the reason why I'm talking about this is that I've seen some teams building AI girlfriend or boyfriend and tokenized AI girlfriends. So you have AI character, and that's on chain in the form of a NFT or fungible token or 404, for example. I'm also open minded to that idea.
01:00:33.128 - 01:00:44.546, Speaker A: I think that's already happening. I mean, even if you look at you and I. Maybe my. I'll use myself as an example. It's. I used to be much more, you know, open and talking to people. Now I've just become more reserved over time.
01:00:44.546 - 01:00:47.186, Speaker A: I mean, it's just natural because you're always on your phone and computer.
01:00:47.298 - 01:00:48.690, Speaker B: I think that's just you getting old.
01:00:48.810 - 01:00:52.218, Speaker A: Fuck, it's over, guys.
01:00:52.274 - 01:00:59.802, Speaker B: But there's a, there's a clear distinction between people who are born before the two thousands, the year 2000 and after the year 2000.
01:00:59.866 - 01:01:02.482, Speaker A: And obviously, so the pre boomer boomerang.
01:01:02.666 - 01:01:12.960, Speaker B: Yeah. Call it millennial. Pre millennial. Millennial and Gen Z. Yeah. So the millennial generation did not grow up on social media. That makes sense.
01:01:12.960 - 01:01:27.584, Speaker B: When I was 16 or something, I don't think Facebook. Instagram. Instagram didn't even exist, I think. And Facebook was not as prevalent. But Gen Z, today, they grew up on social media.
01:01:27.712 - 01:01:28.136, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:01:28.208 - 01:01:31.252, Speaker B: Which is really, really, really bad for their mental health.
01:01:31.416 - 01:01:42.292, Speaker A: Yeah. Just speaking on AI girlfriends and boyfriends or whatnot. How would this pack crypto? How would they use crypto? Would these be tradable personalities?
01:01:42.476 - 01:02:05.610, Speaker B: Yeah, it's going to be in the form of nfts or fungible tokens or even a hybrid 404 hybrid, if you remember. And those could be speculatable. To be honest, I think the intersection between the two might be a little bit forced. But I'm open to the possibility. I'm open to the possibility of AI characters on chain.
01:02:06.390 - 01:02:09.370, Speaker A: AI characters on chain. What does that mean?
01:02:10.030 - 01:02:12.910, Speaker B: A speculatable creator. A creator that.
01:02:12.950 - 01:02:14.558, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:02:14.694 - 01:02:29.418, Speaker B: Think of a fantasy. Fantasy cards, but for AI characters instead of real Twitter creators. Or think of a friend tech, but with AI characters rather than real people. Yeah, I could see that.
01:02:29.554 - 01:02:38.514, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, there are already a lot of, I mean, I know at least one or two really popular Instagram, I think. AI creators.
01:02:38.602 - 01:02:39.418, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
01:02:39.474 - 01:02:40.690, Speaker A: Purely AI. Right.
01:02:40.770 - 01:02:41.322, Speaker B: Right.
01:02:41.466 - 01:02:54.830, Speaker A: And I think they have millions of followers. It's pretty insane. So they could release a token and people could buy that token and get access to the creator for one on one chats. Does that remind you of something?
01:02:56.330 - 01:02:59.218, Speaker B: Yeah. So frantic for. But with AI characters.
01:02:59.394 - 01:03:00.946, Speaker A: Yeah. Or onlyfans.
01:03:01.018 - 01:03:20.140, Speaker B: Or onlyfans. Yeah, yeah. That's, that's where you were alluding to. You told me that only some of the only Onlyfans girl, or not you, but one of the abolish. Yeah. One of the founders told us that onlyfans, some of the Onlyfans girls have are using AI chat botanical. They don't want to deal with the sense.
01:03:20.180 - 01:03:48.456, Speaker A: Yeah. So it turns out, like, which I didn't know. But OnlyFans, as an example, a bulk of the revenue comes from just messages. It isn't the monthly subscription. Cause I guess every group girl has a monthly subscription. And if you buy the subscription, then the goal is for them to message you back and forth. And each message, I think there's a cost to it, and that's how they make their money.
01:03:48.456 - 01:04:12.140, Speaker A: Apparently, the creators make their money. It's through messaging. And now more and more Onlyfan creators are leveraging bots, and they have agencies, but then they also have bots. And these bots do the convo, and they try to send unique pictures or something, and they can unlock it for more money. And so this kind of the messaging is the most important revenue generator for Onlyfans, apparently.
01:04:12.200 - 01:04:15.076, Speaker B: Interesting. So people pay per message.
01:04:15.228 - 01:04:28.400, Speaker A: They pay to message. I'm not sure if it's per message, but I do know that that is the bulk of their revenue comes from messaging and unlocking a picture through messages.
01:04:28.980 - 01:04:34.004, Speaker B: You know what it reminds me of? It reminds me of earn. Earn.com balances thing.
01:04:34.132 - 01:04:34.668, Speaker A: Oh, yeah.
01:04:34.724 - 01:04:40.994, Speaker B: Pay to message and earn to reply. Reply to earn. Yeah, but in the context of.
01:04:41.122 - 01:05:29.388, Speaker A: Yeah, well, technically, time, that fund sort of solved that, right? In a different manner, which is if you were to buy someone's time, as an example. Okay, so think of time for our audience that don't know time, that fun is part of our next batch. But think of it this way. Everyone's time or is on a bonding curve, and there's some value associated with, with each of the minute that the creator has on chain. So if I wanted to buy, let's say, nikita beer as an example, I can buy his time right now at, like, $60 a minute. And if you want to redeem those minutes, you have to redeem them at a 15 minutes increments so that I could book time with him and actually have a one on one conversation with them. So that's like, the one on one right.
01:05:29.388 - 01:05:38.656, Speaker A: But you could also buy some minutes and then use that as a way to message them. So I could buy a minute and I could redeem that 1 minute to send them. Send them a message.
01:05:38.808 - 01:05:50.200, Speaker B: So, and interestingly, someone arp. Or maybe it's not an Arp. Maybe some people didn't do it purposely. But the price on intro. Intro dot co or intro.com. but whatever.
01:05:50.280 - 01:05:51.976, Speaker A: The web two intro co.
01:05:52.088 - 01:06:08.234, Speaker B: Intro Co. That's the web two version of time fund. The price on Intro Co. Converged and the price on time fun converged to each other. For Nikita beer to, like, for a bit.
01:06:08.362 - 01:06:09.354, Speaker A: Yeah, for a bit.
01:06:09.482 - 01:06:10.570, Speaker B: For a bit. Okay.
01:06:10.730 - 01:06:25.754, Speaker A: Then obviously the market crashed, but I saw someone's tweet when that launch, and someone like, damn it, I just spent dollar 93 a minute on Nikita bear. I could have gotten it for $60.
01:06:25.882 - 01:06:32.018, Speaker B: Yeah, but you cannot exit your position on intro code.
01:06:32.114 - 01:06:33.394, Speaker A: You can. You can.
01:06:33.522 - 01:06:41.310, Speaker B: Whereas on time dot fund, that's the beauty of crypto. You can, if you, if you decide not to talk to Nikita beer anymore, you can dump it. You dump it.
01:06:41.810 - 01:07:07.296, Speaker A: Which, which I think, I believe this is the way the product should be. You should allow anyone to be a creator. Time should be liquid. And, you know, because sometimes those creators aren't in demand anymore, and they want to still make money, but they can't because they don't know if the price is too high or not. Right. I, and so the market will tell you whether you're good or not, which is reality, but it's a real form of reality for creators.
01:07:07.488 - 01:07:31.858, Speaker B: I think we're going off a tangent a little bit, but I think we're pretty much done with AI. We spent quite a bit of time on AI. I feel like there's, oh, I do want to talk about a very big theme, which is financial nihilism and the fact that everyone is extremely jaded, especially some of the ogs. The traders are always jaded. The traders on Twitter, they're always so emotional. Yeah. They're always bearish crypto.
01:07:31.858 - 01:08:16.534, Speaker B: Like, they think everything is a scam. But there's also signs of, like, you know, long term people, you know, people who work in the industry or even investors getting jaded, getting nihilist, nihilistic about the industry. I think that was partly, that was what led to the meme coin mania and also resolve it. Like, there's a self reinforcing effect between the meme coin mania and the nihilism. But I do want to address it because I think what people are seeing on Twitter is not the reality, it's not the full picture. They're seeing a very small bubble. I think what's happening outside crypto, outside of crypto Twitter, is that the most important thing is that stable coins are taking the world by storm.
01:08:16.534 - 01:08:57.546, Speaker B: And I have more and more conviction by the day that stable coins are a big deal. And it's actually creating value. It's not a zero sum game, and it's today, probably the most important application, nonspeculative application of crypto. And I see that in every aspect. I talk to, like, maybe one stable coin, one or two stablecoin startups per week, and every single one of them that has a live product is growing 1020 percent month over month, if not more. The growth is so compelling, the market actually pulls them into 1020 percent month over month growth. And that is consistent across the world.
01:08:57.546 - 01:09:21.298, Speaker B: It's not just Latin America, but also Africa, Middle East, Turkey especially, and Southeast Asia across the world in developing countries. And people on crypto Twitter don't see that because they're, you know, they're always attracted to the highly volatile crypto assets and they're generally us centric. So they don't care. They either don't care about what's happening in the rest of the world or they're not interested.
01:09:21.354 - 01:09:25.146, Speaker A: But they're not interested because they use the product every day. They don't need the product.
01:09:25.258 - 01:09:29.786, Speaker B: Exactly. They use the product every day. They send each other stable coins. They send stable coins to exchanges.
01:09:29.938 - 01:09:35.170, Speaker A: Zelle. I mean, for us, it's not a big deal. For the rest of the world, it's a very big deal. So we're living in our own bubble.
01:09:35.290 - 01:10:12.968, Speaker B: And so, okay, so there's actually just zooming into stablecoins right now. There's two main distinct use cases. One is currency hedging. So in the US, us people don't need stable coins because their currency is the us dollar. Europe, Japan, or some of the developing countries, their currency are doing okay. So they don't really need a us based stable coin. But in countries where their local currency is depreciating 1020, 30% per year, they can actually use stable coins as a currency hedge.
01:10:12.968 - 01:10:50.620, Speaker B: And a lot of them happen to not have access to any bank accounts. They're unbanked. And crypto gives them a way to bank themselves and to store their hard earned money in the form of stablecoins. So currency hedging, that's one. The other one is cross border payment. So people paying each other across countries, across jurisdictions, because international swift is extremely slow. I was actually talking to someone who worked on Swift, who engineered, who built the system for Swift at one of the major banks, was talking to him about why Swift is so slow.
01:10:50.620 - 01:11:17.534, Speaker B: And he told me that the tech itself is actually not that slow. The settlement could be instant, but it's all the layers, the bureaucratic layers that the human labor, the manual processes sitting on top of swift that makes it extremely, extremely slow. So if you make an international payment today, international wire transfer, it'll take three days at least to settle. But stablecoins is instant and it's basically free.
01:11:17.702 - 01:11:59.058, Speaker A: You know, like, as you were talking, I just remembered something very interesting, which was I was sitting at a restaurant in Dubai, because I was at token 2049 and I was eating. And then I kept hearing someone talking about stable coins or like, USDT. And I turned to him, I'm like, are you in crypto? He goes, no. And it was some guy from one of the Middle east countries. And what he was telling me what he was doing was he was essentially operating an OTC desk via WhatsApp, using USDT. And I'm like, what brings you here? I'm like, he goes, oh, I stay here. But all my family members are in, I think, Jordan or something.
01:11:59.058 - 01:12:15.450, Speaker A: I think Jordan, but all his clients live within the Middle east. And what he does is he essentially like, does OTC for USDT, for all of the people that are connected to him. And I thought that was just very interesting. And that kind of gives you an idea of how mature the market's getting that people don't understand.
01:12:15.610 - 01:12:19.920, Speaker B: It's really happening across the world, outside developing countries.
01:12:20.260 - 01:13:06.230, Speaker A: And, you know, it's. It's kind of like, you know, here in the states in the early days, we had these. I don't know if you remember this, but we have like, these smaller shops called currency exchanges. Remember those? Currency exchanges everywhere? Even in, like, in Chicago, people go there mostly to cash in their check or get their DMV licenses or whatever. You know, they have other services that they offer locally, but at one point they were like a currency exchange. And I feel like these types of firms are just going to become like WhatsApp, OTC desks across the world, and they're just going to find a way for people to get access to the USDT or USDC, and they're going to do this types of local currencies. So that's kind of the way it's looking right now.
01:13:06.230 - 01:13:18.234, Speaker A: But then you're going to start to see more real firms building real products. So accrue and go bankless is an example. Is a perfect example of what's happening in Africa. And so maybe if you want to.
01:13:18.242 - 01:13:49.454, Speaker B: Talk about that, I mean, yeah, again, it's across regions, across every continent, except for Antarctica. North America is Mexico, mainly the entire Latin America. Europe is eastern Europe, the entire Africa, inter Africa, and then Asia is Southeast Asia. And so every continent is happening. But also the type of customers are heterogeneous. It's not just consumers. It's not just retail people.
01:13:49.454 - 01:14:37.442, Speaker B: It's not just individuals paying each other, but also businesses paying each other in USDT, for example, there's oil exporters in Asia paying their shadow banking importers in Africa, for example, and settling USDT, because settling in fiat, whatever, fiat is much, much slower and more expensive. And there's businesses, non crypto native businesses, paying each other in stable coins, paying employees, playing in vendors, doing business to business transactions in stable coins. So it's happening across regions, but also happening across types of customers, both retail and businesses.
01:14:37.586 - 01:15:18.326, Speaker A: Yeah. So it turns out shadow banking is a $57 trillion market. I was just looking at the numbers where shadow banking is a concept where you're not reliant on the traditional financial system. You have this kind of black market for dollars. And I hear so many examples of this in South America, where there's private dealers, where people get access to dollars in some shape, and they're able to allow people to get access to dollars in some shape or form, that market is $57 trillion, which I wasn't aware it was that big. And so stablecoin could likely eat that market first, is the way I see it.
01:15:18.438 - 01:16:10.336, Speaker B: And you know what's interesting? The banks and the central banks don't know what's happening. They know that there's this thing that's happening, but they can't see the. They can't track the transactions, individual transactions, because, yeah, the on ramp and off ramp are KYC, but after, like, the in between, all the on chain transactions are not KYC. Often what's happening is, let's say I on ramp into USDT from a fiat currency, and there's a market maker, an OTC desk or whatever, that handles this transaction for me. Okay. But what's happening under the hood is there is a fiat transaction happening, right? Like, I send the USDT or a stablecoin, and then the market maker will handle the on chain transaction. They send me the USDT on chain.
01:16:10.336 - 01:16:37.962, Speaker B: But the two worlds are separate, even though they're handled by the same player. And so the banks can only see one side, they can only see that what's happening in the banking world, the fiat transactions, they have no idea what's happening on the other side. So they don't know that there's on ramp, off ramp happening, and they don't know, they cannot associate, they cannot identify the type of transactions just by looking at the fiat half of this transaction.
01:16:38.106 - 01:16:46.628, Speaker A: So just on that point, to me, it seems that it's in the US's best interest to scale us 100% in their best interest.
01:16:46.724 - 01:16:55.076, Speaker B: It'll probably extend the longevity of the United States dollars by, I don't know, a decade or two.
01:16:55.268 - 01:17:10.156, Speaker A: And so there is this concept of our dollar, or the US's dollar being what keeps the US in power. A lot of the controls that they have across the globe is really primarily predicated on the dollar.
01:17:10.228 - 01:17:16.592, Speaker B: It's what allows the US to print money infinitely, as long as the us dollar is the world reserve currency.
01:17:16.696 - 01:18:09.704, Speaker A: So there's a concept what's happening right now, which is like this multipolar world, right, that we're starting to move into, which is the west versus the east, right. China, Russia, and other parts of the world, where even Middle east is an example, where they're starting to move away from the dollar as a medium of exchange for oil and other like, export import products. And so were already starting to see some de risking happening from those countries. But interestingly, USDC, USDT is countering that with the growth of what people are doing every day. So it seems like even though the countries are starting to move away from it, it turns out that people still want access to the dollar. So although were going to live in a multipolar world, and sure, maybe US is plateauing in terms of power, as youre mentioning, the plateauing could extend for another ten to 20 years, just because the dollar is becoming so accessible through USDC use. USDT.
01:18:09.792 - 01:18:49.128, Speaker B: Have you ever seen a redalio chart? He plotted like, seven different factors for every country, every major power. So, for example, education, economic power, military power, and their national currency dominance, and three other things. But these are just to give you an idea what some of the lines are on that chart. And it turns out that throughout the history, the reserve currency tends to be a lagging indicator. It's a result of a nation rising or falling. So education is the first thing. Actually, education leads everything else.
01:18:49.128 - 01:19:24.840, Speaker B: Education leads, economic power, leads, military power, et cetera, et cetera. But all these things lead the reserve currency dominance or the status of the reserve currency. So the reserve currency, the US dollar, the reserve currency of the US dollar is actually the last thing to go. So even if, like a lot of people say, the US is in late empire, so on and so forth, I would probably agree, by the way. But let's say that's true. Even if that's true, the US dollar still has a long time to go. Right.
01:19:24.840 - 01:19:40.950, Speaker B: And you know, I don't think the reserve currency status of the US dollar will, will end anytime soon, despite the effort of all the BrICS countries working together on creating new currencies. And the stable coins will probably extend that even further.
01:19:41.890 - 01:19:55.484, Speaker A: It's going to be fun to see how all of this plays out. So stablecoins is r1 world assets. Just touching on that since it's. Unless you have something else to add, it's early.
01:19:55.532 - 01:20:05.380, Speaker B: It's still early, but I would say it's. I wouldn't say it's one of the major trends in the first half of the year, but it's probably going to be one of the up and coming trends.
01:20:05.500 - 01:20:06.020, Speaker A: What is.
01:20:06.100 - 01:20:07.788, Speaker B: Sorry, the real world assets.
01:20:07.844 - 01:20:08.852, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay. Real world assets.
01:20:08.916 - 01:20:56.416, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean real world assets is, is a super, super set of stable coins. Like stablecoins is a type of rwas, right. But specifically here we're talking about tokenized us treasuries, tokenized us stocks, US real estate, et cetera, et cetera. It's still early, but there's, there's a strong reason, like tokenized T bills has for me, they have proven product market fit easily because, you know, instead of holding the US dollar on chain, if you don't, if you're not going to do anything with the US dollar, you might as well want to earn 5% on top of it. Right. So I think there's like both the anecdotes and the data suggest that US T bills tokenized on chain are taking off.
01:20:56.416 - 01:21:24.892, Speaker B: Especially with the likes of Blackrock, Franklin, Templeton, all these big trad five players like launching their own t bill fund on chain. And then the next is probably going to be us stocks and us real estate. Some of the highest quality liquid or illiquid assets from the United States. And basically the idea is to export them to the rest of the world through a global ledger.
01:21:25.076 - 01:21:56.080, Speaker A: Whats interesting about this concept is that like an example, ive gone to Southeast Asia many times. I love the food there, the culture there. It turns out Malaysia as an example is primarily a muslim country. So they cant leverage trade or derivative trade. They have to do things bye the religion, but the way they get their yield because they can't like, it's against their religion to borrow and do leverage trade. So that's kind of the concept. So they have to get yield from some sort of like real sustainable way.
01:21:56.080 - 01:22:14.542, Speaker A: And so the way they get their yield today is from just longing s and P 500. That's it. That's how. That's how they get their yield. And so they have these huge structured products that's only available to, like, you know, the. The ultra high net worth or high net worth families. But everyday people really can't get access to this type of.
01:22:14.542 - 01:22:31.942, Speaker A: This form of assets. And so if this was to become unchained and completely liquid and accessible via an app, I could see these types of countries start to onboard retail to these types of asset classes, which is a very big enabler.
01:22:32.046 - 01:22:34.936, Speaker B: And there's what, like 2 billion at least Muslims.
01:22:35.048 - 01:22:48.760, Speaker A: 2 billion Muslims. That's just one market. I'm not even talking about India as an example, which is this, you know, 1.3 billion, you know, population. Is it 1.3 now or is it 2 billion? I don't even know.
01:22:48.840 - 01:22:50.408, Speaker B: 1.41.4.
01:22:50.464 - 01:22:51.768, Speaker A: Yeah, 1.4.
01:22:51.864 - 01:23:06.650, Speaker B: I know your numbers better than you do. I know that because India just surpassed China, China is 1.4. India is like 1.4, slightly higher. So India is now the world's most popular country.
01:23:06.990 - 01:23:21.490, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, I went there six months ago and like, it's insanity. Like, my city went from, like, the small city to now. Like, if I want to get anywhere, it's gonna take me an hour. It's insanity. It's insanity.
01:23:21.950 - 01:23:30.076, Speaker B: And also there's a. There's Russia and China. Citizens both want the us assets.
01:23:30.228 - 01:23:30.748, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:23:30.844 - 01:23:57.790, Speaker B: And the reason for that is, or it's a little bit different for the two countries, but in Russia is because they get sanctioned by the US. They want us assets, but they get sanctioned. And the way to solve that is put assets on chain. As long as you have a way to get on chain, you would be able to get access to us assets through the tokenized versions of them. China is slightly different. China is because the government doesn't want you to. Is capital control.
01:23:57.790 - 01:24:25.156, Speaker B: They don't want you to. It's very hard to open a brokerage account that supports us stocks or treasuries. And it turns out that it's easier for chinese citizens to get on binance to open a binance account than to open a brokerage account for us stocks. A lot of people actually don't know this. On crypto Twitter. People think China banned crypto, blah, blah, blah. But that's actually not true as a chinese citizen.
01:24:25.156 - 01:24:32.108, Speaker B: It's actually easier for a chinese citizen to open a binance account than it is for a us citizen to open a binance account.
01:24:32.244 - 01:24:33.920, Speaker A: US is the problem here, guys.
01:24:35.100 - 01:24:53.914, Speaker B: So the point is, if you want to buy a high quality us based asset and currently you don't have access to it, as long as you can get on chain, you can buy those us assets through the tokenized versions.
01:24:54.082 - 01:25:07.298, Speaker A: Isn't this another form of like the iron grip that the US is creating? Like the iron grip is through the dollar as an example, the iron grip through tokenized equities. Tokenized real estate. Yep.
01:25:07.394 - 01:25:38.480, Speaker B: So I think the us government should be in full, full support of RWAs. It's exporting. Exporting the best thing that the US has to the rest of the world, which is assets that go up only. If you look at the stock markets around the world, it's like they don't. Okay, so Europe has been flat for the last decade or two. Yeah, Japan had a, Japan just had a lost decade or the last two decades, but it recently made all time high. China is flat.
01:25:38.480 - 01:26:07.224, Speaker B: So the chinese stock market doesn't match the economic growth at all. The economy is up only and the stock market is down only. So around the world, the stock markets don't do well compared to the US. And the us stock market is one of the best things that the US has that you can export to the rest of the world through rwas. Anyway. I think that's a small trend, but I think over the first half of the year. But it's probably up and coming.
01:26:07.352 - 01:26:19.088, Speaker A: Yeah, this is going to take time, but it's also very interesting to see. So we've talked about nfts, we've talked about meme coins, rwas, AI.
01:26:19.224 - 01:26:47.352, Speaker B: I think there is also an overarching theme of just the regulatory environment getting much more friendly over the last six months. So, first of all, with the SEC approving the Ethereum ETF, withdrawing their investigation into Ethereum as a security, getting sued left and right by crypto native organizations like consensus and Trump supporting, supporting crypto.
01:26:47.456 - 01:26:54.512, Speaker A: He'S actually, today he's going to be probably headlining the bitcoin event in Miami. That happens every year.
01:26:54.616 - 01:26:57.840, Speaker B: Like, he's speaking there in person based.
01:26:57.880 - 01:27:03.744, Speaker A: On the news he is speaking there or he's in talks to speak there, is what they said. That's insane.
01:27:03.872 - 01:27:26.912, Speaker B: So we, I mean, the first half of the year, we got, we got two ETF's, we got the BTC ETF approved and trading in. Was it January, Jan or Feb? Yeah, and then we just got the Ethereum ETF. But interestingly, I was talking to, according to a pretty trusted source of mine who's close to one of the five. You know, there's five commissioner.
01:27:26.936 - 01:27:32.442, Speaker A: SEC commissioners, like the five families in New York. Right. The mob.
01:27:32.586 - 01:27:43.750, Speaker B: The mob that vote on approval, approving or denying the ETF's. Like, Gensler is one of them. He said that there won't be another ETF anytime soon.
01:27:44.090 - 01:27:45.826, Speaker A: So that catalyst is gone.
01:27:45.938 - 01:27:48.762, Speaker B: So no more doge ETF, no more.
01:27:48.786 - 01:27:52.458, Speaker A: Doge, no more cultural coin ETF, and.
01:27:52.474 - 01:27:54.796, Speaker B: No solana ETf anytime soon.
01:27:54.948 - 01:28:13.960, Speaker A: And maybe that could change in the next few years, but for now, I think we have way too many ETF's anyways. BTCE. Good. Let's start with that. And once we get some, you know, once we get a good holding within the markets, then I think introducing more asset classes makes sense. More ETF's, I mean, makes sense.
01:28:14.980 - 01:28:31.380, Speaker B: So the impact of that is, uh, in the foreseeable future, btc and ETH are going to be Pve, and the rest of the crypto will be Pvp.
01:28:31.680 - 01:28:35.000, Speaker A: PvE meaning player versus everyone. Versus player versus player.
01:28:35.120 - 01:28:37.240, Speaker B: Player versus. Yeah. Player versus environment.
01:28:37.360 - 01:28:38.824, Speaker A: Player versus environment, yeah.
01:28:38.992 - 01:28:43.352, Speaker B: Um, because the environment in this case, being the. The tri five flow.
01:28:43.416 - 01:29:07.100, Speaker A: Yeah. So it'll be very interesting to see how. How those. How the, you know, people are saying that, which I tend to agree with, the crypto markets are becoming much more mature, and so we won't see the volatility that we have in the past or extreme volatility. Right. We'll see. We'll still get drawdowns, but probably won't be as extreme, at least for those two asset classes.
01:29:07.100 - 01:29:09.832, Speaker A: For the rest, probably so.
01:29:09.976 - 01:29:15.196, Speaker B: And we will see more dispersion among the assets.
01:29:15.348 - 01:29:16.820, Speaker A: I mean, we're already seeing dispersion.
01:29:16.900 - 01:29:32.436, Speaker B: We're already seeing dispersion, but the ETF will probably create even more dispersion, because there's now two types of very different market participants, the traffi and the crypto natives, the casino and the millennial casino and the boomer casino.
01:29:32.548 - 01:29:49.814, Speaker A: Yeah. And so these two. Yeah. I think one's gonna behave more like the stock market. The other could behave more secular in terms of where our sentiment is and how much liquidity is actually being inflowed. It'll be fun. What do you think? We haven't touched on this.
01:29:49.814 - 01:30:14.318, Speaker A: I mean, we did, sort of, but we talked a bit about the consumer markets and how we're obviously very bullish consumer, we have a handful of consumer apps that came through our program. We've talked about pump, we've talked about fantasy time, and many others are coming down the pipeline. Um, where do you think we are in the launching of consumer apps? Are we in the MySpace era?
01:30:14.454 - 01:30:15.182, Speaker B: Probably.
01:30:15.326 - 01:30:55.210, Speaker A: Um, I don't think, you know, we haven't, I don't think we've, we have seen yet like a Facebook like product. Even MySpace, we haven't seen that yet. But I think that's kind of where we're ramping up towards is one breakout app that is going to touch a lot of people. I mean, obviously you have Phantom, but I see it as more of a wallet. And primarily, I think what people mostly do with Phantom is just go on Jupiter and trade shitcoins, is what I see. So I do think there is a very big opportunity for a consumer app to really win here, and we're talking 100 million users. And my thesis is that the founders are going to build this, are probably going to be less crypto native than we think.
01:30:55.210 - 01:31:18.150, Speaker A: I think that to build a really good consumer app, you have to be more consumer than crypto, possibly, the way I feel about this. And maybe we could talk about this, but, you know, I feel as if the consumer, if you're more crypto native, then you get bogged down with crypto mentality, right? Oh, it needs to have this, this feature, that feature, that feature. And in actuality, it needs to be simple and dumb as possible.
01:31:18.650 - 01:31:41.560, Speaker B: I mean, again, like, arguably the consumer products are happening on top of stable coins. Like, there's a lot of really fast growing stablecoin apps that are built by normies that are just very knowledgeable about their local markets. And they're not degens by any means in the product. They build abstract away crypto completely, but we haven't.
01:31:41.680 - 01:32:25.882, Speaker A: So. Okay, so what's happening here is that we're starting to see some startups build on top of stable coins, but nothing break out yet. I haven't seen anything breaking out yet. We're seeing some breakneck speed growth. I think go bankless was one, right, in Africa as an example. But we haven't seen anything yet that's really amassed a lot of users. And so I do think, at least in the US, I do think we'll see a consumer app that's going to go viral and everyone's going to download and use it, and it's going to be primarily a tool to get access to shitcoins to start eventually, then you could bake in other types of features and products to make it look more different than just a trading terminal.
01:32:25.882 - 01:32:51.234, Speaker A: But to start, that's the wedge into the market. There's about six startups that are building for this space already and they're all very Gen Z focused. Like, it's really interesting to see this space develop, but there's already like six or seven startups that are building a trading terminal. But it's going to be more fun and social and, and I would say like the average TikTok user. So I do think we'll see something here soon.
01:32:51.402 - 01:33:36.190, Speaker B: The other day I made the comparison that crypto today is quite similar to Nvidia today or AI today, which is also very similar to the.com, back in two thousands, which is that there is a lot of infra and there's a lot of infra that works, that is solving real problems and is attracting a lot of liquidity and investments. So all the, in the last couple of years, layer ones, L2s, attracted a lot of liquidity investments and they work. Right? Same thing with Nvidia. Like, Nvidia is now the most valuable company in the S and P 500, sucking all the liquidity into it. And their chips are amazing. And also, back in two thousands, during the.com
01:33:36.190 - 01:34:10.250, Speaker B: bubble, there was Cisco and intel building infra. But during all these three periods and verticals, there aren't that many good consumer apps to invest in yet. There is none. Right? Back in two thousands, I guess Google was Google even born in 2000, Facebook was certainly not there today. AI apps, there aren't that many great consumer apps yet, although a lot of them are up and coming. They're growing, but none is mainstream. And same thing with crypto, crypto consumer apps.
01:34:10.250 - 01:34:23.082, Speaker B: There's a lot of consumer apps that are doing very well, but I wouldn't say they are mainstream yet. So I think we're at the same stage across these two different periods and verticals. And what happened?
01:34:23.106 - 01:34:25.866, Speaker A: I agree with that, by the way. I agree with that.
01:34:25.978 - 01:35:20.160, Speaker B: Right. So what happened during the ten years, the decade post the.com bubble, post the collapse of the.com bubble was that there was a plethora of consumer applications, Internet, consumer based applications that went to mainstream Google, Facebook and so on and so forth, that reached actually a billion users, if not more, during the decade. Posted the collapse so you took a decade for the whole Internet, quote unquote, Internet industry to go from all in on infra to all in on apps. And it also turns out that once the apps reach the mainstream, they accrue more value than the infra layer. If you think about on the most valuable companies, Internet companies, it's Facebook, Google, the stuff that's consumer facing rather than Cisco or Intel.
01:35:20.160 - 01:35:45.104, Speaker B: In hindsight, it's not surprising. If you own the end users, you have the most bargaining power against the rest of the supply chain, and you can recruit those value. I think the similar thing will happen to Nvidia, to the AI space today and crypto space today. So in the coming years, there's going to be more and more AI based consumer applications. It might take five to ten years. I don't know. I don't know how long it's going to take.
01:35:45.104 - 01:36:04.354, Speaker B: But there will be AI based consumer applications that will end up accruing more value than Nvidia or chip designers or manufacturers like TSM. And there will be crypto based consumer applications that reach the mainstream that will accrue more value than their underlying layer ones or L2s.
01:36:04.482 - 01:36:48.740, Speaker A: We're already seeing that. I mean, even if you think about what I mean by accruing value, we talked about, I put a tweet out a couple months ago that said, the fat protocol thesis is dead and we're starting to see some days where pump fun ended up making more money than L2s, as an example, and one time surpassed Solana. Anatoly tweeted out, when people are talking shit, as usual, anatoly is like, this is exactly what I want. I want apps to create more value for users and for themselves as a way to show that they have product market fit and growth. And so what you're saying is absolutely true, which is we need to see apps that are create more value than the layer one. Layer twos are the space. They should become commoditized.
01:36:49.040 - 01:36:56.560, Speaker B: I'm pretty sure that is what's going to happen. The only question in my mind is, is it going to take two years or five years or ten years?
01:36:56.680 - 01:37:08.392, Speaker A: Yeah. You know, crypto is reflexive, and things that may take a few years will usually happen in a year or less. Right? That's just the way it plays out every time.
01:37:08.496 - 01:37:28.720, Speaker B: Yeah. Like, things do get faster and faster. Like, it took the Internet maybe ten years to go from infra dominated to app dominated. For crypto, it might take five years. Like, technology just gets better and developers work faster, consumers are more open to new ideas because of social media. They all tell each other about new products, et cetera, et cetera.
01:37:28.760 - 01:38:23.656, Speaker A: So there's this concept of a 30 year paradigm shift, right, where the Internet takes 30 years to mature, as an example, I forgot where I read it. I read it in one of the books, but I'll find out in a second. Let's say that crypto entered into existence 2008, 2009. And so the first ten years was primarily infra driven, right? The next ten years should be some sort of application driven. And then the last ten years is really where the maturity happens and we start to see real full scale world apps. And so like the Internet as an example, the second decade was where Google was born, where Facebook was born, and all of these like large incumbents that we see today were born. And so it would be interesting to see even in the hardware, if you look at like the computer industry hardware, hardware, like hardware in the fifties, 30 years of growth there.
01:38:23.656 - 01:38:50.580, Speaker A: And now we have some winners like Dell and Compaq or whatever, not compact, but Dell and Compact got acquired by Dell or some shit like that. But yeah, so you have these hardware or Lenovo, right? So you have the hardware now they're commoditized business. Right? Like the airline industry software. Right. You kind of have that already with Microsoft and others, but you know, there's a wedge with cloud and et cetera. So I feel as if this is kind of where we are in the space. Very early days, though.
01:38:50.580 - 01:38:51.156, Speaker A: What was that?
01:38:51.188 - 01:38:53.956, Speaker B: I think that the 30 year paradigm gets shorter and shorter.
01:38:54.028 - 01:38:56.920, Speaker A: Shorter, yeah. And why do you think that way?
01:38:58.220 - 01:39:39.220, Speaker B: It seems to me that all the, all the SS curves, like the adoption curve, all the new technologies over the last hundred years become shorter and shorter. Empirically that's true, but also theoretically that makes sense because new technologies enable people to work faster, chat, GPT enabled developers to build faster. And then there's social media that helps products go viral more quickly, information flows more freely, people are more open minded to new products, new technologies because of social media. So the whole s curve just gets more squeezed. Smaller and smaller, things become, things go get to full adoption mainstream faster and faster.
01:39:39.380 - 01:39:40.120, Speaker A: Cool.
01:39:40.740 - 01:39:41.900, Speaker B: Any predictions?
01:39:42.060 - 01:39:47.604, Speaker A: Well, for the rest of the year I am going to. Well, we didn't even talk about tan yet. Telegram.
01:39:47.692 - 01:39:53.012, Speaker B: Oh yeah, Tan. Yeah, tan is actually a big theme for the first half of the year.
01:39:53.076 - 01:40:02.192, Speaker A: Yeah, it turns out it's becoming, yeah, I mean, like Pantera as an example is launching a whole second fund. Just invest in tonight.
01:40:02.206 - 01:40:02.644, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:40:02.772 - 01:40:24.284, Speaker A: And so Tan is becoming very big. We've had some internal breakout apps already trouble. Right. I mean, the thesis is very simple, right? A billion users on telegram. We've seen successes like WeChat in China as an example. We're seeing this with like WhatsApp in South America. And the user base, interestingly, I looked at some numbers, high level.
01:40:24.284 - 01:40:28.450, Speaker A: Turns out the largest, one of the large demographics on telegram is India.
01:40:28.570 - 01:40:29.394, Speaker B: Oh, really?
01:40:29.562 - 01:40:33.430, Speaker A: 150 million people, which is okay. It's a sizable number.
01:40:34.050 - 01:40:51.130, Speaker B: The CI. I also did some research, the CIS. So basically, the former Soviet Union, et cetera. It's about 250 million users on telegram. 200 million users on telegram. But obviously that's many different countries.
01:40:51.290 - 01:41:14.276, Speaker A: Yeah. And there was like maybe 30 to 40 million Americans around there. So, yeah, so there's a lot. I mean, there's a billion users. Crypto native, only crypto native messaging app where you can use the TaN network, which is a sharded layer one. And anyone can build an app and get instant distribution based on chat. And we've seen recently hamster combat.
01:41:14.388 - 01:41:16.600, Speaker B: Hamster. Well, yeah, there are several apps.
01:41:16.980 - 01:41:21.966, Speaker A: Hamster combat, 100 million users. Katazenhe Katizen.
01:41:22.118 - 01:41:23.262, Speaker B: Not coin.
01:41:23.446 - 01:41:27.126, Speaker A: Not coin, which is part of the telegram ecosystem.
01:41:27.198 - 01:41:28.534, Speaker B: Yeah. And a few others.
01:41:28.702 - 01:41:45.550, Speaker A: But for. It's funny because we were talking uni diligence, the founder, and he launched, I forgot what the fantasy app. I'm. How many daily active users do you have? Like, oh, 14,000. I'm like, 14,000. That's not. I'm like, wow, that's not.
01:41:45.550 - 01:42:20.418, Speaker A: I mean, you don't hear those numbers every day in crypto. Right. And so for him to just say that passively tells me a few things, which is like, getting distribution is very easy. You can find product market fit pretty quickly. But you also have to figure out, like, is it really the product or are you just being farmed? And so I got some interesting insights from a lot of people that are building in this ecosystem. One interesting insight is that the majority of demographics, demographic that's using the product are from low income areas, very, very low income areas. So for them to tap a hamster, clicking games.
01:42:20.418 - 01:42:30.178, Speaker A: The clicking game. So I sent you a viral video, someone from Vietnam or something, where the guy was giving someone a haircut. And while he was giving him a haircut, he was just tapping the phone.
01:42:30.274 - 01:42:30.882, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:42:31.026 - 01:42:34.390, Speaker A: Like, while he was cutting someone's hair. It was weird.
01:42:34.730 - 01:42:36.634, Speaker B: One hand, one time, one hand.
01:42:36.762 - 01:42:38.202, Speaker A: Like, he was like, cutting and like.
01:42:38.266 - 01:42:38.874, Speaker B: And then tapping.
01:42:38.922 - 01:43:10.054, Speaker A: Holding the head with the. And he was like, there's another one where somebody, it was like, you could tell, was in like some, like, factory where they were making clothes and the. The sewing machine, you know how it taps as you're like, making the extension. And so they put the phone next to the sewing machine. And every time you hit the. Every time you're sewing, it starts tapping really fast. Did you see that? I sent, I don't know if I sent it to you, but they're finding ways to hack this and make this so they can earn money.
01:43:10.142 - 01:43:26.650, Speaker B: Yeah. So, okay, so these apps have like millions of tens of millions of users, if not hundreds, which is really crazy. And that is, given that is on top of the fact that those apps are really stupid.
01:43:26.990 - 01:43:31.430, Speaker A: They are, yeah. And they're meme maps. I would consider them as memaps.
01:43:31.550 - 01:43:57.870, Speaker B: Yeah. And on top of the fact that the developer experience today is really, really bad. So I learned this from a couple of founders who are building on top of tan. Apparently it's really, really hard to build on top of tan for a couple of reasons. One is taun supports a couple of languages that are just unique to tan. And the vast majority of developers are not familiar with those languages. One of them is similar to solidity, but it's different.
01:43:57.870 - 01:44:23.094, Speaker B: It's high level language. Another one is super low level. It's like on the same level of abstraction as c, different syntax. And so developers are not used to these two languages, so they would have to learn a new language in order to build on top. So that makes it really hard for developer adoption. And the other thing is, apparently it's really hard to execute transactions in parallel. I don't know why that is the case.
01:44:23.094 - 01:45:12.458, Speaker B: Apparently you cannot send transactions or execute transactions. You cannot execute more than one transaction per block, which is like, it doesn't make sense to me, but that is happening today with one of the founders building an app on top of tan. And on top of that, you need to wait for the block confirmation, like several blocks to confirm the transaction before you can send a new transaction. So the result is they cannot execute more than one transaction perennial minute, which is really absurd. But I think there's probably ways around this. And that's, I don't understand exactly why that is the case, but my high level understanding is that tan is not optimized for complex smart contract transactions. It's optimized for payments.
01:45:12.458 - 01:45:44.354, Speaker B: So they really designed Tan as a payment based blockchain, payment friendly blockchain, payment first, payment first. And so anyway, so right now, Tan is really hard to develop for complex smart contracts that might change in the future. But my point is, Taun is not a very developer friendly blockchain today. And despite that, there's apps on top of tan that have tens of millions of data, active users. And that tells you everything you need to know about distribution so ton has distribution.
01:45:44.532 - 01:46:07.782, Speaker A: They have a platform where they can help app developers get users, but their infra isn't as optimized as, say, Solana as an example. So there are trade offs and it's expensive. Right. I think one of our founders was actually venting to us and he said it's actually really expensive for people to use the product. It's like, what, ten cents a transaction?
01:46:07.846 - 01:46:24.510, Speaker B: Yeah, it's like sometimes it's. It could be $0.50, but anyway, it's like one or two orders magnitude more expensive than Solana and the Ethereum L2 s. And again, that goes back to the point about tan not being optimized for complex smart contract transactions.
01:46:24.550 - 01:46:33.454, Speaker A: So to me, it seems like a lot of things could happen off chain via centralized server and really just a settlement could happen on tan in itself.
01:46:33.582 - 01:46:36.094, Speaker B: Yeah, there could be L2s on top of tan first.
01:46:36.182 - 01:46:55.610, Speaker A: Oh, God, there are other L2s. We talked to a few already, if you remember. Rip. Cool. I think that's some of it. I don't think we've covered it all, but I think some of the major themes we covered. I just went on Twitter just a second ago and looks like people are calling it a bottom.
01:46:55.610 - 01:47:05.942, Speaker A: Cl said local bottom. Ansem has the dragon Ball Z gif up. That's warming up.
01:47:06.086 - 01:47:13.814, Speaker B: That cap bounce to 63, maybe. And then you think. So down only to low fifties.
01:47:13.942 - 01:47:16.086, Speaker A: Are you becoming trading, Donald?
01:47:16.238 - 01:47:18.094, Speaker B: I'm slowly.
01:47:18.182 - 01:47:19.822, Speaker A: Oh, shit, we hit 59. Seven.
01:47:19.966 - 01:47:24.310, Speaker B: Interestingly, bitcoin is down more than alts. Than most alts.
01:47:24.470 - 01:47:25.210, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:47:25.510 - 01:47:33.948, Speaker B: And that could be related to, I don't know, the Germany. Germany government selling bitcoin.
01:47:34.084 - 01:47:36.180, Speaker A: Yeah, that and the Mount Gox.
01:47:36.340 - 01:47:51.076, Speaker B: And Mount Gox. Anyway, my prediction is we'll be higher. We'll be, in fact, breaking all time high again by the end of the year. So up only upon me over the time horizon of six months.
01:47:51.228 - 01:48:04.234, Speaker A: So just for listeners that are in the trenches every day in the pump fund trenches, I'm speaking to you. Don't worry, it'll be all right in the next few months. Just got to hold strong.
01:48:04.362 - 01:48:13.130, Speaker B: Oh. However, I do think meme coins could, like if meme coins may not come back. Some of the meme coins, the on chain ones may not come back.
01:48:13.210 - 01:48:20.402, Speaker A: All right, so let's have fun with this. Which ones would you put a prediction on that won't come back? We'll just talk about some popular ones.
01:48:20.466 - 01:48:24.002, Speaker B: Say with is not on chain anymore. With is actually on bias.
01:48:24.026 - 01:48:25.522, Speaker A: Oh, that's right. So you're talking on chain.
01:48:25.546 - 01:48:33.088, Speaker B: On chain. Like the ones on binance, they'll probably come back, but on chain ones, they could be dead for good.
01:48:33.224 - 01:48:48.760, Speaker A: Well, I think many of them, there's just too much attention. Right. And so it's very hard to bring that tension back unless there's someone that is the. What I call the drummer for each of these memes.
01:48:48.920 - 01:48:51.024, Speaker B: The leader. The leader. The cult leader.
01:48:51.152 - 01:48:55.406, Speaker A: The cult leader. And if there isn't a cult leader behind your memes, then you'd probably want to.
01:48:55.568 - 01:48:56.050, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:48:56.130 - 01:48:56.954, Speaker A: Not be there.
01:48:57.082 - 01:49:02.954, Speaker B: Did, uh, did Andrew Tate's, uh, daddy or his daddy coin go to zero yet?
01:49:03.082 - 01:49:06.818, Speaker A: I'm waiting for that one to go to zero. I haven't seen it go to zero yet.
01:49:06.954 - 01:49:08.426, Speaker B: Oh, he bounced back a little bit.
01:49:08.538 - 01:49:14.738, Speaker A: Oh, he tweeted something the other day, I think, um. Really? $76 million FTV, so.
01:49:14.874 - 01:49:15.522, Speaker B: Wow.
01:49:15.666 - 01:49:26.140, Speaker A: Still surprised. I thought it was going to be at zero. Mother is at 60 million. She's still. She's finding more utility stuff like that. So. Like that.
01:49:26.140 - 01:49:41.000, Speaker A: I think the celeb coins that have a leader that's attached to them and they're still giving it attention will not go away. There's a new meme called Billy that is apparently becoming a thing. But outside of that, nothing really interesting that I'm seeing.
01:49:41.700 - 01:49:46.228, Speaker B: I was telling you earlier how I. So how I discovered Haktua.
01:49:46.364 - 01:49:47.632, Speaker A: Oh, yeah. Tell me the story.
01:49:47.756 - 01:50:24.852, Speaker B: So I actually discovered Haktua, the latest meme of the Internet. I actually discovered it on Dexcreener first, because I was on Dexcreener the other day, and I saw hawk two. What the hell is it? And then I went on TikTok and searched for Haktua, and then I saw the meme, a bunch of videos, and now my entire TikTok feed is, like, just automatically pushing the hawk to a memes to me, the videos to me. But anyway, my point being, I actually discovered a new Internet subculture on Dexcreener before on TikTok, and I spent more time on TikTok than on Dexcreener.
01:50:24.996 - 01:50:29.924, Speaker A: Sure. Interesting. So meme coins has a trending.
01:50:30.092 - 01:50:33.652, Speaker B: So meme coins as a discovery tool for Internet culture.
01:50:33.796 - 01:50:46.490, Speaker A: Yeah, I could buy that. Haktua was. Yeah, now it's at. Wait, is that the. Oh, wow. I was trying to see Hawk. Oh, down 99%.
01:50:46.490 - 01:51:12.296, Speaker A: Is that the right one? Oh, here's the right one. Oh, no. It's a 3.9 million, and it was launched on pump. So the one that got popular. So pump is the meta aggregator where it aggregates attention and trends, and then it launches to the market. So it's really pumped.
01:51:12.296 - 01:51:34.596, Speaker A: That's the trend, etcetera. Interesting. All right, so predictions for the future. That was our next, I'll give you mine. I am going to continue doubling down on the idea of consumer apps that go viral. We will see an app that will hit within the next twelve months to 24 months. 100 million users.
01:51:34.708 - 01:51:37.844, Speaker B: If I was you don't think pump already has 100 million users?
01:51:37.972 - 01:51:42.980, Speaker A: Pump, yeah, pump has, I think, 60,000 daily active users today.
01:51:43.060 - 01:51:43.996, Speaker B: But combined.
01:51:44.148 - 01:51:44.820, Speaker A: Combined.
01:51:44.940 - 01:51:46.900, Speaker B: Because pump turns a lot.
01:51:47.020 - 01:51:55.476, Speaker A: They turn a lot. Yeah, yeah. It's, they have a high churn rate. Right. But right now they have 60,000 and growing steadily.
01:51:55.628 - 01:52:03.446, Speaker B: I think that the lifetime number of users on palm might be like order of magnitude between one and 10 million.
01:52:03.598 - 01:52:06.038, Speaker A: Sure. Over time. Yeah. Cumulative, right.
01:52:06.134 - 01:52:09.238, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, unique. Unique because they turn.
01:52:09.374 - 01:52:10.974, Speaker A: Yeah, but if you. In aggregate.
01:52:11.062 - 01:52:11.726, Speaker B: In aggregate.
01:52:11.838 - 01:52:12.782, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, that's what I mean.
01:52:12.806 - 01:52:14.310, Speaker B: Aggregate, unique users, lifetime.
01:52:14.350 - 01:52:16.310, Speaker A: Yeah, sure. That I can believe.
01:52:16.430 - 01:52:18.782, Speaker B: What else? Any other predictions?
01:52:18.926 - 01:52:22.050, Speaker A: That's, I'm just picking one. I'm gonna stick with one.
01:52:22.590 - 01:52:25.576, Speaker B: What do you think of the airdrop meta? Is it.
01:52:25.608 - 01:52:57.288, Speaker A: Oh, that's right. No, I think it's the beginning. Look, I put it to put a tweet out, but pretty much like the airdrop meta for no contingencies is out. Like now there's going to be contingencies such as vesting. So blast is an example, is a great example where part of the airdrop is vested. So that's like one example. And you could provide liquidity and vest faster as an example or something like that.
01:52:57.288 - 01:53:16.672, Speaker A: I forgot exact mechanics, but pretty much what it makes you do is, all right, you're not, you're getting this airdrop, it's allocated to you, but you need to do some work to redeem that airdrop, or you need to do something of value that is productive for the.
01:53:16.696 - 01:53:21.800, Speaker B: Chain itself or so ask the airdrop farmers to pay like $0.10 or something.
01:53:21.920 - 01:53:22.768, Speaker A: A donation.
01:53:22.904 - 01:53:23.824, Speaker B: A donation, yeah.
01:53:23.872 - 01:53:56.930, Speaker A: I think layers are did everything wrong if you ask me. You know, like there's a process of educating and like getting feedback from users and, or like letting the users know beforehand. I mean, not just layer zero, but everyone. Many, many startups have done this in the wrong fashion. Even if you look at Eigen layer, like the concept of like this derivative token that just sits and unlocks over time. Like release it to the public first, let them know what's coming so that way there isn't a negative reaction to it versus just launching it. I do think there is an opportunity to educate.
01:53:56.930 - 01:54:31.220, Speaker A: So going back to layer zero as an example, layer zero did two things. One is like, they kind of went after like, civil clusters. So they did this by like, hey, if you know a civil cluster, let them know, let us know, and we will tag them and you get something in return or something like that. So pretty much it was like a snitching network. Pretty much, they built a snitching network, and this network enabled them to identify large, large clusters, which is fine. And so a lot of, like, commercialized farming networks were shot over time. A lot of civilians got shot too, but that's the separate story.
01:54:31.220 - 01:54:54.188, Speaker A: And then the second thing is this airdrop meta that you mentioned, which is like, if you want to redeem, then you have to donate ten cents to, it was a builders fund or some coalition of, of developers or something on Ethereum. I forgot what it was, but that was the other one, and they were going to match the donation up to 10 million or something. And so people really were turned off by that.
01:54:54.284 - 01:55:25.338, Speaker B: Again, like, like, I mean, there, there's a lot of discourse on why this is the end of airdrops. And one of the arguments is that, you know, there's actually no incentive alignment between, like, the airdrop and long term usage. Like that farmers are not long term users. They will exit the market immediately upon receiving the airdrop. So, I mean, that's sort of the argument. But the real reason. There's a state, again, there is a state of reason.
01:55:25.338 - 01:55:31.354, Speaker B: There is a real reason. The real reason for airdrops is actually creating liquidity on day one.
01:55:31.482 - 01:55:32.034, Speaker A: Sure.
01:55:32.162 - 01:56:18.020, Speaker B: Because in order to create a liquid market, you have to distribute the token widely to a wide audience. And airdrops happens to be the easiest way to do that from a legal point of view. Because if you think about it, what is the alternative to create a liquid market on day one, or what's an alternative? In other words, what's an alternative to distribute the tokens widely? It's through a token sale. But token sales are today very risky to do, from a legal point of view, much more risky than airdrops. So until icos and crowd sale, until that mechanic comes back, I do agree with you that airdrops are here to stay. I don't see any other alternative. It's between airdrops or crowdsale.
01:56:18.140 - 01:56:42.578, Speaker A: Yeah, 100% agree. I think it's just going to become more productive. And what's going to happen is that people are going to have to spend more time on these apps and be converted into users. That's it. We're in the process of being converted into long term users, and it's going to happen in some shape or form. And it's essentially, it's investing in a startup, but you're investing your attention into it for a longer period of time. That's all it is right now.
01:56:42.578 - 01:57:09.612, Speaker A: It's easily farmable. You could do, I don't know, there was a list of 25 protocols that were launching layer ones and apps, and everybody could farm them. You could do this full time. Over time, I think it's just going to become harder and harder for people to mass farm all of these products, and you're going to be focused on very few. And that is where you're going to spend a lot of your time and attention. Even if you look at fantasy top as an example, that's where I spend a lot of my time now. Right.
01:57:09.612 - 01:57:33.184, Speaker A: Because, you know, like, one, obviously there's a lot of great players are playing a lot of great game mechanics, and I'm earning a lot of points. So now I have like maybe two to five, like two to four apps that I use daily that I just use because I like the products and then I'm and farming it. And I think that's probably what's going to kind of emerge out of this whole commercialized farming ponzi that we've created.
01:57:33.352 - 01:57:36.992, Speaker B: The industrial farmers, the industrial farms.
01:57:37.136 - 01:57:39.144, Speaker A: I think industrial farming is. That is where I'm at.
01:57:39.232 - 01:57:51.944, Speaker B: Yeah, no, that. I agree with you. It seems like industrial farming has seen far lower returns than it used to. So there's this guy on Twitter who tweeted about how he farmed ZK sync by.
01:57:52.032 - 01:58:02.058, Speaker A: Yeah, they didn't even care. They just like, to everyone, all the clusters that farmed on layer zero, they all ended up. Not all, but most of them ended up getting the ZK sync. Airdrop.
01:58:02.194 - 01:58:41.512, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, okay, so this guy, he spin up 350 IP addresses with unique caches and cookies and RPCs and VPN's and hosting a bunch of AI tools. Days and days of coding in order to learn those bots to act like real humans. So he actually wanted the bots to look to act like real humans rather than like AI. And he spent like 30 eth on fees, $21,000 on the whole, infra 200 ETH for liquidity pool for bots, and blah, blah blah. That's a lot of investment. And he ended up earning 18,000 ZK tokens. And the ZK tokens, what is that worth?
01:58:41.536 - 01:58:43.376, Speaker A: Now, today you said 80,000.
01:58:43.528 - 01:59:05.912, Speaker B: 80,000 units of ZK tokens. And each ZK token is worth sixteen cents. And so he made like $3,000 on an investment of, you know, ten times bigger. So very bad return. And Zksync is like the opening price. Opening FDV is not even that bad. It's like 3 billion.
01:59:05.912 - 01:59:34.702, Speaker B: I mean, it's not, it's not crazy, but it's not bad. But yeah, it's possible that industrial farming, well, I don't really know. I feel like it's an arms race between industrial farming and all the anti Sibyl measures that the project is doing. Like they're all trying to get ahead of each other. It's like an AI arm. It's like a deep fake arms arms race, right? Like the AI AI deepfakes are getting better and better, and the AI deep fake detections are getting better and better as well. They try to frontrun each other.
01:59:34.702 - 01:59:42.998, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a race to the bottom. I feel like. Could be the same thing for airdrops, industrial airdrop farming.
01:59:43.134 - 01:59:55.934, Speaker A: Well, I mean, apps and protocols will have to figure out how to use their equity productively. Right? Their tokens productively. If you're giving it to people that aren't going to convert to long term users, then what's the point? There's no point.
01:59:56.022 - 02:00:04.558, Speaker B: Well, again, you have the state users, but the real reason is to create day one liquidity.
02:00:04.734 - 02:00:46.368, Speaker A: So wouldn't it perfect role would be a day one liquidity in all unique users. That would be the, obviously the perfect scenario. Right. So that's the scenario that, that I'm talking about is this, you know, getting, you know, x amount of users, but then also making sure that they actually use the app versus just being dumped on. Yeah, that's what, that's what I mean. And I think there's a perfect world where that happens, but it just, you know, I think it has to be done in a way that enables better kind of measures and who they give to airdrops, to users. So starkware did this pretty interestingly, which is they airdropped to developers as an example.
02:00:46.368 - 02:01:03.912, Speaker A: I felt like Celestia did this really well as well, where they just gave it to developers and all the people that are very important for Celestia's ecosystem. I do think there is a way to do this, but it just depends on how much the founders care about it.
02:01:03.976 - 02:01:14.540, Speaker B: Okay, so prediction is airdrops are here to stay, but industrial airdrop farming might come to an end. Any other predictions?
02:01:15.520 - 02:01:32.588, Speaker A: I think I'm going to stick to just the consumer. I'm going to stick to my one consumer app. Consumer app. Oh, here's a fun one. Maybe prediction mark. There will be an upstart or startup that will dethroned polymarket.
02:01:32.684 - 02:01:41.380, Speaker B: Do you think that'll happen on the Solana? Sure, because there's no, at least no big competitor to polymarket and Solana that I know of.
02:01:41.500 - 02:01:49.000, Speaker A: But it will look very different than polymarket. We won't say how, but there will be, because I think there are many ways that could happen. Right.
02:01:49.940 - 02:01:57.392, Speaker B: Anything else? I can't think of anything else. Do you think. Okay, so there's a, here's a fun one. Go ahead.
02:01:57.416 - 02:01:58.220, Speaker A: Okay, go ahead.
02:01:58.920 - 02:02:11.328, Speaker B: There's people saying if Solana could dethrone Ethereum, white can't taunt. I mean, on the surface it's, I'm open to the possibility.
02:02:11.504 - 02:02:12.152, Speaker A: Sure.
02:02:12.296 - 02:02:36.350, Speaker B: I don't see that in the data yet. On the other hand, like, I don't see that, I don't see the data between, I don't see tan dishroening Solana in the data, but I see Solana D 300 Ethereum potentially in the data on many metrics. Solana is approaching Ethereum much, much faster than the price is relative to Eth.
02:02:36.510 - 02:02:56.042, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know. To me, so I agree. I think there is a possibility for Solana to compete against Ethereum one on one. And that seems more plausible to me. Tan network. There's some challenges there that I see. We've just talked about fees is one the developer experience? The developer experience is two, three.
02:02:56.042 - 02:03:01.610, Speaker A: I do think that maybe it's just me, but I think the market's getting way ahead of itself. It's just like, oh, tan.
02:03:01.650 - 02:03:04.346, Speaker B: The token or just han.
02:03:04.538 - 02:03:10.882, Speaker A: Sure, the token, you know, like pantera starting a second fund as an example just to buy ton.
02:03:11.026 - 02:03:11.634, Speaker B: Yeah.
02:03:11.762 - 02:03:22.798, Speaker A: To me, I feel as if the market's getting way too ahead. And then after seeing the quality of developers, I feel like we need one phase to go and for the second phase to come in for us to see some real good.
02:03:22.854 - 02:03:30.662, Speaker B: Like I, yeah, I don't think Tan is, is a this cycle thing. It's, yeah, if it's a thing, then it's a next cycle thing.
02:03:30.806 - 02:03:35.958, Speaker A: Um, I think they need one, they need one cycle to learn. They need one cycle to learn.
02:03:36.094 - 02:03:45.646, Speaker B: Um, and so one cycle to prove the, the resilience of the developers. And that's what salon did this cycle and that's why ethereum did last cycle.
02:03:45.758 - 02:04:10.260, Speaker A: And so between the, the language that they use the chain being more optimized for payments. The sharded there, they have a sharded layer one. Right, as an example. And so I do feel like if the apps are becoming successful on time is primarily going to be just off chain apps. I don't. I don't know if I'll see a lot of. We probably won't see a lot of on chain stuff, but probably mostly off chain stuff.
02:04:10.260 - 02:04:17.120, Speaker A: So then you're thinking just like mini apps, like Wechat as an example. But then why do you need crypto for. That is the example?
02:04:17.280 - 02:04:19.020, Speaker B: Oh, we haven't talked about.
02:04:19.440 - 02:04:35.024, Speaker A: Oh, wait, wait. Let's talk about deep end. But I also want to highlight what you just said earlier. Donald just tweeted, the altcoin strength here is considerable. It seems to me like a bet on the range being reclaimed, somewhat holding. If that doesn't have. Motherfucker.
02:04:35.024 - 02:04:48.590, Speaker A: If that doesn't happen, I think all's positions are out of position. If it does hold, that'll be the bottom for alts for a while. People betting high stakes. We need to invite down alt to our podcast. I feel like we talk about him so much.
02:04:49.290 - 02:04:53.690, Speaker B: Wait, so instructions on clear. Is he bullish or bearish? Up or down?
02:04:53.850 - 02:04:59.162, Speaker A: So what he's saying is, if it does hold, that's the bottom. If it doesn't hold, then it's done.
02:04:59.306 - 02:05:01.346, Speaker B: Well, no fucking shit. By definition.
02:05:01.538 - 02:05:02.310, Speaker A: Yeah.
02:05:04.530 - 02:05:07.590, Speaker B: If it doesn't hold, it's not the bottom.
02:05:08.810 - 02:05:14.754, Speaker A: People betting high stakes. So go ahead, deepen, deepen. Wait, before. Let me go. I'm gonna hit the bathroom real quick.
02:05:14.802 - 02:05:15.450, Speaker B: Oh, my God.
02:05:15.490 - 02:05:25.154, Speaker A: Fucking boomer, bro, we've been on the call for 2 hours. I drink two bottles of water. Do you drink water at all when you do a podcast?
02:05:25.242 - 02:05:27.810, Speaker B: Yeah, I drank water. I would drink whole bottle of water.
02:05:27.970 - 02:05:29.266, Speaker A: Yeah. How many bottles?
02:05:29.418 - 02:05:30.522, Speaker B: Like one big cup.
02:05:30.626 - 02:05:32.594, Speaker A: Looks like a coffee cup to me.
02:05:32.682 - 02:05:56.908, Speaker B: The big one, though. All right, go, go, go. So, deepen, we get probably a deep end startup pitch at least once every other day now. And the valuations are ridiculous. Pretty absurd. Similar order of magnitude as AI. What's happening? I feel like.
02:05:56.908 - 02:06:20.874, Speaker B: Okay, so I think helium is the OG here. I think helium has proven that using crypto native, using crypto token incentives can in fact help install a new infrastructure. So tokens are extremely powerful incentives to help install new infrastructure. But I don't think helium is entirely proven yet. I think for the most part, helium.
02:06:21.052 - 02:06:24.790, Speaker A: Helium is proven. Helium is proven, at least what they're building.
02:06:24.950 - 02:06:27.526, Speaker B: I don't think. I don't think that the man side is proven yet.
02:06:27.598 - 02:06:32.014, Speaker A: It is. I'm using. I switched over to helium phone service.
02:06:32.182 - 02:06:33.270, Speaker B: Wait, so you're.
02:06:33.430 - 02:06:39.470, Speaker A: Yeah, so my family's account, we switched to helium because it was so cheap by default.
02:06:39.550 - 02:06:41.734, Speaker B: Like, most of the time you're using.
02:06:41.782 - 02:06:46.566, Speaker A: MVNo, which is a T mobile network, but it's a blended network of helium and MVNo.
02:06:46.638 - 02:06:52.152, Speaker B: Right. Wherever there's no T mobile coverage, you fall back onto helium.
02:06:52.296 - 02:06:53.096, Speaker A: Or vice versa.
02:06:53.128 - 02:06:54.240, Speaker B: Right, or vice versa. Yeah.
02:06:54.320 - 02:07:14.080, Speaker A: Yeah. So. And that's the demand side. And. And if you look at, like, I did a huge search, I mean, pretty much us search of all the best mobile providers and services and compared price and cost. Helium comes out the cheapest, helium mobile comes out the cheapest and the best service. And on top of that, we're earning tokens.
02:07:14.080 - 02:07:35.904, Speaker A: And so every day we go, like. I mean, I'm not saying we do this every day, but, like, you know, you have different quadrants. You go to different quadrants and using the service, and you start to mine tokens. And so on average, the. The tokens that I'm getting pay for my bill. So I. It's dollar 20 a month for the service, and then the tokens I get generally between, like, 17 and $20.
02:07:35.992 - 02:07:38.256, Speaker B: Wait, but you earn tokens by doing what?
02:07:38.368 - 02:07:44.956, Speaker A: Just using the phone service. Oh, sorry. Phone service and location. You have to turn your location on to mines your location data.
02:07:45.108 - 02:07:46.012, Speaker B: Interesting.
02:07:46.156 - 02:07:50.068, Speaker A: So I don't know what they're doing exactly with the location data, but you.
02:07:50.084 - 02:07:54.236, Speaker B: Can probably assume, huh, you don't mind selling your data, selling your privacy for some.
02:07:54.268 - 02:08:31.734, Speaker A: We're already doing that. Well, I did it partly one, because I want to use a product and I want to feel like, you know, what people go through. And for the. For me, like, sure, I am, you know, skeptical on sharing my info, but the average person would do it in heartbeat. If they get free phone service, they'll do it in Heartbeat. They already shared their data with Facebook and everyone else, so why not? So, yeah, so helium is an example where I think it's actually working, but that's probably the only deep end project that I've seen that is, to me, has found product market fit the right way.
02:08:31.862 - 02:08:34.800, Speaker B: Do you know how many people are on the heating plan?
02:08:34.990 - 02:08:45.436, Speaker A: I actually did this research the other day. I don't mini. Hold on, Chad. Gbt. 62,000 subscribers.
02:08:45.588 - 02:08:46.340, Speaker B: Say that again.
02:08:46.460 - 02:08:52.700, Speaker A: 62,000 subscribers. Okay, so annual run rate of $15 million in contracts.
02:08:52.820 - 02:08:55.980, Speaker B: But a lot of that goes to probably team BNL.
02:08:56.100 - 02:09:19.476, Speaker A: Sure, but this is going to take time. Right. This is not something that happens overnight. But they launched this less than a year ago, and I went through the whole onboarding experience, the customer service, I have to say, it was great. I had some issues with my activating my SIM card. And so it's very different than using Verizon or at and t where you had to call them. And there's this whole process here.
02:09:19.476 - 02:09:27.316, Speaker A: I just sent a message within the app and they fixed it. I got ahold of somebody. We just talked to each other via text and was able to get a result.
02:09:27.428 - 02:09:30.054, Speaker B: It's someone on helium or someone on t mobile.
02:09:30.172 - 02:09:35.962, Speaker A: Helium. Helium. Helium customer service. It was a helium app, and you go within the helium app to chat with someone.
02:09:36.106 - 02:09:36.762, Speaker B: Okay.
02:09:36.866 - 02:09:40.978, Speaker A: So I was also very skeptical at first, but helium works.
02:09:41.114 - 02:09:42.098, Speaker B: But why is it so cheap?
02:09:42.154 - 02:10:10.174, Speaker A: Like, the next cheapest plan that I searched was $25, so it's $5 more. But there was, like, one or two features you couldn't get. I forgot what it was. Oh, yeah. There was like a cap on Internet and, yeah, there were some, like, caps and some annoying things about it. This was pretty much, helium was pretty much at parity with, like, 18 verizon in terms of features and pretty much at parity with features, which is what I wanted in the first place, like nationwide roaming and et cetera.
02:10:10.302 - 02:10:20.410, Speaker B: Okay. But when you use your phone, most of the time you're on T mobile. Right. And a small percentage of the time you were actually on the helium network. Does helium network.
02:10:21.070 - 02:10:28.698, Speaker A: I don't know. I haven't checked. Like, it doesn't tell you. Like, you just have the bar signals. I don't see. I don't. I haven't seen the network.
02:10:28.698 - 02:10:29.826, Speaker A: I don't see the network.
02:10:29.938 - 02:10:30.570, Speaker B: Okay.
02:10:30.690 - 02:10:33.010, Speaker A: Or I don't pay attention to it. It's probably what it is.
02:10:33.170 - 02:10:38.634, Speaker B: Like, basically, you only have coverage when there's someone near you that runs the helium hotspot.
02:10:38.762 - 02:10:48.870, Speaker A: Hotspot, that's right. Helium hotspot. But that extends. Yeah. Let's look at the helium network coverage. Here it is. I'm going to share my screen here in a second.
02:10:48.870 - 02:10:55.678, Speaker A: Share, share. Screen. All right, here we go. So if you look at it, it's all the major cities.
02:10:55.854 - 02:10:56.478, Speaker B: Sure.
02:10:56.614 - 02:11:14.206, Speaker A: And I would assume, like, let's look at LA as an example. This is. Here it is. You see, it's not bad for, like, a major city because you're normally in these areas. And so in these areas, as an example, you can switch. Like, let's say you go to this pocket right here. An example, you switch to, like, T Mobile.
02:11:14.206 - 02:11:45.832, Speaker A: And what I'm assuming what's happening with our phone data helium is probably doing is trying to figure out where do people mostly travel to where there isn't a helium service. And they'll probably, like, give extra incentives to launch service there as an example. I think that's what they're doing right now. It's like farming the locations where people mostly go to. Once you have those black spots of service, then you could throw extra tokens that way for people to launch the HubSpot there or the HubSpot, but hot spot there.
02:11:45.936 - 02:11:49.920, Speaker B: I'm looking at Manhattan. It's basically 100% covered.
02:11:50.040 - 02:11:53.660, Speaker A: Yeah, that's northeast is covered pretty good.
02:11:54.080 - 02:12:01.072, Speaker B: Okay, so if it's only $15, why isn't everyone already $20? $20. Why isn't everyone already on it?
02:12:01.176 - 02:12:17.502, Speaker A: Marketing, that's what they're ramping up now. So they just released maybe a couple months ago, they did a really cool marketing video. So I think now they're ramping up marketing. But this coverage is pretty good. This isn't bad. You could get, I mean, like, on the safe side, you could probably get 10 million users easily. Just looking at this.
02:12:17.502 - 02:12:19.390, Speaker A: Just looking at this. You could, huh?
02:12:19.510 - 02:12:24.782, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, if you're, if you live in one of those cities.
02:12:24.926 - 02:12:36.126, Speaker A: Yeah, but, like, population, I mean, that's where most of the population is. It's pretty dense in those areas. Right. You can worry about the rest later. Get. Get distribution. And if you look at other parts of the world, look at this.
02:12:36.126 - 02:12:42.448, Speaker A: This is crazy. Look at Europe. India's starting to grow, too. Look at India. Well, it's just starting.
02:12:42.624 - 02:12:47.176, Speaker B: China, this green region seems like industrial.
02:12:47.208 - 02:13:01.976, Speaker A: Farm industrial is in Shenzhen. They're probably building a device there. Yeah, but, yeah, it's.
02:13:02.048 - 02:13:22.894, Speaker B: Oh, by the way. So for, for those listening, Shenzhen is probably. So that's the Silicon Valley of China. That's probably where the vast majority of deep end projects manufacture their hardware. The Shenzhen is the world's deep end capital, manufacturing capital.
02:13:23.062 - 02:13:25.638, Speaker A: Any other deep end ideas that you like?
02:13:25.774 - 02:13:42.638, Speaker B: I mean, there's a lot. There's hivemapper, but again, I don't think that compared. So you say helium. The demand side is proven. I say it's, I guess with 90,000 or 60,000. You said. I think I saw 90,000 subscribers somewhere.
02:13:42.638 - 02:13:52.766, Speaker B: But anyway, so I think it's there. There is demand. But to me, overall, it's still an experiment. I mean, like, almost everything. Crypto is still an experiment.
02:13:52.798 - 02:13:53.970, Speaker A: Everything. Yeah.
02:13:54.270 - 02:14:24.386, Speaker B: Hivemapper, relative to helium is way less proven on the demand side. I saw some charts of the revenues they're generating on a monthly basis. It's a very small number and it's not consistent. But I like the idea. I like the idea the supply side is proven like what, 25% of the world's roads are mapped. The question is, will the demand side be proven as well? I think still early on the demand side.
02:14:24.498 - 02:15:11.752, Speaker A: So Proto is, proto is a startup that went through our last batch and what they do, which I like a lot because India is an example where hype mapper couldn't work because the roads are real rough in certain areas, a lot of the rural areas. Two is the device is pretty expensive. You have to pay dollar 200 and run the device on your car. In your car. If you look at India's population, 80% of the people in India use Android phones as an example. What proto does is enables anyone to use a phone device to scan their area. So everyone is assigned a quadrant and then they can go out and map the different areas and the data is fresh because people are able to go to different locations that the car can't go to either.
02:15:11.752 - 02:15:43.158, Speaker A: And it's cheaper. From a cost perspective you're just using your phone versus having to buy a 200 l device. So I do think we'll see different takes on mapping as well versus say what Google does today. Like Google as an example, from what I remember talking to Prototeam, they come to India every few years because just so hard to. Whereas in the US they map every year or something like that. So the freshness of that is also very important. Yeah, so that's DPNA.
02:15:43.158 - 02:15:44.882, Speaker A: Any other deepen ideas that you like?
02:15:44.986 - 02:16:07.586, Speaker B: I mean overall I think that we've proven that the supply side, it's very obvious that token incentives are a very powerful way to install new infrastructure. Infrastructure. But whether or not the demand side, whether or not the demand side generates more revenue to cover the token issuance in the long term, that is yet to be seen.
02:16:07.778 - 02:16:26.950, Speaker A: So we built the supply side, now we need to build demand side. I think everyone's looking at helium as the front runner as to how they're doing it. Okay, gaming pixels. Pixels has been growing. Oh, did you see the announcement where Ronin is launching on Polygon CDK?
02:16:27.110 - 02:16:29.806, Speaker B: Oh yeah, that's right. They're doing L2.
02:16:29.918 - 02:16:51.130, Speaker A: Like a proper L2 CDK. And so you have immutable and Ronin on Polygon Zkvmdev. So I could see gaming being aggregated there. I don't know, it could be interesting to see how that plays out. Yeah, we're seeing pixels. That's been growing pretty. Pretty good.
02:16:51.130 - 02:17:02.646, Speaker A: So there's two types of gamings in crypto, right? There's on chain games, then there's more like web 2.5 games. So would you consider pixel Web 2.5?
02:17:02.718 - 02:17:05.214, Speaker B: I haven't played pixel. I don't actually know how it works.
02:17:05.262 - 02:17:05.534, Speaker A: I play.
02:17:05.542 - 02:17:07.350, Speaker B: It has a ton of users.
02:17:07.470 - 02:17:24.134, Speaker A: I played it. It's a game. It's just a game. You don't really need, from what I remember, your wallet, you might have to sign in or something, but you do that later, from what I remember. But really, there wasn't a lot of crypto in this. You just play the game, from what I remember.
02:17:24.262 - 02:17:38.539, Speaker B: So it sounds very similar to the Telegram games. Yeah, just a game. You don't need to know much about crypto. You know, far from being aaaa game, but it's more of a casual game, mini game.
02:17:38.699 - 02:17:56.279, Speaker A: So getting users is very easy because, you know, there isn't a. There isn't a friction point where you have to get someone to use their wallet. You just play the game, and then the wallet comes after is what I've kind of gathered. You, like, might have to sign in, but then outside of that, you don't really need the wallet for anything else. Rip.
02:17:57.419 - 02:18:01.146, Speaker B: How the fuck did I run out of the battery so soon? I. I think it's the heat.
02:18:01.298 - 02:18:03.074, Speaker A: The heat that we're bringing on the podcast.
02:18:03.202 - 02:18:16.002, Speaker B: Yeah, the heat that Donald brought on, dunking on all the other bulls taking victory labs. All right, I'm pretty much done my camera's.
02:18:16.146 - 02:18:42.284, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, no worries. I mean, on chain gaming, also you have primodium, mirage, some startups from our batch that's building some really cool things on unchained gaming side, but hasn't been proven yet. We've seen Redstone L2 being launched, which is the on chain L2 as an example. People always say that, you know, gaming is gonna bring in the masses. I don't really. Maybe. I don't know if I subscribe to that thesis because games have such a short shelf life.
02:18:42.284 - 02:18:42.820, Speaker A: So.
02:18:42.900 - 02:18:47.788, Speaker B: So far it's stable coins and meme coins that brought the masses.
02:18:47.924 - 02:18:57.282, Speaker A: Well, yeah, they're like the two perfect examples. Cool. Well, I think that's it from our side. Thanks for tuning in. If you haven't hit subscribe, hit subscribe. We'll catch you soon.
