00:00:00.170 - 00:00:28.722, Speaker A: I haven't used DyDx in a very long time. Last time I looked at Dydx as a user was like a year ago. And back then there was no. I can't remember when that was, but there was no kYc. I remember at some point they started doing some KYC stuff, but I didn't follow the details. But even if you include Dydx, I think if you cut the numbers, I think GMX is number one. The top defi protocols right now are by seven day fees are uniswap lido if you consider as defi pancakeswap.
