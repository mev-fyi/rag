You probably would have been able to generate some decent code off of the, at least the really good white papers that gave detailed requirements.
00:00:21.334 - 00:00:23.566, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it would call out the bullshit right away, right?
00:00:23.630 - 00:00:24.094, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly.
