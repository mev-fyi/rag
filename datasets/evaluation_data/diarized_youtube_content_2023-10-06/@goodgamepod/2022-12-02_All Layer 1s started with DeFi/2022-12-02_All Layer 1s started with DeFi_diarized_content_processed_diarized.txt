00:00:00.250 - 00:00:40.486, Speaker A: My perspective is that last year, Alt layer ones that took off, at least temporarily, they almost all started with DeFi. So Solana started with DeFi, you know, a bunch of dexes and lending platforms. Same thing with Avalanche arbitrum. The first sign of activity and narrative and hype around new layer ones is always TVL. Like people always talk about TVL, TVL increasing, and TVL ultimately is DeFi. And so Aptos is kind of using the same strategy, at least according to the founders that we talked to. But sue is taking a completely different approach, which is focusing on consumers as a beach head.
00:00:40.486 - 00:00:41.300, Speaker A: So I thought that was interesting.
