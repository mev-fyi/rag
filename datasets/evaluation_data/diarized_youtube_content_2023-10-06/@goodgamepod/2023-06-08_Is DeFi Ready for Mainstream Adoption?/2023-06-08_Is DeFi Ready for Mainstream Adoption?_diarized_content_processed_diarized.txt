00:00:00.250 - 00:00:04.190, Speaker A: Welcome to good game. Your no BS insights for crypto founders.
00:00:07.570 - 00:01:09.394, Speaker B: Let's use this time where everyone's not like hair on fire, growing like crazy to say, is there any kind of technical debt, ecosystem debt that we should go, we should clean up so we have stronger foundations for that next leg up in growth. There's a number of things we can do, as you mentioned, Kayla, like really siloing, isolating risk around specific assets, specific protocols, and then kind of growing that over time. These are all things that we can do. And I think there just hasn't been enough collective attention across our industry on these things because we were so first growth focused and then, oh, man, we're just watching number go down, number go down, and it's depressing. And I think the point is, well, it's not always going to be number go down, number will go up again. And so let's take this time to think carefully about how we're building so when number does go up, we're ready to support it and we can actually go out and make the case that this is financial infrastructure for the world.
00:01:09.512 - 00:01:52.202, Speaker A: Looking for your next startup idea in crypto? Check out our request for startups list and get inspired at forward slash ideas. Welcome to good game. We have two very special guests joining us today. One is Dan Elitzer from nascent, and second is Kane Warwick from Synthetix. And what we want to dive deep into is Dan Elitzer's recent article about why Defi is broken. He argued three fundamental points that make the attack vectors for protocols much higher than it should be. And the three areas that he pointed out was smart contract upgradability, governance, and oracles.
00:01:52.202 - 00:02:37.598, Speaker A: Oracle lists narrative, and he thinks that those are what's stopping Defi from getting hundreds of millions of users. And then the opposite side is Cain Warwick and Kane Warwick fundamentally helped Chainlink build its first oracle for Defi. In fact, if you read through the story, he also published an article where he talked about the story, and what he talked about was the fact that they had to run their own proprietary oracles, and they figured out quickly that people were front running and exploiting it. And so they worked with Chainlink to push out new oracle systems for its own synthetics product. So two opposite polar. So we brought these two guests to just kind of discuss and see where the underlying solution is and how founders should be thinking about the space moving forward. Chow, what do you think? How do you feel about all this?
00:02:37.684 - 00:03:18.326, Speaker C: I'm really excited about these two guests. Dan has been in this space for a very long time and recently clearly thought very deeply about security and DeFi, more so than I've done in the last couple of years. I read his article. It was very thoughtful. I'm excited to talk to him because the oracle problem and the governance problem and the contract upgradability problem, these are very abstract concepts to me. There have been a couple of hacks related to oracles and governance in the past. So, for example, the mango hack, which we talked about in one of our earlier episodes, and the Euler hack, which happened recently.
00:03:18.326 - 00:03:23.854, Speaker C: But aside from these hacks, it's very hard for me to visualize exactly what.
00:03:23.892 - 00:03:28.798, Speaker A: The problem is between these three that he. Right, yeah, yeah.
00:03:28.884 - 00:03:46.546, Speaker C: These are very abstract concepts to me, by and large. So I want to understand his point of view on these things. I think he's basically trying to forecast something to the future, that someday DeFI will be broken again due to one of these problems.
00:03:46.728 - 00:03:47.074, Speaker A: Yes.
00:03:47.112 - 00:04:23.534, Speaker C: So I really want to understand his point. It's not empirical. It's entirely a forecast, in my opinion. So I want to understand his point of view. And then Kane, needless to say, he's one of the ogs of DFI, has been building DFI pretty much before everyone else started building DFI, before DFI was even a thing. The term DFI was invented in like 2019 or something, but he started building haven and synthetics since 2018. And so he has the actual practical understanding of how to build d five protocol, whereas on the other hand, Dan has more a broader view of things as an investor.
00:04:23.534 - 00:05:15.586, Speaker C: So Kane has this very concrete and practical views on things such as, like, for example, he actually helped Chainlink become what Chainlink is today by working with them in the early days because synthetix needed an oracle four years ago. But Chainlink wasn't ready. So they worked very closely to turn Chainlink into what it is today. And also, Kane spent a long time thinking about how to transition himself from this benevolent dictator into a Dow governance kind of model for synthetics. So I also want to understand how he thinks about decentralized governance versus leadership by a CEO. Like, which one is better? Right? So, really excited about both of these. These are probably two of the top five people I can think of to speak about DFI today.
00:05:15.768 - 00:05:53.354, Speaker A: Yeah. Similarly, some of the points you mentioned that is very interesting for me is if you think about Dan's article before Unisoft, v two became prevalent in terms of liquidity pools, v one was pretty good, but v two was what really set things off. And we think about composability within the DFI ecosystem with LP positions and et cetera. Dan Elitzer kind of called that out pretty early. So Dan, historically, a lot of his articles really kind of laid the foundation for what was going to happen in the future. And I agree. I think a part of this current article that he wrote is really forecasting what could happen.
00:05:53.354 - 00:06:21.302, Speaker A: And so how can we mitigate all of the issues today so that when we get to 100 million users, these primitives can be self sustaining in the long run? And he argued a couple of points, which we'll talk about in our conversation. But like the layered approach, which is like allow the security model to be concentrated on the app surface versus the protocol surface. And so we'll talk about the layered approach, which I tend to agree with.
00:06:21.356 - 00:06:44.806, Speaker C: An example of that is blend, the lending protocol spler, which launched recently, and also Ashna, which is still fairly under the radar. But both of these oracle less designs have made the news recently, with Blen actually becoming the number one lending protocol for nfts. So I think a lot of people are very curious about these topics, so we're going to touch on them as.
00:06:44.848 - 00:07:35.786, Speaker A: And for Kane, the reason why I'm excited to speak to him is because it's the historical data that he has. I mean, it's all in his. Like if you read his most recent article, he talked about, look, we started off with this thing and we just started to go after one goal after another, and then over time it just became synthetics was what it is. You know, when you're hitting these smaller goals and solving these problems from a macro perspective, you can't see what you're not doing right now. That Dan brought up this issue about primitives and how these external dependencies are becoming an issue. It is right? And so for us, it's like kind of unpacking what he went through historically and understanding where are some of the mistakes that we've made and then areas how he mitigated those problems that synthetics went through in the early days. So I'm also very excited.
00:07:35.898 - 00:08:30.426, Speaker C: I strongly recommend every builder in this space to read Kane's article, whether or not you're in defi, because one of the key takeaways from his article was that he says something to the effect of, it seems like they made a lot of pivots and a lot of versions that synthetics, versions that launched in the past. And some of the design decisions felt like mistakes. In hindsight, however, every single one of these mistakes were unavoidable, and they also led to new lessons about these things. And a lot of the decisions were due to the fact that the enabling technologies simply didn't exist. For example, Chainlink didn't exist in the early days. They couldn't even build an efficient derivative trading without front running without a good oracle. So my takeaway of that is building a product, especially in crypto, is extremely path dependent.
00:08:30.426 - 00:08:53.730, Speaker C: And it goes back to one of the earliest lessons that we talked about in our last episode with the tensor guys, which that you have to survive long enough to get lucky, because you have to survive long enough for the enabling technologies to become maturing enough for your own product to succeed. So it's one of the most insightful articles I've ever seen from a founder.
00:08:53.810 - 00:09:31.314, Speaker A: It also goes back to our conversation with Amir Halim, the founder of Helium. You got to survive long enough, and luck will plan to the founder's future or the startup's future. And I think this is a very good pattern. Right. If you are focused and you're know there are opportunities for you to find a solution, right, to the problem that you're incurring, it's just think pet dependent and stay focused. All right, well, I think this is a good summary into our conversation with Kane and Dan, so let's get them on. Welcome to good game.
00:09:31.314 - 00:10:01.406, Speaker A: We have two guests, both have done a lot for, for crypto and Defi. One is Dan Elitzer. If you know Dan, he was one of the main people behind the MIT purchase of bitcoin back in the day. And then also the superfluid article right before Defi summer, and then the most recent article about why Defi is broken. And obviously we have Kane, who started Haven Synthetix. And really, I would say the OG Defi godfather. Right.
00:10:01.406 - 00:10:25.626, Speaker A: If you think about the liquidity mining program, or even if you read Kane's most recent article about how synthetix, it's oracle that launched early on. It helped introduce that oracle system to chainlink, and Chainlink started to use that as a way to drive its own business. And we'll talk a bit about that in a bit. But before we get started, chow, Dan Kane, anything that you'd like to add before we kind of dive deep?
00:10:25.678 - 00:10:36.040, Speaker D: Well, I mean, I guess I've heavily contributed to breaking Defi, I suppose, right. Based on the thesis of that post. So it'll be an interesting conversation, I guess.
00:10:36.490 - 00:10:56.990, Speaker A: Definitely. Cool. So is Defi broken? Dan, you mentioned primitives in and itself should have no external dependencies. Right. And so you highlight three, right. One is contract upgradability, governance and oracles. And so the question is, is it really like, and we'll start with oracles as an example.
00:10:56.990 - 00:11:25.606, Speaker A: We've seen a whole wave of startups that are building a space. Ajna, who was a part of Alliance's last batch, that's building an oracle less lending protocol. You have Metastreet, you have blur paradigms, blend, et cetera, that are starting to build around this design landscape. And the question really is, do we need oracles or can we use what we have today? Right? Do we need oracles or not? That's really the impetus of the question here.
00:11:25.708 - 00:12:07.890, Speaker B: Yeah, I would say first and foremost, yes, we do need oracles. I'm not at all arguing that oracles don't serve a very important role in DeFi, both in terms of how we've gotten to where we are today and in terms of what Defi will grow and become in the future. What my article is trying to make the case for is that there's currently a lot of protocols that like to style themselves as primitives, in that they say, hey, we're composable. You can build other things on top of us. And what I was proposing is that we really should be a little bit more specific in what we consider as a primitive versus just a composable protocol. Right. One of the beauties of DeFi is that pretty much everything is composable.
00:12:07.890 - 00:13:21.822, Speaker B: But for a primitive, I think we need to say, okay, what exists at the lowest level? And it's hard to say something is at the lowest level if it has meaningful external dependencies. And so if you can upgrade the contract via either administrative privileges or via governance, you need to think about all sorts of risk models around how those upgrades can happen, that they can change basically everything about the protocol. If you have an oracle, you need to think very carefully about how is that oracle functioning? What is the risk model for that oracle? What are the tolerances in terms of both the timeliness and the accuracy of the data being fed in by that oracle. There's just so many other things that you need to be thinking about. And so I think it is very helpful if we have an increasing number of things we really can think of as primitives that anybody can build on top of, and that we can have a higher degree of confidence in terms of the security of those contracts because there are less external dependencies that we need to think about. And so therefore they become the base on top of which a lot of other things are built.
00:13:21.956 - 00:15:14.122, Speaker D: It sounds to me like just a web3 version of platform risk right? Like the platform risk discussion, right? Like should you build on meta or Facebook or Instagram when they can rug you pretty easily and change their APIs or change their terms or whatever, right? And in an ideal world, you don't build on platforms that are not open, or at least where you don't have the level of confidence that the thing that you're building is going to get rubbed. I mean, we've got a similar situation happening now with Chat GPT, right? There's a whole bunch of people who are building products like jamming Chat GPT into some existing product or some existing category of product, right? And we don't know what OpenAI is going to do with Chat GPT and their APIs and whatever in a month, let alone a year or whatever downstream. I've thought about platform risk a lot. I've talked about in some of the articles that I've written, even Ethereum has level platform risk, right? People forget, but Ethereum is an upgradable system, right? And we had an issue, I think it was Kyber, if I remember correctly, back in 2018, there was an EIP that was going to break a whole bunch of stuff and they were like, whoa, does anyone talk to the people building smart contracts? And core devs are like, wait, people are building smart contracts? What are you talking about? And so there was this sense of like, oh, yeah, sorry, guys, we didn't even think to mention that this was like a breaking change, right? And eventually it got sorted out. But on some level, the world is a platform and the world is not static. And you always have to accept some level of risk for building on platform. And hoping to get to a point where there's minimal platform risk, I think is an ideal.
00:15:14.122 - 00:15:25.026, Speaker D: But I think in reality, for most people, you just need to weigh up the options of what you're doing and what the trade offs are and kind of accept that there's always going to be some level of platform risk and you just try and minimize it.
00:15:25.128 - 00:16:01.370, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's a fair analog. I think a lot of similarities with platform risk here. I think the angle that I was approaching this from is really more from a security mindset though, right? And so the difference being like, hey, can an upgrade or change of rules make a product non functional? That's bad. Can that result in a loss of funds? That's even worse, right? And so I think it's helpful to have a little bit of distinction there. But I do agree that there's a great deal of overlap between dependencies from a security perspective and dependencies from a product platform perspective.
00:16:01.450 - 00:16:22.694, Speaker D: Well, I mean, again, I feel like security is a subset of platform risk, right? Like if you're inheriting your security from something you're building on. We inherit our security from Ethereum, right. Ethereum recently decided to change its consensus mechanism, right? And so we all inherited that change whether we liked it or not.
00:16:22.732 - 00:16:23.030, Speaker A: Right?
00:16:23.100 - 00:16:36.940, Speaker D: And so yes, on some level, security is a really critical thing for smart contracts. But in my view, security is when you build on something else. Security is just a subset of the different things that you're inheriting from that platform.
00:16:37.710 - 00:17:12.882, Speaker C: Fair. I want to dig a little bit deeper into this topic of security and how we can potentially solve security by removing oracles. I have a couple questions. The first question is super straightforward. Dan, you talk a lot about how removing security, or you talk a lot about the importance of security, but what are some of the very concrete examples of recent hacks in Defi or hacks or exploits or attacks that were results of oracles?
00:17:13.026 - 00:18:18.214, Speaker B: Well, I think it's important to differentiate between things where the oracle was broken or things where there's been price manipulation that gets tied in with the fact that then there is an oracle involved, right? So we look at, for example, things that happen with mango markets and the attacks there that in theory the same theoretical attack was possible on compound and aave as well. And it was not due to the oracle being faulty, it was due to the fact that the market manipulated and the way these protocols were functioning, it could lead to loss of funds. So again, I'm not arguing that we should not use oracles at all. The case was, I think it leads to a very interesting design space. When you design on top of primitives, that the primitives themselves don't have oracles, in most cases you will want to pull in some sort of oracle on top. Right. And even just from a pure UX perspective, if you think about managing positions on univ.
00:18:18.214 - 00:18:52.658, Speaker B: Three, right, there's very few people who are going to go in there and who are going to manually update positions. And so they've turned to Arrakis and gamma and a bunch of other things to manage positions. Synthetix has similar things built on top to enable people to more easily manage some of the positions that they're opening and closing there too. So I think this is a pretty well established thing. And I think it's interesting when you can design protocols to not need them at the base layer, even if there will be various services built on top that use them in some form or fashion.
00:18:52.754 - 00:19:31.058, Speaker C: So in the case of mango, right, just curious what you think exactly, because in the case of mango, I think the hack was due to the protocol using super illiquid assets as collateral for people to do trading and margin trading. Is your position, I'm curious both Dan and Kane, but is your guys position that mango should not use an oracle at all? Meaning they should design a system that's oracle less? Or should they have avoided using those illiquid assets as collateral? But while it's okay to use oracles in this particular case, there's multiple ways.
00:19:31.144 - 00:20:52.270, Speaker B: You could have avoided that, right? Like don't use illiquid assets or cap them, or there's all sorts of levers that they had to pull as we saw then with both compound and aave, kind of like quickly pushing through changes through their governance to reduce the risk from some of the kind of longer tail assets that they were including in their pools. I do think that it is possible on top of Ajna or other protocols that are built to not have oracles as part, you can rebuild the pooled lending experience that you have from a mango markets or a compound or an ave. The one thing that I don't have a good solution to rebuild there is allowing for cross margin in the system that you would build on top. And if you actually look at a lot of usage that you're seeing of these blending pools today, there's not a ton of people making use of meaningful amounts of cross margin. So I think there are some users for whom that is an absolute requirement and they'll want that. But I think there's a larger set of users that would benefit from the increased security of having isolated markets that are then pulled together in, I would say, risk adjusted vaults to rebalance between the isolated markets. So we'll see folks like Oasis and Defi saver and others who are kind of building tools on top.
00:20:52.270 - 00:21:13.202, Speaker B: So yes, you can recreate a mango markets that would enable use of some of these long tail assets, but not expose all users of the protocol to that risk. They could opt out of exposure to specific assets or more clearly opt into only the risks that they would want to be exposed to.
00:21:13.336 - 00:21:54.402, Speaker D: I think the first thing I should probably point out is my career is predicated on using illiquid assets for collateral. So I would have to say I'm probably in the pro camp, unfortunately, on that one. But I think siloing risk and removing oracles are sort of two approaches to the same thing realistically. Right, synthetics right now operates like this, right? Like every asset is in a giant pool. It only takes one asset to fail. So one oracle failure will cascade through the entire system and make the entire system insolvent, which is not ideal. And so what we've done in synthetics v three is to basically silo these things, right.
00:21:54.402 - 00:22:41.502, Speaker D: And then even within the system, we can then recombine them into larger markets. If people want an easy cross margin experience, we say, okay, well, these are all the assets that are deeply liquid, bitcoin, ethereum, et cetera. And we can sort of recombine them in a higher layer to allow people to have that same experience that they have now, just trading in and out between them and leveraging the same margin and not worrying about all of that stuff. But if something's really liquid, then we're going to silo it off, right, but we still use an oracle, but we just keep that quarterized. So if that oracle blows up or if the asset blows up or something goes to zero or whatever. So I think both of those are risk mitigating approaches that you can have. But regardless, if you've got a liquid assets, you probably should be siloing them.
00:22:41.502 - 00:22:43.486, Speaker D: You shouldn't have them all in a giant pool.
00:22:43.598 - 00:23:28.618, Speaker B: Absolutely. And I think that ties to Defi is broken is very much like trying to an attention grabbing headline. Right? I think DeFi has grown tremendously, right. We've all been around to see this growth from basically nothing to where it is today, and that is tremendous growth. And obviously something is working to be able to get it to this stage. And I think the case that I'm making is more that the DeFi that we have today is not the DeFi that is going to be able to get to global mainstream adoption because we have not done enough of these risk mitigation approaches. We've been thinking about bootstrapping usage and doing everything we can to grow the ecosystem.
00:23:28.618 - 00:25:03.694, Speaker B: And I think we're at a point where, again, we've all been through bear markets before, where bear markets are a great time to step back and reflect and say, hey, are we building this the right way? Are we going to get another step function increase in users tomorrow? Probably not. Let's use this time where everyone's not like hair on fire, growing like crazy to say, is there any kind of technical debt, ecosystem debt that we should go and we should clean up so we have stronger foundations for that next leg up in growth? And so the ideas I covered in that piece were just a few ideas. There's a number of others that we'll be writing about and circling around things like thinking intelligently about circuit breakers around kind of multiparty guardian contracts, things that can tie into both account abstraction wallets and existing kind of EOA style wallets, things around upping the security spend that we have, tying it more closely to bounties, more closely to value at risk. There's a number of things we can do, as you mentioned, Kane, like really siloing, isolating risk around specific assets, specific protocols, and then kind of growing that over time. These are all things that we can do. And I think there just hasn't been enough collective attention across our industry on these things because we were so first growth focused and then, oh, man, we're just watching number go down, number go down, and it's depressing. And I think the point is, well, it's not always going to be number go down, number will go up again.
00:25:03.694 - 00:25:17.922, Speaker B: And so let's take this time to think carefully about how we're building so when number does go up, we're ready to support it and we can actually go out and make the case that this is financial infrastructure for the world.
00:25:18.056 - 00:25:56.186, Speaker C: I feel like another reason why we haven't really paid attention as an industry to these security loopholes is that I just feel like, of course there has been so many hacks, but there has not been enough hacks for us to care about things enough. The mango hack, it's a hack that happened multiple times. Mango was not even the first one. The same hack happened in many protocols. But in terms of this other example that came that you brought up, that if one oracle fails, it would cascade into the rest of the protocol. Is there any concrete example of this type of incidents?
00:25:56.298 - 00:26:36.460, Speaker D: There's an example that happened in synthetics. It actually happened to us, the ETH oracle, when we were running our own oracles before we switched to chain link, I get my years wrong because I'm too old these days, but I feel like this was like July of 2019 or something like this, maybe June of 2019, our centralized oracle failed, and basically the price of korean won changed, and someone was trading between korean one and ETH. And so the ratio of korean one to ETH was so extreme that they ended up with like 11 billion synthetic ETH or something like that. Right. It was some crazy number, right. And so the protocol was totally insolvent, and that led to a whole series of consequences. But this has happened.
00:26:36.460 - 00:26:45.470, Speaker D: The whole protocol was insolvent, basically because of one account that had whatever it was at that time, probably $11 billion or something like that.
00:26:45.620 - 00:26:48.190, Speaker C: This was like synthetics v one or something.
00:26:48.260 - 00:27:22.714, Speaker D: Yeah, this is synthetics v one. This is like. Right, this is in the first, like four months after we launched it, I think in March. Yeah, March. So, yeah, we've seen that happen, and it's not great, obviously, but one of the things that upgradability. I've written a lot about this, right? Upgradability and the fact that if you build something that is designed to kind of launch and just exist and operate into the future and it's not upgradable, it can't be iterated on or whatever, the likelihood of that working is like zero. Right.
00:27:22.714 - 00:27:50.446, Speaker D: We have very few examples, like Uniswap is one, and even Uniswap is kind of not one because there's been iterations of Uniswap. But obviously it was not upgradable contract. It just happened to be a class of contract where you could deploy new markets, and it kind of wasn't that impactful to get people to switch liquidity from one market to another. And so it didn't require some huge. They didn't have a token at the time either. So that helps as well. Right? The token wasn't involved in any kind of interaction with the protocol.
00:27:50.446 - 00:27:51.582, Speaker D: It was all just lps.
00:27:51.646 - 00:27:51.874, Speaker C: Right.
00:27:51.912 - 00:28:23.902, Speaker D: So lps had to go and upgrade their lp tokens to new markets. But whatever. Almost every other example that I can think of of someone who, some project that built something in that style fails, right. Because it's really hard to get something right and allow the market to test it. I do have a fundamental, philosophical, I guess, point of difference, I suppose, in terms of just this, making things that are immutable and hoping that they work right. I think that's a very challenging thing to do.
00:28:23.956 - 00:28:55.542, Speaker B: Well, I think there's a question about the level of immutability. I think you're right about uniswap. But even look at like compound and Ave, while they both are upgradable with their current versions, they're both on v three now, and they've had to migrate lps, like manually go from v one to v two to v three. And so uniswap is not the only meaningful protocol that's had to encourage users to migrate over, opt into a new version, as opposed to unilaterally do it via governance. Right?
00:28:55.596 - 00:28:55.958, Speaker A: Sure.
00:28:56.044 - 00:28:56.438, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:28:56.524 - 00:29:53.862, Speaker B: But I do see your point that there are certain constraints that come with doing something immutably, and I don't think that there are very many, if any, protocols that you can deploy today, and people are still going to be primarily using that contract a decade from now. But I do think that one of the things that you get from this and that uniswap very much got from this and some of these other ones got to lesser extents, but is also meaningful is when you're at least limiting the scope of what can be upgraded and what can be done there. You already cut off certain amounts of attack surface. Right. The fewer things that can be upgraded, the fewer things you have to kind of worry about that could potentially go wrong. And so I think there is the extreme version of saying, hey, here is a complete primitive. No upgradability, no external dependencies.
00:29:53.862 - 00:30:14.994, Speaker B: It is what it is and we'll move everybody over to something new if there's any meaningful change that needs to be made. And then there's, okay, well, maybe we have governance and we will be willing to swap in a different oracle system or a different interest rate curve or something like that. There are limited things that you want to be able to do.
00:30:15.032 - 00:30:18.030, Speaker D: I mean, even just like parameterization of markets.
00:30:18.190 - 00:30:18.802, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:30:18.936 - 00:30:19.486, Speaker D: And compound.
00:30:19.518 - 00:30:19.858, Speaker B: Right.
00:30:19.944 - 00:30:24.100, Speaker D: They weren't immutable. You had the ability to make changes to the markets and stuff.
00:30:24.790 - 00:31:30.122, Speaker B: Yeah, I do think fundamentally though, I'm very interested in protocol designs where there's less parameterization that needs to be done and then there can be more market forces determining that. Or people basically permissionlessly deploying their own version with their own parameters that then people can opt into the parameters they like the best. And it's hard when we're in a very expensive, high gas fee environment where kind of aggregation across multiple pools or multiple markets can be very expensive. But assuming that we are over time moving to places where it's going to be cheaper to access block space and the compute that's needed, the cost will go down. That I think opens up a lot more room for these types of designs where you don't need to permission certain parameters, permission pool deployment permission, different versions of the same pool getting deployed. Like Uniswap having the different fee sizes, right. They just say, hey, any fee size, deploy whatever you want.
00:31:30.122 - 00:31:56.174, Speaker B: But they wanted to concentrate at the time because they were so worried about liquidity fragmentation across all these different pools. I think now we've seen that liquidity tends to collect around certain points anyway. And so I don't know if knowing what we know now, if the Uniswap team or others would have felt the need to make a similar choice with constraints trying to force consolidation around very specific fee tiers.
00:31:56.222 - 00:32:12.694, Speaker D: Yeah, that's fair. I think there's another component for me, which is that a lot of us had this idea, right? And I'm sure I've explicitly stated this, that, okay, we just need governance for a while to figure out the challenges and then eventually we'll get it right and then we'll hand it over.
00:32:12.732 - 00:32:13.874, Speaker B: Just one more hit, I swear.
00:32:13.922 - 00:33:34.818, Speaker D: Yeah, exactly. And I think probably sometime in the last couple of years I've come to the conclusion that markets and the environment that you're operating in is ever changing, right? Like you're never going to have a stable environment in which to deploy this immutable, beautiful thing, even if you iterated on it for a decade and you're like, okay, this is finally the thing, right? Something will happen, something about the world will change and you'll need to be able to respond to that. And if you have cut old bridges even to the level of like, okay, you know, they change, like in synthetics, right? Let's say we get to a point where we say, okay, we're giving away all of the control except for the ability to change parameters. Anyone can deploy a market and then those parameters and the parameters are constrained and that's it, right? I guarantee ten minutes later someone will deploy something and we'll be like, oh man, we didn't think about that. And now we need to like, what the fuck are we supposed to do here, right? I guarantee you that will happen. So there is a point, I guess, of operating the real world where I've just come to the conclusion that what you actually need is robust upgradability and we need more Lindy on the upgrade processes and governance, which is another area that I think hasn't had enough investment in and enough testing. A lot of people still running around with nosis safes and snapshot, right? Like we can do better.
00:33:34.818 - 00:33:51.990, Speaker D: And so if that process were more robust and we've had more confidence in that, then it would allow for kind of safer iteration and the ability to. But it philosophically is a different, it's a fork, right? Like you're going in one direction versus another.
00:33:52.140 - 00:34:33.042, Speaker B: I think the beautiful thing is we can run both experiments in parallel, right? I think we all, we all just agree we need fewer protocols, fewer users getting wrecked. And one way to do it is be a lot more stringent around the upgrade process with existing things. Other thing is like, hey, what does it look like if we remove all the ability to upgrade and we kind of build from that as a starting point and we can run these in parallel? And that's, I think one of the things that's so exciting and beautiful about crypto is that we don't need to ask permission. If you've got this vision for this is the best way to do it, I've got a vision. This is the best way to do it. We can both run it and see where users migrate. And so I think that's great and I'm excited to see it.
00:34:33.096 - 00:34:34.274, Speaker D: Yeah, I agree on that for sure.
00:34:34.312 - 00:35:04.462, Speaker C: Well, you said earlier you want to see us move to a world where there's less parameterization and more market forces. That comment reminded me of Uniswap v three versus v two. It also reminded me of blend, the landing protocol of blur, and it also reminded me of ashna. Since these are pretty hot topics recently, maybe give our audience an overview of how these oracle less market force driven landing platforms work.
00:35:04.596 - 00:35:55.054, Speaker B: Sure. So they're all a little bit different in terms of how they do things. But one of the unifying factors here and the way that they do that is that there's a collateral asset and there's a, quote, asset. And so the person who's willing to lend an asset, say USDC, will say, hey, here is the amount of collateral in terms of number of units of this other asset that I expect to be there for each one unit of my, quote, asset of USDC that I'm willing to lend. And they're essentially implying a belief about the price in dollars or relative value for that piece of collateral and the point at which they would expect this loan to be liquidated either by themselves or by a third party that is incentivized in some way.
00:35:55.172 - 00:36:08.638, Speaker C: I think I know the answer to this, but I'm curious what you think. It sounds like blur and ajna, they both replace the dependency on oracles with dependency on market participants. Basically the liquidators.
00:36:08.734 - 00:37:07.766, Speaker B: Liquidators are also needed in traditional protocols that have oracles as well. So that piece isn't necessarily different. What might be more different is needing to, I would say, monitor and update the terms of your loan, either for the existing loan, maybe you're not going to renew it. If it's a term loan, or if it is a kind of perpetual loan, then like updating the kind of ticks that you're lending within, in the case of Ajna. But what I would say is for all of these protocols that you've described, like blurs, blend, Ajna, and you mentioned Univ. Three, I think as well. All of these things, if you think about what they're doing, they're moving further away from a broad spectrum, kind of like automated system like amm, or just pooled with a single interest rate curve to something that is more akin to an order book.
00:37:07.766 - 00:38:22.234, Speaker B: And they're designed in a way that has some of the kind of automation or kind of guardrails for thinking about how to structure things that are reminiscent of the earlier versions of Amms and pooled products. But they're moving closer to order books. And I think ultimately order books are actually an efficient end state. And we needed to use these broad spectrum amms and just automated models generally, and pooled models generally as a way of bootstrapping the ecosystem to where it is today. But if you look at where you're getting, and I would say trading is more advanced than lending in this regard, but if you look at how the Dex markets have evolved, we're starting to see a lot of the spot markets move to have RFQ systems being inserted into things like Xerox's API and Matcha, and one inch where they're actually getting closer and closer back to order books. We still can't do fully on chain efficient order books that work, but the markets are maturing to a place where I have no doubt that that is where the majority of the volume is ultimately going to land. Even in this decentralized exchange context and decentralized lending context will be order book like models.
00:38:22.234 - 00:38:55.986, Speaker B: We will not leave amms behind. We will not leave pooled models behind, but they will likely be constituted on top of underlying order book like systems. And then you'll just have the automated kind of, or pooled models that will provide a user experience option for less sophisticated players who want to opt into that, while professionals, big firms who want to do it, can more get closer to the metal, so to speak, and be able to access the order books directly.
00:38:56.098 - 00:39:57.930, Speaker D: I think one challenge with this, right, is there's like, sort of presupposes the level of sophistication on both sides, right? And in the case of blend, for example, I know we saw a little bit of adversarial behavior here, but I would argue, thank fucking God that we're in a bear market, because the amount of people that would have gotten wrecked by blend if we were not in a bear market would have been astronomical. It would have been insane, right? Because in an inefficient market on the lending side, right, the ability for people to create these kind of lending traps, and then the ability for people to take those lending traps and then go and yolo into something else, and we saw what people did with compound when they were yield, farming, recycling, dye, into whatever. Right. People will do crazy stuff when the incentives are there. Thankfully, we didn't have those incentives. And so I think that it was pretty minimal. But there is an assumption of sophistication on the part of both parties in an oracleist lending protocol, for example, which maybe is fair.
00:39:57.930 - 00:40:14.814, Speaker D: Like, maybe that's a fair enough assumption that someone who wants to borrow against NFT should. But on paper it is. On paper it's like, yeah, someone who's borrowing against an NFT should have a level of sophistication to understand what they're doing. But we all know in reality that that is certainly at the moment not the case.
00:40:14.932 - 00:40:49.094, Speaker B: I guess the case I'd make is that there's going to be kind of the safe options or the lower risk options that can be built on top of those models. And so, yeah, if you want to dgen Yolo yourself, yeah, that's always going to be risky. But if you want to go to something that's like, hey, we're never going to lend at more than a 50% collateral factor here. Right. You can opt into that. You're not going to earn as much as someone who's willing to go to 95%, but the option will exist and you can still build that lower risk experience on top of these markets.
00:40:49.222 - 00:41:01.354, Speaker A: Yeah, going back to the oracle conversation, so it seems like the consensus here is that obviously oracles are needed, but at least from your perspective, Dan, you're saying that it should be in a layered approach.
00:41:01.402 - 00:41:01.614, Speaker C: Right?
00:41:01.652 - 00:41:50.734, Speaker A: So maybe you can add oasis or others are building on top of these primitives that can offer kind of your bring your own oracles. But I do think there are still some issues with oracles today as it is. Kane, you mentioned in your article the push versus pull kind of thesis, where you first started with push, then pull became even more important. But it started out that you had people front running the price feed and you're getting people that are exploiting the price within the synthetics platform. And so you recently launched an approved SIP 279, which added Oracle price and premium. So it is a way to kind of mitigate that. So I guess the question I'm saying, I'm asking here is, are we happy with our current oracle design systems? And if not, where do we want to be in order for defi to be, as Dan mentioned, to get to.
00:41:50.772 - 00:42:03.714, Speaker D: Billions of, you know, I kind of made a joke about this in the article, right. Someone came along and decided build a new oracle. And I thought that we decided that Chainlink competitors were dead in the water many years ago.
00:42:03.752 - 00:42:04.098, Speaker A: Right.
00:42:04.184 - 00:42:45.278, Speaker D: And I think where the innovation has probably been has been moving away from oracles completely. It's been this kind of binary thing. It's been like, okay, we're either going to do oracles, which is chain link, obviously, or we're going to try and create some oracleist design. Right. Most of the 2017 to 2019 era oracles are kind of gone. And then we had this new oracle provider pop up who was coming from, I guess, a bit more of a tradfi background with different set of constraints and what have you coming from, I guess the Solana ecosystem primarily, and just saying like, hey, we're going to try and do something different. This is going to be a different approach.
00:42:45.278 - 00:43:41.602, Speaker D: And so I think fundamentally, competition is good, right? If Chainlink has a monopoly on oracles and Defi, that's probably not a good thing. I think there's a lot of reasons why Chainlink kind of won that battle, why they dominated the market so effectively for such a long time. But I do think competition is good, right? I don't think that we want a competitionless market. And so that will force everyone to get better if there are alternative approaches to oracles. Right. And I include Oracle list designs as well. Like, if oracle list designs become so good, well, then oracles will need to respond and be like, okay, well, what are the trade offs that we have from oracles? Is it security? Is it some assumptions around trust, et cetera, et cetera? Okay, how do we make these designs more trustless? Or how do we make the incentives better? But in absence of that kind of market forces and the pressure that you have from competition, you can kind of just rest on your laurels and be like, no, we've got this.
00:43:41.602 - 00:43:47.058, Speaker D: No problem. Right. So I do think that it makes sense for us to foster competition as much as possible.
00:43:47.144 - 00:43:47.938, Speaker A: No question.
00:43:48.104 - 00:43:54.534, Speaker C: Ken, you mentioned the front running problem in your article. Can you explain to our audience what is the front running problem? Yeah.
00:43:54.572 - 00:45:11.086, Speaker D: So when you take some information about an off chain asset, let's say gold, right? So you got the price of gold, right? So the world has some consensus price of gold that it's got somehow across all the different markets that it's trading, whether it's paper gold or spot gold or OTC or whatever, right? And it's pretty accurate. The spread is pretty tight. Right. There's a lot of gold trading, and we kind of have a sense of what's going on. How do we tell ethereum, which doesn't have a clue, what gold is? Ethereum the network doesn't know what gold is. How do we tell it what this thing is and what the price is? How do we let it know, right? And the solution that we have now is we get a whole bunch of people to read the price of gold from the world, to go out and pull that price of gold from somewhere, get together through some consensus mechanism to make sure that they all agree on what the price is, right? And then having agreed there's some system to off chain system to get them to agree, they then push that price into the network. And now we know the price, right? And just inherently in that process of the world deciding the price, a group of people getting together, observing that price, working out amongst themselves.
00:45:11.086 - 00:46:00.634, Speaker D: If they all agree on what the actual price is and then pushing it in there, there's latency. There's just an amount of time that it takes for us to get the world's price onto Ethereum, right? And then Ethereum has its own block times, et cetera, et cetera. And so this can take 30 seconds, 40 seconds, or whatever. And so what you have is a situation where there is a stale price, effectively the last round price of gold, right? And if the price of gold moves significantly in a 1020 32nd window for some reason, then the update to get the new price on chain needs to be as quick as possible. But it's never going to be as fast as someone just observing the world independently and looking at the price of gold and saying, oh, wait, okay, it was $2,000 an ounce. Now it's $2,500 an ounce. I'm going to go and trade on this old, stale price, right? That's on Ethereum.
00:46:00.634 - 00:46:37.882, Speaker D: And Ethereum only knows that price. So anything that's reading that price from that oracle, the price is $2,000. Everyone on Ethereum at that moment thinks that the price is $2,000 until this process updates it to $2,500. And so that opportunity is basically for someone to come and trade against that sale price and front run the update of the price. And you can compress this down a lot, down to, like seconds, right? But it's still not going to be fast enough. And so the solution is to, rather than reading that price off chain, to say, anyone who wants to trade on the price of gold, we've got a price. At the moment it's $2,000.
00:46:37.882 - 00:46:58.900, Speaker D: But if you want to trade on the price of gold, you actually need to go out and ask for the price over here, which you'll get $2,500. Now, because that's the new price. And then you roll up that transaction and you push it in yourself and you say, hey, I've got the latest price of gold. I can prove it. And then you send that onto the network and the network goes, yes, you did prove that. You got the latest price of gold. Here you go.
00:46:59.510 - 00:47:07.542, Speaker C: This is the pull versus push model. The push model has a latency of 30 seconds, but the pull model, basically get the latest price.
00:47:07.676 - 00:47:09.446, Speaker D: You get the latest price. Yeah, exactly.
00:47:09.628 - 00:47:10.406, Speaker C: Got it.
00:47:10.508 - 00:47:15.094, Speaker A: And the reason why you couldn't do this before was because the time.
00:47:15.132 - 00:47:29.574, Speaker D: Right. Mainly we're idiots. I don't know. We had an idea of doing that. But the design of synthetics at the time was not about fast trading.
00:47:29.622 - 00:47:29.786, Speaker C: Right?
00:47:29.808 - 00:47:43.870, Speaker D: It wasn't about low latency trading. It was about a bunch of spot tokens that basically represent the price of these different assets that you could trade in between. The whole design of the system, the intent, even behind the system, was very different.
00:47:44.020 - 00:48:20.282, Speaker B: The story, not the whole story of synthetics, but part of the story of synthetics has been like finding all the different ways that oracles can be abused and then having to patch that. Right. I think the first time I even heard of the concept of front running oracles or back running oracles was from synthetix, because there were users who had figured this out, were exploiting. It was like, oh, shoot, we need to close that door. And there's different approaches that you can take. But as you said, inherently blockchains are slower than non blockchains. Right.
00:48:20.282 - 00:48:44.738, Speaker B: The rest of the world. And so in that latency, there's always going to be these kind of arbitrage opportunities. And so trying to pretend those don't exist and hand wave them away doesn't work. You need to design with the assumption that, a, we're going to try to minimize those things, but then, b, to the extent we can't minimize them, we need to make sure that it's really hard, if not impossible, to exploit them within our system.
00:48:44.904 - 00:49:12.294, Speaker D: Exactly. And ultimately, what was synthetics for the first four years of existence? It was like a giant honey pot for testing oracle latency, right. It was like a giant pool of money that anyone could access if they could find a way to break this oracle design. And it was this iterative game of like, okay, someone broke it in that way, let's fix it. Someone broke it in this way. People would do like off chain, centralized exchange manipulation. Then they'd do on chain manipulation, then they'd do some combinate.
00:49:12.294 - 00:49:27.570, Speaker D: It was all kinds of crazy stuff. And so it was just this continuous game. Most people would not be crazy enough to actually connect the pot of money to the thing and be like, go nuts. But thankfully, I guess it was maybe a public good on some level of synthetics to do that.
00:49:27.720 - 00:49:29.758, Speaker A: Why not use uniswap twap?
00:49:29.854 - 00:50:17.346, Speaker D: So there are issues with. Yeah, one of the designs that we got to was actually using like a hybrid using uniswap twap plus an off chain oracle as a way of validating the price. And look, twap oracles got better over time. The original TWap oracle was kind of subject to a little bit of, I guess, uncertainty around, like if someone was trying to manipulate the price. I think the TWap oracles are better now, but you have to remember that there's, and this is one of the oracle list kind of design constraints is you need a liquid market to generate the information that you want. So like, tio of Oracle is on eth USDC. Sure, right.
00:50:17.346 - 00:50:32.646, Speaker D: But at one point, I'm sure we did, you know, someone will kill me if we didn't, but I'm sure we did just assumed that the t watt price of USDC etH, which I think was the most know Eth to USD market, was one.
00:50:32.748 - 00:50:33.062, Speaker B: Right.
00:50:33.116 - 00:51:10.558, Speaker D: And then USDC deep. Now, had we still been using that same oracle design, I think we probably would have had a problem there. Because how do we know it's a ratio of two things, right? Like how do we know that the one to one ratio thing, we need another oracle to go and make sure that USDC to USDT to what if that's just, you go down a rabbit hole of challenges when you start designing these systems and you try and make them robust to any kind of failure mode if they are fully on chain and there is no off chain arbiter of reality.
00:51:10.654 - 00:51:51.470, Speaker B: And there's an inherent trade off in terms of these twap oracles also, right, in terms of, if you want to be highly accurate up to date on this, you need to have a very short look back window, but then it's more easily manipulated. So use a longer look back window, but then it's not as accurate of a price to where you are today, which is really bad if you're doing like high amounts of leverage. Right. There's some trade offs, trade offs all the way down. And there's not fundamentally, I think, a way that you can solve that with Twap oracles. So they kind of hit a limit at one point. But I think to your point, though? What's exciting to me about the potential in the future where we're headed is that we're talking right now.
00:51:51.470 - 00:52:37.358, Speaker B: One of the reasons why I think synthetix has been so exciting to so many people is because the universe of assets that exist off chain is so much larger than the universe of assets that sits on chain. And even the assets that are traded both on chain and off chain. Usually there is a larger market. The primary market sits off chain on an exchange. And what's exciting to me is that we're now getting to a place where there is an increasing number of assets, where the primary market is on chain. And as we get to the place where the primary market is on chain, the on chain market, that is the price that is determining the price, right? And the people trading off chain are looking at the on chain market to decide what's the price that I should try to trade at. Update on this off chain market.
00:52:37.358 - 00:52:48.458, Speaker B: And so I'm very, very excited to see how things evolve and what becomes possible when we start having more primary markets for assets that matter, that exist on chain.
00:52:48.554 - 00:53:58.934, Speaker D: Agreed. Gold is probably a good example of this, right? So let's say you've got a gold asset, and we had this before, like Digix did this, where it's just wrapped gold as a token. If you imagine Digix had kept going and there had been demand for holding this asset, which it's funny, right? You shut something down and then immediately has utility, right? And so that's why you don't shut things down. But let's say today digix still existed and there was wrap gold or whatever. You could imagine a scenario where there's a deeply liquid digix token that I think it was announced, maybe, or I can't remember if it was announced, or a gram, but like a gram of gold to eat, right? And there's a deeply liquid uniswap v three market there, and all of a sudden you kind of have a gold price to some extent, right? That might be deeply liquid enough that it's hard to manipulate and it's arbitraged out really quickly by off chain people trading in the paper gold market or whatever. You can imagine that scenario. So obviously, there's trust assumptions in the people holding the gold token, but as long as you have some kind of circuit breakers, right, to your earlier point, then it's probably okay.
00:53:59.052 - 00:54:33.886, Speaker B: But there's also a lot of trust assumptions in the trading of gold in non blockchain markets, right? So people aren't going to the market primarily and send the price of gold by trading gold bullion for currency. Right? And so there is that. I think the even more further in the future version of that is not that there's deeply liquid markets, it's that the majority of the gold trading market exists on chain. For sure. That's the future that I'm like. That's like the pie in the sky, man. Wouldn't it be amazing if we get there someday version?
00:54:33.998 - 00:55:12.494, Speaker D: But even on some fundamental level, if you think about it, right? And I've been thinking a lot about this lately, right? What are the current constraints or impediments or points of friction for a user who wants to trade gold that makes trading spot gold, a paper gold market better than trading it on Ethereum. And I think we all know there's friction there, right? There's impediments. But one of the impediments is not that they're trading real gold, right? That's not an impediment, right. They're trading a piece of paper that says there's gold in a warehouse somewhere that they can maybe turn up and get access to.
00:55:12.532 - 00:55:12.734, Speaker A: Right?
00:55:12.772 - 00:55:52.540, Speaker D: So that's not one of like people are already doing this with a level of trust that this thing represents gold. So turning the piece of paper that they're trading in a database into a token is not like a crazy leap of faith there, right? It's just how do we get those people connected to those markets and allowed to even trade? There is one challenge, but in terms of, from a trader's perspective, knowing that you're operating this permissionless 24/7 market, that just inherently sounds better as a trader. Right. You're like, well, I'd much rather be there than some weird counterparty thing with all this collateral and whatever. Just let me trade and know what price is. So I think we could get there.
00:55:52.930 - 00:55:57.120, Speaker B: Wouldn't it be nice if we had like regulators that encourage the development of these.
00:55:59.890 - 00:56:02.960, Speaker D: Digic probably would have been sued out of existence if they tried.
00:56:05.750 - 00:56:35.098, Speaker A: Ken, you talked about pith, right, as the other oracle provider that came in. But interesting enough, there's some interesting points to your article that you talked about, which is you weren't too happy with v one when you left, right. And then you came back and obviously v two, we're seeing great traction success. You wanted to continue using chain link because they've been a great provider for the past four years, but the Dow had a governance vote and they voted for someone else.
00:56:35.184 - 00:56:35.578, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:56:35.664 - 00:56:51.002, Speaker A: And so then it kind of talks about Dan's earlier point with this article about governance. Do we need governance at all? You mentioned a point that governance has no bias. Right. And it could make maybe less bias.
00:56:51.066 - 00:56:55.906, Speaker D: I think there's still people, we haven't handed over governance to ais yet, but.
00:56:55.928 - 00:57:18.614, Speaker A: Less of a bias. Right. So the question is then, if we want DeFi to move forward, obviously, I've seen governance throughout different protocols. I've always slowed things down or broke things to a certain degree. So I guess the question here is, do we need governance? Do we want governance? How do we see governance play in the long run when we have hundreds of millions of users? Where do we see this going?
00:57:18.732 - 00:57:32.422, Speaker D: I mean, if we take that exact question. Right, like the specific point there. Right. Okay, so there's an existing oracle. Somehow it got there. We don't know how the decision was made to use that existing oracle. But there's an existing oracle, and now there's a new oracle that exists.
00:57:32.422 - 00:57:46.830, Speaker D: Right. That just was deployed. Right. We didn't even think there wouldn't be a new oracle. But now there is one. Right? And it has a different set of trade offs. And potentially it might be a better oracle, right? Potentially.
00:57:46.830 - 00:58:11.674, Speaker D: And so how do we decide that in an immutable governance less system? You can't. You just have your existing article that you plugged it in ten years ago and it just keeps going. Right? Now, someone needs to make that decision. Some process needs to exist to be able to say there's a new thing that exists in the world and we want to try it out. Right. Maybe we don't want to fully migrate, but maybe we want to integrate in some way. Right? So you have to be able to choose that.
00:58:11.674 - 00:58:31.642, Speaker D: So that is just governance. Absent governance, you can't do that. And in the case of this, let's say you didn't have governance. Let's say you just had some kind of fork based governance, right, which is still governance, but let's say it didn't require anyone to opt in. You just fork the entire thing. That doesn't work with synthetics. There's a finite pool of collateral.
00:58:31.642 - 00:59:01.930, Speaker D: If you fork the collateral, then what is that? Is it even real who wins? Right. That's a battle that I think would play out very poorly for everyone if we get to synthetic sporking over governance. Right? So ultimately someone has to make a decision. So what I propose in that article is you could have a CEO, right? Like, I could still be the CEO or the director of the Haven foundation or whatever the role was. And I say, no, I like Sergey. He's a good friend of mine. We've worked closely together.
00:59:01.930 - 00:59:12.202, Speaker D: I trust, like, we're going chain link, we're not changing. And it doesn't matter what some agitator outside of the hierarchy says, we just dismiss them.
00:59:12.256 - 00:59:12.618, Speaker A: Right?
00:59:12.704 - 00:59:37.090, Speaker D: We don't have that in synthetics, thankfully, because it would not be good. But we've got a different system, which is a whole bunch of people get together and look at it ideally, objectively, with less bias. Right. Certainly not the same personal relationship. The people in spartan council don't have a personal relationship with anyone at Chainlink that I know of. Right. And so they were like, hey, we don't care.
00:59:37.090 - 01:00:07.274, Speaker D: We're just going to go and deploy this other thing. We think it could work, it could be useful, but someone has to, like, there has to be a decision making process. And I guess my argument is, even though in this case, the decision making process went in different direction to what I personally would have done and made a different decision, I still think that process is better. Now, in this particular case, I'm not making a judgment about whether it was the right choice or the wrong choice, but I think in aggregate, dows make better decisions than Kane.
01:00:07.322 - 01:00:07.946, Speaker C: Warwick?
01:00:08.058 - 01:00:14.222, Speaker D: That's just my fundamental belief, and I've seen a lot of bad decisions for myself to validate that. So be hard to challenge that one.
01:00:14.276 - 01:00:23.362, Speaker A: What are your thoughts on that, Dan? Because if you are projecting a world where there's no governance or minimal, like, how do you see that play out?
01:00:23.416 - 01:01:47.022, Speaker B: I mean, look, I think there's so much like, it depends, to paraphrase our friend Gary, facts and circumstances. So if you look at especially early stage, I see a lot of teams want to sprint towards decentralized governance, and I think a lot of that is just due to lack of regulatory clarity. Yeah, but ultimately, I think early on, when you're still trying to iterate rapidly and the product is evolving and you're trying to find product market fit, man, crowds tend to be really bad at that. It's helpful to have some founders, maybe a small team that is able to quickly make decisions that is not just where disproportionate amount of influence goes to the people who have the most time to make long forum posts. Right? And so it's not that it's better to have a centralized decision making process or it's better to have a dow. And by the way, there's people, individuals who make a lot better choices, and there are dows that make a lot better choices, but there's a whole spectrum of both and so you can't really make a blanket statement that one is better than the other. It really depends on the project, what is being governed, where it is in its lifecycle, who's involved, what the processes are, all of these things.
01:01:47.022 - 01:01:50.446, Speaker B: So I think it's really hard to make a blanket statement about, yeah, so.
01:01:50.548 - 01:02:30.246, Speaker D: I guess what I'm saying is in aggregate, in a functional governance system, that the decision making process, given the requirement of transparency, and there's trade offs there, right? Like transparency is good in that at least people have the ability to request information and get it. The problem is, in a competitive landscape, that might not be ideal, right. But I'm saying in terms of getting to the right decision, I think that dows oftentimes, if they're certainly, I can really only speak for the synthetics dow, right. Like I'm involved in some other dows, but I think the synthetics dow is somewhat unique. Right. Obviously, because we really have leaned into this. It's not governance theater.
01:02:30.246 - 01:02:56.254, Speaker D: We actually do let token hold and make decisions via the council. And we've been doing it for years and years. And so there's a process that kind of works. Right. But that said, I totally agree with you. If we'd had a dow deciding whether to pivot from pavement to synthetics, I don't know what the decision would have been there at that time. Whereas I was the one that was like, guys, we're doing even, I know internally, even within the team at the time, people were like, that sounds scary.
01:02:56.254 - 01:03:01.778, Speaker D: Like, are you sure? And I was like, well, come with me or you're dead. So it wasn't really a choice.
01:03:01.874 - 01:04:01.414, Speaker B: It's almost like it's a more extreme version of the dynamics, I think, between startups and kind of like large corporations too, right, where startups are much faster, more nimble. And it's like, oh, not only are you big and have kind of bureaucratic processes and stuff, but, oh, by the way, all of that is out in the open for all of your competitors to see. So it really gives a lot of advantages to some of those earlier teams. And so I think part of the decision becomes like, well, how important is the kind of robust decentralization of the protocol to its continued kind of success? Right. To your point about platform risk, there's probably considerably less platform risk. Building on top of something that is out there has had decentralized governance. We've seen how that works over time versus some new upstart that maybe come over and they're offering higher yields or more assets or all these different things, but we don't know how they make decisions.
01:04:01.414 - 01:04:10.518, Speaker B: We don't know if they'll stay on this course. There's some Lindy that kind of comes along with it because it's slower moving and more transparent in its workings.
01:04:10.614 - 01:05:24.626, Speaker D: I think there's another component as well, and this is probably a little bit incendiary or controversial, but as people operating in the ecosystem for a long time, we're all kind of shared owners, right? There's this shared ownership problem. Matt Levine talks about this, right? Like, the Blackrock owns all the companies and whatever, but the shared ownership is in the form of Ethereum. Within the Ethereum community, we all own ethereum. A lot of the Daos own ether. We collectively own the Ethereum network, right? And so when we are doing things out in the open, that sort of progress, the overall ecosystem, and it is an open source movement, and we publish all of our code, and we don't have weird proprietary things and patents and all kinds of dumb shit IP litigation, all of that stuff allows us to move much faster collectively, even if it is not beneficial to the individual entity, right? And I've always taken that approach, and people have said to me, that's crazy. Don't you want to protect the SNX token's value? What if someone comes and forks it? I'm like, I don't care, right? We will keep doing the thing that makes the most sense for us and we'll do it openly and transparently. The reality is it's kind of a trope that first time founders are like, here's my 80 page NDA that I'm going to give you to tell you about my idea.
01:05:24.626 - 01:06:16.158, Speaker D: And it's like, no, you idiot, no one cares about your idea. We're doing other stuff, right? And so there is some level where it's just like, do the stuff, do it out in the open. Do transparent experiments out in the open and just see what happens. And collectively, the ethereum ecosystem will get better, right? Like, we'll push ahead there. And we've seen that a lot with synthetics, where people have taken things from within synthetics and gone and used them sometimes to compete with us, sometimes in totally different directions, right? Same thing for Maker Ave, all of that stuff. So it's not a pure capitalist approach, I would say, because there is this kind of collective ownership and there is a sort of element of kind of shared purpose, even with competitors. Like, if it turns out that GMX has some amazing solution, that is some combination of three other protocols that existed before them, and they end up dominating.
01:06:16.158 - 01:06:29.770, Speaker D: And that means that arbitrum is the place where all of perpetual futures activity happened, that it's not happening on centralized exchanges. On some level, I'm okay with, like, I lost the game, but I won a longer term play.
01:06:29.920 - 01:06:31.802, Speaker A: What do you think is the future.
01:06:31.856 - 01:06:33.900, Speaker D: Of Defi, Dan, you want to take?
01:06:37.550 - 01:08:05.378, Speaker B: Yeah, I think one of the futures that I'm very excited about, I would say the large view that I have on the future of Defi, is that we're going to move towards systems where there is, I think, more explicit layering and how things are constructed. Trade offs are made a bit more clear. Ultimately, we're moving towards things where there is, I would say, almost like lower level access to markets in the form of order books and similar tools. Because I think that if we want to get to the place where we are kind of offering a viable alternative to the traditional financial system, we're going to need to allow more of these power user tools to be available to larger players to come in, who are used to having that degree of fidelity with which they kind of price trades and interactions, and with which they manage their own risk. And so I think we will see that evolution over time, and hopefully we can start designing thoughtfully that way now. But I hope we never lose the wild experimentation that is possible here within the permissionless system. I think that as certain protocols, as certain use cases mature, those will become more hardened and will become safer, and that's where the majority of the value in the ecosystem will lie.
01:08:05.378 - 01:08:33.300, Speaker B: But then there will always be these places where I think there's a stronger distinction between what's core and what's more peripheral, and that at the periphery, we continue to see wild experimentation that leads to innovation, that ultimately matures and gets drawn into the core. Because I think that's how we move forward as an ecosystem and how we create something that we can all be really proud of. Kane, how does that fit with where you think we're going?
01:08:33.670 - 01:08:59.754, Speaker D: Broadly, I agree. Right. I think the permissionlessness and the low barriers to entry are like the ultimate aim of every technology, right. That's inherently what any ecosystem is trying to build. Right? To allow more experimentation. I think we're already seeing exactly what you describe in terms of older protocols, kind of finding some stability, et cetera. I still think it's early days.
01:08:59.754 - 01:09:20.654, Speaker D: We haven't even solved the l two dilemma of where are we going to go and bridging. I think each wave brings its own challenges. And as you kind of alluded to earlier now, in a bear market is the time to go and backfill some of those things. Right. Like in a bull market, it's like, throw everything out and just run as fast as you can.
01:09:20.692 - 01:09:20.846, Speaker B: Right.
01:09:20.868 - 01:09:28.322, Speaker D: And now it's like, all right, what have we dropped? Let's go back. Was any of it useful? And let's actually try and figure out the stuff that we need to fix.
01:09:28.376 - 01:09:28.690, Speaker A: Right.
01:09:28.760 - 01:10:12.926, Speaker D: So I very much think that backfilling some of the gaps and some of the tech debt and operational debt and all kinds of things are really important. I do think I've probably become a bit more cynical over the years, and I think that I've watched enough cycles now to see that the inflow of users at the top of the funnel can very rapidly be kind of siphoned off into a bad place. Right. And it doesn't take much, a small amount of friction when you have just millions of users pouring in at the top of the funnel can really end up with an outcome that we don't really want someone stealing billions of dollars from all of them. Right. That's an outcome I think we'd like to avoid next time around. Right.
01:10:12.926 - 01:11:05.086, Speaker D: So the thing that I guess I have been thinking about is this purist approach of building DeFi or whatever. I'm in a lucky position now where synthetics is fully decentralized. It doesn't require me, it doesn't require a hierarchy at all. It's doing that thing, right. And so what I've been looking about is looking at recently is, what can I do within the synthetics ecosystem to bridge the gap between, say, a centralized exchange, which obviously has all of its inherent risks, and this pure model of on chain trading and liquidity and permissionlessness, et cetera. And so I'm currently working on some thoughts around how do we bridge that gap in a way that has minimal trade offs, but can prevent all of these new people that will eventually turn up next year whenever they turn up.
01:11:05.108 - 01:11:05.390, Speaker A: Right.
01:11:05.460 - 01:11:08.154, Speaker D: Getting siphoned off into some kind of death camp.
01:11:08.212 - 01:11:09.858, Speaker B: The next FTX or whatever.
01:11:10.024 - 01:11:12.354, Speaker D: Yeah, exactly. The next FTX or whatever it is.
01:11:12.392 - 01:11:12.642, Speaker C: Right.
01:11:12.696 - 01:11:34.794, Speaker D: GTX or something like that. How do we stop that? Right. And so I think the key thing is friction is friction. And when you have a lot of users coming in who are new and uneducated and don't know how all these systems work, getting them to bridge to arbitrary, more optimism, and it's going to be hard. Right. I just think that's what we have last time. So that's where my focus has been.
01:11:34.794 - 01:12:00.098, Speaker D: So I think there's this pure pop, and I think that there's a lot of people working on that stuff. But I also think that one of the things we left behind that when I look back over the lost bull market is like, we were taking this purist approach, and other people were like, we don't care about this at all. We're just here to make money or scam people or whatever. And so they built a nice shiny interface and said, hey, you can come and sign up to this. It's super easy, and make it as easy as possible. And it worked.
01:12:00.184 - 01:12:00.482, Speaker B: Right?
01:12:00.536 - 01:12:02.260, Speaker D: And so I'm like, okay.
01:12:04.150 - 01:12:04.626, Speaker A: How do.
01:12:04.648 - 01:12:21.074, Speaker D: I compete with that nice, new, shiny interface next time to prevent that from happening or at least minimize it? Right. And is there a way that you can do that that makes it as easy as possible to onboard people? Because people just want to trade. That's the first, most useful. They just want to trade.
01:12:21.122 - 01:12:21.334, Speaker A: Right.
01:12:21.372 - 01:12:33.302, Speaker D: So when people turn up to trade, how do we have a nice shiny interface where the back end is all decentralized, but the front end is, the onboarding process is as easy as possible. And that's what I've been thinking about the last month or so.
01:12:33.456 - 01:13:08.306, Speaker B: I love it. I think that is such a huge need. I'm very interested in those, and I've seen a few teams kind of working towards versions of this. I think a lot of the folks are looking at kind of account abstraction, wallets and things that might enable more of these experiences. One of the things that I'm very focused on and that our team at nascent is very focused on is this security piece, because I think the worst case scenario is we get really good at the slick onboarding and we get more people in with more money, and then it all gets lost. And so we really need to make sure that we move those forward in parallel.
01:13:08.418 - 01:13:14.694, Speaker A: Agreed. So the future Defi could be summed as like, how do we get millions of people using this product in a very simple fashion?
01:13:14.742 - 01:13:15.050, Speaker C: Right.
01:13:15.120 - 01:13:40.034, Speaker D: Yeah. The back end needs to be this decentralized, permissionless thing. I think in the shorter term, absent, there's still a whole bunch of challenges, technical challenges, that are unsolved. Right. And I think you can kind of paper over them a little bit with some trade offs if you're willing to actually make those trade offs. And so I'm kind of putting my hand up to say maybe I'm willing to make those trade offs and just see what happens.
01:13:40.232 - 01:14:28.002, Speaker A: Interesting for Defi founders, right? Obviously, we see a ton of applications that come in for accelerator program, but we're not seeing many for DeFi anymore. And it just brings up an interesting element, because the first year when we launched our accelerator program, we've seen hundreds, thousands of startups building the Defi space. But now all we're seeing is maybe a twist of a lending product or a twist on a derivative product. And so just diving deeper into Chow's question, which is, where are we with Defi from a product perspective, is a lot of the innovation done already? And now we're building iterative products that touch the end user, or is there more to build in this space that we haven't uncovered yet?
01:14:28.136 - 01:14:51.986, Speaker D: I mean, finance is not that, you know, banks figured stuff out a while ago, right? I think the challenge in DeFi is not what you do, but how you do it. And so there's still a lot of innovation. Everything Dave's been talking about is like, how you do it. It's not saying, like, let's build something. It's like, no, let's just build a fucking lending protocol, but let's just do it in a better way.
01:14:52.028 - 01:14:52.186, Speaker B: Right?
01:14:52.208 - 01:15:34.742, Speaker D: Like, the how you do it is still an unsolved problem. So I think that what I would say is it's challenging to turn up as a startup founder and say, hey, guess what? I'm going to compete with compound or Aave or whatever, or I'm going to compete with uniswap. That's a pretty hubristic approach to life, right? No, I've got this. I know what's happening here, but I think the opportunity is that we are still developing technology every single day, every single week, that if you had known that this was going to exist when you were building Ave, you would build aave differently. But Aave can't do that. Aave is part dependency, right? Like, Ave is over here. They can't just be like, oh, sorry.
01:15:34.742 - 01:16:26.806, Speaker D: Actually, it turns out that this thing invented last week is way better, and let's just shut the whole thing down. The innovator's dilemma, right? And so a startup founder who's like, wait a second, if I take these three components and I combine them together, I can build a lending protocol that is much more efficient, safer, more secure, et cetera. Yes, there's going to be fairly in a bear market, it's going to be hard to convince. It's not going to be the easiest thing to convince investors to be like, let's take on Ave, right? But if you're scrappy and small and a team of like three or four people, maybe you only need to raise a couple hundred grand, and there's a couple of hundred grand out there for that thing for sure. So go out and raise a couple of hundred grand, bootstrap it, like actually develop the thing, prove that those technologies do actually combine together to create something that is more efficient and safer on some dimension, better than are they, and then that's when you can really scale it up.
01:16:26.828 - 01:16:26.966, Speaker B: Right.
01:16:26.988 - 01:16:34.474, Speaker D: But that early stage thing, like go to an accelerator, get the help to go and do that, makes sense to me. It's the how I think, not the what.
01:16:34.592 - 01:17:26.214, Speaker B: I strongly agree with that. And I think, yes, there's just less investments generally happening in a bear market, but also the gap between zero and where Ave is today is less than if you started the peak of the bull market. Right. And so I think the opportunity is there for new founders to come in and disrupt some of the incumbent players. And I think there's a couple of things that I would point to as maybe not complete table flip moments, but close to it. And one of those is the kind of emergence of l two s and specifically application specific roll ups and application specific chains and how that really changes the design space. And then the other is a lot of the kind of ZK technology that's coming along, which just both of those things point to inherently different architectures.
01:17:26.214 - 01:18:17.446, Speaker B: And so I believe both are going to play big roles in the future of crypto. And to be honest, we haven't invested nascent that deeply in tons of l two s or tons of ZK things. But I think they're very important kind of foundational technologies and things that are emerging. And so if you are not building today with those in mind and the future state of the ecosystem and what those technologies will enable, then it's going to be really hard to make headway. So you have to look at these things that are, again, like, if you look at the dawn of the iPhone, if you're still thinking about, how do I create a better website on desktop? And not like, oh, what are we going to do for mobile native apps, right. You have to look at where the kind of arc of technology is headed and build in that direction.
01:18:17.558 - 01:18:46.846, Speaker D: And in the crypto ecosystem, it's not like web two or whatever, or even the launch of mobile where it was like once a year Apple would come up with an update that would change the landscape, whatever. This is like every 20 minutes there's someone inventing some new thing, right? So if you stay close to that, the new enabling technology and disruption that's happening, this froth of craziness. You have a huge advantage over incumbents.
01:18:46.958 - 01:19:28.974, Speaker A: Final question for founders that are building the space. Dan and Kane, and I'm going to touch on both of your articles here. How should they be thinking about the attack surfaces that you mentioned with oracles or governance or even contract upgradability? When should they think about governance as they're building out their product? Should they not introduce it? Maybe just some tips and points on kind of your thoughts around security. Because security is obviously a very big part of crypto adoption, because if a user gets hacked, they'll never come back. You lose that customer forever. And so thinking about this, how do we frame this in a way where give founders an easy step into thinking about this from a framework perspective?
01:19:29.102 - 01:20:13.790, Speaker B: I mean, there's a lot there, there's like an easy framework perspective on any of this. I think there's a lot of different things. I think that's why accelerator programs like alliance can be so helpful, is because you get so many experts around so many different things that it's impossible for one person to have all the knowledge, even those of us who've been in the industry for years, we aren't experts in everything. And there are friends and colleagues that I turn to who are smarter on certain topics. But I would say, generally speaking, take security seriously from day one. And that isn't just like, oh, I'm going to get audited before we deploy live. Actually think about having security baked into your development process.
01:20:13.790 - 01:20:19.730, Speaker B: And how are you writing your code? How are you reviewing your code? What are the checkpoints along the way?
01:20:19.800 - 01:20:22.034, Speaker A: And Nathan has launched a bunch of.
01:20:22.232 - 01:20:54.682, Speaker B: Yeah, we put out something called the simple security toolkit, fully open source. It's like literally a collection of checklists and templates and security best practices, not blog posts like literal checklists. If you haven't checked all these boxes, you're not ready for an audit. If you haven't checked all these boxes, you're not ready to deploy and get real money in your protocol. And we tried to make it very simple, very easy to understand. We're going to be having a minor update to it soon with a few things that have changed over the last twelve months since we initially launched it. But be thinking about those things from day one.
01:20:54.682 - 01:21:26.950, Speaker B: I think Ken Dieter from Electric Capital wrote a post years ago that I thought laid out a really smart thing, which was looking at what he think he called a guarded launch, which is to say basically progressively allow more controls to be handed off, allow more assets to be deposited in, but make it so that the early days of deploying a contract, I still say on main net, even though often it's an l two, those are super risky times. And make sure that you slowly develop your Lindy and nobody wants the Thanksgiving Turkey chart.
01:21:27.530 - 01:22:32.038, Speaker D: I agree with all of that stuff. I think I would also just add, take the opportunity now in the environment that we're in the market that we're in to be slower. Right? It's really hard to be slow when everyone's running around with their hair on fire in a bull market, you have the luxury now of just doing things in a more methodical fashion, which doesn't necessarily mean that everything will be fine, but it means that you can take the time to go and read something like this toolkit, right, where it's like you probably would be like, oh, no, I need to get out there and get users, my competitors doing this or whatever. So I just think, slow down, chill out, take things in a methodical way. And you have the luxury of doing that now, you probably won't in the future. So appreciate it and build that into your mindset so that when in the future things are moving faster, you have kind of built up habits and internal cultural habits about how you do things that will hold you in good stead in the future and that will kind of keep you safe.
01:22:32.134 - 01:22:40.430, Speaker A: Kane Dan, thank you so much for your time. And if founders want to reach out or learn more about you guys, how can they reach out?
01:22:40.500 - 01:22:41.918, Speaker D: Twitter for me is probably the best.
01:22:42.004 - 01:22:42.266, Speaker A: Twitter.
01:22:42.298 - 01:22:49.442, Speaker B: Yeah, Twitter. Twitter is the same for me as well at dialitzer on Twitter and at nascent xyz as well.
01:22:49.576 - 01:23:26.362, Speaker A: Awesome. Thanks so much, guys. That was a great conversation. A lot to unpack there. But maybe we could start off with the high level, which is Dan Elitzer stated that he isn't against. I mean, obviously when he said Defi was broken, it was more of like a headline like, hey, read my article. But if you look into the article and then obviously if you unpack the conversation, there's just a lot to uncover in regards to how he thinks about Oracles smart contract upgradability and then more or less governance.
01:23:26.362 - 01:23:57.734, Speaker A: On the Oracle side, he brought up the layered approach, which is know, you could bring your own oracles into the different apps that are being built on top of these primitives, and you could still have these live feed oracles, but the security of it should be primarily focused on the attack vector, should be primarily focused on the app itself versus the primitive. So I'm curious to hear your thoughts about that. And I know, you had a lot of questions around the Oracle attacks itself. And did it help answer your question that you brought up in our intro earlier today?
01:23:57.852 - 01:24:12.750, Speaker C: Yes and no. I would say the discussion with Dan really reminded me of this very hot topic, very hot discussion we used to have during DeFi summer, which is the AMM versus clobs.
01:24:14.530 - 01:24:15.502, Speaker A: They're fun.
01:24:15.636 - 01:25:17.390, Speaker C: It's still really relevant today because Dan said something very interesting, which is that he wants DeFi to move into a world where there's less parameterization and more market forces. For me, that's exactly the AMM versus clubs debate because amms are fundamentally highly parameterized, whereas clubs are driven by a large number of independent market participants. So I actually thought that Dan was unbalanced in favor of clops versus amms. I'm obviously taking a higher level of abstraction from the AMM versus cop discussion. It's a broader point than that. But underneath that level of abstraction, there's amm versus klops. But there's also blend versus aave, for example, an oracle less lending platform versus a lending platform that relies on oracles.
01:25:17.390 - 01:25:41.370, Speaker C: The one that does not rely on oracles basically replaces the dependency on oracles by dependency on a broader number of market participants. To me, it's the same exact idea between blend and klopps. So Klopps is to oracle less lending what amms is to lending platforms with oracles, if that makes sense.
01:25:41.520 - 01:25:55.246, Speaker A: Yeah, it does. And it's not to say that both designs are wrong or right. I think both can coexist. It will ultimately depend on the types of products that are being created and the areas that it's going to serve. Right.
01:25:55.348 - 01:26:33.894, Speaker C: I still think there's nothing wrong with Ave compound, which I don't either on Oracle because they explicitly pick the super liquid assets as collaterals. So when you have a very liquid asset, those assets are hard to manipulate and therefore the oracles should be fine to me. Right. But if you want to build a lending platform where the collateral is the long tail of illiquid assets, for example nfts, or a very illiquid fungible token, if you want to use those assets as collateral, then you probably don't want to rely on an oracle and you need a design that is oracle esque.
01:26:34.022 - 01:26:37.274, Speaker A: It's something that's custom for the user. Yeah.
01:26:37.392 - 01:26:41.740, Speaker C: So both types of design can work and it really depends on the use.
01:26:43.550 - 01:26:43.830, Speaker B: Mean.
01:26:43.840 - 01:27:12.322, Speaker A: I agree with that. Right. I do think without these RFQ based systems, RFQ based lending products like blend, it's really hard for us to get collateral on the long tail assets of NFTs, or even just NFTs in general. It's just too fragmented. If you look at how many communities there are within NFTs, there are over 10,000 communities. And being able to build a structured lending product is just going to be very hard. You primarily just want to focus on the blue chips.
01:27:12.322 - 01:27:37.198, Speaker A: But the funny thing about the blue chips is that they change over. Like, the narratives move so quickly within the NFT communities that it's just very hard to pinpoint what are the blue chip communities? I mean, if you talk about a year ago, we were talking board apes, now it's me, ladies. Right. And so I do think that a product like this serves a certain niche area, and I think that's fine.
01:27:37.364 - 01:27:39.710, Speaker C: What did you say that the current blue chip is?
01:27:39.780 - 01:27:40.714, Speaker A: Meladys.
01:27:40.842 - 01:27:42.826, Speaker C: Oh, meladys. Okay, meladys.
01:27:42.858 - 01:27:44.000, Speaker A: Meladys, whatever.
01:27:44.850 - 01:27:46.462, Speaker C: And Azukis and stuff.
01:27:46.516 - 01:27:49.794, Speaker A: And Azukis. I mean, Azuki was even part of the conversation last year.
01:27:49.832 - 01:27:50.082, Speaker C: Right?
01:27:50.136 - 01:27:58.902, Speaker A: So Azukis are becoming a part of the blue chip category, and board apes, to be quite frank, is becoming a little bit of a weird community to be part.
01:27:59.036 - 01:28:17.638, Speaker C: Yeah, because the narratives change all the time. The liquidity will change over time, and the quality of the collateral will change over time. So even if the collateral worked in the early days, in a system that relies on oracles, at some point it might not be a collateral anymore.
01:28:17.734 - 01:28:24.970, Speaker A: Yeah. So I do think this is great for NFTs and then long tail assets of fungible tokens.
01:28:25.050 - 01:28:33.170, Speaker C: I didn't quite get the problem with governance and contract upgradability. Exactly. I don't know what you got out of it.
01:28:33.240 - 01:28:55.570, Speaker A: I think governance is still up in the air because. And we talked to Kane about this, which is, if you look at perp, v one, right, he left. He left the synthetics community. He's like, okay, you guys take over. I'm done. And it turns out the product kind of went downhill. He came back, and then v two was launched.
01:28:55.570 - 01:29:35.970, Speaker A: He brought the community back, and he was able to kind of put them on the straight path. And now if you look at v two, they're killing it. They're like the number one derivatives platform outside of Dydx. Right. And so what he mentioned on this was that you need to have some sort of leader, a benevolent leader, but you leave the decisions to the governance. And so he brought up this really good example in his article, even in the conversation was he had a long standing relationship with Chainlink, and he wanted to go with Chainlink as the hybrid push pull oracle that they were going to implement to prevent front running. And Chainlink didn't have the product, but he really wanted to go with them because he worked with them for four years.
01:29:35.970 - 01:30:08.478, Speaker A: But the community wanted to launch a product like tomorrow. And the only product that was available was pith. So the Dow ended up voting for pith and against Chainlink, which fractured Chainlink and Cain's relationship. But that brought in $10 million in staking revenue for the holders. Right. And now they're like the number one platform. So what he said was like, although I am biased with this relationship, dows could be a very good decision making tool because it doesn't have as much bias as I do as an individual.
01:30:08.478 - 01:30:10.462, Speaker A: So he did talk about that.
01:30:10.596 - 01:30:21.678, Speaker C: And Dan seems to be on the other end of this. He seems to think that a very strong leader, aka the CEO, should be able to make better decisions than the Dow.
01:30:21.774 - 01:30:41.594, Speaker A: Yeah, he was more in that camp, but he also was open to governance, but it was more on the lighter side. And so I think where we are in the spectrum is the fact that I think products will be dependent highly on the type of governance. It should be modularized, I think dependent on the product that you're building.
01:30:41.712 - 01:31:05.954, Speaker C: It reminds me of Ethereum a little bit as well. You have Vitalik, which writes a super technical blog post on the roadmap, Ethereum once in a while. But I don't know if he actually dictates on any of the roadmap he writes about. I don't actually know how decisions are made in the Ethereum foundation. There's no visibility for me, at least. Probably have to join their core developer call or something.
01:31:06.072 - 01:31:42.240, Speaker A: There's a really good researcher at Galaxy Digital. She writes up a weekly or every time there's an Ethereum dev meetup or call, she writes a very good summary on it. So for those that are listening, you should definitely check out Christine's article at Galaxy. But yeah, I think Vitalik has this power effect, which is like, you write the article and people will automatically start to implement. This happened with Vitalik's. I've seen this most recently, which was Vitalik wrote about account abstraction. I kid you not, there was probably like 20 to 30 startups that were built within that week.
01:31:43.570 - 01:31:59.586, Speaker C: There's account abstraction and there is roll ups. No, the soul bound token. Oh my God. SDG within that week. Oh my God. I saw 20 applications and the ideas made zero sense, by the way. It was entirely just.
01:31:59.768 - 01:32:29.446, Speaker A: But so it's like there's this effect that he has, which is like people read it and then people go and self execute. And maybe that's the power of Ethereum, right? Which is if you look at, even if you compare it to Cosmos and Ethereum, the reason why Ethereum moves so fast compared to Cosmos is the fact that they have these people that read Vitalik's article and they start to build out the functionality of Ethereum that needs it. Like roll ups. Roll ups as a service, wallets.
01:32:29.558 - 01:32:38.446, Speaker C: And funny you say that, because the reason why Solana moves faster than Ethereum, because Anatoly doesn't write articles, he actually writes code.
01:32:38.548 - 01:32:39.534, Speaker D: He writes code.
01:32:39.652 - 01:32:40.640, Speaker B: That's Right.
01:32:42.050 - 01:33:16.138, Speaker A: That's actually very, you know, ethereum relies on the power of its community. And I think anatoly, it's really him that's writing this functionality and obviously, and tend to move faster, right? Like if you think about NFT compressions, right, or compression versus what's happening within the Ethereum space where you have like validiums and L2s and all this infrastructure that's built by startups. Solana built this in house, right? More or less. So it's interesting to see that.
01:33:16.224 - 01:33:20.870, Speaker C: Any other takeaways? What did you think of their vision for the future of DFI?
01:33:20.950 - 01:34:18.174, Speaker A: Okay, so what I got out of the way they answered was like, we're in the wait and see moment, right? Like, I think there's a lot of stuff coming, but what we need to get right is commercializing the products that we already have and making it better so we can get more and more people using the product. We don't have enough users, and the products that we do have only fulfill a very small niche. So I think what I got out of that was like, let's not build derivatives of the product or twists of the same product. It's like making these products even more usable to the everyday user. And that was like the high level conversation. And then the next tier conversation was Kane wants to make synthetics, quenta and all of its other products that are being built on top of the synthetics liquidity protocol, more usable with account abstraction. There's this conversation around intent networks, which we'll talk about within our research podcast in a bit.
01:34:18.174 - 01:34:30.530, Speaker A: But pretty much, if you want to summarize, is making these products easy to use for everyday people. And I think that opens up the floodgate for more users within DFI, because that's the problem that we see today.
01:34:30.680 - 01:35:12.678, Speaker C: So expanding beyond the crypto native users, which I don't know, there are maybe 10 million people that order of magnitude that have a metamask installed beyond DeFI. Yeah, I'm not talking about the active users. I'm talking about the number of people who have installed a metamask and are ready to use DeFi. Because one of the biggest frictions associated with using DeFi is that you have to install a browser extension and learn the user experience. And it seems like Kane wants to expand beyond that group of users and serve the ones that don't have a metamask don't know how to use a metamask.
01:35:12.794 - 01:35:39.834, Speaker A: That's exactly right. And it's also interesting to see the synthetics journey, right, from v one, where he had issues with oracles, he had issues with governance, he had issues with the product itself. And when he came back, he fixed all of these issues. Right. And now Quenta is killing it. Right. And all the other products that are building within the synthetics ecosystem, they're all doing really pretty well.
01:35:39.834 - 01:36:35.414, Speaker A: And so it's very obvious when you have product market fit, the next area of growth is growth, customer growth, customer acquisition strategies. And I think what's holding crypto and Defi back generally, is the fact that we don't have enough customers and users that's using the products today. And so it's actually refreshing to hear this because everyone's talking about roll ups and zero knowledge proofs and highly technical conversations that the everyday person doesn't understand and they don't need to understand. But what we should be doing is talking about how do we get more people using crypto today? And so that's kind of the area of focus that he spent a lot of time on talking about. What were your thoughts around the latency of oracles? I know we dug a bit deeper around the front running of oracles, the push versus pull oracles. What were your thoughts around that conversation?
01:36:35.542 - 01:36:52.218, Speaker C: I'm not an expert, but based on the mechanism he described, basically he's saying synthetics now uses a pull oracle, meaning the user needs to pull the data and prove that he pulled the data before making a trade, if I understand that correctly.
01:36:52.314 - 01:36:59.538, Speaker A: Yeah, it's like a hybrid of push and pull, and they add some fractional sku premium on top as well.
01:36:59.624 - 01:37:55.122, Speaker C: But even a pure pull mechanism, I'm not really sure if you can completely avoid front running. I have to think deeply, I have to do some research and think deeply. But the problem is when you use crypto, you are relying on a decentralized network of price feed providers, and then you have a counterparty, like someone who trades alongside you or trades against you that uses a centralized feed so that person could be jump, which uses really expensive and really fast. By fast, I mean literally close to the speed of light type of infrastructure to get the price feed physically, it's not possible for a decentralized network of price feed to be faster than the centralized feed that jump uses. So my hunch is you can never completely avoid the front rounding problem. Yeah.
01:37:55.176 - 01:38:18.570, Speaker A: If you're going to rely on external feeds 100%. But there's an argument that Dan made, if you remember, which is the goal, is for the reason why we rely on external data feeds right now, is the fact that that's where the source is. Right? I mean, that's where the majority of markets are. But what about in a post crypto world where the markets are primarily in crypto? Right.
01:38:18.640 - 01:38:49.942, Speaker C: Yeah, so I actually thought about that. The example they gave was gold. I didn't mention it during the call, but I don't think if you want to trade a gold derivatives, you will always need an oracle. You cannot avoid it, because gold is this physical thing that lives off chain. You cannot avoid it. If you want to build a derivative on top of gold, you need the price of gold for settlement. So if you're a derivative that is cash settled, then you need a price oracle for gold that is off chain, you cannot avoid it.
01:38:49.942 - 01:39:20.990, Speaker C: If you build a derivative that's physically settled, then you somehow need a facility that. You need an entity that facilitates the settlement of gold at the expiry of the derivative. Right. So person a needs to actually transfer physical gold to person b at the expiry. And that automatically makes this not a protocol because you need a centralized entity to facilitate this. So that specific example with gold, I don't think what they said will work because of gold itself.
01:39:21.140 - 01:39:28.846, Speaker A: However, just for our audience, because most of gold that's being traded is physically settled, is what you're saying, whether it's.
01:39:28.878 - 01:39:32.706, Speaker C: Physically settled or cash settled, it doesn't work for reasons I described or.
01:39:32.728 - 01:39:45.062, Speaker A: Sorry, physically or cash settled, you know what I mean? Yeah, but the majority of the trading is happening outside of the crypto space. And because that is happening outside the crypto space, they determine the price.
01:39:45.196 - 01:40:30.854, Speaker C: Even if the majority of trading happens on crypto, on this decentralized gold futures, even if more volume happens in this instrument versus physical gold, which is option, you still need either a price oracle or an entity to facilitate the physical settlement. That's not avoidable in this particular example. However, the example that could work is if you want to build a derivative on a crypto native asset. So a perpetual swap on bitcoin or on ethereum? That could work, because all you need to do is to pull the price feed from onchain itself. You don't need to rely on an off chain oracle for that.
01:40:30.892 - 01:40:37.822, Speaker A: Yeah. So you're bullish on chain all on chain assets. You're more bearish on off chain price feeds.
01:40:37.906 - 01:40:44.998, Speaker C: Typically, I'm bullish on our ability to avoid oracles if the instrument is a crypto native instrument.
01:40:45.094 - 01:40:45.690, Speaker A: Got it.
01:40:45.760 - 01:40:46.954, Speaker C: Which gold is not.
01:40:47.072 - 01:41:17.350, Speaker A: Yeah, agreed. I think that's a good way to contextualize it. Yeah, I think this was a great conversation. Both Kane and Dan, both ogs in the space. Always good to get context around these types of narratives that come up and for founders that are building in defi to think about how they should be either constructing their governance, thinking about oracles and the narratives that come around. You know, better be informed so that you guys are successful. So thanks for tuning in.
