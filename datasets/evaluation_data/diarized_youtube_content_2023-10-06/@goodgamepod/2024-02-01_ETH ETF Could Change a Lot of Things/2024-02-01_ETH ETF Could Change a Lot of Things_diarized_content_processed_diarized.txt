00:00:00.160 - 00:00:54.594, Speaker A: I think Ethereum ETF, if approved, could change a lot of things. So without the ETF, I think that Ethereum in the coming years will be endlessly compared to Solana, because people will put in the same category as Solana as a smart contract platform, and they'll be competing on fees, on latency, on throughput, on security, on liquidity, some of which Ethereum is winning, others Ethereum is behind. But if the Ethereum ETF is approved in May, I think people will start putting Ethereum in the same category as BTC, meaning the category of an institutional ready asset class. For now. For now, these narratives. But the narratives change how people value the asset, because without the ETF, if Ethereum is in the same category as Solana, the market will compete against Solana. If Ethereum is in the same category as BTC, the market will compit as against BTC.
