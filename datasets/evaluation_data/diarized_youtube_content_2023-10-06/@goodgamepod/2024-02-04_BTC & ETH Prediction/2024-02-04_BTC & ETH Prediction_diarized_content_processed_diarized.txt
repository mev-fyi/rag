00:00:00.200 - 00:00:04.070, Speaker A: Where do you think bitcoin Ethereum will be trading at more or less end of this year?
00:00:04.182 - 00:00:17.742, Speaker B: Higher end of the year. Of course, the range is huge. We could be at 30 at the end of the year, or 150 at the end of the year. Huge distribution there. But on average I would say higher. Slightly higher. It's a super cycle.
00:00:17.742 - 00:00:40.804, Speaker B: I think people are still stuck in the four year cycle mindset. I think the sooner you get out of that mindset, the better. My base case is that we actually have been in a super cycle, and the only reason why the chart doesn't show that is because we had a very unlucky confluence of two events in 2021. One is the Jerome great hike, and the other one is all the fraud, the terra, the FTX kind of things.
