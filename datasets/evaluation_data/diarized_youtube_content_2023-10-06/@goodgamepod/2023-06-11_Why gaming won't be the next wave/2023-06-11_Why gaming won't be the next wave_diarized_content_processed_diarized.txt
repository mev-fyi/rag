00:00:00.160 - 00:00:43.628, Speaker A: For the longest time, people think that the third wave or the next wave will be brought by gaming and social networks. It sounds pretty straightforward, it sounds pretty intuitive, and I don't necessarily disagree with that thesis, but I want to play Devil's advocate on why gaming and social networks are not the next wave. Let's start with gaming. Okay. So today there's hundreds of AAA game studios that are building crypto games. Many of them come from traditional gaming background or game development background that just got into crypto not long ago. And what a lot of them do is they start as a AAA double A game, and then they put some of their in game assets on chain in the form of nfts.
00:00:43.628 - 00:00:56.764, Speaker A: That could work, but to me, it feels like it's not very interesting. Right? Yeah, 100%. The thing about gaming that's the hardest to replicate is the cult status. How long do these games last and how long will they be in the minds of people?
