00:00:00.160 - 00:00:35.776, Speaker A: Sequoia. I mean, they pretty much started the venture capital business, and they wrote this, like, article that talked about effective altruism and why Sam is the next Elon Musk. And quite surprisingly, I'm surprised that they didn't catch this. And it tells you a lot about our venture industry generally, which is that a lot of it is just social signaling, and it's just a bet on the founder of what they see on Twitter and the product and etcetera. And I feel like that needs to change because it's primarily driven around that. It's never driven around, like, let's sit down and figure out X, Y, and Z. Like, a lot of the work that we do within the alliance is making sure that there's product market fit.
00:00:35.776 - 00:00:53.744, Speaker A: There's validation for the founders. They find the first 100, 200 customers, and so we see the users. But if you go on, like, out in just the industry generally, like, primarily, it's just like, okay, what are you pitching? Okay, we'll invest fine. But I think there needs to be more work around diligence and, like, working with the founders and understanding what they're building, who they are.
