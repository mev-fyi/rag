00:00:00.400 - 00:00:04.085, Speaker A: Welcome to GoodGame. Your no BS insights for crypto founders.
00:00:08.185 - 00:00:25.735, Speaker B: My main argument is we can go up on good news. We went up a little bit too fast earlier this year, so we're now taking a break. And at the same time, there's no reason to believe that the cycle is over. We'll probably go up. We'll probably be higher at the end of the year than today.
00:00:25.865 - 00:00:30.611, Speaker A: I'd agree with that. I do think though, that this chop is going to be brutal. It's going to be brutal.
00:00:30.763 - 00:00:41.611, Speaker B: The slower, the longer it takes, the more brutal it is and the more you should delete Twitter. It's going to be like. Over the last few weeks, crypto Twitter was insufferable.
00:00:41.723 - 00:00:47.475, Speaker A: It was horrible. I mean, there were certain days where I just wouldn't even log on. Like, it was. It was really bad. It was really negative.
00:00:47.595 - 00:00:56.041, Speaker B: You know, I wouldn't have logged on at all except for the fact that all my fantasy bag holders are are shitting on me for not tweeting.
00:00:56.153 - 00:01:09.417, Speaker A: What's new? I get shitted on by them. But I try to perform. I try to be a good player. It's bad when I get your players texting me and DMing me, people telling.
00:01:09.441 - 00:01:11.401, Speaker B: You to tell me to tweet more.
00:01:11.593 - 00:01:15.801, Speaker A: Hey man, tell Chow to tweet. Looking for your next startup idea in crypto?
00:01:15.913 - 00:01:17.497, Speaker B: Check out our request for startups list.
00:01:17.521 - 00:01:42.387, Speaker A: And get inspired at Alliance XYZ or forward slash ideas. It's been what, like two weeks now since we last caught up. Yeah, I think it's good to discuss where we are in the market. I think we just hit 59k couple weeks ago. We thought at least the market thought up only future of France. Donald was wrong. Yeah.
00:01:42.387 - 00:01:56.245, Speaker A: And now we're here. So election is about three months away and I guess the market wants to know where we're going next. To me it seems like the consensus trade is that we're going to go to 50k.
00:01:57.025 - 00:02:02.245, Speaker B: By consensus trade you mean Donald predictions Donald Ansem.
00:02:02.585 - 00:02:03.417, Speaker A: I don't know.
00:02:03.521 - 00:02:16.495, Speaker B: I think Ansum is more bullish. Right? I think Ansem is more bullish. Ansem is a little bit bullish. Ansem is like we bounce at high 50s, but Donald is more like low 50s, if not 40s.
00:02:16.655 - 00:02:32.687, Speaker A: Yeah. Zoran at one point said 44K. Who else? There are a bunch of other traders that are calling for like 50. Oh, Andrew. Andrew King. He called for between 40s and 50s. When? Andrew King.
00:02:32.791 - 00:02:33.343, Speaker B: When?
00:02:33.479 - 00:02:34.207, Speaker A: Yesterday.
00:02:34.351 - 00:02:34.967, Speaker B: Really?
00:02:35.111 - 00:02:37.195, Speaker A: Yeah, yesterday or two days ago.
00:02:38.145 - 00:02:43.001, Speaker B: I did see his I did see his analysis of Ethereum ETF that was interesting.
00:02:43.033 - 00:02:46.329, Speaker A: Did you read it? I didn't get a chance to read it. Did you read it?
00:02:46.497 - 00:03:37.977, Speaker B: I read it. So it was, yeah, go ahead. I'll get to the conclusion first and then talk about the analysis, the reasoning. The conclusion is the ETH ETF will, or his conclusion is that the ETH ETF will underperform the expectations. And the reasoning is there's a lot of reasonings, a lot of assumptions about numbers and stuff and like that, but the reasoning is that it's more or less pressed in. And for example, you can see that in the OI of the ETH futures it went up a lot. Meaning basically people are front running the ETF flow and that is in contrast to the BTC ETF back then the OI actually dropped right before the etf, so people were actually taking profit.
00:03:37.977 - 00:04:08.029, Speaker B: People were expecting sell the news at that time, so they sold and then they got punished by the market. So this was one of their reasonings. But he has like three or four lines of reasonings that are similar that led to this conclusion of the ETH ETF potentially underperforming. Personally, I think the analysis is interesting. I don't know if I agree with it because I think there's way too many assumptions going into that analysis. I just don't know. I don't know if the ETF will outperform or underperform.
00:04:08.029 - 00:04:39.581, Speaker B: But if you ask me to compare the ETF flow to the BTC ETF flow and ask me which one would be bigger as a percentage of the market cap, you want to normalize the two, right? So if you ask me which of the two ETFs would have a bigger impact to the price, I would have said the BTC etf. And the reason for that is every tradfi person that I know, the mindshare among the tradfi folks is way bigger for BTC than for eth.
00:04:39.693 - 00:04:42.869, Speaker A: The narrative is just so much easier to comprehend for people. Right?
00:04:42.957 - 00:05:34.839, Speaker B: The narrative is a lot easier. The narrative is just digital gold, whereas Ethereum is a tech play for a lot of the traffic folks. But tech play is a very abstract term. Like what kind of tech play is it, right? Is it a yield play? Is it a, you know, because Ethereum has some yield, right? Or is it a tech platform where people can build permissionless applications on top? Like there's a lot of potential narratives that are complicated for TRAFI to understand. But my point is the mind share for BTC is A lot bigger than for ETH among that group of users, that group of buyers basically the tratify folks who don't already have access to crypto through Coinbase and others. If they wanted to access crypto they would have to buy the etf. So for those people I think BTC mindshare is a lot bigger.
00:05:34.839 - 00:05:46.151, Speaker B: But it's a weak opinion. For me it's a weak opinion. My opinion on this is not strong enough for me to place a trade. Just gone to my head. I would say ETH ETF probably underperformed the BTC etf.
00:05:46.263 - 00:05:57.015, Speaker A: There was also conversation about investors that are buying ETH ETF are they may not really understand the dynamics because there's yield that could be earned by just buying it natively versus using an etf.
00:05:57.095 - 00:06:23.069, Speaker B: Right. Yeah. So this was also one of the reasonings that I can't remember was Andrew Kang or I think it might have been Ansem. Ansem said it, he pointed out that the ETH ETF doesn't have the native yield. You can't stake the ETF in the ETF and so the group of people who see ETH as a yield generating tag play will be less likely to buy the ETF as a result.
00:06:23.197 - 00:06:26.077, Speaker A: That's right. Now can we steal man that argument?
00:06:26.181 - 00:06:30.705, Speaker B: I mean so on balance I don't think, obviously I don't think the ETH ETF is bearish.
00:06:31.005 - 00:06:31.785, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:06:32.565 - 00:06:36.197, Speaker B: I just think the impact is probably less than the BTC etf.
00:06:36.301 - 00:07:01.887, Speaker A: I don't know, maybe I'm feeling like the market is over indexing on the bearishness. I think this is really obviously very positive and we haven't yet seen the market participants that are actually going to buy the ettf. You know, for anyone to buy it on the balance sheet of a large company or investment, investment management arm, it's gonna be very hard for them to actually acquire ETH natively and it's better off that they buy it through like a structured product, like it like an etf.
00:07:01.991 - 00:07:02.623, Speaker B: Yep.
00:07:02.759 - 00:07:10.207, Speaker A: So I do think there is a market for it. I don't. Yeah. Based on what you're saying. Yeah. I generally agree that I don't know how big that buying opportunity for them.
00:07:10.271 - 00:07:56.397, Speaker B: Back to the earlier topic where we are in the broader market. So there's one thing that I didn't really like over the last few weeks or even a couple of months is that we had a lot of good news and the market couldn't go up. That was the thing that tells me, man, this thing like we're probably taking a break. And some of the news were, for example, well, the ETH ETF approval, that was a good news. The SEC withdrawing their investigation into ethics, consensus and consensus, all that stuff, that was the good news. Trump shilling crypto in every single one of his speeches, that is really bullish. For the entire crypto asset class and industry, that was bullish.
00:07:56.397 - 00:08:42.865, Speaker B: And Trump currently, according to the prediction market odds, not just the crypto native ones, not just like Polymarket, but also the traditional web two betting websites, Trump is now around 55%, somewhere between 50 and 60, whereas Biden is in the mid 30s to low 40s. And so Trump is fairly ahead of Biden in the race. And the fact that he's bullish, crypto should be bullish for the market. And yet the market is not going up. So whenever any market, not just crypto, whenever any market couldn't go up on good news, it tends to be bearish and vice versa. Right. Whenever the market cannot go down on bad news, it's really, really bullish.
00:08:42.865 - 00:09:06.413, Speaker B: For example, two years ago when the whole thing like ftx, all that stuff happened, there was a period of a lot of FUD following the collapse of ftx, including FUD around Binance. But all these news couldn't bring the market down and that was extremely bullish. That was BTC below 20,000. And today we're seeing sort of the opposite of that, which is a lot of good news. And the market couldn't go up.
00:09:06.509 - 00:09:33.059, Speaker A: Do you think this is a byproduct of the upcoming Mt. Gox? Obviously, Mt. Gox today announced that they're going to start distributing. Was it 80,000, 144,000 Bitcoin? I believe it was. And so Galaxy wrote a huge report on it, which I'll share in a bit. But do you think this news had something to do with it over the past few weeks? Because that's what some people are speculating.
00:09:33.227 - 00:09:45.635, Speaker B: It would probably spook the derivative traders, the perp traders, not just. Also, funny enough, this morning a friend of mine asked me if I was going to sell my. Because you know, I have Mongox.
00:09:45.715 - 00:09:46.147, Speaker A: Yes.
00:09:46.251 - 00:10:03.147, Speaker B: And he asked me if I was going to sell the Mongox Bitcoin. That's when I discovered, oh, actually Mongox is going to offload a bunch of the btc. But that's like short term, bearish. But the other thing is that Germany, the government of Germany.
00:10:03.251 - 00:10:05.335, Speaker A: Right, yeah. They have 4 billion, 3 billion.
00:10:06.595 - 00:10:20.123, Speaker B: And that also spooked some of the traders. But anyway, I Think these two are more short term. I think the main thing that worries me is that the good news cannot push the market up. That's generally a bad sign for me.
00:10:20.259 - 00:10:27.019, Speaker A: I feel as if we're running out of good news. I don't know what other catalysts there are outside of the ettf maybe.
00:10:27.147 - 00:10:31.787, Speaker B: I mean, there's. There's two more until the end of the year. One is the rate cuts.
00:10:31.931 - 00:10:33.443, Speaker A: Yeah. The elections and rate cuts.
00:10:33.499 - 00:10:34.715, Speaker B: Yeah. Elections and rate cuts.
00:10:34.795 - 00:10:38.571, Speaker A: Yeah. Aren't. Isn't rate cuts short term, bearish?
00:10:38.723 - 00:10:39.755, Speaker B: No. Why?
00:10:39.915 - 00:10:45.483, Speaker A: For. For the markets. I don't know. Somebody put a report out recently that said that every time there's a rate cut, the markets.
00:10:45.619 - 00:10:46.955, Speaker B: Oh, okay. So, okay.
00:10:46.995 - 00:10:47.655, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:10:49.155 - 00:10:52.139, Speaker B: There's a lot of mass armchair economists.
00:10:52.227 - 00:10:55.031, Speaker A: So I want to make sure that, that we address some of this stuff.
00:10:55.103 - 00:11:36.565, Speaker B: So there's a lot of macro larps on Twitter that think that rate cuts are bearish. But what they're looking at is the historical pattern, which is that whenever the Fed cuts the rates, the market tends to go down. But the fact that they missed is that historically, the vast majority of the times when the Fed cuts rates, it's when the market. It was when the economy was not doing well. So the economy was heading towards recession, depression, and the Fed needed some stimulus, and rate cuts was one of them. But this time it's actually different. This time the Fed is not cutting rates because the economy is doing poorly.
00:11:36.565 - 00:12:08.389, Speaker B: In fact, the economy is doing really, really well. They're cutting the rates because inflation has more or less stabilized and they want to. Well, there's a stated reason and there's a real reason. The real reason, I think, is pumping the markets a little bit ahead of the. Ahead of the election for the Democrats. But anyway, the point being this time the rates cut is fundamentally based on a different reason from the majority of historical instances. So this time the rate cuts are actually bullish.
00:12:08.517 - 00:12:41.025, Speaker A: Yeah, I'd agree with that. So between rate cuts, I was just reading a tweet a few minutes ago that talked about how rig hits may not even happen because the market's doing so well. So there is that. I don't know how big of a reason this is, but because the economy is doing so well, there could be a possibility that the Fed may push it till next year. Because before, when we first started the year, I think the market was pricing in three rate cuts this year. Then it went down to two. Now it seems like it's going down to one, and that one could go down to zero.
00:12:41.025 - 00:12:51.045, Speaker A: And so it'll be interesting to see how Powell and the Fed reacts to this as the market starts to do well.
00:12:51.125 - 00:12:54.477, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, so far it looks like they want to do one before the election.
00:12:54.621 - 00:12:55.653, Speaker A: They have to do one.
00:12:55.749 - 00:13:36.105, Speaker B: Can I show you the. Like, one of the most ridiculous, absurd statistics I've ever seen in my life is that if you look at the return of The S&P 500 three months before the election, 80% of the times, whenever the S and P goes up during those three months, 80% of the time the incumbent wins and 20% of the time the. Or 20% of the time the incumbent loses. So in this case, Biden is the incumbent and Trump is the challenger. So. And vice versa. So whenever the S&P 500 goes down during the three months before the election, 80% chance that the incumbent loses.
00:13:36.105 - 00:13:46.517, Speaker B: It's absurd. Like, it was very consistent over the last. Call it 50 to 100 years. So 25 elections. Ballpark, 20 elections. Call it 20 elections. Very consistent.
00:13:46.517 - 00:13:53.829, Speaker B: So the Democrats must have figured this out by now. So, yeah, they want the market to go up.
00:13:53.957 - 00:13:56.277, Speaker A: So this is like our version of.
00:13:56.301 - 00:14:01.307, Speaker B: Some sort of Ponzi pump the cabal. The cabal pumping the market.
00:14:01.461 - 00:14:11.679, Speaker A: I could dig that. Okay, so we have that. We may have a rate cut. And then now let's think about the elections. Biden wins, then what?
00:14:11.767 - 00:14:12.647, Speaker B: Probably down.
00:14:12.791 - 00:14:14.119, Speaker A: Trump wins, obviously. Good. Up.
00:14:14.167 - 00:14:14.799, Speaker B: Go up.
00:14:14.927 - 00:14:32.545, Speaker A: All right, so I think this is a good summary for what's to come over the next six months. I think it seems like on Twitter right now it's consensus that it's going to be chop down, chop until volume expands and. And people are hedging their bets against the election.
00:14:32.665 - 00:15:03.519, Speaker B: I don't actually disagree with the consensus. Most of the time I don't disagree with the consensus. And the other FUD is Nvidia. People think Nvidia is topping. An tweeted about the chart looking like parabolic increase. And I tweeted about Nvidia insiders selling their shares at a faster pace than ever while their retail flow is incoming. I'm not sure what to make of Nvidia.
00:15:03.519 - 00:15:21.785, Speaker B: The reason why Nvidia is so important is because it feels like Nvidia is what holds the entire market. So if Nvidia holds the stock market, I mean, I don't want to draw a strong conclusion, but Nvidia does seem like the market leader right now. So that's the other piece of the fud. I don't think it is that important.
00:15:21.935 - 00:15:23.917, Speaker A: I don't either. We'll have to see.
00:15:24.021 - 00:15:42.205, Speaker B: But my main argument is we can go up on good news. We went up a little bit too fast earlier this year, so we're now taking a break. And at the same time, there's no reason to believe that the cycle is over. We probably go up. We'll probably be higher at the end of the year than today.
00:15:42.325 - 00:15:47.101, Speaker A: I'd agree with that. I do think though, that this chop is going to be brutal. It's going to be brutal.
00:15:47.253 - 00:15:58.105, Speaker B: The slower, the longer it takes, the more brutal it is and the more you should delete Twitter. It's going to be like over the last two weeks where Twitter, crypto. Twitter was insufferable.
00:15:58.225 - 00:16:03.985, Speaker A: It was horrible. I mean, there were certain days where I just wouldn't even log on. Like, it was. It was really bad. It was really negative.
00:16:04.105 - 00:16:12.521, Speaker B: You know, I wouldn't have logged on at all except for the fact that all my fantasy bag holders are shitting on me for not tweeting.
00:16:12.633 - 00:16:25.975, Speaker A: What's new. I get shitted on by them. But I try to perform. I try to be a good player. It's bad when I get your players texting me and DMing me, people telling.
00:16:26.015 - 00:16:27.795, Speaker B: You to tell me to tweet more.
00:16:28.095 - 00:16:37.375, Speaker A: Hey man, tell Chow to tweet. But, oh, we should talk about. Obviously today is the launch of blast.
00:16:37.535 - 00:16:38.319, Speaker B: Oh, is it?
00:16:38.447 - 00:17:01.221, Speaker A: Yeah, the Blast Foundation. And today ends the sixth tournament for Fantasy Top as well. And so they're distributing blast gold to everyone and everyone's awaiting and speculating what the Blast token is in a price out at. And I checked Abel last night and it was around $3 per token.
00:17:01.333 - 00:17:03.413, Speaker B: And what's the supply?
00:17:03.549 - 00:17:05.885, Speaker A: I'll have to check. I'm not sure exactly.
00:17:06.005 - 00:17:08.285, Speaker B: I would imagine it's a billion or something.
00:17:08.445 - 00:17:11.681, Speaker A: Yeah, number, nice round number.
00:17:11.833 - 00:17:19.369, Speaker B: Arbitrum right now is 8 billion FTV. So if blast is at 3, I would say it's pretty fair.
00:17:19.497 - 00:17:43.013, Speaker A: So Xerox Bread guy who's also a listener of our podcast said that about. He says 5.8 billion FTV feels low for blast. For blast, 1 billion circulating. So people are speculating right now, you know, 1 billion circulating market cap. 6 billion FTV is roughly what people think. About 14% of the total supply for BLAST will be an airdrop.
00:17:43.013 - 00:17:45.997, Speaker A: 14 billion tokens have been transferred to a smart contract.
00:17:46.141 - 00:17:52.805, Speaker B: I don't think BLAST should be priced higher than Arbitrum. Arbitrum is still the obvious front runner.
00:17:52.925 - 00:18:21.943, Speaker A: Well, Arbitrum also has liquidity shocks, right? I mean they had a huge unlock and sure two big unlocks. Right. One was they had a $200 million fund that they. There was a DAO governance vote where they're building out like a gaming catalyst fund. So there's 200 million arb that has been allocated for that. And then now they have some big VC unlocks that are happening over the next few years. So I do think there is going to be a supply shock there.
00:18:21.943 - 00:18:29.097, Speaker A: So yeah, I'll be curious to see how BLAST will turn up, but people are very bullish on BLAST generally.
00:18:29.231 - 00:18:35.185, Speaker B: We should do an overview, a summary, lessons learned for the first half of the year.
00:18:35.485 - 00:18:36.677, Speaker A: Yeah, let's do it.
00:18:36.821 - 00:18:45.445, Speaker B: Because now it's end of July, end of June, six months have passed. What happened where we are in the market. Why are people so jaded on Twitter?
00:18:45.605 - 00:19:24.143, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I mean, obviously the first one we're going to talk about is like speculation, right? Speculation was kind of one of our core thesis over the past two years. And one of the byproducts of speculation is meme coins. And so the good and bad, well, high level, I think the good is that attention is now being tokenized. Right. So it is a form of attention. And we're starting to see this with Pump Fund. Well, it really started with Friend tech as a core idea of how people were going to tokenize themselves, as an example.
00:19:24.143 - 00:19:56.831, Speaker A: And then it led to Pump Fun, which led to anyone being able to create their own token and launch it for $2. And so then you started to see a lot of interest around Meme Coins Launch. And then more or less towards the latter half of the year we started to see like tokenizing creators through Fantasy Top and then more recently Time Fun. And so being able to tokenize time as well for a creator. And then the macro is just like tokens everywhere. Right. So you have Whiff as an example.
00:19:56.831 - 00:20:21.185, Speaker A: We talked earlier about like Dog Whiff Hat, which was one of the leading meme coins for the year. Bonk was another one. And what else? I mean we saw pups, we saw wizards, ordinals, et cetera. But we'll talk about more on the, on the macro for meme coins. So those were all the things that went right? I think so, yeah. Let's touch on that.
00:20:23.045 - 00:20:25.093, Speaker B: What do you want to talk about there?
00:20:25.229 - 00:20:38.781, Speaker A: Well, I think those are the things that went right. Right. Like where? I wouldn't say right, but that's what happened. That was a current market. So I think there's two things that I see. Right. One is like, I think there's some market fatigue in meme coins.
00:20:38.781 - 00:20:46.519, Speaker A: So the rate of meme coins that have launched, I think you had the last number, right? I think it was like 100,000 coins a day.
00:20:46.567 - 00:20:51.807, Speaker B: Was it five figures? Five or six figures? Can't remember. But something really absurd?
00:20:51.911 - 00:21:29.435, Speaker A: Yeah, it was something really absurd. And I think there was market fatigue in the sense that people don't know what coins to buy anymore because the rate of tokens are launching is upwards of 100,000. And so whiff was easy back then because all the attention, there was a lot of attention in the room and people were able to kind of corral the community to buy a token which was whiff or bonk. Now it's much harder. Like getting people together to buy a token is very, very hard. And so what? So I think what's happening is there's different fragmentations of the meme coin market. One quadrant is Primarily, I'd say PvP.
00:21:29.435 - 00:22:11.005, Speaker A: And so if you look at what's happening on pump as an example, it's very competitive, I would say, to get a token to actually to the market, because you have two sides to this. You have people that want to buy, but then there's people that want to extract value. And for that I see it being very competitive to even getting it to the market. Number two is the ones that do make it to the market, the average person will not understand what to buy next. So then they look for influencers that are able to be the signal to the market to show which coins that they should buy. So I'd say that's like quarter number two. Then you have quarter number three, which is like existing blueprint.
00:22:11.005 - 00:22:35.623, Speaker A: I don't like blue chip memes. Right. I wouldn't even say blue chips, but the ones that have Lindy, but they are higher fdv. So you have that as kind of like the third quadrant. And then the last quadrant is probably, I would say meme coins on other chains, the ones that aren't dominant. So right now the dominant chain is Solana. So a lot of the attention is aggregate on Solana.
00:22:35.623 - 00:22:51.879, Speaker A: But then you also have meme coins on base, you have meme coins on ARB Senko, which their layer three just launched, et cetera, et cetera. So you have this other quadrant of memes. So I would say generally speaking, this is kind of where we are from a macro perspective on meme coins.
00:22:51.967 - 00:22:54.555, Speaker B: I'm just really tired of talking about meme coins.
00:22:54.975 - 00:22:59.381, Speaker A: I think the market exhausted. I mean the fatigue is real.
00:22:59.533 - 00:23:26.389, Speaker B: Yeah. So there's fatigue towards meme coins, but also there's at the same time fatigue towards infra. And those are the two things that caught people's attention in the first half of the year. Right. Those are the only two things. There's so many infra investments and that's on the VC side and then on the retail side is they trade meme coins. It's very bifurcated.
00:23:26.389 - 00:23:30.765, Speaker B: It's very binary actually. The retail trade, meme coins and NVCs.
00:23:30.805 - 00:23:52.921, Speaker A: Fund infra, it's the same thing. They're both memes. Right? Yeah. So I think for meme coins I do feel like the market is taking a break from it and I think it's just going to be one of those things that people aren't going to talk about as much, at least for the next few months. People are just going to get chopped up. But there will be a few memes that will stand out eventually. And so I think those are the ones that people are going to rally around.
00:23:52.921 - 00:23:58.369, Speaker A: But it seems like Dog Whiff had is the meme in itself is like. I haven't been hearing much about it.
00:23:58.417 - 00:24:07.449, Speaker B: Recently except from Don, who has been bearish since the top after missing out on the 50X.
00:24:07.497 - 00:24:10.041, Speaker A: Of course, I think he missed out on a lot of things.
00:24:10.153 - 00:24:10.805, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:24:11.145 - 00:24:12.401, Speaker A: But he's great at calling tops.
00:24:12.433 - 00:24:15.609, Speaker B: Though recently he did sell BTC at 38.
00:24:15.737 - 00:24:37.195, Speaker A: That's right. All right, so let's talk about a couple other things. So I don't know if you saw that announcement that Bored Apes or Yuga Labs made. Was it like three months, like a month ago where they launched a. Some sort of like offshoot of a punks collection? And did you see the punks? Did you see the offshoot nft?
00:24:37.315 - 00:24:40.455, Speaker B: Yeah, it was one of the ugliest things I've ever seen.
00:24:43.275 - 00:25:01.267, Speaker A: I mean it was horrible. And they like borrow the name of punks. They called it punk something. I don't even know. But it looked pretty bad. And so the market reacted aggressively and started selling crypto punks because of that. And then like I thought a lot, like a lot about it.
00:25:01.267 - 00:25:32.867, Speaker A: One, because my fantasy top holders kept bugging me to tweet. So I spent the whole afternoon thinking about like a good idea to tweet. And I looked at the NFT market and recently cbb, who was one of the largest market makers on Blur, decided that he isn't going to market make on Blur anymore. And as soon as he pulled the liquidity, all of the NFTs say like, you know, the popular ones like pudgies and Bored Apes and all and Some other collections ended up going down like another like 10 to 20%.
00:25:33.011 - 00:25:39.515, Speaker B: Wait, but CBB, wait, why did he stop market making? Is it because the rewards ran like.
00:25:39.595 - 00:25:57.235, Speaker A: The rewards ran out? He didn't give an exact reason, but he says, he just said it was a been a wild ride. Probably one of our most challenging times in crypto so far. It's time for us to close this chapter. He farmed 25% of total points. Farmed top one on rolling 24 hour leaderboard for 175 days. But I don't think the risk reward was there anymore for him.
00:25:57.315 - 00:26:00.589, Speaker B: Crazy. 25% of all the rewards. That's crazy.
00:26:00.707 - 00:26:22.425, Speaker A: Yeah. He was probably by far one of the best performing farmers probably ever did incredibly well. He lost $3.5 million in his last season, I think. So that was probably a function of that. Right. Like typically you can lose money because you know that the tokens will make up for it, but there's a point in time where the tokens will not help.
00:26:22.425 - 00:26:31.731, Speaker A: Right. And you know, if you look at where we are in the NFT macro NFT perspective, there's not a lot of buying and selling happening on NFTs anymore.
00:26:31.843 - 00:26:54.435, Speaker B: Yeah. So yeah, this is a big theme in the first half of the year. Right. Feels like all the attention shifted away from NFTs to meme coins among the speculators. I'm looking at the cryptopunks price chart right now. It's one of the ugliest price charts I've ever seen. Especially I mean since the beginning of the year, since January, it's down.
00:26:54.435 - 00:27:09.421, Speaker B: Only it's a straight line down. It went from 60 ETH to below 30 now. Straight line down. So the question is, will NFTs come back? Will the JPEGs come back? The PFPs come back?
00:27:09.533 - 00:27:30.755, Speaker A: I think it will. Here's my thesis. My thesis is that because NFTs are so illiquid, the price action that we see generally when we see what we see in meme coins will take years to play out versus months to play out. And so that's kind of, it's a function of that. Right. The liquidity of the assets. I also say number two is the market's trying to figure out what are NFTs really good for.
00:27:30.755 - 00:28:21.099, Speaker A: If meme coins are highly speculative machines or assets, what are left for NFTs? And number three is I think we're seeing the good and bad players come out of or emerging out of this kind of backdrop of 2021 NFT Marketplace or the NFT Boom. And we're seeing some slow motion growth and then we're seeing some slow motion losses. So the. Let's talk about the growth because I think there's a lot of cool stuff happening on the growth side. Pudgy Penguins is an example, is a really good example of good stories and NFTs. And so like Luca as an example, if you don't know, ended up buying the collection from kind of a grifter in the NFT space. And he, I think rallied around like two, two and a half million dollars about the collection from this person.
00:28:21.099 - 00:28:57.573, Speaker A: Right. And then from there the idea was bringing this IP to more people. And so one concept was license the IP to build toys and release toys out to the consumers. The other idea, which I'm a pretty big fan of, is the concept of bringing more familiarity to the brand by using digital content. And so I did some research on this before I put this tweet up. But if you look at Pudgy Penguin's presence across social media, it's very, very strong. So here's some data they'll share.
00:28:57.573 - 00:29:19.279, Speaker A: I'm going to share my screen here to show you. Let me know when you see my screen. But if you look at Pudgy penguins, they have 1.4 million followers on Instagram. 372 posts, 95 million for their most popular reel. If you look at, you know, TikTok as an example, look at all the numbers here. 12 million likes, all time likes.
00:29:19.279 - 00:29:25.599, Speaker A: If you look at Giphy as an example, 11,000 GIF uploads, 20 billion views. And the numbers kind of go the.
00:29:25.607 - 00:29:27.039, Speaker B: Pajik Giphis are the best.
00:29:27.167 - 00:29:39.167, Speaker A: They're the best. And so like that kind of gives you an idea. 20 billion views. That's insanity. I mean like, look at this, 23 million examples. 700. Yeah.
00:29:39.167 - 00:30:04.129, Speaker A: So you could tell like Pudgy understands the market really well and is going for it. Here's a, here's. So let's contrast that to Yuga Labs as an example. Yuga Labs has 547,000 followers on Instagram with 600. Their most viewed reel is at 600,000. Yuga Labs doesn't even have a Giphy account. As an example.
00:30:04.129 - 00:30:33.677, Speaker A: YouTube on YouTube is a good, another good comparison. Pudgy has 1.6 million views. Yuga Labs has 1.4 million views with one video accounting for 800,000 views, which was the other side trailer from two years ago. And so to me, if you look at the market, I feel like there's two players, like I'M going to put Pudgy Penguins against Yuga Labs or Igloo against Yuga Labs. Pudgy Penguin self funded, raise a modest round and has a clear direction on where they're going.
00:30:33.677 - 00:31:20.285, Speaker A: They're going to get the ip familiarize with as many people as possible globally and then from there you could use that as a wedge to building products. So the first product is toys, but then you can upsell, right? Then you could do maybe shows, digital content, you know, and then continue to go up from there. Whereas Yuga Labs came in from a very different direction, which is they became very successful very quickly, raised $400 million, 450 million plus all the mints that it did. So let's say $600 million or 550 million total. So they came in with the position of power and influence and they've tried many experiments. So they made a song with Eminem and 50 Cent or whatever. I don't if you remember that horrible song.
00:31:20.285 - 00:31:40.521, Speaker A: So they went, they went culture first. They went. So they try to go top down, culture first. Then they try to. They built a game, Dookie Dash as an example. And so they're doing different things. They have an NFT only club where they're planning to build a kind of a exclusive club or something.
00:31:40.521 - 00:31:49.473, Speaker A: But to me, directionally, I don't know what they're doing. I don't like. If I was to, if you were to ask me what a one liner is for Yugalabs, I don't know what that is. It's very hard for me to tell you.
00:31:49.569 - 00:32:12.497, Speaker B: They keep launching new things that dilute the value of existing collections. Right example, the new collections that launched a couple weeks ago, that was ugly as fuck. Whereas Pudgy just focuses on one collection, one brand, one identity and drives all the attention to that one collection 100%.
00:32:12.641 - 00:32:22.449, Speaker A: And I think that's the, the right approach. Joe actually from our team recently wrote a tweet thread about decentralizing Disney as an example.
00:32:22.497 - 00:32:24.537, Speaker B: I love that thread. You want to read it out?
00:32:24.641 - 00:32:59.029, Speaker A: It's a great thread and that's probably the right approach. So like MFERS is an example, started going the GIPHY route, right? Getting more and more views. I think they got like 15, 20 million views on their GIPHY account for MFRS. And I think for some reason, to me that is the right approach. All of the NFT collections should be on giphy, they should be on Instagram, they should be in front of as many audience as possible. And once you get that IP familiarized Then that's a great wedge into competing against Disney. And to me, if you ask me, this is probably the right time to compete against Disney.
00:32:59.029 - 00:33:15.623, Speaker A: They're too big. They're starting to lose money, they're starting to lose focus. There's a lot of things that are going wrong for Disney today, and I think there is a wedge against that kind of backdrop. And then being able to build something that's like crypto native, digitally native first, and then building a community from there.
00:33:15.719 - 00:33:58.003, Speaker B: I mean, fundamentally, you were talking about how they should be on TikTok, on Instagram, on Giphy, all that stuff. Fundamentally, that makes me think that NFTs are tokenized attention. Right? Bringing. Bringing the NFTs back to our original theme of tokenized attention is not fundamentally different from Meme coins. It's all about attention, right? It's not different from Meme Coins, not different from fantasy tokenizing creators. It's not different from Time Fun, which is tokenizing people's time. All these different products and verticals are basically tokenizing our attention here.
00:33:58.139 - 00:34:16.099, Speaker A: So here's a great example. Disney, their account has 1800 uploads with 17.4 billion gift views. Pudging Penguins, 11.4 thousand GIF uploads, 22 billion gift views. I mean, there's something going on over there. There's something going on over there.
00:34:16.099 - 00:35:02.965, Speaker A: And I think what's happening is we're starting to see that Disney is starting to, you know, look, I'm speculating here, um, but it seems to me that Disney's kind of slowing down on the, on the digital content strategy. You know, like this new forms of attention, ways to get attention, TikTok, GIF, Giphy, you know, et cetera. And, you know, there are other IP that's starting to take that, those fill those pockets and get in front of users more. I think that's where I see this going. And then eventually, you know, I think this is still an experiment, but, you know, Pudgy Penguins has something called Overpass, where people can license. Like, if I have an nft, I can license this to Pudgy Penguins. And then Pudgy Penguins will use this pool of, you know, people that.
00:35:02.965 - 00:35:36.973, Speaker A: Of NFTs that people are willing to license as a way to license it and then return some of that revenue back to NFT holders. I'm not sure if that's the right approach, but at least there's some value being given to NFT holders, I think. To me, you know, okay, Disney is an example. People are willing to die to go to A theme park for Disney. They're spending hundreds and thousands of dollars. They get the best hotels, they get as close as possible to the theme park. They go onto the theme park a few times a year, they watch every movie, they buy every toy.
00:35:36.973 - 00:35:59.705, Speaker A: There's fanatics that are out there. Imagine if all that could be given to free for NFT holders as an example. How much? I mean, that in itself is a lot of value. Right. And that could be a world where, you know, if Pudgy Penguins becomes very popular, you know, that could be something that could be a free incentive for NFT holders. Not saying that that's their direction, but that's an interesting speculative idea to think about.
00:35:59.825 - 00:36:01.809, Speaker B: Even Pudges is down really bad.
00:36:01.937 - 00:36:02.673, Speaker A: It's over.
00:36:02.809 - 00:36:06.689, Speaker B: Pudges down over 50% since the beginning of the year.
00:36:06.817 - 00:36:41.213, Speaker A: Yeah, it's 8.4. But I think today was the second time Pudgy surpassed Board Apes again. Yeah. So I think the market's starting to realize that Pudgy has, at least as of today, a good direction as to where they're going to go. Like, people can understand that. So I think one of the metas in NFTs is like, why would I want to buy an NFT next? Well, I want to buy an NFT because I could see this art or this DNFT as a means to some form of IP in the future that could be very successful. That's like one way to think about it.
00:36:41.213 - 00:36:45.845, Speaker A: Not saying it's all entirety, but that's one way to think about why I would want to buy an nft.
00:36:45.965 - 00:36:48.837, Speaker B: Any other major themes in the first half of the year?
00:36:49.021 - 00:37:00.381, Speaker A: Defi. You want to talk about Defi? I know Defi hasn't been that important of a topic these days because not much is happening there, but anything in Defi that you want to talk about.
00:37:00.493 - 00:37:02.933, Speaker B: I mean, you could consider restaking as defi.
00:37:03.069 - 00:37:03.745, Speaker A: Sure.
00:37:04.685 - 00:37:20.557, Speaker B: There aren't that many. Super interesting. Well, Jupiter launched first half of the year. Well, I guess what's interesting in Defi is I haven't seen the numbers recently, but I feel like Solana is ahead of Ethereum now on many of the defi metrics.
00:37:20.701 - 00:37:29.279, Speaker A: Are they? Yeah, let's see. So right now, Ethereum. Are we comparing Ethereum to Solana or are we taking.
00:37:29.477 - 00:37:31.747, Speaker B: Let's start just with Ethereum mainnet.
00:37:31.851 - 00:37:37.387, Speaker A: Ethereum mainnet has 57 billion total value locked and Solana has 4 billion.
00:37:37.531 - 00:37:39.323, Speaker B: No, TVL is not a good.
00:37:39.419 - 00:37:40.483, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't think TVL is a good.
00:37:40.499 - 00:37:43.243, Speaker B: Yeah, let's look at Trading volume.
00:37:43.299 - 00:37:44.643, Speaker A: Volume. Do you have it?
00:37:44.739 - 00:37:53.875, Speaker B: Yeah. So Solana, actually Ethereum is still ahead, Ethereum Mainnet is still ahead, but they are within the same order of magnitude.
00:37:53.995 - 00:37:54.785, Speaker A: Trading, Molly.
00:37:54.875 - 00:38:03.973, Speaker B: Trading volume. Yeah, Dex, volume. This month, ethereum has done 35 billion and Solana did 29 billion. Yeah, they're very close.
00:38:04.109 - 00:38:04.837, Speaker A: Very close.
00:38:04.941 - 00:38:27.433, Speaker B: Obviously not including the L2s. Layer Twos are doing a lot of volume too. Arbitrum is doing 10 billion, BEIS is doing 10, blast is doing 2. Okay, so the two main L2s are Bayes and Arbitrum. Together they're doing 20 billion. All the. I would imagine that all the L2s combined are doing similar volume to Ethereum Mainnet.
00:38:27.433 - 00:38:52.661, Speaker B: Okay, so this is the other really big theme, which is the rise of L2s this past year or half a year, I think I'm looking at L2 beats. Yeah. So the total TPS on L2s has been up only for the last two years. So right now together it's all the L2s are doing around 140 TPS.
00:38:52.813 - 00:38:54.165, Speaker A: One hundred and forty TPS, yeah.
00:38:54.205 - 00:39:20.205, Speaker B: Whereas Ethereum layer one is doing like 1312. So L2s now are combined, they're doing 10 times more TPS than Ethereum layer one. And the trend is very clear. It's been up for the last couple of years. Obviously a lot of that has to do with. Well, so there's several factors. There's 48, 44, which reduced the cost of data availability, which was a couple months ago, and then there's the fact that there's actually more and more L2s.
00:39:20.205 - 00:39:41.701, Speaker B: Right. And all these contribute to the total number of tps. There's Baze, that launched a year ago, but really grew in the past half a year or so. There's Tyco, there's Blast. Arbitrum continues to dominate Optimism. Mainnet is doing pretty well too. So Layer Twos are really taking off.
00:39:41.701 - 00:39:45.029, Speaker B: That's the other big trend of the first half of the year.
00:39:45.157 - 00:40:17.613, Speaker A: And the question is, obviously this is going to continue, accelerate. How many Layer Twos do you think we'll see? Obviously maybe we could touch on this, but a lot of startups are going the L2 route, raising, hoping to get the market cap from a public markets perspective. There's an ARB there, so founders are arming that as an example, and that's somewhat of creating value back to token holders, which I think is false. But if you were to think about the power law, how many successful Layer Twos do you think we'll see?
00:40:17.629 - 00:40:36.225, Speaker B: In the market, I think we see a handful of. By handful, I mean literally five ballpark, five successful general purpose L2s that matter. Right. So today that's Arbitrum Optimism, Bayes Blast. Can you think of anyone else? That's pretty much it.
00:40:37.255 - 00:40:43.695, Speaker A: Polygon. Well, not Polygon, the side chain, but you have the kind of the CDK model as well.
00:40:43.735 - 00:41:01.155, Speaker B: Yeah, Polygon, Polygon. The ZKEVM isn't doing a lot of TPS or volume. You could consider ZK Sync, Linear Mental Scroll, I would say the tier two.
00:41:01.455 - 00:41:14.739, Speaker A: So there's like two. You know, I feel like there's kind of two models. Right. One is a super chain model like optimism. Right. Optimism. ZK Sync and Polygon cdk.
00:41:14.739 - 00:41:21.003, Speaker A: Right. Where you could roll up, essentially create your own roll ups that sync up to the.
00:41:21.139 - 00:41:23.011, Speaker B: Does ZK Sync also offer that?
00:41:23.083 - 00:41:27.795, Speaker A: I thought they did because all these.
00:41:27.955 - 00:41:33.865, Speaker B: Major projects want to own their own ecosystem and enable anyone to launch their app chains.
00:41:34.025 - 00:41:52.577, Speaker A: And there's some benefits to it. Right. There's, you know, with Polygon, there's the AG layer. Right. So there's some sort of composability and speed latency between different rollups in terms of like cross chain comms. Super chain optimism doesn't have that yet. As an example, I'm not sure about Zksync.
00:41:52.577 - 00:41:54.601, Speaker A: Maybe I was wrong about Zksync. I have to take a look.
00:41:54.713 - 00:41:58.219, Speaker B: Yeah, Arbitrum has that, Polygon has that, OP has that.
00:41:58.347 - 00:41:59.055, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:41:59.915 - 00:42:48.425, Speaker B: But point being, I think there will be a handful of these general purpose L2s that matter and then there will just be hundreds, if not thousands of app chain L2s. If crypto was to succeed, that's what's going to happen. Like there's going to be a proliferation of app specific L2s because people want, developers want to, want to own their own stack. They want to accrue all the value instead of letting the value accrue to another L2 or layer one. And they want to make sure that they're not competing for the same block space with other developers. So they want to own their block space. So it's a very natural trend for app specific L2s to continue to proliferate.
00:42:48.565 - 00:43:03.593, Speaker A: That sounds about right to me. Yeah. So the ZK stack is ZK Chains and Lens protocol is one of them. It's called ZK Stack Hyperchain. I can't deal with the buzzwords anymore.
00:43:03.689 - 00:43:09.525, Speaker B: Super chain CDK Hyperchain. Hyperchain. What's the arbitram one called?
00:43:10.345 - 00:43:26.575, Speaker A: Orbits, Orbits, Orbits, Orbits and so yeah, I could get around that thesis where we'll have like four or five infras, right? And then you'll have. So we'll have two things right infra and then maybe just L2s on its own.
00:43:28.315 - 00:44:01.809, Speaker B: And then there's the rise of caldera conduit, like these roll ups as a service. Those projects are doing pretty well as a result of more apps wanting to launch their own L2s. So that's another pretty big trend. Anything else? Oh, AI, the AI crypto. I don't know how we forgot about that, but AI crypto was a top three trend in the first half of the year. I would say probably on par with the whole meme coin mania.
00:44:01.937 - 00:44:37.005, Speaker A: So tell me more about the AI in the crypto space. Because Eric, well, a well known bitcoiner that is working on launching OPCAD as an example, said he made a tweet and he said something in the order of if you're a founder looking to build in the crypto AI space, just build in the AI space. Don't dilute yourself by building. This is not word for word, but I'm paraphrasing here, but he said build in the AI space. Don't do crypto AI. You're just diluting yourself or something like that. What are your thoughts on that?
00:44:37.465 - 00:44:51.445, Speaker B: Well, again, we talked about this before, but I still think most of the AI crypto projects don't make sense and they are just being very opportunistic, taking advantage of the hype and the VC FOMO and the retail fomo.
00:44:52.585 - 00:44:58.257, Speaker A: Any AI projects you're excited about today? Crypto AI. Let's talk about that instead.
00:44:58.401 - 00:45:17.253, Speaker B: Well, I mean there are things I'm very open minded to. I don't know if they'll work, but I'm very open minded to the possibility of. For example, Eric Voorhees launched his decentralized AI project a few weeks ago, remember?
00:45:17.349 - 00:45:18.733, Speaker A: Yes, yes, I remember that.
00:45:18.789 - 00:45:55.597, Speaker B: That was exactly the same idea that I, that that XO is working on. So this is the other AI like Edge AI product that, that we mentioned a couple episodes ago. Right. So the ability to run open source models on your local device in a way that preserves privacy, decentralization and unbiasedness. Right. Some of the LLMs like ChatGPT or Gemini are very politically biased. So EXO is one of those projects and the other one is what Eric Voorhees launched a few weeks ago.
00:45:55.597 - 00:46:27.431, Speaker B: Those are very interesting to me. They're actually solving a real problem. The real problem is Political bias and privacy. Interestingly, I think I saw that Eric Voorhees product is running on a cache, which is the decentralized GPU marketplace. I was really biased against the GPU marketplaces before, but that changed my mind a little bit. So that's interesting. So basically they're running inference on a decentralized GPU marketplace.
00:46:27.431 - 00:47:33.915, Speaker B: Interesting, but there is a caveat here. So one of the main arguments for decentralized GPU marketplaces is that by leveraging latent hardware you can actually enable cheaper services than using something like AWS or some major incumbent cloud services. Right, because you're just taking a piece of GPU that's sitting there doing nothing. So the theory is that using that GPU you can offer cheaper services than centralized services. But I don't really buy this because historically, if you think about it's not really using latent hardware that enable cheaper services, lower cost, it's really specialization that actually lowers the cost. So if you think about Bitcoin mining, for example, sure today you can use your GPU or your CPU to mine Bitcoin, but you won't even be able to cover the cost. It's not efficient enough.
00:47:33.915 - 00:47:56.695, Speaker B: You can use the latent CPU on your own laptop to mine Bitcoin, but it's not going to be cheap. What is cheap and efficient is the asics, the Bitmain specialized hardware, the hardware that's specifically designed for bitcoin mining. That stuff is cheap. It's cheaper than anything cheaper, but it's highly productive.
00:47:56.735 - 00:47:58.151, Speaker A: And it has speed, right?
00:47:58.263 - 00:47:59.031, Speaker B: It has what?
00:47:59.143 - 00:48:00.607, Speaker A: Speed. Yeah, speed of execution.
00:48:00.631 - 00:48:02.271, Speaker B: Cheaper, more efficient and faster.
00:48:02.423 - 00:48:02.919, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:48:03.007 - 00:48:23.727, Speaker B: And I think the same thing is going to happen with the GPU marketplaces. It's not that using the latent GPUs that lowers the cost is is probably going to be the big players who are able to specialize, produce specialized AI hardware that lowers the cost.
00:48:23.871 - 00:48:45.953, Speaker A: So then the thesis then is instead of your GPUs sitting around and you put it to work as an example, the better thesis might be that a provider can aggregate these GPUs kind of like cloud mining. An example. Could you see that thesis play out instead? Instead of having, you know. Yeah, maybe compare compressed the two.
00:48:46.049 - 00:48:46.905, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe.
00:48:47.065 - 00:48:56.793, Speaker A: Okay, because then if it's co located in one singular data center, as an example, then you can provide the same services as other larger providers. Right.
00:48:56.849 - 00:49:10.579, Speaker B: I think it's the, the providers that are able, that can, that that are able to lower the cost are those who can procure the latest specialized GPUs or even manufacture them themselves.
00:49:10.747 - 00:49:12.415, Speaker A: So it has to be centralized.
00:49:12.755 - 00:49:14.163, Speaker B: I think it has to be centralized.
00:49:14.219 - 00:49:15.043, Speaker A: It has to be centralized.
00:49:15.099 - 00:49:56.673, Speaker B: The point. So, okay, so here's the nuance. The I'm skeptical of the thesis that decentralized GPUs can lower the cost, but I do think that there is a reason to do decentralized GPUs and that is censorship resistance. And that is why, going back to Eric Voorhees project, he's running his product on a cache which the goal is not to lower cost, but to actually preserve privacy and unbiasedness through decentralization. Through censorship resistance. I think that is the point of decentralized GPUs. It's censorship resistance, decentralization, privacy rather than lower cost.
00:49:56.819 - 00:50:19.805, Speaker A: So that's the thesis. So, so we will know that. Okay, so if you're using any social sort of censorship resistant app as an example, then you know that you're not going to get the speed that you're looking for. But you know that, you know, you don't have to worry about the app being revoked or et cetera. Right. So there is some sort of nuance behavior that the users will know when they're using these types of apps would be the concept. I could buy that.
00:50:19.805 - 00:50:21.145, Speaker A: I could buy that thesis.
00:50:22.415 - 00:50:42.711, Speaker B: So AI crypto is big also. Another part of AI crypto is proving compute off chain. Compute. So you run some AI inference off chain and you send the output of that inference on chain as an input to a smart contract.
00:50:42.863 - 00:50:44.631, Speaker A: Okay. Kind of like an oracle.
00:50:44.743 - 00:51:06.745, Speaker B: Kind of, yeah, an oracle. Or even though you can think of it as a L2, but AI specialized L2. Right. And you can use ZK to prove the compute. You can use op. And then there's also teams building TEE based solutions to prove the compute. So that's interesting, but it's also a very hard problem.
00:51:06.745 - 00:51:36.601, Speaker B: It's unclear to me what the use cases are today, but we'll see. I'm very open minded to that idea. But the thing I'm most excited about in AI crypto is actually not on the infra layer, it's on the app layer. And we talked about this, we talked about how AI is just becoming better and better at generating content and the speed of improvement is crazy. Like every three months you try a new product.
00:51:36.753 - 00:51:37.753, Speaker A: It's insanity.
00:51:37.889 - 00:51:58.039, Speaker B: You feel the magic. You feel very clear improvement compared to three months ago. And then so you can use AI to generate photos, to generate videos, text based content, et cetera, et cetera, and songs, et cetera, et Cetera. And if you layer a crypto incentive component on top of it, I think there could be some magic.
00:51:58.167 - 00:52:13.299, Speaker A: Let's talk about that magic. I think there's one. Maybe we could start with Crate because that's part of our batch. Yeah, I can touch on it quickly. Crate is a platform where you can launch AI generated songs. And each song also has a bounding curve where you can trade the token. We consider.
00:52:13.299 - 00:52:39.301, Speaker A: We call it Zong Coins. And eventually when we think about trading attention as an example, right now attention is primarily in the form of short form content videos. You're starting to see giphys as an example is another way that attention is being specialized. And I think the next form of specialization is going to be coins. Right? Tokens. And we're already seeing that with Meme coins as an example. Um, song coins is an.
00:52:39.301 - 00:53:03.325, Speaker A: Is another example of what's. How songs could go viral. We saw some form of that already on TikTok with man in Finance. If you saw that short form video, uh, it went viral because it did a few things really well. It she took her vocals and uploaded on TikTok and then enabled more people to take that vocal. Like producers could take that vocal and make songs out of it. So people ended up making song one song really hit and it went viral.
00:53:03.325 - 00:53:08.515, Speaker A: She ended up signing a deal with capitol records for $100 million or something crazy. I'm not sure about the number, but.
00:53:09.455 - 00:53:10.767, Speaker B: The song of the summer.
00:53:10.911 - 00:53:13.351, Speaker A: Song of the Summer, yeah. Man in Finance.
00:53:13.423 - 00:53:14.515, Speaker B: Man in Finance.
00:53:14.895 - 00:53:32.715, Speaker A: And so there is this kind of form of like remixing tokens that will start to take shape. And so we think AI generation is like the kind of the cusp of that. But there are others. I think you're bullish on content video as an example. AI video maybe, if you want to touch on that.
00:53:33.725 - 00:54:12.289, Speaker B: I mean, it's very similar to songs. It's just like AI just getting crazy at producing extremely realistic videos. And you can't tell like, I'm on TikTok, right? Like I'm on TikTok a lot, maybe half an hour a day. And I think now maybe close to a quarter of all the videos in my TikTok feed are AI generated. It's an insane percentage. And if I don't pay attention, if I'm not careful, I would miss the fact that it's AI generated video. Oftentimes I see AI generated podcast of Joe Rogan and Elon Musk, for example.
00:54:12.289 - 00:54:37.619, Speaker B: And it's so realistic that I think it's real. I think it's authentic. But there's a little tag at the bottom of the video that says, this is an AI generated. So TikTok now does some crowdsourced authentication tagging of the AI generated content, but they're so realistic, it's crazy. Oh, another trend is AI girlfriends or.
00:54:37.667 - 00:54:41.987, Speaker A: Maybe later boyfriend AI Waifus. Right?
00:54:42.171 - 00:54:53.001, Speaker B: AI Waifus. Yeah. There's a lot of interesting things here. Like, for example, why is it that AI girlfriends are taking off and not AI AI Boy, didn't you send me.
00:54:53.033 - 00:55:01.569, Speaker A: A tweet recently where some guy got addicted to his waifu and he, like, pushed. He like. He ended up, like, not going to school or something. You sent me a tweet thread on it recently.
00:55:01.617 - 00:55:34.759, Speaker B: Yeah, it's like someone posted on Reddit that character AI is down and he's just feeling really sad, lonely because he has no one to talk to. I think he's a teenager. But that's the other really interesting thing, which is that character AI is doing really well. That's a Web two version of AI Companion. And then there's some specialized versions of character AI that are offering AI girlfriends or boyfriends. Those are also doing really well. I spoke with a few.
00:55:34.759 - 00:55:56.003, Speaker B: I saw their numbers. They're doing crazy. They're growing 20% month over month. So there's very strong product market fit. But then the question is, why are these users of AI girlfriends and boyfriends, like, mostly young people? That's another thing. That is another trend that I saw. Most of them are teenagers or people in their early 20s.
00:55:56.003 - 00:55:57.491, Speaker B: That's also very interesting.
00:55:57.643 - 00:56:15.531, Speaker A: Yeah, you mentioned this also in our Kamal. One idea you highlighted was the fact that most people are terminally online, and so they have the inability to converse in, like, in the real world with people, but they're much better off conversing online with people.
00:56:15.643 - 00:56:16.139, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:56:16.227 - 00:56:19.131, Speaker A: Or, sorry, with. With. With characters instead. It's much easier for them.
00:56:19.163 - 00:56:19.931, Speaker B: AI characters.
00:56:20.043 - 00:56:38.989, Speaker A: Yeah, AI characters. And I think we're already starting to do this, you and I. I mean, like, I talk to Chad GBT every day and learn stuff. Yeah. And so I do feel like this behavior, for those that are term, like, I use chat GPT maybe for 30 minutes a day, 45 minutes. Oh, really?
00:56:39.077 - 00:56:39.357, Speaker B: For what?
00:56:39.381 - 00:57:03.811, Speaker A: Yeah, you know, proofreading. I talk, you know, like, I don't like. I think you and I talked about this, but I don't use Google search as much anymore. And then, like, if I want to learn something or like a concept, then, you know, I'll like, talk it. You know, like, I'll walk through with ChatGPT to figure out what. Where's the missing gap of my of information that I'm trying to understand. As an example, I use it for my.
00:57:03.811 - 00:57:28.085, Speaker A: With my kids for them to get more accustomed to using ChatGPT. The voice, being able to talk through it through a voice. I just bought this rabbit R1. I pre ordered it when it first came out. I mean it's. It's an okay device, but it's a device that I give to my kids so they can start to just like they ask a lot of questions so I give it to them to, you know, get some answers. But I think I'm going to re.
00:57:28.085 - 00:57:43.149, Speaker A: Oh, but the LLM on this sucks. So I'm going to reformat it and then use ChatGPT on there instead. Because ChatGPT is a lot better for just like general purpose info. So I feel like we're already doing this now. Just add a personality to it and it's over.
00:57:43.317 - 00:57:44.065, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:57:46.445 - 00:57:50.765, Speaker A: It'S a part of the family already. I mean it's already a part of the family.
00:57:50.925 - 00:57:53.889, Speaker B: So I watched Andrew Huberman episode recently.
00:57:54.037 - 00:57:54.337, Speaker A: Okay.
00:57:54.361 - 00:58:39.283, Speaker B: By the way, some of you might know that I'm actually pretty critical of Andrew humor, but that one. So his episodes where he interview a guest, those are generally pretty good actually. So I watched one of the recent episodes where he interviewed a scientist that studies Gen Z, especially teenagers. And basically there is a very depressing stat that goes back all the way to 2000s. But basically the percentage of teenagers that get depression or anxiety during their teenage years has been flat until 2012. And then since 2012 it's been going up nonstop since then. So it went from like I don't know, 10% all the way to 30, 40%.
00:58:39.283 - 00:59:26.311, Speaker B: And that's especially true for teenage girls. And people wonder why this stat has been around on Twitter a lot as well. And people have been wondering why 2012 was the year that everything changed. Well, it's kind of obvious in hindsight that year, or maybe plus or minus three was when social media, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube all took off and social media basically led to is causally linked to increased depression, anxiety and more importantly, inability to socialize in real life. Because all the teenagers nowadays are always on their phone, right? Like when they go out and hang out with other kids. I see that on my nephews, by the way. I have two nephews.
00:59:26.311 - 00:59:53.221, Speaker B: They're like in their teenage years and they're constantly on their phone. I mean, so am I. But when I with other people, I still talk to them. But when those kids hang out with other kids, they don't really interact with each other. They're always on their phone. So the year 2012 was a big year. And I think that was also directly responsible for the fact that AI girlfriends and boyfriends are taking off right now.
00:59:53.221 - 01:00:07.069, Speaker B: Because people have lost their ability to interact with other humans in real life to find real boyfriends and girlfriends. It's a lot easier. It takes a lot less effort to get an AI girlfriend and to talk to her.
01:00:07.197 - 01:00:09.733, Speaker A: So much easier. You don't have to play the game.
01:00:09.829 - 01:00:32.901, Speaker B: You don't have to play the game. It's so much easier. So that's going to be a megatrend. But anyway, the reason why I'm talking about this is that there I've seen some teams building AI girlfriend or boyfriend and tokenized AI girlfriends. So you have AI character and that's on chain in the form of a NFT or fungible token or 404 for example. I'm also open minded to that idea.
01:00:33.093 - 01:00:47.141, Speaker A: I think that's already happening. I mean even if you look at you and I maybe my. I'll use myself as an example. It's. I used to be much more, you know, open and talking to people. Now I've just become more reserved over time. I mean, it's just natural because you're always on your phone and computer.
01:00:47.253 - 01:00:48.685, Speaker B: I think that's just you getting old.
01:00:48.805 - 01:00:52.213, Speaker A: Fuck. It's over, guys.
01:00:52.269 - 01:01:00.509, Speaker B: But there's a, there's a clear distinction between people who are born before the 2000s, the year 2000 and after the year 2000. And obviously.
01:01:00.597 - 01:01:02.437, Speaker A: So the Pre Boomer Boomerang.
01:01:02.621 - 01:01:12.211, Speaker B: Yeah. Call it Millennial, Pre Millennial, Millennial and Gen Z. Yeah. So the Millennial generation did not grow up on social media.
01:01:12.323 - 01:01:12.771, Speaker A: That makes sense.
01:01:12.803 - 01:01:24.259, Speaker B: When I, when I was 16 or something. I don't think Facebook, Instagram, Instagram didn't even exist, I think. And Facebook was not as prevalent.
01:01:24.387 - 01:01:24.763, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:01:24.819 - 01:01:27.555, Speaker B: But Gen Z today, they grew up on social media.
01:01:27.675 - 01:01:28.155, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:01:28.235 - 01:01:31.247, Speaker B: Which is really, really, really, really bad for their mental health.
01:01:31.411 - 01:01:42.263, Speaker A: Yeah. Just speaking on AI girlfriends and boyfriends or whatnot, how would this pack crypto? How would they use crypto? Would these be tradable personalities?
01:01:42.439 - 01:02:05.595, Speaker B: Yeah, it's going to be in the form of NFTs or fungible tokens or even a hybrid 404 hybrid, if you remember. And those could be speculatable. To be honest. I think the intersection between the two might be a little bit forced. But I'm open to the possibility. I'm open to the Possibility of AI characters on chain.
01:02:06.335 - 01:02:09.395, Speaker A: AI characters on chain. What does that mean?
01:02:10.015 - 01:02:12.895, Speaker B: A speculatable creator. A creator that.
01:02:12.935 - 01:02:14.527, Speaker A: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:02:14.671 - 01:02:29.373, Speaker B: Think of a fantasy fantasy cards but for AI characters instead of real Twitter creators. Or think of a friend tech but with AI characters rather than real people. Yeah, I could see that.
01:02:29.509 - 01:02:38.509, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean there are already a lot of. I mean I know at least one or two really popular Instagram, I think. AI creators.
01:02:38.597 - 01:02:39.357, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
01:02:39.421 - 01:02:54.865, Speaker A: Purely AI. Right, right. And I think they have millions of followers. It's pretty insane. So they could release a token and people could buy that token and get access to the creator for one on one chats. Does that remind you of something?
01:02:56.285 - 01:02:59.189, Speaker B: Yeah. So frantic. But with AI characters.
01:02:59.357 - 01:03:00.925, Speaker A: Yeah. Or only fans.
01:03:00.965 - 01:03:20.095, Speaker B: Or only fans. Yeah, yeah, that's what you were alluding to. You told me that only some of the OnlyFans girl, or not you, but one of the Abelish. Yeah, one of the founders told us that OnlyFans, some of the OnlyFans girls are using AI chatbot. They don't want to deal with the sense.
01:03:20.135 - 01:03:46.115, Speaker A: Yeah. So it turns out like. Which I didn't know. But OnlyFans as an example, a bulk of the revenue comes from just messages. It isn't the monthly subscription because I guess every group girl has a monthly subscription. And if you buy the subscription, then the goal is for them to message you back and forth. And each message, I think there's a cost to it.
01:03:46.115 - 01:04:12.079, Speaker A: And that's how, that's how they make their money. Apparently the creators make their money is through messaging. And now more and more OnlyFans creators are leveraging bots and they have agencies, but then they also have bots. And these bots do the convo and they try to send like unique pictures or something and they can unlock it for more money. And so this like kind of the messaging is the most important revenue generator for OnlyFans apparently.
01:04:12.147 - 01:04:15.087, Speaker B: Just saying. So people pay per message.
01:04:15.231 - 01:04:28.355, Speaker A: They pay to message. I'm not sure if it's per message, but I do know that that is the bulk of their revenue comes from messaging and unlocking a picture through messages.
01:04:28.935 - 01:04:34.015, Speaker B: You know what it reminds me of? It reminds me of earn. Earn.com, balance thing.
01:04:34.135 - 01:04:34.647, Speaker A: Oh yeah.
01:04:34.711 - 01:04:40.975, Speaker B: Pay to message and Earn to reply. Reply to earn. Yeah, but in the context of.
01:04:41.095 - 01:04:57.395, Speaker A: Yeah, well, technically Time Dash Fund sort of solved that. Right. In a different manner. Which is if you were to buy someone's time as an example. Okay. So think of time for our audience that don't know time. That fund is part of our next batch.
01:04:57.395 - 01:05:33.627, Speaker A: But think of it this way. Everyone's time is on a bonding curve and there's some value associated with, with each of the minute that the creator has on chain. So if I wanted to buy, let's say Nikita Beer as an example, I can buy his time right now at like $60aminute. And if you want to redeem those minutes, you have to redeem them at a 15 minute increments so that I could book time with him and actually have a one on one conversation with them. So that's like the one on one. Right. But you could also buy some minutes and then use that as a way to message them.
01:05:33.627 - 01:05:38.675, Speaker A: So I could buy a minute and I could redeem that one minute to send them. Send them a message.
01:05:38.835 - 01:05:50.155, Speaker B: So, and interestingly, someone ARP the. Or maybe it's not an arp. Maybe, maybe some people didn't do it purposely. But the price on intro. Intro.com or intro.com, but whatever.
01:05:50.155 - 01:06:07.469, Speaker B: The Web 2 intro co, intro co. That's the Web 2 version of time Fun. The price on Intro Co converged and the, and the price on Time Fun converged to each other for Nikita Beer to like.
01:06:07.517 - 01:06:09.325, Speaker A: For a bit. Yeah, for a bit.
01:06:09.445 - 01:06:10.501, Speaker B: For a bit. Okay.
01:06:10.653 - 01:06:25.637, Speaker A: Then obviously the market crashed. But I saw someone's tweet when that launch and someone like, damn it, I just spend $93aminute on Nikita Bear. I could have gotten it for $60.
01:06:25.821 - 01:06:32.685, Speaker B: Yeah, but you cannot exit your position on Intro Co. You can't.
01:06:32.765 - 01:06:33.397, Speaker A: You can't.
01:06:33.501 - 01:06:41.265, Speaker B: Whereas on Time Dot Fun. That's the beauty of crypto. You can. If you, if you decide not to talk to Nikita Beer anymore, you can dump it. You dump it.
01:06:41.845 - 01:07:00.421, Speaker A: Which, which I think I believe this is the way the product should be. You should allow anyone to be a creator. Time should be liquid and you know, because sometimes those creators aren't in demand anymore and they want to still make money, but they can't because they don't know if the price is too high or not. Right. And so the market will tell you whether you're good or not.
01:07:00.613 - 01:07:01.101, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:07:01.173 - 01:07:07.261, Speaker A: Which is, you know, it's reality, but it's a real form of reality for creators.
01:07:07.453 - 01:07:46.471, Speaker B: I think we're going off attention a little bit, but I think we're pretty much done with AI. We spent quite a bit of time on AI. I feel like there's. Oh, I do want to talk about a very big theme, which is financial nihilism and the fact that everyone is extremely jaded, especially some of the OGs the traders are always jaded. The traders on Twitter, they're always, they're so emotional. Yeah, they're always bearish crypto, like they think everything is a scam. But there's also signs of like, you know, long term people, you know, people who work in the industry or even investors getting jaded, getting nihilist, nihilistic about the industry.
01:07:46.471 - 01:08:33.089, Speaker B: I think that was partly, that was what led to the meme coin mania and also resolve it. Like there's a self reinforcing effect between the meme coin mania and the nihilism. But I do want to address it because I think what people are seeing on Twitter is not the reality, it's not the full picture. They're seeing a very small bubble. I think what's happening outside crypto, outside of crypto Twitter is that the most important thing is that stablecoins are taking the world by storm. And I am, I have more and more conviction by the day that stablecoins are a big deal and it's actually creating value. It's not a zero sum game and it's today probably the most important application, non speculative application of crypto.
01:08:33.089 - 01:09:16.781, Speaker B: And I see that in every aspect. I talk to like maybe one stablecoin, one or two stablecoin startups per week and every single one of them that has a live product is growing 10, 20% month over month, if not more. The growth is so compelling. Like the market actually pulls them into 10, 20% month over month growth and that is consistent across the world. It's not just Latin America, but also Africa, Middle East, Turkey especially, and Southeast Asia across the world in developing countries. And people on crypto Twitter don't see that because they're, you know, they're always attracted to the highly volatile crypto assets and they're generally US centric. So they don't care.
01:09:16.781 - 01:09:21.293, Speaker B: They either don't care about what's happening in the rest of the world or they're not interested.
01:09:21.349 - 01:09:25.133, Speaker A: But they're not interested because they use the product every day. They don't need the product.
01:09:25.229 - 01:09:29.781, Speaker B: Exactly. They use the product every day. They send each other stable coins. They send stable coins to exchanges.
01:09:29.933 - 01:09:35.189, Speaker A: Zelle. I mean for us it's not a big deal. For the rest of the world it's a very big deal. So we're living in our own bubble.
01:09:35.317 - 01:10:12.987, Speaker B: And so. Okay, so there's actually just to zoom in into stablecoins right now, there's two main distinct use cases. One is currency hedging. Right. So in the US US people don't need stablecoins because their currency is the US dollar, Europe, Japan or some of the developing countries, their currency are doing okay. So they don't really need a US based stablecoin. But in countries where their local currency is depreciating 10, 20, 30% per year, they can actually use stablecoins as a currency hedge.
01:10:12.987 - 01:10:54.983, Speaker B: And a lot of them happen to not have access to any bank accounts. They're unbanked. And crypto gives them a way to bank themselves and to store their hard earned money in the form of stable coins. So currency hedging, that's one. The other one is cross border payment, right? So people paying each other across countries, across jurisdictions, because international Swift is extremely slow. I was actually talking to someone who worked on Swift, who engineered, who built a system for Swift at one of the major banks, was talking to him about why Swift is so slow. And he told me that the tech itself is actually not that slow.
01:10:54.983 - 01:11:17.565, Speaker B: Like the settlement could be instant, but it's all the layers, the bureaucratic layers, the human labor, the manual processes sitting on top of Swift that makes it extremely, extremely slow. So if you make an international payment today, international wire transfer, it'll take three days at least to settle. But stablecoins is instant and it's basically free.
01:11:18.465 - 01:12:00.245, Speaker A: As you were talking, I just remembered something very interesting, which was I was sitting at a restaurant in Dubai because I was at token 2049 and I was eating and then I kept hearing someone talking about stable coins or like usdt. And I turned to him, I'm like, are you in crypto? He goes, no. And it was some guy from, you know, one of the Middle east countries. And he's, and he, what he was telling me what he was doing was he was essentially operating an OTC desk via WhatsApp using USDT. And I'm like, what brings you here? I'm like. He goes, oh, I stay here, but all my family members are in, I think Jordan or something. I think he said Jordan.
01:12:00.245 - 01:12:15.445, Speaker A: But all his clients live within the Middle East. And what he does is he essentially like does OTC for usdt, for all of the people that are connected to him. And I thought that was just very interesting. And that kind of gives you an idea of how mature the market's getting that people don't understand.
01:12:15.605 - 01:12:19.995, Speaker B: It's really happening across the world outside developing countries.
01:12:20.295 - 01:13:06.217, Speaker A: And you know, it's, it's kind of like, you know, here in the States in the early days, we had these. I don't know if you remember this, but we have like these smaller shops called currency exchanges. Remember those currency exchanges everywhere, even in like in Chicago, people go there mostly to cash in their check or get their DMV licenses or whatever. You know, they have other services that they offer locally. But at one point they were like a currency exchange. And I feel like these types of firms are just going to become like WhatsApp OTC desks across the world and they're just going to, you know, find a way for people to get access to the USDT or USDC and they're going to do this types of kind of local currencies. So that's kind of the way it's looking right now.
01:13:06.217 - 01:13:18.229, Speaker A: But then you're going to start to see more real world firms building real products so accrue and go bankless. Is an example, is a perfect example of what's happening in Africa. And so maybe if you want to.
01:13:18.237 - 01:14:37.427, Speaker B: Talk about that, I mean, yeah, again it's across regions, across every continent except for Antarctica. North America is Mexico mainly the entire Latin America, Europe is Eastern Europe, the entire Africa, inter Africa and then Asia is Southeast Asia. And so every continent is happening. But also the type of customers are heterogeneous. It's not just consumers, it's not just retail people, it's not just individuals paying each other, but also businesses paying each other in usdt for example, there's oil exporters in Asia paying their shadow banking importers in Africa for example and settling USDT because settling in fiat, whatever fiat is much, much slower and more expensive. And there's businesses, non crypto native businesses paying each other in stable coins, paying employees, playing vendors, doing business to business transactions in stablecoins. So it's happening across regions but also happening across types of customers, both retail and businesses.
01:14:37.571 - 01:15:13.185, Speaker A: Yeah. So it turns out shadow banking is a $57 trillion market. I was just looking at the numbers where shadow banking is a concept where you know, it doesn't, you're not relying on the traditional financial system. Right. You have this kind of like black market for dollars. And you know, I hear so many examples of this in South America where there's private dealers where people get access to like dollars in some shape and they're able to kind of allow people to get access to dollars in some shape or form. That market is $57 trillion, which I wasn't aware it was that big.
01:15:13.185 - 01:15:18.301, Speaker A: And so stablecoin could likely eat that market first is the way I see it.
01:15:18.413 - 01:16:15.615, Speaker B: And you know what's interesting, the banks and the central banks don't know what's happening. They know that there's this thing that's happening, but they can't see the, they can't track the transactions, individual transactions, because yeah, the on ramp and off ramp are kyc, but after the in between, all the on chain transactions are not kyc. Often what's happening is, let's say I onramp into USDT from a fiat currency and there's a market maker, an OTC desk or whatever that handles this transaction for me. Okay? But what's happening under the hood is there is a fiat transaction happening. I send the USDT or a stable coin and then the market maker will handle the on chain transaction. They send me the USDT on chain. But the two worlds are separate, even though they're handled by the same player.
01:16:15.615 - 01:16:37.961, Speaker B: And so the banks can only see one side, they can only see what's happening in the banking world, the fiat transactions. They have no idea what's happening on the other side. So they don't know that there's on ramp, off ramp happening. And they don't know, they cannot associate, they cannot identify the type of transactions just by looking at the fiat half of this transaction.
01:16:38.113 - 01:16:46.633, Speaker A: So just on that point, to me it seems that it's in the US's best interest to scale USDC 100%. It's in their best interest.
01:16:46.729 - 01:16:55.071, Speaker B: It'll probably extend the longevity of, of the United States dollars by, I don't know, a decade or two.
01:16:55.263 - 01:17:10.135, Speaker A: And so there is this concept of our dollar or the US's dollar being the kind of what keeps the US in power, right? I mean a lot of the controls that they have across the globe is really primarily predicated on the dollar.
01:17:10.215 - 01:17:16.573, Speaker B: It's what allows the US to print money infinitely as long as the US dollar is the world reserve currency.
01:17:16.669 - 01:18:08.979, Speaker A: So there's a concept, what's happening right now, which is like this multipolar world, right, that we're starting to move into, which is the west versus the east, right? China, Russia and other parts of the world where even Middle east is an example, where they're starting to move away from the dollar as a medium of exchange for oil and other like export import products. And so we're already starting to see some de risking happening from those countries. But interestingly, the USDC USDT is countering that with the growth of what people are doing every day. So it seems like even though the countries are starting to move away from it, it turns out the people still want access to the dollar. So although we're going to live in a multipolar world. And sure, you know, maybe US is plateauing in terms of power as you're mentioning. The plateauing could extend for another 10 to 20 years just because the dollar is becoming so accessible through USDC use.
01:18:08.979 - 01:18:09.715, Speaker A: USDT.
01:18:09.795 - 01:18:49.107, Speaker B: Have you ever seen a redalio chart? He plotted like seven different factors for every country, every major power. So for example education, economic power, military power and their national currency dominance and three other things. But these are just to give you an idea what some of the lines are on that chart. And it turns out that throughout the history the reserve currency tends to be a lagging indicator. Right. It's a result of a nation rising or falling. So education is the first thing actually education leads everything else.
01:18:49.107 - 01:19:37.323, Speaker B: Education leads economic power, leads military power, et cetera, et cetera. But all these things lead the reserve currency dominance or the status of the reserve currency. So the reserve currency, the US dollar, the reserve currency of the US dollar is actually the last thing to go. So even if a lot of people say the US is in late empire, so on and so forth, I would probably agree by the way, but let's say that's true. Even if that's true, the US dollar still has a long time to go. Right? And I don't think the reserve currency status of the US dollar will end anytime soon. This despite the effort of all the BRICS countries working together on creating new currencies.
01:19:37.323 - 01:19:40.975, Speaker B: And the stablecoins will probably extend that even further.
01:19:41.875 - 01:19:54.379, Speaker A: It's going to be fun to see how all of this plays out. So stablecoins is one real world assets. Just touching on that since it's. Unless you have something else to add.
01:19:54.467 - 01:20:05.345, Speaker B: Yeah, it's early, it's still early, but I would say it's, I wouldn't say it's one of the major trends in the first half of the year, but it's probably going to be one of the up and coming trends.
01:20:05.465 - 01:20:06.009, Speaker A: What is?
01:20:06.097 - 01:20:07.753, Speaker B: Sorry, the real world assets.
01:20:07.809 - 01:20:08.793, Speaker A: Yeah, okay, real world assets.
01:20:08.849 - 01:20:25.965, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean real world assets is a super set of stable coins. Like stable coins is a type of RWAs. Right. But specifically here we're talking about tokenized U.S. treasuries, tokenized U.S. stocks, U.S. real estate, et cetera, et cetera.
01:20:25.965 - 01:21:18.143, Speaker B: It's still early, but there's a strong reason like tokenized T bills has for me, they have proven product market fit easily because instead of holding the US dollar on chain, if you're not going to do anything with the US dollar, you might as well want to earn 5% on top of it. So I think like both the anecdotes and the data suggest that US T bills tokenized on chain are taking off. Especially with the likes of blackrock, Franklin Templeton, all these big tradfi players like launching their own T bill fund on chain. And then the next is probably going to be U.S. stocks and U.S. real estate. Some of the highest quality liquid or illiquid assets from the United States.
01:21:18.143 - 01:21:24.871, Speaker B: And basically the idea is to export them to the rest of the world through a global ledger.
01:21:25.063 - 01:21:52.919, Speaker A: What's interesting about this concept is that like an example, I've gone to Southeast Asia many times. I love the food there, the culture there. It turns out Malaysia as an example is like a primarily a Muslim country. So they can't like leverage trade or derive trade. They have to do things by the religion. But the way they get their yield because they can't like it's against a religion to borrow and do leverage trade. So that's kind of the concept.
01:21:52.919 - 01:22:31.897, Speaker A: So they have to get yield from some sort of like real sustainable way. And so the way they get their yield today is from just longing s p500. That's it. That's how, that's how they get their yield. And so they have these huge structured products that's only available to the ultra family, ultra high net worth or high net worth families. But everyday people really can't get access to this type of, this form of assets. And so if this was to become on chain and completely liquid and accessible via an app, you know, I could see these types of countries start to onboard retail to these types of asset classes, which is a very big enabler.
01:22:32.001 - 01:22:34.885, Speaker B: And there's what, like 2 billion at least Muslims.
01:22:35.005 - 01:22:48.741, Speaker A: 2 billion Muslims. That's just one market. I'm not even talking about India as an example, which is this, you know, 1.3 billion, you know, population. Is it 1.3 now or is it 2 billion? I don't even know.
01:22:48.813 - 01:22:49.522, Speaker B: 1.4.
01:22:49.679 - 01:22:51.749, Speaker A: 1.4. Yeah. 1.4.
01:22:51.837 - 01:23:06.761, Speaker B: I know your numbers better than you do. I know that because India just surpassed China. China is 1.4. India is like 1.4. Slightly higher. So India is now the world's most populous country.
01:23:06.953 - 01:23:21.525, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean I went there six months ago and like, it's insanity. Like my city went from like the small city to now, like if I want to get anywhere, it's going to take me an hour. It's insanity. It's insanity.
01:23:21.945 - 01:23:30.065, Speaker B: And also there's Russia and China. Citizens both want the U.S. assets.
01:23:30.225 - 01:23:30.753, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:23:30.849 - 01:23:55.285, Speaker B: And the reason for that is. Or it's a Little bit different for the two countries, but Russia is because they get sanctioned by the us. They want US assets, but they get sanctioned. And the way to solve that is put the assets on chain. As long as you have a way to get on chain, you would be able to get access to US assets through the tokenized versions of them. China is slightly different. China is because the government doesn't want you to.
01:23:55.285 - 01:24:22.611, Speaker B: It's capital control. They don't want you to. It's very hard to open a brokerage account that supports US stocks or Treasuries. And it turns out that it's easier for Chinese citizens to get on Binance to open a Binance account than to open a brokerage account for U.S. stocks. A lot of people actually don't know this on crypto. Twitter people think China banned crypto, blah, blah, blah.
01:24:22.611 - 01:24:32.131, Speaker B: But that's actually not true. It's. As a Chinese citizen, it's actually easier for a Chinese citizen to open a Binance account than it is for a US citizen to open a Binance account.
01:24:32.243 - 01:24:33.935, Speaker A: US is the problem here, guys.
01:24:35.115 - 01:24:53.909, Speaker B: So the point is, if you want to buy a high quality US based asset and currently you don't have access to it, as long as you can get on chain, you can, you can buy those US assets through the tokenized versions.
01:24:54.077 - 01:25:07.309, Speaker A: Isn't this another form of like the iron grip that the US is creating? Like the iron grip is through the dollar as an example, the iron grip through tokenized equities, tokenized real estate. Yep.
01:25:07.397 - 01:25:38.511, Speaker B: So I think the US government should be in full, full support of RWAs. Agree. It's exporting, exporting the best thing that the US has to the rest of the world, which is assets that go up only. If you look at the stock markets around the world, it's like they don't. Okay, so Europe has been flat for the last decade or two. Japan just had a lost decade or the last two decades, but it recently made all time high. China is flat.
01:25:38.511 - 01:26:07.335, Speaker B: So the Chinese stock market doesn't match the economic growth at all. The economy is up only and the stock market is down only. So around the world the stock markets don't do well compared to the US and the US Star market is one of the best things that the US has that you can export to the rest of the world through RWAs anyway. I think that's a small trend, but I think over the first half of the year, but it's probably up and coming.
01:26:07.755 - 01:26:19.083, Speaker A: This is going to take time, but it's also very interesting to see so We've talked about NFTs, we've talked about meme coins, RWAs AI.
01:26:19.219 - 01:26:47.535, Speaker B: I think there is also an overarching theme of their regulatory environment getting much more friendly over the last six months. So first of all, with the SEC approving the Ethereum etf, withdrawing their investigation into Ethereum as a security, getting sued left and right by crypto native organizations like Consensys and Trump supporting. Supporting crypto.
01:26:48.035 - 01:26:54.491, Speaker A: Actually today he's going to be probably headlining the bitcoin event in Miami that happens every year.
01:26:54.603 - 01:26:57.827, Speaker B: Like he's speaking there in person based.
01:26:57.851 - 01:27:03.815, Speaker A: On the news he is speaking there or he's in talks to speak there is what they said. That's insane.
01:27:04.555 - 01:27:28.073, Speaker B: The first half of the year we got two ETFs, we got the BTC ETF approved and trading in. Was it January, Jan or Feb? And then we just got the Ethereum etf. But interestingly, I was talking to, according to a pretty trusted source of mine who's close to one of the five, you know, there's five commissioner SEC commissioners.
01:27:28.219 - 01:27:32.437, Speaker A: Like the five Families in New York, right? The mob.
01:27:32.581 - 01:27:43.705, Speaker B: The mob that vote on approving or denying the ETFs. Gensler is one of them. He said that there won't be another ETF anytime soon.
01:27:44.125 - 01:27:45.945, Speaker A: So that catalyst is gone.
01:27:47.045 - 01:27:49.045, Speaker B: No more Doge etf, no more Doge.
01:27:49.085 - 01:27:52.597, Speaker A: No more Cultural Coin ETF and no.
01:27:52.621 - 01:27:54.791, Speaker B: Solana ETF anytime soon.
01:27:54.943 - 01:28:13.955, Speaker A: And maybe that could change in the next few years. But for now I think that, I think we have way too many ETFs anyways. BTC ETH. Good. Let's start with that. And once we get some, you know, once we get a good holding within the markets, then I think introducing more asset classes makes sense. More ETFs, I mean, makes sense.
01:28:14.975 - 01:28:31.286, Speaker B: So the impact of that is in the foreseeable future, BTC and ETH are going to be PvE and the rest of the crypto will be PvP.
01:28:31.479 - 01:28:35.011, Speaker A: PvE meaning player versus everyone versus player versus player.
01:28:35.123 - 01:28:37.227, Speaker B: Player versus. Yeah, player versus environment.
01:28:37.331 - 01:28:38.107, Speaker A: Player versus environment.
01:28:38.171 - 01:28:43.323, Speaker B: Yeah, because the environment in this case being the trifi flow.
01:28:43.379 - 01:29:09.867, Speaker A: Yeah. So it'll be very interesting to see how those, how the, you know, people are saying that, which I tend to agree with. The crypto markets are becoming much more mature and so we won't see the volatility that we have in the past or extreme volatility. Right. We'll see, we'll still get drawdowns, but probably won't be as extreme, at least for those two asset classes. For the rest probably so.
01:29:10.011 - 01:29:15.159, Speaker B: And we will see more dispersion among the assets.
01:29:15.327 - 01:29:16.791, Speaker A: I mean, we're already seeing dispersion.
01:29:16.863 - 01:29:32.391, Speaker B: We're already seeing dispersion, but the ETF will probably create even more dispersion because there's now two types of very different market participants, the traffi and the crypto natives, the casino and the Millennial casino and the Boomer casino.
01:29:32.503 - 01:30:14.331, Speaker A: Yeah, I think one's going to behave more like the stock market. The other could behave more secular in terms of where our sentiment is and how much liquidity is actually being inflowed. It'll be fun. What do you think? We haven't touched on this. I mean, we did sort of, but we talked a bit about the consumer markets and how we're obviously very bullish consumer and you know, we have a handful of consumer apps that came through our program. We've talked about Pump, we've talked about Fantasy Time and many others are coming down the pipeline. Where do you think we are in the launching of consumer apps? Are we in the MySpace era?
01:30:14.483 - 01:30:15.175, Speaker B: Probably.
01:30:15.995 - 01:30:45.631, Speaker A: I don't think, you know, we haven't. I don't think we've. We have seen yet like a Facebook like product. Even MySpace, we haven't seen that yet, but I think that's kind of where we're ramping up towards is one breakout app that is going to touch a lot of people. I mean, obviously you have Phantom, but I see it as more of a wallet. And primarily I think what people mostly do with Fantom is just go on Jupiter and trade shitcoins is what I see. So I do think there is a very big opportunity for a consumer app to really win here.
01:30:45.631 - 01:31:18.215, Speaker A: And we're talking a hundred million users. And my thesis is that the people the founders are going to build this are probably going to be less crypto native than we think. I think that to build a really good consumer app, you have to be more consumer than crypto, possibly the way I feel about this. And maybe we could talk about this, but you know, I feel as if the consumer. If you're more crypto native, then you get bogged down with crypto mentality, right? Oh, it needs to have this, this feature, that feature, that feature. And in actuality, it needs to be simple and dumb as possible.
01:31:18.635 - 01:31:40.425, Speaker B: I mean, again, arguably the consumer products are happening on top of stablecoins. Like there's a lot of really fast grown stablecoin apps that are built by normies that are just very knowledgeable about their local markets and they're not djins. By any means. And the product they build abstract away crypto completely.
01:31:42.085 - 01:32:28.287, Speaker A: Okay, so what's happening here is that we're starting to see some startups build on top of stable coins, right? But nothing break out yet. I haven't seen anything breaking out yet. We're seeing some breakneck speed growth. I think Go Bankless was one right in Africa as an example. But we haven't seen anything yet that's really amassed a lot of users. And so I do think, at least in the US I do think we'll see a consumer app that's going to go viral and everyone's going to download and use it and it's going to be primarily a tool to get access to sharecoins to start eventually then you could bake in other types of features and products to make it look more different than just a trading terminal. But to start, that's the wedge into the market.
01:32:28.287 - 01:32:51.235, Speaker A: There's about six startups that are building for this space already and they're all very Gen Z focused. Like it's, it's really interesting to see this space develop, but there's already like six or seven startups that are building a trading terminal but it's going to be more fun and social and, and I would say like the average TikTok user. So I do think we'll see something here soon.
01:32:51.395 - 01:33:39.587, Speaker B: The other day I made the comparison that crypto today is quite similar to Nvidia today or AI today, which is also very similar to the.com back in 2000s, which is that there is a lot of infra and there's a lot of infra that works, that is solving real problems and is attracting a lot of liquidity and investments. Right? So all the, in the last couple of years, layer ones, L2s attract a lot of liquidity investments and they work right. Same thing with Nvidia. Like Nvidia is now the most valuable company in the S&P 500, sucking all the liquidity into it. And their chips are amazing. And also back in 2000s during the dot com bubble, there was Cisco and Intel building infra.
01:33:39.587 - 01:34:22.115, Speaker B: But during all these three periods and verticals, there aren't that many good consumer apps to invest in yet. There is none. Right. Back in 2000, I guess Google was Google even born in 2000, Facebook was certainly not there today. AI apps, there aren't that many great consumer apps yet, although a lot of them are up and coming, they're growing, but none is mainstream. And same thing with crypto, crypto consumer apps, there's a Lot of consumer apps that are doing very well, but I wouldn't say they are mainstream yet. So I think we're at the same stage across these two different periods and verticals.
01:34:22.895 - 01:34:25.815, Speaker A: I agree with that by the way. I agree with that.
01:34:25.935 - 01:35:41.939, Speaker B: Right, so what happened during the 10 years, the decade post the dot com bubble, post the collapse of the dot com bubble was that there was a plethora of consumer applications, Internet consumer based applications that went to mainstream, Google, Facebook and so on and so forth that reached actually a billion users if not more during the decade post the collapse. So it took a decade for the whole Internet quote unquote Internet industry to go from all in on infra to all in on apps. And it also turns out that once the apps reach the mainstream they accrue more value than the infra layer. If you think about on the most valuable companies, Internet companies, it's Facebook, Google, the stuff that's consumer facing rather than Cisco or Intel. And in hindsight it's not surprising if you own the end users bargaining power against the rest of the supply chain and you can increase those value. And I think the similar thing will happen to Nvidia to the AI space today and crypto space today. So in the coming years there's going to be more and more AI based consumer applications.
01:35:41.939 - 01:36:04.335, Speaker B: It might take five to 10 years, I don't know, I don't know how long it's going to take. But there will be AI based consumer applications that will end up accruing more value than Nvidia or AI chip designers or manufacturers like tsm. And there will be crypto based consumer applications that reach the mainstream that will accrue more value than their underlying layer ones or L2s.
01:36:04.455 - 01:36:48.695, Speaker A: We're already seeing that. I mean even if you think about what I mean by accruing value, you know we talked about, I put a tweet out a couple months ago that said, you know, the fat protocol thesis is dead and we're starting to see some days where pumpkin that fun ended up making more money than L2s as an example and one time surpassed Solana. And Anatoly tweeted out when people are talking shit as usual, Anatoly is like this is exactly what I want. I want apps to create more value for users and for themselves as a way to show that they have product market fit and growth. And so what you're saying is absolutely true, which is we're going to, we need to see apps that are accruing more value than, than the income or the Layer one, L2s are space. They should become commoditized.
01:36:49.035 - 01:36:56.499, Speaker B: I'm pretty sure that is what's going to happen. The only question in my mind is, is it going to take two years or five years or 10 years?
01:36:56.627 - 01:37:08.323, Speaker A: Yeah. You know, crypto is reflexive and things that may take a few years will usually happen in a year or less. Right. Like that's just the way it plays out every time.
01:37:08.419 - 01:37:28.763, Speaker B: Yeah, like things do get faster and faster. Like it took the Internet maybe 10 years to go from infra dominated to app dominated. For crypto, it might take five years. Like technology just gets better and developers work faster. Consumers are more open to new ideas because of social media. They all tell each other about new products, et cetera, et cetera.
01:37:28.819 - 01:37:47.573, Speaker A: So there's this concept of a 30 year paradigm shift. Right. Where you know, like the Internet takes 30 years to mature. Right. As an example, I forgot where I read it. I read it in one of the books, but I'll find out in a second. But so let's say that crypto entered into existence 2008, 2009.
01:37:47.573 - 01:38:26.875, Speaker A: And so the first 10 years was primarily infra driven. Right. The next 10 years should be some sort of application driven. And then the last 10 years is really where the maturity happens and we start to see real full scale world apps. And so like the Internet as an example, the second decade was where Google was born, where Facebook was born, and all of these like large incumbents that we see today were born. And so it would be interesting to see even in the hardware, if you look at like the computer industry, hardware, hard, like hardware in the 50s, you know, 30 years of growth there. And now we have some winners like Dell and Compaq or whatever.
01:38:26.875 - 01:38:28.235, Speaker A: Not Compaq, but Dell and Dell.
01:38:28.275 - 01:38:28.667, Speaker B: Compa.
01:38:28.731 - 01:38:40.503, Speaker A: Compa acquired by Dell or some shit like that. But yeah, so you have these hardware or Lenovo. Right. So you have the hard. Where now they're commoditized business. Right. Like the airline industry software.
01:38:40.503 - 01:38:51.119, Speaker A: Right. You kind of have that already with Microsoft and others, but you know, there's a wedge with cloud and et cetera. So I feel as if this is kind of where we are in the space. Very early days though. What was that?
01:38:51.167 - 01:38:53.919, Speaker B: I think that the 30 year paradigm gets shorter and shorter.
01:38:54.007 - 01:38:56.875, Speaker A: Shorter, yeah. And why do you think that way?
01:38:58.215 - 01:39:32.615, Speaker B: It seems to me that all the S curves, like the adoption curve, all the new technologies over the last hundred years become shorter and shorter. Empirically that's true. But also theoretically that makes sense because, you know, new technologies enable People to work faster. Like ChatGPT enabled developers to build faster. And then there's social media that helps, you know, products go viral more quickly, information flows more freely. People are more open minded to new products, new technologies because of social media. So the whole S curve just gets more squeezed, smaller and smaller.
01:39:32.615 - 01:39:39.231, Speaker B: Things become. Things go get to full adoption mainstream, faster and faster.
01:39:39.383 - 01:39:40.075, Speaker A: Cool.
01:39:40.735 - 01:39:41.919, Speaker B: Any predictions?
01:39:42.087 - 01:39:47.575, Speaker A: Well, for the rest of the year, I am going to. Well, we didn't even talk about ton yet. Telegram.
01:39:47.655 - 01:39:52.967, Speaker B: Oh yeah, Ton. Yeah. Ton is actually a big theme for the first half of the year.
01:39:53.031 - 01:40:02.155, Speaker A: Yeah. Turns out it's becoming. Yeah. I mean like Pantera as an example is launching a whole second fund just to invest in tonight.
01:40:02.185 - 01:40:02.631, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:40:02.743 - 01:40:15.447, Speaker A: And so ton is becoming very big. We've had some internal breakout apps already. Ciao. Right. I mean the thesis is very simple, right. A billion users on Telegram. We've seen successes like WeChat in China as an example.
01:40:15.447 - 01:40:28.445, Speaker A: We're seeing this with like WhatsApp in South America. And the user base, Interestingly, I looked at some numbers, high level. Turns out the largest one of the large demographics on Telegram is India.
01:40:28.565 - 01:40:29.317, Speaker B: Oh really?
01:40:29.461 - 01:40:31.421, Speaker A: Well, 150 million people, which is.
01:40:31.533 - 01:40:32.053, Speaker B: Okay.
01:40:32.149 - 01:40:33.425, Speaker A: It's a sizable number.
01:40:34.045 - 01:40:51.157, Speaker B: The CI. I also did some research the CIS. So basically the former Soviet Union, et cetera. It's about 250 million users on Telegram. 200 million users on Telegram. But obviously that's many different countries.
01:40:51.301 - 01:41:14.247, Speaker A: Yeah. And there was like maybe 30 to 40 million Americans around there. So. Yeah, so there's a lot. I mean there's a billion users. Crypto native only crypto native messaging app where you can use the ton network, which is a sharded layer one and anyone can build an app and get instant distribution based on chat. And we've seen recently Hamster Combat.
01:41:14.351 - 01:41:16.555, Speaker B: Hamster. Well, yeah, there are several apps.
01:41:16.935 - 01:41:21.945, Speaker A: Hamster Combat, 100 million users. Katazen Catizen.
01:41:22.105 - 01:41:23.273, Speaker B: Not Coin.
01:41:23.449 - 01:41:27.097, Speaker A: Not Coin, which is part of the Telegram ecosystem.
01:41:27.161 - 01:41:28.553, Speaker B: Yeah. And a few others.
01:41:28.729 - 01:41:47.905, Speaker A: But for it's funny because we were talking, you and I diligence the founder and he launched. I forgot what the fantasy app. I mean, how many daily active users do you have? Like, oh, 14,000. I'm like 14,000. That's not. I'm like, wow, that's not. I mean you don't hear those numbers every day in crypto.
01:41:47.905 - 01:42:19.367, Speaker A: Right, right. And so for him to just say that passively tells me a few things, which is like getting distribution is very easy. You can find product market fit pretty quickly. But you also have to figure out like, is it really the product or are you just being farmed? And so I got some interesting insights from a lot of people that are building in this ecosystem. One interesting insight is that the majority of demographics, demographic that's using the product are from low income areas. Very, very low income areas. So for them to tap a hamster.
01:42:19.471 - 01:42:20.439, Speaker B: Clicking games.
01:42:20.567 - 01:42:30.183, Speaker A: The clicking game. So I sent you a viral video, someone from Vietnam or something where the guy was giving someone a haircut. And while he was giving him a haircut, he was just tapping the phone.
01:42:30.279 - 01:42:30.911, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:42:31.063 - 01:42:53.451, Speaker A: Like, while he was cutting someone's hair. It was weird. One time, one hand, like he was like cutting and like, and then tapping, holding the head with the. And he was like. There was another one where somebody. It was like, you could tell it was in like some like factory where they were making clothes. And the, the, the sewing machine, you know how it taps as you're like making the incision.
01:42:53.451 - 01:43:10.071, Speaker A: And so they put the phone next to the sewing machine and every time you hit the, every time you're sewing, it starts tapping really fast. Did you see that I sent you? I don't know if I sent it to you, but they're finding ways to hack this and make this like, so they can earn money.
01:43:10.163 - 01:43:26.591, Speaker B: Yeah. So, okay, so. So these apps have like millions of tens of millions of users, if not hundreds, which is really crazy. And that is given that. That is on top of the fact that those apps are really stupid.
01:43:26.743 - 01:43:31.151, Speaker A: Yeah, they are. Yeah. And they're Meme Maps. I would consider them as Meme Maps.
01:43:31.183 - 01:44:00.905, Speaker B: Meme Maps, Yeah. And on top of the fact that the developer experience today is really, really bad. So I learned this from a couple of founders where building on top of ton, apparently it's really, really hard to build on top of ton for a couple of reasons. One is TON supports a couple of languages that are just unique to ton and the vast majority of developers are not familiar with those languages. One of them is similar to Solidity, but it's different. It's high level language. Another one is super low level.
01:44:00.905 - 01:44:33.815, Speaker B: It's like on the same level of abstraction as C, different syntax. And so developers are not used to these two languages, so they would have to learn a new language in order to build on top of ton. So that makes it really hard for developer adoption. And the other thing is apparently it's really hard to execute transactions in parallel. I don't know why that is the case. Apparently you cannot send transactions or execute transactions. You cannot execute more than one transaction per block, which is like it doesn't make sense to me.
01:44:33.815 - 01:45:20.375, Speaker B: But that is happening today with one of the founders building an app on top of Ton. And on top of that you need to wait for the block confirmation, like several blocks to confirm the transaction before you can send a new transaction. So the result is they cannot execute more than one transaction per minute, which is really absurd. But I think there's probably ways around this. And I don't understand exactly why that is the case, but my high level understanding is that ton is not optimized for complex smart contract transactions. It's optimized for payments. So they really designed ton as a payment based blockchain payment friendly blockchain payment first, payment first.
01:45:20.375 - 01:45:41.377, Speaker B: And so anyway, so right now Ton is really hard to develop for complex smart contracts. That might change in the future. But my point is Ton is not a very developer friendly blockchain today. And despite that, there's apps on top of ton that have tens of millions of data active users and that tells you everything you need to know about distribution.
01:45:41.561 - 01:46:07.841, Speaker A: So Ton has distribution, they have a platform where they can help app developers get users. But their infra isn't as optimized as say Solana as an example. So there are trade offs and it's expensive, right? I think one of our founders was actually venting to us and he said like it's actually really expensive for people to use the product. It's like what, 10 cents a transaction or.
01:46:07.873 - 01:46:24.495, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, it's like sometimes it's. It could be 50 cents but anyways, it's like one or two orders magnitude more expensive than Salana and the Ethereum L2s. And again, that goes back to the point about tan not being optimized for complex smart contract transactions.
01:46:24.535 - 01:46:33.831, Speaker A: So to me it seems like a lot of things could happen off chain via a centralized server and really just a settlement could happen on tan in itself. Yeah.
01:46:33.863 - 01:46:36.143, Speaker B: There could be L2s on top of ton, for example.
01:46:36.199 - 01:46:51.793, Speaker A: Oh God. There are other L2s. We talked to a few already if you remember. Rip. Cool. I think, I think that's some of it. I don't think we've covered it all, but I think some of the major themes we covered.
01:46:51.793 - 01:47:04.657, Speaker A: I just went on Twitter just a second ago and it looks like people are calling it at bottom CL said local bottom ansem has the dragon Ball Z gif up.
01:47:04.801 - 01:47:13.755, Speaker B: That's warming up that cat bounce to 63 maybe. And then you think so down only to low 50s.
01:47:13.875 - 01:47:16.163, Speaker A: Are you becoming trading a done alt?
01:47:16.299 - 01:47:18.075, Speaker B: I'm slowly.
01:47:18.155 - 01:47:19.851, Speaker A: Oh shit. We hit 59. 7.
01:47:20.003 - 01:47:24.275, Speaker B: Interestingly, Bitcoin is down more than alts. Than most alts.
01:47:24.435 - 01:47:25.291, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:47:25.483 - 01:47:34.605, Speaker B: And that could be related to, I don't know, Germany government selling bitcoin. Bitcoin, yeah.
01:47:34.725 - 01:47:36.141, Speaker A: That and the Mount Gox.
01:47:36.293 - 01:47:51.093, Speaker B: And Mount Gox. Anyway, my prediction is we'll be higher. We'll be, in fact, breaking all time high again by the end of the year. So up only up. Only over the time horizon of six months.
01:47:51.269 - 01:48:04.265, Speaker A: So just for listeners that are in the trenches every day in the pump fun trenches, I'm speaking to you. Don't worry, it will be all right in the next few months. Just got to hold strong.
01:48:04.385 - 01:48:13.105, Speaker B: Oh. However, I do think meme coins could. Like, if meme coins may not come back, some of the meme coins, the on chain ones may not come back.
01:48:13.185 - 01:48:21.521, Speaker A: All right, so let's have fun with this. Which ones would you put a prediction on that won't come back? We'll just talk about some popular ones. Say whiff.
01:48:21.673 - 01:48:23.961, Speaker B: WIF is not on chain anymore. WIF is actually on binance.
01:48:23.993 - 01:48:25.689, Speaker A: Oh, that's right. So you're talking on chain on.
01:48:25.737 - 01:48:33.107, Speaker B: I'm talking about on chain. Like the ones on Binance, they'll probably come back, but on chain ones, they could be dead for good.
01:48:33.251 - 01:48:48.755, Speaker A: Well, I think many of them, there's just too much attention. Right. And so it's very hard to bring that tension back unless there's someone that is the. What I call the drummer for each of these memes.
01:48:48.915 - 01:48:51.035, Speaker B: The leader. The leader. The cult leader.
01:48:51.155 - 01:48:55.385, Speaker A: The cult leader. And if there isn't a cult leader behind your memes, then you'd probably want to.
01:48:55.555 - 01:48:56.045, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:48:56.125 - 01:48:57.065, Speaker A: Not be there.
01:48:57.845 - 01:49:02.917, Speaker B: Did Andrew Tate's daddy or his daddy coin go to zero yet?
01:49:03.021 - 01:49:06.805, Speaker A: I'm waiting for that one to go to zero. I haven't seen it go to zero yet.
01:49:06.925 - 01:49:08.421, Speaker B: Oh, it bounced back a little bit.
01:49:08.533 - 01:49:14.741, Speaker A: Oh, he tweeted something the other day, I think. Really? $76 million. FTV still.
01:49:14.893 - 01:49:15.533, Speaker B: Wow.
01:49:15.669 - 01:49:30.831, Speaker A: Still surprised. I thought it was going to be at zero. Mother is at 60 million. She's still. She's finding more utility stuff like that. I think the celeb coins that have a leader that's attached to them and they're still giving it attention. Will not go away.
01:49:30.831 - 01:49:40.995, Speaker A: There's a new meme called Billy that is apparently becoming a thing, but outside of that, nothing really interesting that I'm seeing.
01:49:41.615 - 01:49:46.223, Speaker B: I was telling you earlier how I discovered Haktua.
01:49:46.359 - 01:49:47.675, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, Tell me the story.
01:49:47.815 - 01:50:24.871, Speaker B: So I was. I actually discovered how to. The latest meme of The Internet hagtua on. I actually discovered it on Deck Screener first because I was on Deck Screener the other day and I saw hock to what the hell is it? And then I went on TikTok and searched for hagtua and then I saw the meme, the bunch of videos and now my entire TikTok feed is like just automatically pushing the hagtua memes to me. The videos to me. But anyway, my point being, I actually discovered a new Internet subculture on dexscreener before on TikTok. And I spent more time on TikTok than on dexscreener.
01:50:25.023 - 01:50:29.875, Speaker A: Sure. Interesting. So meme coins has a trending.
01:50:30.215 - 01:50:33.623, Speaker B: Meme coins as a discovery tool for Internet culture.
01:50:33.759 - 01:50:44.737, Speaker A: Yeah, I could buy that. Hocktua was. Yeah. Now it's at. Wait, is that the. Oh, wow. I was trying to see hawk.
01:50:44.737 - 01:51:15.155, Speaker A: Oh, down 99%. Is that the right one? Oh, here's the right one. Oh, no, it's at 3.9 million and it was launched on Pump, so the one that got popular. So pump is the meta aggregator where it aggregates attention and trends and then it launches to the market. So it's really pumped. That's the trend, et cetera.
01:51:15.155 - 01:51:34.567, Speaker A: Interesting. All right, so predictions for the future was our next. I'll give you mine. I am going to continue doubling down on the idea of consumer apps that go viral. We will see an app that will hit within the next 12 months to 24 months. 100 million users.
01:51:34.671 - 01:51:37.823, Speaker B: If I was you don't think Pump already has 100 million users?
01:51:37.959 - 01:51:43.015, Speaker A: Pump, yeah, pump has I think 60,000 daily active users today.
01:51:43.095 - 01:51:46.871, Speaker B: But combined. Combined, because Pump turns a lot.
01:51:46.983 - 01:51:55.471, Speaker A: They turn a lot. Yeah. They have a high churn rate. Right. But right now they have 60,000 and growing steadily.
01:51:55.623 - 01:52:03.497, Speaker B: I think that's lifetime number of users on Pump might be like order of magnitude between 1 and 10 million.
01:52:03.641 - 01:52:06.805, Speaker A: Sure. Over time. Yeah. Cumulative, right? Yeah.
01:52:07.145 - 01:52:09.209, Speaker B: Unique. Unique. Because they turn.
01:52:09.337 - 01:52:12.697, Speaker A: Yeah. But if you. In aggregate. In aggregate, yeah, that's what I mean.
01:52:12.721 - 01:52:14.625, Speaker B: Aggregate, unique users, lifetime.
01:52:14.785 - 01:52:16.305, Speaker A: Sure, that I can believe.
01:52:16.425 - 01:52:18.845, Speaker B: What else? Any other predictions?
01:52:19.625 - 01:52:22.045, Speaker A: I'm just picking one. I'm going to stick with one.
01:52:22.545 - 01:52:26.603, Speaker B: What do you think of the Airdrop meta? Is it the end?
01:52:26.739 - 01:53:17.363, Speaker A: No, I think it's the beginning. Look, I put it to put a tweet out, but pretty much like the airdrop meta for no contingencies is out now there's going to be contingencies such as vesting. So blast is an example, is a great example where part of their airdrop is vested. So that's like one example. And you could provide liquidity and vest faster as an example or something like that. I forgot exact mechanics, but pretty much what it makes you do is all right, you're getting this airdrop, it's allocated to you, but you need to do some work to redeem that airdrop or you need to do something of value that is productive for the chain itself.
01:53:17.459 - 01:53:21.795, Speaker B: So layer zero asked the airdrop farmers to pay like 10 cents or something.
01:53:21.915 - 01:53:22.763, Speaker A: A donation?
01:53:22.899 - 01:53:23.795, Speaker B: A donation, yeah.
01:53:23.835 - 01:54:03.819, Speaker A: I think layerzero did everything wrong if you ask me. There's a process of educating and getting feedback from users or letting the users know beforehand. I mean not just layerzero but everyone, Many, many startups have done this in the wrong fashion. Even if you look at Eigenlayer, the concept of this derivative token that just sits and unlocks over time, release it to the public first, let them know what's coming so that way there isn't a negative reaction to it versus just launching it. I do think there is a, there is an opportunity to educate. So going back to Layer zero as an example, Layer zero did two things. One is like they kind of went after like civil clusters.
01:54:03.819 - 01:54:45.623, Speaker A: So they did this by like, hey, if you know a civil cluster, let them know, let us know and we will tag them and you get something in return or something like that. So pretty much it was like a snitching network. Pretty much they built a snitching network and this network enabled them to identify large, large clusters, which is fine. And so a lot of like commercialized farming networks were shot over time. A lot of civilians got shot too, but that's the separate story. And then the second thing is this airdrop meta that you mentioned, which is like if you want to redeem then you have to donate 10 cents to. It was a builder's fund or some coalition of, of developers or something on Ethereum.
01:54:45.623 - 01:54:54.191, Speaker A: I forgot what it was, but that was the other one. And they were going to match the donation up to 10 million or something. And so people really were turned off by that.
01:54:54.303 - 01:55:26.289, Speaker B: Again, there's a lot of discourse on why this is the end of airdrops. And one of the arguments is that there's actually no incentive alignment between the airdrop and long term usage. Farmers are not long term users. They will exit the market immediately upon receiving the airdrop. So I mean, that's sort of the argument. But the real reason there is a state, again, there is a state of reason. There is a real reason.
01:55:26.289 - 01:55:31.353, Speaker B: The real reason for airdrops is Actually creating liquidity on day one.
01:55:31.489 - 01:55:32.049, Speaker A: Sure.
01:55:32.177 - 01:56:04.467, Speaker B: Because in order to create a liquid market, you have to distribute the token widely to a wide audience and airdrops happens to be the easiest way to do that from a legal point of view. Because if you think about it, what is the alternative to create a liquid market on day one or what's an alternative? In other words, what's an alternative to distribute the tokens widely? It's through a token sale. But token sales are today very risky to do. From a legal point of view, much more risky than airdrops.
01:56:04.571 - 01:56:04.937, Speaker A: So.
01:56:05.011 - 01:56:18.005, Speaker B: So until ICOS and crowdsale, until that mechanic comes back, I do agree with you that airdrops are here to stay. I don't see any other alternative. It's between airdrops or crowdsale.
01:56:18.125 - 01:56:44.745, Speaker A: Yeah, 100% agree. I think it's just going to become more productive and what's going to happen is that people are going to have to spend more time on these apps and be converted into users. That's it. We're in the process of being converted into long term users and it's going to happen in some shape or form and it's essentially, you know, it's investing in a startup but you know, like you're investing your attention into it for a longer period of time. That's all it is right now. It's like easily farmable. Right.
01:56:44.745 - 01:57:09.635, Speaker A: Like you could do like, I don't know, there was like a list of like 25 protocols that were launching layer ones and apps and everybody could farm them. Right. You could farm all 25. You could do this full time. Over time I think it's just going to become harder and harder for people to mass farm all of these products and you're going to be focused on very few and that is where you're going to spend a lot of your time and attention. Even if you look at Fantasy Top as an example, that's where I spend a lot of my time now. Right.
01:57:09.635 - 01:57:33.173, Speaker A: Because you know like one, obviously there's a lot of great players are playing a lot of great game mechanics and I'm earning a lot of points. So now I have like maybe two to five, like two to four apps that I use daily that I just use because I like the products and then I'm farming it. And I think that's probably what's going to kind of emerge out of this whole commercialized farming ponzi that we've created.
01:57:33.349 - 01:57:36.933, Speaker B: The industrial farmers, the industrial farms.
01:57:37.069 - 01:57:39.109, Speaker A: I think industrial farming is. That is where I'm at.
01:57:39.197 - 01:57:51.917, Speaker B: Yeah. No That I agree with you. It seems like industrial farming has seen far lower returns than it used to. So there's this guy on Twitter who tweeted about how he farmed Zksync by.
01:57:51.981 - 01:58:02.009, Speaker A: Yeah, they didn't even care. They just like give it to everyone. All the clusters that farmed on layer zero, they all ended up, not all, but most of them ended up getting the ZK sync. Airdrop.
01:58:02.137 - 01:58:38.893, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay, so this guy, he spin up 350 IP addresses with unique caches and cookies and RPCs and VPNs and hosting a bunch of AI tools, days and days of coding in order to learn those bots to act like real humans. So he actually wanted the bots to look to act like real humans rather than like AI. And he spent 30 ETH on fees, $21,000 on the whole infra 200 ETH for liquidity pool for bots and blah blah blah. That's a lot of investment. And he ended up earning 18,000 ZK tokens.
01:58:39.069 - 01:58:42.145, Speaker A: And the ZK tokens, what is that worth now?
01:58:43.485 - 01:59:05.935, Speaker B: 18,000 units of ZK tokens. And each ZK token is worth 16 cents. And so he made $3,000 on an investment of 10 times bigger. So very bad return. And ZK sink is like the opening price. Opening FDV is not even that bad. It's like 3 billion.
01:59:05.935 - 01:59:27.589, Speaker B: I mean it's not crazy, but it's not bad. But yeah, it's possible that industrial farming. Well, I don't really know. I feel like it's an arms race between industrial farming and all the anti sybil measures that the project is doing. They're all trying to get ahead of each other. It's like an AI Deeplake arms race. Right.
01:59:27.589 - 01:59:42.981, Speaker B: The AI deepfakes are getting better and better and the AI deepfake detections are getting better and better as well. They try to front run each other. It's a risk to the bottom I feel like. Could be the same thing for airdrops. Industrial airdrop farming.
01:59:43.133 - 01:59:55.949, Speaker A: Well, I mean apps and protocols will have to figure out how to use their equity productively. Right, Their tokens productively. If you're giving it to people that aren't going to convert to long term users, then what's the point? There's no point.
01:59:56.037 - 02:00:04.541, Speaker B: Well again, I mean the state is to convert users, but the real reason is to create day one liquidity.
02:00:04.733 - 02:00:46.327, Speaker A: So wouldn't a perfect role would be a day one liquidity in all unique users? That would be obviously the perfect scenario. Right, right, sure. So that's the scenario that I'm talking about is this, you know, getting, you know, x amount of users but then also making sure that they actually use the app versus just being dumped on. Yeah, that's what, that's what I mean. And I think there's a perfect world where that happens. But it just, you know, I think it has to be done in a way that enables better kind of measures and who they give to airdrops to users. So starkware did this pretty interestingly, which is they airdropped to developers as an example.
02:00:46.327 - 02:01:03.911, Speaker A: I felt like Celestia did this really well as well, where they just gave it to developers and all the people that are very important for Celestia's ecosystem. I do think there is a way to do this, but it just depends on how much the founders care about it.
02:01:03.983 - 02:01:14.515, Speaker B: Okay, so prediction is airdrops are here to stay, but industrial airdrop farming might come to an end. Any other predictions?
02:01:15.455 - 02:01:32.563, Speaker A: I think I'm going to stick to just the consumer. I'm going to stick to my one consumer app. Consumer app. Oh, here's a fun one. Maybe prediction. Mark, there will be an upstart, a startup that will dethrone Polymarket.
02:01:32.659 - 02:01:34.283, Speaker B: Do you think that'll happen on Solana?
02:01:34.419 - 02:01:34.859, Speaker A: Sure.
02:01:34.947 - 02:01:41.331, Speaker B: Because there's no, at least no big competitor to Polymarket and Solana that I know of.
02:01:41.443 - 02:01:49.015, Speaker A: But it will look very different than Polymarket. We won't say how, but there will be because I think there are many ways that could happen. Right.
02:01:49.915 - 02:01:57.367, Speaker B: Anything else? I can't think of anything else. Do you think? Okay, so here's a fun one. Go ahead.
02:01:57.391 - 02:01:58.555, Speaker A: Okay, go ahead, go ahead.
02:01:58.935 - 02:02:06.295, Speaker B: There's people saying if Solana could dethrone Ethereum, White can't taun.
02:02:06.455 - 02:02:07.155, Speaker A: Yes.
02:02:07.975 - 02:02:11.343, Speaker B: I mean, on the surface I'm open to the possibility.
02:02:11.519 - 02:02:12.119, Speaker A: Sure.
02:02:12.247 - 02:02:36.385, Speaker B: I don't see that in the data yet. On the other hand, I don't see the data between. I don't see ton dethroning Solana in the data, but I see Solana dethrone Ethereum potentially in the data. Like on many metrics, Solana is approaching Ethereum much, much faster than the price is relative to eth.
02:02:37.365 - 02:02:52.729, Speaker A: I don't know to me. So I agree. I think there is a possibility for Solana to compete against Ethereum one on one and that seems more plausible to me tan network. There's some challenges there that I see. We've just Talked about fees is 1.
02:02:52.857 - 02:02:53.889, Speaker B: The developer experience.
02:02:53.977 - 02:03:22.821, Speaker A: The developer experience is 2, 3. I do think that maybe it's just me, but I Think the market is getting way ahead of itself. It's just like, oh, ton, the token or just ton. Sure, the token. You know, like Pantera starting a second fund as an example just to buy ton. To me, I feel as if the market is getting way too head. And then after seeing the quality of developers, I feel like we need one phase to go and for the second phase to come in for us to see some real good.
02:03:22.893 - 02:03:30.745, Speaker B: Like, I. Yeah, I don't think ton is this cycle thing. It's. Yeah, if it's a thing, it's the next. It's a next cycle thing.
02:03:31.125 - 02:03:37.581, Speaker A: I think they need one. They need one cycle to learn. They need one cycle to learn, one.
02:03:37.613 - 02:03:45.661, Speaker B: Cycle to prove the resilience of the developers. And that's what salon did this cycle and that's what Ethereum did last cycle.
02:03:45.773 - 02:04:14.463, Speaker A: And so between the language that they use, the chain being more optimized for payments, they have a sharded layer one. Right. As an example. And so I do feel like if the apps are becoming successful on ton, it's primarily going to be just off chain apps. I don't know if I'll see a lot of. We probably won't see a lot of on chain stuff, but probably mostly off chain stuff. So then you're thinking just like mini apps like WeChat as an example.
02:04:14.463 - 02:04:17.095, Speaker A: But then why do you need crypto for? That is the example.
02:04:17.255 - 02:04:19.543, Speaker B: Oh, we haven't talked about deep end.
02:04:19.559 - 02:04:34.999, Speaker A: Oh, wait, wait, let's talk about deep end. But I also want to highlight what you just said earlier. Donald just tweeted. The altcoin strength here is considerable. It seems to me like a bet on the range being reclaimed somewhat holding. If that doesn't happen. Motherfucker.
02:04:34.999 - 02:04:48.485, Speaker A: If that doesn't happen. I think all's positions are very out of position. If it does hold, that'll be the bottom for alts for a while. People betting high stakes. We need to invite Donald to our podcast. I feel like we talk about him so much.
02:04:49.265 - 02:04:53.689, Speaker B: Wait, so instructions unclear? Is he bullish or bearish? Up or down?
02:04:53.857 - 02:04:59.177, Speaker A: So what he's saying is if it does hold, that's the bottom. If it doesn't hold, then it's done.
02:04:59.321 - 02:05:01.329, Speaker B: Well, no fucking shit. By definition.
02:05:01.497 - 02:05:02.285, Speaker A: Yeah.
02:05:04.545 - 02:05:07.545, Speaker B: If it doesn't hold, it's not the bottom.
02:05:08.765 - 02:05:14.733, Speaker A: People betting high stakes. So go ahead, deepen. Wait, before. Let me go. I'm gonna hit the bathroom real quick.
02:05:14.789 - 02:05:16.989, Speaker B: Oh my God. Fucking boomer bro.
02:05:17.037 - 02:05:25.085, Speaker A: We've been on the call for two hours. I drink two bottles of water. Do you Drink water at all when you do a podcast?
02:05:25.165 - 02:05:27.781, Speaker B: Yeah, I drank water. I would drink whole bottled water.
02:05:27.933 - 02:05:29.237, Speaker A: Yeah. How many bottles?
02:05:29.381 - 02:05:30.541, Speaker B: Like one big cup.
02:05:30.653 - 02:05:32.579, Speaker A: Looks like a coffee cup to me.
02:05:32.677 - 02:05:54.235, Speaker B: The big one, though. All right, go, go, go, go. So depend. We get probably a deep end startup pitch at least once every other day now. And the valuations are ridiculous. Pretty absurd. Similar order of magnitude as AI.
02:05:54.235 - 02:06:20.785, Speaker B: What's happening? I feel like, okay, I think Helium is the OG here. I think Helium has proven that using crypto native. Using crypto token incentives can in fact help install a new infrastructure. So tokens are extremely powerful incentives to help install new infrastructure. But I don't think Helium is entirely proven yet. I think for the most part Helium.
02:06:20.945 - 02:06:24.845, Speaker A: Helium is proven. Helium is proven at least what they're building.
02:06:25.385 - 02:06:27.521, Speaker B: I don't think the demand side is proven yet.
02:06:27.593 - 02:06:32.017, Speaker A: It is. I switched over to Helium phone service.
02:06:32.161 - 02:06:33.265, Speaker B: Wait, so you're.
02:06:33.425 - 02:06:39.473, Speaker A: Yeah, so my family's account, we switched to Helium because it was so cheap by default.
02:06:39.569 - 02:06:41.681, Speaker B: Like most of the time you're using.
02:06:41.713 - 02:06:46.537, Speaker A: Mvno, which is a T mobile network, but it's a blended network of Helium and mvno.
02:06:46.601 - 02:06:52.143, Speaker B: Right. So wherever there's no T mobile coverage, you fall back onto Helium.
02:06:52.289 - 02:06:53.851, Speaker A: Or vice versa. Right, or vice versa.
02:06:53.883 - 02:06:54.211, Speaker B: Yeah.
02:06:54.283 - 02:07:24.111, Speaker A: Yeah. So and that's the demand side. And. And if you look at like I did a huge search, I mean, pretty much US search of all the best mobile providers and services and compared price and cost, Helium comes out the cheapest. Helium Mobile comes out the cheapest and the best service. And on top of that, we're earning tokens. And so every day we go like, I mean, I'm not saying we do this every day, but you know, you have different quadrants, you go to different quadrants and using the service and you start to mine tokens.
02:07:24.111 - 02:07:35.919, Speaker A: And so on average, the tokens that I'm getting pay for my bill. So it's $20 a month for the service, and then the tokens I get generally between like 17 and $20.
02:07:36.007 - 02:07:38.255, Speaker B: Wait, but you earn tokens by doing what?
02:07:38.375 - 02:07:44.987, Speaker A: Just using the phone service. Oh, sorry. Phone service and location. You have to turn your location on, so it mines your location data.
02:07:45.151 - 02:07:46.083, Speaker B: Interesting.
02:07:46.259 - 02:07:49.979, Speaker A: So I don't know what they're doing exactly with the location data, but you.
02:07:49.987 - 02:07:54.195, Speaker B: Could probably assume, huh, you don't mind selling your data, selling your privacy for something.
02:07:54.235 - 02:08:31.721, Speaker A: We're already doing that. Well, I did it partly one, because I want to use a product and I want to feel like, you know, what people go through. And for the, for me, like Sure, I am, you know, skeptical on sharing my info, but the average person would do it in a heartbeat. If they get free phone service, they'll do it in a heartbeat. They already shared their data with Facebook and everyone else, so why not? So, yeah. So Helium is an example where I think it's actually working, but that's probably the only deep end project that I've seen that to me has found product market fit the right way.
02:08:31.833 - 02:08:34.793, Speaker B: Do you know how many people are on the heating plan?
02:08:34.969 - 02:08:45.395, Speaker A: I actually did this research the other day. I don't. How many? Hold on. ChatGPT. 62,000 subscribers.
02:08:45.555 - 02:08:46.363, Speaker B: Say that again.
02:08:46.499 - 02:08:53.323, Speaker A: 62,000 subscribers. Okay, so annual run rate of $15 million in contracts, but a lot of.
02:08:53.339 - 02:08:56.035, Speaker B: That goes to probably Team B and O.
02:08:56.155 - 02:09:17.375, Speaker A: Sure. But this is going to take time. Right? This is not something that happens overnight. But they launched this less than a year ago. I went through the whole onboarding experience, the customer service. I have to say it was great. I had some issues with activating my SIM card, and so it's very different than using Verizon or AT&T where you had to call them.
02:09:17.375 - 02:09:27.295, Speaker A: And there's this whole process here. I just sent a message within the app and they fixed it. I got a hold of somebody, we just talked to each other via text and was able to get a result.
02:09:27.415 - 02:09:30.007, Speaker B: It's someone on Helium or someone on T Mobile.
02:09:30.111 - 02:09:35.977, Speaker A: Helium. Helium. Helium customer service. It was a Helium app and you go within the Helium app to chat with someone.
02:09:36.121 - 02:09:36.769, Speaker B: Okay.
02:09:36.897 - 02:09:40.929, Speaker A: So I was also very skeptical at first, but Helium works.
02:09:41.057 - 02:09:42.405, Speaker B: But why is it so cheap?
02:09:42.865 - 02:10:10.169, Speaker A: The next cheapest plan that I searched was $25, so it was $5 more. But there was like one or two features you couldn't get. I forgot what it was. Oh, yeah, there was like a cap on Internet and yeah, there were some, like, caps and some annoying things about it. This was pretty much. Helium was pretty much at parity with like, AT and T and Verizon in terms of features. And pretty much I paired it with features, which is what I wanted in the first place, like nationwide roaming and et cetera.
02:10:10.297 - 02:10:21.041, Speaker B: Okay. But when you use your phone, most of the time you're on T mobile, Right. And a small percentage of the time you're actually on the Helium Network. Does Helium Network actually cover the entire.
02:10:21.153 - 02:10:27.201, Speaker A: I don't know. I haven't. I haven't checked. Like, it doesn't tell you. Like, you just have the bar signals. I don't see. I don't.
02:10:27.201 - 02:10:29.817, Speaker A: I haven't seen the network. I don't see a network.
02:10:29.921 - 02:10:30.529, Speaker B: Okay.
02:10:30.657 - 02:10:33.009, Speaker A: Or I don't pay attention to it. It's probably what it is.
02:10:33.177 - 02:10:39.593, Speaker B: Like, basically, you only have coverage when there's someone near you that runs the helium HubSpot hotspot.
02:10:39.729 - 02:10:51.405, Speaker A: That's right, Helium hotspot. But that extends. Yeah. Let's look at the Helium network coverage. Here it is. I'm going to share my screen here in a second. Share, share, share screen.
02:10:51.405 - 02:10:55.683, Speaker A: All right, here we go. So if you look at it, it's all the major cities.
02:10:55.859 - 02:10:56.483, Speaker B: Sure.
02:10:56.619 - 02:11:29.561, Speaker A: And I would assume, like, let's look at LA as an example. This is. Here it is. You see, this is not bad for like a major city because you're normally in these areas. And so in these areas, as an example, you can switch, like, let's say you go to this pocket right here as an example, you switch to like T Mobile. And what I'm assuming what's happening with our phone data, what Helium's probably doing is trying to figure out where do people mostly travel to where there isn't a Helium service. And they'll probably give extra incentives to launch service there as an example.
02:11:29.561 - 02:11:45.827, Speaker A: I think that's what they're doing right now. It's like farming the locations where people mostly go to. Once you have those black spots of service, then you could throw extra tokens that way for people to launch the HubSpot there or the HubSpot, but hotspot there.
02:11:45.921 - 02:11:49.895, Speaker B: I'm looking at Manhattan. It's basically 100% covered.
02:11:50.015 - 02:11:53.635, Speaker A: Yeah, Northeast is covered pretty, Pretty good.
02:11:54.055 - 02:12:01.087, Speaker B: Okay, so if it's only $15, why isn't everyone already $20? $20, why isn't everyone already on it?
02:12:01.191 - 02:12:17.481, Speaker A: Marketing, that's what they're ramping up now. So they just released maybe a couple months ago, they did a really cool marketing video. So I think now they're ramping up marketing. But this coverage is pretty good. This isn't bad. You could get. I mean, on the safe side, you could probably get 10 million users easily just looking at this.
02:12:17.481 - 02:12:18.965, Speaker A: Just looking at this. You could.
02:12:19.385 - 02:12:24.753, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, if you're, if you live in one of those major cities.
02:12:24.889 - 02:12:37.555, Speaker A: Yeah, but like population, I mean, that's where most of the population is. It's pretty dense in those areas. Right. You could worry about the rest later. Get, get, get distribution. And if you look at other parts of the world, look at this. This is crazy.
02:12:37.555 - 02:12:42.487, Speaker A: Look at Europe. India's starting to grow too. Look at India just starting.
02:12:42.671 - 02:12:47.287, Speaker B: China, this green region seems like industrial farm.
02:12:47.311 - 02:13:03.369, Speaker A: Industrial is in Shenzhen. They're probably building a device there. But yeah, by the way so for.
02:13:03.487 - 02:13:22.917, Speaker B: For those listening, Shenzhen is probably so that's, that's the Silicon Valley of China. That's probably where the vast majority of deep end projects manufacture their hardware. The Shenzhen is the world's deepen capital manufacturing capital.
02:13:23.061 - 02:13:25.629, Speaker A: Any other deepen ideas that you, you like?
02:13:25.757 - 02:13:53.135, Speaker B: I mean there, there's a lot. There's Hivemapper but again I don't think that compared. So you say helium. The demand side is proven I guess with 90,000 or 60,000 you said. I think I saw 90,000 subscribers somewhere. But anyway so I think there is demand but to me overall it's still an experiment. I mean almost everything in crypto is still an experiment.
02:13:53.135 - 02:14:24.411, Speaker B: Hyphenapper relative to helium is way less proven on the demand side. I saw some charts of the revenues they're generating on a monthly basis. It's a very small number and it's not consistent. But I like the idea. I like the idea the supply side is proven like what 25% of the world's roads are mapped. The question is, will the demand side be proven as well? I think still already on the demand side.
02:14:24.523 - 02:15:02.733, Speaker A: So Proto is, Proto is a startup that went through our last batch and what they do, which I like a lot because India is an example where hivemapper couldn't work because the roads are real rough in certain areas, a lot of the rural areas. Two is a device is pretty expensive. You have to pay $200 and run the device on your car next in your car. And so like if you look at India's population, 80% of the people in India use Android phones. Right. As an example. And what Proto does is it enables anyone to use a phone device to scan their area.
02:15:02.733 - 02:15:38.507, Speaker A: So everyone is assigned a quadrant and then they can go out and map the different areas. And the data is fresh because people are able to go to different locations that the car can't go to either. And it's cheaper from a cost perspective you're just using your phone versus having to buy a Tonell device. Mm. So I do think we'll see different takes on mapping as well versus say what Google does today. Like Google as an example from what I remember talking to Proto team, they come after they come to India every few years because just so hard to. Whereas in the US they map every year or something like that.
02:15:38.507 - 02:15:40.787, Speaker A: So the freshness of that is also very important.
02:15:40.931 - 02:15:41.483, Speaker B: Yep.
02:15:41.579 - 02:15:44.857, Speaker A: So that's dependent anything any other deepen ideas that you like?
02:15:44.961 - 02:16:07.577, Speaker B: I mean overall I think that we've proven the supply side. It's very obvious that token incentives are a very powerful way to install new infrastructure infrastructure. But whether or not the demand side. Whether or not the demand side generates more revenue to cover the token issuance in the long term, that is yet to be seen.
02:16:07.761 - 02:16:26.901, Speaker A: So we built the supply side, now we need to build demand side. I think everyone's looking at Helium as the front runner as to how they're doing it. Okay, Gaming Pixels. Pixels has been growing. Oh, did you see the announcement where Ronin is launching on Polygon cdk?
02:16:27.053 - 02:16:28.225, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, that's right.
02:16:28.605 - 02:16:59.409, Speaker A: They're doing L2, like a proper L2 cdk. And so you have immutable and Ronin on Polygon ZKEVM for. So I could see gaming being aggregated there. I don't know. It could be interesting to see how that plays out. Yeah, we're seeing Pixels that's been growing pretty good. So there's two types of gamings in crypto, right? There's on chain games, then there's more like Web 2.5
02:16:59.409 - 02:17:02.633, Speaker A: games. So would you consider Pixel Web 2.5?
02:17:02.689 - 02:17:07.324, Speaker B: I haven't played Pixel. I don't actually know how it works. I played it has a ton of users.
02:17:07.464 - 02:17:24.132, Speaker A: I played it. It's a game. It's just a game like you don't really need, from what I remember, your wallet. You might have to sign in or something, but you do that later, from what I remember. But really there wasn't a lot of crypto in this. You just play the game, from what I remember.
02:17:24.268 - 02:17:38.547, Speaker B: So it sounds very similar to the Telegram games. Yeah, just a game. You don't need to know much about crypto, you know, far from being a AAA game, but it's more of a casual game mini game.
02:17:38.691 - 02:17:55.371, Speaker A: So getting users is very easy because, you know, there isn't a. There isn't a friction point where you have to get someone to use their wallet. You just play the game and then the wallet comes after is what I've kind of gathered. You, like, might have to sign in, but then outside of that, you don't really need the wallet for anything else.
02:17:55.523 - 02:18:01.115, Speaker B: RIP how the fuck did I run out of the battery so soon? I think it's the heat.
02:18:01.275 - 02:18:03.059, Speaker A: The heat that we're bringing on the podcast.
02:18:03.187 - 02:18:15.979, Speaker B: Yeah, the heat that Donald brought on dunking on all the bulls, taking vitriolabs. All right, I'm pretty much done. My camera is.
02:18:16.107 - 02:18:37.925, Speaker A: Yeah, no worries. I mean, on chain gaming also you have Primodium Mirage, some startups from our batch. That's building some really cool things on Unchained Gaming side, but hasn't been proven yet. Seen Redstone layer 2 being launched, which is the on chain layer 2 as an example. People always say that, you know, gaming is going to bring in the masses. I don't really. Maybe I'll.
02:18:37.925 - 02:18:42.293, Speaker A: I don't know if I subscribe to that thesis because games have such a short shelf life.
02:18:42.429 - 02:18:47.805, Speaker B: So so far it's stable coins and meme coins that brought the masses.
02:18:47.965 - 02:18:57.291, Speaker A: Well, yeah, they're like the two perfect examples. Cool. Well, I think that's it from our side. Thanks for tuning in. If you haven't hit subscribe, hit subscribe. We'll catch you soon.
