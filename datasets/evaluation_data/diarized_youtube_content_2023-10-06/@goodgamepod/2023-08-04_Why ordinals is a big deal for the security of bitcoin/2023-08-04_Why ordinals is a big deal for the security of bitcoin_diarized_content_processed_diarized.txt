00:00:00.240 - 00:00:39.662, Speaker A: This is a really surprising chart for me. And this chart shows the average block size of bitcoin. So this spike here, this recent spike, is ordinals, is people inscribing data onto the blockchain through the ordinal protocol, people creating nfts, people creating, you know, bitcoin domain names, creating visual nfts and so on and so forth. And before this ordinals phenomenon, the average block size was maybe around slightly over 1. Now it's at two megabytes. It's crazy. This is a big deal because, you know, obviously the demand for block space has not been reflected in the fee market yet, but the trend is there.
00:00:39.662 - 00:00:43.774, Speaker A: People want more block space on the bitcoin blockchain, and this is a really big deal.
