But Tezos seems to have a really interesting, at least special go to market because I watch soccer, I watch european soccer, and my team is Manchester United and they have Tezos, the Tezos logo on their jersey this season. Interesting. I was like, why did they pick Tezos? Like, Tezos must be spending a lot of money to get into the retail mind share. I was really surprised by that. But yeah, I'm not surprised that Tezos has their own niche of NFT collectors.
