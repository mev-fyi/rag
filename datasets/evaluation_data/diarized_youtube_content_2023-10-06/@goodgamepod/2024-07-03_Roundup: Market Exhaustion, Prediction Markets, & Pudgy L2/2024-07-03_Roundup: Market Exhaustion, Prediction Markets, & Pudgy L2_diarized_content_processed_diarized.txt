00:00:00.360 - 00:00:04.130, Speaker A: Welcome to good game. Your no B's insights for crypto founders.
00:00:07.950 - 00:00:15.438, Speaker B: Today, everyone's just so jaded, even though the prices are much higher. So they're complaining about the lack of new use cases.
00:00:15.614 - 00:00:36.106, Speaker A: Well, speculation is a use case, and they don't like it. The thing that's happening right now is that speculation is becoming a feature as part of every new product offering. The very notion of speculating is. Is what people don't like, and that's what's separating the old guard from the new guard. Speculation. To them, it seems like a future that shouldn't be for the masses.
00:00:36.258 - 00:00:47.002, Speaker B: Right. It should be a thing that's only available to them. Like, speculation is what made them rich in the first place. They don't want that to be available to the masses. Is that what the psychology is?
00:00:47.106 - 00:00:49.890, Speaker A: Yeah. Looking for your next startup idea in crypto?
00:00:50.010 - 00:00:51.602, Speaker B: Check out our request for startups list.
00:00:51.626 - 00:01:10.200, Speaker A: And get inspired at Alliance XYZ forward slash ideas. Lots has happened in crypto. Actually, not really. It's so. I don't know what's happening. It's. I feel like a sense of, I don't know, fatigue.
00:01:10.200 - 00:01:29.066, Speaker A: I'm tired. I don't know if it's just the chop and the random attacks on Ansem or the random messages about how to make ethereum more like Solana. So I feel like there's just. There's two camps, right? There's the consumer camp, and then there's the infra camp and. No, no, no, no. Okay, go ahead.
00:01:29.258 - 00:01:32.962, Speaker B: There is a optimistic camp, and there is a cynical camp.
00:01:33.106 - 00:01:33.722, Speaker A: Sure.
00:01:33.866 - 00:01:36.946, Speaker B: And a lot of big accounts are very cynical.
00:01:37.098 - 00:01:41.314, Speaker A: A lot of the. I think, okay, I'm gonna be maybe.
00:01:41.362 - 00:01:45.190, Speaker B: Let me. Let me find whatever. Whatever Donald said.
00:01:45.570 - 00:02:28.850, Speaker A: Okay. I think it's the old versus the new, the old versus the new. So, like, Gainesy put this tweet out, which I thought was quite interesting. He said, this isn't the last cycle of crypto, but it's probably the last cycle of old guard CT. Nobody from 2017 and earlier is having fun, and most of us are washed, irrelevant, replaced anyways. A lot of people probably going to leave in the bear market, not ever come back or minimally post. So I feel as if we're in this, like, interesting timing where a lot of new people are coming to crypto, and the meta has now shifted so much that the old guard really can't stand the new metas anymore.
00:02:29.150 - 00:02:30.934, Speaker B: Is it because they got too rich?
00:02:31.102 - 00:02:42.874, Speaker A: I think it's two reasons. One, they got too rich. Two, they're pretty happy with the. Their current methodology. Why should they change it for any reason? And I think that's a part of aging.
00:02:43.042 - 00:02:47.426, Speaker B: They're not happy with other people getting rich. They just want to stay rich themselves.
00:02:47.618 - 00:02:48.178, Speaker A: They do.
00:02:48.234 - 00:02:56.330, Speaker B: They don't want new metas because the new metas are not good for them. The new metas, you have to keep up with the new metas. The new metas are good for the new compass.
00:02:56.490 - 00:03:09.412, Speaker A: Exactly. And they don't have enough skin. Like, they don't. They have too much money. Like, they don't need to spend, you know, countless hours on pump fun or. Or others to look for the new meta. Right.
00:03:09.412 - 00:03:16.404, Speaker A: And so I do think it's old and new. And then two is, you know, the rich.
00:03:16.532 - 00:03:23.180, Speaker B: Yeah. I do feel like a lot of the cynicism comes from the old guards.
00:03:23.340 - 00:03:43.130, Speaker A: It has been recently. Yeah. It's almost similar to, if you remember, was it 2017 or 2020, where the bitcoin maxes just got so loud? And do you remember that? I don't hear about them anymore, but there was a point where it got really high, and I was just getting really annoyed, so I started to mute all of them, and I feel like that was the old guard at that point.
00:03:43.170 - 00:03:50.178, Speaker B: The bitcoin Twitter is a different Twitter from crypto Twitter. These are two distinct social graphs.
00:03:50.274 - 00:04:05.440, Speaker A: They are a lot of the older, at least from what I gathered, a lot of the older crowd were like Maxis or really stuck in their ways. Now I think it's shifted to old meta versus new meta.
00:04:05.780 - 00:04:25.324, Speaker B: Someone said recently that back in 2020, everyone was optimistic, despite prices being much lower than today. And today, everyone's just so jaded, even though the prices are much higher. It's almost as. They're complaining about the lack of new use cases.
00:04:25.492 - 00:04:45.996, Speaker A: Well, speculation is a use case, and they don't like it. The thing that's happening right now is that speculation is becoming a feature as part of every new product offering. The very notion of speculating is what people don't like, and that's what's separating the old guard from the new guard. Speculation. To them, it seems like a feature that shouldn't be for the masses.
00:04:46.148 - 00:04:56.886, Speaker B: Right. It should be a thing that's only available to them. Like, speculation is what made them rich in the first place. They don't want that to be available to the masses. Is that what the psychology is?
00:04:56.998 - 00:05:21.506, Speaker A: Yeah. So here I put a tweet out the other day, and I want to actually hear your thoughts on this. Crypto trading and speculation are becoming more like a competitive sport than traditional value investing. This shift will only intensify over time. Value investors often view this negatively. Bad actors have exploited the market over the past decade, taking advantage of unsuspecting users. But what they aren't seeing is the fact that there's a new group of speculators that are emerging that's willing to play the sport knowingly.
00:05:21.506 - 00:06:02.580, Speaker A: Know that they could lose all their money, but the promise of winning the game could be life changing, and they're willing to go all in like poker. Think of each token as a sports team and speculation as a game. There are a lot of knowns and unknowns, such as the dev, that launch token. How much of the supply do they own? Are they malicious? Are they good actors? Does the Amim have a brand? Will a CTO stick around? Et cetera? Value investors just see dumping and rug pulls, but some are okay with the risk and are willing to play the game. If you see this as a sport considered pump fund fun, as the early battlegrounds and Dexs and aggregators as a playing field, wallets, bots, and data products or tools would level up against competitors. Something like that. So I think what's happening is it's just becoming.
00:06:02.580 - 00:06:06.808, Speaker A: It's becoming its own thing, and people can understand it or they can't stand it.
00:06:06.904 - 00:06:12.400, Speaker B: Yeah, it does sound like something that was written by someone who doesn't do real sports. I'm joking.
00:06:15.780 - 00:06:31.400, Speaker A: All right. For the audience, I'm not a sports person. I don't watch sports at all. Chao does. He's the opposite. But does that sound like a. Look, I played sports when I was in high school, but that's about it.
00:06:31.400 - 00:06:40.574, Speaker A: And I was the guy that was always benched at all times, which made me hate this game even more.
00:06:40.702 - 00:06:46.782, Speaker B: Maybe let's talk about something that. That makes us feel optimistic.
00:06:46.926 - 00:07:28.762, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't think there's anything. Oh, man. Well, okay, so we talked about, like, speculation becoming more productized, and it's a, you know, kind of like you could think of shit coining as a new type of game. We're also seeing this on the infrastructure side, aren't we, with Mev? Right? Like, you could argue also that those that have validators, that have builders, relayers, they're also finding a way to grab Mev competitively with other builders and validators in the space. Right? So isn't that, like, also happening in the backend?
00:07:28.876 - 00:07:29.150, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:07:29.190 - 00:07:31.126, Speaker A: Or is that being primarily centralized?
00:07:31.278 - 00:07:39.078, Speaker B: Oh, it's super centralized. Yeah, it's super centralized. The block builders are. I don't know. Like, maybe a handful of them control.
00:07:39.134 - 00:07:40.414, Speaker A: It's so competitive though, right?
00:07:40.502 - 00:07:44.410, Speaker B: It's competitive maybe among five people, five entities.
00:07:44.750 - 00:07:45.430, Speaker A: Okay.
00:07:45.550 - 00:07:50.278, Speaker B: But you know, it's so. It's so funny because MeV. MEV is basically shitcoining for.
00:07:50.454 - 00:07:54.390, Speaker A: Well, the. Where is these. Where is the MEV coming from? It's coming from shitcoining.
00:07:54.430 - 00:07:55.410, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
00:07:57.170 - 00:08:04.170, Speaker A: So the infra people hate that shitcoin or shitcoiners hate the infra people, but in reality, they both need each other.
00:08:04.290 - 00:08:11.050, Speaker B: Yeah. What boggles my mind is everyone hates the shit corners and the speculators, but that's where their profit comes from.
00:08:11.170 - 00:08:11.634, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:08:11.682 - 00:08:43.298, Speaker B: The MeV traders, their profit comes from the shitcoiners and the validators. Ethereum, the whole ultrasound money narrative is based on the fact that there's shitcoiners trading and then all that. A proportion of their transactions ultimately flows through the validator proposer and all that stuff, all the movie stuff. And ultimately it goes to the validators. That's how the yield is generated. Some of the real yield on Ethereum comes from the shitcounters.
00:08:43.394 - 00:08:43.978, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:08:44.074 - 00:08:46.230, Speaker B: Paying the blockchain to play the game.
00:08:48.930 - 00:08:54.786, Speaker A: So really what you're saying is, in order for a layer one, L2 be successful, you need to have shitcoining.
00:08:54.938 - 00:09:01.586, Speaker B: At least in order for the layer one and the L2s to be economically secure today, they need sharecounters.
00:09:01.698 - 00:09:43.414, Speaker A: So, yeah, it was funny because I was at a conference, Dubai token 2049, and I was on a panel with Santiago, Jason from Folias and Tristan from backpack. And I think 40% of the conversation, I would say 40. I'd say like 20% of conversation was around pumped pump fun, which is essentially a shitcoin launchpad. So somebody tweeted this out publicly, saying like, oh, 40% of the conversation was about pump fun. And all the infra guys on the replies were like, if this is it, nuke everybody in this photo. I'm like, little do you know, all the profits that you generate are from shitcoiners. I found that to be quite hilarious.
00:09:43.414 - 00:09:47.850, Speaker A: Hey, what about the. I thought there was an interesting chart that you published.
00:09:48.150 - 00:09:49.694, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, let's talk about that.
00:09:49.822 - 00:09:57.974, Speaker A: Yeah. Why don't you share your screen and share that chart, which I think a lot of it's very true. We could talk about each meta quickly.
00:09:58.062 - 00:09:59.970, Speaker B: Yeah. Murad.
00:10:00.790 - 00:10:05.750, Speaker A: Murad. What's up with Murad? I mean, like, look, I think ran.
00:10:05.790 - 00:10:13.440, Speaker B: From bitcoin, ATC Maxi, all the way to shitcoin maxi or mint coin maxi.
00:10:13.860 - 00:10:24.156, Speaker A: Like, there's he's very polarized. And he goes all in. Like, do you remember when he went all in on bitcoin at the. He blew himself up, right?
00:10:24.228 - 00:10:25.292, Speaker B: He shorted.
00:10:25.436 - 00:10:27.484, Speaker A: He shorted at the bottom as.
00:10:27.532 - 00:10:34.932, Speaker B: As a 30 year long term bitcoin. Maxi bull, you know, investor. He shorted bitcoin at the bottom.
00:10:35.076 - 00:10:46.302, Speaker A: Anyway, um, either way, now he, he took a break. I think he raised money. He took a break after that debacle, and now he full ported into meme coins.
00:10:46.406 - 00:10:46.926, Speaker B: Yep.
00:10:47.038 - 00:10:47.366, Speaker A: All right.
00:10:47.398 - 00:10:59.734, Speaker B: So surprisingly, uh, so this is the chart, and surprisingly, uh, there isn't much disagreement. Like, people seem to agree with this. Um, except some people, you know, ask, where. Where is meme coins on this chart?
00:10:59.902 - 00:11:08.450, Speaker A: You know, we haven't talked a lot about gaming. Yeah, gaming. I think nfTs. I completely agree. I think NFts have bottomed.
00:11:09.070 - 00:11:14.158, Speaker B: I think nfts are. Is in the process of. Is in a long bottoming process.
00:11:14.334 - 00:11:16.206, Speaker A: What do you mean by long bottoming process?
00:11:16.278 - 00:11:19.614, Speaker B: I mean, bottom bottoming tip typically lasts a while.
00:11:19.742 - 00:11:20.450, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:11:20.790 - 00:11:27.196, Speaker B: Crypto punks has been. Has been down only for the last few months. Even pudgies isn't doing that well.
00:11:27.318 - 00:11:34.920, Speaker A: Pudgy says after Luca announced abstract, which is a new L2, I think it went up, maybe tweet.
00:11:35.040 - 00:11:39.344, Speaker B: Yeah, that's about it. Do you want to quickly touch on the pudgy layer, too?
00:11:39.472 - 00:12:29.646, Speaker A: Yeah, we can touch on Pudgy. So Luca team launched Abstract chain, which was essentially a culmination of an acquisition, which is Saigar's frame, which was an NFT marketplace. And I think it was supposed to be on its own L2, which made it different from everything else. So Igloo incorporated acquired frame, and then it rebranded to abstract, and pudgies is going to have its own layer, too. Now, there's a lot of pushback from the community and not pudgy community, but the rest of the community. And I think finally people finally got it that there's too many L2s. But, I mean, you and I knew about this, like, a year ago, and we've talked about this on our pod, so it's not anything new for our audience.
00:12:29.646 - 00:13:01.220, Speaker A: But now the community finally realized that there's too many L2s, and the person they're going to attack is Luca. But it turns out Luca is the right person, the right company or team to build something like this versus all the other L2s that we're seeing. Like a L2 for real world assets or a L2 for. I don't know. We've seen so many different versions of L2s that are out there. They're trying to command a very high valuation. But at least personally, I think that for pudgies, it makes a lot of sense.
00:13:01.220 - 00:13:34.548, Speaker A: And I talked about this in our last pod, but pudgies has distribution. They have 20 billion views of on Giphy. They have two different NFT community collections. They have wide appeal from an audience perspective. They've sold over 1 million toys, of which each one has some sort of identity marker that's tied to a chain. I'm not sure exactly what he has in plan for that, but he has a lot of interesting elements that gives him a very good story to build something really interesting and new on a L2.
00:13:34.644 - 00:13:39.572, Speaker B: Did he share what, what kind of L2 does it wanted to, does he want it to be?
00:13:39.716 - 00:14:10.712, Speaker A: Oh, he's just said more information will be revealed soon, so there isn't enough information that's out there, so it's hard to say. He also retweeted something about Pudgy gaming, and he has a separate Twitter handle for Pudgy gaming. So the way I could see this happening is I could see. Okay, two things. One is starting to think more about this. Each of the toys has some sort of QR code or identity marker that's tied to Zksync from what I read a long time ago. And now Zksync is going hyper chain.
00:14:10.712 - 00:14:26.744, Speaker A: Right lens protocol is building on Zksync. So based on just some of the info that's out there, I am guessing that he's going to be launching this on Zksync. Not sure if this is true or not, but I'm just hypothesizing.
00:14:26.872 - 00:14:36.938, Speaker B: Well, why do you say zksync? Because it could also be op stack or arbitram orbit. It could be polygon CDK, which isn't really ready.
00:14:37.064 - 00:14:57.822, Speaker A: Okay, so pudgy penguins has a partnership with Zksync. New wallets created has scaled to 59,006 months. This was in March. So this information is older. Okay, so they're shy of 11,000 unique wallets. 7744 penguins were bridged. Okay, so there's some sort of partnership between pudgies and Zksync.
00:14:57.822 - 00:15:01.990, Speaker A: So it's just a guess here. He hasn't revealed any information.
00:15:02.150 - 00:15:30.872, Speaker B: We'll need to come back to this finish. Yeah, but, like, look, in general, the idea of starting off building a brand or a product that is successful and has a lot of distribution, then turning into a L2, that makes sense to me. So pudgies is one of those cases, arguably blast is also another case of this. Right. So they started building the blur NFT marketplace and then turned into a L2. That makes sense to me. Avo makes sense.
00:15:30.872 - 00:16:04.430, Speaker B: Avo build a derivative trading platform and then turn into L2 to protect the MEV from getting leaked to the layer one and also to basically own the block space. All these instances of an app turning into a L2 makes sense to me. But where I struggle is the number of generic L2s launching. There's just way too many of them and I think a lot of them are just not going to make it because there's very little differentiation on the tech side. So blast launched last week, right? Is it last week?
00:16:04.550 - 00:16:05.654, Speaker A: Yeah, the token launch.
00:16:05.702 - 00:16:15.430, Speaker B: The token launch last week. And well, number one, I was very shocked that it didn't have Coinbase or finance listing on day one.
00:16:15.590 - 00:16:19.862, Speaker A: Well, Coinbase ended up listing it 4 hours later at the launch.
00:16:20.006 - 00:16:22.438, Speaker B: Okay. But it didn't have binance.
00:16:22.614 - 00:16:23.302, Speaker A: They don't.
00:16:23.406 - 00:16:48.544, Speaker B: Yeah, look, currently it's trading at 2 billion FTV and I would consider blast as one of the better L2s in terms of traction. And yet it's only trading at 2 billion. Like, is this meta coming to an end? I feel like it's coming to an end. The number of generic L2s, I think this meta is coming to an end unless you have really good technology. Really, really good technology.
00:16:48.662 - 00:17:00.180, Speaker A: All right. Just really good buzzwords and narratives otherwise. And so I think the market is just looking at like something like, I don't know, mega Eth or Monad.
00:17:00.300 - 00:17:43.044, Speaker B: And also I was thinking last night, the L2s are so commoditized. And what led me to think that is that all these, even the leading L2s today, they are paying a lot of money to developers to build on top of them. So in some cases they're paying eight figures to land a medium to high profile startup to build on top of them. And this happens across the board like optimism, arbitrum, especially Polygon from back in the day. They paid a shit ton of money to Starbucks, Zksync as well. All these leading L2s are paying a lot of money to acquire developers, which makes me think that they are quite commoditized.
00:17:43.212 - 00:18:08.120, Speaker A: Everyone's fighting for the same customers and the supply and demand supply is almost stagnant. I mean it's growing, I wouldn't say, but it's growing at a rate of, I don't know, I don't even know the percentage anymore. I got to look at electric's developer report. But you have this slow growth developer pool, then you have this high growth builder's pool or L2 pool. They're all trying to go after the same customers. So that's on the EVM side. And then Solana really has no competitors.
00:18:08.120 - 00:18:54.170, Speaker A: From a rust perspective, it's just an interesting dynamic that's playing out. I thought the blast launch was interesting also because there's one key thing that I didn't see, which was the listing of Binance. Historically binance. I think if you look at it, most of the well known launches will have Binance and Coinbase at launch at day one. This was missing speculating here, but probably because giving up percentages of tokens to binance may not be feasible. And so going without Binance was an interesting move from Pac man, because from what I gathered, talking to founders, you don't give up tokens to Coinbase. You only give up tokens.
00:18:54.170 - 00:18:59.542, Speaker A: From what I've so far have, like, that's the information that I have, I'm not sure if that's true or not.
00:18:59.606 - 00:19:00.566, Speaker B: I think that's true.
00:19:00.718 - 00:19:01.238, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:19:01.334 - 00:19:10.782, Speaker B: Yeah. And then the tier two exchanges, you have to pay them a flat fee. Yeah, it doesn't do either, I think.
00:19:10.966 - 00:19:13.550, Speaker A: Yeah. And so that's interesting.
00:19:13.590 - 00:19:13.814, Speaker B: Right.
00:19:13.862 - 00:19:45.984, Speaker A: And then if you look at Binance, binance takes between five to 10% of tokens. And really why they take it is to give it to the people that are staking BNB. I'm not saying all of it, but a majority of it goes to stakers, and the stakers bring in attention volume. Right. And it's like a interesting flywheel that they've created. But I don't know if it's like people, a lot of founders that we've talked to say that it's worth giving up five to 10% because they get the attention, they get the growth, et cetera. But I would like to see a world where you don't pay a fee.
00:19:45.984 - 00:20:28.312, Speaker A: Right? You don't pay a fee in terms of your tokens, you just launch it publicly. Like if you remember, there are a lot of great launches that's happened, where it's gone unnoticed, and then six months to a year later, the meta starts to build up and people start to buy into the token. I like that approach where the token is perceived weak and no one's giving attention to it, but you give a lot of time for the market to digest it and then create a narrative versus launching something with a very high FTV where we know that the price is just going to go one way, which is down. So I like the low fdv launches and allow the community to digest, build that narrative and then go up.
00:20:28.416 - 00:20:29.728, Speaker B: That might be the new meta.
00:20:29.864 - 00:20:41.360, Speaker A: I agree. I think that's how founders should be launching. From now on. It's the best meta. Like, you don't have to worry about. You don't have to be stressed out. Like founders that build launch at a very high FTV.
00:20:41.360 - 00:20:51.756, Speaker A: You have to continuously show news and product updates to justify the valuation that you're trading at. And eventually you're just going to get burned up.
00:20:51.868 - 00:20:54.324, Speaker B: Okay, what else stands out on this chart?
00:20:54.492 - 00:21:28.616, Speaker A: We've talked a lot about stablecoin already. Oh, you know, people. I mean, bitcoin is down only in terms of ordinals and runes. And one of our, one of our audience members replied back, talking about why we didn't talk about bitcoin or ordinals. And so maybe we should touch on that and see what's going on there. Yeah, look, I think the market is, has the speculators have just, they can only keep one thing in mind. Like, you can't throw too many new metas because they can't.
00:21:28.616 - 00:21:53.248, Speaker A: It just, they just can't digest it. And right now, the meta, the tension has gone away from runes and ordinals because the UX is pretty bad, right, as we all know. And it's very hard for them. Like, there isn't a marketplace that's as liquid as Solana right now. So it's very natural for all the new metas to be created on Solana. That's where the meta generation is happening.
00:21:53.344 - 00:22:07.700, Speaker B: I mean, the liquid markets for runes were on Solana. Solana was the L2. Was the L2 for 100%, 100%. Like people had had to bridge runes from bitcoin to solana, then trade there, then bridge back to settle.
00:22:07.820 - 00:22:42.784, Speaker A: That's right. So I think maybe with Opicat coming and with the partnership with Starkware, building out new infra, that could enable more liquid markets on L2s and runes. Could be interesting. I think it's going to take some time for them to build anything that's going to be as comparable to a L2 on Ethereum. We're seeing some new L2s like Bob build on Bob. Um, that's building for bitcoin, but specifically for ordinals and runes. I just think it's going to take time for the meta to develop back again.
00:22:42.784 - 00:22:55.464, Speaker A: But, uh, I'd say I'm not bearish at all. I just think this is very natural. And we had this huge liquidity influx into ordinals and runes. And over time, I think it's just going to. The tension will come back.
00:22:55.592 - 00:23:08.108, Speaker B: What do you think of Defi? Because I. So, if you look at the chart, I purposely put Defi not at the bottom, but after the bottom, like on the way up.
00:23:08.204 - 00:23:09.240, Speaker A: Yeah, I see that.
00:23:10.180 - 00:23:12.756, Speaker B: I'm insinuating that Defi has seen the bottom.
00:23:12.908 - 00:23:14.508, Speaker A: That's. I think that's fair to say.
00:23:14.604 - 00:23:17.252, Speaker B: I feel like we're really not excited to talk about this.
00:23:17.396 - 00:23:29.302, Speaker A: Defi sucks. I love Defi, but you. You know, I don't see anything that new. That's. It's just they. It's becoming more tradfi.
00:23:29.446 - 00:23:41.630, Speaker B: I think the most interesting thing. Interesting thing about Defi right now is that the major protocols like Makerdao, is making a lot of revenue. They're generating a lot of fees.
00:23:41.750 - 00:23:42.350, Speaker A: Yep.
00:23:42.470 - 00:23:45.530, Speaker B: And the price doesn't even look that expensive.
00:23:45.830 - 00:23:46.622, Speaker A: It doesn't.
00:23:46.726 - 00:23:49.258, Speaker B: Like you said, makerdom makes 100 million a year.
00:23:49.374 - 00:23:50.930, Speaker A: Yes. Revenue.
00:23:51.010 - 00:23:55.746, Speaker B: And FDV is like 2,000,000,002.5 billion. Yeah. So the.
00:23:55.898 - 00:23:57.130, Speaker A: I think it's undervalued.
00:23:57.290 - 00:24:03.306, Speaker B: The P ratio looks. I'm talking like a boomer now, but the P ratio is not crazy.
00:24:03.458 - 00:24:04.386, Speaker A: Yep. It's not.
00:24:04.458 - 00:24:11.242, Speaker B: I was also looking at Velodrome and aerodrome this morning. So, these are deck forks.
00:24:11.426 - 00:24:13.082, Speaker A: They're the forks of uniswap. Right?
00:24:13.186 - 00:24:13.978, Speaker B: Are they forks?
00:24:14.074 - 00:24:15.846, Speaker A: I thought they were. Maybe I'm wrong.
00:24:15.958 - 00:24:34.926, Speaker B: Maybe there. Yeah, maybe there are. And with some modification. But velodrome is the number one Dex on optimism. And aerodrome is the base counterpart. And so, aerodrome is making 15 million monthly fees. 15 million.
00:24:34.926 - 00:24:42.718, Speaker B: Aerodrome and the FDV is 700 million. Wait, this is crazy cheap.
00:24:42.814 - 00:24:54.554, Speaker A: Look, I think there's a. I think because of this dispersion that's happening, a lot of the Defi stuff is very, very undervalued right now. I think that's the meta that I could get behind.
00:24:54.722 - 00:25:09.850, Speaker B: Yeah. Oh, shit. Aerodrome is making like, close to 200 mil a year. Okay. And it's currently trading at 700 FTV. That's crazy. The PE ratio is three.
00:25:10.010 - 00:25:10.490, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:25:10.570 - 00:25:11.706, Speaker B: Can you imagine that?
00:25:11.818 - 00:25:13.842, Speaker A: I think that's where we are right now.
00:25:13.986 - 00:25:26.610, Speaker B: Oh, my God. Okay. Also, velodrome. Velodrome is making about 25 a year. And the fdv is 150. And the. The PE ratio is six.
00:25:26.610 - 00:25:28.226, Speaker B: That is crazy.
00:25:28.378 - 00:25:34.394, Speaker A: Let's look at. Okay. Curve. Are you looking fdv or are you looking at market cap?
00:25:34.482 - 00:25:36.830, Speaker B: I'm looking at FTV, not market. Cap.
00:25:36.950 - 00:25:52.734, Speaker A: Okay, just make sure. Curve. 600 million. They're making about 40 million in annualized fees. I'm just looking at the major protocols right now. Aave Ave's market cap is at 1.45 billion, and their annualized fees is 400 million.
00:25:52.734 - 00:26:00.318, Speaker A: That's good. Revenue is 70. Sorry. Revenue is 70 million. Fees, they're making 400 million. Revenue, they're making 70 million. That's all right.
00:26:00.318 - 00:26:18.348, Speaker A: I think velodrome sounds pretty good. So I guess, long story short, defi, nothing new or interesting, but they're profitable, and it's not reflected in the FTV of the token today, is what I is, I think, what I've learned.
00:26:18.484 - 00:26:25.420, Speaker B: Yeah. So revenue is fees minus the portion paid to LP's.
00:26:25.580 - 00:26:26.684, Speaker A: Ah, okay.
00:26:26.772 - 00:26:30.572, Speaker B: So fees doesn't really matter. What matters is revenue.
00:26:30.636 - 00:26:31.800, Speaker A: Revenue, yeah.
00:26:32.420 - 00:27:04.496, Speaker B: I mean, Lido seems pretty. Lido's price over revenue ratio is 15, maker is 24. Ave is 20, pendle is 31, radium is ten, jito is 22, banana gun is 1.8, frantech is twelve. But, Frank, revenue, it should. Is not going to the token holders. It's not.
00:27:04.496 - 00:27:18.536, Speaker B: I mean, my takeaway is some of these defi protocols are very reasonably priced. Right? Maker, Lido, Aave, these are. And even Pendle are very reasonably priced. Athena is a seven.
00:27:18.648 - 00:27:20.228, Speaker A: What's the revenue for Athenae?
00:27:20.274 - 00:27:22.576, Speaker B: 30 days. It's 9 million.
00:27:22.728 - 00:27:23.416, Speaker A: Wow.
00:27:23.568 - 00:27:35.280, Speaker B: Okay. But anyway. But Athena is not really defi aave maker and lido radium, these are handle. These are. These are Defi.
00:27:35.400 - 00:27:36.056, Speaker A: So which.
00:27:36.128 - 00:27:40.584, Speaker B: Which is why I put. I put Defi in that chart right after the bottom.
00:27:40.712 - 00:27:41.064, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:27:41.112 - 00:27:46.618, Speaker B: I feel like we've gone through the phase. The trough of the disillusionment.
00:27:46.794 - 00:27:56.442, Speaker A: I agree. So maybe Defi could be the next meta, or, you know, it will be the meta for value investors or, you.
00:27:56.466 - 00:27:59.738, Speaker B: Know, hedge funds, institutional liquid funds.
00:27:59.874 - 00:28:01.906, Speaker A: I think retail will not understand this.
00:28:02.058 - 00:28:02.586, Speaker B: Right?
00:28:02.698 - 00:28:05.350, Speaker A: So that's the matter. Okay, what else on that chart?
00:28:05.770 - 00:28:15.948, Speaker B: I don't know. Just so boring. How the fuck Jill Bowden go up? What the fuck, Jill. Jill Bowden went up.
00:28:16.004 - 00:28:23.852, Speaker A: Jill Bowden went to zero. I've never seen a token go to zero like that in my life. No, I have, but no.
00:28:23.956 - 00:28:27.044, Speaker B: Jill Bolden went up 60% yesterday. Overnight.
00:28:27.172 - 00:28:34.684, Speaker A: What? I looked at it last night before I went to sleep, and it was at four. $0.05. What's it at now? It's at $0.05.
00:28:34.812 - 00:28:40.580, Speaker B: No, no, I'm not. I'm not talking about. I'm not talking about Joe Biden. I'm talking about his wife.
00:28:40.740 - 00:28:42.812, Speaker A: Oh, Jill.
00:28:42.956 - 00:28:44.360, Speaker B: Jill Bowdoin. Not.
00:28:45.180 - 00:28:59.940, Speaker A: Oh, okay. I think you're talking about Geo Bowdoin. Well, one, I think. I think it's pretty clear now that he's incapable of running the country, but the Democrats are arguing against it.
00:29:00.060 - 00:29:02.914, Speaker B: Did you see. Did you see Bill Ackman's tweet?
00:29:03.012 - 00:29:03.582, Speaker A: Yes.
00:29:03.726 - 00:29:06.846, Speaker B: So he's like the video comparison, right?
00:29:06.958 - 00:29:07.542, Speaker A: No, no.
00:29:07.646 - 00:29:23.742, Speaker B: He put out a long tweet, and he said, you know, Biden is incapable of judging for himself, whether. For himself, whether or not he should be running for the. For the presidency. But the reason why he's still running is because of his wife, Jill Bowden. Jill Biden.
00:29:23.846 - 00:29:24.610, Speaker A: Oh, yeah.
00:29:25.030 - 00:29:31.302, Speaker B: Jill wants Joe to continue to run because that's the only way for her to stay relevant.
00:29:31.446 - 00:29:34.654, Speaker A: Yeah. With her lavish dinners and whatever. Right.
00:29:34.742 - 00:29:35.410, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:29:36.430 - 00:29:40.382, Speaker A: The private jet. This reminds me of. Do you remember succession?
00:29:40.526 - 00:29:41.250, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:29:42.230 - 00:29:51.650, Speaker A: Where the family wanted to take over Logan Roy's company so they can have that lifestyle, like, that feel of.
00:29:53.070 - 00:30:00.512, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I know what you're saying because there, I saw. I saw. I also saw a tweet of hunter Biden pushing his dad to. To continue to run.
00:30:00.576 - 00:30:04.900, Speaker A: Yes. Yes. Um, that's, like, effectively Kenneth Roy. Right.
00:30:05.720 - 00:30:07.648, Speaker B: Who's Ken again? Ken is the Ken.
00:30:07.744 - 00:30:10.360, Speaker A: Oldest son Ken. Oh, sorry, Kendall.
00:30:10.480 - 00:30:13.712, Speaker B: No, the oldest son is the guy with gray hair.
00:30:13.856 - 00:30:16.980, Speaker A: Yeah. No. Oh, well, that's a half brother. Right?
00:30:22.080 - 00:30:23.280, Speaker B: Kendall's number two.
00:30:23.400 - 00:30:23.840, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:30:23.920 - 00:30:28.780, Speaker B: Or number one, depending on how. Yeah, depending on who you talk to.
00:30:29.800 - 00:30:33.780, Speaker A: But that's effectively hunter Biden. Right. He's not serious, people.
00:30:39.800 - 00:30:59.220, Speaker B: So last week, last Thursday, the debate, I guess we definitely saw a new type of prediction markets. The bowdoin basically went to zero that day, and immediately the Kamala Harris coin and the Michelle Obama coin and the Newsom coin, they all went up.
00:30:59.340 - 00:31:00.212, Speaker A: And Gretchen.
00:31:00.316 - 00:31:03.676, Speaker B: And Gretchen. They all went up, like, 100% overnight.
00:31:03.788 - 00:31:10.640, Speaker A: Yeah. Jing Tao launched, if you know the Jing Tao Persona. He launched.
00:31:11.900 - 00:31:12.924, Speaker B: What did he launch?
00:31:13.052 - 00:31:48.310, Speaker A: He launched the Gretchen Whitmer coin, and there was already one a few weeks ago of another one that's similar. So you have the Gretchen coin, you have the newsome coin, and then you have the Obima, which is the Hillary or not Hillary? Michelle Obama. So all those three went up quite a bit. I feel like the Harry Potter Obama token has lost its flair ever since it talked about launching a layer three with whoever it was. So unfortunate. Meme coin should not go the layer three routes, letter two or whatever. It should stay a meme coin.
00:31:48.310 - 00:31:52.138, Speaker A: Well, doge did launch its own chain, right? I don't know. What's happening there?
00:31:52.274 - 00:31:52.690, Speaker B: So.
00:31:52.770 - 00:32:04.130, Speaker A: Okay, so let's talk about where we are in the market. It seems like the market has said that we bottomed. At least a few actors have already said that. Some people say we're chopping. Yeah. What's the update there?
00:32:04.250 - 00:32:08.570, Speaker B: I don't know. Just touch grass for two months with.
00:32:08.610 - 00:32:23.820, Speaker A: Is that $2.30? Um, let's see. Billy, $0.07. Bowdoin five. What else we got? Popcat, $0.60. Yeah, they're all stabilized. Mew Wen, Stan Slurf.
00:32:23.820 - 00:32:27.924, Speaker A: Yep, all choppy. There was actually a good tweet that I shared with you.
00:32:27.972 - 00:32:31.612, Speaker B: I know which one you're talking about. Every startup needs to have an in house.
00:32:31.716 - 00:32:32.068, Speaker A: Yes.
00:32:32.124 - 00:32:32.980, Speaker B: Influencer.
00:32:33.140 - 00:32:45.806, Speaker A: That's right. I think that's true. Someone needs to be the spokesperson. Someone needs to represent the brand. And they have natural network effects because of the followers that they have, and they can create some influence. Right.
00:32:45.918 - 00:32:48.558, Speaker B: Just like barachain.
00:32:48.694 - 00:32:51.566, Speaker A: Just like barachain. Just like pudgies.
00:32:51.718 - 00:32:57.854, Speaker B: Just like pudgies. Even Vitalik. Vitalik has its own Antonio for Solana.
00:32:58.022 - 00:33:08.610, Speaker A: Do you remember when the Eth Maxis were like, oh, the price is going down because Vitalik moved to Farcaster.
00:33:12.860 - 00:33:15.540, Speaker B: Ethereum lost its social layer.
00:33:15.700 - 00:33:25.148, Speaker A: Yeah, because everyone moved to Warpcast, which I thought was very funny. Okay, Mark Andreessen and Ben Horowitz.
00:33:25.324 - 00:33:27.760, Speaker B: You only remember Andrews, but not Horowitz.
00:33:28.100 - 00:33:49.004, Speaker A: Yeah, it took me a second, but you know those two. Right? Like, they are essentially the. The influencers. Modern day influencers for their firm, which I thought. I mean, which makes a lot of sense when people. I mean, even now, like, if. If I would, like, I would love to talk to Mark Anderson.
00:33:49.004 - 00:33:53.660, Speaker A: Right. So it's. It's. He still has a lot of influence in this space.
00:33:53.700 - 00:34:04.142, Speaker B: Also, elon for Tesla and Sam Maltman for OpenAI. OpenAI Jensen for Nvidia. Like, all of them just go on podcast tours every week.
00:34:04.166 - 00:34:05.806, Speaker A: Mark Zuckerberg. Right, Zuckerberg.
00:34:05.838 - 00:34:15.438, Speaker B: Now, Zuckerberg actually, like, changed his public image by going on podcasts and talk. Like real human.
00:34:15.614 - 00:34:25.250, Speaker A: Exactly. A real human. He started wearing chains and, you know, I don't know if you put, like, gel on his hair or something, but getting jacked.
00:34:25.790 - 00:34:27.210, Speaker B: Brazilian jujitsu.
00:34:27.649 - 00:34:41.337, Speaker A: He's becoming more human. And before he looked, the market perceived him as an alien. Do you remember that famous picture where he looked pale and he had sweat coming down as the politicians were hammering him with cushions?
00:34:41.433 - 00:34:44.481, Speaker B: Yeah. Testifying in front of Congress.
00:34:44.665 - 00:34:45.429, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:34:46.609 - 00:34:59.504, Speaker B: Okay, so the in house influencer stuff makes sense for these big established companies. But do you think it makes sense for a. Yeah, three person startup? Yes, I think it's debatable. Right. I don't think that's, someone needs to.
00:34:59.592 - 00:35:35.824, Speaker A: Bring up, okay, if you're building a product, probably less so, but more so when you're looking to get users to use a product. Right. And then kind of grow the user base, it definitely makes sense there. So like the other day, I've been doing user testing for a deck screener competitor. So I don't know if you've seen my tweets, but I've been tweeting a lot about getting product feedback from the user base. So I started putting tweets out, I started getting feedback, and that's really helpful because that feedback is now used to provide a better product experience for users. And that's how I think feedback should be.
00:35:35.824 - 00:36:13.850, Speaker A: And so I do think this quote unquote influencer base is important because you're able to connect and then deliver products based on what they're looking for. Polymarket just hit 100 million in volume, cumulative 1st, 100 million volume month. And I think it has a lot to do with Joe Biden and like Trump, Joe Biden's health is adding to the volatility. Right. I thought that was pretty interesting. It's funny though, like I was watching somebody put up a clip of some poker match and I'm trying to learn more about poker ever since I played my first game with you. And I lost horribly.
00:36:14.340 - 00:36:16.812, Speaker B: They didn't lose horribly, I lost dollars.
00:36:16.956 - 00:36:39.028, Speaker A: Okay, well I don't like losing, so any, any loss, even if it's a dollar, means horrible for me. Yeah. So I wasn't very happy with myself. So, so I watched some videos just to understand the game a bit more. And while I was watching this one game, polymarket had advertisements there. Just a general game. It wasn't, it was just a way on YouTube.
00:36:39.028 - 00:36:42.694, Speaker A: It was on, I watched on Twitter, there's like live streaming.
00:36:42.822 - 00:36:43.614, Speaker B: Okay.
00:36:43.782 - 00:36:54.406, Speaker A: So it was um, I forgot who it was, but they're pretty famous people. And the poker board or table, the poker table had the logo polymarket on there in the middle.
00:36:54.518 - 00:36:56.550, Speaker B: Oh, it's a physical table or.
00:36:56.670 - 00:36:57.370, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:36:58.110 - 00:36:58.638, Speaker B: Okay.
00:36:58.694 - 00:37:01.366, Speaker A: Or the show table or whatever table where they put the cards.
00:37:01.478 - 00:37:01.942, Speaker B: Okay.
00:37:02.006 - 00:37:12.864, Speaker A: Or something. Yeah. They had the polymarket advertising on there. So to me it seems like they're targeting that market like the speculator market, like the web two speculator market.
00:37:12.992 - 00:37:14.008, Speaker B: Yeah. The normies.
00:37:14.144 - 00:37:21.336, Speaker A: The normies. Not the cryptos. Not the crypto. Well, I mean, obviously there's crypto overlap to it, but I thought that was very interesting.
00:37:21.488 - 00:37:37.762, Speaker B: The polymarket, the product isn't to me, it's not crypto native at all. Geofence is us. You have to log in with your web two credentials. It's, I mean, it's designed in such a way that that's almost entirely web two on the front end.
00:37:37.866 - 00:37:41.530, Speaker A: So what would a crypto native product look like? Are you still thinking tokens?
00:37:41.650 - 00:37:56.114, Speaker B: I mean, the debate night last Thursday, I mean, we, it definitely showed that we have a new type of prediction market in Bowdoin, in Tremp, in Obima. Right.
00:37:56.242 - 00:37:57.230, Speaker A: Or Big Mike.
00:37:57.690 - 00:38:04.372, Speaker B: Big Mike. All these coins reacted to the live debate instantly.
00:38:04.516 - 00:38:11.012, Speaker A: Well, funny enough, both nuked. Yeah, Trump nuked. And so did, so did Bowdoin.
00:38:11.156 - 00:38:12.860, Speaker B: Trump didn't nuke that much, though.
00:38:12.980 - 00:38:14.132, Speaker A: No, not that much.
00:38:14.276 - 00:38:27.340, Speaker B: But I guess people were definitely disappointed by Biden. But they were also, I mean, they were also disappointed by Trump. I thought Trump did really well on all end.
00:38:27.460 - 00:38:34.542, Speaker A: Trump has become, he seems to be a professionalized president now. I was quite impressed with his, uh.
00:38:34.686 - 00:38:37.766, Speaker B: With his responses on the live debate or the all in.
00:38:37.878 - 00:38:39.046, Speaker A: I didn't watch the all in.
00:38:39.158 - 00:38:40.742, Speaker B: Okay. The all in one was really good.
00:38:40.846 - 00:38:41.334, Speaker A: Okay.
00:38:41.422 - 00:38:46.510, Speaker B: I thought Trump was, was very good on that. The live debate, he was, he acted more like a child.
00:38:46.670 - 00:38:59.504, Speaker A: Well, okay. When I'm comparing, what I'm comparing is this debate to his last debate where last debate he was more of a child. And so I felt like he held himself better than last debate.
00:38:59.592 - 00:39:02.100, Speaker B: So this debate, he's four years older now.
00:39:02.480 - 00:39:21.676, Speaker A: Exactly. Which I was impressed. I thought he was going to be much more aggressive, but he wasn't. And that's primarily because I think it's probably, I mean, thinking more about this is probably because Biden was in a weaker position. And if you came out as aggressive as he did last time around, it may look more negatively on him.
00:39:21.788 - 00:39:22.480, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:39:23.260 - 00:39:30.300, Speaker A: Okay. So what do you think? Newsom, Obama, Michelle Obama or Gretchen?
00:39:30.460 - 00:39:39.108, Speaker B: On polymarket, it says Obama, Newsom and Kamala Harris are tied. I just don't see Kamala Harris.
00:39:39.244 - 00:39:54.844, Speaker A: She's not serious people. She just doesn't seem serious to me. I've watched Newsom. He's pretty, I mean, he's well spoken, but I don't know. I don't think Michelle Obama is going to run. It's just, I just don't think so. I could be wrong here.
00:39:54.932 - 00:40:05.012, Speaker B: All of them have 4%. It's, it's high. Biden only has 2020, 2%. Trump is at 63 now. Pretty sure. Two weeks ago, Trump was in the mid fifties.
00:40:05.196 - 00:40:11.580, Speaker A: All right, so I guess the markets are dependent on who is going to be elected. So we'll see where it goes from here.
00:40:11.700 - 00:40:22.524, Speaker B: I mean, Trump getting elected would be really, really bullish for crypto yeah, it would be really bullish for all. I was gonna say it was really bullish on all for all markets, all risk markets.
00:40:22.652 - 00:40:24.132, Speaker A: It's good for everyone's bags.
00:40:24.236 - 00:40:24.820, Speaker B: Yep.
