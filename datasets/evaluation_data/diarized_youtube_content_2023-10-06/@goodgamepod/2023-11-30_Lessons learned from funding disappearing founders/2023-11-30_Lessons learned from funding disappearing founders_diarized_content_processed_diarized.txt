00:00:00.240 - 00:00:35.208, Speaker A: A lot of the things I see did kind of vanished on me and that pissed me off because like I've built businesses in the past. My first business like I raised money for and ended up failing. But I spent like three years of my life living on the floor of a one bedroom apartment grinding with like sixty k a year salary to make that work. And what happened in Defi was like these founders, I funded them or whatever. They paid themselves two hundred k a year salaries and they sent me like one investor update and vanished and I was like who the fuck did I just fund? Like that was obviously a big screw up. Like hey, power to them that they were able to like play me like that. But now I ask more.
00:00:35.208 - 00:00:42.744, Speaker A: Like one of the first questions I ask every team is is this your life's work? And are you working on any other projects? That alone filters out a lot.
