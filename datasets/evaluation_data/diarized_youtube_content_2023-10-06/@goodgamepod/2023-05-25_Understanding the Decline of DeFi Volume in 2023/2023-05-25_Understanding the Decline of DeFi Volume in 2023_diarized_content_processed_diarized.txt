00:00:00.170 - 00:00:50.140, Speaker A: In terms of high level, I think it's very clear that if you look across many datasets, across different layer ones, or across different DeFi protocols, that DeFi volume has been going down this year almost monotonically. And it's not really surprising, because we've learned this in DeFi summer when prices go up, all the metrics go up, and when prices go down, all the metrics go down. Fundamentally, there's two pathways that are causing this. So the one is, for example, when prices go down, TVL, by definition, goes down, because a lot of the assets that are deposited in the various pools are not stablecoins. They're crypto assets, like their ETH or BTC or whatever. Right? So when prices go down, the dollar amount of the TVL that are deposited into these pools go down by definition. So that's the first path way.
