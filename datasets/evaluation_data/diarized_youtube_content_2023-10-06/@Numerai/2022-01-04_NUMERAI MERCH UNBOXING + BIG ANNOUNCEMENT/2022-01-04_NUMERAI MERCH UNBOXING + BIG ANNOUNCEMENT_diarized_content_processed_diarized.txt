00:00:00.650 - 00:00:20.510, Speaker A: What's good, everyone? Peter here, aka studymate. And in today's video, we're to be taking a quick step away from our starter pack series. That's because I want to do an unboxing video on the numerai merch that I was able to get over the holidays. Now, don't worry, though. I got you. The next installment for the starter pack series is queued up. It's ready to go right after this one, so we'll be right back.
00:00:20.510 - 00:00:44.374, Speaker A: Just wanted to do a quick video on this to give people an idea of the merch. If they don't know about it, and maybe me. If you've seen some stuff but want a little explanation, seen it on the Twitter or something, we can go through it together. All right, so I've switched over to as much of a top down view as I think I can get. That makes sense. The only thing I've taken off so far is the label. So I don't give you guys all too much info.
00:00:44.374 - 00:01:02.560, Speaker A: I will say I am canadian, so all of my canadian numerators. I saw the Japan meetup. Looks really good. So if you're out there, link up, connect. Let me get a little help here. Might skip through this. Okay, now we've got this.
00:01:02.560 - 00:01:34.886, Speaker A: All right, there we go. Okay, so now that we've got it open, let's see what comes out first. And boom. The Bible advances in financial Machine learning by Marcos Lopez de Prado. So if you guys don't know who that is, I think he was the keynote speaker right before COVID Yeah. 2019 Numerai keynote speaker. This guy is at Cornell University.
00:01:34.886 - 00:02:25.706, Speaker A: But this book is by far one of the best textbook based coding books I've used so far, even in my four years of university. It comes with Python code snippets for all of the concepts. It covers everything from back testing to feature selection, all of the fundamentals, and some of the stuff that I've directly used in the numerai tournament myself. So it's awesome content wise and practicality wise, because they just give you the code pretty much with some small tweaks to make it work for the numerai tournament, because it's actually for live trading and not kind of just correlation based predictions what we're doing. However, yeah, Marcos is definitely a made man in this industry. He is like the godfather. Okay? I just look for his papers sometimes.
00:02:25.706 - 00:02:45.698, Speaker A: A lot of his stuff is really interesting and just makes sense, even for me. I don't work in finance, so when I read his papers and it still makes sense to a dumb guy like me. We know that he's doing good. So an awesome start. It's awesome. I have this actually, virtually, that I totally bought legally. Okay.
00:02:45.698 - 00:03:03.890, Speaker A: Don't ask me otherwise. So it's great to get this in paper and a physical copy. That's a great start. Very strong start. Awesome to have that. Also have a little loop bag. Thank you for being part of the numerati dope.
00:03:03.890 - 00:03:16.710, Speaker A: I think this is going to be stickers. Yep. Awesome. All of you like to bang these out on the back of your. Very, very cool. We'll be doing the same. I like the logo ones personally.
00:03:16.710 - 00:03:30.414, Speaker A: These ones I find super dope. I can stick them everywhere if you haven't already. I'm a total loser. Also got the Airpods, the sticker on top of that. All right. What's this? Okay. Also.
00:03:30.414 - 00:03:48.130, Speaker A: Oh, phone grip and stand dope with the logo. This is cool. I actually just expected stickers, so this is a nice add on. What else? It's still going nice. We got coasters, I think. I hope those are coasters. I'm not just dumb.
00:03:48.130 - 00:04:02.060, Speaker A: Awesome. A couple of those and just make sure I'm not missing anything. What do we got? Oh, webcam cover. Awesome. With the logo on it. Kind of hard to see. It's pretty small.
00:04:02.060 - 00:04:17.342, Speaker A: But if I can get this in focus, I think I have to put it. Oh, there we go. Yeah, it's a little webcam cover with the numerai logo on it. That's so cool. Actually needed one of those. Yeah. No, that's awesome.
00:04:17.342 - 00:04:38.930, Speaker A: I love the little loot bag. That was awesome. And last but not least. Oh, my favorite one. We can rock the numerai swag outfit of the day, the numerai logo t shirt. Look at that. Jeez.
00:04:38.930 - 00:05:03.274, Speaker A: Oh, I have it backwards. Oh, it has something on the back, too. Numerai on the back and then logo on the front. I was worried that they would do the polo just like the small logo, kind of like just on the pocket. But I'm actually happy. I like just the big logo on the front. So this is great.
00:05:03.274 - 00:05:25.154, Speaker A: We can all rock our Numari swag at the Numari convention. Okay, everyone, if you don't have your shirt by then, that means you're not staking in the tournament. Shame on you. All right, well, I think that's everything. This was awesome. Actually, more than I expected. I knew the book came in it just from seeing on Twitter, but I was curious what all the little small swag loopbox stuff was.
00:05:25.154 - 00:05:40.006, Speaker A: And this is a lot more than I expected. Super happy with this. Thank you again to the Numerai team. This was awesome. And to everyone. You can also get this stuff if you just participate in the tournament stake on your model. So make sure to do that.
00:05:40.006 - 00:06:24.118, Speaker A: Make sure to follow up on the next episode of the Numerai starter pack. And we're back. That was fun. That was different, right? I enjoyed that. The next thing I wanted to cover in this video was that officially, we are now funded by the Numerai council of elders. And what that means for those who don't know, the Numerai Council of Elders is a group of long standing, active community members that vote on proposals from the community around any numerai based projects that might enhance the community. Just to give some examples, I can actually pull them up here.
00:06:24.118 - 00:06:47.754, Speaker A: A great one. Numer Bay so the platform to buy and sell numerai predictions, it was a proposal from the council of elders to start shout out to rez trading for that. Another one that I like, the newsletter adventuring handles. That does a great job. It sums up all of the monthly numerai based events. If you're not already subscribed to that, make sure to get onto that. But yeah, we made our proposal.
00:06:47.754 - 00:07:09.646, Speaker A: So if you also have an idea that you think that is worth funding and that can enhance the community, don't be afraid to post it on there. It's a great way to either get feedback or to get approved for funding. That's kind of how I saw it when I made mine. But we made our proposal. We got really good approval. Shout out to anyone in here for my videos that went in and voted for me. Appreciate all the support.
00:07:09.646 - 00:07:43.626, Speaker A: Yeah, I threw up some of our statistics how we did on the first couple of videos and we were approved. So I'm going to be using all the funding from here to really make sure that we get the next couple of videos out on time, aiming for every two weeks. So any feedback on that? Again, make sure to let me know on my videos or if you're not already in the discord, please jump into there. Some good conversations so far, but again, like and subscribe to the channel. Helps my growth. Thank you so much. If you've been supporting so far, if you want more content from me, follow me on my socials.
00:07:43.626 - 00:08:16.850, Speaker A: Get in the discord, get in the rocket chat, get on numerai forums. And that's all for me today. So appreciate you watching. And I'm out. Sarah.
