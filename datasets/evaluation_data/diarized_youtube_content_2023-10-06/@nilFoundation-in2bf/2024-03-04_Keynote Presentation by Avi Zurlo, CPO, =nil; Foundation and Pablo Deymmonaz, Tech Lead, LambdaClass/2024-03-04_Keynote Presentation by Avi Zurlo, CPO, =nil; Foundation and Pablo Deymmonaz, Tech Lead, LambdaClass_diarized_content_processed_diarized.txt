00:00:01.450 - 00:00:21.680, Speaker A: Just want to say welcome to Scale Summit. My name is Lindsay Cassal. I'm the head of marketing here at Nil Foundation. I know there's a lot of events you could have been at today. Thank you for choosing this one, if only for a few hours. We're really excited. We have an amazing day of content for you guys, as well as networking opportunities, food, swag, co working, you name it, we got it.
00:00:21.680 - 00:00:54.598, Speaker A: I am going to just kick us off with a couple housekeeping things and then we're going to start the content. So when you're posting on x today, please remember to mention nil foundation and Lambda class. We are also being live streamed at the moment and recorded. So, hi everyone tuning in. We're going to be sharing that live stream from all the sessions and from the entire day on our X account. So give us a follow to see those and other event highlights. After the event, I want to let you know that we want to be here to connect, meet other people, network.
00:00:54.598 - 00:01:29.254, Speaker A: I'm sure you're really eager to talk to a lot of our speakers here today. I just ask that you have those conversations in the exhibitor area, in the coworking space to keep this area as quiet and respectful as possible. Next, we are going to be doing some audience q and a during panels, if time allows. If you have a question, please just stick to one concise question so we can get to as many as possible. Also, in addition to this main stage content, we're doing small group workshops in the coworking space. The first one is starting at 130. Check out the schedule throughout the venue to see who else is going to be popping in there throughout the day.
00:01:29.254 - 00:01:55.780, Speaker A: And then last but not least, be respectful, be kind, be courteous to your fellow attendees, fellow speakers, we're going to have an amazing day today. And without further ado, I'm really excited to welcome our next set of speakers. For the opening keynote, I would like to introduce to you Avi Zerlo, who's the chief product officer of Nil foundation, and Pablo de Monias, who is the tech lead at Lambda class. Thank you so much.
00:02:03.970 - 00:02:04.720, Speaker B: Test.
00:02:09.590 - 00:02:27.930, Speaker C: Everybody. How are we doing? Thank you for attending. Welcome to Scale Summit. We're going to have a good day for everybody today. Thank you to everybody who's joining in on the live stream. My name is Avi Zurlo, I'm a chief product officer at Nil foundation.
00:02:28.590 - 00:02:33.530, Speaker B: Hi, my name is Paolo de Imunas and I am a tech leader at Lambda Glass.
00:02:35.070 - 00:03:32.080, Speaker C: Okay, so a little bit about what's in store today, scale summit is bringing together leaders in the Ethereum, scaling and ZK space. We'll have plenty of educational content, hopefully a few thought provoking insights, maybe a few debates, plenty of networking opportunities, good food, some scarves are supposedly floating around. Grab yourself a scarf. We have three areas which I think you've all probably crossed at some point already. There's a co working space which is where we'll host workshops. We have the main stage for content here, and then we have an exhibitor space for networking and some of the booths a little bit about Nil Nil is Nil foundation was founded in 2018. We're a group of engineers and researchers who've focused on cryptography and ZK work.
00:03:32.080 - 00:03:41.120, Speaker C: This year we're very focused on delivering a new layer, two nil, that employs ZK sharding protocol, which we're very excited about.
00:03:44.190 - 00:04:28.410, Speaker B: A bit about Lambda glass we are a collective of hardware engineers. We like to work on challenging and hard problems. Lambda class aims to lead the way in new technology only in the past year we launched Kyro VM in Mainnet. We introduced Lambda works, our library for ZK, to make ZK and validate proof accessible for the community, for non cryptographers. And also we have our Ethereum consensus node MVP fully operational.
00:04:31.750 - 00:05:16.690, Speaker C: And before we start, just a quick shout out to all of our fantastic contributors. They made this event possible. So thank you for contributing, and don't forget to check out the exhibitor tables in the hallway out there to learn a little bit more. And you'll be hearing from most of them today on stage at some point. So today, what do we have in store? We have four panels, four presentations. We have a panel on the future of roll ups, economics of zero knowledge, proofs, decentralized proving, and why Zk security is important. And then we'll be hearing from PI squared, fabric cryptography, RisC Zero and Nil foundation.
00:05:16.690 - 00:06:06.898, Speaker C: And then in the co working space we'll have three workshops from Giza, Lambda class and Nil foundation respectively. Check out the schedule, which I believe is posted right outside that space for details. And this is called scale summit for a reason. We're going to be talking about Ethereum scaling quite a bit at Nil foundation. This is top of mind. We've observed across the ecosystem that l two s have solved some immediate problems for Ethereum, but they also come and introduced a few of their few new problems that we have to solve. A number of these we'll discuss today on our panels, like the future of roll ups, why ZK security is important.
00:06:06.898 - 00:07:21.500, Speaker C: Horizontal scaling and more at Nil foundation for 2024 we've really taken a step back and thought about scaling from first principles and have looked at sort of two frameworks for adopting real scaling. At the l two, when we look, there's vertical scaling and horizontal scaling. And when we evaluate these under a really critical eye, horizontal scaling offers a number of benefits that we actually want. At the layer two level, in particular, we have much higher scaling limits, it promotes decentralization and it allows for further vertical optimizations to be made. And given these benefits, many l two s today, in particular roll ups try to achieve this horizontal scaling end state, right? And this is effectively done by merging existing roll ups into a single system. And we can do this by implementing some sort of middle layer that offers some sort of shared consensus, that facilitates cross roll up communications. And effectively we have a merged single system.
00:07:21.500 - 00:08:07.398, Speaker C: But working backwards has some of its disadvantages. Nil takes sort of a fresh starting point and looks at sort of the body of research around sharding blockchains and identifies that with the advancements in zero knowledge proofs on both the research and engineering side, there's actually an opportunity to solve some of the really large outstanding problems for sharded l ones, in particular, data validity. And we cheekily like to say sharding is dead. Long live sharding. And hopefully you'll learn a little bit more about that later today. With that, I'll hand it over to Pablo.
00:08:07.494 - 00:09:06.950, Speaker B: Thank you. Lambda class believes that zero knowledge proof will play an essential role in shaping the future, especially beyond blockchain. So in areas that we are still beginning to explore. So we double down on lambda works, our library for ZK. We want to help and we want to provide, to offer developers the building blocks and proof systems to allow them build applications, their applications on top of our library, a little bit about our philosophy. We are open source, maximalist, we build in the open. For example, our Ethereum client team building the team building the node.
00:09:06.950 - 00:10:14.190, Speaker B: They have the daily meetings, live streaming in YouTube. So many people are attending the meetings, are following the project, and we believe that helping people from the community, onboarding the projects and making a movement bigger or much bigger than the original project is crucial for the crypto projects to succeed in the long term. And we work side by side with the community. In the last few months we ran two boot camps, one in cryptography, another in Ethereum, with a succeed. And this year we will double down on this, on bootcamps, other focus areas of Lambda class we are working on a new programming language. We were using programming language since many years. We test and we used many programming languages.
00:10:14.190 - 00:11:21.134, Speaker B: So we are designing and we are writing the compiler of this new programming language called Concrete. And this is a simple programming language specifically craft for creating highly scalable systems that are reliable, efficient and easy to maintain. You can search for concrete, you can look for our repo. We have a new game studio, we have two games right now in production and we believe that solving web3 gaming problems will help web3 mass adoption. And thank you again for being here today. Don't forget to follow us. Neil Underscore foundation and class underscore Lambda on Twitter X to access the session recordings, the submit recap and to stay in touch after the event.
00:11:21.134 - 00:11:21.580, Speaker B: Thanks.
