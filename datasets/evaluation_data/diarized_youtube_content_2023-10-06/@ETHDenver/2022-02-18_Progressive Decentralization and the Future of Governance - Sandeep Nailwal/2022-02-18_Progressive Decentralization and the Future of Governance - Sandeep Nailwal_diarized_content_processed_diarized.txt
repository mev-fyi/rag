00:00:00.250 - 00:00:10.398, Speaker A: So I'll just try to rush through in whatever time we have left on this. So I wanted to start from a, you know, basic. What?
00:00:10.484 - 00:00:13.294, Speaker B: Sorry, it wasn't mirroring correctly. You can go ahead, though. Okay.
00:00:13.332 - 00:00:59.838, Speaker A: Yeah, I wanted to start with a basic, you know, history of polygon. Timeline of polygon. And then, you know, what we are thinking in terms of the ecosystem dao that are coming in and network also, in a sense, network also is a dow, right? In the sense that it's run by the validators. And the validator community takes decisions related to the discussion or decisions on the network. So let's start with a brief journey. And why I'm saying this is. I'll come back to that, that we started in 2017, rebranded to Polygon from Matic in 2021.
00:00:59.838 - 00:01:45.194, Speaker A: And since then, we have launched, like, multiple products, which includes polygon Pos chain. Now we have Polygon edge, where you can start your own chains using polygon edge. And then we are about to launch some of the roll ups. We have a ZK roll up with Polygon Hermes, which right now allows the payments. But why I want to say that is that probably in the history of the networks that we are building, polygon is kind of in a unique place because we are probably the first network, which is basically an aggregator of multiple networks.
00:01:45.242 - 00:01:45.454, Speaker B: Right?
00:01:45.492 - 00:02:30.506, Speaker A: So you have multiple different chains. I'll come to this part also, but let me take you through this. So we have Polygon Pos live, polygon SDK is live, polygon Hermes is live and all that. So all of these networks are built on top of Ethereum. So when you want to go into the governance of these networks, you have two different forms or two different ways you can think about it. So, for example, a lot of decision making on the network can be done on chain, on Ethereum. So, for example, how many validators can be there on a particular chain? You can decide this by choosing some parameters on Ethereum.
00:02:30.506 - 00:02:31.370, Speaker A: Smart contract.
00:02:31.450 - 00:02:31.934, Speaker B: Right?
00:02:32.052 - 00:02:58.434, Speaker A: So that's one thing. Similarly, let's say you wanted to, I mean, this is on chain governance, on the layer one, then you can also have a part of the governance on these networks itself. So, for example, Polygon PoS chain has validators, and validators can impose, or kind of can impose some governance rules by accepting or rejecting some upgrades on the network clients.
00:02:58.482 - 00:02:58.838, Speaker B: Right?
00:02:58.924 - 00:03:47.186, Speaker A: So this is why I feel that we are in a unique situation wherein we can have some programmable network parameters on the layer one. And we can have, of course, the network client based network governance that can happen on the layer two chains. So that's why I wanted to start from there. Brief history, like, I mean brief thesis about polygon. I mentioned yesterday also that we believe that ethereum is the settlement layer of this web3, and then the transaction layer will soon emerge on the layer two, where you'll see applications primarily deploying on layer two. We are already seeing a lot of applications who are directly deploying on the layer two. So that's where we feel that all the layer twos are going to become the transaction layer.
00:03:47.186 - 00:04:49.050, Speaker A: The applications and users actually will be using layer twos only. I also mentioned some time back on Twitter, I remember that ethereum main chain is actually transitioning from a user to chain where user actually used to interact with the chain to chain to chain, where chains are actually going to settle into ethereum and then the user activity will move onto the layer two. Basically, we are present across the spectrum. If you think about Ethereum scaling with polygon SDK, you can have standalone chains which are not secured by ethereum, but just have a bridge to ethereum. And on the right extreme, you have fully secured layer twos where we are building multiple zero knowledge roll ups, optimistic roll ups and so on. Brief stats about polygon ecosystem it is currently the most adopted ecosystem by the developers. 7000 plus Dapps was posted by alchemy some time back.
00:04:49.050 - 00:06:13.134, Speaker A: I think infura also mentioned like they have around 10,000 developers. So coming into this like the main topic, the decentralization and future of governance. As I was mentioning that you have both related to the Dows as well as well as the network, which I wanted to present. The polygon's point of view, you have on chain governance as well as off chain governance, right? So on chain where you change some parameters on a smart contract and then you can govern the underlying Dow, or you can also have the validator community can have a lot of social discourse on their communities and influence some decisions over there. The main dilemma on the governance side is this, that we all want to eliminate the third parties, but we realize that with all this history of the dows in the past, a few days, a few months or years, I would say it is there that those validator communities, or not validator as in the Dow communities, the token holders govern the dows. And it's really hard to completely remove, let's say the powerful people in a particular community. So there are multiple kind of design patterns emerging.
00:06:13.134 - 00:07:06.418, Speaker A: We are also seeing that decision making becomes very difficult in the Dow. So I'm seeing a lot of dows actually going into the delegation mode where the community can delegate, let's say the decision making to a fixed number of, let's say the delegates, and then the delegates can take faster decision. But still, it's been really difficult to completely eliminate any single particular or some centers of power and have a fully decentralized governance. I mean, we know that the timeline of dows, and then this is the time when we are seeing a lot of dows coming in. And that's why these governance and these parameters, the tooling is becoming very prominent. So I mentioned that governance again is applicable on the networks also. So you have three different kinds of governance.
00:07:06.418 - 00:07:46.434, Speaker A: Let's say this is again in the context of polygon, for example, validator governance and community governance. These are already live. The network governance fully, where you can change network parameters from Ethereum is still work in progress. Some of the things that could be helpful for the people who are right now looking into dows is some of this tooling that is available on the DAO. So snapshot where you can actually have votes without having a fully deployed smart contract DaO, you can actually have some parameters. Based on some parameters, you can have some sort of voting. Similarly, you have dwork, which is like a web3 bounty board.
00:07:46.434 - 00:08:56.818, Speaker A: You have tools like Sobol, which are providing like decentralized operations and grants program. We are using them, let's say in the polygon ecosystem, dow nosis safe can be used for the Dow and treasury and discord and discourse are being used for the communication and community decision making. Before you go for on chain voting. So some of these toolings is very helpful. And if some of you guys are looking into do something in the dows, these tools are good point to start with, some of the challenges at decentralized governance like plutocracy and meritocracy, there's always a kind of war between these two side of things. You always have some whales holding large amount of tokens in a particular dao, and you have the real contributors. So how do you kind of balance these two power centers? I mean, Vitalik had proposed quadratic voting some time back, so it has been experimented in gitcoin and various other places.
00:08:56.818 - 00:10:11.920, Speaker A: But we still are, I think, far away from the ideal solutions on this, the governance tooling. I also said that right now, still tooling is still in fairly early stages. So that also is a fairly big issue. And of course, if you don't achieve all of this, you risk the Dow being centralized, which can lead to the downfall of the Dow. Opportunities for decentralized governance I am a big proponent of progressive decentralization because we know without naming the projects like some projects decentralize too fast and then the decision making in those projects becomes way too slow and it becomes very hard to make large impacts. So, sharing an example from polygon side, we have always believed in the progressive decentralization and we are moving slowly towards that goal. So even now we don't believe that we'll fully decentralize the treasury operations or business operations in the next two to three years because we believe that there is a lot to be done on the adoption side and for that we need fast decision making.
00:10:11.920 - 00:10:45.366, Speaker A: Innovation on the governance side is also growing extremely high. There are multiple things that are happening, multiple tools that are being created, multiple ways of voting and decentralizing power within the communities. And how do you distribute the decision making power within the community? As I was mentioning that you always have a dichotomy between whether you should allow a large number of people to participate in voting or making the decisions and then how fast you can take the decisions.
00:10:45.398 - 00:10:45.546, Speaker B: Right?
00:10:45.568 - 00:11:25.000, Speaker A: So there's always a kind of tug off war between these two things. And I am seeing that the delegated like subdow kind of concepts where you have a big subdow, but individual decision making can be delegated to these subdows is becoming bigger and bigger, and then each subdow might have their delegates. Which community chooses? Let's say there is an investment dow, the community chooses who are going to be the GPs of, let's say, this investment subdow. So similarly, if the GPs are not doing good work, community can replace them and things like that. So those kind of things are also happening pretty well. So I think we are running out of time. Thank you so much.
00:11:25.000 - 00:11:26.980, Speaker A: Thanks a lot.
