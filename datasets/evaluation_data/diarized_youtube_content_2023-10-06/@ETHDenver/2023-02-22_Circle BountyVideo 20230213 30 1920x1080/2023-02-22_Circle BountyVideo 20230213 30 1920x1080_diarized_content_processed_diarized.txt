00:00:00.490 - 00:00:50.562, Speaker A: Hi, this is Sam Seeley and I lead community at Circle. We're excited to be a part of Eat Denver and to bring you three bounties. Today, I'm going to tell you a little bit about our bounties, but first, here are some background on Circle. Circle unites people, businesses, communities around a common purpose, building a more open, prosperous world. As an issuer of USDC, Circle offers cross chain infrastructure payments APIs, programmable wallets to empower developers to compose novel experiences with USDC and unlock mainstream use cases. Developers all over the world can tap into USDC for payments trading, financial services, treasury marketplaces, ingame economies and more. Developers can accelerate time to market with Circle's web3 services platform and ecosystem grant programs.
00:00:50.562 - 00:01:22.920, Speaker A: They can also magnify growth with Circle Ventures. All right, so we're offering the following bounties, two different bounties in the feature bounty category. One is unlock opportunities with Crosschain Transfer protocol. I'm excited about this one. For this, there'll be one winner and the prize is 2500. The second is another exciting one which is embed streaming USDC payments into your app. There'll be two winners in this category and they each can win $2,500.
00:01:22.920 - 00:02:03.582, Speaker A: Finally, we have one bounty in the early stage startup category. This one is titled Build Web three businesses at scale. For this, there'll be one winner. Got to be real good and you could win $4,000. We chose these bounties because we wanted to incentivize builders, helping to integrate USDC in the centralized applications. The buildathon platform and Edenver website will contain a full description of our bounties, how to contact us, where our booth is at, and how to add our bounties to their project. In order to be the most successful, we highly recommend using the following resources.
00:02:03.582 - 00:02:32.140, Speaker A: All right, so you have circle developers. This is where you can explore resources and information on our blockchain APIs, web, three SDKs, and more to help developers like yourself use USDC and ULC. Also, we have our discord and you can visit that@discord.com invite build oncircle if you have any questions looking to connect? You can join our discord and reach circlers just like myself. Overall, we're really excited to have you all be a part of this and can't wait to see what you built.
