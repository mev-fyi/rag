00:00:00.890 - 00:00:26.120, Speaker A: Hi. Hi. Hey. Hi, how are you? Can you hear me okay? Thanks. Well, I'm Valentino Mek, CEO of Cryptolandia, a crypto education startup from Argentina and former mission board member of the proof of Humanity Dao. First, I want to say that English is not my first language, so maybe I make some mistake or mispronunciation. So sorry for that.
00:00:26.120 - 00:01:30.970, Speaker A: Like I say in my application, I will talk about three points that I think are fundamentals and how proof of humanity can solve them. The first one is the problem of scam bots and spam is social medias. The second one, the importance of having decentralized protocols that can provide digital identities in the blockchain. And the last one, the need for a universal basic income to help and to solve poverty in the world. To start with this, I want to do a short exercise together. If you won't follow me, please raise your hand if you haven't received span messengers on Twitter, for example. Okay, in a fast calc, maybe the 70% of the people or the 60% of people in this room having received a spam messenger on a social media, for example, Twitter.
00:01:30.970 - 00:02:09.750, Speaker A: This is a who problem. Bots are infecting social medias. The people are getting tired to blocking or reporting this scam and spam account. And it's very tight. And this problem can be solved just using the proof of humanity protocol. Proof of humanity is a simple protocol when you just need a wallet. Sorry, a wallet, some eth, a peak and a short video of yourself to create your digital identity.
00:02:09.750 - 00:02:54.770, Speaker A: Then you go with your wallet to the app, DaP or social media. You connect your wallet and it recall your account information. And that page knows that your wallet. There's a human behind the computer. We have already case of use, for example, EMHO, or I like to say emo. It's called it in my human opinion. In my human opinion, where proof of humanity is used to ensure that all opinions are exclusively by humans.
00:02:54.770 - 00:03:40.980, Speaker A: Emo, it's a platform where only real humans can leave opinions about different topics. There's one human, one account, one opinion. The second one that I would like mention today, it's about government identifications. Following the World bank statistic, more than 1.4 billion people don't have his id or in a physical way. I mean, they don't have id or any passport. This is a whole limitation for those people.
00:03:40.980 - 00:04:40.310, Speaker A: I mean, just think about it for 1 minute. You need to id, to travel, to vote, that people can vote, that people can travel, can vote, can use credit cards, and of course they can open a bank account. And this is a whole limitation. Without an id, you are the same as a ghost for the system. And here are a curious question, and it's why don't they have the id? Why these people don't they have the id? I think there are four main points that can explain it. The first one is the government inefficiency, high bureaucracy with long and slow process, poor education. And the last one, poverty.
00:04:40.310 - 00:05:27.150, Speaker A: The last what I say, but not least, it's poverty. This is a world problem. Kids, women and men around the world don't have the basic income to survive and to pay his basic needs. We are talking about the 10% of the world population, or 700 million people, or three times the Brazil population. And this is a hug number. So here is where the idea of a universal basic income comes. Uvi.
00:05:27.150 - 00:06:21.080, Speaker A: It's a token that this token is streamed to your wallet when you are registered in the proof of humanity protocol. But the first question that Uvi project have to make it. It's how to control the farmers, how we can be safe of farmers. It's the first question that a project like Uvi have to make. It's for this that Uvi used the proof of humanity protocol. In that way, we can be sure that one human should have one basic income. Should we receive one basic income? I will have more time to explain how the total protocol works, but I will make a short explanation about it.
00:06:21.080 - 00:06:52.502, Speaker A: You have to upload your profile in proof of humanity and stake eth on a smart contract. Other human already registered in the protocol have to vouch him what that means. That means that they see your profile and they check, okay. He don't have any mistake. He's a real human. I will vouch you. Okay? Once this happened, the profile advanced to pending registration.
00:06:52.502 - 00:07:33.962, Speaker A: And this is the challenge period. After that, the human is accepted or registered in the protocol. What that means? Get challenged or get talented. Other human it check in all the profile. The people oblord in the proof of humanity web. If they detect a fault or detect that the human want abuse the protocol, maybe uploading two times his profile or making some mistake, or don't follow the rules. The case is rated by Shuros of Claros.
00:07:33.962 - 00:08:29.822, Speaker A: It's a decentralized justice. In web3, the shurers give a devolution of the case. If the challenger wins, take part of the initial deposit that the human put with his ambition when he stake eth on the smart contract. But if the challenger lose, the human can keep it with his register and be accepted in the protocol. Here are interesting question that a lot of people made and it's why proof of humanity are in conjunction with a universal basic income protocol. And I think in my opinion, that this is because they feedback each other. I mean, the protocol need incentives for the humans and the Uvi need an anti civil attack.
00:08:29.822 - 00:09:17.520, Speaker A: Protocol like proof of humanity is to ensure that one human will receive one basic income. To end with my presentation, I want to keep an opaque question for us to think about it, and it's how we can make a sustainable Uvi with blockchain technology. I know that it's possible, but the question is how we can make it. This is all if anyone have a question for this can ask me there. Thank you for hearing me. And all of these are for the future of simulation. Thank you.
