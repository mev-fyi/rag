00:01:41.070 - 00:02:04.380, Speaker A: Hi, I'm Ren. I'm an engineer at Electrocapital. And today we're going to be talking about some trends in crypto from VC and more from an investing perspective in terms of following developers within the crypto industry. I'll let the others have a chance to introduce themselves, maybe try and keep it to 30 seconds each.
00:02:05.710 - 00:02:15.370, Speaker B: Thank you, Ren. Hi, I'm Celine, principal at Borderless Capital. Borderless invests in mostly crypto infrastructure and also a lot in deepen.
00:02:16.350 - 00:02:27.710, Speaker C: Hello everyone. James, founder and the CEO of DFG. So we are crypto investment firm. So I started company back to 2015. So we right now manage a billion dollar. So we are a long term believer for crypto.
00:02:28.450 - 00:02:41.750, Speaker D: Hi there, I'm Felix, partner at Greenfield Capital. We are a european crypto fund, â‚¬135,000,000 in our latest fund, and we invest across DFI, infrastructure and consumer within crypto.
00:02:43.210 - 00:03:13.070, Speaker A: Great, thanks. So I thought maybe a good place to start. Given the approval of the BTC ETF and the strength of the inflows into the ETF over the past few weeks that we've seen, maybe we can start with talking about the impact of mainstream capital entering crypto. I know James, you spend a lot of time looking at public markets and liquid markets in crypto. So would you mind maybe starting us off with your take on the impact of mainstream capital entering crypto?
00:03:13.490 - 00:03:45.906, Speaker C: Sure. Thanks for the question. So I feel like the ETF approved is pretty big because right now we have the approved guiding in January. Right now it's the end of February where they have more than $7 billion flowing to their bitcoin ETF. People are seeing that the grayscale bitcoin ETF is selling the tokens. Well, that doesn't necessarily saying that the GBDC holder is selling. Maybe they just want to sell in GBDC and exchange for ibid.
00:03:45.906 - 00:04:20.162, Speaker C: Right. They are looking for a lower management fee for that because GBDC is 1.5%, the other is like a 0.2.3%. So they are just looking for lower fees. So the net inflow for bitcoin ETF right now, probably less than two months is more than $7 billion. So I think this is way better data than gold gold ETF, which means that the mainstream capital is very bullish on bitcoin. And we will have also the deadline for a certain ETF in May.
00:04:20.162 - 00:04:56.766, Speaker C: Right. So that will also trigger some more capital flowing to the crypto space and trying to holding buying Easter, basically. So we will see. Overall, I guess my prediction will be somewhere between $30 to $40 billion coming to the industry this year and buying bitcoin or ether. So this is actually pretty important data because we are not just count on the capital in the crypto industry to trigger the bull market, right. So we also have much more mainstream capital coming to the industry to buy this mainstream asset. So this is actually very important to.
00:04:56.788 - 00:05:21.560, Speaker A: The industry from the builder perspective. Have any of you seen builders thinking about building projects in a different way on kind of the assumption that more and more mainstream capital and tradfi rails get built out around crypto? Curious if either Felix or Celine, you've seen cases where builders are thinking a little bit differently about the types of products that they're taking to market.
00:05:24.350 - 00:06:20.940, Speaker D: I think generally builders just maybe to some extent expect prices to increase. And therefore, also whenever we see crypto prices increase and kind of the market sentiment turning more bullish, we see defi yields increase based on increased leverage. And I think one of the big opportunities here and what I'm seeing projects building towards is like building much simpler ux for kind of new DeFi users. And as basically there is much more mainstream attention again on crypto since the bitcoin ETF, I think, heavily legitimizes the industry, actually, and maybe an Ethereum ETF coming up, and I think that draws in a lot more attention and then should, I think, also trickle down towards kind of more crypto native products?
00:06:22.510 - 00:07:11.366, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree. I think now they know that they can go beyond just the crypto audience. So knowing from a communication perspective, how can you actually expand your project to a more traditional mainstream retail that is now coming back? We're still not at that stage of the curve. I had a couple conversations during East Denver is like, are you friends calling you back yet? Some said yes, some said no. But it's also some companies going towards not only crypto VCs, depending on what they're building, and being a little bit less shy about splitting their cap table between crypto VCs and also vcs that might be tackling whatever category they're doing. So overall, it's very good for the market. I think it's reaching the next kind of stage.
00:07:11.366 - 00:07:29.042, Speaker B: We definitely need to be careful about valuations as a lot of capital is coming again and making sure that we stay humble and focus on development. But overall, it's good to have that validation and that stamp from the bigger guys.
00:07:29.096 - 00:08:02.060, Speaker A: So, yeah, switching gears a bit and thinking about as more and more users enter the crypto space today we have Ethereum, Ethereum's L2s we have many, many layer one networks competing with Ethereum and smart contract chains as well. Kind of curious to hear your take on how that competitive dynamic might shake out and how the cross chain type of ecosystem that we have today might play out.
00:08:05.610 - 00:09:41.698, Speaker D: Yeah, I guess there's a lot of debate around two different kind of visions towards how to scale, like the modular thesis with many L2s coming up, app chains in the cosmos ecosystem, I guess other ecosystem also having their different technology stack with multiple parallel kind of separate chains and then the monolithic or integrated stack. And think one of the major trade offs, one of the kind of, I think big advantages of public blockchains or of ethereum generally is composability. And we are sacrificing that with the L two ecosystem currently. And I guess that would speak more for the integrated stack, making it much easier for developers to build composable applications that build on top of each other. And I think that's really the superpower. However, I think more recently there's a lot of buz in developer circles around shared sequencing, where basically it should be possible to have synchronous composability across L2s and kind of reducing that trade off to some extent. And I think another very interesting trend is chain abstraction, where basically as a user, you could have one account on a chain that then opens you up access to multiple different chains.
00:09:41.698 - 00:10:27.720, Speaker D: And as an end user you don't really need to know which chain you're interacting with. And maybe there's some curation layer of what are the chains that have sufficient trust guarantees for that specific end user and then using intent infrastructure for basic users only need to sign messages about what they want to do. And then you have solver networks also across chains, serving the user in an automated way, giving and those solvers competing even and giving the best deals and execution across different chains and layer tools. And I think, yeah, I'm excited about that and I guess we need to see how that plays out.
00:10:30.810 - 00:11:27.146, Speaker C: Yeah, I totally agree with you. And I think crosschain is actually pretty important because we have all the different layer one protocol here, trying to basically solving the scalability issues and say I'm fast, I'm secure, which is great, but it caused a problem is the liquidity is a little bit isolated here. Of course, assurance dominant market, the TbL for assurance around like 40, sorry, $53 billion, but you still have more than $30 billion Tbl elsewhere in Salana, in avalanche, in all these kind of layer one protocols. And we can see liquidity once liquidity become isolated, then it created a problem about if you don't solve the question, then it would be a big problem. Basically I just want to buy, you know, or I just want to trade on the Daxing avalanche or whatever. The liquidity is not good enough. If you aggregate all the liquidity, it will be a much more efficient market.
00:11:27.146 - 00:11:57.262, Speaker C: So that's why crosschain solution is here. And also we can see a lot of big project related to crosschain. Haven't got listed right. Wormhole layer zero. They are not listed, but I calculate a little bit about the market cap, about listed token of crotch and solution somewhere only like a little bit more than $4 billion. So that's way too small for me. We should have a market with a market cap more than probably at least 20 certain billion dollars for crosschain could be bigger.
00:11:57.262 - 00:12:15.240, Speaker C: So that is actually what I see is really crosschain have really good kind of potential to grow in the future. As DFG also invests into some of their crosschain solution like SATA chain. Just getting this on Coinbase and OKX, we are definitely looking for more good cross chain solutions to invest.
00:12:17.850 - 00:12:58.374, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree with you both and love that question more or less. The thesis for this year is very much focused on crosschain infrastructure. We do believe that fragmentation is a massive issue. And each blockchain, whether they're layer ones, L2s, they all have the advantages and their challenges. And I think there is beauty in being able to aggregate the liquidity as well as the users and having a more seamless experience. And so as James mentioned, there is a lot of tools across chain messaging, protocol and bridges that have gone through kind of the cycles and being robust right now. So there is a massive opportunity.
00:12:58.374 - 00:13:58.662, Speaker B: So more or less, we have a strong partnership with wormhole and it's really helping a lot of existing companies as well as new companies kind of thinking about how can they expand. So they might start with one ecosystem and then they want to broaden horizon to unlock different features or having more users. And then there's also solutions that enable better crosschain infrastructure. So just to give a couple example, when we be movement labs, you guys might have gone to modular day that happened a couple of days ago here. And so they enable to code using the move language on different blockchains. So it's a network of move blockchains and they have also different things like shared sequencers, et cetera. And then another example would be noble assets, which enables to bring liquidity directly, native USDC on Cosmos, which has been like a big step for the cosmos ecosystem.
00:13:58.662 - 00:14:20.640, Speaker B: So they have more than 150,000,000 USDC on Cosmos right now. And so solutions like that, that really help kind of aggregating all different ecosystems together, we think are very important, and then we'll see long term what sticks most, but as of today, is how can we be stronger as a crypto ecosystem in general?
00:14:22.150 - 00:15:09.730, Speaker A: Thanks. Another point, maybe also related to the topic of fragmentation, is also the fragmentation and diversification of both crypto users and developers, not only within the US, but abroad. I'm a bit curious to hear your take on what is the difference in terms of the crypto industries within your respective regions. It's quite rare because we have representation from Europe, from Asia, from the US. So maybe providing a different perspective to the builders and developers and founders out there. About some insights from your respective regions that they might not necessarily hear day to day.
00:15:12.260 - 00:16:04.348, Speaker D: Yeah, I think generally we've seen actually a lot of developer influx in Europe, from the US specifically, especially southern Europe. I'm based in Lisbon, for example. Generally as a fund, we are kind of spread out all over Europe, eastern Europe as well, specifically. Traditionally there was like Berlin has been a pretty strong hotspot. Paris as well. I think Berlin specifically being very strong in terms of privacy and having that ethos based also kind of from the older days of spies and kind of protecting against surveillance. And generally, I guess, Europe, it's a very important value also being reflected in regulation, in the GDPR for data protection.
00:16:04.348 - 00:17:15.400, Speaker D: And I guess maybe that's also one reason why Europe has been lagging a little bit in terms of tech traditionally compared to the US, because Europeans are a bit more concerned about data privacy. And I think with crypto, we do have a chance basically to have these distributed organizations that are basically built in many spots at the same time versus having this one center that was Silicon Valley for tech. And, yeah, I think it's a big chance for Europe. And also with Mika regulation, I think it's a step in the right direction to have uniform regulation in Europe at least. And that's one of the big, like, we did a survey, for example, across builders last year, and the number one barrier that was being mentioned is regulatory uncertainty. And I think if we have regulatory certainty or more regulatory certainty, then a lot more builders are actually willing to take the leap, I think, and also corporates and institutions. And I think that will be a big enable.
00:17:17.100 - 00:17:46.176, Speaker C: Yeah, I think we are over. We're in an open, decentralized world. So basically crypto every project, all the investors, people are doing crypto adoptions everywhere in every country. But I think on like a marketing perspective, if you are being localized enough in one country, then you just can do great adoption in this country. It would definitely benefit the project as well as the whole industry. I just give you an example of one of our portfolio called Asta. So the founder is japanese.
00:17:46.176 - 00:18:21.196, Speaker C: It is basically, I would say, probably the blockchain of Japan. So that's what they defend themselves. So the founder I saw actually he's giving a speech at know in Japanese, which I don't understand what he's saying, but I can feel the passion about it and help. Japanese people love Asta. So that's one great example is if you're a project, then make sure that you are going to be focused on the jurisdiction that you are good at. Just do marketing and do adoption. That's going to benefit your project.
00:18:21.196 - 00:18:40.740, Speaker C: Then later on, once you have a solid foundation, I guess you can try to expand and go to other jurisdictions and do more adoption there. So I think that would be a good kind of marketing strategy. And yeah, that's also my advice to the project. Just make sure you have a solid base, then you can expand.
00:18:44.840 - 00:19:23.436, Speaker B: Yeah, on our side, more than 50% of borderless investment are abroad. So we have a very strong base in Latin America. Davis Gaucia, the co founder, is also co founder of Repio, which is the coinbase of Latami, if we will. And so it's interesting because realized, talking to a lot of people, that there's a lot of very powerful projects in that region that might not be known from like a US perspective. I think this is going to keep going. We could see a lot of companies before thought they had to go to Silicon Valley or to the US to actually find funding. And now you see reverse.
00:19:23.436 - 00:20:34.184, Speaker B: It's like actually vcs begging to have access to places like Latam, like India. We have a great team in the audience, actually, they're building on the data side coming from there. So I think it's definitely important to have that communication in person and have that part of the travel. But yeah, we're seeing a lot of that, more acceptance in those regions. And Asia also know Hong Kong and all of those places, the regulations are friendlier and friendlier, but I think there's big shifts, especially Argentina. There was one of the most watched speech at Davos this year and really dabbling down on those markets that we've seen for a long time that had this high potential due to just how big the population is and the problem that they have with inflation, et cetera, and how fast people can adopt new technologies. But I think this year with all the new regulations, it's actually really having a true change from our side.
00:20:34.184 - 00:20:52.000, Speaker B: We're really trying to expand, dabble down on the zones and location that we actually have access to and trying to have that ongate, like that dialogue with also a team in the US that might want to expand in those regions to help them actually have offices there, et cetera.
00:20:53.220 - 00:21:27.370, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes sense. I want to spend maybe the rest of the panel talking about some of the areas that you all think are coming next. So whether it's something like Zpin, crypto, AI, BTCL, two s, maybe what's one area that you're looking into currently or you think will be the next wave of either on the protocol side, the infrastructure side, or the application side for this year, next year and the year after.
00:21:31.780 - 00:22:58.648, Speaker D: I can start, I guess I briefly touched upon it earlier. I think one big enabler for better user experience and also actually bringing new or better business models towards interfaces and aggregators is intense. Where we have been investing in that segment, looking further into it basically, where I guess there's a big opportunity. I think that currently there's a lot of value being leaked to the infrastructure layer, to the layer ones through kind of MEV and block space is kind of increasingly bidded up for. And if you can have order flow auctions and similar things like that at the solver layer kind of towards the front end, and an interface in aggregators, then you can return actually much more of that value towards the end user. And I think aggregators can capture some of that value. And overall I would say we're building, or I guess from the get go, we're kind of committed to building DeFi as a new financial system that's more resilient, that's more transparent, you can verify inputs and outputs in a much clearer way to reduce counterparty risk, systemic risk in general.
00:22:58.648 - 00:23:39.940, Speaker D: And so far we've seen some real world assets being onboarded onto crypto rails. But I think yeah, that will be, for me personally, that's like the end game, that we basically represent realwood assets to a much greater extent on chain and leverage. That infrastructure that has been built over the years and that has continued to be built ultimately to provide a lower cost of capital to businesses and better risk adjusted returns to investors based on just the efficiency gains, more transparency, automation, lower counterparty risk. What I mentioned and yeah, that's one of the segments that we're investing.
00:23:40.440 - 00:24:22.868, Speaker C: Yeah, I think overall speaking, we have a pretty healthy competition here with the new narrative about DP and AI become very popular, actually force. Some of the mainstream project belongs to so called old narratives make a lot of positive change. For example, we see Makerdao using the treasury to buy back the tokens. We also recently the uniswap deploying really actually share their protocol fees to all the token holders when they do staking. So actually I'm not sure whether if we don't have this kind of narrative then the capital don't flow into them. Maybe it will, at least not. At least not that quick for this kind of mainstream project to make this positive change.
00:24:22.868 - 00:25:11.556, Speaker C: So overall speaking, I think we are in a pretty healthy competition model. I'm pretty sure in the next kind of this year or probably next year, we will see also the growth about old narrative, so called old narrative like DeFi, because they're making positive change also NFT and gaming as well. Taking NFT as an example, there's one company we invest called patchy penguins. They do very good kind of adoptions and board ape seems to me a little bit stuck there. So then it refers to the second market. Then actually the price per patch penway is just flipped bot ape like a month ago. So it's actually about old narrative like Defi, gaming, NFT, these kind of things.
00:25:11.556 - 00:25:49.340, Speaker C: You need to have either innovation or making positive change for this to grow. Right? So with the new narrative pushing you for that, I will pretty much sure we will still see the growth of this old narrative. With the new narrative beyond the deepen and AI, I think there could be something, we may not even think about that right now. They could become super popular like six months later. We just don't know about it. I'm thinking about whether we can put in for example like biotech data on chain or things like that. Right? So it should be something that people haven't think about, which probably are not entirely bullshit.
00:25:49.340 - 00:25:59.510, Speaker C: Right. And then this could be the potential next narrative. But I'm not just sure about what that is. But I'm pretty sure there will be a new narrative beyond deep in and AI as well.
00:26:02.040 - 00:26:39.084, Speaker B: Yeah. To double down on deep in I think is really interesting because of the launch of helium mobile this year that has really kind of made a big splash. And now you can get this like five dollar plan in the US which is unseen. And that's really breakthrough innovation in the telecom space. Deep in is something that's helping going back to mainstream adoption and what is the capital and just the acceptance of mainstream growth to do. I think this is something that's very easy to understand for people. It's not easy in terms of the application and how do you create the tokenomics, et cetera.
00:26:39.084 - 00:27:51.416, Speaker B: They've gone through a lot of iteration and the meat and burn and this equilibrium for different companies that they have to think about that very deeply before launching a deep in project. So when you look at some of, whether it's hive mapper or helium, it's like, how do you think about deploying different hotspot or different devices in different locations? And how do you make sure that there's not too much in one location, and then you have an oversupply in one location and you need to give all those tokens and then there's all those problems. All of that is being thought through very deeply right now, and this is making breakthrough changes. There's so many other interesting application, decentralized GNNs for geolocation, flight trackers, and yeah, a lot of them that we don't even think about that are very industry specific. Something else that is also going to take longer. But fhe, like fully homomorphic encryption is something that we're looking at. I think it's still quite early and we're learning in that category, but that's quite interesting.
00:27:51.416 - 00:28:13.550, Speaker B: Also, development on the privacy side with evolution on the zk side, that's something that's quite interesting. And then, yeah, we don't know what we don't know. And there's always a narrative that pops up and that's taking all over Twitter or acts that we never thought about before. So that's good that we're going to have that.
00:28:16.580 - 00:28:57.470, Speaker A: To dig a bit deeper. So crypto as an industry oftentimes gravitates towards things that are net new. We always have these new narratives that always seem to take the industry by storm. When thinking much longer term, sometimes it's easier to think about the aspects of either human psychology or the industry or the underlying technology that are invariant. So what might be some aspects of crypto, whether it's user behavior, whether it's something about the underlying blockchain technologies that you think will not change, or that type of behavior will not change over 510 years?
00:28:59.280 - 00:29:57.490, Speaker D: Yeah, I touched upon it briefly. I think what will not change is that investors will always want to optimize risk adjusted returns and businesses will always want to raise capital at the lowest cost of capital and as fast as possible. And I think defi ultimately can optimize that and bring different parties together on a global marketplace. And maybe one more thing in that respect and also relating to privacy, what you mentioned, I think compliance is a really important puzzle piece and we have been investing in that segment as well. But I think it's super important that we still kind of can square that with privacy as far as possible. And I think privacy is important for everyone, but I think especially for businesses and institutions, it's super important because you don't want to reveal all your activity on chain to your competitors. And I think that's also not going to change.
00:29:57.490 - 00:30:16.390, Speaker D: And I really like the quote, privacy tech is collaboration tech, because if you can keep your data private, but still kind of prove certain aspects about what are you willing to do or even contribute to privacy preserving machine learning, that's powerful. I think.
00:30:17.320 - 00:30:52.960, Speaker C: Yeah, I think over speaking, the innovation is the only thing that I think won't change in the crypto industry because the industry changed so fast. And if you do very good in the last borrowing, if you get stuck there and lying on what you have achieved, then you probably won't do anything good in the next border. Right? So this is really important because innovation always happen in this industry. So you just cannot stop building, not stop thinking about new things to build and problems to solve. I think that's the beauty of the industry.
00:30:56.280 - 00:30:59.350, Speaker B: Nothing specific to add. It was quite complete.
00:31:02.730 - 00:31:27.120, Speaker A: Maybe the second last topic, when there's obviously a lot happening in crypto, a lot of different sectors and areas that builders are building for. What are some of the ways that you keep on top of developers in terms of following developers, where development activity is going, and just trying to hone in different areas that you want to spend time on.
00:31:29.170 - 00:32:45.106, Speaker B: We're definitely grateful for Electric Capital's report, first of all, and I think it's just having ongoing conversations with portfolio companies, they're the best reporters of what's going on in different ecosystem from a tech perspective, and also political perspective, because there's always some of that in terms of the tech. One thing that might not change is also the fact that there's always, as in any industry, any company, there's always some political aspect, but that's also the beauty of open tools, there's always room for change on that side. And so, yeah, I think making sure you have enough bandwidth, whether it's a person internally that's wearing the platform hat in terms of the platform role. So portfolio management or having one of the partners in charge, making sure they allocate that time is very important. And yeah, all the best information we have is really from the portfolio companies. So there's obviously on chain data and you can look at doing dashboard, et cetera, to just have kind of raw data and then to kind of understand a little bit more in terms of the depth. It's just having this kind of off the record conversation with builders and also protocols.
00:32:45.106 - 00:33:31.220, Speaker B: So we like it borrows to collaborate with so many protocols that actually invest in funds and that we invested in the ecosystem. Whether it's anything from Aptos, Polygon, Monad I mentioned move earlier and so kind of having that and also talking to other fellow VC firms that we do a lot of collaboration with and sharing those perspectives on what they are seeing on their side on different parts of the world. So things just like communication is key and everything that you should keep the best deals for yourself and that once you put a check in the company that's it. And hope it's going to ten X or 100 x or 1000 X. It's just key for success is really communication plays a big part.
00:33:31.910 - 00:34:20.782, Speaker C: Yeah, I totally agree. For us, we also want to make sure we use all the product. So once we have use of the product we know definitely the update and also what seems to improve, what seems to already be. I'm not a tech background, but our CTO, he do a lot of due diligence on the GitHub account, check the update of GitHub, that's also important. I learned a lot from him. Yeah, I think just like being more practical and using the product check the code is really the most realistic way for you to learn more information. And also as you mentioned, that talking to different people, talking to different VCs, different builders also help us learn a lot about the new ideas, new narrative, new thinkings about industry.
00:34:20.782 - 00:34:32.970, Speaker C: So yeah, on one hand I think just stay at home, do more due diligence using the product. On the other hand, just go out, talk to more people. I think both strategy are actually very useful for getting new info.
00:34:34.190 - 00:34:58.020, Speaker D: Yeah, I will just very briefly comment. Also portfolio founders, they make the best introductions usually. And events like if Denver, they're super cool, like immersing yourself with developers, like talking to hackers. And I guess you can do your research online, but I guess just randomly stumbling into some interesting people at a conference also is always good.
00:34:58.550 - 00:35:16.120, Speaker A: Great, we have 1 minute left for the folks who stuck around for the whole panel. Definitely appreciate it. Maybe in 15 seconds each. What's one contrarian or spicy take to end the panel on just hold?
00:35:17.690 - 00:35:46.590, Speaker D: I think we need better governance in crypto that goes beyond code is law and token holder voting and multisigs. And I think we have invested into one project called Q that does arbitration rooted in international private law, where you can have basically nuanced judgment for overseeing governance and providing shared governance security. And I think, yeah, that's going to be a big unlock to bring the credibility for mainstream adoption.
00:35:47.970 - 00:36:03.842, Speaker B: Yeah. On our side, just the big bet that we're making on interoperability could sometimes be seen as contrarian, usually our PQ ecosystem, or at least a couple of them, we're staying pretty agnostic. So that could be seen controlling.
00:36:03.986 - 00:36:04.390, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:36:04.460 - 00:36:15.782, Speaker A: Great. Thanks. Thank you, panelists, for your time today. Definitely not easy to take 35 minutes out of the busy conference week. So definitely appreciate it. Thank you.
00:36:15.916 - 00:36:16.454, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:36:16.492 - 00:36:16.998, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:36:17.084 - 00:36:17.960, Speaker D: Thank you.
