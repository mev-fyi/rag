00:00:00.330 - 00:00:30.120, Speaker A: All right. My name is Chester Bella. I'm one of the founding members of Parifi. Parifi is a perpetual protocol that focuses on bringing parity between all different market participants. Today's presentation, we're going to speak a little bit more about exploring the use cases of perpetual protocol in DeFi, so it will be more general. And towards the end, we're going to speak a little bit more about what we have been up to. A little bit about myself.
00:00:30.120 - 00:01:10.850, Speaker A: I've been involved in crypto since 2013. Initially as a market participant. Around 2017, I started to work on product research, product ideas, and prior to that I was working in trade Phi at N 26, which is in Germany or in Europe, one of the fastest growing mobile banks. After that, I was working for Hyperpod, which is B two B fintech company that focuses on mortgage aggregation for banks and brokers so they can offer their retail or end consumers the best mortgage offerings.
00:01:11.350 - 00:01:38.890, Speaker B: Good afternoon everyone. My name is Danny Borhan. I would also like to do a short introduction about myself. I got into the DFI space around 2017. In terms of my background, I actually worked at n 26 as well, similar as Chester, and was in an antimoney laundry unit. And later on I worked in fintech, providing mortgage aggregation for banks and also partners and end users.
00:01:39.870 - 00:02:17.560, Speaker A: All right, a little bit about the agenda. So this is pretty much the overview. We're going to speak a little bit about what perpetual protocols are, about the advantage and challenges that perpetual protocols might face towards the end. We're going to conclude it with some examples and potentials that we see and summarize a little bit what we have been up to and improvements that we see moving forward. What are perpetual protocols? Is anyone aware of what perpetual protocols are? Hands up. All right, okay. Quite a few people.
00:02:17.560 - 00:03:24.830, Speaker A: Well, what are perpetual protocols? Perpetual protocols are blockchain based financial products that enable traders, but also protocols to trade on derivatives without any expiry date. And unlike traditional future contracts, it allows people to pretty much hold their position without any set expiry date in the future. And one of the cool things about perpetual protocols is that it is, generally speaking, they have lower fees due to the fact that you don't have a lot of fees, such as rollover fees or custody fees that are normally applicable to trading future derivatives. And if we are comparing perpetual protocols that are out there, generally speaking, you have two types of perpetual protocols. One that uses an order book. One example would be DydX. And on the other hand, you have perpetual protocols such as SNX, synthetics, or GMX that have an amm to facilitate trade and markets.
00:03:26.210 - 00:03:51.800, Speaker B: Awesome. Now we're going to dive a little bit in to discuss the key findings of perpetual contracts and also future contracts. So with perpetual contracts, there is no expiry date. With future contracts, there is actually expiry dates. So another aspect as well that we should look into is the leverage. With leverage, it do occurs on both financial products as well.
00:03:52.490 - 00:04:25.006, Speaker A: And yes, price overcrowdes is, of course, one of the key factors that is important for perpetual protocols. Ideally, you would like a protocol to use on chain oracles that are less susceptible to manipulation. And on the other hand, you have traditional brokers that normally use centralized price data that are more susceptible to manipulation. And that's why we see that there's clear an advantage of utilizing perpetual protocols.
00:04:25.118 - 00:04:58.330, Speaker B: Yes. So trading fees occurs on both financial products. So there's a key difference in terms of with perpetuals, the trading fees are a bit lower than on future contracts. However, both of them occurs. The one advantage on perpetual contracts is actually that there's no rollover fees that needs to be paid. And also, when it comes to the funding rate, both occurs on both products as well. It makes sure that the shorts and longs are actually being in a healthy ratio.
00:04:59.630 - 00:05:45.130, Speaker A: All right, this is an overview of a few popular perpetual protocols. We use three examples and we differentiate. We will go more in depth about the features and how they are different. On one hand, you have DydX, of course, GMX and synthetics. I think one of the cool things is that some perpetual protocols allow you to trade assets beyond crypto, such as SNX, in form of synthetic access, which is really cool because it brings flexibility in the exposure one can have, because synthetic assets can come in the form of commodities, forex, et cetera. Pretty much anything that has a price feed.
00:05:47.310 - 00:06:18.466, Speaker B: Yes. So also the architecture is a bit different, as Chester mentioned before. So, for example, on DYDX, they do have an order book approach with GMX, and also synthetic, they do have AmM approach. And as well, there's also leverage trading, a possibility that users can make use of. However, they do have different levels of leverage trading due to different risk assessments. When it comes to also to the fee structures, there are different parametrics that they use. So therefore, there's a bit of change.
00:06:18.466 - 00:06:25.720, Speaker B: Now going back to the funding rate, as I mentioned before, it makes sure that the ratio stays in balance in terms of the shorts and the longs that has been taken.
00:06:26.090 - 00:07:08.710, Speaker A: Yeah. And another, I think, cool thing is that perpetual protocols can be deployed on multiple EVM chains. Obviously, one example is, I mean, DyDX is deployed on StockX, which is a layer two solution, which is a little bit less sexy, in my opinion, because it makes it less composable for people to build financial products on top of their existing protocols. And on the other hand, you have, of course, GMX and synthetics that are deployed on multiple EVM chains, allowing other products as well to build new financial products and also just take advantage from all the composability advantages that it brings.
00:07:09.370 - 00:07:19.020, Speaker B: Yes. So how can perpetual protocols be used in defi applications? Does any one of you guys have an idea or any protocol in mind or in the project?
00:07:19.630 - 00:07:24.460, Speaker A: Any idea beyond regular trading? Does anyone have any idea?
00:07:26.030 - 00:07:27.260, Speaker B: Well, no problem.
00:07:32.150 - 00:07:36.530, Speaker A: Certainly for forex to help limit FX devaluation risk.
00:07:37.030 - 00:07:38.420, Speaker B: Yes, that's correct.
00:07:40.790 - 00:07:58.054, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, one thing is, with the emergence of perpetual protocols, it allowed as well, pretty much a new space to emerge that allows people to create new marketplaces, but also new financial instruments. Yes.
00:07:58.092 - 00:08:36.590, Speaker B: So we have three examples of the marketplaces. So first of all is weather derivatives. So weather derivatives is that actually user is able to hedge against the weather conditions that would change. And then also there is carbon credits. So carbon credits can also be hedge or also a position that a trader can hold in order to see if the project or the trade that he's holding is more environmental friendly. And then there's also intellectual properties. With intellectual properties, there are two consistents of it.
00:08:36.590 - 00:08:49.190, Speaker B: Once is, first, the trademarks, and another one is pattern. And the nice thing about it is that everyone who is actually an innovator and also a creator can make sure and monetize on those market spaces.
00:08:49.350 - 00:09:47.078, Speaker A: Well, one more thing is with new marketplaces, potentially new financial instruments emerge. And one of the things that Danny kind of alluded already is that you might have being the ability to trade derivatives that are not directly impacted by the weather, but somehow indirectly. If I take one example, for example, let's say there's a country where there is a drought, the drought has impact on the crop and whatever vegetable is being grown. And this will unfortunately probably have some impact, some form of impact on the vegetable or the crop. So this might open a window of opportunity in order to allow us where people to potentially trade on this particular price. Right. That might come from instances like that, from that vegetable.
00:09:47.078 - 00:09:47.642, Speaker A: Yes.
00:09:47.696 - 00:10:45.270, Speaker B: There are also other scenarios. For example, when it comes to carbon, another scenario could be that a trader can actually manage his position on, let's say, an airline company, that he feels like they are having a good emission policy and also less emission print. And then what he can do is to make sure that his future or his contract, he can hold it, and once it's in a positive, he can either sell it or buy it. And then also when it comes to intellectual property, into the electoral 1 second, when it comes to the intellectual property, another thing is that actually someone who is bidding on trademarks or any other intellectual properties that go up in the near future, what they can do is they can actually sell them on a later stage and then the creator and innovator will actually earn on those sellings.
00:10:47.450 - 00:11:09.510, Speaker A: All right, here are some examples of not necessarily perpetual protocols, but financial defi protocols that are live out there, but that could have been built potentially on top of existing perpetual protocols, although this will require some form of modification for the specific use cases that each protocol requires.
00:11:09.590 - 00:11:35.398, Speaker B: Yes. So hedgek is one, hedge is so far an option that users can use. They can trade cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and also ethereum on it. Then another platform is polymarket. With polymarket you can actually engage into real life events on highly developable topics, and you can make your vote. And if your vote is right, then you will be rewarded. And also opium insurance is very interesting where you actually have tokenized position.
00:11:35.398 - 00:11:45.290, Speaker B: And these tokenized positions can either be against smart contract vulnerabilities or in other cases as well default against stablecoins.
00:11:46.190 - 00:12:47.110, Speaker A: All right, let's talk about the advantage. Well, one of the advantages that I alluded earlier already is the composability. I think that a lot of opportunities emerge from that. One of the things is it enables, of course users, but also protocol builders to really build new financial primitives by combining multiple protocols. And of course enhanced liquidity utilization might derive from that. If we take an example where you have two protocols that collaborate together and deepen the liquidity, this can of course raise the capital efficiency, but also create passive earnings opportunities for liquidity providers. And of course then you have the lower fees, as I mentioned already, with perpetual protocols via a few fees that are not applicable, such as rollover fees, custody fees that are normally applicable when trading future contracts.
00:12:47.110 - 00:12:49.580, Speaker A: And this is one of the cool things.
00:12:50.770 - 00:13:19.400, Speaker B: So transparency is also very important. Users can actually, before they interact with the perpetual protocol, they can go GitHub had a look at their smart contract, they can see the audits, they can also have a look at the interface before actually participating. And another thing which is very important also in this space is that true ownership is important and also financial sovereignty. So the user is actually solely owner of these funds, he can deposit and withdraw his funds at any time. Giving.
00:13:20.170 - 00:13:49.418, Speaker A: Let's talk about the challenges. Well, unfortunately, there are also some challenges that arise that come from being composable or building on composable primitives. And one of the things is of course the dependency risk, because some problems might lead to liquidity fragmentation. If we are taking one example where let's say two protocols are, well, actually.
00:13:49.604 - 00:14:06.742, Speaker B: Shared liquidity pool, they could come to a scenario where, let's say liquidity pool, where the protocol a doesn't have access to the liquidity pool pool b, and what does it do is that end user is actually unable to execute a transaction on their platform.
00:14:06.876 - 00:14:54.174, Speaker A: And if we are talking about downtimes, we are not necessarily talking about downtimes in the context of a server being down. More, in instances where a protocol is potentially exploited or for whatever reason has to be halted, this can obviously lead to situations where liquidity is not necessarily immediately available for the people that are on the protocol a. In that example. And of course then we have the complexity building with multiple protocols, build some complexities that might arise, that might open new attack vectors to exploit smart contracts that could of course lead to user funds being lost. So this is one of the things I think we should pay more attention.
00:14:54.302 - 00:15:18.270, Speaker B: Yes, Dennis, there's also integration risk. Integration risks can occur when, for example, there is a fraudulent protocol website which looks similar to the original one, and a non technical user gets on board on it and actually may cause that funds to be in loss on that as well. And also inacquited audits can also be a source of suspicions where a user will be vulnerable.
00:15:19.010 - 00:15:56.566, Speaker A: All right, let's talk about the potential and the impact. One of the things, of course, is reducing information asymmetry. I think this is one of the cool things that blockchain building on top of the blockchain brings. I think it reduces as well. It brings an even level playing field for all market participants. I think this is one of the things that is cool, of course, enhanced liquidity. I think it's really cool that we are now in a time where we can really build on top of existing protocols, especially like for new projects.
00:15:56.566 - 00:16:20.990, Speaker A: It allows them as well to utilize well, they don't need to necessarily bootstrap their liquidity from scratch so they can tap into the existing liquidity of certain protocols. And of course this leads to better price executions in the context of perpetual protocols, because the deeper the liquidity is, the better the prices, the less slippage.
00:16:21.150 - 00:16:32.694, Speaker B: Yes, passive yield opportunities gives actually traders also the possibility to be a market maker where they can actually deploy assets into the liquidity pool and earn on passive earnings as well.
00:16:32.812 - 00:17:14.660, Speaker A: Yeah, and if we are talking about adoption, I think perpetual protocols have really the potential to lower the entry of barrier. If I take myself as an example, my parents are originally from Congo and I can tell you for sure that people in Congo don't have the possibility to actually participate on the open market. This is due to many reasons such as not having the right documentation to be able to access certain financial products. And I believe as the industry is evolving and the better we can improve the user experience, the more we might potentially be able to onboard the next 1 billion people.
00:17:15.910 - 00:17:37.578, Speaker B: Yes. Let's head over to conclusion and key takeaways. So, advantages, as said before, enhanced liquidity. Make sure that users are actually getting better prices and also the orders are being matched. And then as well, the possibility of combining different protocols together gives the users also new experience as well.
00:17:37.744 - 00:18:34.730, Speaker A: Yeah, but one thing has to be mentioned. Dependency risk is unfortunately still something that needs to be kept in mind when building on these primitives that are fairly new. And of course, as I mentioned earlier, we think we can really democratize finance and lower the entry of barrier for a lot of people that don't have access to certain financial services. All right, before we wrap up, I just wanted to mention, as I mentioned earlier, we are currently building ourselves a perpetual protocol where we are changing a few things that we see as flawed. For example, for the pricing. What we are doing now is using a gaussian formula and on chain oracles actually to augment the prices. And one of the cool thing is that the ratios are self adjustable based on the utilization of the actual pools and how many longs and shorts are open.
00:18:34.730 - 00:19:15.530, Speaker A: Basically the ratio. For example, we think that a perpetual protocol that is built on top, that uses an AMM approach to make markets should not have funding rates. We don't think that the funding rates should be charged between the traders. Since the liquidity providers actually be at the highest risk. We believe that we should charge a borrowing rate. They should go to the liquidity providers to incentivize the right market behavior. It doesn't make any sense that the longs and shorts are kind of trying to balance out the ratio.
00:19:15.530 - 00:19:39.426, Speaker A: And yeah, of course, as I mentioned, we believe with what we have been currently building, we might be on something. So we're going to publish in the upcoming weeks a little bit more details about how the formula works and how it might be helpful. And yeah, that's pretty much comes it up.
