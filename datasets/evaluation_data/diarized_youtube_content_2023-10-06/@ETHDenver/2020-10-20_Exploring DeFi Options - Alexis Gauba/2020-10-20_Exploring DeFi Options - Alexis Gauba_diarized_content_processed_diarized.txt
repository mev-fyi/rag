00:00:00.410 - 00:00:13.790, Speaker A: Up next, we have one of my favorite people in crypto space, Alexis Gava. She's going to be talking to us about dfi options. Hi, Alexis.
00:00:14.370 - 00:00:17.374, Speaker B: Hey, Mariano. So good to see you.
00:00:17.572 - 00:00:24.720, Speaker A: It's good to see you as well. So you recently launched v two of open, right?
00:00:25.130 - 00:00:28.040, Speaker B: Yes, not too long ago, just about a month ago.
00:00:29.210 - 00:00:31.298, Speaker A: So congratulations.
00:00:31.474 - 00:00:32.246, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:00:32.348 - 00:00:42.838, Speaker A: Following that, and I can't wait to see what you talk about today. So with that, I'm going to leave you to do your presentation. Best of luck.
00:00:42.934 - 00:01:33.820, Speaker B: Good. Thanks, Mariano. Thanks for the kind words. Very excited to chat with everybody today about DeFi options. So we'll be talking a little bit about what options are and then also how they fit into this whole DeFi landscape, so we can go ahead and dive right in. So the premise of this talk is we're going to chat a little bit about how one of Defi's killer apps will be derivatives, and then we'll hop into options in particular, and we'll talk about how not only are options going to be a big unlock for DeFi, but how DeFi can be a big unlock for options in general, which is pretty exciting. Options are these traditional finance primitives that have been around for so long, but with DeFi, we actually have ways to elevate them to the next level, and we'll kind of dive into that a little bit today.
00:01:33.820 - 00:02:38.458, Speaker B: So let's start with what are options? So options are a derivative instrument, and we'll chat a little bit more about what a derivative instrument is in a second. But in terms of how people use options, people will often use options as tools for protection and financial insurance, and they can also be used for speculation. And because options have this wide variety of use cases, they create this massive market where we're seeing over $300 trillion in yearly volume for these instruments. And these are extremely, extremely versatile, which we talked a little bit about earlier, but we'll get into a bit more. So, in terms of the versatility of options, they just have a ton of different use cases, and I'll mention a couple of interesting ones right now. So one really interesting example is that using options, you can remove risk from different portfolios. So say I have a portfolio of a number of different financial instruments.
00:02:38.458 - 00:03:22.970, Speaker B: I can use options to create a risk free rate, which can basically help me remove risk from my portfolio. The other thing that you can do is you can remove risk from trading options themselves using a strategy called delta hedging. Another exciting thing that you can do with options is trade on volatility itself. So as we know, especially in crypto, we see a bunch of different volatility. But an interesting thing that options kind of let you do is trade on this volatility itself, without necessarily taking a bet on the direction. So you can hedge yourself against volatility. You can speculate based on what you think will happen with volatility.
00:03:22.970 - 00:04:00.886, Speaker B: So options kind of give this really cool volatility playground. And then the other thing is that you can create any other payoff in the world just using options, which is kind of crazy. So there's this theorem that shows that using options, you can create any other payoff. So it kind of makes them the ultimate synthetic. And I think we're just scratching the surface of what we can do with options. So we've been talking about what options can do, but now we can go back and kind of get into what is an option. And an option is a type of financial instrument called a derivative.
00:04:00.886 - 00:04:54.826, Speaker B: And a derivative, unlike a typical asset like ETh or bitcoin, which we can call underlying assets, a derivative derives its value entirely from this underlying asset. So I could have a future on ETH, or an option on ETH. And that future or option, that derivative asset, gets its value entirely from the underlying asset, which in this example is ETH. So the derivatives that you all might be most familiar with are probably options and futures. These are the ones that are the most popular that we talk about most. And the similarity between both of these different derivatives is they're both based on a future trade, which hasn't even happened yet. So with a futures contract, you've got a buyer and a seller, and both of these parties are obligated to make a trade in the future.
00:04:54.826 - 00:05:32.198, Speaker B: Say they're exchanging ETH for USDC. So one of them is buying that ETH using USDC, and the other one is selling that Eth. So in this case, both of the different parties, the buyer and the seller, are obligated into this trade in the future. So upon expiry, one of them is going to make a loss. ETH price will have gone a certain way, but they'll both still be obligated to make that trade. So typically, there isn't any kind of upfront premium, because with a future, both of these people have this obligation. So now let's kind of look at options and see how they're a bit different in options.
00:05:32.198 - 00:06:17.302, Speaker B: Kind of like the name suggests, one side has an obligation and the other side has an option. So the person selling the option has to make the trade of the future. They have this obligation, but the person buying the option is the one that has this option. So the person buying the option can decide if they want to make the trade in the future, but they're not obligated. And because the person buying the option has this choice upon whether they want to make this trade in the future, they have to pay a premium for that optionality or for that choice, you can kind of think about it in life. It's like really nice to have a bunch of options. It's the same in the finance world, where the more options kind of the better.
00:06:17.302 - 00:06:52.640, Speaker B: And so you do have to pay extra for that optionality. So there are two main kinds of options. There are put options and call options. And so let's chat a little bit about what each of these options are. So a put option is the option to sell an underlying asset, for example, ETH, for a specific price, which we call the strike price. And this is helpful when you think that an asset could go down in price. So let's take an example.
00:06:52.640 - 00:07:44.820, Speaker B: Say we have ETH at $1,000, and I'm afraid that I might wake up in sometime in the next couple of weeks, and ETH will have fallen to $500. What I can do is I can use this put option. I can go buy one, which gives me the right to sell ETH for $1,000 upon the expiry date. So in that situation, at expiry, if ETh is at $500, I can still sell my ETH for $1,000 using this put option. So I've given myself this hedging against ETH price falling. Now, on the other side, we have call options and call options give me the option to buy the underlying asset ETH for a specific price, which again, is called the strike price. And this is pretty useful for when you think the asset is going to increase in value.
00:07:44.820 - 00:08:13.100, Speaker B: So say that I think ETH is going to go up. I'm bullish on ETH. Maybe I buy a call option for $2,000. So then say that ETH has this massive bull run. ETH goes up to $5,000. I can still buy ETH for $2,000 by using my call option, even if it's worth a lot more on the market. And so that is kind of the power of call options.
00:08:13.100 - 00:08:57.654, Speaker B: So I want to just chat quickly about one of the common misconceptions. So the opposite of buying a put is not buying a call, it is selling a put. So there are kind of four different payoffs that we're looking at here, you can buy a put, you can sell a put, and then you can buy a call, and you can sell a call. And each of these four different actions has a distinct payoff. So as a reminder, when you're buying the option, you're paying the premium for the optionality, but when you're selling the option, you are getting paid that premium to take on the obligation. So just to keep in mind that there are those four different payoffs. Okay, cool.
00:08:57.654 - 00:09:37.490, Speaker B: So we kind of already chatted about an example a little bit, but let's look at this example that we were talking about earlier where we had this put option, where we had a strike price of 1000 USDC, and this was a put option on ETH. Say it's expiring on February 26. So as the buyer or the holder of this put option, I can sell ETH for $1,000 upon expiry on February 26. So I'm basically creating a price floor for myself. And we can see that this kind of gives me an asymmetric upside payoff. So in this case, as ETH is going up in value, I'm still holding my ETH. It's making me money as it goes up.
00:09:37.490 - 00:10:15.154, Speaker B: But in the case that there's some sort of event where eth goes down in value, I've kind of capped myself here at $1,000. So $1,000 using this put option is the lowest that I'd be selling my ETH for. So we've talked about buying puts and buying options, and it seems pretty clear, like, hey, if I were to buy an option, it gives me this optionality. I've got this asymmetric upside. Seems like a pretty good situation. So you might be thinking, now, why would I sell a put option? So let's chat about the other side of this trade a little bit. So it looks like we're looking at a different put option.
00:10:15.154 - 00:11:03.966, Speaker B: We're looking at a 200 strike USDC ETH put option expiring on December 31. But regardless of kind of which option, when you're selling the put option, you're believing that, hey, EtH is probably going to go up in value. So if I sell this put option, if eth goes down in value, if eth hits $200, in this situation, the holder of the option is going to exercise. So I'm going to have to sell ETH to them at that price. But if I think EtH is going to go up in value, then I can earn a premium for selling this option. And if ETH continues to increase in value, I won't have to exercise basically, or I won't have to be exercised. I can just redeem my collateral and head on my way.
00:11:03.966 - 00:12:13.094, Speaker B: And like I kind of mentioned, there's a number of different reasons why people will be selling puts it's a way to monetize your views if you believe that ETH will go up. And some people even see it as monetizing a limit order depending on the kind of settlement for an option, sometimes upon exercise, as an option seller, basically you'd be putting down USDC as collateral, and then if it's physical settlement, upon exercise, you'd receive the option buyer's ETH while they receive your USDC. So if it's that kind of settlement, some people see it as a way to monetize limit orders. Okay, so now how are options typically traded and treated in traditional finance? So in traditional finance, it's pretty similar to other financial instruments. If I want to trade a stock, I could go to the New York Stock Exchange, which is a centralized exchange. If I want to trade an option, I could go to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or the CME or the Chicago Board options Exchange and I could trade on these centralized exchanges. And they run as you typically think they would.
00:12:13.094 - 00:12:51.460, Speaker B: They've got a centralized operator, classic centralized exchange situation. But what's really interesting is that in centralized finance, the other way, which is even more popular to trade options is OTC, or over the counter trading. And so this is where people are making legal deals for large derivatives off an exchange. So these are never touching the exchange in the first place. And people talk a lot about how DeFi is going to impact centralized exchanges. We're seeing this incredible Dex boom, but we don't talk as much about OTC. So I want to just spend a couple of minutes chatting about that.
00:12:51.460 - 00:13:44.050, Speaker B: Okay, so to understand this better, let's chat about kind of why people do OTC trading in the first place in traditional finance. So there are a couple of key reasons. One is slippage. So if I'm like a big whale, I've got a bunch of money for me to go to the centralized exchange or the decentralized exchange, there might just not be enough liquidity there to handle the amount that I'd want to sell. And so I could actually get a better price by negotiating with someone else who's willing to do this over the counter trade with me. The other reason that people typically think about doing this is for customization purposes. If I'm making this OTC trade, I can choose any strike, any expiry, any underlying asset, I can think about different exotic kinds of options.
00:13:44.050 - 00:14:24.910, Speaker B: So it gives me a lot of freedom in the kind of instrument that I'm trying to purchase. The next thing is collateral. So say that I am actually conducting this OTC trade with someone who's my friend, who I trust, then maybe we can actually reduce our collateral requirements a little bit by relying on that trust so I can create a more capital efficient trade. And then another reason is custody. So especially in traditional finance, if I'm trusting some sort of centralized exchange with my funds, maybe I don't want to do that. So an OTC trade is another way for me to kind of not necessarily have to do that. And so the cool thing with ethereum is that it's literally a trusted collateral.
00:14:24.910 - 00:15:11.550, Speaker B: It's a layer where I can settle and it's a layer where I can create arbitrary financial contracts. So it's this huge unlock for OTC trades that I don't think has really been tapped into yet. Because in traditional finance, to create these kind of OTC trades, you're looking at 40 to 60 page legal documents. This whole process, it's kind of gated. You have to know these kind of dealers in order to put on these OTC trades. But in DFI, you can literally just go to a website, create an OTC trade, send your kind of trade filling string to your counterparty, and they can immediately fill it. So this is something that's possible on open with openv two today for options, which is really cool.
00:15:11.550 - 00:16:09.166, Speaker B: So wanted to chat a little bit about this because I think it's exciting and something that will, in one of the key ways that DFI will actually be a big unlock for the option space in general, because it makes the creation of these kind of bespoke trades so much easier. I can just go ahead and put in the strike price and the parameters I want and mint some o tokens which are ERC 20 options, and trade them with a specific counterparty. So we kind of touched on a little bit of stuff today, but there's like a lot more to learn. So we talked about put and call options, we talked about derivatives, we talked about OTC. But if you want to learn more, there's like a whole world of options out there. So to get started, you can go to open Co, where you can trade put and call options on ETH and some other assets. You can join us on discord at slash open Discord.
00:16:09.166 - 00:16:25.030, Speaker B: And that's a great, great place to come ask questions, have discussions I promise it's really friendly and then you can keep up to date with us on Twitter. Awesome. So thanks, y'all. If you have any questions, definitely like ping me on discord. More than happy to chat.
00:16:26.410 - 00:16:36.118, Speaker A: Hey, Alexis, I see a question here in chat says what Oracle's network are you using for your price fees?
00:16:36.294 - 00:16:45.200, Speaker B: Good question. So openv one doesn't use any oracles. It's completely physically settled. But for openv two we're using chain link.
00:16:47.410 - 00:17:12.390, Speaker A: Excellent. And let's see if there are any other questions. It is really interesting options. I didn't understand how they worked up till maybe a couple of months ago. And now with this raging bull market, I mostly had to learn to participate a little bit more efficiently.
00:17:13.210 - 00:17:23.340, Speaker B: Oh, my gosh. Yeah, they're super interesting. There's so much you can do with them. So I think it'll be good to bring more options education and get more people able to use these things.
00:17:24.270 - 00:17:38.800, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. Oh, here's one more. Let me see. Are fees high for options trading or do you need to move that to a layer two?
00:17:39.250 - 00:18:03.560, Speaker B: Very good question. I think kind of like all of DFI is seeing right now, gas is kind of crazy. So just like with any other application that's impacted by the gas situation, options are as well. So eventually I definitely think that all of this is going to need to move to layer two. But for now, I think everyone is trying to make do on layer one as we figure out how to switch over.
00:18:04.810 - 00:18:09.654, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. Do you have a favorite, l two or is that too much alpha?
00:18:09.702 - 00:18:22.960, Speaker B: Oh, my gosh. Honestly, we're still doing a lot of exploring to see what's going to work best. So there isn't like one in particular that we're thinking about at this point, but just trying to explore what's out there.
00:18:24.690 - 00:18:36.930, Speaker A: Great. Let's see. I see one here. Any plans for progressive decentralization?
00:18:37.750 - 00:19:01.130, Speaker B: Very good question. Yeah, so what's really interesting is I got into this space and our whole team kind of got into the space because we were excited about crypto. Our first grant came from a dow, the maker Dow, which is awesome. And so we are definitely huge proponents of community governed protocols. And so it's definitely something that we'd like to work towards progressively.
00:19:02.910 - 00:19:15.386, Speaker A: Yeah, that is perfect. And I think that is the right way to go. There are so many things that. So many moving pieces.
00:19:15.578 - 00:19:16.366, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:19:16.548 - 00:19:27.220, Speaker A: Protocols that when they start out, it's like slowly, slowly giving it away to the community because also you need time to form a community.
00:19:28.390 - 00:19:29.042, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:19:29.176 - 00:19:32.690, Speaker A: Understand and can vote responsibly on things, right?
00:19:32.840 - 00:19:40.870, Speaker B: No, absolutely. I think 100% true. The protocol has to be there and the community has to be there. And so both different elements.
00:19:42.810 - 00:19:55.210, Speaker A: Excellent. Well, I think we're good on questions. Well, there is one more. Where are the benefits of having chain link be an oracle?
00:19:56.430 - 00:20:11.600, Speaker B: Good question. Yeah. So basically with v two we do cash settlement and so we need to get the price of ETH at the very specific time of expiry and Chainlink was able to provide that. So that's kind of the reason that we went with them.
00:20:13.730 - 00:20:28.194, Speaker A: Great. Some question is above. So that was the question of the oracles. Well, I think we're all done with questions. So thank you so much, Alexa.
00:20:28.242 - 00:20:30.280, Speaker B: Absolutely. Thanks for having me.
00:20:30.970 - 00:20:35.240, Speaker A: And yeah, hope to see more of open in the future.
00:20:35.610 - 00:20:38.740, Speaker B: Heck yeah. Thanks so much, Mariano. Bye all. Take care.
