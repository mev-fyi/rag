00:00:13.210 - 00:00:35.000, Speaker A: Hey, everyone. Thanks for coming. So we're here at the latest panel. We're going to talk about DeFi, specifically focusing on composability adoption and what's coming next. So I'm Wilson from Masari, but I'll let everyone else on the panel introduce themselves here.
00:00:35.930 - 00:00:50.570, Speaker B: Hi, I'm Shayla Burroughs. I'm the vp of strategy with radar, very well known for radar relay, but we also are working on a lot of different verticals, such as infrastructure go deploy nodeops, sponsor of Eat Denver.
00:00:51.570 - 00:00:57.630, Speaker C: Hi, I'm Vignesh. I'm the founder of Lendride, and I'm also the chief architect.
00:00:59.730 - 00:01:09.474, Speaker D: I'm Noah, I work at Uniswap. I'm the engineering lead there. We're launching a v two version of the smart contracts quite soon, and so I'm happy to talk about that and all the other fun things that come up.
00:01:09.592 - 00:01:10.580, Speaker A: Please do.
00:01:11.350 - 00:01:24.200, Speaker E: I'm Felix. I'm the co founder, CEO of Set Protocol. We recently launched social Trading, which has been doing pretty awesome. And we are all about kind of spreading DeFi through kind of brands and institutions that people trust.
00:01:24.970 - 00:01:49.754, Speaker A: Excellent. Thank you. All right, so let's get this started. I think first I want to take a little bit of a retrospective look of the last year. And we recently passed a billion dollars locked in DeFi or deposited in DFI. Pretty significant milestone for sure. It definitely shows a lot of user confidence within the Defi sector.
00:01:49.754 - 00:02:08.982, Speaker A: And so what I want to know is, with all of your groups with some boots on the ground, what were some of the catalysts that kind of led to this kind of growth? And is there any sort of concern at the moment that a lot of this money is locked up in a single project at the moment right now?
00:02:09.116 - 00:02:10.342, Speaker B: Can I take this first one?
00:02:10.396 - 00:02:11.240, Speaker C: Go for.
00:02:12.090 - 00:02:52.020, Speaker B: You know, a lot of times we hear about composability, and then there's a reference to money Lego blocks, and we think of it slightly differently. The way that I would think about it is actually not Lego blocks, it's money Jenga. So it's great that we have pulled DFI advocates really deeply into the ecosystem with new and interesting, complex products. But as you and I were talking about a little bit, that $1,000,000,000.60 1% of it is actually locked up in maker, and that's great. But, oh, boy, doesn't that come with a ton of risks? And so that's something that we've had on our minds for a while.
00:02:53.030 - 00:02:53.806, Speaker A: Excellent.
00:02:53.918 - 00:03:35.426, Speaker C: I feel like we are still in this market where it's all driven by speculation, right. So most of the use case of why do you want a loan? And why would you want a loan that you're paying seven or eight percentage interest as a borrower? It's that there are people who feel that the market is going to go up. Right. So that kind of is still the case. And I think that'll be the case for a couple of years. But by then, I guess if this market is going to be a little less speculative, there could be a shift towards lesser interest rates. That also could be very interesting.
00:03:35.426 - 00:03:39.330, Speaker C: But today I feel like the major driver is still speculation.
00:03:41.750 - 00:04:11.174, Speaker D: Interesting for Uniswap in particular is the long tail of assets that we have locked up. So I'd say the vast majority of that 1 billion that's locked up is in a very select few assets. And that's great. That means those assets are very popular and widely demanded and supplied. So that's the good news. The slightly bad news is that sometimes there are mid and small cap assets that aren't fully supported by a lot of the major protocols. And so that's one area in which uniswap shines.
00:04:11.174 - 00:04:51.400, Speaker D: We are completely agnostic to the collateral that comes to the table, except insofar as we do lock people into eth. But that kind of comes with the territory. But we've seen recently an explosion of growth in the liquidity of, again, small and mid cap tokens on uniswap. And often that's actually the only venue for trading and price discovery for these assets. And so that's something that's very interesting that we're excited to see continue. And also in the upcoming version that we have, we're going to be expanding the pool from eth only pairs to arbitrary pairs. And so we're expecting this trend to continue and accelerate, and we'll see where it goes.
00:04:52.410 - 00:05:29.110, Speaker E: Well, these are good points on a really high level, where I see things is that 1 billion is a very good psychological kind of like milestone. I mean, if we really think about it, a lot of it is like SNX as collateral and whatnot. And it might not be legitimately locked and whatnot, but it's a good psychological milestone. And for me, I think it's essentially DeFi is starting to cross the chasm. Right. DeFi historically has been used by very few people today. And I think that was when a lot of the technology had to have proving right maker Dow, like, launched like a year ago, and it proved itself over the course of the bear market that it's something that has worked.
00:05:29.110 - 00:06:18.760, Speaker E: Many other projects have launched in 2019 and have to prove that it's something that actually works economically. It's also something that is secure from a smart contract security perspective. So I think those things kind of help cement DFI as a protocol that people can rely on. And then the second half, as I think, is about education, right? People are starting to realize and understand the value proposition and use cases of these protocols. And I think that's why even though ETH was 300 something dollars in the middle of 2019, the amount of locked in DFI was significantly lower than it is today in the same ETH price. So I think we are able to see kind of this maturity of the system, and I believe that we're starting to try to reach the more mainstream now as we try to get more people onboarded into DeFi, and there's a number of different companies trying to do that.
00:06:20.410 - 00:06:50.286, Speaker A: I appreciate all the answers, and I'm glad you kind of brought up that last point there, Felix, about the billion dollar milestone may not being a perfect metric. And so when you start talking about adoption, what are some of the other metrics that you may use to kind of measure user growth on your platforms, or adoption of your platforms? And how do you take that and determine what are going to be some of the next products or offerings that you're going to put out there? Felix, I'll start with you at the end.
00:06:50.468 - 00:07:32.030, Speaker E: I agree that most protocols, value locked is not a good metric for set. It actually is a great metric because we're kind of an asset management ish type of protocol, and AUm is typically how you would measure progress of that. But I think for other protocols, like lending, you might care more about loans originated or how much interest has been paid. If you're an exchange, you might care more about volume that's been generated or aggregate amount of yield. So I think those are some other metrics. Or if you're thinking about a protocol, you might want to normalize for the price in which users actually got into the locks, started locking, versus also accounting for the price appreciation.
00:07:35.430 - 00:08:19.386, Speaker D: Uniswap. There are a variety of users that we have to kind of optimize around. So there's retail traders, there's arbitragers, there's liquidity providers. So we're always playing this kind of delicate game of balance where we want to provide tools and analytics for all these types of users. And so it is an interesting, actually, problem deciding as a company what you want to focus on. We've spent a lot of time on our kind of retail trader interface. But if the majority of volume isn't coming through there, but it's instead coming through, say, arbitrage bots, which are run on like a CLI or in some type of automated environment, or if they're coming through integrations, other people who have wrote their own kind of plugins to the Uniswap smart contracts, then maybe it's not really that valuable actually to spend so much time on this one particular interface.
00:08:19.386 - 00:08:36.470, Speaker D: And so I think we're excited to see the ways that you can access Uniswap liquidity and defi liquidity in general, expand to a variety of different use cases and really fragment in a good way use cases across all these different areas.
00:08:37.690 - 00:10:00.138, Speaker C: Today in the market, we have interest rates that's usually based on utilization, like utilization on a specific pool. And that one number, which is advertised as the interest rate, I don't believe just carries the interest rate of the currency. It also carries the hidden risk of the system, the hidden risk of the collateral price suddenly collapsing, et cetera. So in this year, probably even what we are working on is trying to split these things apart. So metrics like understanding the actual interest rate or the opportunity cost of a loan currency separately from what would it cost to, say, insure the collateral, right? So it's this year when we are going to have more work done on how do we have a term based loan and things like that. So I find that this year we'll talk more about interest payments being done as a good KPI, because that's real money, right? Like someone is paying someone real money in order to hold a borrowed position. That's a much better metric compared to, say, how much is the total amount locked in DeFi, because it can just be locked in a combination.
00:10:00.138 - 00:10:12.580, Speaker C: So we have the collateral insurance as a parameter on how much it's being paid, and the interest rate that's being interest amounts that's being paid is a great KPI, according to me.
00:10:13.510 - 00:11:06.580, Speaker B: I think it's interesting, a lot of the metrics that we've used demonstrate depth, pulling a lot of previous advocates for DeFi further into the ecosystem. But what I'm really interested in is seeing breadth. I really appreciate how set protocol is trying to actually bring more into the DeFi system. And I think one of the issues with the use cases is that there's inherent complexity, right. You have to understand, first finance, and I would argue for many of these products, really complex financial topics. And then you have to figure out how blockchain and crypto work, and I think that represents a real barrier. So the more that we can do to actually bring and measure, bringing new people into the Defi ecosystem, I think is just as important as measuring a lot of the depth and the continuing interaction that we're starting to see.
00:11:07.590 - 00:12:01.240, Speaker A: So you can kind of tell it depends on the protocol, it's really specific to what you're trying to do. But there are some more general ways that we can start making this a little bit simpler as we go along. All right, Sudnan, you mentioned risk as well. And so what I really wanted to also talk about is the idea of composability. This idea that money Legos or money Djanga with that ability to integrate with multiple protocols, it brings this added utility to each application that you build off of the contrast of that is it adds a substantial amount of risk as well. So how do you approach analyzing risk, of integrating with other apps? And how do you protect against a situation where others can potentially exploit these cross app dependency differences? Noah, I'll start with you.
00:12:03.290 - 00:12:57.558, Speaker D: This is something we're very worried about always as smart contract architects, it's kind of our number one concern, and it's easier, I should say, to take a bit of a siloed view and just say that we're only going to care about Uniswap liquidity providers. They're our core clientele, and if they are safe, then we feel comfortable releasing what we made out into the wild. But that's a bit of a kind of cloister view. And I think that you do sort of have to take into account these sort of broader ecosystem risks, and it's hard to quantify what those are. We saw one maybe earlier, several hours ago that involved a variety of protocols and some margin lending attacks and leverage attacks and things like that. So I think the good news about all of this is that these issues are very much in the open. Anyone can kind of come in and exploit these vulnerabilities if they do exist.
00:12:57.558 - 00:13:39.830, Speaker D: And unlike in existing financial infrastructure, where issues are extremely kind of systematic, like if there are issues, they're extremely low level and hard to surface, and you kind of see this bubbling and then the sudden explosion, like in 2008, where there was this really very arcane combination of factors that resulted in a very bad downturn. But in DFI at least, we're seeing these issues very early and we're able to design around them and think adversarially from the very beginning. And I think that's a really powerful tool that we should take advantage of, and not just bemoan the fact that it's kind of easy to attack defi in some ways, but let that make us kind of stronger and more resilient.
00:13:42.170 - 00:14:21.058, Speaker C: I'm a big fan of antifragility. Right. So when these systems are being built and these have complex, very complex components, right. One of the things that developers, as a protocol developers can make sure is that understand exactly what impact or the risk, impact each of these components are doing. And we have to reengineer so that the kind of components are building can be even more smaller and does even little things, so that within those components at least, the risk is well defined. And the boundaries of the risk are well defined. Right.
00:14:21.058 - 00:15:05.220, Speaker C: So this specific year, probably there'll be evolution towards having more tokenization. Like, we are also working on something called an MFT. We call it the multifungible token, which actually captures a specific portion of the risk separately, individually. Right. So within that component, the risk boundaries are well defined. So if we start building components like that, I feel like instead of mimicking a more centralized kind of a design, we move away from it. And as we tokenize more and more, there'll be less risk in protocols working with each other.
00:15:06.630 - 00:15:07.650, Speaker A: Shayla?
00:15:10.870 - 00:15:59.220, Speaker B: I'd actually like to build a little bit off of what everyone has talked about here, and I think at least in the way that we're thinking about the way forward, I think the best way to harden the system, and speaking to what you talked about a little bit earlier, is to bring more competition into the system, is to bring more players to enable them to have really great infrastructure to stand up, get going and be a meaningful part of the ecosystem. It's obviously a huge part of our roadmap because we see infrastructure as a barrier. We want to lower that barrier and let more people in so that we can think about hardening a lot of the governance infrastructure that is so important to making sure that we can scale this and head off a lot of those mistakes really early.
00:16:00.150 - 00:16:01.860, Speaker A: Yeah, Felix, go ahead.
00:16:02.710 - 00:16:44.942, Speaker E: Well, if I were to add anything, it's mean if you are building a new project today that's going to use a lot of these different building blocks, I think there's two things that you need to really be aware of, especially for financial protocols that you're using. I think one is, I guess, like smart contract security. Are there any very obvious bugs? And typically, if you're going to be seriously building on top of a protocol, you'd want it to be audited. The second is the economic security as well. Right. I think the economics is kind of what you're relying on, like sound. And I think that's where there's a number of companies are actually starting to do economic modeling for companies such as like Gauntlet or whatnot.
00:16:44.942 - 00:17:15.718, Speaker E: So how much research and modeling have you done and how much stress testing have you done on your protocols? Which is really why I like compound and their report recently that they did with Gauntlet to try to understand those risks. And I think on the smart contract security side, I would expect there to be multiple audits done. Even formal verification would give a lot more comfort for kind of a protocol before you decide to seriously use it. Otherwise, I think you should reserve using any other protocol more for like a hackathon project or whatnot.
00:17:15.894 - 00:17:38.180, Speaker B: I think the point that you make is really sound, that just testing out and pressure testing, not only from an infrastructure perspective or smart contract perspective, but from an economic and game theory perspective. The tough part is that you can only really pressure test incentives by letting it into the ecosystem and seeing how it plays out. Right. It's kind of the catch 22.
00:17:38.550 - 00:17:55.000, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. As a follow up question, do you think one of the things maybe not holding it back, but that could take this to another level is providing some sort of on chain insurance for a lot of these potential vulnerabilities that could pop up?
00:17:55.770 - 00:18:02.060, Speaker E: I mean, on chain insurance certainly can help, but I think even on chain insurance hasn't been tested yet.
00:18:02.830 - 00:18:28.340, Speaker C: Yes, on chain insurance. Right. Like without understanding the actual risks, even if you take in the traditional world. Right. Like if you want an insurance policy, there is, there is a well defined risk, understanding of risk, and it covers this and does not cover this. Right now with a lot of things we are building, we don't know how much we can lose. Right.
00:18:28.340 - 00:19:07.550, Speaker C: And what do we do if we have insurance? Do we stop after a specific volume and things like that. Right. Maybe we should have limits on what each contract can do, probably, and things like that. So that's another whole topic to discuss about on chain insurance, on smart contracts, but insurance on specific items, like, say again, the collateral, there could be a collateral insurance around the price fluctuation of the collateral, and small things like that can happen. But on chain insurance is a huge problem to solve.
00:19:08.850 - 00:20:01.038, Speaker A: Yeah, agreed very much. In its very early days, still speculative, but I think moving on, one thing that we've been paying attention to has been the growth of stablecoins on Ethereum and then within the Defi ecosystem. And throughout the course of the year, it started to realize that the transfer value of stable coins actually surpassed that of eth. And so it's definitely an incredible achievement. You're starting to see a lot of people that want to come on and utilize this by paying with an actual stable asset. But what could be some of the other implications? Like, for instance, could you see this impacting the security of the network? Say, if there are more dollars that are existing above Ethereum than Ethereum's total market cap?
00:20:01.124 - 00:20:22.230, Speaker B: I mean, that's exactly one of our big worries, which is like, cool, let's look at the incentive systems. What if a stablecoin comes on, has a far larger market cap? And what happens with that shift in incentives? And I'd actually like to hear what you guys think about that when the incentives start to really meaningfully change against another asset and away from Ethereum.
00:20:28.130 - 00:21:23.570, Speaker C: Hello? Yeah, sorry. So with stablecoins itself, there have been multiple good models that back these stable coins, right? So it's not one model that has worked and one model that has been tried. There is also risks in all of those models, right? And one stable coin is not equal to another stable coin. And we have not solved that also. So we should have markets where there are risk markets against each stablecoin so that we can understand the risks involved in these stablecoins. Also, for example, tether has a very different risk model compared to, say, USDC, even though they are very similar in terms of how they are architected. And Dai obviously has a very different model.
00:21:23.570 - 00:22:11.118, Speaker C: And Dai is more exposed to, say, a black swan event. And we've not seen a black swan event happen either. So with these things around the block, I think ethereum, or the other standard assets like Ethereum, bitcoin, all these being the collateral, I feel like that's a better system, even though they are volatile. That's a much better system than just depending on the stable coins because we are building right now, it's like a house of card. And so I'm not a great fan of building like another system on top of the stable coin. And we don't know where it's going.
00:22:11.284 - 00:22:15.700, Speaker B: See, he's come over to the Jenga side of the house. He's with me now.
00:22:16.790 - 00:23:01.594, Speaker D: Yeah. We're going to be interestingly moving away from this kind of ease paradigm. In the uniswap v one contracts, we're going to be opening up for any, to any pairs. And it was a shift for us for sure. I think it's a testament to Ethereum that we can feel comfortable kind of opening the floodgates to some extent and not privileging eth in this unique way in our system. And I think that it's just kind of like an ETH eats the world story there, which is great, but it is also, on the flip side, a bit scary. And of course, I would just love to see, as a user of Ethereum, for there to be more projects with uncorrelated risks.
00:23:01.594 - 00:23:51.280, Speaker D: And so if you are using stablecoins and they are the predominant means of exchange, we'd all love to see some diversity in what those stablecoins are. And I think we actually have done a fairly reasonable job of that so far. I think the risk characteristics of DAi versus USDC versus tether are all fairly different. Of course there is some underlying similarity there, but I think this is going to be a problem solved over time as more projects come out and there's metrics on the average prices of bundles of these stablecoins and things like that. And so I'm not going to be able to speak to the security considerations as we move to proof of stake and the price of ETh and all that. I'm no expert there, but I do think that there is. I'm not too scared about it right now, and I think that the potential for these things to get better over time is definitely there as well.
00:23:51.910 - 00:24:16.298, Speaker E: Yeah, echoing I think that's too early to start thinking about these risks. I think that DFI and stablecoin uses probably still should ten or 100 x volume and usage before it becomes a meaningful risk. So I think that's where at least focus would be, or I think the DeFi's focus should be is just like increasing growth and then kind of kicking the can down the road, if you.
00:24:16.304 - 00:24:34.860, Speaker A: Will, is part of increasing that growth. Exploring new, maybe like crypto collateralized stablecoins. So, for instance, we recently had the proposal for metacoin, a potential alternative to maker and die system. Felix, I'll go back to you.
00:24:36.030 - 00:24:56.100, Speaker E: I mean, certainly, certainly. So I think that right now we need to run as many experiments as try many different products while things are still early. I think this kind of goes shin of risk. We should be making mistakes now rather than when things have 1000 x in size and it's touching and influencing the whole kind of financial system.
00:24:57.530 - 00:25:16.490, Speaker B: If there are those in the audience who want to explore some of the alternatives to the current maker governance structure, at least from a risk standpoint, I think metacoin actually has put a proposal out there, and it's worth taking a look and starting to see how other people are starting to consider really developing the system to be a little more hardened.
00:25:18.980 - 00:25:57.660, Speaker C: Dai also, one of the interesting issues they have to solve over time is how do we do the interest rate? That's kind of market driven, right? Because there could be governance and this can continue, but something should happen there. So obviously there are a lot of things that we can explore in the stablecoin era, and there's going to be these other stablecoins, I think, which would have these good, interesting experiments and more market driven decision making that affects the stablecoin directly.
00:25:59.040 - 00:26:00.460, Speaker A: Any final thoughts?
00:26:00.880 - 00:26:45.230, Speaker D: Very quickly, we're all about market driven things at Uniswap, and so one thing that we're looking forward to exploring in the future is decentralized price oracles. So obviously the fundamental component of basically any coin system is an oracle network. And we've seen, actually, to be fair, a variety of approaches there. We've got makers approach, we've got this new mstable proposal, we have people using Kyver for oracles. We've had chainlink oracles. Uniswap is going to be putting out kind of a slightly new design in the coming weeks and months, and that is again just going to add to the diversity of options when we're thinking about how to build these systems in a robust, decentralized, permissionless way.
00:26:46.480 - 00:27:05.620, Speaker A: Excellent. Thank you. And Noah, you brought this up earlier, talking about the potential switch to Ethereum 2.0. Just out of curiosity, where does this fit into? How does this impact your thoughts as far as short term and long term goals or roadmap?
00:27:09.080 - 00:28:11.210, Speaker D: We at Uniswap are very sensitive to the user experience, and so one thing that we did at Devcon is we had this demo of an optimistic roll up chain that used Uniswap to exchange two assets. And it is a pretty radical reimagining of what the user experience is like in Ethereum and of course e 2.0 that is going to be coming in a year or two. It's not going to be quite at the layer two level of scalability and speed and all of that. But I think it is going to be a chance for a lot of these projects to kind of put on a fresh face and start thinking about how they're going to be attracting the next wave of users. Because I think that we're going to be finally removing one of the last kind of vestiges of maybe the slightly more legacy version of crypto and moving into something that could theoretically be around for the very long term future. And so I think it's exciting and it's definitely a risk, but I think it's an opportunity as well.
00:28:12.460 - 00:28:40.690, Speaker B: When we think about that, I see a lot of infrastructure pain coming down the road. Right. The clients that support it are really nascent. I think they're going to require constant updating. I think that's going to create friction for a lot of folks in the ecosystem. So I don't want to glance over that as a barrier to making things go smoothly. Another thing that happens is what happens if some people don't adopt it.
00:28:40.690 - 00:28:48.950, Speaker B: And I hate to throw more of those thought questions in at the very end, but that's something that I also have been thinking a lot about.
00:28:49.400 - 00:28:49.956, Speaker C: Absolutely.
00:28:50.058 - 00:28:50.660, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:28:50.810 - 00:29:31.332, Speaker C: I think the initial question where you asked about the metrics. Right. So I have the feeling that with ETH 2.0, an interesting metric would be to look at the average size of transactions. So as these scaling starts kicking in, I think that we'll have more, smaller, smaller loans, smaller transaction sizes, because a lot of these loans today, a smaller loan might not be economical. Like taking $100 loan might not be possible today because it's just too cost prohibitive. So those kind of things could happen and the average size of loans could come down.
00:29:31.332 - 00:29:54.330, Speaker C: And that will be very interesting. And that will be maybe the first step to get to the mainstream, where there could be people who hold just the Ethereum on their wallet, probably, and instead of going to a payday loan, they might take a 20 day loan through these protocols. Right. So that day will be really interesting.
00:29:55.580 - 00:29:58.200, Speaker A: Final thoughts, Felix, final thoughts.
00:29:58.800 - 00:30:28.800, Speaker E: Frankly, it feels like a lifetime away before E 2.0 will launch. And I think that, similar to your point, there's going to be a very long migration period as well. I mean, look at maker Dow. It's on the same chain, but even the migration from single collateral dai to multiclateral dai, there's no clear timeline for how that's happening. It's been a huge effort on its own, and it's unclear how much more time it'll take. And I think this will be another one of those kind of huge migrations that will probably take years, actually to fully kind of realize.
00:30:28.800 - 00:30:45.640, Speaker E: So as of now, my head is mostly in ETH 1.0, which is kind of where all this activity is living today. And I think that this will be a good kind of like experiment blueprint for how things could be in the future. But it feels like too far away from things right now.
00:30:45.710 - 00:30:45.992, Speaker C: Agree.
00:30:46.046 - 00:31:07.920, Speaker A: It's going to be a gradual process. It's not going to happen right away. So running up on time here. I'll start with Felix going around. Just final thoughts. What are some of the latest changes or things that are coming out on your project? And then what are some things that we can look for in the defi space within the next year? Short term?
00:31:08.580 - 00:32:03.200, Speaker E: So recently we just launched social trading, which is essentially kind of a decentralized platform where someone can get followers and if they're particularly skilled and monetize them. And if you're kind of a new trader, you can implement some sort of like, you can follow a trader and implement a fund strategy really easily, right? So it democratizes essentially kind of hedge funds to an extent. So we are pretty excited about kind of growing the Defi user base by, not from product familiarity, which is like, for example, what Dharma is doing, where they're offering a product that people are familiar with, with enhanced capabilities and functionality. But instead we think that people are actually inherently interested in DeFi products and instead the way to reach them is through people they're already familiar with. Right. Like crypto is inherently a social phenomenon. Like most people trade or invest when someone else they know invests or they watch someone on YouTube and that they trust already and they'll make a decision based on that.
00:32:03.200 - 00:32:32.750, Speaker E: So I think that going forward, this has already proven the case in the past few weeks with social trading. And we're going to try to expand more internationally, we're going to try to reach more users via social media, via YouTube. In addition, we're going to be continuing to enhance the experience by adding more assets, by making the process much more easy. And we're pretty excited about that. And I think that this is one of the ways that DFI is going to break out of the 40 or 50,000 people it is today to the next 100,000 or the next million.
00:32:33.120 - 00:32:33.580, Speaker C: Awesome.
00:32:33.650 - 00:32:36.936, Speaker A: Thank you. We got like 2 minutes, so 30, 40 seconds.
00:32:36.968 - 00:32:45.650, Speaker D: I've done enough promotion of Unisoft. Follow us on Twitter. We're going to be announcing things about our v two very soon code blog posts, lots of info, so see you there.
00:32:47.060 - 00:33:15.148, Speaker C: And from our side, as I mentioned, we are working on something called MFT's multifungible tokens. I would really like to hear from the community on looking at the specs and seeing how it's interesting. I feel like we cannot keep creating tokens for each of the things we are trying to build. So something like having a single contract and representing multiple tokens is a very interesting idea. So I would like to talk to you guys about that. Perfect.
00:33:15.234 - 00:33:29.650, Speaker B: Shayla we will be working on two big things, which is bring more people into defi and make that experience fluid and easy and simple so you can expect that to radiate across radar products.
00:33:30.580 - 00:33:50.530, Speaker A: Excellent. Well, I want everyone to thank all of our guests. This is an excellent panel. I really appreciate them coming up and spending time with us. And unfortunately, I don't think we have any time for questions, but I'm sure they'll all be down there if you want to talk to anyone here. So thank you.
