00:00:03.930 - 00:00:39.100, Speaker A: Good morning, everyone. My name is Juan Lanus, and I'm here to talk about regulation, how to regulate defi for mass adoption, which is a very hard topic. So hard that I do not have answers. I have more questions than answers. It's a very difficult situation, and I will explain why in a minute. And this is what I promised when I signed up for this talk. Take a quick read.
00:00:39.100 - 00:01:25.298, Speaker A: So the first part is stating the obvious, right? Regulation is coming to NFTs and DeFi. And the second part, this is my aspiration for today, which is to call on you to jointly design self regulating mechanisms for DeFi. Otherwise, regulation will come from outside. So, a little bit about me I've been in fintech for 20 years in New York. Last week was my 20th anniversary as an immigrant in the United States. Grew up in Argentina, and obviously when I saw bitcoin around 1211, I was very interested. I saw that it was very disruptive.
00:01:25.298 - 00:02:30.510, Speaker A: And since I was in compliance, I immediately noticed that there was going to be a lot of pushback. So I started writing a blog and started writing for coindesk and for coin center pieces that have stood this test of time, I believe, because they are substantively what regulation intends to do. And then over the years, I basically started working for many companies, and I have had the privilege of working with many early entrepreneurs and pioneers, some of whom are listed here. So currently I'm the chief compliance officer for Repio, a crypto fintech unicorn based in Latin America, starting out of opunositis. So this is what I plan to do today. In the next 15 minutes, let's talk about some simple principles. I'm going to explain regulation and save you $150,000 if you're listening, paying attention, and I'm going to ask some hard questions.
00:02:30.510 - 00:03:42.098, Speaker A: Some of them will be well meaning and will come from a hypothetical regulator Persona with good intentions in trying to understand the industry. And other questions will come from the industry with more cynicism. I've been crowdsourcing questions, and I'm going to present them here and hope it gets recorded for home. They're long, but I plan to leave them on the screen soon enough. So, something that I think I have seen, especially in younger early adopters, there's a bit of a haste, speed, and lack of depth in thinking, rigor in thinking. So my recommendation in general is to APR, right, have awareness, perspective, and reflection about things. The other thing that I think is very important is to have what Nick Zabo called quantum thought, meaning two states in your mind or a courtroom in your mind, trying to think your case, argue your case and argue the other side's case at the same time.
00:03:42.098 - 00:04:16.346, Speaker A: And that is what Scott Fitzgerald has called first rate intelligence. So that is what I think should be done. Not have an emotional reaction to these constraints, but have a more thoughtful and all encompassing approach to. And the reason this person is here is that there's good and bad people everywhere. There are well meaning and ill meaning people everywhere. They're smart people. There are all kinds of people everywhere.
00:04:16.346 - 00:04:50.966, Speaker A: And people change. And we ourselves could change, can change, I believe so. And regulators and policymakers also can change. Proof of that is as this guy was a pilot for the empire and then moved on to the resistance. Okay, so this is the hardest part. This is the reason why you will not need to go to a lawyer because everything is encapsulated and abstracted here. So if you want to spend more time and getting to the weeds and know things that are completely irrelevant, talk to lawyers.
00:04:50.966 - 00:05:30.418, Speaker A: Otherwise, just pay attention to these things. So regulation in general, this is in general, obviously there are three things that regulators do. They set policy, they supervise and they punish, right? Three things. Every regulator around the world does these three things. The policy aspects come from the law, come from Congress, right? They don't set the law, they just do what the Congress tells them to do. In republics at least, this is how things work in a republic, whether it's division of powers. So these are the three functions a regulator has.
00:05:30.418 - 00:05:55.294, Speaker A: Then there's three types of regulators in general. Again, every time I talk to lawyers they find three, four, 5617 kinds of regulators. I just encapsulating this for ease of comprehension. So the first type of regulator is a policymaker. These are elected officials. These are the governors of the world. These are the deputies and congressmen of the world, the senators of the world.
00:05:55.294 - 00:06:10.670, Speaker A: So these are the most influential people. This is where the targeting the message messaging should go, right. And they care about job growth and development and progress and being reelected.
00:06:10.750 - 00:06:10.994, Speaker B: Right?
00:06:11.032 - 00:06:23.558, Speaker A: That's motivation. And I include in this section of regulation taxpayer tax policy, fiscal policy, and monetary policy, which has to do with regulating the economy at a higher micro level.
00:06:23.644 - 00:06:24.134, Speaker B: Right?
00:06:24.252 - 00:07:08.562, Speaker A: So I wish we're flipping my other presentation, but this is a PDF. So the other kind of regulator, which everyone calls regulator, is the administrative prudential regulator. So these guys have a stimulative role, right, or objective. These guys, on the contrary, have a preventative or a prudential type of role. And they're just admins, they just do what they're appointed, politically appointed or professional bureaucrats or public officers. So if you go to talk to them, if you want to see them in conferences, you can be as friendly to Hester Pierce as you want. But she will do what she wants and what she has to do.
00:07:08.616 - 00:07:09.074, Speaker B: Right.
00:07:09.192 - 00:07:32.162, Speaker A: She will not be able to change policy. Okay. Hester is a brilliant lady, by the way. And the other type of regulator is the police, the Department of Justice, the punitive aspect of regulation. And this is where we get law enforcement. We get the police, basically. And their focus is to catch lawbreakers.
00:07:32.326 - 00:07:32.702, Speaker B: Right?
00:07:32.756 - 00:07:40.942, Speaker A: That's the only thing they have in their mind. It's like Terminator. They just go. And that's their focus. That's what they're paid for.
00:07:40.996 - 00:07:41.502, Speaker B: Right?
00:07:41.636 - 00:08:20.878, Speaker A: Anyway, so these are the three types of regulators and policymakers, regulators and law enforcement, stimulative, prudential, punitive. That's all you need to know about how regulation works. Now let's start discussing the problems and how this is problematic for the world of crypto and blockchain, right? First of all, there's conflicting public policy objectives across these three. One, some people, for example, the prudential regulator cares about investor protection, consumer protection, privacy, confidentiality, right. Things that are good for the industry, systemic risk. They don't want things to destabilize and blow up.
00:08:20.964 - 00:08:21.600, Speaker B: Right.
00:08:23.010 - 00:08:28.986, Speaker A: And they care about privacy, but these guys do not. They care about full transparency.
00:08:29.178 - 00:08:29.920, Speaker B: Right.
00:08:31.250 - 00:08:35.406, Speaker A: They are completely the enemies of anonymity and privacy.
00:08:35.518 - 00:08:36.034, Speaker B: Right?
00:08:36.152 - 00:09:02.410, Speaker A: So this is the first part of the first problem. We have a conflicted policy, public policy objective. So which policy does the government or the republic or society, all of us as a society, prioritize? Do we prioritize the civil liberties aspect and the consumer protection aspects of confidentiality and privacy or do we go full on into a police state chasing criminals? That's something that's happening today.
00:09:02.560 - 00:09:03.066, Speaker B: Right.
00:09:03.168 - 00:09:05.942, Speaker A: And I've been saying that for years on Twitter.
00:09:06.006 - 00:09:06.620, Speaker B: Right.
00:09:06.990 - 00:09:21.550, Speaker A: And obviously, privacy preserving technologies, zero knowledge proof. Zuko. Hi, Zuko. All of these technologies will have problems facing the law enforcement aspect, right? So that's problem number one.
00:09:21.620 - 00:09:22.202, Speaker B: Right?
00:09:22.356 - 00:10:00.394, Speaker A: Second problem with regulation is that it's industry specific, product focused, activity based, jurisdiction dependent and intermediate enforced. I have coined these five monikers so they're easy to understand. I'm going to explain them briefly. Industry specific. We have regulation for food, for aviation, for transportation, for medicine, for financial services, right? So there's a division, a categorical, discrete division there, product based. We have regulation for securities, for commodities, for money, for anything. Insurance.
00:10:00.394 - 00:10:32.402, Speaker A: It's segmented by product, by financial product in this case, and also based on activity. If I do money transmission, if I transmit money, money transmission applies to me. If I issue a security, issuance of security applies to me. If I exchange a security, securities exchange applies to me. If I exchange currency, currency exchange applies to me. That is how regulation works anywhere in the world. So here is, for example, the United States, very busy table.
00:10:32.402 - 00:11:16.230, Speaker A: But this is what I just said, right? Depending on what you do, some regulator has jurisdiction over you. If you're issuing a token, the issuance of a token has to meet the requirements of a specific kind of token. If it's a security token, a currency token, or whatever, right? Stablecoin token. So that is very important to understand. And I hope it was frozen, the slide was frozen. And then we have the new verbs, new actions that have come up recently, which are things that are crypto native, things that have not contemplated in regulation. No one has ever thought of staking.
00:11:16.230 - 00:11:24.246, Speaker A: No regulator ever in the history of humanity has ever thought of staking. It's not written in the law. How do we deal with it?
00:11:24.268 - 00:11:24.694, Speaker B: Right?
00:11:24.812 - 00:11:48.510, Speaker A: So clone, delegate, mint, burn, all these are things that are crypto native. So that is another challenge for this regulation. And then jurisdiction. Every country has their own jurisdiction, their own policy, their own laws and regulations, and they're not interoperable. Nations are not interoperable today. We want them to be, but they're not.
00:11:48.660 - 00:11:49.360, Speaker B: Right.
00:11:50.130 - 00:12:05.434, Speaker A: And contrast all this with the decentralized paradigm. What do you see? Is it compatible? Is there a mapping of everything that the meat space wants and crypto space wants? No, it's completely incompatible.
00:12:05.502 - 00:12:05.974, Speaker B: Right.
00:12:06.092 - 00:12:44.378, Speaker A: So we have that problem. We have the problem of incompatibility between regulation and blockchain. And then we have another problem, which is enforcement, the enforcement part of the mandala, whatever. So that part is very subjective and discretionary, meaning sometimes there is one person that decides to enforce the actions, decides to go after one target and not another. So it's very selective and it's vicarious, it's Indirect. It's done through financial services. So anyway.
00:12:44.378 - 00:13:00.378, Speaker A: And that enforcement today is done through banks, through financial institutions. The unbanking problem here is where it comes from. It's vicarious. So these are the questions that regulators have. They are very valid questions. They cannot control it, and they're very worried.
00:13:00.494 - 00:13:01.254, Speaker B: Right.
00:13:01.452 - 00:13:07.586, Speaker A: And this is also something that they see, and we see ourselves if we are having the courtroom in our minds.
00:13:07.618 - 00:13:08.054, Speaker B: Right.
00:13:08.172 - 00:13:40.530, Speaker A: We have a lot of immaturity in organizations, and we have a lot of value at risk don't we? We have to be honest about that, right? And we have rug pools, we have exit scams. We have all these things that are very concerning to society. So the problem is, or the concern in general is if DeFi. Are manageable, right? So here are some questions. I'm going to leave this here. These are questions, I hope they're being put on screen. And these are questions that a well meaning regulator will ask of us, the industry.
00:13:40.530 - 00:13:45.458, Speaker A: Very. Read one and you'll realize that it makes sense.
00:13:45.544 - 00:13:46.180, Speaker B: Right?
00:13:46.870 - 00:14:11.530, Speaker A: Here's another set of questions that a well meaning regulator will ask. How do we enforce our laws without third party intermediation? Intermediaries. It's impossible, right? If everything is a robot, a self and autonomous machine, how do we enforce our laws? Something has to be done. So here are another one, a busy one. This is the Republic. Right? The other one was the empire. This is the Republic.
00:14:11.530 - 00:14:16.542, Speaker A: These are questions from the republic, right? Crowdsourced from many people throughout the years.
00:14:16.596 - 00:14:17.200, Speaker B: Right?
00:14:18.530 - 00:14:29.806, Speaker A: How can we achieve the goals of prudential regulation? Meaning protecting consumers'rights, investor protection, consumer protection, and also without creating a central databases.
00:14:29.918 - 00:14:30.580, Speaker B: Right.
00:14:31.110 - 00:15:06.586, Speaker A: The Financial Action Task force wants us to identify every transaction and every sender and recipient of a transaction in crypto. That means that we now have full transparency on the blockchain and full identification. What do we get with optimizing that? 1984. George Orwell's 1984. That's what we get. Is that good for society? We have to think about it, and we have to make them think about it. So these are questions that the industry should be asking itself, or should we asking regulators? We should be asking regulators.
00:15:06.586 - 00:15:07.786, Speaker A: We are asking regulators.
00:15:07.818 - 00:15:08.446, Speaker B: Right?
00:15:08.628 - 00:15:52.878, Speaker A: So are you aware that the proliferation of clandestine marketplaces is directly correlated with heavy handed and discretionary enforcement? That's a kind of a cynical or hard question to ask, but it's a valid question. And finally, this is also a valid question. Why is a tinder swindler not in jail? I mean, have you thought about that? The guy is everywhere in the world as a criminal and he's still riding jets and driving ferraris. I mean, he's obviously a swindler, a lawbreaker. No one cares. And we have the same. In Argentina, we had just a huge Ponzi scheme that was never stopped by the government.
00:15:52.878 - 00:16:03.774, Speaker A: People were being duped into buying something that was obviously a lie. No one reacts. So law enforcement is being ineffective. So here's the inspiration I have got in my last 2 minutes.
00:16:03.892 - 00:16:04.560, Speaker B: Right?
00:16:05.410 - 00:16:38.182, Speaker A: So this is what I've been researching for years now. So how? Again, we're trying to think in a balanced way, trying to think about the needs of the marketplace and the need of society, meet space and the needs of the industry. So one of the first things I found is this wonderful essay by Tim O'Reilly, where he talks about focusing on outcomes, forcing our regulators to focus on outcomes and not on bureaucracy, which is the perpetuation of the means over the ends.
00:16:38.246 - 00:16:38.762, Speaker B: Right?
00:16:38.896 - 00:17:17.430, Speaker A: So let's focus on desired outcomes, measure things, do adaptive algorithms, and do deeper analysis, which is what I'm trying to say here. Another piece of research I've followed is us ventures. I don't remember his name, but he's saying, why don't we trade off permission to operate for data? We have plenty of data in the crypto space, right? Why don't we give the state data so they can monitor us? Or why don't we monitor ourselves, right? And then we also get permission, obviously, Nick Sabo.
00:17:18.270 - 00:17:18.970, Speaker B: Right?
00:17:19.120 - 00:18:03.334, Speaker A: Wet code and dry code. Why don't we create systems and mechanisms? Also, Vinay, he has been kind of philosophizing about these things that are coming into play now with zero knowledge proofs and other things that are being automated. So self regulation by design feature and crypto economics to me is what you guys, the industry geniuses have to focus on. If we don't do that, someone is going to do something about it. Someone is going to come up with a regulatory framework that will not be friendly to crypto economics. So what I've seen here, this is my three findings here in this incredible space foresight institute. Follow them.
00:18:03.334 - 00:18:31.594, Speaker A: They're doing excellent work. There was Benjamin Dugles that did a great presentation yesterday about collaborating with the state and obviously zero knowledge proofs. So here is what my recommendations to you. I am finishing now in the next 15 seconds. But this is my advice to you. Gray hair, 20 years in fintech experience. The name main give to their mistakes.
00:18:31.594 - 00:18:50.886, Speaker A: I have a lot of experience and I work in this crypto space because I am passionate about it and I am very thankful and very, and acknowledge the generosity of the Ethereum community. It's incredible, but you have to do something about it and you have to work on both sides of the API, the technology side, and the human side.
00:18:50.988 - 00:18:51.590, Speaker B: Right?
00:18:51.740 - 00:18:52.420, Speaker A: Thank you very much.
