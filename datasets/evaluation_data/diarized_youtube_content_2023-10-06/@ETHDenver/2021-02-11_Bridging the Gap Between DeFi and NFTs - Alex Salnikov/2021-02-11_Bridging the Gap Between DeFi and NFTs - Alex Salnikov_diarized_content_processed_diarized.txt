00:00:00.170 - 00:00:22.830, Speaker A: Oh, wonderful. Okay, cool. So we have Alex Salzinoff here from variable. Wearable is an incredibly cool NFT project. For anyone who hasn't heard, this is really an og level. So we're so happy and excited to have you here, Alex. We're really looking forward.
00:00:22.830 - 00:00:40.300, Speaker A: This talk is really about bridging the gap between Defi and NFTs, which are possibly like the two hottest subjects in blockchain and crypto right now. So I feel like, Alex, you're just about know blow this out of the water. So thank you for being here and let's kick it.
00:00:41.790 - 00:00:59.642, Speaker B: Thanks. Thanks, Danny. Hi, everyone. Let me share my screen real quick. I hope you can hear me and see me. So my name is Alexander Selnikov. I'm co founder and head of product at Wearable.
00:00:59.642 - 00:01:43.070, Speaker B: Wearable is a community owned NFT marketplace. So as Dennis said, NFT and D five probably the hottest topics out there right now in blockchain since September 2020. Defi market just spiked and this year isn't an exception. So here you see this chart of the overall market volumes. It's not complete, I believe we just queried several projects, but it's so much more. And on the top it's wearables numbers. So we just started, we've been on the market just for the year a little bit more and we have 32 million of total lifetime volume, out of which 5.7
00:01:43.070 - 00:02:21.354, Speaker B: million is for the last month. And we have 31,000 total protocol users. So it's just for you to understand how nascent and promising this space is. Why nFts is so hot? For me, it became just the whole new answer to the question, why blockchain? I've been in crypto since 2012. I've constantly onboard people to blockchain space and they often ask, why do I need it? I have a credit card. It works fine for my money. And NFTs are for the digital continent first.
00:02:21.354 - 00:03:03.906, Speaker B: For digital collectibles. It's the whole new asset class that people. It doesn't work for another way for the digital content right now you can't sell it on the Internet. There is like Shopify digital downloadables for the content. And that's just the massive new wave of new users coming to blockchain through nfts. NFT is an asset class. Cryptopunks hashmag decentraland land just showed us how this can be a store of value that we all been experiencing with tokens, with ERC, 20 tokens since the beginning.
00:03:03.906 - 00:03:42.242, Speaker B: And right now the same works with nfts again, for the whole new audience. It's really easy for non crypto native people to digest what that is. You just have it on your wallet. This digital item with the image, name and description is yours. It is in your wallet, period. So like top shot NBA Topshot recently showed us how digestible that is to newcomers. You can show your display, your nfts out there so you can brag on social networks that what people do.
00:03:42.242 - 00:04:21.902, Speaker B: You can display metaverses. The whole new level of blockchain gaming with assets inside games belonging to the users is emerging. Checkout nfts are semifungible. ERC 1155 allow you to have 100 additions, 1000 additions, anything you want. There is a lot of fun in NFTs loot boxes open auctions recently showed us how that can work. Anybody who was able to make a bid under the ten minute time frame received an NFT. So this is all just works.
00:04:21.902 - 00:04:55.494, Speaker B: So cool. NFT could be a key to unlock some experience, right? So some smart contract can check if you have a specific NFT to allow you to do something. This wasn't explored yet, or at least I haven't seen use cases like that. Or you can use nfts as identity for your kyc or accredited status. So the possibilities are limitless. But there are always some cons. Nfts are really hard to price because they're less liquid.
00:04:55.494 - 00:05:26.474, Speaker B: They're singular by nature. You need to sell each NFT separately. Well, you can bundle them, but still you still need to add separate nfts to the bundle they often chip. It doesn't make much sense to trade nfts that cost $20 with the gas price of like 60. And they are not interoperable enough right now. There is no much systems you can plug NFT in. So nfts.
00:05:26.474 - 00:06:18.278, Speaker B: I don't need to explain the cool stuff about Defi as I just did to NFTs. And between these spaces is a gap right now. So deFi is a global, decentralized, interoperable, low latency, accessible, globally accessible financial system. And NFT is an asset class which isn't yet a part of this financial system. So what can be done to bridge this gap between the NFT and deFi? Here I have several mechanics that can make these spaces closer together. The first one would be shared ownership. So it's easy if you have several less liquid assets, you bundle them together, then you fractionalize the bundle and wow, you have more liquid asset now.
00:06:18.278 - 00:07:05.182, Speaker B: So this has been explored widely in the space. You can fractionalize one single expensive nfts into pieces and put that on uniswap. Or you can bundle several nfts together to make a fund that's been out there. The hardest part is like how do you understand which nfts to bundle together and what happens after they've been bundled? Like who is the new owner if they've been fractionalized? This has been quite explored right now. The second use case which I seen been started to plate with is wrapping. And I think this is one heavily underexplored. So nfts are so digestible and they visual, they understandable.
00:07:05.182 - 00:07:52.974, Speaker B: They are understandable. If you just have some defi product wrapped into an NFT, it will become much more accessible and allow you the whole new level of distribution. Urine and hedgek done this with nfts. With wrapping, insurance contracts and options construct option contracts inside nfts. One use case which I haven't seen yet and I want to see it so much, is just wrapping simple ERC 20 tokens inside nfts. So imagine you received some portion of illiquid yet illiquid tokens on some presale or whatever of a new project. You can't go to unisop and sell them because they are not yet liquid.
00:07:52.974 - 00:08:20.794, Speaker B: Another would be slippage like of 15%. If you could just wrap this token inside NFT and then go to wearable, for example, that can be like OTC market for tokens. So this is under Explorer. It's an amazing use case to bridge this Nft and defi gap. Then auctioning. Auctioning is NFT native mechanic. It's used for nfts now.
00:08:20.794 - 00:08:57.586, Speaker B: It's great. It works. People have bidding wars, but it isn't yet plugged into the DFI space. So imagine you have an NFT with a bid of $100 placed for it. What you can do is you can go to some lending service and you can take a loan with that NFT as a collateral because as soon as you've got the first bid, you know the floor price for the NFT. This isn't the connection I've seen yet with this NFT in defi world. Then the second prediction games.
00:08:57.586 - 00:09:58.614, Speaker B: This is the most nascent and the most capital efficient way to price an NFT. So let's run a prediction game on how much would that specific NFT cost? As soon as we've got this range of price, we can do the same. We can plug this asset into the more. One more mechanic coming from defi stuff to the NFT is credit delegation Avi and several other projects launched the credit delegation. So you can delegate a credit line to the specific entity that knows how to make sure that specific loan would be repaid. So if we have an NFT project that calculates however they want this mechanic for the price for collateral, they can use this credit line to then extend the credit line to their users for NFTs. So this is the mechanics, how you can breach NFT and deFi.
00:09:58.614 - 00:10:46.534, Speaker B: Some of them explore it, some of them, and here's the project that are trying to do this. Let me just briefly cover each of them. So artblocks, known origin async art, they are doing issuance. Issuance of the asset class is an important, it's just the entry point for nfts. You can put some digital content or non digital in terms of like the centrifuge is literally putting your homes in form of NFT on chain. This sounds futuristic, but in some years we can see mortgage like plug your NFT home to defi ecosystem and now you have a mortgage price discovery. Upshot NFT bank are taking different approaches.
00:10:46.534 - 00:11:30.330, Speaker B: Upshot doing prediction games, peer to peer prediction games. It's just the latest invention of mechanism design. They are applying this to understand how much this particular NFT can cost. NFT bank runs data science, a lot of data science jobs to make sure that to recover the price for the NFT from the market data. I already told you about wrapping financial defi financial projects into nfts. Euron did insurance, hedgek did or will do nfts. You could see some previews on wearable for them on the lending part.
00:11:30.330 - 00:12:09.190, Speaker B: Union protocol does these credit delegations. NFTFI is a DAO that can lend you some money with the NFT collateral. It's a DAO because you can't so far know how much NFT costs to liquidate it accordingly. That's why you need to understand some people need to basically vet nfts that can be used as a collateral and NFT funds. The most explored probably area NFTX does funds for nfts separate categories. For example, hash masks project has NFTX fund. It's an automated fund.
00:12:09.190 - 00:13:10.282, Speaker B: So you can add any hash mask to that fund, but it will be counted as equal hash masks. So again, they don't have price discovery to make sure that the assets come into the fund weighted for their prices. Flaminga Dao is the DAO investing in NFTs and NFT projects. Blackpool is the DAO investing in NFTs and NFT projects. Metaphors does this niftyx does fractionalizing. So you're basically converting one single large NFT into a fund and putting that on sale. So what are the missing links between these two areas? For me, I think the big opportunity in having just the single most important infrastructure project in the NFT space is the NFT exchange protocol, like Uniswap for NFts to make sure that this will be a landmark infrastructure point around all of which projects would work together.
00:13:10.282 - 00:13:44.546, Speaker B: Because you need the place to liquidate your assets, you need to place to trade your funds. This is the really important piece of software that we are going to build at wearable with the wearable dow. So this thing needs to be community governed. It needs to be interoperable to have on chain like sell and buy functions. Basically, it needs to be liquid. Then we are going to build indexer and subgraph around this to make sure that it's covered with enough. Querying infrastructure on chain royalties is a big one.
00:13:44.546 - 00:14:22.794, Speaker B: Scalability, of course, for the cheap nfts and this machine would basically serve as distribution. As soon as you minted an NFT, you can call just the sell and putting this on sale inside the NFT protocol and it will be distributed and sold. That's the landmark like piece of infrastructure needed in the space. Price discovery is the second biggest problem out there. I already covered several times. If you want to trade an NFT, you need to understand how much does it work. If you want to trade it in an automated manner so it can be dao based.
00:14:22.794 - 00:14:56.154, Speaker B: Some members can decide how much it costs. Appraisal games as upshot does, or auction based. If you have several beats, you know the price floor. On the miscellaneous part of infrastructure, we have NFT index for the whole ecosystem. So imagine we have a representation of every NFT under one fund, under one big NFT index fund, 1155 on the curve. There is a project that did that, but it's underexplored. Again, you can trade 1155s.
00:14:56.154 - 00:15:32.598, Speaker B: They are semifungible in the uniswap manner. NFT launch pad we've seen several projects launching by selling nfts. There is a big opportunity for an NFT launchpad in the market and NFT perpetuals to make sure that that's more or less a combination of liquid trading mechanics. So this is all infrastructure missing, blocks open to be built. And what I wanted to announce today is the wearable Dow. We launched this community owned initiative half of the year ago. It went crazy.
00:15:32.598 - 00:16:23.922, Speaker B: And right now we are converting. We are making one more step to be decentralized. Basically we are launching community treasury and staking mechanics to make sure that only the voters with skin in the game would participate in managing that community treasury to make sure they contribute long term efforts to the project. The proposal, the draft proposal for staking and community treasury is live on Governance forum on wearable governance forum gov wearable.com and basically we expect this treasury to be taken and spent on the protocol, infrastructure and marketing initiatives to build this connection to build the infrastructure around nfts globally. That's it guys. Join out to build the most liquid NFT protocol.
00:16:23.922 - 00:16:50.238, Speaker B: Yeah. Contact us. You can find me on twitter, it's insider Zero X. You can probably know the wearable twitter we just raised around from vcs. There's twelve participants, parafi one Kx coin fund, Coinbase Ventures. We have the best crew to build the most professional NFT dow out there. Please join the initiatives, guys.
00:16:50.238 - 00:16:51.360, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:16:53.650 - 00:17:04.910, Speaker C: Awesome. Thank you, Alex. That was incredible. We still have a couple of minutes left if you're got a minute here, to take a couple questions, if we have some from the comments.
00:17:05.070 - 00:17:06.114, Speaker B: Yep, sure.
00:17:06.232 - 00:17:23.180, Speaker C: Excellent. All right, give me 1 second. Let me just pull those up for us. Let's see. You can also open those comments on the right hand panel of the streamyard there where you're looking and if there's any. A lot of love for wearable, for sure.
00:17:24.990 - 00:18:17.290, Speaker B: Well, I think I see a couple of questions. So probably the hardest part for the community is scalability. The gas fees are killing everybody. So we're exploring scalability solutions. We are committed to the core team of wearable, not the DAO members are committed to implement at least one scalability solutions. We feel that NFT future is interoperable, so we'll have just the prioritization of scalability solutions across which NFT will live and just implement them one by one. I won't say which one we will start with because the scalability solutions tend to have network effects and I think we want to coordinate with the space on launching this separately.
00:18:20.450 - 00:18:25.600, Speaker C: How about that one from Zinc City? An oracle solution for basically.
00:18:27.410 - 00:18:59.050, Speaker B: I think NFT bank can do that. The guys literally made a trading bot that was analyzing access activity on the marketplaces to understand how much each axe could cost. And they built a trading robot that bought and sold undervalued and overvalued assets. With that data, I believe they're in the best position to build oracle solution for NFts that can be plugged into the defi ecosystem.
00:19:00.030 - 00:19:17.200, Speaker C: Interesting, interesting. Yeah. If you guys have more questions from the community. Definitely reach out in the comments and drop something in there for Alex. And let's see here. Looks like we've got about three more minutes if we want to take it, Alex or some. Thank you.
00:19:17.200 - 00:19:21.070, Speaker C: You got some fans in the audience.
00:19:22.610 - 00:19:24.026, Speaker B: That's the best feeling.
00:19:24.138 - 00:19:24.926, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely.
00:19:25.028 - 00:19:26.000, Speaker B: Thank you, guys.
00:19:26.710 - 00:19:37.818, Speaker C: If I was going to throw out a question for you from your position, what do you think the future holds in the next maybe twelve months for the space? From your position, what would you comment.
00:19:37.854 - 00:19:39.606, Speaker B: On for the NFT space?
00:19:39.708 - 00:19:42.934, Speaker C: Yeah. How is that going to look in the next twelve months? Maybe.
00:19:43.052 - 00:20:44.278, Speaker B: I think a lot of new project would pop up in the recent future because we seen the big uptick in activity in September and basically it takes half of a year or a year to build a great project. So this year will be just the NFT projects explosion. That's one. Then we will see major layer two adoption in the NFT space. So as I predicted, one big player would go to some NFT scalability solution and all the rest of the market would go the same. So we probably need to pick some NFT scalability solution that has on chain defi capabilities because you really want to plug in nfts to defi ecosystem as soon as you got there. I'm pretty sure that there will be several more NFT layer ones with bridges to Ethereum.
00:20:44.278 - 00:21:28.038, Speaker B: That's why we all need to have this multi chain NFT standard. I think Cosmos tried to do something like, like NFT future is interoperable. Several bridges appear. Polkadot launch there will be major player on Polkadot ecosystem again. I think this year would be under the motto of fighting gas prices on Ethereum. While we're waiting for Ethereum 2.0 to launch and all the side chains, layer twos, another layer ones would be battling with each other for the NFT space as well.
00:21:28.204 - 00:21:56.590, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. And the competition I think is really healthy. I think there's a lot of demand and there's going to be a lot of people stepping into that in order to meet that. I mean that's the nature of the market. So that's, I think, exciting for the future of interoperability. I know that's a really key theme that me talking to a lot of the sponsors throughout the event, before the event and stuff like that. That's a really key theme that's been coming up for this year is interoperability.
00:21:56.590 - 00:22:13.814, Speaker C: We've kind of, I think, had our tribalism at times and we're really starting to come together to really stretch because we have to in order to achieve the goals that we want, I think we have to come together as a theme. I don't know if you have any comments about interoperability here for the last like maybe two minutes.
00:22:14.012 - 00:23:04.454, Speaker B: Yeah. So basically interoperability is the common denominator across the projects that allow Ethereum to thrive. Basically, the contract to contract interaction is the key to ability. That's why we need to have on chain order books, we need to have on chain bridges that can be used without off chain parts. If you want to breach an NFT between one layer and another, you need to only be able to call the on chain contract. That's really important. You probably want to move some funds between these layers freely and to remain them locked inside defi contracts and that kind of stuff.
00:23:04.454 - 00:23:23.920, Speaker B: But I think the biggest need for interoperability, the biggest allowance, the biggest enabler for interoperability is just great tools for developers. If you have several bridges that are generalized enough, the developers will come and build whatever it is.
00:23:24.530 - 00:23:29.920, Speaker C: Yeah, you give them the tools and turn them loose in the right direction and they'll work it out.
00:23:30.770 - 00:24:08.620, Speaker B: We have several new comments. Five. Turkey or storky? Not sure what you meant. Predict a lot of collector daos? Yeah, that's one I think I totally agree with. So, yeah, please guys, get around together. The Dow is always better than singular individual collectors because there is this community power in promoting what you have collected and making it more expensive. Examples of cross chain nfts, let me think.
00:24:08.620 - 00:24:33.840, Speaker B: I believe some project like Avigochi can have something like that, but not sure I've seen the life yet. There was some game that has interoperability between Tron EOs and Ethereum. You can move your assets between these three blockchains, right?
00:24:35.290 - 00:24:45.430, Speaker C: Excellent, excellent. Well, we're out of time. Alex, thank you so much for all of your insights. It was really a privilege to hear from you and have you share and thanks for taking the Q A with us.
00:24:45.580 - 00:24:52.278, Speaker B: Thank you, Jonathan, thank you for having me today. Thank you all the space for being live.
00:24:52.444 - 00:24:53.250, Speaker C: All right, cheers.
