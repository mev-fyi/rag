It seems like there's kind of been a pivot recently to increase the user experience of DeFi. So right now one of the bad user experiences of DeFi is if you make a transaction and people know that wallet is yours, you've just financially doxed yourself. A lot of projects are trying to get kind of a privacy layer in there. You can even do it in ways that are regulatorily compliant.
