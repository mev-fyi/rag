00:00:00.810 - 00:00:40.806, Speaker A: Hi, I'm Richard, one of the developer advocates here at Chainlink Labs. And today I'd like to talk to you a little bit about what Chainlink is and the bounties that we have going on. So first of all, what is Chainlink? Chainlink solves what's called the Oracle problem. We have a distributed Oracle network, that's a distributed network of Oracle nodes that basically mirrors any of the blockchain's distributed validator networks. Using that distributed Oracle network, we can provide data on chain. Blockchains traditionally have a problem with what's called non deterministic values. Anything where there's a value that depends on other things, such as time or location, those can be problematic for blockchains because all those validators, they need to reach the same value.
00:00:40.806 - 00:01:18.774, Speaker A: Chainlink solves that problem by having a distributed oracle network. So not only do you have an oracle which brings that off chain data on chain, but we do it in a distributed fashion so that you maintain the distributed reliability of a blockchain. Now, what all do we provide? First of all, we provide automation that lets you automate your smart contracts. You can do this with either time based automations running a specific time or cadence or activity based automations that, based on the features of a smart contract, will run when a specific event happens. Secondly, we provide data feeds. That's bringing that off chain data on chain. Think about pricing information.
00:01:18.774 - 00:01:44.638, Speaker A: Next, we provide VRF or verifiable randomness functions. These allow you to have verified random numbers brought on chain so that your users can know that the numbers are truly random. And finally, there's something new. Chainlink functions. You'll have the opportunity to be one of the first people to use chainlink functions. What are Chainlink functions? Chainlink functions give your smart contracts access to cloud compute infrastructure. That's right.
00:01:44.638 - 00:02:03.410, Speaker A: Any code that you want to run, you can run in chainlink functions. Whether it's a complex computation or an API call, you can run that code through Chainlink functions. Now we're talking about bounties. What do we have? We have two different tracks for the bounty program this year. The first, it's going to be related to Chainlink functions. It's new. We want to see what you build with it.
00:02:03.410 - 00:02:27.398, Speaker A: So if you have a project that uses Chainlink functions, you can be part of that track. The second track is based on all of our other services. So if you use any of our other services, you'll be eligible for that. Now, you may be wondering, can I be eligible for both tracks? The answer is yes, you can. You can be eligible for both tracks. You just can't win both tracks. So if you win one of our bounties in one of the tracks, you won't be eligible for the other track.
00:02:27.398 - 00:02:38.620, Speaker A: Now, when it comes to those bounties, what are we offering? We have five prizes for each track of $2,000 each. That's a total of ten prizes across the two different tracks. I'm looking forward to seeing what you build.
