00:00:00.250 - 00:00:35.590, Speaker A: Switching back to kind of just the Ui Ux focus. So, you know, people are working on things, experimenting and building new things. Our next presenter is somebody who can bring the voice of experience, somebody that's been working on UI Ux for quite a while, I believe even going back to maybe the early days of Ethereum. I. Correct me if I'm wrong, Rick, but I believe also curve. Curve is one of my favorite UI Ux in the space. I just love the retro vibes, and.
00:00:35.740 - 00:00:39.446, Speaker B: It'S so much fun to use, that's all. Michael, I can't claim it.
00:00:39.548 - 00:00:40.502, Speaker A: Okay, cool.
00:00:40.636 - 00:00:55.918, Speaker B: But I think we came up with the names together, so that was. No, no, he was the one who led the charge on that. I believe it's actually a default CSS library from someone who just wanted to make the windows feel again. So it was kind of a fun choice, for sure.
00:00:56.004 - 00:01:12.450, Speaker A: Gotcha. Well, yeah, there's a lot of really interesting different approaches to design in DeFi and across dapps in general. So Rick's in a great place to give some insight on that and kind of tell you where his head's at right now. So thanks for joining us, Rick.
00:01:13.030 - 00:02:06.760, Speaker B: Great. And I was just wondering, just briefly, before I start, I'd love to just see these comments that come on twitch so that I can respond to any questions or comments or things like that. And that would be really helpful. So, yeah, let me just switch over to my screen, and then I'm just basically just going to run you through here we go down the vortex. I'm basically just going to run you through a big project that I've been working on recently. And just like all the thinking and interactions and the messy kind of back and forth of the design process, and then perhaps share a little bit more about what some of the interactions are now like with the community as we begin to make this project kind of more widely available. So the protocol that I'm currently focused on helping out is known as Faye protocol, or FEI, and it's a major contribution to the stablecoin space and ideally to the DeFi space in general.
00:02:06.760 - 00:03:16.070, Speaker B: And the way in which Faye works is that it's trying to bring about a kind of under collateralized stablecoin, or a stablecoin that can maintain its peg without needing to be massively over collateralized. So obviously, there's been a lot of hype and different stuff in the stablecoin space. We've seen tons of different projects come out that have different takes, and Faye really has a bunch of different mechanisms that I'm going to try and add design to over time, and I'm really just probably like a month into this process. So the design process began with talking about how the protocol itself is going to raise capital. So the company that's building Faye has raised kind of private money, but the protocol itself needs capital to exist in the same way kind of maker uses capital to produce Dai Faye needs capital to produce Faye the stablecoin. And so this was a kind of prototype that Joey and Seb threw together for how these things could work. And what I want to kind of emphasize here is that the design process began very broad.
00:03:16.070 - 00:03:45.058, Speaker B: We've got to cover not only branding, but capital loading. Managing different systems. We've got to kind of do the naming, the timing, explain different things. And we started with some really rough prototypes of how we're going to explain the bonding curve and all these things. And really the whole process was like a back and forth of whiteboards. Quick figma prototypes. Lots of comments looking at how other people have addressed these things.
00:03:45.058 - 00:04:31.540, Speaker B: I think gnosis have done some great work there and drawing inspiration from some of the previous UI work we did at balance, and really thinking carefully about how all these things should work and how things can look. So, yes, you can see here that really I'm just trying everything, just trying a bunch of stuff for Genesis, but this was like the initial engagement with the Faylads and then further over in the document. And I don't really segregate too much early on. I'm thinking about this theme. Okay, so Faye is actually referring to something called a yapstone. There's also the Rhystone community. And so we're kind of drawing on similar themes, looking into what it meant to have a yapstone, what it meant to record data.
00:04:31.540 - 00:05:37.678, Speaker B: And over here you can see all my sketches and early ideas and brain dumps of like, how does this protocol work? How does it manage liquidity? How does the system function? And I was starting to think about combining some kind of electrical theme with the kind of stone based, simple system, because I think that's kind of interesting that we're kind of combining these new accounting systems together. We're moving forward from systems where humans would account for things, and we're starting to kind of build this infrastructure that's like computer controlled accounting. That was like just where my head was at, and still is at is. I'm thinking about ways we can kind of make the protocol, like an embedded chip system or something like that. And all this theming is interesting and something I really want to hit on more. And so next I'm going to move into what I think is really important is thinking through icon work. And this has really been a collaborative process, both with the team at Fay and a bunch of community members who've chipped in ideas.
00:05:37.678 - 00:06:28.294, Speaker B: And so at its most basic level, it start with the kind of obvious facestone themed whole inner circle, and then looking at different kind of block styles or hexagons or kind of appealing to those different themes. And really it was just like tons of variation and sketching. And then more broadly we realized that obviously there's got to be two token designs here. This is a two token model. There's the Fay USD, which is the stablecoin, and then there's tribe, which is the governance token that will be managing the system. And when I look at crypto icons, a lot of them kind of abuse quite a few basic principles of design. So nearly all of these icons that you see here would look really hard as you zoom out.
00:06:28.294 - 00:07:13.346, Speaker B: It's really hard to recognize them. There's a few that work, but what you're always wanting to optimize for is like the lowest fidelity option, right? Because imagine the Faye USD on a Android phone with the kind of smallest resolution, the smallest screen. Could they make out what Faye USD is in this kind of sea of different tokens? There are some people who've done a good job, like TKN and a couple of others. But in general, I'm pretty disappointed with the current state of the art of token iconography. And I'm not saying we've got anything better necessarily yet, but I just want to point out some of the problems. You look at something like kin, right? That's an incredibly intricate design that just will not render on like 16 pixel icons. It'll just end up being a blur iota.
00:07:13.346 - 00:07:50.660, Speaker B: Obviously a bit of a disaster protocol, disaster token as well. But yeah, you can basically just see. Generally you're looking to see, is this visible when it's zoomed out? And would this work on a low resolution screen? I think a lot of tokens fail that test and that's why they're not driving themselves into the consciousness. I think Ethereum has a very recognizable branding. It scales up, it scales down, works really well. But there are many other tokens that kind of don't meet that test. And I just get almost token blindness a little bit and would struggle to pick them out of a kind of lineup of other.
00:07:50.660 - 00:08:39.394, Speaker B: Yeah, actually on New Year's Eve I was with Joey and Seb and we were just chatting about ideas and vibing together and really talking through what we want to kind of communicate. And there's this kind of tribal element to the whole project that we're calling it the tribe. The people who help out, members of the tribe, the people who are investing, members of the tribe, the community who are coming in, are all part of that tribe. And one kind of idea that I touched on was this idea of like Stonehenge or these kind of tribal stones and the way in which they're set up. And that's how our kind of early prototypes for tribe token and the kind of facetone ended up looking. And we are starting to get towards something here, but we weren't super happy with it. We're like, that, this is cool, but we haven't probably cracked it.
00:08:39.394 - 00:09:22.522, Speaker B: Another thing that's so important, I think, in design and thinking, branding for different projects is finding the emoji that really captures the project. It seems like emoji based projects or ones that have an emoji like Aave's ghost or others just capture the memes and capture the livelihood of the community in a really interesting way. So very early on, we started debating what would it mean to have an emoji that represented both tribe and fair usd. Yeah, so here we go, some more different prototypes. Experimenting with color. And this is the most important thing is seeing what it looks like at multiple sizes. And does the spacing work both when it's large or does it work when it's small? And really diving into those variations.
00:09:22.522 - 00:10:44.566, Speaker B: And then when Joey and I were doing a trip together, I touched on this idea of FayUSD could be represented by the pyramid that is on many different dollar denominated notes. And then we went down the rabbit hole on what is that pyramid? What is that kind of eye? And I went really into, I believe it's related to the eye of providence, and there's all kinds of other elements to that and symbolism built into this idea that there's this kind of all seeing eye and that it's part of the US's kind of strength and control and things like, yes, we built off that theme and we thought, actually, this actually does capture the stablecoin quite well and went through a ton of variations on those and eventually got to this place where we thought we were happy with it. We thought, okay, we're getting close towards a kind of cohesive token branding strategy we're happy with. It's fun to kind of place it, among other things. And then several members of the community came in and offered some really great input. So there was Lol Defi and Boku. So initially, Lol Defi was thinking more of a kind of abstract tea here with different setups.
00:10:44.566 - 00:11:24.006, Speaker B: And we went through a bunch of variations together and ended up looking at how those spacings looked and how they could. And this process is again, just a massive amount of back and forth. And it was so fun to involve community members in that. And you can see here some of Lol D five's other great ideas. But really what we're getting towards now, and this is an idea from Boku, is this notion of a kind of negative t. So we're actually going back to that Stonehenge theme and we're using the space created between the rocks as a kind of negative implied t. And so this is where we're getting to.
00:11:24.006 - 00:12:14.840, Speaker B: Currently, it's by no means finalized, but I just thought I'd show some of the live work here as things progress. Cool. So again, let's switch out of branding and we'll go back over to what's really important, which is how the protocol will accrue capital. And this has been a long process of different design work. I was showing you some of it earlier. But what it's got towards is a kind of pretty kind of basic system where we are trying to just kind of communicate the variables involved as Faye raises capital and how it can have an influence. So we're trying to make it clear that people can deposit capital and that different amounts of capital will have an impact, and the price of ether will have an impact on how much of the eventual tokens you end up getting.
00:12:14.840 - 00:13:03.640, Speaker B: And then we're going through kind of different states. So thinking through what are your deposits? How much have you raised, what are you able to do with your deposits, and whether you'd like to commit more capital to the system. And so, yeah, the feedback we've had from that, it was fairly complicated and it was a lot to process. And we're now working on a simpler version and a more advanced version. I think for people who are throwing in five e, they just generally they're going to hear of the project and do that. For people who want to put in a lot more money, they're going to do much more than that and they might want to use the more advanced systems. So that gives you an idea of just some of the progress we've gone through of just thinking about how the capital can be allocated to the protocol itself.
00:13:03.640 - 00:14:24.414, Speaker B: And let's go back into, again, the home page is still very basic, but I wanted to kind of capture the idea of Faye as a kind of new way of driving stability. I think that the most interesting part of the mechanism is that when Faye is kind of above the peg, it has one set of mechanisms to bring it back down. And when Faye trades below the peg, it has a whole separate piece of machinery to bring it back and get up. And these pieces of machinery are not actually like human controlled, they're computer controlled. And so we really are trying to make this thing as clear as possible, trying to share what is going on with all the code. And in the end, I settled on this kind of wave theme, this idea that you could make sure that everything is clearer and the waves are clearer and just kind of elucidate that there's this constant flux around a stablecoin's peg and that Faye wants to kind of hug that. And so went through a bunch of themes, bunch of different text and copy and trying to explain where it's going, and ended up getting towards this kind of dark theme, which we're pretty happy with for now.
00:14:24.414 - 00:14:51.146, Speaker B: But again, you can probably see there's like five or six different fronts that I'm trying to push the design forward on. And it is by no means where we want it to be, but it's just trying to get to a v zero for everything so that people can use it at this stage. I just want to quickly come back to see the twitch stream. I don't know how I can see the questions right now. So is there any way you can just show me the questions on here or should I go to the twitch stream live?
00:14:51.248 - 00:14:57.900, Speaker C: I think on the right side you should be able to open the comments button. Looks like we lost him.
00:15:02.670 - 00:15:03.082, Speaker A: Okay.
00:15:03.136 - 00:15:09.360, Speaker C: Yeah, unfortunately we lost him, but he'll be loading the page probably right back.
00:15:09.730 - 00:15:21.042, Speaker A: Yeah, a couple of questions here. How can the community get involved? That's a wonderful question. Here we go. I can't speak to what other.
00:15:21.096 - 00:15:23.634, Speaker B: He's back, everybody.
00:15:23.752 - 00:15:24.658, Speaker C: No worries.
00:15:24.824 - 00:15:51.558, Speaker B: All right, sorry, I just wanted to see the comments, just to kind of make this a little bit more interactive. How can the community get involved? And the comments, they're showing up in the comments section on the right. Okay, great. How can the community get involved? Am I seeing everything live? I just want to make sure I'm not. Great. Yeah. So the community can get involved by going to the design channel, which is on the discord.
00:15:51.558 - 00:16:10.420, Speaker B: And you can check out that the link to that will be on twitter.com fayprotectocol. Cool. All right. Well, if that's the only questions so far, then I'll happily just carry on for another kind of five to ten minutes. Just showing you an overview of all the things we're thinking about and some of the interactions that we've had from the community.
00:16:11.430 - 00:16:14.370, Speaker C: One quick note, Rick. You've got 1 minute left.
00:16:14.520 - 00:16:15.074, Speaker B: Okay.
00:16:15.192 - 00:16:17.106, Speaker C: And some miscommunication. So you just have one.
00:16:17.128 - 00:16:41.358, Speaker B: No worries. Absolutely. So I will do one last minute just rounding up where we're at. And this has been great. It's just fun to go through a file and hopefully people see a different perspective on what this stuff looks like and the kind of multiple fronts that we're thinking through. And yeah, I'll just quickly maybe just show. One thing I've been quite excited to do is think through a trading UI again.
00:16:41.358 - 00:17:21.878, Speaker B: I've done that kind of ten or 15 times, but it's fun to just approach that again because there are some interesting incentives that come with Faye. And so we've just been thinking through how to communicate the kind of bonus or the penalties, the burns that can occur as you trade Faye for E. That's part of the mechanism. So there we go. I think that's been a pretty rip roaring go through of a project that's still live in development. And really, none of this is where we want it to be. It's all about just getting everything lined up to a v zero so everything can kind of move forward and be launched.
00:17:21.878 - 00:17:50.050, Speaker B: But then we're really hoping to refine this and make this great. And ideally, I'm looking for a designer who's just young, hungry, fired up, and wants to just take this base level that I've started with and really run with it and make it their own. And so that's really kind of what I wanted to share is this is what goes on in my brain. This is how I work with people in general, with founders. I just try and send them a figma file full of ideas and then we can get things flowing. I'm not just trying to tell them what to do. I'm like, let's just see what you think about these pixels.
00:17:50.050 - 00:18:08.614, Speaker B: So, yeah, it's been super fun just kind of giving an overview of it. It's been really fun working on Faye protocol so far. And if anybody else wants to pop in, add their comments, give feedback, then the discord is popping off and we've had some really good back and forth in there in the design channel. So, yeah, thanks so much for everyone's time and really appreciate this opportunity to speak.
00:18:08.732 - 00:18:17.720, Speaker A: Hey, thanks, Rick. And if anybody wants to keep tabs on what you're thinking, kind of your insights, it looks like you have some great thoughts on your Twitter feed. Do you have a blog or anything?
00:18:18.330 - 00:18:24.718, Speaker B: Yeah, all my stuff. Just start on my Twitter and it's all there, all the links to everything. So. Yeah, great. Good to have you all.
00:18:24.804 - 00:18:25.920, Speaker A: Hey, thanks again.
00:18:26.290 - 00:18:26.860, Speaker B: Cheers, everyone.
