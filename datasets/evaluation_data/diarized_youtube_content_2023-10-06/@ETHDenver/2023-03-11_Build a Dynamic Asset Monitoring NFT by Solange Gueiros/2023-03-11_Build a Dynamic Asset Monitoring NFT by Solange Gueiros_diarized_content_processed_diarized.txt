00:00:00.330 - 00:00:35.732, Speaker A: Welcome everybody. I know that it will be a big challenger to do my talking now because the Internet is not the best thing in this moment. But probably the initial idea is to do a handson session with you. What do you do with you? You pass out the material for you. And I hope that the things that I already have loaded in my computer can work now. Let's do it. So this is me.
00:00:35.732 - 00:01:13.648, Speaker A: My name is Solenci Garos. I am developer advocate at Chain Link Labs. And for me it's a big pleasure to be here at Edenver and to talk in this stage. I started here in 2019. It's my fourth year in Edinburgh and I was a hacker. I won prize one of the years and this year I was one of the organizers of the camp build. And it was really amazing because I'm pretty sure that we onboarding a lot of new developers for this space.
00:01:13.648 - 00:01:49.542, Speaker A: I'm so proud of this. And this is the most important slide for you. If you cannot read the QR code, take a picture because you can do this later. We know that probably you'll not be able to do this now. So take a picture. And this is our topic is building a dynamic asset monitor NFT. You have the presentation.
00:01:49.542 - 00:02:24.920, Speaker A: So all the other care codes that I show you, you can get in the presentation. So don't care about this. This is useful for you because we have a lot of good information, especially for beginners. And this can guide you whatever you'd like to do. And it's supposed to us to go to a pad that you create now? Probably not. Let's see if I can do it. If not, it's not a problem.
00:02:24.920 - 00:02:50.024, Speaker A: Sorry what I did. Okay, so I copy and I used to do this to you. Do the workshop with me. Let's see if we can do this. No, probably not. This is not a problem. You can check the material later.
00:02:50.024 - 00:03:25.520, Speaker A: Okay, so to build a dynamic NFT, what's our requirements? I'm doing this on girly, but you can do in any chain that you like to do. But you need to have the metamask wallet. We are using remix. You need to have the eat in the network that you are working. And also the link token. I put some faucets for you because I not right to do hungry, but it's supposed to do this. So let's talk about dynamic NFTs.
00:03:25.520 - 00:04:21.156, Speaker A: When I talk about dynamic NFTs, I mean talking about NFT that can react with the world. And I used to say that I am a dynamic NFT because I may being older day by day, I hope to not be fat, but maybe I hope to be slim. But the idea is that I am unique, but I am changing day by day in the same way any of you, our few, are unique. So you are a dynamic NFT as well. And this is the concept of a dynamic NFT and we can have rules or conditions to change. It can be the timing, like I told before, scores or highlights or experience or the weather. Anything can change.
00:04:21.156 - 00:05:45.390, Speaker A: For example, I have another example of a dynamic NFT that it's a flower that is growing by the time it's changing by the time in the soccer World Cup, I create a dynamic NFT where we are trying to guess who you won the World cup and at the end it was updated with the winner. So all of these are dynamic nfts. Today in our dynamic NFT we are using two chain link services. The data fit is that because my dynamic NFT here is supposed to react with the iT pricing USD so I can get the USD price using the data feed and then if the prices go up or down related to the last time that I got the price, I change my NFT so my NFT can be happy, can be sad, can be nothing. This is the idea. I will have icons in my NFT then what more I'm using. I'm using automation because the idea is not that you do this by myself and clicking some button or calling some function out timey to update this.
00:05:45.390 - 00:06:29.448, Speaker A: And this is so interesting. Do you know that a smart content cannot color itself? Like the smart content cannot manage the timing or cannot manage the conditions alone. The match content must be colored by another account. This another account can be an external account like your account. My account can be oracle or can be another smart content. In our case, we are using automation that it's a chaining service to cow the smart contract for us and check the condition. What my condition that I'd like to check if I use a timely basis.
00:06:29.448 - 00:07:03.690, Speaker A: So every minute I check the condition and if some change in my condition, the NfT you change as well. This is the code of the dynamic NFT. We know that you cannot get the code now remember that you got the slide so you will have it. This is not a problem for you and I will show you this now. This is the code. This is the remix. Remix at lich is here.
00:07:03.690 - 00:07:35.410, Speaker A: So let's explain what I have in my code for you. It's good for you. Yes. So I'm importing some libraries from open zapping. This is the best way to create your NfT and especially pay attention in these two libraries string and base 64. Someone yesterday was talking with me about strings and how to deal with some arrays. Use this that this is the best way.
00:07:35.410 - 00:08:34.464, Speaker A: And also I'm only importing the aggregator interface from chainlink to get the price and I didn't told you but my nft is svg icon so I'm building image life inside my smart contract. I really love this and I'd like to tell you that this project was not created by me, was created by his. Shed is another develop advocate from our team and this is so cool because we have different people creating projects and all of us are using this. And you can see this here you can see the icon. So if the price is going up I will be happy. If the price is going down I will be sad or if the price didn't change. Okay it's flat.
00:08:34.464 - 00:09:18.964, Speaker A: This is the indicator to be sure that even if the price didn't change, my NFT was updated. I create this, I put some colors so I can change the background color of my SVG image and it's only this. I'm using Jisong early. I don't expect that this will work. Now let's see. Let's cross fingers and I will only explain what you need to do here. Here is the update sVG function where I can get the information and update the string important for you.
00:09:18.964 - 00:09:52.252, Speaker A: I'm building the SVG here, how I'm doing this. Here we are. I'm getting the color that I'm using and changing the color. I have six or seven colors, something like that. And if I am at the last I go to the first. Then here I'm getting the icon and forgetting the icon I compare the price, the it price how I am comparing the price. I save the last price.
00:09:52.252 - 00:10:20.996, Speaker A: I will get the price now and see if it is up or down, stuff like that. So easy. And like I told you before, I can do this in an automatically way. Let's try first manually to see if it's happened or better because I did this yesterday night. I can see if it's working. This is my NFT. I just updated the metadata.
00:10:20.996 - 00:11:09.690, Speaker A: Now you can see that yesterday, like in the same time the price didn't change. Let's see if from yesterday to now it changed because it was in our automatically way, it was being updated to. You understand how I'm doing this here? I created this function to automate this. So this is updating by timing. I ask to update by minute. Probably from yesterday until today. I may run out of balance because I need to pay only to do this.
00:11:09.690 - 00:12:12.062, Speaker A: And it's interesting to you to understand how this works because when your function is executed you need to pay gas for this. It's normal. But here you are paying in link, you have a balance on link using link in your automation subscription and then this is converting you are paying in link and this is converting to paying it the gas. This is the process and you can see that I did yesterday, this was yesterday, I don't know, like midnight something like that. I was doing this and it seems that up to dated. Are you open a new screen? Because maybe I don't like to lose the other image. Let's see.
00:12:12.062 - 00:13:09.590, Speaker A: You know that our Internet is so crazy and I'd like to update this. Yes maybe you have it is updated in a few minutes and you can see here that it's supposed to be colored more times than yesterday. Well I have this being updated so let's share one more QR code with you. At Chainlink Labs we have some bounties. We have two different bounties. One is for use the Chainlink services in general like automation, data feeds or VRF to generate Randall numbers. And we have another special bount related to functions that it's a new service that we launched yesterday.
00:13:09.590 - 00:14:14.846, Speaker A: So you are the first guys that can use it. And this is so cool because the idea of function is that you can use any code that you write on JavaScript and call any API and use it using side your ismat content because it's so hard to use external servicing side ismat content because the smart content are deterministics. So we need to have the same, we have the same information and doesn't matter what time you are calling this information, you must have this information on chain to call it. So if you call an external API you can call this, save the information inside as much content and how the network can access this information and have it in the same time. Let's come back and see if I have some luck here. No, not yet. And here not yet.
00:14:14.846 - 00:14:27.598, Speaker A: So I can maintain this a bit more for you related to the bouties and do you have any questions related to chain link related to dynamic NFTs?
00:14:27.774 - 00:14:29.330, Speaker B: I got the mic here if anybody.
00:14:29.400 - 00:14:45.738, Speaker A: Has any questions, we have you on here. It's supposed to me to do this to code live with you, to have you doing with me to use the Internet. But I need to improvise now this is not a problem.
00:14:45.904 - 00:14:58.910, Speaker C: So my question is about you know how you said last night you were updating every second or every minute? So we have to pay link tokens for every time that happens, right?
00:14:59.060 - 00:15:26.802, Speaker A: Yes. You are paying link tokens not to check the conditions, but when your condition is true, yes, you are executing some function that you define it. And this moment you are paying link. For example, today, this example, it's a chrome job. A chrome job. It's a job that we only define by time. In my case, I define to be executed minute by minute.
00:15:26.802 - 00:15:49.434, Speaker A: Okay. In this case, every minute I'm paying link for this, I have another kind of execution that you can define a condition in your smart contract, and only when this condition is true, it executes some function. In this case, you are paying only when the condition is true.
00:15:49.632 - 00:15:56.410, Speaker C: And is there like a fixed amount of link we are paying every minute or does it depend on the network?
00:15:56.490 - 00:16:18.600, Speaker A: Depends of the network. Depends of the gas price. Because the concept of the gas price, we have the fixed part, that is the amount of gas that you need to pay that function. But also this is multiplied by the gas price. That can be low, can be higher. For example, today on Gurley was so high.
00:16:19.530 - 00:16:25.900, Speaker C: So it doesn't interact with the ethereum network, does it? Or is just chain link?
00:16:26.830 - 00:16:43.200, Speaker A: No, because your transaction is sent to the network. So yes, it's interacting with the network and you are paying on link, but this is being converted to it to pay the gas. Do you have any more questions?
00:16:44.930 - 00:16:50.094, Speaker B: We only have a few short seconds left. Maybe you want to check if your metadata loaded.
00:16:50.142 - 00:17:03.526, Speaker A: Let's see again, fingers crossed. Yes. Not yet. Let's see this. Not yet. Okay, well, thank you so much. I put my contacts again.
00:17:03.526 - 00:17:24.062, Speaker A: Feel free to contact me if you need some helping or projecting the hackathon. I'm here to help you. So call me. And we have other developers advocates here. I have zubing here with me. I have also Daniel over there that work at Chainlink Labs and we are here to help you. Thank you so much.
00:17:24.236 - 00:17:25.180, Speaker B: All right, give it up.
