00:00:17.850 - 00:00:26.790, Speaker A: Our next talk is Alex Bozanow from Blockboard. Short and sweet, easy defi leveraging block board. Let's give it up for Alex.
00:00:27.210 - 00:01:10.302, Speaker B: Thank you. Thanks. Hello everyone. So I'm Alex from blogboard and I'd like to tell you how you can easily integrate with decentralized finance protocols to execute short and long positions without losing the custody of your assets and without knowing the specifics of the protocols. So a couple of words about our company, what we are doing. So blogboard is decentralized asset lending platform. And with blogboard you can easily interact with different protocols like Makerdao, compound dharma.
00:01:10.302 - 00:02:15.542, Speaker B: And you can do this with Dapp. And it's okay for consumers, for customers to manually do trading and then borrowing assets, then selling it, executing short and long positions. But if you are a developer, it's not a good solution, right? So that's when blockboard lending wallet comes in. So this solution allows you as a developers to program your trading bots or other software and integrate your software with the decentralized finance ecosystem without knowing how it works. And actually it's solution. Actually I have the text for my workshop, I just forget to share it with you. So you can open this link, bitfly twobezwq two and it will contain a link to peerpad net.
00:02:15.542 - 00:03:13.450, Speaker B: It's some kind of platform for managing text and it's built by protocol labs so it utilizes IPFs and CRDT to allow you to manage text and distribute it in decentralized manner. So you can follow this text if you will stop somewhere and you can go next with this text. And let's get back to lending wallet. So lending wallet, it says it. Sure. One secret like this. Is it okay? Yeah.
00:03:13.450 - 00:04:45.830, Speaker B: So blogboard, it's a solution that gives you opportunity to engage in on chain lending over an simple HTP API in noncustodial manner. So this software runs on your server, in the cloud or at your computer and it will manage all the transactions for you. So you don't need to go deep to the microdao smart contracts or compound smart contracts. And also this solution have the integration with Kyber decks so it will allow you to sell immediately the assets that you have borrowed on one of the lending protocols and also you'll help to repay some dust. Okay, so as I mentioned, with this solution you don't really need to have any experience with web3 or smart contracts or Ethereum. So all you have to do is just to create an Ethereum account, pass it to this software and interact with this software over their convenient HTTP API. And it's really reduced the barrier for new developers to dig into the decentralized finance ecosystem.
00:04:45.830 - 00:05:42.700, Speaker B: And also this solution have the auto generated web interface. So you even don't need to do any coding in order to interact with this solution. So I will show you how to use this and how to interact with decentralized lending protocols. So first of all, you need to go to the GitHub repository with the source code and it's open source project. So you can review this if you want and you can ensure that your private key will not go somewhere else and you will be having the custody of your assets. And once you go to this GitHub repository, you can clone it to your computer. And I already did it on my computer.
00:05:42.700 - 00:07:27.540, Speaker B: So after the step, when you clone this repo, you can just install the NPM packages and then you need to pass the account, the account with the assets to this solution. Wait a sec, you need to generate a new private public key pair. You can do this with any client like my user wallet. So we need just to create a new account by keystroke file. We can generate some random password here. All right, then I can download the JSON file that contains the private key to my computer and then I can access the account on the Myzer wallet for example. So I'm pasting the password that I used when I was creating the account, it's just empty account.
00:07:27.540 - 00:08:29.590, Speaker B: Then you need to send some easer. And by the way, the lender wallet can work with Testnet, with Scowan, but not all of the protocols are working good on testnets. So to be honest, the only network when you can test all the protocols is the main net. So you need to have some real easier to try this once you created the account, you just need to send some easier to this account. Please don't send the big amounts the first place, please test on the small amount first and then if you sure, if it shows that you don't lose the money, you can try it with the larger amount. But this project is not like complete solution, it's rather MVP. So it's not audited, it's maybe not tested well, so use it at your own risk.
00:08:29.590 - 00:09:33.678, Speaker B: All right. And once you created account, you can click print and you can get the private key from maizer wallet. And then you need to go into the repositories that you have cloned and you need to paste the private key of this newly created account to the app. So on the GitHub page you will see how you can do this, wait a sec. Yeah, so in the repository you have the resources folder and the account Json. So this file contains the private key from your account with which you will interact with the smart contracts. All right, so you need just to paste the private key here.
00:09:33.678 - 00:10:36.770, Speaker B: I already done this with my account and I already have some easter on it. And after this we can run the application actually. So all I need to do is just copy this command NPM run start. So yeah, I'm assuming that you have the node js installed on your computer. If you don't have, please install some recent version and let me make it bigger. Right, so I'm running in the command NPM run start from the project directory and it started. So once the application launched I can go to this link, it's linked to localhost.
00:10:36.770 - 00:11:42.822, Speaker B: Let me open in the new tab. So we are on the third step when we are opening the auto generated user interface of the lending wallet and we can see what kind of actions I can do with my ethereum address right now with my account. So first of all I can check balance of my account. I can specify some specific token if I want to check only one balance, but if I just leave it by default I will get all my balances in all supported tokens. So for now the solution supports only wrapped ether, die, zero, x, wrap and bat. But more tokens will come up when they will have more adoption, more liquidity. Right? So it's just like probably top five, I don't know.
00:11:42.822 - 00:12:55.070, Speaker B: It's actually the tokens that support that compound protocol supports. So on this account I already sent 0.1 easter to this account and in order to interact with different protocols I need to wrap it because like whole decentralized finance system ecosystem, it works not with the ESR itself, but rather with wrapped ether. So in order to wrap the ether you can just click to this green area. It's the user interface for posting the wrap action. And actually when we send the post request to the lending wallet that runs on my local machine right now, it will create a transaction to wrap the ether and it will send it to ethereum network. So I just need to click try it out on the right corner, right upper corner, and I need to specify the amount of the ether that I want to wrap.
00:12:55.070 - 00:13:29.414, Speaker B: Just keep in mind that I need to leave some ether for gas fees. So let me convert 0.5 ether and you also can specify do you want to wait till the transaction will be mined or you want to receive the response from the lending wallet immediately. So by default. It will wait for the transaction. But I don't want to wait right now. I just want to show you what happened immediately.
00:13:29.414 - 00:14:18.780, Speaker B: So I click execute and this user interface will send the post request to the local server of blockboard lending wallet. And in the response you can see the transaction log that occurred during the execution of this rep endpoint. So it actually returns the data about the transaction that happened. And as you can see here, there is a hash field and we can copy it and paste to ether scan just to see what happened. With this it's main net transaction. So it takes time to mine. But yeah, we need to wait a little bit.
00:14:18.780 - 00:15:20.106, Speaker B: While we are waiting, I want to tell what we are going to do next after we wrap our ether into wrap ether. So actually what we are going to do in this workshop, we are going to make a cross protocol arbitrage of interest rates because nowadays on microdao we have the APR of one. Wait a second, I will show you. It's a blockboard lending wallet and sorry, blockboard platform. And you can see that for borrowing die on maker APR is like annual percentage rate is 1% but I can supply, I can lend the same die to compound with the 2.36% and by this I can earn the difference in the aprs. So that's what we are going to do.
00:15:20.106 - 00:16:47.690, Speaker B: We're going to borrow die from maker and supply it to compound and by this action we can earn some money. So let me check if transaction was mined. Yeah, we successfully wrap our Easter and we can check on the swagger user interface, the new balance of our account. So you can see that we successfully wrap 0.5 esru and with this I can go to Metrodao section of this user interface and I can easily supply my collateral, my corrupt ether that will be used as a collateral and I can borrow die in the same transaction. So under the hood this lending wallet utilizes the blockboard Makerdao gateway smart contracts that serves like a wrapper around the Makerdawa system and it allows you to do borrowing in the single transaction. So let's see, I want to supply my wrapped Easter and I want to borrow, let's say one die.
00:16:47.690 - 00:17:45.380, Speaker B: I will leave CDP id blank and in this case the blockboard lending wallet will create the new CDP for me. So let's execute this action. Yeah, probably forget to specify that I don't need to wait for the transactions. So the lending wallet will return the response only once. The transaction will be mined by default. But in the locks, actually I can just go to ether scan and we can see that the transactions were already sent to the Ethereum network. Yes.
00:17:45.380 - 00:18:25.676, Speaker B: So actually the wallet sends two transactions. First was the unlocking the wrap ether. In order to supply the tokens to smart contract, you need to unlock them first. It's like some kind of rule across all the Ethereum protocols, like protocols that are based on Ethereum smart contracts. And the second transaction will be actually borrowing the DAi with wrapped ether. Yes. So as you can see, the first transaction already successfully executed.
00:18:25.676 - 00:19:21.120, Speaker B: And here comes the second transactions transaction that will do both supply and borrowing in one transaction. Yeah, it is also successfully mined. And as you can see, we utilized the supply wrapped ether and borrow die function of the blockboard microdao gateway smart contract. And as we can see on ether scan, we supplied 0.5 wrapped issue and borrowed one die. And let's see what happened with our balances on blockboard lending wallet. Yeah, so as you can see, we already supplied all wrapped ether and now we have one.
00:19:21.120 - 00:20:29.122, Speaker B: And if we go down to the DAO section of this API, we can see there are two get requests that allows you to see the status of your cdps. So the first one will show the open cdps of the current Ethereum account. So we just opened a new CDP when we was supplying the assets. And the second endpoint will allow you to see the status of the CDP in programmatic way. So this endpoint returns a JSON with the borrowed dai balance and also with outstanding dai balance. Because in microdao you have to pay the interest rates like in every lending protocol you need to pay some APR, some interest rate in order to borrow some principal. So as you can see, this APR, I mean like this interest occurs every block.
00:20:29.122 - 00:21:40.182, Speaker B: And if we click once again, right now I have three, three, four here, and now I have 4038. So yeah, the outstanding debt increases every block, but the APR is only 1%. And we can supply this one die to the compound protocol and earn additional percent on this die. So I'm going to compound section and actually we can check the current balances in compound. So it's like a newly created credit account and I don't have any supplied balances in compound yet, but we are going to supply, let's see, we are going to supply one die. We don't want to wait till the transactions will be mined and we just send in these transactions. So as you can see, there are two transactions.
00:21:40.182 - 00:22:38.456, Speaker B: First is unlock the DAI to compound protocol and then we actually supplying the DAI to the compound. Yeah, it takes time for etherscan to update the status of this transaction. But while we are waiting, let's discuss what we are going to do next with this balance on compound. Because I just recently supplied the asset on compound. First of all, it gives me some additional interest as a lender. Okay. And in the same time I can use it as a collateral to borrow some other assets on compound.
00:22:38.456 - 00:23:40.096, Speaker B: And with this die, I can borrow some other tokens like for example, bat. And I can then sell it on Kyber exchange also from this lending wallet. And if the price of bat will go down, let's say in a week I can buy it back with the lower price and I can repay my outstanding debt and I can leave the difference to me. So actually I will be doing the shorting of bat with compound and Kyber. So let's check the transaction for the supply. Yeah. So I successfully supplied one die to compound and let me check this borrow balance.
00:23:40.096 - 00:24:14.856, Speaker B: I haven't borrowed anything yet. Let's see the supply balance. Yes, so as you can see, we supplied one die. And because we already waited a couple of blocks, I have some additional dust already. My profit already occurred actually. And we can compare it with the outstanding debt in Metrodao. And probably in a couple of minutes we will have more balance in compound than our debt in Dai.
00:24:14.856 - 00:24:53.160, Speaker B: And that's how we can make some money. Of course you need to supply some ether to make it out to borrow the die. But it's another story. Right? So now I have some collateral in compound that making me some profit. And also I can use it for borrowing some bat. So let's say I want to borrow five bat. I can check the transaction on ether scan.
00:24:53.160 - 00:25:58.048, Speaker B: And while we are waiting for the mine event, we can prepare the transaction on Kyber. So in the Kyber section we have the sell endpoint and I want to specify that I want to buy wrapped ether and I want to sell bat. And the amount that I want to sell, we can take it from the Borrow section. So yeah, I want to sell my bat. I just need to wait till. Yeah, I successfully borrowed it from compound as you can see. And let us check the borrow balance first just to ensure that everything goes right.
00:25:58.048 - 00:26:37.820, Speaker B: Yeah, so as you can see, I already borrowed the amount of bat, but I already have some outstanding interest to repay. So hopefully we will be able to do some profit with bat. So I'm selling it on Kyber. Oh, sorry, I'm trying to borrow this now. I just want to sell it. Yeah. So first of all, we need to unlock tokens for Kyber.
00:26:37.820 - 00:27:36.700, Speaker B: Smart contract. The first transaction is unlock and the second transaction is actually trade, so it takes time to update the status. But while we are waiting, I can just show you what else we can do with the lending wallet. So we already covered Majordao, Kyber section, compound section and also we have the Dharma integration on lending wallets. So you can easily fetch open depth requests or open land offers from our blogboard Dharma relayer API. And you can fill those orders right from this lending wallet. So you don't have to integrate with us directly.
00:27:36.700 - 00:28:49.430, Speaker B: Actually you need just to. For example, we just fetched the order book from blogboard right now. And if you are developer, you can create some kind of filtering logic that will filter out the orders that you are interested in and you can fill the orders that you want. Yeah, for some reason the transaction was reverted, but you can check it later why it was reverted. But the whole principle is like this. You can borrow on compound, you can borrow on maker, you can borrow on Dharma with this solution and you can sell it not just actually with Kyber, you can sell it with any decentralized exchange and we can easily integrate any dexs here. And also there is a plan for binance integration, so you can also programmatically send and withdraw money from binance account.
00:28:49.430 - 00:29:58.810, Speaker B: Actually it will takes time because you need to wait for confirmations. But you also will be able to use binance with this because there is a problem that on Dexs there is not so much liquidity nowadays. So for some big traders, it's not a solution to use DExs for short or long, but with centralized exchanges it can be done. Yeah. So let me use some smaller amount. All right, so while we're waiting for the transaction, maybe you have some questions. Yeah, if you don't have some questions, we already described the sum of the future directions.
00:29:58.810 - 00:30:51.762, Speaker B: And beside this, we are going to explore the ability to integrate this logic in some trading libraries because some traders are using some libraries for integration with exchanges so it can be helpful for them. And we also wanted to do some technical work and we are going to do better. Nons management and more integrations are coming. Actually more protocols will be integrated here and it's open source projects. So we are calling for developers to help us to build this and to allow other developers to easily engage with the decentralized finance ecosystem. Right. So thanks everyone.
00:30:51.762 - 00:31:19.900, Speaker B: Maybe you have some questions. Right, so that's it. Sorry. Yeah, let's check. Yeah, I can go to you after the presentation. We can deal with this. Yeah.
00:31:19.900 - 00:31:25.740, Speaker B: Right. Thank you guys.
00:31:26.350 - 00:31:31.150, Speaker A: All right, thank you. Everyone. That was Alex from blockboard. Let's give it up for Alex.
