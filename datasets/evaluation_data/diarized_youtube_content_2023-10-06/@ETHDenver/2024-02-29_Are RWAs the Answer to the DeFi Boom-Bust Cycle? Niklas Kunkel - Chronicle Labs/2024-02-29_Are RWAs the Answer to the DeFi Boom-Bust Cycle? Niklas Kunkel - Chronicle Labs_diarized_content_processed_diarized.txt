00:00:15.060 - 00:01:14.750, Speaker A: Okay, I think we can get started. So, hi, everyone. My name is Nicholas Kunkel. Little bit of background on me. I've been in the crypto space for quite some time, was part of the founding team of Makerdao kind of late 2016, early 2017, and was a maker dow for about six years before starting Chronicle. So what I kind of want to talk to you about today is real world assets, but I want to talk about them more with a lens of how can they help DeFi, because DeFi has a problem, and it's not what you might think. So very quick shill on Chronicle is we are an oracle protocol that spun out of Makerdao about two years ago.
00:01:14.750 - 00:02:17.008, Speaker A: We currently secure about $10 billion in TBL, making us the second largest oracle in terms of assets secured behind Chainlink. So I think in order to highlight what the problem with DeFi is, we have to talk about Maker for a second, and you'll understand why. So here's a graph of the revenue that maker has earned going back to 2021. And so if you kind of look at the dates, what you'll start to kind of realize here is that there are very much like peaks and valleys that correspond to, let's say, the hype cycles of crypto, right? So in 2021, we had DFI, summer, going into 2022, we had the bull run.
00:02:17.094 - 00:02:17.730, Speaker B: Right.
00:02:18.260 - 00:03:34.270, Speaker A: And then going into 2023, yeah, things are starting to pick up again, but we have this massive spike in revenue, and it's a little bit different than the others. And I think you'll understand why in a second. So where is all this revenue coming from? Well, this is from Makerburn.com, so you can verify all of these numbers yourself in real time. And what you'll find is that maker is currently making around $155,000,000 a year just from crypto backed loans. So these are loans against Ethereum, against Lido, staked ETH, against Wrap, BTC, and including kind of credit delegation to spark protocol, which is kind of a money market that formed in late May of last year. But I think the more interesting piece is actually where is all the other revenue coming from? And so a really good chunk of makers revenue is coming from real world assets.
00:03:34.270 - 00:05:52.326, Speaker A: And so why is this relevant? Why is this important? Well, if you look at this history of Makerdow's revenues going back to 2020, what you'll find is that in the blue, you have revenue earned from crypto backed loans. And the problem emerges that people only want to borrow against crypto when they want to get leverage, and they only want leverage when number is going up. And so what you'll find is that DeFi protocols, like maker, like Aave, like compound, like Morpho, they have this problem where they make a stupid amount of money in the bull market and they size up their teams and they expand into new product verticals. And then the bull market ends and their revenue just drops off a cliff. And all of a sudden they have to downsize, right? And they have to do these mass layoffs, they have to cut off interesting, innovative new product verticals that they were attacking, right? And they kind of go into this survival mode just trying to make it across this uncertain, uncanny valley before kind of the next cycle. And so I think to makers credit, they recognized this very early on and said, okay, we really need to diversify our revenue streams. And so real world assets was like one really attractive opportunity to do that, right? And so you were able to kind of smooth out this revenue curve, right? Where you don't just have this boom bust between bull markets and bear markets, you can at least have some floor to revenue that you'll receive from the real world asset side, right? And so here you can see that right now, makers revenues around, I would say 65% of them, or maybe a little bit less, I think around 60% of them are coming from crypto backed loans and the remainder is coming from real world assets.
00:05:52.326 - 00:05:56.250, Speaker A: And that's like a very healthy type of distribution.
00:05:58.920 - 00:05:59.670, Speaker B: However.
00:06:01.740 - 00:07:01.880, Speaker A: There is no free lunch, right. Real world assets are not this magical solution where you can just wave your wand and just start printing money like financial alchemy. There are serious kind of pitfalls that you have to consider. And I think the way that protocols are going about it right now is not the way that it should be done. So the first thing that you have to understand about real world assets is, and this is going to seem very obvious, right. But it's important is that they're not crypto native, right. The asset that we're talking about is not like an ethereum token or a bitcoin token, right? It is something completely independent where the onchain token is a representation of something off chain.
00:07:01.880 - 00:07:48.404, Speaker A: A good way to imagine this actually is bridged assets. Bridged assets are kind of a halfway analog between crypto native tokens and between real world assets. And what I mean by that is when you say you bridge Ethereum from some eth, from ethereum to another chain, or you bridge some dai, from ethereum to another chain, what you have on the other chain is not actually ethereum, right. It's not actually Dai, it's just an IOU that is redeemable in the bridge that you use to bridge.
00:07:48.452 - 00:07:49.050, Speaker B: Right.
00:07:50.380 - 00:07:52.020, Speaker A: And it has very different properties.
00:07:52.100 - 00:07:52.632, Speaker B: Right.
00:07:52.766 - 00:07:56.084, Speaker A: It's not the actual eth.
00:07:56.132 - 00:07:56.392, Speaker B: Right.
00:07:56.446 - 00:07:59.564, Speaker A: It's a eth with a little asterisk on it.
00:07:59.682 - 00:08:00.350, Speaker B: Right.
00:08:01.600 - 00:08:04.212, Speaker A: And that has kind of dramatic consequences.
00:08:04.376 - 00:08:04.848, Speaker B: Right.
00:08:04.934 - 00:09:08.132, Speaker A: It means that the liquidity for a wrapped ethereum or a wrapped die on some kind of l two is completely different from the liquidity for native die or native Ethereum on Ethereum. And so when you have a lending protocol that needs to do liquidations, it could be that DAi is super liquid, but not on that chain. And so the risk profile of the asset has changed considerably because it's not the native representation of it. And so this is the same problem, but exponentially more complex that you have with real world assets. And so I think there's kind of three or actually even four kind of main problems that you have to kind of deal with when it comes to RWas. The first is ownership. Most Rwas that you encounter today, they're not bearer assets, right.
00:09:08.132 - 00:09:22.484, Speaker A: If you happen to be transferred the token on chain, it is quite variable, depending on which RWA you're talking about, whether it's actually redeemable for the underlying asset.
00:09:22.532 - 00:09:22.744, Speaker B: Right.
00:09:22.782 - 00:09:30.340, Speaker A: There's all kinds of compliance restrictions that can come into play. The other is liquidity.
00:09:30.500 - 00:09:31.210, Speaker B: Right.
00:09:32.700 - 00:09:59.040, Speaker A: We can talk about, say, like tokenized treasury bills. Treasury bills are one of the most liquid markets in the world. Actually. It might actually be the most liquid market in the world. However, a tokenized representation of a treasury bill has no, you know, the liquidity of that has no correlation to the underlying liquidity that's represented off chain.
00:09:59.200 - 00:09:59.524, Speaker B: Right.
00:09:59.562 - 00:10:49.008, Speaker A: And so this is something that DeFi protocols then have to deal with because they have to make a choice, right. They either say, well, we either can't liquidate on chain because there's not enough liquidity, and so we have to incur this time penalty of liquidating off chain, or we're going to liquidate on chain because we can do it instantly. But the liquidity profile of that is extremely diminished compared to the native asset. Right. And so the last is kind of counterparty risk. And so this, I think, is actually the most relevant because real world assets are quite opaque.
00:10:49.104 - 00:10:49.460, Speaker B: Right.
00:10:49.530 - 00:11:06.692, Speaker A: When you see a token on chain that's kind of the UX of the real world asset, it's not actually the guts and what's happening behind the scenes, right? So just to give you an example of how an RWA might be issued.
00:11:06.756 - 00:11:07.370, Speaker B: Right.
00:11:07.820 - 00:11:30.028, Speaker A: You could have a trust, and that trust could have a beneficial owner. That is some on chain protocol. That trust is then connected to a broker, and the broker is the one responsible for doing asset transfers.
00:11:30.044 - 00:11:30.224, Speaker B: Right.
00:11:30.262 - 00:12:44.200, Speaker A: Security purchases, sales, whatever. Then you have another party that's a custodian. Frequently, this could be some kind of custody provider. Sometimes even a bank, right? Sometimes even a very large bank. And then apart from that, you could have an auditor, someone who is auditing and asserting that, okay, something is actually in custody, or asserting that the purchases and sales that a broker made, that their claims are representative of what actually happened. And so you have an enormous amount of parties that are present just for the generation and issuance of this one asset. And the problem is, from any DeFi protocol that is now trying to integrate that RWA, they're presented with this huge puzzle of counterparty risk, where each of the parties in this equation has a significant amount of moral hazard to not be entirely truthful.
00:12:44.200 - 00:12:52.236, Speaker A: And so to give you an idea of why that might be the case, let's take a look at maker as an example.
00:12:52.338 - 00:12:52.990, Speaker B: Right?
00:12:53.520 - 00:14:10.960, Speaker A: Maker has around, I think, one and a half billion dollars in credit extended into RWA kind of treasury bill exposure. Now, Maker would like to be sure that those treasury bills, like one, actually exist, that they actually are in custody, that they actually have the exact kind of duration that they're expecting, that they have the exact kind of yield to maturity that they're expecting for something that might not be a t bill, right. They might be interested in a certain risk adjusted yield or a certain net asset exposure to a certain asset class in that portfolio. The problem is, every single actor in this chain has this moral hazard to lie, because as long as maker is supplying credit, all of them are making money on fees. As soon as maker cuts off that credit line, all of them are not making any more money anymore. So when it comes to the reporting of this data, you run into this problem that you can't actually trust any of the individual parties.
00:14:11.040 - 00:14:11.476, Speaker B: Right?
00:14:11.578 - 00:15:35.330, Speaker A: You can't trust the broker. When they say, I purchased this bond, with this QCIP, with this duration, with this yield, you can't trust the custodian to tell you, yeah, I have all of this in custody. Pay me my basis on what I'm holding in custody for you. You can't trust the auditor, like, on their own. And so you end up with this web of actors and people and institutions that are quite opaque. And so this is kind of the monster problem that Defi has to overcome in order to successfully integrate real world assets. And so what I think needs to happen is that we need to get rid of the opacity, and we need to get rid of the manual kind of reporting of data, and we need to get rid of the trusting of any individual provider of data and come up with a solution that allows DeFi protocols to have real time automation in response to real time data.
00:15:35.330 - 00:15:39.296, Speaker A: And so let me explain what this means.
00:15:39.398 - 00:15:40.050, Speaker B: Right?
00:15:41.860 - 00:16:34.348, Speaker A: It means that you need to have automated reporting by all of the different entities in this chain. It means that you don't trust any of the data that any of them individually report, and it means that you try to get symmetry right. What do I mean by symmetry? Well, if the trust gives an instruction to the broker, hey, please purchase $10 million of short dated treasury bills with the following kind of duration. It should match up exactly with what the broker says that they made in purchases. It should match up exactly with what the custodian says they received from the broker and are now custody. It should match up exactly with what the auditor is confirming that the custodian has in custody.
00:16:34.524 - 00:16:35.056, Speaker B: Right.
00:16:35.158 - 00:17:45.812, Speaker A: And so only through this information asymmetry, symmetry, can you actually report data with a high confidence interval such that you are minimizing the moral hazard of getting this data from any individual actor. And so now once you have this data and you have this real time broadcasting of this data to defi protocols, now there's a ton of stuff unlocked here. And so what you've really created is an oracle. But I want you to break out of this mental sandbox that you have of an oracle just reporting price and start to think of how much more useful it can be. When Oracle reports metadata, that is anything but the price. When it comes to, say, a portfolio of bonds, you want to know what is your asset exposure to a particular asset class, you want to know what is the delinquency rate of that portfolio? What is the term? So what is the duration risk?
00:17:45.876 - 00:17:46.490, Speaker B: Right.
00:17:49.260 - 00:18:47.672, Speaker A: When protocols have this now, they can start making all kinds of automated decisions, whereas right now they're just using oracles to decide, do we liquidate or do we not liquidate? Now, protocols can say, well, let's use yield as an example. Yield optimization. Well, in this RWA over here we're earning 4%, but in this one over here, we're actually earning 6%. So let's automatically redelegate credit from this RWA opportunity to the second one. Right? Same thing with, like, asset exposure, right? We think we have too much exposure to us issuers or to singaporean issuers, right? We want to rebalance some of that exposure. Let's redelegate some credit from this bucket to this bucket. You could even think in terms of, like, risk adjusted yield, right, instead of just absolute yield.
00:18:47.816 - 00:18:48.510, Speaker B: Right?
00:18:50.080 - 00:20:35.010, Speaker A: Now, it's also in terms of safety, right. When an RWA starts to express undesirable behavior, in terms of one, maybe non performance, but two, jeopardizing kind of the credit health of the position, the DeFi protocol will need to have circuit breakers in place that can allow them to react in an automated fashion. So a good example might be the USCC DPEG, right? Protocols like maker, like Aave, like compound, were very much not prepared to handle the USCC DPEG because it required manual kind of intervention, right? And not necessarily manual intervention from, say, the team, but manual intervention from governance. And so having these automated circuit breakers is the only way to ensure that the DeFi protocol is not the one left holding the bag, so to speak. So this automation is really what is kind of critical to derisking the integration of rwas into DeFi protocols. And oracles are the way that we're going to get there. But again, it's only going to happen if we derisk the oracles from the moral hazard, right? And we just get a symmetry of information.
00:20:35.010 - 00:21:13.640, Speaker A: So should come as no surprise that this is what we're building at Chronicle. And so if this interests you, you can come build it with us.
