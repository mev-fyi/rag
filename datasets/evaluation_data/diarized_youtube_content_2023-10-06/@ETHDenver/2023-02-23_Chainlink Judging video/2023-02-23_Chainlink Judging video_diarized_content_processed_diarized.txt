00:00:00.490 - 00:00:31.254, Speaker A: Hi, I'm Richard, one of the developer advocates here at Chainlink Labs. And let's talk a little bit about judging the bounty program for this hackathon. Now, when it comes to the judges from Chainlink Labs, we'll be looking for a couple of different things. First of all, there's two different tracks that we'll be looking at, the first of which is Chainlink functions related. So if you have a project that uses Chainlink functions, that would be eligible for that track. The second is any of our other products. If you use any of our other Chainlink products, that's the second track.
00:00:31.254 - 00:01:07.162, Speaker A: You can be eligible for that. When I mention uses a Chainlink product, what does that really mean? We're looking for you to use Chainlink to make a state change on chain, you need to change something within the blockchain. Using one of our products for judging purposes, we're looking at a few different areas. The first is that wow factor. If you've done something that's awesome, that moves the web3 space forward, that brings more people into the web3 space. That's one of the key things that we're looking for. Second, we're looking at the look and feel of the project, the UI, the UX, the DX, depending on what kind of project it is.
00:01:07.162 - 00:01:41.382, Speaker A: We love to see projects that are polished and have that little bit of extra shine on them. Another area that we look at is the value of the project to the decentralized landscape in general. What does it provide to this space versus what's already there? If it's something new and novel and provides a much needed area of support, that's going to be amazing. When it comes to the judges, you will need to present live to the judges. If you're not there to talk to our judges, I'm sorry, but we're going to be skipping your project. So you will need to have that conversation with the judges. Who are the judges? We've got a couple different teams of judges.
00:01:41.382 - 00:02:13.782, Speaker A: They'll consist of a developer advocate from Chainlink, someone from another area who's a non developer, and finally an engineer from Chainlink Labs. So those three different members will make up our judging team. We talked a lot about judging, but what happens if you win? What can you win? Again, I mentioned there are two different tracks. For each of these tracks, there are ten total prizes. That's five per track. Each prize is going to be $2,000. Now, you won't be eligible to win in both tracks, but you could submit your project to both if you use more than one service.
00:02:13.782 - 00:02:30.926, Speaker A: Say you used automation and functions in your project. You could be eligible for both tracks. Just. You can't win both. We want to be able to spread the prizes out as much as possible. So that's it? That's how we're judging? That's what we're looking for. We can't wait to see what kind of projects you build and what awesome things you bring to the web.
00:02:30.926 - 00:02:32.170, Speaker A: Three space. Good luck.
