00:00:00.730 - 00:01:00.510, Speaker A: I work mainly on in protocol PBS, and I'm going to tell you about some things related to that today. So the title of the talk is mev resilient Ethereum. So it's mainly going to be an overview of the framework we are using to guide ourselves in all the upcoming changes and how can we make the protocol adapt and being us to meV. I'm also going to talk about all the supply chain, and there is a lot of infrastructure work that is going on there, both on the software side and on the data side. So if you're interested, please talk to me after. Okay, so I'm going to start with talking about the Ethereum supply chain. I'll show you some diagrams, some charts, and then I'm going to talk about the problems that MeV induces on the layer one protocol.
00:01:00.510 - 00:02:03.270, Speaker A: And then I'm going to also talk about the properties that we want for a blockchain to be like Mev resilient. And then a few ideas of how we can make Ethereum mev resilient. Okay, so probably if you work in this area, you've seen this chart many times, but I want to see the talk, but just going through that. So essentially this is the supply chain that your transaction goes through before making it into the block. So if you're a user, most of the time you use a wallet. Then this wallet either send the transaction to the mempool, or there is some exclusive orders that they send directly to downstream parties. Who are the downstream parties? So there is searchers, which is essentially bots that try to pick up your transactions.
00:02:03.270 - 00:03:19.408, Speaker A: And if they have an opportunity, they can insert some transactions before or after before submitting this to the builders. So the builders are a piece of infrastructure that is responsible for taking all the transactions and building the best block, which for them is the most profitable block, before submitting it to the block proposers. So the block proposer is the validator that is running the Ethereum protocol, and that will propose your block to be included in the blockchain. And the relay is just an intermediary that essentially facilitates the market between the builder and the proposer. Yeah, so this gray thing is what we call block supply chain. And what is MeV? So MeV is value that essentially these intermediaries can capture. And usually they capture it from users that send their transactions, mostly defi transactions.
00:03:19.408 - 00:04:06.460, Speaker A: And where does this value go? So the searchers take a small take, the builders also take a small take. Actually the take can be bigger or smaller, depending on how much competition there is in their market. And then finally the proposer is what takes most of the MEV nowadays. But this may change in the future. So now I'm going to go into what are the main problems that this thing MeV induces on the layer one blockchain. So the first problem is related to security. So MEV changes the incentives of the validators.
00:04:06.460 - 00:04:48.570, Speaker A: And this is obviously bad, because in times of high MeV, they may have a lot of incentives to not behave honestly, propose later things like that. Then the second problem is related to equity. So the honest users of the platform suffer unnecessary losses because of being extracted MeV. And the third one is like the cost efficiency. So you can think that there is these unethical users that extract value from honest users and they extract rent. So at the end of the day, the transactions are more expensive, or like the users get less value.
00:04:49.020 - 00:04:49.770, Speaker B: So.
00:04:53.660 - 00:06:06.940, Speaker A: These are all serious problems, and ethereum needs to adapt to minimize the problems that this induces. So the first principle, essentially the first property that we want Ethereum to have is that it should be robust, like there should be MEV robust incentives for validators. The honest user should suffer minimal losses, and the unethical user should extract a minimal rent. So what can we do? Or how can we do this? So the first answer is that, in a way, we are already doing it today with a piece of infrastructure that is evolving. This piece of infrastructure is essentially a combination of MeV boost, plus few parties that are participating into the ecosystem to extract MeV. But essentially, I'm going to give you a high level recipe of three steps that needs to happen for Ethereum to be MEV resilient. So the first step is extraction.
00:06:06.940 - 00:07:00.544, Speaker A: Some people that have not worked in MeV before, they ask, oh, why do we need to extract? And the answer is that essentially MeV is like a fundamental property of these commitment devices that we call blockchain. It's there. If the protocol does not organize extraction, it will happen inside channels. And this is a very big problem, because then you have security impacts, attacks, centralization, capture, that the protocol does not have a handle on. And then you also have censorship and other type of losses for users. So we need a technology for efficient MEV extraction. What does efficient mean? Essentially, like there is a potential MEV in the system, and we need a technology that allows us to extract MEV.
00:07:00.544 - 00:07:46.784, Speaker A: Almost the entire potential MeV should be extracted. So today we do this with searcher bots, builder infrastructure, and then the supply chain network, the Mevboost that I just presented. So once the MEV is extracted, then what do we do? These parties may take it for their own and extract rent. So the second thing we need to do is the protocol needs to capture the MEV. So, essentially, as I showed before, MeV flows from users into the pockets of the parties who capture. So if the protocol does not capture it, someone else will. And then the same security issues that we discussed before.
00:07:46.784 - 00:07:49.590, Speaker A: And then there is also the rent extraction problem.
00:07:49.960 - 00:07:50.710, Speaker B: So.
00:07:52.600 - 00:07:57.296, Speaker A: What do we need? We need trustless technology for efficient map capture.
00:07:57.408 - 00:07:58.070, Speaker B: So.
00:08:01.000 - 00:09:20.320, Speaker A: One thing maybe to highlight is that now I added the word trustless. So the reason being that this is really a piece of infrastructure that the protocol needs, as opposed to before, where searchers can be like parties that act on incentives set up by the protocol. So, yeah, efficient MeV capture means that almost the entirety of the extracted MeV should be captured by the protocol, Modulo, like some fair reward for the parties executing the technology. So how does this happen? Today there is EIP 1559, fees that user pay, and that they're automatically captured by the protocol. Then there is Mev boost that allows the proposer to capture the Mev. And then there is different proposals in the workings. Different parties are working on different implementation of OFA, which is order flow auction, which is a technology that essentially allows to capture MEV upstream right after the user, or the wallet sends a transaction, and the user gets immediate rebate, so gets immediate redistribution.
00:09:20.320 - 00:09:37.632, Speaker A: So now the protocol has captured MeV, what does the protocol do with MeV? So, essentially, the protocol needs to allocate this MEV in an equitable and efficient manner.
00:09:37.776 - 00:09:38.470, Speaker B: So.
00:09:40.200 - 00:10:36.608, Speaker A: Why equitable? Because if you don't allocate it equitably, then there is problems. Like, some user may be better off, some users may be worse off, and then efficiently. Essentially, what it means is that you want to pay the parties that are running the protocols, like the validators, or maybe in the future, like even the builders. Everyone that is running protocol infrastructure needs to be rewarded in a manner that is proportional to the service that they give. So we need a trustless, again, technology for equitable and efficient MEV allocation. So what does equitable and efficient mean specifically, is essentially like, you can think that every user is contributing MeV when he uses the protocol, and then the user is getting some allocation back from the protocol. Today, this may happen via EIP 1559 burn.
00:10:36.608 - 00:11:25.504, Speaker A: So if you're older, then you may get a little bit of deflation from the protocol, like burning that MeV. But essentially the property we want is that the difference between the contribution and the allocation is a fair tax, meaning that should be proportional to the externality that you impose on the platform. And then the second property is efficiency. So, part of the MEV will not be allocated to users, but will be used to incentivize validators and other parties running the protocol. And this should be efficient in a way that you just give enough incentives so that they can run the protocol honestly. And, yeah, this is pretty much it. Maybe just like a few words.
00:11:25.504 - 00:11:58.040, Speaker A: This is happening today between. With EIP 1559 burn, the proposer gets the allocation through Mavboost. And then when there is ofa, the users will get it directly. But there is many different proposals on how to advance this allocation mechanism. And this is what we are mainly working on. Okay, so, I'm done. Thank you.
00:11:58.040 - 00:12:24.986, Speaker A: So rig is my group at the EF, and we are doing some open problems. So we are working on various things, both on the new mechanism design, and then also on observing the health of the current marketplace. So we essentially going to have some open problem to help us work on this in a collaborative way. So if you're interested, you can dm.
00:12:25.018 - 00:12:25.600, Speaker C: Me.
00:12:34.470 - 00:12:38.660, Speaker A: And I think we have a few minutes for questions. No.
00:12:50.620 - 00:13:17.970, Speaker D: Hey, I'm here. So we know that some of the people in fintechs have a lot of resources in order to try and capture MeV, and potentially a part of the Ethereum network. What's the risk there, and how severe is it? And what's the way that you guys can help us prevent it?
00:13:21.140 - 00:13:26.708, Speaker A: I guess, can you maybe like a.
00:13:26.714 - 00:13:29.716, Speaker D: Broad question, but go ahead.
00:13:29.898 - 00:14:17.412, Speaker A: Yeah, this is very broad, but essentially you want to create, and this is why I'm going through all the properties, because essentially you want to create incentives for the parties extracting the MEV, so that essentially there is access to the infrastructure. So you want to decrease the barrier to entry, essentially, to parties extracting. Yeah, so that's how we are approaching it. One concrete way is like open sourcing the algorithms, exposing the private flows that these big fintech parties may have.
00:14:17.546 - 00:14:20.790, Speaker B: So, yeah, thanks.
00:14:23.980 - 00:14:30.952, Speaker A: One more. I might be way off base.
00:14:31.086 - 00:14:48.120, Speaker C: I enjoyed the presentation a lot. In some ways, flashbots is a way of sort of organizing MeV, right, for users. And this is a push to protocolize it somehow. Right. Are you working with flashbots?
00:14:48.280 - 00:15:27.650, Speaker A: Okay, yeah, we are working a lot with flashbots, actually. Mev boost, which is kind of the latest software. It was a collaboration between Flashbots and Vitalik, Danny Dankrad, and other people at the EF. So it was really developed in conjunction, and, yeah, there is kind of a direction to bring part of this infrastructure into the protocol. And, yeah, that's the main research we're doing. Okay. Thank you.
00:15:27.650 - 00:15:52.090, Speaker A: It.
