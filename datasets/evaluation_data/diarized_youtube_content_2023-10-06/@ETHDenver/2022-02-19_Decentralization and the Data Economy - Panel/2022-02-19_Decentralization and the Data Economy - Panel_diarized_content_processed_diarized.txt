00:00:05.850 - 00:00:32.738, Speaker A: Hey, everyone. How's everyone's week so far? Yeah. Enjoying the talk, the long lines and happy hours and after parties. All right, so my name is Tong Tong. I'm the co founder of we are, you probably heard of us. We are a digital asset data provider, and we combine on chain data with market data and trading data. And so we can provide a comprehensive view and data insights into the entire crypto economy.
00:00:32.738 - 00:00:48.700, Speaker A: And we serve financial institutions, token projects, defi projects, so they can do trading and research. But enough about me, and today I welcome my panel here, and I will first pass the mic for them to introduce themselves to you guys.
00:00:49.230 - 00:01:18.114, Speaker B: Hi, folks, I'm Jonathan Padilla. I was the former global head of blockchain strategy at PayPal. And so you're welcome for the bull market in 2020. And currently I'm the CEO of Snickerdoodle Labs. At Snickerdoodle, we're committed to a future where we see NFTs as being an incredible source of data for web three. We do this on a multichain basis and believe that NFTs will be in similar ways to cookies. Why the company is named after a cookie.
00:01:18.114 - 00:01:50.000, Speaker B: And our kind of ethos and values are very much focused on individuals controlling, owning and monetizing their data. And this is going to become a critical piece of the web three infrastructure, and frankly, a web three social contract where individuals are put first, as opposed to web one, which was a state of nature, and web two, which has effectively been digital feudalism with big corporations owning and controlling that data and frankly, taking out the monetary value. So great to be here today, and thanks for having us.
00:01:52.930 - 00:02:17.590, Speaker C: Almost got an applause. The applause is coming. It's there. So I'm Shiv Malik. I'm the CEO of Pool, formerly an investigative journalist with the Guardian, author of a couple of books, and been in the space since 2017 with Gollum and then streamer and with pool. What we're intending to do is build out an infrastructure layer for these things called data unions. There's actually a talk by a couple of data union builders at about 830 this evening.
00:02:17.590 - 00:02:54.660, Speaker C: So it's clearly growing. And a data union helps people aggregate their data as a collective, helps monetize that, and then share the revenue out with the members of those collectives. So they can be things like web browser plugin for web data. They can use open banking laws in Europe to do the same thing with financial transaction data, and they're all sort of taking off. Swash has about a quarter of a million members now, which makes it one of the largest dapps around. So that's pretty impressive as the ecosystem is starting to really take off.
00:02:56.230 - 00:03:43.550, Speaker D: Hey everyone, my name is Ryan, I'm co founder and CEO of Foam Space. We work on the foam protocol. It's primarily about providing a new form of location services that work independent of gps over a radio based system. This is meant to provide a new primitive for web three of a location proof that can be fraud proof and private, because currently things like gps can be spoofed and are not viable in a trustous way for decentralized economies. So this will be a kind of new piece of infrastructure that can do things like unlock payments, prove throughout this conference next year to get a unique NFT things for deliveries and supply chain and all kinds of things. So this is about new forms of data, about where you go moving away from web, two companies tracking that and taking control of your data in a new way. So looking forward to the panel.
00:03:43.710 - 00:04:15.614, Speaker A: So since you have the mic, Ryan, I'm going to start with you then. Location data is very interesting. I think with COVID that kind of forever changed the way we're thinking operate. And it's once in a lifetime, hopefully occasion, where you're like, oh my gosh, this is COVID pandemic happening. And a lot of the contact tracing, it's really based on location. Right. I kind of want to know if I've been close contact with someone that got tested positive later so I can self quarantine myself.
00:04:15.614 - 00:04:35.474, Speaker A: But then at the same time, those type of tracking with the government, tracking things like that, it's kind of violating my privacy because you're tracking me now. So with what you're building with location service and then the web, three applications, how do you achieve that balance between being useful and protecting our privacy as well?
00:04:35.592 - 00:05:24.770, Speaker D: Yeah, great question. So we've seen a lot with location around Covid and all these different tracing attempts from big companies like Google or different things, it was always kind of opt in and people felt apprehensive, like you said. And so one solution in our approach is the location check in data. We call it a presence claim. And you would interact with a radio zone in your area that's kind of offering this service. And the idea is that you're kind of keeping that private and applications will then be able to consume this data. And so when you have things like smart contracts, you can kind of opt in a way that's not just like, yes, I click, you can now track me, but kind of actually have agency and choose what contracts you're actually revealing this information to, or even if you had maybe a web of friends you could set up that some would be automatically alerted, but it would just be between your circle or things like that.
00:05:24.770 - 00:05:42.634, Speaker D: So really just kind of bringing location data in a way that's valuable and trusted so it's not spoofed, but also in a way that could be used in privacy, but then unlock different events or alerts. That's opt in. So you feel like people are not tracking who you are, but you're able to opt in who you care about. Knowing about is one way to think about it.
00:05:42.672 - 00:06:33.770, Speaker A: Awesome. Now, shiv, web two applications, right? We're generating so much data, and I think what is data economy? We're talking about it here. It's essentially how we gather data, how we organize data, how we exchange data through the whole network of providers and eventually derive value from these aggregated information, right? And in web three, a lot of applications were built, and we did many things right, and we did many things wrong in a way. A lot of people nowadays, they're sacrificing. Well, they prefer, they value convenience over their privacy, right? And I would like to be recognized to do this. I would like to have a convenience. So why is decentralization important in data economy?
00:06:34.670 - 00:07:38.222, Speaker C: So I think we probably all have a kind of instinctive sense as to why decentralizing data is really important, because you can see that the value and the control that a bunch of handful of companies, GaFam, have taken over the rest of us. Why? Because knowledge is power, and they have all of that knowledge, right? And they're worth, I think, collectively 9.5 trillion. And at the same time, obviously, they're giving us huge amounts of control. Decentralizing, that is now on the agenda of not just the people in web three, but also legislators in Europe, for example, and actually legislators around most of the hemispheres in the world, they realize that actually, if you want genuine innovation, if you want ecosystems where people are able to, for example, I'll give you one example. In the UK and actually in most countries in the west where Google operates, you basically have two choices for a map app, right? A decent one. You have Google Maps and you have waze, also owned by Google.
00:07:38.222 - 00:08:19.866, Speaker C: So you have one choice, right? That's crazy, right? Why is that? So when we live in a world supposedly awash with innovation, and yet there are two basic apps to choose from, owned by the same parent company. Again, that hits at the heart of location data, right? So we know why it's important. And I think we made a huge strategic mistake, which is, in a sense, I think we, people who believe in privacy have ended up, I think, making a huge strategic mistake which may well be controversial in this room and beyond. Human beings aren't built like that. Most human beings, the vast portion of humans, they want to share information. We're sitting all here sharing information between us all the time. I want to be able to say yes and no.
00:08:19.866 - 00:08:37.090, Speaker C: But not just no. Privacy allows you to say no very well. And of course, the people who've now stepped into that space are apple and Google and said, we'll protect your privacy for you. And the vast proportion of people believe them. So again, that's a huge, another privacy challenge. We know why it's important. Privacy isn't the way to achieve it.
00:08:37.090 - 00:08:56.294, Speaker C: You end up with something which I think is data ownership and data control. And I think when you start saying that to people, then people feel, okay, right, that's something I can work with. I can share when I want to share, and I can say no when I want to say no on my terms, in my data, my wallet, my keys, it should all be in the same place.
00:08:56.412 - 00:09:23.950, Speaker A: Yeah. Thank you. And we all know, kind of GDPR is, I would say it's a clause of failure, because how many of you guys have, like, since GDPR launched, you go to websites, accept Cookie, you just accept it. Accept all, because you just want to get on with your browsing. How is that do anybody any good? Right, the GDPR requirements. Jp, we know each other since you worked at PayPal and you joined the decentralized world. So congratulations.
00:09:23.950 - 00:09:32.446, Speaker A: And what the heck is commercializing NFT really mean? How are you going to take NFT beyond gaming and collectibles?
00:09:32.558 - 00:10:10.894, Speaker B: Well, I think it comes down to how people view nfts. At the core of it, it's one ownership, and ownership is super, super critical. And the other part of it's frankly a content lego. You can construct an NFT into a number of different applications. And I think there's a lot of excitement right now on gaming, art, collectibles. But the truth is this really kind of sells short the entire capacity of the technology. We imagine a world at Snickerdoodle of nfts being everything from coupons, receipts, licenses, tickets, music, intellectual property, academic records, and the composability of this.
00:10:10.894 - 00:11:13.922, Speaker B: And we take the totality of nfts allows a number of applications where big enterprises can finally enter web three in a way where ownership is frankly economical enough so you can extend this en masse to billions of people, we're talking about a world where there will be tens of billions of nfts, and the data behind all of those will allow seamless and frictionless interactions between communities and consumers with large enterprises. And at the heart of that, those enterprises now have the capacity to, frankly, share the value of that data with consumers and consumers. Taking control of that is something we really believe is critical. Shiv, just to kind of build off what you said about ownership and control. I think from the perspective of web three firms, our job is to empower the individual. And this kind of notion of data stewardship, where web three firms can frankly offer the infrastructure and framework for people to engage, will allow mass adoption. And that's the critical thing.
00:11:13.922 - 00:11:32.170, Speaker B: We have to design systems that are built for the 95% and not the 5%. Yes, that means we'll likely to have some compromise. But if we move the whole ball down the field dramatically towards this vision of web three, I think that's a net positive for the entirety of humans.
00:11:32.910 - 00:12:05.166, Speaker A: Good answer. And we're thinking about data economy, right today, I think data economy. I did some quick Google before I come on stage, so I'm fessing up and represents about $160,000,000,000 total market. And it's all about monetizing how to make money out of the data. Right. From that perspective, what do you guys think in webs three, what the market is going to look like and how we're going to build the data economy.
00:12:05.358 - 00:12:06.146, Speaker C: Sure.
00:12:06.328 - 00:12:58.360, Speaker D: I think a lot in web two kind of data monetization and data markets ultimately is about advertising, I feel, of how to build consumer profiles and just, okay, we want to collect data from their smart car and their phone and their buying. And it ultimately kind of comes down to the web. Two models for things like Google or Facebook or Instagram that constantly just comes down to advertising. So if we're coming from this privacy first approach, but still care about data, I think thinking about ways of what are we doing with this data that's not about building a consumer profile just to send ads, but actually building more constructive, maybe opportunities to do things like join Dows even, or different kind of tasks or different kind of things that are more productive with this data that's being aggregated. And so if you have control over of it and get to choose what markets or entities you share it to, maybe you get to choose that it's not towards building a profile to receive ads, but maybe for something else.
00:12:58.810 - 00:13:27.070, Speaker A: And speaking of advertising, right. I think on cookies, Google announced recently they're going to disable third party cookies on their browser. And that's to Shiv's point, that's really now you just have a first party cookie which is completely centralized and owned by Google. And that's how advertising is going to make money. There seems to be even increasingly so monopoly provider and market. So any thoughts there?
00:13:27.140 - 00:13:55.638, Speaker C: Yeah, look, advertising and analytics is going through a huge existential cris right now. Everything that they've built their entire, like all the systems that they've built have been built premised on by and large third party cookies and obtaining data directly from consumers. Right. They have been slightly shifting towards, okay, let's go to the website publishers themselves and get first party data is what's known as. But then they can't link all of that. So they don't know from the website, from the Guardian or from booking.com if that's the same person.
00:13:55.638 - 00:14:25.854, Speaker C: So it's really difficult to do it that way. What you really want is for the person to turn up with that data vault and you go, right, you're you, this is your data. Isn't that great? That's wonderful. Here are the ads we want to serve. Right? They're literally panicking right now because not only are they being assaulted on the privacy side of things like Facebook lost $10 billion because people who are in iOS 14.5 said, I don't want to be tracked anymore. They're also facing the deletion of third party cookies and Google doesn't even know what it's going to replace it with.
00:14:25.854 - 00:15:02.602, Speaker C: It was like two months ago, it was flocks. And then they're like, oh no, we're going to call it topics and it's still being sandboxed. And the time is ticking on a trillion plus dollar industry. So this is the perfect moment. This is the perfect moment for solutions like Jonathan's, mine and Ryan's to come along and go, look, if you want zero party data where people actually consent to sharing stuff themselves and it's held with them, it's owned by them, this is the moment. And actually they're all pricking up their ears and going, yeah, probably is a better way to do it. Let's just junk the old cookies because they weren't even purpose built for any of this stuff.
00:15:02.602 - 00:15:04.380, Speaker C: And let's start with something new.
00:15:04.770 - 00:16:06.100, Speaker B: I would just add, I think as we think about advertising on the previous points, it's going to go from this macro perspective to the micro, I mean, gamification. Richard Taylor, who's written extensively about nudges, I think. Working on how you gamify experiences both in real life and in meta and those types of metaverses is going to be extremely powerful to get people advertising, but in a way that feels like a much more curated experience. And as we think about, say, platforms like rally and what they're building with social creator tokens, that requires a heavy amount of infrastructure to have delivery of information. Let's be candid. Advertising can be annoying, but it solves a very real problem. Businesses wanting to get in front of consumers and having this process of discovery that shouldn't necessarily be feared or vilified, but it should be known that individuals should be able to profit from it and frankly, control it to make sure that they have the best possible experience with brands and other types of agencies that want to get in front of them.
00:16:07.990 - 00:16:53.886, Speaker A: Advertising is how in my opinion, there's two ways to make money out of data. Two major way. One is advertising clarity, and the second one is actually trading and financial institution use case. Right, speaking from my own experience, we've been building for the past five years transparency and insights into all the blockchain crypto trading related data. That data is generated on chain with all the decentralized finance and DeFi, we are actually empowering access, democratizing access to being liquidity providers and tradings through the blockchain technology there as well. Do you guys have any thoughts from the financial use case there as well?
00:16:53.908 - 00:17:35.120, Speaker B: I'll add a quick thought and pass down. I think this is an important use case. If we think about data, data right now by most corporations and large enterprises is seen as an ad value. And I think if we think about this over the course of the next five to ten years, at least at Snickerdoodle, we believe that data will go from being an ad value to an actual asset. And so if you're a large financial firm like Blackstone, you have terabytes of data across your portfolio companies. Now imagine a world where you can have that be an asset that is valued. And more importantly, if we think about the individual, the individual who owns her, his data, this becomes an asset that is intrinsic to them.
00:17:35.120 - 00:18:04.790, Speaker B: Andrew Yang is walking around the conference. He's talking to people, trying to raise money for his web three dow for lobbying. But he spoke about this freedom dividend in the 2020 campaign. We believe that an individual's data is very similar to what he talked about, except you can devise systems from a private sector without taxes so that people can basically get UBI from their data. And that's going to be a transformative way for people, especially in developing economies, to have an infusion of capital.
00:18:08.330 - 00:18:09.080, Speaker C: Sure.
00:18:09.850 - 00:18:49.810, Speaker D: Yes. From a location point of view, at foam, we have a lot of thoughts of how that may impact financial markets today. In financial markets, you have all these things like indexes that look at kind of different kind of commodities. So we've always kind of imagined that these location proofs are only the first step. And what could be unlocked are spatial markets, or what we call a spatial index. So we kind of would imagine that as a cross between a Bloomberg terminal and a Google Maps, where if you have interoperable data and these data markets, you could kind of visualize new kinds of financial markets. Maybe that's how much traffic a coffee shop is getting in a building and how much energy offset that building is generating and maybe how many cars are passing by in a way that's like visual.
00:18:49.810 - 00:19:01.690, Speaker D: So new ways to have financial markets that are interoperable, taking real world data that have location aspects, and then kind of being able to make new forms of value decisions of maybe what should come next in those locations.
00:19:04.110 - 00:19:17.920, Speaker A: So we have 10 minutes left. Let me ask you this. If the audience here walk away today from today's panel, remember one thing about what you do and what you're working on and the value you're bringing to the web three world, what would that be?
00:19:20.370 - 00:19:21.840, Speaker C: Golden, right? You want to.
00:19:23.270 - 00:19:30.610, Speaker D: We're working on the future of positioning, navigation and timing to offer new location services for web three that work independent of GPS.
00:19:33.030 - 00:19:52.966, Speaker C: I would say this. So we're building out, and it's been the sort of a dream of many technologists to build this kind of thing. And I think it's only been possible very recently. It's a personal data vault. So in the ecosystem, you discover a bunch of data unions. You go, great, I'll join this, this, and this data flows into your vault. You keep it in your vault.
00:19:52.966 - 00:20:33.990, Speaker C: It's also the place where it's your crypto wallet, right? So now you're controlling your vault with your keys for your wallet and your data. That's really convenient, because then you can sign in with Ethereum and suddenly you have self sovereign payments and identity. Right? And you can share your data with whoever you want or not, right? So if you want your ads to be served to you and be more refined because it's based on the data in your vault, great, switch it on. If not, switch it off, you get random ads, right, whatever it might be. So again, you go to your garage and you're like, good, I've already got my car data stored in my data vault. Brilliant. I want my mechanic to know what's wrong with my car.
00:20:33.990 - 00:20:46.780, Speaker C: Tell me before it breaks down, please. Right. I'll share it with him or her. Right. Brilliant. That's what we're building out, and that's, I think, the future that I certainly want to see. It's damn more convenient, and it gives me a hell of a lot more control.
00:20:48.590 - 00:21:30.170, Speaker B: I would say, beyond sneaker tools being the tastiest cookies out there we believe in, Snickerdool is building a privacy protocol that's focused on a multichain vision of how data infrastructure will live on web three. And at the core of that is the infrastructure for the individual to own, control, and monetize their data. And this is going to be an incredibly powerful tool set that, when built out to its full potential, will enable everything from UBI with individual data to control and monetization to allow people to be truly self sovereign and take what will be the most important commodity of this century into their own possession.
00:21:30.750 - 00:21:52.766, Speaker A: Excellent. Well, if anything, want to remember me and Ember data? I think I will talk about why we call our company Ember data. And it's really from a podcast by Nick Zabel. And he talk about blockchain as a fly trapped in Ember. And you can see it, it's immutable, but you can't touch it. Right. And it's really hard to measure it and analyzing it.
00:21:52.766 - 00:22:06.340, Speaker A: So that's our mission Amber did is we're bringing transparency into the whole crypto asset data economy, so you can have easy access to the data and build applications and tradings on top of it.
00:22:07.190 - 00:22:37.034, Speaker C: I was going to add one other thing, which is we were talking about sort of web two, having all the data, and web three, how do we kind of port it into there? It's various mechanisms to do that, but another mechanism is through policy and legislation. So confession. I'm like a big policy nerd. And what's coming out of Europe. So the first wave of stuff that came out of Europe was GDPR, and it's all privacy stuff. Right? Copied by California with the CCPA. Terrible acronym.
00:22:37.034 - 00:23:09.158, Speaker C: Can never remember it. And what's now dropping is two things. The first is that will be published next week, the data act, which I got a leaked view of. And what it says is, and this is great for you, Ryan, if you don't already know. It's all IoT objects will have to have data portability in real time, built in by design. So that means your smart speakers, your smartwatches, your car, all of this stuff will just have to add a click of a button. You'll be able to, if you own that object, port it to anywhere else you want to.
00:23:09.158 - 00:23:45.314, Speaker C: Right? So that's going to open up a huge amount of innovation in that field. And then the other piece is from, it's called the Digital Markets act, and that's dropping. That should be in law next month and it'll be enacted next year, October. So that's a deadline to remember. The walls are coming down on the silos for Gafam. The Digital Markets act says any user of those platforms will be able to port their data out of Google, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, et cetera, in real time. You can already port it out with a file and wait 30 days in an email, but now it will be updated to real time.
00:23:45.314 - 00:24:02.780, Speaker C: That's the end of Google Silo. That's the end of. I mean, I don't know how to port Facebook's data out because it's so relational to Facebook, but that's also the end of Apple and Amazon's data silos. That's it for everyone in Europe anyway, so let's see if the US then copies it.
00:24:03.710 - 00:24:04.234, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:24:04.272 - 00:24:04.982, Speaker C: Extra pointer.
00:24:05.046 - 00:24:14.014, Speaker A: Thank you. So I want to thank my Ryan, Shiv and JP for participating today. I enjoy chatting with you guys. Thank you.
00:24:14.052 - 00:24:14.800, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:24:24.050 - 00:24:27.630, Speaker C: We have about 5 minutes for questions, if anyone has any, for the panel.
00:24:32.530 - 00:24:46.290, Speaker A: Hey, this is Michelle. I have a question about consent and consent in terms of privacy, data, dignity, which is identity, and also security. And I just feel like those are interrelated.
