00:01:50.600 - 00:01:57.260, Speaker A: Buddy. Thank you for being here. Thank you for giving us some of your attention on a very active day.
00:01:57.410 - 00:01:58.024, Speaker B: I'm Alex.
00:01:58.072 - 00:02:21.984, Speaker A: I'm going to be moderating. I'll introduce these two lovely human beings in just a moment. We're going to be talking about the next wave of defi use cases, mainly focused on multi chain wallets and gaming. So, first question. Question. I'm going to have these two gentlemen introduce themselves. Your name, what you do and what makes you so happy about being here today and for this week, Chase.
00:02:22.112 - 00:03:05.060, Speaker B: Awesome. Hello and welcome, everybody. My name is Chase. I'm the co founder and CEO of Pickup, a zero commission sports betting platform that is out to change the world and revolutionize the world of sports betting. And we're doing that by empowering sports fans all around the world to play free and zero commissions all the way around. So that's what we're about. And what makes me happy is as a sports fan, a djen and a trader, I just love meeting other djens that share the vision for a bankless, casino less world where people like us are empowered and so more power to us.
00:03:05.060 - 00:03:06.500, Speaker B: It's our time to shine.
00:03:07.080 - 00:03:46.012, Speaker C: Great. Yeah. So myself, cube from Cypher Wallet, we have a booth right behind wherever we are sitting here. So we are a non custodial crypto wallet on EVM and cosmos. And to answer your question on what makes me happy being here today, very broadly, I think we've been building this company for a little over a year and it's so energizing to be here among so many folks with so much belief in this future of technology, of web3. Right. And surrounding people being so optimistic in a bear market is so energizing.
00:03:46.012 - 00:04:07.364, Speaker C: Right? Yeah. And really happy to be right next to Pickham. And I'm super passionate about this problem space because in web two, this is a very shady version of it and making it decentralized actually makes it more transparent. So, yeah, that's what makes me happy being here today.
00:04:07.562 - 00:04:21.950, Speaker A: I love it. I live here in Denver. So seeing all these people from all over the world coming together about something that they care about, it's just so dope. So thank you guys. Excited to kick it off. Going to keep it pretty high level to start. And Cubo, I'm going to start with you.
00:04:21.950 - 00:04:41.840, Speaker A: 2023 is upon us. I think we can all agree that DFI adoption has been a little bit slower over the past year. What do you see being the most important thing that we can all be thinking about and doing as we drive? Defi adoption this year and beyond.
00:04:42.660 - 00:05:58.768, Speaker C: Got it. So irrespective of this year, or even it's a previous or the next year, real use cases are always going to be driving user adoption, right? Like maybe in bull market, there is so much focus around the hype part of it, but the real thing that always had mattered is actually real use cases, right? And when I talk about real use cases, it really matters about what leverage is this technology providing for the same problem that's being solved in web two, for example, right? Of course, gaming is a great example. But my favorite example is like, for example, I always keep talking about this even in Twitter spaces, is like when I started building this company, there was a very popular decentralized casino on polygon. And the only reason why users flocked to that product was because it was so easy to just gamble with a wallet address. So anonymous, right? Like easy onboarding flow. But the users didn't care about blockchain, right? And that's a trend that we are going to continue to see where traditional problems in real world will be solved way better in web3. And that is going to really drive user adoption.
00:05:58.768 - 00:06:36.660, Speaker C: And for that to happen, all the builders out here, everybody in this building, is going to have to solve so many problems in different dimensions to really make it easy. A great analogy that I use is like 15 years back, I wouldn't have imagined my dad, sitting in a tier two city in India, would use online banking to move money around. I would have said, you are being stupid. Right? That's the stage in which we are in web3, and we're going to see that kind of stuff built with better user experience in the next few years. And it's going to happen much faster than web two, in my opinion.
00:06:38.360 - 00:07:25.110, Speaker B: Yeah, it's interesting just to build on that. I do think it's just a matter of fact that it is a lack of obvious use cases and clear benefits to the user. So really what we're trying to do is bring the web two experience into web3 when it comes to a gaming perspective, instead of trying to convolute and try to project all of these complex concepts like a liquidity pool or like yield farming. So what we want to do is not make it like a cockpit that you just first entered and have a dashboard of all these tickers, confusing numbers, and all these buttons you can click, but really just simplify the user experience and come from a player first perspective. And I think that's what would change the game.
00:07:25.500 - 00:08:19.610, Speaker A: I mean, we've got wallets and we've got gaming up here, talking about Defi adoption. And it is human nature to be drawn to the familiar. And so I love the concept of making it really easy, focusing on user experience, being really mindful about how people are using it. Now, if you guys were to put yourself in the shoes of the people who are not here, right, we all get it. We're all here the reason, right? But you're not here. You're somewhere else in Denver, and you're looking for something that's going to be thinking high level. What is it going to take to get them feeling really comfortable? What is it from a wallet perspective, from a gaming perspective, that web3 offers that's different, but still creates comfort and ease? Chase, I'll start with you.
00:08:20.220 - 00:09:27.864, Speaker B: Yeah. I think the whole advent of Defi is built on the platform of decentralized and distributed peer to peer capabilities. But from my belief, I think that, quite honestly, what we need to figure out is how can we make it fun, how can we make it more engaging? You can, of course, provide the best percentage yield in a liquidity pool, but that's a race to the bottom from a business perspective. And from a user perspective, you just set it and forget it. You're not really coming back to that. So we're trying to figure out how can we keep people engaged from a gaming perspective, have the rewards and incentives, have different challenges, have the leaderboard up in terms of how people are doing, so that even from a digital perspective, we can actually bridge the gap and make people feel closer and have that social betting experience without it feeling like a gouging, predatory environment, like a casino, would be for us. What we want to try to do is make sure that we're putting, again, player first, and so making it a play free environment.
00:09:27.864 - 00:09:47.124, Speaker B: So instead of going to the casino, you're going to Disneyland, where we're going from a commission based business to now a service based business. So regardless of whether you win or lose, and on our platform, for sure, you're going to win more and you're going to lose less. But at the end of the day, you're still walking away feeling like you got a service. So that's the big difference.
00:09:47.242 - 00:10:04.040, Speaker A: Yeah, I've never left Las Vegas feeling good, but I'm not sure if we want to get into why cube from a wallet perspective, tell us what you're thinking. The non users right now really need to see, really need to feel comfortable.
00:10:04.780 - 00:11:16.764, Speaker C: Got it. Like users outside this room, right? Like outside this building. So I'm going to set context by zooming out a bit, right? I used to work for Amazon and Coinbase before building payment rails with banking institutions. And I have seen firsthand the inefficiencies in the technology stack of financial institutions. The reason why I actually got super excited about this problem space was if you look at Internet altogether, the fundamental leverage that Internet created, it did break physical boundaries, right? The moment Amazon was like the bookstore was taken online, it created an infinite leverage in the way business was replicated and that automatically built way better user experiences, right? But the underlying system has been completely revamped, but the consumer demand is always the same. The way it's being serviced from the back end has completely be changed and huge leverage has been created. That leverage always helps you send value back to the users, right? And if you compare that with web3, the physical boundaries never got broken.
00:11:16.764 - 00:12:25.216, Speaker C: With all the problems we are talking about, if you go to a casino, you have to walk into physically, and we all know how shady online casinos are. And if you talk about financial institutions like banking has never broken these physical boundaries, right? Like all these so called fintech companies like stripe are all built around these inefficiencies on physical boundaries. And web3 for the first time is breaking that boundary, right? Like uniswap. When I saw that for the first time, 500 lines of code that serving users across 200 countries with just three developers building it, that's going to take the leverage way more exponential than what Internet did. We're going to see like billion dollar, trillion dollar companies with like ten people, right? And the reason why I'm setting this context and answer your question on what matters to the users. The moment this high leverage happens in the underlying business, that always, always translates into user value, because that's what capitalism has done at scale. There are a lot of people who complain from the previous generation saying like, oh, this new generation is so spoiled.
00:12:25.216 - 00:13:26.344, Speaker C: But the reality is that the new generation has seen amazing leverage with our time, with all the automation we have seen. And what really the users outside this room should care about is the way this underlying infrastructure will be replumbed, will create amazing user value back to them, which is what something that users are not going to really notice but are going to enjoy this benefit in the next few years, right? And that's what Internet did in the last 20 years. There is no way I could have thought about getting into the tech industry without Internet. When I learned writing code at the age of ten, I still had to walk into a library in my city in India. And today when I talk to the young people, the fact that they are learning this from Internet is like they're setting themselves apart by, like, two decades, right? And that's what I'm going to see is going to happen with Web three, with users outside this room. They're not going to notice, but they're going to radically leverage this and solve bigger things in the world.
00:13:26.542 - 00:13:49.952, Speaker A: I love your optimism. What I hear is to drive connections, simplicity, user value, and fun and health. Right? Like something that's actually healthy and feel good. And I really think that that's the vibe we have here. And so I want to turn it back a little bit. We were just outside. All those users out there who don't really use web3.
00:13:49.952 - 00:14:27.900, Speaker A: Now, let's bring it in from you guys perspective. Wallet gaming, web3, in general or specific to you, what are some of the partnerships, the connections that need to be made? This space has DFI, Dexes, oracles, cloud storage. Right on chain off chain, as you guys see it. And let's say someone in this audience was listening to the types of partnerships you're looking to create. How do you guys see web3 coming together in a more deliberate way to provide that user value and ease of experience? I'll start with you, Chase.
00:14:28.640 - 00:15:11.580, Speaker B: Yeah, that's an interesting question. I think, like you mentioned, Dexes are going to be imperative. We have wallet, noncustodial wallets. We have, of course, oracles that will power the back end for us. But one thing that I'm really interested is in the metaverse space. Imagine if we can bring an entire world of sports fans together on one platform where you could be researching your bets, making and taking your bets, and on top of that, watching and being there on the courtside with LeBron while you're betting on him, I feel like that would be the window into the next level of immersion that we need to see in order for us to really see that user adoption reach the masses.
00:15:12.240 - 00:15:15.244, Speaker A: Very cool. I was more of a Dwayne Wade fan, but whatever.
00:15:15.362 - 00:15:16.460, Speaker B: Love you, too. Both.
00:15:16.530 - 00:15:17.308, Speaker A: How about you?
00:15:17.394 - 00:15:42.372, Speaker C: I'm going to answer this question from a wallet perspective. So one of the key gaps that I'm seeing the way maybe I'm going to say something controversial, but something that's very important, we acknowledge, is you always have to work backwards from the users. And as a wallet, it's even more important. Right. And one of the trends I'm seeing in the wallet is like, oh, you write an EIP and you go implement it.
00:15:42.426 - 00:15:42.788, Speaker A: Right?
00:15:42.874 - 00:16:23.332, Speaker C: Like, a great example of that is account abstraction. I'm a big fan of that. But you don't start from account abstraction and say you're going to go integrate into the wallet. The key, the important data that's missing here is you have to work with Dapp developers like Pickm, for example, who are actually solving user problems, which otherwise is broken in web two. And if you don't talk and work with them and partner with them, you're missing a very important context while building the user experience because you're actually solving a use case there. But you're talking about account abstraction without even connecting the dots. Right.
00:16:23.332 - 00:17:15.996, Speaker C: And I think it's very important that you leverage this partnerships always working backwards from the users, only then technology really makes a difference. And I'm a big fan of how Steve Jobs talk about this like 20 years back. You don't start from technology and go try sell it to users. And that matters even more in web3. You always, always work backwards from the users. And in a stage where users are in a very early stage, the partnerships with Dapps is going to be super important for a wallet company like ours because you are building some stuff. We want to listen to you and understand what are the capabilities that you see are lacking in wallets that you believe are really that matters to solve the problems that you think your users are facing.
00:17:15.996 - 00:17:25.296, Speaker C: And without that context, I don't think wallets can build a great user experience. And I think that's a very important gap in the way wallets are being built in the industry.
00:17:25.488 - 00:18:05.412, Speaker A: Yeah, really interesting. I'm going to play the truth on the other side. I actually think the partnership of all of the people in this room in driving both education and governance of self to creating products that truly serve users based off of integrity, based off of health, and based off of a desire to grow in a really beneficial way for those out there using these products. So that's my take on it. I got a chance, so I may as well plug it. All right, I'm going to get specific. I think this is going to be my last question for both of you before we share with everybody how to find us and them and everyone else.
00:18:05.412 - 00:18:35.512, Speaker A: Anyway, Cube at Cypher, we're talking next waves of user adoption. What is Cypher looking at? Valuing, driving? That is, in your view and in your team's view, creating that next wave of user adoption. For DeFi Cipher specifically, how are you guys doing this? What is Cypher building different? What is Cypher doing that's going to really create this next wave?
00:18:35.576 - 00:19:30.972, Speaker C: Yeah, thanks for asking that question. So we just launched something called onboarding SDK in Defi denver. I specifically want to talk about that because there is an interesting gap in the user experience where there is so much on chain context about a user. For example, if you have ever on ramp through Coinbase, there is on chain data to prove that you have a Coinbase account and you have ever interacted with avalanche. For example, there is data to show that you're active on Avalanche. And if you're a first time arbitrum user, there is so much context in user's blockchain wallet address that you can use to improve user experience by saying, hey, you have a Coinbase account, but Coinbase account does not let you on ramp into arbitrum. So you start with your Coinbase account that you already have, go to avalanche, then bridge it to arbitrum to actually start using a D app.
00:19:30.972 - 00:19:50.148, Speaker C: This is a very interesting data that exists on on chain that's not being leveraged enough. And Cypher Wallet is really looking to leverage that through the onboarding SDK where the moment you connect your wallet, we just come in and generate a wizard on your D app to complete the flow before you actually start using the D app.
00:19:50.234 - 00:19:50.964, Speaker A: Right.
00:19:51.162 - 00:19:57.272, Speaker C: That's what we are really looking to really go in and solve. And that'll matter even more in a multi chain world.
00:19:57.406 - 00:20:26.128, Speaker A: Beautiful. Love that. Similar question for you, Chase. As you see it from Pickham's perspective, gaming, sports gambling. I love this idea of that platform to unite all different kinds of sports fans in general. But by way of new wave DFI adoption, as the leader of Pickham, what is it that you're pushing to see that happen on your site?
00:20:26.294 - 00:20:43.524, Speaker B: Yeah, I love that. So just a quick little timeline, right? Sports betting 1.0 was you versus the house. Sports sport betting 2.0. Now you have the ability to become the house. Got you. Sports betting 3.0.
00:20:43.524 - 00:21:26.592, Speaker B: Fuck the house. We don't need it. So now we're building all these tools like for example, a pick bot where you can set it and bet it, right? Like a dollar cost averaging bot having a bet cost averaging bot. So that we can give people the freedom to set a strategy and based off of their set parameters, the bot will place their bets and just show them the winnings, right? So that's one thing. Another thing is nft bet slips. So historically in the sports betting world, reliability on payouts on a manual, little paper that people are writing on, giving it to you after the game's done, not being able to cash the winnings right away. Super, super painful.
00:21:26.592 - 00:21:48.604, Speaker B: So making sure that all of these bet slips are immutable in nature and completely transparent. I think that is the power of the blockchain. And again, not making it a web3 app, but really a sports betting platform that is skinned as a web two platform but powered by blockchain is what we're going for.
00:21:48.802 - 00:22:16.710, Speaker A: Amazing. Use cases on ramp data coming from different wallets and providing users with new information about on and off ramp on multi chain and nfts, being in ways of true digital ownership, being able to take that, sell that, claim that, use that in an immutable way. Awesome. I know we're getting kicked off. Where can people learn more, Cube, where can people learn more? Chase, tell us more, Cube. Where can they find you if they want more information?
00:22:17.480 - 00:22:18.228, Speaker C: Right behind.
00:22:18.314 - 00:22:19.750, Speaker A: Oh, that's easy. So there.
00:22:20.200 - 00:22:27.764, Speaker B: Big yellow boot. And for Pickham, go to Pickham live or hang out with us on Twitter pickham. Underscore live.
00:22:27.882 - 00:22:29.284, Speaker A: Thank you guys so much for being here.
00:22:29.322 - 00:22:30.050, Speaker B: Thank you very much.
