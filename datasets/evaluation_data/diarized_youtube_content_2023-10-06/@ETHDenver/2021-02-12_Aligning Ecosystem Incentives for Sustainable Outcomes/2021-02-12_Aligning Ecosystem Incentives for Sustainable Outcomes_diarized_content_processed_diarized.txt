00:00:00.170 - 00:00:30.680, Speaker A: Well, next up, we have another panel that's going to be the aligning ecosystem incentives for sustainable outcomes panel with a huge group of panelists, and we're actually waiting to corral some of them in here right now. So until then, I have been told to vamp. I have my joke from last year. I can do that one first. Let's see you. My joke is you. Thank you.
00:00:30.680 - 00:00:54.542, Speaker A: What else can I vamp on? Eth Denver this year, I think, has been very different because it's virtual, but it's a little bit better that way, too. How many people do we have total, real quick? 12345. Okay. We're missing two people. So Eth Denver is virtual this year. I said, that's better in some ways, not better in others. I really miss virtual this year.
00:00:54.542 - 00:01:11.250, Speaker A: I said, that's better. Ahmed, I think you're getting echo. There you go. No problem. And I'm just really excited that we all get to come here together anyway and do stuff like go to the virtual castle and have poker and chess tournaments. It's all really great stuff. How's everyone doing today? Panelist?
00:01:12.710 - 00:01:13.460, Speaker B: Great.
00:01:13.830 - 00:01:15.666, Speaker C: Great. Very well.
00:01:15.848 - 00:01:20.598, Speaker A: How many people are on this panel? 123457.
00:01:20.684 - 00:01:26.200, Speaker D: Missing Shera. She looks like having a couple of technical difficulties, but here we see if we can get her in.
00:01:26.650 - 00:01:41.500, Speaker A: All right. Yeah, we're working on that for sure. And we also have. Oh, let's see what comments in the chat are going. All right, chat. Give me some stuff to vamp on.
00:01:42.990 - 00:01:49.598, Speaker D: I think with the format of this being fairly roundtabley, maybe you guys can take it away until she gets in.
00:01:49.764 - 00:01:52.640, Speaker A: Yeah, sounds good. You all take it away. Thank you all so much.
00:01:56.390 - 00:02:34.794, Speaker B: Okay, guys, wants to start how we talked about this right before the call, and unfortunately, Shera isn't here yet. But we are actually going to be talking about how to incentivize an ecosystem that is decentralized and ensure the sustainability of the ecosystem. And we have several views on it. Hi, Tegan. Hello. Hi. I'm not the moderator.
00:02:34.794 - 00:03:27.994, Speaker B: In fact, I'm just acting as the moderator. So let's just go around the table, and each of us can share their vision on what I'll start. So I think in terms of what we are currently doing for decentralization, we need to always make sure that the proper people get the proper incentives, and also we need to make sure that decentralization is maintained for the entire lifetime of a platform. I think those are goals and questions that we need to answer together. So my interpretation of what is sustainable is whether a decentralized platform can remain decentralized even after vcs come in, after the money comes in, even the enterprise people come in. That's what I think. What do you guys think, Pandu?
00:03:28.042 - 00:03:33.680, Speaker E: Just one thing. Since we don't have her give us a second. On your background, I think we have to introduce ourselves as.
00:03:34.210 - 00:03:56.514, Speaker B: Oh, that's actually, that's actually true because we don't have a moderator. I'm going to introduce myself. So I'm Pandu. I've been in this space for several years. I've started two blockchain consulting companies, blockchain Zoo and Blocksphere ID. I started an association of 22 blockchain companies, which is the Indonesian Blockchain association. And I started several projects.
00:03:56.514 - 00:04:25.540, Speaker B: I'm representing unique one today we're sponsoring at Denver. And, yeah, that's basically what I'm doing in this space. I'm more of a consulting person. I used to work for IBM for about six years, did a lot of enterprise it. So I came from that side of the space, more towards the tech inside of the crypto and, yeah, that's me. All right, who wants to go next? Do you guys want to do alphabetical? Ahmed, maybe.
00:04:25.910 - 00:04:42.440, Speaker C: Yeah, sure, I'll go ahead. No problem. Hey, everyone, my name is Ahmed. I'm the CEO and co founder of Biconomy. And in short, we're making web3 and the crypto transactional layer extremely easy and simple to use. Excited to be here.
00:04:44.330 - 00:05:26.600, Speaker F: Alphabetical has me next. I'm Brian, one of the co founders of Sobool IO. And my fascination around this is the different layers of the ecosystems and in particular the organizations and communities that are trying to drive change and looking at organizational behavior and organizational structures is really quite fascinating to me. The self organizing movement now, what's happening with dows, all in relation to how do we collaborate to move our mission, vision, or outcome forward and how do we do that in a sustainable way. So looking at how we're organizing within our own companies first.
00:05:27.290 - 00:05:39.500, Speaker A: All right, I got breaking news, everyone. I am now the moderator because our moderator is having technical difficulties. So let's keep going around the room and introducing ourselves. Who wants to go next?
00:05:43.390 - 00:05:45.962, Speaker B: We're doing alphabetical, so it's probably Jesse, right?
00:05:46.016 - 00:05:47.434, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, alphabetical. That's good.
00:05:47.472 - 00:05:48.154, Speaker C: Jesse, go ahead.
00:05:48.192 - 00:05:48.490, Speaker A: Okay.
00:05:48.560 - 00:06:29.580, Speaker G: Hi, everyone. I'm Jesse. I'm the founder of Variant Fund, which is a venture fund that's investing in what I call the ownership economy, which has a lot to do with aligning ecosystem incentives. In a nutshell, the idea of the ownership economy is that the next generation of Internet products and services are going to be built, operated and owned by their users, just like bitcoin, ethereum, and a lot of marketplaces in Defi are starting to be today. In order for the ownership economy thesis to come to fruition, economic incentive alignment is really key and that's my interest in what we're discussing today.
00:06:32.270 - 00:06:33.258, Speaker C: Go ahead.
00:06:33.424 - 00:07:07.460, Speaker H: Amazing. My name is Tagan Klein. I am the co founder of Edge and Node. We are the team behind the graph protocol and we are really working to make open data a public good and make indexing and querying available to every layer of the stack within the decentralized Internet, which we call web3. And my background is in traditional finance. I started in investment banking at bank of America, moved over to sales and trading at Barclays, helped to launch orchid, which is a distributed VPN backed by Andreessen and Sequoia. And I've been with the graph and edge of node for the last year.
00:07:09.850 - 00:07:48.820, Speaker E: Cool. Tom here. I am co founder of Fluence Labs. And Fluence Labs is an open application platform that I think fits right into this because we're trying to bring in the decentralized, bring along incentives to both the open source community, even larger communities. And we think we can accomplish that by a decentralized peer to peer hosting platform where revenue is shared. And prior to fluence, I helped found Hadera hashgraph when that was sort of my initial entree into everything back in 16, which feels like ten years ago at this point, or 17, but there we are.
00:07:50.070 - 00:08:19.802, Speaker A: All right, thank you all so much for the introductions. So when we talk about aligning ecosystem incentives, a big thing that just pops up into my head already is like governance and structure of the organizations, organizations that are having to cross collaborate, cross communicate in order to get things done, because this is a decentralized world, this is a decentralized community that we have within these blockchain communities. So who wants to speak up and have thoughts on how governance structures are going to work on that? Pandu sure.
00:08:19.936 - 00:09:07.900, Speaker B: I'm thinking more towards the governance related to data sharing. We need to create something that is more sustainable in terms of the data sharing perspective. Today's big data culture is actually, I think, not very sustainable since it makes companies covet data too much and then privacy becomes something not desired, especially by companies that has invested a ton of money to create a new platform. And I think that goes against a lot of things that we are thinking about identity, sovereignty, and all of the things related to your personal data. So there needs to be a way for governance to maintain the privacy of data from the outset. And I think that should be something that is the crux of all of the projects that are going out today.
00:09:09.150 - 00:09:20.990, Speaker A: Privacy is a big deal in this space for sure, and something that's very much connected when it comes to this stuff. So what else do we got from other panelists? Yeah, Brian, what's up?
00:09:21.060 - 00:10:18.740, Speaker F: Yeah, I mean, the governance one's interesting to me. I think one of the things that seems really important to me is making sure that with the governance structures that we're defining, we're making sure to bring all of the participants, like getting good at mapping all the participants in the ecosystem and bringing them into the governance system so that they are able to provide their unique perspectives and hash out sort of the signal from the noise for that larger ecosystem. If only some participants are able to come in or the power structures are sort of asymmetric relative to the total ecosystem, I think we end up with some serious problems. So I know that sounds like a captain obvious, fairly simple thing, but I'm not convinced that's happening all the time. And one that's in particular would be the way in which we're funding things right now, our funders, builders and the ultimate consumers of the things that are being created all on the same canvas or in the same arena, governing what's happening and making sure that that complex adaptive system is evolving in a healthy way and sustainable way.
00:10:20.870 - 00:10:32.920, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah, I think I get what you're saying there. There's like this need for, I guess, diversity of participants in order to get those perspectives, those fresh takes. What do other people have to say?
00:10:34.970 - 00:11:15.410, Speaker G: Yeah, I'll jump in. One lens that I think has been helpful to me in thinking about governance in the space, is I think it's useful to divide the space into two buckets. There are projects that aim to minimize governance at all costs and automate as much as possible. And bitcoin, of course, is one of those projects where there is some governance, but the protocol itself is entirely automated and deterministic. There's nothing human and subjective happening in bitcoin consensus. Everyone's just racing to solve this really complicated math problem, and it's deterministic. Governance happens outside of the scope of the protocol.
00:11:15.410 - 00:11:59.810, Speaker G: And ethereum at layer one today is kind of similar. It's governance by rough consensus. So that's one bucket of projects that try to minimize governance. And you see that at the application layer two, with projects like Uniswap and others where there's no sort of parameters in the protocol that are controlled by governance, it's all sort of automated as much as possible. And then in the second bucket, there's projects that are kind of more complicated and they require sort of subjective inputs and kind of human decision making in order for things to proceed. They can't be totally automated, they're not deterministic. And there, for those kinds of projects, you do need some kind of formal governance system in the protocol for things to keep operating as expected.
00:11:59.810 - 00:12:52.894, Speaker G: I'm excited to see a lot of innovation and how that kind of governance works. But I think there's also a lot to learn from the way subjective decisions are made in other kinds of organizations, like from corporate governance or political governance, for example, because we've had a lot of time as a species to figure out effective ways to make decisions as large groups of people. And that's sort of what a lot of these projects need to do. And so makerdao and compound governance, they have parameters that are controlled by the token holders. And there, I think some form of hierarchical decision making is likely the most efficient way to get those decisions made, but also excited to see innovation on. Now that all that's programmable, well, I'll.
00:12:52.942 - 00:13:27.886, Speaker E: Actually jump in there. So I think we should be very clear in separating consensus from governance. And so ethereum, bitcoin consensus happens, it's fine. But ethereum still has governance and bitcoin still has governance. And you have real controversies with how some of those are managed, particularly with ethereum not all that long ago. And so I think we have to recognize that even we don't like to think and talk about it. There's relatively opaque processes with small numbers of people that actually are controlling some of these protocols over time.
00:13:27.886 - 00:14:01.154, Speaker E: And an on chain governance process which is employed by some, is a whole nother way to do it, which can be very effective. My sort of take on this is it's worth considering that the governance is different for different projects with different ecosystems and different users. And my sort of main thought is that whatever you're doing, you just need to align your users with your governance. And that is very different. I think of Hedera. It's governed by enterprise. Guess what? The target market's enterprise.
00:14:01.154 - 00:14:37.080, Speaker E: It's not the rest. It's not for the whole community, right? That's a different thing. And if you have a different protocol that has a different type of target audience, then that governance should be and probably is quite different. And so I don't think it's a one size fits all, but really keeping in mind the alignment of those governors and the actual people. And so if you also think back to like an EOS just to pick names, are those governance decisions made by the same people that they want building and actually using it? Maybe not, but that's where you start to. But there's a misalignment, you run into problems.
00:14:37.850 - 00:14:49.560, Speaker A: All right, very good take. So, Tagan and Ahmed, as far as aligning ecosystem incentives go, governance, diversity of participation, anything on any of those topics that you have?
00:14:50.250 - 00:15:25.540, Speaker H: I guess on governance, we're still kind of defining the best practices. So I'm excited to kind of see what comes to fruition within the graph. What we've done is kind of had a technical council that might then turn into a dow, but that technical council has ten folks on it, each representing a different piece of the ecosystem. So we have the indexers, which are the node operators, and then we have another piece for the users and the developers that kind of represent that ecosystem, another that represent kind of the backers or the GRT holders, the researchers, and then the initial team, and that will likely expand from there. But we're kind of starting small with the governance and then expanding over.
00:15:28.870 - 00:15:58.094, Speaker C: I know this is such a heavy, I mean, before we talk about how do you define ecosystem, how do you define incentives, how do you define sustainability? And so all of these things coming together is quite heavy. But really, how I like to see things is more a from a game theoretical side, and then b, from an emotional side. Right. Because what's great about bitcoin is that, like Jesse said, it's deterministic. And so people have to be honest. And that's what's great about these systems. You're forced to be honest.
00:15:58.094 - 00:16:31.180, Speaker C: And so the game theory is correct. I feel game theory is not talked about as much anymore as it was a couple of years ago. But also there's the emotional side as well. People are moved by, and actually they make actions based on their emotions, which have a particular incentive structure for them and how they think about it. And I think those things, although are subjective, also influence a lot on how governance is really made and how people make decisions as well.
00:16:32.430 - 00:17:03.810, Speaker A: Awesome answers. So we only have about 5 minutes left, unfortunately, maybe a little bit more than that. So in 30 seconds or less, let's go ahead and go through what the ideal state of a future blockchain platform that has properly aligned incentives would have. What does sustainable outcomes look like? Like Ahmed said, what's that in your mind? What's the perfect place that we could get to that we should be striving for when it comes to sustainable.
00:17:09.190 - 00:17:55.960, Speaker C: I mean, the way I think of it is things should be fair, things should be on a merit basis, things should be very clear and communicative as well. And at the end of the day everyone's on the same level, right? And it's interesting, I'm talking to a few projects and these projects are saying, yeah, we're not going to have any employees anymore, right? Everyone's going to be on that same level. And whoever wants to commit to something, they will eventually be automatically rewarded in some way. And really how they're going to get there, it's going to be amazing to see. But I definitely see that to be sort of an initial ideal state as let's say version 1.0 if you are.
00:17:58.410 - 00:18:43.342, Speaker G: I would jump in and say the key two words, minimally extractive is sort of the ideal or platonic state of an ecosystem with aligned incentives. So key point to make there a lot of people think in crypto, if you charge any fees at all, you're doing something wrong because everything should be open source, fees should be zero. I don't think that's the case. I think fees are tenable so long as they're minimally extractive and the fees are used to route value to where it needs to go to keep the thing running, which could be to development, it could be to the participants of a protocol who are making the network valuable. So I'll leave it at that. Minimally extractive is the ideal aligned incentive outcome.
00:18:43.406 - 00:18:44.180, Speaker D: I think.
00:18:45.990 - 00:19:23.962, Speaker E: I think that's super interesting. I would add to that what we're trying to do at fluence is also grow community pretty large and align economic incentives. Those are two things. So I'd say that part of what Jesse's saying is alignment. And so if you can make sure that the people who contribute are actually compensated fairly, I think that's pretty vital to growing an ecosystem. And I think when you think about ecosystem, you think about a project, first a company, then the outside community for that. Then we've got maybe the protocol in which it's built, then maybe it's the blockchain community we're in right now and then maybe it's open source developers.
00:19:23.962 - 00:19:49.050, Speaker E: And how can we get it even bigger than that? Right? We're going from five people to 100 to 10,000 to maybe a couple of hundred thousand million to like 40 million open source developers and even bigger. And so I think what we're trying to do is build something that's even bigger, that aligns those incentives so well that it actually grows the community even larger, and that's what will make it really self sustaining over the long term.
00:19:51.710 - 00:20:51.402, Speaker B: Other people, I'd like to add to this. One of the things that we're trying to create at unique one is to incentivize a very process of decentralization. We have a totally fair launch. It starts with something that is basically launched by us, the founders, but we're pushing it back to the community, and that's the way we have structured the project itself. But what I'm talking about is more towards basically having the algorithms incentivize decentralization, make sure that a more decentralized platform is better and actually giving more kudos or help towards people who want to decentralize the platform. I think that needs to be baked in. I know there are several projects actually starting to do that, and not all of the problems have been solved yet.
00:20:51.402 - 00:21:12.660, Speaker B: But I think if we can manage to do that, then we can have platforms that are more sustainable for like, we can prevent a lot of the issues with current centralization, about current centralized control over data and privacy and everything else, as long as we can maintain a decentralized platform in a way that is incentivizable by the technologies itself.
00:21:16.630 - 00:21:18.146, Speaker A: Hagen, did you have something?
00:21:18.328 - 00:21:48.270, Speaker H: Yeah, I think one thing that we're really kind of undervaluing on this conversation is really community. And I think that community is extremely important, and we've kind of seen that obviously token economics are also important. But if you look at like bitcoin or doge, it's more so that community, and I think that community needs to be really organic and not kind of pay to play like we've seen with some projects. And so I would know community is a big piece of kind of aligning incentives for the different stakeholders within the ecosystem.
00:21:49.170 - 00:21:50.958, Speaker A: Brian, got any closing thoughts here?
00:21:51.044 - 00:22:31.120, Speaker F: Yeah, I really want to echo that. I think Ed and Tegan are kind of highlighting this, like the emotional or more intrinsic components and the extrinsic elements of this. And I think, I've been a big fan of Eleanor Ostrom's principles around building a commons. And I think in the game theoretic that Ahmed was mentioning, we need to honor both of those elements, the emotional and perhaps the other components. But I think we just want to make sure that we're not defecting on the commons. And so I think that does go in alignment with the things I'm hearing about minimally extractive and making sure rewards are flowing to the right folks. But I think at the end of the day, the goal should be that community that we're lifting up.
00:22:32.130 - 00:22:45.700, Speaker A: Awesome. And the final minute of this amazing panel we're going to go through in an alphabetical order. You get about less than 10 seconds to tell us where people can find you and if you want to shill a project. So, Ahmed, you go ahead.
00:22:46.150 - 00:23:06.870, Speaker C: Sure. So, quick note about biconomy. We're basically growing the size of the crypto economy by making web3 experiences very simple to use. And we work with many layer two networks, such as Matic, which is now Polygon, Xdai, and other base layer chains. So hit me up on Twitter Telegram. Happy to chat.
00:23:07.790 - 00:23:09.530, Speaker A: All right, Brian.
00:23:10.670 - 00:23:11.082, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:23:11.136 - 00:23:36.290, Speaker F: Sobel IO, as in my name on the screen. But what we're working on is a visualization tool for a graph of accountabilities. We need to get sort of transparent and clear of what our organizations are and our accountability structures are, and so we can be API driven. And so we're excited to work with anyone who needs a front end to these accountability graphs in their networks.
00:23:37.350 - 00:23:38.690, Speaker A: All right, Jesse.
00:23:39.590 - 00:23:50.790, Speaker G: Yep. So variant fund is the website, and we're a venture capital fund that's backing founders at the earliest possible stages. Founders building in crypto and the ownership economy.
00:23:52.410 - 00:23:55.750, Speaker A: All right, what do we got? I think it'd be Pandu.
00:23:57.130 - 00:24:11.580, Speaker B: It's unique one, degenics.com and blocksphere id. One is an art marketplace that is NFT. Degenics.com is decentralized genetics, and blocksphere id is my consulting company.
00:24:12.830 - 00:24:15.194, Speaker A: All right, Tegan, thank you.
00:24:15.232 - 00:24:32.210, Speaker H: Yes, you can go to edge and node.com. We're hiring for many different roles. Also, graph protocol on Twitter. If you're new to the graph ecosystem, I encourage you to use it as it is intended. Delegate in the network to help us secure that network. And thank you so much for hosting this panel.
00:24:32.870 - 00:24:35.618, Speaker A: And last, but finally, but definitely not least, Tom.
00:24:35.784 - 00:25:07.434, Speaker E: Thank you. Fluent Network, the website. We are a distributed peer to peer network that is characterized by rewarding any code, particularly open source authors, by giving a share of hosting revenue to the authors. So whenever any code, any applications, anything is used on the fluence network, some of that hosting revenue flows to the original authors and networks up language is live, and the blockchain launches this summer.
00:25:07.482 - 00:25:08.286, Speaker F: Thank you.
00:25:08.468 - 00:25:13.950, Speaker A: All right, thank you so much to our panelists. Thank you so much for joining us today. And you all have a great rest of your day.
00:25:14.100 - 00:25:15.440, Speaker H: Thank you so much.
00:25:17.010 - 00:25:18.318, Speaker B: Bye, everyone.
00:25:18.404 - 00:25:18.910, Speaker F: Thank you.
00:25:18.980 - 00:25:19.610, Speaker C: Thank you. Boe.
