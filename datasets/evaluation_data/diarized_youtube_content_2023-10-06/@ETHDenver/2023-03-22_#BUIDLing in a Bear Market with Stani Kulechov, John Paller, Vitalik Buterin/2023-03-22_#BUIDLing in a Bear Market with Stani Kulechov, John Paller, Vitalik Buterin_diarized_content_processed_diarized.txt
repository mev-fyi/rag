00:00:00.250 - 00:00:19.600, Speaker A: Okay, we're going to come down the home stretch. So a good friend of mine who is actually up here not too long ago, but we're to have a little bit more of a casual chat. Stannie, you want to come join me on stage here? So, Stani, the founder of Abe, we all know him. We all love him. Why don't you hang out right here?
00:00:20.450 - 00:00:22.222, Speaker B: Oh, we have an empty fridge here.
00:00:22.276 - 00:00:29.558, Speaker A: We have an empty fridge, I think. Yeah. Well, there should be beer at this time of night, right? We do have.
00:00:29.644 - 00:00:31.090, Speaker B: Happy Friday evening.
00:00:31.250 - 00:00:32.360, Speaker A: Say that again.
00:00:32.810 - 00:00:34.274, Speaker B: Happy Friday evening.
00:00:34.402 - 00:00:53.710, Speaker A: Yeah, Friday. So it's 08:00 on Friday and y'all are sitting here watching us. Come on, Colorado. Fun. Is anybody going to go to eat dance tonight? Or maybe a spork whale vip party? No, they're going to build.
00:00:53.780 - 00:01:02.720, Speaker B: Maybe we should do a surprise drive. What do you all think? Maybe we should.
00:01:04.550 - 00:01:44.484, Speaker A: I'll tell you what, I'm going to tweet right now. Okay, little alpha. So my handle is at pallorJohn. Retweet, like follow to get. If you like retweet and follow, I'm going to pick somebody who does all of those things to get a free spork. Well, upgrade. So I'm going to do this right now.
00:01:44.484 - 00:02:25.370, Speaker A: Okay. So come to at Pallor John and do that. Get a chance at a free spork whale upgrade. Now, if you don't know what that means, spork whale is our version of vip. We got rid of that name because we don't really like it because it doesn't fit the concept of contribution. Yeah, you could buy a spork whale pass if you want, but a lot of our spork whale holders are actually contributors from many years past. So you can stake 250,000 spork tokens and get a free pass every year.
00:02:25.370 - 00:02:33.800, Speaker A: So you don't have to actually put money out. It's more of an investment. Okay, here we go. Tweet.
00:02:36.220 - 00:02:36.536, Speaker C: Now.
00:02:36.558 - 00:02:56.972, Speaker A: You have to be here. I get people on live stream. Hey, can I come down and get that pass? I'm like, no, dude, you got to be here. So I'm going to pick somebody at the end. So I'm going to dm you and then we can arrange to get you your pass. Okay? So do that right now at Powell John. I just tweeted, like, follow, retweet.
00:02:56.972 - 00:02:59.730, Speaker A: Got it. So we're going to talk about.
00:03:01.640 - 00:03:02.356, Speaker B: Bear market.
00:03:02.458 - 00:03:10.310, Speaker A: Bear markets. I mean, supposedly we're in a bear. So let's start there. What's a bear to you?
00:03:11.800 - 00:04:33.840, Speaker B: Well, bear to me is, I think, kind of like a state where there's less noise, less overexcitement, less relatives calling you and asking what crypto to buy tomorrow or today, and getting messages from Facebook from people you haven't seen for 20 years and asking how to get into crypto. I think bear market is a state where you have people in the space that are really interested in pushing the space and innovation forward. And I like to call that there's a bull market, there's bear market. But after the bear market turns into a builder market, and I think that's where we are at this point. So we have a space at the moment where you have people who believe in the technology are excited about what kind of opportunities it can bring and also are here for the very long run. And I think that's where a lot of most valuable input and ideas are created.
00:04:34.980 - 00:05:19.200, Speaker A: Yeah, it's interesting because e Denver has happened. I would say out of now, this being the number 6th one that we've done, only two of them were in bull markets. And the fascinating thing is we end up with so much better projects in the bear markets. Yeah, there's like an inverse correlation. Right. Last year was a bull market and there was a lot of really great projects, but for 13,000 people, the signal was down, actually, from what we've seen before in bear markets. Is this the biddle market that you're talking about where it's.
00:05:19.940 - 00:06:38.040, Speaker B: I think it is when you have overexcitement in the space, in the industry, what happens very easily, that incremental ideas get a lot of traction and that's also a great thing. Right. So you see a lot of exciting experimentations, but when you have less demand, you actually have to start building more things that actually push the innovation far more further. And for me, especially during these kind of times, it really allows you also to talk to people who are extremely excited about what you're building. And I know there's a lot of builders here and thanks for actually taking time off your hacking and coming here to listen to us for a second. So I'm trying to give some valuable tips as well. So I think as building any product, it's a lot about talking to the users and talking to your community and having a process of iterating the product feedback and implementing and listening.
00:06:38.040 - 00:07:23.850, Speaker B: And during times like this, what's very helpful is that usually have the users that really care about what you're building or it's somehow valuable for you. And those are the users where you can get the most valuable feedback. And I still remember when we were building, even before Ave, our first protocol, Eatlend, we still have today users that we were testing the protocol in its early stages and gave valuable feedback. And that's the reason why we were able to iterate the Ave protocol to the state it is today. And I think that's something that is very valuable during times like this.
00:07:24.460 - 00:07:37.340, Speaker A: So what it sounds like you're saying is it's just better focus. There's less noise, there's more opportunity to really distill product, refine product, market fit or even retool.
00:07:38.320 - 00:08:10.100, Speaker B: And it takes time. So you don't need to be successful very quickly. There's actually more time to iterate your product and whatever you're building. And that's very important because there isn't really overnight successes, right? So it takes a couple of years or even more to get into decent adoption or get a decent user base that helps you to build a product further.
00:08:11.320 - 00:08:23.530, Speaker A: So everybody knows that you work on a lot of various things. You've got a lot of cool projects going on. What are you working on right now? What's the bear market interest that you've got?
00:08:24.220 - 00:09:23.368, Speaker B: Yeah, there's a couple of things that I'm super excited about at Aave. So first, we've been able to gather people in our team that are excited about think about web three and the Internet as a whole. So how we can add decentralization, but at the same time how we can build an Internet which benefits everyone and provides equal opportunity in finance and social participation. On the other side, mostly we're focusing on the go stablecoin. So that's a big project for our team. On the lens side, we've been building lens protocol which where the Ave protocol provides equal access to financial opportunity across globally into transparent markets. The lens protocol provides access to ownership of your online presence.
00:09:23.368 - 00:09:55.480, Speaker B: So we all know that there's 5 billion users online and almost equal amount of social media users, but we don't really have an ownership of our presence online. And what we are trying to do with lens protocol is that we are trying to bring the ownership of your online presence and the audiences you create and the connections you make to you. And that has been our focus point in creating this kind of like a social layer over blockchain.
00:10:00.780 - 00:10:21.730, Speaker A: What are builders going to build this weekend? You and I have talked about use cases and other things that we don't even have time to build. That's one of the fun things about these events, right? Because you get a whole bunch of people together where it's like you never know what you're going to see. If you wanted to see one thing that could come out of this weekend, what would it be?
00:10:22.420 - 00:11:01.256, Speaker B: I would like to see something. I mean, everyone probably has an idea. There are still people that don't have, and that's okay. End of the day, it's an experience for you. So you are the builders. You have to decide what's exciting for you and what's fun, because it's 48 hours, you want to make most out of it, but also you want to have a good and memorable experience. I would like to see things, especially on the social side, seeing some interesting algorithms being built that actually are benefiting the users.
00:11:01.256 - 00:12:17.172, Speaker B: So on the social media, we always are relying on the platform's way of creating algorithms feeds. But I think there's many alternative ways to create more transparent and public algorithms, and that's very exciting thing for me to see. On the defi side, I would like to see more payment applications. And mainly for the reason that if you think about the narrative of the blockchain, bitcoin was there to solve the idea of peer to peer value transfers and store of value. And when we look at the DeFi ecosystem today, we have a very efficient way of exchanging value, earning yield, borrowing funds against your cryptographic assets, interest rate swaps per virtuals, and all that other digital stuff. But what we don't really have at the moment is a good payment infrastructure and c payment applications. And today we're here, there's 20,000, 25,000 folks here, and we could actually start using stable coins to pay for things.
00:12:17.172 - 00:12:38.120, Speaker B: And overall, you know, replace the current intranet infrastructure that we have now with blockchain based, which brings transparency. But there's definitely things that we need to build better to actually get payments into more adoption.
00:12:38.460 - 00:12:56.050, Speaker A: No, 100%. I think I've actually seen a few projects that are actually doing that. They're working on it this weekend. It'd be cool to see what they do on Sunday. So backstage we were talking about my day job, Opolis, and you asked me what's new, and I told you you had to wait because I was going to tell you.
00:12:56.980 - 00:12:58.480, Speaker B: What is Opolis?
00:12:58.820 - 00:13:19.960, Speaker A: Well, Opolis is a decentralized employment platform. Does anybody know what is? Do we have any Opolis members here? We do. Cool. So Opolis enables independent workers to have the benefits of large scale employment without giving up their independence. Self sovereign employment.
00:13:20.860 - 00:13:21.592, Speaker B: Sound cool?
00:13:21.646 - 00:13:50.096, Speaker A: We all talk about self sovereign data, self sovereign identity, but the one use case that is core to every person's experience. I talked about the future of work. This is why I care about this stuff, is employment. And the existing frameworks are incredibly paternalistic, hierarchical and controlling. It's not really the fluid sort of dynamic future of dows and having self sovereign independence. So obelisk is powering that. So if you don't know, now you know.
00:13:50.096 - 00:13:52.400, Speaker A: But I'm actually going to show you what's new.
00:13:52.550 - 00:13:53.596, Speaker B: Yeah, I want to see.
00:13:53.638 - 00:13:54.244, Speaker A: Let's see it.
00:13:54.282 - 00:13:55.270, Speaker B: Let's see it.
00:13:55.720 - 00:14:23.552, Speaker D: In a time not too distant, the ethereal galaxy is under attack. The future of self sovereignty is in danger. Yet a refuge emerges. Megalopolis. Megalopolis. Home to the workforce, megalopolis is a galactic community of communities who value freedom and flexibility in their lives. Herbastion of freedom.
00:14:23.552 - 00:15:00.488, Speaker D: Inhabitants of megalopolis are free to work from where, with whom and how much they choose. A lifestyle of choice that hasn't existed for most in the ethereal galaxy. For many epochs, choice and freedom are the disdain of the corporati and their paternalistic overlord. Extractor. Extractor. Corporati extractor's exploitative armies seek to destroy the freedom and joy of megalopolis, the workforce and anyone who values individuality and independence. But there is hope.
00:15:00.488 - 00:15:28.850, Speaker D: Opus quay. A powerful coalition is formed between many ethereal galaxy communities. The aura of the Opus Gwe has convened as the grand stewards of megalopolis. The opusquay have been hand selected by their communities to protect the freedoms of the independent worker. Self sovereignty is secure for now.
00:15:32.660 - 00:15:39.540, Speaker A: Whoo. What do you all think? So, yeah, it's pretty cool.
00:15:39.690 - 00:16:04.510, Speaker B: That's pretty interesting. So what are the most exciting things you're thinking about? How the future of work will occur. What are the things that excites you at the moment? How we as not just we builders, but the whole humanity is going to change and how they work in the future?
00:16:04.880 - 00:16:52.620, Speaker A: Yeah, I think work is going to fundamentally change in ways that I think most people haven't even considered. I think the biggest thing that's going to really accelerate it is the opportunity for new economic engines. So play to earn work, to earn, contribute to earn attention, to earn. Once people have a choice to opt out of traditional systems, or even opt into new systems where they didn't have opportunity previously in, say, underserved communities or globally, it's going to change everything. But the problem is, if you know anything about regulators and compliance, they actually don't like dealing with independent workers. Now, there's only one reason why. Does anybody know taxes.
00:16:52.620 - 00:17:46.424, Speaker A: It is a pain in the ass for them to get you to pay your taxes. Now, we can argue about taxes and whether or not that's even a thing we should be doing, but let's just say we got to do it or we're going to go to jail, right? So if you don't pay your taxes, it's called tax evasion in the United States. And it's kind of one of those things that you don't want to get caught up in. So how do you actually create a system that allows people to have this high frequency choice where I can contribute to daos, I can be a defi contributor, I can trade nfts, I can play to earn, I can build interesting things. What's going to help me actually manage all that? So what Opelis really does is normalize this new future. So the new future is what excites me. But we have to build better tool sets and infrastructures to help people have these choices.
00:17:46.424 - 00:18:49.344, Speaker A: Because right now the frameworks that we have and the standard is corporate based employment. And it doesn't matter if you're here or in Europe or even throughout the world, we've copied this model, the corporate structure that subjugates you to a certain relational dynamic. That relational dynamic is going to move from paternalistic to mutualistic. And once it does that, where the formerly knows that his employer no longer has to take on all of this risk, which creates these behaviors, these HR behaviors, we can now have this freedom and flexibility and this choice that we haven't had before and enable people to really live much more fluid lives, much more dynamic lives, much more interesting work lives. Because, let's be honest, a lot of people sitting in the typical structure aren't that happy. They do it because they have to. So we give people the choice to opt into a new future, and building those tool sets is what excites me.
00:18:49.344 - 00:19:25.448, Speaker A: So whether it's governance frameworks or social frameworks that actually have interesting economic engines or even boring compliance platforms that have cool cartoon characters, the reason why we did this is, let's be honest, payroll benefits, taxes and employment stuff sucks. Nobody gives a shit about that. It's not cool, fun crypto stuff or AI generative art environments. It's not anything like that. It's boring. Nobody wants to do it, but it's necessary. So we're trying to make it more relatable, more accessible, to say, look, the self sovereign future matters.
00:19:25.448 - 00:19:47.380, Speaker A: It matters a lot. It matters to me. I get the good fortune of living it in a lot of ways, because I've built it for myself and for a lot of people around. And now we're here to spread it and to build it systemically to where it's immutable and so big and powerful that nobody could possibly mess with it.
00:19:47.530 - 00:20:06.484, Speaker B: I think also that when we think about topics like future of work, our work is changing all the time, and it has been changing radically since COVID So I think there should be systems where you can. I like the idea of opting in and opting out that you can actually choice.
00:20:06.532 - 00:20:06.840, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:20:06.910 - 00:20:36.868, Speaker B: And that's what web three is about. It's not about decentralization, to be honest. It's not about, you know, it's about having a base layer that anyone can access and go for, but it's basically freedom of choice. You can choose interact directly with decentralized protocols, or you can choose to use something in between that provides you value or better experience, for example.
00:20:37.034 - 00:21:11.596, Speaker A: No, 100%. I mean, we talk about this on our team all the time. In some ways, we're kind of poking the bear proverb. Compliance is not an area that's for the faint of heart. Right. So we deal with a lot of interesting things, a lot of questionable, like, how do you deal with things? But at the end of the day, choice is so important to where we're going with all of this tech, all of these systems, all of these new opportunities that we build, experiences that we build. And it's really the cornerstone of Eth Denver.
00:21:11.596 - 00:21:28.308, Speaker A: You all heard me talk about this last night. Like, we don't charge for to be here. We don't require that you do anything. Why? Because it's all based on choice. You're here by choice, where you're not here because you have to be or you paid for a ticket. You feel obligated. You chose to be here, and we want that.
00:21:28.308 - 00:21:42.180, Speaker A: We think it's fundamental to the human experience to create, to build, and to ultimately usher in the right next chapter because there are alternatives that are much less optimistic.
00:21:42.340 - 00:22:35.800, Speaker B: Interestingly, this is a bear market where actually macroeconomics play a big role. So when you think about future of work employment, a lot of things are changing now. And it's not just only, let's say, bear market in the crypto, but in the macroeconomical level. So it's actually a good time to think about the future of work, how you can actually rebuild and redesign the way we work in the society, how finance is participating, that, how social is related to that, and how all these boxing pieces or like Legos could fit. And you're here, so you have the opportunity to actually innovate on this, all cool stuff and a bunch of other things that you can hack on during this hackathon.
00:22:36.800 - 00:23:01.360, Speaker A: So one thing that I think is interesting, 6% of our applicants are ux focused. So how do we solve ux? I know you're not a UX expert. Maybe you have some thoughts on it. Maybe you know how we can answer that. Do you have any ideas?
00:23:02.020 - 00:24:03.056, Speaker B: Yeah. Us is interesting because us as a place of innovation is extremely fascinating. So there's so much innovation in us and so many clusters of innovation hubs that you can't really find the same level elsewhere. The challenge in crypto is that when you don't have necessarily clear rules, it's hard to innovate. But that's always the case with tech. So in one way I want to say is that if you are innovating in an unclear environment, it also means at the same time that you're building something new, you are in the new waters. And with every technology, you have always a set of people that are seeing the technology in a positive way and some that are seeing it as a threat.
00:24:03.056 - 00:24:47.444, Speaker B: If you go back in time and think about, for example, where the cars were invented. So there was actually laws that required three people to be in a car, right? So the driver, a mechanic, because cars broke down all the time, and one person walking 50 meters in front of the car and waving red flags like this, right? And shouting that a car is coming, automobile is coming. And that lasted for roughly 30 years. And that was in UK and us, for example. So that's just one example. Cryptography had its own battles. We had battles with the Internet, and it's the people that actually legitimize the technology.
00:24:47.444 - 00:25:32.100, Speaker B: A lot of the adoption of, for example, worldwide web and the Internet happened also through universities and use cases such as research. And it's all up to the people who actually are behind of the technology and what we are trying to achieve. And the more positive use cases we can actually build, the more adoption we get and also public approval. And I think the Ethereum moving from proof of work to proof of stake is a good example where the Ethereum blockchain produces less emissions, which actually also gets more approval in a more global level. And I think those kind of things move the needle in a more like societal sphere.
00:25:33.480 - 00:25:57.836, Speaker A: So it was kind of disappointing when I found out that Vitalik couldn't be here in person. We love him. He's been here almost every year. He is obviously the spirit animal that inspired the spirit animal of the buffacorn in some ways. And it was really kind of a sad thing. He's got a lot to say. It seems like things like payments and.
00:25:57.858 - 00:25:59.916, Speaker B: The things we're talking about, ux user experience.
00:26:00.098 - 00:26:09.580, Speaker A: Yeah. So, gosh, wouldn't it be cool if maybe we could have a chat with him right now?
00:26:09.730 - 00:26:10.928, Speaker B: Yeah, but how?
00:26:11.094 - 00:26:11.904, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know.
00:26:11.942 - 00:26:12.144, Speaker C: Maybe.
00:26:12.182 - 00:26:17.180, Speaker A: We just think it wouldn't be cool. You guys want to talk to Vitalik?
00:26:17.340 - 00:26:18.768, Speaker B: Should we get him here?
00:26:18.934 - 00:26:28.256, Speaker A: What do you think? Oh, my God. Look at those. You asking. You shall receive Vitalik.
00:26:28.368 - 00:26:31.030, Speaker C: I get to talk to people through the cyber. Amazing.
00:26:31.560 - 00:26:32.404, Speaker A: Can you hear us?
00:26:32.442 - 00:26:34.856, Speaker C: Okay, I can. Can you hear me?
00:26:34.958 - 00:27:10.850, Speaker A: Fantastic. Give it up for the av guys. This was not exactly the easiest thing to Vitalik, you know, recently you've been talking a lot about things like payments and Ux and adoption type of things. Stani and I have been talking about building in a bear market, and we'd like to hear a little bit more about your thoughts on, say, ux. And what are the next steps for this? Do you think you got it in you to give us a little bit there?
00:27:11.860 - 00:28:49.264, Speaker C: Yeah. So I think just start off kind of the general, big framework that I have for what we need to be doing over the next ten years, right, is basically that the 2010s were a decade of very early stage discovery. Lots of theory, lots of very base level infrastructure and applications largely focused on basically existing crypto geeks and people who really wants to early adopt stuff. And the next ten years are going to have to be the decade of actually getting to real use cases that are actually directly usable in very concrete ways by millions of people, including people who would otherwise have nothing to do with crypto. And people like this exist in all parts of the world, right? Like, practical need for crypto is, in a lot of cases stronger in places like, say, Latin America and Africa and Southeast Asia than it is in places like the US, right? Because, yes, you can get said, deplatformed and censored in those things, but at the same time, the average case is that there are baking systems and they do kind of work, but in a lot of these other places, even that is just totally not true. Right? And a lot of those regions depend a lot more on international transactions, whether it's for business or remittances or other things. And traditional ways of doing things across countries just don't even exist yet.
00:28:49.264 - 00:29:27.800, Speaker C: Right. So there's much more severe international problems, much more severe problems with local, centralized infrastructure and just all of these things. Right. But at the same time, I think it's important to acknowledge that crypto in its current form still has a lot of problems with regard to its ability to be used in these places. Right. And later on I'll talk in a bit more detail about this. But lots of people in Latin America use cryptocurrency, including ethereum.
00:29:27.800 - 00:30:20.770, Speaker C: And how do lots of them use it? Well, often the answer is binance. Right? And on the one hand, I think we have to be appreciative to binance for just being there when none of the other big global providers are in many cases, and just providing them some way that people can go and actually use things. But at the same time, I think it's also important for the ecosystem to move toward more decentralization. And we have to ask the question of how can we actually improve the decentralization, or how can we actually improve the user experience of the decentralized approaches and actually get the decentralized approaches to the point where people are willing to really use them and not get scared as soon as there is the first time that they see a problem.
00:30:24.260 - 00:30:32.208, Speaker A: So it's Alec, you got about 15 more minutes of stuff for us, right? So I think Stannie and I are.
00:30:32.214 - 00:30:32.976, Speaker C: Going to see it.
00:30:32.998 - 00:30:48.330, Speaker A: Yeah, we're going to step off the stage and I just wanted to say the buffacorn misses you and demands a hug the next time you come. Okay, I was instructed to tell you this, so I'm sorry.
00:30:48.940 - 00:31:02.076, Speaker C: Next time I come, I am happy to hug the buffercorn and even any friends that the buffercorn ends up making by the time next one comes around.
00:31:02.258 - 00:31:15.264, Speaker A: We will hold you to that. So thank you so much for spending your really early morning with us and we'll give the stage to you. And then after he's done, that's a wrap. So take it away.
00:31:15.302 - 00:31:34.570, Speaker C: Vitalik sounds good. Okay, let's see what we can do, guys. Do you guys see the sharing? Testing? One, two, three.
00:31:37.340 - 00:31:41.290, Speaker A: Like 5 minutes ago they freaked out.
00:31:43.920 - 00:31:51.010, Speaker C: Just want to confirm that people are seeing the slides and hearing me and hearing me. Seeing me would be nice, but a bit less important.
00:31:57.250 - 00:31:59.360, Speaker B: Yes, we are seeing this.
00:32:00.370 - 00:33:30.394, Speaker C: Amazing. Okay, so concrete challenges in user experience, right? So I think, as I kind of said in my introduction, lots of people have a clear and deep need for ethereum based applications today. These tools that we're building are tools that are not just providing an opportunity for people to have fun and kind of express their love for freedom and decentralization as ideals and make money and lose money and all of those things. These are things that lots of people, even people who have no attachments to these principles, actually just really need to use, and lots of people are using them. Sometimes these applications are currency, but other times it's also more complicated things that people get interested in. Like I was recently on a trip to Africa and I was actually surprised by just how much interest there was in the concept of like the concept of local groups coming together and creating some kind of circle of trust is something that is already native to a lot of cultures there, which I thought was something fascinating, right? And today it's payments. I expect that ZK based things are things that people are going to start having a need for in the future, even the whole ethereum identity ecosystem at some point.
00:33:30.394 - 00:34:18.010, Speaker C: But the problem today is that a lot of people are accessing these things using centralized services. And centralized services are convenient, they do the job, but ultimately centralized services, in my view, especially centralized services in these really core positions of control where they're not just on the side providing a useful tool like either scan, but they're really running the experience. They're ultimately not the end goal of crypto. Right. And I think in general, we know what the problems with centralized services at their worst can be. Right? So I'm sure people have seen this guy. I saw on the Twitter that there is apparently even some toilet paper of him.
00:34:18.010 - 00:35:20.798, Speaker C: But people trusted a guy because the guy looks professional and the guy said the right things. The guy, virtue signaled his love of social impact. The guy, even virtue signaled the version of the social impact meme that appeals to nerds. And he went on panels with lovely chaps like Bill Glenton, and it turns out that he had double spending relations with people's assets. Now this, I think was correctly identified by a lot of people as really showing the risk of just being okay with relying on centralized services at a large scale. Right, but the challenge is that if we want people to actually use decentralized services, we have to really address the challenges and understand why they are not winning right now. And the two big reasons are basically one, fees, two, user experience.
00:35:20.798 - 00:36:32.422, Speaker C: Now fees we're not going to talk about because fees are being solved by layer two, scaling and roll ups and optimism, arbitram, polygon, scroll, tyco, Starknet, ZK sync and that whole ecosystem and EIP 4844 and dank sharding and protodank sharding. And we've kind of heard that whole story. User experience is the other really big and important piece. So a bit of a personal story. So a year ago, I went to a coffee shop in Argentina, right? And the coffee shop accepted, had an owner who recognized me and had a crypto wallet. And so we asked if we could pay in ETH, and we did, and it was a really lovely interaction and we all enjoyed it. But at the same time, some of the details of actually attempting to make the transaction from my side showed what some of the issues are, right? So fees were high, right? So transaction fees just to send some eth while I was on this visit in 2021 were somewhere between one and $5.
00:36:32.422 - 00:37:05.918, Speaker C: In 2022, they dropped down to below one dollars. Now they're finally picking back up again, and we're, I think, cheering that our ultrasound money is ultrasound again. But we also have to remember that the flip side of that is that it is again more expensive to send transactions. Transactions take a long time to get accepted on chain. Once you click send, you have to wait a long time for it to get accepted. And once a transaction is accepted, there's even problems on the merchant side or the application of the recipient. Services often don't see the transaction immediately.
00:37:05.918 - 00:37:58.354, Speaker C: Like, even when they have a facility to show transactions that are unconfirmed, they often don't even show it unconfirmed for some amount of time. So subux hurdles there now, EP 1559, it is generally viewed as an efficiency improvement reform and as the thing that created the whole ultrasound money thing. But I think it's important to remember one of the ways at which the efficiency improving side of it manifests, which is that it massively reduces waiting times for people trying to send transactions. Right? So blue here is before AP 1559. This yellow orangey color is after AP 1559. Average waiting times decreased by a lot. And both in theory and in my own personal observation, the merge actually decreased waiting times even more.
00:37:58.354 - 00:38:38.826, Speaker C: Right. By making block times more stable, it's reduced the average amount of time you have to wait until the next block from 13 seconds to 6 seconds. And roll ups with pre confirmations could potentially make some kind of initial confirmation of payments pretty close to instant. So lots of things actually happening on the transaction accepting front, right? But this is not the only problem. So back in 2013, when I was visiting San Francisco for the first time, and this was around the time when I was writing the Ethereum white paper. And so at the time, Ethereum did not exist yet. And so I was excited about bitcoin.
00:38:38.826 - 00:39:15.974, Speaker C: And I remember that I was told that there was a swabbly sushi place beside the Internet archive that accepted bitcoin for payments. So I went there and I paid in bitcoin. But the problem is that when I tried to make the payment, my Internet did not work. Right. And after my Internet did not work, I basically kept trying, kept trying. And eventually I had to basically walk over about 50 meters to get closer to the Internet archive, hop onto the Internet Archive's wifi and send the transaction. Consumer Internet is not 100% reliable.
00:39:15.974 - 00:40:15.530, Speaker C: My Internet on, literally my smartphone is not 100% reliable. There are just times when it stops working for some number of seconds, and this is just a thing that happens to people. So how do we solve this? Right, what happens when a consumer tries to pay in person and the Internet doesn't work? So auction one is merchants could just have wifi and consumers could connect to the merchant wifi. But this is kind of slow and cumbersome when you have to figure things out and fiddle with passwords these days you can scan QR codes, which is a bit better, but even still. And then there is my preferred solution to this, which is this is one of these things that feels like something that would make an Apple engine UI designer scream, because it just feels ugly and it's not sleek, but in my opinion, it's just obviously the correct thing to do. And it doesn't try to be optimal. It tries to be robust, and it tries to just provide clear solutions even when things fail.
00:40:15.530 - 00:40:59.674, Speaker C: Basically, your wallet as a sender, it should auto detect if your connection to the Internet fails. And if that happens, it should show the signed transaction as a QR code, and then the merchant can just scan the QR code. And on the merchant side, the merchant's app can automatically broadcast the transaction and the merchant can check the transaction locally. And if the merchant accepts it, then of course the merchant would be able to just immediately accept the payment. So if we do this right, then we don't have to rely on, necessarily, consumers having great Internet. You have a backup option only relying on the merchants having great Internet. And if you do this, then merchants are more likely to have reliable Internet than consumers are.
00:40:59.674 - 00:41:25.506, Speaker C: They are businesses, they are in one place, they have Wifi and all of these things. And this would considerably improve the user experience for people trying to make payments. Right. So I would just love to see more wallets just automatically have this as an option. Moving beyond payments, social recovery and multisigs. So I have been a big fan of social recovery for years. I've been a big fan of multisigs for years.
00:41:25.506 - 00:42:50.266, Speaker C: Literally, my money is on the line, right? The bulk of my own ETH is in a multisig wallet and that has most of the keys controlled by other people who are guardians. And I think things like this are a necessary innovation in account security for regular users. Right? Regular users are not going to be able to do a good job with twelve word passphrases and not accidentally forgetting them or losing them again. I remember when I was still not yet using my multisig and I created a clubber scheme where I basically randomly generated two numbers that added up to my private key and held them in different places and separately had a backup. And even then I was almost scared every day that something would happen to one and then I would have to figure out whether or not the backup works and maybe the backup would not work either. Right? I personally just feel so much better with a multisig, so I think this stuff is necessary. Innovation and account security go beyond trying to rely on just yourself for regular users, and it needs to be done well, right? So one of the nightmare stories that I had is, I remember a few years ago, this was before COVID I was beta testing a social recovery wallet that was not using the smart contract based approach.
00:42:50.266 - 00:43:52.002, Speaker C: They were using the approach where they basically secret shared your private key and they sent a shard of your private key to your guardians. But the problem is that this required your guardians to install a custom app and they have a communication channel directly with them. And that communication channel ended up frequently breaking. And then when as the guardians just lived their lives because they used their app for only this one purpose, they would inevitably end up forgetting it when they switched phones. And eventually I end up losing several money, right? My strong view is that any of these recovery things should not require guardians to have custom infrastructure, they should just be based on guardians existing ETH addresses. Now remaining questions one is how do we help non Ethereum users safely be guardians? So what if you want your mom to be a guardian, but she doesn't have an Ethereum account yet? Still an unsolved ux problem. Maybe for that particular case you want to create an option to rely piggyback off of something other than an Ethereum account.
00:43:52.002 - 00:44:53.622, Speaker C: But then the question is like what would it be? And one option might be that if you have three non Ethereum users as guardians, then one of them guards by having some a private key stored on iCloud, another one guardians by having their private key stored on a Tencent cloud, and a third on something that's geopolitically independent from both of those and so that way you get to both have enough protection against something happening to any one individual guardian, but also, you're not actually relying on any one specific one of these cloud providers to be safe. Right. And you have your company diversification and jurisdictional diversification and all of these things. Privacy, this is a big one. Some of the people that I've talked to, when I suggested to them that they use multisig, they responded with the critique that they did not want guardians to know what assets they have. Right. And this is just an important financial privacy thing for them.
00:44:53.622 - 00:45:50.360, Speaker C: This can be solved. There are ways to set up a multisig or a social recovery wallet in such a way that the guardians don't actually know what they're guarding. And this can and should be done. I mean, there is an easy version where they don't know until they actually have to recover something, but there is a harder version where they don't know even after that. And then the last thing is just like, social norms around authentication, right? Which is if you ask someone to be your guardian, they need to know that if you ask them to help you send a transaction or recover your key, they should not accept immediately just because you sent them a telegram message, because, well, if that's the norm, then someone could steal your wallet just by hacking your telegram. Right? So the education part of this is that they need to remember that they have to ask you something that only you would know. Right? Like, one simple thing is just, like, to ask them about a specific detail of the last time that you did something together in person.
00:45:50.360 - 00:46:45.178, Speaker C: So social recovery multi six, privacy is another big one. Privacy is still important. Privacy is still a human right, and privacy continues to be a key protection against powerful institutions at their worst. And privacy is something that modern networks, technology does not have by default. And so we try harder. Now, Amin recently made this tweet and announcing that there's going to be this privacy pools v zero, the sequel to Tradeo cache, which I think is great, right? But at the same time, one of the things that's important to really make sure with privacy is that it's very important to make the privacy actually be private, even in the hands of people who are not perfect, who sometimes growed up. Right? Amin himself, just to give an example, he's also been very supportive of Iranians fighting against their authoritarian government.
00:46:45.178 - 00:48:28.630, Speaker C: And I think it's a great and honorable cause and absolutely stands with all the women who wants to have their life and freedom there. But at the same time, if you think about the intersection of these two things. This gets into the point where we're using privacy technology to do some real serious shit, right? This is not kind of idealistically larping privacy, this is like actually using privacy to protect people. And so we don't just need to think about privacy as something that where we just think about it in the abstract and we know we have zero knowledge proofs and all of these things, but really need to think about really what is the concrete privacy? What is the threat model? Are we sure that people who use cryptocurrency and zcash and various privacy tools that are important are not actually accidentally going to lose their privacy because they just accidentally do one thing that they shouldn't? And I personally actually accidentally broke my privacy by fumbling around with tornado the Runway about a year and a half ago. So this is an important thing to guard against, right? It's like easy to accidentally leak data even if you're using fancy decks. One of my views is that I think wallets probably need to think about this more explicitly, like you want better separation of profiles and wallets probably more defaults toward one wallet per application. One other idea I can talked about recently in my blog is stealth addresses.
00:48:28.630 - 00:49:16.474, Speaker C: And stealth addresses is something that would really need some deep wallet level integration. Wallets should have more directed integration of privacy tools. Another thing is just better defenses against the off chain side of tracking and finally better defenses against Ethereum node providers. Seeing everything, right? And these are things that I think we can improve on, but these are things that we actually should improve on a lot. So kikushas again, right? So 2010s were the decade of theory, 2020s are the decade of building out large scale adoption. And there's important obstacles to this, and fees are a really big one. But user experience is also a really big one, and it's important to actually keep working on these really specific user experience issues.
00:49:16.474 - 00:50:24.800, Speaker C: And to finish off with one sociological note, I think this all shows one of the reasons why it's important for core developers, wallet developers, client developers, application developers to get out more, right? If your city has a place that accepts payment for ETH in person, actually go to it and actually support them. Pay for something with ETH in person pay for something with ETH online. Use your ens name to do stuff. Actually use all of these different applications more once in a while and this will just, I think, give you a better and much more practical view of what really are the missing pieces that are annoying people. And if you have friends, then try to convince your friends to use Ethereum for online and in know payments and other applications and see what kinds of problems they encounter. Right. So I hope that over the next few years, this is something that we can do more of.
00:50:28.610 - 00:50:33.900, Speaker A: Thank you, Vitalik. We really appreciate you taking the time, my friend.
