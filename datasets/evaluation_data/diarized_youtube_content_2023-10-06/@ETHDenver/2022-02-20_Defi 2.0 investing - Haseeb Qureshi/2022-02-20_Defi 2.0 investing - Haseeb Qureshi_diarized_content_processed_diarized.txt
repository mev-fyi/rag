00:00:00.570 - 00:00:20.798, Speaker A: All right, so I'm going to be talking today about DFI 20. If you're not familiar with D five 20, don't worry, this is just the talk for you. So real briefly, let me just introduce myself. So I'm Haseeb. I'm a managing partner at Dragonfly Capital, which is a global crypto venture fund. Previously I was a general partner at another crypto fund called Metastable Capital. It's one of the oldest funds in the space.
00:00:20.798 - 00:01:02.378, Speaker A: I've made early investments into projects like Avalanche, near protocol compound, Makerdao, bunch of crypto projects, both in layer ones, layer twos, DFI, everything up and down the stack. I used to be a software engineer in a former life and a startup founder, so I have a lot of different perspectives on understanding all this stuff and understanding DFI. And so DFI 2.0 is something that is very near and dear to my heart, and I'd like to help explain it because I think it tends to be one of the parts of DFI, especially kind of the new generation of DFI, that's very opaque to a lot of folks who are coming into crypto for the first time and just trying to wrap their head around the 1.0 stuff. So in this talk, just to kind of give you a bit of a roadmap. So first, I'm going to start explaining kind of what the hell is going on in DFI.
00:01:02.378 - 00:01:30.090, Speaker A: In case you just emerged from a cave and this is all new to you, I'm going to talk a little bit about what is DFI 1.0, what are its strengths and what are its shortcomings. Then we'll talk about what is DFI 2.0. We'll go through some of the advantages and benefits, and we'll profile a few of the kind of namesake projects in DFI 2.0. And then finally we'll end by talking about what's coming up next, and then I'll leave some time for Q and A. So that's the game plan. So first of all, DFI, it's big.
00:01:30.090 - 00:02:05.842, Speaker A: Probably you guys have heard of many of the names. Now in DFI, it's become a more and more mainstream concept. There's been this explosion of startups and investors and founders working on all this stuff. And it's not just in the number of companies or the number of protocols, it's also the total amount of value in DFI. So back when I first started investing in DFI, this was like 2018 2019, back when DFI was just a bunch of proverbial dudes in a garage tinkering with ideas. That kind of seemed crazy at the time. And it was more of a cool idea, almost like an experiment that maybe something could become of all of this.
00:02:05.842 - 00:02:23.226, Speaker A: And now DFI is obviously enormous. It has grown from something like ten x in a single year. And the year before that, it grew another ten x. So it's massive. Back in January 2020, DFI had less than a billion dollars in total value. Now it's over 200 billion. And same thing.
00:02:23.226 - 00:02:53.730, Speaker A: You've seen the same similar growth for loans in DFI, which is one of the dominant areas where DFI has been very successful trading volumes, largely. This big pink bar you see here is Uniswap. Largely driven by Uniswap, trading volume in crypto has grown dramatically. Sorry. Trading volume in DeFi has grown dramatically, to the point where routinely DeFI trades more volume than Coinbase on any given day. Almost always, DeFI trades more volume than Coinbase. And if you look in total trading volumes, we've hit over a trillion dollars traded in DeFi over the last year.
00:02:53.730 - 00:03:22.866, Speaker A: So incredible numbers and numbers that I can tell you the early cohorts of folks who were working on DeFI had no idea that it was going to grow this fast or become this big. But here we are today. So let's talk about a few of the kind of DFI 1.0 names that I imagine are familiar to some of you. So the first one is compound. So what the hell is compound? Compound is a protocol that allows you to get a loan from a smart contract, so you can think of it as just a decentralized lending market. There's no paperwork, you have to call up a bank.
00:03:22.866 - 00:03:38.114, Speaker A: You just get your loan entirely on the blockchain. So, pretty amazing. Second protocol. Uniswap. Uniswap is responsible for most of the trading volume today in DeFi. Uniswap allows you to swap any blockchain asset for any other blockchain asset. It's a decentralized exchange with no order book.
00:03:38.114 - 00:04:04.266, Speaker A: It's a little complicated to explain exactly how it works, but it's super plug and play, super easy to use, and it all happens very cheaply or relatively cheaply on the blockchain. And then third is Makerdao. So Makerdao is. You can sort of think of it as like two mental models for it. One is like a decentralized central bank. The second is as a decentralized credit facility. It allows you to borrow against your assets in us dollars, which is very cool.
00:04:04.266 - 00:04:34.578, Speaker A: It mints sort of unbacked us dollars with no us dollars anywhere in the system. So it's super cool. It allows anyone in principle, if they have assets in crypto, they can get access to us dollars without having a bank account in America or a bank account anywhere for that matter. So the big thing about each of these three protocols, so one, they were all very early. So compound, uniswap, makerdao, they were all working on this stuff way before DFI summer, compound, I think, got their start in 2017. I want to say Uniswap was like 2017, 2016. They were first working on this.
00:04:34.578 - 00:05:06.414, Speaker A: I think it was 2016 when I think it was the guy from gnosis who suggested, or no, Vitalik suggested this idea to the guy from gnosis and then Hayden saw this and decided, oh, I should do this as a protocol. Maker Dow is like, I'm pretty sure maker Dow is 2016. When Maker Dow first raised money and came up with the idea that they were going to do this, and then eventually in 2017, they actually launched the first version of it. So these are all super old protocols. And not only are they old, they're very safe. It, they're very simple and they just work. Okay, so part of the philosophy behind DFI 1.0
00:05:06.414 - 00:05:48.754, Speaker A: was. So one is that the primitives you see in them are very simple. So what are the primitives that we use in d five 1.0? So one is liquidity mining. Is there anyone here how many people know what liquidity mining is? Okay, so not everybody. So liquidity mining is basically the idea that most startups or most companies, when they want someone to use their project or their product, they will basically give incentives, right? So they'll some kind of referral code or whatever, this kind of stuff, right? You sign up on our service and you get $20 for free. Well, what you do in crypto is instead of paying those incentives in cash, instead you pay it in equity or in the native token of this protocol and you sort of cut out the middleman, right? Like a normal startup.
00:05:48.754 - 00:06:26.354, Speaker A: Let's say you're Uber and you want to pay your drivers to get drivers in a new city because you're starting a new city and you got to give them some incentive to start driving. What you would normally do is you'd give them a bunch of money. You'd say, hey, I'm going to give you each $50 if you come and drive for me. Well, what DFI does is says, look, Uber has to go raise money from vcs, get the cash and then give the cash to the drivers. Well, in crypto land, we can just give the drivers just tokens, because the whole thing is tokens and it's all native on the blockchain. We don't need to go through that extra rigmarole to give people the incentives to help bootstrap the overall ecosystem. But not only that, now they're aligned with us because of know some people who will liquidity mine.
00:06:26.354 - 00:06:58.926, Speaker A: They might sell the token and go get cash, but some of them will just hold on to the token, in which case those people are now long term aligned with me in a way that an Uber driver who maybe is like, oh, I like Uber, but I'll also drive for Lyft might not be. So that's liquidity mining. And liquidity mining really kicked off with the ad of compound, which was the first protocol to do liquidity mining slightly inadvertently, but turned out to be the shot heard around the world. And now tons and tons of projects in DFI do liquidity mining. But even liquidity mining is almost a feature of DFI 2.0, DFI 1.0. You see makerdao, or sorry, not makerdo compound, doing liquidity mining.
00:06:58.926 - 00:07:25.590, Speaker A: You saw ave also do some liquidity mining, but uniswap basically had very limited liquidity mining and then stopped. And even makerdao does no liquidity mining. So not all d five 1.0 protocols even do liquidity mining. The second primitive is bonding curves. So this was one of the things that really made DFI 1.0 kick off, is realizing that if you price things along a curve continuously, you can do things really efficiently on chain.
00:07:25.590 - 00:08:00.194, Speaker A: That the things that preceded DFI 1.0, which you might call DFI 0.1 or something, which is things like Dharma v zero, which was basically, people would post, I want to borrow this much at this APR, and someone else say, oh, I don't like that. I'm not going to take that. And so it's very people, it's like a bulletin board, right? Everyone has a bespoke thing. And of know, ether Delta, the first big Dex on Ethereum, ether delta was an order book, which is kind of the same thing, right? It's people posting an order, someone else takes the order, but it's very one by one. Every individual person needs to get matched.
00:08:00.194 - 00:08:29.210, Speaker A: And bonding curves allowed you to aggregate a lot of that information continuously, much cheaper and much more efficiently on chain to allow everyone to be able to play, even if no one was there on the other side. To take the other side of the trade. You sort of trade against a pool of the protocol. So Uniswap, use a bonding curve to beat ether delta compound, use a bonding curve to control the interest rate. Otherwise, how do you know how much you should be borrowing and lending at? And many of the protocols in d five 1.0 use this concept of bonding curves. And then finally you have insurance funds.
00:08:29.210 - 00:09:05.026, Speaker A: So insurance funds are this idea that, look, it's possible, especially in some of these risky protocols, that if things go haywire, that we may need to backstop the protocol, right? So bitmex very famously had a big insurance fund. Binance has the Seifu fund. Many primitives in defi need the same thing because there is some inherent risk. It's not a riskless endeavor to be borrowing and lending against other people in a pool. And so a lot of the motivation, and you can kind of see where a lot of the thinking around DFI 1.0 comes from, especially when something like an insurance fund is that DFI 1.0 was all about survival.
00:09:05.026 - 00:09:21.246, Speaker A: In DFI 1.0, no one cared about D five 1.0 was watching. In those early days, it was like, look, if you fail, if you mess up, if something goes wrong, if there's a smart contract hack, you are on your own. No one is going to save you. And so it's survival of the fittest. And so in D five 1.0,
00:09:21.246 - 00:09:42.790, Speaker A: you can see everything is optimized around survival. Everything is like, look, we want to make sure that makerdao is still around 100 years. We want to make sure that compounds still around 100 years. And as a result of that, there's less emphasis on capital efficiency and more emphasis on robustness now. So that was the first thing about D five 1.0, which is very easy to notice when you look at all the protocols. The second thing about DFI 1.0
00:09:42.790 - 00:10:47.494, Speaker A: is that when they started engaging in liquidity mining in the early days of DFI, what? You realize that there's a lot of mercenary liquidity mining out there, where basically people just come in, they mine the token, and they just dump it, and they don't stick around, they don't actively become participants in the protocol. And this caused, in the early days of DeFi, there was this Pollyanna ish assumption that if you had people who came in and liquidity mind your protocol, they were going to become users. And it's like customer acquisition, right? You give some token incentives, they take the token incentives, now they hold your token, and now you're a big happy family. And in reality, what they found was, no, no, actually what happens that Alamator comes in, they farm all your tokens, they dump everything on retail, and the token just, it's basically just pure selling pressure. And that made people realize, like, hey, if we are going to be doing liquidity mining, we need to be really thoughtful, but what are we actually getting for the liquidity that is being offered? It's wrong. People began to realize, to think about liquidity mining as a way to acquire customers. Liquidity mining is instead a way to acquire liquidity, and not even to acquire liquidity, but rather to rent liquidity.
00:10:47.494 - 00:11:08.682, Speaker A: And this is a realization that would come fully fledged in the arrival of D five 2.0. The third thing is that protocols in D five 1.0 are minimally levered. There's very little leverage in DFI 1.0. You can get leverage in something like makerdao or in something like compound by borrowing recursively, but the protocols themselves are not levered. Right. And they also don't have a lot of interconnections or interdependencies.
00:11:08.682 - 00:11:31.370, Speaker A: So compound doesn't depend on Uniswap. Uniswap doesn't depend on makerdao, because remember, they were all born out of this state of nature. And so they all kind of assume, like, look, I don't know if makerda is going to get hacked. I don't know if compound is going to go underwater. So I can't rely on them, I can't string them along together. Otherwise we're going to end up in some great financial cris type scenario where one thing goes down and the whole financial system comes down. That's what DFI was trying to avoid to begin with.
00:11:31.370 - 00:11:51.294, Speaker A: And so the philosophy in DFI 1.0 is everything should be self sufficient. No bailouts, no interconnections, everything, if it fails, it fails on its own. And of course, DFI 1.0 really only used the simple primitives and composed them in very simple ways. Now, that brings us to DFI 2.0. So what is DFI 2.0?
00:11:51.294 - 00:12:17.798, Speaker A: So the first thing is that DFI 2.0 is not a specific thing. There is not sort of one thing you can point to that makes something D five 2.0. D five 2.0 is more of a family of design choices and ideas and patterns that now have come to characterize more of the next generation of D five protocols. So what's different about D five 20? So the first thing is that you see that there's a lot of improvements in capital efficiency. So remember D five 1.0?
00:12:17.798 - 00:12:42.574, Speaker A: Everybody was just about survival. D five 20 is about, okay, how can we make things more capital efficient? And how can we make things more composable? Because D five 1.0 kind of didn't like composability in some sense. Composability in D five 1.0 is like, okay, it's nice if you can use compound, but I kind of don't want uniswap using compound, because then we're coupled with each other, and then if we fail, everything could explode, and we kind of don't want that. And D five 20 is like, hey, yeah, come on, bring on the composability. Let's merge this stuff together.
00:12:42.574 - 00:13:14.790, Speaker A: Let's remix things. There are a ton of innovations that are emblematic of D five 20. So one of them is PCV, which stands for protocol controlled value. Lot more flexibility in staking new incentive and governance designs like vote escrow tokens, which we're going to talk about. Concentrated liquidity, insurance coverage, smart contracts, impermanent loss protection, structured products, lots of new concepts that are pretty esoteric. It's not like lending or trading. It's like going kind of farther and farther down the tree of complexity in finance.
00:13:14.790 - 00:13:40.462, Speaker A: And then lastly is it's higher risk. Almost everything in DFI 2.0 has moved up the risk curve. And what that means is that not only are those risks in composability, there are a lot of protocols that now codepend on each other in D five 20. There are also risks in leverage. There are more leveraged protocols in D five 2.0. And when I say leverage, I don't mean leveraged in the sense that you can get leverage through this protocol, but I mean that this protocol is itself implicitly levered.
00:13:40.462 - 00:14:09.926, Speaker A: And so if the market goes down two x market goes down 50%, this protocol might actually lose more than 50% of the overall value. And there's some kind of reflexivity in DFI 2.0 that wasn't really there in DFI 1.0. And there are generally just fewer checks and balances around this risk threshold. Now, of course, DFI 2.0 all emerged after DFI summer. DFI summer, for those of you who don't know, was the massive growth and catalyst that happened in DFI in the summer of 2020, after Covid.
00:14:09.926 - 00:14:39.730, Speaker A: That's when DFI really started taking off and growing dramatically. And of course, since then, we've basically been in a non stop bull market. There's been very high yields on chain, there's lots and lots of money. And very few things fail when everything is going up or everything has gone relatively up compared to where it started. Now. I mean, you could argue maybe now we're in slightly bearish sentiment, but at the end of the day, very few things in DFI so far have failed. And the last time that we had a really severe drawdown was in March 2020, when Covid hit.
00:14:39.730 - 00:14:56.854, Speaker A: That's the last time that we saw a really cataclysmic event that hit all of DFI. And DFI 1.0 survived it. But it's quite likely that a lot of stuff in DFI 2.0 could not survive a March 2020s type sort of three sigma event. And that's by design. These protocols are intentionally levered.
00:14:56.854 - 00:15:15.934, Speaker A: And of course, when you're in good times, more and more leverage is natural. It kind of happens as a kind of natural evolutionary byproduct of a free market. So what are some of the primitives in DFI 2.0? D five 1.0, we talked about bonding curves and liquidity mining. D five 2.0 has a few tools that it likes to use in a lot of the protocols.
00:15:15.934 - 00:15:34.134, Speaker A: So one is protocol control value. And protocol controlled value is the idea that your protocol has its own balance sheet, and using its balance sheet, it does shit. So d five 1.0 protocols, they have balance sheets. Uniswap has a bunch of uni tokens. Compound has a bunch of comp tokens, but they don't do anything. It just sits there.
00:15:34.134 - 00:16:00.334, Speaker A: And maybe they do grants or something, right? But they don't go around and muscle the market with a huge amount of money they have on the balance sheet. But this is exactly what tribe does. Or Faye, which is a stablecoin. This is exactly what Frax does, right? Frax uses its balance sheet to mint unbacked Frax and go do stuff in the market. And this is new. This is more like what you'd see out of a central bank, where they use their balance sheet to go do stuff. Whereas makerdao is like a central bank, but it never does anything.
00:16:00.334 - 00:16:29.842, Speaker A: It's a central bank that just, I don't know, the Hong Kong dollar or something. It just sits there and it's like, I'm just a dollar. That's it. I have no other aspirations in life, and the PCv crowd is very different. So the second thing is liquidity as a service and liquidity as a service. The idea of, like, look, when you guys did liquidity mining, liquidity mining was basically renting liquidity from retail. When you do liquidity mining, basically what you're doing, you put up a bounty, you say, hey, I'm going to pay out this many tokens to whoever gives me liquidity.
00:16:29.842 - 00:17:00.500, Speaker A: And people give liquidity to the protocol. And essentially when you stop giving up that bounty, the liquidity goes away. That's what we see, right? We see this very cavalier mercenary capital that is the same thing as renting capital. Renting liquidity, it's equivalent to a rental. So you'renting liquidity from retail. Now, renting liquidity from retail is fine, but you could also, I mean, you could do what real grownups do, which is rent liquidity from professional liquidity providers. And that's what we've seen is sort of the rise of daos that are effectively professional liquidity providers, which is Tokamac, Olympus pro.
00:17:00.500 - 00:17:42.046, Speaker A: Now, the third category is what's called vote escrowed governance. So, vote escrow governance, you've seen this ve thing, ve prefix. This ve prefix, what it means is vote escrowed. And what vote escrowed basically means is that if you want to participate in governance, you need to lock your tokens, and the longer you lock them, the more governance power you get. It's basically a way of saying like, look, you can't just buy up a bunch of Google stock and then go do like a corporate takeover of Google, which you can't anyway, because the founders control too much. But imagine you could. The idea in vote escrow governance is that actually what we're going to do is we're going to avoid the situation where people come in in a very cavalier way, and they come in and they try to take over the protocol by buying a bunch of governance tokens instead.
00:17:42.046 - 00:18:21.178, Speaker A: The longer you commit yourself to illiquidity in this protocol, the longer you sort of tie your hands and say, yes, I'm going to be a part of curve, or I'm going to be a part of convex. You get more power in the protocol based on how long you tie your hands and lock and throw away the key. So that's vote escrow governance. And the last thing, of course, is strong memes. So you guys are probably aware of this, especially with Olympus, Dow, Wonderland, Mim or Abercadabra. These are communities really tied together by a lot of memetic power. And the emphasis on memes, the emphasis on these kind of very online and active kind of trolley communities, is very different from d five 1.0,
00:18:21.178 - 00:19:04.038, Speaker A: right? There is no uniswap troll army, but there is a Wonderland troll army. And this has become more and more emblematic of how these communities form and how they also get early adoption and diehards who end up being very committed to the protocol and keeping it running. Now, liquidity, this liquidity part is interesting, right? Because we've started to move further and further down the spectrum from what started with pure retail being the way that we satisfied liquidity on chain, to moving more and more to protocol rented liquidity, which is what Tokomac does. Tokomac is basically a market maker. That's a protocol. And so you can say, hey, tokamak, I will pay you some money implicitly, if you will market make my token. And Tokamak's like, okay, I will do that just like a regular market maker.
00:19:04.038 - 00:20:04.262, Speaker A: It's like paying jump or some other citadel to market make your token, and then you have Olympus Pro. And what Olympus Pro does is basically allows the protocol to itself own the liquidity. So in a way, it allows the protocol to itself become its own market maker, which is again, a lot more similar to what a central bank does. A central bank goes in and market makes its own currency, right? It basically goes into the market, it buys, it sells in order to make sure that it hits its price targets. That's what essentially Olympus pro does. It allows other protocols to do the same thing, to go in and own their own liquidity, which in this case, owning your liquidity means you are the market maker, you are the one buying and selling and setting price and giving everyone liquidity in the market. And that is now increasingly a thing that's being taken over by protocols themselves, which in a normal world, if you think about it, if you zoom out far enough and imagine this from the perspective of normal corporate governance, it's kind of like, imagine if Google was like, hey, we are going to be the buyer and seller of all Google stock.
00:20:04.262 - 00:20:31.570, Speaker A: And everyone who wants to buy or sell Google stock, they buy it from us. It's kind of strange, but that's in fact what Olympus pro enables. It enables anyone to sort of become this. So let me walk you through a few examples of some of these D five 2.0 names. Some of these I'm sure you have heard of, others of them you are maybe very deeply familiar with, as I'm seeing from some of the reads on your guys faces. So Olympus Dow, I'm not going to belabor exactly how Olympus Dow works, because if I tried, I would break your brains.
00:20:31.570 - 00:21:14.334, Speaker A: But I'll tell you what it portends to be, which is that it says that it's a decentralized reserve currency protocol, but it's not pegged to anything. Okay. The big thing about Olympus Dow that I think connects it to most of the other things in D five 2.01 is obviously the PCV. So the protocol controlled value, which basically means that Olympus basically takes, it basically buys up its own liquidity to make it. So that Olympus is basically the market maker for ohm. And that allows it to be the kind of central bank for Ohm because it owns all the liquidity and therefore it doesn't have to worry about cavalier or mercenary capital coming in and jumping in and out of the liquidity pool.
00:21:14.334 - 00:21:44.106, Speaker A: Instead, it's all owned by the protocol. And so this is a very new model compared to what came before. And then, of course, the memes. Right? So you guys have probably heard of this meme. Three, three. Again, I'm not going to explain what this meme means because it will also break your brain, but it basically is effectively a rallying cry for the holders of Olympus Dow of the Ohm token to never sell and to keep doubling down, tripling down on Olympus Dow. And this is very common in a lot of these D five 2.0
00:21:44.106 - 00:22:04.900, Speaker A: names. Is that in D five 1.0? If you're in Makerdao and Makerdow is not working, nobody's like, you must hold maker. If you don't, you're a bad person and you don't understand the vision of Makerdao. They're just like, look, I mean, do what you're going to do, but the system is going to be secure. Whereas with D five 2.0, it's very like, no, you're a bad person, and we're going to yell at you on Twitter if you sell.
00:22:04.900 - 00:22:32.138, Speaker A: So that's Olympus Dow. Now, the second protocol, it's interesting because it's a very similar family of protocols as Olympusdao. Abracadabra, which its native token, or the governance token is spell. The stablecoin is mim, M-I-M. And basically, what is Abercadabra? The easiest way to understand abracadabra is it's just Makerdao, but with riskier collateral. So Makerdao has a very laborious process for onboarding more collateral. Right.
00:22:32.138 - 00:23:25.790, Speaker A: If you want to get something included in Makerdao, you got to go through giant forum arguments and people do risk modeling and all this stuff, and there's like very low ceilings on how much you can actually mint when you're onboarding new collateral. And Abracadabra was like, hey, you know, all those weird levered tokens that you have, you want to get levered on them, come to our shop, we'll let you borrow against all of it. And so they basically take a bunch of levered collateral, which is already in other protocols, like yield generating collateral in other protocols, and they let you borrow against it, which is just leverage. It's just going farther down the risk curve. And so, in a way, again, this is very normal in many markets, is that as the market matures, you see more and more businesses getting built farther down the risk curve, taking on more risk, and that's effectively what Abracadabra is. So last thing is fracs, I don't have a bunch of time, so I'll run through this pretty quickly. Frax is a partially collateralized, partially algorithmic stablecoin.
00:23:25.790 - 00:23:51.078, Speaker A: I'm not going to belabor the way that it works. I wrote a blog post about Frax that you can look up if you're very interested. But the thing about fracs that's very d five 2.0 is that fracs, unlike most of the stablecoins, fracs can mint unbacked fracs like a central bank. A central bank. Like, if you're the Fed, you do not look into your reserves and say, hey, do I have enough money to print USD? No, you just print USD because you're like, look, I have stuff to do. I'm going to go do it.
00:23:51.078 - 00:24:15.054, Speaker A: And so fracs is the same thing. It's more like what we think of as a traditional central bank. It mints unbacked fracs to go pursue attractive market opportunities. If it says, like, hey, you know what? I'm going to go mint a bunch of fracs and put it into compound so I can earn a yield on it. Makerdao doesn't do that, right? Makerdo doesn't mint unbacked Dai and say, hey, I see there's a lot of great yield farming opportunities in Dai, I'm going to go make it myself as a central bank. Dai doesn't do that. Makerdao doesn't do that.
00:24:15.054 - 00:24:35.780, Speaker A: But fracs, again, moving farther up the risk curve, being more aggressive, much more, much more activist in the way that it uses its protocol. Treasury dows are also evolving alongside all this D five 2.0 stuff. So you're seeing the DFI 1.0 dows are very, very old. They're maybe arguably more sclerotic. They don't move as quickly.
00:24:35.780 - 00:24:56.214, Speaker A: I have written here, somewhat, somewhat optimistically, that protocols are becoming more decentralized. It's kind of less true, actually. A lot of these protocols are not as decentralized as the DFI 1.0 stuff, but the D five 1.0 stuff is made with a different design philosophy. Right? DFI 1.0 is like, look, we build this stuff and it's going to stick around forever and it's never going to change unless we need to do small little changes at the margin.
00:24:56.214 - 00:25:17.746, Speaker A: Whereas D five 2.0, almost everything is iterating very quickly, and as a result, things are moving faster. There's more multi sigs than there are kind of decentralized whatevers. And there's also a lot more treasury management and oversight that is more complex because these protocols do so many more things. There's more to govern in these protocols, which makes them more complex. And the team structures are becoming also more complex. Right.
00:25:17.746 - 00:25:44.854, Speaker A: So you guys may have seen this big sushi drama where Arca suggested basically like an whole chart defined by the Dow for sushi. And this kind of stuff is going to become more and more necessary because of all the complexity for most of these D five 2.0 protocols. So what's next? I think you're going to see more and more. Again, I didn't have a time. Talk about convex, which is very deeply intertwined with curve. Also, Frax is very deeply intertwined with convex and with curve.
00:25:44.854 - 00:26:13.534, Speaker A: There are all these interconnections tribe very similarly. There are a lot of interconnections between these protocols. And I think you're going to see more and more of this kind of money Lego concept finding its way into more and more DFI 2.0 sort of remixed protocols. Without D five 1.0, we wouldn't have bonding, we wouldn't have liquidity mining, we wouldn't have a lot of these foundational primitives, but they're going to get built on. And just like finance becomes more and more complex over time, we've seen the same thing happening in DeFi, except on speedrun speed.
00:26:13.534 - 00:26:40.030, Speaker A: Compared to what we saw in traditional finance. There are a bunch more projects I didn't have time to talk about. Things like ribbon finance, gelato, tracerdao, Popsicle, Visor, dopex, inverse finance. So do your own research. Also, I should be clear, none of this investment advice, I'm not necessarily saying any of these things are good investments, but if you want to understand where DeFi is going, it's very important to get a sense of how this space is evolving and what people are working on. So how much time do I have left? Do I have time for questions. No, I have no time for questions.
00:26:40.030 - 00:26:47.340, Speaker A: Thank you for your zero questions. I hope that was helpful. Wow. Give it up for Haseeb. That was a lot. Thank you so much.
