00:00:00.330 - 00:00:10.974, Speaker A: Hi, everyone. My name is Sean Chang. It's great to see a lot of familiar faces out in the crowd. And hello to the 25,000 people tuning in on twitch right now.
00:00:11.092 - 00:00:11.562, Speaker B: Whoa.
00:00:11.626 - 00:00:27.270, Speaker A: I'm just kidding. All right, just loosening up the crowd. All right, just loosening up. But thanks so much for coming in. I was so excited to host a panel about new dial frontiers and pick.
00:00:27.340 - 00:00:30.646, Speaker C: People that had been here for the.
00:00:30.668 - 00:01:50.190, Speaker A: Last bull eaten shit and then have still stuck around. So that's the common denominator amongst all three folks on stage right now. And each of them comes at the problem of what dows could possibly become from three very different places. Just to set the table, if you were to think about dow taxonomy, there's lots of ways to cut it, but one of my favorite is to think about a, investment dows, b, both protocol product based dows and C, social based dows, which I think even though all three representatives from their collectives represent one of those things, they also kind of overlap with all three of those things. And so as we kind of go into a very short conversation amongst three veterans, we're going to ask some quick conversation, and hopefully, my hope is that this is as spicy as possible. Just kidding. I hope that there are strong opinions loosely held and that we don't all agree because a lot of panels are boring and everybody agrees.
00:01:51.490 - 00:01:52.240, Speaker B: Right.
00:01:53.350 - 00:02:26.358, Speaker A: So kicking things off, I want to start with Kia from Gnosis Guild. And gnosis, if you've been sleeping under a rock, has been part of the bedrock of what dows are all about. Safe now secures $100 billion of assets. And from there, they've taken the lessons from our friends at Synthetix and a number of other major protocols to actually decentralize itself. So, Justin, very briefly, Kia, do you mind just sharing a little bit about what's going on with gnosis?
00:02:26.534 - 00:02:55.140, Speaker D: Sure. So I've been at gnosis for the last almost four and a half years, and recently our different product lines have kind of reached escape philosophy and autonomy. And we've taken the opportunity to also establish a new product line of dow tools called the Zodiac Dow tools. And a lot of this thinking around how we approach it was born from our own need, but also observing needs in the ecosystem. So it's an open standard, composable tools for daos that can evolve and basically looking at different needs across the board.
00:02:55.830 - 00:03:36.914, Speaker A: So check them out. Definitely Gnosis Guild is powering some of the largest and best dows out there, such as yearn, as well as safe cowswap. Gnosis chain, if you haven't checked that out and had a couple hundred projects already, commit to the next chapter of what XDI was all about. And also Assange Dow. So just thinking a little bit about Juicebox and what the future might look like for crowdfunding. Speaking of Juicebox, I'm actually going to go over to Aaron to talk a little bit about investment dows. So tribute Labs has been around for quite some time, empowering some of the largest and best investment dows out there.
00:03:36.914 - 00:04:05.494, Speaker A: Total Aum is now $175,000,000 and they've reached ten of the best communities out there. From that, they now are continuing to expand, and I think they probably have three or four more on deck. But Aaron, just to speak a little bit about the future of what tribute and tribute's all about, would love to hear what you think about investment dows, I guess in the near term specifically.
00:04:05.542 - 00:04:32.254, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. And thanks so much, Sean, for pulling this together. It's great to be on the panel with both of you. It was actually first time I met James was before all this started right at the last e. Denver was right when the first investment dows were being launched. There was a couple of panels talking about it, and we were like, whoa, we need to say something big and splashy. By the end of 2020, there's going to be $100 billion in all dows.
00:04:32.254 - 00:05:16.698, Speaker B: And we were like, whoa, that's crazy. We should definitely do that. And obviously, the entire ecosystem has grown leaps and bounds ahead of it due to the great work of gnosis and what James, I'm sure, is going to unpack. And obviously the stuff that we're doing as well, there's different flavors of daos because they're different ways for people to work together. The Daos that we help pull together, I believe, really are the future in the way people invest. Our daos, which include the Lao, which supports projects flamingo dao, which is focused on collecting nfts red, which is focused on digital fashion noise, which is focused on music ready player Dao, which is focused on play to earn opportunities. And there's a bunch of others, including neon, which is focused in the metaverse.
00:05:16.698 - 00:06:12.014, Speaker B: They're just showing that people don't need to be in Silicon Valley, they don't need to be in New York, they don't need to be in London. They can get together from around the globe. They can begin to work together to spot opportunities and make investments and actually perform as well, if not better than these traditional legacy institutions. So they're really serving as a check on Silicon Valley hedge fund industry, and I think ultimately Hollywood as well, just in terms of being able to pool capital, deploy it more efficiently, and generate a superior return. So I think it's pretty exciting. It kind of reminds me, at least, of how we saw hedge funds and venture capital funds emerge in the 1970s in the US, and that changed the way capital is deployed, that changed the way elites in the US, how society was structured. We're beginning to see that same trend, and I think that's going to increasingly point towards dows and in particular investment dows.
00:06:12.014 - 00:06:14.820, Speaker B: Thanks for cleaning the background noise on that, too.
00:06:15.290 - 00:07:04.130, Speaker A: So investment dows, I mean, the future involves maybe all of us and not necessarily just coastal elites. Pretty cool. Switching gears over to James Young from collab land, which helps to power a lot of the largest social dows out there. So right now, I think the last stat that I had heard was that there's 50 people a second that is now using collab land. So if you've used a token dated discord, and there's basically, I think, millions of people that are discovering web3 through a lot of these discord communities. James, I guess one of the things that came out in our prep talk would love for you to share a little bit about collab, but also share a little bit about how you think that's going to evolve, especially in the near term.
00:07:05.030 - 00:07:18.378, Speaker C: Yeah, I appreciate it. Just as Aaron was mentioning in 2020 at the beginning of it, and we met at East Denver, East Denver looked very different than it does now.
00:07:18.464 - 00:07:18.762, Speaker B: Right.
00:07:18.816 - 00:08:15.942, Speaker C: I think it's like, whether it's this macroeconomic or the kind of backdrop of the pandemic, you see this, a lot of people entering the space. And I think that when we started collabland, we didn't know what we were actually unleashing. And I think part of it was because of this first it was Defi summer, and then it was like, NFTs, and it just kind of once it left the gate, there's no going back. And so for us at collabland and what we're sitting on now, we're like, okay, well, what are we going to do? And so last night, I announced that we're going to decentralize. So we're trying to figure that out. It's going to be a dao. It was actually three years ago this week that helped launch Malik Dao, which kind of reset this interest in daos and been operating in daos.
00:08:15.942 - 00:09:02.138, Speaker C: And so it's going to be really interesting because we don't have all the answers, we're all trying to figure it out as we go along. There's different types of dows, like investment dows and these NFT kind of social clubs, if you will. And I think there's going to be a lot of interesting byproducts of not just owning an asset and being able to be token gated, but also what that asset unlocks on these different platforms. And my understanding of how web two and web3 can interoperate has changed a lot through just witnessing this kind of explosion that's happened with collab land.
00:09:02.304 - 00:10:16.878, Speaker A: Thanks for that. So being three optimists that weathered the storm through crypto winter saw 80% to 90% drawdowns. Being probably eternal optimists, I actually want to ask the question of something negative, actually in a negative case, in a bear case, given all of these frameworks, all of the exuberance, because we're in a bull right now, what happens within all of these Dow frameworks? In the worst sense, because we've spent a lot of time thinking about the bull case. But coming from each of your perspectives and studying their history, where could these things lead us that could not be an intended consequence? And I want to call out Kia's post from July of 2021. If you haven't read it, it's definitely going to be in the crypto canon. It's the prehist history of dows, and it's probably maybe a 20 minutes read, but it'll probably take you about 20 hours to chew on each of the concepts. But Kia, what do you think in terms of where we're headed and in the short term, where there's lots of activity? Each of you have either pooled millions of dollars or millions of users.
00:10:16.878 - 00:10:24.580, Speaker A: What is something that we need to watch out for, especially as people that have been here for a very long time building this?
00:10:25.210 - 00:11:09.746, Speaker D: Sure. So I think there's a lot of ethical frontiers that we haven't even begun to face in the Dow ecosystem and what permissionlessness really means online. I think maybe to be a little bit more subtle. There's a whole realm of things there, but a little bit more subtle. One thing I'm worried about at the moment is that dows can be fully kind of legible and integrated with our existing financial and organizational system without any friction whatsoever. If we continue focusing on the kind of traditional firm and at maximumizing the goals of a traditional firm, I feel like we haven't actually produced a different type of medium of organization. Like what does return look like for a Dow? We don't exactly know that yet.
00:11:09.746 - 00:11:28.620, Speaker D: And if it can be fully kind of encapsulated with existing economic structures, I worry that that sort of capture is both ripe on the ethical side for disturbance, but also on the just. It's a passing fad, and it just maximizes the capacities that we already have.
00:11:29.710 - 00:12:06.114, Speaker A: So gnosis Guild, I mean, is the leading, I guess, steward of the zodiac protocol, which is built to be modular, which a lot of other Dow frameworks are not necessarily modular. They are built for a specific purpose. And we've seen historically ones whereby, which there's too much measurement or there's analysis paralysis, or they're trying to put too many things on chain. Why do you think a more modular approach would lead to something a little bit more collaborative and hopefully avoid some of the things that you just mentioned?
00:12:06.312 - 00:13:03.670, Speaker D: Sure. So I think that the most resilient infrastructure is infrastructure that can evolve over time to some degree, where you have a baseline. This is actually quite contrarian in terms of, if you look at protocol governance, that should change very slowly. But looking at the needs for doing gnosis, Dao and other daos in the ecosystem, we realized there was a huge issue that you started a daO, and you are basically locked into one platform, one voting type, one membership structure, and if you wanted to change, you often had to change platforms. So the approach with zodiac built around Nosa safe, but it's ultimately framework agnostic, is that you can essentially have, like, a core contract that establishes the DAO and then build up different modules over time. So different voting mechanisms, different membership structures, different access to different layers of the treasury, different actual kind of like, discord roles for safes, so that basically you can start and evolve over time, and you can really have a DAO that feels much more like a kind of living organism than a traditional static kind of membership share structure.
00:13:04.010 - 00:13:04.470, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:13:04.540 - 00:14:05.338, Speaker A: And, Aaron, I guess, to switch gears over to you in thinking about all daos should be judged by their outcomes. So we might be talking a lot about, on chain or off chain, whether or not it should be majority rules. Majority minus one, someone dissenting, a snapshot. We're all somewhat in a shell shock. And one of the things that I love about the tribute down network is that the members right now, I think if you were to poll them, on average, are extremely satisfied with the outcomes of the decisions, which is much, much more flexible than being highly explicit, having all of this documentation, and then onboarding people in a way that's through kind of like one path. The question of, I guess, is there any negative outcome from that, or are there only positive ones by being, I guess, a little bit more fluid with how you approach onboarding people into the system?
00:14:05.424 - 00:14:30.706, Speaker B: Yeah. So there's lots of conversation just around dows and decision making governance. I think they're largely informed by the early experiments with protocol level dows or defi dows, which are a very distinct use case, and frankly don't do that much together. Yet. Many of them are quorum based. The deliberative process is very slow. It's much more like an EIP type process than what people want to do.
00:14:30.706 - 00:14:56.506, Speaker B: If it's a social community or an investment dow there, the cadence needs to be a lot faster. So our dows are flat. There's nobody that's in control. There's no manager. People are making decisions in a very collaborative way. And by working with not just a handful of people, but a larger group of people, you begin to create what appears to be like a hive mind. You begin to see little germs of ideas that bounce off other people.
00:14:56.506 - 00:15:31.880, Speaker B: It generates some energy, and then people move to take action together. So in an example with Flamingo, people got very excited about crypto punks very early. So this is way back in October of last year. They were super excited about it. You felt the energy that was moving around the project. They decided that they wanted to allocate to go purchase those assets, and then they purchased a tremendous amount of them, like 215 or so off the bat. And they were able to do that because they could tell just from the conversation that this is what everybody was interested in, not just what one person was.
00:15:31.880 - 00:16:17.454, Speaker B: And that, I think, enables people to act together, hear different viewpoints, and make better decisions and broader decisions related to it. And I think that those decision making processes are proving to be better than expert driven models. I can only speak for myself, but I feel like my entire life has been classified by failures of experts, whether that's experts that were running corporations or the government or other parts of society. And daos, to me, really present a new way to begin to explore how we can make better decisions. And we're beginning to see that really emerge in the investment Dao and I think social club models, as opposed to the defi dows, which I think are on their own island. And that's really exciting. So I am an eternal optimist.
00:16:17.454 - 00:16:59.570, Speaker B: I don't actually think that there's any downsides to Daos. I actually think what we're witnessing is the birth of the first Internet native organization. We've seen this at every major epic of history, whether that's the industrial era, whether that's the modern global era that we're just ending, basically the end of the boomer era. And now we're in the Internet era. And the Internet era is going to be defined by people working together in these structures. We don't have all the answers, as I'm sure James indicated before, but I think we're seeing that this is the platform to figure it out. And by having these more open, permissionless organizations, we now have the toolkits to begin to do that.
00:16:59.570 - 00:17:21.834, Speaker B: So whether it's using something like Zodiac, we also have a DAO framework that's less opinionated than some of the earlier ones called attributed Dow framework. We can begin to build more organic organizations, figure out what governance works for it, make better decisions, and then the Internet can actually have a real world impact in so many different ways. So no downsides for me. So that's going to be my spicy takes.
00:17:21.872 - 00:17:23.786, Speaker C: John, hot take.
00:17:23.968 - 00:18:00.950, Speaker A: So I think we all know that web two companies are already extremely hard to build, but I think everybody else would also agree on this panel that building a web3 company is probably ten x harder. And so, James, switching gears to you, choosing to decentralize your company at this specific point in time, what does it mean and why? Now? When you yourself are a three time founder, you've seen what can be done, and you know what to do next in the preexisting blueprint. So why make your life complicated?
00:18:02.490 - 00:18:46.286, Speaker C: The way I think about it is that the clay is still wet. We have this opportunity instead of repeating old models on new rails. Maybe there is a different way. Maybe there's a way where in web3, and I think all of us agree, we don't want to create the Facebook of crypto, that ownership of your data belongs to you as a user. And not only that, and what I'm excited about is what actions get unlocked based off of the assets that you own. So we're looking heavily into verifiable credentials. The example is I have a board ape, and I might have bought into it late with a verifiable credential.
00:18:46.286 - 00:19:20.110, Speaker C: Actually, I could show and prove that I was in early, I had these roles in discord, so that now when I go to a new project, not only do I, maybe I've sold my ape, but I have these verifiable credentials that show that I was early on in the team building process. And that resume building, that reputation building, I think, is the data exhaust that comes out of asset ownership. And that should be owned by the user. The user should have control of that. And this is what we're really excited about to go back to this kind of spicy take in terms of like.
00:19:20.180 - 00:19:22.394, Speaker B: Spicy, jane, let's get spicy.
00:19:22.442 - 00:20:46.874, Speaker C: Let's get spicy. So I think in, I guess this PTSD from previous cycles, just always thinking like, when's the other shoe going to drop? I think of the scenarios of like, you have these huge dows that are like zombie dows, right? And then just assets are locked up, people have voter apathy, all that stuff. And so from that, I wonder from a thought experiment, what if you had a bunch of dows, they're all networked together, they're composable, right? Because you need not only money legos, but what you're unlocking is composable communities. Communities change and they all evolve. And so what I was thinking of, instead of having the largest dow possible, what if you contained it to a small group and you contained the time limit in which that Dow could exist, right. That gives us like, let's say, okay, in six months, if you don't spend this money, it gets burned, like extreme case, right? So then what you have is groups forming networks of dows, trying to collaborate. And what will end up happening, I think, is that the high performers, if there's a time limit in a dow, will want to congregate and kind of like, there will be a shelling point of people that actually have been productive in other dows to continue to work together.
00:20:46.874 - 00:20:51.970, Speaker C: And I think that melds well with what we're doing with verifiable credentials.
00:20:52.070 - 00:21:07.840, Speaker A: I love that. So we've got only three or four minutes left. We're going to do a quick lightning round. You have to predict something that is non consensus. What do you think is going to happen that most people do not believe?
00:21:11.860 - 00:21:13.488, Speaker B: Should you make some bold predictions?
00:21:13.584 - 00:21:16.004, Speaker A: Yeah, it can be multiple, too.
00:21:16.202 - 00:21:27.816, Speaker B: Well, I mean, I think one broad prediction, I do think the next twelve to 18 months, it's primarily just going to be entirely focused on nfts and dows. I think the headwinds with DFI are really strong.
00:21:27.918 - 00:21:28.804, Speaker A: DFI is dead.
00:21:28.852 - 00:21:59.408, Speaker B: I think DFI is dead. And I'm going to sit on it. I think it's largely dead. And I think we're going to see the next twelve to 18 months be almost entirely about nfts and dows. I think nfts are much broader than people are giving them credit for. I think they've simplified the mechanics down to such a degree that it's palatable for mainstream audiences, it's understandable. There's not layers of ponzenomics that are baked in that hurt projects so they can build sustainable ecosystems.
00:21:59.408 - 00:22:41.024, Speaker B: And I think dows will continue to grow and will in 1020 years be a dominant form of organization. And then the full vision of what dows will be will not just be organizations focused on making investments or online communities, but broader nation building or quasination building like organs. So this is a big category. Crypto right now is in an inflection point. I think there's lots of folks that are focused on the first six years of crypto, which is very focused on financials. I think the next 20 years of crypto are going to be focused on culture. They're going to be focused on nfts, and I think they're going to be focused on trading ideas, memes, art, culture, you name it.
00:22:41.024 - 00:22:52.080, Speaker B: And that is the endpoint for crypto. There's very few headwinds, number one, and people love it, and that's most important. So don't get stuck in DFI.
00:22:52.240 - 00:22:53.076, Speaker A: Hot takes.
00:22:53.178 - 00:22:54.596, Speaker C: Hot takes. You all.
00:22:54.778 - 00:22:59.430, Speaker A: All right, non consensus predictions over the next six to twelve months.
00:23:00.280 - 00:23:26.976, Speaker D: I have one that's more negative than I would like to be because continuing working in the space, I am quite optimistic, and I really do believe in working for more long term aims. But one, as I offer more as a challenge, is that dows could go very, extremely mainstream, become as common as the typical firm, and not change anything. And I would like to challenge that that doesn't happen.
00:23:27.158 - 00:23:42.852, Speaker A: Whoa, I got dark quick. Your efforts will accomplish. That's a spicy take, James. Sorry.
00:23:42.906 - 00:24:02.856, Speaker B: I just want to, I agree with it, though. Like the dictator Daos and these hierarchical, really, they really just don't excite me. If you want to do that, just go start a startup or a corporation. Try something new, flatter, newer governance, whether that's quadratic or there's plenty of new models that people want to experiment with. Just try it out. Do something different.
00:24:02.958 - 00:24:11.756, Speaker D: Yeah. And just quickly to say, I think what both of you are doing really contributes to Daos being different. And I would really like us to challenge that imaginary so that that doesn't happen.
00:24:11.938 - 00:24:16.800, Speaker A: Keep agreeing. This is not the syllabus. Sorry, James.
00:24:17.300 - 00:25:05.388, Speaker C: Yeah. One of the things that kind of led me down, this rethinking of dows and then having these smaller dows, is that I think with this emergent design was talking about, we don't want this hierarchical, top down organization. I think that daos actually allow for scaling leadership so you can join a dow, work hard at it, be the shining star, and not have these traditional social constructs. And this is where I say the clay is still wet. Right. There's going to be a cultural or a social norming that's going to be happening. And I think this is what we can all affect.
00:25:05.388 - 00:25:27.320, Speaker C: And I think that on chain voting, on chain transactions, you'll be able to see who's performing. And I think on top of that, again, I'm going to pitch verifiable credentials as another data layer on top of that, that people are going to be able to reason about people's performance. So I think dows are going to be about where the next leaders are going to come from.
00:25:27.430 - 00:25:29.252, Speaker A: Thank you so much, distinguished panelists.
00:25:29.316 - 00:25:29.860, Speaker B: Thanks, Sean.
00:25:29.940 - 00:25:30.680, Speaker A: Appreciate it.
00:25:30.750 - 00:25:31.110, Speaker C: Thank you, everybody.
