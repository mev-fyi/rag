00:00:00.250 - 00:00:13.230, Speaker A: Today. Michelle, you are a seasoned DC veteran. You've worked for a few different agencies. I'm curious who you think the US crypto cops are and what types of concerns they have for the crypto ecosystem.
00:00:14.050 - 00:01:28.360, Speaker B: Yeah, there's a real Alphabet soup of agencies that are interested in the ecosystem. If we look at the regulators, I'm sure all of you have read about the SEC and the FTC and kind of duking it out for jurisdiction relating to different matters and also bringing enforcement cases with their regulatory authorities. But you've also got treasury, their Office of Foreign Asset Control, or OFAC and FinCEN, who supervises financial institutions, including some crypto companies, for anti money laundering and financial crime regulation. And so you've got a lot of regulators with their hands in the pot. I will leave it to Caitlin to talk a little bit more about also the Federal Reserve and the banking agencies who have late have been putting their hands into things, I guess is the way I'll put it. And one important thing to think about is that we use the words cops. You also do have the law enforcement agencies and the prosecutors who are looking at the system, but they're not really looking at the system for purposes of trying to strangle the technology.
00:01:28.360 - 00:02:19.666, Speaker B: They're looking at it from the perspective of where is illicit finance happening? If it's at a crypto company or being done with crypto, then their attention is going to turn in that direction. But generally, they are enforcing the criminal violations on the books. The things that they know, I think both the regulators and law enforcement are focused on is lift finance, specifically terrorist financing, anything to do with sanctions evasion, particularly anything that would facilitate North Korea being able to get their hands on funds for purposes of their missiles programs. And then with the market regulators, obviously, they're very interested, particularly in the aftermath of FTX, in consumer protection, protection against fraud, and fair playing field with the markets.
00:02:19.778 - 00:02:42.720, Speaker A: That makes sense. Caitlin, as someone at a bank, you probably interact with regulators almost more than anyone else in the crypto ecosystem. So I'm curious what you think their mindset is as they approach crypto. Are they familiar with it? Are there a lot of questions you have to answer for them? Do you think that they're really focused on CFI, or is there kind of a more, I don't know, mix of defi in there as well?
00:02:43.090 - 00:03:51.810, Speaker C: Well, the regulators are definitely more focused on CFI, and if you look at the actions that were taken in the SEC realm, they went hardest against Coinbase, and in the banking realm, they went hardest against us. Well, it's because we were the easiest to get in some ways, right, because I think both Coinbase in the SEC realm and us in the banking realm were really almost begging tell us how to get regulated. And we were the most proximate and we got skewered the hardest by the aggressive enforcement. But I think they are watching. Defi, you asked the question, do they know the technology? Certain ones do. This is where the arrogance of the Washington regulators is absolutely misplaced, because the state regulators, in my opinion, in my experience, have more understanding of this than the federal regulators. When you have a federal regulator who doesn't even know what an API is, making decisions about this technology, there's a chasm of a knowledge gap.
00:03:51.970 - 00:03:56.726, Speaker A: What's been most frustrating, in your opinion? I don't know if there have been any roadblocks that you've come across.
00:03:56.828 - 00:04:34.226, Speaker C: Oh, the most frustrating by far is the politicization of it and the unwillingness to follow the law, which is ultimately why this industry keeps winning in court. Because the regulators have gone so far outside the boundary of the letter of the law, and that is why the courts are striking them down. But it is unfortunate that we do have to go to court. And for those of you who are not familiar with what the state of Wyoming did, the state of Wyoming met with the Fed more than a hundred times to work on this charter. Get ready for the applicants coming. Kraken was the first to get a charter in Wyoming. There are four of us.
00:04:34.226 - 00:05:00.422, Speaker C: It has stopped since. Obviously they denied us and we're now waiting for the answer in the lawsuit. But this was not done in a vacuum. It's not like Wyoming tried to do something without fed knowledge. And not just knowledge, participation. The Fed marked up the charter statute when it was in the draft form. It marked up the rules and regulations.
00:05:00.422 - 00:05:46.058, Speaker C: It marked up the supervisory exam manual. And then when the four of us applied, all of a sudden it was a massive rug pull. And that came from the political side. That's the thing that's been the most frustrating, is how the folks on the ground, in many cases were very excited about this because it was something new and different and exciting. And here you had somebody who was actually trying to get regulated and trying to work with the regulators, and then it was the DC folks who came over the top and pulled the rug on the state. The state filed an amicus brief talking about overwhelming bias and animus. That was very strong language because the state got screwed as much as the individual applicants did as well.
00:05:46.144 - 00:06:05.530, Speaker A: Yeah. So I'm hearing politics was definitely a big part of what was frustrating. And, Rashawn, I know we've talked about education already, but I'm curious what you think the regulators are viewing on chain finance. What are the different flavors that they're interpreting it as? And also, what's the biggest misunderstanding they have about on chain finance?
00:06:05.690 - 00:06:38.858, Speaker D: Yeah. Well, I think on chain finance is a very broad term that encompasses a lot of different things. Right. I think at a high level, the movement and tracking of value across a blockchain is going to be on chain finance. Right. So that means there are tokens moving across these layers, so that can be native digital tokens, bitcoin, eth, et cetera. That can be stable coins meant to track a specific fiat currency or the value of something else.
00:06:38.858 - 00:07:38.302, Speaker D: And there's now increasingly real world assets also on chain. Right. So on chain finance can encompass all of these different things. If I'm having a conversation about on chain finance, it probably means defi, right? Defi also has several different flavors, if you will. So from decentralized exchanges like DyDX or Uniswap to lending protocols, maker Ave, et cetera, and then also gaming insurance, wherever there's financial services, those can also be on chain now, right, using these protocols to communicate. So what I think the regulators misunderstand, it's actually hard to tell in some cases, seems like they understand very, very well what on chain finance is, and it's hard to kind of figure out what their motives might be. So in thinking about ahead of this panel, I had dinner with a regulator last night, and I asked her this question.
00:07:38.302 - 00:08:31.278, Speaker D: I said, what do people seem to misunderstand about on chain finance? What's going on? What's the disconnect? And it really seems to come down to a lack of understanding or clarity of the idea that builders working in Defi and across crypto are really trying to create products that serve people well. Just like in any other entrepreneurial space in Defi, builders are trying to make something that is faster, cheaper, more secure, just better for users. Obviously, it's a process to get there. So we actually have come to fruition the things that we're dreaming of, but that is what people are doing. And so it seems like there is an inherent cynicism in some people's minds whether that is possible or whether that's what people are really trying to do. But there's some sort of disconnect there that makes sense.
00:08:31.364 - 00:08:46.318, Speaker A: And even though there are misunderstandings or to your point, they understand some but don't get the full picture. I'm curious how, as at a project, you guys are adjusting to what the regulators are doing since they're moving forward anyways with some of these regulatory proposals.
00:08:46.494 - 00:09:17.310, Speaker D: Yeah, honestly, we are not structuring our thing to evade the law, which I think is also a misconception. It's like, okay, if they're using crypto and there's all these other ways to move ones and zeros across the Internet, then they must be doing it to evade the law. And that's not the case. I think that, say, DyDX, our product, isn't available to us customers. Right. But that's not because of crypto necessarily. It's because of the specific type of derivative product that we offer.
00:09:17.310 - 00:09:40.630, Speaker D: There isn't a regulatory pathway to offer it at the moment, but because there is this extremely toxic environment, we have to spend a lot of time and resources in making sure that we do everything we possibly can to ensure that a technology doesn't get into hands of us users, because that could be a death sentence.
00:09:40.970 - 00:09:52.220, Speaker A: And Michelle, you have a lot of portfolio companies. I'm curious about the kinds of conversations you're having with them about what regulation means, and maybe if they need to make adjustments, like where those adjustments are.
00:09:53.070 - 00:11:31.366, Speaker B: Yeah, I really try to get involved and talk to the portfolio companies early on, before launch, while they're still developing their products, so that they can think about how they want to build the business in order to figure out what their cost benefit analysis is going to be based on any regulatory requirements that there may be. So what I would say to early builders, at least you need to think about budgeting for legal expenses earlier than maybe you would have had to in the past, because there is so much regulatory activity, so that you can get good guidance. I know a lot of you may have all of your budget employing builders, which is exactly what you should be doing, and your go to market people, and maybe not have inside counsel, but there are lots of experts out there serving as outside counsel that can help you kind of make decisions about how you want to develop the product. And if you're already up and going and say, want to pivot what you're doing, or you want to say, hey, we hadn't really thought about what's happening in the regulatory space. What can we do? Can we engage with the regulator, or do we need to build a compliance program that does XYZ? Or, gosh, I hadn't really thought about north korean sanctions. Like, maybe I don't need a compliance department because I'm not a financial institution. But maybe I need to go talk to the blockchain analytics companies who can do screening for sanctioned addresses, et cetera.
00:11:31.366 - 00:11:52.800, Speaker B: So I think there's a lot proactively that companies can be doing, and that's what I talk to them about. And as you mentioned, thankfully, I don't think it's hair on fire. Somebody's knocking and it's a problem most of the time. It's really just adding that as a part of your business process and your thought process as you're building.
00:11:53.330 - 00:12:11.510, Speaker A: From what all three of you have said so far, it seems like a lot of what's happening is on the regulator level, but not necessarily what's happening with Congress. So I'm curious for each of your takes, about what the role of Congress is in providing clarity or what kinds of questions need to be answered in order to help on chain finance thrive?
00:12:12.330 - 00:13:04.518, Speaker D: Well, I think that's really how I spend a lot of my time because obviously the regulators do have theoretically a set of guidelines that they need to follow. And so it seems that in some cases where we're dealing with new technological paradigms and new types of products, there really does need to be additional law. So we do need Congress to act. I'd argue that we're kind of already in arrears. They should have acted in the past, but we are where we are now. And so I think that it's critical that people like us and people like the folks here are spending time educating legislators, talking to policymakers, because Congress has a real role to play. There are real questions at stake here, and the only way we can really answer them is kind of by looking proactively forward.
00:13:04.684 - 00:13:38.338, Speaker C: It's interesting because the stablecoin bill is winding its way through. Who knows if it will actually come through or not. But it's coming closer than anything that we've seen so far coming out of Congress, and it apparently is going to be up or down March 22. So it'll either happen or not. And I saw an interesting thing. Jay Powell commented on it, and it got picked up in Politico that it's very close. So if Jay Powell's saying something like that, you should assume it's true.
00:13:38.338 - 00:14:48.280, Speaker C: That's consistent with what we've heard. But Richie Torres from the Bronx had a very interesting comment that said, I don't understand, I'm paraphrasing here, I don't understand why Congress defers to the federal agencies so much and we're the ones in charge of writing legislation. Why is it that we're deferring to the federal agencies so much. And that speaks volumes about the problem, in my humble opinion, because the complexity of regulation is so high and the number of gotchas, especially in banking, but in financial services broadly, that the regulators can come after you with, is so great that Congress can't possibly keep track of all of those things. And so what has happened is that the minnow swallowed the whale, right? Congress is supposed to be writing the laws, but the agencies have ratcheted up the complexity so much that the agencies are the only ones who know how the puzzle pieces fit together, and they're the ones de facto writing the laws. It's upside down. And I'm so glad that Richie Torres said that because it's right.
00:14:48.650 - 00:15:06.974, Speaker A: So for those of you who don't know Richie Torres, he's a democratic member of Congress out of New York, and he's quite young. So, Michelle, I'm just curious if you think there's like a generational divide in Congress in terms of understanding or a partisan one, in terms of how they're viewing crypto and their willingness to engage with the industry and these issues.
00:15:07.172 - 00:16:33.820, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that there are some very powerful and outspoken folks in Congress that really perhaps do not see the practical use cases and the breadth of what this technology can do and have a one track mind about how they think things should go. And so what I would encourage all of you to do is to really engage with, whether it's congresspeople or senators in your district, even the local legislators, you need to speak with your feet, with your pocketbooks, and they need examples of what you're building. Like, they want to hear about the people that you're employing in their districts, what you're building, because it's so diverse and there are all sorts of interesting things that they can't even comprehend. They're just looking at exchanges and transfer of value and, oh, scary, North Korea, and don't realize that the vast majority of what's being built out there on blockchains has nothing to do with that and is interesting and important for America to stay ahead, both economically and from a national security perspective. And telling your story to them and voting based on these opinions that people are taking in Congress is really important right now.
00:16:34.190 - 00:16:45.438, Speaker A: So it sounds like all three of you agree that we need legislation. I'm curious what you think has stopped it to date. Like, what have been the roadblocks along the way that have really prevented us from making any progress there.
00:16:45.524 - 00:16:46.910, Speaker C: Elizabeth Warren.
00:16:48.210 - 00:16:49.790, Speaker B: Elizabeth Warren.
00:16:51.570 - 00:16:52.720, Speaker D: Many people.
00:16:54.210 - 00:17:10.966, Speaker B: But if you look at, I mean, look at Congress in general and all the other things that have nothing to do with crypto and blockchain, they can't pass. You know, it's not surprising. I don't think, that it's specific, unfortunately, to crypto, at least here in the US.
00:17:11.148 - 00:17:16.790, Speaker A: Why do you think they can't pass anything? What do you think is the cause behind that? Is it the divided Congress?
00:17:17.130 - 00:17:43.200, Speaker C: Yeah, it's a divided Congress. The process is broken. It literally is. The old absolute power corrupts absolutely. One of the observations is that the chair, so the president of the Senate and the speaker of the House, who controls the agenda, has set it up so that they control pretty much everything. Okay. So if you don't have, for example, in the Senate, Schumer on board, nothing happens.
00:17:43.200 - 00:18:16.666, Speaker C: It didn't used to be that way. So in some ways, it's a microcosm of the decentralization problem that we're all trying to solve. Way too much power in centralized entities. The same things happened in Congress. And that part, unfortunately, I don't know how to fix, because what politician will ever give up power once they've attained it? It's a rare, what George Washington did in saying, look, somebody else has to take this on. This is not about me. After being the first president of the United States, that was a powerful thing.
00:18:16.666 - 00:18:22.560, Speaker C: But I think in politics that seems unfortunately to be rare. Most people would rather acquire power than give it.
00:18:23.650 - 00:19:02.346, Speaker D: I think, you know, it's hard to really identify exactly what the issue is. Right. There's lots of issues. And so my background is working on Capitol Hill. I worked for seven years for, you know, so I saw even through that time, things change. Right. I think the basic structure of the bicameral system is to have a lot of ideas coming out of the House, and then the Senate is the cold saucer to cool it down and slow things down so that we end up having legislation that theoretically really is well thought out and fits what people really want and what will work for the american people.
00:19:02.346 - 00:19:43.654, Speaker D: Many things have distorted that process over time from the way that elections work and who ends up becoming our representatives. Right. The money that's involved in that process to the, as a former staffer, I think staffers should be paid more money and then they could stay in Capitol Hill longer. But the reality is a lot of the expertise is outside. Right. And so then you have regulatory capture, which I'm sure a lot of people are here familiar with the idea of where incumbents are able to have disproportionate impact on legislation that gets passed. So you have this kind of perfect storm of all these things happening.
00:19:43.654 - 00:19:58.954, Speaker D: And then we do have larger cultural division, which is also at a high point right now. And so it's very difficult to get anything substantive through when they're always rushing and panicking over funding the government.
00:19:59.072 - 00:20:49.210, Speaker C: Well, they try to do it in these omnibus bills. And from what I've understood, that if the stablecoin bill happens, it's going to be in an omnibus bill, and as a result, it's not going to be really put out for public comment. It's the lobbyists of the industry who want the regulation, who are making it happen and essentially getting it done. And those of us who are going to have to live under the regime are not going to have a time to comment on it, from what I gather. So that's the thing that's unfortunate in the DeFi community. One of the interesting problems is that during the Trump administration, there was an omnibus bill that included the Corporate Transparency act. That's causing problems for a lot of DeFi projects because corporations and llcs, you have to report the ultimate beneficial owner to Fincent.
00:20:49.210 - 00:21:26.678, Speaker C: And one of the challenges is in a DeFi world, you might not know the ultimate beneficial owner of everybody in your project, and that might not necessarily mean you're breaking the law. In fact, I suspect in most cases, it does not mean you're breaking the law, but it just means that you can't comply with that. Well, the Corporate Transparency act was jammed into an omnibus NDAA, National Defense Authorization act. That's when everything seems to get done. Right now, it gets jammed into these omnibus bills. Trump vetoed it and Congress overrode it because, oh, of course, we have to fund the military. Right.
00:21:26.678 - 00:22:00.850, Speaker C: Well, what was in there was this massive change in privacy impacting in a privacy impacting way that I don't think a lot of folks understood. And it does have a big impact on DeFi. So in Colorado, for example, spork DaO is registered as a co op. And in Wyoming, we have the DAO LLC law. In Wyoming that is covered by the Corporate Transparency act. Stay tuned. Might not, Wyoming is going to be doing something, I think, that might break that open.
00:22:00.850 - 00:22:15.990, Speaker C: But this is the point. These big things happened and nobody had a chance to comment on them because they got jammed through in the omnibus bill. And I am afraid that's going to happen with a stablecoin bill in a few weeks. It's a double edged sword.
00:22:16.330 - 00:22:27.980, Speaker A: It is an election year, Michelle. So I'm curious what you think the potential outcomes of this election this fall could have on the impact of the regulation one and two, the lawmaking scene as the other.
00:22:28.830 - 00:24:04.806, Speaker B: Yeah, certainly if we have a change in administration, then I think we're clearly going to see a change as we have any time that there's a change administration, a turnover of the heads of the regulatory agencies because those are political appointees from the president confirmed by the Senate. That could very much change the way the regulatory agencies are deciding to prioritize their resources, the tax that they want to take as far as let's look at this and put out more guidance or let's continue on the path of, well, we'll just go after people in court and let it sort out there. So I think that the election potentially could greatly change how things are going to be handled. But we have to remember that because some legislation and bills that we've tried to put forward are really important, too, that even if we don't have a change of administration, having turnover within Congress is really important because potentially that could affect whether some of the legislation that industry wants and that will give more clarity will actually get through. And I don't want to leave. It seems like we're dooming and glooming here, but I will say this is the first time that we've ever seen any crypto bill move out of committee. So this year we had two bills that moved out of the House Financial services Committee.
00:24:04.806 - 00:24:20.558, Speaker B: I'm very optimistic that going forward after the election that there will be sufficient change here or there to stir things up and get some needed clarity in the regulatory space moving.
00:24:20.724 - 00:24:33.666, Speaker A: How do you think Congress is trying to rein in regulators, if at all, or enable them? And on the flip side, what are the tools that the public can use to fight back against what's been going on as ahead?
00:24:33.768 - 00:25:25.058, Speaker D: Yeah. As was articulated earlier, I'm really not sure that Congress is doing that much to rate in regulators. There are definitely people, I guess, let me rephrase. In the House majority right now, there have been actions and there have been statements that people really are tired of the kind of additional power grab that the regulators are kind of taking. I think recently we saw the vote also out of committee of a bill that would revoke something that's kind of like a regulation, sab 121 specifically. That is just not great for crypto. I won't go into the details there, but there are actions being taken to kind of check them a little bit.
00:25:25.058 - 00:25:44.890, Speaker D: I think it will take more, will take a bipartisan effort to really rein in the regulators and intentionally right now, especially right now, with the regulators being led by folks appointed by democratic presidents and Democratic Party, if they're in the majority in the Senate, it makes it kind of hard to check their own folks, but it's necessary.
00:25:45.870 - 00:25:47.450, Speaker A: And what about the courts?
00:25:48.270 - 00:26:21.298, Speaker C: Well, stay tuned. I'll tell you soon. The custodia case, it is public information, is now what's called fully briefed and it will either be decided on summary judgment or after trial. And the trial date is scheduled April eigth. So it's coming up pretty soon. Across the board, this industry has had success in the courts, predominantly against the SEC, the Texas Blockchain Commission, suing the EIA, the energy Information Agency this past week, and winning. We just keep winning.
00:26:21.298 - 00:26:34.586, Speaker C: And I got to highlight, I've only met John Deaton once. He's here. I don't know if he's here today. John, if you are, make noise. He's here. He came to East Denver. I helped make sure that he got to come here.
00:26:34.586 - 00:27:05.262, Speaker C: He's running against Senator Warren. And the reason that I bring him up is because he gathered 80,000 people, XRP owners, to agree to intervene in the ripple case. But here's the thing that even I didn't understand. As somebody who was trained as an attorney. Those 80,000 people agreed to become defendants against the SEC. They agreed to be sued by the US government and they won. Okay, that guy is here and he's running for Senate against Elizabeth Warren.
00:27:05.262 - 00:27:13.490, Speaker C: Go stop by his booth and meet him. I look forward to shaking his hand. If anybody's here from the Deaton campaign, please wave. They must be at their booth.
00:27:13.650 - 00:27:23.420, Speaker A: I know we're getting close to time, so I'd love to do a quick round robin of what you see the landscape looking like in five years. On the legislative and the regulatory side.
00:27:25.550 - 00:28:29.680, Speaker B: I think we're going to see legislation that gives us a legal framework for the markets. It's going to take some time, but because I think that there's some real brain power and a lot of money that's being put into this process, I really do think that within five years we will have some useful regulation. I think that we're also going to from a number of these court cases, both court cases that are criminal in nature and some of them that are regulatory action, I think that that is going to give, I think, developers and business owners, hopefully more clarity about the rules of the road. And I think that we're also going to see that all of you are going to be building technology that's actually going to address some of these legitimate policy concerns that underlie what Congress and what the regulators are supposed to be concerned about. And I'm very excited about that.
00:28:30.610 - 00:28:31.770, Speaker A: How about you, Caitlin?
00:28:31.850 - 00:29:07.900, Speaker C: Yeah, I do believe that we will have more regulation, more clarity, and for better or for worse in the stablecoin world. If indeed the stablecoin bill does pass, everybody's going to have to become banks, all the stablecoin issuers. And as somebody who's dealt with that, holy cow. Again, I said that before. The chasm is wide. The information gap is stunning, and those of us who have tried to help fix it have been skewered. Let's see if that changes once Congress does enact it.
00:29:08.270 - 00:29:32.746, Speaker D: Yeah, I think, in short, things will look better. I do think we'll have some sort of regulatory clarity. There will be legislation that's passed and at least in the short term, as long as the markets are going up, that also improves sentiment, which sounds ridiculous, but it's true. And so conversations are just easier to kind of broach and to talk, get people to listen. And so I think I'm optimistic.
00:29:32.858 - 00:29:34.430, Speaker C: And bull markets help.
00:29:34.580 - 00:29:41.080, Speaker A: Yes. Well, thank you all. We are out of time and appreciate everyone here in the audience. Please help me. Thanking our panelists today.
00:29:44.970 - 00:29:54.600, Speaker C: WHOOP, WHOOP. Thank you. So we're going to take a ten minute break. We'll be back here at 155.
00:29:55.130 - 00:29:55.780, Speaker B: If you do.
