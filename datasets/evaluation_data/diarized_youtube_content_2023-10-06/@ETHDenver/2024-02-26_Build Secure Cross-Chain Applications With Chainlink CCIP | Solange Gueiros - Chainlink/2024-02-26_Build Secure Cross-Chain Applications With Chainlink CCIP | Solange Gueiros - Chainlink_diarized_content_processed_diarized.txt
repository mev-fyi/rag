00:00:07.690 - 00:00:53.126, Speaker A: Yes, we are on time. Welcome everyone. I'm here to talk with you about CCIP cross chain applications and this is me, my name is Solenjigerus, you can call me Sol. These are my contacts and you can find me in the other side, in the other building as well because I am leading the camp build. And let's start about talking with our bounties. I know that I have another mic, the hangs on mic where this is the other mic that I cannot walk around. Yes, now I can walk a bit.
00:00:53.126 - 00:01:27.854, Speaker A: I know that I must be over there, but let's walk. So this is our bounties today it's Denver hackathon. So we have two kind of prices. First is using CCIP and I may teaching you how to use the CCIp. And we have 2000 for the best for projects and 2000 more for someone that uses CCIP and USDC. I'm teaching you how to use USDC as well. And also we have more five for the five best projects.
00:01:27.854 - 00:02:12.740, Speaker A: We have more 2000 for each of these five best projects using any of the other chaining services. And if you use all of them, you can win in both tracks maybe. Let's see. And this is the presentation. So this is the most important for you. You can take a picture, you can read this QR code and I will try to do a demonstration here using CCIP. And if you'd like to do my demonstration in a hang zone session later, you can go to the KP build because we have another session starting like 05:00 p.m.
00:02:12.740 - 00:02:42.842, Speaker A: Using this in a hang zone part. Okay. And this is first of all, okay, I'm from chain link. Chain link. It's a platform related to Oracles, related to services that you can use. So oracles are any kind of data source that are outside of a blockchain or even in another blockchain and you'd like to bring it to your ismatch content. How you can bring information to your ismatch content.
00:02:42.842 - 00:03:23.782, Speaker A: Oracle is the key to do this. And when you talk about Oracles, it's so important that you have a decentralized Oracle network, not only one source to bring the information. So Chainlink is a decentralized Oracle network platform with different services for you. So we have the data feeds to get prices to get information and the data streams as well. We have the CCAP to have cross chain transactions between blockchains. We are doing this in a few minutes, but also we have functions to get information. Imagine that.
00:03:23.782 - 00:04:12.630, Speaker A: We would like to get an API external API using a JavaScript code and bring this information to your as much content you can do it and also you can generate your own numbers. You can automate some execution in your as much content. You can do everything using the services from Chainlink platform. And by the way, Chainlink is deployed in different blockchains so you can see the services in different blockchains as well. This is another important QR code for you. If you have a presentation, you already have this because all that you need to learn and it's not me, but you can learn more in our documentation as well. And this is let's talk about CCIp.
00:04:12.630 - 00:05:29.304, Speaker A: So CCIP in a high level we have like you are the end user and you have your application, your application. You communicate with the cCap how to and the ccap how to smart content. In deciding the Cersei blockchain you must say what is the message that you'd like to send to the other transaction, to the other blockchain? And what is the other blockchain? What is the destination chain? And we have an off chain part that is a decentralized oracle network that take care of this. And after this the outer in the other network, in the destination blockchain you receive your message, you receive your transaction and then maybe you are sending some application over there or in my case now I'm sending directly to my wallet because I'm sending USDC. So I will do this first in a practical way and I have some minutes in the middle that I can explain more for you. So let's go. I need both.
00:05:29.304 - 00:05:56.956, Speaker A: Yes. So here we are. I am on remix now and I have smart content. Where is my smart content? I have this basic smart context. Don't worry, I will share this with you later. But this is my content where I am on the avalanche Fuji network. So I'm starting on avalanche Fuji testnet and I'm sending my tokens to Sepolia.
00:05:56.956 - 00:06:21.850, Speaker A: This is my goal. Some things that we must have. We must have the network set up in our metamask. We must have tokens and also you must have the USDC token you can get in the faucet. All the links are in my presentation. So here we are. This is my contract and I will do my transaction first and then explain what I have here.
00:06:21.850 - 00:06:41.920, Speaker A: I will deploy my contract first of all. So let's deploy it. This is my context to transfer USDC between chains. Let's see if I am on the right chain. Yes, I am on avalanche. Deploy it. Go metamask.
00:06:41.920 - 00:07:04.064, Speaker A: Yes. Now. Yes. Okay, I think in a minute you have one more content here. This was other contents that I was playing here. Probably you saw me playing here. This was other contents related to tokens.
00:07:04.064 - 00:07:25.576, Speaker A: Like because I click it twice. I would not do this. Okay, one is enough. This is my contract. So now how can I transfer this? I can transfer this. In order to transfer iu pay fees only in the Cersei blockchain. So I am in avalanche Fuji.
00:07:25.576 - 00:07:49.664, Speaker A: Now I must pay the fees in the destination blockchain. But I do this here. Now on avalanche Fuji. The fees will be calculated by my contract. And when I'm paying fees, I can choose if I'd like to pay fees in the nativity token. In this case, in the avalanche Fuji or using the link token. It's like easy to get the link token than the nativity token.
00:07:49.664 - 00:08:22.238, Speaker A: So I'm using link. Now I'm sending link to my contract to pay the fees. Let's do this. This is my contract so I have the address. I came into metamask tokens link and let's send to my contact. Five links. Here we are almost done.
00:08:22.238 - 00:08:53.430, Speaker A: Send. After this I'd like to transfer USDC. So I must approve the USDC that I have in my wallet. I must approve my concept to use my USDC to transfer my USDC. So how can I do this again? I will copy the address of my contract. But I must came to the USDC token supposed to be here but it's not. So let's get in my presentation.
00:08:53.430 - 00:09:14.400, Speaker A: It's in some place here. Get USDC transfer. Okay. This is something to you but probably I have it here. Yes. I need this. And I have this in my presentation in another place.
00:09:14.400 - 00:10:04.300, Speaker A: So what is this? I'm going to the WesTDC content on Fujinaw and I must go to write as proxy to get the approve function. And my account is already connected. So who is the spender? That I'd like to have is my contact here and how much I'd like to spend. Imagine that it's one and the USDC has six decimal places. So the connection with my metamask. It's a bit slow but in a few minutes my metamask will open the pop up to do this. Yes, done.
00:10:04.300 - 00:10:36.510, Speaker A: Yes. You can see that I'm approving to send one USDC. Okay. If I come back to remix probably here I can see the balance of my account. And I can see that the balance must be five links. But not in USDC yet. If I see the hours.
00:10:36.510 - 00:10:57.160, Speaker A: Yes, it's already done. So now I'm ready to transfer USDC to another chain. Who will be the receiver? The receiver will be my wallet. So get the address of my wallet is this. And the amount is one in six zeros. It was that. Let's get from here.
00:10:57.160 - 00:11:25.802, Speaker A: Six zeros. Transact again. Wait, the connection. Not too much now. Okay, now when my transaction is confirmed we can check the transaction on the CCIP explorer. So we have an explorer between the chains. Let's see this.
00:11:25.802 - 00:11:58.328, Speaker A: Let's get the transaction ID. Then I'm going to the CCAp explorer. And you can see that I started on avalanche Fujia. I'm going to Sepolia but it's not done yet. So this is the moment that I can come back to my concert and talk a bit more with you. So let's talk because we must wait a what? No, I don't like to share. No, it's not this.
00:11:58.328 - 00:12:27.212, Speaker A: No. Here. Yes. So what am I doing? I have a cross chain message. The crosschain message can be to transfer tokens that are supported or to send any kind of data. I can send a message to another content. For example, I have another example over there where I'm minting NFGs from one chain to another chain and I can even send the token.
00:12:27.212 - 00:12:57.736, Speaker A: Imagine that I send the USDC and then I like to borrow to do a link, to do a trade in the other chain. I can do this. The CCAP sender can be you. I stand our account or any smart contract. The receiver can be external account or if you have messages, information, data. You must have the CCAP receiver inside your contact. Also I present to you the howuter.
00:12:57.736 - 00:13:30.564, Speaker A: We must have the how the communication is made between the outers in both chains. And we already talked that we can token transfer messages and transfer this in different ways. This is some examples that you can do. Like we talk about the token transfer. But imagine that you can have the collateral in one chain and do something with that collateral. Lock the collateral in one chain and do borrow something another chain. You can do this.
00:13:30.564 - 00:14:05.600, Speaker A: Imagine that you can do this with NFTs like I told you before. I show you an NFT that I have that the backing ground changed according with the search chain. And I can use this with account abstraction to have some wallet included that it's working different chains. Or in gaming in data storage or computation. You can have the computation in a cheaper chain and they result in another chain. And this is. We did the CCIP.
00:14:05.600 - 00:14:48.844, Speaker A: This is the information that is important to you. If you'd like to do this alone, you have this gitbook, you have your video as well, and we did this. So all the requirements are there. So to have the avalanche Fuji, to have the token, to add the link, to have the USDC, you can have all the information on this presentation. And this is the explorer that we are using now. And this is interesting, this is the workflow that is happening this moment. So because of the USDC is a token supported by CCIP.
00:14:48.844 - 00:15:41.852, Speaker A: We have a token pool managed here. So I create my contact, the sender, it went to the outer, and the outer is talking with the token pool, depends of the token. You can lock the token in one side or you can burn the token in one side. Then we don't have only one network, we have three networks to make this secure. We have one hisk management network that take care of everything, to not have a double spend, take care of the finality of the transactions. We have another network that has a consensus to commit the transaction to the other chain. And we have a third network that's executing the transaction.
00:15:41.852 - 00:16:18.732, Speaker A: So we have different parts exactly. To be sure that this is really secure, when this arriving, the other chain is the same. Imagine that you send the token, what you did over there, you lock, maybe you are unlocking here or you are minting the token here. Depends of the token, depends of the strategy. And this is the same, it's going to the outer. And if you have a message, you must have a contact here, a receiver. But if it's only token, you can go directly to your wallet like I did.
00:16:18.732 - 00:16:50.506, Speaker A: Now I'm good. And like I said before, this is the token handling mechanism. Lock and mint, or burning, and locking the other side or burning mint. I already talked about the fees. So you are paying fees only in the search chain. And when you are paying the fees, it's calculated in the smart contract. And also you pay a premium, that is for the node rewards.
00:16:50.506 - 00:17:27.800, Speaker A: I'd like to show my content to you as well. Let's go here. So this is my content, I'm importing out the outer and client everything related to the CCIP. And then you can see here that I'm using the outer address, the link address, the USDC. This is the chain selector. I can get all of this information in the documentation of CCIP like this. So it's loading.
00:17:27.800 - 00:18:02.004, Speaker A: And then this is my message that I'd like to show you the token amount. I can send the token, the address of the token, the amount that I'd like to send. Then I'm creating a message. This message has the receiver, my wallet, no data. Now the amount of tokens. And if I'm using something like when I'm minting NFTs, I must increase the gas limit and I'm paying the fees using the link token. Here we are.
00:18:02.004 - 00:18:28.204, Speaker A: I'm calculating here the fees. And I must have more link than I must paying fees. I must have more USDC that I'd like to send. And here I'm sending the message is this. Let's see what happened with your messaging. It's here it should be. Not this, but totally finalized it.
00:18:28.204 - 00:18:49.932, Speaker A: Let's refresh my page. Yes. Success. We did it. How can I be sure? Here, one USDC. It was sent from Fuji to Sepolia seven minutes ago. So I'm going in my metamask now to Sepolia.
00:18:49.932 - 00:19:08.170, Speaker A: I should show you before that I have some. I remember that I have, I think, 22, as you see. Yes. And now I have it. 23 is this. So this was just sent now from the other chain that I did. This is really amazing.
00:19:08.170 - 00:19:33.072, Speaker A: Every time that I do this, I love it. Yes. I need to tell this. And before we are almost finishing, I like to show you that I can do this with other things as well. For example, NFTs that are the arbitrary messaging. And this is the NFT that I can mint from one chain to another chain. This is my NFT that I have it.
00:19:33.072 - 00:20:06.036, Speaker A: If you'd like to see, my collection is over there. Depends of the Cersei chain. This came from Polygon Mumbai. This came from Avalanche, Fuji, that came from Ethereum, Sepolia. And this is based on the bitcoin price. So I'm using data feeds to get the bitcoin price. And if the price is going up, since the last time that I minted the NFT, I will be happy or I will be sad or I'll be neutral.
00:20:06.036 - 00:20:27.622, Speaker A: And I did you nft 1 minute ago. Let's see this live because my time is over. I know that I did this. Now we have something now something of this. Like this is the zero. I think this is the last one I finished. Okay.
00:20:27.622 - 00:20:47.214, Speaker A: I know, I know. So is this. I just did this now in the data. See that? It was 18 minutes ago I was here. So is this. Thank you, everyone. If you'd like to do this with me now, live coding with your computer, we can go to the KMP build in the other side and we can do together.
00:20:47.214 - 00:20:50.010, Speaker A: Thanks so much. Bye.
