00:00:01.450 - 00:00:34.578, Speaker A: GM this is Richard Liu, co founder and CTO of Human Finance. Last year my team attended ETH Denver Hackathon and won the Defi track. We went on launched as a company based on the demo. Now one year later we are back as a sponsor. This is pretty awesome, right? And I hope some of you guys will get a chance to do the same as well. It our mission is to power D five for the 99%. We do so by support of various real world lending use cases.
00:00:34.578 - 00:01:21.410, Speaker A: For example, in our initial launch partnered with request network and superfluid, we allow people to borrow against their receivables such as their invoices or payment streams. The borrowing is fully collateralized, but the user does not have to pay a token from their wallet because we use their future income as a collateral. This is pretty awesome, right? And the good news is we not only support this with the human protocol, there is so much more amazing experience you can enable. I'm pleased to share. We have five bounties with a total reward of 25,000 USDC. Because of time I will only highlight one bounty. It is credit line for every wallet.
00:01:21.410 - 00:01:53.774, Speaker A: We want to enable the experience that the user can access credit from the wallet in a way make the wallet work more like a credit card. I know some of you guys would have said this is crazy and awesome. Yes indeed. And the good news is that with a human protocol and account abstraction, we think this is pretty much durable. We put quite some sorts in the bunty as an inspiration for you to get started. Please take a look. I'm sure you can take much further than what we have.
00:01:53.774 - 00:02:43.020, Speaker A: We also have a few other bunties such as Nanchihuma for the new payment network or Nanchihuma for the real world lending use cases and adding some signal adapters make the protocol more powerful or even adding some kind of content pieces. Based on our experience from the last year, it's so critical for the sponsors to offer the best support for the build owners to be successful, so we commit to offer the best support that we can. Meanwhile, we have a workshop on February 24, the first day in the builder week and from three to 430. Please mark your calendar and looking forward to see you around and have fun hacking in Denver.
