00:00:00.570 - 00:00:23.054, Speaker A: Hi everyone. Thanks for staying. So I think this is today's last talk, so I'll keep it short and sweet. Not because this topic is not complex, it is very complex, but I think it is pretty easy to understand. So I'm Denise. I work at Valora. I lead strategy, operations and product.
00:00:23.054 - 00:00:56.794, Speaker A: And if you like this talk, please follow me on Twitter. You can connect with me in Telegram. I'll show you those at the end as well. So why do I care about accessibility? I joined the cello project some three years ago pre mainit. So I joined Cello because its mission is to build a financial system that creates the conditions of prosperity for everyone. So you probably now know why I care about accessibility. So a little bit about me I am originally from Uruguay.
00:00:56.794 - 00:01:46.318, Speaker A: I now live in California. But in between these two places, I lived in about eight countries around the world and I opened a bank account in every one of those countries except for one. So I was really lucky or privileged. But that wasn't the case for everybody I met along the way. My neighbor in Ghana, they couldn't open a bank account because the local branch manager thought their micro entrepreneur income wasn't sufficient for a bank account. A friend and family in Mexico that I met while I was living there, they rely on remittances to pay for things like medical fees, school fees, and the availability of a bank account to them means that those remittances are much less costly for them to access. So the reason I care about accessibility in crypto and in Defi is because it's about people.
00:01:46.318 - 00:02:20.362, Speaker A: It's financial options give people freedom, and financial options are personal, and so it's about the people. So how is this defined in the old world? Accessibility in Trapfi has one metric, it's financial inclusion. And the World bank defines that with exactly one metric, which is access to a bank account, generally by adults. This data point, 69%, is a bit dated. I don't know what the World bank is up to. I don't know. They haven't published anything new.
00:02:20.362 - 00:02:43.762, Speaker A: But this means that about 31% of the world's adults don't have access to a bank account. Right? That is a bit crazy. But enough about tradfi. Let's move to why we're all here, web3. And I would love to learn a little bit about you. So I would love if you could give me a show of hands if you are building dapps. Is anybody here building a Dap? Yes.
00:02:43.762 - 00:02:54.162, Speaker A: Amazing. What about a defi Dap? Yes. Awesome. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I see you back there. Awesome.
00:02:54.162 - 00:03:24.030, Speaker A: And how many of you do you remember your first experience accessing a defi Dap? Do you remember that? Cool. Maybe it looked something like this. You heard about compound, so you had a coinbase account. This is a long time ago. You were hoddling on some bitcoin and eth, you heard about compound. This is just an example, by the way. And you decide to get some $50 worth of comp and you pay about $2 in a fees to coinbase.
00:03:24.030 - 00:04:19.210, Speaker A: Then you do some research and you learn that you need to move that both comp and east to a web3 wallet. And then you do that. Maybe you download metamask extension on your browser and you supply it on compound and you pay some gas fees back then. Who knows how much that was. Time passes, you get busy with your life, you do other things, and then you start hearing like DFI, summer starts and you start hearing about DFI again and you're like, oh wait, haven't I tried this before? And voila. You rediscover your comp, but then you realize that it's stuck because the $50 you had supplied now worth some other amount that I'm not going to speculate on because this was in the past, would cost you more in Eve to pay for gas fees to remove that comp from that pool. So you have your value stuck.
00:04:19.210 - 00:05:00.906, Speaker A: It's not lost, but it's stuck. So what do you do? You forget about it. And you definitely don't tell anyone about what has happened. So thinking about what are the barriers to accessibility and defi and considering that example, that is hypothetical. High tech requirements people, laptops, like accessibility is a really big issue, not just when it comes to value, but also in tech requirements. Most people around the world don't have a laptop, right? Like, people use smartphones around the world over or sometimes underwhelming amount of information. You had to do your own research to discover compound and know what to do.
00:05:00.906 - 00:05:56.670, Speaker A: Like this other tool is just like not very intuitive. The high fees, gas fees, centralized exchange fees, I don't need to say more. And then unintuitive user experience, right? Like, you didn't know that there were all these tools that you needed, like two tokens, comp and eth, and you're just discovering this thing, you're kind of stumbling upon it. Can you imagine now telling someone to try this out? Like, hey, get into defi, I'm in crypto, get into defi. Maybe I would share this with my friends in California, right? Maybe they would ask me because they know I work in crypto, and so I should know how to do this, but I wouldn't guide someone in Montevedvedeo, like my cousin, through this experience. I wouldn't be able to guide my neighbor in Ghana through this. What does this look like for them? I have no idea.
00:05:56.670 - 00:06:28.700, Speaker A: They have to find a locally relevant on ramp that they can move fiat into crypto. They need to do the research. They need to understand what DeFi protocol and DAP fits their needs. Then they need to do all the wallet research and all that information, and after all of that. So I didn't give them any answers. And I haven't even told them about the fees, the high gas fees. I have to tell them, like, yeah, this is very counterintuitive, but just trust me, you and your value are going to be all right.
00:06:28.700 - 00:07:17.766, Speaker A: Like, no, nobody wants to do that. So how do we build gateways to Defi? Right? How do we bring everybody into DeFi, considering those barriers? So, as I mentioned, I work at Valora. Valora is a mobile wallet, a mobile app, crypto mobile app built on salo. It's native to the cello ecosystem, and it tries to solve a lot of these different steps that I just mentioned. But our intention is to really create an intuitive, efficient, and easy way to get into Defi. So it's not just us here at East Denver trying it out, but it's really anybody who can just try it out. So why you should build with Valora, build on sello, build with Valora, I recorded, well, not me.
00:07:17.766 - 00:07:37.130, Speaker A: A coworker of mine recorded this demo. It's not a designer who made it. So please cut us some slack. So my intention here before I start pressing play, and I decided not to do this live because those things never work out. So I'm pretty happy the wifi wasn't working. So I don't even know if this will work out. But fingers crossed.
00:07:37.130 - 00:08:12.860, Speaker A: What I'm going to show you here is how someone who is completely new to crypto, so it's not someone who's huddling like bitcoin or ethereum on Coinbase. This is someone who's like zero to defi in the 3 minutes that this demo lasts, right? So that's kind of what you're going to see, and I'm going to guide you through it. Here we go. So with Valora, you can create a wallet in the mobile app. So you download Valora, you are guided into the wallet creation process. You get all the information upfront, and in the moment that you are navigating it. So you create your account.
00:08:12.860 - 00:08:38.958, Speaker A: You enter your piN. This is a test account, so I feel comfortable sharing this pin with you. You shouldn't share that with anybody else. You enter your phone number and Valora has the ability to map phone numbers to blockchain addresses on sello so people can send value to phone numbers. But that's not what I'm talking about today. So then you have your wallet and you decide to add some funds you're using here. Partner of Valora, ramp.
00:08:38.958 - 00:09:12.570, Speaker A: With ramp you can cash in crypto with your bank card, with your debit card, with your credit card. You don't need to create an account on a centralized exchange, then have a hold up period because ramp deposits your crypto assets that you bought in Valora directly into your Valora account. So you can start getting to DFI within the next 5 seconds. So here are the 20 sell dollars I got on Valora. I decide to use the inap swap feature to buy some sello. So I'm buying sello with sello dollars. I can do that in app.
00:09:12.570 - 00:09:34.318, Speaker A: So with ramp you can cash in sello dollars, sello or sell euros. Then in Valora you can exchange them. I choose to buy them and then this is going to show up in my feed. The purchase is processing and Valora supports all tokens on Salo. So you have a token list. So now I have two tokens on Salo and that was in like 2 minutes. The next thing is to let's go into defi and dapps.
00:09:34.318 - 00:10:01.754, Speaker A: In the Dapps page you can discover and learn about different dapps that are all mobile friendly and all work with Valora and have very intuitive and connected experiences with Valora. So let's try Uberswap. It's a decentralized exchange. Here on Uberswap you can swap pool or farm. I'm just going to show here swapping. You connect Uberswap to Valura and that happened by going between apps. Most cello assets are listed on Uberswap, so you can just pick what you want to swap for.
00:10:01.754 - 00:10:28.126, Speaker A: So here you're swapping for MCUSD. So that's on the Moolo protocol on Celo and you sign transactions with Valora. So every time you're signing a transaction on chain, you are signing with Valora. So you don't need to do anything else. You're just going to app back and forth. So here you're swapping, you're confirming every transaction in Valora and that's it. But it's not just sello assets that you can get with Valora.
00:10:28.126 - 00:11:04.334, Speaker A: Let's say you're a complete crypto newbie, right? So you're like, I heard about Ethereum. Let me get some of that. With Valora. Because Valora is on sello, you can get bridged assets or wrapped assets. So in this example, you're getting wrapped ETH also with your fingertips on your mobile phone. So here again, you're standing with Valora and the wrapped ETH. You're now holding and owning ETH for the first time as a crypto newbie and new person to defi all those assets available in Valora for you to continue your defi explorations through Dapps explorer, like getting to know the seller ecosystem and beyond.
00:11:04.334 - 00:11:30.582, Speaker A: So all of that from your mobile phone, I hope that demo was. Thanks. Thanks. I'll share it with you later. I think you can watch the recording. But thank you for enthusiasm. So let's build gateways to defi together, right? Valora is like the gateway to the sello ecosystem.
00:11:30.582 - 00:12:21.126, Speaker A: If you guys are building dapps, if you're considering sello, building with Valora is just like a match made in heaven. So what are some of the key ingredients here? Easy onramps. Valora offers that so your DAP can allow their users to just on ramp through Valora and then connect with Valora to your DAP. Low tech requirements. You can access people and potential users anywhere in the world, not just at East Denver, low fees and fast transactions because the solid network is just amazing and great education. So being able to hold people's hands through that first experience so they don't have to have the hypothetical experience with compounds that I shared before, can really lower the barriers to access. People can have a great first experience with DFI and with low, low barriers to accessing that.
00:12:21.126 - 00:12:36.300, Speaker A: So they don't have to get started with a huge amount of money. They can get started with 20 sell dollars or $20 worth of crypto or less. They can do that in like 5 minutes on a mobile phone. And so with that is how we're going to bring DeFi to everyone. So thank you.
