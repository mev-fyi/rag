00:00:06.090 - 00:00:50.698, Speaker A: I'm told we can adjust these things so people can hear us, FYi. Hey, everybody, thanks for being here. This may sound like something a little bit different regenerative ag, but there's a pretty profound decentralization component to this in a decentralized protocol component to this. So before we get started, disclosure, I know these people. These people know these people. And my brother had some issues with his land, and he sought out ways to heal his land, essentially. So he was connected with Rob.
00:00:50.698 - 00:01:48.180, Speaker A: And the rest of the story unfolded in the creation of a company called Fifth World. Mark Ziadi was a stellar contributor at consensus and has done a bunch of things in his career and talked to him about this, and he was excited to join. So we know each other. The people around here live in perfect harmony with nature. Everybody at Denver is a transformative individual. We've all been living for centuries in harmony with the buffacorn and spork whale up in the mountains in Colorado. But imagine what would happen if something threatened the spork whale or the buffacorn intrinsic to the Colorado economy.
00:01:48.180 - 00:01:52.052, Speaker A: Could you imagine a scenario like that?
00:01:52.186 - 00:01:55.750, Speaker B: That would be horrible, be absolutely the worst thing in the world.
00:01:56.620 - 00:01:58.664, Speaker A: Can you adjust a little bit better? Yeah.
00:01:58.702 - 00:01:59.576, Speaker B: How's that?
00:01:59.758 - 00:02:09.440, Speaker A: What could happen to an economy if something cataclysmic like that, that would cause the economy to come out of balance?
00:02:09.620 - 00:02:46.020, Speaker B: Well, I mean, the economy actually fundamentally runs on ecology, essentially, but most people don't even think about it. When you think about what civilization is. Civilization right now, as we know it, is based on agriculture plus money, essentially. And so an agriculture fundamentally is allowing us to transform ecosystems in order to create the supply chains that humans require in order to run civilization. So if the buffacorn and the spork whales disappeared, we might not be able to run agriculture anymore.
00:02:46.620 - 00:02:53.160, Speaker A: Have we experienced anything like this before in human history? Maybe outside of Colorado?
00:02:53.500 - 00:03:40.650, Speaker B: Well, yeah, actually. So when we think about the arc of human history, we were actually forced into agriculture as a result of the younger dryas. And so when we have massive perturbations in ecology, it forces us to adapt in really unique ways. And I think the risk that's in front of us right now, from a regen ag perspective, I'm not sure if you've seen this, but in Scientific American, they're saying there's about 60 crop cycles left on planet Earth. So there's a whole bunch of alarm bells that are going off on what does it actually mean for us to continue to have a supply chain, specifically food and water, in light of some of these liabilities that are right in front of us right now.
00:03:41.820 - 00:04:35.130, Speaker A: Thank you. So, Daniel Schmocktenberger, one of the greatest minds, thinkers, philosophers on the planet, sense maker in a sense, or this doesn't make sense, pointer outer. He's pointed out that essentially we're operating with an exponentially growing financial economy, which drives our economy, our real economy, far too hard and far too hot. And essentially, this exponential economy is driving what could be a more linear, more balanced, more circular economy, even to produce waste essentially at exponential rates. Mark, you want to run with.
00:04:35.820 - 00:05:23.332, Speaker C: So, you know, Daniel talks about the third attractor, right. And the fact that we're kind of right now stuck between two options, which is either increased centralization or anarchism. Right. And I think the answer really is progressive decentralization. So it's the continuation of this mission of progressive decentralization across all levels. I think in the crypto space, we've been focused so far heavily on self custody of bits, so digital assets and data, and we are now starting to move more into self custody of atoms, which really means physical infrastructure. And the good news is that there are so many solutions out there that allows us to go in that direction.
00:05:23.332 - 00:05:54.130, Speaker C: So you think about regenerative agriculture, and I think Rob can talk more about this. Distributed energy systems, water systems, these are all solutions that can enable communities and individuals to have ownership over and self custody over their food, energy and water. And it's interesting because I sometimes wish we have some technology incentive layer that can enable coordination at scale. Do you know something about that?
00:05:54.500 - 00:05:56.336, Speaker A: I've been doing some reading recently.
00:05:56.448 - 00:06:41.650, Speaker C: Yeah, I think I heard the term web3 and crypto maybe, or something like that. So if we can start build those networks, right, of autonomous communities that have self custody over food, water, energy, data assets. So both bits and atoms, we can really usher from the paradigm of linear extractive economies, where basically users have an adverse relationship with businesses to an economy that is more regenerative, circular, resilient, even anti fragile, and basically allow us to generate positive externalities and solve a lot of those negative externalities that we're dealing with today. And so at Fifthworld, we call this basically regenerative living or regenerative network states.
00:06:42.740 - 00:07:26.656, Speaker A: If you want to go a little deeper on some of that, I do recommend listening to Kevin Owaki's podcast, Green Pill. He had a three parter with Daniel Schmachtenberger. Look up Schmocktenberger. It's exactly how it sounds, spelled exactly how it sounds. But it was absolutely essential synthesis of thinking about our own decentralized protocol ecosystem and what Daniel speaks about all the time. So, fortunately, I feel like we're in a transition and the transition is accelerating. The paradigm shift is decidedly on.
00:07:26.656 - 00:07:37.764, Speaker A: Transitions are hard. Hopefully this one won't be so difficult. This super cycle is ending. How do we get to the next super cycle? What does transition look like?
00:07:37.802 - 00:07:45.920, Speaker D: Michelle, so you're asking what it's going to look like to transition to this regenerative economy.
00:07:46.000 - 00:07:54.730, Speaker A: I would love to hear what you're seeing in terms of the business, different systems with respect to land energy.
00:07:57.100 - 00:09:10.192, Speaker D: You can certainly attest that anytime you want to go against entrenched interests and existing structures, it's difficult. Right? And we can think about this space, this web3 space and the crypto space in the last ten years. And there's this top down model where you've got authority monopolies or gatekeepers. And in this space, you guys have been working really hard in building tools to have bottom up solutions and bottom up models. And we essentially need to, well, those top down centralized systems repeat, whether we're talking about energy systems like how do we power this building, or how do we supply water, or how do we get food? It's all top down centralized control, and there's very little bottom up thinking and bottom up solutions. So the challenge is big because you've seen it's taken ten years, and I think if we went back ten years ago and asked people in this room, how easy is it going to be to transform the financial system, there would be many people saying, oh, my gosh, it's going to be really difficult. It's going to be really hard.
00:09:10.192 - 00:09:39.720, Speaker D: And I don't want to downplay how difficult it's been, but ten years later, I think maybe the mood is different. And I'm excited about we're now facing the same challenge in these other systems. And so that gives me tons of optimism in terms of how we can do the same thing and we can also leverage all these tools, systems, processes, learnings from the web3 community. And I feel like that'll help us accelerate this transition to regenerative economies.
00:09:40.140 - 00:10:04.530, Speaker A: So early on, we used to say, decentralize all the things, tokenize all the things. Maybe we should take a step back and figure out how we regenerate all the things, or decentralize and regenerate all the things. What is regenerative ag? What have you and Michelle been doing for the last many years in your practice? Do you want to take that?
00:10:05.300 - 00:10:50.368, Speaker B: Yeah, for the last 15 years, actually. I'm going to go back a little bit further. So I'm actually a petroleum engineer. So I started off in the oil and gas industry in the belly of the giant Calgary, Alberta. I was the guy that was bringing natural gas and fossil fuel to your cars and natural gas to your homes to heat it, and felt really conflicted about how could I criticize the very industry that I was supporting as a consumer. And so I called my wife up one day after watching a three minute video of this guy who was regenerating a piece of desert in the lowest place on earth, dead Sea Valley, with very few resources. And I was about ready to cut down a massive swath of forest in order to bring a new natural gas pipeline in.
00:10:50.368 - 00:11:17.428, Speaker B: And I'm like, oh my gosh, what am I doing? So being an engineer and a complete nerd, I took my calculator out of my pocket. I calculated out how many hours of life energy I have on this earth, and I said, it's about 600,000. And I've burned through a third of them. How do I want to spend the next two thirds of my life? So I quit my job. I encouraged Michelle to quit her job, too. And we traveled around the world looking for positive solutions. And we've been teaching that for the last 15 years through a system called permaculture.
00:11:17.428 - 00:11:41.904, Speaker B: And we've transformed thousands of people's lives around the planet. And what's super exciting about it is actually the issues that we're talking about today are not technical issues. It's a social issue. We have all the tools, we have all the resources, we have all the knowledge to regenerate planet Earth rapidly. But we're lacking a coordination layer, and I'm not sure where we should find that.
00:11:42.102 - 00:12:25.484, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm still wondering. I know we've been doing some readings about web3, but just to add to that a little bit, the way I got into regenerative agriculture was through chatting with Joe. And I remember Joe shared with me a very cool documentary to watch. I think it's called the biggest little farm. My background was in crypto economics, and I've done a lot of token designs and interesting systems designed around how to use tokens and incentives. And then I watched this documentary, and this was basically the exact same type of thinking. But in real life, I was watching those people actually just creating life by thinking through how they can build a symbiotic ecosystem.
00:12:25.484 - 00:13:05.740, Speaker C: And then it just clicked. Like, what if we can use all those experiments, all those currency experiments, monetary experiments that we're doing in crypto incentives experiments and connect them somehow to regeneration, to agriculture, to food, energy, and water, we'll be able to usher into a whole new paradigm and whole new economy. And one comprehensive I really like to talk about a lot is the same way. Nature needs biodiversity. I think our societies today needs monetary diversity. We need to create money that is linked to specific purposes that allow us to become resilient to financial cris and resilient to linear and extractive systems.
00:13:06.080 - 00:13:40.410, Speaker A: Awesome. So, Michelle and or Rob, can you describe what a recirculating agricultural sort of living ecosystem might be? So, as opposed to some sort of factory farm thing, which is essentially robbing the land of nutrients and destroying the land, what does a recirculating farm that is essentially in harmony with itself and in harmony with people like yourselves, what does that look like?
00:13:40.940 - 00:14:23.540, Speaker B: So, the best example that we have of this, one of the best examples, is what was actually occurring on the eastern seaboard of the United States. Before Europeans came here. There was close to 30 million indigenous people living on that seaboard, and there were no signs of what we call agriculture today. In fact, we now know that they were actually using a form of agriculture, but it's more of a centropic agroforestry system, where they were basically living off of the byproducts of perennial plants, plants that you plant once, and they continue to grow. And so we know that the short answer to your question, Joe, is nature. Nature provides all of nature. It's called nature.
00:14:23.540 - 00:15:22.536, Speaker B: And agriculture, in a way, for the last 10,000 years, has essentially been at war with nature. So we've been following the same pattern of deforesting, plowing, and desertifying. And the problem is that we had very short human lives, and so we were unable to understand the feedback of the damage that we were creating, essentially. And so I believe now that we can merge with technology in a way that allows us to take all the democratized sensors that are showing up on the market, and we can essentially create a WHOOP for planet Earth. WHOOP. This little device right here that I wear has been transforming the way that I interact with my environment. When I go to sleep, what I eat, I can get instantaneous feedback on what I'm doing on a day to day basis so that I can course correct and become a healthier human being.
00:15:22.536 - 00:16:01.140, Speaker B: We have all the technology now to do that. And so fifth world is starting to integrate those pieces together into a unified MRV system that will allow humans to have a better understanding of what they're doing on a day to day basis. And so our thesis is that humans are not inherently destructive. We just lack feedback. And I believe that the system that will allow us to essentially create these new supply chains that work in harmony with nature can be worked out and sorted out once we have the right data and the right dashboards at our fingertips that allow us to make better decisions.
00:16:02.040 - 00:17:05.924, Speaker D: I have another example, like taking this bottom up solutions. What does that actually mean in the realm of water? Because that's one of my areas of expertise. So traditionally, communities or municipalities, when they're trying to provide water to their community, they think we need a top down, centralized solution, right? We need to build a massive water treatment plant. We need to pull water from a river and then build one network of pipes to deliver that water to all these houses in these communities. And we just turn the tap on, right? And yet better tools like big data and systems analysis has actually shown us that it's a much more resilient system to have more local supply. So have individual houses with rainwater, for example, or have those homes manage their own stormwater instead of send that stormwater straight to sink. And so we need more of that bottom up local solutions in the same way that, again, web3 allows peer to peer transactions.
00:17:05.924 - 00:17:15.790, Speaker D: We need more local energy, we need more local water, we need more local food systems, we need more bottom up. And not only relying on top down centralized control. Yeah.
00:17:16.400 - 00:18:21.216, Speaker A: So a lot of the time, people ask me if I think things are going well in our ecosystem. Is this what I expected? And generally, that's a big yes. I'm amazed at how little resistance, despite all the resistance that we've encountered, I'm amazed at how little resistance really we've encountered. Given the vested interests on the planet, they've woken up quite significantly, and the attacks will continue. Maybe they will intensify, maybe not. But the bottom line is that we built these amazing systems, decentralized protocols, interacting modular components, a whole new vision for a system of the world, a new system of the world that's profoundly decentralized, but it's all sitting up here on somebody else's clouds. It's all running on fundamental infrastructure that we could get bumped off of.
00:18:21.216 - 00:18:50.924, Speaker A: And I'm talking about compute infrastructure. And yes, there is some real decentralized compute infrastructure. There's solo stakers, et cetera. But I'm talking about land, I'm talking about food, I'm talking about water, I'm talking about energy in its various different forms. I'm talking about legal systems. And recently I've been talking to various builders and, yes, investors and other people about what we can do about it. It's a coordination problem.
00:18:50.924 - 00:19:26.580, Speaker A: We need to form, I think, giant pools of capital and go out and figure out how to ground all this that we're building in fundamental substructure. And so that's a big project. And this is, I think, a really interesting part of that big project. It might need a manifesto. This project might need a manifesto. Mark, if this project had a manifesto, what would some of the elements of that project be?
00:19:26.730 - 00:20:11.504, Speaker C: Yeah, only if it had a manifesto. So you use the word builder in there. And I like this term because I think for a long time we've been using this word to mean developers. But in our company and in our network, we use this term to actually means creators, contributors, makers, right? People who are actually building physical infrastructure. And I think we need to keep promoting that and keep building those builder communities. And so if we look at the current paradigm that we're under, it's a paradigm of growth above everything else. And we love growth, we love evolution, and we want to grow, but at the same time, we are dealing with a lot of negative externalities coming from only thinking about growth.
00:20:11.504 - 00:21:01.536, Speaker C: And so what we also focus on is how do we grow in an antifragile way, in a way that instead of generating negative externalities, can generate positive externalities. And for us, we really know we are at a stage right now in our human evolution where we're kind of ushering into the next stage. I think, Joe, you call it the super cycle, and it's exciting, right? But it's also a challenge. And I think, in my opinion, at least, the biggest challenge is how do we do that in a way that allows us to build a regenerative, harmonious relationship between technology, humanity and nature. And then if we're able to figure that out, this will usher us into basically decentralized acceleration instead of just effective acceleration. I love effective acceleration. I think technology is a key part of human evolution and a key part of humanity.
00:21:01.536 - 00:21:12.376, Speaker C: But at the same time, if we can grow and accelerate in a decentralized way, we'll be basically growing in a more resilient and anti fragile way and in a more positive way.
00:21:12.558 - 00:21:36.544, Speaker B: So we know that, coming back to your Schmucktenberger piece, that the first and the second attractor are not places that we want to go. And I loved how Schmucktenberger said the third attractor is someplace we want to be, but we don't necessarily know how to build it completely. But the brains in this room, I can almost guarantee, can figure that out. And this is where the VDAO is going to play a really important role to bring all those pieces together.
00:21:36.742 - 00:21:49.190, Speaker A: So, Michelle, what does fifth world do? Does it have products? Does it have services? What roles do the members of Fifth World? How many people are in fifth world? What roles do they perform?
00:21:50.360 - 00:22:10.540, Speaker D: Fifth world is about regenerative living. Like tools for regenerative living. Right? So we do a lot, and that's why it's a little bit difficult to put in one little nugget. But let's say if it touches sustainability and regenerative living, we have a play there. We teach courses. We just launched.
00:22:11.440 - 00:22:14.348, Speaker A: So there's a verge. Permaculture group.
00:22:14.434 - 00:22:34.256, Speaker D: Yeah, we teach courses in sustainability, rainwater design, past solar greenhouses, permaculture design, gardening, all that stuff, all those just like hands touch grass, hands in the dirt, skills that your grandmother didn't teach you. So that's the education side. I could probably pass it on to Mark. Mark's got the crypto side.
00:22:34.438 - 00:22:58.948, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. So thriftworth basically designs and builds actually anti fragile and regenerative food, water and energy systems. We've been doing that for individuals. We've been doing that for communities. We have education arm that educates people on how to do it themselves. And there's a lot of people interested in that. And recently we launched this dow to really figure out how can we use web3 to coordinate and also innovate.
00:22:58.948 - 00:23:24.470, Speaker C: And so part of BDAO is really bringing in the crypto community with the regen ag and permaculture community into one place, enabling discussions, interactions, and even ideating solutions in the physical and digital world that can usher us into this decentralized regenerative paradigm. So if you want to know more, we do have a happy hour later today, and I really encourage you all to go and talk to us.
00:23:25.400 - 00:23:52.444, Speaker A: So you all have products like greenhouses, designs for things like eco villages, consultants that go out and work very hands on or just indicatively, instructively with people. If there were to be a dao of a vdao. Indeed. But what sorts of roles could people take on in fifth world?
00:23:52.482 - 00:24:45.496, Speaker C: Dow yeah, so there's a bunch of roles. We basically have three goals behind launching the Dao. One goal is enabling community interaction and community discussion in the virtual space, but also in the real world, having real world meetups, having supper clubs. There's a cool slow food movement that Ralph was telling me about that we want to also bring into the crypto ecosystem. Another big goal of ours is really creating high tech, high nature, high touch, pop up experiences. So we've been following Zuzulu and we've been following the work that has been going on there, and we really want to bring in the agriculture and food and energy piece into it. And the last piece is we're going to be running some idea towns around it, eating solutions, some very cool competitions, not to convey a lot of details, but meme related.
00:24:45.496 - 00:24:48.460, Speaker C: So follow us and you'll get to know more.
00:24:48.530 - 00:25:02.610, Speaker A: Cool. So, to wrap us up, five words each on what's most exciting to you about what's going on in your work or in fifth world mark. Five words, maybe more. Community.
00:25:05.560 - 00:25:11.460, Speaker D: Turned our mics off. Oh, no, they didn't. Being here and connecting with this community.
00:25:11.530 - 00:25:12.644, Speaker A: Is really to me.
00:25:12.682 - 00:25:13.172, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:25:13.306 - 00:25:22.900, Speaker B: So I'm really stoked about our MRV project. So if Ethereum is the world computer, the work we're doing in MRV is essentially creating the WHOOP for planet Earth.
00:25:23.560 - 00:25:28.780, Speaker A: WHOOP for planet Earth. Five words. Perfect. Thanks, everyone. That's great.
00:25:28.890 - 00:25:40.330, Speaker E: All right. Thank you guys so much. Thank you. This is a world that needs to exist, a world that I want to live in, and we need to. Next up, we have.
