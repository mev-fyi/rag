00:00:07.690 - 00:00:47.770, Speaker A: Hey, what's going on, everyone? Welcome to my speech on rise of the hyperchain. My name is Daniel Lumi. I'm the senior product manager of Zkstack, built for Zksync. So today we'll be talking about our vision for scaling the blockchain to mainstream adaptation. And first I'll go a little bit into what is Matterlabs and how does it relate to ZK sync? So Matterlabs is one of the leading ZK companies. We've raised over $250,000,000 and we have over 150 experts in engineering and cryptography. We really have a world class team with people from SpaceX and Microsoft and Google and Uber.
00:00:47.770 - 00:01:28.730, Speaker A: So Zksync is an l two built on top of Ethereum that uses zero knowledge proofs. We, as Matterlabs, were the inventors for Zksync, and now we're one of the main core contributors. There's also a lot of other core contributors, such as lambda and transaction fusion and many other ones. So our goal for Zksync is to essentially make a safe and easy to use blockchain that is always cheap, regardless of the scale that it goes to. And this is very important to do these things without compromises. That's why we're all in blockchain. That's why we're all in Ethereum.
00:01:28.730 - 00:02:41.594, Speaker A: So the state of blockchains today, and yeah, I'm talking about dilemma, not trilemma. Before you bounce on me, dilemma. Okay, so how does the Internet scale? Right? And this will explain the dilemma, right? Just as a mental model, imagine that you're playing a game on your computer, right? That might work, assuming you have a good computer, and then you start booting a bunch of other applications, and at some point you simply cannot run every single application on your computer at once. Right? So how does the Internet deal with this? So let's say there's a bunch of people that want to order a new iPhone, the preorder it. So maybe it works for the first thousand people, but at some point it's going to be too many users entering the website for it to all be supported by one server. So essentially what they do is they copy the state of the Apple website onto many different servers and then they can scale sort of limitlessly horizontally, and everyone can get the website. So the Internet, if you allocate one server with n resources, it has one x scale.
00:02:41.594 - 00:03:22.014, Speaker A: If you allocate another, let's say three servers, then it has four x scale. So it scales linearly according to the amount of resources allocated to it. So how does blockchain scale? Well, the important part and the whole point of blockchain is that you need to form consensus. Every single server on the network needs to reexecute every single transaction of the network. And this will happen thousands or tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of times, depending on how big the network is. And similar to the Internet, we can't support all of the world's blockchain transactions and applications on every single one of those servers. This should be really obvious.
00:03:22.014 - 00:04:12.400, Speaker A: And if you're being told that you can do this, it's probably dishonest or just ignorance into how computers work. So this is the problem that every blockchain has. Essentially they need to balance between decentralization and scalabilities, because if they make it too scalable, then maybe two computers in the world can run it. Or at some point that computer, you won't have any computers in the world, it can't go infinitely bigger. Right? And you are sacrificing decentralization. So Ethereum decided to focus on decentralization, keep the scalability really low so we can make it maximally decentralized and secure. As l two, Zksync can essentially inherit the decentralization and then focus on scalability instead.
00:04:12.400 - 00:04:45.362, Speaker A: So again, every single computer needs to run every single transaction. So if you have one computer on Ethereum network, you have one x scale. If you have ten computers, you still have one x scale. If you have 1000 computers, it didn't scale at all, it got more decentralized. But that's not going to support the world's transaction throughput. So how about cross chain? Maybe we can just scale cross chain. The whole point of blockchains is to have a global state that doesn't have trusted entities.
00:04:45.362 - 00:05:06.560, Speaker A: If you start doing crosschain, you have trusted entities. That defeats the purpose of having blockchains in the first place. That's not the way, that's not how we scale blockchain. Okay, so it's all over. We should rage, quit, get jobs in banks. Right? Sorry, Vitalik, I'm sorry. We tried.
00:05:06.560 - 00:05:27.800, Speaker A: No, don't worry. We came up with a concept called the hyperchain. Right? Zk is the end game. We'll get back to this. So the hyperchain essentially consists of two different layers. One is the core and one is something I just wrote for this presentation. It's a framework, a web three framework that ties those cores together.
00:05:27.800 - 00:06:06.226, Speaker A: So let's start at the core, right? And era is actually an l two. That was built on the technologies of our core, right? But every single hyperchain can leverage those same core innovations at the heart of the hyperchain. So anything that is done on era benefits literally every single other hyperchain. And here's some core features. We'll go into these a little bit. The first part is we have unprecedented scale and low fees. So unlike other l two s, evm l two s, we didn't build the virtual machine one to one.
00:06:06.226 - 00:06:47.470, Speaker A: We're not trying to prove every single opcode. We optimize for high performance because we want this to reach mass adoptation, not just like ten people trying to spam transactions at once. We need to make this much more scalable to reach a billion people or more. So with our virtual machine and our technology, you can currently support 100 to 200 transactions per second, depending on the complexity. And that's compared to all the other evml two s of five to 20, maybe. And we have much more incoming in the future because we architected it that way. We do have the lowest fees of any l two, in some cases by up to ten times cheaper.
00:06:47.470 - 00:07:29.574, Speaker A: With validium, not just in l two s, we'll have one of the lowest fees in all of the blockchain industry. If you understand how subsidies, gas subsidies actually work for a Zk prover, you can also run it on consumer grade hardware. So you can run it on a computer with as little as 6gb of gpu RAM. That's just about any laptop at this point. There are some other requirements, but that is impressive. That's actually a couple of days ago we updated a caching layer for that. Unlike other l two s, we don't publish every single transaction onto the network, we publish the delta.
00:07:29.574 - 00:08:04.310, Speaker A: The difference. So if I send you $10, you send me $10, I send you $10, you send me $10, nothing gets updated because I just end up with $10. In the end. If it would have ended up with you, we would have published that one change rather than every single transaction between. So that makes every single transaction cheaper. But it also enables certain things like super high frequency oracle updates, like really high frequency trading, super cheap NFT mints in batches. It allows reoccurring payments like we can do on chain privacy using state diffs.
00:08:04.310 - 00:08:51.366, Speaker A: So another core feature that we have, that other evMl two s don't, is we have native account abstraction, right? And this essentially allows you like if I'm sending you ten USDC, I don't have to even think about what ETH is, I don't have to have any eth on my account. I just pay the fee in USDC and you end up with USDC. And this works on any wallet, including Metamask, any EOA wallet, as well as any smart contract wallet. And then you get some cool other things. With smart contract wallets, like social recovery, you don't have to write down 24 seed words anymore. You can sign a transaction with your iPhone and you can have things like session keys or limits. And I do recommend Clave is over there.
00:08:51.366 - 00:09:06.662, Speaker A: Go get their wallet. Try it. It's fucking beautiful. Sorry, I don't know if I'm supposed to curse. It's really cool. It's really, really cool. With validium soon and porter later, you also get essentially fixed gas costs for transactions.
00:09:06.662 - 00:09:46.006, Speaker A: So right now, the vast majority of your fee for making a transaction is publishing data onto l one instead, we can essentially publish the data somewhere else, use zero knowledge proofs, and then you get more or less a flat trading fee. Regardless of how much ethereum usage goes up, it's always going to be every single transaction, forever. It's actually scalable and sustainable, unlike some other blockchains that subsidy fees, that's the real fee. And we focus on security first, right? It is our number one priority. We spent $6.5 million in audits just on era. Right.
00:09:46.006 - 00:10:47.782, Speaker A: With ZK, you don't have to trust validators, you can just trust the math. And something that we're going to announce here in Denver is also, if there's an implementation bug in ZK, we'll do two factor authentication or multipover using essentially a trusted chip. So even if there's a bug, no one can steal any money from the l two. We are already obsessed with developer tooling, developer experience, but we're going to make a massive push this year to really further it. So we already have foundry, we have remix, we have hard hat, but we have so many other efforts coming this year, I think developers, you'll see a massive difference in using Zksync or any of the hyperchains built on top. So these are like, as a community. I know it's hard to understand, how is one l two different than the other l two? But there's thousands of choices that we make on a day to day basis that compound and it grows and it grows.
00:10:47.782 - 00:11:22.758, Speaker A: We have been building this system with world class experts for five years. Like most of these features that I just mentioned, you can't just slap on another l two. These are fundamental architectural choices that went into building ZK. Sync and it's part of the reason why we really believe this is the most viable solution for mass scale. And so here we have it. The core of every hyperchain there is customization, but it is the core underlying technologies that will enable mass scale. So then comes now, these are separate l two s.
00:11:22.758 - 00:12:00.834, Speaker A: So how do you tie them all together? And that's where Zkstack comes in. That's my products. Think of it as a framework, right? It makes it really easy for you to spin up all the different hyperchains, but it's also the layer in between making essentially interoperability seamless, where you, as a user, don't have to think about it at all. Right? And Zkstack, it's a modular. Okay, good. But it was. Loading is a developer friendly modular framework that makes it really easy for you to deploy and customize hyperchains without having to spend five years rebuilding the technology and 6.5
00:12:00.834 - 00:12:39.834, Speaker A: million in audits and all that. So with Zkstack, you can fully customize a lot, just about everything about your hyperchain, right? You can choose where the data is stored. You can have your own custom gas token. So if you want to launch a token and be the gas, you can do that. You can use different sequencing layers, you can publish the data publicly or keep it private. And there's many, many different changes that you can make to the decisions that era, as l two had. And zkstack essentially makes blockchain future proof.
00:12:39.834 - 00:13:15.900, Speaker A: This is the key to scaling blockchain to mass adoptation and getting it to scale like the Internet does horizontally, essentially, limitlessly. And the key piece there is the interoperability. Right? And that's where the zero knowledge magic comes in. Right? You can't do this without ZK. And if you use ZK, essentially all of these different l two s can communicate to each other in the matter of seconds or minutes, and essentially allows all the different hyperchains to tap into the same users in liquidity. This one might take a bit. It's a video.
00:13:15.900 - 00:13:59.446, Speaker A: Okay, so let's say you have your money on one of these hyperchains, and you have eth there, and you want to swap it for USDC. On any of the other hyperchains. You sign one transaction, it goes there, it swaps it to USDC, for example, and then it returns the money to you, and it's all in one transaction. You don't even have to really think about where your money is, where the Dex is. It just kind of works. And this is the thing that enables this massively scalable, essentially supercomputer, you can abstract away the complexity and you can actually scale essentially limitlessly. Anyone on any chain can interact with any other chain.
00:13:59.446 - 00:14:24.834, Speaker A: You can have hyperchains that use many hyperchains for front end database, something else users. And it can kind of shard itself. You can have dexes that exist in different places. And it makes this similar to the Internet. You plug into your wifi and you can use any server in the world without having to know its ip address. ZK is the end game. This is not a marketing message for us.
00:14:24.834 - 00:14:54.410, Speaker A: We really do believe that this is what enables mass market adoptation of blockchain. And so here's our sort of current hyperchain ecosystem, and here's some examples. So Kronos is launching a hyperchain. They're backed by Crypto.com, with an addressable user market of over 80 million people. We have ZK candy. It's the largest game developer in all of Southeast Asia, as well as New Zealand and Australia.
00:14:54.410 - 00:15:25.598, Speaker A: We have tradable, who's bringing rwas on chain. They're working with partners with over 9 billion in originations. And we have gravity that's building on amazing, essentially decentralized derivatives exchange. And there's so much more I wish I could tell you guys, the people that I talk day to day, we're talking with so many partners that are committing to launch. This is the first time that I'm really excited. It's not anymore. Online casino.
00:15:25.598 - 00:16:17.570, Speaker A: If you saw the partners we're talking today to day, these are mass market adaptation. People are reaching out to us that used to make fun of crypto or not understand the value of decentralization. It is going to get exciting in the next years. And the thing that I think people don't understand about this sort of app chain, hyperchain models, is if you have just one other app chain, it doesn't just grow the network that much. If Kronos comes, brings their users in, liquidity, and the usage of the network goes up, every other hyperchain benefits from that too, right? So every time you launch a new hyperchain, it essentially contributes to exponential growth, not linear growth, right? This is similar to Ethereum. You don't just have one core group of people making applications on Ethereum, it's everyone developing. And the more people develop, the more it grows exponentially.
00:16:17.570 - 00:16:50.560, Speaker A: Everything we do, as matter labs for Zksync or for Zkstack, we follow something called ZK credo. It's our pledge our morals, our values in this ecosystem, to protecting Ethereum, to protecting the user, to keeping the system decentralized, to keeping it from being hijacked. Everything is open source, will be, is, will be, and forever will be. You can always use it. Everything's permissionless. You don't need anyone's permission to launch on this. You don't need anyone's permissions to withdraw your money.
00:16:50.560 - 00:17:18.378, Speaker A: Come play with Zkstack. Like launch onto the hyperchain, you will experience the same exponential growth. You can go to Zkstack, dot IO or scan that and you can start playing with the future today. And it's out today, by the way. So the future is now. I really encourage you to try ZkQuest 2.0. It's a new learning and quest platform.
00:17:18.378 - 00:17:56.390, Speaker A: Every builder here in east Denver, part of the hackathon, can get up to $230 in Ethereum, NFTs, some schwag, and essentially it teaches you about blockchain. It teaches you how ZK sync works. I really encourage you to play around with it. It's super cool. You should follow zksync on Twitter, you'll hear all the updates. And you can also follow me on Twitter x whatever by either scanning that or I'm Zike Lumi and Zike is the end game. This is it.
00:17:56.390 - 00:18:19.000, Speaker A: We figured it out. We're finally scaling blockchain. And please feel free to download this presentation. Do whatever you want to it, share it. This is an exciting time and I think normal people will start understanding or just using blockchain, whether they have to understand it or not. We're at the Epicus. We are about to launch into mass market.
00:18:19.000 - 00:18:20.700, Speaker A: So that's it. Thank you.
