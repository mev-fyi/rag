00:00:00.410 - 00:00:00.958, Speaker A: Hi.
00:00:01.124 - 00:00:24.318, Speaker B: The future of D five panel. All right, I like to. I'm Christine Lee from Coindesk. We have a show, CDTV first mover, 09:00 a.m. And on weekdays eastern time, as well as all about bitcoin. 03:00 at 03:00 p.m. So check us out live, and I want everyone on the panel to say your name and introduce yourself.
00:00:24.484 - 00:00:24.982, Speaker A: Sure.
00:00:25.076 - 00:00:27.240, Speaker B: And tell us a bit about your project.
00:00:28.010 - 00:00:48.202, Speaker C: Hello, everyone. I'm Francesco. I'm one of the founders of Superfluid. We are an asset streaming protocol. So using superfluid, you can create streams of any ErC 20 token. And a lot of teams in the space are using us to pay their contributors, to pay subscriptions, and to do other funky DFI stuff where streams seem to make sense. Yeah.
00:00:48.202 - 00:00:49.420, Speaker C: Thanks for coming, guys.
00:00:50.830 - 00:01:06.754, Speaker D: Hi, everyone. Again, I'm Nikita, the founder of Solace. We're an insurance protocol. Basically, we cover you from exploits, hacks, any technical failures. One policy covers entire DeFi activity. Two clicks. Yeah, I think that covers it all.
00:01:06.952 - 00:01:23.590, Speaker E: Hi, everyone. My name is Vanessa Grille. I'm the head of portfolio growth at Coinfund. We are a multi strategy asset manager. We invest in early stage DeFi projects and other projects. And we also have a hedge fund where we trade tokens and digital assets.
00:01:25.770 - 00:01:47.310, Speaker F: Hey, my name is Andre Anissimov. I'm a core contributor to Siren. This is a protocol for decentralized options. Options is a financial derivative that is getting a lot of traction lately in Defi. And we are building a protocol that allows anyone to launch market on any options, market on any ERC 20 token.
00:01:48.610 - 00:02:00.290, Speaker A: Hi, everyone. I'm Windra. I lead strategy and growth at element. We're a high fixed income protocol. We essentially create, like, fixed rate marketplace for users to buy fixed income in various different assets.
00:02:00.710 - 00:02:11.382, Speaker B: Awesome. Thank you so much. All right, I'm just curious out there. How many of you are newbies to Defi, to Ethereum, to crypto? Any hands?
00:02:11.516 - 00:02:12.200, Speaker A: No?
00:02:12.570 - 00:03:14.086, Speaker B: Okay, so who are at the project level? Developers and advanced and building. And who's in between? Okay, so we see where we're at. All right, so the future of DFI, I would say we had DFI summer in 2020. 2021 was a year of nfts. They say this year 2022 is going to be the year of the Dows, but going to DFI. Since we're talking about DFI, I would say some of the challenges that have been confronted are accessibility. Not everyone out there in the mainstream world really knows how to use and gets lost in the jargon of what decentralized finance is, it's not so inviting or easy to grasp for a new person to use liquidity issues on certain dexes and exploits.
00:03:14.086 - 00:03:51.640, Speaker B: So I guess there's DFI 2.0. And so I wonder, when we talk about the future of DFI, what does that look like to you? And I would start with you, actually, because Nikita. Yeah, because you address the insurance part with all the exploits. I was just looking just this morning, the top three exploits in DFI are all interoperability exploits, such as wormhole, over $300 million hacked polygon or polynetwork. Also hundreds of millions of dollars. And you're supposed to try to find a way to insure them.
00:03:52.970 - 00:04:21.722, Speaker D: Yeah. So the ones that you named are actually where the bridges that got exploited. So that is, like, one of the hotter topics right now, because obviously, we build bunch of chains. Now. We want interoperability. We want to create this one environment where you can use chains as interfaces for all the protocols, so users can get to choose which chain they want to use. But then it introduces a compounding risk, the bridges.
00:04:21.722 - 00:04:29.502, Speaker D: So right now, it is very tough, because if you want to cover back something, you need the underwriting capital.
00:04:29.566 - 00:04:29.794, Speaker F: Right.
00:04:29.832 - 00:05:07.386, Speaker D: So that's kind of the topic I touched on my talk on Wednesday. But then I think the whole issue, we all want interoperability. We all want to create kind of the environment that it's safe. And, for example, Solas is a cross chain protocol. We really use chains as, like, an interface where the settlement happens. But then to hedge the risk of the bridges, we have to develop a little other piece of infrastructure where basically, after bridging the token, you have to unwrap and swap it for the native token. So what we did to hedge the risk.
00:05:07.386 - 00:05:58.640, Speaker D: So, basically, if any of the bridges that we use get hacked, our protocol is not affected, even if you stole some of our bridge tokens, because those are just kind of like a mechanism to transport. But I think right now, the main challenge with the whole coverage exploits, it's just getting underwriting capital and efficiently pull all the risk across all the chains, all the protocol, because that can give you the capital efficiency needed. And so that's what we largely focus on, make sure we pull the risk inside each and every policy. We pull the risk on a chain across the protocols, but we also pull all of that risk cross chain. So that just gives better efficiency and more protection for everyone in the ecosystem because, yeah, I mean, this is kind of like a plague, I think. Nobody likes exploits and getting wrecked and it's so complex. We want the users to have good experience.
00:05:59.410 - 00:06:20.578, Speaker B: So you're the guy to address that issue. When that comes along, you've got your work cut out for you. Francesco, you're doing something really super interesting in terms of giving employers a way to give a daily income stream to people. And maybe in talking about the future of DeFi, how do you see that changing the workplace?
00:06:20.674 - 00:06:45.162, Speaker C: Yeah. So, as I said, with superfluid, you can send streams of money. Right? And the main use case for us at the moment is basically contributor payouts for crypto native companies and daos. And when we talk about the future of DeFi, I think a lot of people imagine even more sophisticated ponzies. What I like to think we'll do is get more of those real cash flows on chain.
00:06:45.226 - 00:06:45.454, Speaker D: Right?
00:06:45.492 - 00:07:13.640, Speaker C: So salaries, contributor payments, but even SaaS subscriptions, b two b payments. And once we get all of this stuff on chain, we can start building commercial financial products, like cash advances, invoice financing. And this is the kind of stuff that, to be honest, is more interesting for me because that actually helps a lot of people to solve real business problems. And that, in my opinion, will bring the next billion people into DeFi. So that's what we are mostly focused on.
00:07:15.130 - 00:07:15.910, Speaker B: What's that?
00:07:15.980 - 00:07:26.966, Speaker D: We could really use that. This is a very nice tool because even us, I think, all the protocols, are having a hard time paying salaries and just doing all the finance on the chain.
00:07:26.998 - 00:07:35.710, Speaker B: So, Francesca, who are the people that are using your service, and how do you extend this to more mainstream adoption?
00:07:36.290 - 00:07:57.538, Speaker C: Well, I'm not going to dox them, but it is crypto native companies. I mean, if you were at the main stage, you would have seen probably a few people that already have their salaries and streams. It is fairly far out. Right. So it's mostly kind of the crypto pioneers who don't mind trying something new. But the way we expand it beyond crypto, I think, is by expanding crypto beyond crypto. Right.
00:07:57.538 - 00:08:18.298, Speaker C: So as I was saying, for me, the moment we can give people advances on their salaries, the moment we can give them mortgages on chain, then it becomes a no brainer to actually use crypto to make those everyday payments that you currently wouldn't even dream of doing. But until the experience on chain is ten x better than the experience with your local bank, you're not going to do it.
00:08:18.464 - 00:08:19.340, Speaker B: All right.
00:08:21.890 - 00:09:11.530, Speaker F: I actually have a very similar opinion in terms of I'm super excited to see more real world use cases that actually impact economic activity in crypto. Instead of pontiff arms and printing money out of thin air and all these things. And so one of the things we're excited to build is because options is essentially a very efficient risk transfer mechanism. So it allows real financial institutions to earn yield by selling risk, real risk, not just printing tokens and selling them. And so I also know that you guys are working on what you're working. There are also lending protocols that lend to real businesses in real countries. And these are use cases that I think are going to explode soon and makes me very excited.
00:09:13.950 - 00:09:14.810, Speaker B: Winter.
00:09:15.410 - 00:10:04.338, Speaker A: Yeah, that's actually super interesting, because we've been thinking about risk the same way, especially in regards to the fixed income market. I think the transfer of risk in terms of yields is going to be something that really takes off in the next couple of months. Not just options, but also if you think about credit lending, there's a risk of default, and someone's going to have to price that properly, and that is room for yield, for somebody to kind of underwrite that risk and essentially just create a new form of markets for these interesting risk, essentially. And when we think about it from a fixed income perspective, how do we still guarantee that the principal is protected? What type of a basket do we have to create to kind of mitigate some of these risks, but still make the yield enticing for users to be able to participate in Defi?
00:10:04.534 - 00:10:10.430, Speaker B: I'm just curious, how many users are you seeing on your platforms and how is that adoption?
00:10:11.490 - 00:10:51.646, Speaker A: We've been fortunate to have pretty good traction on element in terms of fixed income, but most of our users are fairly, especially the ones that buy fixed income. They're fairly risk averse. I would say maybe about 60% to 70% of our users are not defi native. They're mostly either some form of an institution or a really risk averse dow that wants to kind of approach treasury management in a really safe way, or they're effectively defi prime brokers that are interested in creating a product, but just experimenting with some of these primitives to see how to price things, how to construct what the returns are. And so I think those are kind of like our users at the moment.
00:10:51.828 - 00:11:05.538, Speaker B: Vanessa, so you're from coint, a very well known venture firm. So tell me a bit about how when you're making investments and what you see in terms of growth in the space, what are you looking at?
00:11:05.704 - 00:12:05.810, Speaker E: So we see a lot of really interesting trends. I think most of the people here alluded to them. One, bringing real world asset into Defi. Two, managing the risk and I think risk management is going to be the big theme this year because people are going to try to fix the issues that we see, whether in terms of liquidity, whether it's terms of aggregating the risk and exposure, whether it's leverage, trying to find solutions. So I was talking earlier on with a project that's looking at how to manage liquidation risks for stablecoins. So I think that's going to be quick fixes and things that are going to enable the space to grow a lot, because it brings in a lot of comfort for traditional finance intermediaries that are coming into DeFi, trying to assess the overall risk that they're taking when they're engaging with these protocols. So I think that's pretty exciting.
00:12:05.810 - 00:12:56.920, Speaker E: The other trend that we are looking at is really the financialization of nfts and how daos also manage could be leveraging DeFi. So financialization of nfts, we see a lot of new primitives and replication of existing real world primitives, whether it's borrow and lend, whether it's indices or other types of management of collateralized pools of nfts. I think that's pretty exciting because we think the NFT space is going to be even larger than the current cryptocurrency space, because you're going to be able to replicate real world assets and represent them with nfts and really create structured products and other types of products on top of it.
00:12:58.650 - 00:13:34.074, Speaker B: I wonder, there's kind of this debate going on in the transition from web two to web 3.0 about whether or not the current tech incumbents will just carry on their ways of centralization and bring that ethos into web3 when you're making investments, but you're a vc as well. So the vcs have been criticized for having all the money and putting in and having perhaps undue influence on the space, according to Jack Dorsey. I wonder your perspective.
00:13:34.122 - 00:14:14.570, Speaker E: I think it really depends on your perspective. As a vc, we've been investing since 2015, so we're pretty crypto native and we're really focused on decentralization. I think we understand the value. We understand that it might be costly at first, but on the security and sustainability that decentralization brings and creates is what is world changing. And so now we see a lot of vcs that are more traditional vcs or more traditional asset allocators coming in and maybe not having that perspective. So it's really important for us to support the project from the get go. We're very early stage investors.
00:14:14.570 - 00:14:26.450, Speaker E: We provide the initial funding for founders and teams to create decentralized protocols, and for us to just be sort of initiating that movement.
00:14:27.670 - 00:14:40.402, Speaker B: Andre, I'm curious about adoption on your platform. Where are you seeing that happening regionally? And how do you expect to make this more adaptable to mainstream audiences?
00:14:40.546 - 00:15:31.110, Speaker F: Yeah, so in our case, because the market is so young, pretty much a year ago, nobody almost knew about options. The main challenges to grow this market is the infrastructure itself, which is all we all dependent on, that is underlying networks to make transactions cheaper and make it easier to interact. The wallet infrastructure, all this stuff. But in terms of specifically, our protocol is liquidity. So it's more institutions willing to participate in this market, inject more liquidity, making these markets more available with better pricing. And we see a lot of really good trends in that regard on our protocol. Some institutions already systematically buying options, and they're constantly growing the volumes.
00:15:31.110 - 00:15:55.806, Speaker F: And another thing is users, just the end users who simply traders who want to take risks and trade options. And there, I think it's still very early there because it's a derivative, it's a bit of a complex instrument, so it takes some time for people to catch up. But we know that in traditional finance, options are very popular, and it's just a matter of time on building out.
00:15:55.828 - 00:16:50.094, Speaker D: The infrastructure to enable that here, just hitting off that. I think also options are generally complex and inaccessible to a wider population, because then how many trade options in the traditional finance? Like very few. And then the crypto crowd is smaller. And I think what we've been thinking a bit is wrapping a bunch of options into these easy to use strategies for the people, because we build these cool defi tools for anyone to use right in open fashion. But then with the lack of education, people might not know how to properly utilize them. And I think it's our kind of responsibility since we're giving them access to it, also help them to use that, because then we were looking maybe how to hedge impermanent loss. And with a bunch of different options, you can actually hedge certain price ranges of the tokens fairly well.
00:16:50.094 - 00:17:05.842, Speaker D: It tracks even though options are linear tools, but impermanent loss is like a quadratic thing. But I think there was a lot of opportunity to build these kind of like packaged products that utilize options there. I don't know if you guys have thought about it.
00:17:05.896 - 00:17:23.626, Speaker F: Yeah, I was just going to quickly add on that. I think that's the most exciting thing. It's like once we build the base protocols, the next is composability. It's like, what are all these exciting things that people can build on top, because in traditional finance, it's not as easy to build on top of other financial institutions. But DeFi is all about that, so totally agree with that.
00:17:23.648 - 00:17:25.500, Speaker D: Yeah, no, I'm in this exciting world.
00:17:25.870 - 00:17:27.900, Speaker B: Windrew, you want to add to that?
00:17:28.830 - 00:18:12.570, Speaker A: Yeah, I'll add a little bit onto that. I think they talked about automated option strategies quite a bit. Kind of just goes back into the pricing of risk situation in terms of what's going on in DFI right now. If you see automated vault option for option strategies at the moment, they yield anywhere between 20% to 30% APY, and you think that's extremely attractive. But the people that really make money on those specific vaults are people counter trading against it because the risks aren't actually priced very efficiently. So now you're starting to see vaults, automated vaults, counter trading against the option vaults because they're making more money. But also another situation or scenario of arbitrage is if you participate in some of these auctions to purchase the options.
00:18:12.570 - 00:18:40.130, Speaker A: Like for example, last Friday, Ribbon had an options auction. Each option was going for $9 each and on derabit they're $40. So there's like this massive arbitrage between decentralized options protocols and the way they're selling options to some of the centralized, more liquid ones. So there's so many different opportunities for yields on the option side. I think it's going to take some time, but when people start to really optimize the risk, you're going to see some really efficient markets.
00:18:40.870 - 00:18:47.302, Speaker B: And I am curious though regionally, where are you seeing the most activity? Do you have a sense of where your users are?
00:18:47.436 - 00:19:18.800, Speaker A: For us on element, it's mostly, well, since we have a lot more institutions probably in the US, that's where we get a lot of interest from. They are relatively larger size of purchases for fixed income, but we're always looking to explore on the product side how we can kind of make our products a lot more appealing. Removing layers of abstract away layers of complexity to, like I said, encourage distribution to be a lot simpler and for people to understand what we do a little bit better.
00:19:20.690 - 00:19:42.998, Speaker F: In terms of geographic distribution. It's a bit harder to track in crypto because some of the projects, they have geographic restrictions on their user interfaces, for example, like us, and we don't really have a good way to track people and it's defy, all you know is their address and you don't know if they use VPN or anything like that.
00:19:43.164 - 00:19:47.334, Speaker B: Right. And is it the same for issue for you guys.
00:19:47.452 - 00:20:13.566, Speaker D: I mean, we're open for anyone or any country to use, but, yeah, I think we've seen the most users from western world, like Europe and the US, and that's where the most team is spread out. So I think maybe that affects it. But we do have users, like in Africa and Asia. I think we covered every single country with at least one user by now, which is kind of fun to see the map. But, yeah, most of the people coming from the US and Europe.
00:20:13.678 - 00:20:33.430, Speaker B: I ask because DeFi is in a bit of a regulatory gray area. In the United States, we have the SEC chair, Gary Genzler, looking at DeFi, investigating Uniswap, and trying to figure know how decentralized are these entities. And so what are your thoughts on regulation?
00:20:35.530 - 00:21:15.880, Speaker D: We need some smart regulation, I think. I mean, right now, we all operate kind of like in a gray area. We try to hedge our own risk, the risk of our protocols from regulatory scrutiny. I don't think any of us here are trying to screw anyone over. We're just, like, innovating and building. And I think regulators should just listen to us a little more sometimes because we don't want to be in an adversary position. Obviously, there are tons of scams in these rug pools and all that, but I think we also need to focus as protocols on being self regulatory, because I don't think we can really.
00:21:15.880 - 00:21:46.240, Speaker D: You cannot put one single protocol in a box of a single country's jurisdiction anymore, really. And the world is way more intertwined nowadays. So I think we have a very unique chance as a new industry to establish what's good, what's bad, how we are operating, and we should be proactive with regulators and helping them out, because they're also good people. They're not really there to fuck us over or anything.
00:21:47.570 - 00:21:50.030, Speaker B: Vanessa, you wanted to add to that?
00:21:50.180 - 00:23:05.830, Speaker E: Yeah. I think for some players to engage with DeFi and DeFi protocols, which are really just open source protocols, there is an amount of regulatory constraints that they have. So you see projects like Aave, Metamask, paraswap, starting to offer sort of gated access for institutions where they have access to pools of liquidity that are KYC'd and that give comfort to larger institutions that they can trade in those pools. I would say that most of the projects we work with are very diligent in terms of regulation. They want to do the right thing, and they are creating access or limiting access. You saw that one inch, for example, limited access to us citizens, et cetera, just to make sure that they take all the measures that are necessary to ensure that they don't have us citizens trading on their platform. That being said, people are using vpns.
00:23:05.830 - 00:23:26.910, Speaker E: There's things that they cannot control. And that's something I think the regulators should focus on, the bad actors, and there are plenty, and work with the industry to find some solutions and some maybe self regulated solutions or at least some workable solutions for these projects.
00:23:33.900 - 00:24:33.390, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess another subject I wanted to touch on was anonymity in DeFi. And your thoughts on that? Because on the one hand, we have something like Wonderland Dow, where one of the co founders was doxed and was revealed to be a serial con man who was also co founder of CX. Michael Petrin, also known as Omar Patrin, also known as. So that kind know was disturbing to everyone and kind of made everyone pause and think about the benefits and non benefits of anonymity in DeFi. But then you also have NFT projects like the board, Ape Yacht Club, and the co founders were docs, and everyone just thought that was totally wrong. So I guess in thinking of anonymity and its role plays in DeFi, what are some of your thoughts on that?
00:24:35.120 - 00:25:56.280, Speaker D: I think that kind of also hits the regulations a little bit. But my personal belief is that anonymity and privacy is extremely important, because when we give out our passports, information to all these companies and all that, most don't really know how to manage. I think we need to create efficient tools and fallback mechanisms, but then at the same time with regulations. And as Vanessa said, we also need to create these frameworks for governments to operate with DeFi and crypto, kind of like interfaces, like Ave arc, for example. Because I think a lot of institutions also want to start using all these tools. And at that layer, I think it's okay to maybe have KYC or AML measures, but I think generally, if you want to preserve your privacy, I think it's like a very fundamental right that I think we have to preserve on a protocol layer, at least, so it is more interoperable, composable, and kind of like creates a more united world because every country has their laws, their restrictions, all of that. But I think it creates a more efficient world and just like a happier place for everyone to be when we can work together without all these restrictions.
00:25:56.700 - 00:27:04.152, Speaker F: Yeah. Finally, in terms of the anonymity of the founding teams, it creates very interesting dynamic because it allows individuals who are known to be not very honest people, to repeatedly start new companies under different identities. And how are we going to solve it. And I think one of the solution is economic solution is something like insurance. If it becomes common for lps to purchase insurance to protect their accounts, then the insurance providers will be able to curate lists of trusted protocols that, based on their research and due diligence into the founders identities, et cetera, and will provide sort of this economic incentive for sort of the self curation mechanism that will let regular people access only the filtered subset of DeFi that is safe to interact with. So I believe more in solutions like that versus some kind of regulatory, especially based in a single country of the US. DeFi is a global phenomena.
00:27:04.152 - 00:27:06.510, Speaker F: Us alone cannot regulate it.
00:27:07.360 - 00:27:21.328, Speaker D: We actually do like when we put all the data in a risk pipeline and evaluate protocols, or the ecosystem, we do. Look, whether it's like pure anon teams or they're actual people behind the project.
00:27:21.414 - 00:27:24.370, Speaker B: Because then how do you weigh that?
00:27:24.740 - 00:27:41.240, Speaker D: I mean, there are multiple ways, technically, but the simplest way is just to create a flag, a variable, like if the team is docs or. No, it can be binary. That's already like, if you agree, a lot of this can help you to gauge the risk. But, yeah, I mean, that's why I'm doxxed.
00:27:41.740 - 00:27:47.000, Speaker B: Vanessa, when you're investing in projects, is that something you take into consideration?
00:27:47.080 - 00:28:31.496, Speaker E: Totally. And I think it's something we should, as a collective, think about in terms of the context of governance of projects and control, because you can have anonymous contributors, but when you have a founder that controls a majority of the tokens or the votes in the governance, that's where you get into trouble. And so we should think about, as an industry, how to approach this and what could be best practices to maintain this anonymity and privacy and make it possible, but also have some safeguards around it.
00:28:31.678 - 00:29:15.892, Speaker A: So at element, some of our protocol partners are fully anonymous. But I think what's really cool about Defi, and just web3 in general, is that code is law. So you're able to kind of look at the code on chain and see where the points of failures are and kind of assess it yourself. You mentioned Wonderland and Danielle and Sifu and everything. And the due diligence didn't happen until he was doxxed. But you could have seen on chain that there was one guy that had control to $400 million, and nobody looked into it until it was kind of brought into the spotlight. So I think, imagine if you wanted to do your due diligence on Wonderland at the beginning, you would have seen that this one guy has control $400 million, and you would want to know who he is.
00:29:15.892 - 00:29:36.204, Speaker A: So when we do our due diligence in terms of working with partners, even if they're anonymous, we look at the code, we look at who can make decisions on moving funds, how our strategy is created, and so forth. And so far, I think if you approach due diligence in that way, I think it's, regardless of who you work with, I think the code kind of speaks for itself.
00:29:36.402 - 00:30:18.488, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that's the beauty of the whole defi. When we work with other protocols to open any partnership or vaults or whether farms or LP pools, there are always ways, even though we sometimes maybe have to send tokens there and there, we check the code, and it's always like we are 100% certain that even if, let's say we just had a farm with tricellaris on Aurora, they did all the infrastructure, but they have no access to it. So when we deposit the rewards or do all these kinds of things, there's no trust involved. So I think that that's very important. And the whole Defi is composable, is beautiful.
00:30:18.574 - 00:30:36.176, Speaker B: All right, I'm being told we got to end it there, but really cool panel. Really great discussion. It's really great to see you guys in the flesh and really flesh out through these challenges, and you're the good actors trying to figure it all out, so it's great to see you and talk to everyone at the best.
00:30:36.198 - 00:30:36.896, Speaker E: Thank you.
00:30:37.078 - 00:30:37.550, Speaker C: Thank you.
