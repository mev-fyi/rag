00:00:00.890 - 00:00:01.598, Speaker A: Almost done.
00:00:01.684 - 00:00:03.022, Speaker B: That was exciting stuff here.
00:00:03.076 - 00:00:07.934, Speaker A: Slide over. Almost done. Almost done.
00:00:08.052 - 00:00:08.494, Speaker B: One more.
00:00:08.532 - 00:00:11.630, Speaker A: This is it. Y'all excited for Vitalik?
00:00:15.810 - 00:00:30.230, Speaker B: We'll try to make this short and sweet for you so we can get to the main course here. So we're here to talk about the buffcorn Biddle Brigade. How many of you have a b? Three. That's a lot of hands.
00:00:30.300 - 00:00:41.500, Speaker A: How many have more than one? Wait, do I hear a whale? I got a 40 spot. I heard it. You hear it.
00:00:45.920 - 00:01:27.370, Speaker B: So just a little bit about myself. I got my start here at ETH Denver. I was actually working at consensus and then fell down the web three rabbit hole at ethnver 2020. I'm also the treasurer of Spork Dow. And I wanted to say that because a lot of you have not claimed spork that you earned in 2018, 1920 or 21, and you have until March 27 to claim it. You can go to this link that's on the screen behind me, eatdenver, linkdrop dot IO, and put in the email address that you use to apply to eat Denver. Most people apply with many different email addresses and so you just try a bunch until you figure out which one that works.
00:01:27.370 - 00:02:00.950, Speaker B: I put up some of my hobbies and this is my buffacorn, and he's got a Goyaki, same as me. So what is the buffcorn Biddle Brigade? We did a ten k NFT project because a lot of these NFT projects were springing up and communities were forming around them and we already had this really great community and we wanted to add a little bit of value for.
00:02:02.200 - 00:02:37.570, Speaker A: Yeah, it's been a long day, so we're big on experimentation and positive sum games. You've heard me say this a billion times. So creating the NFT project was about experimenting with that. How do you create value for the community in the form of selling pfps, which actually create sustainability and of economics, but also then creating value around the art, the meme of the buffacorn, which is the strength of the buffalo and the magic of the unicorn and actually making it fun, right. And then layering in a bunch of things of utility. It's really cool project.
00:02:38.340 - 00:02:44.304, Speaker B: And one of the great things is so Sergio Ordonias, I want to call him out, has been doing the art.
00:02:44.342 - 00:02:50.576, Speaker A: Since the Sergio here. We've been looking for him. He's like genius artist gal.
00:02:50.608 - 00:02:51.876, Speaker B: Sergio, you here?
00:02:52.058 - 00:03:38.880, Speaker A: If Sergio is here, we're calling him to the main stage. Sergio actually created the Buffacorn art in the fall of 2017 when I sent him a picture and said, hey, we got this meme we want to create. Can you help me design this? And he's been doing the original Buffacorn art since then, so he's been our original artist. It's been fabulous to see. And honestly, the coolest part, he went from literally being a starving artist to now this project has made it so that he can work in web three full time. And he's actually got complete and total control over his art and creativity. The ownership economy in real life, positive some games.
00:03:38.960 - 00:04:15.920, Speaker B: So some of the benefits to holding one of these pfps, you get access to rare swag throughout the year. You got priority access to ethnic if you applied on time, obviously, there's nothing we can do if you apply super late. There are three different tiers. So if you have a rarity that's in the top 500, that's tier one. We did a drop over Thanksgiving for Spork. If you had a top tier, you got 50 to 80 spork, which is the same amount, a little bit more as if you had just attended one of the e Denver's. And then if you have more than 20 or 20 or more, you get access to a special discord channel.
00:04:15.920 - 00:04:18.050, Speaker B: And there will be some other things.
00:04:18.580 - 00:04:19.740, Speaker A: Spork whale.
00:04:19.900 - 00:05:07.296, Speaker B: Spork whale. Okay, so what you guys are here to listen to and not at all, because Vitalik's on nest. You guys showed up to hear this, right? So we've got five points that we wanted to talk about that we'd like to accomplish before ETH Denver 2023. The first one is sponsored t shirts, so this won't affect the rarity. But as part of the sponsorship of ETH Denver for 2022, we included custom shirts that were to go on the buffacorns. Because we released the buffcorn PFPs before the sponsorships were all done, we had to do it retroactively. Here are your presenting sponsors, and here are all of them.
00:05:07.296 - 00:05:51.692, Speaker B: This is presenting and cipher sponsors who got custom shirts. And so what we realized was, if we could do this and we could retroactively add these custom t shirts to the buffacorns, we could probably do more of that. And so we jump into the second step on our roadmap, which is manual trade swapping. So let's say I want very badly the Colorado jam t shirt, the gray one, which is one of my favorite shirts. But I've got the astronaut, the spacesuit. I can find somebody who has the Colorado jam shirt, and I can trade with them. So we're going to do a beta in the discord where you find another person, you agree on it.
00:05:51.692 - 00:06:28.984, Speaker B: It'll probably be something nominal, like 100 Spork. So both of you put 100 spork together and we'll have our buffagod, who's one of our devs, do the swap. And so your PFP would then have my spacesuit, and I will have your Colorado GM shirt, which why stop there. This leads us to step three. We're going to build out actual smart contracts that do this on chain instead of having to be done manually. But you have to start somewhere. So we're going to do some small manual beta tests, and then we're going to grow to doing all of the traits except for two of them.
00:06:28.984 - 00:06:59.510, Speaker B: So two of the traits will never be able to change. This is part of the be the buffacorn meme. It's all about memes, right? You can change your setting, you can change what you're eating, you can change your clothes, you can change lots of things, but you cannot change your fur, and you cannot change your horns. Your horns are yours forever. Is there anything you want to say on that? No. Okay. Yeah.
00:06:59.510 - 00:07:36.400, Speaker B: Is anybody excited about this idea? Yeah. Oh, good. You need to swap your background. This guy in the front is looking for a swap background so you can go into the discord and try to find somebody who wants to swap a background with you. Which leads us to step number four on the roadmap. And this is nfTs, everybody's favorite thing, right? When you bought merch through metafactory, which I can see a lot of you who've definitely bought merch through metafactory, we have a bunch of these rare shirts. They all come with NFT wearables that you'll be able to take with your Ethereum address through the metaverse.
00:07:36.400 - 00:08:12.380, Speaker B: In addition to that, you're also going to be able to mint the traits that you have on your buffacorn as wearables. So let's say your buffcorn has a cowboy hat. You'll be able to mint a cowboy hat wearable, and maybe you don't like it and it's not good for you anymore, you can put it up for sale. This was inspired by the Avagatchi bazaar, which I'm a big fan of avagatchi. So there's some inspiration there. And this brings us to our last and most exciting piece on the roadmap. We're going to introduce breeding.
00:08:12.380 - 00:08:32.050, Speaker B: So this is the year of the gwE, and so we're going to try to expand on the year of the gwe. So how are buffague formed? Well, when two buffacorns love each other very much. Wait, can I talk about. It's okay, right?
00:08:32.820 - 00:08:34.880, Speaker A: It's an ethereum conference. You could do it.
00:08:34.950 - 00:08:35.570, Speaker B: Okay.
00:08:35.940 - 00:08:36.304, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:08:36.342 - 00:08:52.970, Speaker B: So all of this will be up for governance. The decisions on these things are not being made by myself or John or just the stewards. The spork that you have is a governance token, and a lot of these things are going to be up for votes. So I'd like you to.
00:08:54.700 - 00:08:56.148, Speaker A: Participate in the discord.
00:08:56.244 - 00:09:15.496, Speaker B: Yes, participate in the discord. We'll be putting up forum posts. Some things that I do want to mention is that there will be a limited breed number, so there won't be unlimited buffague. That's a nice idea. They're not going to be mintable. They will only be born, and they're going to inherit traits from both the parent buffacorns.
00:09:15.528 - 00:09:16.756, Speaker A: Parent buff corns.
00:09:16.888 - 00:09:41.336, Speaker B: Yes. So that is our roadmap to 2023. So, like we just said, keep an eye out on the discord and the forums. You're going to be able to vote with your spork. And I've already seen some really cool tools that you can. If you're here, you can give yourself a shout out. There's this little game where it's like a buffcorn against buffcorn fighting thing.
00:09:41.336 - 00:09:48.090, Speaker B: It's really cool. And I'm excited about all the other things that are being developed for the buffcorns. So that is us.
00:09:49.660 - 00:10:06.876, Speaker A: Okay. All right. And if you're bored, go to open sea or wearable and sweep the floor. If you got nothing to do at 02:00 a.m. It helps the community, and that's all we have to say about that. So a lot more to come in the discord. Get your buffacorns.
00:10:06.876 - 00:10:29.444, Speaker A: If you don't know, there's two private lounges that are buffacorn Biddle Brigade only. One at the Colorado History Museum, one at Jonas Gallery, powered by near, so you can go in. There's like food and drinks and chill spaces and hacking spaces, but you can only get in if you have one of these. So don't try if you don't, even if you're spork whale, you can't get in.
00:10:29.562 - 00:10:41.464, Speaker B: One last thing. I'd notice that the buffcorns do help support the community. Does anybody know how much a general admission ticket to eat Denver costs? Nothing free, and we'd like to keep it that way.
00:10:41.662 - 00:11:12.896, Speaker A: Right? So we will continue to create utility and value for the community by giving you opportunity to, in a way, participate in the value creation. By owning these assets and creating the ability for us to have the pathway to maintain free admission, free food, free swag, free everything. And make sure that our community continues to be healthy, vibrant and grow to, let's say, I don't know, 25,000 people next year. Yeah, why not? Okay.
00:11:12.998 - 00:11:13.520, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:11:13.590 - 00:11:14.030, Speaker A: Thanks, everybody.
