00:00:18.750 - 00:00:37.704, Speaker A: You. Great. All right. Hi, everyone. Can you guys hear me all right? All right, let's get started. Need this a little bit closer. All right, good sound check.
00:00:37.704 - 00:01:16.504, Speaker A: Okay. Hi, everyone. Welcome to this talk. We're going to be covering a very important topic, and it'll be your get out of jail free because it actually is a topic and an issue and a concern in the crypto community that could end up with a five year jail penalty. So we're talking about the 650 I reporting requirements that the IRS was going to put into effect in 2024. We got a little bit of a stay of execution on that as I'll get into more in my presentation. But again, we're talking today about the 650 I reporting requirement on any crypto transaction over ten k in value.
00:01:16.504 - 00:02:10.228, Speaker A: So I'm Amy Kalnoki, co founder and COO of Bitways, the leading digital asset accounting, bookkeeping, tax tracking and red rec platform. So today, again, we're covering 650 I what the rule actually says, potential places where it might apply to crypto transactions, the issues and the ambiguity around how we'll actually be able to comply with this, because form 8300 requires a lot of information that might not be available to you if you're on the receiving end of a ten k crypto transaction. And brainstorm some ways the community can help comply with this and address this and what kind of is going on currently. So first, a little disclaimer. Of course, this is not a replacement for any sort of legal or tax advice. This is not financial advice. This is really just educational.
00:02:10.228 - 00:03:01.464, Speaker A: And as you'll see, the original date was to start in 2024, but the IRS has actually delayed that until further clarity and regulatory guidance can be figured out. So none of this is decided for sure, exactly the type of transactions that. There you go, little light show, but exactly how it's going to apply to the crypto industry. So, first, just to catch up, why is this going on? I mean, obviously, everyone's feeling good about the blockchain industry at the moment. Every single large company is thinking about it. We have the ETF and institutions, and you see all the great builders here at the conference today. And with that growth in the industry comes additional scrutiny from regulators, which is a good thing.
00:03:01.464 - 00:03:44.248, Speaker A: I don't think that we can really see mass adoptions for businesses or individuals using crypto without really great guidance and regulatory clarity. But what the IRS is trying to do at the moment is it's a little bit of a round peg in a square peg in a round hole situation. They're applying a framework for most 40 year old law to the modern crypto economy, and it just doesn't fit. And we'll get into all the reasons why it really just does not fit for the moment we are right now. So I've already used a couple of terms, but I just want to clarify a few things. So I'm talking about rule 650 I. That's the rule, and form 8300.
00:03:44.248 - 00:04:54.524, Speaker A: So you'll hear me use both of those things, but just so you can keep it in your mind, the provision, the rule is 60 50 I, and the form that is required by that is 8300. All right, let's go back in time. So this originally happened in 1984, and it actually was controversial from the beginning. But what it says is any individual involved in trade or business that gets more than $10,000 in cash in a single or related series of transactions must report that to the IRS within 15 days on form 8300. And so what's changed? Actually, part of the infrastructure bill from a few years ago, the same one that included the broker dealer rules that were very controversial and didn't really make a lot of sense or unclear for the crypto industry. It also included updating crypto transactions in that definition of cash. And if you think about it, in 1984, if you were making a business transaction or any sort of transaction with ten k in cash, that is a big stack of money.
00:04:54.524 - 00:05:46.060, Speaker A: And actually inflation adjusted, I looked it up yesterday, that was about $30,000, equivalent to today's dollars in 1980, $4. So think about just like walking around with big stack of cash. It was likely, or maybe more likely than other types of transactions to be a little shady. And so perhaps it made a little bit of sense that the IRS would want to have you report on why you were just walking around with a big stack of cash to do business transactions. Because even in 1984, people were doing wires and achs and writing checks. Perhaps it made a little bit of sense, but you fast forward now to the digital asset economy, and you can think of all the different types of transactions in the crypto world, purchasing, nfts, mining or staking rewards, airdrops, you name it. It's quite reasonable and quite normal to have a transaction.
00:05:46.060 - 00:06:40.530, Speaker A: Sorry for that technical stuff, a transaction that is over $10,000. And so the only kind of good part in my mind is that this is actually the first time a regulator or an agency or someone has recognized the value of cash. I'm sorry, the value of crypto as a means of exchange. And so it is great to see that there is recognition that there is value in exchange and that it is like cash. But it also shows that there's still misconception that people might think the primary use case of a crypto or digital asset transaction is somehow to fund some sort of illegal or illicit activity. So what does the rule actually say? So the threshold is ten k, like I've said, and I've used the term series of related transactions. That's actually very important.
00:06:40.530 - 00:07:22.088, Speaker A: So it's ten k or cumulative series of transactions. You can just imagine some sort of like a dGEN thinking like, okay, I'm going to do one 9999 transaction and then wrote dollar transaction, and it's not going to trigger a form 8300. That's not the case. So if it's reasonable that this series of transactions is a related business, they are grouped together, so not four, $2,500 can't get around it. Cumulative value of ten K compliance. For this, it's not just a little form. It's actually, like I mentioned at the top of the presentation, it can carry up to a five year jail sentence for non compliance.
00:07:22.088 - 00:08:25.440, Speaker A: So it is really important that once the rule does go into place, in whatever form, the IRS has the final version that you do comply, because it can be a fine of up to $2,500 for the first time, or $100,000 for multiple and up to a five year jail sentence and so on. It the timeline, 15 days. That's actually a very quick timeline. So from the point of transaction, you have 15 days to file 8300. Here's the kicker for the crypto industry. The form in its current iteration requires things like the Social Security number or tin for the sender, things like the physical address, of course, the amount and nature of the transaction date, things like that, but a lot of things that might not be readily available to you when you're doing a crypto transaction. And so again, this is why we're trying to apply a framework that really just doesn't make sense because you might not have the details that are required for the form, and that's pretty normal in a crypto transaction.
00:08:25.440 - 00:09:16.896, Speaker A: It was supposed to go into effect in January because of all the confusion and the basically inability for the current state of us to be able to comply with it. It has been delayed, so we are waiting on the final version. But staking rewards, you don't get a w nine from a blockchain. How are we going to address these things in the crypto industry? Like I said, it hasn't gone to effect, and we'll brainstorm a few ways that the industry can address it. So where will it apply? Also to be determined, likely it will be applied to any receipt of goods or services. So if you're getting paid in crypto, will likely trigger it. If you're getting token compensation or something like that for more than ten k, likely trigger it.
00:09:16.896 - 00:09:44.344, Speaker A: Again, we don't know. This is speculative at this point till the final version comes out. Node validator activity, staking rewards certainly sales of NFTs or ICO kind of tokens or any sort of token sale. I think it will probably apply airdrops as well. If you're on the receiving end of something more than ten k, it could. The one that I think is most unclear is whether just regular crypto trading activity will apply to it. We don't know.
00:09:44.344 - 00:11:05.270, Speaker A: We'll have to wait and see. What can you do now? I would recommend being proactive and being very careful and detailed on your tracking your transactions, so that when the rule does go into place, you have accurate records that you've kept and you know, and you have a good process in place for maintaining these records. Folks in the audience who do like retail trading, I'm sure something like a coin tracker on the realtor side will help you pull and categorize and organize your transactions. Certainly on the business side at bitwave, we can help with that as well. But accurate record keeping of where the transactions are coming from and the value, the fair market value at the time you receive them is really important to get ready for this rule going into effect. Airdrops, like I said, I think that's a really great example of why it doesn't make sense in its current form, because you might not have any of the details required for form 8300 when you get an airdrop, but you could have a lot of value if you think a few years back to the Uniswap, Airdrop people made a significant, some people made a significant amount of money, but the details required for the form were not available to them. So there are a lot of great efforts within the crypto community to advocate for the clarity that we need.
00:11:05.270 - 00:12:17.688, Speaker A: I think if we do do things like publicly posting Wdizer or things that could help people proactively fill out the form, but I think we do need to really talk and explain why it's difficult to comply in its current form with the way people function and do crypto transactions and things like that. It's a big privacy issue, I think, actually finding people's wallets, certainly getting their names and addresses. And it's not like banks. And so I've said it's really a 40 year old framework that doesn't fit into the current regulation. And actually coin center is suing the treasury over this and they consider it unconstitutional because people were not banks. So in its original form, you think about the folks who had to file the things like that. It was more financial institutions than banks, and it was found that banks should have to have this requirement, and partially because they get special access to the Federal Reserve.
00:12:17.688 - 00:13:05.064, Speaker A: And then it was therefore thought that they had additional burden to be able to ensure that USD, the dollar is not used for illegal activities. So I guess you can get there from a privacy perspective, that the trade off for the banks and the burden of collecting all this information on any sort of ten K transaction makes sense. They're extension of the Federal Reserve and the government, but we are not people are not the same burden. Doesn't really make sense. Like I shouldn't have to know your Social Security number. When we do a normal business transaction, there's unreasonable burden on us and it is a privacy concern for folks. Again, I'm Amy from bitwave.
00:13:05.064 - 00:14:20.620, Speaker A: We do digital asset accounting, bookkeeping and tax tracking. And I'm happy to take any questions. Anyone have any questions? Do people generally agree that it is an undue burden or the complexity of filling out a form at this time would be untenable? I mean, I'm seeing a lot of nods at a lot of heads. So again, I really think you should write your congressman or work with one of the groups who are advocating. Certainly in the accounting world, there are a lot of people who are trying to explain why it is a proposed regulation that just doesn't make sense and is, quite frankly, perhaps even unfair, because there are so many reasons why a ten K transaction is for very normal and legitimate business purposes, and getting the required information is just a real hurdle for the growth of the industry and very normal payment rails in the crypto economy. So I think maybe I saw a question up there.
00:14:35.190 - 00:14:36.066, Speaker B: Quick question.
00:14:36.168 - 00:14:36.820, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:14:37.670 - 00:14:46.310, Speaker B: If that applies that the rule goes in effect, when does that apply on the reporting on the current tax year or previous year?
00:14:46.380 - 00:15:26.610, Speaker A: You have to file it within 15 days of the transaction. So once it goes to, in effect, the very next time you have a ten K transaction or a series of related transactions that sum up more than ten K, you have 15 days to file form 8300. That's the current framework and that's how it is right now. So if you right now went and bought a car for ten K in cash, somebody is going to file an 8300, like the car dealership is going to do that. And so, yeah, once it goes into effect, you have that 15 day timeline. That's currently how it's written. Yeah.
00:15:26.610 - 00:15:27.300, Speaker A: Hi.
00:15:27.830 - 00:15:56.806, Speaker C: Thank you so much for doing this talk. Just to touch on what you said before on what can we do to help those that are making this decision of wanting us to fill out this form understand that maybe this isn't necessarily a viable option for things like airdrops and these nuances that happen only in the crypto industry as opposed to cash specifically.
00:15:56.918 - 00:16:57.402, Speaker A: Yeah. I think explaining why perhaps digital asset transactions are more like a credit card transaction or wire or an ACH, that there is that tracking and documentation that it's not just totally anonymous, like dropping a sack of cash off, is that there are ways to track these and explaining to folks outside of the industry why it's a very normal thing to receive a $10,000 bitcoin payment for your business, for consulting services, or for mining rewards if you're part of a large pool for something that. So I think both. Explaining why it's very common to have ten k plus transactions and the ways that it is traceable and trackable while still maintaining privacy. I think that's really important because I think people outside the industry, they just don't understand. They think we're so decentralized that it is just like a random bag of cash and it's really not. There are ways to track and to have your public addresses and not your name and address and physical location.
00:16:57.402 - 00:17:00.560, Speaker A: Doesn't make sense. Yeah. Thank you.
00:17:04.210 - 00:17:18.642, Speaker B: Thanks for the presentation. Kim late, but anyway, so question. Let's say heck with this form. I'm not going to fill out. I'm not going to do nothing about it. Say, hey, doesn't apply to me. I don't believe in it.
00:17:18.642 - 00:17:21.878, Speaker B: Have a nice day. So what's going to happen? What's really going to happen?
00:17:21.964 - 00:17:50.094, Speaker A: I think you said airdrop. Sorry, I'm having just a little hard time. But yeah. What if you just get an airdrop? That's one of the things that's really unclear. Like if you just receive something that you didn't ask for. I don't know. That's one of the things that really does need to be clarified because how can you possibly get the details that are required for the form if you didn't even ask for the ten k airdrop and you have no idea who the sender is other than the wallet that it came from.
00:17:50.212 - 00:18:11.206, Speaker B: Okay, so let's say I receive something and I just disregard everything. I don't comply with, filling out any forms or anything. I don't care what's going to really happen, what kind of, I don't know, physical things, it can happen to me or not, or is this just a bunch of dust fairy kind of thing?
00:18:11.308 - 00:18:40.080, Speaker A: So the way it is right now, and again, the IRS did put a pause on it while they figured out a lot of this complexity, because that's a great example. Like, if in the current way it's written 15 days, you have to comply or you could have the penalties. Right. What are you to do? And so that is, I think, one of the reasons why we have this delay in it actually being rolled out from the original timeline that was outlined in the infrastructure bill. Thank you.
00:18:42.130 - 00:18:54.574, Speaker B: Sorry. So this is just for United States. Do you know of any other countries in this world who actually are trying to do this, done this, been doing it, or is actually happening somewhere else in any other countries?
00:18:54.702 - 00:18:58.840, Speaker A: I don't have the details for other countries. Sorry. I just know about this one.
00:19:00.730 - 00:19:13.834, Speaker C: Hey, there. Thanks. You talked about this in the context of businesses. That's what the rule initially applied to. What do individuals need to think about? When do their activities cross the border and become treated like a business?
00:19:13.952 - 00:19:35.810, Speaker A: Right now, individuals have the same requirement. And again, it doesn't make sense. So right now you have the same requirement. If you receive it for mining rewards, airdrops, your work, consulting work, or something like that, you have the same requirement. So again, it's not fully in effect. It was supposed to go in Jan one. By mid Jan, they were like, pause, hold on, time out.
00:19:35.810 - 00:19:42.738, Speaker A: We got to figure this out. Okay, I just have a few more seconds, but I think we can take one if that's okay.
00:19:42.904 - 00:19:55.014, Speaker D: Hey, hopefully it's pretty quick answer. Sorry, I talked about it. I missed the first part. Do both parties in the transaction have to be us based for this form to apply?
00:19:55.132 - 00:20:26.610, Speaker A: No, if you're us based, it applies to you. Someone who's not us based wouldn't have to necessarily. Let's say you're a business operating here. I don't think would have to, but again, the final details have not been rolled out. But I wanted to do this presentation today to make people in the community aware that this is likely coming. And there are a lot of things that we need to comply with or you can face real penalties. But if you are us based, some version of this, when it rolls out, finally will likely apply to you.
00:20:26.610 - 00:20:49.910, Speaker A: Again, wait and see, but it's a really important issue facing the crypto community. None of us want to pay a large penalty to the IRS or go to jail, potentially. So staying on top of this reporting requirement and advocating for clarity on it, I think is really, really important for the community. All right, I'm at negative time, so thank you guys so much. I'll just be over here if anyone has any additional questions. Bye.
