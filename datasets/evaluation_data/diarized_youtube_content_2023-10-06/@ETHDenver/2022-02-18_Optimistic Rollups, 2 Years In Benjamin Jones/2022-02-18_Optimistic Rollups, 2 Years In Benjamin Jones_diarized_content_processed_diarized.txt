00:00:00.330 - 00:00:19.760, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay, guys, I have a very, you know, legit, I swear, talk on scalability, but I thought we could all use a break from it. So I would like to start you all off with a synchronized clap. Are y'all ready to clap with me? There we go.
00:00:24.610 - 00:00:51.246, Speaker B: Our bom. All right.
00:00:51.268 - 00:01:12.594, Speaker A: We did it. Thank you all. All right, what's going on, y'all? I am Ben and I am from a company called optimism. Thank you. And I am here today to talk about roll ups. It's the thing, we're doing optimistic roll ups. And I hope you guys know portal or this slide won't make much sense.
00:01:12.594 - 00:01:34.458, Speaker A: But it's been a while, y'all. It really has. It has been two and a half years since we kind of had roll ups coming onto the scene. Most of that's been during COVID We personally have been live on Mainet for over a year now. And so it's time to talk about that. There's a lot of things that we got to say and it's been a while. We've been in hiding, we've been in quarantine, and we got to get it all out there.
00:01:34.458 - 00:01:59.614, Speaker A: So I'm going to talk about sort of three things. I'm going to go over what's happened, where we're at so far. I'm going to talk about what we see coming up in roll ups in the next, say, year in the reasonable short term with a lot of clarity. And then we're going to try to make some projections about where all this stuff is headed. Sound good? Yeah. Okay, so what has happened? Okay, I'll start with the shills. I'll start with the shills.
00:01:59.614 - 00:02:06.290, Speaker A: Guys, we are almost at $1 billion saved on optimism main net.
00:02:06.360 - 00:02:07.010, Speaker B: Woo.
00:02:07.990 - 00:02:29.094, Speaker A: Very exciting. So if everyone did all their transactions that they've done on optimism on l one, they would have spent almost $1 billion more. So we're pretty hype about that. If you guys haven't tried out our system, go check it out. Okay, so that's the show part. I also want to talk about some of the mistakes we made. And I think one of the biggest mistakes we made, I think the biggest was we undervalued the EVM.
00:02:29.094 - 00:02:55.780, Speaker A: Semantics. What does that mean? Okay, well, obviously, to build these roll up things, we need to have a way to secure the system. And we do that with this optimistic roll up design. It involves disputes, some fancy stuff behind the scenes. The point is, we came out with the first version of this that was called the OVM, the optimistic virtual machine. And this was great. But you'll notice that O is different than E.
00:02:55.780 - 00:03:38.366, Speaker A: And at first we thought that was fine, but it turned out, as we kept going, this wasn't quite the case. Sure, you could take a solidity contract or a viper contract and get it running on our system, but the reality was that the more we dug in and the more people started trying, the more we realized that the small, itty bitty nuances of the EVM really mattered. In fact, all of that tooling doesn't integrate it with solidity. It integrates with the EVM itself, the instructions, the bytecode, all of this wonderful technical jargon, right? And this meant a lot of tooling broke. It also meant that sometimes you couldn't just deploy your contract. You had to figure out what the difference in the OVM might be and fix that difference and get it to deploy. So these are challenges.
00:03:38.366 - 00:04:23.866, Speaker A: One thing I think we did do right is we got geth running. We've been running geth in prod for over a year now. And the reality is, for these rollups to succeed, we need to build on the very strong foundation that the go Ethereum code base gives us. So that's something that we were doing right, but there were a lot we were doing wrong there. So if you haven't tried deploying on optimism in the last six months, you should try now, because it got way easier. We did the EVM equivalents upgrade, right? So this is a wonderful ethereum yellow paper that we perfectly conform with every little nitty gritty detail of how the instructions and how your Ethereum works works on rollup. So that got us the tooling, that got us ever list deployments, and that got us even closer to Geth.
00:04:23.866 - 00:04:48.294, Speaker A: The reality is we were running Geth, but we had to have some differences. Now, those differences are tiny. Tiny. And that is a really good news, because it means we're building on the strong core foundation that Ethereum gives us. Okay, so what are some of the other things that's happened outside of optimism? One thing is that bridges have become a reality. Rich, any of you use a bridge? Okay, not bad, not bad. So, like, three years ago, this is my co founder, Kelvin, four years ago.
00:04:48.294 - 00:05:16.490, Speaker A: Now, my God, writing about fast withdrawals, talking about the idea that we can move money between these different chains seamlessly and quickly. And that has gone from concept to reality. This is from our web page. There's a bunch of bridges that you can use to move around, and that's a big deal. It's really cool. However, it is notable that the two largest hacks, not just in crypto, but in the history of the universe, as humanity, I suppose. I don't know about the aliens.
00:05:16.490 - 00:05:42.234, Speaker A: The two biggest hacks were bridge hacks. And we can avoid this with optimistic roll ups. That's the point, is to give us increased security to avoid it, but not all bridges do. So I think that's an interesting thing, and it's worth discussing. And ultimately, I do think that's okay, because the reality is, you get a choice. If you want a cheaper bridge that is under collateralized and has some risk to it, you can use that. If you want to pay a bit more and guarantee your money is safe, you can, too.
00:05:42.234 - 00:06:14.594, Speaker A: And I think that having that choice, even though it may be scary, is a fundamental thing that we do in crypto. We want to give users choice, and if you want to make that risky bet, you can. Okay. Another thing that's happened is we've had an explosion of Mev. So, two years ago, we put out this idea that you should sequence roll ups. You should have the people producing the blocks of the roll ups be independent from the people that are mining the l one blocks. Now, we have a majority of l two s following this scheme, and we have also seen an explosion of MeV on l one.
00:06:14.594 - 00:06:31.058, Speaker A: An absolute explosion. Right. When we wrote this, very small. Now, flashbots, everything else, it's millions of dollars. It's a huge, huge gain. Right? And what we're starting to see, this is an awesome paper I'd highly recommend by the flashbots team. We're starting to see the dawn of cross chain Mev.
00:06:31.058 - 00:07:07.026, Speaker A: We're starting to realize that, just like you can do arbitrage on one chain, you can buy one asset on one chain and sell it on another, and make arbitrage. And there's really interesting properties that are coming out of that. So it's fascinating. There is a lot more going on with Mev, and it is a long road ahead, but it is very interesting, and it's definitely been very active in the past two years. Okay. The last thing that we've seen is we have seen this cycle's eos, we have seen Solana, the big blockchains. And I think this is a really interesting one for the audience and for the people who are here at ETh Denver, because the reality is.
00:07:07.026 - 00:07:42.510, Speaker A: Okay, this is a ridiculous slide. It's definitely self deprecating, because I am firmly in Ethereum, but I think the reality is there are big blockchains outside that are trying to scale ethereum differently. And while they may not align with the values that are very, very important to us and to our community, there are legitimate advantages that these systems afford. Namely, they have much better composability because everything is on one chain. It means you can do your cross contract calls synchronously. And the reality is that is what we should be comparing what we're building with Ethereum. L two s two.
00:07:42.510 - 00:08:12.842, Speaker A: It's simply not realistic to say that values are enough. We have to provide the technology and we can do this. It's harder because we want to secure things with l one, but it is possible we can compete even if we have tighter constraints. And in general, I think there's a multichain versus monochain narrative right now, which is kind of what all this is about. And I'll talk a bit more about that later. Namely, it is a false dichotomy, imo, you can have both. And the last thing that we have is that the roll up centric Ethereum is going strong.
00:08:12.842 - 00:08:29.150, Speaker A: So two years ago v put out this post about the roll up centric Ethereum roadmap. Today we have literally dozens of l two s. Shout out l twobeat.com. You can go look at them all, learn about them. Fantastic stuff. The ecosystem is exploding and that's really exciting. It's the Ethereum vision coming alive.
00:08:29.150 - 00:09:17.006, Speaker A: Okay, with that being said, some things have been lost. I would say that if I were to look three years back, when Ethereum scaling was much more focused on e two, phase two, sharded execution, the talk of the town was how are we going to solve the composability problem? And since we've started saying that roll ups are going to be an ecosystem that are all settled on l one, that's a great vision. But I do think we've lost some of that. So I pulled some of these screenshots from a while back that are people talking about cross shard composability, and some of that has been lost in the current system. Okay, so that is what's been going on in the past two years. What is coming up in the short term? Okay, the big thing for us is optimism. Bedrock edition, just a little bit more shilling here.
00:09:17.006 - 00:09:55.450, Speaker A: This is our ground up EVM equivalents, roll up stack. So we've basically taken all the lessons that we've learned from building our first version and from running it on main net for over a year now. We're taking all the incredible abstractions. It turns out, by the way, that eth two and the merge, what the beacon chain does for Geth in the merge is exactly what l one does for l two gets in roll ups. Who would have thought? And so one of the incredible things is we can use the same APIs, the same clients, really really crazy. And so bedrock is our v 1.0.0 that rolls up all these lessons into one thing.
00:09:55.450 - 00:10:09.166, Speaker A: Another part of it is canon. Oh my God. Canon. Canon. Canon. Canon is the first public EVM equivalent fault proof. This means that our disputes and our roll ups can behave exactly like the EVM itself.
00:10:09.166 - 00:10:55.166, Speaker A: In fact, Canon runs l one blocks, it doesn't even run l two blocks. And this is fascinating, it's a generalization of a lot, a lot of research that's gone into the roll up space over the past many years. And another thing that it does is it gets us ideal gas costs. So I could talk about this stuff all day, but we've got 8 minutes, so I'll keep going. I think the main thing that I'll say about it though is this came from our frustration with how we were doing roll ups before. And what were we doing? We were starting by writing a fault proof, by writing the security system that kept our roll up secure, and then implementing a node that would follow the rules that this dispute game that we had invented followed. We've realized that this is not the way to go and this is what canon gives us.
00:10:55.166 - 00:11:27.400, Speaker A: Before we were trapped in a cage, we had to write a fault proof and then take that exact logic we had implemented and rewrite it as a node. Now we just write the node software and the compiler turns that into fault proofs. Really really powerful. Can't tell you how much of a relief it is to not write everything twice and be stressed that they don't match. It's really good. So we can compile the fault proof of an EVM chain. Okay, the last thing that's coming up in the actual perennial term is that we are getting fees much lower.
00:11:27.400 - 00:11:54.366, Speaker A: Ethereum as a system is finally coming around to the fact that call data is the primary cost of the secure l two s today, and that we need to lower those. And we're starting to get pragmatic about these designs. We had EIP 4488, which might not have gone through, but at least was a discussion. We have dank sharding, one of the greatest names of ethereum scaling I've ever heard in my life. It's literally dank sharding. Okay, no, it's Donk sharding because Donkrad came up with it. But so be it.
00:11:54.366 - 00:12:30.490, Speaker A: And we also have these blob transactions that are going to really improve things in the short term. By the way, if that sounds interesting to you, our team is hacking together blob transaction stuff here at E. Denver. So come find me if you want to contribute to the future of what ethereum needs to be doing. All right, we got 6 minutes left. So for the last 6 minutes, I'll talk a little bit about what we see on the horizon. So I don't know how many of you guys have seen this, but Vitalik put out a post in the last month of last year called Endgame, which talks about his belief as to where the future of Ethereum scaling is going.
00:12:30.490 - 00:13:31.690, Speaker A: Where does the rollup centric roadmap end up? And I think there's a lot in there and I couldn't possibly unpack it all now. But the main thing that I'll say is this diagram, if you take nothing away else from what Vitalik's talking about, the future of Ethereum, take away this diagram. This is how Vitalik lays out three different scenarios that all lead to the same end state, completely different approaches that appear to be narrowing in on the same thing. And the reality is that we're finally starting to see on the horizon what the end game for scaling looks like. What is that endgame? That endgame is one in which block production is centralized, validation is decentralized, censorship, resistance is preserved. And we have huge blocks, which is really important because the blocks that we have today simply will not get us to the global scale and for us to reach the next million people and the next billion people beyond that, what we have now just doesn't cut it. Okay, I showed the compile fault proof before thing with canon.
00:13:31.690 - 00:14:04.810, Speaker A: What we're realizing is that if we can write a node and get a fault proof for it, we can write a sharded node and get a fault proof for a sharded chain. This is mind blowing. This is what we're talking about. And it's one of the paths laid out here. It's the top right path, as a matter of fact. Okay, basically, how does that work? Quick TLDR, you have a huge block producer that can create really big blocks, and the block producer cuts that block up into 100 parts. And at each intermediate part along the way it gives a hash of what the state is at that part.
00:14:04.810 - 00:14:46.774, Speaker A: Then you take 1% of that block, you give it to 100 different computers, and those computers can run only 1% of the power. But check that if they line up all of their results, that the net result is what the sequencer gave. Right? Okay, so if that doesn't make sense, or that diagram didn't make sense, just think of it like this. We're going to have big plot producers that give us the Salana like properties that we want, and we're going to have a bunch of people that can still run that on their laptops and contribute to security. This is a way to get decentralization, but still scale massively and composably in the way that we want. So remember before I said that the multi chain mono chain slide was a bit of a false dichotomy? That's why. It's because we can have both.
00:14:46.774 - 00:15:10.746, Speaker A: We can have big block producers, but we can have decentralized validation. And I think that is really powerful. And there are other ways that we can get there, but it seems that they're all ending up in this model. This is a ridiculous slide. We don't really know how to visualize this effectively yet, but I liked it this way. Okay, so TLDR guys, that's just about it. I would say that the TLDR roll ups have been exploding.
00:15:10.746 - 00:15:38.920, Speaker A: It is not over yet. We've got EVM equivalent fault proofs that are really, really important. We're super glad to have them. We're going to have a pragmatic, non three year away sharding roadmap that is going to give us the scalability that we need in terms of the cost of data. And in the long term, we're going to shard that data even more. We're going to shard the execution. And it seems like we are narrowing in on a vision for what blockchain scalability looks like into the future.
00:15:38.920 - 00:16:01.840, Speaker A: So that's all I got other than we are hiring. If you want to come jam with us and play more music and other songs together, come work with us. Jobs. Optimism IO and as predicted, we have 2 minutes. So I could answer a question in the next 2 minutes if you all like not answering that one. Yeah, going up. There's a mic right there.
00:16:01.840 - 00:16:12.300, Speaker A: All right, we got a man with a question.
00:16:14.110 - 00:16:30.062, Speaker C: How with big block producers, you want to keep censorship resistance, and also, for instance, legal safety of these block producers, but censorship resistance is most important.
00:16:30.196 - 00:16:55.046, Speaker A: So the question was, how do we maintain censorship resistance and how do we keep safety? So for the safety, that's this thing, right? That's taking a bunch of laptops and splitting up the compute to keep every piece safe for censorship resistance, it's by using l one right, so just like we can take a roll up and send a censorship resistant l one transaction into the roll up, we can do that with these big roll ups, too. All right, it's 1229. We got one more question to answer.
00:16:55.228 - 00:17:02.602, Speaker C: What's your guys stance on the future ZK roll ups and how that will compete with you guys and maybe what you guys would want to do that in the future.
00:17:02.736 - 00:17:33.950, Speaker A: What we're seeing with ZK rollups right now is very similar to what we were going through a year ago with that OVM. What we're realizing is that that EVM is fantastic. And it remains to be seen whether ZK will ever get as cheap as an optimistic system. Because fundamentally, you have to do this crazy moon map behind the scenes. Hopefully, for many applications it is useful, and we definitely see that integrating into the larger picture of chains. But it's not going to be the only thing because optimistic systems fundamentally are always going to be cheaper.
00:17:34.250 - 00:17:35.046, Speaker B: That.
00:17:35.228 - 00:17:43.490, Speaker A: All right, guys, I think that's all the time I got. Thank you so much for jamming with me. Take care. Bye.
