00:00:00.890 - 00:00:20.560, Speaker A: Okay, up next is Ave. So Hadrian's going to give us. There he is. Hadrian, you ready for our introduction? For developers to Ave, you're on mute. Go ahead and unmute yourself.
00:00:23.010 - 00:00:31.960, Speaker B: Hey, yeah, just having a quick issue with the screen sharing. It seems so. Hope to be here really quickly.
00:00:35.130 - 00:00:42.220, Speaker A: No problem at all. Take your time. This is where I do a little dance or I like.
00:00:42.670 - 00:00:44.938, Speaker B: Yes, please do something like that.
00:00:45.024 - 00:01:17.382, Speaker A: I'll just remind everybody about poker tonight. Go to the crypto voxels metaverse, check out the art auctions. Support the community. Support the art community. This is really important stuff. I mean, we're doing a giant experiment here and creating ETH Denver virtually. But so far, as much as I would love to be in front of everybody, which is priority and preference, like the ability to connect with people the way that we've done this has really been pretty cool.
00:01:17.382 - 00:01:42.922, Speaker A: We were on Minecraft last night, chatting with people. We were doing all sorts of interesting things in just different components of the gamer jive space. We had a couple of icebreakers yesterday. We actually watched teams form. So it's been a good time so far. I'm enjoying myself as a poker hacker. Grabbed me for two.
00:01:42.976 - 00:01:43.580, Speaker B: Eat.
00:01:44.370 - 00:01:53.540, Speaker A: Yeah, probably did. Yeah, you don't want to. Probably. Come play against me tonight. Don't come, you'll lose. I'm going to win.
00:01:54.950 - 00:01:56.338, Speaker B: Hey, guys, can you hear me?
00:01:56.424 - 00:01:57.666, Speaker A: Are you ready now?
00:01:57.848 - 00:01:58.580, Speaker B: Yes.
00:01:59.990 - 00:02:00.450, Speaker A: Okay.
00:02:00.520 - 00:02:28.790, Speaker B: All right, take it away. Let's go. So, hi, I'm from Ave. I'll try to give an overview for devs of the protocol itself and give you a good idea of what's possible with the protocol. So Ave really quickly, it's a liquidity protocol. You have people or entities that can deposit assets into the protocol and they earn interest on it. And you have on the other side, people that can borrow these assets.
00:02:28.790 - 00:03:01.302, Speaker B: For that, they need to have collaterals deposited also. That's the core value of Avi. So as of today, we have more than $5 billion worth of assets inside the protocol. We are pumped about this, but this is only the beginning. And so here are the main features. You can deposit that gives you access to interest. You can borrow and with this, increase some of your position, or you can do whatever you want with this.
00:03:01.302 - 00:03:52.790, Speaker B: And we have introduced new capabilities in the credit delegation. And we have flash loans, v two, that are really interesting. And our governance that we think is one of the best out there that we upgraded really lately. So in v two, what's new? It's the possibility to make batch flash loans. So you can flash loans on several assets at the same time, you can interact with the protocol itself while doing a flash loan that was not possible in d one, the debts are tokenized, so when you borrow an asset you have tokenized debt. We have the credited delegation, we'll talk about that. The governance v two again that has many delegation capabilities and that separates the voting and the proposition powers.
00:03:52.790 - 00:05:22.002, Speaker B: We have made some efficiency better, any efficiency in the gas usage, we have access to wrap ether inside the protocol, and we have the permit of EIP 20 612 that allows for single approval and transfer. So now the first thing, the most simple, the earn, you let basically people borrow your money and you earn interest on it, and we tokenize this asset, so in the form of a token. So let's say you deposit die, you get a die and one a die is always equals to and redeemable to one die, but your amount of Adai will always accrue thanks to interest. So as soon as you deposit die, you get Adai and this amount is increasing. So now for devs, it's pretty simple, I won't spend too much time on this, but here we are going to deposit some die. So here is the address you want to deposit 100 of DAI, and so first you need to approve the lending pool of avid. First just I'm going to give you an idea, but we have documentations that we try to keep updates and that should give more information.
00:05:22.002 - 00:06:21.160, Speaker B: I give you a mental idea of everything that's possible. So we approve the DAI and then we can deposit die here, you can see that there is on behalf of, so here we are depositing for ourselves, but it's possible to deposit die and that somebody else gets a die. So here we deposit some die. Now the amount of a die that we have is always increasing, every second it's increasing due to interest, and when you want you can withdraw them. So here it's how we do it, it's just calling the lending pool, it's our core contract in v two, and you withdraw the asset you want. Here it's I, and so you get here we chosen the maximum, the un minus one, that is the max of un, and that means that you're going to withdraw everything. So all your die plus interest.
00:06:21.160 - 00:07:28.774, Speaker B: So on the other side you can borrow, so basically you need money, you can borrow, but you need to have deposited before. Actually with credit division it's a bit different, but let's say that sometimes you can borrow, sometimes you cannot. If you have collateral, you can borrow a certain amount and if somebody has delegated credit to you, you can also borrow without collateral, but we'll get to that later. So basically before we deposited die, so we have adai and against this we can borrow tokens. So let's say that you have deposited and you can borrow die to do whatever you want, to farm, to do something. Let's see how it goes here we're going to borrow some die. So here we can choose actually between, so we'll have to pay interest on this loan.
00:07:28.774 - 00:08:06.290, Speaker B: So we can choose the interest rate mode that is all stable or variable. And so here that's what we do. We are borrowing Dai with a stable debt mode. That means that we know in advance what the interest rate API will be. And so that's it. Here we borrow a set on behalf of ourselves here message sender. So that means that we need to have collaterals before we need to have a eth or something else to be able to borrow die.
00:08:06.290 - 00:08:58.426, Speaker B: So here we borrow die. We'll get to that later. But if somebody has delegated credit to you, given you access to his collateral, their collateral, you can borrow on behalf of them. So at any time you can swap between the stable debt model or the variable debt. So stable interest rate or variable interest rate. Just know that when you move from variable interest rate to stable one, you'll have the latest stable rate. So that means that sometimes you don't want to do that because maybe you secured a good stable rate before and you don't want to update it just for you to know.
00:08:58.426 - 00:09:36.230, Speaker B: So now you've borrowed and so now you can repay with the interest. So here you need to approve again. So here we're going to repay the Dai debt that we just contracted. We're going to approve the lending pool for Dai, and again we're going to repay on behalf of ourselves. You repay the debt. And so let's say that you had deposited ether before. Now you can withdraw your ether.
00:09:36.230 - 00:09:58.700, Speaker B: So now credit delegation, this is really interesting. This is what we've been developing for P two. Basically you have collateral. You want other to borrow against this. You can do that. You can delegate credit to someone else. So that's it, you give your credit fund to somebody else.
00:09:58.700 - 00:10:51.390, Speaker B: I think it's really interesting. And there's so much potential to develop around that you could create smart contracts on top of this to create your own loan mechanism or even off chain contracts. So let's say you can borrow 100 die. You give this borrowing capability to someone else, and in the real life or off chain or in any protocol, you create another contract with this person. And what's great is that for the person you delegated your credit for, he's contracting undercurized loan. So that's really interesting. So here how it happens.
00:10:51.390 - 00:11:32.134, Speaker B: So here we fetch. I think that this is not the real function, it's more get rid of data or something. But you fetch the table depth token and the variable depth token of a certain asset. Let's say here it's die. So here you fetch the address of stable debt of die and variable depth of die. And what you will do is that you will hear on the two last lines. You approve a borrower to increase your debt, your stable debt or variable debt of die.
00:11:32.134 - 00:12:18.790, Speaker B: So let's say that I deposited some ether and I didn't use my credit line. I will say to someone else, hey, now you can borrow die against my collaterals. So that's what happens here. And so now the borrower, he has now my credit line, he can now borrow from me, he can borrow die from my collaterals. And what he will have to do is that he will do as we done before. He will call the lending pool and the borrow function, and this time he will say on behalf of me, and that way his borrowing die. But it's myself that get a debt.
00:12:18.790 - 00:12:58.970, Speaker B: And so that's why we need another contract somewhere else. He wants to. And if he doesn't, it's going to be up to me to repay the debt. Because this depth of die that he contracted is linked to my account. Yeah, again, I delegated credit to someone else. He can also, let's say that he borrowed from me some dice using my collateral, some dice. He can then repay my debt.
00:12:58.970 - 00:13:38.870, Speaker B: And by doing this here, it's because he's repaying and on behalf of myself. So that's how you can think that you can also create smart contracts on top of this. And there are so many interesting things that you can do. I love the ideas around delegated credits together, let's say a community. Each member delegates credits to a pool, and from this pool we will do some loans to support our community. I think that's really interesting. And we've already seen great projects.
00:13:38.870 - 00:14:26.578, Speaker B: Having fun with this now, flash loans. This is also a capability that was well known this summer. Especially it allows you to borrow from our pool of assets and unlimited amounts. And you will pay a low interest rate on this. The condition is that in the same transaction you will have to pay back the amount you borrowed. So it's really interesting. If you want to do arbitrage, or if you want to swap collaterals between maker and Ave, or if you want to do some kind of migrations.
00:14:26.578 - 00:16:05.514, Speaker B: And in v two, what we introduced is the ability to not actually repay. So you borrow an amount in a transaction, or you can repay it in the same transaction, or at the end it will settle as a debt if you have enough collateral, of course, but we'll see that a bit more. So, flash loan, really simply how it works is that you have here on top of the purple line, you have someone that wants to call a flash loan. So he calls the average protocol again, it's the same contract, the lending pool, and you call the function flash loan, and you say, I want you to get dies, and then you do whatever you want with die. The only condition is that at the end, you give back the die to the protocol. And actually it's between the protocol itself that will get them from you anyway. So what you could do is that, for instance, you can swap the collaterals in the maker vault, so you can flash on Sunday, repeat some depth, then get back the collateral and, and swap these collaterals for another asset and put them in another maker vault, and then borrow again, die, and that's it repays the flash loans.
00:16:05.514 - 00:16:55.622, Speaker B: So it's really nice to do usually migrations when you have some collaterals and depth. That's really interesting. You can do also, of course, arbitrage. Let's say that you've seen an opportunity to protocols that are creating the same kind of assets, but where the price differs, you can borrow die to make arbitrage between these two platforms. And in v two, you can borrow flash, borrow several assets at the same time. I think that's really interesting. So here concrete, effectively, how it works here, we're going to create a contract that will do two things.
00:16:55.622 - 00:17:39.120, Speaker B: First, here we call the flash loan function from the protocol, asking for here, two assets. So here, asset, one, asset, two. Just 2 seconds. I'm not sure if that's good. Sorry. Yeah, so you here, this is your contract, and you want to flash borrow two assets. And so you're going to call the lending pool of Ave, and you're going to call the function flash loan.
00:17:39.120 - 00:18:19.888, Speaker B: And here this contract will also so the flash loan. How it works really is that you ask the protocol of Ave. Protocol, hey, please give me some assets. And what the protocol will do is that it will give you the assets and it will call a callback function. And we will see hits here, it's the execute operation. So here when you call the flash loan function. The receiver address should be a contract that implements this function, the execute operation, because this is the function that the protocol will call.
00:18:19.888 - 00:19:08.352, Speaker B: So here we say that we want to get these two assets and we want to get them back in receiver address. In that case, the receiver is the contract itself. Because this contract, as you see, has two functions. The first one to call the flash loan, and it has also implemented the execute operation function that will be called by the protocol once you call the flash loan function. So just difference between v one and v two. In v one, you had to, at the end of the transaction, you have to repay what you borrowed, you had to repay what you borrowed. And in that case, it's the protocol that will pull your assets at the end.
00:19:08.352 - 00:20:17.540, Speaker B: So here you need in this function to approve the lending pool of your assets, okay? Because again, it's the pool that will pull your assets at the end. Just a quick note, as I said before, here you have the modes. So for the asset one and asset two, you can set different modes. And if you said that the mode you are using for this asset is zero, that means that you need to repay the assets at the end of the transaction. Like if you borrowed 800 die, you need to pay back within the same transaction, 800 die plus interest, if you choose the mode number one at the end. And of course the transaction will revert if you didn't pay back the 800 die. In the case of mod zero, in the case of mod one, if you didn't repay the borrowed amount, it will create a stable debt for you.
00:20:17.540 - 00:21:04.260, Speaker B: And that means that of course you need to have enough collateral. But if you have enough collateral, it will create a stable debt. So you can make a flash loan and not repay everything. And that's really interesting against, if you want to do some margin position or stuff like that, where you borrow an amount of die and you just repay some of it because you want in the end to have some die debt. So here again, the three modes. The modero is the classic one where you need to repay the token, otherwise the transaction will revert. And one, and two, whether you want to have stable debt or variable debt, in case you didn't repay in the same transaction.
00:21:04.260 - 00:21:54.900, Speaker B: I think that's it for the flash loans. V two of Ave. Now let's talk about also the governance. We've done a good amount of work on this, and I think that we have a really nice model of governance. So the goal is that we at Avigen's team, we don't own the protocol, we can't do anything without the vote of everyone. So really the owners of Avi protocol are the Avi token holders. And anyone that have Avi tokens can vote, can create proposals to change the protocol.
00:21:54.900 - 00:22:53.476, Speaker B: And so I think that's really interesting and yeah, that's a really good part of what we are doing is seeing the proposals came from anywhere and be discussed in the public and then voted by stakeholders. So the V two features, multiple tokens for governance. So that means that our framework, and you could build on top of it. I think that we've seen Kyber that recently used our governance framework to allow multiple different tokens to vote on proposals. So that's one of the features you can think also about. Let's say you have two tokens, you have vested tokens and tokens, you can have those two tokens to govern. In the case of Ave, we have the Ave token and the staked Ave token that are governance token.
00:22:53.476 - 00:23:42.600, Speaker B: And soon we'll maybe have another one. And for that you have to look at the current proposals. Now another feature is the separation between proposition and voting power, meaning that you have Ave token from having these tokens, you have two powers, you have the proposition power. So creating a new proposal and the voting power. And since on V two you can delegate this power, one or both, it's really interesting. So let's say you want to delegate the proposition capability of your tokens to an entity, you can do that without giving them the voting. So if you want to let them propose, but then in the end you want to watch yourself or they get to someone else, you can.
00:23:42.600 - 00:24:29.332, Speaker B: It's interesting. So this is an overview of how it works. Again, we have the Ave and the state Ave tokens that vote on proposals. And here on the very top we have the governance contracts and people create proposals and vote proposals as these. Yeah. On the right we have the governance strategy contract and it is in this contract that we say okay, for our governance, the strategy is that we have Ave and spectacular as tokens. But you could update this governance strategy to add another token or another one, change the ratios.
00:24:29.332 - 00:25:09.344, Speaker B: That's how it works. And in the case of Ave, we have two executors of proposals. So two processes of proposals, one process that is short. So you make proposals that vote for three days and that can be executed after one day of delay. This is for the upgrades of the protocols that are not critical. And we have a long time lock. So this time it's a long process where the voting is higher, seven days and you have some higher time locks.
00:25:09.344 - 00:26:06.928, Speaker B: This is when we change things about the governance itself that is really important. So to give you a concrete idea of how it works, we have a forum where people that want to propose new stuff should submit some arc requests for comments, have a request for comments on the forum, we discuss about this and then we create an AIP on the AIP. The AIP should correspond to a proposal. The proposal is the on chain implementation of this proposal. And so then we create the proposal. For that we need that the creator has enough proposition power, whether it's own power or the one that he got from delegation. And then the proposal is voted on.
00:26:06.928 - 00:26:46.096, Speaker B: And there's two conditions. There needs to be enough yes votes to reach a quorum, and the yes votes need to be higher than the no votes higher. And then the proposal is queued and executed. So here for instance, we've done a lot of AIP already in the first quarter of 2021. We recently added balancer, for instance, on Ave. You can deposit them and borrow them. And here the AP nine is the first step of adding a new stake token in the safety module.
00:26:46.096 - 00:27:22.930, Speaker B: I'll talk about this later. But yeah, the ave balance of pool tokens will soon be available for staking. So again, for the code, it's really simple. Here you can use the function of the Avi tokens and the staked Avi token. There is a function, delegate, that will delegate both your power, the proposition and the voting power. There is another function that is called delegate by type. And with this function you can delegate only your proposition power or your voting power.
00:27:22.930 - 00:28:02.776, Speaker B: Then the Ave governance contract. This is where you create proposals and you submit votes. Note that we also support off chain voting, meaning that you can let voters vote off chain, just sign a message and then we can put them on chain. And it doesn't need to be. Yeah, now the stake in this is also something that is really interesting. We think that security is sexy, as Mark Zeller would say. And so people can stake tokens on Ave.
00:28:02.776 - 00:29:13.724, Speaker B: For now it's Ave. The token that you can send is Ave and you get staked Ave, and soon you'll have the balancer pool tokens. So basically the stakers put value into securing the protocol even more and they earn some rewards. And the goal of that is that even though we had five audits and we think that it's really secure, in case of there is an issue, the protocol has capabilities to repay some debts that could appear or some malfunction months. So yeah, this is also part of the governance and basically you stick, and then you get rewards. And you'll have to wait ten days if you want to stake them. If you want to stake your Ave tokens, you need to call the function stake of the staked Ave token.
00:29:13.724 - 00:29:45.164, Speaker B: And first, of course, you need to approve your Ave. And by calling the function stake, the stake token will take some of your Ave and stake them in the contract. I think that's it. My time must be up. But, yeah, we've got so many projects building on our flashland, and our protocol is so exciting, and we can't wait to see you use our capabilities. Cool.
00:29:45.282 - 00:29:48.040, Speaker A: Hadrian, thank you. Thank you so much for the presentation.
