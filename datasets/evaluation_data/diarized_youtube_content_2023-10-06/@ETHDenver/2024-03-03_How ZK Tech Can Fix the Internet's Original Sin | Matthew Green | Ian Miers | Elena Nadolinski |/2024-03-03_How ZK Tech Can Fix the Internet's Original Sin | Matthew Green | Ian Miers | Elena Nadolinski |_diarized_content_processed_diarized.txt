00:00:00.090 - 00:00:25.280, Speaker A: Crypto. That's the crypto vertical on axios.com. You got 2 seconds right now. You should also subscribe to it right now. Thank you for coming. Sticking around to this late in the day panel. Looking forward to talking about zero knowledge proofs and the original sin of the Internet, which, of course, is the fact that the Internet spies on us constantly all the time and everything that we do.
00:00:25.280 - 00:00:54.362, Speaker A: Just to kick it off, just one thought I want to give for everyone, which is relevant to the great prior talk that we had by Matthew and this whole conversation. Know, if you guys are on crypto Twitter, you know that there's always that one group on there that cries every time crypto comes up. And it's like, crypto doesn't mean cryptocurrency, it means encryption. And it's just like, cry harder, guys. Serious encryption is a bigger and bigger part of cryptocurrency every day. So you know what? That conversation is over. Words can mean more than one thing.
00:00:54.362 - 00:01:12.622, Speaker A: Let me let our panel introduce themselves. Let's just go down the row here and just give us a quick line about what you're doing, why you're relevant to this space, and then if you can, really quickly, what's the most Sci-Fi thing that you can imagine that you would like to imagine doing with ZK technology? Start with you, Elena.
00:01:12.686 - 00:01:36.086, Speaker B: Cool. My name is Elena. I run a project called ironfish. We started way back in 2020, 2019 era. I actually approached Matthew, I don't know if you remember me, even at the first decon in Montreal ever, and I don't think I said anything intelligent, but very exciting times. So what? Ironfish is a proof of work layer one fully encrypted or fully private chain. And we're the only mainnet privacy chain that actually supports custom assets.
00:01:36.086 - 00:01:53.646, Speaker B: And so our goal is to build bridges to transparent chains like Ethereum, optimism base, et cetera, to allow users to actually move those assets over to ironfish and have private USDC, private WBtC, private eTH, et cetera. So it's definitely a work in progress, but, yeah, that's part of the reason why I'm here.
00:01:53.748 - 00:01:55.354, Speaker A: Wait, Sci-Fi? Give us Sci-Fi?
00:01:55.402 - 00:02:23.142, Speaker B: Oh, Sci-Fi. I mean, this is not a positive thing, but this is, like, a thing that I think about a lot, which is what would happen if our efforts were not here. Fast forward to 510 years. Let's say we all are in cbdcs. We're all using crypto payments, and it's all transparent. What are the secondary effects that we're going to have in society if everything you do is out in the open, how does that change how people interact with one another or think, or how they even police their own thoughts?
00:02:23.206 - 00:02:23.862, Speaker A: Dystopian.
00:02:23.926 - 00:02:30.426, Speaker B: I like dystopian world. That's part of the reason why I'm so motivated to work on ironfish and other privacy tech.
00:02:30.528 - 00:02:31.180, Speaker A: Cool.
00:02:31.550 - 00:02:35.450, Speaker C: So, my name's Ian Myers. I'm a professor at the University of Maryland.
00:02:35.530 - 00:02:37.070, Speaker A: Get it a little bit closer. Ian.
00:02:37.410 - 00:03:04.486, Speaker C: My name is Ian Myers. I'm a professor at the University of Maryland. My phd thesis was on with Matt here on a thing called zero cash, which turned up to be the protocol in Zcash, tornado, cash, ironfish, and most of the other second generation privacy coins that are coming online now. And, let's see, Sci-Fi I'm kind of curious what would happen if we had a version of the Internet where you were completely anonymous, but we had a way to ban you or give you reputation. If you were a dick and get.
00:03:04.508 - 00:03:07.800, Speaker A: Rid of you, I'd be out. All right.
00:03:09.230 - 00:03:17.014, Speaker D: Okay. I'm Matt again. I think the easy answer. Should I give more introduction, or you've.
00:03:17.062 - 00:03:18.090, Speaker A: We've met. You.
00:03:18.160 - 00:03:54.774, Speaker D: Okay. I don't think we need Sci-Fi, and I don't think we need dystopias when the whole world is kind of one already. So I actually think, like, the weird dystopian, maybe utopian thing is, and I seriously believe this, that this technology that people are building and including those folks in the other room, is going to eat the entire existing financial system. And I know that people in this room are the kind of people who believe that. I say that to my professor colleagues and they laugh at me. But I do think that in ten to 15 years, it is going to be the financial system. But if you look at the financial system right, it's going to be bank of America, it's going to be Wells Fargo, it's going to be all of these companies, you know, but using this as a low back end.
00:03:54.774 - 00:04:08.298, Speaker D: And the terrifying thing for me is if they're using ethereum as it looks right now, to move your money, your private banking, doing that on public chains is the worst possible thing I could imagine, and they're not going to do that. That's why this technology is so important.
00:04:08.464 - 00:04:30.866, Speaker A: Cool. I'm going to do one more intro question, if that's okay. And I want to ask each of you to tell me your favorite, maybe obscure pet peeve of the way the Internet spies on you now. And I'll start I've got one. I know everybody loves Google Maps, but, you know, like, Google Maps is just like making a record of everywhere that you've ever gone. Right. Which just seems horrific to me.
00:04:30.866 - 00:04:32.770, Speaker A: So that's my pet peeve.
00:04:33.110 - 00:05:02.746, Speaker B: So this is not an existing pet peeve. This is, again, something I worry about a lot. Maybe it's a paranoid human, I'm not sure. But I think the dark horse event that we're about to embrace is like, AI and Agi and how that relates to privacy right now, it actually takes effort to scrape your data and to index you and figure out who you are. And with AGI or AI or whatever, the thing that's going to come next or this super intelligence, our privacy is basically gone. And so that, to me, is very scary, unlike many levels of what that means. But, yeah, that's what I think about a lot.
00:05:02.746 - 00:05:07.182, Speaker B: So it's not a current thing, but it's definitely. We might be like two years out.
00:05:07.236 - 00:05:10.720, Speaker A: It's near term. Near term. You're still on SCI-Fi but I'll allow it. All right.
00:05:11.170 - 00:05:42.662, Speaker C: I'm not sure it's my favorite, but there's this whole interesting shadow market of collecting data about people to build reputation and profiles. And one of the interesting uses of this is Airbnb runs a whole system that'll decide whether we want to actually rent you a room or not. Probability you're going to film something or throw a party there. And if you get on that block list, you have absolutely nothing you can do about it and you don't even know how or why or where they got the data from. And yeah, it's an interesting little edge case of the Internet.
00:05:42.726 - 00:05:43.740, Speaker A: That's a good one.
00:05:44.350 - 00:05:55.280, Speaker D: My pet peeve is that it's gotten so bad and nobody I know cares. Everybody is just fine with it. Nobody realizes how much data is being sold of theirs and it's just part of life.
00:05:56.290 - 00:06:28.806, Speaker A: So for the rest of this, I said this, the others, but I'll say it to you, Matthew, I'm just going to ask questions, throw it to one of you, and then ask another question. Unless one of you just jumps in, which I encourage you to do. So we just don't do the down the road thing every time. Okay, so here's my first question for you. Matthew did a good job of talking about the technology that's out there and kind of how everything is working so far. Maybe, Ian, we know Zcash is one, but maybe you can give us one interesting use case of something that's live right now, using zero knowledge technology, I.
00:06:28.828 - 00:06:56.910, Speaker C: Think the other major use case beyond payments is starting to get identity protocols where you can register an account and then later prove something about yourself. So you can convert a us passport into an identity on a blockchain and then go prove to a website that you're, say, over 18 or that you've had the account for this long or any number of things like this. I think there are like four or five protocols that claim to have things live. I have not double clicked on exactly what their definition of live is and if it's.
00:06:59.090 - 00:07:17.606, Speaker A: Cool. Yeah, well, I know kind of along those lines at, I don't know, the crazy town that Vitalik started, their tickets were all zero knowledge, right. It proved that you were allowed in, but it didn't say. I wouldn't say mine was Brady. Right? Yeah, that's a cool example. It's out there. All right, cool.
00:07:17.606 - 00:07:41.758, Speaker A: Anyone else want to jump in on that one? No? All right, cool. So, Elena, I'll ask you this question, because you're the one who's on here representing a company that you're building yourself, but others can jump in, too. What is an interesting near term problem that your team is working on? It feels solvable, but it is a thing that is sort of holding you back right now as you build out what you're working on.
00:07:41.924 - 00:08:11.978, Speaker B: I think we always believe to solve simple problems first and make that a really great user experience and then continue to carry on. Because I think in ZK in particular, people get too excited and they want to build out everything. They want to build their own language model and their own ide and just like, everything, right? And so that is pretty hard for people to kind of grasp. And so for us, it's like, we want to solve payments. Like, how do you send private USDC safely and very easily and in a way that actually makes sense for people. And so for us, we've been made. It launched since April 20 of last year.
00:08:11.978 - 00:08:33.470, Speaker B: Right now, we're working on those bridges. Right now, we're very close to getting to that experience of having a private USDC and then making that experience really solid and understanding. Do people even want privacy? And how do they want privacy? And then kind of going from there? So that is like, maybe three months out, so fairly close, or I shouldn't. Well, engineering roadmaps, but fingers crossed.
00:08:33.810 - 00:08:42.754, Speaker A: I'm curious, are you on the bridge to ironfish? Are you trying to make the bridge, like the fact that you went under the bridge and went over there, are you trying to make that private, too?
00:08:42.952 - 00:09:14.922, Speaker B: No, I mean, every time you're exiting a transparent system into a private system, like the fact that you are depositing money into a privacy pool that will always be public. There are some actually cool ZK bridge ideas, but they require that you kind of own both the minting capabilities of both assets. And that's kind of pretty hard in practice. But yeah, we're trying just to get to private bitcoin experience, private UCC. How do we get to payments or payroll or just any sort of simple experience and do that really well before we move forward and do something more complex.
00:09:15.066 - 00:09:59.466, Speaker A: Okay, cool. And so I feel like an ongoing story here. Well, okay, so stepping know, Matthew talked about how folks just don't super care about this issue broadly. And one of the more depressing stories to me, people could disagree, but that we saw in crypto this year, I mean, it wasn't a major privacy coin, but formerly zencash, then, you know, sort of bragged as it was like this great announcement that they are taking all of the privacy features out of their coin. And I guess it's just a normal coin now. I don't really know, but that's what it was created to do and it took it out. I don't know if it was the greatest one in the world, but whatever was there is now gone, which is not an encouraging sign, I guess.
00:09:59.466 - 00:10:08.320, Speaker A: I'll throw this to you, Matthew. What's your take on that? Will we see more crypto projects that sort of claimed privacy as a feature give up like that?
00:10:09.410 - 00:10:46.806, Speaker D: So I've been talking to some vcs about this, and they are terrified of privacy. And they're terrified of privacy because they see their investment disappearing in a sanctions action, or they see something terrible happening with people sending money to North Korea. And look, that's part of this, right? But maybe the answer, and I don't love this answer, but it's something I've been working on. Maybe the answer is we try to have privacy that answers those questions. Maybe the answer is we try to make privacy that the people who are very afraid of that kind of stuff are comfortable with. And so there are ways to do that. So we got to find a balance.
00:10:46.806 - 00:10:49.562, Speaker D: But it is very worrying to me that that is a thing happening today.
00:10:49.696 - 00:10:55.338, Speaker A: Get a little closer on your mic too, Matthew, if that's okay. Other folks on that mean, I think.
00:10:55.424 - 00:11:20.598, Speaker C: The hard problem, Ron Trump or a colleague of ours had this quote of like, convincing people in blockchains to value privacy is like selling people on seatbelts, in cars, in like 1920, right? You can sort of tell if cars get faster and whatever, you might need them. But right now, it's like, for everything that's on there, it's not quite worth it. And then now with all the risks of sanctions and such, it's like, well, it's really not worth it in a lot of people's eyes. So convincing them to care is quite hard.
00:11:20.684 - 00:11:54.480, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I've seen projects pivot away from privacy to do other things. And so the comparison that I make is that the privacy space is like squid games. Like, you see one project get sanctioned, like, two people pivot in the same several months, and you're like, oh, my God. We literally either have projects that have a really hard time shipping and always delayed their timelines, or we have projects that, again, pivot or get sanctioned. And it's like, crypto has been around for more than ten years now and we still can't get private USDC. So it is very much like a squid game sort of situation. But I think Matthew is correct.
00:11:54.480 - 00:12:42.654, Speaker B: If we build a privacy solution that is safe and that actually addresses questions of sanctions and how do we make sure that malicious actors don't use it, that is the solution that is going to win. And on one hand, yes, crypto is very cyberpunk and very anarchist and very libertarian. That's great, but that is not what's actually going to work here. And at the end of the day, we're not working long hours and putting in all of our efforts into this to help hackers and the bad people of the world. We're making sure that crypto users get kind of the vision that they're promised. So, yeah, so I think it is a very depressing time in privacy right now. But in a weird way, it's also very encouraging because it's like the people that actually stay in privacy and work in privacy, there's very few of them.
00:12:42.654 - 00:12:46.366, Speaker B: They're very mission aligned, and that's really cool to see, too.
00:12:46.548 - 00:13:16.940, Speaker A: Let me push back on one comment you made there a little bit, because I do hear this a lot from folks working on this stuff, isn't it? It's kind of the Manero thesis, right, that we can just push back and eventually it gets big enough and they just won't be able to stop, right? Like, isn't there some argument for folks out there doing that sort of like, hellraising devil may care strategy? Isn't there some chance that that could work out? Or do you guys really think that we should just. That folks, the space should just abandon that approach. Ian, you do that one.
00:13:18.190 - 00:13:54.994, Speaker C: I think it's yet to be seen. There are interesting discussions if the reason Monero sticks around is because it's tolerated or because its privacy is actually weak enough that nobody doesn't actually cause a problem for law enforcement. So this is a dynamic that plays out. There certainly are people who are of the position, we're going to build this thing and just make it big enough and not interact with regulators. And it's like this come and take it attitude. And the flip side is you have people like Matt who have built sort of compliant systems, and I actually don't have an opinion on which one of those is going to work out or which one of them is the right idea. I'm sort of hedging my bets.
00:13:55.122 - 00:14:22.106, Speaker B: I mean, I think for us, we're philosophically aligned and also we're kind of forced to think about how do you protect our privacy? How do we protect ironfish from bad actors? And so morally, I don't want to work on a project that helps the bad actors of the world. And so that feeling kind of aligns with what we're seeing, what makes regulators more comfortable of if we talk to them about how we protect ironfish from sanctioned addresses and so on, we get a much better response.
00:14:22.218 - 00:15:00.726, Speaker A: So let's talk about talking to regulators. A lot of times I think I write about you all's technology, like reasonably okay, but it's not unusual that when I do it, I'll say something that cryptography can do and write something like, trust me, it's sort of like magic. I don't know, it works. That's a line that I default to sometimes. And it's tough to imagine two options for regulators is one, everything's just in plain text and they can read it whenever they want. Or two, you go through this regulated portal and everyone who's on some chain or in some network has been verified, but you've got no friggin clue what's going on inside there. It's all just know it's totally encrypted.
00:15:00.726 - 00:15:10.560, Speaker A: How do you explain that to law enforcement in a way, or to regulators that they believe you? That that's still just as good as everything being in plain text? This is a good Matthew, question.
00:15:11.330 - 00:15:43.434, Speaker D: Oh, wow. Okay. We've kind of come to this weird accommodation where some people believe that this kind of on ramp, off ramp thing is good, but very few people are willing to settle with it. And big part of the problem is we're starting in a different place. We're starting in this place where financial surveillance is the kind of expected law of the land, right? And we're trying to ask them to give all that up. And it's very, very hard to imagine them giving that up, even for something that's partial. And so part of the answer is either make it inevitable, which is kind of what signal did, right.
00:15:43.434 - 00:16:04.100, Speaker D: Signal and its ilk. And WhatsApp just made it so easy to use that one day everyone was using it and liked it and nobody complained. The other option is give them something that gives them the capabilities they want and lets them do more than on ramps and off ramps. And both things have to be tried at the same time. And I think that'll happen. It just takes time.
00:16:05.110 - 00:16:17.586, Speaker A: So, Elena, how do you explain to regulators that you really can trust that your regulated approach, even though a lot of stuff is dark, is trustworthy for the law enforcement folks of the world?
00:16:17.688 - 00:17:31.100, Speaker B: Yeah. So the way we approach it is there's like three ways or three places where you can potentially monitor transactions on the ingress. Like when transactions are going from a transparent chain over to a privacy pool, you can monitor transactions within the privacy pool, although that is extremely hard and kind of impractical, or you can monitor transactions going out of the privacy pool back into a transparent chain. And so when transactions are going from a transparent chain to a privacy pool, like, let's say, ethereum, into ironfish, that is when you have the most information about who is trying to interact with ironfish. And so for us right now, we're working with a bridge operator that is very comfortable saying that we are going to freeze funds if they're going from a sanctioned address or if they're going from an address that is responsible for a DeFi hack, or is it somehow associated with that? And they have a real time threat detection model, and they operate like a non crypto regular company in terms of how they screen transactions and so on. And so that's part of the reason why we worked with that company in particular, is to make sure that no sanctioned address and no bad actor is actually going to get on ironfish. I think when we explain it in very clear terms of, like, look, we are working with a partner who is doing the same exact level of screening that a non crypto company would do when they are screening malicious actors using their product.
00:17:31.100 - 00:17:52.260, Speaker B: And that is the only entryway to ironfish right now. And within ironfish, because we don't have smart contracts, we only kind of have multi asset control. There's not much of the damage that they can do, because then they would have to exit out of ironfish into a transparent chain again. And so I think right now that is resonating. So that's how we explain it.
00:17:52.630 - 00:18:18.682, Speaker C: I think the biggest thing you have to do is you have to explain that there are a bunch of tools that you have, even if you can't see the entire transaction graph and run chain analysis on your blockchain. Because the interesting thing about all these defi hacks is when the money gets stolen, the guys who had it usually notice. And so it's enough to slow down the money. Well, they notice. Eventually somebody flags it. That's the entire thesis. It's not quick.
00:18:18.682 - 00:18:39.378, Speaker C: That's the problem. And this is the whole debate. If you look at things like the anonymity sets, association sets protocols of like, just how much time do we have to say, you have to wait seven days before you bridge the money over into a privacy pool? Or is it 7 hours? Or is it seven minutes? And that entire question is, how long does it take for somebody to notice that this DeFi protocol got hacked and the money moved in?
00:18:39.464 - 00:18:56.070, Speaker D: Can I just add like a coding to that? Which is, it would be amazing if DFI stopped getting hacked. I know that sounds a little facetious, but if DFI kind of cleaned up its act and had better monitoring of something bad happened, 95% of these problems that are being attributed to the privacy protocols wouldn't exist.
00:18:56.890 - 00:19:09.578, Speaker A: I think DFI is, I mean, there's tons of giant hacks that happen, but it's kind of true that DFI protocols that exist for a certain amount of time. If you're a two year old protocol, probably you're not getting hacked anymore. It keeps me in the new.
00:19:09.664 - 00:19:10.022, Speaker D: Right.
00:19:10.096 - 00:19:36.850, Speaker A: Like, anyway, it's probably not really on topic. Right. Oh, and maybe this is for Ian. Maybe you guys will know about this, but how do you all feel? I think it's zcash. And correct me if I'm wrong about this, but I think, didn't zcash implement a thing where certain people, like law enforcement, kind of can peer into the transactions, but most people can't? What's the window thing that they made?
00:19:36.920 - 00:19:45.062, Speaker C: No, there's a view key that you have so you can see your transactions. I wanted to hand that to somebody. They could see the things you.
00:19:45.116 - 00:19:46.502, Speaker A: I'm screwing that up so bad. Okay.
00:19:46.556 - 00:19:47.682, Speaker C: Not a law enforcement window.
00:19:47.746 - 00:19:55.542, Speaker B: Well, actually it was a pretty cool experiment by espresso systems. They're one of the projects that pivoted away from privacy. But one of the projects that they worked on was called Cape.
00:19:55.606 - 00:19:55.978, Speaker A: Okay?
00:19:56.064 - 00:20:31.162, Speaker B: And essentially it allowed a person to make their own privacy asset. So, for instance, circle could make their own private USDC. And then whoever made that asset, in this example, Circle would have a global view key for that asset. And so they would be responsible for monitoring all the transactions. And if something bad happened, they could hand over that global view key over to FBI or law enforcement and so on. Now, the project exists and is open source, but they did pivot away from it. And part of the reason is it's really risky to hold that global fuki.
00:20:31.162 - 00:20:52.560, Speaker B: Nobody really wants that responsibility. And then actually, there's a lot of other complications of, like, okay, if you are in control of whether or not transactions happen or don't happen on your protocol, does that make you an MSB? Like a money transmitter business? And the answer is maybe. And if the answer is yes, then all of a sudden you have a lot more other regulatory requirements. And so no one really wants to touch that.
00:20:53.010 - 00:21:04.666, Speaker A: I'm sorry to any Zcash fans out there for screwing up that feature. Ian corrected me. Somewhere Zuko got very tense and didn't know. So sorry about that. But that was cool. Thanks for clarifying that. And that was a great addendum.
00:21:04.666 - 00:21:05.450, Speaker A: Elena.
00:21:05.610 - 00:21:14.562, Speaker C: I do actually want to point out the idea of we will have a key that can decrypt everything and it will only be held by some trusted party. Who's the good guys? Is a terrible idea.
00:21:14.616 - 00:21:20.150, Speaker A: No, because that key will get stolen. What was that thing they built into phones?
00:21:21.370 - 00:21:28.550, Speaker C: There was the clipper chip you're talking about, which was a number of years ago. Even more relevantly, I guess I'll let you explain this with Juniper.
00:21:29.050 - 00:21:58.180, Speaker D: Yeah, that's a little off topic. I was just going to say, I've talked to a lot of regulators, and the minute you go beyond privacy and you say, okay, who do you want to appoint to give that key to? They panic because it turns out that legally, they have obligations to make sure that people's privacy, like, that's the second part. The Bank Secrecy act is called the Bank Secrecy act. It's the law in the US that gives them access to all this data. But secrecy is a big part of it. And the minute you anoint someone, then you have this terrifying question about how do you keep that information secure? And they do care about that a lot.
00:21:58.790 - 00:22:27.180, Speaker A: So, a thing I'd like to hear you all talk about, because a lot of this stuff does feel a lot like magic. And only a small number of people in the world really understand it. How can a user feel confident that a good privacy protocol out there, a good privacy service, really is honoring the claims it makes just because nobody else can see anything, how can you really know that there isn't someone who has a secret path in there? How can you be confident about that?
00:22:28.990 - 00:22:52.114, Speaker B: I think time, right? None of the privacy protocols have been hacked, per se. And when privacy protocols do fail, it's not the super duper heavy cryptography. It's maybe like the Opsec around it. So, I mean, I think we've had years now of privacy protocols delivering what they promised. And so I think it's just time. But I mean, also like trust and math. I don't know.
00:22:52.232 - 00:22:52.900, Speaker A: Okay.
00:22:53.910 - 00:23:09.702, Speaker C: The privacy protocols that were vetted and people looked at and people said were good, there have also been a number of sort of ones that had much worse guarantees and got broken, but the ones that were like, best of breed, and people said, yes, there was nothing here. We did these security audits. Reputable people talked about them. Yeah. They've delivered on what they've said.
00:23:09.756 - 00:23:31.098, Speaker B: Yeah. And just to add on to that, Zcash did have, quote unquote leaks, but it wasn't in the privacy protocol itself. It was like the wallet for accidentally was pinging something that it shouldn't have, et cetera. So again, it's not the heavy duty technology that was failing. It was like the quote unquote easy stuff around it that maybe engineers weren't paying as much attention to that quote unquote failed.
00:23:31.194 - 00:23:56.550, Speaker A: Let me ask a crazy dumb question. So you build a private blockchain, right? And you publish the code that runs the blockchain. And everyone looks at the code and they're like, yes, this is good and trustworthy, but that's like on GitHub. And they look at it there. How do I know as a user that that's actually what's.
00:23:58.810 - 00:24:02.520, Speaker D: Yeah, you download it, you compile it.
00:24:04.990 - 00:24:07.962, Speaker A: Someone can do that. Some third party can do that.
00:24:08.016 - 00:24:08.826, Speaker D: They should. Yeah.
00:24:08.928 - 00:24:15.614, Speaker A: I mean, every person doesn't need to do it. But if, like you, Matthew Green, go, yes, I downloaded and compiled it myself. This isn't garbage, then.
00:24:15.732 - 00:24:30.718, Speaker D: Yes. And there's a whole system called reproducible builds that basically does, that lets you not only download it, compile it yourself, but you get exactly the same binary that you would have gotten from the App Store. And so you can check on behalf of the other 10 million users or whatever. And that gives people assurance.
00:24:30.814 - 00:24:34.530, Speaker A: Oh, great. That's a great answer. That makes me feel better about the world.
00:24:34.680 - 00:24:42.726, Speaker C: But the follow up question, which none of us know the answer to, is how many projects actually do that? And it certainly is not all of them. I don't know how many. Yeah.
00:24:42.748 - 00:25:03.082, Speaker A: But it's good to know that there is a way and a thing that even people who don't understand normal people can demand that from projects. They can say, know, please do. Yeah. So looking forward, let's have everyone do this. Let's start at Matthew this time. What's everyone excited about in the near term for this technologies in deploying in the world?
00:25:03.216 - 00:25:20.302, Speaker D: Okay, so I think two things are going to happen. One is that we're starting to see people doing private defi and private smart contracts. Those systems are coming online in the next year or two. And some of them are really nice. You can use them. They have great wallets. They're like a whole different level of usability from past systems.
00:25:20.302 - 00:25:42.140, Speaker D: So I think that's huge. And just the thing I want to add to that, other than these new systems coming online, is that we're all in these super early days, right? Everybody here, even 14 years after Nakamoto, right. We're all in the super early days. So it may seem clumsy, you may not want to use some of this tech, but it is getting better really quickly, and it's going to be a lot better in the next few years.
00:25:43.150 - 00:26:25.240, Speaker C: Yeah. So I'm excited that it seems like we're finally starting to see this demand for privacy. We used to use this fictitious example of suppose you wanted to settle payroll on a blockchain and when it was just bitcoin, that was more than a little ridiculous. But now there are actually companies trying to do this on Ethereum and running into the literal like, you paid person a, you paid person b, they found out they get paid more than the other one. So we're starting to get demand. And then on the same side, we're finally getting these more flexible ZK privacy protocols that have like, programmability in them where you can actually do custom assets or custom authorization logic or identity in Kyc in a way that might meet real world requirements in a way that things like Zcash and Tornado cash were a little too awkward and clunky to do.
00:26:26.090 - 00:26:53.850, Speaker B: Yeah, I think for privacy protocols in particular, you do get a hit on user experience. And that's probably what Matthew was alluding to. Like, right now, if you wanted to just figure out your balance, you have to index a. So, like, you couldn't have a metamask and pure experience without losing some of your privacy, for instance. But there are a number of teams that are trying to solve this problem right now. And once we make that experience better, then all of a sudden we can do better. Defi or privacy plus Defi applications.
00:26:53.850 - 00:27:30.518, Speaker B: What I'm personally excited about, we sponsored a hackathon like Azik hackathon, and people did pretty incredible things that they didn't actually expect. Like someone did ironfish transactions using a chat bot, but had spend limits using noir. I was like, whoa, that's amazing. That kind of shows how interoperable these things are and how we can kind of tie them in together. And then another person did private donations to campaigns, which I think in light of Ukraine donations and people actually getting arrested for it in Russia is pretty relevant. And so we're kind of seeing innovation of people using privacy in a very applicable way. And that, to me is very exciting.
00:27:30.518 - 00:27:51.970, Speaker B: The other thing that's really exciting to me is DeFi inherently is very transparent, and there's a lot of things that actually nfts, people want to show off their nfts. And so transparency is actually a feature ad, not a bug, so to speak. And so there's a lot of kind of projects that are doing intermix of private state and public state as how it relates to Defi. That's pretty exciting for me as well.
00:27:52.120 - 00:28:25.830, Speaker A: Another side of cryptography that I think is really cool, that I don't think it's talked about as much, but is the whole signing things, the attestation thing, it's like you can say this came from there or this person did it or whatever, and in the age of AI, we're going to have a lot more crap flowing out onto the Internet. Are we going to be able to get ZK protocols to be fast enough that they could handle signing lots of legitimate stuff and that could get out there and it could verify things quickly enough so you could kind of have an Internet where you could know what's trustworthy and what's not. Matthew, what's your.
00:28:26.000 - 00:28:36.242, Speaker D: Yeah, I think we're going to start to see that tech, and I think the ability to do that cryptographically is a big piece of it. And I hate to say it, I hate to say it, but worldcoin, I hate it.
00:28:36.296 - 00:28:36.562, Speaker A: Wow.
00:28:36.616 - 00:28:45.730, Speaker D: Everything about it, but wow, they at least have figured out some of that stuff and they're using privacy tech. Everything else about it is really scary. And so I'm not in favor.
00:28:45.800 - 00:29:00.774, Speaker A: The problem with Worldcoin is the optics. Yeah. Wait, I want to hear. We got like 1 minute left. Any other thoughts on AI and cryptography from the crew? No. Ian, come mean.
00:29:00.892 - 00:29:28.206, Speaker C: I guess I'll say that I think you're fairly far out from the days of the ZKML. We're going to do a proof of Chat GPT, but that would take a while. On the other hand, might have more simple things. You might have ZK proofs about the origin of a photo that's been active out of research. It turns out we now have signed images from certain sets of professional cameras, and they're active projects looking at how to do like, I know this photo is legitimate and not a deep fake. That's interesting.
00:29:28.308 - 00:29:37.922, Speaker D: But there is a dark side to that, which is that the ability to do things that people don't want you to do, like use your phone the way you want it to do. ZK may be used to prevent that, so we may get even more locked down.
00:29:37.976 - 00:29:39.140, Speaker A: Wait, what do you mean?
00:29:39.910 - 00:29:51.494, Speaker D: Right now we already have our phones locked down by Apple in terms of what we can do with them, but they're not everywhere. But like, ZK may start enforcing more limits on what we can do on our phone inside of the programs. I see this big thing saying wrap up.
00:29:51.532 - 00:30:03.882, Speaker A: Yeah, totally telling us, get out of here. Well, thanks a ton for everyone. Hopefully some aspects of this made you feel a little bit better about the present dystopia that we live in. And like I said, sign up for axios crypto. Thanks, everyone. Bye.
00:30:04.026 - 00:30:04.940, Speaker B: All right, thank you.
