00:00:00.170 - 00:00:08.590, Speaker A: Here at East Denver, aka Sporkdow. And today I have the absolute pleasure and privilege of being joined by Solange from Chainlink. Hi, Solange.
00:00:08.930 - 00:00:10.782, Speaker B: Hi, Derek. How are you?
00:00:10.916 - 00:01:02.858, Speaker A: I'm good. I'm excited to be chatting with you today, not only because I always love learning, and that's one of the most fun parts of being in this community, but because you in particular have been a pretty important part of my journey. You are on a very short list of people that I am very grateful for because I joined the space maybe a year and a half ago. I'm like kind of the 2020 cohort. You know, how, like every bull run, a bunch of people join the space. So I was in the 2020 run, and folks like you and Patrick Collins and Norther Dobbit have been really beacons of what I think strong Devrel and education look like in this space. Because when people talk about web3 being open source, especially at the social layer, they often say things like, yeah, people are just so kind and open and willing to share their knowledge.
00:01:02.858 - 00:01:22.760, Speaker A: And so the open source ethos also applies to the way we treat each other and treat new people, especially. And so you stand out in my heart as somebody that has always been easy to talk to, very friendly, very happy to explain things, even though I've been a complete beginner. So I wanted to say I've been looking forward to this in particular, because I have a lot of gratitude for you.
00:01:23.370 - 00:01:25.960, Speaker B: Thank you, Derek. Wow, this is amazing.
00:01:26.330 - 00:01:57.620, Speaker A: Yeah. Hi, Andre. So, if it's okay with you, Solange, as we go through things, I'll lift up comments or questions that come out of chat. Speaking of which, if you're watching this live, feel free to drop a GM. It feels good. And I'm always curious who's joining us. So, Solange, before we get into what you'd like to share today on the Chainlink side, I am curious, how did you get to the role you're in right now? What kind of a background did you have before this role? Or even before working in web3? What was your winding path to where you are now?
00:01:58.390 - 00:02:51.890, Speaker B: This is so funny. Really funny, because I did computer science more than 20 years ago, but in the year that I finish, I open a dance school, a Baron dance school. So I teach how to dance, brazilian dances like that. And then the dance is at night, and we can work with computer scissors during the day. So I do both for many years, and after a long time doing this, I started, and then I sold the last school. I was only working with databases and so boring. And then I discovered blockchain.
00:02:51.890 - 00:03:00.550, Speaker B: And, wow, this just changed the world. And I'd like to be part of this. And this was 2017.
00:03:02.330 - 00:03:11.480, Speaker A: Like I said, we joined in bull runs. And so you were on that 2017 cohort. Very exciting time. And so how did you end up at chain link?
00:03:12.250 - 00:04:03.900, Speaker B: Yes, chain link. It was so interesting because before that, I love to travel, I love to teach, but I am a developer as well, so how can I merge all of this? I didn't know before that there are a hole that I can do this, and this is be a developer advocate, that what I am on chain link, I discovered this hole in 2019 in RSK, a side chain from bitcoin EVM compatible. And since then, I am a developer advocate. And Chainlink is especially like, I chose Chainlink. I was looking the other companies that I like that make things for me, and I told them, hey, I'd like to work with you. It was a long process, but I did.
00:04:06.750 - 00:04:55.770, Speaker A: Um, I told this story to you before, but I'll say it for the folks that are listening. One time I was chatting with you because I finally got a chance to go to a couple events that were not youth Denver, just to kind of see how the space works. And I started to notice some of the same sponsors and some of the same Devrel people and even some of the same hackers and biddlers going from event to event to event. And I realized like, oh, in some ways, this is kind of like a circus that just goes around the world, and it's a lot of the same people seeing each other just in exciting different countries, like Bogota or Medellin or Paris or whatever. And so when I saw you in San Francisco, I think it was graph hack. I was like, wait, Salon drew here, too. How does this work? And you were like, well, Chainlink has a Devrel team and a developer advocate team, whatever the title is, and we've got a budget to send people around to travel.
00:04:55.770 - 00:05:13.890, Speaker A: And I'm the member of the team that is the most interested and available for that. So I get to use up most of our budget and travel over the course of the year. And I was like, this sounds like a dream job. Just get paid to travel around the world and stand behind the chain link table. But otherwise, just go network and meet people and build stuff. That's really exciting.
00:05:14.550 - 00:05:18.260, Speaker B: Yes, it's exactly this, and I really love to do this.
00:05:19.670 - 00:05:36.200, Speaker A: Yeah. For anyone listening that thinks Web three is cool and is interested in traveling the world, developer relations or developer advocate are positions that include some of that, depending on the, and the budget and the timing and so on.
00:05:36.730 - 00:05:45.900, Speaker B: Yes. You must be a developer and you must have some passion to teach and to bring in new people to this space.
00:05:46.430 - 00:05:55.440, Speaker A: Yeah. Something that I know you and I share pretty deeply. So speaking of which, what can folks look forward to learning today? What are we going to talk about?
00:05:56.210 - 00:05:59.258, Speaker B: Well, today we are talking about oracles.
00:05:59.434 - 00:06:01.870, Speaker A: Can I ask you, is that a baby or a bird?
00:06:04.070 - 00:06:05.460, Speaker B: I have no idea.
00:06:05.910 - 00:06:12.814, Speaker A: How is it your neighbors? Zero knowledge. Zero knowledge.
00:06:12.862 - 00:06:18.130, Speaker B: Okay, let's explain. How can I say this in English? It's a parrot.
00:06:18.290 - 00:06:21.078, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay, great. It seems like a parrot. That makes sense.
00:06:21.164 - 00:06:39.866, Speaker B: My neighborhood has a parrot and this parrot is in love with me. Like, I live here more than five years and when I am teaching, doing live classes, he is hearing my voice now. So he would like to.
00:06:39.888 - 00:06:43.726, Speaker A: He gets excited. He's encouraging you.
00:06:43.908 - 00:06:55.810, Speaker B: Yes, and I know that exactly in this moment, my husband go downstairs to give you some cookies, something to him to be quiet.
00:06:57.750 - 00:07:04.660, Speaker A: I'm so happy I asked. Thank you for explaining. Okay, do you know the parrot's name?
00:07:06.070 - 00:07:22.290, Speaker B: No, I don't know if he has a name. We call them like because Lodo is like a kind of favorite in Brazil.
00:07:22.450 - 00:07:30.380, Speaker A: Okay, so the loto's here, I'm here, you're here, and we've got a bunch of people excited to learn today. What are we going to talk about?
00:07:31.090 - 00:08:06.278, Speaker B: Yes, so let's talk about. And, well, I can tell all the people that Jesus is like a small part that you can learn in the camp build in David. I'm so excited and I share my screen now and start to talk. I have some content that I can do like a hands on session or only the theory are you start with the concepts and let's see what happens later. Okay.
00:08:06.364 - 00:08:22.670, Speaker A: Okay. And as we go through this, folks feel free to ask all kinds of questions. We are happy to explain any words you're not familiar with or acronyms or if you see a word that you've seen used in other contexts. But it doesn't make sense here. Feel free to ask. The whole reason we do this live is so that it can be a little more conversational.
00:08:23.650 - 00:08:43.442, Speaker B: Exactly. This is really amazing. And let's go, let's share my screen. Okay. Where I am, I lost my screen. Okay, here and yes, I have two screens. You are here and I share the order screen.
00:08:43.442 - 00:08:43.858, Speaker B: Okay.
00:08:43.944 - 00:08:47.266, Speaker A: Okay, great. Did you find the share screen button here in the studio?
00:08:47.378 - 00:08:48.550, Speaker B: Yes, I find it.
00:08:48.620 - 00:08:49.414, Speaker A: Okay, great.
00:08:49.532 - 00:08:52.198, Speaker B: I didn't find the other screen, but now it's good.
00:08:52.364 - 00:08:55.334, Speaker A: Great. And three, two, one, go. There we go.
00:08:55.372 - 00:08:59.078, Speaker B: Yes, here we go.
00:08:59.084 - 00:09:00.730, Speaker A: Let's get intimate. Boom.
00:09:01.230 - 00:09:01.978, Speaker B: Yes.
00:09:02.144 - 00:09:03.340, Speaker A: Okay, we're ready.
00:09:03.710 - 00:09:35.874, Speaker B: Here we are. So this is me, my name is Alejia Gabriel. The people know me by soul and you already know that I am a developer advocate at chaining clubs. Here are my contacts and at the end I can open my website that I used to add all the talks that I'm doing in Portuguese, English and Spanish. Some of them have videos like this. You'll be there later and you can see the others. And I am brazilian.
00:09:35.874 - 00:10:30.398, Speaker B: Yes, I am Brazil just now and counting the days to go to the soon. Yes, if you'd like to read this care code. This is a basket website that we have related to education. Basic concepts like I can share like smart context, oracles, NFTs, defi. So I think it's so important to our first to have these basic concepts. I know that Audi's live classes is to these and if you can hear more and read more I'm pretty sure that this will help you. So let's come back here again and 2 seconds to you to get this and this.
00:10:30.398 - 00:11:05.410, Speaker B: Let's go. So first of all, let's talk about Oracle's fundamentals. And before that, I know that you already know this, but let's be sure what are smart contracts? Think that smart contracts are computer programs that they are publishing and they run in a blockchain environment in an automobile way. It means that when they are triggered or when they are colored, they don't have it intermediates. And this is immutable because we are in blockchain.
00:11:05.990 - 00:11:31.546, Speaker A: Okay, so they're like a function or a set of functions that exist and that's the autonomously part is when you call it, then nobody is sitting there, there's no human that we're waiting for to click. Okay, allow them to do it. It just exists there as something you can interact with. You don't need to ask for permission to send one ETH from your wallet to someone else's or to interact with like an NFT mint for example.
00:11:31.728 - 00:12:30.038, Speaker B: Yes, and amazing because important to understand that it's autonomous. But we must trigger them, we must call some function in the smart contract. What can I say? If you must receive a payment in the first day of the month, the smart content by itself, he didn't know when is the first day of the month. So someone must call the smart content because of this. I used to put this part, another part that I can comment here that is so interesting as well, it's about the immutability because the people sometimes did some mistakes related to this. What is immutable in ismat contract? The code, the source code, the definition of the contract. After we publish this on blockchain, we cannot change it.
00:12:30.038 - 00:13:16.940, Speaker B: We can publish another and say that we are changing the version and going to a different address, something like that. But the code that was published cannot change anymore. In the other way, we can change the data that is inside the content. If you create some functions to do this. So I can have as much content that has a function to save some information over there. And in this way I can change this information, but I cannot change this service, the smart context itself. So let's go.
00:13:16.940 - 00:14:20.880, Speaker B: When we talk about smart context, I really believe on this that the smart context will solve the problems in the society related to trust. So the idea is that we can trust in the cryptography, we can trust in the smart content, but not in the paper, not exactly in the people, something like that. Because when we are talking about paper guarantees, we have the counterpart risk and not exactly, Jesus, transparent like you must trust in a logo, an Amy. And when we are talking about cryptography guarantees, we are talking about mess. So the counterparty risk is low. The smart contract is transparent. It's in the blockchain and it's better.
00:14:20.880 - 00:15:30.098, Speaker B: And like I said before, I already told you, one limitation of these match contents. But there are limitations in these match contents. And in fact, one of the challenges is how can we connect these match contents and that we call it the on chain information, on chain data. And the information that is off chain that is outside that the reaward data and events. This is a challenge to the smart context. And another point and why this is a challenge. For example, if I try to query an API that is in the outside smart concrete, when the nodes are trying to get the consensus, they must call this API again and they can get different results.
00:15:30.098 - 00:16:17.650, Speaker B: So if we are calling information that it's off chain, we cannot have a guarantee that this information will be always the same. So we cannot say that this is deterministic and this is one of the challenges. We cannot have the consensus outside the blockchain. And let's see, how is it possible to solve this. Let's see. And thinking about the connections that I was telling before to the blockchain makes sense. We must be in the world, so we must be connected with market data, events, payments, banks.
00:16:17.650 - 00:17:07.800, Speaker B: We really must have this. And the solution to this are the blockchain oracles. So what is our oracle? It's any device that interacts with the off chain word. And we used to have these two different purposes. One, provide external data to use to consume as much content or to provide computation for as much content. We know that it's hard to do like complex computation inside as much content, you will be out of gas. So sometimes you need to do this outside and bring the results to the ismatch content in a way that we can trust on this.
00:17:07.800 - 00:18:32.240, Speaker B: And we can say that oracles are any data services or any external resources like I put here, like related to watch or a football game, some information from market stocks, weather quotes of fiat money. And we have a lot of things that we can use here. But when we talk about Oracles, what happens if we have a centralized oracle? It means that the information you come from this one service and this can be a point of failure. And think about when we already know that there's much content, it's immutable. When you put information as much content, you be saved in a transaction, even if you try to change the information, like I told you before, I can create a function for this, but every time that I try to change this information, I miss sending a new transaction to the blockchain. So everything is hashtag. We have the history of everything.
00:18:32.240 - 00:18:51.000, Speaker B: So the input of the information inside the blockchain, it's so important. And here is the point. If we are trusting in a centralized point to bring this information, this can be not so good.
00:18:51.370 - 00:20:00.618, Speaker A: Yeah, it could be manipulated or compromised or just go offline or any number of problems. I think the analogy here for folks where this maybe isn't clicking the importance of this fully yet is to think over the past year, how many examples of centralized exchanges going under FTX being the more newsworthy example recently, but many, even just in the few months before it. If you're relying upon a third party service, a single entity like an FTX, and giving them your actual money and saying, okay, so you're going to help me hold crypto, right? And they're, yeah, yeah, trust us, we're a single point of not failure. And then cut two, you're like, okay, can I have my money now? And they're like, we didn't actually have it. So that is sort of missing the entire point of using a decentralized network in a trust minimized environment. If you're having all these trust assumptions on this one single point, this organization, that if there's any, an employee hack or any number of vulnerabilities that only exist there and not for the entire network. Then in that one choice, you've lost the entire benefit of working in a system like this.
00:20:00.618 - 00:20:27.160, Speaker A: So for that same reason, if you're trying to query the ETH USD price off chain, I know now we have like liquidity pools we kind of use with stablecoins, but if you're trying to query the temperature or the time or something that exists fully off chain, don't just have one single point of failure, because then you've sort of ruined the entire point. So if that's something we want to make sure to avoid, Solange, how do we do it?
00:20:27.850 - 00:21:28.710, Speaker B: Yes, let's go to a decentralized oracle network. This is the idea. So we can get the real world data with a network of nodes, not only one node, and bring the information to any blockchain. And in the same way we can provide the information that will have some kind of consensus to the real world. Again. And this is so what's a decentralized oracle network? We are talking about to have full applicants that are running by independent and CB resistant node operators, and they must have some consensus about a computation can be like a code, can be weather data, stuff like that. So this network of nodes is not a blockchain.
00:21:28.710 - 00:22:16.934, Speaker B: It's so important that this is only a network of nodes that they have their own consensus. They agree in the information that they are providing, and this is focused on data validation and the consensus about the off chain values to make them reliable to trigger the context, to be used in smart context and when talk about chain link, so interesting, because these node operators, they are security reviewed in order to have, like you said before, we cannot trust in one node, but we are reviewing all of them to try to trust in most part of them and to have a consensus of this.
00:22:17.052 - 00:22:20.540, Speaker A: Wait, I can't just run 20 nodes and pretend I'm 20 different people.
00:22:22.030 - 00:22:25.286, Speaker B: I hope that this is better that only one node.
00:22:25.478 - 00:22:29.338, Speaker A: Okay, I'm surprised by how civil resistant it is. I wasn't aware of that.
00:22:29.504 - 00:23:39.134, Speaker B: Yeah, and I will show later, that depends of the information. We must have more or less nodes, for example. This is interesting, and here are some examples related to these, again, related towards data services that we can use in a centralized oracle network. And you must think about the quality of data, the origin proofs, how this data is delivered, and the validation of this. If we have some crypto economic guarantees related to this, like why these nodes are running these, can they be not civil resistance stuff like that, and about data privacy as well. So it must take care of these points in consideration. So I put this in the middle because when I'm doing some presentation the people used to be so courious.
00:23:39.134 - 00:23:51.480, Speaker B: So get 2 seconds to read this care code and this is my presentation. I just send you a dang again, but let's share that the people can get it.
00:23:51.930 - 00:23:55.160, Speaker A: It's very sweet of you, thank you. I've never seen someone do that.
00:23:58.410 - 00:24:25.146, Speaker B: So let's go. If you didn't get it now at the end I'll show you again. And when I talk about our g's, maybe you will hear about a different name. It's hybrid or it's hybrid. I don't know how to say this word. Hybrid. Smart content and this is the kind of smart contract that has this kind of connection.
00:24:25.146 - 00:25:55.066, Speaker B: So these smart content are using oracles to get the information from the external world, from the off chain data and computation. And this is the idea to bring to the smart context this kind of connection with the decentralized networks and how we can use this inside the smart context. And here I had some use cases that probably some of you already know, but we need information from the off chain world in decentralized finance, gaming, nfts, enterprise systems, insurance, governance and whatever. We have a lot of use case for this. And okay, when we have this kind of connection we can interact and connect everything. This is the idea, including connect different networks for example, and all of this. And is this talking a bit more about Chainlink? So Chainlink, it's like one of the solutions for connecting the smart context to the off chain data and Chainlink is blockchain aginoski.
00:25:55.066 - 00:27:00.420, Speaker B: So we can have the chainlink network implemented in different blockchains. Like today we have GZ on Ethereum, it's the biggest, but ours in Polygon, moonbeam, avalanche and others, including one part for example in Solana. So we really can be in different chain link. Now Chainlink is so big and it's been the standard for our oracle network. I'm so proud to be on Chainlink because they work in a way that is so professional to be this referencing to take care of our aspects that we need to have when we talk about oracles. So I already talked about the quality of data services. I will not talk again.
00:27:00.420 - 00:27:39.290, Speaker B: This is important. So when we talk about chain link, we are talking about we can say products or services but we have different of them. And I will explain a bit more of each of them. For example market and data feeds. I will show you a bit. We have the VRF and this is generator for Randall numbers, the proof of reserve, for example. This is so interesting that you can prove that summary reserve that is off chain or even on chaining another blockchain exists and use it using your smart content or the automation.
00:27:39.290 - 00:28:31.322, Speaker B: I will talk a bit more about each of these. First of all, the Chainlink data fits. The Chainlink data fits was the first service created by Chainlink. And this basically is the code of assets that we can use. And you use this especially in Defi and in so many different decentralized Oracle networks. And the idea is to get data and asset prices in your smart content from the external services. We have the full market coverage, not from decentralized exchanges, but some centralized exchanges as well that are providing the quotes and the chaining.
00:28:31.322 - 00:29:09.290, Speaker B: Review them. And the information that we have here when we talk about values quotes, is the volume based average matched. And we have it using many, many blockchains. I will show a bit about this because I'm going to this link now. Data chain link, let's go. This is the data feed that we can see. For example, if I'd like to know the code of Ethereum with USD, I can see in the mainnet in Polygon.
00:29:09.290 - 00:29:50.700, Speaker B: Let's see more. I open one of these and I'd like to show the difference for you. For example, I am on Ethereum and you can see here that we must have at least 21 nodes. Now we have 31, and you can see that all of them are going. So they are providing the data in a good way. No one is offline, no one is providing a data that is so different than the others. Something like that.
00:29:50.700 - 00:30:20.386, Speaker B: If I go to polygon, for example, in polygon the minimum is eleven and we have 16. So it's a bit different. Depends of the chain. It depends the blockchain you are using. And you have different requirements. One point interesting is that each of these is a smart contract. So we have one smart contract that has the aggregator of this.
00:30:20.386 - 00:30:47.740, Speaker B: So we are talking about a term aggregator and the aggregator. You put the information of each of this and the average code of this, and this is for both. We can see here, including what's happened with the nodes. This is interesting. So let's come back here.
00:30:49.630 - 00:31:19.366, Speaker A: I have a question. We were talking a moment about single points of failure. So as these 31 nodes on ETH main net are speaking to each other. So sad. The screenshots when ETH was over 3000, that's how it always goes when they report their data. And then there's some kind of average. And then that average ends up being stored in that block in the smart contract on ETH main net so that other contracts can query it.
00:31:19.366 - 00:31:33.580, Speaker A: Can we zoom in a little on the in between there is it that all 31 nodes are reporting to some centralized chain link server which then updates the contract. How can we be sure that there's nothing happening in between?
00:31:35.230 - 00:32:21.306, Speaker B: Yes. I didn't put this here, but we have a concept of OCR to report this. Before it was each of the nodes that are saving the values because the values are saving in ismatch content. So when this is saving the smart content, we have the value of each source. So like the address and the value that they provide and then we have the average of this. So the point can be like when this information is saved in the blockchain, but this is monitored so this is difficult to happen.
00:32:21.488 - 00:32:22.220, Speaker A: Okay.
00:32:22.750 - 00:32:57.630, Speaker B: Yeah, and you already have my slide, so I put a lot of links that you can click and you can understand better this part. And also I'm not doing this now, but in our documentation you have an example to use on remix one button, go to remix and deploy and test it. I love this. You do a lot of this in our camp with remix.
00:32:57.790 - 00:33:10.220, Speaker A: Looking forward to camp middle remix is very beginner friendly for folks that have zero programming experience or computer science experience. If I could figure it out, you could figure it out. And if you have any questions, Solange and I are here to help.
00:33:10.590 - 00:33:42.466, Speaker B: Yes. Oh, let's tell a small history for you. I started my year doing a boot camp online in Portuguese here in Brazil. And I use remix like in five classes of 2 hours each. And we have more than 200 brazilian students doing as much content, including a lot of people that told me, hey, I'm not a developer and I could do this. I'm so happy. So I'm happy with them as well.
00:33:42.648 - 00:34:05.660, Speaker A: Wow. Yeah. A lot of gratitude, because I believe remix is maintained by the Ethereum foundation. Right. So to come back to how we started this, the open source ethos of the space, it means a lot to me that we have amazing tooling like that. That's specifically for beginners being maintained by the Ethereum foundation, putting their money where their mouth is and saying, we want to onboard folks, to web3 and make that an easy process.
00:34:06.350 - 00:34:49.130, Speaker B: Yes, this is so important it starts again. So let's talk about the proof of reserve. This became more important last year exactly after FTX, because this is a way that you can prove what you have, what the exchange have. We know that in some cases the problem is not what they have, but exactly what they are doing with the other party. What the commitment. But this can help a bit. And the idea is to prove on chain the collateralization of assets.
00:34:49.130 - 00:35:53.550, Speaker B: And this can help insolvency risks and the transfers for the users. Or like prevent system fails in Defi. For example ICU HMAT content last year. That is checking the amount of the reserves of bitcoin that bitigo has. Because they are the owner of the BC on Ethereum, one of the assets that we have. And then I can say how many bitcoins they minted in the ethereum network and how many they have in the bitcoin network and compare. If in some moment they minted more than they have in collateral, and I have as much content that are using this, I will stop my content like this is risky.
00:35:53.550 - 00:37:08.150, Speaker B: So something like that. And how this works, this is a bit tricky because we are trusting in an institution, or can be an institution like if you need the information from a bank, but can be another chain that we have a network of nodes that is getting the information send to as much content and your smart content, your decentralized application can read this and use this. And here I put some examples that we have. I was talking about the WPC and these are the resources. So let's talk a bit more now about the VRF. So what is VRF? We are talking about verifiable random numbers basically. And what is this? And first, why we need this? Why it's hard to get randomness with smart context.
00:37:08.150 - 00:38:01.750, Speaker B: Remember that I start telling you that blockchain is determined. So we are talking about the perfect prediction. So if you have a rule inside your smart context to generate a random number, when you are sending a transaction like the node can manipulate this, the node who is validating this. So this can be a point of failure. So if you like that, the participants can control the entry, if they know what's the rule before go to the network. The Inc can be wrong. And the idea of the chain kvrf, it's an external network of nodes that is providing these random numbers.
00:38:01.750 - 00:39:29.054, Speaker B: You ask a number or two or three or whatever. And the network you provided this for you, and you have this in a transaction and you can prove that you can check like the nodes and be sure that this was really random numbers. And where we use the random numbers, we can use for example in NFTs to generate different parts. For example, different heads, different hats, different weapons, eyes, wherever you can have different characteristics using the VRF and is used as well, for example in battles to define who you won, who you lost, something like that. I have an example that I will not do today. Maybe in the boot camp, like we have a game that you have some character that you jump around the world and how many kilometers it is jumping is defined by the VRF for example. And if you'd like to test the VRF later by yourself, the VRF, it has a manager.
00:39:29.054 - 00:40:05.662, Speaker B: So you first create like your account and you would put some link token over there and then you will hash the match content and your smart contract can consume from this account. And talking about this, it's important because when we was talking before related to data feeds, you don't need to pay to use your data feed. You are doing a query to do this like the nodes and they are interface provided this information to us.
00:40:05.796 - 00:40:09.854, Speaker A: It's basically a public good that anyone can use as much as they want.
00:40:10.052 - 00:40:21.406, Speaker B: Exactly. But in this case you are interesting having this number. So you need to pay to have this. So this is a different approach.
00:40:21.598 - 00:40:38.300, Speaker A: Sure, yeah. I mean just to really spell it out. This is part of how web3 lets us use things like tokenomics to be able to incentivize certain behavior. If you want someone to have their computer generate a random number for you, then you're going to pay them some link token to be able to do that because that costs them electricity and so on.
00:40:38.670 - 00:41:55.360, Speaker B: Exactly. So here we are, you can click in any of these resources layers and in the same way I put the QR code of the documentation we have remix mesh key button to open remix and create as much content for you. And the next product that I like to talk is the chain link automation. And first why we needed the chain link automation. Remember that I told you in the beginning that these match contents are not self executing, they are passive agents, so they cannot start alone a process or cow its functions from time to time or to check conditions. And we used to say that we have the changes of the state of the blockchain or it means the change in the state of smart content. This only happened when a transaction is initiated by an external account and can be a user oracle or there is much content.
00:41:55.360 - 00:43:02.950, Speaker B: And this is the chain link automation is here to solve this. We are talking about a decentralized match concentralized network of nodes and they are rewarded for running the hashtag process that we call it upkeeps. So while you create my contact, then you go to the automation network and you has my contact in this network. Since then the network you check my contract. And if some condition that I define it is true, the network you execute wherever I do like to do. And I love this picture like we have here, automation before was called keepers. Okay? Sometimes you see the name keepers because of this.
00:43:02.950 - 00:44:26.578, Speaker B: So the keepers nodes, this network, you simulate a function called checkup keep. Your concept must have this function, and when they simulate this, the result is true. The network you simulated, another function, call it upkeep, perform upkeep, and then this, you update your content, change something, yoursmatch content, and like this. Imagine that if you don't have this kind of decentralized network, okay, you can create your job, your bot on Amazon, but you must trust on Amazon or wherever or any cloud service or even in your computer, in your home that don't have power, for example. So this is a great way to have a decentralized network of nodes working to you and guaranteeing the rules of your contract. And this is what I was telling before. We have the simulation of checkup keep, and if this is true, we have the simulation of the performer keep.
00:44:26.578 - 00:45:21.746, Speaker B: And only if the simulation of the execution is true, the transaction will be sent to the blockchain. So you only pay to do this when everything is true, everything is good and you are paying using link as well, and a part of the link, you'll be converted to it to pay the gas to execute this function. In the same way, I put here another care code if you'd like to test it. We have here example how you can create compatible content to use the automation and the documentation. I will not do the hands on part. I think it will be more than 15 minutes. So let's go.
00:45:21.746 - 00:45:27.240, Speaker B: It's supposed to be a dynamic NFT, but I promise that I do this in the boot camp.
00:45:27.690 - 00:45:28.440, Speaker A: Okay.
00:45:29.450 - 00:45:45.020, Speaker B: And I need to tell you something so important. So important, I cannot tell exactly what, but I can tell you that we are launching a new product during the boot camp. During the camp?
00:45:46.030 - 00:45:47.130, Speaker A: During September.
00:45:47.790 - 00:45:55.200, Speaker B: Yes, exactly. And our students in the camp, you'll be the first students to use this.
00:45:55.810 - 00:46:08.260, Speaker A: What is it? This is so rude. Can you tell me anything about it? I mean, it's from Chainlink, so presumably it has to do with some kind of off chain computation that we've been yearning for in the space.
00:46:08.790 - 00:46:23.718, Speaker B: Exactly. Think that we talk about codes, but probably we need more resources to use other kind of computation and other kind of data.
00:46:23.884 - 00:46:45.360, Speaker A: And probably, I'm going to say, because NFTs have been hot, it's going to be related to the real world data of GPs for example, maybe it'll solve the use case. Knowing where people are and being able to verify in a trustless way when people do certain actions off chain so that we can have that trigger smart contracts in some way.
00:46:46.290 - 00:46:46.990, Speaker B: Maybe.
00:46:47.140 - 00:46:47.454, Speaker A: No.
00:46:47.492 - 00:46:47.694, Speaker B: Okay.
00:46:47.732 - 00:46:48.800, Speaker A: That wasn't it.
00:46:51.010 - 00:47:04.100, Speaker B: Yes. If you didn't apply it to our boot camp, I really recommend you to do this because you will learn, our students, you learn things first of everyone. It will be amazing.
00:47:04.970 - 00:47:10.690, Speaker A: Yes. When you're done with your slides, I'll show them how they can apply if they're still curious.
00:47:10.850 - 00:47:36.910, Speaker B: Perfect. And again, this is the presentation. You can have some seconds more to try to read the care code. And I think it's this. Okay. You have here the documentation. Here are my contacts again.
00:47:36.910 - 00:48:03.270, Speaker B: Oh, I promise you that. The last thing that I shared. So this is my website and choose your language and go to events. And you can see like, this is my event since 2019. I think I didn't put 2018 before, but you can see what I did in English, spanish and portuguese and Bifun.
00:48:04.890 - 00:48:05.640, Speaker A: Wow.
00:48:07.390 - 00:48:19.610, Speaker B: Yes. If you go here, I started in Portuguese. So portuguese. In the five years, four years, I did more than 200 events.
00:48:22.930 - 00:48:27.680, Speaker A: That's a lot. The portuguese blockchain community is very lucky that you're out here doing all this work.
00:48:28.610 - 00:48:36.690, Speaker B: Yes, I'm proud to be here. I try to stop. Yes.
00:48:36.760 - 00:49:08.730, Speaker A: Okay, great. And then I'll go ahead and remind folks that this year, ETH Denver is having its first camp biddle program during ETH Denver on site. It is starting February 24, just like Biddle week is. And for folks that don't know about it, this is a program for noobs. No web3 knowledge, no smart contract knowledge. We are assuming you are not a computer scientist. We are truly trying to bring in folks like myself that are transitioning from a completely different career or job or just curious and want to learn a lot more.
00:49:08.730 - 00:50:17.058, Speaker A: We are running camp biddle. Chainlink is powering this both financially and also in terms of curriculum and the instructor power behind the scenes, making sure this is an incredible curriculum. I think the thing I'm most proud and excited about is that the folks that are coming get to specialize in one of four different tracks. In the beginning, I'll learn a little bit of everything. So that way you know what the other people on your team at East Denver or other people at a team in a web3 project, you're contributing to what they do, what it means when they say, I'm going to merge the pull request for the smart contract code to GitHub if you don't know what those words mean, you'll know what they mean after two days. And then in the next four days, you go much deeper, either learning about smart contracts, front ends, community and marketing, or design. I am in particular excited for the design track because I want to see if we can push forward the basic principles of design and some common sense thinking to make the Dapps that we use day in and day out a little more user friendly and think a little bit harder about onboarding folks that are new to the space.
00:50:17.058 - 00:51:01.438, Speaker A: Because we are getting more and more people in the space every year and we're still in that very early, rough around the edges kind of phase where it's really easy to accidentally sign a message. I mean, Kevin Rose of moonbirds, if I'm not mistaken, there was a very sophisticated, targeted attack on him recently where he just signed a message. It wasn't even a transaction, but it was an exploit that allowed the person to basically take a bunch of NFTs that he'd given permission to on Opensea from him. And that was many, many thousands of dollars worth of stuff lost just from one person. In other words, you still got to be very careful in this space. The UX is tough and there is no undo button. There is no customer support to call when it comes to on chain stuff.
00:51:01.438 - 00:51:40.234, Speaker A: So I understand. I'm sympathetic to folks that use centralized exchanges because there's less risk of making a mistake yourself. But then you take on the risk of them being a bad actor, which unfortunately, we've seen happens. So if you want to help build some of that infrastructure and make web3 a better place for folks over the next few years, or even just over the next couple of weeks, apply to campbiddle@ethdenver.com. Campbiddle. We still have some spots available, so if you apply today, you might just get lucky. We're already at a list, and if any more spots open up, I would be very excited to see the folks watching.
00:51:40.234 - 00:52:13.830, Speaker A: And if you can't come, tell your friend, if you know anyone that would be a good fit for the program. In other words, they're going to be at ETH Denver and they want to learn more. Tell them, because we're putting in a lot of work to make this great. Specifically, Solange, I think, Solange, this is in many ways your brainchild. This is an evolution of things that you've done before. So I want to thank you for championing this idea and always being a champion of Noobs. Like I said in the beginning, noobs like me, I got where I am largely due to not just the content that you put out and the technical knowledge, but just that spirit of, like, you can do it.
00:52:13.830 - 00:52:40.254, Speaker A: You belong. We can do it together. Let me know if you need help. So I know I'm speaking for both Solange and myself and countless other people in the space when I say, whatever your journey is, whatever you want to learn, whatever you want to do, we are here to support you. You can find us on Twitter, you can find us in discord, you can find us at East Denver. Just come say hi. We are truly happy to support because I don't know, Solange, if you agree with this, in many ways it feels like we've made it.
00:52:40.254 - 00:53:10.810, Speaker A: Like, I feel very grateful to be in a position where I can be a part of a cool organization, doing interesting things and getting to coordinate with interesting people. And so I just want to spend the rest of my life helping other people make it and helping other people accomplish their dreams and biddle the things that are in their hearts and minds. So I'm curious, what would you say to folks that are kind of on the fence, like interested in web3 and in crypto? But I don't really understand it. I still feel like an imposter. I don't know where to start. Do you have any advice that you give to people that are curious?
00:53:11.790 - 00:53:48.838, Speaker B: Well, I think, I'm pretty sure that if you came into the camp, you will learn. And I used to make how people create your first inmate content. Doesn't matter if you are a developer or no. If you know how to copy and paste, you can create your first match content and understand. What is this? Remember, when you are creating your content, you are creating something that you'll be forever in the blockchain. It's like to writing the stars. So this is really amazing.
00:53:48.838 - 00:54:12.800, Speaker B: And I'm pretty sure that to be in the blockchain world, in the web3 space, make difference in our lives and we can be better. We can trust more in decentralized systems, not only on brains. And this is so important to us. And I'd like to help everyone to be here.
00:54:14.530 - 00:54:27.874, Speaker A: Yep, just this. Where can folks find you on twitter or elsewhere if they want to follow up with you? I know you showed it on your slides a moment ago, but if you could just reiterate for folks that want to get in touch with you, this is interesting.
00:54:27.992 - 00:54:41.558, Speaker B: I already put in my name what's my handle? And this is my handle in every network. And be careful. For example, if you find like Instagram with something in the middle is not me.
00:54:41.644 - 00:54:44.214, Speaker A: No underscores in the beginning, middle, or end.
00:54:44.332 - 00:54:48.570, Speaker B: Exactly. Even any network.
00:54:48.910 - 00:54:52.460, Speaker A: No link, token, airdrop, DM no.
00:54:54.670 - 00:55:07.040, Speaker B: We don't have a drop. The only way to stake link is in the official website and disclose it. It's finishing 4 hours like past year. Wait the next.
00:55:08.050 - 00:55:14.190, Speaker A: Great. Well, thank you so much for your time, Solange. Anything else you'd like to say to folks before we say goodbye?
00:55:14.770 - 00:55:17.230, Speaker B: Oh, I hope to see you in naver, guys.
00:55:17.380 - 00:55:26.070, Speaker A: Yep. If you see either of us, come on up and say hi. Solange, please join me in what I ask every guest to do embarrassingly, which is give everyone a big bye.
