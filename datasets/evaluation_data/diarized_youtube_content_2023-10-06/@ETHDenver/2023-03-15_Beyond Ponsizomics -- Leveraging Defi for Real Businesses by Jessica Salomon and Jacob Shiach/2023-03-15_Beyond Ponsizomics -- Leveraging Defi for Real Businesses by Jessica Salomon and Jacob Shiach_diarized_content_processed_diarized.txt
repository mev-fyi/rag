00:00:00.170 - 00:00:07.338, Speaker A: Up the chill hip hop ambient music we have going on here. My name is Jess Solomon.
00:00:07.514 - 00:00:10.634, Speaker B: This is Jacob Shea.
00:00:10.762 - 00:00:52.002, Speaker A: Jacob Shea. We're super excited to be chatting here. This is going to be a little bit of a change of pace. I know that all y'all are busy beetling. We're going to have a bit of a conversation, a thought we hope, or as thoughtful as it can be, given that I tore my calf about 36 hours ago and I'm on some pain medication, but we're doing pretty well. So, yeah, the title of this fireside chat is beyond ponzenomics, leveraging DFI for real biz, just to give a little bit of background about myself. My name is Jess Solomon.
00:00:52.002 - 00:01:35.526, Speaker A: I started out my journey in web3 as the first community manager at Makerdao, so starting at the launch of single collateral die in December 2017. Since then, I moved around a bit between maker, between marketing Biz, like bd, stuff like that, and then started working on an array of fun web3 stuff. As we can see, the space has really grown here. East Denver was actually the first hackathon I ever went to in 2018, including nfts and some cosmos stuff, too. Who knows? But Jacob, on the other hand, do you want to give a little bit of background about yourself and your awesome journey?
00:01:35.718 - 00:02:23.530, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So I've been working on this project called Union for about three years now. We're trying to solve what we kind of have solved, basically credit. So unsecured credit, which if anyone's familiar with unsecured credit, it's about as highly leveraged as you can get. But it's also kind of a useful tool in kind of actual business. So you either have a very important tool for ensuring operating leverage, or you have a tool that can just enable infinite leverage. So we're trying to not go the infinite leverage for a speculation route, which has caused us to kind of do a lot of research and focus in on what are the actual real economy, use cases of Defi.
00:02:23.530 - 00:02:26.858, Speaker B: And that's kind of where we are right now.
00:02:27.024 - 00:02:45.246, Speaker A: Yeah, super awesome stuff. So just to sort of start out, Jacob, because you are the brainiac here, how would we define Ponzi nomics in this situation? And what are some examples and maybe real world versus web3 world.
00:02:45.428 - 00:03:09.078, Speaker B: Yeah. So just to bring up the Webster's dictionary. So you have real economy, which is not a judgment on finance, isn't real economy. It's just. They're just terms. So you have real economy, which is anything where it's like buying and selling. So it's like the consumption and production of goods and services.
00:03:09.078 - 00:04:14.270, Speaker B: So if you don't have a consumption or a production of a good, you're probably in the financial economy, which is just kind of buying and selling things. It doesn't really matter what the thing is because all that you really care about is being able to sell it off. And so this can kind of, you need the financial economy to kind of have a liquid and highly efficient real economy. But sometimes the financial economy kind of gets ahead of its skis and this is where you end up with things like, my favorite example is the recent issue with the West Texas index where oil ended up trading negative. It's because a lot of people basically, like demand for oil dropped so much so that a lot of people who are just kind of trading these oil futures kind of got a very hard lesson that, oh, you have to actually take delivery of the oil and you have to show up in Oklahoma at the end of the pipeline with a truck.
00:04:15.810 - 00:04:28.210, Speaker A: Right. So there can really only be so much speculation because in the end of the day, if there should be a real product underneath these oil futures.
00:04:28.550 - 00:04:46.230, Speaker B: Yeah, crypto is kind of an interesting space because we kind of started with so, like, most of the real world started with real economy and kind of learned how to develop these financial tools. And crypto has kind of been the exact opposite where.
00:04:46.380 - 00:05:05.230, Speaker A: That's interesting. But. Yeah, no, totally agree. Right. So maybe another way we could think of real economy versus financial economy would be, say, main street versus Wall street.
00:05:06.530 - 00:05:46.220, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a pretty good one. And so one of the things I did want to kind of get up here and maybe spark some ideas with people building is what does web3 main street look like? So in a normal main street, you have small businesses, and these are things like coffee shops, like small restaurants, hair salons, all very physical, tangible things. So you don't get a really nice parallel. That kind of translates into web3.
00:05:47.390 - 00:06:37.100, Speaker A: Although we might have some examples here at E. Denver, because I hear that one of the brewing companies that will soon be providing us beer at some point is actually leveraging Defi in some way to receive credit to start the brewing process and all. But, yeah, totally agree. We have not seen a ton of that go on, although we would love it. So web3, for the most part, is a more efficient Wall street, in your opinion. But it's somewhat interesting that we started out with this more efficient Wall street, people trading, doing a lot of different fun things, but not so much underlying native business economy to always keep those people there.
00:06:38.590 - 00:07:41.082, Speaker B: Yeah. And this is kind of important because how to explain it. So if you have a growing economy or like an upstart economy, usually a nation state will kind of get started by either doing imports or exports, and it's very highly dependent on some other state or other economy. And this is kind of a good bootstrapping mechanism until the native economy can kind of grow in an organic way. And crypto is kind of like at that stage, it depends very heavily on more and more us dollars being invested in the space. And that's kind of like what a lot of people's salaries are based off of. But there is kind of this, like how to explain it starting to come out where you do have these service dows who, their main form of revenue is kind of servicing these large DFI dows.
00:07:41.226 - 00:07:51.330, Speaker A: Right. So they're like real economy. They're not just speculating. It's like a true good and service to which someone has value other than just reselling.
00:07:52.470 - 00:08:40.820, Speaker B: Yeah. And there's a few good examples, like llamas is a good example, gauntlet like Fireeye's Dow. These are kind of good examples actually buying block space. So there is demand for block space. That would count because it doesn't really matter what the price of Ethereum is, whether ETH is like 16,000 or 1600, the actual buying and selling of block space would kind of count as business. Yeah. I wish I could see all you all and ask you all questions and have you all kind of contribute because I'm more just curious if you come out after and tell me here's a good example or here's an idea, I would love that.
00:08:41.430 - 00:09:23.890, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, we can have all your hopes and dreams fulfilled. Right now, does anyone have an idea or a question that they would like to voice? I would love to run over, but. All right, this plan is hampered. Otherwise I'd walk around, but we've got some disabilities that we're dealing with, however. So it sounds like for the most part, union finance, which is a credit mechanism, could essentially be a cool tool to give people credit, to build out interesting products that maybe aren't just speculation related or even defi related.
00:09:25.590 - 00:10:03.390, Speaker B: Yeah, so I don't want to talk the book too much. All union is I can vouch for you and then I'm basically underwriting you and you now have a credit line. And this is just how credit works. There's really no secret. The thing that union does well is kind of enables, kind of like the network of credit. So if both of us vouch for one person, that person doesn't have to go to two people. And so there's some efficiencies there, but it really depends on what is the thing being underwritten.
00:10:03.390 - 00:10:28.040, Speaker B: A lot of what we've seen so far is basically just trust on the actual relationship. So you have a lot of friends vouching for friends, and then the friends now have a credit line at a cheaper rate, and that's what we've seen so far. In order for it to kind of grow, we really need, like, it needs to be underwritten by an actual business.
00:10:30.650 - 00:10:39.180, Speaker A: Yeah, pretty much, yeah, no, that totally makes sense. So it's like very much a social primitive. Yeah. What's up? Wait, do you want to come up here?
00:10:49.990 - 00:11:38.914, Speaker C: I just wanted to ask you guys about the, let's just say the replacement of certain national currencies with cryptocurrencies. So one that comes to mind is like, bitcoin cash in St. Kitts and Nevis on the Caribbean. It seems like it's a very ground up approach. So as opposed to, like, El Salvador, which was, I would say, pretty centralized execution of that. And from my experience with that community, it seems that the organic growth right now, starting in the islands, is spilling over into places like India with the remittances, which is like a huge driver of adoption in other far flung communities around the world that are all connected to this decentralized currency. Right.
00:11:38.914 - 00:12:01.130, Speaker C: So when I hear about main street versus Wall street backing with real goods and services, that's what I saw firsthand. When I go to these places that are starting to implement like, smart contracts and also points of sale mechanisms that aren't really dependent on visa, Mastercard, and stuff like that. So maybe speak a little bit about that. Thanks.
00:12:01.280 - 00:12:02.940, Speaker A: Totally. Thank you so much.
00:12:04.590 - 00:12:55.980, Speaker B: Cool. Yeah, so there are some kind of, like, if you get outside of the United States or like a modern economy, you do have these systems. They're generally kind of all under this header of Rosca, which is like rotating savings, credit associations. And that's kind of what we've. I'm a big fan of these things because they do kind of just build from the ground up, where it's literally just, you take, like, ten people, everyone puts in $100, and then one person gets to borrow $1,000 every month, and then you just kind of take turns. And this is just kind of a very simple kind of way to build banking in these kind of local places. So you do have people who are already kind of, I guess.
00:12:57.950 - 00:13:07.198, Speaker A: Have somewhat of a native cryptocurrency based economy, like if they're receiving remittances through different options.
00:13:07.284 - 00:13:35.720, Speaker B: So there are these kind of preexisting forms that you can kind of translate. So the big problem with a lot of these things, like the second you leave the village, you no longer have credit. So we have been looking at kind of how do we basically just map that and bring it online so that you then have this local credit that you can kind of take with you as you go? Yeah, that's something I'm pretty excited about.
00:13:36.490 - 00:14:05.170, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. That was a great example, by the way, in terms of other examples within web3 that could be defined as say, real business, are there projects besides say like just validators or roll ups, like figuring out block space and service dows, for example. What do we think of Makerdao and the use of the PSM?
00:14:08.470 - 00:15:03.010, Speaker B: Yeah, so maker is kind of leveraging, I guess it's a bit of a different case because maker is like it's an actual stablecoin and it's kind of leveraging defi to kind of go back the opposite direction and fund things in the real world. So you're taking this demand for stability. So there's generally more demand for Dai than they can mint. So they are able to kind of leverage this to kind of print a little bit more dollars to then kind of hand that back to kind of what is a good example. So they are buying like small bond etfs or like corporate bond etfs. I think a lot of mortgages from you do. It is kind of an interesting case because that's defi, that is funding like tradfi.
00:15:03.010 - 00:15:22.040, Speaker B: So it's not exactly like a crypto native main street use case, but it is kind of real because at the end of the day they are funding or improving the efficiency of mortgages basically.
00:15:22.650 - 00:16:03.462, Speaker A: Right? Yeah, I think that makes sense. For example, if someone was to buy something like Amazon stock, Amazon actually is a product. So in the end there's an underlying business actually there as opposed to something that could be. But if you're buying the stock in order simply to resell it, as opposed to receiving dividends for the business to make more money, then we can say that what makers doing with the PSM, buying corporate bonds sort of makes sense and kind of hybrid example of fueling true business. Maybe not.
00:16:03.516 - 00:16:04.120, Speaker B: Maybe.
00:16:08.240 - 00:16:36.600, Speaker A: Yeah. What would you say be the coolest thing someone could build with union finance right now? Are there things because we've got this awesome group of beetlers here. Are there things besides them just like actually using the product to give credit to one another to start out their next crypto adventure? Or is there something somewhat more directive?
00:16:37.500 - 00:17:36.024, Speaker B: Yeah, with credit, there's kind of two interesting use cases that are like specifically, one is cool, one is kind of this kind of. I can vouch for you, and I know that you're going to pay it back if I know you because you don't want to lose that relationship. So I do have this idea that I'd love someone to build it, which is basically you have a smart contract, and the smart contract is basically a hamster. And if you default on the smart contract, you make the hamster sad. And this is just kind of a very silly idea. And then if this hamster smart contract gives out like 100 credit lines, how many of those hundred people are going to default on? Basically this is just imaginary character. So that's kind of one kind of use case.
00:17:36.024 - 00:18:06.230, Speaker B: And that's kind of just a fun playing with the idea of trust and contracts and how much people value that. And the other more kind of straightforward one is you just have kind of a nouns dow and then it's the nounsdao that is providing credit rather than any of the people in the nounsdao. And so the trust relationship there is with the group mediated by the time lock contract or something like that.
00:18:07.240 - 00:18:31.310, Speaker A: Nice. That makes sense. Yeah. So I think we only have 1 minute left. What? We have no minutes left. Well, anyway, if any of you guys are looking for credit on union finance, you should talk to Jacob here and he'll do a vibe check. And maybe if he thinks he'll pay it back, get some credit with a very non predatory interest rate.
00:18:33.120 - 00:18:33.610, Speaker B: Thank you.
