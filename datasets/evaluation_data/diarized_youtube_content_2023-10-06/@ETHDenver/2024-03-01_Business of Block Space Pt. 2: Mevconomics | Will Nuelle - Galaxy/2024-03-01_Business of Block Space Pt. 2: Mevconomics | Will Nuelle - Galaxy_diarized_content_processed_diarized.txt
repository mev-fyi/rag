00:00:11.090 - 00:00:20.070, Speaker A: Hello? Hello. Okay, great. I think we just need the slides. Here we go. Great. Hey, everybody, I'm Will. I lead investing for Galaxy Digital.
00:00:20.070 - 00:01:11.418, Speaker A: We are a New York based financial services firm in the crypto space. We, we invest and trade all across the industry, but I co lead the venture efforts at Galaxy. This is a thread of research that I've been pursuing and continually analyzing for the past nine months or so. Today I'll do a bit of a presentation that I've given previously and then a little bit of additional work on meV. And we'll broadly talk about block space as a business model where consumers are purchasing block space. If you think about it as a product, the cost to serve that product of block space, and then the impact of mev, which is kind of an endogenous transaction type inside of this block space economy. And I want to maybe frame it from a lens that I work out of.
00:01:11.418 - 00:01:35.410, Speaker A: New technology paradigms fundamentally create new business models. And this is, as an investor, one of the things that I have to be keenly aware of. So there's a firm that some of you may be familiar with called Insight Partners. Insight Partners was formed in the mid 90s when the pc boom was basically halfway up its s curve. Right. Pcs were getting shipped to every home computer. To every home.
00:01:35.410 - 00:02:21.282, Speaker A: And Insight partners identified that SaaS, as a business model, had a high propensity for recurring revenue, high gross margins, and basically costs in R D that scaled logarithmically with the revenue, so you could really gain as you scale over time. And they identified that this is a business model that was really an elite business model. They built a firm around it and they were absolutely right. I think that is something we are ultimately at Galaxy want to focus on in crypto. What are the new business models enabled by the technology? So I see four business models in our industry today which have recurring sort of robust product market fit. The first is software businesses. So these are the SaaS businesses that I just talked about.
00:02:21.282 - 00:03:05.418, Speaker A: This isn't a new business model per se, but certainly businesses like fireblocks, alchemy and others have sort of repeatable, robust product market fit. The second is exchanges, the propensity to trade assets of all types, whether that's cryptocurrencies or nfts. And over time, we believe at galaxy, broad financial assets. There's a clear desire to do that in crypto. And exchanges generate robust, sort of repeatable product market fit. The third is stablecoins and lending businesses what some people call net interest margin businesses, which you could think across a whole spectrum there. There's probably a whole other presentation to be done on that business model in the industry.
00:03:05.418 - 00:03:48.990, Speaker A: The fourth is block space, which is the area I've been focusing on, and the area, ultimately, that I find most interesting. Blockspace. It's a product that blockchains sell to consumers, right. Consumers who are transacting on a chain buy blockspace from a blockchain which produces it. What is blockspace at the core? It's a set of operations on a global state machine where there's sort of global consensus over those state changes, and it's priced on a per operation basis at a virtual machine level. Okay, this is where it gets a little bit more interesting. If you look at different blockchains and the actual amount of, let's call it block space, they sell to end consumers.
00:03:48.990 - 00:04:32.278, Speaker A: There's real differences between different environments. Right. You could see Ethereum sells on the order of $10 million of block space a day. And other chains like finance, arbitrum, as well as optimism, sell on the order of $100,000 a day in block space and others less. Our proposition is that the difference between those environments is determined by the network effect that those environments have. Right. There is a real network effect around this compute, which comes in the form of capital in users, in application developers, liquidity, in smart contracts, and ultimately smart contracts that are deployed on a particular chain.
00:04:32.278 - 00:05:02.802, Speaker A: And I think that network effect is hard to overcome. Blockspace is a commodity product, but if you have a network effect, you can obtain, ultimately, a higher margin and a comparatively higher fee per transaction. And so this is a way we like to analyze block space. If you just look at the history of what users have paid to different environments, it's actually pretty interesting, right. This is through 2023. These are actualized numbers. So in 2021, consumers paid 10.9
00:05:02.802 - 00:05:22.106, Speaker A: billion to use block space across these six chains. Ethereum, finance, polygon, avalanche, arbitram, and optimism. There's others I would probably add here. Salana would be great. Salana is a fairly difficult chain to get to produce data on because they have so many transactions. But there were 10.9 billion in 2021.
00:05:22.106 - 00:05:45.902, Speaker A: This year. Last year in 2023, users paid 2.8 billion across all those chains. 2.4 of that is for Ethereum specifically. The other things I would highlight on this sheet are you could see in 2022, if people remember in the market, the Alt L1 rotation. So that's users moving into polygon and avalanche.
00:05:45.902 - 00:06:55.834, Speaker A: You can see an uptick in transaction fee volume paid in those environments where you have avalanche and Polygon growing 100% year over year from the prior year. And then in 2023, you can clearly see an l two rotation, where you have optimism and arbitrum growing their fee revenue by 100% year over year. The other thing I like to think about and pay attention to are what is the market paying per dollar of block space revenue? You can see this is a chart of. It's a bit of a confusing chart, but it's the multiple paid on the annualized transaction fees of the last 30 days. So at the bottom here, you can see Ethereum, which the market pays about 100 times the annualized transaction fees for Ethereum. And then you could see on the top here, Avalanche, where the market's willing to pay up to at times 500 plus times multiple, which is quite interesting. You also have arbitrary and optimism kind of on the lower end of that.
00:06:55.834 - 00:07:36.998, Speaker A: So you can ultimately create what people who are traditionally look at this stuff as known as an income statement, where. Let me just walk through some of the key metrics here. The 2.4 billion number is what I previously showed on the screen. The cogs is in some ways what ends up as being interesting. This is the cost for a blockchain to actually produce that block space for the consumer. And Ethereum ultimately has to pay an end user or a service provider to provide that bandwidth, storage, compute and memory to the network to run the service.
00:07:36.998 - 00:08:32.486, Speaker A: Right? And so Ethereum ultimately pays out 1.75 billion of the 2.4 billion that they earn out to the service providers, which is both the token holders as well as the validators themselves. So this first line here is the EIP 1559 tip that goes directly to the validators, and then the rest is validator compensation as well. The other thing, if you can look at the gross margin. So this is a fairly low gross margin business in aggregate, which is a metric that obviously investors pay a lot of attention to. September and October, you could see those are actually negative gross margin months where, because the fee revenue in September and October on Ethereum was low and they were paying out a recurring sort of block reward, they ultimately had negative gross margins there.
00:08:32.486 - 00:09:36.826, Speaker A: But in aggregate, ethereum kind of averages around 30% gross margins on a monthly basis, which is comparatively low. If you contrast that with arbitrum and with other l two s, arbitrum made 63 million in 2023 in transaction fee revenue. They paid out 45 million or 46 million in call data costs down to Ethereum. So Ethereum, this 45 million goes into Ethereum's top line transaction fee revenue number, right and that averages around, again, 25 30% gross margin. That is something that we'll talk about here in a second. So what are these systems actually doing? And how much data are they processing? And what are the l two consumers paying for l one block space? So they're paying for Ethereum block space, somewhere in between $1000 to $2,000 a megabyte to access Ethereum block space. And in high months, arbitrum is processing about 2.2
00:09:36.826 - 00:10:26.506, Speaker A: kb/second onto base layer l one. And in kind of a stabilized time period, May of 2023 was a comparatively high month in terms of transaction fee usage. And then in August, it's kind of more a normalized number at 1.2. That's kind of where it hangs out, about 1 kb/second Ethereum as a system today processes about 14 or 15 data throughput. After EIP 4844, you're going to add another 20 to 25 blob space, which will be priced actually differently than base l one. And so you're going to be expanding that capacity. And then obviously the long term target for Ethereum is about 83.
00:10:26.506 - 00:11:36.370, Speaker A: Could think of that as having basically capacity for 83 arbitrums at kind of fully baked, and then pricing congestion based on users demand for that. So just to highlight, and then I'm going to go into a little bit on MEV, because I think that stuff is quite important to the study of blockspace as well. But if you look at just how Celestia has performed in terms of transaction fee costs and so on, celestia transactions are running about four to $5 a megabyte. So you could say even from the low end of Ethereum call data, it's about 20 x cheaper than Ethereum call data. So if you go back to this arbitrum income statement, you're looking at this 45 million number divided by 20, and then basically take that $2.5 million as cogs on the arbitram income statement, it completely changes the business model of l two s to have cheap data availability. That will also be true post EIP 4844, where they're expanding blob space, obviously to 375 block.
00:11:36.370 - 00:12:35.142, Speaker A: So to go into the MEV side a little bit, because as I thought about the market for block space, MEV is a huge part of that. MEV is a huge consumer of blockspace, and it's a really interesting market to analyze as a consumer of this product and this business model. So I would argue we have two transactions on blockchains. The first is we have users who exogenously have demand to complete a transaction, they might want to lend in compound and borrow against a particular asset. The second type is MEV transactions, where there's an endogenous demand from a riskless arbitrage that a user can extract from the system. I believe these are two different classes of transactions that are fundamentally different. So one of the key questions I want to understand in analyzing block space is how much does type two account for? My expectation was actually higher than it ended up being.
00:12:35.142 - 00:13:19.566, Speaker A: So in 2023. Across the entire MEV supply chain, the sort of aggregate dollars earned by the searchers, the miners from the priority fee as well as the ETH burned as part of that process, was 344,000,000. Across the supply chain. Searchers made 17% of that, and then the network validators plus ETH holders made 83% of that. Validators themselves earned an additional 235,000,000 just from MEV transactions in 2023. So this number was a little bit lower. Here's the mev transaction volume on a per week basis paid to the chain.
00:13:19.566 - 00:14:11.610, Speaker A: So you can see there's two spikes. The first is the FTX collapse in November of 2022, and then the second is the SVV crisis. This makes sense. MEV transactions are saturating a larger percentage of the overall transaction fee transactional usage of the Ethereum blockchain at that time, on average, we hang around about MEV being 10% of the total transaction fees of the system. So it's a slightly smaller amount than I ultimately expected. If you break it down by category in terms of the types of MEV transactions that are happening. Liquidations in aggregate in 2023 were accounted for about 7 million of Ethereum revenues.
00:14:11.610 - 00:15:06.802, Speaker A: Arbitrage accounted for 125,000,000 of the sort of MEV supply chain sandwich transactions accounted for 210,000,000. And searcher builder, there's not great public data on this. This is internal galaxy data and doesn't represent the complete market share of searcher builder arbitrage. But this is transactions priced both based on the binance and market price at the time, as well as the transactions that actually got executed on chain searcher builders, which are doing centralized exchange. Decentralized exchange arbitrage primarily made about 100 million top line. You can see actually the costs that each one of those players paid out. So if you look arbitrage transactions are comparatively lower margin than, for example, liquidation transactions or searcher builder transactions.
00:15:06.802 - 00:16:13.260, Speaker A: So gross margin on liquidations are about 60%, along with searcher builder deck sex arbitrage, and then on arbitrage just normal atomic on chain arbitrage, the margins for searcher is about 18 and 14%. So you can see where what it would signify is liquidation or sandwiching. And arbitrage are more competitive on chain versus searcher builder kind of arbitrage opportunities as well as liquidations. And then there's the frequency. So if you think about transaction fees as a sort of stream, over time, liquidations are contributing less on a sort of recurring per week basis. But when they happen, it's hugely spiky, which makes a ton of sense when there's a lot of volatility, and then arbitrage is kind of a consistent feature of the market. One of the other analyses that's really interesting, which I think factors into our analysis of block space, is block space is not some aggregate thing where on every day you have a uniform value of a block at any particular time.
00:16:13.260 - 00:16:41.186, Speaker A: The actual value of a position in a block is very different from the start of a block to the end of a block. So this is the aggregate fees paid in 2023 between at every position in a block. So the first position of the block, the second position of the block, the third position of the block, all the way down to 100. Obviously it tails off. There's not always 500 transactions in a block. It's actually pretty uncommon. Kind of tends to tail off around 100, 200.
00:16:41.186 - 00:17:23.490, Speaker A: But you can see 20% of all the revenue made by Ethereum, or all the transaction fees paid into Ethereum happened in just the first ten blocks. You can see the sort of extremeness of that spike at blocks one through ten, and then you kind of tail off. I actually didn't understand and I don't. So if anybody from the audience has any ideas or theses of why this is happening, I don't understand the dip between transactions, about 20 through 50. You could see the dip, the kind of bimodal distribution here. It surprised me. I'm confident the data is correct, but if anybody has any ideas, it could have to do with sandwiching arbitrage happening kind of at uniform positions in the block.
00:17:23.490 - 00:18:28.194, Speaker A: And then the final question we want to ask is, what's the contribution of MeV to fees on a go forward basis? Right, we identified MEV is an endogenous transaction type. It's created by the usage, by exogenous demand for actual transactions happening on the chain. How do we expect it to participate or contribute to ETH transaction fees or blockchain transaction fees on a go forward basis? In general, it does about ten to max, 30% of the sort of overall transaction fees on a chain, it's highly correlated, as you'd expect, with the total transaction fee volume. So on the top right, you have the weekly ethereum transaction fees paid on a particular week. And then on the y axis you have the fees generated specifically by the MEV transactions. You can see obviously those are super tightly coupled. And then the lower chart is the weekly trading volumes across all of centralized exchange markets versus MEV fees.
00:18:28.194 - 00:19:11.090, Speaker A: I would have expected them to be slightly more correlated. So these are some of the things we're paying close attention to. Just to wrap up and to zoom out and talk a little bit more about block space as a business model. So what are the properties here of block space? I believe it is a fundamentally interesting and novel business model that's different from the sale of compute like Amazon EC two. It's the sale of compute with strong network effects around capital liquidity, application development and more. It's prone to network effects. There's high net income margins, so the actual costs to serve the block space are all embedded in the cogs, the cost of goods sold, which are direct cost of the transaction.
00:19:11.090 - 00:19:49.374, Speaker A: There's no indirect cost of the transaction, there's no operational expense overhead to serve that, everything. It's as if Uber was sort of run by a network of drivers and they were also running the software to the network and serving users that way. There's no operating company that's sitting behind it. So there's a high propensity for profits here, especially with roll ups. Once you scale gross margins and you cut down the cost of call data, and then I think we're just going to benefit from increasing scale over time. We're seeing arbitram and optimism grow 100% year over year. We've seen avalanche grow 100% year over year.
00:19:49.374 - 00:20:14.660, Speaker A: This is a business model that's doing billions of dollars of sort of gross revenue, gross merchandise value. And I think it's only growing with the demand for block space and demand to use these systems. So that's a high level overview of how at Galaxy we analyze the value of block space and the business model that's really served by these infrastructure layers. So that's it. Thanks everybody.
