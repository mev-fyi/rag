00:00:15.530 - 00:00:48.410, Speaker A: Okay. Thank you for having me here. My name is Dan Alitzer. I work at Ideo Colab Ventures. You heard from my colleague Gavin McDermott a little bit earlier today, talking about liquid staking and some of the potential unintended consequences of going down that route. As he emphasized, we definitely are going down that path. And what I'm going to be talking about today is some of the cool things that we can do if we go down that path, but acknowledging and recognizing fully that there are a lot of risks associated.
00:00:48.410 - 00:01:14.050, Speaker A: So as pretty much every speaker up on the stage has talked about today, Defi has absolutely exploded over the last year or so. One call out, though, is this total value locked? I think is a misnomer. It's deposited right. This is not locked in any meaningful way. You can withdraw it at any time. That's one of the beauties of these protocols. So hopefully we can adjust the nomenclature slightly.
00:01:14.050 - 00:01:18.162, Speaker A: Looking back, we can really see the growth of this ecosystem.
00:01:18.226 - 00:01:18.454, Speaker B: Right.
00:01:18.492 - 00:01:36.250, Speaker A: This was Aletheo put together some great images. This was back November 2018. Pretty small. Jumping ahead to May 2019, getting pretty big. Right. You're seeing compound come up and a lot of interactions with Maker. As a result, uniswap starting to emerge auger getting a bit of activity.
00:01:36.250 - 00:02:10.258, Speaker A: But then by August, the ecosystem had absolutely exploded, and unfortunately, they haven't updated this. There's no easy way to pull it down from their website. So I don't have a more recent one, but just look at the size of synthetics at the top, right? That's tiny, and they're now exploding. So I think we can all agree that this ecosystem is just getting started, but already we're seeing these money Legos combine in really, really interesting ways. So what do successful DeFi protocols have in common? They're not peer to peer.
00:02:10.354 - 00:02:10.854, Speaker B: Right.
00:02:10.972 - 00:03:04.978, Speaker A: If you look at some of the early attempts, the original version of Dharma, what Zero X was focused on originally, they were all focused on taking this order book model that's been used in traditional finance and saying, we've got somebody who's making an offer and someone who's going to take that offer. And that was kind of clunky. And unfortunately, for trying to bootstrap a market, that doesn't work very well. So every single one of the protocols that we've seen become successful have had some form of peer to contract interaction. Now, I want to emphasize, this does not mean that you're literally trading with a robot or trading with a contract. There is effectively a human on the other side of that for now. And that's happening because we're using various forms of automatic rate setting and automated market makers that are enabling this interaction where in the moment you're going against pools of liquidity.
00:03:04.978 - 00:03:55.874, Speaker A: So if we look and this was snapped. It's funny trying to make slides because when you show charts like this, they fluctuate if you do it an hour beforehand. But this was taken last night. So every single one of these maker, compound, synthetic, everything down until you get to lightning network and WBTC, every single one of these has as a core component some form of an automated market maker or some automated interest rate setting, and a peer to contract interaction. And that's what I believe is one of the key drivers that's unlocked this ecosystem. So if you're thinking about launching some kind of new DeFi protocol today, and you're not thinking about at the core having a peer to contract interaction, I think it's going to be really hard to get up on this chart and start getting liquidity. Now the important thing here is liquidity is a moat.
00:03:55.874 - 00:04:25.234, Speaker A: This is how you're going to defeat everybody else. You need the most liquidity. Why? There's this flywheel effect around liquidity, right? As you increase your liquidity and you're using this automatic rate setting, your slippage goes down for trades. The rates go down for people who want to borrow. So that increases your trading activity, it increases your borrowing activity. That in turn increases your fees, which increases the yield for the people who've deposited liquidity. And so the more liquidity floods in.
00:04:25.234 - 00:05:19.234, Speaker A: So you need to get this flywheel turning. And it's possible to try to growth hack your way at any one of the points on this cycle, right? You can pay people for liquidity and just start dumping a lot of stuff in there initially to put your slippage and rates below, you can subsidize your rates that people are getting, right? An example of this is the way synthetix subsidized people to create the Seth eth pools on Uniswap, right? Or if you look at pool together, they've got this sponsored dai pool that boosts the prizes and boosts the rates that people are getting for participating in their prize linked savings protocol. On the trading and borrowing side, you can always do the kind of traditional thing. You can give some sort of rebates, you can do various things there.
00:05:19.432 - 00:05:20.690, Speaker B: Fees, right?
00:05:20.760 - 00:05:51.782, Speaker A: We can play with fees. You can give higher fees. If you think traders will tolerate it, that will incentivize liquidity providers. But the place where I really think there's the most interest, the most attention is around yield. And we've seen discussions, right? See Gavin laughing there because there's been like three talks on the stage just today, all about yield and how that is the tail wagging. Like the billion dollar tail wagging the trillion dollar dog is what's going to happen eventually. So how do you hack yield?
00:05:51.926 - 00:05:52.282, Speaker B: Right?
00:05:52.336 - 00:07:02.210, Speaker A: And I think Ryan is totally right here that we're going to see. Like what we're seeing right now are liquidity hackers. The folks who are successful today, who are getting up there and finding ways to climb up those ranks and get used to their protocol, they're finding ways to hack liquidity. So just a year ago, right before East Denver last year, I published this piece explaining this concept of superfluid collateral. And the core idea here was, well, why do you just have to use assets in one place? Why can't your collateral also be earning for you while it is, say, securing a loan? And so one of the examples I gave was looking at compound and saying, well, why can't we tokenize deposits into compound so that you can earn interest and at the same time use that as collateral somewhere else? I had a slightly different construct than what ultimately ended up happening in May of that year when compound ended up introducing C tokens. I think BZX had I tokens before that as well. So this concept has really taken off and is starting to form the core of a lot of the new protocols that we're seeing experiment with these concepts.
00:07:02.210 - 00:07:43.850, Speaker A: I also made a prediction that we're going to start seeing uniswap liquidity pool shares start getting used as collateral loans, and that would get to millions of dollars in months rather than years. And that, unfortunately, has been wrong. But I think that I was wrongly timing not on whether that's going to happen. And I think the reason for that, that this ended up being wrong, was the power of defaulting to opt out rather than opt in. So if you think about the power of defaults, right, we've seen studies that show that you can increase participation in employer sponsored retirement plans by having people opt out rather than opt in by about 32%. The one that I really like is organ donors.
00:07:43.930 - 00:07:44.560, Speaker B: Right?
00:07:44.930 - 00:08:16.550, Speaker A: If you go look at countries that have opt out from organ donor programs versus opt in, there's a 600% greater participation rate when you say you're opted in by default. So I think what we need to start seeing is folks build these protocols from day one saying we want to have yield generation in there. So I think where that's going to take us is we're going to go from talking about superflu collateral to superfluid protocols. An early example that we've seen of this is Ave.
00:08:16.630 - 00:08:16.922, Speaker B: Right?
00:08:16.976 - 00:09:02.326, Speaker A: They're a compound like lending, borrowing and lending protocol. But rather than just have this variable rate loans that are kind of money market function, what they've done is they've also said, well, you can use the same pool of liquidity, and we can also offer fixed rate loans. You're not going to get as good a rate, but if you want the guarantee of a fixed rate, we can also do that from the same pool of capital. Oh, and by the way, we're also offering flash loans, right. There have been other folks that had done flash loans in various forms previously. Flash loan being where you can actually take an uncollateralized loan as long as within the same transaction, you are paying back all the assets that you borrowed. And they're just saying, that's free, right? Not that there's no risk there, but you can seriously minimize the risk.
00:09:02.326 - 00:09:40.498, Speaker A: And it's certainly fine to do uncollateralized lending, or it's better to do uncollateralized lending in a single transaction with a guarantee of payback, or the transaction reverts versus trying to do un or under collateralized lending, where you can really kind of move stuff around across multiple blocks. So getting to the next step, there's a protocol called balancer. And hey, guys can see it there. And so balancer is a noncustodial portfolio manager, liquidity provider, and price sensor. But in easier terms, it's uniswap, but with any number of assets, with any weighting.
00:09:40.594 - 00:09:41.238, Speaker B: Right.
00:09:41.404 - 00:10:14.986, Speaker A: That's the core thing they do. They say you don't need to have a 50 50 weighting of ETH and some other asset. If you've got three assets, five assets, 15 assets in your portfolio, and you want to contribute them all into this liquidity pool with varying weights, you can do that. You can make those pools custom. And I think that's really cool. And one of the things that I loved reading their papers that made me think we're going to start seeing this bleed out into the traditional finance world, too, is they pointed out, you don't need to do this just in crypto, you could apply this to traditional markets.
00:10:15.018 - 00:10:15.310, Speaker B: Right?
00:10:15.380 - 00:10:40.758, Speaker A: Imagine an S and P 500 pool. If Vanguard took their S and P 500 index fund and said, rather than having people who are paid to go out and trade and keep our portfolio in balance, let's just make that whole fund available and other people can pay us to rebalance our portfolio for us. So I think that is super cool. My question is, can we combine balancer and compound?
00:10:40.854 - 00:10:41.162, Speaker B: Right?
00:10:41.216 - 00:11:13.074, Speaker A: If I'm, let's say I'm willing to hold ETh and Dai and BNB and rep. And I've got, I'm saying, okay, this is the portfolio I want to go long. If all those assets were, say, on combat, okay, I'll just dump them all in there. But why wouldn't I also say I'm willing to accept if somebody wants to borrow any one of these assets and they're willing to collateralize it in another asset that I'm willing to hold and over collateralize it, why wouldn't I let them do that?
00:11:13.112 - 00:11:13.506, Speaker B: Right.
00:11:13.608 - 00:11:29.238, Speaker A: That's more yield. Now you're getting the flywheel effect going where you're supercharging that yield because you're not only getting the trading fees yield, you're starting to get the lending yield. So this leads me to what is the ultimate superfluid protocol?
00:11:29.414 - 00:11:29.994, Speaker B: Right.
00:11:30.112 - 00:12:16.742, Speaker A: First, you're able to deposit any assets in any proportion. You're going to be able to have them automatically rebalanced as the relative prices of those assets shift. You're going to earn trading fees via some sort of automated market maker. You're going to automatically earn interest on loans of your assets as long as they're over collateralized by other asset types that you've deposited. And you're going to get extra bonus fees from flash loans of your assets. There's also another thing you're going to get, which we're going to get to in a second. So the question here is then, is all of this going to congeal into like one single superfluid protocol where we're all going to be dumping our assets and trying to maximize our yield? And I think the answer to that question is no.
00:12:16.876 - 00:12:17.560, Speaker B: Right?
00:12:18.170 - 00:12:19.026, Speaker A: Here's some reasons.
00:12:19.058 - 00:12:19.206, Speaker B: Right.
00:12:19.228 - 00:12:36.734, Speaker A: We've got, these smaller liquidity pools are going to exist. They're going to have more slippage and more volatility. But the upside is you get more arbitrage opportunities. And so there will be traders who are going to come in, who are going to arbitrage, are going to keep activities going, those little pools, because they want that. That's good. Some people don't care enough. They're not trying to optimize too much.
00:12:36.734 - 00:12:44.962, Speaker A: And so you're going to have these different pools. But I believe there is a trump card to this.
00:12:45.096 - 00:12:45.780, Speaker B: Right.
00:12:47.350 - 00:12:57.714, Speaker A: There is one scenario where you never want to go with the less liquid pool privacy.
00:12:57.842 - 00:12:58.520, Speaker B: Right.
00:12:58.890 - 00:13:34.522, Speaker A: Look at tornado cash. If you forked tornado cash and said, we're going to start tornado cash from scratch. But, oh, by the way, the anonymity stat, the number of deposits with which my deposits are getting mixed, there's ten deposits so far. Nobody who cares about privacy is ever going to go and use that protocol. You always want the largest anonymity set for privacy. You're never going to go with a smaller anonymity set. So that means the 6th piece here is you're going to have privacy because that is going to be a really powerful moat.
00:13:34.522 - 00:14:16.786, Speaker A: And that means that all of us, by participating in these protocols, by trading with them, by borrowing from them, by lending to them, by parking our assets there, while we want to passively go along this portfolio, we're both going to regain our own financial privacy and we're going to empower other users of the protocol to regain their financial privacy. That's the talk. So I think we've got a few minutes if there are any questions. No, this all sounds good. You guys are going to build this?
00:14:16.968 - 00:14:17.602, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:14:17.736 - 00:14:31.036, Speaker A: Question. Sorry, I can't see the mics. Is there. There's a mic up here if people have questions.
00:14:31.138 - 00:14:31.790, Speaker B: No.
00:14:40.270 - 00:15:18.254, Speaker A: Have you met anyone building this protocol? Not yet. My question to both the balancer and compound teams, because those are the ones I think are best positioned overall right now, is who's going to become who first? Is compound going to become balancer or is balancer going to become compound? But I do think compound's big balancer is getting out of the gates and there's a lot of other very smart teams working on things. So I'm excited to see how this plays out. Yeah.
00:15:18.292 - 00:15:40.934, Speaker C: So I guess if you talk about privacy, I'm curious if you see other potential money Lego combinations for increasing it. So the obvious one that I see is if you take the die savings rate and put that on top of tornado cash, people can now keep their savings in the anonymity set. Are there other obvious combinations that you think would be beneficial or that.
00:15:41.052 - 00:16:10.294, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a great question. I think all of it, right. So absolutely, you can do the DSR and I think that's the least risky way to do it. It's just you're already taking risk with DAI and so DSr doesn't really add an incremental risk. You're leaving money on the table if you don't have your DAI deposited, not locked to earn the DAi savings rate. So absolutely, that should be the default way. I think Tornado cash right now just supports eth, but I know Aztec just launched their ZK die.
00:16:10.294 - 00:16:36.338, Speaker A: There are various ways to do this. So I think, yes, absolutely, you'll earn the DSR. You'll probably want to do this with C tokens and I tokens and y tokens and all these different things, but I think you're also going to mix it. So let these privacy enhanced assets also be traded via uniswap pools, balancer pools, whatever it is. As long as you're willing to hold multiple assets. And you want those proportions.
00:16:36.434 - 00:16:36.790, Speaker B: Right.
00:16:36.860 - 00:16:52.154, Speaker A: As long you don't have a unit bias of like, I bought this number of units of this asset and I want to have that number of units later then. Yeah, I think that's how it'll work. Just a quick correction. Tarnada cash supports CDI. Oh, it does support. Awesome.
00:16:52.272 - 00:17:00.674, Speaker B: Yes. Very cool power. All right, cool.
00:17:00.712 - 00:17:03.230, Speaker A: Well, I'll be around if anybody wants to talk more about some of these ideas.
