00:00:00.490 - 00:00:40.054, Speaker A: Hello, everyone. Welcome to all of you who came to our panel and also those streaming on Twitch. Hi, I'm Julia. I lead the communications for the web3 initiative at Opera. And we have some awesome panelists with us today. First, let me introduce Tessie Mehrain, the co founder of the quality Wallet and the founder of Women in Blockchain. And we also have Brian Trusnaud, the metaverse lead at Polygon Studios.
00:00:40.054 - 00:01:28.934, Speaker A: Give it up for Brian, please. And last but not least, we have Louis Goodman, the ecosystem lead at start. We have some really cool questions coming up to draw and pick on the brains of our awesome panelists. But let me just start by providing some intro. So our panelists entered the web3 space a few years back when it was more crypto was more niche. Blockchain was like just for people in the know. And in 2021 and this year, we've seen this exponential growth of interest in crypto and web3 and metaverses.
00:01:28.934 - 00:02:10.950, Speaker A: And we've also had some big corporations enter the space as if like with visions drawn from watching ready player one a few too many times. What we want to discuss is here, the state of decentralization of web3. But before we go into the challenges and how the projects of our panelists are fixing them, I wanted to pick your brains and hear how you entered the web3 space. What was the landscape like then? What made you interested in the first place, and what the key challenge was when you entered the space. We can maybe start with Brian.
00:02:11.610 - 00:02:33.534, Speaker B: Okay, great. I entered the space in the first quarter of 2017. I remember the first time I heard about Ethereum. It was like an out of body experience. I felt as though I could finish the sentences of the person who was explaining it to me. It just felt like I knew everything he was saying to be true and that I had heard it before. I was in a weird place at that moment in my life.
00:02:33.534 - 00:03:15.082, Speaker B: I had exited two businesses. I felt very empty, and I was looking for meaning. I was doing trend forecasting for fashion companies. I was explaining to them concept design, consumer insights, what they should be thinking about in designing for the next wave of consumers. And Ethereum really captivated me and really got my imagination going. And I started basically trend forecasting how the ERC 721 contract and this concept of digital scarcity would become extremely important for fashion brands that were looking to create wearables inside these metaversal worlds. So I launched a metaverse and web3 consultancy teaching brands how to get into web3.
00:03:15.082 - 00:03:18.150, Speaker B: And that eventually led me to Polygon and Polygon studios.
00:03:18.230 - 00:03:24.350, Speaker A: And what was the challenge you noticed then? What was the key element?
00:03:24.770 - 00:03:43.442, Speaker B: Just mass confusion, especially at multinationals, especially at large consumer brands. The CFO, for instance, doesn't know how to mark to market fiat to Ethereum transactions, for instance. Right. So it's really getting people aligned and on the same page and educating them and motivating them to want to explore this new business unit for them.
00:03:43.576 - 00:03:50.166, Speaker A: Okay, let's hear from Tessie. There's a burning man story in there.
00:03:50.348 - 00:04:34.180, Speaker C: Yeah. I probably had the most dramatic entry into web3, but yes, where did I come from? I was building trading applications and an investment bank, JP Morgan's investment bank, for about six years during the financial Cris. And of course, we all know that was a pretty tough time for many. And that got me interested in how financial systems could be done differently and better. And at the same time, being in New York, we also had occupy right in front of the door. And that got me interested in the alternative banking group. And I started working with them and exploring different models and ended up at sharing economy, this, that and the other.
00:04:34.180 - 00:05:14.254, Speaker C: And was at Burning man. That's where burning man comes in. When I went to a talk, and at that talk, which was during a dust storm, so a lot of people didn't make it, including my friends. We sat out on a bicycle, got there and somebody was talking about Ethereum and it totally hit me, like yours. And it was very dramatic, the storm and everything. But there were two things that I felt. One was like, wow, this is like the opportunity in creating a different system that is neutral and open and that helps.
00:05:14.254 - 00:05:52.000, Speaker C: Collaboration is a great opportunity. And at the same time, the idea of reward systems was scary because I thought, wow, already even there, there were like three women and a bunch of guys. I thought, wow, we might actually reproduce the same system we already have. And those two initial feelings I had about this web3 movement that has actually been confirmed and is still there. And those are both my motivations to work.
00:05:52.450 - 00:06:09.650, Speaker A: So that kind of you're building on these two challenges with your projects, right? You have the quality wallet, which is chain inclusive. And then women in blockchain are exactly women in blockchain. Let's hear about your path, Louis.
00:06:12.070 - 00:06:46.442, Speaker D: I guess I have a much boring path than those two folks here. So like most people, I came into crypto through trading. So I started first time, heard about bitcoin 2012, 1st bubble 2013. My credit card didn't pass. Why? I was kids, so I guess it didn't pass. And then I decided to sort of buy my first bitcoin for real in 2016, just to track the price, like probably â‚¬1 on Coinbase and went to work for a company. E became big at the same time as a Dow.
00:06:46.442 - 00:07:09.350, Speaker D: All the company was investing, investing all of them. And then next week, the following week, the Dow, the hack, all of a sudden, everyone cries. Losing money was like, okay, I'll leave it there. And so I left it for six months, early 2017, January 2017. I looked back at my Kraken account and was like, oh, shit, you came back to three times what I invested. That's cool. Let me read about more.
00:07:09.350 - 00:07:55.130, Speaker D: And then I started to just read the bitcoin paper and read Peel right away and started reading the Ethereum bed paper and a lot of things that coming out back then. And by the end of 2017, I was, like, starting into cryptography, the proper cryptography side of things. And the entire year of 2019, I studied cryptography by myself up to a point where I started a meetup called DK Global, which was, like, expanding to Tel Aviv, Paris, London, Toronto and Seoul, and started to work with the BWFM foundation on crypto stuff, first version of DK's roll up and stuff. And by May 2019, through a set of circumstances, I basically start where reach out and say, oh, we are hiring. You have a good profile for what we're building. And so this is my story to crypto.
00:07:55.230 - 00:08:24.830, Speaker A: Okay, great. So let's move to the second part. Decentralization has been described as a spectrum spanning from a fully functioning, trustless system to trade offs for certain aspects and all kinds of compromises. So what's the current state of decentralization in web3, and how are your projects working towards fixing the challenges that exist? We can maybe start with Tessie.
00:08:25.330 - 00:08:58.054, Speaker C: Whoa. That's a big question. Right? So there are several layers here. One is like, yes, my project liquality. It's a multi blockchain wallet, so where you can trade and hold everything from bitcoin to ethereum. It's not just ebms, and you can also access the web3. So what's different here? It's like, basically the one place where you can have your window into web3.
00:08:58.054 - 00:09:39.794, Speaker C: The promise here is that we make it easy for people to access and make it easy for people to hold their value. How this started is actually quite interesting, because we started with atomic swaps and atomic swaps between bitcoin and ethereum. And this goes back to what you said about trustlessness. So atomic swaps are one technology that allow trustlessness. It's a technology. For those who don't know, just google it or come to the liquidity website, to the blog, it's explained. And what we did is we made bitcoin and ethereum compatible through a chain abstraction layer.
00:09:39.794 - 00:10:46.198, Speaker C: So that was the innovation, right? So this is one part, this is trustlessness. But probably not everything needs trustlessness the same way. Or sometimes there are certain inconvenience coming along with that. And we all know about web3 and usability, that being sometimes a hindrance, waiting for confirmations and all these things. So liquidity is chain agnostic and we treat everything the same, and we want to make it easy for everybody. The state of web3 today is interesting because with NFT community, a whole other vibe came in, right? We started out with the cipher punk thinking of trustlessness, but there are so many other chains that have different promises. And so what I think is really important is we have to keep in mind, why do we do this? Right? What is web3 about? And even here, I have heard a lot of people talk about the better world, all inclusive.
00:10:46.198 - 00:11:08.260, Speaker C: But truth is, we have to really think about that. Is that true? Can everybody join this? How do we decentralize power? Because it's really a decentralization of power and the power shift. And I feel we are at this point where it's going very commercial and we have to really think about this and be very aware. Sorry, I took a couple of minutes.
00:11:08.630 - 00:11:24.200, Speaker A: That's okay. Maybe we can hear from Louis and how Starquare is solving current challenges in web3. Like, are you making it web3 a better place? Are you keeping it decentralized? Everyone's pretty excited about your technology.
00:11:24.810 - 00:11:48.314, Speaker D: Yeah, I'm happy to discuss that. So what do starkware bring to web3? The very simple answer, short answer, is scale. Starknet scale. Starkware enables scaling. ZKP enables scaling. But the truth is that this tech, this ZKP tech is. Everyone talks about privacy, usually when talk about DK.
00:11:48.314 - 00:12:12.466, Speaker D: From my perspective, the validity proof, the fact that I cannot lie when I'm running a proof I cannot lie to you, is what matters. It was really interesting. And so when it comes to decentralization is decentralization is not a goal, it's a moving target. The goal is trustlessness. The goal is transparency. The goal is self custody. This is what are the goal of blockchain ownership.
00:12:12.466 - 00:12:48.018, Speaker D: And so what starkware brings to the table when it comes to ZKP, that it enables to have environments which are easier to use, which are less decentralized because they provide the same trustlessness and a purely centralized network. But they also enable centralized entity to make environments which feel like web two and that enable also web3 to regular web3 folks to enjoy a more scalable environment with respect to the principle, which are inclusivity. And inclusivity means something specific when it comes to crypto. So this is what starware brings to.
00:12:48.024 - 00:12:55.490, Speaker A: The table and I guess faster transaction speeds, lower gas fees through the layer two.
00:12:55.640 - 00:13:43.230, Speaker D: Yes, obviously. But the thing is, it's very funny, people keep talking about l two s and lower fees. I'm going to bring a hot take here, which is there is no way for a successful blockchain with defi activity, with financial activity to be cheap in the long run. And the way we see, at least from my perspective, I don't know if I'm talking for starkware here, the way I see cheap in the long run is through usage. Something we published, something called Fractal l three recently, where we not only do enable an l two, but we enable using our tech, using that trustlessness to build all the layers on top of the l two. And so where are maybe more centralized but more cheaper to use for users. And at the same time for the regular folks, you can also enjoy faster transaction cheaper.
00:13:43.230 - 00:13:58.366, Speaker D: While respecting the principle of blockchain, which is inclusivity. And what it means when it comes to the tech of blockchain, what it means. Inclusivity means you should be able to verify the chain on your phone. You shouldn't rely on inferior. We have to today, but that's the end goal. And this is what Stargate brings.
00:13:58.498 - 00:14:28.706, Speaker A: Thank you. I'm going to add a different question to Brian here, is also allowing you to talk about polygon, of course. But maybe we could also sum it up like what do you think the responsibilities of this community here are? Are we okay to make compromises for scale or further reach? Or should we just make crypto weird again, as you said earlier, that was.
00:14:28.728 - 00:15:29.702, Speaker B: Something that we were discussing earlier, this keep crypto weird sort of meme. Sort of like when a neighborhood gets gentrified and people say, let's keep the neighborhood weird, that sort of thing. But bringing it back to a more serious place, I think it's everyone's responsibility in the space, never mind the Dapps and the protocols, to pay it forward and to evangelize and to onboard as many users as possible. And I think speaking for Polygon and Polygon studios, that's precisely what we're trying to do, both on the tech side, but also on the culture side. So bifurcating the two for Polygon. It's addressing the speed, the scalability transaction throughput through everything from our SDK capabilities of spinning up validator sets for public companies and companies of a certain size that want to run their own validator and have their own side chain through our proof of stake side chain, which is battle tested for years now, and straight through to ZK roll ups and data availability. So really giving a modular sort of approach to evangelizing and onboarding people into decentralized web3.
00:15:29.702 - 00:15:54.218, Speaker B: On the Polygon studio side of things, we look at this onboarding and this evangelizing in a different way, and that's through cultural relevance. Right. We take the view that anyone who's crypto native is already onboarded. There are no more crypto native folks. Right. If you are crypto native, you're here. So how do we get the next 100 million or billion wallets onboarded into web3? And that's through cultural relevance.
00:15:54.218 - 00:16:16.280, Speaker B: That's through excellence with fashion, celebrity, entertainment, lifestyle, sport, creating really exhilarating experiences that are based in nfts, based in blockchain based gaming, and also based in metaversal virtual open world. So that's really how we look at it from both the Polygon and the Polygon studio side.
00:16:17.130 - 00:16:26.130, Speaker A: I don't know if we have any time left. No one's kicking us out. So let's also hear from Tessie.
00:16:26.210 - 00:17:03.970, Speaker C: Absolutely, yes. Yeah. From the liquidity perspective, very much aligned with you. Liquidity is liquidity and equality. So equality is something super important to us. It's in our name, and we're pushing for that. And how can technology do this? Web three is actually always, that's the value proposition, equality, right? And so what I think is really important to keep in mind for everybody working is like, what are our value propositions? We have to do things with intention, and intention means, like, different things at different times.
00:17:03.970 - 00:17:34.762, Speaker C: Right? Now, in this web3 environment, we're still dealing with the basics, right? We have to build the basic tools. Now, the next level is like multichain. Make it easy to bring the different communities together in one wallet. Right. Our wallet allows other communities to basically access each other's dapps. And that's amazing, right? You have a whole community. The RSK community can go to the Ethereum Dapps and make this very easy.
00:17:34.762 - 00:18:18.682, Speaker C: You can exchange value across, and the next step is a Dao, right. And so the future really is constantly moving. And this community here in East Denver is always this very open and explorative community. So what I would say what's really important to do is keep talking about our values and make sure that we are really on top of what we're promising, right? Because we do say we do this for all. But truth is, decentralization means a power shift. There are laws, there are regulations. We all get to these edges at some point.
00:18:18.682 - 00:18:40.100, Speaker C: Building Daos, building Daos in different jurisdictions, building defi products and having to talk to lawyers. So what's really important is to also not forget that side of policy and make sure that we really lift the opportunity and realize the opportunity of bringing people in that have been excluded so far.
00:18:40.630 - 00:18:56.390, Speaker A: So we have Brian's point. Keep it culturally relevant, make it exciting. Your point? Keep it decentralized, maintain the principles, talk to legislators. What do you add to that, Lewis? And I think that will be some of the final remarks.
00:18:59.050 - 00:19:37.960, Speaker D: I guess. Keep it exciting. The thing that gets me excited right now when it comes to web3, and I mean, obviously I'm very involved with starknet, so I will talk. What I know is seeing new folks coming in and bringing new things, things that didn't exist before, things that were unimaginable before either because the tech wasn't there. And this is what my opinion there is like sort of three breakthrough in the space of blockchain. There was like bitcoin, the Stoshi Nakamoto paper, Nakamoto Consensus, the Ethereum bringing smart contract, and ZK don't have to be starquate. It could be other players in the space.
00:19:37.960 - 00:20:07.150, Speaker D: And we are just very early in this case space. And we are starting to see people being. Creating things that we didn't exist before in the space, like doing proper, decentralized gaming, unstoppable games, and achieving Vitalik's vision of gaming. Right. So this is what I would advise to people. And what I want to see more is like, go crazy. Try add the new tech, go crazy.
00:20:07.150 - 00:20:11.920, Speaker D: Build the thing that you want to see and bring that weirdness, I guess.
00:20:12.290 - 00:20:52.314, Speaker A: Thank you. I'm just going to add that maybe like from the opera side of a browser and an app that started in web one, went to web two, now is heavily shaping web3. At least that's what we say. You said, make the app you want to see. And I would add, make the solution. The app that will make large audiences go crazy. Because I think that's also what Polygon is starting to achieve, is build this whole ecosystem of exciting games, exciting dapps that will finally are on this cusp of reaching mass adoption.
00:20:52.314 - 00:21:37.766, Speaker A: So as a browser company, we see our role, this QR code here. If anyone wants to try the beta before we launch in March, it's just our vision of 3 minutes left. So it's kind of the realization of our vision, like how to make crypto understandable to non crypto natives, to keep it exciting for crypto natives, but also make it understandable, provide a safe wallet, browser, web3 browsing features. So I think there is, tessa, you wanted to say? Yeah, so I'm saying it's just like, I think it all comes together, and I'm hoping, I'm really rooting for web3 to just go into the mainstream and become a staple.
00:21:37.958 - 00:22:21.800, Speaker C: Yeah, I would like to add to that. Yes, we all want to be excited here, and we're all here, and we are all privileged because otherwise we wouldn't be here. Right? But the real innovation, in my point of view, is happening in the edges, in these folds, in these places where people have been excluded, in countries, in the global south where people actually building solutions right now here, we're building the path, we're building the tools to actually even have web3, like the wallets and all the infrastructure. But we have to really be intentional about including the global south because there are lots of solutions there that in the end will also be very beneficial for everybody.
00:22:22.730 - 00:22:34.010, Speaker A: Yeah, I think we've actually run out of time. Thank you very much for coming. Here's to web3. Thanks everyone, for watching us here in the metaverse.
