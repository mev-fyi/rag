00:00:01.690 - 00:01:31.362, Speaker A: Yeah, it's my great pleasure to be here to present our latest access protocol, Webster URL, which is designed for Ethereum virtual machine to be able to access the future of the data and enable a lot of new applications that we believe that future Ethereum can enable. So first of all, what is web3 access protocol? It's defined in ERC 4804 Webster URL standard, which was finalized the day before yesterday, which we have a very good timing and it is an IANA registered scheme. It actually is an HTTP like URL, but instead of locating centralized resources hosted on a server, it's designed to locate a decentralized resources hosted by a smart contract or with mapped by Ens. It has a very similar semantics with HTTP and with corresponding for example path and also for example query. And you can find more details of EIP 4804, the final the specification in the EIP repo. And there's also Websu URL. You can find a lot of examples that are live using Webster URL.
00:01:31.362 - 00:02:56.550, Speaker A: We also offer Easterdammer bounty for the developers who are now be able to using web3 URL to develop awesome applications. So why we need kind of like web3 URL and what is the motivation? The original motivation we are developing this access protocol is that we found a lot of more and more nfts that are moving fully on chain. For example, to name a field, there are cyber blockers, numbs, moonbirds, island blocks, and there are more and more coming. Why? Because they would like to have a fully decentralized NFT, not only the token contract but also the corresponding data, for example images. And it can be also music or maybe videos that are fully on chain. When a user buy the token is not only just buy a token URL with a token id on a smart contract, but also owns the actual images that will never disappear on chain. However, actually I bought a few and also started all this project and I'm quite surprised.
00:02:56.550 - 00:03:24.430, Speaker A: All these images, they are now actually using third party to render those images. For example, they're using HTTP for the distance, moonbirds and also ipfs. And even we have all the data on chain. That is quite counterintuitive because now we have Ethereum and we have all data.
00:03:24.580 - 00:03:26.842, Speaker B: Why not just using Ethereum to render.
00:03:26.906 - 00:04:45.320, Speaker A: All these resources directly? And that is the original motivation. We developed the Webster access protocol which allows the user to browse all these images or any web contents directly on the Ethereum smart contracts. So for example, here are a couple of examples that now we are able to using web3 URL to browse all these images and all this URL are actually ineffective. So if you type this URL in Firefox with our extension, then you are able to directly browse all these images on Ethereum. And that's something we believe we should be actually widely adopted in all the projects that have all these web accountants that is available on Ethereum and how to use web3 URL. So basically it inherits most features of HTTP, which is already widely adopted for the whole Internet. It has a decentralized authority which is a contract or a name for name service.
00:04:45.320 - 00:05:44.570, Speaker A: Right now we have fully integrated with NES, and there's also defined a way to call a smart contract that is core data. And lastly, there's a format of how the data will be present at a browser. It can be a JSON file, or it can be natively web objects, pictures, webs, javascripts, anything can be displayed using web Sul. And there's a lot of examples of how to use Websu. So you can check the websu URL website, the website itself. So the link here is still HTTP, but itself is already hosted using web3 URL and running on top of ethereum. So another question is how I can access EVM using web3 URL.
00:05:44.570 - 00:06:42.400, Speaker A: So there are a couple of ways, but at the beginning, since this standard just has three days, just after three days since its finalization. So we have launched the gateway to support the web3 URL at the beginning. And so Webster IO is the current gateway for the Ethereum. So for example, if you type web3 URL with web3 URL ease, that's our homepage to introduce Webster URL. Then you can just place web3 URL as a subdomain of the gateway. And now you're able to browse the content that is hosted on the Ethereum. We also have a Firefox extension that is able to translate a web3 URL to the HTTP gateway link.
00:06:42.400 - 00:07:38.282, Speaker A: And as a roadmap, we are also doing native integration with modern browsers such as brave carbon, Firefox itself and Chrome. And we also support multiple blockchains. The web3 URL is designed, was born to support multiple blockchains. For example, we have already supported, this is just a few blockchains we're currently supporting, including Ethereum testnets, and also for example our other network like BnB chain or avalanche. And we are also going to extend the standard to support heterogeneous blockchains like bitcoin. So what are the new applications that can enable by the web3 URL. We believe there are tons of applications.
00:07:38.282 - 00:08:40.100, Speaker A: One natural application is the onchain app images. So for example cyberblocks, they upload all the metadata SVG layers on chain and compose them using smart contracts. And using web3 URL, we deploy a contract that combine these layers together and return a string to the contract. And now using this web3 URL, we can directly call this contract with correspond method. Then we can render any token UI, any token and another interesting experiment we are doing is Vitalis block. So we upload the who Vitalix block which contains 40 megabytes of data on the contract to upshot Nova which is the main net of L2 on Ethereum. And this only costs zero.
00:08:40.100 - 00:09:47.470, Speaker A: That's roughly $300. But now even the Vitali, his personal website is down. But while we have something some minute that is able to host Vitalik's website Forever on his Ethereum network and it will receive a widely reception from the community, there's tons of discussions and how we do this and how the UFC URL works. And feel free to leave your comments in the Reddit. And to support personal website, we also propose ERC five zero eighteen. It is a kind of file system like interface so that we are able to mimic a file system using a smart contract and using a tool we call ethfs uploader to synchronize local folders and files with the blockchain. And that's how we are able to just using single command and synchronize all Vitalik's block to the blockchain on arbitrage Nova.
00:09:47.470 - 00:10:14.526, Speaker A: And so for our bounty, welcome to use our tools and to deploy all kinds of interesting applications that you can imagine crazy ideas. So imagine there's more and more applications that we are able to enable besides these two examples. For example, one big application we are imagining is dynamic websites with multi user.
00:10:14.558 - 00:10:22.798, Speaker B: Interactions, decentralized blogger, decentralized jobbox, decentralized email, decentralized git or decentralized cracklist.
00:10:22.894 - 00:10:24.674, Speaker A: Anything we can imagine on the web.
00:10:24.712 - 00:10:30.646, Speaker B: Two world now is possible on web3. For example, we have the git three version right now.
00:10:30.668 - 00:10:32.726, Speaker A: We gave the demo that now we.
00:10:32.748 - 00:10:34.882, Speaker B: Are able to using all the gits.
00:10:34.946 - 00:10:37.058, Speaker A: With a translate to web3 URL.
00:10:37.154 - 00:10:40.998, Speaker B: Now we are able to develop Ethereum.
00:10:41.094 - 00:10:42.934, Speaker A: On top of Ethereum.
00:10:43.062 - 00:10:48.106, Speaker B: That is something unimaginable before. So you can check our for all.
00:10:48.128 - 00:10:52.734, Speaker A: These applications, a lot of them are live or running on Testnet and feel.
00:10:52.772 - 00:11:03.314, Speaker B: Free to come up with your crazy ideas. And so one problem said, oh, that's amazing. And it's everything that we can do, anything on the web.
00:11:03.352 - 00:11:53.680, Speaker A: Two, wait a minute. We still have a lot of problem to solve in the infrastructure layer. So the critical issue here is that the storage cost on Ethereum will be super expensive. On main net, for example, one gigabytes of data on chain data will cost roughly 10 million us dollar. That is unacceptable for a lot, a lot of web two applications, even for a lot of mfts, they have very few metadata. They're very expensive, but still super expensive. One solution that we can find to alleviate this problem is to use aperture Nova with the ac, which we already experiment, for example, Vitalix block on top of that.
00:11:53.680 - 00:13:03.350, Speaker A: But at the same time, we believe we need even better solutions to address this storage issue so that we are able to combine the power of storage, scalability storage and also Ethereum, both in terms of scalability. And so that's why we propose ESO storage. That is a storage layer. Native storage layer for Ethereum designed for Ethereum, it aims to scale the Ethereum storage to petabytes with one to the 1000 cost reduction. And thanks to Ethereum foundation, we also received ES grant support for the ease of Storage project itself, which was just announced last month with the L2 community grant. So with all these possibilities that we enable on top of Ethereum infrastructure, we believe that we are able to achieve much, much better web future web3 that build on top of Ethereum. So we are able to scale dramatically so that we can serve anybody anywhere in the world with billions of users.
00:13:03.350 - 00:13:54.740, Speaker A: And we can be much much more fully decentralized versus we still have to rely on HTTP, DNS, all kinds of centralized components. We have native Webster access core protocol so that we are able to perform from front end EVM and lastly, storage, the whole stack now can be fully decentralized on top of Ethereum and we do not need to another third party trust in the whole layers. And so thank you very much for attending my presentations. I will really happy to answer your questions. And after stage we also has a booth near the polygon and near. So welcome to come and I'm happy to looking forward to see you there. So thank you much.
