00:00:00.570 - 00:00:24.800, Speaker A: Whoa. Okay. Yay. Great. So I'm apparently supposed to talk about digital states. So to start off the way. Yeah.
00:00:24.800 - 00:00:51.022, Speaker A: That I tend to think about these things is that new institutions are never going to be exact carbon copies of old ones. Right. They're never going to be a better version of something that fits into the exact same box. Right. So when you have cars, cars don't perfectly replace horses. There's things that horses can do that cars don't do. There's things that cars do that horses don't do.
00:00:51.022 - 00:03:24.080, Speaker A: There's a lot of differences between them. And when we talk about even the Internet replacing telephones, or the Internet replacing some aspects of in person communication, it's not about creating a new thing that is like the old thing, except it's just better because you add this piece of magic pixie dust, and one particular aspect of it becomes 37% better. For whatever reason, it often does end up changing how we actually relate to what fundamental problems that we're trying to solve. Right. So when we talk about the digital state, I even find it less interesting to ask the question of, say, what can city governments do to become more digital? Or what can national governments do to become more digital? Or how can we coordinate 10,000 people to go to the same location in the middle of a desert in Nevada and hopefully actually create a new city with fancy blockchain, quadratic stuff that actually works? Well, all those questions are interesting, but prefer to kind of step back and just think about this from the point of view of what are we trying to accomplish and why are we even having this conversation? What are the tools that we have and how do we kind of start to narrow the gap between the tools and the results? So I think the most fascinating thing about at least this particular Ethereum community is that it just has this lovely combination of a whole bunch of very positive cultures that I like, right? So the first very positive culture aspect that I like is just the fact that this is a culture that is very interested in ideas, like creating new institutions, creating new ways for people to cooperate, creating new governance structures, even creating new communication structures, thinking about relationships between communication and governance, and actually using things like blockchains and cryptography and incentives and tools, and putting them together into these different arrangements where hopefully we'll build something that allows us to work together on something better in some way. So that's the first thing that I like. The second thing that I like is there is, I think, very cooperative aspects to the community.
00:03:24.080 - 00:04:04.310, Speaker A: Everyone here is working together. Everyone here is kind of aligned on this several different, many different visions, but still fairly aligned visions on just how to actually turn all of this into some kind of a better world. And we even see a lot of very positive interactions between the crypto community and institutions. Right. So the governor, Jared Polis, spoke here. There's plenty of other people from local government, from many other institutions that are here. What was that? Wyoming Dow.
00:04:04.310 - 00:04:44.626, Speaker A: Yay, Wyoming. Wyoming is okay. Yeah. I was going to mention, I think the Wyoming Dow law is actually great. And it's like one of the, in my opinion, the Wyoming Dow law actually is one of the best examples so far of governments doing something that goes beyond just not breaking the industry. That is actually really helpful to the crypto space's ability to thrive. Because what it basically is, is government passes a law, and it basically gives dows this new superpower.
00:04:44.626 - 00:05:06.240, Speaker A: They can incorporate and they can now legally own property, and they can actually legally do things and act as legal entities. That's probably one of the most powerful kind of bridges between the crypto world and the traditional world that we have. Right. And so because of that, things like Citidao can exist. Because of that, plenty of other projects can exist. Right. So that's amazing.
00:05:06.240 - 00:06:57.330, Speaker A: So, I guess, okay, in Colorado and in Wyoming, there seems to be this lovely spirit of collaboration between the crypto community and government and many other kinds of institutions. So this is good, right. Then the question is, well, okay, so there's people in the crypto community and there's people in existing institutions that are interested in these goals of using these new technologies to help people cooperate better, to create more open, more free, and more fair, more transparent forms of cooperation? And how do we actually take that energy, and what kinds of specific things can we work on in order to actually start to get closer to those kinds of outcomes? Now, the reason why I kind of phrase things in this way is that it doesn't matter as much who does it, right? So, for example, if the state of Colorado does something that enables some kind of crypto support across the state, it doesn't matter which, then that's one way of doing it. But what if instead, the state of Colorado creates some kind of law that makes it easier for independent groups, whether it's dows, whether it's local governments, whether it's something else, to basically work together themselves to achieve that same outcome, and you end up having the same result. Right. So sometimes I think there is this solution of taking existing institutions and kind of pushing them in this direction, and then sometimes there's this approach of this kind of more bottom up approach, right. Where you start with a small scale, but something that's kind of purely crypto and purely digital, and you do some experiments, and some of those experiments fail, some of those work, and you scale it up from there.
00:06:57.330 - 00:07:31.582, Speaker A: And these two paths are not opposing. Right? Like, sometimes people think of these two paths as opposing. I don't actually think that they are opposing. I actually think that often they can complement each other. So often, Wyoming Dal law is excellent example there, right. Institutions can do something where once they do it, the institution doesn't need to do anything else, and it actually creates space for the bottom up community to do all of this work and actually make all of the amazing progress happen. Right.
00:07:31.582 - 00:08:27.114, Speaker A: So I think that's one definitely great path to take. Other paths to take would be obviously starting from the institution and kind of adding pieces on top. Right. So at the end of last year, I wrote this article on citicoins, and city coins are this kind of concept that people have been starting to think about. And there's this idea of, can we create coins that are attached to cities somehow? And could potentially introducing city coins actually fix incentives and improve local governance? And there are some interesting things that you can do there. Right. So how can you create economic alignment between people in a city and the whole city? I think the traditional way of doing this tends to be about encouraging, basically, property ownership and land ownership.
00:08:27.114 - 00:09:00.202, Speaker A: And everyone must own a house. And if you don't own a house and you love your avocado toast, you're a bad person. I love my avocado toasts. But the reality is that houses are non fungible. Houses are, you're either a renter and you're negatively exposed to your community, or you're a buyer and you're just massively overexposed to your community. And the reality is that they're both irresponsible, then houses are not. They do not create economic alignment with the entire city.
00:09:00.202 - 00:09:46.950, Speaker A: They create economic alignment with a very small portion of a city, and often in ways that create conflict with the rest of the city. Right. So people often are like, we want more development. We want more great stuff, but not in my backyard. Right. So the idea of can we create cities that have more economic alignment inside them? And can we come up with techniques other than individuals owning specific pieces of property? I think it's a really good idea, and it's an idea that we don't know exactly the correct way to implement that idea, but there's room for a lot of good experiments. And I guess this category of city coins would be one thing that we call those experiments.
00:09:46.950 - 00:10:46.940, Speaker A: Right now, city coins are just, like, one example of a thing that can be done, but then there is the question of who does it, right? And here, again, there can actually be a lot of different answers. Right? So, like, miami coin, for example, is like this interesting project on one end of the spectrum where they basically say, like, okay, this is basically just a community project. And it starts as a community project, and it doesn't have any kind of direct connection to the city government. Like, you don't actually have city defined legal rights as a result of it, but it's gotten some support from the government, and maybe over time, the coin's role might change. Who knows? So that's one way of doing it. Another way of doing it would be for the city itself to actually create the coin. So which of those approaches you take, could you take some approach in between? It depends on the situation.
00:10:46.940 - 00:11:37.962, Speaker A: But in general, if you are a city government and we want something like that to exist, then both of those routes do exist. Right. One of the things that you can do is you can do it yourself. And one of the things that you can do is you can create the environment that makes it possible for other people in the community to basically do all of the work for you, because there are lots of people in the community, and there are lots of people that are very willing and very excited to do these kinds of interesting things and really empower people. But in order for that to happen, you actually do need to somehow create a framework that is supportive of them. There are frameworks that are supportive of people. There are frameworks that are kind of, like, actively, I guess, antisupportive of people.
00:11:37.962 - 00:12:38.000, Speaker A: Right? So legal frameworks that, for example, make it easier to launch a token, the less your token promises people in some ways that's actively antisupportive and coming up with structures that are better and coming up with, say, ways for people to launch tokens where you actually have. That are more friendly to. More friendly to the project, the more aligned its incentives are. This is like the sort of thing where we do need kind of lots of people to work together to actually make it happen. And it is the sort of thing that, where it's great that we actually have lots of different kinds of people all in a room where people have all of these different interests and perspectives and can actually start working together. That is only one example. Right? So there's plenty of other examples as well.
00:12:38.000 - 00:13:18.220, Speaker A: The concept of Dow governance in general. Right. And there's this question of how do we actually create these Dow based structures that actually do something in the mainstream somewhere. Right. I think, obviously, a lot of people here are working on dows, and I feel like a lot of people here are working on Dow governance. There are plenty of ways of improving Dow governance. So the way that many dows are governed today, coin voting, I've written about this many times, coin voting is just terrible now.
00:13:18.220 - 00:14:02.322, Speaker A: Okay, wait, I get claps, which is saying coin voting is terrible. Um, coin voting is good. Okay, good. Maybe I should just come up with a list of things and come up with a list of judgments and randomly shuffle them and see what the response is. But, okay, let's see. Should we start? Yeah. So there's lots of things that we can do to kind of improve blockchain.
00:14:02.322 - 00:14:30.290, Speaker A: So, for example, if we want to really scale blockchains up, I think sometimes we do have to make some compromises for decentralization and do some data center scaling. Clap for data center scaling. No, you're not supposed to clap for data center scaling. Okay, exactly. Decentralization. No data centers. Unless.
00:14:30.290 - 00:15:26.470, Speaker A: Milo. Okay, if the data centers are generating ZK snarks, and I can verify the ZK snark on my phone, then fine. So speaking of ZK starks, actually, when we talk about this kind of concept of blockchain voting, this is one of those topics that I think is very interesting. And I think it's, like one of the natural kind of synergies between cryptographic technology in general and a lot of the kind of governance ambitions that people have. But in some ways, this is one of the most challenging things to do well. Right. And basically, the reason is that, on the one hand, I think in general, we do need to have, there is a big opportunity, I think, to add much more of what I would call kind of good high bandwidth democracy.
00:15:26.470 - 00:15:51.098, Speaker A: And today we have lots of low bandwidth democracy. Right. Like, you cast a ballot once every four years. So low bandwidth, one bit of information every four years. We have lots of high bandwidth things that are not democracy. We have lots of high bandwidth markets, for example, we also have lots of low security, high bandwidth democracy. Voting on social media.
00:15:51.098 - 00:16:47.626, Speaker A: Right? Someone makes a tweet, it gets 50,000 likes, 50,000 retweets in two minutes. Well, maybe it's actually one guy controlling all of them and it's a bot, and you have no idea. Right. The challenge is that there clearly is this big need for kind of high bandwidth democracy in general, and there are already a lot of these applications that are providing high bandwidth democracy, but they just tend to have very crappy security. And so the question is, can we have kind of like higher security, high bandwidth democracy? And this is one of those things that I actually think potentially some kind of combination of cryptography and zero knowledge proofs and encryption actually can provide. Right. I think you do need all of the technologies, so you need the encryption to make sure that nobody can see the votes.
00:16:47.626 - 00:17:21.286, Speaker A: You need zero knowledge proofs to make sure that the votes are being counted correctly. You need blockchains to make sure that whoever's counting the votes is not censoring anyone. So you actually do need all of the pieces to come together, and you actually can create something with some pretty strong properties. And there are even projects being kind of homegrown within the ethereum space that are trying to make things like this possible. But in order for this to really work, it has to really bid down well. Right? It has to be efficient. It has to actually be secure.
00:17:21.286 - 00:18:06.840, Speaker A: It has to actually be privacy preserving. And in terms of where to actually accomplish this, I actually feel like focusing on kind of national level votes is almost like the wrong place to start. It's like the last thing you should do instead of the first thing. Right. I think in general, adding kind of crypto features to existing governments can sometimes the best way to make it work is not to actually add in crypto modifications to things that already exist. It's to build completely new things that have better properties that people are going to appreciate because they make it possible to do things that are not possible today. Okay.
00:18:06.840 - 00:18:58.998, Speaker A: Yeah. So this is a big part of why, for example, I'm a big fan of quadratic funding, right? And I think quadratic funding is even something that could easily be applied at the government level, right. Or at the state level, at the city level, at many kinds of political levels. There are many kinds of local public goods. And people do have all sorts of kind of this widely distributed information about what kinds of these public goods they actually find valuable. And so if we want to actually kind of gather together this kind of information, then we do want something that's high bandwidth. We do want something where people can participate at a reasonable frequency, and we also do want something that's secure.
00:18:58.998 - 00:20:53.466, Speaker A: Right? So if we come up with some fully decentralized, blockchain based quadratic funding platform that provides all of the security and the privacy guarantees that a governance system needs to have to be resistance to things like, say, bribery attacks, this could actually be something really valuable, right? And if something like this gets built, then potentially it could just get adopted. Now, in some ways, a lot of this stuff doesn't even need to kind of wait for big institutions, right? In some ways, the blockchain space all by itself is powerful, right? And the blockchain space all by itself, it can build things and the blockchain space by itself can do demonstrations and even gitcoin grants. By itself, I think, has been just an amazing demonstration. We have like twelve rounds of quadratic funding supporting important public goods in the Ethereum ecosystem. We've had a lot of chances to see what it looks like with tens of thousands of participants, what kinds of things it's great at what kinds of things it misses. And it's actually, in my opinion, become like a pretty significant and important tool in how the Ethereum ecosystem funds things that people in the ecosystem consider know, the more experiments and the more demonstrations like this that you can do, theoretically we could just go and say we are just going to have a giquin grants round for, say, businesses in Boulder, for example, right? That is something that the community in Boulder can do. And I think it's interesting, this kind of trying to start materializing kind of like the benefits of the online community into the offline world.
00:20:53.466 - 00:21:47.786, Speaker A: I think it's something that we actually can start doing more of. It is something that the crypto space has kind of tried doing repeatedly on a number of occasions, right? So, like for example, back in 2013 when we had bitcoin and when we had bitcoin payments and back when cryptocurrency transaction fees were still so low that being cheaper than PayPal was part of the sales pitch. It will be again. But I should have come up with some phrase by some famous military leader that had to retreat from a country and promised to return. But Ethereum, with five cent transaction fees, we will be back. And roll ups are already making a huge amount of progress. Shorting is already making a huge amount of progress.
00:21:47.786 - 00:22:29.500, Speaker A: So it's not just words. The soldiers are already under development. But anyway, back in those days when we did the. When people would actually try to figure out specific cities or specific districts and convince people in this very large districts to just accept cryptocurrency. Or I guess in that case accept bitcoin, right? Because back then, realistically, bitcoin maximalism kind of was correct in that every cryptocurrency except for bitcoin wasn't that interesting back in 2013. But anyway, in my opinion, it was interesting. It's something that can create local community.
00:22:29.500 - 00:24:04.474, Speaker A: So now that scaling technology is actually are on the horizon, it might actually make sense to kind of go back and start doing some more of this, more of that sort of stuff, right? But when we do that doesn't have to kind of limit itself to just things like convincing stores to accept eth for payments, right? That could actually mean things like actually doing quadratic funding rounds. Like basically saying, hey, we as a community are going to organize like say a $2 million matching pool, and people can go and actually vote and kind of participate in the quadratic matching, and we can actually see how that goes as an experiment, right? We can actually start doing these things. And if these things are successful, then I think that they're going to be picked up on. So quadratic funding is, in my opinion, one of those kind of examples of what I would call high bandwidth democracy that has actually been definitely not perfect for everything, but it has been good at capturing some important niches that existing forms of funding are missing. And so the other question is, where do you go from there? Right? There is lots of these kind of different pieces of infrastructure that need to happen. Like there is payments, there is this kind of concept of identity and reputation. And the concept of identity and reputation already has been making a lot of progress, right? I think people think about Ethereum identity in the wrong way, or people think about kind of blockchain id in the wrong way.
00:24:04.474 - 00:25:02.800, Speaker A: Right? And what I mean by this is, I believe in blockchain id, but I do not believe in blockchain id platforms. So what I mean by this is, I think the version of Ethereum based identity that's going to succeed is the version that is being implemented as we speak that has been happening over the last few years without anyone actually calling it that. And the people that are trying to do an entire stack themselves, they're basically just creating kind of silos isolated from the ecosystem that are going to fail. So what do I mean by Ethereum identity that we already have? So we have ens, right, the Ethereum name system. So if you have an Ethereum address, then you can register an ENS name and you already have something that people can use, like kind of, you basically have a decentralized username for the Ethereum world. If then we have sign in with Ethereum. So you can use your Ethereum account, whether or not you have an ENS name, to sign into services, including centralized web services.
00:25:02.800 - 00:25:41.110, Speaker A: And these two compose with each other. So for example, if you go to chat, blockscan.com. So Etherscan made this lovely chat application that actually accepts sign in with Ethereum. And if you have an Ethereum address, you can sign in, but everyone's going to see your name as like zero, x, blah blah blah, 40 squiggly characters. Now, if instead you have an EnS name, then people are going to actually see your account as being your Ens name, as your username, right? So we already see synergies between those two things already. Then we have attestations. So there's proof of humanity attestations.
00:25:41.110 - 00:26:32.554, Speaker A: There's just whether or not your account sent a transaction. It's like the simplest form of blockchain based antispam you can possibly have. There is potentially in the future whether or not you're running a validator. There is whether or not you have a pope. There is. What kind of pope do you have? So there is this growing ecosystem of attestations about accounts that are happening, right? And this is sort of the ethereum identity layer that already exists, that's already growing and it's open, and it's this kind of growing kind of ecosystem that anyone can take advantage of and anyone can piggyback on. So going back to kind of like building the digital state, then one of the questions to ask would be like, well, don't really think about it in terms of kind of the state creating its own kind of closed silos system.
00:26:32.554 - 00:27:59.414, Speaker A: Actually think about the question of, well, can we design this more digital government infrastructure in a way that it's actually more open and that it actually does kind of talk to, or at least it's able to talk to some of these things that the Ethereum community is building. So I guess conclusions from all of this are, one is, I think, this kind of really important idea of don't think about it in terms of what can this specific institution do. Think about it in terms of what problem is being solved and what are the different groups of people that can work together to actually do it? Right. And often you are going to need different groups of people from different parts of the room to actually work together. This is actually one of the most beautiful things that I've seen about crypto. We just have huge amounts of cross institutional collaboration that just nobody even recognizes. So, like, for example, zero knowledge proof protocols, zero knowledge proof protocols get frequently designed by and kind of collaborated in things like telegram chats and all sorts of other informal media that contain some combination of, you have university scientific researchers, Ethereum foundation researchers, aztec people, zcash people, and it's just kind of this assorted bash of people, and if something needs to be done, they just come together and they do it right.
00:27:59.414 - 00:29:01.514, Speaker A: So we have that for technology. We've had that for many zero knowledge proof algorithms. We have that more and more for all kinds of things in the Ethereum ecosystem, like ERC 4337, account abstraction started with a telegram chat, and there's people from at least four different organizations that are just coming in and working together and just working on making it happen. Right? So that kind of approach, and basically seeing what is the function that you're trying to accomplish and who are the people that needs to actually work together and make it happen, and can we actually make that happen? Can we actually get people to work together and make it happen? There's a lot of things that I think we can really innovate in. So I think in some ways, decentralized governance is kind of one of the big challenges of the 21st century. And I think it's an important challenge even going kind of far outside of the crypto space by itself. Right.
00:29:01.514 - 00:30:33.238, Speaker A: I think it's coming up with forms of governance or even just kind of large scale social systems in general that satisfy kind of a lot of the properties, including many of the properties that the crypto space is really going after. It is something that's really important for many kinds of people. Right? So how can we actually make that happen? What kinds of people needs to come together to make this happen? How do we actually make that collaboration happen? What is one particular instance of the problem that we actually can start to get solved? Really trying hard to kind of push quadratic funding and getting quadratic funding out there as something that just more and more people in all kinds of ecosystems do, that could be an answer. Could there be other kinds of local governance applications? Could there be some kind of micro voting happening on street by street zoning or whatever? I don't know. Potentially, if you want something that the community can do by itself, we don't even have to do binding votes. You can start with signaling votes. I think the ethereum ecosystem actually, way back in the good old days, way back when we had more kind of deeply controversial eips than we did today, there was this interesting kind of custom where people would do these kind of community and non binding signaling votes on them.
00:30:33.238 - 00:31:15.166, Speaker A: Sometimes they would be coin votes, sometimes they would be like votes with up votes and down votes on GitHub. Sometimes they would be votes by known community members. And people would just make these votes and there would also be non binding, but they would be internal signals that people could still listen to and determine whether or not some particular thing that they want to do actually would have consensus. Right. Signaling votes might be another sort of application that the community here could start doing. And then over time it could kind of end up growing. And something that is started as a purely kind of advisory and signaling thing could potentially get kind of taken up by existing institutions.
00:31:15.166 - 00:32:14.806, Speaker A: And if it works well, then it could just kind of naturally start getting assigned more and more importance. Right. So kind of can you build something that does something now, but does something enough useful now that if it succeeds well enough, then it is in a good position that existing institutions could just decide to kind of assign more and more power and more and more importance to it, and then it starts scaling up as a new institution. From Glenn Wilde talks a lot about kind of what he calls fork and merge governance. And in some ways this is like a similar idea. Right? It's like, can you create kind of these institutions that start off being completely independent, and if they succeed, kind of the goal basically is that they just start becoming more and more important. And you can't say they replace existing things because I don't think the goal is like replacing existing things so much as it is creating entirely new things.
00:32:14.806 - 00:32:49.106, Speaker A: And maybe the result of creating entirely new things is that existing things stop being important. But that's. Yeah, so, you know, maybe start by creating these entirely new things and then like, let's, you know, see what happens. Right. So that's some another thing. And then third piece is like the technology, right? So like, we do have to think about what is the technology that needs to be built to kind of make all of these different things possible. I think scalability is number one because scalability is always number one.
00:32:49.106 - 00:33:34.020, Speaker A: Aside from, of course, the switch to proof of stake, the switch to proof of stake is important. And there are, I think, a lot of people that do have these deep concerns about the environmental issues of cryptocurrency as today. And I do think those concerns are fair. And I think our response to these concerns never has been that those concerns are fake news. I think our response has always been that, hey, this is why proof of stake has been part of Ethereum's roadmap almost since the beginning. And this is why finally, after seven years of research and development, proof of stake is finally literally running on working testnets and it's looking like a month away from final launch. Yeah.
00:33:34.020 - 00:34:20.718, Speaker A: So actually, on that topic, I have an interesting suggestion. If you're listening to this and you're from an institution and you're really interested in doing something with Ethereum, but you know that you're going to get criticism because people are concerned about environmental issues. Then here's what you could do. You could announce that you're interested in launching this crypto integration or this Ethereum integration, but you are going to do it the week after Ethereum does the merge. If the Ethereum merge gets delayed until 2025, you're not going to do it until 2025. If it happens in June, you're going to do it in June. Right? Like just announce that.
00:34:20.718 - 00:35:20.334, Speaker A: And so you're not contributing to the environmental challenge. In fact, you're contributing to the motivation for this community to kind of keep, to keep up the good work and finally get the thing over the finish line. So this is. Yeah, so technology scalability is important to, the proof of stake is important and also privacy. I feel like I try to talk a lot about blockchain privacy, but blockchain privacy actually is really important. So blockchain privacy is important in actually just like so many different ways. I would probably say one of the biggest misconceptions that people have about privacy in general is that privacy is either entirely or even primarily a tool for resisting bad institutions.
00:35:20.334 - 00:36:45.706, Speaker A: Now, to be clear, I think resisting bad institutions is important. There is plenty of not just governments, but also corporations, but even just public mobs, just like all kinds of actors that do things that they really should not be doing. And people being able to do things privately without kind of broadcasting to the world or broadcasting to the powers that be, everything that they're doing as part of their lives is a really important check and balance against that sort of thing. But I think that's not the only function of privacy. The other function of privacy is actually that privacy is often a very necessary part of making institutions that work. Probably the biggest example of this is the secret ballot, right? So everyone's familiar with the secret ballot, right? Like when you vote with a paper ballot, the voting is done in such a way that no one can tell where you're, no one can tell who you voted for, and you can't prove how you voted even if you wanted to prove how you voted. The system does try very hard to make it easy to show that the votes are counted correctly, but at the same time, it preserves this privacy and it preserves this kind of inability to prove how you participated.
00:36:45.706 - 00:37:14.274, Speaker A: And this is really powerful, right? It's really powerful because you can't coerce people to vote in a particular way. You can't coerce people not to vote. You can't buy people's votes. You can't sell your vote. And this is all a really important part in preventing the entire system from basically being captured by concentrated interests that are willing to throw huge amounts of money into buying up everyone's votes. Now you might be cynical and you might think that, but they do this anyway. It's called lobbying.
00:37:14.274 - 00:38:07.240, Speaker A: But no, if you lobby, okay, fine, you can pay people to blab to politicians and give them nice dinners and fine, but there's still this much bigger filter. There's a very huge difference between that and literally actually not even having to come up with arguments that convince people. Because your argument is like, hey, if you vote for me, I'm going to give you $15, by the way. Okay, can I just do a quick poll? Everyone close your eyes. Secret ballot. Who here would vote for who? Some stranger on the street tells them to vote if they gave him $15. Okay, see, it's surprisingly virtuous crowd here.
00:38:07.240 - 00:38:54.646, Speaker A: $150 getting up. President peep. Yeah. Okay. But once those numbers start going up. Okay, so this is actually a good point, right? So I think if you make secret ballots, if you try to make bribes, kind of like as blatant as like, hey, if you vote for this guy, I'm going to give you $50, then often you're going to get lots of people who do resist. But here's what you could have, right? Especially in a blockchain context, especially in this kind of digital context where information travels much more freely and much more loosely, then you can obfuscate your bribes.
00:38:54.646 - 00:39:32.070, Speaker A: So I'm not buying your vote. I'm being a delegate. And as a delegate, I am offering rewards. As a delegate, I am sharing some of the public goods revenue that I get back to you, the people who support me. See, doesn't that sound like something you want to contribute to? But in reality, it's economical equivalents to bribing. Right? So this is like stuff that's already happened in lots of blockchains. Secret ballots are basically, privacy in general is like a really powerful tool in just limiting the damage that these kinds of things can do.
00:39:32.070 - 00:40:09.954, Speaker A: Right. And privacy in general is just a really powerful and really important just ingredient in making effective institutions. For that reason, I think it's a really powerful ingredient for democracy. It's even a really powerful ingredient for systems of communication. Right. I think one of the things that somebody should build is a platform where people can say things anonymously and they can upvote and downvote things anonymously. But in order to get an account, you have to zero knowledge proof that you're a unique human.
00:40:09.954 - 00:40:48.670, Speaker A: So, like, you have to zero knowledge proof that you have, that you have a particular proof of community profile, and only then can you participate, and only then do you get one vote. Right? So you get the privacy benefits of anonymity. But you know that if something has 300 upvotes, it was supported by 300 unique people and not some bot that just created 300 fake accounts. So this is one of the nice things that we can do with this technology. These are powerful tools. Right? Look, we could get very strong privacy and very strong safety and authenticity gains at the same time. And lots of people here in the room are big part of making this kind of technology possible.
00:40:48.670 - 00:41:25.386, Speaker A: So technology can make a big difference. Existing institutions, I think existing institutions, things like the Wyoming bill and things like some of the support to projects like citicoins that they've given, I think can be very helpful and very yay. Okay. By the way, is there anyone here from somewhere other than Colorado or Wyoming? Okay, cool. Yeah. So is anyone here part of a dow of any of those regions? Okay, cool. Yeah.
00:41:25.386 - 00:42:16.410, Speaker A: See? So we need Texas dows, right? So this is yay, Texas Dow. See, this is good, right? The question isn't maybe the answer to how do we cryptoify it? Like, say, Texas isn't, how do we convince the Texas state governments to add more things one by one? Maybe the solution is let's do Texas Dow. And then Texas Dow starts off being this kind of thing that's just a bunch of volunteers, and that just wants to do local community projects. And then more and more people join, and then it just becomes more and more powerful organically on its own. Maybe that is the solution. Right? So both of those solutions exist. You can basically convince the big thing to improve incrementally, or you can go incrementally by making a very pure, small thing and having it grow over time.
00:42:16.410 - 00:42:46.102, Speaker A: And both of those paths are good. And sometimes those paths even need to work together. So basically, those are kind of the takeaways. Try and think through what actually is the path toward making something with a large scale impact. Don't just think about how to reform one specific institution. Think about maybe the solution does actually involve people from three different groups coming together. Maybe the solution involves people from 20 different groups coming together.
00:42:46.102 - 00:43:14.000, Speaker A: And I think that kind of work is actually how we're going to kind of get somewhere close to this kind of guess, you know, dow based solar punk world where everything is happy and the buffer, buffercorns can dance and the buffercorns can accept Cardano. Okay, questions?
00:43:18.850 - 00:43:26.482, Speaker B: If you have a question, you can come down and get in line and we'll take them just for about seven minutes, maybe ten minutes.
00:43:26.616 - 00:43:27.170, Speaker A: Ten minutes.
00:43:27.240 - 00:43:30.210, Speaker B: Please. Hold on 1 second.
00:43:30.280 - 00:43:38.422, Speaker A: Yeah. No, privacy is important, right? I talk about privacy. Hold on.
00:43:38.476 - 00:43:39.320, Speaker B: Here you go.
00:43:43.530 - 00:43:44.038, Speaker A: Okay.
00:43:44.124 - 00:43:47.320, Speaker B: Wow, you guys are.
00:43:49.050 - 00:43:50.760, Speaker A: Okay. That's good.
00:43:52.030 - 00:43:53.050, Speaker B: Hey, how you doing?
00:43:53.120 - 00:43:53.354, Speaker A: Good.
00:43:53.392 - 00:43:56.314, Speaker B: How are the pants, by the way? Aren't those pants hot?
00:43:56.352 - 00:43:56.506, Speaker A: Right?
00:43:56.528 - 00:44:07.070, Speaker B: Let's get around applause. Dope. Yeah. My name is Tony, I'm from North Carolina. I got a question I think a lot of people want to ask. How do you feel about Solana?
00:44:07.410 - 00:44:10.270, Speaker A: I don't know. Solana school. It seems sunny.
00:44:15.250 - 00:44:27.960, Speaker B: Hey, Vitalik. My name is Brecken Hager. I actually started Texas Dao with a few lawyers here. It'll be legally recognized as the second Dow in America next week. My first question is, do you believe in God?
00:44:28.490 - 00:44:32.230, Speaker A: What is God? It depends.
00:44:32.730 - 00:44:33.314, Speaker B: Depends.
00:44:33.362 - 00:44:33.574, Speaker A: Okay.
00:44:33.612 - 00:44:51.980, Speaker B: And then the second question is, throughout history and with decentralization, especially mass decentralization, one great centralization is inevitable. How can Ethereum, and how can you make sure that this doesn't become a one world government?
00:44:53.890 - 00:45:31.914, Speaker A: So I guess how to make sure that Ethereum doesn't itself turn into some kind of centralized poll that actually controls things. Yeah, I think it's definitely an important question. I think the biggest defense that we have against that isn't even a technical defense. The biggest defense is like what kind of community that we have. And I think the biggest virtue that I think the community has that I want to see cultivated even more basically is the diversity that it has. And I mean the diversity in a very broad sense. Right.
00:45:31.914 - 00:46:14.790, Speaker A: We have people interested in, focused on technology. We have people in institutions. We have people in Texas. We have people in kind of far corners of the world that are very outside of the US. We have people that are interested in Ethereum in order to accomplish different things. And so my hope is that as long as the community kind of keeps the pluralist spirit that it currently has and that by itself can be a defense against either the Ethereum blockchain or kind of things that are closely attached to it from kind of turning into tools that get used to control people and impose bad outcomes.
00:46:16.570 - 00:46:51.940, Speaker B: Specifically speaking, my biggest concern with when I read the Ethereum white paper in 9th grade, it changed my life. But now with data parishioning around the corner. Oh, sorry, forgive me, don't data parishion our religious freedoms. That's all I ask. Short and sweet. So many members of the community are advocating right now for going full KYC and AML, for promoting the adoption of the masses and the institutions. What will your message to this sector of the community be?
00:46:53.270 - 00:48:26.894, Speaker A: I think the message is that one is just like privacy is important and another is that inclusion is important. And I think the biggest kind of inclusion that things like forcing KYC and AML into more layers of the ecosystem, prevent actually is it basically forces the system to discriminate much more by nationality. Right. Because it basically creates systems where if you're in the US and you have all of your us infrastructure, you can participate easily, but then if you are in some other country, then potentially your entire country might get labeled a money laundering risk, and then suddenly, just because of where you were born, you have a much harder time participating. And that sort of stuff really goes against what I think are a lot of the kind of core benefits that the blockchain space is trying to accomplish. So I would say that KYC and AML, at the level of exchanges and at the level of centralized, these infrastructure providers that are kind of serving as bridges from crypto to the rest of the space, that's fine, and that's legally unavoidable in any case. But I think it is really important, especially for things really close to the core of the space, to still have this kind of full level of both openness, compatibility with people's ability to preserve privacy and all these values.
00:48:26.894 - 00:48:36.340, Speaker A: Because if the base layer doesn't have those things, then nothing builds on top of it possibly can. Yeah.
00:48:37.270 - 00:49:02.150, Speaker B: Hey, Vitalik, my name is Oliver. There's a quote I think about a lot, and I can't tell if it's true. It says that society is downstream of technology, and I think you're uniquely qualified to give an opinion on this. Do you see society as more shaped by technology, as a force that inevitably moves forward? Or do you think we can pick our areas to innovate in places that are more likely to shape society in the way we?
00:49:02.160 - 00:50:36.970, Speaker A: I think society can be shaped by technology, but I think technology can also be shaped by culture. I can even give very specific examples of this. So one very subtle one is, let's take, say, sciub, for example, right? So Scihub, this online website where anyone can go and download scientific papers and the whole thing is totally copyright infringing in many cases, and it lets people get this stuff for free, despite the fact that there is this university publisher kind of like infrastructure and copyright and all this, that really doesn't want you to. So this exists for science papers, and it's very easy to use for science papers, but it exists less effectively for, say, music, for example. Right. And one of the reasons why I think it exists, the tools for doing this for scientific papers are so much stronger than the tools for doing this for music, is because there is an even stronger social consensus that scientific papers really should all be open access and free. And in reality, there isn't a good argument that this should be restricted because the scientists need to be paid, because while realistically we know that there are plenty of ways of paying them, and often the revenue collected by this kind of university system doesn't end up actually going to support research that much.
00:50:36.970 - 00:51:27.622, Speaker A: Right, and people can make those arguments for, say, music as well, and people like the pirate parties have. But I think in general, people believe that the case is significantly stronger in forced scientific papers. And so as a result of these moral views that people have, the technology, the tools for making scientific papers open access basically by force, is just much easier and much more developed. Right? So that's one tiny example of how even just moral views that people have end up influencing what specific kinds of, in this case, like, basically copy protection, evasion technology. But it could also be censorship resistance technology. It could also be technology in general that people spend their time working on. And I think that's true, ends up being true much more broadly.
00:51:27.622 - 00:52:41.726, Speaker A: So the more people value privacy, the more there are going to be smart people working on making zero knowledge proofs and encryption work much better and much easier to use. The more people value, say the like, the more people value doing, having a better life on the Internet, the more there will be software developed to try to make better forms of virtual reality, better ways for us to interact online. Meanwhile, the more people value interact, like improving the physical world, the more we're going to see all sorts of new kinds of advanced forms of transportation, the more we're going to see supersonic jets, the more we're going to see better ways of building buildings and all of this stuff. Right? And the rate at which those different trajectories can progress. I think it does depend on the kinds of values that people have. So I do think that technology definitely has big influences on society, technology has big influences on norms, but I think that culture has big influences on the technology that gets built as well. And I do think that eventually everything is going to get invented.
00:52:41.726 - 00:53:28.526, Speaker A: But I think the order in which things get invented does matter, right? And especially if it's technologies that have to do with things like privacy, where we're basically talking about giving the little guy the ability to resist or basically some kind of defense against the big guy, trying to snoop on everyone and see what everyone is doing. Right. In that case, it's not even a matter of how fast everything gets developed. It is a matter of like, well, is this side of the technology being developed faster, or is this side of the technology being developed faster? And I think if we have a culture that values privacy, then the technology that creates more privacy will actually develop faster than the technology that breaks privacy. And in my own opinion, that is a good thing. So answer yes, culture matters.
00:53:28.638 - 00:53:29.490, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:53:29.640 - 00:54:05.254, Speaker A: Yeah, culture matters. Hi, Vitalik. Hi. I had one question. What is one use case of blockchains that you think is overhyped right now? And what is one use case that you think is neglected and we should focus more on? I mean, neglected and we should focus more on? I think is the intersection of blockchains and zero knowledge proofs. People focus on it a lot, but I still think that people don't focus on it enough in terms of something that is overhyped. I mean, I'll give the boring answer, which is governance tokens.
00:54:05.254 - 00:54:28.706, Speaker A: I think people still do governance tokens too much. I think people should do more of, like, governance using any way that's not a token, just so we could experiment with new models and see what happens. Perfect. Thank you. And where'd you get those trousers from? A friend bought them for me as a gift. Hey, Vidalik, my name is Brian. Thanks for existing.
00:54:28.738 - 00:54:29.560, Speaker B: By the way.
00:54:33.130 - 00:55:38.362, Speaker A: Earlier today on this stage, a lady from the Polkadot ecosystem was asked the interesting question of what is something that Ethereum can learn from Polkadot? Her answer was, look at what they're doing with Kusama. Instead of having a bunch of testnets, have like, a live in production with real value, move fast, break things, and canter in the coleman. Is that a bad idea? I would definitely support, like, I definitely think that having something that's kind of like between a test debt and a main net that has some economic incentives definitely could be valuable. I think in general, we actually need to be bolder with our test debts. Like where is the Ethereum proof of stake test net that has a 1 second slot time? Where is the Ethereum test debt that has a 140,000,000 gasol image, just so we can see what happens. I think we do having more and different kinds of tested nets and including test nets that have more of. That have kind of enough realness to test economic properties and not just technical ones definitely something that I really support.
00:55:38.362 - 00:55:39.420, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:55:42.270 - 00:55:43.210, Speaker B: Thank you very much.
00:55:43.280 - 00:55:51.310, Speaker A: Dalak, we're out of time, dude.
00:55:51.970 - 00:55:54.880, Speaker B: You can stick around and do q a all night if you want.
00:55:55.730 - 00:55:57.278, Speaker A: I'll answer one last one.
00:55:57.364 - 00:55:59.140, Speaker B: All right? It's up to him.
00:56:00.630 - 00:56:02.370, Speaker A: I like the walk me hat, by the way.
00:56:02.440 - 00:56:24.220, Speaker B: One thing I just want to say before we answer the final question, because it's going to get scattered. We have the fire marshal here who's concerned about our exodus. So please do so calmly. We have the door through the other stage here, the infinity stage. It's actually open to the garage, so there's actually two equal exits. So thank you for coming. Vitalik, go ahead.
00:56:24.990 - 00:57:13.274, Speaker A: Thank you, sir. So I'm very interested in what you said about attestations other than proof of humanity. What do you think? Are the main building blocks still missing in that space, and how is that space going to evolve? Okay. One of the things that I'm excited about is this concept of either proof of participation or even proof of learning, proof of. Proof of having particular skills. So one of the places where this can be important is airdrops. I feel like airdrops are the sort of thing where initially everyone really loved them, right? Because there was the Uniswap airdrop, which in the middle of the darkest days of the coronavirus, just kind of like, stood up and said, hey, guys, everyone who ever used Uniswap got this lovely one $400 stimulus check.
00:57:13.274 - 00:57:40.046, Speaker A: And I think that was amazing. But obviously, since then, people have started gaming the air jobs. People have started, like, farming addresses, and there's professional vc farms that farm addresses and all this stuff. So if you want to improve your job. So from that perspective, then we make them proof of community gated. Right? Like, you need to have an account that actually has a proof of community profile. By the way, ideally, whenever I talk about this stuff, assume that this stuff should have some zero knowledge where you're in between to protect privacy.
00:57:40.046 - 00:58:28.302, Speaker A: It always should. But that only solves part of the problem, right? The other part of the problem with airdrops is that I think project teams themselves are increasingly unhappy with them. And the reason why they're unhappy with them is that you're basically spewing out large numbers of tokens to an undifferentiated mass of people without much regard for how much each of those people actually cares about your project. What you want to do is you want to distribute tokens to people who care. So this is where I think what would be ideal is if you learn something about a project you get some number, like, you get some number of tokens. If you perform some unit of work for a project, you get some number of tokens. If you help a project translate a page, you get some number of tokens.
00:58:28.302 - 00:59:55.494, Speaker A: And ideally, this would be done to one kind of basically give people kind of like an on ramp where people, while they are learning tokens, they would also actually be kind of becoming more like helping to understand the ecosystem, the project that they're participating in, and even be an on ramp to eventually having enough skills to be full time contributors. Right? So you're satisfying the function of being an airdrop and wide redistributing the tokens. And so it's okay if you're paying people $45 to do something that if you really wanted to, you could do much more cheaply, because the goal is you're paying $45 for people to potentially become a new user of this project and become much more useful way down the line. Right? So if we want things like that to happen, then some version of pope that proves that you did some particular thing, proves that you passed through some exercise that involves learning about how a project works, that proves that you just performed some kind of tasks inside of a project, like that sort of stuff. The more infrastructure like that we have, then one of the nice things that we can get that as a result is we can have better airdrops. And people have started doing this before. Right? There's Coinbase earn, there's rabbit hole GG, and there's this kind of growing list of projects.
00:59:55.494 - 01:00:31.974, Speaker A: But I do feel like we need, especially for projects that are launching new tokens, it will be amazing if we could see even more of that stuff. Yay. Okay. What up? Ba ba ba. What? Oh, can you turn? There we go. Here we go. All right.
01:00:32.012 - 01:00:40.870, Speaker B: Sorry. We need one woman to come up here, so she had something really important to say. So one more question, please. Vitalik.
01:00:40.950 - 01:01:44.140, Speaker A: Okay. Hi, my name is Irina, and I see very few women here and a lot of men. Question to you is, how do we get more women involved? And maybe in which sectors would you want to see or would you like to see them? What areas? I mean, the answer for where we would want to see women is, I think anywhere where women wants to be, I think. Right. But in terms of how to make that happen, I even feel like I'm not the right person to answer that stuff. Women who are part of the Ethereum space, and especially who feel like they are part of the space, who join the space later than they could have what is your answer? Actually, I even kind of wants to ask the crowd this more than myself. Okay.
01:01:44.140 - 01:01:55.390, Speaker A: It make a dower. Yeah. No, make a dow.
