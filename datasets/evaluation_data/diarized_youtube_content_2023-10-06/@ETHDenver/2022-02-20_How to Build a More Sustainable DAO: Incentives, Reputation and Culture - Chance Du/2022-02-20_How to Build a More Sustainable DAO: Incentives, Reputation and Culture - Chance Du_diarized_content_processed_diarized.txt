00:00:00.650 - 00:00:42.710, Speaker A: Hopefully you guys all have a great time in East Denver. This is my probably fourth time in East Denver or maybe third time the first time I was here speak in 2018 and they crowd probably just one fourth of the people today. So you can see how much it has been grow the crypto in past four years. And also just like many of you guys, when first time I come to East Denver, I really love the event. It didn't feel like a conference, it's more like a festival. So I feel like it's fit for crypto spirit. Today my topic is about daos.
00:00:42.710 - 00:01:28.950, Speaker A: I don't know how much you know about daos, so today's talk will be assumed. You already know a lot about dows, so I will not do a lot of basic introductions. So most are just my opinion thinking and based on the current the market of the Daos, the development to make some suggestions a little bit self introduction my name is Chance Du. I'm the founder of Bluemond. Bluemond is an earlier stage crypto fund that we invest in crypto infrastructures and application layers. Before Bluemond, I founded Coefficient Ventures in 2017. It's one of the earliest crypto venture fund.
00:01:28.950 - 00:02:12.660, Speaker A: We have portfolio companies today over probably 40% of our portfolio company. In my founder one become multibillionaire dollar companies. Back then we invest in them. Most of them are just early stage. They sit around startups. Some of portfolio companies including R Wave, Terra, Blockchain, orbit and Numeroi, those defi pioneers and Mycrypto recently announced by quadition for Metamask. And recently as Bluemond, we invested one Dao infrastructure project called Dao Panel and some of their knowledge approved privacy focused startups.
00:02:12.660 - 00:03:16.090, Speaker A: So that's my background. Okay, let's get started. Okay, so what is Dao? I think it's pretty easy for you to find the definition just online, just simple Google search. But there's a lot of misunderstanding in definitions because a lot of people will by default think it's automatic execution of smart contracts. It's thinking more advanced level, but actually I think the keyword is two. But right now mostly we are more in a stage two, which is I define as the smart contract system could solve specific problems pretty well, just like current AI artificial intelligence, a lot of people think AI is automatic human intelligence level, but the current stage of AI is not achieved. That just like DAos smart contract system very early for.
00:03:16.090 - 00:04:12.520, Speaker A: So right now for current technology and infrastructure, it's good to use the DAO and smart contract to solve specific problems in your projects. For example, like Makerdao is a very beautiful example for limited smart contract executions so perfectly with coin system. But we are not in the automatic execution level of Dow yet, which means a lot of people imagine you can just put a group of people together and people just automatically run things smoothly. That's not going to happen. We have this ideal imagination in 2016 in ZDaO, but obviously it didn't work. We failed at the first month, even a project before launch. So that's my understanding of the DAO.
00:04:12.520 - 00:04:48.196, Speaker A: So to understand the DAO, we needed to understand a bit about history. For me, I understand things quite in a simple way. So by understanding history you can just understanding through multiple projects together. So in my view, I think bitcoin is the first Dow. Even they didn't call itself a Dow or it didn't have smart contract system, but it's the true Dow because there is no leader, it's just run by himself. Even the leader didn't exist. It still runs smoothly and grow bigger and bigger every year.
00:04:48.196 - 00:05:26.640, Speaker A: So I think that's the true Dow. And then the second is b shares. A lot of people might be don't know. It was very old projects trying to build a decentralized ecommerce. Prideful extra maker Dow was initially trying to build on bit share, but it didn't work because their smart contract system is not sophisticated enough. So when 2015 Ethereum come out, Maker Dow is possible. So you can see how important is in our space, be infrastructure ready before we can build some validate applications.
00:05:26.640 - 00:06:09.276, Speaker A: And then obviously very famously a project called Zdao. Just like many of you may be inspired by Ethereum or bitcoin. For me, my personal story for Crypto actually was a project called Zdao. Because when I've heard about this project, I think it's a fantastic idea, could solve the problem of the globalization of ordinate of resources and humans. So I saw the potentials there. So I'm immediately intrigued to crypto space as a whole. And I decided to do four time join crypto in 2017 in next projects.
00:06:09.276 - 00:07:10.390, Speaker A: Important in Ethereum's crypto history is called Maker Dow. Makerdao was actually conceptualized in 2014, but because I think the technology is not ready at the time. So it eventually launched in 2017 was the Dow the dice launch. Another important project in 2017 of Dows is called Gatecoin. The importance is about Gatecoin was established a model that encouraged all the entrepreneurs in crypto in Dow space that you build application of the use force force ecosystem first and then launch token so Gitcoin success validated a model that we will talk about later about how to build a sustainable Dow model. And obviously a very important Dow molec Dow created by Amin. But some of the design I don't really fully agree with, I will talk about later.
00:07:10.390 - 00:08:10.532, Speaker A: And then there is a very important in 2020, which we have a very big market crush when Decentraland founding team decided to launch a Dow. So which means the founding team will be officially dedicated their centralized power to community in 2020, which everybody can see today, 2022 years later, Decentraland is still up running and even grow bigger. So we can see in some sense its Dow model, in some sense it success. And obviously it's a year of the Dow 2021 constitution, Dow and FWB and a big grand Dow was just launched recently. Is this like speak speed is good to understand or should I slower. Okay, thank you. So there are a lot of examples, those are just few that I think many people maybe know.
00:08:10.532 - 00:08:50.316, Speaker A: Citidao trying to put lines on Chan syndicate Dao are trying to build an investment platform protocol. Dao's platform Bitdao is launched by big exchange and then Assange recently. Those are just the sum of them. I think in this year, probably hundreds, even thousands Dow launched. But quantity always not main quality. Right? Okay, so in 2021 under 2020, because the infrastructure is mature in some sense. So in part, a lot of Dow be created.
00:08:50.316 - 00:09:51.568, Speaker A: So a lot of people think the Dow is coming the year of Dow 2021 or 2022. It's not because random, it's because some of the infrastructure is ready. That's a very universal truth in crypto space. If infrastructure ready and then could it enable certain applications to be built upon, just like a DFI booming because there was 19 and 18, there was a lot of layer one be built at that time. So after two, three years developments those protocol ready to deploy by some application errors just similar to Dows. So we have discord, we have multistake, we have snapshot, we have Zoom work from home, all the infrastructure that empowers a future of work which help the form of the Dows. So 2021 really become the year that the Dow become like the gigs utopia become the mainstream.
00:09:51.568 - 00:10:26.160, Speaker A: I still remember 2018, I was talking about Dow do a Dow representation. Not many people interested. I think my stage probably just have 20 people there. So they don't interest, not understand what's going on. But 2021, as you can see, you can talk to people on the street, they might know something about the Dow. Okay, so in my view, I think Dow will go to multiple stages and we are mostly in a stage two median level. So first level is very basic.
00:10:26.160 - 00:11:01.772, Speaker A: I would say that model applied to most of daos today. Basically just pull money together, right? We buy art, we buy constitutions, we buy a golf course, we buy sports team. So those are very simple just to pour money together. It's basically a crowdfunding 2.0. But the minors is maybe thousand such Dow launched. But what will happen next, right? Because southern team raised more than $10 million. What are you going to use for the money? Right.
00:11:01.772 - 00:11:41.076, Speaker A: I would say after three years probably 90% of the team will died out. You will never heard about them. Just like 2017 ICO, crazy area. So I think the next two, three years for those Dow that raise money is very crucial, the leadership, right? Does your governance model really work? Right. Does you really could trust community to govern? All right. So reliability to us is not always the case. And then the median level is the second level, which applies a lot of defi protocols like Makerdao or curve.
00:11:41.076 - 00:12:22.036, Speaker A: They do, some manage for the protocol level, very core infrastructure level or virtual level, but still have tremendous involvement of off chain activities and a centralized entity to govern it. Right. Still have a funding team today a lot of people are Project co dao, but in my view I didn't see much difference from tech startups. They are VC funding, they are VC backed. They have a core team that's usually from the Facebook, Google, those team. So when I view them, I most view them as start tech startups, not really close to what we imagined. Cordao so that's the median level.
00:12:22.036 - 00:13:06.230, Speaker A: I think the next level we're going to go to the upper level. But I think that level to achievement we need a lot of infrastructure. Be ready. We will talk about in next slides. So that level will be, I would say in so many daos, Makerdao is most close to that level. They have very decentralized team forming and they have the governance model governing the whole Dai stable system and buyback or all the mechanisms works perfectly because actually it's simple, right? I think, I still believe the word, the most important thing is still based on simplicity. So if you're trying to make governance model extremely complicated, I don't think it's going to work.
00:13:06.230 - 00:13:49.318, Speaker A: And the next final level will be automatic state, which today we're understanding the Dow in that level. But I think that level achievement is pretty far away from us. Just like artificial intelligence right now. AI could drive a car, could pick up Amazon packages, could assemble in cars. But if you like AI to go to a date or go to hang out with your friends might have a big trouble there. So there is a few category of daos today. There is one name that I put there, it's called spec Dow.
00:13:49.318 - 00:14:28.030, Speaker A: Spec was in a traditional financial system, it's special purpose acquisition vehicles. So basically pull the funds together for specific purpose so that I apply for today's sum of the Dao. I call spec dao, right. And the first grandstaw. Grandstaw is very widely adopted in most of defi protocols. For example, uniswap compound, most of the Defi protocol have the grant dao and venture dao. A lot of people trying to do a decentralized vc by building a venture dao.
00:14:28.030 - 00:15:12.332, Speaker A: The very famous example is Zidao. I was inspired to and special mention to trtd Dao is a Dao. I will mention last page that I got to be active as contributor to to build a decentralized venture Dow. And also there is a very unique social DAO, friends with benefits. They're just basically a community, right. People still didn't understand today why community has got to be valuable. I think it's about people, right? As long as you have people, you can do a lot of things.
00:15:12.332 - 00:15:50.920, Speaker A: So that's make it a value. So it's not about you gather people. I think the most difficult part is how could you keep those people engaged like always engaged, active, engaged or stay there a long time. It's not about attract people for one week or one day. That's easy, right? It just issues free tokens, but it's difficult part is how do you make them to stay there for one year and actually spend time to work for your Dow? That's a hard question. But today's Dow have a lot of issues as we can see. I point out in this slide.
00:15:50.920 - 00:16:49.036, Speaker A: So most of daos basically is a cross sourcing funding. So it's not very sustainable to think about what's the real value behind it right after you buy those arts or constitutions or what are you going to do with it. How could this extra data write go back to your protocol to increase your protocol values over the long term? That's not sure. Most of the daos and also very low turrets voting system, today's Dao, most of Dao's voting system is very naive. Basically you have how much token you can decide which protocol is going. It's just like, can you imagine United States in some sense it's true. The most richest people in the United States could decide which policy this country got to issue that's terrible governance model.
00:16:49.036 - 00:17:39.100, Speaker A: But that's the reality today. Many of the governance model that we have and also for the lack of repetition protocols, I think that's the most crucial part. To build a very organic incentive model you need to have a way to track every contributors, how they contribute to your system, to quantify them, be able to give them token distribution to incentivize them. I think there is a lot of team is working on it reputation system but there is not a valid one that are working yet. So that's a huge opportunity there for entrepreneurs thinking about to launch infrastructure projects in daos. And obviously many of dao just weren't a coat of daos. Not really daos.
00:17:39.100 - 00:18:30.582, Speaker A: Basically it's just a token offering. And they trying to use Dao to avoid risks. And many founders, you can hear today defi protocol or many founders they decided to leave the project without actually build a very reliable system or governance model for the project and then left that's not really a Dao. And then they just coated it. I think those behavior it's not going to be sustainable in our space. People will tell later on when you call it Dow and then really you just give up the projects. I don't want to name some of them projects.
00:18:30.582 - 00:19:06.422, Speaker A: So I think everybody will know. So what really is Dao? I think that the literature still didn't change. Even we have this fancy name of Dao. It's simply just a tool for entrepreneurs to use the fundamentalist still in the universal works model is you find out problems and you find a solutions and you build the solution to solve that problem. That's worked for traditional startups that also work for crypto. So it's not because you call it Dow. So automatically you can solve everything.
00:19:06.422 - 00:19:50.610, Speaker A: So still focus on final problems in a crypto ecosystem or in a real world. They're trying to use all the tools available to solve it. That's how a great startup is built. So fundamentally human nature still the same people looking for fearless, looking for trust, looking for inclusive and looking for opportunities. That's why so many immigrants come to America because they come to find opportunities. That's also why the last few decades the rise of United States because attract the Thailand to come here. So I think there's a lot of things Dao could learn from their government.
00:19:50.610 - 00:20:34.920, Speaker A: The model, the history that how could create Openness platform to attract Thailand from over the world that provide them fearless trust and inclusive. So that will be help create your organic dao culture. So why dao matters because I think it could make a tremendous impact to the world. It can democratize opportunities. Giving my personal story. I grew up in China. I think I have to make where I am today become to states.
00:20:34.920 - 00:21:31.930, Speaker A: But I think the Dow, our future of Dow in next five to ten years could enable a lot of kids or young Thailand people over the world with outcome to states could access capital, could access opportunities. Today there is a kid in Africa know how to code. They can directly work for Uniswap or compound or the top tier tech startups in the crypto world without coming to Silicon Valley. So I think that's very powerful. And also many of you, I can say all of you have been through the terrible Covid-19 situation. By watching the news. I felt strongly that because right now all this southern state was thinking their own positions.
00:21:31.930 - 00:22:30.402, Speaker A: They didn't really think in an aligned human perspective. Because those boundary and those solvent states dividends. So make it very hard to align human together to solve a same human trouble. So I can see here in the next few years it's possible to create a Dow that to organize to representing the human perspective, not just representing Americans or Chinese or any others. So I can see that a tremendous potential there for dows. And also I think next few decades we are facing increasingly slow economic growth trouble which I think when you in regionality girls is very limited. So it's time to restructuring globally, right.
00:22:30.402 - 00:23:29.486, Speaker A: To eliminate those artificial boundaries set by southern state to coordinate human resources, capital resource together to build companies, startups, dows that solve different world problems. So I think that will be served important economic growth in next few decades. So we need a sustainable model today. A lot of daos was very happy, the team is very happy it's party because they raised tons of money and the current market cap is super high. But doesn't mean it still be in that way in next year and d five sixes in 2021 and 2020. You can see DFI do solve some problems because so many token holders that they have the lead to trade those tokens to provide liquidity generally yield. So they find a problem to solve in the markets.
00:23:29.486 - 00:24:47.478, Speaker A: That's why Defi could be rive today. Okay, so I'm going to go just very quick because I'm a little bit out of time. So those are successful culture models and also some successful governance models. So I think we still could learn from a lot from the today's successful tech startups, or government or even religions, how they do the culture generate the positive organic culture or how they govern internally organization. So when you create web3, doesn't mean you gave up all the human experience that you generated past decades in building successful startups, successful countries. We can still learn from that. Building dows for legal there is no way that to avoid legal risk.
00:24:47.478 - 00:25:42.304, Speaker A: But there is two very important successful model by far is the only probably primary most cases those two, bitcoin and ether was not judged as security. So for people creating dows by starting those examples, it's more better to starting other protocols that you don't know it's going to be investigated in next few years or not. So by investigating bitcoin ether, how they structure this regulation will give you a better sense for legal risk of dows. Sorry I didn't manage your time well, today a lot of content have to pass through. I have prepared a lot of case studies. I think it should be pretty easy for you to just research online how it works each daos. And I think there's a tremendous opportunity in DaO infrastructure space.
00:25:42.304 - 00:26:27.020, Speaker A: A lot of people are building dao tools, but a lot of people building are not right tools or overlapping tools. So very obvious one reputation system, AP voting system, which means you have same token, but maybe certain token have different power, voting power. In that way you can kind of like today it's a lot of stock market, public market, the ceos usually have the much ten times higher voting power. Even they have the same amount of shares and decentralized collaboration tools, decentralized discord. And as you know today we use a lot of zoom or discord. Those are rape too. So I think there are a lot of opportunity to create a more decentralized version of those and DaO protocols.
00:26:27.020 - 00:27:03.156, Speaker A: I think the Dao governance model not going to apply for everything. I think it gets specific industry got to build their own governance protocols like venture Dow will be different and the DFI Dow will be different. MST Dow will be different. So a lot of vertical governance protocol opportunity there. So those are two projects I'm going to heavily involved in next year or two going to launching in 2022. The first is the venture Dow is my pay attribute or aspiration for the Dow. So I call it the return of the Dow.
00:27:03.156 - 00:27:26.610, Speaker A: And then another is the film Dow. So I think the best way to learn a Dow is building a Dow. So that's why I'm doing it. And my talk special thanks for those people. I get those opinions. Great resource to learn. Some of the project I mentioned on the slides are investment.
00:27:26.610 - 00:27:29.620, Speaker A: Thank you.
