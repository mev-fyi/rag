00:00:00.330 - 00:01:03.018, Speaker A: Today, I want to use our past five years experience, share with you what we have seen in the industry, what we think will be, will be most important for infrastructure providers moving forward, and also tell you a little bit of the trends that we have observed over the past five years. So first, a little bit industry overview. So when we started in 2018, we started working on proof of stake networks. That's more like delegated proof of stake networks, which means they have maybe 20 or 30 validators. And actually making sure those 20 validators have a strong connections with one another is somewhat challenging. Right? Even though we only have 2030 validators, it's actually one weak link in those validator sets can make the network somewhat unstable. But as tech evolves over the past five years, we started seeing networks wanting and needing 100 validators, 300 validators, 500 validators.
00:01:03.018 - 00:02:16.502, Speaker A: Now we're seeing hundreds of thousands of validators on Ethereum. So we definitely made a large progress since 2018. And from our point of view, a large validator set usually means it is more difficult for a single validator or a group of validators to basically compromise the network, right? So we would think networks like Cosmos, like Ethereum, will have a higher degree of decentralization such that those networks are more secure in the sense that they're more resistant to censorship, they're more resilient against attacks because of the large validator sets. Now, in addition to that, we think a large validator set means it's more inclusive, it's more fair for the bigger community to join the network, because you don't need $200 million worth of a token to be a validator on those networks. So it's easier for community to join in. So, again, back to our experience as a validator for the past five years, when we first started on yields on chawn network, we know there's only 21 validators, or 27 validators. Just a quick question.
00:02:16.502 - 00:03:11.302, Speaker A: How many of you guys have worked on yields or TRON, or maybe research a little bit on how to become a validator on those networks once? Thank you. Yeah. One, two, three. Yeah, but how many of you have researched how to become a validator on Ethereum? Yeah, more hands, right? So the reason being, if you did your research, you know, Ethereum, EOs, and Tron, you will probably need hundreds of millions of dollars of a token before you can become a validator. Currently, interestingly enough, those networks with only 21 validators, 27 validators, they don't have any punishment. If you are having downtime, if you're having double sign, you would think those network would need a harsher punishment because only have 21 validators, but that's not the case. Moving towards cosmos, we have 100 validator get started.
00:03:11.302 - 00:03:57.266, Speaker A: Right now it's towards 175. Now we started seeing downtime slashing if your node is down for 15 or 16 hours. But of course you also have double sign slashing. And fast forward to 2022. Now we are seeing over half a million validators on Ethereum, but if you miss one attachation, you started losing your stake. So we definitely see in this trend in the industry where networks are starting wanting more validators, needing more validators, and the responsibility of those validators are getting more and more heavier, right? So you can't have any downtime if you want to keep your state growing. So there are a couple more examples on proof of stake blockchains wanting more validators.
00:03:57.266 - 00:04:38.806, Speaker A: For instance, harmony, we started on harmony with 320 slots distributed over four shards of their network. Now we are seeing 900 slots on their network. And for near they started with 100, right? So they started pushing out chunk only producers. So they are talking 200 or 400 validators in their network. So we're definitely seeing this trend again in different networks trying to get more validators in the networks. So we have been collaborating with those networks. So we have seen the communities getting more and more engaged because of the larger number of validators they can get in.
00:04:38.806 - 00:05:31.318, Speaker A: They don't have to have, again, millions dollars of a token. They can have maybe 20, 30,000 token and they can still participate in the consensus. Okay, so now that we have talked about a lot of networks wanting more validators, but why those validator counts matters. So what do we think is, and what we have observed also is that, for example, Ethereum, we have a large number of individuals looking to become validators. So that means there are higher participations and more people trying to get into the space. What we have observed is that, for example, yos and Tron, most of the tutorials and how to become validators, so super representatives are written by institutions. They're talking about technical terms that an average staker will never understand.
00:05:31.318 - 00:06:34.438, Speaker A: They will never be able to become one, also because of lack of capital. But for Ethereum, we are seeing a higher degree of community wanting to share their knowledge about how to become a validator and share their experience working with different staking service providers. So this willingness of willing to share their experience with others, basically make sure the community keeps engaged and not dropping off. Because for depots for Yos and Tron, after I delegated my token, I don't have to pay attention to what's happening because of those 21 27 validators already taking care of the governance, they're taking care of the voting, I don't have to be engaged and I lose interest. But for Ethereum, we don't see that because more and more people are trying to get in and they are keeping engaged. Now, of course we have the Shanghai upgrade approaching, it's now in April, but we will actually see more capital coming in. That's based on our experience and talking to different partners.
00:06:34.438 - 00:07:33.062, Speaker A: I know a lot of people are trying to say, hey, maybe people are trying to withdraw, we'll see a drop in valid accounts. But actually, based on our observation and talking with our partners, there will be more capital coming in because of the added liquidity. They are actually feeling more confident to stake their capital so they don't have to worry about locking in their capital for two years without able to withdraw them. And one additional thing is that one capital other proof of stake on deposit networks, Ethereum will only have roughly 15% of the circulating supply staked. But what we have seen on other networks that they have 50%, 70% or even as high as over 90% on BNB network. So we are thinking we'll definitely see more stakes coming in. So that's when we have to have an infrastructure provider or staking service provider to help those folks to get into the market.
00:07:33.062 - 00:08:56.230, Speaker A: Because not everyone can set up 20,000 validators at one go and not everyone have the time to research how can I stake my wine eth with a staking pool? So that's the implication for staking service providers where we need to be able to stake 10 00 10,000 validators at a time for big institutions. But also we will be responsible for helping people with only 1.2 ETH or 0.2 ETH to join the staking pool, make sure it is as simple for them to stake also as the institutional stakers. Also, we have to make sure as a service provider, we must be sure that the infrastructure can handle that kind of traffic, right? If I have 20,000 validators added to my platform, I can't just go hire ten or 20 additional engineers and say, hey, please help me monitor and maintain those. It has to be automated, otherwise it's not a scalable solution. So what do we think in the infrastructure space is that we have to have a platform where we see the platform can handle one validators at a time, but can also handle adding 10,000 validators at a time for the network now this is a graph I call make me feel good statistics because this line can only go up.
00:08:56.230 - 00:09:41.350, Speaker A: This is the number of validators over the past year because you can't withdraw so you cannot stake. So this will always go up. But one interesting thing we have seen is that at the end of the graph you can see the close to the Shanghai upgrade. Actually we haven't seen people trying to cool down their staking action. We're actually seeing an increase in slope where more people are trying to get in the Ethernet staking. So just check this morning actually there are close to 9000 validators waiting in the queue trying to get active in the ecosystem. So closer to the upgrade we're definitely seeing more and more people trying to get into the ecosystem and be involved in the overall ecosystem.
00:09:41.350 - 00:10:34.630, Speaker A: So get to my point. Why staking providers may struggle first is that if they don't have an infrastructure ready to commit 20,000 validators, they won't be able to do it as more capital to come in. And also if they can make it more inclusive to go with the Ethereum's ideology to make more people involved then those people with one ETH or less than 32 ETH won't be able to get into the network. And then we are seeing a lot of people trying to get away and maybe lose interest in the whole network. So the staking service provider infrastructure providers have to be prepared for this upgrade and make sure everyone can get involved no matter how much stake or how much capital they have. Now that's why I get to how we can adapt. First we have to have the platform to make sure that staking process is easy.
00:10:34.630 - 00:11:02.142, Speaker A: And I have three, five more slides to show you how great we are doing at this. But I think I want to make a quick example to give you sort of a train of thought to understand what in stones is doing right now. So may I ask how many of you are using MacBook? One. Two. Three. Okay, so how many of you are using pc? None. One.
00:11:02.142 - 00:12:18.822, Speaker A: Okay, so the rest of the guys, you must be coming in the horse carriage or maybe you're using Linux. But to my points, no matter what kind of operating system you're using, maybe you're using a Dell laptop, maybe you're using MacBook Pro, maybe you're using MacBook Air or the desktop version. No matter what laptop or computer you have, you always have that operating system on your laptop to make sure no matter what you want to do and what's your configuration, you always have the laptop by your side to help you process your task. So that's what influence is trying to do for the blockchain space, is that no matter which blockchain you want to get on and what kind of setup or infrastructure configuration you want you have, we should be able to help you to manage those nodes and make sure you have the access to those blockchain networks. No matter it's for staking for API, or if you just want a couple of full nodes for your team, infestones should be that operating system for you so that you always have your device ready when you need to access the blockchain. So I would not go through those slides because it's telling you how great we are. But I think you have a good idea on what we want to do for the space.
00:12:18.822 - 00:12:45.246, Speaker A: And what we're trying to achieve for the ecosystem is to make sure no matter which blockchain we are on, the 70, 80 blockchains that we have integrated, we want to help with the decentralization and we want to help more people to get involved in the blockchain space. So, yeah. Thank you. That concludes my presentation. But if you have any questions, feel free to ask. I think I have a couple of minutes to take questions. No.
00:12:45.246 - 00:12:49.740, Speaker A: Right. Thank you. Appreciate it. Thank.
