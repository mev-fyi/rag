00:00:00.650 - 00:00:30.760, Speaker A: Hey guys, nice to see all of you. Excited to be at East Denver. My name is Rachel Mayer. I'm VP of product at Circle. If you don't know who circle is, we put dollars on the Internet. We're the issuer of USDC, the largest, most trusted stablecoin right now in the world. And we're going to talk about all things real world assets today.
00:00:30.760 - 00:01:46.734, Speaker A: Real world assets is kind of a buzwordy term these days. What is a real world asset anyways? The way that I like to think about it is any assets that's not necessarily native to a blockchain network where digital assets like Ethereum or bitcoin are native to networks. There's tons of assets sitting all around you right now, whether it's a T bill, an invoice factoring, a carbon credit, startup carbon credit, anything that is an asset in the real world, we're tokenizing it, putting on the blockchain, putting it on Ethereum, coupled with stablecoins and smart contracts to reap benefits, to reap utility, to reap access and remove middlemen and remove fees. All the core value props that we want to see for the next wave of growth and users all around the world. So with that in mind, I'm super excited to have our esteemed builders and panelists today. I will let each one of you introduce yourselves who you are, what's the name of your project and company, and then we'll get started. So, Bill.
00:01:46.852 - 00:02:25.878, Speaker B: Hey everyone, I'm Phil Fogel. I'm one of the co founders of Flow Carbon. At Flow Carbon, we're looking to build blockchain infrastructure for the voluntary carbon market. The voluntary carbon market, also known as the offset market, is a market that's used by largely corporations and individuals to offset their carbon emissions to reach net zero goals that everyone sort of has in order to fight climate change. This is a market that's been around for 20 years, but has built very little infrastructure to help that market scale. And being that carbon credits are a digitally native asset to begin with, they exist currently today in SQL databases. It's a very easy asset to move on chain, and it should move on chain.
00:02:25.878 - 00:02:59.270, Speaker B: The market today is plagued with a bunch of problems, largely being access, transparency, liquidity, standardization, and price discovery. All of which we can help alleviate immediately by bringing this asset on chain. And once we bring the spot asset on chain, we can actually help. And this is another project that flowcarbon is working on, is to build the capital market stack for investing in carbon projects before they actually produce their carbon credits tranching that risk and building out the trillion plus dollar financing market that's necessary for carbon projects over the course of the next couple of decades.
00:03:00.730 - 00:03:47.058, Speaker C: Hi, everyone, I'm Taylor. I'm early business operations at Goldfinch and currently lead investor insights and relations as well. Goldfinch has a mission of connecting the world's capital to the world's growth. And we started doing this by building an on chain global private credit marketplace. What this means is that we connect capital providers on chain with private debt deals to real world businesses and entities globally. So think about all the crypto volatility kind of all of the crypto markets. The yields that we're providing are stable, uncorrelated to those crypto markets and to real world businesses that are fundamentals driven to scale their businesses reach more users, et cetera and then generate kind of real economic value both kind of in the real world and then also back to the investors on chain.
00:03:47.058 - 00:03:57.030, Speaker C: To date, we've lent about 120,000,000 in USDC loans to more than 14 companies globally to ultimately affect more than 2 million end users.
00:03:58.410 - 00:04:27.886, Speaker D: Hello, everybody, this is Arbil, one of the co founders of Human Finance. We were actually born here at Eat Damber. Last year. We were the d five track winners at the hackathon and very pleased to be back at Eat damber again as sponsors. And we just launched Huma as a public beta at the beginning of this week. Huma is the income backed D five protocol for 99%. Huma is able to utilize income, any type of income on chain or off chain.
00:04:27.886 - 00:05:12.160, Speaker D: This can be on chain invoices, on chain payment streams, on chain staking income yield income, gamefi income but also off chain income of revenues and cash flows and receivables and invoices as well to be tokenized and culturalized on the onchain markets to create a completely new onchain lending market. Since our launch, we have about 30,000 users, probably more right now. I couldn't count since last night. And we have about three lunch partners with Circle request largest crypto invoicing network and superfluid, the streaming payments network but also to any other projects being built right now on huma. Thank you.
00:05:12.470 - 00:05:56.000, Speaker A: Awesome. All right, so one of the things that we talk a lot about at circle is moving away from the speculation phase of crypto into the actual utility phase of crypto and blockchains. And so in order to deliver utility, you have to solve problems. You have to solve problems for users, for developers, for businesses. And it seems quite basic to even say that. But we have this technology, and very often than not, we put the technology first, but not the user problem. So I just want to hear, in your own words, what are the problems that you're solving for who and why does tokenization make it better?
00:05:56.610 - 00:06:28.994, Speaker B: Yeah. So I'm definitely, and have been for a long time, a believer in tokenize all the things. But when you actually start looking for the use cases that are going to propel the market forward, you have to go and find where there's actual problems. So 100% agree that the next wave up is all going to be by building out use cases that actually solve problems that is had by a large number of people. And the carbon markets are a great example of that. This is a market that three years ago was about $200 million and last year was about a $2 billion market. So ten x scaling in three years, with an estimated growth to 100 billion by the end of the decade.
00:06:28.994 - 00:07:00.322, Speaker B: And that market right now has no settlement layer. Right? So you have these assets that are created by a disparate group of NGOs that actually issue the assets. And by the way, these are totally digitally native assets. Right? The asset is a carbon credit is created because a project goes somewhere in the world and does something that prevents the emission of carbon or removes carbon from the atmosphere that is captured via a data stream. Right. They have to prove it via data, which is then applied to a policy framework or methodology, which someone then says, great, you met the criteria. This data backs it up.
00:07:00.322 - 00:07:23.510, Speaker B: Here's a carbon credit. All of that stream of data and that policy can be brought on chain and be stored with the carbon credit. For the lifecycle of the carbon credit, none of that exists today. This market is generously 2% digital, 98% analog. All of the trading takes place OTC between brokers. There is no settlement layer. So the blockchain can be the first true settlement layer for the carbon markets.
00:07:23.510 - 00:07:53.860, Speaker B: And so you're actually going to solve a problem. Price discovery, because there's no settlement layer also doesn't exist. Any pricing tools that people have in the carbon markets are done off of a self reported basis. Someone's saying, oh, yeah, Rachel and I sold her carbon credits and she paid $12 a ton for the carbon credits. I can go and now report that at $14 a ton to then mark up the other credits on my books at $14. So there's no transparency and no real price discovery that takes place. This is something that we've seen in defi time and time again that we can just do and we solve that problem.
00:07:54.230 - 00:07:59.346, Speaker A: So transparency, liquidity and settlement layer, that's more efficient.
00:07:59.458 - 00:08:00.120, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:08:01.530 - 00:08:04.118, Speaker A: Herbal or Taylor, you want to talk about?
00:08:04.204 - 00:08:35.742, Speaker D: Sure. It's very similar. When you look at around the world, access to capital is still very limited. People talk about the capital access gap being in the tens of trillions of dollars, especially for businesses and people who might not necessarily have access to a lot of Ethereum or rap BTC. Defi doesn't offer you anything at all. But the technology, the instant settlement, the transparency, actually enables you to provide instant credit if you have the right. Last mile partners.
00:08:35.742 - 00:09:24.638, Speaker D: So we built a protocol in a way that any of the fintechs in emerging markets who are providing these real loan services and lending services in emerging markets can immediately plug into the Defi ecosystem. Do instant settlement provide transparency to their loan books? Which means that they're connecting a very local need with the global capital markets. And we have some of those fintechs in the audience with GIA providing services to small businesses in Philippines and Kenya. And that doesn't necessarily have a lot of other types of access. And these businesses actually need access to capital right now. The normal processing to go through to get access might take anywhere from weeks to months. And those weeks to months actually make a clinic shut down.
00:09:24.638 - 00:09:45.350, Speaker D: And that might be the only clinic in a village in Kenya. And that's a horrible thing for the whole village. If you have an instant settlement layer, you can have an instant credit access. And that solves a huge problem and creates so much efficiency for both. Obviously, crypto ecosystem, but also solves real world needs for real people and businesses.
00:09:45.690 - 00:10:26.966, Speaker C: Yeah, and we're seeing the same, or we're solving the same problem on the borrowing side. So access to capital is much quicker, it's much more global. And so these borrowers, for the first time ever, are being able to access global capital markets, whereas before, a borrower in Kenya may only have access to the banks in Kenya, or very niche, kind of like one of a kind lenders, that there's kind of a high coupon because there's no competitors to lower the coupon down. I think one other problem that we're solving is on the investor side as well. So for us, private debt, global lending is a $7 trillion market. Private debt is a 1.2 trillion slice of that.
00:10:26.966 - 00:11:06.930, Speaker C: And most of those $1.2 trillion deals are actually only available to the ultra high net worth family offices, global asset managers, other debt funds as well. And so by bringing it on chain, you're allowing access to exclusive deal flow that otherwise wouldn't be available to investors. And so I think, I think a lot. What problem are we actually solving for investors? And I know there's a lot of fintechs who are also kind of democratizing access to some of these more alternative investments, but a lot of times those are kind of, I would say, limited to US investors. And now I think we're expanding that access globally due to blockchain.
00:11:07.990 - 00:11:36.410, Speaker A: Let's talk a little bit about stablecoins, because you all occupy very different asset classes, very different regions. But underlying the theme that I see that all connects to is a ethereum and B stablecoins and USDC. So maybe, in your own words, how do you see the role that usdc and stablecoins play in the access at the settlement layer and helping you reach the next set of users?
00:11:38.510 - 00:12:16.760, Speaker B: I think we're all ultimately building institutional grade markets, right? There are lots of interesting retail use cases in everything that we're doing, but at the end of the day, it's going to be an institutional grade market. And while I think a lot of us here, myself included, would love day if institutional markets were priced in Ethereum, I don't think that's happening anytime soon. And so they're going to continue to be priced in dollars. And in order for them to be priced in dollars and to bring the large institutional players and the large institutional capital into that system, it has to be done via a dollar system that they trust, that is regulated, that they feel incredibly comfortable with, and is incredibly stable and incredibly liquid. And you have the ability to move on and off chain as easily as you want.
00:12:17.530 - 00:13:15.674, Speaker C: Yeah, plus one to that. Even if you think about any of our asset classes, if they were to be on opensea, the default currency there is ethereum, and that is really tough to be able to price in real time. I think, in addition, the benefit of working with a stablecoin is the fact that it's stable. I think on the business side, for a lot of these businesses, it's the first time that they're ever interacting with cryptocurrency, and they all operate in their local jurisdictions with their own regulatory frameworks. And so being able to work with kind of a stablecoin that is transparent, all of the information is on chain, kind of quick access, kind of reputation. From there, I think all the KYC elements that go into that circle is doing with USDC sanctions gives them the confidence that moving money in and out of the traditional financial ecosystem is still going to be regulatory compliant for them. And so that's a huge plus one.
00:13:15.674 - 00:13:20.890, Speaker C: One side of our marketplace would not be coming to us unless we were working with stablecoins.
00:13:21.970 - 00:14:12.154, Speaker D: Just to add to that, three of the co founders at Huma, we all come from the same fintech earn in that was providing cash advance type solutions, earned wage access to tens of millions of Americans who wanted to make ends meet without any credit score checks, non recourse, no collections, 0% interest. Even when you try to build something that's awesome. That helped people access to more than $8 billion in earned wage access. The problems with money movement was like mountainous. It's like every time you wanted to move money, you had to go through this banking infra. You had to exchange FTP files that didn't match. At the end of the weekend, when anytime there's a banking holiday, everything was messed up.
00:14:12.154 - 00:14:45.830, Speaker D: People couldn't access their pay on time. Even with debit rails that has been around for so long, should be working very reliably. Was never working very reliably. And when something goes wrong, you have no traceability of what's going wrong. And as we're building Huma protocol for all different fintechs globally, we could never imagine doing that without the USDC and the circle ecosystem and the circle platform. That literally took away probably two years of technology building from us. And we were able to get the market so quickly.
00:14:45.830 - 00:15:00.650, Speaker D: A year ago we were just hacking. A year later, we have a full market, full protocol, people building. And that's mostly because the programmable money and the infrastructure you guys provide has been amazingly, amazingly helpful.
00:15:01.090 - 00:15:35.240, Speaker A: Sweet. Thank you. But as a smart contract and as a builder, and especially as a product person myself, I know that it's still a new technology. And it's oftentimes challenging to even build on the stack, let alone introducing a new user who has never touched a wallet or has never hold a stablecoin. So what are some of the challenges that you see in building your products and building the solutions? And what might be the solutions for those challenges in order to bring on the next set of customers?
00:15:36.650 - 00:16:11.666, Speaker B: A unified system of fiat on ramps and off ramps into wallets. Right. Right. Now, if you're building an application in this space, as we are, you have to go and integrate directly. And it's not the simplest integration in the world. And you have to integrate in every jurisdiction that has a different fiat on ramp and off ramp. And so having a single connector point, that will ultimately allow us to just basically, with hopefully one line of code, add to an application or a front end that we're building and say, yep, now, wherever you are in the world, it's going to integrate with wherever your fiat on ramp is and also have a single source of KYC across all of that.
00:16:11.666 - 00:16:32.962, Speaker B: So if I've KYC'd using that single connector point, and I'm now using it in a different application, it's already KYC. I don't have to scan my face again. I don't have to do that. And as I move around jurisdictions, there's actually an interesting project called Wallet Connect out of C labs that's working on this. That's a pretty interesting one. One other really quick hot take, which is maybe we should stop using the words real world assets.
00:16:33.106 - 00:16:35.158, Speaker A: Yeah. Off chain assets.
00:16:35.334 - 00:16:48.122, Speaker B: There are assets that have not come on chain yet. So the off chain assets. And then there are assets that are on chain. Ethereum and bitcoin are real world assets. They exist. They have a price, they have a value, they have a utility. And for the rest of this, they're digital assets.
00:16:48.122 - 00:16:53.390, Speaker B: Money. At this point, fiat money is a digital asset. Right. So these are all real world assets.
00:16:54.290 - 00:16:55.258, Speaker A: Let's go.
00:16:55.364 - 00:17:52.606, Speaker C: Yeah, it's like, plus one to that. I think every real world asset event or panel I've been to has mentioned, okay, we need to redefine real world assets, but no one's necessarily need a branding committee. Yeah, I think in terms of pain points or what the challenges are, the way that I think about it sometimes is, for us at least, I think it's a little bit different for you because there's no primitive in place, per se, is that private debt is already a product that people want. And so what we're supposed to be doing with blockchain and crypto is making it into a superior format. And if you're basically trying to evolve that from what currently exists and works relatively well, there's going to be a lot of pain points that come up for investors who are used to kind of the traditional market way. And so I do think fiat on and off ramp is super important. I also know ties into what we're doing is kind of having on chain cash flows.
00:17:52.606 - 00:18:16.714, Speaker C: So one of the biggest questions we get from investors is like, hey, I want to see the borrowers, like loan tapes. I really want to dig into the details. And so I think it's really high level. Like, what's the largest challenge is making sure that all of these projects who are building real world assets are actually interoperable with one another. And I think that's something that maybe we weren't so good about. Two years ago. But as more and more players come into the space, it's something we're getting.
00:18:16.752 - 00:19:01.858, Speaker D: Much better at 100%. I think that's going to be one of the largest on chain markets. Once we actually bring these things in a standardized way in terms of how they're defined as commodities, how they're backed, and what is the process to liquidate them, I think that's going to be a huge, huge enablement. Maybe last thing to add is that we are very excited about the last mile problem solutions. So even though we're working with amazing fintech partners, even they are trying to also provide access directly to their borrowers versus being the middleman in between and with account obstruction wallets. Actually, we're seeing some of these solutions being prototyped right now. So we have some applications being built where the wallet itself is solving some of these last mile problems and kind of creating a credit line behind the scenes.
00:19:01.858 - 00:19:14.670, Speaker D: So you're turning debit card like experiences to credit card experiences, and businesses and people can actually start using them to kind of struck away all of the complexity of the last mile on off chain and exchanges.
00:19:15.170 - 00:19:26.510, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, that was it for our panel. Super short and sweet. Thank you everyone for being here. And please come up to us and let's go all assets on chain.
00:19:28.210 - 00:19:30.220, Speaker D: Thank you. Thank.
