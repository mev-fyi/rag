00:00:00.330 - 00:00:16.798, Speaker A: Here, who leads BD at wisdom ute. And then I have Amos, who is founder of Metaweb VC and Tech. If you guys would like to introduce yourselves and tell me a little bit about what you do, that would be great. David, we can start with you.
00:00:16.964 - 00:00:32.978, Speaker B: Awesome. Thank you so much for having me. How's everyone doing? How's everyone doing? Let's make some noise. Give it up for the choral stage. You guys hanging in this late in the afternoon for a panel while most people are outside drinking or doing something else. Respect. My name is David Mickley.
00:00:32.978 - 00:00:54.240, Speaker B: I do BD at Wintermute. I've been working in crypto for four years, over half that time at Wintermute, based in Boston. Before working in crypto, I was in traditional finance. I was a client advisor at Bridgewater Associates macro hedge fund in Connecticut and excited to be here on my first ETH Denver panel ever. So thank you guys for making this happen.
00:00:56.530 - 00:01:23.478, Speaker C: Hello, everyone. My name is Amos. I'm the founder of Metaweb VC. So Metaweb is early stage vc focusing crypto and we're backed by sequoia, Dragonfly and CNZ of the world at the same time. We also have a sister company called Litech. Litech is both a product studio but also a trading firm. So we do lots of prop trading, but at the same time we're also a market maker for project in the crypto space.
00:01:23.478 - 00:01:30.742, Speaker C: I've been crypto pretty much since 2013. This is my third east Denver. Really excited to be here today.
00:01:30.876 - 00:01:46.640, Speaker A: It's also my first east Denver. It's pretty incredible so far. A lot of people here. David, I'm wondering if you can speak to us a little bit about winter mute being one of the largest market makers in the industry. If there's a particular focus, could you speak to that?
00:01:48.050 - 00:02:01.010, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. Sorry, a lot of noise here. We'll get through it. So first, just want to get a sense of the audience. How many people here are familiar with the concept of market making? All right, good. Awesome.
00:02:01.080 - 00:02:01.602, Speaker A: Great.
00:02:01.736 - 00:02:24.582, Speaker B: How many people here are traders themselves? How many people here are builders, developers? For how many people? Is this your first crypto conference? Awesome. Very cool. Very cool. Also in the background is my brother and sister in law who came from not so far, but some distance to be here. So round of applause. Thank you for showing up. Yeah, round of applause.
00:02:24.582 - 00:02:37.194, Speaker B: Family. It's not all about crypto. Family is important too. So yeah, winter mute. We're one of the world's largest crypto market makers. We've been around for seven years. Basically what we do is really simple, and we just do it at scale.
00:02:37.194 - 00:03:11.638, Speaker B: We are providing liquidity across dozens of venues, centralized exchanges, decentralized exchanges in a market neutral way. So when you look at an order book, an exchange, coinbase, binance, and you look at all those orders, a large percentage of those orders are ours. We're providing liquidity. We're putting those orders up on both sides of the book. And we're basically allowing for there to be a market to buy and sell against for individual traders, for long term investors. And we do a few things with external parties. The first is OTC trading.
00:03:11.638 - 00:04:02.178, Speaker B: So if you're an investor, a fund, institutional broker or aggregator, and you want to move large amounts of crypto, it's more efficient to go directly to a market maker through an OTC desk. To move those blocks, let's say it's $100,000 or $100 million, you'll get better pricing by going directly to a liquidity provider. And we offer that through our OTC desk. The second thing we do is we help projects with liquidity. If you're a project and you're launching a token to get that initial liquidity, to make sure those order books are filled, and that the project has that liquidity, which is one ingredient, but an essential ingredient for its growth, we're there to provide it so we can talk more about what that means and would love to also hear from people that are interested in working with us, either on the OTC desk or the liquidity providing side. You can find me on Twitter at David Micley. Just hit me up on dms if any of those things interest you.
00:04:02.178 - 00:04:04.970, Speaker B: And obviously we'll get into the details as we go through the talk.
00:04:05.120 - 00:04:08.982, Speaker A: Amos, can you speak a little bit about your relationship as a market maker?
00:04:09.126 - 00:05:28.790, Speaker C: Yeah, for sure. So a lot of people are more familiar with Metawap on the VC side, but at the same like our trading firm has also been trading the space for quite a while. I think in the past a couple of months, we're actually usually ranked as some of the top traders on binance in terms of PNL and more related to the market making, you know, obviously shout out to the Windermill, they're being some of the largest market makers in the world. So we have a slightly different approach because we both have the vc side, the venture steel side of things, and also the trading side. So we tend to grow together with the projects, especially for projects that we had invested or incubated, in the sense. So obviously in the market making component, we would obviously do lots of data neutral strategy, but sometimes we also like to trade some of the data to really help the project to grow in terms of the market cap. So we do have a historical record of growing a couple of projects originally from, I don't know, ranking 100 or even 200 ranking on coin market cap, but eventually bring them up to top 50.
00:05:28.790 - 00:05:45.660, Speaker C: Right. So that's kind of like, I guess, our approach in terms of market making. So if you're interested, or if you like being a project, obviously just contact me either on Twitter or just go to our website and left a message there.
00:05:46.110 - 00:05:58.800, Speaker A: I think it'd be interesting to hear more about that. Why is liquidity so important for particularly early stage crypto projects? And as they progress, if you can speak to that from the sort of vc perspective, and also a market making.
00:06:01.940 - 00:06:13.232, Speaker C: I mean, like, first of all, let's start with token. So yesterday I actually did a workshop essentially saying that token is the most powerful marketing tool in crypto.
00:06:13.376 - 00:06:14.676, Speaker A: Say that again. Sorry, what did you say?
00:06:14.698 - 00:07:36.530, Speaker C: Token is the most powerful marketing tool in crypto because all the way since like 2017, the ICO Buran and then the D five summer, then Solana and all the other layer ones that right now layer two modularity. Almost all the hype were driven by press, right? So let's face it, this is like very speculative market and people do want to make money and there's actually nothing wrong about it. For example, in early stage when Solana was trading below a dollar, they don't have that many projects building on it, right? But right now there's so many projects building on Solana, and the same could apply to lots of other ecosystem. That's why I think token is quite important and the market making element part is just to make sure you provide either way for people to buy and sell the token and make sure it's like a liquid asset. Obviously this could be challenging for early stage project simply just because in the beginning, maybe there are not that many interests, not that many knowledge about a token, people are unsure what to buy. At the same time, market making does takes capital and efforts to do it right. But at the same time, I would say, especially since the beginning of last bull run, especially started with DeFi, with AMM and then constraint liquidity am.
00:07:36.530 - 00:08:08.170, Speaker C: Right. Now, obviously the threshold and the requirements of doing market making is much easier compared to before when you have to use the market maker. So I would say that's definitely a good start. But I would say, like, market making is still quite essential. Having professional market maker to do it, it's just to make sure people can actually trade. Get access to your token, which obviously, in the long run will help with the token grows, the project grows, help with the product as well.
00:08:08.780 - 00:08:15.080, Speaker A: Thank you. And David, from your side of things, why is liquidity so important for crypto projects?
00:08:15.240 - 00:08:43.924, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a great question. People talk about liquidity all the time. They talk about being important, but what does liquidity really mean? I just want to sort of define that, looking at a non crypto market. Say you go to the supermarket, the shelves are stocked, right? You want to buy Captain Crunch, you can find Captain Crunch. Who here likes Captain Crunch, right? I love Captain Crunch. And if you want to buy one box of Captain crunch, or five or ten, the price really isn't going to change. And it shouldn't, because there's ample liquidity, there's ample inventory on the shelves at the store.
00:08:43.924 - 00:09:28.144, Speaker B: So for a project that's just launching, when you get listed on an exchange, all the exchange is, is a venue. It's the grocery store, but it's not the inventory of the actual item on the shelves. Who provides that inventory? Who provides that liquidity? It's the market makers. And unlike a grocery store, it's a market where anyone can come and buy and sell things, because there are market makers posting that inventory, posting that liquidity on both sides. Now, if you are crypto that has widespread adoption. If you're a bitcoin or an ethereum, you don't need a market maker because there's enough natural people buying and selling that there's natural liquidity in those order books across those markets, across exchanges. But if you're a new project that's up and coming, you can have everything going for you.
00:09:28.144 - 00:10:08.176, Speaker B: You can have the product market fit, you can have the marketing, you can have the team. But if you don't have a professional market maker that's there to fill those books across both sides, across venues, then traders and investors are going to have a bad experience when they buy $10 versus $1,000 of the asset. They'll see slippage. That's not a good experience. Investors, if they see spreads of two to 5% for low quantities, it leads to a decreased likelihood that they're going to want to buy it, or feeling that they don't have confidence to be able to sell it when they ultimately need to. Obviously, we heard about FTX having these huge holdings on things that didn't have liquidity. So you can have $100 million in something, but if there's no liquidity, there's no market and it doesn't matter.
00:10:08.176 - 00:10:36.936, Speaker B: So market makers play a role and just provide liquidity. But it's really important to also know what market makers don't do. They don't help move the price up, they don't help push the price down. They literally are there in a market neutral way, providing liquidity. And so when wintermute thinks about partnering with projects, we try to identify projects that have all those other things going for them. They have the marketing, they have the team, they have the product market fit, they have the conviction. And we use our team of developers, engineers, that have been working on market making.
00:10:36.936 - 00:10:50.350, Speaker B: A very simple idea, but very complex in execution, trading billions of dollars a day. We apply that technology to providing liquidity to your token as part of our role in helping support that project.
00:10:51.600 - 00:11:27.130, Speaker A: Great, thank you. I'm curious about the way market making differs for centralized exchanges versus decentralized exchanges. So I know at winter mute, you provide liquidity for both. Right. How does that look? Because I think over the last sort of year or so, we've seen decentralized exchange trading volume sort of not look as good as it did in previous years. I think there was, at one point we saw, I think, Uniswap and a few other decentralized exchanges trading volumes surpassed coinbase, which is pretty cool. I'm wondering how that looks from a market maker's perspective and if there are stark differences or not.
00:11:27.740 - 00:11:33.176, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. Sorry. That. Yeah, I mean, definitely trade in general is picking up.
00:11:33.198 - 00:11:33.380, Speaker C: Right now.
00:11:33.390 - 00:11:59.940, Speaker B: We're entering a bull market, but DFI's market share has been decreasing a little bit. The peak for DFI's market share was around May of 2023, where 15% of trading happened on chain. And now it's around half that, around seven and a half percent. So it's still meaningful. But as far as market share goes, definitely the majority of trading happens on chain. As market makers, both on CFI and DFI, we're very active on chain. There's all sorts of sorts of different venues that you can trade on.
00:11:59.940 - 00:12:35.004, Speaker B: There's amms, which introduce certain risks around a permanent loss. There's clobs, which sort of eliminate that, but have other sort of issues around optimizing for gas, optimizing for transaction fees. There's just a lot more things you have to consider when trading on chain. But for us, it's really important that when someone's buying or selling a token, we want them to feel like they got a fair price no matter where they traded it. So we want to make the market efficient across both types of venues, CFI and Defi. And our ability to be active on DeFi and active on CFI allows us to keep the price in line through arbitrage. That's what market makers are essentially doing.
00:12:35.004 - 00:13:06.730, Speaker B: They're capturing the bid ask spread on a given exchange and arbitraging the price difference between exchanges. And for us, we're not just arbitraging between different centralized exchanges, but we're arbitraging between CFI and Defi to put the price in line. So that if you buy something on uniswap or if you buy something on Coinbase, hopefully you'll still see relatively the same price. But obviously there's challenges, there's more work, there's more integration work you need to think about when doing market making or trading on chain. And that's why we have a big team of defi developers focused on that, because we're very committed to furthering the decentralized world in general.
00:13:07.100 - 00:13:09.416, Speaker A: Amos, I'm wondering if you can speak to that too.
00:13:09.518 - 00:14:21.952, Speaker C: Yeah, I think trading on a Dex is actually very different from trading on a centralized exchanges, especially if you're trading on Amm, because especially I'm talking about Uniswap way to sell amm. It's both like the smartest and the most stupidest design in the world, right? So it does introduce slippage. And obviously, right now, I would say the general user experience of trading on chain is still not necessarily comparable to the experience of trading off chain on a central exchange. Right? Sometimes there are latency, and by the way, right now there are lots of other book, like decentralized other book exchanges, but it's not exactly fully on chain yet. I guess one of the big benefit of trading on a centralized exchange, especially from the project perspective, because at the same time, I'm a VC, right? Is that like David said, central exchanges, they're just like venue, they're like grocery store, and they can actually bring you lots of users versus on dexes. In general speaking, it's more like the project actually bringing users to the DeX versus Dex is actually bringing user to the project. Right.
00:14:21.952 - 00:15:06.332, Speaker C: There are definitely much, I would say, stronger benefits for project to get listed on central exchange compared to DeX. But in terms of the actual trading mechanism, I say there wouldn't be that much of a difference. But just in general, if you try to trade on Amm, it's not like a very efficient way of doing it. In most cases, obviously, you still have to pay gas fee and deal with all the MEv stuff which sometimes tends to really complicate things. Right. But at least in this bull run, I'm actually quite bullish in terms of having more decentralized exchanges, especially all the broke exchanges showing up. We actually invest in two projects working on this.
00:15:06.332 - 00:15:28.250, Speaker C: One is called Alderina work, which is actually a pretty large project. I think they're doing like billions of dollars of volume right now. It's actually built by the Wu team. We also invest in another project called Warp, which is a fully on chain book built by Joseph Pong, who actually wrote the lightning network white paper together with Vitalik back then. So super excited about that.
00:15:29.260 - 00:15:46.876, Speaker A: I'm wondering how early stage projects compete in terms of liquidity. So David, I think you explained this at the beginning. Like, if an asset has high trading volumes, it's obviously advantageous. So how do the earlier stage projects compete with that?
00:15:47.058 - 00:16:06.316, Speaker B: Yeah, great question. So for early stage projects, that is kind of the inherent problem. It's getting liquidity, getting people to actually have the market that they can trade against. And that presents a few problems. Right. When you're trying to get listed on an exchange, you have to think about their incentives. All the exchange cares about is trading volume because that leads to trading fees.
00:16:06.316 - 00:16:58.608, Speaker B: So how do they know people are going to trade this new token that is being listed? Well, when a market maker is working with a project, that again goes back to the metaphor, that's filling out the inventory, that's putting the cereal on the shelves so that people can buy and sell it, and that allows the exchanges to make money through trading fees, that allows the market to be created so that there's people that can actually buy and sell the thing. So that's why, again, it goes back to, why are market makers important? It's for providing that liquidity before something actually has an organic market of people that are willing to post orders across both sides of the book. Again, you sort of look at the orders of magnitude of trading volume. BTC yesterday doing around 70 billion, east doing around 30 billion. There's only a handful of projects that trade north of a billion. And then it drops into a few in the hundreds of millions, and then way less than the tens of millions, and then way more in the tens of millions, then way more, way below that. So if you want to get trading volume, you need liquidity.
00:16:58.608 - 00:17:09.704, Speaker B: Both those things go together. Liquidity brings volume, volumes brings liquidity. But to bootstrap it from an initial stage, especially when you're launching a new project, that's when the market maker can really play a role and does the.
00:17:09.742 - 00:17:15.780, Speaker A: Market maker take on any risk by providing liquidity for like super small lower cap projects?
00:17:15.940 - 00:17:18.170, Speaker B: Yeah. Do you want to answer that first?
00:17:19.020 - 00:18:00.372, Speaker C: Of course. I'll say there are definitely more risk in a bear market because to provide really good liquidity, the market maker need to both buy and sell the tokens. Right. So if the token just keep going down, obviously to still try to remain the liquidity, the market maker just going to keep buying, buying the token. There are definitely inherent risks and in terms of hedging the rigs, because a lot of smaller project actually don't have futures or perps, it's also really difficult to actually hedge it. So it does definitely walk the challenges of doing market making for smaller cap projects. But I guess to answer your early question, I would say just provide slightly different perspective.
00:18:00.372 - 00:18:51.530, Speaker C: First, I agree with what David said, but the other part is that once you figure out all the market making stuff, make sure people can trade it somewhat easily, have somewhat smooth experience of trading our token. It's also very important for projects to actually compete for attention, which doesn't necessarily means market making, but it's more like a marketing. In that sense, the project is like market making, just like one of the instruments. That part is more about getting more people to know what you're doing, getting them excited. Obviously the product itself to have good value proposition, actually have good utility and capture value. All those are important for a project to actually compete for the traders, for the retail users, for the funds like attention, to actually buy into the tokens and the market making is just facilitating the transaction in between.
00:18:52.060 - 00:19:07.596, Speaker B: Yeah, and just to build off that really good point about the hedging risks. It's hard to hedge something when it's not an actively traded token, but there's also the opportunity cost of trading a. Is that better? Now can you guys hear? Now you can hear. Okay, great, thanks. Oh, you were scratching. All right, scratch. You edged it.
00:19:07.596 - 00:19:27.468, Speaker B: It's good. All right, good. Great. Awesome. Where was I? So, yeah, basically there's also the opportunity cost. Right. So the way we structure our deals is we get a loan from the project in the token that we'll be market making, but we have to put up the other side of whatever that token is trained against, whether that's BTC, ETh or stables.
00:19:27.468 - 00:20:04.380, Speaker B: There's a capital cost there to put up that other side of the trade. There's an opportunity cost of what we could be doing with that capital. And right now, the cost of capital, the opportunity costs are very high because it's high cost to borrow. There's a lot of trade opportunities. So the worst thing for a market maker, well, not the worst, but one of the bad things is if we are posting liquidity but no one's trained against it, that just kind of destroys the business model. So what you were asking before is the risk of working with an early stage project. We want to make sure that if that project is launched and if there is good liquidity, that there is a market out there that wants to buy and sell it, because otherwise we're just posting our inventory and it's not being used.
00:20:04.380 - 00:20:15.468, Speaker B: And that's an opportunity cost. And that's why we assess projects as part of our diligence process, to basically see like, are we working with projects that there is an active user base of people that want to trade it, buy and sell it and so forth.
00:20:15.564 - 00:20:17.260, Speaker A: How do you gauge that demand?
00:20:17.420 - 00:20:41.588, Speaker B: It's really tricky. It's really tricky. I mean, it's almost like a VC type of diligence. We're looking at community, we're looking at product. If it's already traded on a Dex, then we can get that sort of information before it lists on a centralized exchange and see how much volume is already there. Look at the backing. It is somewhat of an art, as investing is, but I would say it's a real decision of investing our resources and capital in market making.
00:20:41.588 - 00:20:43.980, Speaker B: And you don't always know until it launches.
00:20:44.560 - 00:21:00.530, Speaker C: And then just one more thing on the opportunity cost right now, the funding rate on finance for perps, even for BTC, the implied APY is actually more than 100%. So that's like real opportunity calls to market makers in that sense.
00:21:01.060 - 00:21:23.210, Speaker A: I want to ask you guys one last question. So at what point do you think we're going to see like a consistent sort of. Within crypto, there's a lot of spikes of trading volume, like high active periods. At what point will the market sort of become consistent from a market make perspective, from a trading volume perspective, liquidity. When are we going to see that?
00:21:25.980 - 00:21:53.250, Speaker C: I actually don't care if it's consistent. I guess more like consistently growing the market share and get more and more volume. Right. But just as in traditional finance, there will always be spikes in volume for whatever reasons. And that's actually great in terms of the volatility to the traders. But overall, I'm just hoping this market, especially with the recent ETF approval, just bringing more people into the space, more money, which obviously is great.
00:21:53.860 - 00:22:28.308, Speaker B: Yeah, great points. Just to add to that, obviously we're still early in widespread crypto adoption. So much of crypto price action is based on sentiment, based on news, and that can shift very quickly. So the more that we can have broader adoption, broader use cases that create stability to pricing, that creates stability to the markets, a wider sort of base of users, buyers and sellers, then we'll see volatility come down. So it's really this way with any emerging asset class. Crypto is one example of it. And I think as we see more adoption, then we'll see more stability.
00:22:28.308 - 00:22:32.770, Speaker B: And obviously we're seeing that over the past ten years, which just have a long more way to go.
00:22:33.380 - 00:22:35.952, Speaker A: Thanks so much, guys. That's all we have time for. I appreciate it.
00:22:36.006 - 00:22:42.784, Speaker B: Awesome. Thank you. I'll say one more time if you want to follow up Twitter at David Mickley, hit me up and thank you all for having me. Great being on the panel with you.
00:22:42.822 - 00:22:43.230, Speaker A: Thanks both.
