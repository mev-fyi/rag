00:00:00.250 - 00:00:20.286, Speaker A: Okay, moving right on to Daniel from steakfish. We're talking about Ethereum 20 beacon chain decentralization and transparency. So do I got Daniel here? There he is. Oh, good to see you. Are you ready to, you ready to go?
00:00:20.388 - 00:00:21.130, Speaker B: Yep.
00:00:21.290 - 00:00:25.360, Speaker A: Okay. Floor is yours. All.
00:00:26.330 - 00:00:58.430, Speaker C: All right. So, hi, I'm Daniel. I'm a protocol specialist at Stakefish. So I'll be talking about decentralization, transparency on the e two beacon chain. Yeah. So I guess relative to other networks, it would be nice to have some transparency and insight into the state of what our decentralization is on Ethereum two beacon chain. So stakefish is a proof of stake validator and we've been supporting Ethereum two deposits.
00:00:58.430 - 00:02:45.790, Speaker C: I'll be talking about a few things. So first, talking about how we can get from raw data to revealed data, going over some terminology, talking a little bit about transparency and understanding what that actually means, some concepts of, I guess, security through obscurity and if that is actually something that's necessary for the robustness and security of our networks, the tragedy of the open source commons and the bystander effect, and what that has to do with our decentralization, transparency and whose responsibility ultimately it comes down to. And then I'll end with some sort of actionable insights. So, yeah, I mean, we're very familiar with the moniker don't trust verify, but I think what actually happens is we oftentimes have to trust in either infrastructure providers, applications, or even just popular figures that kind of say, hey, this is the way that things are, this is the state, and then we are no wiser if we don't have the technical acumen to verify it for ourselves. So I think an important part is anyone can definitely run a node, but do many people actually run those nodes? I would say very few of the people who are interacting with Ethereum today do. And so I think that type of transparency in these public networks should be publicly available and accessible to anyone. And that means that there should be ways of being able to verify easily.
00:02:45.790 - 00:03:58.706, Speaker C: I say here, like vanity metrics aside, beyond that of leaderboards for how much stake that you do control over the system, objective transparency into that is important for robust security and also to kind of maintain the open source principles of our network. So I'll go over some terminology, because I think there definitely is a bit of ambiguation between other proof of stake networks and that of Ethereum too, specifically with regards to what a validator is and what a validator is not, and then what service providers are and independent setups. So this comes down to naming conventions, I think, with other proof of stake networks, if you're not familiar, there are validators who are basically like the miners of proof of stake, so to speak, and they accept delegations on your behalf. And then you kind of get like a little award from that, from helping participate in the security of the system. And those delegation amounts on those different networks are uncapped.
00:03:58.738 - 00:03:58.934, Speaker B: Right.
00:03:58.972 - 00:04:59.610, Speaker C: You can basically send as many tokens on those networks to a validator service provider. But on Ethereum, you technically are able to send like an infinite amount of tokens. But the way that validators are described is basically broken down into effectively 32 eth increments where a validator is determined by 32 e. Right. And so it's somewhat capped. Also, there is kind of this concept of what is what and who is who. Who are custodians, noncustodial providers, custodial providers, centralized exchanges, independent setups, and then also certain, I guess, like white label agreements that happen between service providers and other service providers and service providers and even non custodial exchanges.
00:04:59.610 - 00:05:57.406, Speaker C: And this is just like an example from, I think this guy's Alex was from the Tezos ecosystem that does have, as I mentioned, the uncapped delegation amounts for which is attributed to a particular validator, and in this case, validator service providers. And he's basically saying here, right, Ethereum is showing there's like, at this point in time in December 2, like 21,000 independent validators. But it's not actually 21,000 independent validators. It's 21,032 e denominated validators that may represent 21,000 people or just a few of those. And you kind of get into these umbrellas that you kind of portion them off into, where how many of those 21,000 are actually independent setups. How many of those are kind of denominated into validator service providers like us steakfish. How many does steakfish actually control?
00:05:57.508 - 00:05:57.870, Speaker B: Right?
00:05:57.940 - 00:06:28.434, Speaker C: Like the validation keys, the signing keys. Obviously, we are in a non custodial and we don't hold your withdrawal keys. And then how many of those are custodial exchanges or just custodians like bitcoin Suisse, for example? So I think that terminology disambiguation is important to kind of understand, right? Just like the pure raw numbers we see is not necessarily what is actually presented.
00:06:28.482 - 00:06:28.838, Speaker B: Right?
00:06:28.924 - 00:07:06.886, Speaker C: And so, for example, I just broke it down here, right? This is one way to kind of look at it right now. We have individuals at independent setups. We have non custodial service providers like stakefish, we have decentralized pools like lido and rocket pool. And we have custodial exchanges, like centralized exchanges, and then custodians like bitcoin Suisse. And so within these buckets, I think we can kind of come to a start of what decentralization actually looks like. Sorry about that. And if we can bucket these instead of the 21,000 amount, I think right now we actually have 70,000.
00:07:06.886 - 00:07:30.390, Speaker C: But how much of those are kind of bracketed into existing service provider umbrellas? How many of those are individuals? And obviously from that, we can kind of see kind of unique amounts of where the decentralization actually is and what state we're at. And that kind of leads into the concept of transparency.
00:07:30.470 - 00:07:30.762, Speaker B: Right.
00:07:30.816 - 00:08:22.218, Speaker C: Obviously, the scalability trilemma is decentralization, security, and scalability. These are all important concepts. They're inherent to it. And then I think perhaps with the way that some people are familiar in terms of exposing their validators, let's say independent versus large service providers, it's sometimes misunderstood as kind of antisecurity. And I'll talk about that concept in a bit. But I would say that basically, to sum it up, transparency and favor over privacy is basically paramount to identifying the state of decentralization. The transparency that we can see at least gives us a clear picture of state of the state.
00:08:22.218 - 00:09:04.294, Speaker C: And then from an understanding of a clear picture of the state, then we can kind of act on that and see what we can do from that. Right? And this is basically an issue of how many independents we have versus how many kind of pooled providers do we have. So this leads into the tragedy, I say, of the open source commons. Right? And the bystander effect. So we can talk about, as I mentioned, security thrive, security, where there are these security engineering principles that kind of have talked a little bit about this.
00:09:04.332 - 00:09:04.582, Speaker B: Right?
00:09:04.636 - 00:10:00.358, Speaker C: Like cloud Shannon, the information theorist, kind of says you should have a default state of like, the enemy knows a system. I think another popular one is like Kirkhoff's principle, where it says, like, a crypto system should be secure, even if everything about the system except for the key is public knowledge. And then Ross Anderson says the security of a system should depend on its key, not on its design remaining obscure. I would say that these are pretty good arguments against having privacy at all costs to obscure your setups or even expose how much of the system that you own just for that type of privacy. Because I would say that maybe it makes sense for independence, but for large service providers, that's something that we as infrastructure providers should have been doing from the beginning and as a default.
00:10:00.454 - 00:10:01.100, Speaker B: Right.
00:10:02.530 - 00:10:25.346, Speaker C: It's also having an understanding of these open source systems that we should be under the assumption that the enemy always will gain full familiarity with them. I think a good example that we've seen even in the witty testnet, one of the consensus is Johnny Ria, like, basically was able to almost trivially be able to dox certain people.
00:10:25.448 - 00:10:26.100, Speaker B: Right.
00:10:27.510 - 00:10:28.854, Speaker C: And he was able to show that.
00:10:28.892 - 00:10:29.480, Speaker B: Right.
00:10:31.370 - 00:11:07.026, Speaker C: And so I would say that this privacy that you obtain from security, ethereum security, is at the expense of decentralization transparency and at the expense of decentralization transparency. You get issues with actually understanding the complete state of the system. And if you don't understand the complete state of the system, then you can't understand what you may be able to do. Maybe you may have an abstract or vague concept of, oh, a certain validator service provider has an enormous amount of control or influence over the current beacon chain network, and then we should do something about it.
00:11:07.048 - 00:11:07.570, Speaker B: Right.
00:11:07.720 - 00:11:16.450, Speaker C: But we can't just operate under this kind of fog of assuming things are going as well as where they're going.
00:11:16.600 - 00:11:17.300, Speaker B: Right.
00:11:18.570 - 00:12:02.258, Speaker C: That's the kind of concept of robustness. Yeah, sorry, I must have redone that slide. So the concept is, at the end of the day, who is responsible for these things, right. We're in an open source environment. We're in public networks and public systems. But Peter Gutman had given a talk at Kiwicon in 2007 where he was talking about this design mentality of bugs in the brain, right. And how these bugs, and maybe applied to our decentralized networks, is sort of like centralization is the bug, right.
00:12:02.258 - 00:12:28.634, Speaker C: Everyone also assumes that someone else is looking at it. Right. And in the end, the burden of making sure that these things are operating as they should, that decentralization is being achieved as they should. It falls on no one and it also falls on everyone at the same time. And so because everyone is making these assumptions, we don't have clarity into the state, then no one's doing it.
00:12:28.672 - 00:12:29.260, Speaker B: Right.
00:12:30.510 - 00:13:28.720, Speaker C: I'm not trying to harp on anyone here, but I think there are specific things that we should be aware of, and then we should be kind of pushing to make sure we have transparency into. And so I think Philip Monk, he's a developer, I think with the urbit project, has like a fantastic quote that I love. It says where sovereignty necessitates understanding. If you don't understand the system you're using, you don't control it. And if nobody understands the system, the system is in control. And in this case, what does that mean? If you don't understand the state of decentralization, transparency, or if you don't understand the state of decentralization and you don't have transparency into it, and you're making assumptions, then the people who are actually benefiting from it, or, let's say, at risk or in power of being able to benefit from it, are perhaps large service providers like stakefish itself. Right.
00:13:28.720 - 00:14:17.738, Speaker C: The community and the ecosystem should be aware and maybe should be more cognizant and demanding of their large service providers to kind of identify themselves or at least have some pressure there. Positive pressure, I would say. Right. And then again, you have the don't trust verify moniker. But the thing is that I think we realize is, what if we can't verify it? Most people can't verify it. And this type of decentralization currency must be easy to verify and understandable. I know I have, like, one more minute left, but I think I will definitely say there are initiatives that are in place that need to have these dashboards that are open source, independently hosted, especially not by validators or validator service providers like steakfish.
00:14:17.834 - 00:14:18.574, Speaker B: Right.
00:14:18.772 - 00:14:42.520, Speaker C: So there's no conflict of interest. They need to be credibly neutral and be treated as public goods. And, for example, these are some initiatives that are going on. Right. Beacon chain is developing some dashboards to support this. Nanson is as well. There's community initiatives that Elias from bison trails is doing, and then superfiz from the ETH two due diligence committee is also spearheading a lot of this coordination as well.
00:14:42.520 - 00:15:00.300, Speaker C: So please go contact them and then that would be some great ways to kind of get started and contribute. But, yeah, I mean, there's public and private interest in here. I think we're all in the same boat towards kind of developing ethereum two and getting to that point. Yeah. If you have any questions, please reach out. Thank you.
