00:00:00.480 - 00:00:49.940, Speaker A: Hello eft denver 2023. My name is lip evm, currently an engineer and developer advocate at Mantle, and I'll be going through the list of bounties we have today with you. So what is Mantle? Well, Mantle is a modular optimistic L2. Our key differentiators being that we have a modular design, specialized data availability as well as multi party computation, otherwise known as mpc. So blockchain nodes today actually perform many different tasks. They maintain a historical database of transactions, they update the state of database in response to said transactions that participate in consensus, and they make available said transactions to anyone who queries them. This is also known as the execution settlement, consensus and data availability.
00:00:49.940 - 00:01:37.126, Speaker A: Rather than having nodes be responsible for several tasks at once, Mantle operates whereby every function is performed by an independent network of nodes. This way each network can specialize in its task, leading to efficiency gains and lower fees. A key challenge to operating an optimistic rollup is maintaining data availability. Rather than posting transaction data to Ethereum, Mantle uses Eigenda, a specialized data availability solution built on top of Eigenlade. Another trade off for optimistic rollups is the necessity for long wait times for transaction finality. Traditionally this is seven days. So Mantle introduces a new kind of node role, otherwise known as MPC node, that affirms the validity of blocks produced by the sequencer.
00:01:37.126 - 00:02:19.020, Speaker A: The more MPC node signs off on a block, the greater the collective confidence in block validity. So we can reduce this challenge time down to as low as one to two days. In regards to the prizes which are all paid in USDC, we have a category for best style tooling where three teams will win $2,000 each. We have a category for Best Developer tooling and or Infrastructure where three teams will win $2,000 each. We have a category for Best Defi or NFT project where three teams will win $2,000 each. We also have a fun category with five team all individuals win $200 each each. Please come to the Mantle booth and or ask around the Mantle discord for more information.
00:02:19.020 - 00:02:38.520, Speaker A: We also have a Twitter Thread all section. So if you're a Twitter thread or who likes to write long form Twitter threads, you can stand a chance to win $1,000 in USDC if you write about a Mantle specific technology such as eigenva Account Extractional mpc. Finally, good luck and have fun.
