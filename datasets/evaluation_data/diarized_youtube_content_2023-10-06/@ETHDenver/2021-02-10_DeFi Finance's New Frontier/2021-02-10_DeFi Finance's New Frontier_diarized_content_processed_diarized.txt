00:00:00.330 - 00:00:51.194, Speaker A: So, hi, everybody. I'm Mariano Conti. I'm going to be taking over McDuries from Kent Barton, who I thank very much for everything he did today. And, yeah, I have my mate here, and I want to thank Denver for hosting another great conference. Sad that we can't all be there in person, but as always, it is great to be with everybody and talk about the things we enjoy the most. So, without further ado, the next presentation is called Defi finance New Frontier. And let's see, we've got some great speakers.
00:00:51.194 - 00:01:06.900, Speaker A: Anatoly Giacovenko from Solana, Sam Bachmanfried from FTX, Andrew Cronje from yearn, and Kristen Stone from Balancer. So I see Anatoli is here. Welcome.
00:01:09.190 - 00:01:11.540, Speaker B: Hey, awesome to be here.
00:01:12.630 - 00:01:18.600, Speaker A: Great. And I see Kristen. Hi, Kristen. Thank you for being here.
00:01:19.130 - 00:01:21.362, Speaker B: I believe Andre is in by voice.
00:01:21.426 - 00:01:23.240, Speaker C: Only, but I'm not 100%.
00:01:27.290 - 00:01:29.130, Speaker B: He's a ghost in the machine.
00:01:33.390 - 00:01:35.020, Speaker A: Andre, are you around?
00:01:35.390 - 00:01:37.420, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm around. Can you hear me?
00:01:38.030 - 00:01:39.340, Speaker A: Yes, we can.
00:01:41.630 - 00:02:04.980, Speaker C: When you were having technical problems, I actually read a joke the other day that was like, early 1900 seances, when people gather together to try and summon ghosts. It's very the same as how these conferences start, because it's always with, like, hello, can you hear me? Are you out there? Can you feel me? All of that kind of stuff. So, it's a very interesting fact that 100 years later, and we're still starting stuff the same way.
00:02:07.770 - 00:02:36.910, Speaker A: Yeah, that's what the last year has given us. And we still need SBF. Okay. So I guess that means to have Sam on stage. I need to stop my video and let the four of you hash it out and talk about Defi finance's new frontier.
00:02:48.590 - 00:02:49.980, Speaker C: With us. There we go.
00:02:51.150 - 00:02:52.330, Speaker B: Hey, Sam.
00:02:52.830 - 00:02:54.540, Speaker D: Hey. How's it going, guys?
00:02:56.350 - 00:02:57.100, Speaker C: Cool.
00:02:59.630 - 00:03:33.160, Speaker D: So, yeah, I mean, I don't know. Totally. And I've spent a ton of time talking about plans. My biggest question for you, I think, is maybe thinking about Solana, and particularly about future scaling, what the biggest things are that could sort of further increase capacity and where those. Yeah, maybe we'll start to have questions for Andre as well.
00:03:33.610 - 00:04:02.510, Speaker B: Yeah. So, for us, this is like a fun engineering problem. So we have our runtime, which is Berkeley package filter. We can take that BPF code. It's a bytecode. It's a virtual machine that looks very much like X 86. It's actually a subset of X 86, and we can convert it to native machine code on the fly, inside the client, inside the chain.
00:04:02.510 - 00:04:48.302, Speaker B: So commercializing that and getting that out. That's maybe like, we're at the tail end of that. There's maybe like one month of that left, but the next step after that, and I don't know if we can accomplish this by the end of the year, is to take that bytecode and then run it on gpus, which would give us 20 x more compute. And if we're doing that, it means that we've optimized the hell out of everything else. And now that's important enough to do. And that's basically it means that, I think the amount of bandwidth that we can consume is now, like, we're measuring it above one gigabit. It's like one to 20 gigabits worth of incoming packets that are being swarmed into this thing.
00:04:48.302 - 00:05:14.440, Speaker B: And maybe it's a racket gpus, it doesn't matter. But at that stage, this is kind of a financial switch. You can almost call it like. It's almost like as if Cisco built it. And here's like a really boring thing. You cart it into your bank, and you plug in a bunch of stuff into it, and it makes markets happen. That's like the engineering path there.
00:05:14.440 - 00:05:39.200, Speaker B: Obviously, the hard part is always, does anybody care? Even if this is super fast and cheap, is anyone going to use it? How do you find those products where this stuff actually makes a difference and can go get product market fit? That's always the hard problem in any of this stuff. I think the tech is just enough smart people out there that can figure it out.
00:05:42.290 - 00:05:43.040, Speaker C: Cool.
00:05:43.650 - 00:06:49.400, Speaker D: I'm certainly super excited for that. I think right now slan, it's certainly fast enough to run, like, one big app, but I think getting another factor of 20 or so will have. It'll be able to run more of an industrial scale ecosystem, as opposed to sort of like mini scale ecosystem or industrial scale app, and get it to the million marker, which I think is like ballpark, where things need to get to be for that not to be sort of the proximate, or at least the looming limiting factor. Yeah. Andre, what's your thought on the future of, like, future spelled out? Three months is maybe sort of, like, straightforward in some sense? I don't know if it is, but I could certainly predict maybe what approximate improvements would be or additions. But how about three to five years out? What would really excite you about it? What would be, like a real win state?
00:06:51.290 - 00:07:46.600, Speaker C: Well, it's definitely a different value proposition depending on which specific product vertical you're talking about. So starting the conversation sort of just on urine itself, an analogy I like to use is consider a river and consider flowing water. Now consider there's a bunch of different rocks in this river. And how the water flows changes its pathway based on what rock it hits and how it moves. So you've got this water that's constantly streaming past and it's streaming sort of water has a way to find its most optimum route based on the obstacles you put in its path. I would like yearn to be that for capital. So the capital can just stream in from one situation, and it's going to find the most optimum path for that capital based on the obstacles that are presented in its way.
00:07:46.600 - 00:08:37.990, Speaker C: I never envisioned it to be a client facing solution. It's really meant to be a protocol level solution in that, you know, its job is consolidate all the capital and then deploy that where it creates the most necessary value. Now, the reason I like that description specifically is because it's agnostic to the protocols it feeds. It's agnostic to the chain it feeds. It's agnostic to absolutely everything. It is just the storage warehouse of capital where it then flows to. So I'd say that's probably like, if we're starting to talk two to three years from now, I hope, talking about situations that aren't just financial instruments.
00:08:37.990 - 00:09:21.350, Speaker C: And I think we're sort of starting to see that it's bridging out slowly. For example, what you guys are doing with maps, me as well. There's more things you can do. And when I say capital, that's also got a financial value towards it, I should probably say as digital assets, which is more accurate description, because that isn't necessarily something you deploy for financial reasons. So that sort of deployment situation is definitely what I would like to see in the future. And I'd like it to be agnostic of where it goes or even what it is pooling its job is just to find the root of least resistance.
00:09:27.360 - 00:10:02.840, Speaker D: Yeah, that totally makes sense. And so thinking of it as sort of like a switching board almost in the middle, and then I guess there's a ton of flexibility and see where it goes in terms of what happens at the other end and adapt to support that. How much do you see it, like, long term, being on chain, automated investment strategy type things, versus having sort of manually designed investment strategies with sort of manual iteration?
00:10:04.860 - 00:11:00.890, Speaker C: I think you kind of have sort of both. I mean, if you look at something like set protocol, right, they're already walking that way where it's very manual designed strategies. I mean, for now, you play within the rules that the set protocol has integrated with and allows you to play in. But those are traders or money managers or just enthusiasts that set up their own manual rules and strategies and stuff. And I think the beauty there is that there's a lot of strength because there's only so much data you can use from on chain information that it lacks a certain nuance, it lacks a certain social inflector. It can't respond on potential external rumors or any of that stuff. That's where that more traditional manual management comes in.
00:11:00.890 - 00:11:54.124, Speaker C: Now, especially again, while we're talking about yield markets and financial markets, and especially when you talk about speculation, there's a very large part of that is sort of social contract base. And it's not on chain information. It's what people perceive is going to happen with something that most often becomes the reality thereof. So I definitely think it will move to more manual strategies, but on chain codified, because I think that on chain codified part is what gives people comfort. It's really scary transferring money into someone else's bank account because you have no idea if you get to see that again. But it's almost less scary to do that into a smart contract if you've read that and understood it, than their social consensus on what that smart contract does. Because you know the exact rules under which you can gain it back or anything that might happen with it.
00:11:54.124 - 00:12:27.464, Speaker C: I think the real power is a combination of both. It's the same what we're seeing nowadays. It's not just like if there was a magic formula you could apply to the financial markets to make the most upside, it would have been invented, but it just doesn't exist. There's always that human component that has to play part of it. I think the on chain possibility is limited in terms of what it can maximize. And then after that, you need to start adding that human component. But I don't think it's either or.
00:12:27.464 - 00:12:42.700, Speaker C: I think the two live very mutualistically together to create something that gives more comfort, that gives more transparency, and at the same time allows that external stimuli to still have input into sort of perfecting these strategies.
00:12:45.440 - 00:13:26.120, Speaker D: It makes a ton of sense, sort of matches a lot of what I sort of felt like trading in intrinsic finance, that there's a lot you can get from sort of combining together automated systems with the things that those automated systems definitely aren't going to get right? Yeah. What's your guys sense of what are the biggest medium to long term risks for Defi? Like if you had to tell a story where it didn't ever get big. What story would you tell and what would be, like, contributing factors or ways to avoid it?
00:13:28.010 - 00:14:06.242, Speaker E: It's a good way to frame the question, Sam. It goes off of Andre's point, which I think is really interesting. How much can be, like, on. You have this limited amount of information. It could be on chain, and then all of these other human things have to happen off chain. And something that I think could be a terrible story of really defi gone wrong is the human element and the human component. So, like, not enough care and attention focused on humans that there's this distrust that all of the incentives are just short term and there's no motivation, there's no connection to the human.
00:14:06.242 - 00:14:29.580, Speaker E: And so people end up going other places that have a lot more personality inside of them. And while I don't think that's true right now, because crypto has a ton of personality in it, I do think there is a world where that personality doesn't actually connect to every individual in squad senses or in a sense, where people feel empowered. And that's probably the story I would tell or the one that I think about most.
00:14:31.470 - 00:15:18.460, Speaker C: I just want to jump in there because I want to affirm how important what Christian just said was. Because when Sam phrased that question for me, I immediately went to 100% technical components. I was like, well, EVM failure, maybe consensus failure, maybe some of the big miners that get blocked out geofencing these kinds of things. As someone that lives inside of smart contracts, I did not consider the human element for 1 second. So I think what Christian just said is probably more important than any technical fault that I could point out, because if it's just people like me building, the humans are very soon going to start moving away. That's an excellent point that I wouldn't even have considered. So thank you for pointing that out.
00:15:22.210 - 00:15:54.950, Speaker B: There's a surprising amount of good actors in this space, considering this whole space is based on trustlessness, I think it almost by definition, attracts people that are generally good. And there's a bunch of stuff that kind of makes crypto Twitter news, like the bad things that happen. But in my experience, it seems like the vast majority of the things, when they go wrong, that people do the right thing and try to help each other out, which is kind of cool. I think we have really good starting conditions.
00:15:56.570 - 00:16:45.320, Speaker E: Yeah, the humans are, by their nature good, right? Like, humans will always make the best available choice on their menu. What's really interesting about how organizations have evolved. So I got deep on this problem over the last two years or so, and humans have organized and evolved over time in these sort of big stages. There are four stages, and the newest one being teal. And a lot of organizations operate from this orange stage where the metaphor is a machine. The goal is to beat competition, to achieve profit and growth at all costs, which actually comes from a place of distrusting humans. So even though individuals like in interconnection are going to be good actors, actually at an organizational level, we've trained people to distrust and mistrust each other.
00:16:45.320 - 00:17:16.100, Speaker E: And then you sort of get what's in vogue right now in organizations with green organizations, where the metaphor is a family, and that's good. It focuses on culture and empowerment. But there's one that's further to that, which is a lot more in line with how crypto is. It's viewed as living entities that are organizing towards their full potential. So as I think about dows getting created, if that mindset isn't there, if the mindset of a Dow is we can't trust anyone else because none of our organizations in the past have ever done that, I think we're going to have a lot of problems.
00:17:26.550 - 00:18:13.140, Speaker C: Thinking about it not working right. I don't know why, but I keep being drawn back to early Internet days because one of the first things I want to say is something like a problem right now, high gas, everyone's talking about it, everyone's complaining about it. If one more person mentions it, I'm going to block them on Twitter. But if we go back to the early days of the Internet, the first ISDN lines were ridiculously expensive and they were ridiculously slow, and that was your high gas fees. And over time, that gets faster and that gets more efficient. I don't know. I'm very pessimistic about what's happening in the space.
00:18:13.140 - 00:19:14.870, Speaker C: I struggle with the statement, humans are good. The amount of sheer scams and frauds and people I see on a daily basis coming into the space claiming they've solved stuff that the rest of us have been trying to solve for the last five to ten years, and they just miraculously now know everything. But before they tell you how it's going to work, they're just quickly going to do a token sale. That kind of stuff just rubbed me the wrong way. So I'm very antagonistic and pessimistic about that, but I'm struggling to see a disaster level or apocalypse level event that makes this not work. Every comparison I see with it is early Internet days, early communities organizing. It's very much the vibes of old IRC channels and bulletin boards and stuff, like people coming together that never before were able to communicate or do these things and organizing themselves in a whole new way, if not a new financial.
00:19:14.870 - 00:19:25.370, Speaker C: So I think, sam, you might have found the only area I'm actually optimistic about, and that is that I struggle to see this not surviving.
00:19:27.070 - 00:19:27.820, Speaker D: Interesting.
00:19:30.750 - 00:20:13.994, Speaker B: I agree. The antifragility in the space is high. And you've seen this even like, I don't know, there's so many people that like to shit on maker. During the double black swan event, it seemed like everything was going to blow up. But my initial reaction was like, oh, wow. This rickety defi project built with this weird language survived the biggest financial meltdown in the world. That is probably something there, right? Most definitely something there, right? And I think you've seen them kind of come out of it and rebound despite still all the risks and stuff.
00:20:13.994 - 00:20:24.460, Speaker B: I think the fact that the space has gone through so many ups and downs and it shakes a ton of the bad ideas out and a ton of the weaker teams out as well.
00:20:25.790 - 00:20:53.400, Speaker C: Yeah, that's also a lot. That's the good and the bad that I also like to tell people often is because of the sheer transparent nature of this space. When something goes wrong, it's a lot more public. Everyone knows about it, everyone hears about it, everyone talks about it. When things go wrong in traditional markets or traditional organizations or closed corporations, it still goes wrong. It's just behind closed doors. You just don't hear about it.
00:20:53.400 - 00:21:50.714, Speaker C: It's very often easy to think things happening here are so much worse than they actually are. And that's just because we're all aware of what's happening. But every time something bad has happened, I've seen people get back up and be stronger than before that event occurred. And those are such invaluable lessons learned, because thanks to the nature of the space, I've been able to learn from mistakes that other teams have made and seen how they respond and how I should have done it differently. But coming from a traditional finance background, I can promise you when stuff used to go wrong at the bank or the insurance or whatever, no one knew about that stuff, and we just figured out ways to brush it underneath the carpet as quickly as possible. So every potential failure I can think of is something that ends up making the space stronger. As long as, I guess, people see value here and keep building.
00:21:50.714 - 00:22:38.230, Speaker C: But unless it's like pure mass hysteria and everyone is sharing the same delusion, there's definitely something here. And there's definitely more coming because most of the people that are even on this call or that I talk to on a daily basis have been here since pre 2017, pre 2018 bear markets and stuff. Now, if you could survive that and you're still here, what's going to be the thing that chases you away if through all of that negativity and depression and everything else, you still decided, no, this is where I want to be. Damn, I'm going to have to think more on this, but, yeah, okay. Thank you. Sam. I think you turned me into an optimist.
00:22:41.150 - 00:22:42.650, Speaker D: Not what I intended.
00:22:45.150 - 00:22:47.402, Speaker E: Sam, I've got a question for you, if that's all right.
00:22:47.456 - 00:22:48.700, Speaker D: Yeah, go for it.
00:22:50.110 - 00:23:30.230, Speaker E: And I love that explanation, Andre, around just how visible and how transparent everything is in this space, and so therefore, how much more we feel it as consumers on the other end. Sam, my question for you is that, and really, it's for everyone or anyone who's interested in answering. But in the last cycle, Ethereum really seemed to be used as this financing machine. But in this cycle, it's more about financial services. And then Atoli mentioned that priding product market fit is hard, right? The tech can be easy, simple. Anyone can do that. Maybe not simple, probably not easy, but there are lots of people out there.
00:23:30.230 - 00:23:50.590, Speaker E: So my curiosity is, what is the next product market fit like? Really zooming way out of this cycle? We're still figuring out where consumers are here and how big will be, what consumers stick around for. But you mentioned a touring complete network and Ethereum. So we're obviously getting bigger than financial services. But what's the next one? What's looking like it might be on the horizon?
00:23:51.250 - 00:24:17.186, Speaker D: Yeah. So I think what I'd say is probably two things. The first is mass user apps. We haven't seen Defi get into that largely because of gas costs, among other things. But that's where a huge amount of the upside is. And there are real tech problems there, as well as marketing and adoption ones. I think the other side of this is that it doesn't all have to be finance.
00:24:17.186 - 00:24:44.640, Speaker D: You can decentralize things other than finance. You can decentralize social networks. You could have on chain Twitter, you could have on chain encrypted messaging. And I think that's something which is technologically not that difficult and I think could be super cool and something that some people started to work on, but there hasn't been a ton there. So I would guess we'll see more of that over the next year or two as well.
00:24:46.230 - 00:25:35.818, Speaker C: And also to feed onto that. I've always had this ideology vision that like 510 years, whatever it is, in the future, people aren't going to be talking about the blockchain. Just like nowadays, you don't talk about your fiber line or your ASDL line or any of that stuff. You don't know it's sitting on in what switch is this stuff operating on. But 40 years ago, we did know that stuff, and we were aware of that because you had to be to build this stuff. So we're, I hope, ending up in a position where the apps you use, the things you use, you don't even realize they're running on chain, on chain just facilitates that it's open, trustless, permissionless. And one thing we haven't even tapped into yet is the real decentralized nature of blockchain.
00:25:35.818 - 00:26:29.202, Speaker C: When you can start having a light client on a phone that can just directly connect on chain without needing to go through some kind of centralized API and stuff, you start cutting out that middle layer communication that's already big as well, and a bunch of advancements there. The encryption technology itself, obviously fantastic, that in itself can be leveraged as a tool. Everything you see today that exists on the Internet can exist on chain, but at the same time, everything you see today on the Internet couldn't exist 40 years ago on the Internet. It just wasn't possible. You didn't have the scale, the technology, everything else you have. I think one thing I struggle with a lot when I talk to people in any kind of public forum is there's this expectation of everything has to be ready, everything has to be done. We're already supposed to be at adoption and all of this stuff.
00:26:29.202 - 00:26:58.090, Speaker C: And I keep telling people we're still building these things, and I know a price goes up really quickly and it goes down really fast, but technology doesn't build out at the same speed. So there's this constant sort of tension in terms of how long things take versus how long the people funding these things expect them to take. But I definitely think the end result is a decentralized Internet.
00:27:04.690 - 00:27:43.786, Speaker B: I'm more pessimistic usually. I think the really hard part here is that the advantages of these things are to consumers are really small. You don't notice your ATM fee, you don't notice your $10 a month bank account charge. You don't notice the attention that an advertisement grabs from you. And if you could replace all of that stuff at once, you would probably tell the difference. Then maybe you'd have like a day like, whoa, something's different. Right.
00:27:43.786 - 00:28:31.110, Speaker B: But you might not even be able to put your finger on it. It's really tough to make that be the thing that attracts users. My best hope for this is that there's idealistic founders that believe that that is more important than anything else, and then that's the constraint they're working with, and they try to find products. It's possible they probably could have succeeded without those constraints, but they keep trying until they actually find something, then it blows up. So this is where I think it's just a much harder problem than it seems, and it's going to take a lot of effort.
00:28:32.030 - 00:29:05.618, Speaker C: So maybe to add some qualifications and to see if I can change your pessimism a little bit. The reason blockchain, in its current iteration, is a financial instrument is it evolved out of a need. There was a necessity. We had the financial crisis. People weren't in control of their funds, they couldn't be in control of their funds. And this, while not necessarily built for it, even though sort of it was, it facilitated people to be able to fix the problems they saw in that area. So that's why it's very financial focused currently.
00:29:05.618 - 00:29:57.570, Speaker C: But if you look at the current landscape and the current social, economic markets and all of these things, people are becoming more and more aware of their privacy and what's being done with their information. So that's already sort of another cataclysmic event that if it breaks, and it's going to break, will again cause people to sort of migrate to this side where they're in control of their data, they're in control of their privacy, and all of these different things. While I don't, I agree with you, the barrier to entry and the friction right now is so small that people aren't going to shift. But I think that when you talk about privacy, you talk about dataship ownership, you talk about accessibility. I think these things, with censorship, the way it's happening, is primed to sort of collapse in a similar, like, 2008 finance apocalypse level event. And when that happens, it causes that shift in mentality.
00:29:58.950 - 00:30:04.680, Speaker E: Yeah, this is the end. I've got such a good question for Sam to finish us, but go ahead.
00:30:05.610 - 00:30:10.338, Speaker A: No, if you have a final question, please go for it.
00:30:10.444 - 00:30:49.270, Speaker E: Well, it's on the Andre side of optimism here for Tolle, which is around further than just a decentralized Internet, wondering if we'll start to have decentralized organizations of people. So as people start to organize, they realize the importance of organizing a decentralized manner. And that that is a potential use case that the consumers will and do care about. And what it brings up in my mind is everything we've seen with Wall street bets. And I was curious, Sam's narrative around Wall street bets, kind of what is the synopsis story he tells and how he sees about future interactions with blockchain?
00:30:57.420 - 00:32:08.720, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, it's like blockchain is the obvious outlet for a lot of what we're seeing, and I think it shocks literally no one in the world when Robin Hood banned buying of know people put their money into dogecoin instead. It was sort of the obvious financial transition and who knows what happens. Probably things calm down. But I can certainly tell a narrative here where the floodgates are starting to crack open. The overton window has shifted quite a bit on this in the last month. Like, would you be shocked now if a few members of the House of Representatives on the floor said, like in an angry rant against Robinhood, like crypto fixes this? Like, I wouldn't at this know, I would have been shocked two months ago, but at this point, sort of like, no chance you're not reading people should post it about Dogecoin. It's amazing how quickly and unpredictably some things can shift.
00:32:08.720 - 00:32:12.850, Speaker D: I don't know what happened, but.
00:32:14.900 - 00:32:15.216, Speaker C: It.
00:32:15.238 - 00:32:17.970, Speaker D: Wouldn'T shock me if there's significant inflows in crypto from that.
00:32:19.960 - 00:32:44.730, Speaker A: Well, this was extremely interesting. I want to thank the four of you for participating in this panel. For me, it was the Sam made Andre an optimist panel, so I'm glad I didn't miss it. Thank you, Anatoli, Kristen, Andrea, Sam, for being here.
