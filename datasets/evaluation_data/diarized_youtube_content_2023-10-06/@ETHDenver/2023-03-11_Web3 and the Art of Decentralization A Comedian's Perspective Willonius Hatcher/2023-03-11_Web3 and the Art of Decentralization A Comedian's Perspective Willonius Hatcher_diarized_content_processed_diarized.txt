00:00:22.260 - 00:00:25.112, Speaker A: You good?
00:00:25.166 - 00:00:28.980, Speaker B: All right. What's up, y'all? Let's make some noise.
00:00:29.060 - 00:00:29.800, Speaker A: Whoo.
00:00:30.940 - 00:00:59.292, Speaker B: All right, cool. The name of my talk today is called a talk about web three. And first of all, my name is Willonius Hatcher. Some people call me avocado Poppy. I also go by Willonius 9000 because sometimes I go over 9000, if you guys know what that's about. That's me. So I'm a stand up comedian, author, comedy rapper.
00:00:59.292 - 00:01:18.840, Speaker B: I do a lot. But now I came here to give my perspective on web three. With that said, let's get right into it. The biggest thing about web three is nobody knows what the fuck is going on. Let's be honest. We're all just kind of winging it, and that's cool. Sometimes in life, it's cool to wing it.
00:01:18.840 - 00:01:32.540, Speaker B: I'm winging it right now. I was in my hotel room, and I was like, oh, I got to talk tomorrow. Let's put a slide deck together. Look at this. With a minimalist font. It's great. All the experts that we have out here, they're winging it, too.
00:01:32.540 - 00:01:52.390, Speaker B: Last year, I spent a lot of money investing in Dogecoin because Elon was like, this is the shit. Now look at my. It's crazy. Also, I also bought. I'm not proud of this, but I was at the time. There's a token called Pussy Finance. Are you guys familiar with that? I bought a lot of pussy last year.
00:01:52.390 - 00:02:21.144, Speaker B: Not my proudest moment, but I did it. It was a great community. We had a good run. It was cool to jump on Clubhouse and Twitter and be like, hey, I'm holding pussy, but now I'm losing money. Next up, have fun. Look, we're here at this cool conference. This is a great opportunity to meet people, join communities, have unprotected sex.
00:02:21.144 - 00:02:32.000, Speaker B: It's great. You know what I'm saying? Meet somebody. You can mint your pregnancy, put your baby on a blockchain. I don't know. I'm just saying, have fun while we're here, man. They got parties. Super dope.
00:02:32.000 - 00:02:49.604, Speaker B: Build shit. Definitely build shit, man. It's important that you build shit. Last year, I did a bunch of comedy shows in the Metaverse. I was doing VR comedy shows. It was, like, the dopest experience ever. You guys look like very smart people.
00:02:49.604 - 00:03:15.740, Speaker B: I'm pretty sure you guys are building shit, too. So maybe this doesn't apply to you because you're already doing said shit, but if you're not, bullshit, but don't be shitty. Do not be shitty. The reason that we're in web three is because web two was kind of shitty. Like, let's be honest. You know what I'm saying? Don't be a shitty person. Don't be the person that.
00:03:15.740 - 00:03:38.710, Speaker B: No, what's the quote be the change that you want to see or something like that. You guys know what I mean? Don't be your dick and don't be shitty. Now, I'm going to do some songs because I wrote some songs and I like them. Okay? And I'm going to let you guys know. I don't know all the words to my songs. I wrote them last night. I recorded them last night.
00:03:38.710 - 00:04:00.012, Speaker B: And if I fuck up on the words, sue me, don't sue me, but you get it. All right, let me find this track. This first song is inspired by Travis Scott. It's called hold at east. So I put the words up here so you guys can read along while. And also I can read along. Okay, here we go.
00:04:00.146 - 00:04:02.510, Speaker A: South side on the track. Yeah.
