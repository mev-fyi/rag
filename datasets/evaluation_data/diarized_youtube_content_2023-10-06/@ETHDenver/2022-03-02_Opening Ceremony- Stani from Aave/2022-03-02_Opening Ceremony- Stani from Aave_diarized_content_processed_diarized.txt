00:00:03.210 - 00:00:06.558, Speaker A: Hey everyone. So my name is Tanikolachev, I'm the.
00:00:06.644 - 00:00:08.586, Speaker B: Founder and CEO of Ave. And Ave.
00:00:08.618 - 00:00:19.786, Speaker A: Is the team that created the Ave protocol, which is one of the most exciting d five protocols out there. And also we're a team that builds.
00:00:19.818 - 00:00:21.790, Speaker B: A lot of web three infrastructure.
00:00:22.370 - 00:00:37.240, Speaker A: Recently we launched the lens protocol that is open social web three graph. And the idea is that you can build any kind of like a composable social media applications without recreating the platform.
00:00:37.550 - 00:00:40.522, Speaker B: Effect that traditional web two social media.
00:00:40.576 - 00:00:43.334, Speaker A: Companies need to do when they launch.
00:00:43.382 - 00:00:45.130, Speaker B: New social media applications.
00:00:45.790 - 00:01:03.010, Speaker A: Ave also builds a lot of other interesting things. We for example are focusing now on building NFT as a collateral protocol. And also we have amazing experimentations department called nude. And the idea of nude is that.
00:01:03.080 - 00:01:05.838, Speaker B: We create different kinds of experimentations, smart.
00:01:05.854 - 00:01:17.506, Speaker A: Project based or just something in between with the community openly in transparent fashion. We have open figma sessions, open coding.
00:01:17.538 - 00:01:20.102, Speaker B: Sessions and the idea is to try.
00:01:20.156 - 00:01:27.014, Speaker A: Something that hasn't been tried before and obviously fail quite a lot.
00:01:27.052 - 00:01:29.046, Speaker B: So that's what experimentations is.
00:01:29.148 - 00:01:32.186, Speaker A: In terms of the average protocol there.
00:01:32.208 - 00:01:32.986, Speaker B: Is a lot of things you can.
00:01:33.008 - 00:02:21.926, Speaker A: Build, but also to give more wider context. So we have been supporting hackathons for few years now. And if Denver is definitely one of the magical times out there, so magical that I had to put some makeup on to come here and spook you all out. And most important message I will say is that have fun, make friends, be polite, be kind, but also embrace innovation, embrace ideas, find things that you basically want to build or share ideas. The more you share with the community, the more feedback you get. And essentially if you're a newcomer to the whole web three space, just enjoy, have fun and make friends.
00:02:22.108 - 00:02:24.134, Speaker B: That's, I think it's the most important thing.
00:02:24.252 - 00:02:43.326, Speaker A: Thank you so much and I wish everyone nice time at Denver and follow us on Twitter, meet our team there. We have a lot of people there from Ave, from lens and Newt and wish you all have good time and thank you so much for doing this.
00:02:43.428 - 00:02:43.820, Speaker B: Thank you.
