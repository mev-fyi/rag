00:00:00.970 - 00:00:09.358, Speaker A: Hey, guys, come on up. Will, Antonio. Yep, yep, come on up. Let's do it. Here you go. Thank you for coming.
00:00:09.444 - 00:00:10.240, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:00:34.210 - 00:01:17.700, Speaker C: Hey, guys, how's it going? I am Antonio, the founder of DYDX, and joining me is Will, the founder of Zerox. We're going to talk today about the history of Dexs. So will, we've both been around in the space for a while now. I remember you started Zero X when I was at Coinbase like eight or nine years ago. And all of us knew what you were doing. You came and hanged out with us a lot at Coinbase, and I really did not understand what you were doing when you tried to come in and explain what the heck a Dex was to me and the rest of us at Coinbase. So how did you come up with the idea? How did you get the conviction to start a decentralized exchange before that was even a thing?
00:01:18.070 - 00:02:31.078, Speaker B: Yeah. First of all, thank you, Antonio, for joining. So pretty soon after the ERC 20 token standard was created, this is around mid 2015, started experimenting with Ethereum smart contracts. In my spare time, I was still in grad school, so I'd spend most of my nights and weekends like hacking on Ethereum smart contracts. But pretty soon got kind of this core thesis that the ERC 20 token standard is such a powerful primitive, and that allowing tokens to be globally accessible on a public blockchain like Ethereum is such a disruptive and powerful new technology. Kind of developed this core thesis that all forms of value would end up tokenized on public blockchains like Ethereum, like billions of different tokenized assets. So things like traditional assets, stocks, bonds, fiat currencies, things like video game items and airline miles, and even things that we couldn't really create or couldn't exist before smart contracts, platforms like Ethereum.
00:02:31.078 - 00:03:47.620, Speaker B: And one of the things that initially, my co founder Amir and I were trying to build a decentralized exchange venue. So a company that owns a decentralized exchange, and we were in the San Francisco kind of Ethereum developer community at that time. And as we met more and more teams in that space, like Auger and gnosis and Mellonport and Makerdao, the one thing that they all had in common is that they all required exchange functionality in order for their use case to be possible. But they weren't necessarily focused on decentralized exchange. It was just a necessary building block. So after enough of these conversations, it kind of became clear that there is a much bigger opportunity to create a platform where anyone could create a decentralized exchange marketplace, rather than just creating a single Dex application on its own. And so kind of interacting with Ethereum developers in those early days in SF, that is really what kind of made the idea of a decentralized exchange protocol kind of click for us.
00:03:47.620 - 00:03:54.690, Speaker B: That's when we started developing zero x protocol around the end of 2016.
00:03:55.110 - 00:04:28.538, Speaker C: Interesting. Yeah, I remember when DyDx was founded in 2017, I actually was inspired by you. I think I went to a talk that you gave in San Francisco at the time, and I remember having this experience at Coinbase. And Coinbase back in 2015 was an awesome place. There were a ton of people. Brian Armstrong, of course, Fred Olaf Vitalik came and gave a lot of talks there. And I remember it took me a while to wrap my head around what the heck is Ethereum? What is a smart contract? But once I did, it became clear that this is a new paradigm of computing.
00:04:28.538 - 00:05:34.900, Speaker C: And I was like, there must be something that you could build on top of this that's going to be really valuable. And it took me a while to figure out what that was, but I remember going to the talk you gave, and I was like, damn, this actually seems like the first thing I've seen that actually makes sense, an exchange of value in a totally decentralized way. And that's really how the genesis of the idea for Dydx happened, where I took a look at things like Zerox, and there were Kyber and some other decentralized exchanges at the time, and asked myself, what comes next after this? And to me it was pretty clear it was margin trading, it was derivatives, it was more sophisticated forms of trading. But I think this is a really good way to look at the evolution of markets. Look at something that's really early and working and ask yourself, okay, does this actually make sense? Is this going to stick around? And then, second of all, what's going to come next after this? So that was really the genesis of the idea for DyDX. And obviously, DyDx and Zerox have changed a lot over time. I'm curious, in a minute or two, how would you describe the biggest impact of the change from what Zero X was at the beginning to what it is today?
00:05:36.410 - 00:06:46.300, Speaker B: Good question. So a lot has changed over seven years now. I think we originally went out with this vision of let's build this open source, decentralized exchange protocol, and our team, we will not build any sort of user facing application. We're not going to build a business. We're just going to provide this infrastructure, and we're going to allow anyone to go and create their own kind of marketplace or decentralized exchange on top of it. And I think over time, it's become clear that in order to build something that is going to be sustainable, that is going to be used and stand the test of time, building directly for a customer and building something that a customer is willing to pay for is critical to building the right thing. And so if you really want to create something that is going to drive a lot of value and that is going to stand the test of time, you have to be building directly for your customer.
00:06:46.300 - 00:07:23.462, Speaker B: And that's actually one of the things that, looking back, I really admire about your approach in founding DyDX. At the time, we were fully focused on, let's just build this public neutral infrastructure. We're not going to interact with any end user applications. We'll just build for developers. And I remember early on, you were very much focused on how do we build the very best product for our customer, and laser focus on that. And I thought that was like a very unique approach at the time. And, yeah, I'm kind of curious how that kind of has evolved over the years.
00:07:23.596 - 00:07:59.230, Speaker C: I think it's stayed the same. I mean, this is just how you build new things. You have to have a clear vision at mind for who are you building for, what's their problem and how are you going to solve it for them? And this is the continuous question I ask myself when we build DyDX, and how DyDX has evolved has changed a lot over time. So we started with margin trading, actually, and fast forward to today. We're focused on derivatives and perpetual contracts. And I think that really mirrors the evolution of the crypto market as a whole. Back in 2017, margin trading was the dominant way that crypto was traded.
00:07:59.230 - 00:08:37.834, Speaker C: It was the highest volume markets today, that's perpetuals and derivative contracts. DyDx went through a pretty significant change about like four years ago now or so, where we built our first perpetuals contract at the time, and nobody had done this before. We didn't know whether it was possible. In retrospect, a lot of these things seem obvious. It's like, oh, yeah, of course you could build a smart contract for what a perpetual contract is, but it's not obvious at the time and really going out into the unknown and solving these things that users actually want to use. And this was right around the time when Bitmex was blowing up. Perpetuals were becoming a really big thing in centralized exchanges.
00:08:37.834 - 00:09:05.894, Speaker C: So we ask ourselves, okay, is this a clear market? Yes, definitely. It was really blowing up users wanted this. Do we believe this is going to come into defi? Yes, of course. This is our basic thesis that more of trading is going to become decentralized over time. And then third of all, how do we actually build this? And then responding to what you said, will, I think this is, I don't know, I have to make this point so often, honestly. But it's kind of a controversial opinion in crypto. That product should come first.
00:09:05.894 - 00:09:40.354, Speaker C: Like what are you actually building? What users are you targeting? Who are you building for? And I think people just don't ask themselves this enough. I think that in crypto there's so much hype, there's so much noise that you can get really caught up in it, you can get caught up in the buzwords. You can build your next l one and collect your $10 billion. That's not actually interesting to me. What it's interesting to me is building an actual product that end users use. And I think that's remained the same. Like DyDX has changed a lot, but that's the one thing that's remained the same.
00:09:40.354 - 00:09:44.420, Speaker C: So I feel proud of that. And yeah, I see that evolution a lot in Zerox as well.
00:09:44.790 - 00:10:18.318, Speaker B: Yeah. Building for customers, first building a product, finding product market fit, and then gradually decentralizing over time. It seems like that's kind of the trajectory that you followed and. Yeah. Curious. One of your big customers as a derivatives platform are market makers. And I'm curious, as you spent more time building for market makers and learning about what's important to them, how do you build now? It's a perpetual platform that's doing a billion dollars a day.
00:10:18.318 - 00:10:22.186, Speaker B: How do you get to that point? By interacting and learning from market makers.
00:10:22.298 - 00:10:46.674, Speaker C: Yeah, and it's interesting. So talk about knowing who you're building for. But a lot of these marketplaces are two sided, right? So you usually have two different types of users. So our biggest classes of users are, as will said, more professional market making firms. And these traders really require a higher amount of throughput. Really advanced trading features, an API experience that's similar to a centralized exchange. And it's hard to do that in Defi.
00:10:46.674 - 00:11:36.098, Speaker C: They require quite a lot of throughput. So one of the things that both Zerox and DyDX have championed for a long time is the use of order books in decentralized exchanges. So that remains the case for DyDX today. And really the big challenge that we had to solve in the last few years was how do we build a performant order book in a fully decentralized way that had never been done before, and we didn't again know if it was possible. But the big solution to that that we've come up with in the past year or two is we've built the first ever decentralized but off chain order book, and this is running in production today on the DyDX chain. And again, we just really asked ourselves, who are our users? What do they care about? They care about performance, they care about reliability. They care about advanced trading using an order book rather than just lping on an amm.
00:11:36.098 - 00:11:41.480, Speaker C: And that was a big genesis of why we focused on that so and so.
00:11:42.010 - 00:12:22.566, Speaker B: One of the things that's interesting is in the early days of Ethereum, there was kind of like an era of order books that weren't central limit order books, meaning that there was no matching engine, there was no guarantees around price time. Priority orders could get front run, there could be trade collisions. And the central limit order book model, it seems like that's one of the things that really is important for attracting professional, institutional customers. And I'm curious if that kind of evolution was something that was directly requested by market makers or if it was something you kind of came to that conclusion on your own.
00:12:22.668 - 00:13:02.674, Speaker C: Yeah, and I mean, honestly give you guys most of the credit for popularizing order books within decentralized exchanges. But absolutely, I think the key piece is, how do you do matching in a decentralized way on an order book? So when there's orders that cross, how do you actually fill them? This is a fairly hard problem. So it certainly was something that seemed required. Again, we really start with the product first and ask ourselves, who are our users? Okay, they're market makers. Where are they trading? They're trading on centralized exchanges. How do we build that? How do we make something that's really similar to a centralized exchange? But in defi, these are hard problems, but that's what you're supposed to solve as technologists. So we've gone through a number of iterations on this.
00:13:02.674 - 00:13:35.358, Speaker C: DyDX has taken a progressive approach to decentralization. And we started with running the order book and the matching engine in a central way, sort of similar to what a zero x relayer is or used to be. And now we fully decentralize that. So I think it's been quite a journey switching gears a little bit, and I feel like we should challenge ourselves to ask the hard questions. I'm curious how you, and I'll answer this, too. How did we both react to the rise of Uniswap about four years ago, because I feel like that really took the defi market by storm, and probably both of us as well.
00:13:35.524 - 00:14:21.290, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, there's no denying that Uniswap version one completely changed the landscape, and the entire defi space wouldn't be what it is today without Uniswap coming and introducing the concept of a constant function market maker. And I think enormous praise to the Uniswap team. We are a Dex aggregator, so we aggregate uniswap liquidity in a lot of ways. So there's always some tension in the space, competitors versus cooperators. So coopetition. Interestingly so when Uniswap first came out, I actually didn't really think it had that much potential.
00:14:21.630 - 00:14:22.540, Speaker C: Me too.
00:14:23.410 - 00:15:16.400, Speaker B: And the reason is because Uniswap version one is very capital inefficient. So with Uniswap version three introduced this concept of concentrated liquidity. You can kind of push all that liquidity closer to the spot price of the market. But in unit swap versions one and two, you had to essentially provide full range liquidity. And this is super duper capital and efficient. One of my greatest assumptions, which turned out very wrong, was that it wouldn't really be possible for hundreds of millions of dollars to end up deposited into a constant function market maker like Uniswap. It just seemed completely like a crazy concept that people are going to put hundreds of millions of dollars into this thing, and that is what is necessary to create a sufficiently liquid market.
00:15:16.400 - 00:16:15.498, Speaker B: Turned out super duper wrong, but I think it was an important learning as well. Uniswap also made it possible for long tail tokens to be liquid. So one of the key. Yeah, kind of the key disruption or the key of Uniswap was that it lowered the barrier to entry for standing up brand new markets. So instead of having to go to a finance or a coinbase and to attempt to get your token listed now, anyone could create a token in ten minutes, they could go spin up a Uniswap market in ten minutes, they could deposit some tokens and passively provide liquidity. And this was critical to this tokenization thesis. And that was one of the things that I think Uniswap just completely unlocked and definitely wouldn't be here today if they hadn't.
00:16:15.594 - 00:16:44.998, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's really interesting the way you started this talk with the conviction you had at the beginning was there's going to be so many tokens, tokens for everything. It needs a medium of exchange. And I think all your points, I thought as well. On Uniswap, I felt like it was, okay, this is fine. This is kind of like a simple exchange that maybe people will use a little bit, but you have to understand where the space was back in 2020, 2019 or so. When Uniswap was founded, there was just not very much volume. There was not very much capital in crypto, and especially in DFI.
00:16:44.998 - 00:17:24.306, Speaker C: And it was really hard to foresee the rate of explosion that Uniswap had at the time. And I had a couple of really important learnings from that. One of the things that not that many people know about DYDX is that DYDX used to be the biggest decentralized exchange in the world by a lot, four or five years ago. So in 2019, 2020, DYDX had over 50% market share for decentralized exchanges. We were sitting pretty. Yeah, the market was really small, but we felt like we understood this market, it was going to grow, and we were the leader. And the thing that happened to us in 2020 is we got absolutely fucked by Uniswap.
00:17:24.306 - 00:18:11.970, Speaker C: Like, we went from 50% market share all the way down to 1% market share in the course of six months, and we grew a little bit over that period of time. This was like the bull market in 2020, but not nearly as much as Uniswap. They just absolutely started going crazy, going exponential, and it's really the reason for that was hard to understand immediately to me, but over time, it became very clear that it was because they had the ability to trade so many markets on Uniswap. And DyDx did not have that. We were focusing just on three markets at the time, and Uniswap swap started having hundreds, thousands of markets, and we really had to change our strategy around that. And fast forward to today. DyDx is around the same volume, a little bit more than Uniswap.
00:18:11.970 - 00:18:51.074, Speaker C: Normally, derivatives are higher volume than spot, and we've made a comeback. But the biggest learning that I had from that is there's this really core driver, I feel, of what becomes popular in crypto. And I think the core driver of everything that's become popular in crypto is it's really about the number of things that can be traded, about the number of assets that exist on the chain. And this basically defines, and in my opinion, explains pretty much every trend that's become really popular in crypto. It's like, okay, crypto is invented. There's like five assets you can trade back in the day. Bitcoin, eth, Coinbase, and a few other exchanges support those.
00:18:51.074 - 00:19:03.430, Speaker C: Fast forward to 2017. Icos become a thing now. There's hundreds of assets that you can trade. Fast forward to 2020. Uniswap enables thousands of markets to be traded. There's another bull market. It blows up.
00:19:03.430 - 00:19:28.894, Speaker C: Fast forward to 2021, 2022. Nfts become a thing now. There's like tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of things that you can trade. And I think this is the really core thing that we're focused on now at DuiDX. And the core learning that we've had is really about the number of markets that you can trade, about the quality of those markets and liquidity that you can give. But I really think one of the cool things about crypto is that it's so transparent. You can see exactly what your competitors are doing.
00:19:28.894 - 00:19:58.466, Speaker C: You can look at their smart contracts, you can see exactly what their metrics are. And I think for anybody that's building in the space, the thing I would encourage you to do is do that, look at your competitors and be really honest about that. And it's hard to do, especially if you're losing or especially if you haven't won yet, to be really honest. What's the core reason why your competitors are beating you? Or what's the core reason why Uniswap, DyDx, whatever else, has become popular at this point? How can you do better? What's the next thing you can build? And that was the really big learning I feel like I had from Uniswap.
00:19:58.578 - 00:20:20.640, Speaker B: Yeah. Permissionless finance, the ability to permissionlessly innovate and create anything you want on the platform without asking for permission. Yeah, I agree. So on that note, I'm curious. I know that DyDx chain, I know that you're making a push to have the ability to support more tokens, more markets. And I'm curious how you're thinking about that over the next years.
00:20:21.170 - 00:20:57.946, Speaker C: So this is the core thesis that we're trying to play out on DyDX. Now, can we have hundreds of markets, thousands of markets on DyDX? And there's a lot that goes into this, but the big thing we're developing right now is the ability to have permissionless market listings on DYDX. So in the same way anybody could come to uniswap, just send a transaction and add a market to uniswap. Could you do that for a derivatives market? And that's a hard problem. But again, that's kind of our specialty, is solving these things. And we really feel like we can build that in the next couple months. And I think that's incredibly exciting when combined with derivatives, because with derivatives, you can trade anything.
00:20:57.946 - 00:21:41.478, Speaker C: All you need is an oracle price, and you can start trading the thing. And I think it's just, again, a continuation of the thesis we've seen play out in crypto for a long time now. It is permissionless finance. And really, the thing I try to ask myself is, what can you uniquely build with Defi? If it's not unique, if it's not something that's uniquely enabled by DeFi or by whatever technology that you're building on, you shouldn't build it. If it is uniquely enabled by whatever technology that you're building on and solves the needs of actual customers, that is the business that you should build. So that's the question I always ask myself. What's something fundamentally new that we can build with Dydx? And I think you see a lot of that going on in crypto, and that basically explains everything that's become popular so far.
00:21:41.644 - 00:21:54.830, Speaker B: Strong plus one. Well, we are at time. That was quick, but I think we'll leave it on that note. Thank you so much, Antonio. Really appreciate you walking us through some of your thought process, and thank you all for attending. Appreciate it.
00:21:54.980 - 00:21:55.930, Speaker C: Awesome. Thanks, Walt.
