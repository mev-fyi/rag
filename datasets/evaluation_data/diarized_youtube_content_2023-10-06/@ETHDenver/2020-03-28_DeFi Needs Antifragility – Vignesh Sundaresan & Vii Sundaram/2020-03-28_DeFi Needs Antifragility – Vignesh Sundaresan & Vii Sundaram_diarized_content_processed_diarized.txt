00:00:13.210 - 00:01:08.642, Speaker A: Hey there, I'm big nish and this is v. We are from the Lendride protocol. We've been working on DeFi now for three years and we published various pay us over last couple of years on how to approach defi, crypto lending and different formats to see how we can make this more reliable, stable. Today. If you look at the defy land space itself, right? So it's not very stable. There is lot of ad hoc liquidation happening and I don't know how much of you know about the pray for 3228 meme. It was something that happened a year ago and actually we made a video on how it would have felt to be that person.
00:01:08.642 - 00:01:20.102, Speaker A: Right. I'll just play this video and we'll continue. This is an imaginary piece, right? Like with various things that happen in Defi and things that happen to my friends.
00:01:20.156 - 00:01:35.050, Speaker B: Also decentralized worldwide web is hundreds or thousands of decentralized protocols. Some of them will be like Ethereum. And Ethereum has its orders of magnitude bigger than anything else, and it's growing faster than everything else. So it will be significant going forward.
00:01:35.120 - 00:01:45.290, Speaker C: A survivor, in other words. Absolutely. Hey, baby. So much. Bailey. Say hi, daddy.
00:01:45.630 - 00:01:48.078, Speaker D: Not now, lil, I'm busy. What do you want?
00:01:48.244 - 00:01:51.214, Speaker C: You want to try that again without biting my head off?
00:01:51.412 - 00:02:06.520, Speaker D: Ether? It could touch 100 by today and I could lose everything. We could lose the house, we could lose everything. But don't worry, it can't go below. Hunt, 1 second. I'll call you right back.
00:02:08.010 - 00:02:11.510, Speaker B: What are your top? We have a product bonus.
00:02:28.570 - 00:02:42.080, Speaker C: For not it. Nobody told me you could lose money on it.
00:04:26.350 - 00:05:13.302, Speaker A: Thank you. So this one is just an imaginary video, right? But this is a combination of stories of a lot of people who use defy today. Like you borrow, and you don't know what's going to happen tomorrow. And usually that's not the case in the real world, right? You can have a term loan and you can sleep well at night. And that's what we are going to reimagine with Lendride this time. So we'll talk about how we are designing this protocol so that it can handle these kind of jerks in the price of the underlying collateral. So how do we solve this? We need to enable transparent, more transparent risk transfers.
00:05:13.302 - 00:06:08.300, Speaker A: Today, if you go on one of the decentralized lending protocols, you'd be like, oh, I can earn an interest of 7%, but are you earning a risk free interest? That's not true. You're also risking the fact that there could be a blacks on even tomorrow and the loss could be passed on to the lenders. And this is not being transparently advertised to people either. So that's one thing. And we need to introduce strict loan cycles so that the liabilities of the loans can be solved within every loan cycle and it does not carry on to the whole system. And we achieve these by tokenizing so that we can create secondary markets around them, so that we can bring in and converge liquidity around certain strike prices, certain terms. So how are we doing this? We are introducing a new token standard.
00:06:08.300 - 00:06:51.034, Speaker A: We're calling it the multifungible token or an MFT. So today we have a fungible token, which is an ERC 20 and an ERC 721, which is a non fungible token. So imagine a non fungible token to have various parameters that are different all across, right? So if there are two non fungible tokens that share all the parameters, then they become fungible. And today we don't have a specific token standard where we can do that. So this is important. And this can be used in use cases like financial derivatives. So we take financial derivatives and something like a put option.
00:06:51.034 - 00:08:02.214, Speaker A: The put option has the same payoff formula across the board, but depending on its parameter, like the strike price, the underlying price, the term, it's going to be fungible or non fungible. And with the introduction of the MFTs, what's happening here is we get to just deploy one token contract while we allow any kind of, say a put option under each collateral so that it can support different kind of loans, different kind of collateral ratios for each loan. So we'll take a look at the, we build the whole protocol based on these tokens. And we have a short demo. So I will explain through the demo so that we can take a glimpse of how these tokens work together to create these loans. So what you're seeing here is we are creating two accounts. One of the accounts is going to function as the underwriter account and the other one is going to function as the borrower account.
00:08:02.214 - 00:08:41.842, Speaker A: What we are trying to demonstrate here is that the underwriter can create these mfts and transfer them to the borrower. And so the borrower can use them as a combination in order to create a new loan. So you start with the underwriter. So we'll start with the underwriter. Right now we are taking the die and wrapping it so that it can be accessed by the system. And then once we do that, we are able to split this die. Oh yeah, you're wrapping it now.
00:08:41.842 - 00:09:51.362, Speaker A: Still wrapping. Sorry. So we've wrapped the die. Now, right now we are going to split this die on a specific price feed and a specific graph so you can choose how much dye you want to split and then you choose the underlying asset. In this case, it's just going to be eth. And you also say what is the strike price that's going to be there? So this way what you are trying to create here is that the underwriter is going to underwrite a loan where if the price of the collateral is going to go down below $100, the underwriter starts paying out to compensate for the loss in the price of the collateral. And this is going to exist until you can also choose the term or how long this contract is going to be live.
00:09:51.362 - 00:10:22.884, Speaker A: Right. So in this case we are choosing 26 March 2020. So once you do that, you would see that the balances are going to change. So if you see the balances on the sufi tokens, they are going to reflect that there are s tokens in the system now and also itokens. And then you can go ahead as a borrower. So as the borrower now. So this is the underwrited part.
00:10:22.884 - 00:11:25.198, Speaker A: Right. So the other side is the borrower. So as the borrower, there is an interesting idea here. So because these are all fixed terms for the length of the loan, you're going to lock up your collateral. So what you're going to do first is that you can split your collateral, you can split your collateral into an f and an itoken, where the f token functions like a futures token or a frozen token, and an itoken functions as an interest token. So since you are not going to be accessing as a borrower the collateral for the period of the loan, you are able to actually have a freely tradable itoken, which you can further sell it to other people who have the option to use the itoken to get a loan, which would be an ets loan instead of a die loan. So you would see that the balances of the borrower has been updated.
00:11:25.198 - 00:12:00.122, Speaker A: Right. So now what we are going to do is, because we don't have a market running yet, we are going to let the underwriter transfer his s tokens and itokens to the borrower. Now usually this is going to happen for a price, but we are skipping that part. And so the underwriter is just sending his tokens across to the borrower. Cool. So he sent the s tokens, right? Itoken. Okay.
00:12:00.122 - 00:12:38.430, Speaker A: And he's going to send the s tokens now. Nice. So you can go back on the borrower okay, so the borrower, now if you take a look at the account, you can see that it's updated with the s tokens, the itokens, and also the wh. So let's go ahead and try to take a loan. Now. We need to enable the market. We need to just set the market.
00:12:38.430 - 00:14:04.592, Speaker A: Okay. Which, okay, so we are creating a pool on the background, but we don't want to go into the details right now because again, already it's complex enough. I guess I'll just keep it simple. So now the borrower goes to the borrow screen, change the account. Okay, go to the borrow screen. And with all these complexity. Right.
00:14:04.592 - 00:14:31.850, Speaker A: Just a minute. So with all this complexity, even though it looks like, oh, what's happening with the s token? What's happening with itoken? For an end user, the end borrower, it's going to be quite simple. He's going to choose the loan currency, the term of the loan, and he's going to choose what his underlying collateral is going to be. Right. And what is the amount of loan he's requiring to access. And you can change like 200.
00:14:34.400 - 00:14:34.716, Speaker C: And.
00:14:34.738 - 00:14:56.936, Speaker A: Then click on the loan and. Cool. That's it, right? Okay. Yeah. So that's it. So at this point, the borrower now has a new loan and he does not have to worry about it until the end of the term. That's going to be 26 March.
00:14:56.936 - 00:15:50.422, Speaker A: So by using these new token economics, we've achieved something where you got fixed interest rates and fixed terms, and this can get complex. So we are going to stop the demo here and go back to the slides. Cool. So what all this means is that now the cost of the loan right now is based on the loan currency. So if you want to die loan today, you pay a flat fee of like seven percentage or ten percentage or whatever, right. But actually depending on the amount of collateral you can place and the type of collateral you can place by, in this model, the cost of the loan is going to vary. So that's more like what's in the real world and loan maintenance.
00:15:50.422 - 00:16:56.190, Speaker A: So you don't have to worry about your loan until the end of the term. So you can go on and you can go on, sleep well, come back, have an alarm probably, and just make sure that you repay the loan before the end of the term. And what are the other opportunities? So today in defi, you can participate as a lender and you're going to put your capital into a pool where people can use it to borrow. But in this case, you can be a borrower but you can also be an underwriter where you enable these loans. So for example, you can create a s token, which is a put option on Ethereum and for a strike, for example $50 for 31 March and sell it for a dollar, right? So depending on your risk appetite, all these new kinds of tokens now are possible. So that's going to create a lot more of business opportunities and decisioning. So we want to move away from governance in adding new collateral, in adding new terms or whatever.
00:16:56.190 - 00:17:51.634, Speaker A: And we are letting the market dynamics, because anyone can create these tokens. Wherever the liquidity is going to assemble is what is going to be the markets that are being supported. So as a loan market and as a protocol, there are no prescriptions on what collateral is being supported or what terms are being supported. Everything is market driven. So because of the way this protocol is defined, it has these beautiful things, these money blocks, right? Like Legos that come together and fall in place in order to create this product which is lending. But you could also take this up and do various other things. So we are looking for people who can actually make markets around it, who can build their own businesses around it.
00:17:51.634 - 00:18:29.754, Speaker A: You can run your own risk pools, you can run your own UI, and there are a lot of opportunities just using those tokens that you can build on. So come talk to us. We have a booth in the floor above. We are also looking for feedback on the model itself. So if you're going to come to the booth, if you have an email id, you can leave it with us so that we'll send you the information and it'll be nice to hear from you. And a big shout out to Quanstam. And we primarily work with the wiper code, devs Bryant and Jackus.
00:18:29.754 - 00:19:01.460, Speaker A: And we also use et brownie. Ben Houser is the person who actually maintains that. So these are the tools without which we could not do what we are doing today. And if you go on developers lindroi.com, you could download the UI, the same UI you saw here, and you can try it out. I know it's a little complex, but it's just getting started. So we would really appreciate the thoughts you have.
00:19:01.460 - 00:19:03.440, Speaker A: Yeah, that's it. Thanks a lot.
