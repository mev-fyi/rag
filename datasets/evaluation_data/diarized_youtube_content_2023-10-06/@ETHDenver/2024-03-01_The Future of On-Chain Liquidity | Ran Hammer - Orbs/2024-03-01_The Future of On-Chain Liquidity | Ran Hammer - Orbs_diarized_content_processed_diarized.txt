00:00:00.090 - 00:00:26.914, Speaker A: Of the best use cases we found for that is twap and limit orders for decentralized exchanges. I'm sure everybody here knows what a limit order is. It's an order that sits there waiting for the right price. It then gets executed at the right price. And twap is time weighted average price. It means that I want to do a large trade. Either I want to do DCA, so I want to go in gradually into a position or out gradually out of a position, or I want to neutralize volatility.
00:00:26.914 - 00:01:09.620, Speaker A: So I would cut the trade into a bunch of smaller trades and get them executed. I can take $1,000, do $100 trade each over intervals of ten minutes, or 1 hour, or one day, or one week. And that's twap. That's stuff that's very used in centralized exchanges and in treadfi, but it's very hard to implement on the amm. So with orbs layer integrated, you can have tup unlimited for dexes. We have twelve dexes integrated now, and we're growing that on seven different chains, 13,000 tup orders placed, 5400 different wallets and over $40 million in open interest. So that's going very, very well.
00:01:09.620 - 00:01:41.894, Speaker A: But that's, I would say like an easy use case. One, it's not something you can really monetize. There's not so much money in this, not so much protocol revenue. You could put a little bit of a fee on limit orders, but it's not that interesting, not that material. And also we feel like our network could do compute that's more robust. And we wanted to look for a right use case to use this, to use it for. And that gave us to a place where we came back and kind of think about what's going on, where is it valuable.
00:01:41.894 - 00:02:11.750, Speaker A: And one of the things that we have a very strong conviction on is that the next bull market is going to be on chain. This is something we strongly believe in, and there's many reasons why we think that. One, we do see month to month grow on Dex volumes. We do see Dex volumes grow. This is supposed to be a graph. Our designer here was very creative, but this is the graph. So essentially, we do see growth month to month in Dex volume, and we do see a lot of more on chain activity.
00:02:11.750 - 00:03:10.626, Speaker A: Also, in looking at regulation, we have seen obviously the crackdown on, you know, the SEC has been super aggressive with binance, with Coinbase, with other venues as well, and tokens. While on DeFi, we do see that at least the regulators kind of approach to DeFi, it still hasn't been defined. So I'm not necessarily saying it's positive. I'm just saying we don't see active enforcement actions against DeFi protocols at this point. And what happens is specifically here in the US, we are seeing a lot of people moving out of CFI and into DeFi. I think a lot of the people trading today are DeFi first. And also one of the interesting thing we have been seeing is that a lot of the people actually the good new cool kind of assets, are first trading on DeFi before they even get to the CFI.
00:03:10.626 - 00:03:55.590, Speaker A: So for those djens who are looking for the newest assets, the newest meme coins, the newest things going on, you do see that they need to trade on DeFi before you get to CFI. Because honestly, if you wait until a token is listed on Coinbase, there's a very good likelihood that all the people who bought in DeFi are going to dump on you. The one when you get listed on centralized exchange. And this just have the example of Wif. But that's one of many tokens that you can see that the trading was very strong before CFI, and market price, like price movement, was positive when it was traded on DeFi only. And then when it came to CFI, you can see price went down a little bit. Sometimes it keeps going up, but still, if you want the newer assets, you'd have to start trading them when they get listed on Dexs way before the centralized exchanges.
00:03:55.590 - 00:04:29.442, Speaker A: And obviously there's counterparty risk, right? Like, we all know what happened last few years. We've all seen FTX, Celsius and others, billions lost, funds misappropriated. It's not that DeFI is without risk, but at least it's not that kind of risk. It's different risks. And you could hedge them, I think, better in DFI than you could in CFI. So what's preventing from everything being on chain? One thing is user experience. Like, user experience is still lagging behind again.
00:04:29.442 - 00:04:46.614, Speaker A: I've been in this industry for, since 2015. That's almost nine years now. Everybody's talking about like next year they're going to figure out this. The whole UIux thing is going to be amazing. Still bad. You still need your metamask. You open it, you still most like web based and not like mobile based.
00:04:46.614 - 00:05:16.206, Speaker A: Oh, it's getting better. So still the on chain user experience in DeFi is worse than on CFI. We have seen a lot of improvements. There's a bunch of other protocols working on account abstractions, and DeFi wallets and stuff like this. It's getting better. One specific project we like a lot in this space is tone we've been building on, as I mentioned, and that's because we think Telegram is emerging as kind of the prime venue for web three. A lot of the web three activities are going on on Telegram.
00:05:16.206 - 00:06:05.262, Speaker A: Most people I'm meeting here in the conference are primarily using telegram. And we've seen Unibot and Metro and a lot of other protocols using telegram as the main kind of interface. And Telegram itself has vouched on a chain, it's called Ton as their exclusive chain that they're using. And they have a telegram wallet integrated within the telegram messenger. I'm not sure if this functionality is specifically open in the US, I think maybe it's not. But everywhere else in the world you can get it. But essentially you have an integrated decentralized wallet, non custodial wallet within your Telegram app, and you can integrate with ton and other assets and interesting dapps, all integrated telegram web apps.
00:06:05.262 - 00:07:03.330, Speaker A: So we think this is a very good stride in terms of ux for user kind of experience integrating with crypto and blockchain. So specifically this is one project we've been heavily building on. We're doing a bunch of stuff on ton, we're the biggest RPC, we're the tool to mint new tokens, we're the biggest governance platform. But this is one kind of thing that we think could help progress adoption of on chain activity. And the other thing I think is even more material than just UX is prices are generally worse. Know we've discussed some products are first rated on DeFi and then get to CFI. But once projects are on DeFi and C Fi, usually you would get a better price and you would get better execution on CFI order book based exchanges as compared to Amms.
00:07:03.330 - 00:07:49.886, Speaker A: And yes, and on chain prices are not competitive. And the reason they're not competitive is because just liquidity fragmentation. Liquidity is highly fragmented across different chains, across different Amms on the same chain and across different pools within the same amm. And what happens effectively is the DeXs, at least on the UI level, cannot compete with the aggregators. Most users will go to like one inch paraswap one of these guys when they want to swap. Because the price you would get on an ammui is just not competitive. And one interesting case study we've seen is we've seen with Uniswap X that was launched in the summer, is now operational and growing in volume.
00:07:49.886 - 00:08:23.310, Speaker A: Is where essentially you have uniswap. That's the biggest, obviously biggest AmM in the ecosystem. First Amm, probably first AmM bunker would not agree, but first big amm, they essentially integrated an aggregator into their own UI. So today, any swap that comes in into Uniswap, they check against other liquidity sources, market makers. And potentially they would route it not through their amm at all. So this was kind of a first stride we saw of an amm coming, saying we can't really compete with the aggregators. So we're going to become an aggregator ourselves.
00:08:23.310 - 00:09:03.846, Speaker A: And on that kind of basis we came with liquidity hub. Liquidity hub is a project that we built, built on top of the orbs network. And essentially it is kind of similar to uniswap in the idea is we tap into external liquidity from within a Dexui and I'll explain. So right now you have a user. I have a couple of our partners here listed Thina and know a user comes into quickswap, for example, on polygon, they want to swap. So the way it was Today, they just interact directly with the pools on that specific AMM using whatever router you used to have, like a v two router. Then you had the most advanced, more advanced, like v three routers.
00:09:03.846 - 00:09:38.306, Speaker A: And now a lot of the projects are using somebody else to do the routing, like Paraswap or Openocean or Odos. But still you're limited to that liquidity. What we do with liquidity hub is we check against outsourced liquidity. So every time a swap comes into quickswap, for example, today liquidity hub checks against outsourced liquidity. We see whether we can provide a better price as compared to the AMN price. And if we do get a better price, then it's being routed through that external liquidity. And there we have different types of liquidity.
00:09:38.306 - 00:10:05.710, Speaker A: We have on chain solvers. So paraswap, Odos, Openocean, kyber, wrango, Bebop, all these guys are acting as solvers. And we have market makers. We have manifold as market maker, we have JC as market maker. We're integrating new market makers as we speak. But potentially with that we can improve price. And right now we are improving price for something like 30% of the trades coming into the MM UI.
00:10:05.710 - 00:10:51.376, Speaker A: And obviously this creates a place for Dexes to monetize as well. Because once there's user saving, you can take fees and those fees can go one to the AMM team. I'm not sure if people here know, but AMM is something that's very hard to monetize. So it's money for the AMM teams, it's money for you can do additional rewards for lps to incentivize liquidity for your pools. And obviously this is revenue generating for the ORS protocol as well. And this is just a slide kind of showing the potential, the price you can get, which just typing into the better the liquidity, the more the TVL, the better price you can give to users. And then you see, if I do just quicksoft themselves, I have 125,000,000.
00:10:51.376 - 00:11:30.296, Speaker A: If I expand to the entire polygon chain, like polygon Pos chain, I can get 950,000,000. Once I expand to all of onchain TVL, with cross chain solvers, et cetera, I can get like 60 billion. And if I have off chain solving, like with market makers who are solving against finance or OKX or Coinbase, I can get 600 billion worth of liquidity. So the more liquidity, the better the price you can get. And that's essentially what we're doing with liquidity hub, is tapping into that additional liquidity, just going back to what Orbs is. So obviously this kind of thing does require. So we do use a dutch auction model, and a lot of the action is done on chain.
00:11:30.296 - 00:12:13.752, Speaker A: No assets are being transferred to the Orbs or anything. But we do have a bit of a compute coming in here, doing all this kind of comparisons and integrating the amms, et cetera. And all of this is being executed on the orbs layer. So going back to where we started from is really trying to find the best product fit for our layer, for our technology. We do believe this is it with liquidity Hub and providing our decentralized backend to power, essentially the auction for liquidity hub and do the execution. And yeah, we do believe that yesterday people were like competing over TVL. Everything that Dex says we're trying to achieve, or DeFi Bros was trying to achieve, is TVL.
00:12:13.752 - 00:12:34.904, Speaker A: We do believe now volume is king. I think in this kind of bull market, we'll see projects competing over volume and revenue way before TBL. Because TVL is something that. It's a good street cred and it's nice to be high up on Defi llama. But end of the day, it's very hard to monetize. So we do believe receive volume as king in this cycle. And yeah, we do work with a bunch of dexs.
00:12:34.904 - 00:13:05.084, Speaker A: Somehow some of the logos didn't load here, but we work with a bunch of deXs. Using TWAP, limit liquidity, hub and some of the other products. We offer many chains, many projects here. We and spot is just the start for us. We are looking at additional places where our technology could be implemented. And one of the places we've identified as interesting is on chain derivatives. On chain derivatives is quite small still.
00:13:05.084 - 00:13:24.224, Speaker A: We all know a couple of big projects. Everybody knows GMX and DyDX. They're doing like order book based derivatives, but they're still quite small. And also they're not super capital efficient in the way they operate. That's one of the reasons they're not growing more than they are now. But on CFI, derivatives is very big. Like binance derivative is very big.
00:13:24.224 - 00:14:11.776, Speaker A: Okay, ex derivative is very big. If in spot we see like around 20% of the volume is spot, volume happens on chain, then it's not even 2% of the futures volume. And this is a place where we think that if we can get more liquidity from CFI into DFI in terms of derivatives, we can get much better execution on chain. And people don't have to go to centralized exchanges for this. And for this reason, we've partnered with a project called CMIO. I'm not sure if you know them, CMIO are doing intent based execution for derivatives. Essentially it's an RFQ based system and not an order book system.
00:14:11.776 - 00:14:47.564, Speaker A: But users can go on chain open interest, open a trade, and then you have hedgers who are taking the other side of the trade and they hedge that against CiFi based on RFQ. CME was the engine for it. And right now they have two UI integration. One is the on BNB and the other is intentx, which is now on base. And I think on launching on blast soon. I'm not sure if I'm supposed to say that, but that's also something that's very interesting for us. So we have invested in all three of these companies and are now building one.
00:14:47.564 - 00:15:19.736, Speaker A: We're building a decentralized hedger to hedge open interest from between on chain and off chain. And then we're going to collaborate with them on building essentially the biding system for hedgers to compete over open interest that's open by users. And this is something, if we can scale this, right. I think we have massive volumes as people are very interested in trading derivatives as we are seeing in CFI. Yeah. So thank you for having me. Super happy to talk about what we're building.
00:15:19.736 - 00:16:11.800, Speaker A: I think this is a very exciting cycle, interesting cycle. I think we're going to see way more things happening in DeFi as compared to before, even more than Defi. Summer. All the new chains coming up, all the new protocols coming up and think it's a privilege to still be here for this cycle and building and. Yeah, looking forward. Thank you. All right, thank you, Rand, do you want to do questions? Any questions? For questions? Anyone? Hi, real quick, what centralized exchanges have you partnered with? Sorry? What centralized exchanges have you partnered with? So it depends on the product.
00:16:11.800 - 00:16:45.328, Speaker A: For liquidity hub specifically, we're agnostic. So it depends on what the market makers are using. I think most of them are using binance right now, but they can use whatever, maybe coinbase as well, but we're agnostic. There's like a dutch trade, that's a dutch auction model. So wherever they can source a better price, they can participate. They can also do it with their own liquidity had they wanted to. But, yeah, I think most of them now have binance for futures, specifically in Sims current model, because futures are non fungible, you have different type of futures in every venue.
00:16:45.328 - 00:17:09.300, Speaker A: So specifically, the hedging is against binance. With this product the way it is today, potentially that could be improved in future versions. You have multiple counterparties for the hedging. Anyone else? Questions? Cool, thank you. All right, thanks, ran.
