00:00:00.250 - 00:00:36.610, Speaker A: Jasper. Okay. Hello everybody. We want to thank East Denver first for the invitation to come speak here. I'm Jesper, I'm with panoptic and we're super excited to talk to you about the derivatives infrastructure for the frontier of DFI. So in 20 minutes, my expectation is that your understanding of how to best do derivative in DeFi will have changed. In fact, let's just start by discussing the four pillars that are necessary for a healthy financial ecosystem.
00:00:36.610 - 00:01:04.414, Speaker A: So this would obviously apply to DeFi as well. We have fixed income, which can give you stable, predictable yields. So bonds and notes would be examples. Then we have equities that can represent ownership and, you know, Tesla, Coinbase, et cetera. And then futures where you can make directional trades. You can use it to do simple hedging. And they're capital efficient.
00:01:04.414 - 00:01:51.280, Speaker A: So this provides an important pillar as well. So examples are commodities, oil, SP 500 index, and then finally and most, maybe, I don't know, one of the most impactful things for sure is options, right? So with options, they're a little bit of a meta pillar, like bigger than the other pillars in the sense that you can actually build options on all the previous pillars we talked about and thus increase the capital efficiency. So they're even more capital efficient. You can do even more complex hedging and of course risk diversification. So you can bet on things like the VIX, but also volatility basically. And you can also, again, as mentioned, build options on top of the preexisting pillars. So it's very important to have.
00:01:51.280 - 00:02:42.138, Speaker A: And if we look at options in crypto right now, we're in a little bit of a tough spot, I would say, when it comes to know the majority of options are traded on centralized exchanges. So in particular, derivative, only very few offerings are available. So bitcoin, ethereum, maybe you can find Salana. And the volume, if you look at it, is only about 3% of the spot volume, which is completely opposite than in the tratfi market. And we don't really see a reason for this, right. It shouldn't really be like this. It should be technically bigger or comparable to the spot market, right? So we currently can only take out a tiny sliver of the total market, only a few coins, et cetera.
00:02:42.138 - 00:03:43.842, Speaker A: So the question is why? Why is that happening? So we believe there are two big reasons for this. So one is the technical challenge of bringing options to a decentralized financial ecosystem. It's a blockchain. Skuomorphic approaches don't really work. You can't build these option chains as easily, liquidity, fragmentation, and in fact expanding on that, just generally liquidity, like fragmented or not, we just need liquidity to get started to actually buy and sell options. So at panoptic, we basically identified this problem, right? This is the key problem is liquidity, and we have come up with a solution, right? So what we're going to do is we're going to unlock the existing $4 billion sitting in this ecosystem. And essentially, if you think of basically what Uniswap did to equities, we will do to options in the DeFi space.
00:03:43.842 - 00:04:20.030, Speaker A: Okay? So it's going to look and feel a bit different, but it's going to work much better and natively with Defi, we're also going to, by doing this, expand the ecosystem because we're going to get more actors and TVL on board. We're going to be permissionless modular as well. So we'll see that. Okay, so how do we get to this liquidity? Where is it? Well, where is all the liquidity on Ethereum mainnet right now? Most of it is certainly in uniswap. Right. So we're going to go to a centralized exchange on the network Uniswap here. We're just showing example.
00:04:20.030 - 00:04:55.366, Speaker A: USDC ETH has a ton of liquidity. They're representing these LP positions as NFTs, ERC 721s, non fungible position manager. The NFPM handles this as a side note. So how do we expand this ecosystem? So what I've plotted here is the Uniswap pool at the bottom. So we're thinking about this kind of a stack we're composably building on top of the existing pillars. Right? So you see Uniswap lps come in and they can provide liquidity to uniswap. Just normal Univ.
00:04:55.366 - 00:05:11.102, Speaker A: Three lps. Okay. That creates deeper pools and better pricing for us. We'll get into how later. But you also have a whole new section of folks who want to just trade options. They would not be Univ. Three lps, but they want to trade options.
00:05:11.102 - 00:05:30.386, Speaker A: So they're at the top there. And then basically you can have existing Univ. Three lps that just want better risk reward profiles. And we'll see how by actually redeploying through us. So they'll take Univ. Three lps, will take their liquidity, move to us, and we'll kind of redeploy into Uniswap. So in this way, we're symbiotic.
00:05:30.386 - 00:06:02.994, Speaker A: Uniswap grows, we grow, we grow, they grow. It's all kind of building together. That's how we get that liquidity. But how does panoptic work? So panoptic works by, again, we got this Uniswap V three pool. Anyone can create permissionlessly a panoptic pool on any token you want that's supported in Uniswap. So even long tail assets go ahead and create the pool. We are going to represent positions, option positions, as an ERC 1155.
00:06:02.994 - 00:06:51.626, Speaker A: So it's like a semifungible position manager and it basically is much more gas efficient than representing everything as like ERC 721 nfts. We're going to just, on a technical note, represent basically the token id in the yearc 1155 will be an encoded version of what the option is that you're buying or selling. Okay. So we can actually encode that, represent that as a token id and then the amount or like the balance of that token id will be how much you bought. Again, the liquidity providers will enter the panoptic pool. This can again happen through basically these kind of two main ways. So one is directly just lps that want to do options, or we can have existing Univ.
00:06:51.626 - 00:07:27.690, Speaker A: Three lps reenter through us. So how do you sell an option? The way that it happens on the back end is that you move liquidity from the panoptic pool to the univ three pool. Just the act of doing this actually means you're selling an option. Buying an option is equally easy. You just take the liquidity that the seller put there and you move it from the univ. Three pool back to the panoptic pool that is buying an option. We'll see an example now, but there's also going to be a premium.
00:07:27.690 - 00:08:20.614, Speaker A: So normally you might build in the premium by using an oracle and you can kind of check the price of the market and then kind of do like a streaming kind of thing. We are going to not be using an oracle. We're Oracle S. We're going to use a novel streaming pricing model we came up with, which basically prices the option based on the trading activity in Uniswap or in this decentralized exchange itself. So the trading that happens, shown to the right will actually convert into an option price. So depending on what that activity looks like, you'll kind of see in this plot to the left that there's a gray bar kind of in the middle of the plot that represents the strike time is on the x axis. And if the price hovers around your strike, like the option you have created the price will be high if it takes off and does not really touch that strike zone.
00:08:20.614 - 00:09:16.176, Speaker A: Again, it'll be a low cost, but it'll be the premium of the option at the end of the day. We're also going to ensure at all times the health of our protocol. So we're going to implement state of the art decentralized liquidation networks to make sure that the health of all buyers and sellers is there so you can create options on leverage. You deposit some collateral that will be drawn down if the position moves against you, but you'll then get liquidated, and if not, great, you'll profit. All right, so you can actually get more details at docs Panoptic XyZ. You'll also see this diagram in full, but let's actually do an example now. So we're going to buy a long put by just moving liquidity between panoptic and uniswap and we'll see how it works.
00:09:16.176 - 00:09:42.600, Speaker A: So a long put has this payoff profile. There's a strike price. The payoff curve is flat after that, and it kind of goes up before that in a linear fashion. Okay, so how's it done to the right? I've shown you a seller with some deployed liquidity. Now, kind of plotted on top of the Uniswap pool. This is liquidity deployed from the panoptic pool. This blue region there, we're ignoring the existing uniswap liquidity.
00:09:42.600 - 00:10:11.900, Speaker A: Okay, so that's the seller's liquidity. The buyer now comes along and says, I actually want to buy this long put. Let's say the price of ETH is 2500 USDC. So what's going to happen is the buyer will take a chunk of liquidity. That's this little, tiny little blue box to the left. They took that out, they carved that out from the seller's liquidity and moved it over to panoptic. So in other words, they borrowed the LP tokens from the seller.
00:10:11.900 - 00:10:40.504, Speaker A: And what they're going to do is they're going to burn that and convert it to USDC. So now they're holding USDC, 2500 USDC. All right. And that's the current price. All right, so how do we do this? First, let's just get a little bit of intuition about what happens to the payoff for the buyer as the price changes. Okay, so I've plotted the payoff curve in the middle from before. I've marked two points on that.
00:10:40.504 - 00:11:11.408, Speaker A: So one is price one and the other is price two. We can start with, I guess, price two, right? Now, because that's on the right. So price two, it's some price. Whatever it is could be 2500. And the payoff curve from the buyer will be on this flat curve. Why is it flat? Because the position in Uniswap, from the seller's perspective is 100% USDC. Okay? Because the price is above this chunk, this carved out chunk.
00:11:11.408 - 00:11:31.912, Speaker A: That's just how Uniswap works. That has nothing to do with panoptic. If you deploy a range in Uniswap, it's either 100% one token or 100% the other token on either side of this range. Okay? So it's right now it's 100% USDC. So the buyer holds 2500 USDC. The buyer owes the seller 2500 usdcs. The profit is zero.
00:11:31.912 - 00:11:51.664, Speaker A: There's no profit right now. They can just deliver that back. They can just create the lp tokens again, give it back to the seller, and everything's good. So that is true for any price above this strike price. It doesn't matter how high the price of ETH is. It doesn't matter because the seller's position is 100% USDC. Cool.
00:11:51.664 - 00:12:22.696, Speaker A: So that's what creates the flat part. How do we get to the linear part that increases with decreasing price in ETH as the price now goes below the strike? Again, I've marked two points, price two and price one. If we start from price two, what happens is the price is now so low. It's very low. But importantly, it has crossed the strike price. And thus, the seller's position is 100% eth now. Okay? And this is showing on the left graph there, it's 100% eth.
00:12:22.696 - 00:12:42.460, Speaker A: It should say that on the right graph too. But they're both 100% eth. The point is that the buyer now owes the seller one eth. So it kind of flipped. Before they owed them the USDC because the price is below the strike. Now they owe them one eth. So as the price keeps going lower, the buyer is still holding the 2500 USDC.
00:12:42.460 - 00:13:12.648, Speaker A: Okay? Nothing changed with that, but the cost of ETh just keeps dipping. But also, they now suddenly owe the seller in ETH, not in USDC. So the buyer is super happy now because the price has gone below the strike. They're holding on to 2500 USDC. Let's say the price is 1000 USDC for one ETH. Okay? How can the buyer close their position? How can they exercise their option now? Well, they can just go to this market where it cost 1000. That's the pool itself.
00:13:12.648 - 00:13:36.224, Speaker A: They just swap one eth. Okay, that's going to cost them 1000 USDC. That's the price. Well, okay, but they had 2500 USDC. So they just are left over with one 5000 hundred USDC and that's it. They just deliver to the seller one ETH, okay? And they just keep 1500 USDC in profit. Buyer made a profit, sellers made whole, everybody's happy.
00:13:36.224 - 00:14:07.708, Speaker A: Okay? That's how it works. We can extend this and we can go way beyond just buying a put. We can do whatever we want just by realizing that these small liquidity chunks, we can just deposit an arbitrary amount of those in panoptic. We support up to four legs basically in this position. So we can do things like Jade Lissard, Super Bowls, whatever you want. We're expanding now to the entire market, to any token you want. And we're also expanding the number of options that you can use.
00:14:07.708 - 00:14:31.860, Speaker A: So to the right there, we actually kind of codified these options into like emojis. So the first is a put, the second is a call, right, that's a telephone and so on. So we actually are publishing more details about these things on our Twitter account. So this is our Twitter. In the middle, we publish under the hashtag research bytes. So we give some information about how to actually deploy these positions. So on.
00:14:31.860 - 00:14:51.032, Speaker A: And later on when we launch, we'll actually do it on panoptic. When you can. You can also check out our blog at block Panoptic XYZ. This is our roadmap. And I just want to highlight a few things. One is that we just successfully completed our APDK review. We are starting our open Zeppelin review.
00:14:51.032 - 00:15:14.630, Speaker A: That's going to be our second audit. So we're going to start that audit in a few weeks. And then we're going to launch on testnet in a few months. It'll probably be May and then mainnet later this year, early fall. And that will bring options to the entire defi industry. Okay. So I actually wanted to show you a demo of the product.
00:15:14.630 - 00:15:30.630, Speaker A: So let's just start from scratch here. All right, great. So here I am. Actually, this is going to be the first live demo of panoptic ever. Here I am in our current very early version of panoptic. Okay. I show up on the website.
00:15:30.630 - 00:15:50.392, Speaker A: A lot will change from this point till we actually launch. But anyway, I'm show up on the website. I'm kind of locked out right now. It says connect your wallet to view your positions. I'm going to do that. And here I am, I'm connected in the top left. I can see an overview of all of my current positions, just in terms of my buying power, my collateral, et cetera.
00:15:50.392 - 00:16:23.428, Speaker A: I can see my combined PNL graph to the top right. And then I can actually go and scan my individual positions and I can even when we get there, click on them and get more details on each position. And I can make changes to know typically you want to be more active in your option positions and kind of roll these positions. So I can do that. Let's try to create a new position in panoptic. So here I can basically pick my numerair. So in this case I picked dai, I can pick my asset eth.
00:16:23.428 - 00:16:47.072, Speaker A: I can choose the number of contracts that I want here. One, I can pick a scale which is just related to the width of the deployed liquidity in uniswap. So you can kind of like change that. And then I have a fee tier as well. Once I pick these, this is going to toggle to checked up here. These were already pre filled for me, but I'm going to say continue. Great.
00:16:47.072 - 00:17:09.220, Speaker A: I'm now in the die eth pool, in a 30 bit pool. Now I'm going to pick a strategy. So I'm going to pick from some templates here and we have a few templates that will show you some bullish strategies. I can pick some neutral and some bearish. Right now I'm super bullish. So I'm going to pick a long call. Maybe I should do a bearish.
00:17:09.220 - 00:17:24.180, Speaker A: That's kind of opposite. Anyway, so then now I'm going to do this. This is a long put. This was the one we actually just talked about. So I picked this and I can add Lex here. This is kind of just a template I can start from. I can add Lex, I can modify my existing Lex.
00:17:24.180 - 00:17:47.356, Speaker A: So you see to the right it kind of lights up and it also lights up on the left. It lights up and also on the right. So I can kind of see which lec I'm talking out. I can add another leg. So there you go, another leg pops up and I can keep doing that. I can also delete them again. And importantly, what we had to do for panoptic here is we really wanted for this graph to be very customizable, this payoff curve.
00:17:47.356 - 00:18:19.612, Speaker A: So you can come in and you can create whatever payoff curve you want. So what we had to do was create a very, I would say like a very advanced bare metal Javascript library to actually be able to do that. So I'm going to show you that now. So if you go here to the right. You can actually interact with this graph, and it's extremely expansive and interactive. So I can say no, I actually want my payoff curve to be more like this. I want to add a leg now, and I want it to look like this so I can do whatever I want and whatever it ends up being.
00:18:19.612 - 00:18:42.180, Speaker A: That's what I get. That's the payoff curve I get. So I can stick with the template or I can just do my own thing over time. You can imagine even we talked about this a little bit before these gamma transforms, so you can create potentially arbitrary greeks as well. We're working on that. Anyway, point is, I've created my position now. I'm happy with this.
00:18:42.180 - 00:19:03.150, Speaker A: I'm now going to click submit and I'm going to be presented with a receipt for this position. And I can kind of see the details of what I've just created, and then I can go ahead and click mint. Right now. It's not hooked up. I'm running this in localhost, but you'll be able to. And that's it. So that's how it'll work.
00:19:03.150 - 00:19:29.412, Speaker A: All right, so the team building this, we have Guillaume, the CEO. I'm there as well, helping with operations. And then the rest of the team, we have Brandon, Dr. C, Henry and Susan, who are doing a fantastic job making this a reality. And yeah, I just want to thank you. To the left here, you can see some links to where to go seek more information. So there's a link to our website.
00:19:29.412 - 00:20:02.360, Speaker A: We have our twitter, we have our subdomains there, our discord. Please join, ask your questions. And yeah, correct me if I'm wrong, but I really feel like I've changed your opinion about how derivatives will be done in defi by tapping into this existing liquidity. But yeah, seek me out. I'll be at the conference. We're super happy to get connected and talk with you, but yeah, thank you for your time. It maybe we'll take some questions.
00:20:02.360 - 00:20:19.660, Speaker A: All right, I think there are a few questions. We're also hosting an event. You can see that on the screen, by the way, March 2, that was really cool.
00:20:19.730 - 00:20:34.684, Speaker B: Two quick questions. Is the seller, in your example, being compensated for the missed LP fees or something like this? And also, let's just say in your example, how is the seller found or how is the seller paired?
00:20:34.812 - 00:20:35.488, Speaker A: Right.
00:20:35.654 - 00:20:45.840, Speaker B: You're having someone pull out from sort of a seller's LP position. So where is that LP position coming from? And also, are their fees made up for in addition to the Premium?
00:20:46.000 - 00:21:36.388, Speaker A: Yes. So there are two questions. So one is, where does the kind of, I guess, the seller liquidity come from? And where does the buyer basically go and find that liquidity in the first place? And then also, how is the seller compensated for the missed LP fees that they would have earned if they had just deployed directly in uniswap? Okay, so the liquidity comes from. So panoptic lps will deploy liquidity into the panoptic pool. The seller will have to deploy a little bit of liquidity themselves to create this collateral, but they can do it on leverage. So they can use a little bit of their own capital, a little bit of the existing capital in the pool, and then they can deploy this position, they can sell their option, and basically, that gets deployed in uniswap. So that's where the liquidity, from the buyer's perspective, come from, these sold options.
00:21:36.388 - 00:22:19.356, Speaker A: So we have to sell before we can buy. And yes, the way that the seller gets compensated for the LP fees is actually through this streaming pricing model. So everything they would have earned in uniswap, they'll still earn here, and they'll get compensated a little bit more on top of that, actually. So we actually believe that just kind of based on the market demand. So the point is, they'll actually get more reward than they would have in pure uniswap. So that's why we're saying we believe we'll be able to bring a better risk reward profile to the participants of panoptic, but also, just because we're expanding the markets, like, you know, put calls, anything, you're not just stuck with one particular position you can ever create, which is what uniswap does. Right? So that's what we're hoping.
00:22:19.356 - 00:22:21.410, Speaker A: So anyway, I hope that. Okay, cool.
00:22:30.030 - 00:22:57.620, Speaker C: So, usually, pricing options is an absolute nightmare, both computationally as well as consistently, whenever you have quality data. So how are you structuring options pricing and making sure that, one is reliable, and then two, that you have the data integrity you need in order to consistently, basically create a market?
00:22:58.390 - 00:23:53.806, Speaker A: Yeah. So the question is, well, a statement first was that pricing options is like a nightmare normally, right, you have your black shoals and math to do it. But for panoptic, how do we basically do that? How do we price the option, essentially, and make sure it's like high quality data, et cetera? So, again, the data to price the model does not come from an oracle or essentially any data source per se. It just comes from the natural trading activity that actually happens in the underlying decentralized exchange. So just the swapping activity itself creates these price curves that you see on the left. We've drawn three different price curves that is basically just showing you the individual swaps, at least, because each swap changes the price a little bit. So all of this is just kind of shown.
00:23:53.806 - 00:24:39.298, Speaker A: So all those swaps are creating those price paths and those price paths in turn, depending on how they touch the strike. So your range will make the option premium high or low. So we've kind of shown what we're seeing there on the far right in that subset graph is like, fee can be 0% of black shoals. It can also be more than black shoals, like four or 500% or like maybe on par with black shoals. So we don't need to worry about whether kind of the pricing gets computed correctly. We are all inheriting that from, in this case, uniswap, automatically. So not only do we get their liquidity for free, so to speak, right, we also get the pricing of our options for free.
00:24:39.298 - 00:25:00.100, Speaker A: So it's all just natively built on top of this existing pillar. We're building another pillar and expanding it. So there's nothing sku morphic or kind of discontinuous about this. We're just integrating into the existing ecosystem. So we really believe that's a powerful idea to get this liquidity. All right, my time is up now with the great questions. Thank you.
