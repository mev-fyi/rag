00:00:00.090 - 00:00:48.874, Speaker A: All you cool cats and kittens, come on in and sit down if you're coming for our talk. Rights and royalties management and web3, I am Genevieve fierce with entertainment. You can see us back here. We are a collaborative storytelling platform on the Ethereum chain. We're really excited to sell tickets for creators into the making of their work. So with our interactive tickets, you can do things like cast your NFT in an animated series as the best friend and name them and dress them and help figure out what their challenge is going to be. With our nfTs, you can get a live pep talk from a wrestler in Catalyst wrestling before they go in the ring to fight.
00:00:48.874 - 00:01:07.678, Speaker A: You can be an animated storytale character, a haunted portrait. So we're really excited to be here today, and what we want to talk about is rights and royalties management in web3. With me, I have the inestimable Josh Lawler of Zuber Lawler. Do you want to introduce yourself, Josh?
00:01:07.774 - 00:01:35.078, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks, Jen. So I'm Josh Lawler. I am a partner at the law firm Zuber Lawler, where I practice transactional law, m and a finance, a lot of technology transactions, intellectual property, and notably I spend a lot of time working in distributed ledger technology, blockchain, web3 nfts. And I'll be writing a book which hopefully releasing in q three, called surviving the migration, a legal guide to evolving your business using nfts.
00:01:35.254 - 00:02:38.782, Speaker A: So I feel like you really do want to write down Josh's book name because that metaverse book that just hit and really made a big splash. I feel like you've got a similar kind of flow here because everyone wants to know, how do I handle rights and royalties transfer, particularly rights transfer in the area of NFT. So the first thing I'll say is there is no way we are going to give the depth of knowledge that builders like you require in this talk. So we've written you a really in detail report. So if you scan this QR code, you will go to a 65 page report that will tell you everything you could ever want to know about rights and royalties transfer in web3, including a breakdown of the top 20 NFT collections and how some of them, like world of women, did it really right. And how some of them like doodles. Yuga are a little bit of a mess because they're dealing with some SEc stuff right now around it potentially being a security.
00:02:38.782 - 00:03:05.190, Speaker A: So, Josh, let's talk about that. Yuga Labs got hit recently with this idea that their nfts are a security. We have a lot of builders in the audience. When you're making an NFT collection or using an NFT collection or asking your users to use their nfts, what do you need to know about how to set that up on the back end to make sure this is done right and you don't have the sec on your tail?
00:03:05.530 - 00:03:58.620, Speaker B: Okay, that was like a full law school course question in general, not to comment on Yuga labs specifically, I haven't deep dived that. But what I can comment on is the decision that came out of southern District of New York with respect to NBA, topshot and dapper Labs. And it's a really super important and illustrative decision because what they identified correctly is that an NFT that is for an art, a collectible, or really anything else can also be a security if it is sold the wrong way and messaging counts. So in that particular case, dapper Labs was saying, oh, these are basketball moments. But by the way, emojis for money bags, rocket going to the moon and like a big financial chart going up, up. And the court said, yeah, well, there's definitely enough facts there to support the idea that you might have been selling an investment. And so that case will continue to go on.
00:03:58.620 - 00:04:00.570, Speaker B: That's a great illustration.
00:04:01.150 - 00:04:21.886, Speaker A: Yeah. And we've actually also had like a royalties kerfuffle happening right now. We just came out of NFT Paris last. Like, all anyone could talk about was blur and Opensea and about that to really, you seemed like you saw real value in the blur approach, right?
00:04:22.068 - 00:04:48.338, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, I mean, the secondary sale royalty needs to be preserved. That's a fundamental, original kind of tenet of web3 and creator protection. And historically there's something called the first sale doctrine that comes out of copyright. It's north of 100 years old. And the idea is that if I write a book and you buy the book, that copy of the book is yours and you can now sell it to whoever you want. And I don't get another thing from it.
00:04:48.338 - 00:05:17.406, Speaker B: I get a sale on one copy. NFTs change that because we've got this kind of technical way to work around the first sale doctrine by wiring in a secondary sale royalty as part of a smart contract and that allows creators to continually earn funds off of their works, whatever it might be. And it's a revolutionary concept and we want to protect that and make sure that you can't have a workaround.
00:05:17.598 - 00:05:45.290, Speaker A: Yeah. And I don't want to put you on the spot here. I forgot to ask you if I could ask you this beforehand, but of all the NFT collections that are out there, who has done it? Really? Like if somebody has not done it right, what have they done? What's the mistake that you really need to avoid in this area when building out your NFT collection or your platform for nfts like ours?
00:05:45.710 - 00:05:50.300, Speaker B: Sure. Well, I'm not going to speak ill of anyone. Thank you very much.
00:05:51.230 - 00:05:52.346, Speaker A: No trash talk?
00:05:52.448 - 00:06:34.150, Speaker B: No, there's no trash talk. But what I will say is a few examples of things that maybe you don't want to do. Recognize your terms and conditions are a contract. So if you're an NFT project and you are telling the people who are purchasing the NFTs that they have commercial exploitation rights of some type, then you can't subsequently decide that everything needs to go to collective commons. And no, just kidding, that's a breach of contract. So we won't say who did that, but somebody did that and that was not a great thing to do. Another area that we need to kind of think about is that giving people commercial rights to an NFT is not really all that easy because it isn't copyright.
00:06:34.150 - 00:07:01.170, Speaker B: Copyright, when it was created isn't designed to protect things like name, image and likeness is really what you see with athletes, their personal rights. But there's no personal rights in a board ape. So there's a real issue from a legal perspective as to whether any of those assignments are actually legal in the first place. And we're wrestling with that right now. We'll need legislation of some type. Right now. There's like an implied license concept, but it's very, very messy.
00:07:01.170 - 00:07:03.458, Speaker B: But that's the story.
00:07:03.544 - 00:07:26.182, Speaker A: Well, the implied license. So we've talked through this. Josh and I are going to take this show on the road because everybody wants to know what's going on in this area. But the implied license comes from the fact that it's theoretically not. Nothing in the NFT space has theoretically yet been legal based on the lack of a signature. Is that correct? Can you talk about that for a minute?
00:07:26.246 - 00:08:02.360, Speaker B: Oh, sure. So, I mean, the copyright is a little funky and that's coming out. In order to sell something that is a copyright or to exclusively license it, you need to actually have a written document and it needs to be executed as Jen is. You know, from the NFT perspective, that's just not how, you know, if you go into Opensea, there is no signature. And in fact, you may not even know who you're buying or selling to, which is its own kind of set of issues. So those copyrights don't necessarily move, legally speaking, but at the same time, I don't think anybody's arguing that the rights didn't transfer over.
00:08:02.810 - 00:08:39.314, Speaker A: Yeah, and let's throw it to the audience now, because I really want to hear a little more about what you all are working on. Who here has a platform? Who's the platform builders? Okay. And who here is more of an NFT enthusiast? Right. Show of hands. Who would like to be able to take your NFT and jam it in the middle of a graphic novel with a whole bunch of other NFTs and have a lot of fun, like where it's an avatar or a character, you want to use it, right? We want to use our NFT. It's like an avatar. It's something that represents us.
00:08:39.314 - 00:09:21.418, Speaker A: So at entertainment, one of the things that we've been struggling with since the beginning is how do we do this without triggering the securities law? So if you check out entertainment, which scott the. We're a very 2.5 play. We're trying to bring people into web3. You'll see that our base level model is very similar to like a Netflix meets openc meets Kickstarter. So you'll see that we have tv shows, and we are helping those tv shows sell tickets into the making of the show our creators raise in USTC and Ethereum. But what's interesting is we're about to start on Twitter spaces, a series of co collaboration parties, and you can bring your NFT.
00:09:21.418 - 00:09:57.370, Speaker A: And what you're going to be doing is in 90 minutes with our partner, Macroverse, you're going to be putting together an episode of an episode being two pages. You're going to put together a short cartoon, which is a mashup of twelve nfTs. And this is like a $50 ticket. This isn't much. Right. So would you pay $50 to bring your NFT, put it in a cartoon with a bunch of other fun characters, and then be able to split the revenues on a compendium graphic novel published? Yes, you probably would. But on our back end, that's actually kind of a nightmare.
00:09:57.370 - 00:10:06.990, Speaker A: So Josh and I were talking through, what does this require exactly? And it requires quite a bit. So talk us through some of the stuff we were talking about before this. What would this require?
00:10:07.810 - 00:10:42.822, Speaker B: The funny thing is that, legally speaking, it's a heck of a lot harder to give money to people than it is to get money from them. So there are two principal areas that really are problematic from the NFT royalties distribution perspective. One of them is tax, the other one is currency control, Homeland Security, patriot act, those types of things. From a tax perspective, you've got reporting issues. So generally speaking, if you're paying somebody, you have to give them a 1090. You need to have their tax id information. None of that stuff typically comes with an NFT.
00:10:42.822 - 00:11:41.370, Speaker B: And obviously, if you are talking about the first person that you issue the NFT to, fine, great, you might have that information as part of the sale process, but when they transfer it to somebody else, kind of good luck. And then the other area, if they happen to transfer it to somebody who's in North Korea or Iran or Somalia, you can't make those payments, even if you don't know that that's where they're going. So there's two areas that we really focus on there, and the solution to that, or at least the one that we've been working with our clients on, is semi centralized. There's no real way around it, which is know the money flows into your central entity and you basically keep accounts for each NFT. And when somebody wants to cash out, if you will, there's a two factor off. You have to have the NFT. So it's token gated and you have to provide your tax information if you're in the United States or wherever else you might be, because there's certainly international tax laws that come into play as well.
00:11:41.370 - 00:11:51.358, Speaker B: And this can be really massive kind of undertaking, which thankfully, I believe will be automated in the relatively near future. So somebody's got to be building a tool for that, I certainly hope.
00:11:51.524 - 00:12:21.386, Speaker A: Yeah, I feel like we don't have the answer yet. We're testing this now, but we will have it next year. We'll be back on the stage next year having figured this one out, and we'll be on to the next challenge. But, Josh, we're getting the signal. We're almost done. When we were talking earlier about this, we were prepping for another talk with diffuse ventures in Chicago. One of the things you said was it was so interesting.
00:12:21.386 - 00:12:55.922, Speaker A: From the dawn of time, there's always been a ledger. Somebody has always, in the cave, counted up the beans and fruits and berries from the forest and the amount of bears that you killed that week and had a centralized ledger. And really, although it sounds very grand, I don't want to make this bigger than it is, but it really is that problem. The fact that decentralization really clashes in a very bad way with rights and royalties. It can be cleaned up, which we're doing right now. But it's quite complex, isn't it?
00:12:56.056 - 00:13:45.250, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, I mean, as Jen was mean we're really dealing with a paradigm shift that goes back pretty much as far as you can go back in terms of decentralization and a ledger where the information is open and immutable and everybody can see it. And then you can build on top of that the NFT paradigm, which is really kind of amazing when you think of it. You have this little snippet of software code that comes off of an execution off of a smart contract that everybody can see and that can represent absolutely anything or any part of anything and have several different use cases at the same time. That's insanity. And you package that with the fact that it travels at extremely high velocity across borders, and you realize that that's just contradictory to the whole idea of geographic sovereign boundaries and sovereignty. So yeah, it's a mess.
00:13:45.250 - 00:14:02.678, Speaker B: And we're going to have to kind of work through that in a nice, peaceable way to make sure that the powers that be are able to see it and maintain really sovereign rights. That's really what we're talking about. And part of that is taxation. Part of that is rights management.
00:14:02.854 - 00:14:50.762, Speaker A: Well, in the meantime, if anyone's interested, how we're going to be using KYC procedures with distributed NFTs, I mean, that's the headache that we're dealing with right now. But the thing is, once a process is made here, once we crack this code, which we've been working for a year on, I do think we're onto something where it's possible to build like this, but not be considered a security. You'll notice if and when you can go to entertainmentmint.com that we actually have a very 2.5 process. We've used paper XYZ and Magic IO, so that it's really easy to sign up on the site. You can use your email, you can buy with a credit card, but I feel like that's translating through to our rights processes as well.
00:14:50.762 - 00:15:34.870, Speaker A: So we're using the simplest tools out there because you have control over who's a speaker in Twitter spaces, and you can have up to 13 speakers in a Twitter space at any given time. You can sell that like a ticket. So once you sell that like a ticket, it becomes a co creation ticket. We consider ourselves both an IP marketplace and a ticketing platform, which I think a lot of us in NFTs realize now that's what they are, they're tickets. But there's a lot of power in what they will clean up with rights and royalty transfer. Somebody earlier today was asking me like, whatever rights and royalties, what do they have to do with nfts, really, from a CEO perspective, I've been doing this for 20 years. My first marketplace was sittercity.com.
00:15:34.870 - 00:16:13.746, Speaker A: I am totally aware we serve 10 million users. I'm totally aware of how many departments need how much amounts of money to do X, Y and Z and X, Y and Z things. Being able to remove the legal and accounting around rights is insanely valuable. It might not seem like a big deal to anyone, it's like a builder, but when you're staring at it from a cost perspective, it's absolutely massive. So I know we're down to 1 minute. Josh, talk to us about just what's your takeaway? What's your leave behind other than everyone? This 65 page report. I mean, it's really awesome.
00:16:13.746 - 00:16:30.774, Speaker A: Go get this report that we've written for you about not only the evolution of the web free space with entertainment, but about rights and royalties. So please click through to this. It's quite valuable. We would never be able to get it all in 20 minutes. But what's your takeaway for everyone here that's just looking at this area?
00:16:30.972 - 00:17:05.910, Speaker B: The world is changing very fast, and it's great to see everybody here because obviously we're all at the forefront in it. We all believe in it. We're in something of a hearts and minds phase right now with the general population, and you'll hear a lot of people talking about things like ease of use and mainstream adoption. That stuff is super important because we can make a lot of positive changes in much more serious areas, much more kind of governing and infrastructure, types of places that could help a lot of people. And in my personal opinion, the first step to it is really entertainment.
00:17:07.290 - 00:17:20.742, Speaker A: Well, thank you. We think so, too. So that's our talk. Please get the report. Josh Lawler with Zuber Lawler. Genevieve fears at entertainment. Follow us on Twitter at Entertainment Co.
