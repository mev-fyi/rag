00:00:00.890 - 00:01:06.370, Speaker A: So FinCEn has actually issued a proposal just this October trying to address what they think is a serious issue that comes from mixers. However, the government has always misapprehends how the underlying technology works, and they resulted with a proposal that would encompass day to day transactions on the blockchain, including think, for example, single use wallets, compartmentalization that was talked on the stage before any type of pulling of funds. And I think one of the solutions that the industry is proposing, and the government is, of course, completely oblivious to, is privacy pools. Can you guys talk a little bit about how privacy pools would kind of ease the tension between the ethos of blockchain and privacy and anonymity and regulatory concerns that have to do with bad actors using blockchain and its ethos to perpetrate financial crimes?
00:01:07.590 - 00:02:15.590, Speaker B: Yeah, I think there's a history of governments being confused about new encryption technology dating back to when they tried to ban HTTPs and then later mandated HTTPs to be used on all government websites. I don't think this is going to be much different than that because they know that they can't secure all of our data, and so there's dangers to having these giant data honeypots. And it doesn't make sense that on a blockchain I would be forced to. Nobody puts their venmo on public, right? We all make fun of people who do that, so there's no reason why I should have to do that on a blockchain. And so I think that if we can accomplish the goals of the regulators, which is that they don't want legitimate users who are depositing their funds to be associated with illicit funds, then there might be a way to get the best of both worlds, where you get privacy for the legitimate users, but helping isolate the illicit funds.
00:02:16.970 - 00:02:31.690, Speaker C: Yeah, and privacy is a human right. Your bank account isn't public by default. You should have the right to share what data you'd like to share with the world. That should be optional.
00:02:33.650 - 00:03:16.460, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think one of the arguments that are now being heard in DC and are so infuriating is that suddenly, because you're a blockchain user, you don't have any of your constitutional rights anymore. You live in the US, and suddenly you're supposed to be disclosing every part of your transactions and every part of your day to day life. Despite that, even within the community, when the privacy pool paper came out, you guys did face a little bit of criticism from supporters of more anarchist views, I would say. Why do you think that is? And how do you address that.
00:03:17.070 - 00:04:16.910, Speaker B: I think part of the reason is because they don't want to update their systems to incorporate new ways of allowing users to have more sovereignty over their own privacy, like privacy pools lets you do. So. For example, I don't want to associate with the funds from a hacker who hacked my friend's DFI protocol, but if I don't have the option of dissociating publicly, then I'm sort of forced into that. And so I think that there's some natural tension there, because maybe they think, oh, well, it's better for the world if everybody's forced into associating with everybody. And I don't really agree. I think, given the preference, I would choose to not associate with the terrorists or IRGC or people who hack my friends or what have you. And that just requires building a slightly better compliance system into these privacy tools.
00:04:18.530 - 00:04:36.900, Speaker A: And at the same time, privacy pools are designed in a way that essentially you opposed any type of disclosure to centralized authority. Correct. Still, you would have safeguards that wouldn't allow a government now or 100 years from now or nine months from now to be able to exploit that data.
00:04:37.670 - 00:05:15.060, Speaker B: Yeah. So the way the privacy pool's smart contract and protocol is designed is that it doesn't have any sort of centralized access or admin keys or preferences for specific governments. So it doesn't collect any of this information. You basically decide as a user, who are the other deposits that I'm willing to associate with and not if the services that provide those lists collect data, you're choosing to use those services. It's not necessarily one group that's getting all of the data.
00:05:15.990 - 00:05:32.406, Speaker A: And I think one of the most interesting aspects of these systems is the way that they promote scalability of DeFi, and they also promote practical aspects of how this could be used and how they could promote broader use. Zach, you want to tell us a little bit about that?
00:05:32.508 - 00:06:13.620, Speaker C: Yeah. So I think in order to scale Defi and kind of bring it to a broader market that's outside of just like retail and degens and everybody here, we need to provide a better atmosphere for institutions like hedge funds, banks, any organization that needs to follow particular guidelines to participate in a healthy way. So what privacy pools does is it essentially allows those who are participating in these liquidity pools to know for certain that they're not commingling assets, who they're participating with. And I think that's going to be a pretty big thing for this next wave in the market.
00:06:15.110 - 00:06:33.978, Speaker A: And do you see that there is also, or there could be an intersection between blockchain and tradfi, that, for example, a traditional bank could use privacy pools. Yes. It would be a very different type of privacy pool, would be limited to their customers, but it could still be used by them and protect privacy even more.
00:06:34.144 - 00:06:54.610, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. I think that all of traditional finance is going to be on Ethereum within the next five to ten years, and I think we're building towards that. I look at the ETF now, so what's it going to look like in the next five years? I think that we need systems like this in place in order to create that atmosphere that enables that broader participation.
00:06:55.190 - 00:07:44.034, Speaker B: Yeah. And there's practical examples where it can be useful today. So when I withdraw from Kraken, for example, it says Kraken three to my address. Right. You can imagine a privacy pool amongst exchanges that would obfuscate which specific exchange I have a relationship with, so that somebody trying to get my data doesn't know who, which exchange to call up and bribe in order to get the information. Banks, especially banks in Switzerland, who have an enlightened view about privacy, unlike the american surveillance state bankers want to promote, know, they also want to participate in DeFi without revealing their competitive edge. So that's another use case for them where they just want that in order.
00:07:44.072 - 00:07:48.530, Speaker C: To scale up DeFi, or even more practically like payroll.
00:07:49.270 - 00:07:50.610, Speaker B: This is really the best one.
00:07:50.680 - 00:07:55.346, Speaker C: Yeah. Or sending my overlooked, sending my mistress some money.
00:07:55.528 - 00:07:57.380, Speaker B: I wouldn't know anything about that.
00:07:58.230 - 00:08:01.670, Speaker C: Not that I know. I don't know anything about that either. Love my wife.
00:08:04.010 - 00:08:41.810, Speaker A: Privacy. Privacy is the. It's. We're not going to judge on how someone uses it. And part of the issue with what Simpson is doing and the way government is still viewing AML and KYC procedures is that in the future, these are not going to work the way they work today. And we're looking into alternatives in how you can implement these procedures. And do you see privacy pools and similar systems or something like Oxpo is doing in being able to facilitate something that works more efficiently and taking into account these concerns?
00:08:42.630 - 00:09:26.606, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. Oxpo is our compliance solution for privacy pools, monitoring all of the deposits and providing a judgment on whether or not we think it's acceptable for them to join our association set, which would then be all of the users who withdraw and are part of that association set would be associating with. And so we're doing pretty rigorous wallet analysis that goes beyond KYC. And KYC is basically going to be broken in the next year. It's already getting broken. Like people are generating AI wallet ids and stuff, and it's not going to work as well. And even if you get past the KYC of the system, you still want to trace it back and be like, oh, actually, this does come from this Defi hack.
00:09:26.606 - 00:09:34.738, Speaker B: I don't care who you are. I care that your money isn't illicit. And so I think it's going to be even more important in the future.
00:09:34.824 - 00:09:53.290, Speaker C: Yes, I think this is going to kind of hopefully take the place of KYC to some extent. You don't really need to prove who you are. I don't need to know your name necessarily. I just need to know that you're not a sanctioned individual, you're not a North Korean, you're not some baddie out there that's trying to do something weird.
00:09:54.510 - 00:10:10.430, Speaker A: Yeah. Exclusion. What do you see as the weaknesses of privacy pools? Like, we have inclusion delays. You do need the intermediaries. What do you see as one of the creators as the gaps that you want to see filled in the future?
00:10:10.580 - 00:10:36.214, Speaker B: Sure. Our original privacy pools demo was a point and click, and so you'd see all of the other deposits. And you have to be like, I'm not this guy, not this guy, not this guy. And so that's not really a scalable solution for something like privacy pools to work at scale. It does require this data analytics role which can do the monitoring to make the list. Right. That's one maybe weakness of the system in the future.
00:10:36.214 - 00:11:14.340, Speaker B: It would be cool if everybody had access to their own personal monitoring systems that scaled, but I don't see that happening just yet. She mentioned the time delays. So one of the ways that privacy pool would be used is for when somebody deposits, they're not immediately added to the association set. There's a delay, we're thinking three days a week, hopefully less, but something like that to give us time to do the retroactive tracing of the funds and in order to make sure that the system doesn't allow illicit funds in.
00:11:17.050 - 00:11:31.674, Speaker A: And one of the issues that I think the paper touches upon, and I think everyone is interested in is how do you defend against malicious asp? And that's kind of built into the ethos of the system. You want to explain that a little.
00:11:31.712 - 00:12:10.130, Speaker B: Bit, like people improperly being rejected from the assistant. Yeah, I mean, ideally you don't want the CIA guy's girlfriend to be excluded because he hates her or something. And so you would want to have a system that has some internal checks and balances. Unfortunately, this isn't something that you can really make public because there's a lot of private information involved in the judgments. But having multiple stakeholders who have transparency into the decisions that are made around the judgments and for what reasons people are rejected and accepted would be helpful to mitigating any personal attacks.
00:12:10.290 - 00:12:30.620, Speaker C: You might be able to implement some sort of social consensus as well. If you're in enough association sets, you can essentially attest to your peers within that association set. And the more association sets you're in, that kind of adds some degree of hardness to the identity and associating that identity with one of the good guys or not being one of the bad guys.
00:12:32.110 - 00:12:39.550, Speaker A: Do you guys want to talk a little bit more about Oxbow, what you're working on now? How will this develop and what you're hoping to achieve?
00:12:40.130 - 00:13:18.570, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. Oxbow so right now, we're the first association set providers. So that's essentially vetting all of those lists and making sure that there aren't any addresses present within that association set that are sanctioned entities or hackers. Just general bad guys, people that are exploiting things within the system that we're aware of. So that might extend to additional tooling that allows other users to create their own association sets. For now, we're just an information provider, but we plan on scaling and doing a lot more stuff within the privacy stack.
00:13:21.230 - 00:13:58.278, Speaker A: And I think you mentioned that you have been trying to work with the regulators, educate the government on how this will work. I will emphasize that this is critical. We were in DC yesterday meeting with different senate staff, and the ignorance is just enraging. One of the questions that the Warren staff asked was, well, there is no way to combat mixers. So we need the report of every single transaction, which you don't have with bucks, by the way, as you just said. So I think it's really important. Have you seen any progress when you're talking to them? Do you see that there is actually like a way to work with them?
00:13:58.364 - 00:14:33.954, Speaker B: Yeah, I think something people should realize is that something like privacy pools on one single access is actually the best thing on the planet. You can't go into a bank today and withdraw from the bank and publicly prove that you're not the illicit deposits that went into the bank. You can't do that with Coinbase. You can't do that with any other system ever, except something like privacy pools. Obviously, it doesn't do everything else a bank does, but on that one axis it's better. And so I think coming from the position of teaching them about the new compliance opportunities is helpful because they think every mixer is the same. I hate using that word.
00:14:33.954 - 00:14:38.226, Speaker B: But you have to educate them. It's not even really a mixer.
00:14:38.258 - 00:14:38.406, Speaker A: Right?
00:14:38.428 - 00:14:40.920, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't think it's even a mixer, really? Yeah.
00:14:41.370 - 00:15:19.694, Speaker B: And so they've been receptive. It's not super evenly distributed. Who's receptive? Right. There's swiss central bankers who I believe are uniquely enlightened because one of them proposed that privacy from the central bank itself for the users should be a feature that benefits the users. That's not something you'll hear very often in America, but I think that that helps legitimize privacy as a useful thing. Right. They're concerned about honeypots.
00:15:19.694 - 00:15:57.994, Speaker B: They don't want to have to deal with all the data. They get hacked, they reveal all the stuff that's a security threat. So for them, it's much better if they have ways of preserving people's privacy. And how do you do that? Well, you use the same zero knowledge proof systems that we've been building and iterating on. And so when I went to the Basel university with Fabian and presented the stuff, they were very interested. He's been continuing to educate them. I went to a regulatory conference in Philadelphia where I presented the privacy pools paper to, I don't know, CFTC, FinCEn, SEC, DOJ people, and that was also helpful.
00:15:57.994 - 00:16:47.710, Speaker B: Obviously, they have concerns, but we're still being able to make some progress on educating them about the opportunities for compliance. And it's important because we didn't even really know this stuff was possible, right? So it was only after the tornado cash sanctions that we tried to figure out this problem of how do we publicly dissociate from these illicit funds and realize that there is this compliance opportunity. And the reason that we went moved so fast to try and write this paper with Fabian about it was because he was providing recommendations to the regulators about what the law should be around privacy. And so we thought it was very important that they all understand what the total playing field of compliance opportunities are before they make all of the laws.
00:16:48.450 - 00:17:40.080, Speaker A: And I think it's really important, I can't emphasize that enough to change the regulator's perspective of the industry. And most of the times we talk to them and we're trying to say, we want to be regulated, we want to be compliant. You guys are not even trying to work with us. And perspectives like this one and proposals like this one shows that the industry wants to exclude bad actors and is actually actively trying to find solutions rather than say, oh, everyone in the industry is the same. We never want to comply with the laws. We don't care if we work with North Korea, which is fundamentally untrue and it's being used by politicians and certain regulators in order to pay in the industry a certain way to promote their own financial interests and their own political interests. So I think what you're doing, both of you, is incredibly important.
00:17:40.080 - 00:17:45.138, Speaker A: If you have any final thoughts on privacy pools or anything else you'd like.
00:17:45.304 - 00:17:56.454, Speaker C: One way I'm kind of thinking about it is like SSL for money markets, and that's kind of like a pretty simple explanation. I don't know.
00:17:56.572 - 00:18:01.766, Speaker B: Yeah. SSL, which was banned by the government and then mandated to be used, and.
00:18:01.788 - 00:18:03.746, Speaker C: That'S what enables online banking.
00:18:03.858 - 00:18:04.520, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:18:05.610 - 00:18:09.480, Speaker C: What's the next generation going to look like? I think it's going to look a lot like this.
00:18:09.930 - 00:18:16.280, Speaker B: Yeah. Check out privacypools.com and Oxpo IO, spelled with a zero x.
00:18:17.290 - 00:18:19.560, Speaker A: Okay. Let's see what will be next year.
00:18:20.290 - 00:18:22.800, Speaker C: Yeah, we'll talk about it here next year.
00:18:23.570 - 00:18:24.974, Speaker B: Hopefully you all join us.
00:18:25.092 - 00:18:25.500, Speaker C: Thank you.
