00:09:14.720 - 00:09:15.580, Speaker A: Kingdom.
00:09:28.320 - 00:09:45.204, Speaker B: Welcome to your Saturday evening D five discussion where we're going to talk about a little thing called the future. Joining me today are five of the world experts on DFI. I'm going to let each of them introduce themselves, starting with you, yo, over there. Sure.
00:09:45.242 - 00:10:13.084, Speaker C: My name is Yosef Kwan. I've been in the crypto space since 2010, mining bitcoin and building stuff. And I'm currently working on a project called Dojo Network, which is a decentralized data commerce platform, trying to make it easier for those who are experts at extracting data from places like blockchains that are very difficult to do that, to bring it to a network and be able to monetize and sell that data.
00:10:13.202 - 00:10:23.760, Speaker B: Well, you also, of course, have built at one point what was the largest smart contract auditing firm in the world and also sold another security company. So you could talk about some of the deficiencies we might have in Defi.
00:10:24.500 - 00:10:25.948, Speaker C: Sorry, deficiencies?
00:10:26.124 - 00:10:27.650, Speaker B: There might be one or two.
00:10:29.300 - 00:11:01.448, Speaker C: Let's see. All right. Yeah, so there was coinsetter, which was one of the first us based bitcoin exchanges. I co founded that and that was acquired by mean. We were just very early on and we had to really deal with a lot of legal and problems and stuff that other people hadn't really figured out yet. And so that was really difficult. And Posho was one of the very first smart contract security analysis firms.
00:11:01.448 - 00:11:10.110, Speaker C: We protected billions of dollars in digital assets and a lot of the smart contracts are obviously still live and being used today.
00:11:10.880 - 00:11:22.688, Speaker B: So let's dig into that a little bit more very soon. Yo. But I just want to make sure that people know you have the basis to talk about that. So Greg, you have been funding the revolution for a number of years now. Tell us a little bit about what you do at XPTo Humla.
00:11:22.784 - 00:12:01.040, Speaker A: Yeah, so XPTO Humla's funds, we've been investing in the crypto space now since 2016 17. I think we have maybe 49 investments in the space, a lot of it around financial markets, infrastructure like derebit, paradigm trading, Credora, also the various platforms that everybody uses. We were early in synthetics, we were early in a couple other ones. We continue to invest in the kind of like emerging opportunities related to the infrastructure. So mostly defi infrastructure stuff.
00:12:01.110 - 00:12:02.476, Speaker B: Excellent. Lamesh.
00:12:02.668 - 00:12:31.588, Speaker D: Hi, everyone. This is Lomesh. I am the vp of growth at the definitive foundation. So we are a layer one blockchain called the Internet Computer Protocol. I lead all of the developer partnerships as well as ecosystem building. Yeah, so I've been in the crypto space since 2016. Prior to this, I was working with a startup called Abra as a part of my role.
00:12:31.588 - 00:12:42.264, Speaker D: We essentially have a lot of Defi entrepreneurs that are building on our chain, leveraging some of the cross chain capabilities that our chain offers.
00:12:42.312 - 00:12:47.480, Speaker B: And we should definitely dig into interoperability a little bit, because this is about the future. And tell us about your role, Matt at Hadera.
00:12:47.560 - 00:13:07.860, Speaker E: Sure. Thank you. I'm Matt Woodwood, the head of developer relations at Swirls Labs. For Hadera, I've been a full stack developer for over 20 years. I've run my own businesses, run my own startups. I'm now looking after the developer ecosystem for Hadera to try and bring more developers over into our network. I cross paths regularly with developers most days in terms of building out in terms of the Defi space.
00:13:07.860 - 00:13:10.340, Speaker E: I look forward to contributing what I can to this talk.
00:13:10.490 - 00:13:11.792, Speaker B: Excellent. And Brandon?
00:13:11.936 - 00:13:23.210, Speaker F: Yeah, I'm Brandon Neal, COO of Euler Labs. Euler is one of the permissionless borrowing lending markets on Ethereum now. Happy to be here.
00:13:23.580 - 00:14:01.344, Speaker B: So let's get straight into it. I think we can say that pretty safely, that in 2022, trust was lost in centralized finance, at least it was in crypto. We saw, of course, the FTX disaster. We saw lending platforms like Blockfly, like Celsius Meltdown. We saw centralized hedge funds that perhaps some of their trading partners we should go into that didn't understand the counterparty risk, like three arrows capital meltdown. And it has caused all sorts of millions in the industry. I guess I've been muted.
00:14:01.344 - 00:14:07.210, Speaker B: Okay, let me ask you this, yo, what can DFI do about that?
00:14:09.820 - 00:15:26.464, Speaker C: A massive amount. DFI is kind of the beginnings of what the dream that all the crypto nerds have been talking about for the past, like, you know, ten plus years start to come to fruition of these decentralized systems that don't rely on these centralized entities, that are completely trustless, that can provide comparable services, like financial services that people traditionally had to go through, banking institutions, or centralized entities where you needed a trusted counterparty. And if you can take all that away and put it into a decentralized compute system with smart contracts where you don't have to trust anyone, it just makes the system, the future looks pretty bright, I think, with Defi. And even though right now there's kind of like a besmirchment that's happened with all the issues that you just highlighted, I think once people kind of get past that and the more applications and real world use cases that come online for initially financial services and eventually other things, the better it'll be for everyone.
00:15:26.502 - 00:15:49.028, Speaker B: Well, so we're going to talk about some of those. So, Greg, you've been investing in things like synthetics. I think synthetics is actually a really good thing to talk about, just because at the very least, it provides a snapshot of what the future could behold. So why don't you tell us a little bit about what that is and kind of what your philosophy as an investor has been in putting money in some of these platforms early on. Close your face.
00:15:49.114 - 00:16:56.136, Speaker A: I think early on we started investing in things that were a bit more speculative. I think now I think it's critical to think about the year that we're in. Things are changing quite dramatically right now, especially because the US is coming in so hard on enforcement, on regulation. It's really, like you said, like Joe said, I think it's both kind of like dark time for crypto in general, but it's also a time where you're starting to see massive opportunities and massive amount of innovation happen. Synthetics was early, but I think now we're seeing a lot more stuff, especially with DK roll ups, stuff the ability to have multi chain tokens and be able to actually, I think what we're seeing now is we're moving towards much more sophisticated dexes. And then even in centralized exchanges, you're going to have the ability to do self custody, so you'll have a centralized exchange. I actually know of two that are launching this within the next four months, where you'll have your own wallet connected to the exchange.
00:16:56.136 - 00:16:59.436, Speaker A: You'll keep all of your tokens, so.
00:16:59.458 - 00:17:01.120, Speaker B: It feels like a hybrid exchange.
00:17:01.780 - 00:17:11.040, Speaker A: I mean, the exchange will still have centralized trading, but they won't hold custody of your tokens. And that's going to add a whole nother level when DeFi starts to approach that as well.
00:17:11.190 - 00:17:28.730, Speaker B: Well, maybe we should zoom out a bit, perhaps. Brandon, you used to work at this thing called the Federal Reserve, so tell us kind of what you see are, well, maybe opportunities that may come. Let's take the macro view of kind of where things were before Defi, so we can kind of figure out where DeFi is going to go down the.
00:17:30.700 - 00:18:09.600, Speaker F: So, having worked at the Fed and being pretty intimately involved with the financial plumbing, it hasn't changed much over the past 100 years. There are too many intermediaries, too many intermediaries, and too few key intermediaries in the legacy financial system. So what that means is if you trade to clear and settle a treasury security between a little old lady who would need to buy the treasury security and the Treasury Department. There could be ten different intermediaries, each of whom take a little cut, a middleman who take a cut, and who evolve to do so for a particular reason. It's really understandable why they evolved that way. But now it's akin to a vista tale, if you will. Defi can disintermediate.
00:18:09.600 - 00:18:26.308, Speaker F: And so I think stepping back, disintermediation is one of the core. It's the key, key unlock that Defi does. And it's actually, to your first question, it's partly why everybody got in trouble last year was there were a lot of intermediated crypto parties out there and.
00:18:26.334 - 00:18:46.160, Speaker B: What was the specific risk? Look, I think we hear way too often at conferences like this that decentralization is the goal. But why? I mean, I want to ask that kind of axiomatic question, what is the actual upside of decentralization? I mean, you mentioned a lot of intermediaries. Do those make us safer?
00:18:47.060 - 00:19:11.640, Speaker F: So for the key intermediaries, no. And I like to use the analogy of an aging power plant that serves the town. There's a long transmission line. There's this one antiquated power plant versus some sort of distributed grid like solar and wind power that everybody can plug into and sort of gain the benefits. And there's resiliency built in that's like inherent to decentralization.
00:19:12.140 - 00:19:35.570, Speaker B: So Hedera has an incredibly decentralized kind of DAG protocol, and it has a lot of centralized, big players on your governance board. As you've been talking to developers and about explaining why they should be building on Hedera, what have you told them? Especially ones that are trying to build decentralized finance applications. What have you told them as the power that Hadera has?
00:19:36.020 - 00:20:31.260, Speaker E: Okay, so there's probably a few things around the list that I can touch on. First of all, you mentioned about centralization, and I think everybody's got a different definition of what decentralization is on Hadera, yes, we have some very big brands, some Fortune 500 companies that are represented on our governance council that decide essentially what choices are being made on the direction of the network, for example, lower down at the actual technology level for developers. There's some capability there that really talks to having fairness in the equation when we're talking about things like DeFi, reducing the risk for front running those kind of capabilities. So as they're building on our platform, they have access to something that, yes, is massively scalable with high performance, yes, is lower energy that type of thing, too. But I think ultimately all technologies are going to head in that direction sooner or later anyway. But it's really the fairness to do with our consensus algorithm that's really going to come into play. So once people come into this industry, once DeFi starts growing, we have more people in the mix.
00:20:31.260 - 00:20:50.890, Speaker E: We're going to really want to see fair transactions as part of the equation as people are operating in this space. And it's really that that I keep feeding back to developers to make sure that as they're building their systems out, they're understanding that what our platform gives them is that insurance that as customers are coming to use what they're building, they're actually going to have a fair experience on that platform.
00:20:51.420 - 00:21:13.388, Speaker B: But I mean, of course developers are always looking for choice and there's a lot of different ways to skin the cat and still arrive at that sort of decentralization at ICP. There's kind of a really interesting kind of full technology stack in a container that's been built. What types of unique DFI applications are you seeing prosper already on ICP and kind of where are things trending?
00:21:13.564 - 00:21:51.804, Speaker D: Yeah. So I think one of the first things that we should think about is the question that you just asked is like, what happened in 2022? Right? Let's just take a deeper dive. The reason why everything start to fall apart was essentially we started relying on central parties, assuming it was crypto, but it was not, and we learned it the hard way. So if you think about the current DeFi stack on how even the protocols are built, there's only a part of the application which is still built in a decentralization stack. But if you look at all of the bridges, all of the oracles, there's a central party involved somewhere. We still haven't reached to a point.
00:21:51.842 - 00:22:04.540, Speaker B: Where I want to double down on that. So you're saying that today DeFi still has some hyper centralized touch points potentially, I don't know, places where there could be disaster.
00:22:04.620 - 00:22:38.888, Speaker D: Oh, absolutely. Look at the basically billions of dollars in hacks that happen every year on just the bridges alone. Right. So bridges is nothing, but you essentially have a central intermediary. That's like telling you that, trust me, I'm going to take your bitcoin and I'm going to create a wrapped version of it and kind of give you for all of this defi playing. Right, but that is where the real bottleneck is. So what we need to think about is how can we solve this mathematically, right? How can we create a protocol which has a formal proof that you can essentially solve this problem without relying on a central intermediary.
00:22:38.888 - 00:22:43.176, Speaker D: And that's what essentially, we at the Internet computer are trying to solve.
00:22:43.288 - 00:22:51.730, Speaker B: You'd say that this is one of the primary things where you're kind of pushing developers within your ecosystem to solve some of these. I'm going to call them the bridge problem.
00:22:52.500 - 00:23:35.016, Speaker D: Correct. So I think in our world, what we think about is it's going to be a cross chain world. There will be assets that need to move from one chain to another. People want to trade between, like, people want to earn yield on bitcoin or all the assets they have. They will absolutely need a mechanism to trade cross chain. So what we are trying to bring to the table is essentially, how do you do this natively, where you can use mathematics, cryptography, to essentially enable a real bitcoin, not a wrapped version of it, to be basically transferred over into the DeFi projects without any intermediary like the central.
00:23:35.208 - 00:24:06.360, Speaker B: Fascinating, Greg. One of the things specific to DeFi, as opposed to other potential applications on a decentralized network, is, of course, that you need to see liquidity. And one of the arguments, at least, that I've heard for why we need to have these really slick interoperable protocols is because we need to have enough liquidity for all sorts of exotic or, well, pretty boring applications. That happens well on DeFi. Are you investing in this space? What are you seeing that's interesting in terms of interoperability meets defi?
00:24:06.780 - 00:24:09.944, Speaker A: Are you saying interoperability between chains or between.
00:24:10.142 - 00:24:23.512, Speaker B: Well, typically it is between chains. It might be between chains or even between different platforms on the same chain, like we've seen within Ethereum, for example. The pooling of liquidity has allowed for there to be much better trading to exist.
00:24:23.576 - 00:25:16.392, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, the whole creation of DeFi as a pooling, staking system was the disenmiation of the old market, making ways where you'd always have a centralized market maker. It was like playing against the casino at the house, and we took all those fees and pushed them into the pools. I think now, with the way that the regulation is going stronger and stronger, offshore stuff is getting more and more sophisticated, and that's where they're starting. The ZK stuff is coming in. I think it's very interesting, but it is nice to see the evolution. We are looking for more companies that are integrating more security into the and more user experience. Those are the kind of two areas where I think there's a big need, where we're looking for investments.
00:25:16.536 - 00:25:22.210, Speaker B: Brandon, would you agree? Do you think that user experience is an actual problem in Defi or an opportunity?
00:25:22.740 - 00:25:27.730, Speaker F: Yeah, actually I was thinking about the future of Defi in particular.
00:25:29.140 - 00:25:30.130, Speaker B: Well, good.
00:25:30.820 - 00:25:32.256, Speaker A: You're in the right place.
00:25:32.438 - 00:26:02.876, Speaker F: So much, I feel, of what has been built so far, and this is not a criticism, but it's just more, I think, natural in Defi has mimicked or replicated parts that exist in the traditional financial system. Defi is sort of the interface now has been built for Wall street, not necessarily main street. I know that sounds cliche, but with the end user in mind, I think that's one place it can go. It's needlessly complex, and at the same time it serves a lot of functions, but it's just needlessly complex, I guess.
00:26:03.058 - 00:26:29.700, Speaker B: Well, let's talk a little bit about that problem set there, which is how do we get more retail people involved? You were talking a little bit about the reason why to you, Defi exists. This is backstage. You were saying that it's important for there to be a democratization of access to some of the financial instruments that before were only maybe accessible to the elite. Are we actually seeing that happen in d five? Because to me it sounds like it could be a hollow promise.
00:26:30.280 - 00:27:25.144, Speaker D: I think if you think about it. For example, let's take a simple Dex like Uniswap started this. What they are bringing to the table is anybody with, let's say, $5 worth of ETH and $5 worth of USDC can actually come to the table and say, I can be a market maker and I command a piece of this entire pie that historically only used to go to big banks and big market makers. So yes, there is democratization. I think the key that we need to still solve for as we are talking about the user experience is like, how do we bring the real mass adoption of basically millions of people who can just seamlessly interact with these protocols? And yes, I mean, the protocols do enable even today for this democratization. It's just that we need to really make it happen for millions of people.
00:27:25.342 - 00:27:46.188, Speaker B: Matt, we were also talking about kind of the prerequisite information that developers might need to have to build some of these next generation defi applications. I do wonder, not every developer necessarily worked at a bank before or worked at the Fed. How are you helping coach some of these developers today as they're building and pioneering brand new things?
00:27:46.354 - 00:28:25.816, Speaker E: Sure. So from the perspective of developers, everybody has their own unique experience as they come into that role. And like you said, some of them are not necessarily going to come at it from a financial background. They might be immensely talented developers, and that's great, but it's really important when you're building out something that does have the impact that Defi does, that you really know where to draw the line and where to stay in your lane with it. And I've always been a big believer in terms of having both that coupling of excellence in development capability, but also excellence in domain knowledge as well. So that's really where you should be aware of where to draw the line when you're building out some of these innovative products where you can kind of use perhaps some existing great standards that are out there that are available to you right now. Fine, use them.
00:28:25.816 - 00:28:35.644, Speaker E: That's good. But let's not pretend that suddenly we've become financial experts when we're doing that. We still need to have that domain expertise brought into the equation as they're building out those solutions, too.
00:28:35.682 - 00:29:09.096, Speaker B: So then let's talk exactly about that, Brandon. Again, coming from Wall street, we're actually about three blocks north. As I recall, you have seen before that brand new applications, or supposedly brand new applications have been come to DFI that are actually just facsimiles of mistakes of the past. The savings and loan crisis, of the financial crisis in the 2000s. What do you see are things that have been kind of replicated from the mistakes of the past in Wall street, in DFI. And where do you see kind of solutions to some of those problems?
00:29:09.278 - 00:29:46.100, Speaker F: Well, cynically, quite a lot has been replicated. But if it's any consolation, Wall street also repeats its own mistakes every ten to 15 years. So I guess it's like everything is all relative. Yeah. Nobody knows where the next crisis will come from, but I think the core ethos of DFI being transparent, eliminates at least the black box and the centralized risks, whereby nobody knows where certain risks do lie. Where there are hazards, like inherently, Defi solves a problem that traditional finance cannot solve.
00:29:47.160 - 00:30:07.992, Speaker B: One of the things, of course, we saw as a mechanism to adoption in the past were these for a lot of Defi protocols, overwhelmingly high initial Apys. It seemed like they wanted to go and get a few people really rich, perhaps at the expense of people down the road. Greg, how are you seeing model shift in tokenomics? In Defi?
00:30:08.136 - 00:31:18.816, Speaker A: I'm seeing what kind of shift models, tokenomics models shift. Well, I'm not sure I'm seeing the model shift in a revolutionary way right now. I think things are like the user interface is very like the UX we talked about earlier is very debilitating. And the innovation, although it's accelerating, it hasn't accelerated on that specific area yet. What I've been looking at in the space is future DeFi applications, which is as collateralization and as debt come onto the blockchain, and as stablecoins and cbdcs are used in a more robust way, we see a lot of real innovation. To go back to what Brandon was talking about, which is the evolution of Wall street stuff, I see that there's a step that people have missed because we come out here at eat Denver and in crypto, and we say we're going to revolutionize everything all at once, and we're going to change every single thing. And those are essentially become all ponzi pump and dump things.
00:31:18.816 - 00:31:42.056, Speaker A: Whereas a lot of the stuff that we've been successful on and that we're looking at more are things that take one step away from Wall street or one step up from pure DeFi towards this kind of center. And like, for instance, the digitizing of structured credit. It's not cool here, but structured credit is. We're talking all of credit is $100 trillion. The structured credit is maybe, what, 40?
00:31:42.158 - 00:31:44.616, Speaker B: There's not a huge credit business on.
00:31:44.638 - 00:32:19.296, Speaker A: Blockchain right now, and it's coming. And DFI was the first experiment where we could kind of like revolutionize that. And that's where you say, how are the models evolving? I think Defi's models are evolving evolutionarily wise. And then from the other side, we're seeing traditional models actually start to get peeled away from Wall street using AI tools, using digitization tools. We have a couple portfolio companies that are digitizing structured credit, and they're working on the institutional world, Goldman City, whatever, to make these kind of like walled garden blockchain, yo.
00:32:19.328 - 00:32:53.256, Speaker B: One of the problems with very early Defi, I mean, way before DeFi summer, was that the code was in some of these smart contracts, which is how these DeFi applications actually work. Usually it's a series of smart contracts, was flawed, however, so it seems. Well, hold on. I'm a casual consumer here, and it seems like more often than not, they work. As you say, some of the code that you've approved in the past is still being used. If that's, if that's not as big a problem today, what do you see are the security issues in defi?
00:32:53.448 - 00:33:57.604, Speaker C: I mean, there's so many security issues in defi, it's like, absolutely, I was wrong. It's absolutely crazy, but a lot of it. So when I'm looking at a defi project, and if I want to put money into it, I look at it from a cybersecurity perspective, and I analyze it from a bunch of different ways. And one of those ways I look at is kind of like inherited risk, right? It's like, okay, it's on this blockchain. You can only get the money onto that blockchain through this bridge. And how does that bridge work? And then even if you get the money on there, and what does that token even look like on the original chain, whether that's ethereum, like USDC, or one of these ERC twenty s and then ERC 20s themselves have fundamental problems with them because they were written for absolute efficiency, they were not made for user experience. And so that's why you have so many problems with wallets today and why it's so difficult for a lot of these wallet providers to create these understandable, trustworthy flows for users to be able to move money around.
00:33:57.604 - 00:34:41.696, Speaker C: It's because there's inherent problems with kind of like, these bad practices that we got into early on, some of which I think will eventually turn around. Like, kind of even what Lomesh was saying about, instead of it being like, oh, a wrapped coin, maybe eventually it'll be verifiably backed or decentralized keys or something will emerge, and then that kind of technology will move things forward. But as it stands today, I think security is better than it was and it keeps improving, but it's still bad. But it's bad on the Internet anyway. But you look at, like, DNS, which has obviously been around forever. DNS is absolutely mean. Sorry, I'm rambling, but no, I think.
00:34:41.718 - 00:34:53.960, Speaker B: You'Re going somewhere with this, which is simply to say that maybe I shouldn't trust defi. I mean, Brandon, why should I? If there are these huge holes, why should I be putting any of my USDC or my bitcoin in defi?
00:34:54.380 - 00:35:21.256, Speaker F: Well, I think there's this animal called a tardigrade, which has been around since prehistoric times, right? And it essentially can thrive next to sea vents at crazy temperatures on mountains pretty much everywhere. DeFI has been battle tested very much over the past year, and I think that that alone is a proof that speaks above any narrative that anything I could mean.
00:35:21.298 - 00:35:38.916, Speaker B: Well, I guess to your point, we have seen many billions of dollars flow from some of those centralized entities, Matt, to DFI over the last year or so. But where are things going to go from here? What do you see are the kind of killer applications for 2023 in DFI big talk.
00:35:39.018 - 00:36:27.936, Speaker E: Okay. It's going to be really interesting, to be honest with you, because I kind of see, as we were talking through some of those responses before, I think there's going to be a big shift towards the way that networks are being interoperable with one another in terms of when those transactions for different currencies are coming cross chain. I'd really love to see that moving from being kind of like bitcoin on one chain to a wrapped bitcoin on another. There should really be a shift towards that, kind of being something we can burn and mint and have kind of proper interoperability between the chains, full stop. So I kind of see a shift that could move towards that and then giving us more of a liquidity mesh rather than liquidity pools on each network. I think there's really a fascinating opportunity here as we move forward as well, as we more tokenize different assets as we move forward as well. We've seen a lot of on chain kind of currencies, and we've talked about stablecoins and CDBCs.
00:36:27.936 - 00:36:48.232, Speaker E: What happens as we move forward? And perhaps we want to start tokenizing some of the different aspects of wealth that aren't represented on chain at the moment. We can only see a fraction of that right now. So I'm quite interested to see how that might play out in terms of bringing some of those different liquidity into the market and perhaps what that might look like for some of the applications. So I think we'll see a bit more of that coming into play.
00:36:48.286 - 00:36:54.844, Speaker B: Well, I've got to then bring Brandon in. What do you guys think about real world assets on chain? Do you think there exists a future.
00:36:54.882 - 00:37:39.772, Speaker F: For that in DeFi things like mortgages, like real estate? No. Time soon. Like not anywhere in the near future. I think the more likely near term future would be digital native crypto adjacent folks like YouTube influencers, onlyfans, producers, people that are, in many cases, people are unbanked also, who could put their asset on a blockchain or at least maybe get royalties. If you think about some of these people, they essentially have a big platform tech company between them and the revenues, they have a revenue stream. Revenue stream could have a net present value. Net present value can be borrowed, traded, borrowed against, things like that.
00:37:39.826 - 00:37:47.144, Speaker B: So essentially the financialization of, well, almost everything, starting with things that are adjacent enough or more purely digital?
00:37:47.272 - 00:37:50.556, Speaker F: I think so, yeah. It just seems like other things are too far.
00:37:50.658 - 00:37:52.864, Speaker B: You've got to jump in here. Greg, what do you think?
00:37:53.062 - 00:38:23.368, Speaker A: I disagree. I don't mean I think I kind of always go back to the only things that I've seen that have been, like, real killer apps are things that are financial related. I'm sure everything will end up DeFi or crypto ish in the future. Maybe. But the next steps, I think, are going to be even more financial adjacent solutions. It'd be nice to see more institutionals start to adopt some of this kind of defi type stuff. But I'll go back to real world.
00:38:23.368 - 00:38:31.592, Speaker A: That's naturally ending up on crypto. Should be collateralization, lending and credit. That's massive.
00:38:31.656 - 00:38:35.020, Speaker B: What do you think about real world collateral for DeFi?
00:38:37.200 - 00:39:20.348, Speaker D: I think it's going to take a lot of time before that happens, because, again, you are trusting a central party to take the collateral and then essentially give you a replica of that on chain. Right. So it is inherently more trust. What my view of DeFi is like, I think of this as a sandbox for experimentation. Since the Internet came early or late 90s, every industry has gone through a transformation except for traditional finance and financial services. DFI is just basically creating a ground for experimentation, and I think it's only limited by human creativity. It will only start initially with things that they can completely play with and eventually start to eat every aspect of the world like the Internet has.
00:39:20.434 - 00:39:27.160, Speaker B: Well, I would say just one thing. I don't think it's limited by human creativity now that we've got AI. Well, thank you, panelists.
00:39:27.240 - 00:39:28.780, Speaker A: This has been fantastic.
00:39:31.360 - 00:39:35.420, Speaker B: And I guess I ended perfectly on time. Thanks, everyone.
00:39:35.570 - 00:39:37.150, Speaker A: Thank you. Okay.
