00:03:47.370 - 00:03:47.998, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah.
00:03:48.084 - 00:04:03.630, Speaker B: Hello, everybody. How are we doing? There we go. Good. Look alive. Fantastic. We are in day 672 of East Denver. This feels like an eternity.
00:04:03.630 - 00:04:39.230, Speaker B: I really got to appreciate the fact that you guys are here, that you've made it today. I hope the parties have been great and hope that you are up for a excellent hot seat panel. So maybe I should introduce what the concept of the hot seat is about. So, my name is Lansky, Paul Lansky, and I'm a member@d.org. D.org is a services Dao, basically a dev shop that is natively a Dao. The first Dao ever registered as an LLC.
00:04:39.230 - 00:05:23.994, Speaker B: And we have an all hands meeting where our members, mostly technical members, get to grill some of our guests in our. And we call that the Diorc hot seat. So the Diorg hot seat is definitely a place for spicy questions. This is not going to be a complacent panel. This is going to be a panel where they're looking at me like, no, actually, this is not really true. I'm actually very nice, but I'm hoping that you won't. I do have a reputation, and I want to do business with these guys at some point in my life, but if you don't, it is the time for you to ask the spicy questions.
00:05:23.994 - 00:05:52.130, Speaker B: So I'm going to start with some questions that I'm going to ask to these people, and then I'm going to pass the mic to the public, and I'm hoping you guys will have very spicy questions. Does that sound good to you? Give me a. Yeah, give me a louder. Yeah. Fantastic. Okay, so we've introduced myself and Diorg and how the panel is going to go. It's a good time for the speakers to introduce themselves.
00:05:52.130 - 00:05:54.966, Speaker B: Maybe you can start from the opposite corner over there.
00:05:55.148 - 00:06:12.246, Speaker C: Thank you. Hello, everyone. My name is Gleb. I'm running marketing for one inch. I'm the CMO of the project, and I've been with the project for more than two years. And obviously, I'm from the decentralized finance side. But we, as a project, we are in the battle for centralized exchange users.
00:06:12.246 - 00:06:16.460, Speaker C: Right. So, yeah, that's, in short, about me. Thank you.
00:06:17.230 - 00:06:49.640, Speaker D: Hey, everyone. I'm Chris Hughes, former CEO of Ethrust, but chairman emeritus, I guess. I've been working at the intersection of traditional finance and crypto for the better part of the last four and a half years, figuring out how the on ramps for traditional finance, basically, how do we make dows compliant, how do we make fractionalized securities? How do we actually participate with the larger finance community writ large. So, yeah, I've been working very hard on it, and it's slow, but it's happening.
00:06:50.810 - 00:07:10.510, Speaker E: Everybody, I'm Matt Wright with consensus. I lead a lot of our Dow initiatives. We're looking to build out tools and infrastructure for dows in the ecosystem. Been in Ethereum since 2016, 2017, and, yeah, looking to explore decentralization in the ecosystem.
00:07:11.250 - 00:07:26.100, Speaker A: Hi, guys. My name is Diana. I'm the business development side of the BNB chain, the largest layer one out there. And I've been in crypto for the last four years and representing the Defi side as well.
00:07:27.430 - 00:07:39.270, Speaker B: Excellent. Okay, we got a good mix. We got people from tradfi, we got people from Defi. I think this is going to be an interesting panel.
00:07:40.090 - 00:07:43.400, Speaker D: Are those metamask institutional socks? That's awesome.
00:07:43.850 - 00:08:07.840, Speaker B: Nice. We got ogs. Definitely. We got ogs on stage. So I want to start with a question. 2022. 2022 was the year of the grifter, the year where all of the centralized exchanges, not all of them, but all of the centralized players, demonstrated the fact that trust.
00:08:07.840 - 00:08:10.814, Speaker B: You don't have to trust, you have to verify.
00:08:10.942 - 00:08:11.620, Speaker C: Right?
00:08:12.310 - 00:08:29.570, Speaker B: FTX, DCG, Gemini, Blockfi, 3 hours, capital celsius. How can we ever trust any centralized service ever again? And I think this question would be for Chris.
00:08:29.730 - 00:08:56.474, Speaker D: Okay, let's be honest here, okay. It's been a tough. 2022 was terrible for all of the twelve rounds of mean. So the question becomes, like, how do we trust the people in the centralized positions? I think it's less about figuring out how we trust them and have more of them. This was systemic collapse of very large players.
00:08:56.602 - 00:08:57.086, Speaker B: Okay?
00:08:57.188 - 00:09:07.006, Speaker D: If there were hundreds of them, if there were thousands of them, if this were easier to do, there would be less collective risk in a fucking bag.
00:09:07.198 - 00:09:10.302, Speaker B: Are we talking about decentralizing centralized players?
00:09:10.366 - 00:09:15.800, Speaker D: But wouldn't it be nice? Wouldn't it be nice?
00:09:17.930 - 00:09:21.990, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. So, distributing the risk. Distributing the risk.
00:09:22.570 - 00:10:06.870, Speaker D: So I envision a world where custodial trusts will one day, if you're a fund, you shouldn't have all your money in FTX. How many funds went completely bankrupt trading fucking animals on FTX? How many of them are completely megawecked? So let's think about this. You kept your entire balance on one centralized exchange. Are you kidding me? Come on. So I envision a world where someone like players, like Coinbase, or maybe even binance, or they're going to use more than one trust company, State street, prime. Trust someone else. There'll probably be ways to snark this across multiple central meat spaces.
00:10:06.870 - 00:10:08.840, Speaker D: That's how I think it'll work.
00:10:09.450 - 00:10:39.598, Speaker B: Yeah. Fantastic. Let's not bring all the blame, though, to the depositors who got sold certain assurances that maybe they didn't have in the end, though. CFI has had some problems in 2022, but honestly, there was more than $1 billion hacked in 2022 from decentralized protocols. So that's a lot of money as well.
00:10:39.684 - 00:10:42.640, Speaker D: Like, jump Capital just did it last week. Right?
00:10:43.330 - 00:10:44.426, Speaker B: Rehack.
00:10:44.618 - 00:10:46.014, Speaker D: Rehacked the hacker.
00:10:46.062 - 00:11:08.790, Speaker B: Right. Hack the hacker, which is something that happened again. But Diana, what do you think the DeFi space or the decentralized chains, layer ones, whatever the protocols is, can offer some sort of security, some sort of assurance, some sort of. To users? What can they do to protect the users?
00:11:08.950 - 00:12:01.190, Speaker A: Actually, a lot. I just want to mention that on the decentralized side, we recently launched the community driven security monitoring of the smart contract. It's called the Avenger Dao. It's a passive API, so anyone, before sending any transaction on chain, can scan, and you'll see like a red alert, a green alert, yellow alert, and it's a sort of like, you can do your research, kind of checking that before sending your funds. In the DeFi, that's one thing. And for the security as well, from the chain perspective, it makes sense to make sure you monitor the code and your code is up to date and you partner with the best players out there, because we all are here. Don't trust verify self custody kind of maxis.
00:12:01.190 - 00:12:09.280, Speaker A: So, yeah, from the DeFi perspective, the community driven security could be the answer for that.
00:12:10.690 - 00:12:36.120, Speaker B: Right? So binance smart chain or binance chain or BNB chain now. Sorry, BNB chain got hacked bad. Their bridge got hacked bad. I would like to hear more about what happened when binance chain or BNB changes stopped for a while.
00:12:37.210 - 00:13:21.940, Speaker A: I just want to say that we are so grateful to the validators that we had and to the security initiative, actually, who managed to see that something is going wrong in the real time and for everyone. Super quick reaction. So that hack was basically stopped. I know we halted the network for a short period of time, and that was the only and the first time that ever happened. So we improved the security measures. And as I mentioned earlier, BNB chain is based on the tendermint. So working on the code base, improving and driving the community security initiative, that's important.
00:13:21.940 - 00:13:27.826, Speaker A: And by the way, we reimbursed the funds to the users who got hacked.
00:13:27.938 - 00:13:58.682, Speaker D: That was the most interesting thing that happened for sure. Was that there was a bit of a bailout. So I'm a nerd, and I know what happened. Deeply what happened. And BNB chain or binance beacon chain wasn't the only one. Polygon had similar concerns that immediately after the hack, they, too, were in a position of potential compromise. So there was a proof signature that was able to get forged.
00:13:58.682 - 00:14:56.622, Speaker D: I mean, this is the stuff that really hard, not smooth brain math, right? Like, very hard math. We create these fraud proofs, or we create these deposit proofs, or we create these bridge proofs, and then this person was able to forge them. And then what was very interesting is that the BNB chain had a bunch of, I don't know, like, circuit breakers, maybe for the want of a better word, like things that when value was moving too aggressively, too quickly, there was something that the validators could step in and intervene. Now, that's a design question, right? More so than anything. And undoubtedly, humans are better off because they didn't get boned. It started out at 500 million, and it was only 70 by the time it was done. So through coordination in the industry, they were able to go to tether.
00:14:56.622 - 00:15:26.442, Speaker D: They were able to go to other folks, say, hey, these addresses that are attempting to bridge out and do nefarious things, don't do it. And that's exactly what happened with Oasis finance. That is more preposterous to me, okay? If we're talking about reality and shit and bullshit, that is more preposterous. Jump capital. Fucking hacking Oasis finance to go get that money back is garbage. I can't even believe that's allowed. And seriously, jump capital, the Chicago based trading firm, sat there and racked up.
00:15:26.442 - 00:15:29.900, Speaker D: Are you shitting me, bro? How fucking Degen is that?
00:15:32.110 - 00:15:53.480, Speaker B: So, we were speaking about regulation. Should there be allowed. Should there be allowed to do something like that? Matt, what is the liability that they would have, or both parties here? How guilty? Or were they allowed to do something like that? What's your opinion on that?
00:15:55.610 - 00:17:12.110, Speaker E: That's not my area of expertise, what they're allowed to do. I'm not a securities lawyer or work in institutional trading, but I think what I'm more interested in is seeing how DeFi protocols are leaning more on dows and seeing how we can decentralize the decision making process and the diversification of funds and risk derisking by mapping out more strong proposals that the community backs. What I don't think is appropriate is having institutions, or, sorry, regulatory agencies that are coming in and setting the rules on something that they have zero context on. I'd love these three letter agencies to get a little more context, but I do want to see the dows that are managing these DeFi protocols allow us to feel more safe, putting more weight into the software infrastructure and smart contract layer, versus relying on humans, which we keep trying to do. We get lazy. We don't want to manage our own keys, we want to give that to a custodian or pass off the liability. But the reality is we need to lean more into the code and we need to program that into these organizational decision making processes.
00:17:12.770 - 00:17:46.278, Speaker B: Absolutely. Yeah. Very hard to disagree with that. On the customer side, most people start on defi by swaps, doing something very, very simple. And one inch is the platform that most people interact with in the first time. What is one inch doing to protect the users from scam tokens from attack vectors?
00:17:46.374 - 00:18:11.120, Speaker C: So that's a good one. So we have a support team that we can unleash tokens. We are always looking closely at what's happening out there. Also we can delist tokens by requests from authorities. Right. And also we're looking not to have any toxic assets, but we are still a defy project. So anyone can input a custom token, I can trade it, whatever.
00:18:11.120 - 00:19:02.974, Speaker C: If there are liquidity pools out there with the tokens you want against the token you want to trade to, then yeah, it's all the risk and the user. But that's the difference between sapphire and Defi, the amount of knowledge, the amount that you need to consume in order to feel yourself comfortable being like a day trader on a centralized exchange. Right. If you just enter the space, or being a trader in the defi space, it's really different. Right. So first we expect users to educate themselves and we help to educate those users about where they are actually. What are the risks from the product side, I think that one inch, like our smart contracts, they have the most audits out there in the DeFi industry.
00:19:02.974 - 00:19:48.400, Speaker C: So our technical team is really love audits. We work with a lot of audit, so we invest in security a lot. So making sure that the smart contracts, they are safe and secure to operate with. There are some other cases, like for example, where there are some user got sandwiched badly or the transaction was not executed properly. Right. Like in certain cases, we can refund users if they got lost some money on a platform, but in the most cases, if the user made his own mistake, right, we can help him, of course, as a Defi project, but we expect him to learn for the next time.
00:19:49.490 - 00:20:24.780, Speaker B: Yeah. So kicking the responsibility down to the user is a lot of the times maybe the best we can do, because we are dealing with protocols that are decentralized and permissionless, and we probably want to keep them that way. We probably want to keep people able to add their tokens into a liquidity pool, even though what we get is a lot of liquidity pools full of shit tokens and scams and rug pulls. But in terms of the regulation side.
00:20:25.630 - 00:20:27.642, Speaker D: Like, uniswap didn't go down.
00:20:27.776 - 00:20:29.514, Speaker B: Uniswap did not go down. Exactly.
00:20:29.632 - 00:20:30.620, Speaker D: That's the thing.
00:20:30.990 - 00:20:32.838, Speaker C: I agree. Defi didn't go down.
00:20:32.864 - 00:20:34.798, Speaker B: One inch. Didn't go down. Didn't go down.
00:20:34.884 - 00:21:10.106, Speaker D: Defi didn't go down. I mean, price, okay, but definitely the plumbing was there. And I think that that's one of the things that we can look and rely on and say that is an example to the regulators, to those that care to shit on this sort of stuff. It's like, there was good work done there. I would say, as an industry, we do not do a good job of self advocacy. Traditional finance has lobbyists, and we do too, but we don't do enough of it. And we clearly, I can say this.
00:21:10.106 - 00:21:34.580, Speaker D: I talked to the regular. Being a CFI player in a crypto world is just not being liked by anyone. All the crypto djens are like, narc. And then all the tradfi folks are like, long hair, hippie. And then the regulators are just like, fuck you, man. I don't even understand. And so in this space where you're just like, okay, now I choose this as a life and a job.
00:21:34.580 - 00:21:57.494, Speaker D: I hate myself. It's really what, probably more than the outside world does. And for that reason, I can go ahead and brave this awful shit show, but we need to interact more. We need to advocate more, we need to demonstrate our wins more. We need to self promote. We promote well within our industry. We have great events.
00:21:57.494 - 00:22:02.010, Speaker D: We throw fucking amazing parties. But we really should probably be talking to regulators a bit more.
00:22:02.160 - 00:22:02.474, Speaker E: Right?
00:22:02.512 - 00:22:05.898, Speaker D: So regulation with bad people out in.
00:22:05.904 - 00:22:41.766, Speaker B: The know, so regulation. The fact that CFI is heavily regulated and DeFi is not regulated doesn't seem to have a correlation with people losing their money. What's a good approach to who can protect them? Proof of reserves for CFI will protect anybody. Will they? Maybe the fact that because we have them on chain, the reserves are there, you can look at it. But projects get hacked all the time. And I know that this is very.
00:22:41.788 - 00:23:02.640, Speaker D: Broad, but Genesis can re hypothecate it, even on balance sheets. So it's like you get these things where it's like, yeah, it's there, but it's also being lent to someone else in the meat space. And then you can't do that. So until we can get into absolute isolates that guarantee that there's no rehypothecation in the meat world, I don't know.
00:23:04.050 - 00:23:14.020, Speaker B: You don't know? Okay, but you said that we need to lobby more. What are we lobbying for? Anybody?
00:23:16.470 - 00:23:18.900, Speaker D: So what are we lobbying for? That's a great question.
00:23:23.530 - 00:24:04.146, Speaker C: Answer the question about who can protect users, right? So I think that carefully built products that has this in its core, if you're talking about DeFi ecosystems. Yeah, right. They are complex, opposite to the centralized exchange, right? So centralized exchange, everything's under its hood. Nobody knows what's happening there. And DeFi, on contrary, they are really complex stuff. In order to deleverage trade, you should know how to use several protocols, right. And what to do with them and how not to screw up while doing all this stuff, right.
00:24:04.146 - 00:24:08.180, Speaker C: But it also brings you a lot of opportunities out there. For example, if you would go.
00:24:10.870 - 00:24:11.186, Speaker B: To.
00:24:11.208 - 00:24:44.862, Speaker C: A bank and say, hey, I would love to get a loan from you just to use this in a position somewhere else. And if everything goes wrong, I'll just pay you like one dollars of commission. If it just fails, everyone knows the guy would be deemed like crazy. No one would work like this for. And there is also other thing about this one. So like safari and defy in different space. Because why safari has been so regulated? Because there is no innovation happening there.
00:24:44.862 - 00:25:49.842, Speaker C: Actually, there is like a trade defi business right there. And talking about DeFi, the whole innovation is happening there. You can't regulate something that don't exist yet. And in each hackathon here we see new use cases and new approaches to financial products that we have out there. So I think that once we need to think about building secure products for end users, right? So we need to think of these products to rely on themselves, not to on some other entities out there, whether it's regulators, some other funds and stuff. So I think that's the only thing. And so if we answering the question, what would we lobby for? Maybe I would love before the clearer guidance of how to operate like a decentralized finance business right here, because there are so many unclear things in the whole space and regulatory about stuff.
00:25:49.842 - 00:25:51.860, Speaker C: So that's my take on it.
00:25:52.230 - 00:26:47.014, Speaker A: Yeah. I just want to add from decentralized perspective, regulation actually helps us all to bring a billion users on chain. Because imagine people who are cautious about using DeFi protocols. Once we have more or less regulation in space, we open up a lot of opportunities for them. And I'm always curious why everyone positions CFI versus DeFi when we can find a balance with the CDFI, such as for example, tokenizing the real world assets, bonds, stocks, carbon credits, and having that efficiency, the operational efficiency, the capital efficiency. And I don't know if you guys heard the stories when a broker actually calls you like, oh my God, you will have a margin call soon, we could definitely make it way more efficient. So regulation is good, CDFI is good.
00:26:47.014 - 00:26:57.786, Speaker A: We see the future in the tokenizing real world assets and trading them on chain. So could be something very interesting for our industry as well.
00:26:57.968 - 00:27:54.650, Speaker E: Yeah, I feel like we need to enable whatever this regulation framework looks like if it requires a new agency altogether. But we need to enable smart contracts to eat financial services in the financial world and capital markets. We need to protect developers so that they can freely have regulatory sandboxes to feel safe deploying tokens or governance structures. But if you have custodians or exchanges that are taking on this role of CFI, and whether it's an on ramp or off ramp to the CFI scenario, yeah, they have customers to protect, investors to protect, they have a fiduciary duty. And in that sense, I think we're building more and more context around CFI and DeFi. But if we don't work with those two together and push more towards the DeFi route so that we rely more on smart contracts, we're never going to find a nice balance.
00:27:55.710 - 00:28:15.902, Speaker B: Excellent. So I think it's time to open it to the public. Anybody has any questions for our panelists? I'm going to go around and give you the mic. Any hands? Any hands? No questions. Here we go. What about putting debt on chain?
00:28:15.966 - 00:28:17.890, Speaker C: You can't lend out unless you have.
00:28:18.040 - 00:28:21.170, Speaker B: On chain debt in any form or format.
00:28:21.830 - 00:28:57.440, Speaker D: So debt is awesome. I think in fact, if there's going to be an interface to the meat world and the crypto world, it is going to be through senior edge and debt. It's probably not through direct tokenization, but instead through just having a claim against the asset. I think that that's probably the way that this is going to express itself, and it's probably the way it makes the most sense to do it. From a regulatory standpoint. Fuck, you can trade debt all day long, all gens can. But when I think about this, it's like there are still centralizing factors in our industry that keep me up at night.
00:28:57.440 - 00:29:33.850, Speaker D: If Gary Gensler calls up circle and says, these 15 maker vaults should just suspend all transfers that would cause a collateralization contagion on Dai that we could not fucking unwind. And that is bullshit. We need to do better than that. We have centralized too hard, to the point where we have a byzantine generals problem. That's bullshit. We're ethereum, for fuck's sake. How does that happen anyhow? This level of stuff, it's because it was easy, guys, and that's how this works.
00:29:33.850 - 00:29:47.600, Speaker D: We fucking needed easier, stable peg against the dollar. So let's just go have a bunch of them in a New York bank at Goldman Sachs. And then we wonder why we get a face punch by Wall street like two years later. Fuck's sake. Come on now. We had it coming.
00:29:48.210 - 00:30:06.210, Speaker B: Very good questions. Any other, I wonder, in your view, how do you implement the inheritance service in the Defi? Inheritance service in the Defi.
00:30:07.270 - 00:30:43.706, Speaker A: Oh, maybe I can address that one. So actually, you probably heard about the EAP four, three, seven. And there are a lot of smart wallets right now where you can have yourself custody in a smart wallet and you can add, actually, a guardian. So your key will be split into multiple parts, and you can assign someone else to have a part of your key share. So in a very unfortunate event, if something happens to you, these people will have an access to the funds, the people that you trust. And the MPC and TSS technology actually enables that. And that's the beauty of the Defi.
00:30:43.706 - 00:30:48.560, Speaker A: We have the best cryptographic proofs which can make that happen.
00:30:49.410 - 00:31:28.636, Speaker B: We don't need these custodians to manage these anymore. Right. We have time for one more question, if it's a very quick one. One more question. One more question over there. What's your opinion about protecting users on decentralized exchanges like UNICEF or one inch using insurances? So, like you said, if the protocol fails, who can protect them? But if the users buy insurance, what's.
00:31:28.668 - 00:32:03.710, Speaker C: Your thought on that? Possibly I can answer this. So if I got to write the question about insurance protocols that are there, like on top of the fire. So, as I said, it's about building the products right now because it's all fragmented in a way. So right now, as I think the users, I know that several protocols out there, they are researching this opportunity, just like, of working with the insurance protocols. But me personally, I've not seen any case so far that works in this case. So right now, I think it does not work.
00:32:07.230 - 00:32:10.762, Speaker B: All right, so we're out of time. Thank you very much.
