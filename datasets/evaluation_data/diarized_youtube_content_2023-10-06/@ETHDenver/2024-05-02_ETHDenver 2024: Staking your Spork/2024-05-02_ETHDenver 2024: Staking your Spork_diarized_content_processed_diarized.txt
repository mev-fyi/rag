00:00:01.040 - 00:00:33.866, Speaker A: Hey, I'm Russell, and I'm here to tell you how to stake your spork. So the first thing I want to do is go visit stake sporkdao IO, and then connect your wallet to the app. So this isn't too hard to do. As long as you've got Metamask enabled, you can do that, and then when you do it, your spork balance will show up. This, of course, assumes that you do have some spork and some matic you can. Then, if this is the first time you've ever entered, you have to enter by staking your spork. You're joining our Dao, like our co op.
00:00:33.866 - 00:01:21.180, Speaker A: That's a Colorado limited cooperative association. So you do have to enter in your name, your email address, and what country that you're in, and then enter in how many spork you actually want to stake. This will actually start off two transactions. The first one is where you're approving the amount of spork that's going to go into the contract, and the second is actually where it goes through. So it does take a little bit of time, but it shouldn't be a problem. And what will happen is, after you get the second confirmation, that is when you'll see the spork balance change in the app. And that's what you'll see here in just a second, where you'll actually have, in this case, we'll have five stakes spork and five regular spork.
00:01:21.180 - 00:01:24.604, Speaker A: Thanks. And do this, and then congratulations, you'll be a member.
