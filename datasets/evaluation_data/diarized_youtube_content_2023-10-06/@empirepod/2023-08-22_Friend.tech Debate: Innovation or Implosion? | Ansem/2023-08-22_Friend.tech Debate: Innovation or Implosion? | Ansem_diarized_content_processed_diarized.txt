00:00:00.360 - 00:00:32.038, Speaker A: Why does it have to be a token that is traded 24 7365? And it just, I think it's distracting for fans that might be demoralized. It's like, it's what happening with, like, a lot of NFT collections. Like, what happens when the price goes down 90%? Does that mean that you suck as an artist? Think it's really. Your dopamine system goes on hyperdrive once you start seeing your token pump and you're like, fuck, yeah. Like, I'm worth like, more than Jason. And like, my token is you wake up and your token's up ten.
00:00:32.126 - 00:00:34.014, Speaker B: You got to get on there so we can battle, man.
00:00:34.134 - 00:00:36.862, Speaker C: Yeah. Wow.
00:00:36.998 - 00:00:50.554, Speaker A: Of course it feels great if your token's up ten x or up only, like, great. Yeah, but markets do what the markets do and like, there are cycles and bubbles pop and so what happens if your share price is down 90%?
00:00:52.614 - 00:01:24.500, Speaker B: I think this will probably be one of our most controversial episodes we've ever done in the last, like two, three years. Basically, friend tech has taken over the narrative more than anything I've probably. Probably more than anything I've seen since NFTs in 2021 and then before that, you know, Defi in 2020 with Defi Summer. And so just wanted to bring on Ansem. Ansem is not one of the founders, but is. Was kind of the first person I saw posting on Twitter about this back I think, like three weeks ago. But, you know, one of the first days of August, like, pre launch posting about this.
00:01:24.500 - 00:01:34.754, Speaker B: And I think right now you're the top, at least out of my friends. You're like number five on the, the so called leaderboard. So, Anselmo, welcome to the show. Um, yeah, pumped to have you here.
00:01:35.374 - 00:01:37.758, Speaker C: Yeah, thanks for having me on, guys. Should be fine.
00:01:37.806 - 00:01:50.714, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. All right, so let's, uh, let's maybe start from the top. Just like, what, what is friend tech in your mind? And maybe actually even before that, like, when did you first hear, when did frontech and like, racer and stuff get on your radar?
00:01:52.094 - 00:02:40.484, Speaker C: Um, well, I saw it on my timeline probably like a month or so ago. Didn't really know what it was. I just saw the tagline. I was like, you'll be able to make a token associated with your profile, like friend tech buyer friends. I thought it was interesting, but I've seen the social tokens narrative get more popular over the past year or so, and it's been kind of building up, but there had never been any platform directly other than bit cloud where you had a token associated with your online likeness. So I'd say probably a month ago. And then it just started kind of building and I was already looking at base and, like, the applications there because Coinbase, I think, is going to do a really good job with their l two just because of how much retail exposure they already have through their centralized exchange.
00:02:40.484 - 00:03:01.964, Speaker C: And this year in crypto, I've been kind of looking for which consumer applications I think are going to be that next level. Outside of just the DeFi primitives that are really going to get on board more people other than just the dj's that are already on chain trading everything. So I was kind of looking in both of these areas, and friendsec just kind of popped off pretty quickly a couple weeks ago.
00:03:02.464 - 00:03:10.864, Speaker B: Nice, man. Did you meet the founders? Did you meet. Who are the founders? Shrimp and racer and stuff. Did you meet the pancake? Did you meet these guys?
00:03:10.904 - 00:03:11.032, Speaker A: Or.
00:03:11.048 - 00:03:28.864, Speaker C: No, no, I've met. I mean, I've met pancakes in person a few times, like at some conferences in Europe. Lisbon, I think that's the homie. I know him pretty well. Racer, I just know from online he's just a shit poster. I never met him or shrimp, but, yeah, pancakes is cool. That's the homie.
00:03:29.644 - 00:04:01.946, Speaker A: So let's just walk through. For anyone that is kind of like waking up or under a rock, like friend tech, it's, like, bit clout. People may not even know what that is. So basically, you get an invite code, and these invite codes were, like, kind of coming out, and a few people are throwing them out there on Twitter. So you're lucky enough you get on the platform, and the first thing, it's like, it's only mobile. And the first thing that it asks you to is to connect your Twitter account, to claim your profile, to verify your identity. And I stopped there.
00:04:01.946 - 00:04:34.532, Speaker A: I said, there's no fucking way that I'm going to connect my Twitter to this thing. It just looks sketch. I'm not going to do it. There's just a lot of downsides. So I stopped there. I got a code a couple weeks ago, and I haven't gotten on the platform, but you guys are so bold as to have gone through that flow. And so what happens, like, once you open up this Pandora's box, magic kingdom of frentech, like, what do you see? Okay, like, I'm just gonna say, like, well, I'll stop.
00:04:34.532 - 00:04:40.464, Speaker A: I'll resist the age. Why don't we just be more objective in this first part of the episode?
00:04:41.564 - 00:05:01.256, Speaker C: Yeah. So the first thing you see is, like, an option to buy your own share. So essentially each person that gets an account, like, they obviously link it with their Twitter, which verifies their, their actual person. And then the first like screen is buy your share. So you buy your own share. It's free. And then you're.
00:05:01.400 - 00:05:02.404, Speaker A: But it's free.
00:05:02.704 - 00:05:05.044, Speaker C: Yeah, the first share is free. That's for you to buy.
00:05:06.344 - 00:05:08.512, Speaker B: You get a share for get your own share.
00:05:08.648 - 00:05:09.680, Speaker C: It's like free.
00:05:09.832 - 00:05:14.704, Speaker A: This, by the way, deployed on base. So like you need to port over some money in a base to do.
00:05:14.744 - 00:05:30.928, Speaker C: Yeah, you deposit, I think they recommended like 0.001 or 0.05 ETH, whatever it was. Just so you have like for gas fees and stuff. But yeah, so you get to buy your own token and then once you buy your token, then it's available for trading and then everybody else on the app can trade, buy and sell your token.
00:05:30.976 - 00:05:33.404, Speaker A: Can you buy more than one chair then in there?
00:05:34.184 - 00:05:35.616, Speaker C: No, not directly.
00:05:35.800 - 00:05:55.304, Speaker A: So you can only buy one. You can't like load up a bag of your own chairs before. No, you can only buy one. Before we go any further, talk to us about the bridging experience, because we've had two episodes on base and apparently bridging is super smooth, super easy. So can you just comment, talk a little bit about that experience?
00:05:56.164 - 00:06:25.162, Speaker C: Yeah, the app was pretty straightforward. I like, I bridged to base already from ETH and when I downloaded the app, they send, just gave you an address to deposit ETH from, like to your base address. But then after that, after like the first few days of onboarding, they also enabled people to just send money from their ETH address on Mainnet. Previously it was base. You had to have Base ETH, but they enabled that functionality, did all the bridging and everything for you.
00:06:25.298 - 00:06:34.454, Speaker A: So if you have some ETH in an exchange or in your own wallet, like native wallet and ethereum, l one or some other l two, it has to be l one and you bridge over.
00:06:37.984 - 00:07:02.912, Speaker B: I've actually been recommending folks download this, not even because they want to play with friendtech and bet on Ansem or you or something like that, but just to see the onboarding experience. It's the best ux onboarding experience of anything that I've seen so far. It operates as an app. So you basically get this, you go to friendtech.com, you then save it to your home screen. So it's basically operating as an app, but it allows you to skip the App Store. It bridges for you.
00:07:02.912 - 00:07:24.896, Speaker B: So you connect your metamask and then you actually do the trans. You deposit the ETH, and then it does the bridging for you. You deposit one time and make do one signature, and then you never have to sign again. So every transaction after that is, like, I don't know, pre signed or whatever. And you're basically minimizing, like, good ux is like. Is basically just minimizing the amount of times you have to click around somewhere, and that allows you to do that.
00:07:25.080 - 00:08:07.864, Speaker A: When I hear that, the first thing that I hear is the first thing in my brain is, like, security, are they compromising on ski, like, because they're generating a private key for you, right, while you're doing all this in the back or what is happening? Because if you're depositing to, you're not connect. Like, I guess you're connecting your metamask, but it's not. Your friend tech account has a private key attached to it, and it. That's not the one that you're sending your e from. Right. Okay. I just want to be clear, because this is something that I want to come back to later on in the episode of how easy smooth Ux, historically in crypto at some point has meant compromising security.
00:08:07.864 - 00:08:25.152, Speaker A: But we'll save that for later. So. Okay, so you bridge your ETH over to this thing. You buy one chair, and it costs you a dollar. Everyone just a dollar. So you need to pay a dollar to get initiated in this thing. As soon as you do that, the rest of the world can buy your shares.
00:08:25.152 - 00:08:31.644, Speaker A: How many shares are available? What does this curve look like? Like, the pricing curve for your shares. Like, how does that work?
00:08:33.384 - 00:08:57.854, Speaker C: There's an equation for the bonding curve. I don't know it off the top of my head, but as more people buy, the price obviously increases. It's kind of like a parabolic type. Type of curve. I think that I'm around, like, 150 holders, I want to say, and I think my pricing is, like, 1.8 ETH. But you can buy multiple shares instead of just buying one share.
00:08:58.594 - 00:09:15.854, Speaker A: So one share of. So if you're another user and you want to buy one of your shares because, hey, I like you. I follow you on Twitter. I think you're great. You have good takes. I'm going to go and support you for whatever reason, and it's going to cost me 1.8 ETH per share.
00:09:15.854 - 00:09:18.374, Speaker A: All right.
00:09:18.534 - 00:09:19.134, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:09:19.254 - 00:09:21.554, Speaker A: Roughly close to $3,000.
00:09:21.934 - 00:09:40.894, Speaker B: So, Santa, you can see it right here. So you can see it right here. So if there's. So if no one owns Ansem, there's it costs $0. As soon as someone owns one share, it's 0.00,625. Then let's say someone, let's say there are, like, ten holders and they all hold one share of Ansem. It goes up to 0068.
00:09:40.934 - 00:09:49.420, Speaker A: So basically, the first guy that buys is, like, one guy to buy is, like, close to. Is over, like $11.
00:09:49.572 - 00:09:50.300, Speaker C: Mm hmm.
00:09:50.412 - 00:10:17.124, Speaker A: So, yeah, it's a linear relationship. And then the 20th guy to buy is like, you know, I want to guess or something third. Oh, even more. Yeah. $45 and so on and so forth. And so what is the motivation to buy your share? And. And do you buy one share? Do you buy ten? Like, what have you guys been doing?
00:10:19.024 - 00:11:10.154, Speaker C: Well, what I've been doing, I think there's, like, different strategies for it, in my opinion. I think that printet can be not just crypto content creators. So if you have founders in other industries, you've, like, musicians or artists or athletes that may not be as popular, maybe you want to buy share. So hold one of their shares, and then as they grow and, like, as they get more popular, then more people are more invested in their platform, whatever they're doing, and their share price may go up, or you want access to the information that they have. So, say somebody's an expert in some field of technology or in their industry, and they want to share information through this chat, then you buy their shares. You have access to that, basically, until you decide to sell. And I think we've kind of seen in social media, a lot of these creators are trusted by their followings.
00:11:10.154 - 00:11:20.062, Speaker C: And you can see with, like, Elon posting or switching over x to doing ad revenue and sharing with creators and kind of pushing the subscriber, subscriber link.
00:11:20.198 - 00:12:14.034, Speaker A: Paid newsletters and side. So, historically, it's been sort of disassociated, right? You have, like, you grow your social media presence, be it Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and then you monetize in some other manner, right? You have your sub stack or you have your own website and people. But, like, the argument that I've heard or historically, how it's worked is people build a social profile that is free, and then as soon as people, like, want to get more of that, it's almost like a gateway drug, if you will, to their paid content where they monetize. Now, if you, is there a distinction between the number of shares that you have and the level of access that you get, or is everyone on the same? Like, as soon as you have one or a hundred, doesn't matter.
00:12:14.574 - 00:12:18.150, Speaker C: There's no distinction. Okay, well, not currently there's no distinction.
00:12:18.222 - 00:12:38.314, Speaker B: So, Santi, the other thing that we did that Ansem didn't talk about yet is like, you get what you get. Access to inside of the group is almost like a telegram chat. So, like, let's say I own Ansem's. Like one of Ansem's. I bought Ansem no matter what price I got it at, no matter how many shares I own, I get access to, like, his one to one chat, basically. And, like, I think, how active are.
00:12:38.354 - 00:12:39.854, Speaker A: These chats, by the way?
00:12:40.234 - 00:13:12.388, Speaker C: It varies. So there's some people that are super active, and I'm posting, like, nonstop, and some people aren't as active. And I think it's kind of seen in people's share price. So the people who are more active and responding to people non stop and back and forth, their share price is typically higher because people feel like they have that closer connection and closer access to them. For me, that's one of the big things because I have a good amount of followers on Twitter, and I literally can't reply to my DM's anymore because I just get so many of them. But I have a chat like this, and I have a smaller amount of them that I can reply to. So it's easier for me to, like, filter through some information.
00:13:12.388 - 00:13:13.708, Speaker C: But, yeah, it depends on the person.
00:13:13.756 - 00:13:39.008, Speaker A: Honestly, someone might look at this mechanism and say, oh, wait, wait a minute, if you're critical of this. Well, how is that any different from Twitter? Right? Which is allows now to have a subscription, right? Like some big accounts, like Spectator index and a few others that I have all, like, now have, like, this tweets that are, like, protected now. And if you want to see them, you have to subscribe. Yeah, it's kind of now. It's not one to one perfect analogy.
00:13:39.056 - 00:13:59.934, Speaker C: But it's just a difference. It's similar to that. I would say that the main difference is that you also benefit in that person growing their popularity. So say you buy some, you subscribe to somebody when they have, like, five k, and then they go to 100k followers previously, you don't get any access to that, like, outside or anything that's outside. That's the main difference.
00:14:00.234 - 00:14:22.954, Speaker A: But, yeah, how active? I guess, like when you guys, I mean, I appreciate it's been just under a month or just a month. Mostly crypto natives starting to see some non crypto native people. Like, there was an NFL player that joined recently. Presumably other celebrities are gonna join soon.
00:14:25.054 - 00:14:45.394, Speaker C: Yeah, it's been mostly crypto native guys. I think it was yesterday Grayson Allen from the Bucks, the NBA player joined, and then faze banks from Faze clan joined. It's like one of the big face clan guys. And he was, like, posting about it pretty actively on instagram. And then in his chats, like, talking about, yeah, I'm, like, super excited about this. Talk to the team. Talk to the founders.
00:14:45.394 - 00:15:24.452, Speaker C: So for me, I think it's likely that you'll see other people outside of just crypto start to join, especially since the onboarding is pretty simple. There's not really a ton of downside for people who already have these platforms in other industries, on other social media platforms. So I think you'll start to see, and it'll be interesting, like, I guess, how racer is, like, on the leaderboard compared to people like faze banks or Grayson Allen. Because for me, it's like, racer should be the most important person. He's the founder of the app, obviously, but it's, like, going to be interesting to see which, I guess, fans and which groups of people do.
00:15:24.468 - 00:15:28.404, Speaker B: Well, I know you're hyper skeptical on this, and, like, that's an objective question.
00:15:28.444 - 00:15:30.824, Speaker A: Like, I'm not being skeptical. I'm just asking, like, questions.
00:15:33.124 - 00:16:06.600, Speaker B: Let me just share my framework for it for a second. It's actually an idea that I talked about with this guy, Chris King, back in, like, 2018, which is, are you ever, like, with friends? And you're like, yo, I was following this Instagram account and had, like, 2000 followers, and, like, now it's blown up. Now it's got, like, 200,000 be like. Or, you know, you find a song on Spotify or probably on SoundCloud when it's got, like, 10,000 listens, and then, like, three years later, it blows up, and then five years later, they're touring. You're like, damn. Like, I was listening that artist before anyone knew about them. I feel like a lot of people probably just had this experience with Fred again, it's probably, like, the most recent, but there's no way to bet on that.
00:16:06.600 - 00:16:22.802, Speaker B: There's no way to be like, yo, Santi and I first talked in 2017. I knew that dude was smart. He started posting on Twitter. I wish I could bet on this dude. There's no way to do that. And I think right now, it's like, full blown speculative mania. Absolutely insane.
00:16:22.802 - 00:16:41.874, Speaker B: Probably a lot of people get hurt in some way or another. But long term, it's cool to have a platform that allows you to bet both long and short on. I don't know, just people in general now. There's a bunch of, like, societal downsides of that that we can talk about. I think that's like, my mental framework for this.
00:16:42.574 - 00:17:22.714, Speaker A: No, absolutely. Look, I mean, I think, I think the idea of it is, is powerful. I'm not, like, being skeptical of that. The thing that, I mean, of course we can keep it anecdotal of, like, your experience, but where I've, in practice, I've, like, steam it. You guys remember that, like, you get, it's like red. It's like, read about, you get upvoted and you make money out of it. And then there's a whole body of, like, studies out there that show that as soon as you, it's like behavioral economics, right? And as soon as you, as soon as you introduce a price to things, people are less willing to do certain things, like, for instance, like charity.
00:17:22.714 - 00:18:12.016, Speaker A: A lot of people, like, would walk your dog or would do certain things without even the notion of thinking that they're going to be compensated for it. And as soon as you introduce an element of compensation, it really distorts and changes incentives in a way that, like, the forgotten conclusions. Like, just don't introduce comp, like, Val, like, tangible value to that because a lot of it's just goodwill. And I think about, like, my experience in Twitter. Like, I'm not posting, like, even when I had 50 followers to, when I have, like, over 100,000 followers, I don't do it directly to, like, to, like, get paid. And, like, now, for instance, DC investor. Now apparently, you know, in order to, like, get some revenue sharing from Twitter, you have to have over 10 million impressions.
00:18:12.016 - 00:18:36.954, Speaker A: There's, like, a criteria of which I'm close to, but I'm not there. DC investor is, and he's like, he was tweeting about that experience of, like, now being paid for some and for essentially his tweets. And I don't know. I'm really curious to get both of your perspective on the idea of monetizing this thing that you would otherwise and have been doing historically for free.
00:18:40.734 - 00:18:49.588, Speaker C: The way I've been thinking about it is I think it's actually incentivizes people to put out more free content, in my opinion, because it, now that people.
00:18:49.636 - 00:18:53.852, Speaker A: Have, is it free, though? It's not because you're getting paid.
00:18:54.028 - 00:19:58.764, Speaker C: So I'm saying outside of your, like, platform, on whatever it is on, on friend, the content that you're putting out on Twitter or on whatever other platforms that people are reading for free, I think that since you have that, that income stream, even if those are people aren't contributing directly to your, like, shares on Friendtech. You also have, are going to put out more information to all these other people that are reading it for free because they know that once you're putting out more content, that also is going to incentivize people. Like, as your followers go up and like, your, your content goes up, you put out more good stuff that's probably going to like, have that positive feedback loop on Friendsec as well. So that's the way I think about it's like, even the smaller accounts, like, there are a lot of smaller accounts on Twitter with like three 4K followers and their share price is equal to those with like one hundred k. Two hundred k. And that's because, like, they have a lot of good content or they're putting on Twitter and then it gets boosted on Friendtext. So it's good kind of high signal there to see, like, which smaller accounts are gonna blow up or could do well later.
00:19:58.764 - 00:20:03.404, Speaker C: And also just like, finding good analysts early. I think it's interesting in that regard.
00:20:04.224 - 00:20:09.954, Speaker A: So when you post, Jason, I want to go to you as well. When you post on Twitter, post on frantic as well.
00:20:12.014 - 00:20:12.754, Speaker B: No.
00:20:13.574 - 00:20:37.014, Speaker A: Right. But people looking at what you're doing on Twitter. So, like, for you, can you post outside of this Telegram group to the public that may not own your shares? Or is everything that is happening, all the discourse is happening inside these groups? Paid wall essentially.
00:20:39.354 - 00:20:40.882, Speaker B: Happens inside the groups.
00:20:41.058 - 00:20:53.106, Speaker A: Okay, so there's nothing that is public like, like Twitter. It's basically combination of, uh, it's basically telegram, but with paid groups only paid groups, I guess.
00:20:53.290 - 00:20:54.494, Speaker C: In the app, you mean?
00:20:54.834 - 00:21:09.764, Speaker A: Yeah, in the app, yeah. Got it. Do you think that at some point that will open it up so that it's a mix of, like, Twitter with, like, Twitter DM's? Like Twitter with paid DM's. Essentially.
00:21:11.304 - 00:21:37.462, Speaker C: I think they might incorporate like a public sort of feed. The Explore page is kind of hard to filter through now because it's literally just like everything. There's a list of what your friends are doing and then there's a list of everything that's happening on the app. And it's just like an explorer, basically, of people that are buying and selling. I think it's very bare bones at the moment, for sure. And they definitely could incorporate some kind of public feed that would be interesting. But I think the core, the core functionality of the app probably won't change.
00:21:37.638 - 00:21:48.074, Speaker A: Does it recognize, when you say friends, is it your friends on Twitter? That are now registered as well on Friendk. Or are your friends only the people that you're buying shares of?
00:21:50.094 - 00:21:54.234, Speaker C: Yeah, your friends are, like, your holders or people that you have shares in.
00:21:55.254 - 00:22:00.314, Speaker A: Got it. So I would assume it's, like, basically no activity if you don't buy shares than anyone else.
00:22:01.324 - 00:22:09.500, Speaker B: I mean, there's a, I don't know if you can see my screen Santa, but there's, like, a, you can see, like, all your friends on Twitter. So, like, here, I'll show you this. There'll be like.
00:22:09.692 - 00:22:13.332, Speaker A: That's what I'm saying. Yeah. Recognizes your friends on Twitter. Right.
00:22:13.428 - 00:22:36.502, Speaker B: So, like, see, I don't know if you can see that, like, leaderboard type thing or, like, this is like, an activity feed. Like, if you ever go on, like, Venmo and you can see who's, like, paying people and stuff, it looks very similar to that. Or I can be like, oh, like, Mika Honka Salo just bought one share of Matt Feibeck, who's a blockworks research analyst, or, like, you know, marlo just sold one share of john charb. Um, so it's kind of, you can see that whole activity feed, you know, portrait.
00:22:36.558 - 00:22:48.686, Speaker A: These are, these are people. Well, that was my question. Right. Because it's people that you follow on twitter automatically, you, this activity is populated by that. Right. It recognizes your friend, your followers.
00:22:48.750 - 00:22:49.046, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:22:49.110 - 00:22:57.758, Speaker A: Twitter. To then suggest or tell you what other people are doing. Doing to incentivize you to go out and, like, you know, go long or short some of these.
00:22:57.846 - 00:23:19.754, Speaker B: Yeah, ansem zoom. Zooming up for a sec, because I know you've probably spent more time thinking about this than, like, anyone out there outside of the founders and paradigm folks who led the seed round to them. What is your kind of, we'll talk about the bear case in a second. But, like, what is the bull case for this? Like, what is your, like, zero to one moment, like, if all of this works? Like, how are, what's your, like, mental model for how you're thinking about this long term?
00:23:21.084 - 00:24:15.042, Speaker C: The way I've been thinking about it is there are a ton of industries that have these influencers and have these creators that have a ton of impacts in whatever their specific industry is and are experts in their field. But people historically have had no way of betting on those people doing well or participating in the upside that they have in those communities. And I think fandom is really, really, really a big thing nowadays. If you look at, like, music artists or, like, rappers or athletes, that's huge. And people will pay a ton of money, whether it's just for, like, tickets to a concert or like, for signing to events. So the way I think about it is, like, you take somebody like Taylor Swift who has resold concert tickets for upwards of ten K. If she were to have a, like, a friend tech group, like, you would assume that there's going to be people willing to pay whatever premium to get that direct access to her.
00:24:15.042 - 00:25:04.258, Speaker C: And then she can give access to her shareholders via, like, meetups or private meetups or like, signings or anything like that. And I think that can happen across multiple different industries in a way that's never really been done before, while also allowing people to benefit in the upside from the athletes or creators continue to blow up. So, like, say you have a college athlete, like, number one in the nation in high school, whatever, and they get selected to go to, I don't know, like, U of Alabama. You can buy shares, like, as they are, whatever, getting picked, and then they go to the league, obviously keep doing. Well, whatever, continue throughout their career, like that. That ability to bet on an individual, like, early in their whatever their career and then them blowing up has never been possible before. I think it's obviously very difficult to achieve.
00:25:04.258 - 00:25:16.654, Speaker C: Like, I'm not saying that's the base case, but if they do, if they are able to do that, it will be crossing a chasm, not just in crypto, but across like, multiple different industries. I think that's a really cool scenario that could play out.
00:25:17.314 - 00:25:36.250, Speaker B: So you see it as some combination of fan groups, like subscription fan groups, let's call it a Patreon or onlyfans, combined with a longer term fan duel, draftkings, betting on someone's not on the game that they're playing, but on their career almost.
00:25:36.402 - 00:25:52.964, Speaker C: Right? I know there's something called, I'm not a huge fantasy football guy, but, like, the dynasty, I think it's called where you can draft people, but over like, multiple years. It's not just the one fantasy football season. So I already exist, but yeah, similar to that, but for everything. For like, all industries.
00:25:53.384 - 00:26:04.776, Speaker B: Yeah, it's interesting. So I'm in disclosures. I bought a, like a token to disclosure or whatever. So I'm in just. And I like disclosures music. So I'm in his thing, and he's on the app and I'll just read something. I think it's fine to read from his, like.
00:26:04.776 - 00:26:18.534, Speaker B: So he's got 38 holders, and this is what he sent to them. He says this whole. This is the strategy. The entire music industry is going to adopt soon, at least for independent artists like me, subscription based models for fan clubs, basically is where all this goes.
00:26:20.154 - 00:26:35.794, Speaker C: Yeah, the guy, I think it's blau. He's on there and he was, like, saying he's going to drop, like, links to pre release the stuff before it comes out for people. So I think there's definitely interesting things you can do with music.
00:26:37.614 - 00:26:40.634, Speaker B: Maybe flip it. What's your, like, bear case on this?
00:26:42.454 - 00:27:20.804, Speaker C: Well, mine, the bear case is like anything that's tradable is gonna have. If it goes up too fast, it's gonna come down. So there's always gonna be people that are taking profit if they're up ten x, 20 x, whatever on their share price, especially if they have more than one. So, and I've looked at my, like, holders and there's a good chunk of them that only have one share. And I think those are the people who are less likely to sell because they obviously are not really trying to trade it. But some people that have, like, multiple shares, I think as your share price goes up, there's always going to be people taking profit. And when people, like, there's people taking profit because of how the curve is set up, there's always going to be somebody who bought high and then price goes down.
00:27:20.804 - 00:27:42.584, Speaker C: So in the case where you have somebody famous and say they do something publicly, that's not great, and then their share price goes down, people can lose money on that. So anything where speculation is involved, I think you have to be wary of that, and that could hurt the platform in that way. But I think that's just like, default by anything that people buy and sell.
00:27:42.884 - 00:28:11.224, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's the best thing about Frontec is also going to be the worst thing, which is the speculative nature of things in crypto is amazing for customer acquisition costs. There's no marketing plan friendech ever could have run that would have been able to onboard their. There's now 100,000 people on friendtech in like two week time, and there's no marketing plan that would have, that would have accomplished that. But that's also the, like, toughest thing to manage. For anyone who's probably launched a token, they've seen this, right? That's the toughest thing to manage for long term growth.
00:28:11.344 - 00:28:11.672, Speaker C: So.
00:28:11.728 - 00:28:18.524, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Um, Santi, how you feeling about friend tech right now?
00:28:21.104 - 00:28:28.452, Speaker A: Well, um, I'm not there because I'm not gonna link my Twitter. Like, well, I'm not gonna say what's.
00:28:28.468 - 00:28:31.344, Speaker B: The, what's, what's the concern about linking the Twitter just curious.
00:28:32.004 - 00:28:54.142, Speaker A: Historically, I think it opens up a vector where it could get compromised. Right. A lot of that. Whenever you connect something like there have been issues with other apps that you connect to. So I'm very sensitive to that, but I'm noodling on it. I may go on there, I don't know.
00:28:54.278 - 00:29:05.054, Speaker B: Santizumi from Friendtech, what is your thought around just social tokens in general? Because it does feel like this kind of social token thesis is coming back a little bit. And do you remember our episode with icebergy? Iceberg?
00:29:05.094 - 00:30:27.274, Speaker A: Yeah, icebergy. And then Alex, like this guy Alex had a social token way, way back. Look, income sharing agreements, that's like the, the very more basic construct is income sharing agreements, right? People to go to school, they have isas and all this stuff like Lambda school and all this whereby you commit to, you know, people can buy basically some sort of share in your future earnings potential and then it's kind of a little bit like that, but in a more real time speculative way that makes me uneasy. Like what happens if, I don't know, unseen, like can you buy more shares of your own token? Like can you go out and buy like. Yeah. So, like are you earning trading fees based on, like, so these are the things that I just, I don't know, like, I'm not like I've been in crypto long enough to just have seen various iterations of this type of model that have not worked. Bit cloud steam it, right, that I'm, it's like algorithmic stablecoins.
00:30:27.274 - 00:31:14.134, Speaker A: It's like fascinating to think about but have a whole set of issues where they haven't worked before. But we keep trying. I don't disagree with like any of the things that you've said, by the way, AnSi, which is like the idea of like there ought to be a better way for creators to connect with their fans and be remunerated and maybe the fans early fans and adopters also participate in that upside. Like it would be cool. Oh, by the way, no one's really like asking for it. Right, Jason, to your point, like would it be nice to like get credit for being an early, dislike discovering disclosure early? Great. Yeah, absolutely.
00:31:14.134 - 00:32:06.944, Speaker A: Issue an NFT of that that you went to their concert in like some sort of random bar in Brooklyn. Like why doesn't have to be a token that is traded 24 7365 and it just, I think it's distracting. Like for, for fans that might be demoralized. It's like, it's what happening with like a lot of NFT collections. Like, what happens when the price goes down 90%? Like, does that mean that you suck as an artist? And what does that do to the churn of the fan base? Like, I don't know. It's just like, I'm not very bullish on this sector of crypto. Like, I think social is interesting, but, like, social plus, like, this speculative rage is just makes me uneasy.
00:32:06.944 - 00:32:30.444, Speaker A: So, look, it's gonna keep happening. These experiments are gonna go on, but I'm not. This is an era where I'm not really bullish on, to be honest. And I'm happy to elaborate on any of that, but I'm just not. I think it's. There's a lot of enthusiasm. I think it's really.
00:32:30.444 - 00:32:45.752, Speaker A: Your dopamine system goes on hyperdrive once you start seeing your token pump and you're like, fuck, yeah, I'm worth, like, more than Jason. And, like, you wake up and your token's up ten, you got to get.
00:32:45.768 - 00:32:47.144, Speaker B: On there so we can battle, man.
00:32:47.264 - 00:32:49.776, Speaker C: Yeah, for sure. Wow.
00:32:49.840 - 00:33:04.750, Speaker A: Like, of course it feels great if your tokens up ten x or up only, like, great. Yeah, but markets do what the markets do, and, like, there are cycles and bubbles pop and so what happens if your share price is down 90%?
00:33:04.822 - 00:33:09.514, Speaker B: Like Santa? Let me throw this out to you. Who's. You love Avicii, right?
00:33:11.214 - 00:33:15.334, Speaker A: Like, who doesn't? Best dj of all time. It's not even a question.
00:33:15.414 - 00:33:16.518, Speaker C: Like, not even a question.
00:33:16.606 - 00:33:17.406, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:33:17.590 - 00:33:18.494, Speaker B: Not even a question.
00:33:18.574 - 00:33:23.880, Speaker A: I was seeing his early conversations. I went to one of his earliest concerts, and he was playing in New York and I was there.
00:33:24.032 - 00:33:55.808, Speaker B: Yeah. So if Avicii dropped, like, let's say, 10,000 nfts, those are like, back in, I don't know, 2008 or something like that. Like, those are completely speculative nature. And those would probably operate in the same way that something like a friend tech share would operate, which is as Avicii's career grows, those grow as well. And they're 24, 7365, and people can buy them and sell them and flip them. And I think anything that has a dollar value associated with ends up becoming a speculative market. Like, I mean, you also.
00:33:55.808 - 00:34:04.704, Speaker B: I know you buy some watches. Like, that is a talk about a speculative market. Like, the watch market is insane. But that doesn't mean, like, there shouldn't be a watch market. Do you know what I'm saying?
00:34:04.744 - 00:34:21.373, Speaker A: Look, I'm not. I'm like, I'm not anti market or anti financialization. These things will happen. We can't stop them. The world just wants to finance. Like, if you can financialize something, it will happen. Like, you have these collector, like, collector markets are huge across.
00:34:21.373 - 00:34:50.083, Speaker A: Why any sort of wine, cars, all type of luxury goods. Like, you know, mementos, like, you know, like Jordan jerseys and Kobe like Stockx. Like, these things are massive. People want to collect. Like, we collect stuff. And so that inherently has a price attached to it. So I don't know if I think the distinction is nuanced, though, between getting an NFT having attended a concert.
00:34:50.083 - 00:35:39.458, Speaker A: I think of it more as of like a something that has a little bit more meat on the bone, not just like a share certificate, if you will. It's like, it's like a collection, right? It's like you can go buy. It's like saying, hey, I was in the Lakers final where Kobe played and like, you have that ticket or you have the ball or the net or something. Is that valuable? Of course there's, there's someone out there who's gonna pay a ton of money on that and you can auction it off and Sotheby's or whatever. But yeah, like, do you want to have a Kobe like shares constantly traded? Like, I don't know, it's just different. Do you see what I'm saying? I think it's.
00:35:39.506 - 00:35:40.042, Speaker B: No, I do.
00:35:40.098 - 00:35:43.854, Speaker A: There is a distinction, I think. I'm sorry, but it's not the same, I think.
00:35:44.514 - 00:35:50.974, Speaker B: Anson, what's your kind of framework around thinking about these? Is maybe like NFTs 2.0 or is that a bad, bad mental model?
00:35:51.794 - 00:36:36.746, Speaker C: I do like the social tokens as NFTs 2.0. I kind of tweeted it the other day, but I think that honestly, the in state or like best case scenario for these, I think it's going to be a combination of NST NFTs with the shares or like shareholder groups. That's where I think this is going to trend towards. I think it just makes a ton of sense to have an NFT collection associated with your like whatever your VIP shareholder group. And then you can also do some really cool things where like, as time passes, if they've been one of your shareholders for a really long time, you can reward those people who've been holding whatever your NFT and have it like upgrade with different tiers and stuff like that. I think that's a really cool lane that this could go down. But one of the reasons I think I said NFTS 2.0
00:36:36.746 - 00:37:14.954, Speaker C: is because the royalties and everything are built into the contract. So like, one of the things that people have said one of the reasons for why creators were not as excited about nfts before is because royalties basically got killed. But in this setup, creators get a default, a percentage of all the trading fees. So it's kind of like a royalties by default implementation. That's why I kind of said it's like NFTS 2.0, but I do think there should be a combination that could be really cool. Since Forentech is very bare bones, I think you can build a lot of cool protocols and things on top of it.
00:37:14.954 - 00:37:56.774, Speaker C: And we've kind of already started to see devs build out different uis and Ux and things on top to trade the shares, fractionalized shares. I think that'll continue to happen, but it can be like the bear, the base layer for other things on top. And with the speculation, the speculation thing, I just think, like, it's. It is weird that it's people you've kind of seen on the timeline. Yeah, some people are happy that their shares are up, but there are also people that are unhappy that their shares are not up. Like some people who have a ton of followers, like, well, why isn't my share as high as this person? You kind of see some people like, yeah, I don't want. I don't want to be on the app just because I don't want to deal with that, like, personal situation.
00:37:59.394 - 00:38:31.768, Speaker B: Everyone, we'll get back to empire in just a minute, but before we do that, I want to let you know that we have permissionless coming up. Permissionless is big conference that blockworks and bankless put on together. It is the biggest, the best DeFi conference in crypto this year. It is in Austin, Texas, September 11 through 13th. If you've been in crypto for a while, you know that bear market conferences are the best kind of conferences. We have a phenomenal lineup of speakers. A lot of the guests that you hear on Empire are both going to be speaking there.
00:38:31.768 - 00:39:01.870, Speaker B: You will have the opportunity to meet them there. And a lot of the topics that we cover on Empire, ZK tech roll ups, account abstraction, Mev app chain, thesis, a lot of that kind of stuff that will all be discussed at permissionless this year. So because you are a listener of Empire, you get a special discount. That's right. Santi and I negotiated with our marketing team. You get 30% off if you go to blockworks.com forward slash permissionless, Empire 30 is going to get you 30% off your ticket.
00:39:01.870 - 00:39:19.378, Speaker B: Today, when I'm recording this, that's about $300 off your ticket. So type in Empire 30. When buying your permissionless ticket, you get about $300 off. Click the link at the bottom of this episode. It's in the show notes. Do it quickly because prices go up all the time. And if you are going to permissionless, hit me up, let me know.
00:39:19.378 - 00:39:22.294, Speaker B: Shoot me a DM on Twitter. I would love to meet up with you there.
00:39:23.834 - 00:40:20.962, Speaker A: So a couple, couple things that I'd like to get your thoughts on on that point, which is one, the price manipulation of these shares, especially tied to my second question, which is bots. Right. There's a lot of bots out there in Twitter. They will presumably come on this platform and try to snipe and do, and, you know, front run and I'll do all these kind of things. How do you mitigate that or not? Is it some, there's, there's some sort of baked in mechanism to prevent these sort of things or. Yeah, like, what happens if, I don't know, said person, like, you know, that there's, I wonder if like, there's like a way to short these shares. But like, if you know that, like, you know, say you're a soccer player and you're not going to renew your contract or something bad's gonna happen, that, like, you're gonna go from like Manchester united to like Miami or something and like, that's positive or negative.
00:40:20.962 - 00:40:30.694, Speaker A: Like these people might like seller, buy or sell their shares not maybe through their direct account, but like through associates. And so how do you kind of think about all of that?
00:40:32.334 - 00:41:01.194, Speaker C: Yeah, it definitely gets very complex with the price manipulation when it's an individual token. Because obviously I know things about me that nobody else is going to know. Exactly. So I think if you implement something, I don't know, maybe on how individuals trade their shares or individuals close to you trade your shares, that could be possible. I really am not sure. As far as they're anti body mechanisms, they're definitely not in place now. But I think something cool that could be done right now.
00:41:01.194 - 00:41:39.464, Speaker C: Basically, bots are looking for high follower accounts. As soon as they make their accounts on friendsec, they're buying their shares early and then selling as whatever, as the manual people come in. I think one way to counteract that could be to have the early buyers have the shares locked for a certain amount of time. So say you buy the first 50 and it's like while price is under 100, you can't sell until a month later or something. And in that scenario, then bots are probably less likely to game it because they're not going to want to hold for that long instead of just getting the free money on flipping the bonding curve. Yeah, but the price manipulation thing is definitely going to be a. Yeah, I was.
00:41:39.504 - 00:41:54.048, Speaker A: As you were saying that, I was thinking of that, like, you could, if you're the owner, you'd have to stake your amount, and if you want to sell, it's like a ten, b, five, one plan or whatever, where you have to say you're going to click a button. It's like an unbonding period.
00:41:54.136 - 00:41:55.424, Speaker C: Right, right, right.
00:41:55.464 - 00:42:14.044, Speaker A: You initiate the sell or the intent to sell. Everyone sees that. And then you could sell out of it after six days or a certain amount of time period. No, it's not perfect. Maybe there are better mechanisms, but something like that probably feels a little bit fair.
00:42:16.744 - 00:42:21.454, Speaker B: Santa, I think all early markets are manipulated, by the way, you know.
00:42:21.574 - 00:42:23.790, Speaker A: No, like, absolutely, you traded.
00:42:23.822 - 00:42:32.934, Speaker B: You traded defi, and that you were one of the first, like, big defi folks trading in the defi, like that. That was a rigged market until the market gets more liquid. Not, not.
00:42:32.974 - 00:42:34.710, Speaker A: Maybe not rigged, but I want to say rigged.
00:42:34.742 - 00:42:35.150, Speaker C: I would say.
00:42:35.182 - 00:42:45.118, Speaker A: I mean, to liquid. It's more volatile. Yes. No, we're not, like, trading actively on it. Like defi farming. Yeah. If you're the first block or so.
00:42:45.118 - 00:42:58.724, Speaker A: Yeah, of course. Like, the. The yield is much, much higher. You're taking a whole lot more risk. But, yeah, I think there is a distinction between a rigged market and an early illiquid market and price discovery, two different things.
00:43:00.024 - 00:43:29.324, Speaker B: That's fair. Let me just tell you. Maybe my thought on this, Santi, is we're moving to a world where anyone can become a creator, and anyone can become a creator, and anyone can not just become a creator, but like, a true star online. And today we have a world where you can long or short the earnings and valuation and product releases and success of companies. It makes sense that you would be able to do that with people as well. Is this the right way to do this? Maybe. Probably not.
00:43:29.324 - 00:43:42.264, Speaker B: I don't know. Most startups end up dying. This one, mathematically probably, and probabilistically probably dies, too. But, like, it makes sense that, like, as more and more people become creators, you should have a way to bet on these creators, you know?
00:43:42.964 - 00:44:17.304, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, okay, like, I equally thought about this idea where you could bet on the specific individuals within a company. So say that you, like, think about a company like Google. So many different divisions, but, hey, you bet on Google Brain and not bet on other parts of Google, like adwords or whatever, and you could specifically maybe combine LinkedIn and then. And then bet on specific departments within a company. Hey, that'll be kind of interesting, right? So the question. Yeah, I like, I get your point. How is that any different if you're able to do that? If you're betting on.
00:44:17.304 - 00:44:37.366, Speaker A: If a company is a collection of individuals that are creating some sort of output, then this is no different than betting on a company. It's just, it feels kind of very weird that it's at the individual level because people, like, it's no different. It's like. But now you're. It's one step. It's not one step. It's like the.
00:44:37.366 - 00:45:02.302, Speaker A: You're going to the root, right? So it's like, if a company has one employee, then, well, you're basically betting on one person, right? Or if you're betting on a company because of a CEO, then how's that any different than friend tech? So I'm taking the other side of my argument because I'm aware of that. Um, but there's a weird, like, the brain just works in different mechanisms, so.
00:45:02.318 - 00:45:17.006, Speaker B: For companies, it's not different. Like, I like you. Like you investing in blockworks was a bet on Mike and me. Right? Like, you didn't have to buy my share. You bought, like, that's a bet on us. Right. But I think you're seeing a lot of, like, abnormal companies get created these days.
00:45:17.006 - 00:45:28.774, Speaker B: I think, like, the definition of a company was like, you know, maybe you go out and raise some money, but, like, now it might be like you have a music label, and then you're like, mister Beast, and you launch some, like, feast of bowls, chocolates, and, like, it just, it doesn't look normal, I would say.
00:45:28.814 - 00:45:39.564, Speaker A: So I'm conceding is all I'm saying. I'm conceding. To your point. Yes. The future will look very weird as we think about it today. It always does. I'm just.
00:45:39.564 - 00:45:43.144, Speaker A: I'm struggling to get. I'm saying, I'm struggling to see it.
00:45:43.224 - 00:45:44.044, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:45:44.944 - 00:45:50.296, Speaker A: And maybe younger people, like, maybe I'm just an old dog and, like, ansem.
00:45:50.320 - 00:46:23.714, Speaker B: What do you think of the very dystopian view that social tokens create an incentive to cause harm to folks? So, like, let's say you, like, if this was like a real market, you could go long, but you could also go short. And let's say I'm trading at, like, one ETH right now. If you put on a big short on, like, yano tokens, you would like a being like, you extend that out further. Far enough. And you're incentivized to kill me, but you're also incentivized to put out a bad rumor about me to help our competitor to do something like that. What do you think about that kind of dystopian world?
00:46:24.334 - 00:47:13.044, Speaker C: I mean, I think it's real, but I think it also already exists. I think people have, I don't think there's official social tokens, but I do think there's products in crypto and also companies that trade publicly to have really big public figureheads. And other people in those industries are aware that if bad things happen to that person, then bad things will happen to this company and then public perception will change. And it's the same thing in crypto. I think that a lot of, there's some discourse that is skewed in crypto and it's intentionally skewed towards, like, people are talking about project there that are competitors to them and they know that they talk about those projects and, like, they may not be seen in as good of a light and that will make, make them look better. I think that's a thing that already exists. Obviously, it's a lot more direct with individual tokens, but yeah, I think it's.
00:47:14.144 - 00:47:21.012, Speaker A: Prediction to prediction markets are probably more dangerous than, than this, right?
00:47:21.068 - 00:47:21.664, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:47:22.164 - 00:48:08.300, Speaker A: If you put a prediction market on, you know, particular individual becoming president or whatnot, then you could put a bounty on their head. If you're shorting it versus these tokens, like, it's going to get weird. But, like, you're saying that if a person dies and their token is worth less, maybe it's actually could be the inverse. Like, it could be much, much more. Yeah, because then you get memorialized and, like, you become this sort of legend and whatnot. Like, think about a lot of artists that have, like Amy Winehouse or, you know, a bunch of celebrities that have unfortunately passed away and that, like, they just, they're collect like, kobe sneakers or whatever. Like, it just blew up because, you know, he's no longer with us, unfortunately.
00:48:08.300 - 00:48:40.884, Speaker A: So I'm just saying, I think, like, that's the, by the way, this was like, I think in Europe, they don't allow you to short shares, which is like, it creates a sort of perverse incentive to, like, go out and do harm. Some people argue that. I think, like, you know, there's always, like, people that want to do harm, but, like, it's, yeah, it's a bit of a stretch, I think I'm less concerned about that, to be honest. Like, that they don't promote like nefarious or, well, not nefarious, but promote like, you know, evil. I'm less concerned about that.
00:48:43.784 - 00:49:00.814, Speaker B: What do you guys think? So, Santa, you're an investor in blur and Ansem. I'm curious. So one thing we haven't talked about is this airdrop, or like a potential airdrop or something, and like, the points and that whole system, can you just explain how that works? And maybe I'm curious how you think about this in comparison to something like blur.
00:49:03.034 - 00:49:53.190, Speaker C: Yeah, they said they're distributing 100 million points over the next six months. That's the plan. And they said that it will be rewarded in different ways depending on the, the usage that they see in the app, because they don't want it to be game, they don't want it to be sibled. So they said they're like, they reserve the right to change the metrics that they're looking at for distributing points to people. But yeah, I talked about it a little bit the other day. Blur, I think, launched, when it went, when the token launched, it was around three and a half billion fully diluted valuation. So some people have been trying to project out, okay, what if Friendtech launches at 1 billion? How much are they going to Airdrop, how much that's going to be distributed and what price will the token be? Depending on whatever FTV that they launch at? That's a ways out.
00:49:53.190 - 00:50:31.286, Speaker C: But I think it's interesting in that it's probably going to incentivize activity within the application, especially because people already saw how much the Blur airdrop paid out to people. So they kind of have like something to compare to, especially since that was also paradigm. Yeah, I got, I got a lot of points the first week and a lot of people were like, yo, dude, now I need to get on the app. Like, you can literally see where people released their points that Friday and activity skyrocketed as soon as everybody was posting how many points that they got. So it's definitely a good incentive to get people, but we'll see how they avoid it being gamed.
00:50:31.470 - 00:50:44.554, Speaker B: Yeah, I think there's actually a decent comparison with blur. Not only did paradigm lead, I think paradigm led blur to, but, uh. But they both had an. Yeah, but they both had anonymous founders. And I think the Blur founder is a little less anonymous now. But the.
00:50:44.854 - 00:50:49.158, Speaker A: Yeah, the fronteclur was definitely not anonymous. You knew who it was.
00:50:49.326 - 00:50:50.270, Speaker B: Oh, okay.
00:50:50.382 - 00:50:53.034, Speaker A: Just the rest of the world didn't for a while.
00:50:53.654 - 00:50:59.514, Speaker B: Okay, but why do you think the friend tech founders are anonymous. What is the, like, does that concern you at all?
00:51:00.494 - 00:51:30.600, Speaker C: I'm not sure. I mean, I, I would say they're kind of like pseudo anonymous. Cause like, yeah, race is anonymous, but there's a lot of people in CT that know him. Like, know him pretty well. So it's not even like he really was a full anon. And then also there's pancakes, which everybody knows and people who have been to conferences, I've seen him, met him, talk to him, like, I can facetime him, like right now if I wanted to, and talk to him. So there's like some people that are on the team, they're front facing, and I think that helps with the anon concerns.
00:51:30.600 - 00:51:34.464, Speaker C: But, yeah, I wouldn't say it's like fully anon. I think there's people who know them.
00:51:34.624 - 00:51:40.284, Speaker B: Yeah. What do you think about the bit cloud comparison? Like, how do you think of friendtech being different?
00:51:41.904 - 00:52:25.404, Speaker C: My interpretation with bitcoin, I think that UX was extremely clunky and fintech is not the greatest. But I remember with bitcoin, you would deposit, like bitcoin, I think, to bitcoin addresses. Um, and that's how it was. It was traded. And then also with bit cloud, it was like VC's got shares of everything, like at very, like huge discounts immediately when stuff started trading. Whereas with fintech, when you click buy your shares already at zero for everybody and you have the issues with bots, but it's not, it's not the same as somebody else literally having, being up 100 x on all of your buys immediately. I think that was the big difference.
00:52:25.404 - 00:52:52.588, Speaker C: It feels a lot more crypto native from the founders perspective and also from the community perspective, to me, rather than bitcoin did. And people, I think there was a lot of people who liked the idea behind bitcout, but just didn't like the execution. And also, I think it gives opportunity here because there are a ton of people who are like, well, Bitcoin didn't work, so this isn't going to work. So you have a ton of people who are on the negative side, and it's kind of like a, an opportunity there.
00:52:52.716 - 00:53:15.244, Speaker B: Yeah, it feels like the main difference in my mind is one was auto opt in or one was, like, it auto added you, basically. Yeah, bit clouds, basically. Growth hack is like, Santi was auto added to the platform as opposed to. Now, if Santi doesn't want to join the platform, he doesn't have to join the platform. Right. And you can also withdraw. You couldn't withdraw off of Bitcloud you had to do, like, some OTC deal, and now you can.
00:53:15.244 - 00:53:17.344, Speaker B: So those feel like the two big differences to me.
00:53:19.244 - 00:53:40.468, Speaker A: Well, I was just thinking, as you heard us. So there's been a lot of sim swaps of these prominent accounts. Now, of course, if you haven't connected the account, like, if people get a control of your account, you don't have a frantic profile. They're gonna go out and create one and monetize as quickly as possible and then sell all the shares. Right. It just.
00:53:40.516 - 00:53:41.164, Speaker C: Yep.
00:53:41.324 - 00:54:01.884, Speaker A: Just creates a bigger incentive for these things to happen. Um, have there been people that have, like, sold, like, gained prominence or. Price went up a lot. They bought some, and then they sold them all very quickly, effectively rugging all their supporters.
00:54:03.144 - 00:54:05.976, Speaker C: There was one. I forget who it was. It wasn't. It might.
00:54:06.040 - 00:54:08.444, Speaker A: An NFT guy. Right, he saw.
00:54:09.464 - 00:54:44.460, Speaker C: So Ben. Ben Eve had, like, 30 something shares of his, like, by far the largest holder, and he was top five for a while. I don't know how much of how much of them he sold, but, yeah, there's some scenarios where it's like, people see that they are by far the biggest holder and with how the bonding curve is set up, their price. Obviously, their entry is way better than everybody else if they bought them super early. So it's like, why do you have that many shares if your attend is not to dump them pretty hard? And it, like, because of how much trading fees the bigger accounts get? There's really. No, I don't. I wouldn't say, like, there's.
00:54:44.460 - 00:54:58.132, Speaker C: There's less incentive to buy a ton of your shares and be like. And dump them on people than there is to have a good chat and be active and do it in that way, I think that makes more sense. So it's kind of iffy if you buy a ton of your shares.
00:54:58.268 - 00:55:09.944, Speaker A: So if I. If I buy, like, go out and buy ten of your shares, and then six months time, decide to punch out and sell, does that mean you're not gonna talk to me ever again?
00:55:11.564 - 00:55:12.892, Speaker C: No, man will be cool.
00:55:12.948 - 00:55:15.664, Speaker A: Will you punch me if you see me in real life?
00:55:16.124 - 00:55:18.372, Speaker C: As long as you hold one. As long as you hold on to what?
00:55:18.428 - 00:55:19.184, Speaker A: Okay.
00:55:23.604 - 00:55:27.740, Speaker B: And I'm like, oh, dude, this guy sold my share. What the hell? Yeah.
00:55:27.812 - 00:55:28.464, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:55:28.804 - 00:55:39.694, Speaker A: Like. Like, look, I mean, like, we've all gone through this process, folks, where, like, certain people block you, particularly ex girlfriends or whatnot.
00:55:40.674 - 00:55:43.854, Speaker B: I think one of our employees just told me. Damn, that's brutal.
00:55:45.314 - 00:56:33.074, Speaker A: How do you think about all these things, right, where people make financial decisions and you may not know the full context of that. And people have parameters. Again, if you're up ten x, like, you want to manage risk, you want to manage your portfolio, whatever. People have different reasons for why they sell. When you're selling a share of a company and you're on the board, like, or you're close to the founder, then I think it's, again, it's that step removed. It's still a sensitive conversation, but yeah, like, how does this influence your social, like, life and part of that media? Once you have, like, you're seeing the people close to you are selling your shares, buying and selling your shares?
00:56:33.854 - 00:57:16.334, Speaker C: Well, hopefully not too much, but I feel like it already kind of happens in some of these chats and just on Twitter. Like, I know for me, I have a ton of, ton of followers now, so I have people in my replies that are, like, angry all the time or like, negative all the time. That just happens by default. But also, when you're trading on uniswap, if you've been trading, like, these micro caps or low caps the past few months, like, there are certain times where you're trading something and your homie is dumping on you. Like, it's just how it goes with some of these PvP markets. I mean, hopefully, I mean, it definitely is a lot different if it's your individual token, but that's also why some people have their, their alts on there and they're trading through those instead of their public profiles else.
00:57:19.474 - 00:58:49.054, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I mean, like, people dump on their followers and they've been caught, you know, and called out on, you know, but, yeah, I think it's different if they're buying and selling your shares. Yeah, so, so, yeah, see, like, your, your mom goes out and buys like, ten of your, then one day she's like, really mad at you, and then it's like rage quits, dumps everything and then crashes. You're like, what the hell just happened? These are things like I've thought about. Like, they're fascinating, like, things to think about, like, because it forces you to think, okay, how do we, if a company has it different from, like, an individual share or, like, income sharing agreements, like, if you're, I've always found them to be problematic in the sense that, like, who's the oracle? Like, who's reporting however much you make? And, and at some point, are you incentivized to make that incremental career leap or take on more risk or start a new venture? If you're gonna know you're gonna have to be paying, like, 10% of everything that you, like. You're making, like, this is, like, very weird. And sometimes we play around, and I'm all for experimentation, especially around, like, you know, in crypto, historically, it's been, like, in defi, for instance, like, testing new financial primitives and constructs and mechanisms is fascinating from a game theoretical perspective. But.
00:58:49.054 - 00:59:10.704, Speaker A: And it might. People might be critical as I. As I'm. They were listening me say that because, like, wait. Wait a minute. How's that any different? But I think it is with social. And I don't think we sometimes should venture into these things because, like, sometimes, like, social interactions are difficult sometimes, as is, like, when you're introducing another layer of financialization.
00:59:10.704 - 00:59:14.764, Speaker A: I don't think it gets any better, but maybe I'm wrong.
00:59:15.664 - 00:59:35.784, Speaker C: I mean, it's definitely true. There's some people who are adamantly, like, I'm not making an account on the app because I don't. I don't want people buying and selling my shares. I think, like, as Yano says, kind of a difference between Printek and bitcoin is you don't have to make an account if you don't want to. Like, you're not automatically given one if you don't want to opt into it. It's not something that you have to do.
00:59:36.284 - 00:59:43.940, Speaker A: I heard that there were some. Some shops doing perps on individual shares.
00:59:44.132 - 00:59:59.944, Speaker B: Well, you can now, Santa, you can take your shares, and so I'm sure you know way more about this than I do, but I think you can manually take your shares off of friend tech and trade it on something. Like, I think you can create, like, a pool on uniswap and things like that. But, Ansem, what is. Have you looked into this?
01:00:00.424 - 01:00:33.444, Speaker C: I haven't done it for mine, but, yeah, I think the guy, FUBaR, he's like a devil on Twitter. We essentially made some wrapper that allows you to convert your fintech like, shares into a ERc 20 token, then have it be tradable. The issue with that is, obviously, you have to, like, I think if the seed, the LP with whatever, a certain amount for it to not be gamed really easily. I know somebody that did it, and it got, like, bought it super quickly and sold into. I haven't done it for mine, but, yeah, somebody has built that out, and I'm sure other people do similar stuff also.
01:00:34.664 - 01:00:42.164, Speaker B: Yeah. Ansem, how does this change how you. Or, actually, anything else on Friendtech, either Ansem or Santi?
01:00:42.464 - 01:01:10.908, Speaker A: Well, I was gonna ask you guys, the fractionalization. Right? As I, as I was thinking about the scenario of, like, so punks, for instance, have been fractionalized. There's zombies and apes that were fractionalized because, of course, the price tag just got to a point where, like, you, and it allowed people to buy a part of something and feel great, I guess, about it. Anselm, how do you think about, like, your shares are now $3,000? That's fairly expensive. That's higher than the floor of, like, a lot of nft collections.
01:01:11.036 - 01:01:11.508, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:01:11.596 - 01:01:33.574, Speaker A: Especially now as this price continues to grow because, you know, you're prominent. You know, people like you, yada, yada, like, your price goes up. Do you ever, like, are there plans or is there an ability to fractionalize? I guess if you wrap it and then you fractional, like, you could fractionalize and people could buy partial share of that, but they won't have access to your group if you don't own the full share.
01:01:35.034 - 01:02:11.070, Speaker C: Um, although the way I've kind of been thinking about it is I think I already have, like, a free discord, not a free telegram. Um, and I post all my information there. So what I've been planning to do is just continue to put out free content for people. People, and then have some stuff that I share with the smaller group. I'm not really sure about the fractionalizing piece of it. Obviously, if it, if it gets ridiculous, I think it makes sense to do so, but I would, I just want to optimize for putting out the most, like, good quality information for people. This is what I've always done.
01:02:11.070 - 01:02:35.460, Speaker C: So I'm pretty consistent with that. But, yeah, I'm not really sure what the, I'm not sure what the way even to do with it yet because it happened so fast. I honestly didn't even expect it to be, I didn't expect to be that. That high on the leaderboard. So I've been asking, like, the group, like, what do they want to see from it? Like, some people I've met in person, I come to stuff that I'm at in New York. That's cool. But, yeah, I really don't know.
01:02:35.460 - 01:02:36.824, Speaker C: Not don't know yet.
01:02:42.764 - 01:02:50.504, Speaker B: Anselm has this change how you think about the l two trade and, like, just curious how you, how you think about, like, base and arbitrum and optimism.
01:02:51.364 - 01:03:35.404, Speaker C: Yeah, I still like optimism. I like optimism a ton. I think they've done a really good job with their op stack and having people on board through, like, their architecture, especially since base doesn't have a token. Really, the only way to bet on the activity of that l two continue to increase and do well is either through coin the stock, or through op the token. And I like the l two s trade against Ethereum. I think that as EIP 4844 comes around, which is the next several months, and it gets even cheaper to transact on roll ups. I think that the most popular roll ups, their tokens are going to appreciate more so than Ethereum does.
01:03:35.404 - 01:03:53.204, Speaker C: And if we're in a choppy market where bitcoin and ETH aren't really going anywhere, trading in a range, I think that gives you a good trade where you can hedge like short Ethereum and hold whatever l two token where you're seeing increased activity. So I think that's an interesting trade. But yeah, I like op a lot. I think it's a strong play.
01:03:53.624 - 01:04:13.492, Speaker A: What about fraud proofs? Fraud proofs that they don't have them? Yeah, like, what the fuck? Like, you know, somehow accept the fact that, you know, they can. It's actually surprising that they haven't, like, come out with fraud proofs and we're so late into this game.
01:04:13.628 - 01:04:29.828, Speaker C: I think it's surprising from like, it's surprising that it's not talked about as much in the crypto discourse as you guys know. I'm like a huge Solana bull and the Solana guys are like, yo, they don't have fraud. Proves, like, l two s are super centralized. Like, you can do everything better.
01:04:29.916 - 01:04:31.596, Speaker A: Well, optimism doesn't.
01:04:31.740 - 01:04:58.160, Speaker C: Optimum does. Yeah, yeah, right. But I'm saying, like, just generally, the thesis around l two is being more centralized and not as fully built out yet. I think that's valid. But I do think that you also have to factor in when you're taking the trade. It's like, okay, what, what trade offs am I looking for? And I think that the access the coinbase has to all their retail customers is really strong. Like, if you're looking purely from like a trade perspective, then, yeah.
01:04:58.160 - 01:05:00.844, Speaker C: And I have confidence that they will eventually get there.
01:05:01.394 - 01:05:39.858, Speaker A: But yeah, you're talking more of a trade which, which I can see. Like, I think it's a good trade. None of this financial really good. But, but yeah, if you, if you want. I mean, it's hugely bullish. And people should go listen to the base episodes with Jesse because I think from an onboarding perspective, it's huge because you have access to what is home, you know, 100 million. Yeah, hundred, 2 million plus, you know, total registered users, 10 million actives of Coinbase like, if a fraction of that gets onboarded, and it's fairly easy to get onboarded with this flow, then, yeah, it could be positive.
01:05:39.858 - 01:05:40.574, Speaker A: Sure.
01:05:42.514 - 01:05:52.162, Speaker B: Very curious to see if Coinbase ends up talking about, about base in their next earnings call or like, how much they end up talking about base. I don't know when their next earnings call is. Probably two months or so.
01:05:52.298 - 01:06:19.918, Speaker A: I read recently a JP Morgan report, which, by the way, I think they've been doing a fair job of covering it over the last couple of years. They talk about base and they talk. Yeah. So, like, I would say, like, financial analysts don't properly understand, I think, the base, but some actually at least understand that it is impactful for an onboarding perspective and, like, getting people to use these things more so than ever.
01:06:19.966 - 01:06:20.174, Speaker B: Right.
01:06:20.214 - 01:07:10.314, Speaker A: Because they just, they're the gateway into, into this whole world. Jason, I want to ask you a question, because I appreciate you've been asking most of the questions, but, like, you tweeted earlier that you've seen terrible takes and that this is why we're having this episode, because you felt that it sounded like you felt that a lot of people just had horrible takes about friend tech and you wanted to clarify a bunch of stuff. I don't know if we've done a good job here or if you were sub tweeting at me, which I haven't been negatively or anything about this. I came in here telling you that I was gonna take the opposite side because I. Yeah, I'm just concerned I haven't onboarded. But what have you seen out there that made you tweet that? That you felt that was a terrible take or was not properly understood by folks about friend tech.
01:07:11.214 - 01:08:12.720, Speaker B: I think it's less that there were terrible tweets and it's more that, um, coming out of ECC, if you remember all the thread ors threading around, that it's all infrastructure being built and that we need consumer. And this is the most popular consumer app we've had in crypto. And I don't know, a couple of years. It feels like probably since Opensea and NFTs in 2021. And I just think that what a product looks like in month one is never what it looks like in year one or in year two, and that things change a lot and that, like, I think a lot of people that I've seen who maybe aren't, like, super crypto native, I think a lot of very, very, very crypto native people just kind of, like, jumped into friendtech because they know that the one of the best ways to make money in crypto usually is like, playing around with new things and, like, bridging over to the new l two and, like, playing around with this weird Dex and, like, that's. I'm just, like, accustomed to doing that. But I think a lot of people maybe on the, like, on the outskirts of crypto are very, very, very pessimistic.
01:08:12.720 - 01:08:49.408, Speaker B: And they like to complain a lot that we dont have x, Y and z. But now that we have some weird iteration of what a consumer crypto app looks like, I feel like the Pitchforks came out. Whereas I do think that, and I get it because Bitcloud and SPF and Mashinsky and were coming off some, a couple of bad years. I just think that it's a good time to be optimistic and think about what products could turn into instead of just bringing out the pitchforks right away. Santa, I think you've approached it from a very healthy perspective. Look, I'm not using it yet. Here's why.
01:08:49.408 - 01:09:11.234, Speaker B: Let me get on a podcast and talk about it and really figure it out. And I don't think you're going to use it ever. And that's totally fine. What I don't like is people who've never played with it don't ask any questions and just think it's bit cloud 2.0, because, like, that's not how the industry progresses. You need to build risky things to move an industry forward. That's my take.
01:09:11.574 - 01:09:19.754, Speaker A: That's a good take, by the way. You want to hear something interesting? So Nvidia is up, like 7% today, which is a third of each market cap.
01:09:21.374 - 01:09:22.062, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:09:22.198 - 01:09:39.896, Speaker A: Like, it is up 6% and it's a third of Ethereum's market cap. Like, it's a reminder, like, okay, people might argue that this is a terrible take and yada, yada, but it is, like, surprising to me sometimes when, like, like, you know, the crypto market is just very, very, very small in my mind.
01:09:40.040 - 01:09:40.764, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:09:41.664 - 01:10:30.946, Speaker A: And, like, I'm very much an optimist. And if this is what experimentation and onboarding looks like, then okay, like, so be it. You know, the future always looks weird, and it feels weird now to me to be betting on people. But another part of my brain does not see it as any different than buying a share in a company, particularly if you're only buying that chair because you love Steve Jobs or Elon Musk or the Google guys or mark Zuckerberg or whatever. And I think investing in early stage, as I'm hearing me be critical of something that I'm not using. Well, yeah, it's betting on people. It's just weird that you're seeing it.
01:10:30.946 - 01:10:39.434, Speaker A: 24 7365. And your friends sell your shapes. Yeah, I just, it's that edge that I, uh.
01:10:39.594 - 01:10:41.538, Speaker C: Yeah, it is weird. It is weird.
01:10:41.626 - 01:10:42.154, Speaker A: It's weird.
01:10:42.194 - 01:10:43.338, Speaker C: But I think that's where the market.
01:10:43.426 - 01:10:51.986, Speaker B: Going in general is. Like, if you buy, so like buying a stock, buying a share of Nvidia, for example, use buying a share in the stock market used to represent.
01:10:52.050 - 01:10:55.694, Speaker A: You just say Nvidia. I'm sorry, what is Nvidia?
01:10:56.714 - 01:10:58.654, Speaker B: And I don't know how you pronounce it.
01:11:00.674 - 01:11:01.594, Speaker C: What is Nvidia?
01:11:01.634 - 01:11:14.978, Speaker B: I'm like Nvidia. I don't know who had the trade of the year. You watch, you watch the stone conference, Druckenmiller gets on, there he goes. I'm not recommending anything, I'm not sharing any my trades. The one thing I'm telling you that I am buying and loading up on is Nvidia.
01:11:15.146 - 01:11:21.414, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay, so thought experiment. What if drunken Miller like creates it to Twitter and then friends?
01:11:21.874 - 01:11:24.154, Speaker C: It makes a friend set that would.
01:11:24.194 - 01:11:26.698, Speaker A: Make me actually register on the platform if I could get access.
01:11:26.746 - 01:11:56.856, Speaker B: Tony, I will say though, Santi, let me finish that last thought, which is the stock market used to represent two things. It represented access to cash flows. Companies would give back big dividends. It used to be like 40, 30% and got lower. And it used to represent ownership, voting rights. But if you look at a lot of the biggest companies in the S and P today, when you buy a share of meta, you dont get either of those things. Zuck controls with ten to one the voting rights and they have no dividends.
01:11:56.856 - 01:12:17.920, Speaker B: So the stock market has essentially become just this kind of speculative game. And thats totally fine, I think. But it doesnt represent what it used to represent, which is this tangible thing that were talking about. When you go to a basketball game and you get the net or something, I think a lot of the markets are no longer tangible things. Speculative things that represent where consumer attention is going.
01:12:18.072 - 01:13:26.144, Speaker A: Yeah, well, let me be clear. I think you get some very tangible benefit, it sounds like, to get access to, you know, a direct line of communication to someone that otherwise wouldn't be responding to you or you wouldn't have access to. That's feels very tangible to me. Now, I'm not saying that whether and how much value that has, well, that's for the market to decide, obviously. And that may not be, to your point, the only reason why, like, it's hard to understand why these worth these things are worth anything, or stocks for that matter. Like, is it because of cash flow or because of momentum or because of a wide variety of reasons? Well, it's really hard to parse out the different components, but, you know, because it sounds like there's a lot of people that their share price, their, their individual prices worth a lot, but they're not very active in their chat and others are really active in their chat, but their shares might not be worth as much. So it's kind of hard, right, to make some sort of like one size fits all for why things are worth or shares are worth in frontech, but interesting nonetheless.
01:13:26.144 - 01:13:41.884, Speaker A: So let me ask you a question as we kind of sounds like we're nearing here the end of the episode, but I'm curious, who do you think is going to be the majority of one? Does a major celebrity, like, get on boarded in the next week or two? And if so, who. Who is that?
01:13:44.984 - 01:13:49.120, Speaker C: I think we're gonna have a rapper on. Honestly, I feel like. I feel like there.
01:13:49.192 - 01:13:50.204, Speaker A: That's not a major.
01:13:54.744 - 01:14:25.744, Speaker C: I think a rapper won't be and all be pretty cool. Anybody in music, I think that, like, they have that. That strong feel fan base that they see and know people will pay extra because they already sell concert tickets, they like sell signing sites, stuff like that. So I think that makes sense as an industry that would pay for something like this, access to something like this. And you kind of already seen some, like, disclosure. Wow. So I think you've kind of already seen some examples, but yeah, I think it's independent.
01:14:26.344 - 01:14:28.032, Speaker B: Yeah, it's gotta be someone independent.
01:14:28.128 - 01:14:32.044, Speaker A: The record labels might have a different view and perspective on this.
01:14:33.464 - 01:14:35.616, Speaker C: Yeah, they might want to cut of those. Those fees.
01:14:35.720 - 01:14:42.792, Speaker B: Someone weird that it's someone weird. It's always someone weird. Like, remember when Brady turned on laser eyes back in 2021? Yeah.
01:14:42.848 - 01:14:45.204, Speaker C: I was like, what? I was like, what is going on?
01:14:46.504 - 01:14:54.480, Speaker B: You know what? You know, I tweeted at him, said you should turn on laser eyes and Photoshop the lasers, and he turned and he took my pic and turned it on. What?
01:14:54.632 - 01:14:58.524, Speaker C: That's crazy. That's deep. That's deep lore, bro. Yeah.
01:14:59.624 - 01:15:01.144, Speaker B: They quietly took them off.
01:15:01.304 - 01:15:06.604, Speaker A: I'll go buy your shares just because. Yeah.
01:15:08.544 - 01:15:09.284, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:15:10.384 - 01:15:20.364, Speaker A: If you're the founders, one of the founders sounds like there's five. What would be the first product feature upgrade that you would do?
01:15:21.044 - 01:16:12.730, Speaker C: Definitely. Photos and videos, 100%. Like, allow people to record videos where they're talking, answering questions, allow people to send photos they can, like, send charts and stuff like that. I don't know about files, maybe files for like music artists, but yeah, I think like media is pretty big. And then after that, I would say right now the chat is fully one sided, so people send messages and only the owner of the chat can see all of them. But if you're in the chat, you can only see the owner's messages and the owner has to like manually quote, tweet everybody's replies if they want to include them in the rest of the conversation. So I think there should be a way to toggle the messages that you want other people to see or like some easy way to make the owner, quote, tweet them instead of having to manually copy paste those.
01:16:12.730 - 01:16:16.014, Speaker C: I would say those are the two main things I would focus on adding first.
01:16:17.694 - 01:16:53.834, Speaker A: Yeah, those feels like pretty key upgrades. On the question of NFTs in general, how do you think friend tech changes the game for monetization of fan base and attention? Going down this route versus issuing your own NFT collection, do you see them as like a derivative of or mutually exclusive? Are you more bullish on one versus the other?
01:16:55.254 - 01:17:15.632, Speaker C: I see them as complimentary. I think that they're going to be creators that launch NFT collections associated with their chat rooms. And the time, time aspect of them I think will be really cool. Like say you have somebody who's holding your share for a month or two months or three months, you have an NFT evolve with how long they've been holding your share. I think that feels key.
01:17:15.808 - 01:17:26.408, Speaker A: Yeah, like long term to your point. Jason. Hey, you not only discovered me, but you've held the bag through and throw for the last ten years. Not you just like sniped it and dumped it.
01:17:26.576 - 01:17:58.554, Speaker C: Exactly. But I do think that some NFT projects that are purely just profile pictures and haven't really delivered that much value back to their communities. I think those may fall away because there's a lot more right now. There's more strong teams, not just frontech, but also stronger teams that are iterating heavier on, like the membership royalties, that side of things, and how really to build stronger communities instead of just having the pure JPEG. So I do think those kind of continue to not do as well there.
01:18:00.734 - 01:18:02.234, Speaker B: Santi, man, you joining.
01:18:05.294 - 01:18:07.274, Speaker C: Right now, man, so I can buy your shares.
01:18:10.574 - 01:18:54.558, Speaker A: I was, before this episode, I, I was thinking of doing it, but I will resist the urge for now, partially because there's a whole host of things in need. Like doing it on mobile is difficult. Like, I feel like I know you can do it on your browse, like, desktop browser, like, if you enable mobile stuff. So, anyways, am I more inclined to do it after this discussion? No, but it's been interesting discussion. It's too distracting, man. I just. I'll stay in my lane this time.
01:18:54.558 - 01:19:04.094, Speaker A: Time around, guys. And I'm going to be proven wrong and lose out on a bunch of money, quote, unquote. But, uh, like, no, I'm not.
01:19:04.954 - 01:19:11.734, Speaker B: No, ansem, I'm looking at the fees right now. You made 30 ETH from this thing already?
01:19:12.874 - 01:19:28.360, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm already at, like, yeah, 30. 30. And Kobe's at, like, crazy. Yeah, that's always. Yeah, but, like, that's what I'm saying. The incentives, I'm not anybody outside of crypto. The incense are people who are actually celebrities, like, big artists.
01:19:28.360 - 01:19:34.244, Speaker C: If they see that, then they're gonna, like, obviously want to at least check it out. That's what I. My whole thought process.
01:19:37.864 - 01:19:40.844, Speaker A: What are you gonna do with that? Run a validator?
01:19:44.944 - 01:19:46.004, Speaker C: Yeah, run it.
01:19:48.534 - 01:19:49.514, Speaker A: Good to go.
01:19:51.774 - 01:19:53.326, Speaker B: All right, guys, well, this has been great.
01:19:53.390 - 01:20:00.434, Speaker A: At least this. Jason, that was a perfect layup for you to say with that part of that money, you can go to permissionless in a couple of weeks.
01:20:01.934 - 01:20:05.354, Speaker B: The last couple of weeks. Ansem, are you coming to permissionless, man?
01:20:05.814 - 01:20:09.750, Speaker C: I've been thinking about it. It's in Austin, right? It's in Texas, right?
01:20:09.902 - 01:20:15.910, Speaker A: You just made 30 ETH. Like, what's up? Stuff the crap.
01:20:16.102 - 01:20:21.914, Speaker B: Yeah. I'm gonna try to not even sell you a ticket. I'm trying to sell you a sponsorship over here. Use that. You got that sponsorship money now.
01:20:22.614 - 01:20:24.794, Speaker C: I'll give it away to my shareholders, bro.
01:20:26.654 - 01:20:40.890, Speaker A: Nice. Gentlemen. Well, keep having fun. Wait, what's your latest for. So we timestamp this? How many shares and what's your value today? And Simon, yours, Yanuki?
01:20:40.942 - 01:20:42.338, Speaker C: I don't have it up where. What am I at?
01:20:42.386 - 01:20:44.454, Speaker B: Answer Ansem's 150.
01:20:44.834 - 01:20:46.574, Speaker A: Pretend like he doesn't have it.
01:20:49.154 - 01:21:03.934, Speaker B: Right here. Yeah. No, he's at 150 holders and 1.75. I will say something. The app is so miserably slow. This is the screen I'm on for. Just, like, super slow.
01:21:03.934 - 01:21:05.054, Speaker B: There.
01:21:05.434 - 01:21:06.228, Speaker C: There goes.
01:21:06.306 - 01:21:10.644, Speaker B: I'm at 41 holders .15 ETH.
01:21:13.104 - 01:21:17.560, Speaker A: Wow. So you're, like, nothing getting combined. I made one.
01:21:17.592 - 01:21:20.800, Speaker B: I've made one ETH, though. Look at that. Made. I made one ETH.
01:21:20.992 - 01:21:30.136, Speaker A: You're worth one 30th of what this fine gentleman is. I'm just going to leave it at that. Okay, you go one 11th.
01:21:30.200 - 01:21:31.484, Speaker B: One 11th. Oh, man.
01:21:31.924 - 01:21:33.252, Speaker C: About the buy shares. Right?
01:21:33.308 - 01:21:35.584, Speaker B: Lemon 111.
01:21:36.604 - 01:21:45.748, Speaker A: Well, there's two ways to look at that. One, you're absolutely worthless. Or two, there's a lot of room to grow and you're up, and it's a mispricing.
01:21:45.796 - 01:21:46.984, Speaker C: It's a mispricing.
01:21:47.284 - 01:21:50.224, Speaker B: I'm infinitely more valuable than you are. So.
01:21:52.244 - 01:21:57.652, Speaker A: Well, without folks, I'm going to tune out and go talk to my therapist. Thanks, everyone, for listening.
01:21:57.788 - 01:21:59.964, Speaker B: Good, Podge. See you guys. Next one.
