00:00:00.400 - 00:00:30.690, Speaker A: This episode is brought to you by the Chronicle protocol, a cost efficient, transparent and decentralized oracle. Chronicle has developed a next generation oracle primitive called Scribe which reduces Oracle gas fees on l one s and l two s by over 60%. You'll hear more about Chronicle later in the show. All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Empire. We've got Rom, CEO and co founder of Lumina wealth, joining us. Rom, welcome to the show, man.
00:00:30.842 - 00:00:32.826, Speaker B: Thank you for having me. Big fan of the show.
00:00:32.970 - 00:01:17.452, Speaker A: Glad to hear it. So it's funny, so we were talking earlier before we recorded about kind of frauds within frauds and the blockworks website. Someone created this duplicate blockworks website and put up this fake news story, but to do that, they had to do another thing and frauds within frauds. And we are using this episode to talk about a potential other fraud within a fraud, which is genesis, DCG, and everything that is kind of unfolding as we see it today. I think a lot of eyes are on this SPF trial right now, but you've been shedding a lot of light on Twitter on what's happening with DCG, Genesis, Barry Silbert and the like. So maybe you could just set up this conversation with the cast of characters, basically. And really what I'm curious about is, like, who owns what and how does the money flow, and then we can drive this conversation forward.
00:01:17.628 - 00:01:46.174, Speaker B: Terrific. It starts off with a digital currency group founded by Barry Silver. It's a blue chip storied institution, and DCG has a number of subsidiaries. The main character there being Genesis. Genesis is a prime broker. They extend loans against digital assets. DCG also owns Grayscale, which is the issuer of Grayscale, bitcoin trust, GBTC.
00:01:46.174 - 00:01:51.414, Speaker B: DCG also owns Coindesk and has investments in dozens of startup companies.
00:01:54.114 - 00:01:54.706, Speaker C: Cool.
00:01:54.810 - 00:02:05.242, Speaker A: Perfect. Easy. So take us into when you first started to get kind of spidey senses that this was not unfolding in the right way.
00:02:05.418 - 00:02:05.898, Speaker C: Sure.
00:02:05.986 - 00:02:49.242, Speaker B: Well, I'll start by saying, like, I'm a creature of the financial crisis. I graduated school in the 2001 recession. The reason why that matters is that a lot of what we see crypto doing today is speedrunning history. And what we saw in 2008 was non banks pretending to be banks. So you had companies like General Electric funding via commercial paper markets and borrowing short and funding these long duration assets and investment banks were doing the same thing. That was really the pattern match to the present day Celsius and Blockfi and Genesis. I was looking at that.
00:02:49.242 - 00:03:17.110, Speaker B: I said, oh, the pattern is back. It's non banks pretending to be banks. And this pattern happens roughly every ten years, by the way. It happened in 2001, too. So that was once I was primed to spot this, if you will. And previous to Lumita, I was the head of crypto at Crossroad, which is a bank. And so in that capacity, I wanted to extend loans on digital assets.
00:03:17.110 - 00:04:17.742, Speaker B: Except when you're a bank, you have FDIC insurance, you've got a lender of last resort, you've got the risk management systems, you've got the counterparty risk systems in place to do it responsibly. We couldn't find any good loans to make because of just the weaknesses in the underwriting and not being able to, quote, perfect your security interest when you make a loan. And so that's what oriented me towards these issues. And then when Mike Morrow, I believe it was early July of 21, said, we, quote unquote, shed the risk, I replied in his tweet there, I said, how exactly did you sell the loan and recognize an impairment on your balance sheet? Did you write a CDs transaction, which ultimately means you're paying for the fair value of the losses? How exactly did it happen? And there was no clear answer to that innocuous question. Coming just from a place of curiosity, was trying to understand what happened. And thats when I said, something doesnt make sense here. And I stayed on the hunt, Preston.
00:04:17.918 - 00:05:08.060, Speaker A: So one thing thats become really obvious now, looking back in hindsight, is the interconnectedness of capital markets and crypto. And at the heart of all of this connectedness, oftentimes was this widowmaker trade was GBTC. Right. So GBTC, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, was one of the first regulated entities that allowed ordinary investors to get bitcoin price exposure. And over time, over years, trust turns into this behemoth, and there becomes all these kind of players and funds and actually companies as well, making these big, massive leveraged bets on GBTC. And that turned into what is known today as the widowmaker trade. I think it would be helpful if you could almost set up what is the widowmaker trade, and how did that lead to a lot of the things that were seeing today?
00:05:08.252 - 00:05:49.514, Speaker B: Great question. Heres the background. As you pointed out, GBTC had a premium to the nav of the underlying bitcoin. And it was a trade that motivated players like blockfi and hedge funds like three arrows capital to do the following sequence. They would buy bitcoinspot, and then they would notify grayscale. Their intention to deliver that. And that trade would enable them to lock in the spread between the traded price of GBTC versus the NAv, and that premium was 20% to 50%.
00:05:49.514 - 00:06:29.236, Speaker B: That trade just for blockfi, made well over $100 million. And that's just one entity. So three rs capital and others at the same thing, it's a form of a carry trade, because you can't edge out your risk. You are taking risk that the spread is stable and at least remains positive. So now, as Coinbase was approaching its IPO, that spread started to narrow to zero and then flipped to negative. And that kind of makes sense, because Coinbase is an alternative way to mainstream access to digital assets. So that spread flip to negative, it fell down to 10% to 20%.
00:06:29.236 - 00:07:14.804, Speaker B: Discount, Nav. So now hedge funds like 3 hours capital said, hey, we believe this discount is going to close. And they and other hedge funds started buying that discount. Now where it went wrong is three years capital was borrowing from genesis to execute that trade. So they had a levered carry trade position that was put on. And of course, the demise of Luna and then with spreads blowing out further, caused €3 capital to default. And that set in chain a series of dominoes that led us to where we are today.
00:07:15.904 - 00:07:18.304, Speaker A: DCG. Oh, go ahead, Santi.
00:07:18.464 - 00:08:03.578, Speaker D: I was just curious, Ram. I mean, there's a lot of people that, again, in hindsight, say, hey, why were you even lending unsecured or, you know, under collateralized or no collateral? Why did three arrows get such special treatment? I mean, I, at the time, was a paraphy. You know, I even now is, you know, most of these loans for the vast majority of players are heavily collateralized. At what point did you in your capacity back then or even today? Like, how did standards become so loose? Because this happens in every market, not just in crypto. But why did 3 hours specifically get. Sounds like they got some pretty special.
00:08:03.626 - 00:08:26.542, Speaker B: I have no idea. I mean, the standards were awful. It's not as if it tightened and loosened over time. They started a baseline level of awful. So when we were at Cross river, we interviewed all of these firms as well, because, again, I'm a bank. Like, how do I give warehouse lending to others? How do I lend to the lender in a senior secured position? And I'll give you an example. I spoke to Celsius.
00:08:26.542 - 00:08:46.156, Speaker B: It was a 30 minutes call. After that call, I told my team, we will never, ever issue a loan to Celsius. We didn't even done any diligence. It was the initial 30 minutes call where they're putting their best foot forward. But you could see that they were acting like hedge funds, and that's what's fundamentally flaw here. So I'm not sure. Look, you have massive, concentrated positions.
00:08:46.156 - 00:09:12.834, Speaker B: You saw those genesis two. They had a massive concentrated loan, not just against €3 capital, but also against Alameda. I think part of it, Santee, is trust. They said, oh, these guys are blue chip players. They know what they're doing. And then you also had these round trip equity investments. So remember, Blockfi had an equity investment from FTX, and Blockfi was also financing FTX.
00:09:12.834 - 00:09:16.526, Speaker B: So I think that was a part of it.
00:09:16.710 - 00:09:52.674, Speaker D: Yeah. Okay, well, let's move on now into kind of how this all kind of unfolded. And I think you were at the time kind of sounded the alarm fairly early on. And as this was going down, the, the market was already very skittish because road FTX had already transpired. And so the skepticism when Mauro, which was the CEO, I think, of Genesis, started saying, hey, our balance sheet, anytime now, the market balance sheet is strong. It's sort of like. It's definitely not.
00:09:52.754 - 00:09:54.794, Speaker A: Your balance sheet is not strong, my friend.
00:09:54.914 - 00:10:17.162, Speaker D: This is sort of like the. But the market was learning back then. But I think you were very much in that conversation and asking Genesis to provide more straightforward answers. Now we have the complaint, and in hindsight, a lot of the things that you were talking about back then turned out to be true. It made a lot of sense. So walk us through kind of all that flow and how that.
00:10:17.298 - 00:10:55.916, Speaker B: Sure. In July, there was no smoking gun. I was just asking those questions out of curiosity. Even in November, after Barry Silbert published his letter to investors in general, my approach was deferential, and I was taking them at face value, although things still didn't make any sense, namely, where was the impairment if you have a loss, that takes it to a balance sheet? And that question was never answered. So I stayed on that question. Then, over time, my attitude and perception of DCG changed. So November, my view was, yeah, these guys will raise the money, they'll fill the hole, and they'll move on.
00:10:55.916 - 00:11:50.344, Speaker B: They've got great assets, and Grace goes a cash machine. And when we did not see those answers, and then they started to play word games with terms like current account hiding behind technical word salads, then my skepticism started to deepen as it doesn't make any sense. And now, of course, here we are. The nyagi has filed a complaint against DCG and Barry Silver personally, as well as Gemini, and they validated actually those hypotheses which we never really knew for sure. And it was great that. It was definitely satisfying to see that. But I'll tell you this, when you make a public observation that could jeopardize someone's business, you are taking the risk of being that accused of defamation.
00:11:50.344 - 00:12:02.944, Speaker B: So, I mean, I took. I don't take satisfaction calling those issues out, but it was satisfying to see the NYEG say, yeah, here's what happened. It looked like a recap of all these twitter threads have been writing for such a long time.
00:12:04.244 - 00:12:11.804, Speaker D: And just to conceptualize this, which we talked about on a prior episode, the gap was roughly 1.1 billion.
00:12:11.924 - 00:12:12.584, Speaker C: Correct.
00:12:13.644 - 00:12:18.604, Speaker D: That genesis was in the hole because largely because of three arrows. This widow trade.
00:12:18.724 - 00:12:19.292, Speaker B: Correct.
00:12:19.428 - 00:12:54.632, Speaker D: And the Barry. At the time, as a CEO of this holding company, DCG had a few options. One was personally guarantee it, plug the hole. He's probably worth a couple billion back then, I don't know how much now. But, you know, he's done incredibly successful for himself. He has multiple other business lines. You could take a view on the stream of Greyscale, which is a golden goose, and, like, use some of that to, you know, go to someone like Apollo, some hedge fund, some venture fund, and say, hey, guys, we're in a tight spot.
00:12:54.632 - 00:12:59.072, Speaker D: We need some rescue financing. Help us through, get. Survive this patch.
00:12:59.208 - 00:12:59.696, Speaker B: Right.
00:12:59.800 - 00:13:39.870, Speaker D: He didn't do any of that. He basically just pretended to plug the hole through a promissory note that had 1% interest and repayable and sort of like, what is it? Like, ten years or something like that, which was intended, really to dress it up and not in. Provide a false sense that the balance sheet was sound, but it wasn't the case. As we now learned specifically to a complaint. Before we even dive into all of the mechanics, let me ask you, if you're in Barry's situation, what would you have done then and there?
00:13:39.982 - 00:14:32.644, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a phenomenal question. I've actually been trying to sort that out. My first reaction was to say, certainly after the demise of €3 capital, when Genesis clearly had a negative equity position that's come out now, would have been to let Genesis default and go into bankruptcy. Genesis was a subsidiary that was fully owned, but they could have horn off the liabilities, and that's that. But here's what we learned in the NYG complaint. What we learned is that DCG and Barry himself was personally directing Genesis refinance its loans. And therefore, the reason I allege that DCG did not let Genesis just go into bankruptcy and protect the mothership is because then Genesis would have called in the loans and not refinanced DCG, and DCG didn't have the cash.
00:14:32.644 - 00:15:30.442, Speaker B: Right. So that was a puzzle that finally was answered last week. Now, let's back up from there, like, well, how do you avoid having been in that position? Like, what's the Met? What's the root cause learning? The root cause learning would be to not do the widowmaker trade, not to borrow from Genesis, to go levered long on your own product, believing your own b's that the discount's going to close. Now, could Barry have foreseen the demise of three years capital, which was considered a blue chip hedge fund, much less the demise of Alameda and FTX, which were considered blue chip by world class vc's? Hindsight's 2020, right? Nevertheless, it's just bad judgment. Here's another interesting story. I heard this from an informed party that worked for Burry, and he said that Barry's vision was to build the next Berkshire Hathaway. They had the cash power and grayscale, and they're funding new investments and build a modern Berkshire Hathaway.
00:15:30.442 - 00:15:51.994, Speaker B: And Berkshire Hathaway is actually a carry trade. They borrow. That's what they do, right? They borrow. They have debt that's outstanding well over $100 billion in debt, and they buy assets with that. They get the depreciation off the debt, and it's a carry trade. The difference is this. Berkshire Hathaways loans are, one, theyre non callable.
00:15:51.994 - 00:16:21.364, Speaker B: Two, theyre investing in assets that generate cash flow to help to pay down the debt. And theyre great assets that they own. Whereas what Barry was doing was a margin trade. Buffett never does a margin trade. He had a good concept and built an extraordinary business, especially around Grayscale. But whether ego or believing, other people around him, and he himself arguably was deceived by 3 hours capital on FTX. Of course he was.
00:16:21.364 - 00:16:23.208, Speaker B: Yep, they've been deceived.
00:16:23.256 - 00:16:49.782, Speaker D: So, for listeners, the real key here is Barry personally. I forget if it's personally or DC. At the DCG level, did this care, did this carry trade, meaning, like, playing the spread at the DC level, for sure, at the DCG level. And because of that, had he not done that, then you could have just put Genesis and receivership, but go through bankruptcy or plug the hole yourself.
00:16:49.878 - 00:16:50.342, Speaker C: That's it.
00:16:50.398 - 00:16:57.358, Speaker B: Yeah, Genesis would just go through bankruptcy, and they could create a new genesis a year later if they wanted to, but didn't.
00:16:57.526 - 00:17:02.054, Speaker A: DCG didn't have the cash, so they needed Genesis. They needed Genesis here.
00:17:02.094 - 00:17:04.622, Speaker B: That's why they didn't let Genesis go into bankruptcy.
00:17:04.718 - 00:17:04.998, Speaker C: Right.
00:17:05.046 - 00:17:06.510, Speaker A: Because they needed the cash.
00:17:06.702 - 00:17:07.790, Speaker B: Because. Right.
00:17:07.942 - 00:17:09.834, Speaker A: Refinance themselves, basically.
00:17:10.014 - 00:17:15.010, Speaker B: Right. Because Genesis would have pressured DCG into bankruptcy. They would have called in their loans.
00:17:15.202 - 00:17:15.974, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:17:17.154 - 00:17:24.058, Speaker A: So they bought. Oh, if Genesis had gone into bankruptcy, DCG then loses control of DCG or something.
00:17:24.146 - 00:17:33.546, Speaker B: Exactly. Because a trustee would take over Genesis. Like if a trustee now and the trustee of the fiduciary obligation to maximize recoveries for the creditors.
00:17:33.730 - 00:17:34.050, Speaker C: Right.
00:17:34.082 - 00:17:46.370, Speaker B: So when Genesis is not in bankruptcy, then Barry can control Genesis. That's why in July, he did not let Genesis go into bankruptcy. That's why I alleged my hypothesis might be wrong. I believe that's the right answer, though.
00:17:46.402 - 00:17:47.050, Speaker C: Right.
00:17:47.242 - 00:18:02.854, Speaker B: He said if you can control Genesis, then he can issue orders. And he did. That's what the Nig complaint shows, that Barry Silbert personally directed Genesis to refinance his loans, and he set loan terms. That's self dealing.
00:18:03.354 - 00:18:04.134, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:18:05.564 - 00:18:11.484, Speaker A: Tell us more about that. So there's this $1.1 billion promissory note. Why is that so problematic here?
00:18:11.604 - 00:18:31.008, Speaker B: Here's why. So the messaging from Genesis and its executives and from Barry in the summer of last year was that DCG was going to save the day. DCG put its balance sheet on the line and, quote, unquote, assume certain liabilities, end quote.
00:18:31.116 - 00:18:31.696, Speaker C: Okay.
00:18:31.800 - 00:18:57.206, Speaker B: Meaning they ate the three year's capital losses. That was a message designed to reassure the public and reassure Genesis customers. Okay. But now what the NAg NYAG complaint shows is that Barry and other executives are making comments such as, we cannot let the public, our customers, understand that we have a solvency issue.
00:18:57.400 - 00:18:58.258, Speaker C: Okay.
00:18:58.426 - 00:19:33.886, Speaker B: So the promissory note was a dissection. When you want to bail out a subsidiary, what do you do? You inject capital if there is an impairment? I mean, an impairment is when you have a write down of assets on your balance sheet. And now Genesis has negative equity. Last summer, the only way to fill that negative equity hole is to have an equity infusion. That's the only way to do that. And the promissory note did not do that. In fact, the promissory note borrowed from Genesis at favorable terms.
00:19:33.886 - 00:20:00.054, Speaker B: Now, they didn't borrow digital offsets, at least in that financing, but it was really a shell game as a way to swap out this bad asset that Genesis had on its balance sheet to three arrows capital with this good asset called a loan to DCG. So it did strengthen, technically, the balance sheet of Genesis. But the promissory notes primary purpose was to deceive the public and its customers.
00:20:00.634 - 00:20:07.578, Speaker A: It replaced the lie, as it says here in the NYAG thing, it replaced the liability with this illiquid ten year promissory note.
00:20:07.626 - 00:20:29.474, Speaker B: Correct. And that promissory note, well, what's the present value of the promissory note? It's not even equal to the size of the hole on the balance sheet. If you take a $1.1 billion loan that's not liquid, payable in ten years, that's worth 1% interest rate, you present value discount that at DCG's credit risk. I got something like $250 million in chain. But the hole is $1.1 billion.
00:20:29.474 - 00:20:33.834, Speaker B: Right. So it's a fiction that was designed to deceive.
00:20:35.014 - 00:20:44.252, Speaker D: Yeah. Do you have a sense for the magnitude in the cash position that DCG was back then? Because they were doing this widow trade?
00:20:44.388 - 00:21:02.580, Speaker B: So that's all private information. Clearly, they didn't have the funds, and that has been made clear through the NYAG report. But we know that they shoveled over $760 million in the GBTC widowmaker carry trade.
00:21:02.652 - 00:21:03.540, Speaker C: Think about that.
00:21:03.692 - 00:21:27.124, Speaker B: So they had a lot of cash, but running up to the three arrows capital demise every quarter, they were doing that trade with their free cash flow. It's nuts. They took this great business, DCG, and they bet on their own product, the GPTC.
00:21:28.344 - 00:22:02.970, Speaker D: Well, so the discount has compressed fairly dramatically. Like it. I think at the time where this was going down, the discount was like 20, 30%. I wanna say. Yes, it went all the way down to 47, 48%. Beginning of this year, when crypto markets hit a bottom, it is now tightened to, like, I wanna say negative 15. The discount's like 15 17%, which kind of like normal, sort of like, largely on this news that at some point it will be converted to an ETF.
00:22:03.082 - 00:22:03.734, Speaker C: Right.
00:22:05.834 - 00:22:27.338, Speaker D: Was Barry in Barry's mind, like. Cause we'll get to this later, but we'll involve, like, Gemini here and the Winklevie putting pressure on Barry. And was Barry just trying to buy time, thinking that at some point this will be converted, the premium will compress, and then, you know, you kind of, like, dig yourself out of a great hole?
00:22:27.506 - 00:23:13.808, Speaker B: Yeah, great question. So, absolutely. Who's buying time? The more time he has, then the more grayscale can generate hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue and cash flow for the mothership. So, absolutely he was buying time. That's why we saw endless extensions in the negotiations with Gemini and Genesis. So that is their strategy by time now, was it that they were waiting for the ETF version? I don't believe that's the case. And the reason why is DCG did not own enough GBTC, such that if the ETF was approved, that pull to par, where that discount goes away would not have been enough to enable DCG to make whole Genesis.
00:23:13.808 - 00:23:19.964, Speaker B: I believe they wanted to buy time so grayscale could generate enough cash so they could pay off their liabilities.
00:23:21.064 - 00:23:21.964, Speaker C: Got it.
00:23:24.544 - 00:23:41.256, Speaker D: One of your recent tweet threads got a lot of attention because as the complaint was coming out and you reviewed it in short order, you said, hey, this is actually worse than Enron. And a lot of people were caught off guard and say, wait a minute. So walk us through your thinking as.
00:23:41.280 - 00:24:16.160, Speaker B: To why that is right. So Enron was an elaborate accounting fraud that the then CFO, Andrew Fausto, and their CEO, perpetuating public markets. They had subsidiaries that they controlled. They had executives on those subsidiaries, like the CFO. They had self dealing. But here's the thing about Enron. Each one off transaction is legal on the surface, it was the aggregation of all of that together, plus the intention.
00:24:16.232 - 00:24:20.764, Speaker C: To deceive, that made that fraud okay.
00:24:21.624 - 00:24:36.964, Speaker B: And they were able to get their auditors, Arthur Andersen, since no longer does not exist, and the investment bankers go along with it. They said, hey, look, it's legal on a one off basis every step of these hundreds of transactions.
00:24:37.464 - 00:24:40.964, Speaker C: But what BCG did was beyond that.
00:24:41.864 - 00:25:10.486, Speaker B: DCG, for example, allegedly issued fraudulent balance sheet statements via genesis to their customers. I don't want them to do that. Genesis was playing technical word games with the term current assets, which can be used to define assets that are performing. In other words, assets that are current or assets that are current meaning can be liquidated within one year. The technical kind of word salad that.
00:25:10.510 - 00:25:16.222, Speaker C: They were playing and also the promissory note and the lack of disclosure around that.
00:25:16.278 - 00:25:38.374, Speaker B: So Genesis and DCG crossed the line in that deception in a way that Enron did not. Enron cost the public a lot more money than DCG, but in terms of the brazenness of it, it was more, uh, serious than what you saw with Enron.
00:25:40.034 - 00:25:40.626, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:25:40.730 - 00:25:47.034, Speaker D: In particular, I remember reading they. They sort of omitted certain footnotes around this hole that they were plugging.
00:25:47.074 - 00:25:47.714, Speaker B: I mean, that.
00:25:47.834 - 00:25:52.202, Speaker D: That in of itself is just, you know, fabricating statements.
00:25:52.258 - 00:25:52.426, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:25:52.450 - 00:26:29.408, Speaker B: NYAG is requesting that DCG be prohibited from being a security commodities business. Well, grayscale is that type of entity, so grayscale will need to be sold. I expect that DCG will challenge the NYAG complaint. So this has time to play out. But ultimately, I think the NYAG will prevail and Grayscale will be auctioned off. And so that is one consequence from this second is DCG will be mired in endless settlements and lawsuits. I mean, they just keep piling on and on.
00:26:29.408 - 00:26:53.404, Speaker B: And, of course, the SEC already filed a complaint against DCG. So I think DCG is effectively an insolvent zombie company. They will never be able to raise venture capital. What kind of career risk is any vc gonna take putting fire into that mess?
00:26:53.854 - 00:26:54.502, Speaker C: Right?
00:26:54.638 - 00:27:29.634, Speaker B: And if they can't raise venture capital, then how are they going to make everyone whole? It'll be interesting because Grayscale is the cash cow. So in a way, DCG is going to be in a form of indentured servitude to its creditors for a long time, just leaching the cash flow off of grayscale to make their creditors whole. And I think when that's done, then the assets of DCG are auctioned off, and DCG is functionally dead. And I also think Barry may very well go to prison.
00:27:30.534 - 00:27:30.942, Speaker C: Right.
00:27:30.998 - 00:27:46.074, Speaker B: Enron executives went to prison. If you believe that this is fraud and you believe it's more egregious than Enron in the brazenness and behavior, then my opinion, not a lawyer, is that Barry could go to prison.
00:27:47.414 - 00:28:37.284, Speaker D: Let's double click on that for listeners that might not be aware. So when you say DCG has a fair amount of obligations, because they were doing this widow trade, they were borrowing Genesis as a center, really interacted with pretty much everyone in crypto. I mean, they were the dominant market maker. They would borrow assets from a bunch of people, funds, whales, whatever, to, and then give you some yield. They would take assets from folks like Gemini. And then what you're saying is those creditors that are owed. Because if you were interacting, a lot of people had money with Genesis, and they are now stuck until there's some resolution, those creditors, at some point, may recover part of their assets made hold in some capacity.
00:28:37.684 - 00:28:38.180, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:28:38.252 - 00:28:49.564, Speaker D: Through the three arrows estate kind of liquidation, through kind of all the debtors that are involved on the other side, including DCG itself, because it was borrowing from Genesis.
00:28:49.604 - 00:28:50.184, Speaker C: Right.
00:28:50.484 - 00:29:02.884, Speaker D: And that's what might trigger a sale of grayscale, a sale of all the hundreds of venture investments that. I mean, DCG is one of the largest venture funds.
00:29:02.964 - 00:29:04.608, Speaker B: Yeah, that's right.
00:29:04.656 - 00:29:09.736, Speaker D: All of those positions would be auctioned off by the trustee.
00:29:09.880 - 00:29:10.664, Speaker C: Right? Yeah.
00:29:10.784 - 00:29:12.216, Speaker B: Ultimately, that's what will happen.
00:29:12.240 - 00:29:18.248, Speaker D: I expect, ultimately to recoup and maximize recovery for the creditors here.
00:29:18.416 - 00:29:45.554, Speaker B: I believe that'll happen ultimately, yes, again. And DCG will dispute the NY AG's complaint, and we have not heard the answer from barrier DCG. So maybe they can find some plausible explanation. I doubt it. I doubt it. This looks pretty damning, the evidence that they've put in the NY AG complaint. But, yeah, DCG owes something north of $670 million for subsidiary Genesis.
00:29:45.554 - 00:30:08.544, Speaker B: Depends on the price of bitcoin. And even beyond that, DCG and Barry are being sued for being defrauded. They're being sued by Gemini and others will act on the NY ag complaint and cite the evidence in that complaint to make additional lawsuits. It's not enough to make the creditors whole and they will be sued to oblivion.
00:30:09.164 - 00:30:15.948, Speaker A: What is the possible effect of this on the GBTC ETF conversion? Do you think. Do you think it's dead on arrival?
00:30:15.996 - 00:30:17.624, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, it's.
00:30:18.204 - 00:30:22.972, Speaker B: I think the GBTC will convert. ETF will convert. This is a.
00:30:23.108 - 00:30:25.906, Speaker A: So you think Grayscale will get it? Even though the.
00:30:26.020 - 00:30:27.830, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't think there's any impact, actually.
00:30:28.022 - 00:30:43.114, Speaker D: They're fully segregated like this does not. From a creditor liability exposure perspective, you're not affected. From a reputation on the margin, I'd say they don't. They don't get approved? I don't think that they will be approved first.
00:30:43.614 - 00:30:44.230, Speaker B: I'm just here.
00:30:44.262 - 00:30:56.678, Speaker A: I like the. And the reputation is important. Right. Like I'm hearing Rahm say that, you know, DCG can never get invested. You know, Barry might go to jail. DCG will never have an investor again. On the other side, Barry owns Grayscale too.
00:30:56.726 - 00:30:58.398, Speaker C: So now you're saying.
00:30:58.566 - 00:31:02.074, Speaker B: So Grayscale is in good standing with the law.
00:31:03.294 - 00:31:04.510, Speaker C: Yeah, that's it.
00:31:04.582 - 00:31:06.354, Speaker B: And due process applies.
00:31:07.014 - 00:31:07.630, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:31:07.742 - 00:31:25.754, Speaker B: So there's no. There's also a. It will be a dispute between buried ECG and the New York aG. Right. So Barry will have an answer. You'll say, I deny these. It is not the role of a regulator to pre judge.
00:31:25.754 - 00:31:28.914, Speaker B: That dispute will have to go through a legal process.
00:31:29.814 - 00:31:30.566, Speaker C: I think.
00:31:30.710 - 00:31:59.066, Speaker B: I believe we know how that's going to conclude. And even if it does conclude in that way, which will take at least a year to play out, and then maybe that's appealed. These ETF decisions have to happen before then. And then the SEC will make their determinations based on the queue in which those applications were filed. So I don't believe it has any actually impact to grayscale or to GBTC or Ethan.
00:31:59.090 - 00:32:00.094, Speaker C: That's interesting.
00:32:00.834 - 00:32:05.654, Speaker A: When you talk about the creditors. Gemini is the biggest creditor or who are the other big creditors?
00:32:06.154 - 00:32:35.656, Speaker B: The biggest creditors are Genesis and Gemini. So yeah. DCGO is 607 million plus two, Genesis. And depending on how you count the math, I want to say about a billion to Gemini. But there's also collateral that they've pledged in the form of GBTC, so that reduces the amount that they owe to Gemini. And there's 220,000 borrowers that have been impacted, and people have lost their life savings, retired couples and.
00:32:35.840 - 00:32:36.368, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:32:36.456 - 00:32:42.416, Speaker A: So I know you're not a lawyer, but the NYAG complaint was, I think, civil in nature.
00:32:42.484 - 00:32:43.546, Speaker C: Yes. War.
00:32:43.546 - 00:32:50.596, Speaker A: Why, if you're. If this is worse than Enron, why was this. Why is it such a. Why is it just a civil complaint?
00:32:50.660 - 00:33:03.620, Speaker B: A criminal action would come from likely the southern district of New York. Okay, so that could very well be coming, especially if NYAG prevails.
00:33:03.732 - 00:33:03.956, Speaker C: Right?
00:33:03.980 - 00:33:20.794, Speaker B: In other words, those findings of fact are agreed upon. Right. And, you know, the NYG complaint does say in one area that multiple repeated criminal acts were conducted.
00:33:22.054 - 00:34:00.184, Speaker D: Yeah. Playing devil's advocate and thinking kind of, in what version is this? Not, like, fraud. In what version? Because Barry's statement and DCG statement right after the complaint was, hey, we're actually disappointed in this complaint. We've tried to work with our counterparties. We've engaged with the Southern District of New York, I guess, and they were disappointed of this kind of complaint. And they said, we've been doing the right thing, continue to do the right thing. We try to work through the situation.
00:34:00.184 - 00:34:10.482, Speaker D: I know where you stand, but what would be a situation where that might be true?
00:34:10.618 - 00:34:38.184, Speaker B: Interesting question. So let's play it out, right? So Barry would say, hey, no, we were defrauded by €3 capital. We were defrauded by Alameda. We communicated with our clients. We should have done a better job adding footnotes. We should have done a better job defining where current assets are. Barry probably says, I did not know the CFO refused to join client calls.
00:34:38.184 - 00:35:07.174, Speaker B: I did not know that the CFO and others were having bullet points that were designed to optimize for DCG and Genesis. Retaining capital and deposits. It's something like that. It's like the FBF defense. Hey, we were negligent. We could have done a better job. We could have dotted I's, crossed t's, but it was fast moving, and we ourselves were negatively impacted.
00:35:08.834 - 00:35:10.054, Speaker C: Something like that.
00:35:11.474 - 00:36:09.132, Speaker A: This episode is brought to you by Chronicle protocol, the best on chain source for cost efficient, verifiable data. For anyone who listens to empire a lot, you know that we talk a lot about Makerdao. Well, Chronicle Protocol is this novel, Oracle solution that has exclusively secured over 10 billion in assets for Maker and its ecosystem since 2017. And for the first time ever, super excited to share here that Chronicle's Oracle service is now publicly available for anyone to use, compared to using other Oracle services, Chronicle offers a 60% reduction in gas fees. They have an unparalleled level of transparency at Chronicle. They offer a dashboard that allows anyone to track back the genesis and trajectory of the data it provides, marking this milestone in on chain data availability. Chronicle is endorsed by a network of the most revered validators, including Etherscan, Infura, Gitcoin, Duidx, and Makerdao.
00:36:09.132 - 00:36:26.404, Speaker A: It is time for a paradigm shift in oracle development, a future where data is verifiable, operational costs are contained, and the possibilities are immense. You can learn more about Chronicle at chronicle labs.org, comma. That is chroniclelabs.org.
00:36:28.024 - 00:36:52.278, Speaker D: I want to get to Gemini here because that was fairly interesting throughout all of this. The Winklevieve brothers. I think Gemini, through this earn program, has stuck somewhere close to 400 million, some 350 million. Right. That they had. They're owed by Genesis, I believe.
00:36:52.366 - 00:36:55.158, Speaker B: I believe it's more than that. It's more than that. Okay.
00:36:55.286 - 00:37:35.024, Speaker D: Yeah, well, so it's more than that. And throughout this process, the Wonka vibe brothers have been very vocal against Barry and DCG. And of course, now the complaint also involves them in the sense that they should have stopped the program much earlier, given what has come to light, that in board discussions, they actually knew of the degrading situation of Genesis, their counterparty. Some executives withdrew from the earn program ahead of time. And so the complaint here says that they.
00:37:35.524 - 00:37:36.236, Speaker C: I'm not sure.
00:37:36.300 - 00:37:47.232, Speaker D: I don't think it's as severe, but it does make the point where, hey, you guys should have done a way better job of protecting users. And internally, you knew something was up and you didn't act fast enough.
00:37:47.368 - 00:38:46.528, Speaker B: Right? Yeah. Gemini story is definitely complicated, for sure. So first off, you're right. The NYAG complaint does call Gemini fraud number one, just seriously. But they accuse Gemini of lack of disclosure and not being faithful to the representations they made to their clients on the website. And then they cite as evidence, which you pointed out, Santi, that you had executives that had redeemed from Gemini earn while they were informed of the risk rating, which was CCC, and also Gemini continued to funnel deposits to Genesis while they were aware of these risks. So Gemini is a complicated story because.
00:38:46.576 - 00:38:49.848, Speaker C: They were also defrauded. Yeah, there were no question.
00:38:49.896 - 00:39:04.104, Speaker B: There's no question they're defrauded and not only that. Here's what happens. So Gemini issues a letter to redeem from Genesis after they've done what they're supposed to do.
00:39:04.144 - 00:39:04.752, Speaker C: Right.
00:39:04.928 - 00:39:25.022, Speaker B: And then Barry says, if you force us to redeem, we will file for bankruptcy. So you're screwed anyway. Now think about that for a moment, right. The kind of position that Gemini is in. I mean, they are between a rock and a hard place. I mean, this is what happens when you deal with a fraudster. You're screwed on day one.
00:39:25.168 - 00:39:25.882, Speaker C: Right?
00:39:26.058 - 00:39:32.694, Speaker B: So let's say Gemini, six months earlier, had put in a redemption notice.
00:39:33.154 - 00:39:34.658, Speaker C: I think they should have. Right.
00:39:34.706 - 00:39:42.530, Speaker B: That'd been the right move. Genesis would have said the same thing. They would have said, oh, we're going to file for bankruptcy because those loans.
00:39:42.562 - 00:39:45.882, Speaker C: Are not liquid, and many of them.
00:39:45.898 - 00:40:04.480, Speaker B: Are open term loans, but their borrowers were. Folks like Alameda would not have been able to deliver. So they're in a difficult position. I agree. It's a lesser set of infractions than DCG and bury.
00:40:04.632 - 00:40:07.512, Speaker C: But they're open questions like, why did.
00:40:07.528 - 00:40:23.946, Speaker B: They let the money keep flowing in? I don't understand that. Maybe it's because they thought that if they said, hey, we're stopping the program, then people in the program would redeem en masse, which would also kill Genesis. I don't know. I want to answer those questions, though.
00:40:24.130 - 00:40:26.186, Speaker C: But I think something that the public.
00:40:26.250 - 00:40:33.658, Speaker B: Doesn'T appreciate is that it's not enough for someone on the board to say, oh, that business is bad as Lehman.
00:40:33.786 - 00:40:34.146, Speaker C: Right.
00:40:34.210 - 00:40:45.974, Speaker B: It's like, well, what do you do with the current situation? You've got an illiquid loan book, by the way. That board member is not an executive. Board members are allowed to have opinions. It is definitely a bad look for. For sure.
00:40:46.094 - 00:40:46.438, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:40:46.486 - 00:40:56.606, Speaker B: But also, people allowed to redeem from programs if they would like. But clearly, the pretty people that did that had asymmetric information that the public did not have. The public should have.
00:40:56.790 - 00:40:57.326, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:40:57.430 - 00:41:10.514, Speaker D: You could have argued that they were triple c. They had an internal rating system. You could have argued that that system and that rating scoring system was off from day one. Everything is triple c and crypto guys. Like, there's smart contract risk. There is.
00:41:10.914 - 00:41:11.410, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:41:11.482 - 00:41:18.978, Speaker D: Volatility risk. There's just liquidity risks, like everything compounded and stacked on each other. You could argue it's like junk status.
00:41:19.146 - 00:41:25.254, Speaker B: What I'd also want to know is that triple c rating, it looks like they arrived at that after the program had launched.
00:41:25.554 - 00:41:41.094, Speaker D: Yes, because they initially had it at triple b, and then the downgraded to triple c because crypto prices were. They were largely looking at crypto prices and said, okay, gosh, this might really lead to a situation of impairment.
00:41:41.394 - 00:41:42.538, Speaker C: Right, right.
00:41:42.666 - 00:42:20.526, Speaker B: I think the case against Gemini is going to be weaker than the case against DCG. They'll be held accountable. They will have a restitution order that's going to come from the SEC or NYH settlement anyway. So that'll help Gemini earn. But the punches they landed on DCG were much more damning. These complaints have a lot of storytelling going on in there, too. They're trying to make a public case, for example, they'll say, and no less than one year later, it was found to have ACCC rate.
00:42:20.526 - 00:42:31.196, Speaker B: Well, no kidding. Crypto fell apart. So that's not an indictment. That's just the nature of the business. And, of course, it was a bad decision to have these programs to begin with.
00:42:31.350 - 00:42:32.160, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:42:32.352 - 00:42:58.812, Speaker B: The other part, I think, where that case is weaker, and they allege securities fraud, they say this is an unreached securities offering, and that part of the law and regulation is very vague. Look, there are people that raise money for a Hollywood film. They earn a finder's fee, so they're raising money to invest in a project where their success is based on the efforts of others. All the criteria how we test are met. The SEC doesn't take enforcement actions against people that raise money and find those fees.
00:42:58.968 - 00:42:59.524, Speaker C: Right.
00:42:59.644 - 00:43:17.824, Speaker B: It's a legitimate gray area. And I saw this with companies like lending club and Prosper in the 2008 to 2009 cycle, they were crowdfunding dollars to invest in loans to consumers. And then the SEC said, oh, that's not a loan, that's a security. So when is a loan a loan, and when is a loan in a security?
00:43:18.924 - 00:43:19.744, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:43:23.084 - 00:43:45.664, Speaker D: In. So we talked about kind of the different outcomes here. What are you mostly paying attention to in terms of second order effects? We've talked a little bit about, they have a huge venture portfolio. They have multiple other units in crypto. We always talk about the contagion of stuff.
00:43:47.364 - 00:43:47.932, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:43:48.028 - 00:43:48.948, Speaker D: Play that out for us.
00:43:49.036 - 00:44:06.052, Speaker B: I don't think there's actually much contagion. I really don't think there's much contagion left. There are some smaller offshore exchanges that may have credit risk issues, but they're not in a chain of contagion. That's one notwithstanding. What heck's going on with binance? I don't know. I don't know if anyone knows. Let's figure out.
00:44:06.052 - 00:44:07.236, Speaker B: Let's get that cleared out there.
00:44:07.300 - 00:44:09.064, Speaker A: Yeah, once you figure that out, let us know.
00:44:09.364 - 00:44:42.792, Speaker B: Right, exactly. So that venture portfolio is going to cause markdowns in the secondary markets. So would you rather invest in a new crypto startup or own a chunk of foundry or Luno at a big discount to their initial investment price? I'd rather do the latter. So I think that could have a negative effect on venture markets. Of course, you're seeing that across all of venture. You're seeing that the fintech venture, you've seen that in every market, these dislocated secondary sales and markdowns are happening. That's one.
00:44:42.792 - 00:44:50.282, Speaker B: Number two is Michael Sonneshein gets a promotion. He's actually a winner of all this. Right. So he's the CEO of Grayscale. They'll get spun off.
00:44:50.418 - 00:44:50.730, Speaker C: Yes.
00:44:50.762 - 00:45:05.474, Speaker B: He'll have to cut the fees to make it more economical as more ETF's come online. But he doesn't have to report to Barry Silbert. Not that there was any negative relationship there, but yeah, he said he set for life. Michael Sondershine is doing all right. We were away.
00:45:05.594 - 00:45:08.370, Speaker A: Fellow Emory guy with me, well, funny.
00:45:08.442 - 00:45:17.526, Speaker D: He was at fake. We were both JP Morgan investment banking. He was a year, I think he was a year ahead of me, and he was in the financial institutions group, in the investment bank. And so we kind of.
00:45:17.630 - 00:45:24.994, Speaker B: Yeah, interesting. Third is, you know, you are seeing startups saying, hey, we're going to do this the right way.
00:45:25.334 - 00:45:25.694, Speaker C: Right?
00:45:25.734 - 00:45:54.394, Speaker B: So you're seeing the rise of startups trying to do decentralized prime brokerage, which is what the business of Genesis was. And you're also seeing startups trying to do just classic prime brokerage. Goldman is entering the business. Goldman is now financing bitcoin and Ethereum using their balance sheet. That's how it should be, by the way, credit rating, the prime brokerage. I'm very critical of Goldman and other areas, but that's what you want to be seen as a counterparty that's issuing loans.
00:45:55.454 - 00:46:09.070, Speaker D: Yeah, definitely. So the winners here are maybe potentially the folks who might be able to pick apart the venture portfolio by sendsing the dollar, folks that might, maybe a fidelity blackrock that might buy grayscale and.
00:46:09.102 - 00:46:17.390, Speaker B: Just buy that Blackrock. I don't know who's going to buy. It's not going to be a name brand that buys this thing because the reputational risk, and they can build it themselves.
00:46:17.582 - 00:46:19.590, Speaker D: You just buy depositor base, right?
00:46:19.622 - 00:46:30.214, Speaker B: I mean, and the, you know, whoever buys them is going to heritable lawsuits too. So they're not going to, they're not going. Even those lawsuits at the DCG level, it's the reputation along the brain damage.
00:46:30.334 - 00:46:37.074, Speaker D: I thought you could carve that out, like when Credit Suisse bought ub. Well, other way around. Right.
00:46:38.374 - 00:46:45.098, Speaker B: So how would that work? Let's say they auction off. It's. Look, it's possible, like a grayscale so far is clean, right?
00:46:45.146 - 00:46:52.138, Speaker D: Yeah, they're clean. I don't think they have any. And you can make a provision in there with the price reflects. You know, maybe.
00:46:52.226 - 00:47:04.754, Speaker B: I think there's a lot of brain damage, reputation risk. I don't think. I think Blackrock's like, look, we have our docs. We know how to go do this. They already filed their docs. They, you know, they've got the right vendor ecosystem in place. Who are the other.
00:47:04.754 - 00:47:05.258, Speaker B: How would you.
00:47:05.306 - 00:47:07.734, Speaker D: By the way, how would you value grayscale?
00:47:09.354 - 00:47:13.702, Speaker B: Grayscale. I would look at their cash flow stream and then assign a multiple to that.
00:47:13.858 - 00:47:19.038, Speaker D: So a couple pro forma for conversion. Because the management fee is not going to be where it is today.
00:47:19.086 - 00:47:19.390, Speaker C: Right?
00:47:19.462 - 00:47:52.594, Speaker B: Correct, correct. So I'd assume that steady state bips are closer to 30 to 40. They'll probably try to land at 50, but their ETF's in Canada, that 30 bps to 40 pips. And if you're not competitive, then you lose assets. It goes to the, you know, goes to someone else. So, you know, they probably have an efficient operation. So 30 bits times whatever the remaining bitcoin that'll be held is right now, it's north of 10 billion in terms of bitcoin value.
00:47:52.594 - 00:48:16.330, Speaker B: With a dozen to two dozen ETF's coming online, inevitably, there's over 20 applications. Right. You're gonna have a market share game unfold. And there's a lot of animosity towards grayscale. Like, that brand is very sour. So I think they're going to lose a lot of Aum. So, I don't know, let's say it's 2 billion times 30 bps.
00:48:16.330 - 00:48:17.922, Speaker B: Can we do the quick math on that?
00:48:18.058 - 00:48:19.134, Speaker C: Yeah, that's what.
00:48:22.234 - 00:48:30.050, Speaker B: Ongoing income. But here are the other losers, folks that invested in DC, 6 million of management fees seems too low.
00:48:30.162 - 00:48:31.802, Speaker A: 60. 60 million.
00:48:31.858 - 00:48:35.924, Speaker B: That's about right. 60 sounds about right. So Michael Sonneshe will do well. He's okay.
00:48:37.224 - 00:48:47.160, Speaker A: Ron, when you said that their portfolio. So they have. DCG owns a couple of companies like Luna and Foundry and stuff, and then they've made about 120 investments out of their venture arm.
00:48:47.352 - 00:48:49.608, Speaker C: Correct. I would push.
00:48:49.656 - 00:48:58.364, Speaker A: I don't think their venture arm is going to get impact. I don't think the 120 portfolio companies are going to get impacted. It's just one less company on your cap table.
00:48:58.744 - 00:49:05.264, Speaker B: They were largely minority investors in many of these companies. Let's continue. Companies will continue to operate, do what they're supposed to do.
00:49:05.384 - 00:49:06.044, Speaker C: Right.
00:49:06.464 - 00:49:15.040, Speaker A: You're saying it's more like the Luno's found, like, foundry is actually the largest bitcoin mining pool, I think, right now, and I'm pretty sure in the world.
00:49:15.072 - 00:49:17.440, Speaker D: Now, it's always been number one, number two.
00:49:17.472 - 00:49:18.984, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. Right.
00:49:19.024 - 00:49:47.514, Speaker B: So their stock will be sold and auctioned off by DCG. That doesn't impact those companies directly. Well, there'll be a mark on that. That's probably a discount to their true value because that whole portfolio will be sold. So it's going to impact venture markets also equity investors in DCG. So DCG did a round in November 2021, which is top of the market at a $10 billion valuation. Those equity investors are going to get a zero.
00:49:48.654 - 00:50:01.194, Speaker D: I was looking at buying secondary way before that at like a 2 billion, then 3 billion. And it was always Roford, the company was always buying back. And Barry was super, super protective.
00:50:01.514 - 00:50:03.122, Speaker C: But the thesis was just that it.
00:50:03.138 - 00:50:23.402, Speaker D: Is like, can be a Berkshire Hathaway. It has multiple business lines, great venture portfolio. And even if you did some of the parts, and we did a whole sensitivity analysis on, like, even if you ascribe zero value to some of the units, like, it was still, like Grayscale alone was very. It is a great business.
00:50:23.458 - 00:50:51.448, Speaker B: Oh, absolutely. It's a phenomenal business. And you know what's interesting is that Barry never sold shares. In fact, they were buying back shares from investors using the cash offering. Always right now, in retrospect, that's another decision he would have done differently. This is the interesting thing, the psychology of buried, to get in crypto early accumulate on bitcoin, bet on his convictions and build these businesses. And that foresight allowed him to create this empire.
00:50:51.448 - 00:50:59.760, Speaker B: Here we are on the empire podcast. They built this empire. But that same conviction also spelled his demise.
00:50:59.912 - 00:51:03.336, Speaker D: Yeah, well, I mean, it's sort of a scarface. You shouldn't get high in your own supply.
00:51:03.480 - 00:51:05.684, Speaker C: Yeah, right, right.
00:51:06.464 - 00:51:09.164, Speaker A: That was take that levered bet. Yeah, on.
00:51:10.384 - 00:51:33.482, Speaker B: It's an interesting kind of tragic flaw, though, right? Like that psychology that made him this extraordinary entrepreneur and created enormous wealth through that single minded focus. Even when bitcoin was non consensus ten plus years ago, still not. Because this now that caused him to believe that, oh, this will work out and we'll figure this out. And that, I think if you had.
00:51:33.498 - 00:51:52.690, Speaker D: A really good person on the board, I don't know who was on the board of DCG, but anyone in finance that is worth their salt would have told you, carry trades are incredibly risky, particularly if they had looked at the structure, would have said no. To your point around Berkshire is Berkshire because it does it in a very particular way.
00:51:52.842 - 00:51:53.202, Speaker C: Right.
00:51:53.258 - 00:52:26.924, Speaker D: The way this was being done was, in one version, risking it all, or an incremental, decent bump in profitability, but with a huge kind of asymmetry on the downside, they could have lost it all. And in crypto, you sort of have to assume that a. There's always going to be volatility, and there could be moments of raw, like, very tough liquidity in the market. And so the structure of all of that, like, maybe that's, I don't know, the particulars of who was on the board.
00:52:27.084 - 00:52:29.732, Speaker A: It was Barry. Barry. Glenn Hutchins.
00:52:29.788 - 00:52:32.692, Speaker B: And then Larry Summer, he left.
00:52:32.748 - 00:52:34.584, Speaker D: Glenn Hutchins, that's from Silvergate, right?
00:52:35.804 - 00:52:47.660, Speaker A: From. Yes, exactly. So Glenn Hutchins and then Larry Lenahan, I think, was his name. It's the guy who started. He started first mark capital and one of the other funds he had Larry.
00:52:47.692 - 00:52:48.940, Speaker B: Summers as well, from.
00:52:49.052 - 00:52:50.452, Speaker D: And then Larry removed himself.
00:52:50.548 - 00:52:54.304, Speaker B: Larry, correct. Larry is very Larry's head of the game. Larry's like, I'm out.
00:52:57.644 - 00:53:06.420, Speaker D: But, you know, I would love to kind of understand that dynamic and how involved they were in understanding this particular operation.
00:53:06.572 - 00:53:28.310, Speaker B: So Larry's interesting because Larry was on the board of lending club, and lending club I worked with my prior life. I was an angel investor in lending club. I that business very well. And Larry also removed himself from the lending club board when their then management was accused of fraud. Nothing actually transpired. Da da da. But he took off at that point.
00:53:28.382 - 00:53:29.246, Speaker C: Right. So.
00:53:29.270 - 00:53:38.270, Speaker B: But I think you, Ray, is an excellent point around. You know, Barry was in his own thought bubble, and who was there, really to challenge? I mean, did Barry never had a co founder? It seems like.
00:53:38.382 - 00:53:39.954, Speaker C: No. Right?
00:53:41.034 - 00:53:57.066, Speaker B: Maybe that's one of the lessons. Right? You need someone to check you or call out your own b's, right? Like, hey, look, the good idea. But maybe this doesn't make any sense for these reasons. Yeah, I doubt the board was really hands on Oracle.
00:53:57.090 - 00:53:58.842, Speaker C: Like, if you get a board, if.
00:53:58.858 - 00:54:15.514, Speaker B: You have a celebrity board, folks like Larry Summers. And that board is probably more about biz dev and marketing rather than actually talking to them to get great advice on how to build your business. So I doubt that that board was highly engaged.
00:54:16.134 - 00:55:02.900, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah. I think there's a lesson there probably in corporate governance and making sure that you have, I mean, FTX didn't, most of the VC's didn't have a board seat, never asked for a board seat. And I think, yeah, I think in crypto, you see these personalities like, look, we're all in some capacity, a bit crazy to believe in this stuff, especially, but I think it's always worth having someone that will. The temptation is you're thinking that, look, a lot of this is cutting edge. A lot of it is innovating, but there's some things that shouldn't be reinvented. Vesting schedules, so many things like that we don't need to reinvent the wheel and all these other things. And I think he did a very miscalculated bet on doing carry trades.
00:55:02.900 - 00:55:11.072, Speaker D: And I think a lot of hedge funds, a lot of sophisticated risk managers will tell you, don't do it. Just absolutely.
00:55:11.088 - 00:55:44.424, Speaker B: No, absolutely. Hedge funds and banks have far more risk management. They don't have concentrated counterparty risk, which they had both in three years. Capital and Genesis, they made a lot of mistakes. I think the other thing that Genesis and DCG and Berry missed was they did not use DeFi to manage their risk. But why were they taking on counterparty risk? Three arrows capital allegedly double or triple pledged their collateral to multiple parties, which is fraud. And we saw that, by the way, back in 2008, again with these subprime mortgage lenders.
00:55:44.424 - 00:55:55.584, Speaker B: So that's another thing. If he was highly convicted around crypto, but did not insist upon the technology or even basic lending standards of the market.
00:55:56.224 - 00:55:57.604, Speaker C: Yeah. Yeah.
00:55:57.944 - 00:56:01.680, Speaker A: Robin, this is great. Appreciate you coming on.
00:56:01.792 - 00:56:02.064, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:56:02.104 - 00:56:26.452, Speaker D: Anything else? I guess ROM. I mean, I would encourage everyone to go follow RoM. You're constantly tweeting about not just crypto, but I think you have a very fresh, traditional finance lens and apply it to crypto. You're also talking about a lot of stuff in the market. And so some great threads. Anything else like parting thoughts and just maybe things that you're looking out for in the current environment?
00:56:26.588 - 00:56:38.188, Speaker B: Sure. First off, very kind of. You're a big fan of your podcast. And, Santa, you and I are both trapped by crypto crossover. And so it's good to have both worlds, like the promise of digital assets.
00:56:38.236 - 00:56:40.924, Speaker D: We're cool again now for a while, guys.
00:56:40.964 - 00:56:42.108, Speaker B: Go back to cool.
00:56:42.156 - 00:56:42.340, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:56:42.372 - 00:56:45.704, Speaker B: If we're cool, then we're near the top, and then we gotta find something.
00:56:46.204 - 00:56:48.394, Speaker D: Perhaps a little bit more respected, I guess.
00:56:49.494 - 00:56:55.998, Speaker B: Right, right. I would say. I think the venture side is going to be negatively impacted.
00:56:56.046 - 00:56:56.230, Speaker C: Right.
00:56:56.262 - 00:57:17.694, Speaker B: There's hundreds of venture funds and there's maybe 30 protocols that matter and maybe a dozen institutions that matter, the majority of which are tradfi. So I think on the venture side, there's still more of a reckoning that's going to happen. We talked about some of the knock on effects from the DCG portfolio, so that's something to watch out for.
00:57:18.034 - 00:57:19.666, Speaker C: Yeah. Cool.
00:57:19.850 - 00:57:28.694, Speaker D: Closing question. Do you think another Genesis gets built and gets to the level of scale, or does this happen on chain?
00:57:29.674 - 00:57:36.866, Speaker B: It'll be both. Another genesis will be built? Yes. And it should not be built, I think.
00:57:36.970 - 00:57:39.654, Speaker A: Well, it will and should not be. That's a good.
00:57:41.094 - 00:57:47.102, Speaker D: But if it's on chain, proof of reserves or proof of what? Privacy components, you kind of mitigate a lot of this.
00:57:47.198 - 00:58:00.354, Speaker B: Correct? Correct. Yeah, exactly. Like, it's a really interesting question. How would you build Genesis on chain? Because compound and Aave and maker are not that you need to. Those are consumer apps. You need to make them institutional.
00:58:01.694 - 00:58:03.862, Speaker C: And that's a big lift. Right.
00:58:03.878 - 00:58:08.520, Speaker B: You need an app that can do a UCC filing, for instance. That's just one element.
00:58:08.632 - 00:58:48.208, Speaker D: I've talked to Stani about this, by the way, and because the key feature that someone needs to build on chain is delayed time lock liquidations, because it's nice when Genesis can call you in March of 2020 and say, hey, guys, you need to refill your collateral three times. I had to refill collateral three times that day. And in Abby, you get immediately liquidated, and it's high gas. And I think you can build in some logic at the smart contract level, because I think a lot of funds appreciate that. And I think that it's not perfect, but just that feature like that would kind of move the needle, I think.
00:58:48.256 - 00:59:09.744, Speaker B: I agree. That's another feature you need. I mean, there's a lot you have to do. For example, Genesis is financing Seoul. Did you not have a deep liquid market? So your eligible collateral, what you're lending against, has to be deep and liquid. You need to have the ability to integrate with Bloomberg terminals. There's something called a fixed protocol where trades go through so traffic can access it.
00:59:09.744 - 00:59:40.704, Speaker B: You need a liquid loan market, meaning you can't be the only game in town. In tradfi, you have corporate loans that are issued, and the three of us can't buy those corporate loans off of Schwa. But those corporate loans do trade from one bank to another to the hedge funds over the counter. And there's standards that enable that to happen. And the custody framework around that in custody on chain here. But look, this can be built on chain, but it's a multi year effort that's required. It takes industry standards also.
00:59:41.164 - 00:59:45.012, Speaker D: So does that make you a tokenization bull or skeptic?
00:59:45.068 - 01:00:22.112, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm a big tokenization bull. I think tokenization is one of the promises of digital assets, because what do banks and exchanges do? Banks and exchanges intermediate between two parties. One, they exchange value that's represented in a ticker, which is a pointer to a legal contract, which is a claim on assets and cash flows. And you can do all of that on chain. And if you look at the risks, the issues in the 2008 crisis, a lot of that centered around counterparty risk. Counterparties don't trust each other. Counterparties have balance sheets with holes in them and, you know, digital assets.
01:00:22.112 - 01:00:41.724, Speaker B: DeFi, blockchain, crypto, transparent, 24 7365. Exactly. So, yeah, no, I agree. I think tokenization is an incredible opportunity, and certain chains, like Ethereum, I think, should benefit from that. But also, you know, other chains like. Like Avax, maybe stellar, etcetera as well.
01:00:42.064 - 01:00:54.180, Speaker D: Nice. Well, Rom, I will leave it there. I would love to bring you on down the road to talk about tokenization maybe, and applying that traditional finance lens, but it's been a real treat. Thank you so much for.
01:00:54.292 - 01:00:56.548, Speaker B: My pleasure. Always a pleasure. Thank you, bro.
01:00:56.676 - 01:00:57.244, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks, Rob.
