00:00:19.654 - 00:00:22.750, Speaker B: What is banter? No, fluff and empire.
00:00:22.902 - 00:00:24.542, Speaker A: No, we don't like to talk about fluff.
00:00:24.598 - 00:00:25.932, Speaker B: There's a lot going on.
00:00:26.078 - 00:00:26.776, Speaker A: How you doing, man?
00:00:26.800 - 00:00:39.824, Speaker B: You know, how's the week treating you feeling great. You know, I'm on a runners high. I told you I was gonna run last roundup, so I went to London, ran that marathon, and, yeah, I had a good time. London's great marathon.
00:00:39.864 - 00:00:43.512, Speaker A: So, yeah, I heard you broken.
00:00:43.528 - 00:00:51.484, Speaker B: Of course, all the stuff is going on. 242 hours, 47 minutes and 18 seconds.
00:00:52.108 - 00:00:55.504, Speaker A: Sub seven, huh? Sub unknown. Seven minute average. Nicely done, sir.
00:00:56.364 - 00:01:22.854, Speaker B: 6620 per mile or 347 357 /km so it's good. Not that we're tracking this. I'd rather track my. I'd rather track my running stats more so than look at ta on a crypto chart, you know, or like, all these, you know, because that's not reliable or alerts in crypto, as we've seen this week. So. So, anyways, I'd rather just stick to, you know, looking at charts of my running performance, which also sucks, really.
00:01:22.974 - 00:01:30.914, Speaker A: Nice. So do you. Do you have a trainer? How do, what goes on with these marathons? This is an annual every year thing. Multiple marathons a year.
00:01:32.854 - 00:01:35.034, Speaker B: I try to do at least one a year. Yeah.
00:01:37.294 - 00:01:59.598, Speaker A: Nice. Well, we're back into the markets. It was kind of a weird, weird week for the markets, huh? You basically had. Yesterday you had. What's their name? I think it's Arkham or something, like, tagged a wallet. And then it was DB News tweeted something out, and it was kind of just bit of chaos in the markets with this flash crash. You had this open interest got wiped.
00:01:59.598 - 00:02:22.052, Speaker A: I think it was that Mount Gox wallets were selling. If you look at the charts from yesterday, bitcoin started the day around 27k, pumped to 30, fell back to the low, and then the. The daily candle finished right in the middle, like 28 five. So you had, like, a 10% bitcoin price swing. Pretty crazy price action. Can't remember a day like that in a while. Um, what do.
00:02:22.052 - 00:02:23.584, Speaker A: What do you make of the markets this week?
00:02:25.404 - 00:03:06.714, Speaker B: Uh, it's probably one of the strangest trading days, like, referencing specifically yesterday where you had. You woke up during the day and, you know, the market was rallying, bitcoin was up, baton and everything. Else kind of followed. People, of course, were like, hey, there's, you know, every time there's a bank run, specifically first Republic was down like 22% pre market. And then people were correlating that to like, the rise of bitcoin. And it's like this is the case of, you know, why bitcoin, why crypto, you know, ensued narrative. You close your laptop, you came back 6 hours later, and you're like totally reversed that rally, of course, then turns out that, you know, as you referenced, there was like this sort of fake alert.
00:03:06.714 - 00:03:53.004, Speaker B: I think the biggest takeaway is it feels like crypto, like in 2016. I think this is more of a side effect of the low liquidity in the market. Just these dramatic price movements. I think my estimation and all the accounts that I follow that are way more sophisticated, that are looking at liquidity across kind of exchanges and on chain, is that it takes far less liquidity to move prices, including bitcoin. Right. And I think that's just a testament of liquidity has really dried up over the last six months. And so you do see greater volatility.
00:03:53.004 - 00:04:37.236, Speaker B: Of course, people would say there is volatility in the traditional markets, increasingly so. And I think that's more of a testament of this sort of Wall street bets movement. And people are really click of a button can trade, and a lot of it is just retail. I also saw a chart that says, look, the average holding for stocks has gone down from seven years in the sixties to basically a couple of months or weeks. I think its just our generation is just more trigger happy to trade a lot. And crypto, obviously, it's just on steroids, but specifically on this day, I think it's just highlighting the lack of relatively low liquidity in the market. Preston.
00:04:37.260 - 00:05:09.224, Speaker A: Yeah. So what happened is that Arkham is this new data platform in crypto. They alerted users that mount Gox and these government controlled crypto funds were both on the move. They later said this was a bug fixed, deployed, that previously was causing alerts to be sent, uh, sent by accident to, like the small subset of users. What was also interesting was the, um, the amount of open interest that was just wiped off the, wiped off the table. So within crypto, uh, the global cryptos future market, uh, wiped off 3.5 billion in open interest.
00:05:09.224 - 00:05:33.904, Speaker A: And then actually if you. I was looking at the global, the global metrics for this outside of just crypto, it was, uh, the, uh, global open interest dumped from 22 billion to almost 18 billion. Um, that seems low, though. Excuse me. Global global crypto open interest. Yeah. Um, so a bunch of, I mean, yeah, a bunch of futures traders got, uh, took, took off their interest.
00:05:34.444 - 00:05:35.260, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:05:35.452 - 00:05:36.444, Speaker A: Contracts.
00:05:36.604 - 00:06:11.220, Speaker B: Yeah. It's a crap market. I feel like anything between 20 and 30k range is just going to be these weird days. So, like, if, again, none of this is a recommendation of any sorts, but, you know, I would cautiously advise against using leverage given market conditions. You know, it's just, you see days like today and, or yesterday and, you know, it's not. I mean, look, using leveraging crypto has always been a recipe for blowing up at some point, but particularly in these conditions, it's just, you know, it's, it's tricky. Yeah.
00:06:11.220 - 00:06:41.630, Speaker B: But anyways, talking about today, I think you also saw a pretty sharp rally on low. Obviously, you could talk about a lot of folks are still sitting on stable coins, haven't really fully deployed. And so I think they're using these dips as opportunities to cost average on their way in. So maybe that's a good segue into positive news or something else, but that's really everything that I take from it. I don't know if there's anything else that you have.
00:06:41.712 - 00:07:06.426, Speaker A: No, I mean, before getting into the positive news, let's talk about one more thing, which is a first republic. You mentioned it briefly, but First Republic reported on Monday that its total deposits had fallen by 41% in the first quarter. Stock fell to record lows. Shares plunged I think, by around 50% on Tuesday, fell as much as 35% on Wednesday. New low of let's see what it's trading at today. Last time I looked, it was like 480. Now it's back up to 650.
00:07:06.426 - 00:07:29.570, Speaker A: Market cap of a little over a billion. Uh, stock was halted a couple of different times. Um, they had tried to find a kind of a savior. They, I think we're talking to the government about bailing them out. They're talking to a couple other banks about bailing them out. And, uh, what, what some folks reported, um, last night was that the government is not going to bail them out. The Fed, the Fed will not be stepping in, it seems like.
00:07:29.570 - 00:07:31.362, Speaker A: So now it's kind of over.
00:07:31.538 - 00:07:52.658, Speaker B: The bank not. There's a very interesting piece of language there that said, not currently, which was a lot of people reading into that saying, well, maybe they just will wait for the situation to really, really deteriorate. Although arguably, as you said, how much more can it deteriorate? Right? Yeah, that's sort of the question.
00:07:52.826 - 00:08:08.600, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, and they also already had two multibillion dollar bailouts. Right. A couple weeks ago. So I think option one is basically you stay the course. If you're, if you're first republican, you stay the course. You maybe wait for the securities and the loans to mature.
00:08:08.600 - 00:08:37.574, Speaker A: That's a long road. They do have a little bit of liquidity that could help them survive. And, I mean, that's kind of a dangerous game. Option two is you try to appeal to either the big banks or to private equity. So you could try to sell some of the loans and securities at the same cost they bought them for. In exchange, the buyer comes in, they probably get some, some sort of preferred equity interest in. And first Republic probably a pretty tough sell because those assets are selling for well above the market rate.
00:08:37.574 - 00:09:06.954, Speaker A: I think first republics bonds mature in 2045 or 2046, and they're trading at $0.43 on the dollar right now. So I think if you're a bank, if you're like JP Morgan looking at this deal, you're kind of between a rock and a hard place. Right. If first Republic fails, the FDIC is likely going to want to avoid systematic risk. Offers insurance to all depositors, um, probably even those without insurance. Right.
00:09:06.954 - 00:09:28.464, Speaker A: And then that costs a pretty penny to, like, the banking system probably has to get funded by large banks, and that ends up costing them tens of billions of dollars. So even if they don't go forward with an acquisition, if first Republic ends up failing, FDIC system is probably going to, in one way or another, end up costing those banks a lot of money. Um, yeah, so that's. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:09:28.544 - 00:10:07.224, Speaker B: We'll see. I mean, is this a systemically important bank? Unclear, certainly. It's my estimation that, what is it, the 14th largest bank. You're right. I mean, in March, roughly a little over a month ago, March 16, a consortium of banks, including JP Morgan bank of America, stepped in and infused like 30 billion. Naturally, those probably are the folks that are now looking at, as you say, picking up the depositor base. The question, of course then is how bad will get.
00:10:07.224 - 00:10:48.728, Speaker B: If the Fed really will, if they let it die and don't step in like they did with Lehman and others in the global financial crisis, then what happens? They get bailed out by bank. They basically buy it for pennies in the dollar, as you say, and like, pick up all those depositors and like, and are willing to absorb any withdrawals. And like, they, they take all the kind of the assets and liabilities and then they hold to maturity because they can, because they have a much stronger balance sheet, if you will, most likely. But the thing that I am thinking about is like the game theory of like, how long do you wait? You know, obviously there's a bit of a, you wait as long as possible.
00:10:48.776 - 00:11:40.278, Speaker A: To get, if you're a bank, you wait as long as possible. But right before it goes into receivership, because I said there's two options, there's really three options. The third option is what happened to Silicon Valley bank on March 10 when the California Department of Financial Protection took possession of and closed, forced, closed down SVB, and then March 12, when signature bank was closed by the New York State Department of Financial Services, that the NYSDF, that's like, I think the worst case here is if it goes into receivership, which just means that, like, a regulatory authority or government agency takes control of the bank, takes control of the assets. Usually the goal there is liquidate. You liquidate the bank's assets to repay the creditors. So I think if you're a bank or a private equity firm, you essentially, and you're trying to optimize for the deal, you're basically trying to take First Republic to the brink of receivership but not let it go into receivership. That's my understanding of this.
00:11:40.406 - 00:12:36.470, Speaker B: Yeah, I think you're right. The only question is, like, well, what about other banks and the potential cascading effects of people? Like, there is a lot of jitterness, fear in the market. If this really goes to that level, I wonder if it's going to trigger a whole cascading effect of bank runs on other banks. And then, of course, the thing that most people are now looking at is commercial real estate and banks that have a big exposure to commercial real estate. And, you know, and so, yeah, if you're the Fed, if you're Jamie Dimon, I understand, like, look, not every bank is Silicon Valley bank, right? There's some great charts going around in terms of the exposure they have to commercial real estate to some concentration in terms of industry region. Right. A lot of the bigger banks, bank of America, JPMorgan, I mean, they have a very diversified portfolio.
00:12:36.470 - 00:13:09.764, Speaker B: Their exposure to commercial real estate is fairly lower relative to other banks or there's no particular exposure to any given industry. Right. So, look, all those things matter. But I do think that by and large, like, I think I do worry about the second order effects of really letting it, pushing it farther and farther to that point of being very close to being taken into receivership and someone's shipping in and buying it like a JP Morgan in terms of just general confidence in the market and depositors.
00:13:10.184 - 00:13:30.472, Speaker A: So bitcoin I'm looking at the chart right now. Bitcoin pumped 10% basically on news that First Republic was struggling and it started the week around 27. Pumped all the way up to 29. What is this number? 29? Nine. We almost touched 30. So I thought Nick Carter had the best take on this, which is. He tweeted out.
00:13:30.472 - 00:14:10.110, Speaker A: He said the fact that bitcoin almost mechanically rallies on news of bank failures is one of the most validating phenomena I've experienced in a decade of doing this. He said, to be clear, I don't want banks to be to fail. And I'm dismayed at how Fed policy has zombified the sector, which will surely slow growth. But having bitcoin act in this manner is remarkable nonetheless. Then he said, which I think is a good take. Also, I suspect the reason bitcoin behaves this way is not because of some long bitcoin short the banker narrative, but because each bank failure drives the Fed closer and closer to the liquidity bazooka, driving down the denominator in BTC USD. I think that's a good take.
00:14:10.302 - 00:14:36.306, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's right. It all really comes down to liquidity. And as soon as the Fed really dried up liquidity, then you saw a huge correction in markets, including crypto. And so, yeah, I mean, I think a lot of folks are just. It's tricky, right. Because before that there was really two headline inflation numbers, one in the UK, one in Japan, that was really sticky, fairly high. In the UK, I think it was ten.
00:14:36.306 - 00:15:21.582, Speaker B: Japan also recorded record inflation. And so those two things, I think the market really kind of responded to that. And I think it was like last Friday and Thursday. And so this sort of sticky inflation narrative is something that I think folks will continue to hear. But of course, specific to the US is sort of bank failure situation, really. And the short of it is if you keep raising rates, then that poses a huge problem to folks like Silicon Valley bank that had a huge portfolio of bonds for every increase. Basically, if you need to mark them down, if you have liquidity crunch, then it becomes very problematic where it creates a shortfall and a mismatch between assets and liabilities.
00:15:21.582 - 00:15:32.194, Speaker B: So, yeah, if they raise to 4.55, then yeah, there will be more pain in the banks and more bank runs. And so I think they're probably not going to let that happen.
00:15:32.614 - 00:16:11.558, Speaker A: Agreed. One of the most interesting things to look for in the next market, I think, is going to be the correlation between the spy and BTC. Because I think if you. A lot of remember when Paul Tudor Jones was like, bitcoin's the fastest horse in the race? I think that basically unlocked a lot of hedge funds to start maybe not allocating to bitcoin, but at least looking at bitcoin. And so before that, they probably didn't have these complex correlation models. And after that, they probably, I think a lot of them basically set up their correlation models from the 2020 to 2022 era when bitcoin and s and p were actually highly correlated. And I think one of the interesting things that.
00:16:11.558 - 00:16:22.734, Speaker A: That we should all look for is, like, if there's decorrelation between bitcoin and the s and P decoration ends up creating long term flows. So that's probably something to look for here.
00:16:23.794 - 00:16:35.934, Speaker B: Yeah, hello. Well, is it? I mean, correlation is always a funny thing, right? Because people use. It's very sensitive to the particular date that you're using in the time period.
00:16:36.234 - 00:16:43.474, Speaker A: Well, that's what I'm saying. I think we're using. I think a lot of asset allocators use that. 2020 to 2022, you go even further.
00:16:43.594 - 00:16:58.894, Speaker B: People were just using the correlation since, like, inception. And the problem was, you never really had a global financial crisis. You never had a liquidity crunch. You at record low interest rates, like, everything was pumping. Guys, it's not an uncorrelated asset class. Like, I never bought that argument. I still don't buy it going forward.
00:16:58.894 - 00:17:08.534, Speaker B: I think simplistically, and I don't want to over intellectualize things, is I think if crypto rallies initially, it'll be just purely because there's way more liquidity in the market.
00:17:08.834 - 00:17:12.202, Speaker A: You think everything pumps and bitcoins further out on the spectrum, so. Bitcoin?
00:17:12.258 - 00:17:13.318, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely.
00:17:13.426 - 00:17:13.926, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:17:14.030 - 00:17:38.994, Speaker B: That, like, I don't want to. As much as I'm a believer, we talk about, like, we bring in great founders, we talk about the promise of the technology. But another part of me just is acutely aware that it's. It's really high on the risk spectrum and naturally has a way higher beta. So, yeah, you get more liquidity in the market, it's going to flow into this high risk asset, and it's going to have exhibit a higher beta than the spy. That's it.
00:17:39.134 - 00:17:49.170, Speaker A: Yeah. Agreed. Um, all right, next topic. I have a quick interlude, though. One is, um, Thousand X podcast is back. You're probably listening to this on a Friday or Saturday.
00:17:49.322 - 00:17:49.634, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:17:49.674 - 00:18:08.336, Speaker A: Avi and Jonah brought back thousand X podcast after a couple month delay because of some compliance issues. So, uh, that was episode two of thousand X. It goes live on the empire feed. So if you're listening to this, you hopefully saw it yesterday, but if you didn't listen, you can, you can listen. 1000 X is just a show. Buy traders for traders. Really good show.
00:18:08.336 - 00:18:35.836, Speaker A: So go listen to that. The second is blockworks is hiring. We have a bunch of open roles, but one role that might be interesting to listeners of this is a director of podcast role. So we have seven shows at podcasts at blockworks. I want to say now we'll probably end the year around ten shows in the network. We're launching a couple more in Q two and Q three. This is we are hiring someone to oversee the entire network.
00:18:35.836 - 00:19:04.044, Speaker A: So if you really deep in the weeds with crypto, you like macro a little bit. You have ideas on like how to grow content and like ideas on how to make content like Empire even better, how to grow shows you're comfortable working with talent like Santi. Real pain in the ass. Tough job. So yeah, we're hiring this role. It's a director podcast. So if you have experience with podcasts or content and that sounds interesting to you, just, yeah, dm me on Twitter.
00:19:04.164 - 00:19:44.820, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's one of the greatest roles because I think the challenge for crypto has always been how do we keep people engaged. I think what we're trying to do here is just create pure, as much as unbiased educational content for people to really learn about this space. But growing that audience and acquiring that and keeping engagement high is a challenge, a good one. I think how we present crypto to mass audience and really keep them engaged and it's been really rewarding. You and I have been both in situations where we're in a random place and it's not your crypto native, it's like a pilot in an airplane and it's sort of like some random other person in the people listening, so they're interested. So all we got to do is just, I think that's really the challenge and the opportunity for someone to come into this role and really help us with that.
00:19:45.012 - 00:20:34.956, Speaker A: Yep, agreed. Valora is the ultimate wallet for exploring the celo ecosystem.

00:20:49.154 - 00:20:53.810, Speaker B: We can talk about that. We can also talk about the episode we just recorded yesterday.
00:20:53.922 - 00:20:55.178, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, let's do that.
00:20:55.306 - 00:21:51.144, Speaker B: Let's do that for like, we had a great episode on this question of can we decentralize sequencers? Because it keeps coming up, right? Like, scalability as an overarching topic is something that we're going to continue to cover here because it's important, right. It's, it's, it's one of those things that, uh, you know, you have optimism and arbitrum and Coinbase base and Zk, some Zk implementations, like, it's going to be. It's probably one of the most important phenomenon happening in crypto right now. But the question, and, you know, a number of people raised this question, is the problem with a lot of l two s and the architecture between ethereum l one l two is, is that you have the sequencer and it's centralized at the moment. And so that has, the question is, can you actually get to a point where it's decentralized with a compromising performance? And we all kind of want to progressively decentralize these systems. So we brought on. Maybe you can talk about who we brought on and how the episode went.
00:21:51.304 - 00:22:27.052, Speaker A: Yeah, we brought on Ben, who's the CEO of. So there are three companies that are building out decentralized sequencer layers. There's espresso, Astria, and Radius. And we brought on the CEO's of Espresso and Astria. Ben is the CEO of Espresso. Espresso was working on, actually a privacy l one, and ran into a bunch of issues around, I think, decentralizing sequencers also, I'm pretty sure privacy just maybe isn't as interesting to users as they originally thought it was going to be. And then Josh is building Astria, which is approaching the same problem, but attacking it from a slightly different angle.
00:22:27.052 - 00:23:21.824, Speaker A: They're both working on decentralizing sequencers and attacking it from different angles. If you think about what a blockchain does, you have to make the data available, that's the DA layer. Then you have to order everything, and then you have to execute the transactions. And what they're doing with the sequencers is basically trying, if you have a centralized sequencer, that second step of ordering everything. Again, this is my understanding after getting the breakdown from Josh and Ben, is the group that orders those transactions right now, oftentimes is just one party, and they're working to make that many, many, many different parties, which is decentralizing the sequencer. My take is that we're still really early, but I'm happy that someone is focusing specifically on this issue, because it seems like a huge issue. I originally, the why didn't fully make sense to me.
00:23:21.824 - 00:23:42.434, Speaker A: I get the why. For a user, there's a bunch of risks of having one centralized sequencer. There's censorship risks. There's reordering, there's the fact that it could go down. There's monopolistic behavior. Those are like the risks of a centralized sequencer. The, I didn't fully understand the, like why of Y and l two.
00:23:42.434 - 00:23:59.538, Speaker A: So right now, like, if you have a centralized sequencer, that's a honey pot for Mev, basically, and you can make a bunch of money, why would an l two want to decentralize the sequencer? Like, that answer, I think, wasn't as tight as it. As it could have been. But overall, I thought it was a really good episode. What'd you think?
00:23:59.586 - 00:24:58.792, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree with you all. Everything you said is super important. And I agree with, I did ask them this question of, like, what's the worst that can happen for a user at the moment if they're interacting with optimism and arbitrum? And, you know, Ben gave a more kind of nuanced answer, but it was not like, super clear. I do think that, you know, I guess I also asked him, like, why do you think a team like optimism and arbitrum haven't done this already? Because, of course, some people raise this question of if something is centralized, then you can have some regulatory issues with that. If there's one particular party that it is centralized, the sequencer, then you'd want to decentralize that. We've had the guys of arbitram on the pod talking about this. Fundamentally, I think that, you know, I guess I'll take a different take, which is users.
00:24:58.792 - 00:26:04.714, Speaker B: The question is, will users really appreciate the fact that it's centralized today? Because what are the incentives for arbitrary to fork? Or what are the incentives for arbitrary to really be super extractive on Mev? Right. The sequencer itself because it will degrade the user experience. The incentive is not really there for them to do certainly highly monopolistic stuff that degrades the user experience because users can always go to alternative l two. On the other end of the spectrum, if you decentralize the sequencer, but the tech is really not there or it degrades performance, users will probably notice that and be perhaps more critical of that and then go to maybe another l two. You see what I mean? If, for instance, one l two decides to decentralize the sequencer and another one does not, and all of a sudden fees are much higher in that other system, or transactions are slower to process. I wonder what happens there from a user perspective. I think blockchain history tells us that they will really focus on higher fees and slower transactions.
00:26:04.714 - 00:26:43.222, Speaker B: I'm going to go to another environment that's just a state of user experience and user behavior. Yeah, it'll be really interesting. It does feel early to me. I, at the end of the podcast, I asked them, hey, like, are we a year out, two years out? Like when are we actually going to see these systems, like decentralized sequencer go live? And they both seem to think that it was going to happen sooner or later, like within six months, they said, I believe, like they referenced ECC, which is actually coming up this summer. And so, you know, be fairly interesting. It is no different, like decentralizing a sequencer. And as they would say, is no different than like kind of bootstrapping your own l one.
00:26:43.222 - 00:27:01.834, Speaker B: Right. Also reminds me a lot of the history of Lido, like bootstrapping, like a decentralized validator set. Right? So it's more of an economic challenge, not a technical challenge, as they said. But, you know, it'll be interesting to see how both teams kind of develop and work their way towards actually getting this live.
00:27:02.214 - 00:27:15.564, Speaker A: What did you think about it in light of Tushar's comment from the Multicoin podcast about that? Yeah, once, I think you said that once l two start to decentralize, you have to add consensus for agreement. And at that point, why not just use an l one?
00:27:17.144 - 00:27:59.580, Speaker B: Yeah, that's sort of like the biggest question in my mind. Right. And I don't think I have a. It's one of those things you're really not going to know until they, they go live. I don't know, really, because, because, I mean, you both, you heard both, you heard both of them say decentralizing a sequencer is no different than like bootstrapping your own l one which kind of coincides with Tushar is saying the nuance, of course, is like, on the performance side of things and the execution side of things. And that I'm not. I'm not sure on, to be honest.
00:27:59.692 - 00:28:37.528, Speaker A: I think here's. I think here's the counter argument to Tushar's take, is that adding consensus, and Tushar's definition of this, adding a consensus layer now makes you an l one, basically. But in reality, adding a consensus doesn't turn you into an l one. An l one consensus is responsible for ordering censorship resistance, providing data availability and validity guarantees to the light nodes. The. The l two consensus does not do any of that. So I think consensus on l one versus l two, like, does different things, that.
00:28:37.528 - 00:28:41.844, Speaker A: That's my middle point curve take on that. Yeah, yeah.
00:28:43.264 - 00:29:06.964, Speaker B: There is still some. There is still some consensus, but I guess what you're saying is the intensity or the consensus is not the same for an l one than an l two. Even in a state where you decentralize a sequencer, the level of effort and the. The consensus that is required is not the same as the consensus required for an l one. Therefore, the argument does not necessarily hold two shorts argument.
00:29:07.124 - 00:29:25.962, Speaker A: We are getting beyond my ability to argue with this stuff, but my understanding is that l one consensus is responsible for ordering for censorship resistance, and for providing data availability and validity guarantees to the light nodes. And an l two s consensus does not. Does not do any of that. So.
00:29:26.098 - 00:29:26.818, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:29:26.986 - 00:29:52.774, Speaker A: Yeah, it would actually. I wish we. I wish I had done my research on shared sequencers before recording the multicoin episode so that we could have had that kind of conversation with Tushar. So I actually think it'd be really interesting to. There's, like, this panel that I want to put together. Maybe it permissionless, which is Tushar, maybe like Steven from arbitrum, and then like Ben or Josh on shared sequencers. I think that's a really interesting conversation.
00:29:53.134 - 00:29:55.670, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah, I agree. That'll be nice.
00:29:55.782 - 00:29:59.502, Speaker A: Yeah. All right, that episode comes out on Tuesday. Give it a listen, folks.
00:29:59.638 - 00:30:00.286, Speaker B: Yep.
00:30:00.430 - 00:30:18.878, Speaker A: Speaking of shared sequencers. Solana. Mad lads. Mad lads minted. Mad lads minted. And it was really interesting. So, I mean, big shout out to Tristan and who's the other guy? Armani on Mad lads.
00:30:18.878 - 00:30:54.758, Speaker A: They minted it, like, seven Solana. And the floor is now 83 Solana. I think it is, like, objectively the most successful mint in the last year or two. So just hats off there. I think there's a more interesting thing, though, which is the Solana worked very, very well through this whole mint. I mean, the backpack app got DDoS attacked, so they, it kind of broke on day one or day two. But, like, Solana worked really, really well through all of this, whereas ETH gets hammered every time on these big mints.
00:30:54.758 - 00:31:48.534, Speaker A: And I think there's a conversation to be had around state compression and, yeah, just like NFT compression. And I think if you actually look at Solana with compression, it's a couple of orders of magnitude cheaper than its closest peers. And, like, I think it was Chris Berniske did these numbers. It cost $200 to mint and deliver nfts to 10 million users on Solana using state compression. If you think about, like, the evolution of nfts, nfts in 2021 were these, like, expensive and exclusive things. And if you believe that in the coming years they're going to become ubiquitous and driving experimentation at the bleeding edge of kind of, like, audience meets creation, that connection that happens there and that nfts will sit in the middle of that, I don't know. Solana performed pretty well here with, with mad lads.
00:31:48.614 - 00:32:17.004, Speaker B: So, yeah, yeah, I'll be really interesting. Obviously, it also was most recently who called the death of nfts some. Which boarding was right or. Yeah, someone. It was more. And so, generally speaking, I feel like it's very interesting to see a success of an NFT project in Solana. We'll see how the floor holds and the retention piece of it.
00:32:17.004 - 00:32:48.804, Speaker B: A lot of these NFT projects have a very short half life. It's getting all the hype and look, there's renewed excitement, and the Solana community has gone through a lot. And I guess it's a breath of fresh air for a lot of folks that it faded Solana. Yeah, it's great to see. I generally think that success of nfts in any ecosystem is positive because I got to think that they onboard incremental users into the space. It's just a great funnel. So, yeah.
00:32:48.964 - 00:32:52.064, Speaker A: Did you invest in either magic Eden or tensor?
00:32:54.444 - 00:32:57.324, Speaker B: Nope. Did you?
00:32:57.404 - 00:33:17.124, Speaker A: Well, um. No, I didn't, I didn't. But the reason I bring it up is because. So those, for those who aren't in NFT, Solana NFT land, those are the two leading marketplace. NFT marketplaces magic eden team of about 100 people. They've raised nine figures in VC funding. Tensor is two devs.
00:33:17.124 - 00:33:48.364, Speaker A: Two devs in, I think, New York, actually. One of them was at two Sigma, was on the research side at two Sigma. The other one, I don't know where they came from. But I think trading trading world, just two really, really smart developers and I actually, I mean, so tensor just flipped magic Eden for, like, NFT volume on Solana, and love to see it. Got two developers beating out a team of 100 who raised over 100 million in venture funding, so. And they haven't launched a token, so nicely done, tensor, folks.
00:33:48.404 - 00:33:57.198, Speaker B: There you go. Yeah, it's like a blur opensea kind of thing. I mean, blur now employs a bit more people, but for a while, it was just a very lean and mean team.
00:33:57.366 - 00:34:05.838, Speaker A: Yeah. So shout, yeah, shout out to tensor. What would make you change your mind on Solana Santu?
00:34:05.966 - 00:34:36.953, Speaker B: I don't understand why people think I'm, like, bearish folks. I had exposure to Solana. First of all, I invested in very early on, both through being an LP and multicoin. So I had exposure to that. Second, at paraphy, right. We bought at, you know, as part of a consortium, like, other funds invested as well. I've had close communications with Ben Tolly.
00:34:36.953 - 00:34:53.345, Speaker B: I've been in. I've been breakpoint a number of times. Like, I'm not bearish on slack. I'm critical of, like, any system. No, no, I gotta say, like, even I got it wrong, too. I mean, I got, like, a lot of the slack Solana community and saying, like, hey, there's no reorg here. Like, you should really understand how it works.
00:34:53.345 - 00:35:13.025, Speaker B: And, look, I I was wrong. Right. And so I would. I would agree that I'm not as close to the Solana ecosystem as I am to the Ethereum by virtue of my portfolio companies. A lot of them are in Ethereum. Um, but I've made a number of investments. Probably between 15% to 20% of my portfolio is.
00:35:13.025 - 00:35:30.124, Speaker B: Has exposure or is working, deploying in Solana. So, yeah, like, it matters, and. But I'm not, like, as close to it. That's just the reality of things. And I've said it time and time again. I was not in this podcast. It was in.
00:35:30.124 - 00:36:37.976, Speaker B: I was being interviewed, another podcast, and I said, we were talking about, like, what defines communities, which I've always found to be a very fluffy construct and term which people throw around lightly. But I do think that Solana has always struck me as if I already defined, like, a number of ecosystems. I think Solana is far more different than perhaps other EVM L1s, not only from an architecture perspective, but also from just the DNA of Solana. If I were to summarize, it is, like, very resilient. We've had Anatolia here talk about how they've gotten a lot of shit from the Ethereum community and others in crypto, and they've actually used that to re architect and change some dynamics, including, for instance, how they determine fees, which is not just one flat fee, it's just based on depending. They've re architected the fee model in Solana, which I think is fascinating and I think is one of the more important things that Solana has. It's like, in reality, it's like Uber, right? You have surge pricing in a particular geography.
00:36:37.976 - 00:37:12.014, Speaker B: You have surge pricing in New York. That doesn't affect surge pricing in Bangalore. Folks shouldn't. And so, like, those kind of, their willingness to be very malleable and actually adapt is, is very interesting. I think they're going through a pretty important moment, like Ethereum did after the Dow hack that will really define their community and really harden them and they'll survive. Like, I, in private conversations, I just had a price in mind, and after it hit, it was goodbye in my mind. In my book, like sub ten.
00:37:12.014 - 00:37:57.670, Speaker B: But more importantly, I think the other piece that I want to talk about is the Solana phone, which a lot of people are now getting. And that type of thinking and out of the box thinking is what you see in companies like Apple that just created, like, a new category, like an iPad. Like, of course, they're not creating necessarily, it's an Android phone. But when you think about the friction points in crypto of onboarding, like, having a phone like that is the type of thinking that can get, can go, can get very, like, the upside of that experiment is very high. And I think that is perhaps one of the more interesting things and a highlight of the team behind Solana and their willingness to, like, experiment with these kind of things. So, yeah. Long answer.
00:37:57.670 - 00:38:12.274, Speaker B: Like, I'm not an expert in Solana. No. By any stretch, I'm, like, acutely aware of that, but I pay attention to that. And it's the second ecosystem that I'm mostly most excited in terms of where I put my dollars to work. Does that make sense?
00:38:12.654 - 00:38:14.114, Speaker A: Did I strike a nerve there?
00:38:14.934 - 00:38:55.826, Speaker B: No, I mean, like, I want to just clarify it because sometimes just people think that I am, of course, biased. It would be dumb for me to, like, I just, I just do, like, I. Where I put my money to work is where I'm most invested. So obviously, Solana is not like, it's like the multicore guys, right? The multicore, look at the world and then through Solana architecture, and they think that's the greatest and greatest. I just sort of, like, I've never been a maximalist. Like, I'm aware that I think we're perhaps more early than not. And any sort of rigidity in your thinking is going to be like, is really going to cost you and more.
00:38:55.826 - 00:39:20.366, Speaker B: So how things get implemented now, where ideas spread much faster and these projects and experiments get a lot of traction and die much faster. And so the half life of that. So you can't really just. Is there a version here and probability that ethereum is not the dominant l one? Absolutely. It's greater than 5%. I think, like, the race is not one yet. Primarily because we have like, a few million users in crypto active, much less than that.
00:39:20.366 - 00:39:39.554, Speaker B: So, like, can't really say. Right. Um, so the barriers to entry and open source systems are lower and so people can just switch very quickly as a lot of projects left Solana during this crisis to go elsewhere and now are wondering, was that a good choice now they can always come back. Right.
00:39:41.154 - 00:39:44.170, Speaker A: So you bought, you, you bought Seoul in q one?
00:39:44.362 - 00:39:54.098, Speaker B: Yeah, I had a number of mine when it dipped below ten. Below ten, like, it hit 830 something, or I was like, okay, that was the overdose.
00:39:54.186 - 00:39:55.554, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:39:55.594 - 00:40:43.658, Speaker B: So, you know, it's always like when the pendulums, the traditional investor that I follow the most, and he has a great memo now about like, bank runs and all this stuff, is Howard Marks. And he is also always one of the things that I've read, he has also a great book, like the most important thing. I think it's a great book, but his memos are free and you can access them on his oak tree website. And the thing that has always stuck on me is price is the most important thing. Now, how you determine fair value of an asset is another, but prices can make, you can buy a great asset at a terrible price, and it makes for a terrible investment. You can buy a terrible asset at a fantastic price. First Republic, for instance, maybe you think it's a terrible asset.
00:40:43.658 - 00:41:25.134, Speaker B: Maybe it's a shady asset, not as pristine. But if you buy that for a dollar, it's great. Like UBs, for instance, like their acquisition of Credit Suisse, they'll print because they just got it basically for free. So anyways, um, I think that's what I. Yeah, tangent. But I love how marks and I think price, price is difficult to ascertain in crypto, but I guess you just sort of like when you see something really get pounded on and the sentiment, uh, gauging by the, you know, sentiment on Twitter or just crypto, generally, that just sort of tends to be a good indicator of when to enter or exit a market.
00:41:26.014 - 00:41:31.074, Speaker A: Agreed. Glad we got you on Solana.
00:41:31.374 - 00:41:36.566, Speaker B: You got me. You got me, folks. Okay, can we talk about something? I'm actually really interested to hear your take.
00:41:36.590 - 00:41:41.074, Speaker A: Now, I can tell these Twitter comments we're getting to you about, like.
00:41:42.934 - 00:42:01.146, Speaker B: Stop asking questions. I'm gonna ask you a question. Question is. So we had the genius of chamath say that crypto is dead. I think the media, like the headline was, he said that crypto is dead. But I think he meant to say, like, crypto is dead in the US, but not to infer that the crypto as a whole was dead. And there's no promise there.
00:42:01.146 - 00:42:02.654, Speaker B: I'm curious what you think of that.
00:42:04.874 - 00:42:43.036, Speaker A: If you don't spend time, and if you don't spend time in crypto every day. I completely understand how you think that crypto is dead, but to me, that is just a telltale sign that someone doesn't actually spend any time in the industry, because let's look at what we have going on today. You have all this stuff happening with Solana that we're talking about. You have these amazing conversations happening around Mev, like, this whole episode of Bell Curve or season of Bell Curve with Mev. Super interesting. Some of the smartest people I know right now working on what should happen with Mev. You have l two s, like, optimism and bass and arbitrum and all this great stuff happening on l two s.
00:42:43.036 - 00:43:07.744, Speaker A: You have, like, these brilliant minds who have, like, quit Google to go work on figuring out shared sequencers. You have, like, nfts making a comeback right now. Like, with. With the hottest nft drop in, like, the last probably two years with mad lads. Um, you have different, uh, you have, like, this whole cosmos ecosystem, like, kind of trying to figure it out, but, like, doing some really interesting stuff. I I just think that. That.
00:43:07.744 - 00:43:26.840, Speaker A: That just tells me, like, they don't spend any time, and it's not if you. But, but, like, I don't fault them. I don't know. Like, chamath is investing in nuclear and, like, fusion and, like, carbon credits, I heard, is his new thing. Like, I'm. I don't know. Uh, and that.
00:43:26.840 - 00:43:46.676, Speaker A: That doesn't. That doesn't shock me that he. That he thinks that crypto is dead. But if you spend any time in. In crypto right now, you would obviously know that you. You have the ERC 4626, the Tokenvault standard going to come out soon that everyone's going to be talking about. You have like Zke evms, you have the saga phone launch, you have like liquid staking derivatives.
00:43:46.676 - 00:44:04.618, Speaker A: Like, LSDFI is going to be a thing in like q three, q four. You have like, yeah, roll up sequencer, decentralization, payment for order flow, and like the Mev latency wars. There's just so much happening right now in crypto. It's so that just tells me that he's not spending any time in crypto. That's fine. He'll come back.
00:44:04.706 - 00:44:36.382, Speaker B: Yeah, he was early in bitcoin and then he like, sold a bunch because he bought a house in Tahoe, bitcoin, and that cost him dearly. I think he could have probably bought a whole lot of Tahoe with bitcoin that he transacted with for that parcel of the land. Talking about like, exciting developments. I think, you know, a couple of things that I think we mentioned here that are gathering our attention. I'd say there's been a lot of surge in base. This is Coinbase l two. There's been a lot of this still in Testnet, like a lot of deployed contracts in Testnet.
00:44:36.382 - 00:44:44.550, Speaker B: I heard, obviously ave sushi, a number of other projects really kind of like, you know, lining up. There's still a lot of questions of how that's going to operate.
00:44:44.582 - 00:44:44.702, Speaker A: Right.
00:44:44.718 - 00:45:22.346, Speaker B: Is it going to be have decentralized sequencer? What's going to be the validator set? You're going to have to have Kyc, are you not? Yeah, I don't know if there's anything you'd add to that. But anyways, this is probably the thing that I'm following the most in terms of, like, developments. Obviously, the decentralized sequencer is farther out, but like, in real time, this might be the most important thing because I really want to track, you know, the onboarding from like Coinbase exchange users in the millions into, you know, this. L two, I think that that alone is going to, could potentially be the biggest catalyst that we're going to see, um, the cycle.
00:45:22.490 - 00:45:57.036, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, so if you're looking. So blockworks research put together, um, a chart on, uh, on the daily contract deployments for base versus ethereum. And if you look at base, it's like, I don't know, somewhere like around ten k contracts deployed every single day. And if you look at, uh, base, it's, what is it right now, 60k, but earlier this month is like over one hundred k a day on base. So that, I mean, that's pretty impressive. I think there's actually a third bucket by the way in terms of decentralizing the sequencer. So if you look at Coinbase, they have a fully centralized sequencer network.
00:45:57.036 - 00:46:34.888, Speaker A: And if you talk to Astria or espresso, and if you listen to this podcast that goes live on Tuesday, that's a fully decentralized sequencer network. I bet Coinbase will do a third option, which is one by one, adding very methodically decentralizing the sequencer. I bet they will pick another big company in crypto, for example, that is very comfortable running nodes or something like that, to be the second to decentralize the sequencer by one. So then there's two, and then they'll pick another one and then there's three. I think that's how Coinbase will probably decentralize their sequencer.
00:46:35.056 - 00:47:20.622, Speaker B: Yeah. Speaking of really exciting developments in l two s, I mean, I'm really curious to get your take. Franklin Templeton launched, announced. This was yesterday. Franklin Templeton is one of the largest kind of mutual funds in the world, I'd say. But they announced that the Franklin on chain us government money fund is going to be the first registered us, the first US registered mutual fund to use a public blockchain, in this case polygon, to process, transaction and record ownership. So basically if you have like one share of, you know, this mutual money, this money fund, Fob xxx, is represented by one Benji Token.
00:47:20.622 - 00:48:31.896, Speaker B: And this sits and lives in Polygon. And so if you're a token holder, you can exposure to the fund which invests mostly in I believe like treasuries or whatnot. And you have like their own app. And in the app you can see kind of this token which is like the represents basically maps one, one. Um, it's interesting, I, I'm, I'm curious to get your take because like you saw like maker basically kind of go their own route and have to set up as a Dao like touch, you know, the real world. And you know, to get to buy treasuries, like does this mean that, you know, basically you can buy Benji tokens and get exposure to like, can you do the reverse? Right. If you don't have like a broker, if you don't have like a, an account with Frank and Templeton or whatever, or like some other, you know, Schwab or fidelity, can you just buy the Benji token and that gives you access to the money fund? And if you do that, do you have to like Kyc, do you have to do some like basically other process to like get on boarded? Does this only mean that like you can only is it just one way.
00:48:31.896 - 00:48:59.972, Speaker B: What you. This token is kind of like restricted only to people that I've like, have access to. Anyways, a whole host of questions. But what's really exciting is to see someone like that come in and one, make the choice of Polygon. And two, I think this is the first of potentially many of their products that they decide to register ownership and kind of transactions on chain, which is very exciting, I'd say.
00:49:00.128 - 00:49:15.668, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, Franklin Templeton, it's cool to see. Making a big push into crypto. There's their CEO spoke at a consensus yesterday. I think it was like they've got a whole Franklin Templeton digital assets, like division now. I think it's kind of cool. I think it's cool that you know.
00:49:15.676 - 00:49:21.224, Speaker B: How big that is. What these like, five people are? Like, 2030, 4000 people?
00:49:21.844 - 00:49:30.490, Speaker A: I don't know. I don't know. I'm not sure. But I know they have 1.5 or 1.6 or 7 trillion aum. I mean, they're colossal.
00:49:30.490 - 00:49:42.934, Speaker A: They're like a third of the size of fidelity. It's a huge group, so I know it is. I have something that I don't think anyone has reported on. We didn't. I don't think we've written about this. I don't think any other media companies covered this, which is. I was looking at the.
00:49:42.934 - 00:49:55.594, Speaker A: Look at the fund structure and the expense ratio is 8.76%.
00:49:55.754 - 00:49:57.162, Speaker B: Holy smokes.
00:49:57.338 - 00:50:11.094, Speaker A: When this goes live in at the end of July, that will make this the world's most expensive money market fund. I don't know if that's a typo. I don't know if that's a like. I mean, they're off by owner.
00:50:11.434 - 00:50:13.794, Speaker B: Can you send me a link? Like, you know.
00:50:13.954 - 00:50:14.322, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:50:14.378 - 00:50:29.154, Speaker B: Where we usually communicate that that's. I mean, if that's true. Holy smokes. You make it for context. The expense ratio of most funds is like 0.04%. Like 0.1% would make it an expensive.
00:50:30.374 - 00:50:33.510, Speaker A: Here, look at your. Look at that message I just sent you.
00:50:33.702 - 00:50:35.414, Speaker B: No. Okay, hold on.
00:50:35.534 - 00:50:52.610, Speaker A: Now they're waving. No, you're. There's a fee waiver and expense reimbursement. But why would that. Why would the total annual fund operating expenses be 8.76%? That is the world's most expensive money market fund. Explain that to me.
00:50:52.802 - 00:51:23.374, Speaker B: Is that like a buffer? It's saying the investment manager has contractually agreed to waive or assume certain fees and expenses. In this case, the 8.6%. So that total annual fund operating expenses, excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, and certain non routine expenses, yada, yada, yada, related to litigation, indemnification, reorganization, liquidation, from, for the fund to not exceed 0.2%, which is more standard for most of these type of products until July 31, 2023. So they're only waiving it for this period.
00:51:24.394 - 00:51:43.720, Speaker A: Okay. Look at the thing I just sent you. So this is their actual website. So then if you actually click the little thing above the expense ratio, it says expense ratio 8.76%. And then if you look at the gross expense ratio, this is in like size two font here says, reflects the total annual operating expenses for the share class shown.
00:51:43.912 - 00:51:44.672, Speaker B: Mm hmm.
00:51:44.768 - 00:51:47.320, Speaker A: I mean, then this reimbursement goes away over time.
00:51:47.512 - 00:51:50.924, Speaker B: Well, basically. And it's only for like two months.
00:51:52.024 - 00:51:55.280, Speaker A: Yeah. So at the end of the summer, this is going to be the.
00:51:55.312 - 00:52:37.456, Speaker B: Who's going to buy this money in the world? This makes no sense. Like, I'm sorry, but, you know, that's like, who in their right mind is going to do this? That was like my initial question. Right. Maybe it's. They're assuming and banking on this, like, somewhat predatory behavior, which is the people that are going to buy this product have basically no access to this fund structure in a normal situation. So they're gonna buy this token and, you know, get exposure to this fund. Yeah, but it's, it's quite strange, actually.
00:52:37.640 - 00:52:41.096, Speaker A: Yeah. All right, I have one more thing, and then I gotta wrap because I've.
00:52:41.200 - 00:52:54.400, Speaker B: Yeah, I was just saying, this is just a reminder, folks, but great catch, by the way, because the headline is very bullish. I'm curious, who buys this stuff? Like, they're gonna get like, you know, it's like the Coinbase NFT launch. You're gonna have like $2 people invested in this thing and then realize, yeah.
00:52:54.472 - 00:52:57.512, Speaker A: I don't get it. But I do want to highlight someone.
00:52:57.568 - 00:53:01.940, Speaker B: From Franklin Templeton or Polygon, you know, wants to come on and explain this.
00:53:02.092 - 00:53:32.974, Speaker A: Please do circle. CCTP finally actually soft launched, and I just want to give a quick overview. I talked about this a couple of months ago when they announced it, but I think it's actually, I think it's a pretty big deal. That feels technical, and so it's kind of been swept under the rug. But I think this, in case you guys miss it, CCTP allows USDC to be transferred seamlessly between chains. And it's just going to enable this, like, better cross chain ux, if you. So it's soft launched on ETH and avalanche yesterday.
00:53:32.974 - 00:53:55.494, Speaker A: CCTP stands for cross chain transfer protocol. It's basically a permissionless on chain tool from circle that facilitates USDC transfers between blockchains rather than needing liquidity on the destination chain. Circle basically just mints native USDC after burning USDC on the source chain. So if you like, basically, like most.
00:53:55.534 - 00:54:25.494, Speaker B: Bridges use this lock and mint, right? You lock an asset, one chain and then invents another. But there's this period where you have to have liquidity in one. And then there's all kinds of funky stuff that can happen. There's been hacks because of this, like, like oracle issues or whatnot. What is so interesting here is that your circle, you're basically, it's way more capital efficient. You're natively, like, they can basically burn USDC on ethereum, mint natively in Solana, or pick your l. One of choice.
00:54:25.494 - 00:55:08.454, Speaker B: And so when you think about most of the bridging is stable coins. I mean, stable coins are just massive in terms of like transaction volume and asset transfers and crypto. So this is huge. Yeah. Where do you think other bridges, does this mean? Like, I mean, of course, the question for this cross chain transfer protocol, my understanding is it strictly for USDC, but what does that mean for other assets and what does that mean for other bridges out there? It's unclear. Maybe you know this, if at some point you're going to. It's possible to like, extend this functionality to a token other than USDC.
00:55:08.954 - 00:55:28.772, Speaker A: What? I don't. Yeah, I don't fully know what happens with other bridges because as of today, metamask and ten different partner SDKs such as layer zero and wormhole have integrated with CCTP. And actually five bridges have integrated with CCTP. I need to look into, like, is this a competitor to bridges? Do the bridges integrate with them? I don't fully, I don't fully get.
00:55:28.788 - 00:55:42.858, Speaker B: It, but so I'm reading here, like, cross chain swaps, like, you can, they're saying you can like swap ETH on Ethereum for Avax on avalanche. And like, basically they're using USDC as that connective tissue, right.
00:55:42.986 - 00:56:02.354, Speaker A: But then you have USDC on avalanche, but let's say you have USDC on avalanche, but you want to buy an NFT on Ethereum. You can now seamlessly through adapt that uses CCTP. It'll route your USDC from avalanche to ETH, then swap it to ETH to purchase the NFT. So just, I mean, it creates a better user experience. Yeah.
00:56:02.394 - 00:56:19.486, Speaker B: For a lot of, for a vast number of use cases. Right? Yeah, yeah. But, um, anyways, I think this covered a lot of it. Uh, light week, but, uh, interesting development. Um, so, yeah, hope everyone has a great week. Thanks for tuning in. And, uh, yeah, keep your eye out for next week.
00:56:19.486 - 00:56:26.114, Speaker B: Uh, this, um, sequencer, decentralization, uh, pot that's going to launch, and that's going to be a good one indeed.
00:56:26.414 - 00:56:27.874, Speaker A: Be well, sir. Keep that.
00:56:29.174 - 00:56:32.534, Speaker B: Uh, I'll try for sure. All right, guys, have a great weekend. Take care.
