00:00:03.480 - 00:00:16.014, Speaker A: All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Empire. We've got the Thanksgiving edition, the turkey edition here. We're joined by, per usual, Santi. And we are joined by special guest, Mister Nick Carter. Nick, welcome to Empire, my friend.
00:00:16.174 - 00:00:18.302, Speaker B: Hello. Thanks for having me. First time.
00:00:18.478 - 00:00:20.434, Speaker A: Where are you celebrating thanksgiving, man?
00:00:20.934 - 00:00:26.318, Speaker B: In the DC area, actually, where I grew up, so finally left Miami.
00:00:26.366 - 00:00:33.364, Speaker A: All right. There you go. Yeah, I feel like you've. You've, like you've become a real, like, Miami guy now, so I'm surprised you left.
00:00:34.104 - 00:00:42.320, Speaker B: Yeah, I know. I'm really kind of lamenting it because it's like 30 degrees here and it was 80 degrees and sunny in Miami, but it happens.
00:00:42.432 - 00:00:57.376, Speaker A: Here's what we're talking about today, folks. We're talking about Genesis and DCG. We're talking about bitcoin miners. We're talking about Aave and CRV stuff. And we are talking about proof of reserves and proof of solvency. So I think the best place to start is Genesis. Let me give the as I know it situation.
00:00:57.376 - 00:01:20.898, Speaker A: It looks like Genesis is on the verge of bankruptcy. I would call it here. As reported over the weekend, Genesis was initially trying to raise a billion dollars to fill this big hole in their balance sheet. I think they asked Binance to invest. Binance declined, citing that. I think Binance cited that it could lead to a conflict of interest down the road, which I didn't fully understand. If I'm Binance, I'm like, I don't want to touch that with a ten foot pole because of us regulators.
00:01:20.898 - 00:01:58.750, Speaker A: So then basically they're trying to raise a billion that didn't work out. They then cut the desired funding in half, from a billion to 500 million. They noted on Monday that they were at risk of bankruptcy without the new funding. Now, there are fears that this, like, potential Genesis bankruptcy is spilling over to the parent company, DCG. DCG has a liability, I think, out to Genesis of about, like 550 or 575 million. That's due may of 2023. The loans, as they said, those loans were used to fund investment opportunities and to repurchase stock from non employee shareholders.
00:01:58.750 - 00:02:16.614, Speaker A: Barry sent this letter to shareholders. It was kind of this, like, basically just like, calming people's fears. Hey, we're all good. We don't need to raise capital right now. We might need to raise in the future kind of this fluffy shareholder letter, as you would expect. So, Nick, I'm just curious to get your take on the unfolding Genesis DCG situation right now.
00:02:17.634 - 00:03:07.946, Speaker B: It's a scandal. I think this revelation of the 575 line of credit out to DCG from Genesis is pretty shocking, actually. It looks like they're just plundering Genesis, dipping into the cookie jar to fund buybacks for DCG, which seems pretty irregular. Unclear what's going to happen with Genesis. Obviously, they've taken a number of different hits here, starting with UST. I think they did that disastrous trade, then moving on to all the subsequent credit events that hurt them. Now the question is, does Barry have enough family silver to sell off to keep the empire afloat? And I think it all comes down to the grayscale franchise, whether they're able.
00:03:07.946 - 00:03:34.294, Speaker B: Of course, they own roughly 10% of GBDC. Are they able to restore that discount to something manageable? Worst case, do they have to liquidate the trust or do they have to sell it off to another asset manager? He struck a brave tone and defiant tone in the note, but the reality on the ground looks pretty bleak, to be honest with you.
00:03:34.624 - 00:04:04.478, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't understand. I might be totally missing a capital allocation decision here, but I feel like we keep seeing companies that are pulling out these massive amount of, like, levering up basically to make these illiquid investment decisions. So one of the reasons they said that they took the loans out were to fund investment opportunities. When I think about an investment opportunity that's on a horizon of maybe. I mean, they have a huge portfolio of venture portfolio. Like, you don't. You don't take out six month loans or twelve month loans or 18 month loans to fund a.
00:04:04.478 - 00:04:16.450, Speaker A: An illiquid three to ten year investment strategy. I just feel like I'm missing something here. Or maybe they were just incredibly optimistic. They thought the bull market continued. But what am I missing here, Nick?
00:04:16.562 - 00:04:59.484, Speaker B: Yeah, it appears that that was the case that you get now this maturity mismatch where you have potentially short term liabilities with the withdrawals from Genesis. As we've seen this bank run like phenomena happening in the industry, and now their asset portfolio is illiquid. It's DCG equity. It's unclear how easy it is for them to actually render that liquid. Or it might be the remainder of the DCG portfolio, which is a lot of private equity. I'm not at all comparing it to FTX in terms of FTX was clearly incredibly mismanaged. I'm not saying that's the case with DCG, but I agree Genesis has short term obligations.
00:04:59.484 - 00:05:17.200, Speaker B: But unfortunately, it appears that a lot of their liquid capital was redeployed into illiquid long term assets. And now they're in this huge mess trying to raise capital on short notice, which I think they probably will be able to do, but it's not an enviable situation.
00:05:17.232 - 00:05:18.832, Speaker A: Do you think they'll be able to raise the capital, you're saying?
00:05:18.888 - 00:05:45.700, Speaker B: Yeah, I think they have a number of avenues to do that. The DCG family has all sorts of different things. They have the enormous venture portfolio. They've been among the most prolific venture investors in the crypto space. They have liquid crypto assets. They hold GBDC. Of course, that is not at a valuation where you'd want to sell it right now.
00:05:45.700 - 00:05:59.436, Speaker B: And then they have this cash generative asset in the form of grayscale, with the fee stream associated. So I don't know, overall, I think they do have sort of avenues here. But, yeah, I mean, kind of a tough situation. They found themselves.
00:05:59.500 - 00:06:28.664, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I guess if you're DCG, they a bunch of. I mean, they're basically sitting with a balance sheet. They have debt that exceeds their assets, right. And they have limited liquidity, but they also have grayscale, which produces like, spits off like 250 or 300 million a year in fees. And their aum is locked. So I guess DCG, the hold company, should be able to raise money if it can kind of limit those genesis liabilities. Santi, where do you think we go from here?
00:06:30.834 - 00:07:04.214, Speaker C: Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about this. I don't disagree with what you guys have said. I think from the asset side of the house, I think all that started here was certainly Luna 3 hours blow up, put them in a big hole. And also it sounds like they've been doing the same Djen trade that a lot of funds have, like three arrows have done, which is just doing this recursive leverage to arb out GBTc, right. I mean, they're the largest holder of GBTc. They own like, close to 10% of it. You just assume that they're not going to be able to touch that.
00:07:04.214 - 00:07:27.404, Speaker C: Like there's some appetite in the market. The discount dipped all the way to kind of 50%, 47%, 50%, and then it got bought back. Like Ark stepped in and bought a bunch. But I just find. I just assume that that is not going to be liquid. They're not gonna want to touch it, I think. Because then they would just crush the market.
00:07:27.404 - 00:07:42.920, Speaker C: Yeah. Okay. You have 2300 million of ARR from, you know, the grayscale franchise. But I don't know, historically, like, they've at the peak, like, that was generating close to a billion.
00:07:42.992 - 00:07:43.224, Speaker A: Right.
00:07:43.264 - 00:08:19.104, Speaker C: Because asset prices are down, like a bunch. And so the latest valuation was 10 billion. So, like, on a p basis, it didn't get much. It's kind of like galaxy digital, right? It trades very close to book value. I think this is a better business, I think, just purely because of grayscale. But the question that I have in my mind is, if Barry is who I, you know, from a net worth standpoint, I think you probably, like, cover and inject more capital. The question is, does he really want to do it just, like, let Genesis fall? Like, why have.
00:08:19.104 - 00:08:46.084, Speaker C: Why have we gone this far when he could just have stepped in two weeks ago? I know he's been, like, plugging the hole, but the holes. Can we just also talk about. The whole set of communications has been very bizarre. Like, in a time to market where you don't want to do that. Like, every company in crypto now is just being really cautious with their communication, and it's like, it never ends well when lawyers take over communications, because, you know, shit has really hit the fan. And I'm wondering if that's the case here as well.
00:08:50.044 - 00:09:31.320, Speaker B: There is one suggestion that I have. I don't know if they're taking feedback right now, but I think one way to substantially close the discount would be to commit, not today, but to some point in the future, to winding up the trust, which they could do as the trustee. It's sort of unilateral, and I think if you create just a market signal that at some point, you intend to wind it down, the truss in a year, two or three years, you say there is going to be this event where it will convert it at par to the underlying. I think that closes the discount substantially.
00:09:31.392 - 00:09:35.444, Speaker A: Nick, is that the same overnight? Is that Reg? Mike.
00:09:38.984 - 00:10:30.644, Speaker B: This is just more messaging, I would say. I don't think you even need sec approval to, say, put out a blog post saying, we intend to actually, at some point, eventually wind it down, I believe. Reg M. I think the discussion around that was, could Grayscale, could DCG itself just do a one time redemption of their own 10% of GBDC at par, which I think would be met with allegations of unfairness, because they would just be extricating their own shares and retail wouldn't be able to get out. So this is more just a messaging thing, which I don't know if that's feasible or not, but that's what I do in their shoes.
00:10:31.064 - 00:10:49.484, Speaker C: Yeah, but I struggle to. This is the proposal Celkis was pushing for as well. And even, like Barry, in what scenario would he want to let go of a 200, potentially a billion dollar AR business. It's just the incentives are not there. Right?
00:10:50.024 - 00:11:13.564, Speaker B: I mean, if you expect that there'll be an ETF conversion in say 36 months, you might as well say, okay, well, we're going to lose the bulk of this fee stream anyway, or it'll come down substantially. So you might as well say it's a wash, maybe we'll get that SEC the ETF conversion eventually. So we might as well just commit to this.
00:11:13.644 - 00:11:14.264, Speaker C: But.
00:11:14.964 - 00:11:16.604, Speaker B: Or risk even if you do that.
00:11:16.644 - 00:12:08.294, Speaker C: Though, because my understanding is the plug is roughly 2 billion, right. The mismatch is close to 2 billion. And so if they were to sell all 10% of their stake, assuming they're able to do that gracefully, and maybe they've divest other assets, I struggled to see how they come up in a restructuring scenario. And they've hired Molis, I think, or Genesis has hired Molis, or lazard, I think, to advise on the restructuring. It's difficult to see how they plug this gap without an infusion. And even if they were to try to fire sale some of these assets, it probably wreaks a lot of havoc in the market.
00:12:09.314 - 00:12:30.010, Speaker A: I think if they don't go the reg M option, which I don't think they'll do, there's basically two options, right? Like DCG. Either it comes down to what the. If they can agree to a deal with the Genesis creditors. I think it was Celkis who laid this out. Like option a, DCG negotiates resolution with Genesis creditors. Everyone avoids bankruptcy, DCG survives. It's option a.
00:12:30.010 - 00:12:55.094, Speaker A: Option B is creditors reject the deal, Genesis goes into bankruptcy, years of court battles, likely the same bad result for DCG. So it seems like those are the two options here. And it really comes down to, can they agree to a resolution with Genesis creditors or not? Nick, do you have a sense of where this plays out with? You think DCG is going to be fine here?
00:12:55.754 - 00:13:28.922, Speaker B: I mean, the asset is pretty substantial and I'm not going to say diversified, but they have a bunch of different revenue streams over the entire apparatus. Bury has been historically one of the best entrepreneurs in the space. If there's anyone that can extricate themselves from this, I think it's them. And I do think they have the credibility to raise here. Of course, capital is pretty tight right now and crypto looks toxic. But if I were betting, man, I would say they're able to actually extricate themselves from this.
00:13:28.978 - 00:13:57.034, Speaker C: I wanted to ask you, Nick. So the last federation was at 10 billion. That was like over a year ago. They raised from a few folks. Historically, I think he's row for a lot of the secondary from employees and whatnot. And that is the thing come to light here, where they use some of the capital, like they borrowed some capital from Genesis to buy out other investors in the cap table. I think Barry historically wanted to clean up the cap table and just been very aggressive in buying back shares.
00:13:57.034 - 00:14:14.054, Speaker C: What valuation would you invest, assuming that Barry opens up around for DCG? Now, this is just purely speculative, but is there a price here that you would feel really interested in? Is it 1 billion? Is it 2 billion? Is it five? What's that magic number for you?
00:14:15.394 - 00:14:36.154, Speaker B: Yeah, good question. I mean, my expertise is certainly not investing in distressed financials, but I mean, just based on comparables, I would say what I'm seeing in the market is anywhere from a 40% to 50% discount on those rounds that were done in 2021 is kind of where I'd expect this to trade.
00:14:36.314 - 00:15:11.832, Speaker C: Yeah. Yeah. Because if you were to do some of the parts, like you have coindesk, you have a pretty substantial venture portfolio, illiquid, but there's some value there. If foundry, you could argue, has some value or none, then you have DCG. Sorry, grayscale. And so the real prize here is, I think, grayscale. And then to your point, I think the biggest question is, how long can that stream of cash flow continue? 200, 300, 400, 500.
00:15:11.832 - 00:15:57.774, Speaker C: It's really predictable, other than this binary risk, but you take a discount on that, it's a fairly attractive asset. I do agree with you. I think they'll be able to get the deal done. The only thing that I'm, like, really kind of don't understand is, Barry, for someone that historically has been very aggressive in buying out existing shareholders, has been a very silent. The communication from genesis has been very cryptic, and panel recognition, like, it has all the red flags that other, you know, folks recently have, like, FDX and throughout, like, you know what I mean? Like in Luna, like, the communications there have been very erratic and inconsistent to the point where they, like, kept retracing.
00:15:57.814 - 00:15:58.038, Speaker B: Right.
00:15:58.086 - 00:16:14.662, Speaker C: And so there's not much confidence, I think, that we're operating here without. With obviously imperfect information. But, yeah, it's. It's fairly concerning that he hasn't, at this point, stepped in and just, like, plugged the gap himself, I think.
00:16:14.718 - 00:16:22.104, Speaker A: Do you think it's concern. Do you think it's concerning that grayscale won't share their proof of reserves due to, like, quote, unquote security concerns.
00:16:24.924 - 00:17:06.072, Speaker B: Well, that's really on Coinbase. You know, they custody the funds with Coinbase. I'm not going to speak for Coinbase, but, you know, from what I understand, they've historically resisted doing por due to the view that it leaks too much privacy and it maybe requires them to reconfigure their setup, which is pretty arcane, actually. Coinbase doesn't just have everything in a couple of cold wallets. It's much more complex than that. So that's sort of really in Coinbase is the ball's in their court. And it's just unfortunate that they can't provide the pass through assurance.
00:17:06.072 - 00:17:34.123, Speaker B: But I don't have any doubts whatsoever that they have the funds. I mean, they're an audited public company and they did break out the user deposits on the platform in their last filing. So I consider that as good as a proof of reserve is just the fact that they're a public company and they have their audited financials. So that doesn't give me any concern, really. Yeah, you know, nevertheless, I would say disappointing, especially as everybody else is doing proof reserve now.
00:17:34.983 - 00:17:35.763, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:17:36.663 - 00:18:02.170, Speaker C: Well, Nick, I want to ask you a question. Obviously there's other creditors of Genesis. You don't have to talk about your particular situation, but is that something that you know of, like how flexible and willing are these creditors willing to like just buy more time to play this out? Kind of this multiple scenarios and just because I think a lot of the liabilities were due now.
00:18:02.202 - 00:18:02.370, Speaker A: Right.
00:18:02.402 - 00:18:19.344, Speaker C: As you. As you want, as you got withdrawals and they couldn't match them. So I'm curious if you have had conversations with a lot of the creditors, depositors of Genesis, and what the thinking there is if there's a coordinated action group to figure out a situation.
00:18:19.844 - 00:19:00.934, Speaker B: Yeah, good question. We're not ourselves creditors of Genesis, and that's actually maybe the biggest question mark hanging over this whole thing, is who they are. There's a distinct lack of clarity. I've been trying to determine what that creditor base consists of and it's very hard to find out. I would guess that there's some other Gemini, urn type platforms where you have white label platforms that are giving folks access to those yields via Genesis. But yeah, we've been trying to figure that out ourselves and have had very little luck so far.
00:19:01.914 - 00:19:15.220, Speaker A: I wonder if you could see a situation where Genesis creditors end up just basically rolling their claims into DCG. DCG warrants, basically that. That actually feels like a potential potential situation here.
00:19:15.332 - 00:19:15.532, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:19:15.548 - 00:19:20.484, Speaker C: You have like a senior claim on like the stream of cash from grayscale.
00:19:20.564 - 00:19:20.900, Speaker A: Right.
00:19:20.972 - 00:19:23.784, Speaker C: Seems to me like I'll take. I would take that.
00:19:24.524 - 00:19:28.516, Speaker A: Like, basically refinance the debt into. Into DCG debt. Like.
00:19:28.540 - 00:19:56.610, Speaker C: Like Gemini could probably also cooperate here. They have like 350 to 300. 350, I think is the aggregate of their program, earn program. And so I think they could probably like work something out. If you're a large fund or what have you, you might have redemptions, which is probably tricky. But yeah, this is the biggest question mark and I think I'd love to see more clarity. If anyone has thoughts, please post them.
00:19:56.610 - 00:19:58.414, Speaker C: We can bring you on next week.
00:19:59.914 - 00:20:27.118, Speaker A: Yeah, cool. Anything else on DCG Genesis? Nick, any last thoughts here? No, all good. Cool. All right, Nick, throwing you into the fire for the next one, it feels like it's just like a continued bitcoin miner bloodbath out there. I was trying to decipher some of this data. It seems like the most aggressive miner selling that we've seen since. That I've ever seen.
00:20:27.118 - 00:21:02.954, Speaker A: I think there's probably been a worse time than this, but from the data I was looking at, it seems like the worst or the most aggressive miner selling ever seen. And it just seems like if the prices. It seems like right now, if the prices don't go up, we're going to see a lot of bitcoin miners out of business. I think we've been saying this, though, for months and we haven't seen folks go out of the business. Maybe one of the reasons folks haven't gone out of business yet is because they had access to capital through these lenders. But now that the lenders don't exist or that they've kind of closed up shop for a little bit, maybe that's the straw that breaks the camel's back. What's the state of bitcoin miners today?
00:21:05.934 - 00:21:46.776, Speaker B: Yeah, I was at the Texas blockchain summit this week, which was always well attended by miners, and the atmosphere was pretty grim. I mean, as I said on stage, miners have faced a quadruple whammy. Bitcoin price has fallen. Interest rates have risen, so financing costs are up. Hash rate has risen dramatically, especially with the merge. The merge had an effect on bitcoin hashrate as some mining farms converted into mining, bitcoin and power prices have gone up. Obviously, that basically put the whole mining sector out of business almost.
00:21:46.776 - 00:22:20.734, Speaker B: These miners have been operating unprofitably for the last few months. They've just been mining in order to cover their interest payments for the most part. So they're not making money on every unit of bitcoin that they mine. They're losing money. What you'll see now will be continued consolidation, continued collapse, insolvencies in the mining sector, especially as these minor financing businesses will start repossessing ASICs that they were lending against. That's happening right now. You'll see some more bankruptcies.
00:22:20.734 - 00:22:44.164, Speaker B: Maybe a handful of well capitalized miners will survive, the ones without as much debt. But, yeah, I mean, really disastrous sector. It's kind of been overlooked because of all the other issues we've seen in crypto. But, yeah, one of the toughest corners of crypto right now. Most of those public miners have underperformed bitcoin even this year. So kind of a shocking space for.
00:22:44.284 - 00:23:17.594, Speaker C: Maybe the less or unfamiliar listeners. Can you explain this relationship between hashrate and the adjustment there and the difficulty? Because a lot of times people maybe for an unsuspecting list and say, wait a minute, does this put in jeopardy? Does this risk the security of the bitcoin network? If a lot of these miners go offline and energy prices continue to persist and be high into next year, how does that work? Because I know there's some nuance there that perhaps listeners might appreciate.
00:23:20.554 - 00:24:15.834, Speaker B: Yeah, I would say the hashrate figure is pretty much arbitrary. So I dont think theres a linear relationship between bitcoin hashrate or difficulty, and the security of bitcoin. Really its just a function of the revenue expended on or the revenue that validators can earn, which is a function of the issuance rate, which is fixed and obviously falls every four years, plus fees, which fees are de minimis right now. That's really your measure of security is the cost in, I guess, dollar terms to gain sufficient share of hash rate to interfere with the protocol. Miner economics are exogenous. The miners go out of business and new miners pop up. That's just the normal churn, I guess, for the sake of decentralization.
00:24:15.834 - 00:24:59.944, Speaker B: All of that said, it's still not a great phenomenon that the miners are consolidating right now, because it means there will be fewer miners coming out of this crisis. It'll probably consolidate into few larger miners. You may not like that feature, but overall, what I would expect to see here is hash rates start to come down. I think miners will start to underclock their asics. So to economize on energy costs, they'll run the asics a little slower, basically. And of course, some of these asics will just end up being repossessed. And there'll be some latency before they can be turned back on again.
00:24:59.944 - 00:25:26.576, Speaker B: So I do think hashrate will come down here, but there's no level of hashrate where I consider bitcoin secure or insecure, so to speak. The hashrate figure is kind of arbitrary. What I look at more is what's the aggregate level security spend on the network? So I would worry if like in ten years time fees don't materialize, kind of thing. But I wouldn't say it's insecure now. You know, even if mine has got.
00:25:26.600 - 00:25:56.612, Speaker C: A business on the fee side of things. I mean, there have been some fairly positive developments on the lightning network. I don't know if you want to touch on that in that context, because, I mean, my understanding now is this question comes up over and over, not as fought, but just as the. What's the security budget of bitcoin in perpetuity? And a lot of people say, wait, in perpetuity is a tough question. Like things are going to change a lot. We don't even know it's a problem that can be addressed in 30 years. But it's something that I do think about a lot.
00:25:56.612 - 00:26:19.464, Speaker C: And I think there's others in the bitcoin community, like James Prestwich and others that have introduced this. More of a debate of what happens and how do we. I'm curious if you have a view there, this idea that there's 90% plus of fees are coming from block rewards, and at some point that's going to go away and you need to have more coming from transaction fees.
00:26:22.484 - 00:27:03.186, Speaker B: Yeah, right now it's more like 99% plus. The bitcoin fees are in bitcoin terms at a decade low. So either way, the trend is not positive there. You need fundamentally more on chain utilization to backstop security, especially as the issuance decays to zero. And if we're not seeing that utilization, it will soon be time to sound the alarm, I think. I used to think you could have sufficient fees to support security such that the fees would be the sole part of the security budget. But it's clear the fees are cyclical.
00:27:03.186 - 00:27:34.244, Speaker B: Whether it's bitcoin or ethereum, fees are just generally very cyclical, and they correspond to market cycles and interest and activity. Cyclical fees would mean that in a bear market in the distant future, maybe 1020 years from now, that means your security budget goes to almost zero if the blockchain utilization goes down. So it's not really a sufficient way to backstop security, a fee only regime. So that does concern me, to be honest with you.
00:27:35.704 - 00:27:39.324, Speaker C: Where does that leave you in terms of this desire to hold bitcoin?
00:27:42.824 - 00:28:35.388, Speaker B: I mean, I'm still pretty content with holding bitcoin, especially given this is sort of medium long term problem. I do think there is solutions to that, but it's just that you are only going to be able to galvanize political support when it becomes clear to more folks that there is a problem. Some people really don't like the proposed solutions. One, of course, is reinserting issuance. That's the simple approach. Another one would be recycling old Utxos, maybe decades old Utxos, back into the security budget. Another one would be a de facto solution, which is large exchanges and custodians become like altruistic miners, which basically backdoors the network into a de facto proof of stake.
00:28:35.388 - 00:28:44.986, Speaker B: Network people may not like that. That's actually kind of where I see this going. It's not like a formal switch to proof of stake, but it just sort of happens over time.
00:28:45.180 - 00:29:15.574, Speaker C: Historically, ive thought of you as someone that has been perhaps more in the bitcoin camp and supporting a lot of the infrastructure there. Can you talk a little bit about, I know this is a weekly roundup, but im just very curious of your evolution and thinking in this space. Youve been around for a long time, particularly towards more recent developments. How have recent developments changed your frameworks, your mindset, your thesis, if you will? Im curious how youre processing all of the stuff that's going on recently, and it's a lot.
00:29:18.194 - 00:30:08.412, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, obviously over the summer, the bitcoiners all became very upset with me because it became clear that we invest all over the crypto space, and not just bitcoin, but that's always been the case since we started our firm in 2018. So there's nothing new there. I think the intellectual dynamism in the bitcoin community has decreased. Some bitcoiners have just defected or become more pluralistic in their outlook. And this trend of bitcoin fundamentalism, which is really unhelpful overall. I know a lot of bitcoiners are claiming vindication with the credit crisis because they tend to be averse to credit and with the FTX crisis. But no one really saw FTX coming, to be honest with you.
00:30:08.412 - 00:30:37.472, Speaker B: So I don't see that as a win for bitcoiners. I think it sets back the whole space, bitcoin included. And there are a lot of bitcoin businesses that used FTX as a custodian. So it's not good for bitcoin either. So I don't see, like, the bitcoin community is having experience to win throughout this crisis. It's just an unmitigated bad situation for everyone in crypto. And I don't see it as pushing newcomers towards bitcoin.
00:30:37.472 - 00:31:12.834, Speaker B: It's just going to push people away from crypto if they trusted FTX and their savings evaporated. I'd like to see more debate in the bitcoin space, more openness to new ideas, and maybe more creative ways to insert bitcoin on other blockchains to make it more synergistic with the broader crypto space, such that bitcoin can benefit from interesting new developments that are happening elsewhere, whether that's new models for l one s or interesting l two s, roll ups, et cetera. That's kind of what I'd be pushing for, right.
00:31:12.874 - 00:31:55.472, Speaker C: In many ways, that could potentially also alleviate this fee problem, right. Because if bitcoin becomes a security budget, shared security budget for some of these other blockchains, then perhaps they could share some of the fees of other networks. But you have issues around like wrapped bitcoin and other instances. I mean, at some point, bitcoin, it became a fairly interesting collateral type in Defi and Ethereum. At its peak, I mean, it was like small numbers, like less than 5%, I think. Certainly not where you potentially want it to be. But it was interesting that there were some bitcoiners that started to want to get more utility out of their bitcoin, as opposed to just holding it, but just lending it in a decentralized manner that was in accordance with their ethos.
00:31:55.472 - 00:32:17.082, Speaker C: Because if you're lending it to Genesis, well, that's a problem. If you're lending it to FTX, it's a problem. I think the core values of the bitcoin community are very much decentralization. I was excited, I still am, about what you just said, which is allowing bitcoin to be used in some of these other networks, whether it's security or just to give more consumer preference to.
00:32:17.098 - 00:32:49.348, Speaker B: A bitcoin holder, it's my current priority is a, reforming the exchange space. Proof of reserve is part of that, because I don't think we're going to get away from centralized exchanges anytime soon. And then B, finding ways to allow bitcoin, the collateral type, to be utilized elsewhere, because I do think it has good properties. And the challenge is, are there trustless ways to bridge it over to other chains? Obviously, we saw the failure of a certain kind of wrapped bitcoin around the FTX issue. So that's just, I think the challenge there is, can you do it?
00:32:49.356 - 00:33:27.226, Speaker A: In a way, it always struck me as funny, basically the desire of bitcoiners to get yield on their bitcoin through things like, I won't actually name names, but like, yeah, basically centralized, decentralized lending platforms. I brought up the idea to a group of bitcoiners of basically bridging over to avalanche and getting some yield. You can do like BTCB through the core wallet on avalanche. And it was like this preposterous idea. The idea of bridging over to avalanche was like the most ridiculous thing in the world. But giving your assets to FTX, Voyager, Genesis, Blockfi was like this, totally normal. Yeah, that's a safe thing to do.
00:33:27.226 - 00:33:29.826, Speaker A: So. Yeah, it just struck me as funny.
00:33:29.890 - 00:34:03.244, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it just reinforces the need for actual meaningful DeFi lenders here, whether it's the over collat orthodox deFi approach or the new breed of under collat DeFi lenders, where there's some portions of centralization, but still things are much more transparent than these black box centralized lenders. So there's a path forward here which is just returning to the core values of actual decentralization, decentralized finance. That's the way forward.
00:34:03.284 - 00:34:21.308, Speaker A: Nick, now that we've been running proof of, now that the merge has happened, we've been running proof of stake for a little while now. Do you have thoughts on just. This is a really big question here, I'd say, but just proof of stake versus proof of work and the two, just the two different systems, I guess now that we've seen proof of stake in action for a couple of months.
00:34:21.436 - 00:35:03.704, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I was concerned about the. Not even strictly a proof of stake problem, but like the influence of MeV in terms of possible censor ability. And the trend there for a while was really concerning with the. I consider over compliance not just OFAC compliance, but over compliance as in proactively filtering out transactions. Obviously it never reached saturation on ethereum, so it wasn't like transactions were never included. But the trend was worrisome there. I think just in the last couple of days we've seen a real commitment from the flashbots side of the house to reversing that.
00:35:03.704 - 00:35:44.666, Speaker B: So I have seen a reaction in the ethereum community which was encouraging, which is really pushing back at that trend. But that's my main concern, or worry about proof of stake is that it does vest a lot of power in the exchanges. Custodians the larger institutions that end up being intermediaries in that system. I think the jury's still out. I want to see how proof of work reacts to a similar challenge. I think Mev will emerge even in bitcoin, especially if it gets more expressive. I would like to see how bitcoin would react to that.
00:35:44.666 - 00:36:04.674, Speaker B: That might be sometime in the future. But, yeah, that's my main thing is one, is MeV tends to be a centralizing force, and then two, under proof of stake. Are you vesting too much power in the intermediaries? We've learned, obviously in the last few months here that the intermediaries are kind of not to be trusted.
00:36:05.974 - 00:36:31.614, Speaker C: How are you positioned as an institutional investor in the space, given everything that's going on? Curious. Maybe you do this, maybe you don't, but at the beginning of the year, going into the year, we were coming off the high, and now where we are now, I'm curious how you think about the current landscape and where you see the most amount of opportunities.
00:36:31.954 - 00:36:55.974, Speaker B: Yeah, we're just still doing the same thing that we always do. We don't really try and pick market cycles. We don't really trade a liquid book. It's really just deploying progressively into startups. We do ease off the gas when we see valuations getting extreme, and then we put our foot on the accelerator. So we try and be countercyclical. We put our foot on the accelerator in a time like this.
00:36:55.974 - 00:37:22.584, Speaker B: Overall, the strategy is pretty much unchanged, I would say for us right now, big focus on DeFi. I think DeFi is really distressed. It's really out of favor. Overall. People are really questioning it. I like that space right now. In particular, I like the new breed of lenders that are trying to rebuild crypto credit from scratch in a more trusted way, in a more accountable way.
00:37:22.584 - 00:37:52.870, Speaker B: Then we're looking a lot of tools to promote crypto dollarization, safe and responsible wallet, non custodial wallet usage, especially as these currency crises occur. The same strategy as ever for us. And now valuations start to look more reasonable, founder expectations more reasonable. We're glad that we have a lot of dry powder to deploy here.
00:37:52.982 - 00:37:55.274, Speaker C: Do you think that crypto has a UX problem?
00:37:56.854 - 00:38:55.124, Speaker B: I don't know if I characterize it as UX problem. It's sort of like an inherent issue is that we're talking about digital bear assets. If you want someone to really own these things, they have to be comfortable with the OPSEC challenges of holding information which is tied to value. And I don't know if I want that to be solved with slick uis or anything, I think we need to develop better tools such as regular users, unsophisticated users can safely transact. I think a lot of that involves MPC, more sophisticated schemes that look like web two authentication schemes, um, you know, better wallet recovery, such that you're not just writing down 24 words on a piece of paper. I don't think this ever goes mainstream if we're writing down, you know, seed phrases on paper. So, yeah, I am really optimistic about what I'm seeing right now.
00:38:55.164 - 00:39:45.192, Speaker C: I mean, you kind of had like solutions like social recovery, argent and what have you, which I thought would have gained way more traction by now. But, you know, I think these things take time. You're some that is close to traditional institutional players, like fidelities of the world. I think you have a strong voice in the space. And I'm curious what you're hearing out there in terms of how much of the current development slowed down institutional adoption. And this is something that we talk about over the years. And do you a believe that institutional adoption, how you characterize it as the importance of it? And two, like, how much of the current developments, like what is going through the minds of fidelity, Schwab, JP Morgan now that given everything that's going on.
00:39:45.368 - 00:40:21.216, Speaker B: I mean, the FTX crisis might change some things because it has shaken confidence in the industry. So we'll see. But aside from that, I would say this year overall has been positive institutionally. Fidelity finally went live with their retail crypto product. After sitting on that for years and years, BlackRock has finally begun to actually dive into the space. You're seeing custodians like BNY Mellon finally make a play. And the major investment banks, I would say, have also shown a resurgence of interest.
00:40:21.216 - 00:40:47.646, Speaker B: So those kinds of institutions, the kind of asset managers, I think they finally actually made their way into crypto. The institutions that might step back would be like the allocators, pension funds, endowments, large pools of private equity maybe, that were allocated in crypto directly or through venture funds. Yeah. So I think institutional allocators might take.
00:40:47.670 - 00:41:27.274, Speaker C: A breather for sure on this point, macro aside. But if and when allocators are more risk on and they come to crypto, what do you think the allocation looks like in terms of, historically, it's been very centric and weighted towards bitcoin, whereas some allocators have expressly not touched anything other than bitcoin. Maybe it's because of a number of reasons, regulation being one of them. But how do you see that ratio and dynamic in the next cycle, or when I say the next cycle is when allocators are on a risk on mode and come back to allocate to the asset class.
00:41:27.434 - 00:42:19.254, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, for the first time, for these non crypto, larger allocators, I'm seeing more of a preference for ethereum as their first foray into the crypto space, into spot exposure. I think bitcoin still has a role to play. And then I think the l one, the new l one trade, that's a little bit played out. I don't know if people necessarily trust those after we saw what happened to Terra and Solana to a certain degree. I don't know if there's going to be faith in the emergence of these new l one s and this constant l one churn anymore. So I think it's going to be more of a function of what's robust, what has meaningful security and staying power and liquidity in developers and applications. And I think it's just going to be a preference towards just the more developed, larger established chains.
00:42:19.674 - 00:42:53.434, Speaker C: I guess the last question for me is on this point, there's a lot of discussion around the future of Solana. We're going to have an episode next week or in the coming weeks with Anatoly and Ben, who runs BD there. What has been your observation? How have you been involved or not in the Solana ecosystem? Certainly FTX and Sam played a big role from a BD standpoint of putting it on the map of institutions and the DeFi ecosystem there. What do you think is the future of Solana, and is that an ecosystem that you're looking at have been investing in?
00:42:56.494 - 00:43:48.806, Speaker B: Yeah, we've allocated to the Solana space for sure. That's probably the third ecosystem for us. I think the FTX influence was meaningful, but if anything, jump crypto is more the steward of that ecosystem. I do perceive that it has exit velocity in its own right. I think they can survive the loss of confidence here. It's obviously painful in terms of the very rapid liquidation of the Solana held by Alameda FTX, etcetera. But in terms of sort of like the grassroots enthusiasm for Solana dev and applications, and like their own little defi ecosystem, I definitely see that as sticking around, no question about it.
00:43:48.910 - 00:45:12.398, Speaker C: Yeah, maybe as a casual observer that comes into the space, we're talking about Solana, and sometimes we over intellectualize things. As it stands, Solana is on a circulating basis, like the 17th largest network. But ahead of that, you have stuff like Shiba Inu, you have Polkadot, you have Dogecoin, Cardano, Ripple. These are some of the names that if you were asked me like two years ago I would have said I think we would have come farther in the market cap tables where you would have seen networks that are seeing much more applications and developers move up the ranks but somehow, somehow mean power. Hustane power and legacy networks that have kind of failed to really shape much have continued to hold their ground. Like do you see that as like a bit demoralizing? And this goes to the heart of the question that I think a lot of us ask ourselves in current market environment, which is like where are we going as an industry? Like, and, and this is just sort of like a 24/7 stock market. People like to speculate and has meme entertainment value and maybe that's okay and we should be more transparent and like honest about that.
00:45:12.566 - 00:45:19.566, Speaker A: I'm curious, like as you're saying, you're saying you don't like the fact that Litecoin is a, has a higher market cap than Solana right now?
00:45:19.670 - 00:46:12.534, Speaker C: Like Litecoin's ripping now because of the happening next year or something. Like I'm just saying, like it sometimes can be a bit frustrating to see that for some folks. Like if you're a network that is like all of DeFi has super powerful properties that I think are not fully understood. But it's been in a bear market for the last two years and I understand this recursive leverage has gone away and yield farming is not a thing anymore, but it has real value and some core use cases. Yet collectively what, I don't know, Ripple is probably worth more than 80% of DeFi which pretends to be the app of the future for DeFi. Cardano. Cardano and Ripple combined and litecoin probably are worth more than all of DeFi.
00:46:12.534 - 00:46:25.254, Speaker C: I just look at that and I get excited because I think that's the arb that you believe in today that others will believe in over time. But man, it's just been taking a while to rinse off a lot of the crap that continues, continues to exist.
00:46:25.634 - 00:47:37.406, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean as an allocator I think that works to our advantage really if we see something that the market doesn't right. And so I don't worry too much about the relative valuation against the more like retail focused coins which are solely, their valuation is solely derived from their founders ability to attract new retail investors or anything. For me it's just a question of can these all ones define serious accretion mechanics. I would say that's the big win of Ethereum, is they were able to create this actual meaningful narrative as to why the coin should have value and build those into the protocol directly. The question is, can the other l one s do that? If you have a vibrant defi ecosystem, I think your prospects are a lot better, but we still need to work out a good theory of valuation here. So that's kind of the challenge I would put in Solana's core, is can you take advantage of the momentum and traction you have and actually convert that into enduring value?
00:47:37.590 - 00:47:56.408, Speaker C: This will be my last question, I promise. Which is how do you think about what were some of the, perhaps it could be a company or a thesis that you had, you know, call it two years ago, the beginning of the bull that has taken longer, that you.
00:47:56.416 - 00:47:57.472, Speaker B: Would have thought would like, be a.
00:47:57.488 - 00:48:03.124, Speaker C: Killer use case or would materialize, gain much more traction than it hasn't today?
00:48:06.784 - 00:49:12.144, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it's funny, when we looked at the early FTX rounds and we didn't do it, actually, I'm not going to beat my chest or anything, but basically we thought starting a new offshore exchange was too sketchy and too difficult. From 2018 onwards, we did the Air Sacs deal, which was a bet on onshore highly regulated crypto exchanges. And for a long time, that looked like totally the wrong call. I don't know if it was or wasn't, but that was our bet is we were betting on the regulated crypto onshore market outcompeting the offshore market for a while that went the other way. Now, I think you could make the case that there will be this meaningful distinction between the onshore lit market and the offshore market. So that was one where we beat ourselves up over it for a long time. But I think probably now it's the case that it's going to be really hard to build a new offshore exchange post FTX collapse.
00:49:12.144 - 00:49:32.316, Speaker B: I would say that's the thesis that I always thought would play out, would be the crypto industry would just become more accountable, more surveilled, not in the bad way, but just more meaningfully incorporated with the domestic financial industry. I think maybe, hopefully that's the path forward.
00:49:32.380 - 00:49:44.944, Speaker C: Do you think that given recent events, compress the timeline to get more regulatory clarity, which has been kind of non existent in the space for a long time?
00:49:47.684 - 00:50:04.864, Speaker B: Yeah, undoubtedly. But it's on us to advocate for ourselves in Washington, make sure that the clarity is actually helpful to the industry and helps for consumer protection, things like that, as opposed to just being super burdensome and forcing the industry out of the US further.
00:50:04.984 - 00:50:29.626, Speaker A: Nick, I want to wrap by just talking about proof of reserves for a second. You had this line, I think you said it on Twitter. You said, if there's a single thing I could do better, I think that this industry could do better, it would be to convince every custodial service provider in the space to adopt a routine proof of reserve program. Can you just explain your rationale behind that? I remember you writing about proof of reserves back in 2019 or 2018, so I'd love to just hear your expand on that.
00:50:29.720 - 00:50:29.974, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:50:30.014 - 00:51:04.492, Speaker B: And the real benefit. And so when I talk about proof reserves, I am referring to both sides. So I'm talking about proving your ownership of crypto assets plus liabilities. I think it's incomplete without the liabilities. And most people note that maybe we need to rebrand it to porl proof of reserves and liabilities because there's a lot of confusion or solvency. Solvency is also hard, though, because that requires a full audit of all the possible liabilities. There may be additional encumbrances, but yeah, I mean, I think proof reserves really shines when you don't have strong legal assurances.
00:51:04.492 - 00:51:56.494, Speaker B: Like with Coinbase, for instance, we can kind of know, based on their audits, the fact that they're publicly traded, they have a big four auditor, Deloitte. So we kind of know that what they're saying is legit, even if they're not doing in a cryptographic way. Proof of reserves shines where you don't have those legal assurances, where you would prefer a cryptographic attestation over nothing. I think it's really relevant for the offshore exchanges, of which there are still many. Encouragingly, we just saw ok coin release approved reserve at a station today, including the liabilities. They'd be a prime example. I would say Binance is also in this camp, the prime example of a firm where the end users gain a ton of confidence in their solvency.
00:51:56.494 - 00:52:27.210, Speaker B: If they can carry out this attestation, especially if theyre not ever going to be a US publicly traded company or anything like that. For all of those offshore ones, I think they really dont have a choice. They probably have to do this now. For the onshore ones, I would say its less urgent. Im really excited. Ive heard that theres, you know, at least two dozen exchanges that are looking at doing a proof reserve now. I think that does go a long way towards winning back confidence, especially as it's been shattered by the FTA.
00:52:27.242 - 00:52:39.054, Speaker A: For this to work do you need use, do you need both users to verify their individual balances in some way? Like this herd immunity and a third party auditor? Or like, what is the mechanism by that? Like how that works?
00:52:41.274 - 00:53:15.842, Speaker B: There's a bunch of different schemes. So BitMex and OK coin, those were users could verify them, but they didn't bring in a third party auditor. For Kraken, they did bring in a third party auditor, but just to make sure that the liability extraction was complete. But yeah, in theory, if you're doing the procedure right, you don't actually need an auditor. But, you know, if you were up to me, if I were defining like an ideal proof of reserve, it certainly would include an auditor just to make sure that you're not playing any games with the liability side, you know, I.
00:53:15.858 - 00:53:43.926, Speaker C: Guess on this point, do you think, I mean, you had like Enron, like, you have Arthur Andersen, like, I think, like to me it's a bit shocking how much, I guess, without introducing my bias, I guess, how much do you buy this by do, by having this at the station? It's like a security concern. Seems to be like the excuse of why they're not doing um, this attestation. Like, to me that is a bit of bullshit, but I'm curious to hear your opinion.
00:53:44.070 - 00:54:41.314, Speaker B: I mean, I do totally acknowledge that the current merkelized way exchanges do. The liability side leaks some information, not necessarily personal identification information, not PII, but it does leak info as to the relative ownership and the different kind of assets people have, and then the change over time. If you're doing on an ongoing basis, if you're releasing a huge data set of 100 million entries, there will be some ability to do some forensic accounting and find interesting info on that. I'm bullish on ZK proofs for liabilities. Vitalik had a good post on it recently. There have been papers on it. I think that should be the path forward in terms of the does it trade off against existing custodial setups? I think that's true.
00:54:41.314 - 00:55:09.184, Speaker B: It's just that we're in this transitional phase. People didn't configure their custody such that they'd be able to easily export the liabilities and the assets. It may well be the case that they feel that there's an issue or possibly a slight risk with signing transactions frequently and things like that. I get that, but I think exchanges are just going to have to reconfigure their backend such that they could more easily do these procedures in the future.
00:55:09.804 - 00:55:39.144, Speaker A: Just feels like we're doing all these workaround solutions for these centralized exchanges when we have the solution with decentralized exchanges. I think it was Vitalik in his post at the end, in the conclusion, he's like, I could see a world where we basically end up having Dexs and then centralized exchanges that are half custodial where maybe we trust them with our fiat but with their, but then the crypto is held in the smart contract or something. Feels like a good solution.
00:55:40.044 - 00:56:06.084, Speaker C: Yeah, I do sort of agree with Nick, though. I think that we should just assume and build with the assumption that centralized exchanges are always going to play a role in this industry for on ramp, off ramp KYC AmL a number of reasons. And so I think we should just hold them to the same standard that we know and can with the tools that we have. You know, there should be no excuse for any exchange not to have proof of reserves and liability.
00:56:09.464 - 00:56:20.864, Speaker B: And it's not that hard or costly to do, to be honest. So it's a small thing and it does win a lot of user trust. So not a lot of downside, a lot of upside.
00:56:21.024 - 00:56:46.314, Speaker A: I want to wrap with one question here, Nick, which is first, I want to give a plug to your podcast, because on the brink is folks don't listen to on the brink. People should listen to it. But you and Matt tend to agree on most things. But sometimes I hear in your guys voice that maybe you're disagreeing on something. So I wanted to just ask it as a question, which is, what's the big thing that you and Matt disagree on these days as you think about investing in this bear market?
00:56:49.014 - 00:57:23.014, Speaker B: Yeah, good question. I mean, we have plenty of time, that's for sure. But I won't surface those here. I would say probably disagreements in terms of the relative pace we should be going. So do we think things are fairly valued now or should we sort of wait longer to have founder expectations come back to reality, which l one we should be spending more time on. But yeah, you're right. We agree on a lot.
00:57:23.014 - 00:57:39.256, Speaker B: Matt's of focus tends to be more on the sort of intersection of traditional finance and crypto, and mine tends to be more sort of on pure crypto, I would say. But yeah, that's why we've been able to stay in business together for four years. I guess the disagreements aren't too.
00:57:39.320 - 00:57:49.524, Speaker A: No, and disagreements are good. Mike and I just disagree all the time. Who wants to go faster right now? What's the. You want to be allocating? He doesn't want to be allocating. What's the disagreement.
00:57:52.044 - 00:58:10.824, Speaker B: I would say, yeah. I'm generally on the side of taking on more risk, and right now, I see a ton of opportunity in the market, both liquid crypto and venture capital private equity. So it reminds me of 2018, which was an incredible time to deploy. Nice. Cool, man.
00:58:11.164 - 00:58:14.476, Speaker A: We're rooting for you. Any last thoughts here before we wrap?
00:58:14.620 - 00:58:34.358, Speaker B: No. I mean, I will be writing more in proof of reserves. Stay tuned. I know there's a ton of new attestations coming out. It's not a panacea. I do want to combine it with other legal assurances. So segregating client assets from operating capital, maintaining the seniority of depositors in the liquidation situation.
00:58:34.358 - 00:58:43.830, Speaker B: So it alone isn't sufficient. It's kind of part of a payload of things, but, yeah. Stay tuned on the proof of reserve front. Lots of exciting stuff happening there.
00:58:44.022 - 00:58:53.314, Speaker A: Cool. Nick, thanks for joining us, man. Hope you have good Thanksgiving. Hope you have. Enjoy the bird clock that's chirping in the background, and we'll talk to you soon.
00:58:53.474 - 00:58:55.450, Speaker B: Thanks for your time, guys. Good chatting.
00:58:55.522 - 00:58:57.594, Speaker C: Thanks so much for coming on, Nick. Happy Thanksgiving, everyone.
