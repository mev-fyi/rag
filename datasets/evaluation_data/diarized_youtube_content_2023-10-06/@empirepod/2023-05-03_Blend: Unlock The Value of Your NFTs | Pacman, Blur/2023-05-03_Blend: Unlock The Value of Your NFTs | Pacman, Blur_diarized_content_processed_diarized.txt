00:00:02.880 - 00:00:26.234, Speaker A: Welcome, everybody, to another great segment here. We got a repeat guest, Mister Pac man, founder of Blur, which it's been less than 24 hours, and we're recording on Tuesday, May 2, when they've launched blend. So, Pac man, great to have you on the show again. Why don't you tell us a little bit about blend and we get started from there?
00:00:26.924 - 00:00:37.464, Speaker B: Yeah, totally. Thanks for having me on again. And one short sentence. Blend is a peer to peer perpetual NFT lending protocol.
00:00:40.124 - 00:00:43.304, Speaker A: Okay, we're going to have to unpack that for normal listeners.
00:00:43.844 - 00:01:16.520, Speaker B: Yeah, totally. I think maybe talking about what blend enables on blur, because we integrated it into the blur marketplace, is probably the most useful context. So basically, with this new lending protocol that we collaborated with Dan Robinson and transmissions eleven, primarily at paradigm with. With this new protocol, we launched two new products on Blur yesterday. One was borrowing. Right, you can borrow against your nfts on blur. That's a fairly standard feature to launch with the landing protocol.
00:01:16.520 - 00:02:01.760, Speaker B: And the next one was buy now, pay later, where basically using blend to provide liquidity, you can actually buy an NFT with a small portion of the capital upfront and then pay the remainder later. So, for example, let's say there's an NFT that costs like ten ETH. You could provide one ETH of your own collateral and then borrow nine ETH to make the purchase, which is a huge unlock, because now people can buy very expensive nfts with much less capital upfront. And so those are the two features that lend enables. And then with that context in mind, maybe then I can talk about what exactly a peer to peer perpetual NFT vendor means.
00:02:01.912 - 00:02:03.124, Speaker A: Yeah, why don't we go there?
00:02:03.624 - 00:02:28.900, Speaker B: Awesome. Yeah. So the first aspect is peer to peer. So that's pretty straightforward. In blend, all loans are peer to peer. There's no, you know, people who've come from defi are probably familiar with more peer to pool protocols, like Aave or compound, you know, where people just dump assets into the pool and then the pool itself handles the, like, loan offers per se. Right.
00:02:28.900 - 00:03:09.024, Speaker B: You can like, borrow at like fixed ltvs, like 60% LTV or whatever against your ETH. Basically the protocol in that case is handling the risk, or everyone accepts the same risk parameters is probably another way of thinking about it. Whereas in a peer to peer model, you basically have each lender define their own risk parameters. So maybe let's say there's a ten ETH collection. One lender wants to lend five ETH at one interest rate, like 50% LTV at a certain interest rate. Another lender can offer 80% LTV, most likely at a higher interest rate, because now they're taking on more risk. So that's what I mean by peer to peer.
00:03:09.024 - 00:04:05.270, Speaker B: And when I said perpetual. So this is more similar to how people who are familiar with defi, like compound and AaVE, will be familiar with lending, which is when you take a loan on AavE, that position is perpetual until you get liquidated. And in blend, your position is perpetual until the position is liquidated or repaid as well. The twist is that normally this is only done in a peer to pool fashion. For peer to peer protocols, especially in nfts, historically, the protocols would have a fixed duration, so it wasn't a perpetual loan. You couldnt just wait forever to pay back your loan. You would actually have to set a duration, 14 days, 30 days, one day, et cetera.
00:04:05.270 - 00:04:32.575, Speaker B: It was typically on average 30 days, and you would have to basically pay back your loan at the 30 day mark or within that 30 day period. Or if you forgot, you would lose your NFT. Blend is a combination of both has some of the peer to pool dynamics, but then it also has the peer to peer dynamics in that instead of the pool choosing the risk parameters, it allows lenders to choose the full rant risk parameters that they're comfortable with.
00:04:32.759 - 00:04:45.239, Speaker A: So let's walk through an example. Say you have a crypto punk and the floor is, I don't know, 80 ETH. So walk us through kind of the flow. If you have a punk and you want to use blend, how does that work?
00:04:45.431 - 00:05:32.058, Speaker B: Yeah, first, basically the lenders have to start making offers on punks. Since punks are that OGP chip collection, it's probably one of the most safest collections to lend against, at least in terms of what the market would consider. And so maybe what you'd see is a lender can make a six CE offer. I think actually punks are, let me just check right now. I think punks like the floor right now is there's probably something along the lines of like six ETH. So maybe it's six ETH. Someone makes like a 50 ETH loan offer, and then if you own a punk, you can basically borrow 50 ETH against that punk.
00:05:32.058 - 00:05:52.514, Speaker B: And now let's say it was like a 50 ETH loan offer at like a 20% apY. That means that once you start borrowing that 50 ETH, your interest will accrue at a rate of 20% per year. So after a year, if you held that position for a year, your total debt that you would owe would increase from 50 e to 60 e.
00:05:57.414 - 00:06:06.668, Speaker A: And in this case, you need obviously have someone else on the other side willing to supply. Yeah. So if you could talk a little bit about that dynamic as well.
00:06:06.806 - 00:06:50.900, Speaker B: Yeah, totally. So the interesting thing about NFT finance is prior to blur, and since launching blend, Blur became the largest NFT lending protocol by volume and also by user share within 24 hours. But basically prior to blend launch, the typical APY that you could earn and the NFT finance space was around like 20% to 30%, which is, and that's on ETH, which is much higher than the yield that you normally get in DeFi. Right. I think the median yield for like liquid staking or like DeFi protocols is typically around like four to 6% APY, unless you do some like leverage thing.
00:06:51.092 - 00:06:51.864, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:06:52.364 - 00:07:30.124, Speaker B: So the, the yield is much higher. And this is kind of more so due, it is not necessarily inherently due to the NFT as an asset, but it's probably more so due to the space who the borrowers are, the risk tolerances of the borrowers, and also the lack of market efficiency in the space. But basically the natural yield for lenders is already quite high. And so lenders would provide these loans because they can, based on their risk tolerances, they can earn a nice yield on their ETH that's much higher than they can get entry to show defi.
00:07:30.744 - 00:08:43.874, Speaker A: Yeah, and by that, let's unpack that a little. In the case of, if you're borrowing some ETH, basically in the event of a liquidation or automatic refinancing, which my understanding is, can be triggered by either the lender or the borrower, then you need to be, you need to believe that theres ample liquidity in there to either liquidate the NFT that you get, as you basically get, if the borrower defaults, the lenders going to have to take possession of that NFT and probably want to liquidate that to get back his ETH. Correct me here if Im wrong, but weve seen obviously the floor of these nfts. Even the larger collections that were seeing here in blur. You were talking about punks, milady's, Azuki's, maybe apes down the road. These are fairly liquid markets, but still the floor has been fairly volatile. Some people out there say, hey, listen, there's sort of this financialization of nfts has created sort of these wild swings in the floor prices of these nfts, even though you've seen an increase in liquidity.
00:08:43.874 - 00:08:53.180, Speaker A: So maybe walk us through kind of this example where there is a refinancing, there's a default. What happens there?
00:08:53.372 - 00:09:43.964, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. Another thing to note about blend is in addition to being peer to peer perpetual protocol, an unspoken aspect of it is that it's actually oracle less. So. Most DEFI lending protocols rely on an oracle, and almost every exploit that happens for a DEFi lending protocol is typically some sort of oracle exploit. Someone pumps up the price of some illiquid asset and then they use that to basically drain the liquidity pool of the lending protocol. The interesting thing about blend is that due to the peer to peer nature, it doesn't rely on oracles at all. And instead the lenders themselves can trigger a liquidation.
00:09:43.964 - 00:10:27.852, Speaker B: Basically it's not actually like a liquidation, it's actually more of a refinancing auction. The lenders themselves can trigger a refinancing auction at any time. And you might think, oh, like at any time, isn't that really risky for the borrower? But in practice, what this means is that the auction, since it takes 30 hours, so the entire duration of the auction is 30 hours, what that auction does is it basically attempts to find another lender at a market interest rate when the current lender doesn't want to hold onto the loan anymore. Right. So this is, you know, they basically have this like loan position, they're earning some sort of yield on it and they, they want their liquidity back. Jump in gear.
00:10:27.988 - 00:11:02.870, Speaker C: Yeah, I was just going to say compared to like peer to pool on a peer to peer, one of the big things is going to, I would think it slightly fractures liquidity in a sense because its not just a pool with standard LTV, standard rates, youre going to have these different nuanced offers. So im curious one, just who are these lenders and how do you incentivize that market? Because when youre talking about this liquidation and auction, I would think the risk to the borrower is that no other lender steps in during that auction. So you need to be basically youre not manipulating an oracle here, but you need to make sure that its not manipulation going on with the lenders that could step in.
00:11:02.902 - 00:11:51.668, Speaker B: Great question. A key assumption of the protocol is that there's a liquid enough lending market here that when an auction happens that the auction can find another lender at the market rate. Right. So for example, even with punks, even with all the volatility, right, and this is through like Luna collapsing, FTX crashing, like all of our liquidity providers, like exiting the system, um, you know, the big sources of institutional liquidity, exiting system, like even with all of that volatility and, and even like in this like macro market, the prices of punks have typically held around like 50 ETH. Uh, you know, 40 50. I think the minimum is probably around like 40 ETH or something like that. But you know, 50 ETH is like a pretty stable point.
00:11:51.668 - 00:12:33.660, Speaker B: And so let's say I take a 50% ltv loan, right? If I take a loan for 25 ETH, if, if I was a lender and there was no other lender. So they just consider like the most extreme example because I think that's probably the most useful to understand the system. If I was the only lender and then I trigger an auction, and then no one refinances it in the 30 hours period. So then at the end of the refinancing, if no other lender steps in and the borrower doesn't repay, then the loan defaults and the lender keeps. NFT. If I as a lender get that NFT for 25 e, I just got a steal because I can go and sell that. You can go and sell that into a blur bid right now for, for over 50 ETH.
00:12:33.660 - 00:13:13.448, Speaker B: So, you know, you just made 25 b for free after a 30 hours delay. So in that sort of market environment, if, if the market is inefficient, then, yeah, lenders can make like a profit like that. But we know that ETH will chase yield, right? Liquidity will chase yield. And if that dynamic is happening, then it shouldn't happen for very long because anyone with 25 ETH will see, oh, wow, like this person's about to make 100% APY on their 25 ETH alone. I would rather step in and make a lower, maybe I can make 50% APY a 50% return, but I'd rather step in and make that return than just like let someone make free money like that.
00:13:13.576 - 00:13:20.304, Speaker A: So, well, in that case, the APY is way greater than 100, right? Because that just happened in like almost instantaneously.
00:13:20.344 - 00:13:22.032, Speaker B: Right? You're right. It's actually way, way better.
00:13:22.208 - 00:13:31.576, Speaker A: So there is this range in this dodge auction from zero to 1000 APY. Walk us through kind of the intuition around that level and setting those parameters.
00:13:31.720 - 00:14:23.184, Speaker B: Yeah. So the auction, when it gets, goes into the refinancing auction, basically it'll go, okay, this is a loan for 25 E. Does anyone want to take it starts at a 0% interest rate and then at the end of the 30 hours it reaches 1000% interest rate. And so basically this means that at the beginning, maybe no one's willing to lend at 0% APY, that would make sense. But by the end of it, if you're able to earn 1000% APY on your ETH, that's a pretty good deal, especially on punks where the floor is held pretty much around 50 ETH, even through pretty crazy financial collapses, and you're risking 25 ethanol LTB. So those are pretty good risk parameters. So basically it attempts to find the market rate for the loan.
00:14:23.184 - 00:14:47.584, Speaker B: It basically goes to the market and tries to find someone to step in at the market rate. It's kind of similar to how a lot of liquidation auctions will work. Like maybe in Nickerdao or in compound, I think in Aave. I think it works something similarly where it's like when the liquidation actually occurs, an auction is initiated to try to find another lender to step in, and they should step in as long as there's money to be made.
00:14:49.284 - 00:15:25.804, Speaker A: Yeah. In this example, on the borrower side, they could say that they borrowed, I don't know, 25 ETH or so. They need to either in an extreme channel, the choices that they have is to repay or lose this NFT. Right. They could, you know, basically what I'm trying to assess is the NFT is held in, you know, in this collateral. I mean, you're basically holding this in a smart contract. Right.
00:15:25.804 - 00:15:36.208, Speaker A: What I'm trying to say is the, you can have like a flash loan of sorts so that the borrower, like, can borrow some e, like liquidate that NFT, do some weird kind of.
00:15:36.296 - 00:16:53.584, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, great. So in terms of, for the borrower and also, you know, I think, I think it probably is useful to just stay on the lending topic for a bit, because trying to build up the intuition for the protocol from the ground up, you know, basically what we just discussed is, okay, if the market is efficient, then another lender should come in. The only reason why another lender wouldn't come in is if the market isn't efficient. So it's like, okay, like, how do you make this an efficient market? One of the nice things is that blur, as the largest marketplace by volume on Ethereum, has a lot of attention, so anything that we release is going to get attention on it. The other nice thing is that in addition to just the natural yield that you get and the national market forces, blur to a certain extent subsidizes that attention with the lending points. So with the integration of blend into the blur marketplace, we also redirected the listing points, which for those unfamiliar, the point system that we have, it's basically credit towards season two, which is our second airdrop, where 300 million plus blur will be distributed in season two. So basically we are utilizing the lending incentives to effectively ensure that we have an efficient market.
00:16:54.724 - 00:17:16.644, Speaker C: Yeah, I think one interesting thing about that right now is when you look at the dune dashboard, it looks like there's some loans at 0% interest, and I would assume that's more of a short term thing. That's part of these incentives. And with that though, I think the average APY on these different NFT sets are around 100%. I'm just curious, where do you think those APIs will end up and why is it so high at the moment?
00:17:16.804 - 00:18:05.440, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. I still need to dig into some of the data. I think some of the doom dashboards are still being worked on, so need to confirm the accuracy of it, the high level metrics in terms of the total loan volume. So in the past 24 hours, around 9000 ETH worth of loan volume has been done, which I think is like 15 x, the previously largest NFT lending protocol. But in terms of AP wise, I need to double check that in terms of where does the 0% APY come from. Of course that only works because the interest rates, the lower interest rates are being subsidized by blur incentives. And I think a good intuition for this is if you actually study the web two by now pay later market.
00:18:05.440 - 00:18:45.364, Speaker B: So like Afterpay or like Arnon, actually, a lot of times in your purchases, you can actually make a purchase with 0% APY. So if you like buy like an iPhone and you're like, okay, I want to go on a payment plan over 24 months. They actually will let you do that payment plan with a 0% interest rate. The reason why that's possible is because the buy now, pay later functionality is so useful for the merchant that the merchants will actually subsidize that 0% interest rate. So in web two, you actually already have this 0% interest phenomenon. It's subsidized by the merchant. In this case, in web three, when we integrated buy now, pay later into blur, you can think of it as the blur protocol.
00:18:45.364 - 00:18:52.692, Speaker B: Incentives are subsidizing that 0% interest rate phenomenon, just like it happens in web two where the merchant is subsidizing it.
00:18:52.828 - 00:19:10.004, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that's really cool. I was actually listening to acquired yesterday on Peloton. I was talking, I think it's klarma that did buy now, pay later for peloton. And when they went public, it showed that 25% of their revenue was from peloton. I want to buy now, pay later. So it was absolutely huge for them just because of the LTV, for the peloton customers. So high.
00:19:11.344 - 00:19:11.696, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:19:11.720 - 00:19:38.736, Speaker C: No, that's really interesting about the 0% interest rates. Right now, I'm curious, just like who do you think are the main borrowers here? And I know it's a perpetual loan, but at least how I think about it, at a high level, it's like you really have 30 hours where it's fixed because that's what, you know, the rate's going to be before it could go into auction. So do you think this tends to be, at least right now, like more of a, for flippers that might, you know, buy an NFT and flip it within 24 hours? And where do you think that will change from where it is today on who those borrowers are?
00:19:38.840 - 00:21:00.974, Speaker B: Yeah, totally. I think for the longer durations we'll have to see exactly how the market dynamics play out, but in terms of how the auction mechanism works. So when a lender triggers the auction, it'll actually attempt to basically match the loan with an existing within, with another loan offer on the order book. So for example, if I created a 25 b loan at a 10% interest rate, and there's another loan offer on the book for 25 b at 10% interest rate, that won't, if I go, if I'm the lender and I trigger the auction, it doesn't actually go into auction, it'll just automatically refinance a loan with that offer on the order book. So depending on how, like the offers on the order book, when the lender triggers the refinancing, it might actually not even go into auction. The only reason why it would go into auction is that if there are no loan offers at the same LTV, or at least that LTV, and at that interest rate, the reason why there wouldn't be another loan offer at that interest rate is maybe the market conditions changed. So maybe I created a loan offer at 25 e when the floor was 55 e, but now the floor actually fell in like 30 hours.
00:21:00.974 - 00:21:44.388, Speaker B: Since the loan was open, maybe it fell to 50 ETH. And so now the 25 ETH loan is no longer the same risk parameters. So market interest rate should probably change. This is a very similar dynamic to if you take a borrower position on an exchange, your interest rate on that position actually changes hourly. So it's actually even more aggressive than what blend enables. But on an exchange, when you have a borrower position, the interest rate changes hourly and then you can get liquidated instantly. This enables the exchange to offer much more aggressive loan parameters than you otherwise would be able to because they can liquidate you instantly.
00:21:44.388 - 00:22:26.364, Speaker B: On blend, the interest rate updates basically at most every, uh, like every 24, every 24, 30 hours. So it kind of, it still has this like dynamic interest rate model and liquidation period takes like 30 hours. So it's kind of has like similar, uh, dynamics to how borrower positions and lipiditions happen on exchanges. It's just a little bit more drawn out because of the fact that, you know, these assets are nfts, they're not fungible tokens, and it's a much less liquid market compared to the fungible token market. And so we cant really code the same parameters as exchanges where they do an hourly updated interest rate and instant liquidations.
00:22:27.224 - 00:23:13.794, Speaker A: This reminds me a little bit of uni v three, in the sense that as a liquidity provider, youre able to determine the range by which youre comfortable at supplying said liquidity. It sounds great. However, I think what weve realized is theres only a small subset of people that are sophisticated enough to actually manage these positions. And so I want to get into v three because I think it's relevant. You mentioned the paradigm team that was instrumental in architecting blend. So we'd love to perhaps just start with the story and then transition into your thoughts around how sophisticated the market is to actually deal with nfts as opposed to just regular tokens from b three.
00:23:14.834 - 00:24:05.818, Speaker B: I think that's a really great point. Actually, as we were talking, I was thinking the same thing, because the dynamic that we saw with uniswap, from uniswap v two to v three is v two was that full model. Everyone takes the same risk parameters. They just dump their assets into a pool and then that works to an extent. But V three was a huge unlock because it allowed, even though it's like a semi pooled model, it's somewhat peer to peer, it's also peer to pool basically allows the liquidity providers to have the full range of risk parameters. And that makes it more complicated, but then it also allows much more expressivity from a protocol perspective. And then, of course, xenosophy three became the dominant model for provisioning liquidity for fungible tokens.
00:24:05.818 - 00:24:52.414, Speaker B: And I think the reason for why that is, is if you study every financialized market in history, the progression is it always starts with, uh, you know, it'll start out simple and relatively less sophisticated. Right. Maybe it's more retail driven, maybe it's just like whales that, um, you know, are more passive. And over time, as the space grows, the liquidity becomes more experienced and professionalized. Um, as the space grows and scales, you end up getting, you know, institutional liquidity providers and you no longer have these like individuals provisioning liquidity. So like on Uniswap V three, the majority of the volume and liquidity is actually provisioned by market makers like Wintermute, et cetera. I think Wintermute does like 30% of Uniswap b three's volume or something crazy like that.
00:24:52.414 - 00:25:46.440, Speaker B: And then like the next five market makers probably do the remaining 80%. So basically every financial market over time professionalizes. The same thing is kind of at play here. Where when we were thinking through the space, and you're asking about the story, we basically started working with Dan Robinson, who is really the key inventor of uniswap b three. And we were thinking through how to design a protocol that would work for nfts. And I think you can see a lot of the similar ideas at play in blend, where instead of a pool model, where everyone takes those same risk parameters, when you're taking a loan against a peer to pool or trading as a peer to pool model, you're not actually trading against a protocol per se. The protocol really just forces everyone into the same risk parameters.
00:25:46.440 - 00:26:09.904, Speaker B: You're trading against a set of liquidity providers. And the peer to pool model basically is just saying everyone's going to be on the same terms. In a peer to peer model, you're trading against a set of liquidity providers. But those liquidity providers are expressing a much broader range of risk profiles and preferences. So that's the same thing that's happening in blend. And you can see a lot of the analogs there.
00:26:10.284 - 00:26:51.414, Speaker A: If you're a winter mute or a sophisticated liquidity provider, you're obviously going to pay attention to blend, right? If you have ETH that you want to supply, you say, well, I can capture a higher apy. And if you get comfortable with the mechanism and ample liquidity and whatnot, and the risk parameters, what do you see in terms of the next 612 months in terms of professional market makers coming in here? What does that do to the whole NFT market? And I know it's a broad question, but I'm curious as to what you think this protocol, the impact of this protocol will have on the NFT market and also potentially defi.
00:26:51.874 - 00:27:43.860, Speaker B: Absolutely. So I think ultimately the thesis of blur and the goal has always been just as we've studied and seen in the token market, where as the exchanges created more advanced infrastructure that enabled deeper, more institutional liquidity. It actually enabled even more growth for the consumers, whether that's traders, funds, or individual retail. The institutional grade liquidity and the full expressiveness that is unlocked through these economic primitives enables more growth on the demand side. And we are building blur to basically bring the same thing to nfts. We have to do it in an NFT native way because nfts as assets are fundamentally different than tokens. They are non fungible.
00:27:43.860 - 00:28:26.374, Speaker B: So there's both fungible and non fungible aspects of nfts, but they are a different asset class. But basically we're trying to build primitives from the ground up to enable a similar level of growth. And over the next six months, what I would expect is at the end of the day, yield is yield. And if you can provide yield on blend and provide ecom blend and earn a higher yield than you can, uh, through other mechanisms, then there, that's, that's, that's a arbitrage, right? Someone, someone's going to go and do that. So we would expect uh, over time, more and more liquidity to come in to blend. Uh, you know, because on the, on the demand side, there is a lot of demand. So the, the users of the protocol, these are typically, you know, NFT traders.
00:28:26.374 - 00:28:58.928, Speaker B: Uh, we've also seen um, you know, it's actually been really amazing seeing this kind of some of the, the reception to blend. In the past 24 hours, we've seen people tweeting about joining the garden. That's for Azuki's, for example. It's like when you get into Zuki, you join the garden. They're like, oh, just join the garden. Like Tsugi. So there's people who want to hold onto an NFT or even, almost even rent the NFT for a period of time, or they want to buy the NFT and they can't pay it all up front now.
00:28:58.928 - 00:29:40.706, Speaker B: So they'll pay a portion upfront and pay down over time. Similar to how people might use Klarna to buy a peloton and pay it down over time. So you have those people, and then you also have traders of course, as well, who maybe they don't have the full amount of ETH to take a position, a spot position, but they have some ETH, so they can take a partial position and capture some of the upside as well that way. So on the demand side, that's what we have is really the NFT native people on the liquidity side, we would expect that to be more professionalize over time. We would expect that right now I would say it's not that as much we see some defi people, but it's more. So it's still a relatively inefficient market. There's still higher.
00:29:40.706 - 00:30:16.170, Speaker B: As you saw, the average APR on blend, if the doom dashboard is accurate, is much, much higher than the average yield on a d five protocol. So it's still an inefficient market. But we would expect few who come in first to, to make the most yield. And over time, the yields probably should compress. But then also the sizes should also increase in terms of the total amount of liquidity. So maybe you're making slightly less yield, but on more aum. But we would expect that to be more professionalized liquidity providers to put some finer points.
00:30:16.202 - 00:31:00.584, Speaker A: So it's been roughly 23 hours since you launched, or 22 hours. There's been 846 loans accepted. There's been a total of 8820 ETH that has been loaned out. So roughly $15 million or so. I did notice that one of the largest liquidity providers was Big Maki, who has been fairly active in blur, to say the least. You talk about inefficiencies. What are some of the inefficiencies that you're seeing right now? And perhaps for someone that is looking to use blend, if you're like a winter, what are some of the perhaps profitable strategies that you envision people kind of deploying on blend?
00:31:01.124 - 00:32:01.230, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think I need to study the data a little bit more myself just to kind of be able to give you a thorough answer on that. But ultimately, I mean, it's the same with any market. The liquidity providers who will do the best are going to be the ones who take the time to understand the market. And by understanding the market, create loan offers with the proper risk parameters, with the proper ltvs that actually allow them to maximize their yield. So it's like, if you are, maybe you're someone in defi that wasn't looking at nfts at all. And then you looked at pumps, for example, you might be like, oh, it's an NFT, it's volatile, it's a liquid. I don't want to create any loan offers more than, you know, 30% LTV, because I think that this could crash at any time, versus if you're someone who's been in the space for a while, like, for example, there's one account that's like punks OTC, and they're like, literally like the only market maker for pumps.
00:32:01.230 - 00:32:50.528, Speaker B: And they've been doing it, like, you know, for, like, the past, like, year, maybe more. They really understand the market, and they're probably going to be like, okay, I kind of have a sense of what the right market price for punk should be. So I don't want to do a 30% LTV loan. Actually, I'm willing to do 60, 70, 80, even, maybe even 90% LTV loan, depending on the interest rate, because I have confidence that my pricing is accurate. And so I think right now, the inefficiency is more. So I don't think there's a lot of providers who deeply understand the market and also have liquidity and can create these loan offers. Um, you know, over time, that'll likely change, although I would say it's the NFT market has remained inefficient for a much longer period than I would have expected.
00:32:50.528 - 00:33:19.974, Speaker B: Uh uh. So, yeah, we'll see how. How quickly that changes. But basically, that's what I would expect over time is the people who really understand the market, they'll be able to make the best yield. Uh, because, of course, if you have, you know, too low of a risk or too high of a risk that you can get hurt both ways, you basically will just make less than you otherwise would because your yield will be too low or your risk parameters will be too aggressive. So the people understand it and can make offers in the sweet spot will do the best.
00:33:20.394 - 00:34:12.876, Speaker A: Yeah. A lot of what we talk about in NFTs is a floor, because, for instance, in a crypto punk, the floor is kind of the more basic crypto punk in terms of attributes. And so you have, out of the 10,000 collection, you have 20% or so that are just basic entry level punks or azukis or apes or whatnot. Certainly a fair amount of attributes that these nfts have or collections have. Talk to us a little bit about the plan in the future to incorporate more collections. So right now, you have three azukis, punks, and meladies. Where does this look in the next kind of, can you add? What are the challenges and opportunities to add more collections and not just floor nfts? So, for instance, a zombie punk or a much more rare Azuki or whatnot?
00:34:13.060 - 00:34:34.673, Speaker B: Yeah, great, great question. So we started with three collections to start with, punks, Azuki's, and miladis. Basically, we wanted three collections at three different price points. So punks floor is around like 55, 60 e. Azuki's is around like 15. Milady's was around like two to three. So it's three different price points for three different collections.
00:34:34.673 - 00:35:14.283, Speaker B: We wanted to start with three because we wanted to basically make sure that we concentrate attention and build up liquidity in those collections. Because blend only works if there's a somewhat efficient market. It works over the long term because the market does just become more efficient over time, um, like just by default. But we wanted to basically minimize the period in which it was inefficient. We wanted, we wanted that period of inefficiency to be basically zero. So that's why we started with, you know, three collections of Sartre. And then once we feel comfortable with a level of liquidity, uh, in those three markets, then we'll add more collections.
00:35:14.283 - 00:35:52.658, Speaker B: Um, you know, that could be, uh, a period of weeks, it could be a week, it could be a few days. Uh, it's really just a matter of just kind of like analyzing the data and be like, okay, like, do we feel good about this? Like, okay, like, let's add the next collection. Let's add the next next collection. I think the limit of that is eventually you get to a collection where it's like, okay, there's just not really enough, you know, borrower interests on it, right? There's not enough of a pedigree and enough of a history. And so there's not going to be like borrower demand. There's also not going to be much like lender demand. And so I think like at a certain point it just like it stops making sense to the ultra long tail probably doesn't make sense.
00:35:52.658 - 00:36:28.054, Speaker B: But if you look at exchanges or even defi protocols, the ultra long tailed is not really a thing either. Blend being peer to peer can actually support many more markets than a typical peer to pool model. Because since the peer to pool model keeps the same risk parameters for everyone, they have to be more conservative. If you look at Aave, for example, or compound, it's like they only have 810 markets. Whereas in a peer to peer model you can actually have much more. If you look at big exchanges, for example, they have many more markets that you can borrow against. I think if you go and buy an SS, there's hundreds that you can borrow against.
00:36:28.054 - 00:37:19.498, Speaker B: So that peer to peer model actually enables more markets. But basically we just keep on adding markets until it doesn't make sense. And then in terms of liquidity for the trades, the rare zombie punks, etcetera, uh, you know, that's absolutely something that we are going to explore afterwards. In general, right now, a lot of blur's uh, like product and protocol has been built around the floors because that's activity and liquidity is. But the thing that really excites us about nfts is that, you know, since they are non fungible, you also have these traits and, and there's also like, not even individual traits, but there's also grails as well, where it's just like one of one. How do we enable more liquidity for that? That's something that we'll focus on afterwards. I think that's probably something.
00:37:19.498 - 00:38:08.912, Speaker B: Just thinking off the top of my head, I would imagine that some of the parameters would need to change for enabling trait loan offers. For example, I think blend would be well suited for traits that are, that have a relatively active market. Maybe zombie pumps trade too infrequently for blend to really make sense. But there are certain pump attributes where it's like, okay, there's enough of a history there and enough activity that it makes sense. I could imagine us using a different, creating a different lending protocol just for individual nfts, just because it's going to be a little bit more, a little bit more customized for that. But focusing on trades is definitely going to be something that we direct our attention to next as core contributors.
00:38:09.088 - 00:39:04.008, Speaker A: Yeah, I want to talk a little bit about the APY, and I know the data, it's fairly early still, but there's season two. So a lot of folks, you could argue that the APY is being distorted because people are hoping to accumulate more points and get the airdrop, but in a kind of a steady state, kind of efficient market where like you could presumably see a whole lot of, well, not in a steady state, but like you're probably going to see after the 30 hours window, like a constant amount of automatic refinancings. Right. Because so say that I was one of the first ones and I'm willing to lend, you know, at a certain APY. And then that moves, which has been moving quite dramatically. When I looked two or 3 hours ago, the APY on some punks, the median was like 28%. Now it's jumped all the way to 60.
00:39:04.008 - 00:39:33.632, Speaker A: Well, if I was lending at the 20 range, I would immediately, like, as soon as I practically can, well, trigger an automatic refinancing that rate, that loan should reprice, right? Absolutely. And so I guess my question is perhaps, what's that APY curve like? Is it going to be super volatile initially and then it kind of stabilizes? Or do you constantly expect these kind of wild fluctuations in rates?
00:39:33.808 - 00:40:13.634, Speaker B: I think ultimately, if the market conditions change, then the APY will change to reflect those market conditions. And that's a feature, not a bug. If, if you have risk parameters that are staying constant even through volatile market conditions, then the only way that that can make sense is if the lender is basically being so conservative that they can, you know, handle that volatility. Um, which means that you're going to have much lower interest, uh, much lower ltvs, much, much rates. So we expect in the SETI.
00:40:14.334 - 00:40:25.634, Speaker A: Let me just interrupt. In that case, wouldn't the borrower, if he's getting a super low aPy. Sorry, a super low LTV, like, why would he accept that in the first place?
00:40:26.094 - 00:41:14.874, Speaker B: Yeah, so I mean, currently prior to blend, there were other protocols that like cured pure where it was like 50% LTV. And I had some usage, but less usage, usage than lend. I think, you know, in the market it's like that. That's a great question, is like, as a borrower, you're probably not going to be as interested in that super low LTV loan. So you're, you know, and I think that was kind of reflected in the market data. Empirically, when you enable higher ltvs across like the full range of people, then of risk parameters, then, you know, people who want to take a low LTV loan or are comfortable with that, they can do that, but then people who want to take a high LTV loan can, can do that as well. And, and enables basically more market participants, I guess, more market preferences to match.
00:41:14.874 - 00:41:45.694, Speaker B: Right. Cause that's what, that's what blend as a marketplace, we match buyers and sellers. And as a lending protocol, and I'm saying we here, like speaking from a protocol perspective, as a lending protocol, we match lenders and borrowers. And so if you allow the full expressivity, then you can match a lot more preferences. So that's why we were pretty confident that when we launched this, we would also see a lot more usage than we've previously seen on some of these other lending protocols.
00:41:47.394 - 00:42:02.762, Speaker C: I mean, do you think there's any analogy here with thinking about options and perps and why in crypto, like options still haven't really taken off yet? The perps have such a high volume. And I think part of it's just probably market maturity. But when you're thinking about this, when it's peer to peer versus peer to.
00:42:02.778 - 00:42:04.162, Speaker B: Pool, it kind of makes me think.
00:42:04.178 - 00:42:12.050, Speaker C: Of options versus perps because the options are customized based on duration and so forth. So I'm just curious, is there anything to learn from that that would apply here?
00:42:12.242 - 00:43:09.550, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that there is, and it really has to do with who the participants are. So we think about like options. You know, options are, I guess when you drill down into it, fairly simple. But the UX of options is so confusing and complicated, and so it's not really going to get a lot of usage from normal crypto participants. It's more so institutions like people who are using Darabit, it's not like individuals, it's more so institutional accounts, and it's just a more advanced financial primitive, I would say. Whereas perps is something that is something that basically any trader can use and wrap their heads around on the usage. On the UX side, I think the pricing of perps is quite complicated.
00:43:09.550 - 00:44:02.602, Speaker B: If you start asking people how do perks work, there's very few people that can actually explain how it works. But as a user, anyone can go and use that and it's fairly straightforward. I think a similar thing, a dynamic exists here where if you actually go on blur and try initiating a buy now, pay later transaction, or try borrowing against your NFT, the UX is fairly straightforward, but on the liquidity provider side, it can be a lot more advanced. So if you go to the loans tab of like punks, Suzuki or meladies, you'll notice it's looking a little bit complicated. Uh, and, and that's just a function of, you know, the liquidity providers are going to be different participants than the users. Um, that doesn't, that doesn't mean that options will never, like, for example, like NFT options. That doesn't mean NFT options will never be a thing.
00:44:02.602 - 00:45:08.834, Speaker B: But when we think about, you know, what makes sense of what will work, it, I think just like based on the market dynamics, it really, you have to look at like, who the users are in order to have think through the adoption of it. I do think there's a world where NFT options can become a thing, but I think that's probably a more mature, larger market, probably where nfts are not just Pfps, but maybe like real world assets, maybe like even like homes or things like that. Like, I think when once nfts start digitizing and putting on chain more assets than just pfps, and I think options could very much become a thing. And ultimately, when we think about the market, I think there's a great naval quote where he's like, tokens are going to eat all assets. Everything's going to be tokenized. Every fungible thing is going to be tokenized. We share a similar belief for nfts, where tokens might eat fungible assets, but non fungible tokens are going to eat non fungible assets.
00:45:08.834 - 00:45:27.074, Speaker B: The UX is so great. It's a 24/7 market. It's worldwide. We think that as a primitive can grow massive, really into a trillion dollar market. But I think as of right now, in terms of the market maturity, I would be surprised if something like options become super popular.
00:45:28.774 - 00:46:28.294, Speaker A: So I've heard you say in the first episode we recorded about you talking about blur, you did mention that it was very much built for a neglected part of the market, which was traders, NFT traders in this case, I'm just referencing a tweet by DC investor, fairly well known collector. He says, hey listen, the idea that you have to constantly monitor this position and within 30 hours you could have to take some sort of action makes me think that, and I'm quoting him, that this is really a product for people that want to go long in a particular NFT and have the capacity to monitor this 24/7 or have a really short duration. Would you agree with that? When you were architecting blend, you were also taking the mentality of we're just going to cater to more professional, active traders in the market versus collectors. Is that kind of a fair statement?
00:46:29.354 - 00:47:14.210, Speaker B: Yeah, I would say that's not quite accurate. I think right now, when we look at who's using it, you know, blend is such a new protocol that it's only people who are going to be more risk on and experimental that are using it. There's a lot of uncertainty around the dynamics, at least from a market perspective. Right. And so that means that people who are like collectors, that cause oftentimes collectors, they don't want to give up their grails or their nfts, but they might need liquidity. And so, you know, they'll still want to take out loans and that's serving the collector market. But I would expect right now that, you know, for those collectors, when they look at blend, they're like, okay, this is like a new thing.
00:47:14.210 - 00:48:15.420, Speaker B: I don't really know how it's going to play out, so I'm just going to kind of sit on the sidelines and decide later. But ultimately, this kind of mechanism, due to the perpetual nature of it, when we were designing blend, we also would talk to some of the traders or big whale collectors and we actually found that for them, having a perpetual mechanism is actually much more user friendly than having a fixed duration. That's the other popular model for peer to peer review lending is your fixed duration. And what we found was that actually for the fixed duration is basically, if you take out a loan for 30 days, you need to set a reminder 30 days later to pay back your loan, otherwise you lose your NFT. And we saw instances where literally the collectors might have had enough ETH and could have repayed a loan and actually wanted to repay the loan. Specific instances of this where they wanted to, but they forgot and they didn't get the notification in time or something like that. Uh, and then they like, lost their NFT as a result.
00:48:15.420 - 00:48:45.856, Speaker B: And so that's like a very unfriendly ux for borrowers. Worries with blend. The, uh, basically the liquidation mechanism is really due to market liquidations. Like in an efficient market, the liquidation will only happen if the market conditions change. It doesn't happen when the lender just randomly liquidates and, you know, it's like 03:00 a.m. At night, and you didn't get the notification, then you get liquidated. That in the steady state, that actually doesn't happen in the steady state.
00:48:45.856 - 00:49:16.150, Speaker B: What happens is, oh, the lender wanted their liquidity back. Okay, fine. Another lender stepped in and took over that loan. So in the steady state for collectors, they can actually take out loans against their nfts without having to worry about a liquidation unless the market conditions change. And what we found is, you know, pretty much everyone in the market will have some sort of pulse on the market conditions. Like, you know, you know, if bitcoin crashes or if it pumps. Right, like as, like a bitcoin holder, you know, even if you're like, passive, you kind of are aware of market conditions.
00:49:16.150 - 00:50:04.106, Speaker B: So this is something where when you think about, like, the dynamics of people in the space, it actually creates a much simpler ux. Um, and we also send a notification when that happens. It's not just we actually added email notifications as well. So not only are you probably already monitoring the market and aware of the marketing conditions, but you also will get a notification as well if your loan is in auction and it looks like the market conditions have changed and maybe it's not finding another lender as quickly as desired. So, yeah, basically my thesis would be in the steady state. This actually becomes much easier for collectors than having to set reminders for different loans. Of course, that's something that the market still wants to see play out before counter embracing it.
00:50:04.250 - 00:50:52.544, Speaker A: And to put a finer point, I mean, obviously this is early data, but if you're getting six 8% on your staked ETH or whatnot, even AV is fairly low or if you're not staking your ETH and you're able to earn ten x that as rate stands right now, obviously things will change pretty dramatically, but nonetheless they're fairly high. Yeah, sure. Some of that is nfts are by definition riskier kind of collateral types. I get that. But even in this dutch auction mechanism, I think your points are right. One which is there will be an efficient market where someone steps in and is willing to supply and pick up that loan. Even though liquidity dries up, there are always market participants out there presumably that are willing to supply liquidity at the right rate.
00:50:52.844 - 00:50:54.544, Speaker B: Preston. Yeah, absolutely.
00:50:55.374 - 00:51:22.482, Speaker A: You know, I guess I'm reminded of the day where like Black Thursday happen or Black Friday, I forget, it was like blurry set of 72 hours where maker had this problem where it was a whole set of issues on the. It was two problems. One, it didn't have enough of a keeper system like meaning people that were bidding on the collateral, gas prices were really high, so people weren't, the bids were not going through and the oracle was kind of all over the place. So it was like a perfect storm of things. And in this case it's just a bit different.
00:51:22.538 - 00:51:23.018, Speaker B: Right.
00:51:23.146 - 00:51:38.802, Speaker A: You certainly have to keep in mind, like the, you know, the flora punks does matter, right? You know, it kind of. If the flora punks all of a sudden drops from 60 to 30, well, you're going to have a problem right across kind of a lot of the loan book.
00:51:38.858 - 00:51:39.458, Speaker B: Right.
00:51:39.626 - 00:51:41.834, Speaker A: People are going to automatically want to refinance that.
00:51:41.994 - 00:52:26.348, Speaker B: That's kind of a fair statement, right? Yeah, yeah. Basically, you know, from a borrower perspective, this mechanism, honestly, it's more borrower friendly than lender friendly because if you have a position on an exchange and the market conditions change, you're getting liquidated overnight. Everyone who's in the trading space or in Defi, we've all seen tweets where people like, oh yeah, went to sleep and woke up and my account was liquidated. So that happens fairly often. And that's a risk of, you know, that. And exchanges need to do that because they can allow, they can do more aggressive positioning and they really need to be able to, you know, liquidate people instantly. Whereas on blend the locations happen over 30 hours.
00:52:26.348 - 00:52:43.074, Speaker B: And so as a borrower it's actually like whatever the borrower friendly you like. However borrower friendly, taking a position on exchanges, it's significantly more friendly with blend. Just because the liquidation mechanism is, is not instant, it's 30 hours.
00:52:44.374 - 00:53:39.142, Speaker A: Just on this point. Back to the maker example, there are very few keepers, meaning this people that were supplying liquidity or bidding on the collateral, those being liquidated. In this case. You talk about sophisticated people like punks, OTC, who knows the punk market extremely well in the stress scenario, where in this 30 hours window, could there be a situation where there's very few lenders out there that are paying attention to this stuff that they coordinate and are willing to kind of push the APy up to that limit, right? Because the incentive, if they're like three people, and you all know that's always the same three people showing up when these dutch auctions happen, when the incentive is to wait till 29th hour and then start kind of bidding right on this refinancing auction.
00:53:39.278 - 00:54:07.490, Speaker C: Santiago on that too. I just want to add that I've also heard some concerns like if you're taking a 90% LTV loan and then it's 30 hours are up and it goes into an auction, like especially if those lenders maybe control some of the floor price to some extent. I think this is really just a problem, the market being mature or not, like at the beginning. But if you could take out a 90% LTV loan, who's going to take that bid in the auction just because its such a risky loan against an inherently illiquid asset class?
00:54:07.602 - 00:54:57.184, Speaker B: Yeah, great question. So from that perspective, im just looking at the stats right now, and currently so far in the past 24 hours there have been 243 lenders on blend. I don't know exactly at what point. It's that sort of like it's really a prisoner's dilemma, right? It's like, okay, you might coordinate, but really the first person to not coordinate is going to be the one that keeps the yield and makes the best deal. And with on chain activity, it's like I can be like, oh hey, we're going to go and coordinate and then, oh no, a fourth wallet. Like a fourth mystery wallet. Wet and, and broke this promise and they got all the yield and it wasn't me.
00:54:57.184 - 00:55:36.006, Speaker B: So I think the thing about prisoners dilemmas is that it's so brutal. People defect so often the default case. So I would feel pretty confident in that not happening. And 243 is a large enough set that even with just, with three people with this kind of dynamic, or even just two, I would not feel super comfortable betting on a gas app on that happening with this many people. I would be incredibly surprised. One of those few hundred people is going to defect in and they'll do the refinancing at a good rate because they can make a profit.
00:55:36.110 - 00:55:36.754, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:55:37.574 - 00:56:03.750, Speaker A: On this point, if you're a less sophisticated liquidity provider and you have some meat laying around and you know the collection really well, or you have some understanding nfts, or even maybe you don't. Is there an, remind me here of the mechanism. Is there an incentive to get points for the season two or something where for you to kind of indicate in the order book of where you're willing to supply liquidity in certain terms?
00:56:03.902 - 00:56:36.904, Speaker B: Yeah. So the way the lending incentives work is, you know, and just, just for context, for season two, we have two types of points. Prior to blend, it was bidding points and lending points, and they're both equally weighted. So basically, at the end of season two, bidders would get half of the airdrop, and listers, we get half of the airdrop. And what we did with the introduction of lend is we didn't want to dilute that at all. What we did was for the collections. With lend enabled, we disabled the listing points and redirected them to lending points.
00:56:36.904 - 00:57:20.874, Speaker B: If a collection, we're going to get, let's say in a month, 100 points, 50 bidding, and 50 listing. With blend, instead of getting the 50, it gets zero listing points and then 50 lending points. So the total sum is still 100. It's just the allocations have shifted and the lending points are rewarded to lenders who create loan offers on the order book. A lot of people ask us, oh, why not reward people for taking positions? Um, but the issue is taking a position is the same as, uh, incentivizing volume. Anytime you incentivize volume, you just create the incentive for watch trading. Uh, and especially with, uh, even with a small fee, the watch trading is going to happen.
00:57:20.874 - 00:57:56.294, Speaker B: But with blend, there's, there's actually zero fees for borrowers and lenders. And so what that would happen is you would just see a lot, you see volume skyrocket, but that volume would just be pretty much fake. And you, you, we've seen that as well. In defi. It's played out, you know, numerous times where protocols will, will create incentives for taking out positions. And, uh, and then after the incentives run away, uh, you know, die off, you see the, the borrowing volume just like drop off, click, uh, because it was never real in the first place. So every incentive we've ever done at blur has always been focused on liquidity and not borrowing.
00:57:56.294 - 00:58:36.594, Speaker B: So, like, everyone taking a borrowing position on blend, they don't get any rewards for that. The only reward they got is that they had a nice loan offer at a pretty high LTv at a pretty good interest rate, and that allowed them to make a trade or borrow more ETH than they otherwise might have been able to. So basically the goal of the lending incentives is to create good liquidity conditions for borrowers. And then those liquidity conditions on its own should be what draws the borrowers in. This is similar to how on curve, the curve incentives, they only reward liquidity. You don't have any incentive to trade on curve any of that. Volume on curve is not due to any sort of like volume incentives.
00:58:36.594 - 00:58:45.374, Speaker B: It's due to curves incentives creating good market conditions for the users of the protocol, which is what we focus on as well.
00:58:45.914 - 00:59:08.298, Speaker C: Yeah, that makes sense. You talked about that in the last episode that we did. So everybody will have to check that out. One tangential question I have is with this buy now, pay later, and also it seems like maybe there'll be a little bit of a focus there on more of a retail, even though I know blur overall, as you said in the last episode, is like prosumer focused. I'm curious. There's been a shift to mobile, it seems, in crypto lately. And I know, like gaming will, then you have uniswap, also the sega phone.
00:59:08.298 - 00:59:28.014, Speaker C: How do you think about like that in general, crypto shift to mobile? And is that something you're already thinking about? Because I'm just imagining, for example, you were saying how you give email notifications. It'd be pretty sick if I had an app that I could easily do a buy now, pay later NFT. And then also I get notifications like, hey, you might need to top up here or, you know, some action being called.
00:59:28.674 - 01:00:36.186, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. I think when we think about, while we're aiming to build as core contributors, there's a lot of inspiration that we can take from the token market because the token market is much more mature than the NFT market. Right? NFTs really only popped off starting in 2020. Tokens have been around since 2010, so token infrastructure has had a decade more to develop. And when we look at protocols and companies that we like, Uniswap is a good one for us. They launched a mobile app that was nice, but I think a much better model is binance, where you can see that they started focusing on the crypto natives, but then they built out a broad suite of products over time to cater to the entire horizontal segment of the user base. And when we think about how to grow and develop products similarly, you can think of blur as building the binance of NFTs is the mental model now, of course, it takes time to build that out.
01:00:36.186 - 01:01:02.814, Speaker B: And so what you've seen, if you look at us empirically, what we've done, we focus on the prosumer market first, because that is a market that we still believe is the most underserved. But ultimately, when we think about collectors and even retail, like the next wave for the next bull market, right now, we're still in bear market, but in a bull market, we want to have solutions for the entire suite of users, but it's just going to take time to get there. Of course.
01:01:03.714 - 01:01:28.374, Speaker A: I know we're coming up in the hour here, and I'm curious. It just feels like yesterday that you launched Blur and now you've launched blend. What's next on the roadmap? I mean, there's a lot of hype around real world assets. I mean, as a reminder, nfTs, it's not just art. I think art is just the Segway, the beginning of what else is kind of possible. Right. But I'm curious, what are you thinking about next?
01:01:29.514 - 01:01:43.790, Speaker B: Yeah, I think one thing we've always done is we've kind of pretty much never shared what we do, what we have planned. We don't know which kind of, not.
01:01:43.822 - 01:01:53.222, Speaker A: Even with investors, to be fair, I had no idea that you were going to launch this. And you ping me, hey, can we record a podcast? We're launching something. And I was like, okay, I have no idea what this is.
01:01:53.358 - 01:02:31.314, Speaker B: Yeah, there's one investor that was dming me a few weeks ago and was like, oh, I hear on the grapevine you're launching nFT perps. And it's just like, I just ignored it. So, yeah, even with, with investors, we don't, we don't share, uh, anything, typically. Uh, we'd like to just, you know, release the thing that, that we're working on. Um, and we've been really grateful that, uh, that everyone, like, like Santi has been supportive, uh, even with that lack of information. Um, but, yeah, we typically don't like to project, uh, and just, and then just ship. But, you know, I think for the near term, for us, there's still a lot of low hanging fruit that we need to work on.
01:02:31.314 - 01:02:57.810, Speaker B: So even just for blend right now, a lot of the activity, it's not integrated with the activity feed, so it's hard to monitor. As a lender, you don't really have good stats. As a borrower, you don't have good stats. So of course, there's functionality to be built around that. So not just on the protocol, side, but on the application layer and then silver. The blur marketplace itself, there's basic low hanging fruit things. We still need to support trait bids, we still need to support individual bits.
01:02:57.810 - 01:03:12.844, Speaker B: We still need to um, you know, have more collector friendly Uis. And uh, we also need to optimize the gas. We were very fortunate to be able to work with transmissions eleven, who uh, is on the research team at paradigm. He's like this like basically like gas optimizing.
01:03:12.884 - 01:03:14.244, Speaker A: Like he's like a gas expert.
01:03:14.324 - 01:03:42.706, Speaker B: He's like the gas expert in high school. It's really hilarious. But he's like the best, like he's like one of the best solidity developers in the world. And he really helped a lot with optimizing gas for blend. He was also a top contributor to c port as well, which is um, you know, opensea's very gas optimized marketplace. And so for blur, one of the most common complaints that we see is, you know, that the gas is, is pricier than other marketplaces. Now for uh, any collection that's like priced at more than like 0.5
01:03:42.706 - 01:04:20.350, Speaker B: ETH, it becomes mostly irrelevant, uh, for most uh, for most people buying, selling just because like the gas is such a small portion of the total cost. But then for like cheaper collections, um, it becomes much more significant. So there's just like low hanging fruit like that. And that's something that. It's funny because when we see commentary in the market, a lot of the commentary is around where blur is today. But we've been building for 471 days the competitors that we, you know, are now like larger than from a volume perspective, but that we had to compete against. You know, they've been around for literally like five years.
01:04:20.350 - 01:04:47.524, Speaker B: Right. So there's just like a lot of, there's a lot of infrastructure to build both on the protocol side and on the infrastructure side. Ultimately we want to make sure that we can go. And we launched blend. We want to make sure that we're not ignoring the core user experience as well. Just focusing on the low hanging fruit in addition to some of the bigger splashier things that we're really excited to release. We really want to make sure that we focus on the basics too.
01:04:48.204 - 01:05:00.344, Speaker A: One just point that, I want to clarify on the point system. It's hard to go back, but is there kind of like a mechanism in how the points are calculated based on the duration of the loan?
01:05:00.644 - 01:05:26.588, Speaker B: Yeah, so basically it's very similar to, you know, how on curve it's like you get the rewards based on the duration is over time. Right. And then they take the integral and. And they do it. And on blend, it's similar. It's. You basically get rewarded points based on your loan sitting on the book over time, because it's the risk that you're taking.
01:05:26.588 - 01:05:37.716, Speaker B: It's a risk of liquidity that you're providing over a period of time. So you should get more rewards if you keep it on there for longer. So, yeah, hopefully that answers your question. Yeah.
01:05:37.740 - 01:05:43.488, Speaker A: You're basically taking a weighted out, like, weighted average duration and volume. Not just pure volume. Right. Of loans. Right. Because then you could.
01:05:43.536 - 01:05:51.936, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, exactly. And. Yeah, and I would hesitate to say, like, volume, like, yeah, like, volume of the liquidity is not just origination, but.
01:05:51.960 - 01:05:53.592, Speaker A: Duration as well, is what I tried to say.
01:05:53.648 - 01:05:54.432, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. That.
01:05:54.448 - 01:05:59.472, Speaker A: That makes total sense. Well, this is great. Garrett, any other questions? And before we.
01:05:59.648 - 01:06:00.964, Speaker C: No, that was great.
01:06:01.664 - 01:06:05.804, Speaker A: Pac man. Any parting thoughts before we wrap it up?
01:06:06.364 - 01:07:29.056, Speaker B: Yeah, I think ultimately, when we looked at the space, we really like thinking about it as if you look at how the token market grew, it really grew on the back of the underlying infrastructure, developing and growing as the infrastructure became more institutional grade. It allowed larger providers to come in, larger players, both on the demand side and on the supply side, from a liquidity perspective, and then at ease. What we saw was a incredibly inefficient market, both from the existing participants, but also from a capital perspective. If you have $100,000 asset and it's traded at that for the past two years or four years through both in bear markets, then there is value in that that you should be able to unlock. And if you're able to unlock that value, then that means that the market can be more economically efficient and it can grow larger. If you look at the token market, it grew massively with the introduction of these economic primitives. So the majority of volume in the token markets actually comes from this financialized infrastructure for bitcoin, like the spot trading volume, to derivative trading volume.
01:07:29.056 - 01:08:16.730, Speaker B: And that's a big bucket of things, of course. But the spot derivative trading volume, derivative trading volume is currently like ten x, the spot volume. So the vast majority of economic activity that is unlocked is literally basically through this infrastructure. It's like literally ten x for nfts. It literally had almost relatively zero financialization prior to the introduction of blend. And so when we think about that, we were really excited to introduce this financial infrastructure that we believe will enable more liquidity to come into the space, more economic efficiency to be unlocked, and more economic value to be unlocked, and basically allow the space to grow much, much larger. And that's useful not just for the space as it is today, but as we see the thesis, our thesis play out of nfts eating the world of non fungible assets.
01:08:16.730 - 01:08:30.314, Speaker B: That infrastructure, a lending protocol, whether you're using it for pfps or railroad assets or whatever it is, the NFT is encumbrancing. The primitive is the same. So we're really excited to see what this infrastructure can unlock.
01:08:31.214 - 01:08:54.680, Speaker A: Yeah, most definitely. It's really exciting and encouraging. I mean, it's been less than 24 hours, and I'm already fascinated, constantly refreshing this dashboard to see where the rates are. And you could just envision a whole set of products that are built and new primitives that are built on top of this. Really excited. I know you're not going to disclose it, but I'm sure there's a ton of stuff on the whiteboard that comes next. And so we'll probably have to have you on, I don't know, three, six months, a month.
01:08:54.680 - 01:09:06.240, Speaker A: I don't know. It seems like you guys were shipping at a record pace, so this has been great. I really appreciate going deep. Always really insightful discussion. So congrats and, yeah, keep up the great work.
01:09:06.312 - 01:09:37.514, Speaker B: Thanks for coming on the show. Just one last comment. As I'll say, it's quite interesting because with this infrastructure and the primitives, we're starting to see out definitely much more of an ecosystem develop around it as well. Like the dashboard that you're refreshing, that wasn't built by us, that was just built by a community member. And as the primitives unlock more behaviors, we're excited to see a lot more develop, even outside of just the core contributors. And seeing that already starting to play out is super exciting. But, yeah, we're definitely going to be working to contribute our own developments, too.
01:09:38.194 - 01:09:42.450, Speaker A: Awesome. Pac man, as always, a pleasure. Thanks for coming on the show. Really appreciate it.
01:09:42.562 - 01:09:42.954, Speaker B: Thanks. Having.
