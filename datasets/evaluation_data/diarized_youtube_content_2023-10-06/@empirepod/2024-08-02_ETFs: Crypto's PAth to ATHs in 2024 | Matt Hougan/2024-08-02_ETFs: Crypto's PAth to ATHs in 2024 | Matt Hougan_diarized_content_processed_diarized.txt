00:00:00.400 - 00:00:34.280, Speaker A: The idea of Ethereum raising its banner on the New York Stock Exchange is both an incredible accomplishment. There's like an element of the trojan horse being invited in Detroit that I really love about it. Again, it's making me think just how far we've come from just a few years ago where that was a crazy idea. It was a crazy idea. And yet there we were at the New York Stock Exchange with huge parts of the Ethereum ecosystem. People had been building in that space for ten years on the floor of the exchange, ringing the bell. For Ethereum, that's a pretty magical moment.

00:02:17.080 - 00:02:23.778, Speaker A: Life is good. I'm up in Maine, which is beautiful and lots of fun stuff happening in crypto, so I can't complain.
00:02:23.874 - 00:02:47.004, Speaker B: Nice. Yeah. Really casual weeks we've had here. Yeah, yeah, let's we're talking ETF's and I want to get the big questions that everyone's wondering out of the way. Like, hey, we've got the bitcoin and Eth ETF's. Why aren't we at all time highs? We got bitcoin and ETH. What comes next? Is it Solana? Is it something else? Do the institutions really care who's actually buying this? Is it self directed retailers? The institutions? But maybe we can just start with.
00:02:47.004 - 00:03:07.480, Speaker B: With expectations. Actually, I know you guys internally at Bitwise had pretty high expectations for the ETH ETF, but from my vantage point, it seems like we exceeded even those higher expectations. But I'm just a measly retail guy on the side. So I'd be curious, from your vantage point, how did the ETH go?
00:03:07.640 - 00:03:32.426, Speaker A: Yeah, I think there are probably two important things about that. The first is that we did exceed expectations. The new ETF's have pulled in a billion dollars in net flows in a single week. Right. That's among the fastest of all time in the history of ETF's. It's not on par with the bitcoin ETF's, but it's not that far behind, and it's really strong. The average ETF pulls in, you know, a million or $2 million in its first week.
00:03:32.426 - 00:04:13.780, Speaker A: So doing a billion is a big deal. At bitwise, we did a quarter billion dollars, which for us is significant success. So I think the question was, would anyone care about ETH ETF's? The answer is yes, a billion dollars cared. And then, equally importantly, I think we removed the risk of failure. If you remember way back, the ethereum futures ETF's launched, and there's no way to look at those as anything but basically a dud. Right? They didn't attract much interest, they didn't attract much trading volume. And so I think there was this question, do ETF investors care about ETH? But a billion dollars answers that.
00:04:13.780 - 00:04:24.520, Speaker A: Pretty definitively they do. And that tells me that we're going to get many billions of dollars of flows over the next six months and then the next year and the next few years. So, yeah, I think it's a success.
00:04:24.940 - 00:05:00.564, Speaker B: What is the. Maybe we can start with the who instead of the what. So when I was at the Coinbase state of crypto summit, which you spoke at as well, Cathie Wood and what's her name, Samara from Blackrock, both said the same thing, which was interesting to me, which is roughly 80% of the buyers of these ETF's are not actually the institutions, and that the institutional floodgates really haven't even opened yet, and that the 80% of the buyers are actually the self directed retail folks. I'd be curious if you guys are seeing that as well, and maybe why, if that's true, why is that the case?
00:05:00.702 - 00:05:42.484, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, that's broadly true. If you look at the data, the SEC requires reporting. So that 80% number reflects what was reported as owning the bitcoin ETF's at the end of Q one. So back in March, and it was the case that about 80% was self directed. I would say two things about that, though, Jason. First is if you remove that 80% for the bitcoin ETF's, and you just look at the 20%, that's institutional, it's the fastest growing ETF of all time. So it's absolutely the case that retail bought these in size, but it's also the case that institutions bought them faster than they ever bought any other ETF in history.
00:05:42.484 - 00:06:20.314, Speaker A: And I think that gets lost because it's a smaller fraction. So these are a success on both sides of the spectrum. We see both people in our ETF's. We're sort of the crypto native ETF issuer. And there's a strong embrace from the crypto community of bitwise as ETF's, in part because we donate some of the profits back to open source developers and we publish our addresses. But I had conversation with a couple, actually two or 310 billion dollars plus Ras last week about these ETF's, and they're thinking about building portfolios that hold both bitcoin and ETH. So I do think the institutions are coming.
00:06:20.314 - 00:06:24.516, Speaker A: I think that story is intact. But there's also this strong embrace by retail.
00:06:24.668 - 00:07:12.710, Speaker B: What is the pitch? Maybe you could walk through the pitch for bitcoin and the pitch for ETH, and the context for this is Santi and I have been talking a lot about this in the roundups, it seems like. So Larry Fink went on CNBC, right, and he basically just said three minute, beautiful commercial for bitcoin. But I think you could summarize it and say the best way, if there's chaos in the world and you're scared about chaos, the best way to get exposure to that fear was either shorting markets or buying gold. And today, the best way to get exposure is bitcoin, to that uncertainty or fear, whatever it may be, in the markets. EtH, it feels like, is this global computing platform for the new. For the new digital asset era, right? It feels like a totally different pitch. But I'm curious how you think about it and how you pitch these assets.
00:07:12.830 - 00:07:44.750, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I think that's right. I mean, bitcoin's a monetary asset. It's a hedge against chaos, it's a hedge against inflation, it's digital gold. It's an exciting technology, so it's got that element as well. But I really think that's how people think about it, that something they put in their portfolio that's not correlated to anything else, and that hedges them against dollar debasement, runaway inflation, and a loss of faith in institutions. So that's a relatively easy pitch. The way advisors think about ETH is as a technology.
00:07:44.750 - 00:08:25.982, Speaker A: They think of it almost as a picks and shovels way to play things like tokenization, or play the growth of stable coins, or play the growth of Defi, or play the growth of nfts. All those are built on ETH. So if you want to invest in tokenization, how are you going to do it? The best possible way is to invest in Ethereum. So I do think people think of it as a technology play. Now, I recognize to the ETH community, ETH has a lot of money ness in it. Like a lot of the value of ETH is it's a monetary asset to the Ethereum community. But from Wall Street's perspective, they need an easy place to bucket it, and they bucket it as part of technology.
00:08:25.982 - 00:08:29.810, Speaker A: And I think that gets them 70% of the way to the story on ETH.
00:08:32.270 - 00:08:33.686, Speaker B: What's the last 30%?
00:08:33.798 - 00:09:18.522, Speaker A: Well, the last 30% is that sort of that, that monetary aspect of Ethereum. I don't think its only value is in utility, right. Theres plenty of parts of the ecosystem that are legitimately denominated in ETH, right? Nfts are denominated. It is used as money, and so it has a monetary premium. But Wall street likes to think in simple ways. A simple way is bitcoin is digital gold, ETH is technology. A story ive been talking to a lot of investors about is pretty simple, which is if you own the Nasdaq 100, the QQQ ETF, which many people own as a way to play technology, and you don't own Ethereum, you're missing part of technology, you're only capturing a portion of it.
00:09:18.522 - 00:09:32.556, Speaker A: It would be like not owning AI, or not owning semiconductors, or not owning biotech. ETH is just another sliver of that technology sphere. And if you want to own tech, you need to own some queues and you need to own some eth.
00:09:32.668 - 00:09:49.596, Speaker B: Sure. Yeah. So then what's the you meet with these Ras, the financial advisors, sure. Some retail folks, big institutions. What is the main reason why people are not buying it. Is it a regulatory reason? Is it a. They don't understand the thesis reason? Is it lack of fundamentals? What is.
00:09:49.596 - 00:09:51.076, Speaker B: What is the reason why people don't buy?
00:09:51.188 - 00:10:24.196, Speaker A: Yeah, so most of it is just time. I mean, I do think that's what crypto misses, is when new products launch, professional investors don't rush to put them in their portfolio. These are people who are building portfolios that last people for 30 years. If they get to it today, or they get to it in three months, or they get to it in six months or a year, it's fine, right? I mean, for most new investments, they have to due diligence themselves. Then they have to arrange a call with their client, they have to review it, and then they have to execute it. That all takes time. These people have 100 different clients.
00:10:24.196 - 00:10:51.860, Speaker A: They have to arrange 100 different meetings. This process just takes time, not for crypto, but for everything. So the number one reason is just time. And I think they will eventually come. The secondary reason. People still get hung up on how can bitcoin have value if it doesn't have cash flow? I do think that that is still a stumbling block, and there's a great answer for that, but you need to be able to have that conversation with people, and that just takes time.
00:10:52.440 - 00:11:05.146, Speaker B: What about the interest outside of just bitcoin and Ethan? Things like Solana or NFTs or other l one s, or maybe even l two s or defi, what's the interest like in those assets?
00:11:05.258 - 00:11:36.200, Speaker A: Yeah, there's a lot of interest in Solana. The funny thing about these professional investor organizations is they usually have one person who absolutely loves crypto, and they want to be just on the outside of what is mainstream. So in the early days, that was liking bitcoin, because bitcoin inside these firms was a crazy idea. But now, by and large, these firms have come along and embraced bitcoin. Right. The CEO of Goldman Sachs just said, bitcoin is a store of value. So that's like a normal position.
00:11:36.200 - 00:12:07.890, Speaker A: Then for a period, it was Ethereum, but now we have bitcoin and ETH ETF's. And what I hear when I talk to these advisors is that the crypto person always wants to ask a question about Solana. So they always want to be a little bit ahead of where the market is. Beyond Solana, there's really sporadic interest. There's some interest in DeFi, there's some interest in DPin. Occasionally there'll be interest in one specific coin. But really, bitcoin EtH and Solana are the shining stars that the professional investor community knows about.
00:12:09.550 - 00:12:25.594, Speaker B: What's the pitch for Solana? Is it, hey, all these defi and all these things could be built on ETH. Don't try to get exposure to one thing, just buy the underlying. It's like buying a cloud platform. Like, all these websites are getting created. Go buy AWS or Amazon. Hey, maybe Solana comes along. It's a competitor.
00:12:25.594 - 00:12:32.930, Speaker B: Go buy Google cloud and AWS as well, because you don't know what it's going to be. Is that the main kind of story that's being told right now?
00:12:33.050 - 00:13:03.674, Speaker A: That is the main story. It's Betamax and VHS. It's BlackBerry and iPhone. It's Google and Yahoo. It's the fact that people have seen that technology is hard to predict. So do you want a layer one blockchain that's scaling through l, two s, or one that's scaling through parallelization? And they just, you know, they're not in a position to know the answer to that. I would argue that even people inside of crypto, though they have opinions, are not in a place to know exactly what will transpire.
00:13:03.674 - 00:13:10.298, Speaker A: And so I think most of them just want to own both. And that's a pretty standard response. I think it's smart, actually.
00:13:10.354 - 00:13:48.074, Speaker B: Yeah. Is. Do you think so? Mike and I have this conversation a lot, which is like, all right, if we sold our crypto, what would you buy? Because Mike and I both have, I mean, basically, 99% of our liquid exposure is crypto at this point. And it's like, I mean, like, I guess you could go buy Facebook or something, or Netflix or something like that. But how much of the demand for crypto right now, do you think is coming from? So, yeah, what are you going to go do? Buy Nvidia. Like, I mean, this, that chart looks crazier than bitcoin did in 2017. Like, so how much of the demand is coming for interest in crypto versus, like, uncertainty around what else you should buy?
00:13:48.202 - 00:14:20.450, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, look, there's certain areas of the market that I think people find very exciting. People are excited by AI, they're excited by the story you're seeing in India. They're excited by gene editing and the advances in biotech. So there are other areas that are exciting. But look, crypto has the best returns of any asset in the world over the last one, three, five and ten years. It's easy to see how it could still ten x from here. And so I do think people are attracted to that and they're looking for a way to get outsized returns.
00:14:20.450 - 00:14:32.206, Speaker A: And there aren't that many options. Like, I just rattled off four, but I think that's the complete set. Right. And crypto is probably the most attractive of that bunch. So I do think that matters.
00:14:32.398 - 00:15:05.136, Speaker B: Is there interest in. I imagine people bring up Coinbase stock? One thing that I'm kind of waiting for is more publicly traded crypto companies. So whether that's circle or Kraken or bitwise one day, have you guys thought about the strategy of putting together just a. I'd call it like I'm putting quotes around this word for people not watching on YouTube, like a. Nor a normal tradfi ETF, like a crypto ETF. That's just maybe Coinbase circle Kraken. And maybe you do throw in some bitcoin and ethan there as well.
00:15:05.136 - 00:15:06.424, Speaker B: But have you guys thought about that?
00:15:06.552 - 00:15:50.792, Speaker A: Yeah, I wrote a piece about this for my CIO memo about how to build the diversified crypto portfolio. And what I said was, using publicly available tools, it would be 60% bitcoin, 30% ETH and 10% crypto companies. Because I do think there are opportunities in crypto that it's hard to capture in the token or crypto asset space. You can capture some of what's happening in stable coins through Ethereum and Solana and Tron if you want to go there. But you cant capture all of it. A lot of the value in stablecoins is going to accrue to companies like circle. You can capture some of whats happening in the L2 space in arbitrum, et cetera.
00:15:50.792 - 00:16:19.128, Speaker A: But the fastest growing piece is base, which is part of Coinbase. I do think the default starting position in crypto should be at least bitcoin and ETH. Maybe bitcoin, ETH, Solana and then crypto companies. We have a crypto equity ETF bitq, which I think is the best on the market. But there are a lot of crypto companies. You mentioned Circle, Kraken and others which aren't public yet. And so I do think there's some interesting ways to gain access to that.
00:16:19.128 - 00:16:36.214, Speaker A: And I think that's pretty smart. I will add just one thing. The story that resonates better with institutional investors than almost anything is stablecoins. People love stablecoins. It's a us dollar bank account in every cell phone in the world. There are 8.2 billion people.
00:16:36.214 - 00:16:46.790, Speaker A: That's a huge addressable market that could want dollars. I think people would love a way to invest in stablecoins and there really aren't good public vehicles to do that right now.
00:16:47.250 - 00:17:27.744, Speaker B: Maybe you could walk us through, you mentioned the CIO memo. So two weeks ago you wrote this good piece about ETH etps and the path to a new all time high. And I don't have it in front of me, but you said something along the lines of everyone wants to know what's going to happen to the price of ETH after these ETF's launch. I think your summary was well probably chop around for a little bit. Therell be demand into the Eth ETF's but also selling out of the grayscale eth products. But by the end of the year well hit above 5000 and well hit a new all time high. I dont want to put words in your mouth, but can you just walk us through your thesis for the price action for the rest of the year? I think both bitcoin and ETH would be interesting.
00:17:27.832 - 00:17:56.296, Speaker A: Yeah, lets start with ETH. I think when these ETF's launch, it's great to talk about fundamentals, but what really matters is supply and demand. So in the short term, supply and demand determines the price. And so what I said about ETH was I didn't know what would happen in the first few weeks because I was concerned that a huge amount of money would flow out of the grayscale trust. A lot of those people in Ethe are not long term ETH investors. They're people who were simply arbitraging the discount. Right.
00:17:56.296 - 00:18:18.454, Speaker A: They're nothing systematically long. And so that money is going to come out also, people might sell it because it's gone up a lot and then have to pay taxes. So not all the money will come back in. And that's what we've seen. We saw $1.7 billion come out of that product in the first week, which is more than went into the new, the new ETF's that were launched, that was about 1.1 billion.
00:18:18.454 - 00:18:52.690, Speaker A: Right. So in the short term, and I think that could continue for another week or two, you could even have outflows from the ecosystem and that could be challenging to price, which I think is what happens. But in the long term, theres just so much demand for these ETF's. I think I put out a note, I expect $15 billion of inflows in the first 18 months. I think that could be too cautious. I think we might be above that based on the fact that we pulled in a billion into the new ETF's in the first week. And that's going to all else equal, drive up the price.
00:18:52.690 - 00:19:30.974, Speaker A: So the reason I thought we would chop around, or at least chop around up to the all time highs is you always have a series of investors who want to sell around the all time highs. We saw that in bitcoin. The price bumped its head against $72,000 a couple of times. And so you have to exhaust those sellers and then you move higher. But if we get $5 billion of ETF flows this year, were going to push it up to all time highs and exhaust the sellers there and then be above that. I think the same thing is true in bitcoin. I actually think were probably pretty close to exhausting the sellers at bitcoins all time high.
00:19:30.974 - 00:19:44.918, Speaker A: And I think as we get closer to the election, were going to push through that level. And then I think its fairly clear sailing up to about 100k where the next level of opportunistic sellers probably wait. Yeah.
00:19:45.014 - 00:20:06.158, Speaker B: This might be a really dumb question. Is that a quantitative or qualitative thing that you look at, like, is there a thing that you can look at on trading view or whatever charts you look at where it says we're being oversold here, overbought? Or is this a qualitative feeling that you have that look, people sell around all time highs, you got to push past clear sailing to 100k because it's this nice numerical number.
00:20:06.254 - 00:20:18.976, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's just behavioral. Um, it's qualitative. Right. And you can look at his history. Right. You. I'm not a chartist, but you can often see an assets bump against their all time highs.
00:20:18.976 - 00:20:24.776, Speaker A: And I think that aligns with behavioral tendencies. And it's indeed what we saw with bitcoin, and I think we'll see it with eth as well.
00:20:24.888 - 00:20:54.378, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Even, uh, it's funny, my, um, I feel like I've been bringing up my wife too much on empire. So, uh, she just funny because I think she is a good indicator of, like, retail, someone who doesn't pay attention to crypto and how they think about buying and selling crypto from a retail perspective. And when bitcoin hit an all time high, she's like, all right, bitcoins at an all time high. Let's sell. I was like, what? She's like, yeah, it's at an all time high. Let's sell.
00:20:54.378 - 00:20:57.882, Speaker B: I was like, oh, man, we were looking at this differently.
00:20:57.986 - 00:21:16.914, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I think that's completely normal. I think normal. I mean, if I, if you woke up and bitcoin was at $82,000 would you think it's going to 100k like you probably would, but right now it's this overhang. People are part of the market, so you can't overlook it.
00:21:17.002 - 00:21:52.432, Speaker B: Yeah, I also think we'll get a lot of selling. I agree. I think the other reason is at think there's this idea. When you talk to people who have been in crypto for a while, what's bitcoin going to this cycle? They usually say 100, 2125, 150, somewhere between 120 and 150. So the quote, smart money, who's been in crypto for a while, they say, I'm not going to wait until 120 because I didn't sell the top in 2017, I didn't sell the top in 2021. Let me take some chips off the table, like 80% of the all time high of what I think it's going to go to. And if you do the math, that's around 100k as well.
00:21:52.432 - 00:21:53.032, Speaker B: So.
00:21:53.176 - 00:22:03.698, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I wish there were more sort of quantitative, hard facts here. But again, the market is made up by people and this is, this is what I've seen.
00:22:03.834 - 00:22:29.480, Speaker B: So what's it going to take for the institutions? You know, you've got the Larry finks on CNBC and. Yeah, I did see the Goldman, who's a David, David Solomon, I think it was at the Olympics on CNBC, said bitcoin is. Could be a good store of reserve or good reserve currency here, or, excuse me, a good store of value. What's it going to take to get these institutional allocators to just start buying bitcoin? And Ethan?
00:22:29.590 - 00:23:19.008, Speaker A: Yeah, it's going to happen, and I think it's going to happen in the second half of this year. So there are two levels at which we should, we should talk about it. The first is the wire houses. So, you know, if you think about the us wealth market, it's 20% self directed retail investors, people managing their own portfolios, they can already buy these ETF's and they're the big driver of assets. It's 40% wealth managers. So people managing money on behalf of individuals, and then 40% institutions like pensions and etcetera. In that wealth manager space, most of the money is controlled by people who work for firms like Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, UBS, Merrill lynch, et cetera, big firms, and they can't yet buy these ETF's because they haven't gone through the due diligence process that's happening right now.
00:23:19.008 - 00:23:48.474, Speaker A: And I expect that that will unlock late Q three, early Q four, and when it does, all of a sudden you can have trillions of dollars of wealth managers moving into the space. And so I suspect that will happen. The pension side, the true endowment side, that's slower, but we're starting to see it. Right. It used to be one name, now it's three or four or five. I think they'll probably be something like ten when we see the Q two holdings of bitcoin. But that's more a three or four or five year story.
00:23:48.474 - 00:24:10.310, Speaker A: Look, ETF's are multi year stories. If you look at the gold, ETF's inflows rose seven years in a row. The first year was big, the second year was bigger, the third year was bigger, the fourth year was bigger. We're going to see the same thing in bitcoin, so patience. I think they are coming and when they do come, it'll be trillions of dollars.
00:24:11.010 - 00:24:39.290, Speaker B: I noticed you didn't mention one group which are corporate treasuries. This is honestly one narrative that I've always found to be a bit silly, is that companies are going to buy a bunch of bitcoin, put it on their balance sheet. Um, I just. Maybe I'm mid curving it too much. I just have never really got on board with that thesis. But what are, what are you seeing here? And am I wrong? Are these Fortune 500s going to come out and we're going to see it in the reports that they're, that they're buying bitcoin?
00:24:39.450 - 00:25:02.224, Speaker A: I mean, I think it's a very similar, almost a similar question to central banks buying bitcoin. It's not the core of what companies do. Right. What companies do is they make products and sell them and create profits and then distribute dividends. Their treasury management is just a way to have cash to make payroll and to fund investments. So I agree with you. I dont think its going to be mainstream.
00:25:02.224 - 00:25:31.888, Speaker A: Youll see more companies doing it, but you dont see these companies holding stocks or having venture portfolios. Its somewhat atypical. You see some companies doing it, but its atypical. I think it will be atypical with bitcoin, at least until it's extremely mainstream. They don't hold gold, they don't hold silver. I'm not sure that they're all going to hold bitcoin, but clearly some of them do and they're being rewarded by the market for doing so.
00:25:31.984 - 00:25:43.734, Speaker B: Yeah. Big question on everyone's mind, what comes next. So we got bitcoin, we got eth. What are the next, maybe three products that you think come into the market and what do you think the timeline looks like?
00:25:43.872 - 00:26:02.778, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, first, I just want to emphasize its continued unlocks of bitcoin. And ETH is the biggest story. Right. Those are maybe 30% open to the market, and going from 30% to 100% is a much bigger deal than Solana or litecoin or dogecoin, et cetera.
00:26:02.914 - 00:26:07.434, Speaker B: Can you explain that? Actually, I actually, I didn't realize we're only 30% unlocked, so what?
00:26:07.482 - 00:26:50.216, Speaker A: Yeah, well, it gets to what I was speaking about, which is these major platforms that haven't yet approved these ETF's for sale. Right. They represent most of the wealth in this market and institutions. While they don't have a formal, like, key switch, there'll be a day when Morgan Stanley approves bitcoin ETF's, there won't be a day when all institutions do. But they're all running their due diligence process, and that process takes time, takes six months, twelve months, 18 months, 24 months for any asset. And so, yeah, I think most of the market is not yet turned on, even to bitcoin, much less to the Ethereum ETF. And that's going to happen over the next six to twelve months.
00:26:50.216 - 00:27:26.368, Speaker A: And again, this isn't unique to crypto. This is par for the course for ETF's. So I think that's by far the biggest story. Probably the next biggest story are variants of bitcoin and ETH. I think you're going to see a lot of momentum strategies and covered call strategies and other strategies wrapped around bitcoin and Ethan in terms of other assets. People have filed for Solana EtF's. I think if we get a regulatory reset in November, youll start to see things like Solana ETF's become possible under the current regime, theyre just not possible.
00:27:26.368 - 00:27:35.860, Speaker A: But we could see a major change in the fall or in the spring of next year that makes those suddenly possible and then well have a wide array of ETF's.
00:27:37.250 - 00:27:51.146, Speaker B: Do you? So, obviously, I think what you're referring to is if Trump gets elected and we get this more hands off SEc or agency, a lot of things can unlock. What about if Kamala gets elected?
00:27:51.298 - 00:28:34.746, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think the right response is we don't know. She's talked about a reset towards crypto. I think maybe there are two paths that she could go down. She could go down the Elizabeth Warren path, which is the SEC path we've been on, in which case, anything beyond bitcoin and ETH is very, very difficult. There are no regulated futures markets on Solana or any other assets. It's just very hard to imagine the ETF landscape expanding beyond bitcoin and ETH. They'll still be there, and they'll even have a degree of regulatory capture in terms of investor mind share because they'll be the only approved assets, but it'd be very hard to go beyond that.
00:28:34.746 - 00:29:04.680, Speaker A: But I think if she goes the other direction and creates a more sort of normalized policy towards crypto, then I think we will see those other assets unlock over time. That pathway is probably slower than the republican pathway, which could just have a very different SEC mindset to what's allowed. The democratic pathway probably requires legislation and slower change over time, but it will open up as well to Solana and to multiple other assets.
00:29:06.340 - 00:29:49.758, Speaker B: Hey, everyone, Jason here. I wanted to talk about something that's been on my mind a lot recently, and that is, where are all of Crypto's killer apps? We often ask this question on this show, so I'm excited to tell you about Empire's latest partner, Anoma, the universal intent machine. Intents are a new way to build dapps, enabling users to say what they want without needing to specify how it's done. Let's say you have an NFT on one chain, but you want to swap it for a token on another chain. To make things even worse, you also don't know which bridge to trust or how to navigate different Dexs on each chain. Disaster, right? But here's the good news. Thanks to intents, you can just tell the app what you want to do, and Enoma's solver network takes care of all the complexity in the background.
00:29:49.758 - 00:30:33.080, Speaker B: We're excited to see what cool dapps Anoma's architecture will unlock to stay up to date with Anoma. You can follow them@x.com Enoma or sign up for the newsletter@anoma.net dot special thanks to Anoma for sponsoring today's episode. Hey, everyone, I wanted to take a second to talk about Real a permissionless l two for tokenized real world assets on arbitrum orbit. What's really cool about Real is that it uses the off chain yields from RWAs as a sustainable solution for native liquidity incentives. Real is also the first l two, where 100% of profits from transaction fees and fees from protocols accrue back to the l two s governance token.
00:30:33.080 - 00:31:18.654, Speaker B: RWA Real has just launched their rewards program, where 10% of the RWA supply is being given away to early users of the chain. Users can provide concentrated liquidity, trade, borrow, and leverage tokenized real world assets including t bills, real estate and tokenized basis trades. Just as a quick disclaimer, this is not investment advice or product solicitation and not aimed at us persons. Find out more at Re al rewards. Special thanks to Real for sponsoring today's episode. Hey everyone, Jason here. I wanted to quickly talk about Kronos ZK EvM, a next generation zero knowledge L2 blockchain network focused on scalability, security and innovation.
00:31:18.654 - 00:31:59.862, Speaker B: Secured by Ethereum, it further expands the Kronos ecosystem using Zksync tech. Kronos Zkevm has launched its pioneer program offering early users loyalty points for engaging with Kronos Zkevm and its dapps. Join the first quest by depositing CRO in the Cronos Zkevm bridge to receive ZK CRO and loyalty points at Mainnet launch. And that's not all. In addition to receiving Zkcro and loyalty points, you could also win part of a $30,000 ZK CRO giveaway by depositing in the bridge. The more you deposit, the better your chances of winning. Visit zkevm dot kronos.org
00:31:59.862 - 00:32:44.130, Speaker B: bridge for more info. Now let's get back to today's show. This episode is brought to you by Avalanche. Avalanche is a leading network of blockchains, giving some of the world's largest financial institutions the design space to explore new use cases and business models while leveraging completely customizable infrastructure. Everything that Avalanche has been building the last few years has culminated in this moment where today you have institutions and developers able to essentially have limitless possibilities with the chain. They've enabled developers to build cross chain swaps or create gaming environments where one subnet can unlock features in another or can use USDC as a native gas token. Onyx, for example, by JPMorgan or Citi or DTCC's digital assets, or the Australia New Zealand Banking Group.
00:32:44.130 - 00:33:12.070, Speaker B: They're all building on avalanche evergreen subnets really cool stuff. Big thanks to avalanche for sponsoring this episode of Empire. Go explore avalanche Subnet ecosystem at core app forward slash Discover. That's core core dot app discover. Thanks again avalanche. On a more personal note, like what do you what do you make of all the craziness in the election and just, I dont know. Trumps saying hes going to build a fort knox of bitcoin.
00:33:12.070 - 00:33:14.738, Speaker B: All this madness. Id love to just get your thoughts.
00:33:14.754 - 00:33:52.430, Speaker A: Preston yeah its something that just rattling around in my mind for the last few days. I think my long term takeaway is we need to sort of widen the Overton window of whats possible in crypto. One of the funny things about being sort of trying to be a rationalist in crypto is that it's the land of hype and hyperbole. For years, bitcoin was either going to $0 or it was going to a million dollars, depending on who you talk to. And I think some of us have sort of carved out a path. This is a disruptive asset with risks and opportunities. It's interesting and exciting, but those are extreme outcomes.
00:33:52.430 - 00:34:39.290, Speaker A: Coming out of the Nashville conference and washing what's going on, even with the Harris campaign or with various senators or various representatives. I think you have to start widening the possibility that you really could be talking about bitcoin being hundreds of thousands of dollars if we get a regulatory reset, let alone central banks buying bitcoin. It's such a game changer. It's so far out of where we were even two years ago. Two years ago, FTX was collapsing. Today David Solomon from Goldman Sachs called bitcoin store of value. A few years ago, they were seizing signature bank even though it wasnt insolvent, and today were building a bitcoin Fort Knox.
00:34:39.290 - 00:35:05.010, Speaker A: Its hard to wrap your head around how much the conversation has shifted. And I think for investors, you have to widen out the right tail of what this asset could be. Its still not likely that it immediately goes significantly higher, but I think you have to accept that six figure bitcoin has a reasonable probability of being here sooner rather than later, given whats going on in DC.
00:35:06.190 - 00:35:11.318, Speaker B: If I had to ask you to put a timeframe on that sooner rather than later, what are you going to say, Preston?
00:35:11.334 - 00:35:19.246, Speaker A: Look, I think bitcoin could be north of $100,000 this year. I think thats a very real problem.
00:35:19.398 - 00:35:25.590, Speaker B: I agree with that. Thats my mental model, too. Right now, we could be at six figures by the end of the year.
00:35:25.670 - 00:36:14.180, Speaker A: Be at six figures by the end of the year. And then depending on how things sort out, we could be significantly higher in 2025. I do think you need to start modeling in a major regulatory and political reset towards crypto. The industry has been working for the last four years with both hands tied behind its back and like a parachute pulling backwards. And not only could those be released, but you could get a tailwind. And I don't think the market has realized just how significant that shift would be if it in fact occurs. And even if it doesn't occur, if we get just a normalization of crypto, I think we'll be heading towards six figure bitcoin in relatively short order based on what I'm seeing in the market right now.
00:36:14.520 - 00:37:18.678, Speaker B: Okay, so let's play this out a little bit and think about it from a portfolio perspective. I think in your CIO memo, you said the best portfolio for maybe a more cautious institution who wants to get exposure to crypto is like 60% bitcoin, 30% ETH and 10%, what was it, publicly traded crypto companies? I think it was so the coinbases and miners of the world. What if you are not the cautious institution and you're inside of crypto and you're saying, Matt, you've got all these insights and youre telling me that bitcoins going to go above one hundred k and you think ETH is going to hit an all time high. Well, over the last couple of cycles since crypto has existed, the long tail tends to basically have higher beta than bitcoin and etH. And on the downside, that sucks, but on the upside, thats really, really cool and thats really, really fun. So how do you think about the portfolio, not for an institution, but for maybe a crypto native person listening to this episode?
00:37:18.814 - 00:38:01.054, Speaker A: Yeah, well, look, I think you have to be anchored in bitcoin and ETH because those are the two leading assets in the two leading use cases that exist in the market today. And again, I think theres this possibility of a regulatory direction in DC that leads with those assets in a really unique position that benefits them at the expense of other assets. So I think you want to be anchored in bitcoin and eth. But look, we're at the part of the cycle where all coins tend to outperform. I think a high quality 20%, 10%, 20% allocation to smaller assets I think could make sense. As you know, I'm a big index investor. Most of my money is in our index fund, which is the ten largest assets.
00:38:01.054 - 00:38:25.944, Speaker A: That's a pretty boring answer, but also, I think a pretty good answer. But I would at least want exposure to Solana, and I would pick and choose some smaller, interesting projects to have a more complete portfolio. Otherwise, you're missing the growth of L2s, you're missing the growth of DeFi. I think there's some exciting things out there.
00:38:26.032 - 00:38:43.118, Speaker B: Would you basically, do you think the best strategy for that is pick five areas that you like? Maybe it's AI crypto, L, two s DPin, just buy the top two or three in all of those areas because you can't really pick a winner. Try to pick the top two to four and just get exposure to all of those.
00:38:43.254 - 00:39:17.632, Speaker A: Yeah, I love that strategy. We have a strategy called the crypto category leaders, which defines the market into seven different categories and holds the leading asset in each one. So the leading monetary asset, the leading L2, the leading smart contract platform, and so on. I think that's a good strategy. I think you could expand it a little bit to hold maybe the top two assets, and you would be in a great position because all of those will have their moment. Right? Defi will have another moment, and you're going to want to have some exposure. So just, just own all the categories, I think is a good starting point.
00:39:17.696 - 00:39:18.384, Speaker B: Own it all.
00:39:18.472 - 00:39:19.820, Speaker A: Just own it all.
00:39:21.560 - 00:39:23.140, Speaker B: What was it like to ring the bell?
00:39:23.880 - 00:40:07.576, Speaker A: It's always great to ring the bell. I mean, the thing about the bell ringing, which I really loved, and I actually wasn't there, I was in Nashville for this one, although I've done it in the past. There's something, if you've seen it on Twitter, about the banner going up on the outside of the New York Stock Exchange. It was for our ETF, but really it was for ethereum. The idea of ethereum raising its banner on the New York Stock Exchange is both an incredible accomplishment. There's an element of the trojan horse being invited in Detroit that I really love about it. And again, it's making me think just how far we've come from just a few years ago where.
00:40:07.576 - 00:40:24.032, Speaker A: That was a crazy idea. It was a crazy idea. And yet there we were at the New York Stock Exchange with huge parts of the Ethereum ecosystem. People had been building in that space for ten years on the floor of the exchange, ringing the bell for Ethereum. That's a pretty magical moment.
00:40:24.176 - 00:40:38.616, Speaker B: That is magical. Yeah. So how does that come to be? Is that a sales pitch to bitwise? Are they saying, look, when you guys decide to go public one day, you should go public on our stock exchange, not the other guys stock exchange, and we'll do these cool things for you.
00:40:38.728 - 00:41:20.064, Speaker A: Yeah. That's part of the competition between the exchanges, which is not to say that Nasdaq is lesser exchange or CBoe, but there is something iconic, I think, about listing crypto asset ETF's on the New York Stock Exchange on Wall street, like the home of the buttonwood tree. It's just so incredible. And if you haven't ever been there before, being on the floor of the exchange is sort of a magical experience. You do feel this history of american capitalism, and then if you're there for crypto, you feel where that capitalism is taking a, this, this industry, and it's, it's really pretty special.
00:41:20.192 - 00:41:28.384, Speaker B: Yeah. I had the feeling when I was there, I was like, we've, we've, we've infiltrated. Like, yes. I can't, I can't believe they're letting us in here.
00:41:28.512 - 00:41:31.192, Speaker A: That's what I mean, that's, that's the Trojan horse thing.
00:41:31.216 - 00:41:31.416, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:41:31.448 - 00:41:39.128, Speaker A: Like, like you're letting us ring the bell for Ethereum. Don't you, don't you understand what's going to happen?
00:41:39.224 - 00:41:42.706, Speaker B: Can't you see? Yeah, that's pretty great.
00:41:42.778 - 00:41:57.866, Speaker A: I think that's great. I love it. Look, exchanges evolve, right? Started under, underneath the tree a few, you know, not that long ago they were trading pieces of paper, then it moved upstairs to digital, and now they've invited Ethereum in, so maybe they know where it's going.
00:41:57.978 - 00:42:02.874, Speaker B: Yeah. Do you have any thoughts on if these exchanges will trade?
00:42:02.922 - 00:42:14.236, Speaker A: Twenty four seven, I think eventually. I mean, it's such an anachronism, right? It's completely absurd. They just moved to settle trades in a day instead of two days.
00:42:14.308 - 00:42:15.000, Speaker B: I know.
00:42:15.540 - 00:42:42.260, Speaker A: It's so funny. There's a Bloomberg headline that said stock exchanges settle trades the fastest they have in 100 years because a hundred years ago they settled them in one day and then we went backwards for 100 years. Just imagine cars finally catch up with horses. It's a pretty incredible moment. Yeah. But, yeah, they'll trade 24 7365. That's the way the world works.
00:42:42.260 - 00:42:48.460, Speaker A: We're totally digital and we're totally global, and I think both of those things will switch.
00:42:48.580 - 00:43:25.030, Speaker B: Yeah. Can you take us into Bitwise's strategy conversations when you guys are talking about how you compete with the likes of Fidelity and Blackrock and I, these invesco and these huge financial players that I don't think people can wrap their heads around how big their distribution really is, how many financial advisors they have pushing products. But here we are, and you guys, I mean, I haven't looked at the, I should have looked at the numbers going into this episode, but I mean, you guys came out at least for the ETH, ETF ahead of folks like fidelity. So how is that possible?
00:43:26.650 - 00:43:30.058, Speaker A: It's a great question. Thank you. I mean, I think you have to think about.
00:43:30.154 - 00:43:35.050, Speaker B: I do, seven of these podcasts, us, every day, three years in a row.
00:43:36.910 - 00:43:58.906, Speaker A: There's an element of that. No, I mean, look, you have to understand how you can't compete. We're not going to out market Blackrock. We're not going to have a bigger sales team than Blackrock. We don't have as well known brand as Blackrock. So you have to find where you can compete. And where we can compete is we can be the most crypto native ETF issuer.
00:43:58.906 - 00:44:48.242, Speaker A: We express that by doing things like donating 10% of the profits from each ETF to open source developers in that ecosystem, by doing things like publishing our Ethereum custody addresses and tying them to ens domain names. And we do it by writing and understanding this space better than other people. And it turns out that there are many investors who want to work with a specialist. It sounds maybe surprising in crypto, but if you put it in other terms, of course it's true. Would you hire a stock manager to manage your bond portfolio or a commodity manager to manage your stock portfolio? Of course not. Would you hire a venture capital firm to invest in private equity? No, you would want a specialist. You want a venture capital specialist, a private equity specialist.
00:44:48.242 - 00:45:20.030, Speaker A: It turns out people want a crypto specialist. And there actually are like fundamental advantages to how we trade bitcoin versus how some of these other people trade bitcoin. There are fundamental safety procedures we put in place that are different from how other people work with trading in custody. And it turns out that people want this specialist asset manager. I think there's a place in the world for a large crypto asset manager that cares about the crypto ecosystem. And the hope is that bitwise can fill that role.
00:45:21.770 - 00:45:26.466, Speaker B: Do you guys think that you'll get into the financial advisory business, Wanda?
00:45:26.618 - 00:45:41.642, Speaker A: I don't think so. I think we serve financial advisors. I think our lane is going to be helping investors gain access to the opportunities in crypto at the lowest possible cost and the highest possible quality. Right?
00:45:41.746 - 00:45:46.580, Speaker B: Yeah. Can you give us a sneak peek? And while you guys are cooking up for the rest of the year, oh.
00:45:46.620 - 00:46:13.324, Speaker A: We have some big announcements coming this year. I'm really excited about it. Let's see, what can I talk about? Look, look, I think you're going to see us innovate on within the bitcoin and ethereum space. I think you'll see that coming out from us. And more than anything, you'll see us continue to put our shoulder behind these ETF's again. They have multiple years to run. I say this fact all the time.
00:46:13.324 - 00:46:23.284, Speaker A: We do 20,000 meetings a year with financial professionals to talk about crypto, and that means we got another 8000 or so to go this year. So that's going to be a primary.
00:46:23.332 - 00:46:27.100, Speaker B: Thing that you guys have done 12,000 meetings with financial advisors this year.
00:46:27.220 - 00:46:30.540, Speaker A: Financial advisors and family offices and institutions? Yep.
00:46:30.580 - 00:46:35.040, Speaker B: Where do you keep track of that number? Do you have a big, like, board that just is ticking up?
00:46:35.340 - 00:46:49.986, Speaker A: That's exactly right. Yeah. Salesforce, man, look, we have an incredible team here. And that's what they do each and every day. They wake up early in the morning and they start doing meetings. They're on the road. I think we did 52 events in the first half of the year.
00:46:49.986 - 00:47:04.314, Speaker A: This is what it takes to introduce people to crypto, because it's not just one meeting and somebody buys, you need to meet with them multiple times over multiple months to help answer their questions, and then they eventually come into the market.
00:47:04.482 - 00:47:21.184, Speaker B: Do you think that you're competing more for dollars with crypto funds? So let's say the electrics and paradigms of the world, or like Blackrock and Invesco. Infidelity, who's a bigger competitor for your capital?
00:47:21.312 - 00:47:47.710, Speaker A: Yeah, Blackrock investo and Fidelity. I think the money that is coming into bitwise today is allocated to the S and P 500 or the Nasdaq 100, which is primarily tech stocks. And it's money coming out of that into us. People are still going to invest with electric. People still want high quality venture. We don't do venture. We do liquid tokens and publicly traded companies.
00:47:47.710 - 00:47:56.562, Speaker A: And so I think people are going to do both. So we really consider our competitors to be Blackrock and fidelity. That's who I think about.
00:47:56.746 - 00:48:08.472, Speaker B: Got it. Anything I'm missing here, Matt? This is interesting chat. Anything I know you're coming to permissionless later this year. That'd be exciting.
00:48:08.576 - 00:48:09.784, Speaker A: Can't wait for permissionless.
00:48:09.832 - 00:48:18.152, Speaker B: I just wanted to plug it. I don't have anything to ask you about it, but I just wanted to plug it. No. Anything that we didn't. That we didn't cover, that you want to talk about?
00:48:18.336 - 00:48:46.708, Speaker A: No. I think the primary question on people's minds is one that you touched on earlier, which is, why aren't prices already at all time highs? There are all these systematic tailwinds. The Fed is moving to lower rates. Washington is embracing crypto. Billions of dollars are flowing into ETF's. Legislation is being passed on a bipartisan basis to support this industry. Why aren't we at all time highs? I think those are good questions to ask.
00:48:46.708 - 00:49:19.224, Speaker A: I think a lot of it has to do with uncertainty. There is still uncertainty around the election. Even if we think right now maybe it's a toss up and maybe the Harris campaign is looking to reset their position on crypto. So maybe we win in whatever happens. There's still uncertainty, and markets hate uncertainty. But I think as that uncertainty resolves, the setup for the second half of this year is better than any setup I've seen in crypto in the past, and I'm pretty excited about it.
00:49:19.332 - 00:49:57.926, Speaker B: Yeah, I've been full time in crypto for seven years and been around it for longer than that. I think this is the best and easiest setup that has, I've ever seen. Now, yes, watch bitcoin fall 50% and I'll eat those words, but I am knocking on a bunch of wood for listeners here. But, yeah, I don't know. It's pretty interesting. It's exciting and it's interesting. One last question that was going on in our slack channel the other day was, if there's so much buying, like, what are the actual mechanics? When I think you said a billion of flows into, into ETH, or whatever the actual number is, does that mean there's.
00:49:57.926 - 00:50:05.766, Speaker B: If ETH is not moving that much, does that mean there's a billion dollars of ETH that people are selling right now and that's why the market. That's why the market's not moving?
00:50:05.878 - 00:50:30.100, Speaker A: Yeah, that is right. That is right. And so for the last week, a lot of that has been coming out of Ethihe, the grayscale product. So that's people selling bitcoin or ETH from there and bitwise buying it on the other side of that spectrum. But again, Ethi will run out and demand for these ETF's, I don't think will. So there's an element of just patience. We will get there.
00:50:30.220 - 00:50:35.920, Speaker B: Can you explain to me why Grayscale is running the strategy that they're running?
00:50:36.820 - 00:51:14.632, Speaker A: I mean, you'll have to ask them. I will say that there's an old playbook from the ETF industry. As you know, I was in ETF's for 15 years before I was in crypto. And the position that grayscale finds itself in of having a high fee product and then a low fee market opening up is not new to crypto that's existed in ETF's before. And Grayscale is running the classic paybook, which is you maintain the high fee on one product and you launch a lower fee product. There just isn't a great answer for someone facing this dilemma. And this is sort of the classical approach.
00:51:14.632 - 00:51:24.780, Speaker A: So I know it seems odd to people who are watching it, but you have to put yourself in their shoes and ask yourself, what would you do? And it's a challenging question.
00:51:25.520 - 00:51:29.180, Speaker B: And so why wouldn't they just bring fees down to compete with you guys?
00:51:29.680 - 00:51:54.200, Speaker A: Well, their idea is they're competing with us with their mini ETH trust, which is priced competitively. And, you know, why wouldn't you slash your sponsorship fees by 90%? Right. So it's sort of the same. It's the same idea. It's just a challenging thing to do. And I commend them for doing a good job of bringing us into this ETF era.
00:51:54.320 - 00:52:04.900, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah. Matt, great job, man. I appreciate. I think the thing I love about bitwise is the industry basically has a team of. How many salespeople do you guys have?
00:52:04.980 - 00:52:06.652, Speaker A: We have 20 plus people in the field.
00:52:06.756 - 00:52:19.292, Speaker B: We got 20 plus the exec team. We've got 2030 people out there every day just pitching 20,000 investors on behalf of the industry. So I commend you guys, and I appreciate every day what you guys do.
00:52:19.396 - 00:52:21.228, Speaker A: Yeah, well, thank you. Same to you.
