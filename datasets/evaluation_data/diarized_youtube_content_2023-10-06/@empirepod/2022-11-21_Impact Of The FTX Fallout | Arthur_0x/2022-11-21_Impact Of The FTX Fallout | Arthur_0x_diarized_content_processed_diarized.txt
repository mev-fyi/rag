00:00:00.240 - 00:00:27.154, Speaker A: I think this is likely going to be the most complex liquidation or bankruptcy ever in the history due to the large number of creditors that were spread across different jurisdictions. I think FTX has more than 1 million creditors, and I believe they operate or have customers from more than 50 countries. So this is going to be very complex.
00:00:27.854 - 00:00:56.636, Speaker B: This episode is brought to you by circle, the issuer of USDC, which hopefully, as you all know, is the preferred stablecoin of digital natives and crypto natives with over 1.5 million holders globally. You'll hear more about USDC later in the show. All right, everyone, we're back with another episode of Empire. We've got Arthur from Defiance Capital. We got Santi joining, coming off a long flight, pumping full of espresso right now, 24 hours. We are happy to have Santi back with us.
00:00:56.636 - 00:00:59.564, Speaker B: We're pumped to have Arthur. So, Arthur, welcome to Empire, my friend.
00:00:59.864 - 00:01:01.040, Speaker A: Pleasure to be here.
00:01:01.192 - 00:01:22.432, Speaker B: Yeah, man, tough. Tough year, huh? Tough year. You obviously got impacted by some of the stuff going on back in, like, may of this year with three arrows and that whole debacle, and then this again, I know you're on the ground in Singapore, so I just want to ask, man, how are you doing? Has this been the toughest six months of your professional career?
00:01:22.608 - 00:01:50.354, Speaker A: Yes, definitely the toughest six months. Not just professional career. I think when it comes to adult life wise, definitely the toughest six months I have ever experienced. Yeah. And I think I was. I would say the event happened in June, prepared us very well in terms of crisis and risk management. So we were relatively unaffected by the whole FTX event.
00:01:50.354 - 00:02:06.760, Speaker A: But that cannot be said for a lot of my friends, not just in Singapore, but all over the crypto industry as well. A lot of them are badly hit and lost a huge chunk of their savings and portfolio, and it's just very sad to see.
00:02:06.872 - 00:02:33.334, Speaker C: Arthur, it seems like what I've seen, a lot of people in Singapore used FTX as an on and off ramp. And perhaps the people that I've heard and the companies that I've talked to, a lot of them, it feels like Singapore is one of the hardest hit areas, or at least the region is. Can you talk a little bit about, like, how FTX came to be so dominant there and people like, is there no other solution? Is just like. I'm curious to hear your perspective.
00:02:34.034 - 00:03:16.070, Speaker A: Yep. Thanks. That's a good question. So I think, first of all, a big. There's a big push factor coming from the fact that binance stopped serving Singapore users since last year, largely due to the fact that they withdraw their application for a crypto license in Singapore. And the Singapore Authority, Ms Monetary Authority of Singapore also put Binance on a list called the investor alert list, which means that they are not regulated. So that serves as a push factor for a lot of the users to start using FTX.
00:03:16.070 - 00:04:17.936, Speaker A: And for unknown reason, FTX is not listed there, although they are also based offshore and offered almost identical services to binance. I think. Yeah, and FTX have a very good, I would say for most prosumers have a very good user interface, very good liquidity, and you can also trade perpetual futures contract there. There are also local crypto exchanges available, but they are restricted to offering spot trading services only. So if you cannot access binance, FTX become the natural second choice. I think this also highlight a very classic econs 101 concept, the unintended consequences when the authority put binance on investor alert list but did not put FTX on it. That might seem as kind of like an implicit endorsement to FTX.
00:04:17.936 - 00:04:58.344, Speaker A: And I think this is also worsened by the fact that one of the sovereign wealth fund of Singapore, Temase, were actually the lead investor for one of the last three rounds of FTX. So I believe, according to Forbes, Temasek is one of the largest investors in FTX because they invested across all three rounds. That said, I don't think Temasek made a wrong investment at that point of time because it was a highly contested deals where a lot of the top vc are fighting to get into, and I'm sure they have done their due diligence. It's just unfortunate that happened. Yeah, it's a confluence of factors that lead to this.
00:04:59.004 - 00:05:03.504, Speaker C: Did you ever look at the deal at any point in time to invest in FTX?
00:05:04.644 - 00:05:35.804, Speaker A: I think I only look at the FTT deal when they were pitching to a lot of the crypto native at 2019. We passed because I wasn't convinced a new exchange is able to compete with the established one. But yeah, after that, we never saw the equity deal. I think they were focusing on the big institutional investor because I think they went very quickly to the 8 billion valuation round and I don't. I think that is already beyond most crypto native organizations appetite.
00:05:36.184 - 00:06:04.998, Speaker C: Yeah. What's your appreciation? There's obviously a lot of criticism now, like no one, no one's doing due diligence. You look at the sequoia memo, it sounds like, you know, now you laugh at it at the time. You know, as you said, people work heavily, like vying to have a lead position, get allocations in these rounds, obviously now people are very critical. No one's doing diligence. Can you talk a little bit about that? I'm curious if you believe that to be true. How do you manage your process? You talked about risk management earlier.
00:06:04.998 - 00:06:17.342, Speaker C: We can get to that in a second. But just pure due diligence for early stage investments, which I know you do, or just generally, how do you approach it? How do you not see these yellow flags, red flags?
00:06:17.478 - 00:07:21.364, Speaker A: I think we try our best to do the most due diligence, but I would say we definitely were affected by how fast the market were moving. I think from the Q four of 2021 onward until Q 220 22, we were doing five to seven deals a month, which were definitely above the intended number. But there are simply so many different ecosystem worth investing in and so many different verticals to look at. And obviously, that time, everyone was brimming with optimism. Web three is the future. There's so much potentials you just can't afford to miss out on the next OpenSea, the next axie infinity, the next uniswap. So if you are not restricting yourself to just one sector or one ecosystem, it simply becomes natural that you need to invest a bit more actively than, let's say, non crypto VC.
00:07:21.364 - 00:08:00.074, Speaker A: And I think that definitely lead to a slight, in some cases, pretty significant drop in the time and resources you devoted to due diligence. But I think this affected different investment firm to a different degree. For us. I think we still do a very thorough dd, but we definitely were not given sufficient time in some cases and everything we. I think that the pendulum swing from one, one extreme to another extreme. In a bear market, people become extremely skeptical, even from some teams that have kind of proven themselves to a certain extent. People still say, you know, these are all temporarily phenomenon.
00:08:00.074 - 00:08:18.264, Speaker A: It might not be sustainable. But in a bear market, in a bull market, even though there's nothing been proven, it's just pure concept. People think, you know, there's so much potential here. The team is great, you know, so I think that's what happened. But, yes, more generally speaking, less due diligence are being done in a bull market.
00:08:18.844 - 00:08:41.053, Speaker B: Arthur, I want to go back to why people used FTX, because my understanding is that they just had the tightest spreads for that prosumer institutional audience. It was a really good exchange, especially in Asia. Was there ever a concern that folks, was it just a known understanding that Alameda was picking off trades, but that was okay because. Because the spreads were so tight?
00:08:41.433 - 00:09:23.402, Speaker A: Not really. I think there was understanding that Alameda is one of the biggest market maker on FTX. But I think there were public statement that after the first year of FTX inception, Alameda is apparently no longer the biggest market maker anymore. I think I found it from some of the public interview or podcasts SBF have given. So I think the liquidity is great, but people never really think that it's only Alameda. There are probably a lot of other market maker, and when you see on the volume board, you see Vintalmu, you see falt Wang. So, yeah, I think one of the biggest innovation that FTX have done is the cross margin collateral.
00:09:23.402 - 00:09:46.334, Speaker A: And you can interchangeably use different stablecoins as a collateral and all the other random assets that will assign different collateral factors. I think that make it a lot more easier to manage your position, especially when you are running like a spread position where you are long, bitcoin, you are short. If essentially you, FTS is usually the best way to manage this kind of different position at the same account.
00:09:46.674 - 00:10:05.134, Speaker C: How are you guys using FTX? I mean, thankfully, it sounds like you guys were not largely unaffected, but I'm curious if you could give us a little bit more insight into what kind of products you were using and maybe how other funds used it as well.
00:10:05.694 - 00:10:39.498, Speaker A: I think we were mainly on the central exchange side. We were mainly using binance and FTX. But recent months, we have not been trading actively because we don't see there's much opportunity in the market. So we just took all of our money out from centralized exchange and put it into cold storage, actually, because we don't want to be over trading it because the market condition simply wasn't conducive. We also trade with some of the other OTC debts, like Galaxy or others. So, yeah, I think. I think that's how we manage it, I think.
00:10:39.498 - 00:10:40.402, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:10:40.578 - 00:11:28.954, Speaker C: How do you? You know, I still remember there are very specific moments in time where you, you know, you feel like this, you're going to survive survivability mode, like, at all costs, and you assess counterparty risk. You know, March 2020, right. Everyone was calling around desks to make sure that they're, like, solvent. Now, of course, everyone's looking around and asking, who's next? You got Voyager Blockfi, mostly retail. But then FTX, I think, was just huge. I'm curious, from a risk management standpoint, what do you see in the market? We had an earlier episode where the guys from framework were on at the time, it wasn't clear FTX was going to resume withdrawals. We didn't kind of know the extent of the mess of the shit show, actually.
00:11:28.954 - 00:11:49.714, Speaker C: But we were, I think, Jason, you and I have the opinion that it was going to be way larger of a contagion of an impact than perhaps Voyager or blockfi. Sounds to me like it still is. But I'm curious to get your perspective of how you think about contagion effects and how you think about, like, some of these, like, risks that the market may not be seeing or assessing.
00:11:50.014 - 00:12:35.240, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the two major category of market participants that are going to be impacted are quite well known by now. One is the remaining major lenders. I think we all know who they are. And another category are trading firms and market makers. I think that this will lead to a significant deterioration in liquidity, and a lot of the, I think probably this is less discussed. A lot of the startups that have tokens that have lent to market makers, they are in risk of not getting these tokens back, because if some of the market making firm are also going down, they are holding this token on their balance sheet. This becomes a liability to all the startups that have loaned them the token to market make.
00:12:35.240 - 00:12:53.878, Speaker A: I know for a fact that Alameda were providing market making services to a big number of crypto startups projects, and they are not paying back all these tokens that were borrowing to do market making. And that is a pretty big issue that will not discuss sufficiently in the market right now.
00:12:54.006 - 00:13:05.486, Speaker B: Arthur, can you just, can we dig deeper into that? Can you explain the actual mechanics? Let's say I'm a founder, I raise a round, Alameda leads it. I have a token. Can you just walk through the whole lifecycle of that?
00:13:05.670 - 00:13:57.048, Speaker A: Yeah. So usually when a project raised, assuming there's a token, and when a token is going to get listed, most of the time they will want to get a market maker to provide some sort of liquidity. You don't end up with a crazy environment where the token is listed, but there's so little liquidity and volume on the token. And Alameda were obviously one of the largest market maker and well known one, and they also approached a lot of the project to provide these services, especially for the project they have invested in. I don't think they force it, but it definitely helps that they are investing in so many projects and help to build the relationship. Even for some projects that they did not invest in, they still, these projects still engage Alameda as a market maker. So what happened is this project will sign an agreement, a market making agreement for the market, for Alameda to provide certain amount of liquidity.
00:13:57.048 - 00:14:12.166, Speaker A: And this project will usually loan this market maker a certain percentage of the token to market make. And sometimes it entails cash as well. And. Yeah, so this become like a loan from the project to the market making firm.
00:14:12.310 - 00:14:18.354, Speaker B: So I have, so if I have 10 million tokens outstanding, I'm going to give 20%?
00:14:19.214 - 00:14:31.074, Speaker A: No, not so much. Depends on the float. It's usually relative to the float. So if the float is only 5%, the project probably going to give 2% to the market making firm.
00:14:31.694 - 00:14:35.794, Speaker B: And I'm also going to pay some sort of fee, an annual fee or something.
00:14:36.174 - 00:15:03.548, Speaker A: There's a few different models. Yep, yep. There's some, usually there's a monthly retainer fee model. There is also some market making firm that doesn't take a fixed fee, but they want the team to sell them a cheap call option on a token. So let's say the token is trading at $2 right now. They want the team to sell them a call option that strike at $3 with like a two year expiry. So the market making firm will benefit from the upside.
00:15:03.548 - 00:15:08.504, Speaker A: And actually I think this become one of the biggest profit center for some market making firm.
00:15:10.164 - 00:15:30.384, Speaker B: Okay, so now walk me through to what happened. So now walk me through the Alameda's impact on some of these companies. Okay, so you give your tokens to Alameda. Now basically those tokens are sitting with Alameda, but they're not going to get those tokens back, right. So that just decreases the total float of the. That just decreases the token supply, right.
00:15:31.064 - 00:15:55.816, Speaker A: Temporarily, until the chapter eleven process find a way to liquidate those token. But this token technically belongs to the project, right. So it might lead to some project losing a big part of their treasury native token because this become an asset of Alameda. And I don't think they will recognize the liability with an offsetting method. So.
00:15:55.880 - 00:16:23.054, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's too bad. I just started to get investor updates from folks saying that they had 40% of their treasury held with FTX, 70% of their treasury. I mean, what of your portfolio? I mean, how many portfolio companies do you think end up getting killed by this, by FTX and Alameda, by their treasury getting cut in half? Right. A lot of companies just can't handle a treasury getting cut in half overnight. They're not set up for that.
00:16:23.214 - 00:16:45.206, Speaker A: Yeah. From the update we have received, there is less than five that were hit by FTX collapse. I think two of them have a sizable balance on it. The rest are fine. So I would say from our portfolio less than five, but there could be some other. They have not updated us yet. We also checked with most of them.
00:16:45.206 - 00:16:52.086, Speaker A: I would say more than half of them should be fine. We have tracked with more than half of our portfolio company. The rest, they haven't replied us yet.
00:16:52.270 - 00:17:10.754, Speaker B: And is that the same with funds, too? Would you say that it's a pretty small percentage of funds? Because I know the, you know, they're the multicoins of the world. The folks who are very close with FTX got hit pretty hard. Would you. Obviously, Hart goes out to Travis Kling, too, at Ekiguy. He got hit. E key guy got hit pretty hard. And Travis is an amazing dude.
00:17:10.754 - 00:17:17.744, Speaker B: Would you say it's a small percentage of funds, or would you say the percentage of funds that got really hit hard from this is actually higher?
00:17:18.444 - 00:17:56.892, Speaker A: I think the percentage is not high if you include venture fund in the whole landscape, because venture fund by nature do not need to keep a lot of money on FTX. And given most of the new fund raised over the past twelve to 24 months are venture funds. I don't think those venture funds are that badly hit by FTX, but the liquid fund are definitely hit, especially for those that run an active arbitrage and delta neutral strategy. These category of funds are the ones that are most likely to be hit by FTX collapse because they're keeping all.
00:17:56.908 - 00:17:59.876, Speaker B: Of their capital on exchange by the.
00:17:59.900 - 00:18:01.796, Speaker A: Virtue of their strategy. They need to.
00:18:01.940 - 00:18:05.504, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a real shame. It's too bad.
00:18:06.924 - 00:18:31.236, Speaker C: There's talk about now. I think there's. Was it Ken Griffin from Citadel coming out and saying, hey, guys, like, look at traditional finance. All this could have been avoided. You know, you don't have the exchange acting as a custodian. Like, those functions are always separate in large. Separated in large part because of, you know, learnings from the past, you know, burning Madoff kind of situations.
00:18:31.236 - 00:19:28.190, Speaker C: And so now there are rules and regulations around that. Do you find it? We talk a lot about regulation, obviously. Now, I do want to get into this topic of how you feel that. What is the regulatory kind of implications of all of this? But from your perspective on the risk management side of things, did you ever find that alarming? Did you ever conceive that someone like FTX could go under or commingle funds? Like, you know, there weren't ever proof of reserves? All of this is, like, now obvious, right? For everyone. It's like, well, holy shit. Like, yeah, maybe we all should have been a little bit more demanding of all these things, but we weren't like. And then everything now comes to light, right? There's now reports of all the partying, all the, you know, all the stuff going down in Bermuda.
00:19:28.190 - 00:20:04.034, Speaker C: But, like, I'm just curious. Like, there were multiple conferences in Bermuda. There were multiple people that, like, took, like. Like, that traditional fund manager Anthony's was car mooch, like, Skybridge, who, like, took money from, like, Sam was doling out money to, like, most venture funds. Like, why. Why is it that, like, all this stuff came to light? Did you, like, ever suspect that, like, there was shady shit going down on FTX? I'll give you my side of the story, but, like, I'm curious if, like, if at any point in time you thought, like, hmm, maybe it's too good to be true, or these guys just up to no good. I'm curious.
00:20:04.414 - 00:20:48.448, Speaker A: I definitely don't see the scale of this fraud, because I think what I have always been a bit more wary is how FTX or Sam like to create new Solana ecosystem coin with a very high FDv but low float. I think serum fully diluted valuation at one point is 100 billion, which is ridiculous. And they have a very long vesting. So all these things is very predatory. But you can say this is, like, a bad business practice. It's not fraud. So I think, yeah, I don't think I would have expected them to commingle user funds, because without doing that, they are supposedly very profitable.
00:20:48.448 - 00:20:54.544, Speaker A: So we were probably thinking of, like, a bad business practice, but not to a level of fraud.
00:20:55.204 - 00:20:59.284, Speaker B: Santi, you say. You said you have some stories. Maybe I have one story.
00:20:59.324 - 00:21:18.916, Speaker C: Yeah. Like, I was in Singapore. Well, on my way to Singapore to the first binance conference in January of 2019. And this is, like, pretty was a bear market. This actually marked the bottom of, like, certain coins, like, SNX, which Arthur, you're intimately familiar with. But on the way there, I stopped in Hong Kong, and I. And I went into the small office of Alameda, and.
00:21:18.916 - 00:21:33.676, Speaker C: And Sam was there in his little beanbag. And it was, like, a very small operation. He was getting, like, a couple of chairs, and he was, like, staffing. He was like. And. And in that conversation, we talked about two things. One, what Alameda was, because for me, it was a surprise.
00:21:33.676 - 00:22:05.542, Speaker C: I had no idea what Alameda research was. I'm like. And then there were, like, rumblings that it was, like, handling the largest, like, like, volume of, like, bitcoin or this kimchi trade, and. But it was like, it was. Came to a surprise to me. And then he talked about the opportunity to potentially invest in Alameda and the terms of that. And I found, to me, that was, like, I didn't end up investing in Alameda because the terms I thought were, like, ridiculous, like, worse than rentech, and, like, everyone wants to get into rentech.
00:22:05.542 - 00:22:08.350, Speaker C: And I was like, how is this possible? Like, it makes sense.
00:22:08.462 - 00:22:09.254, Speaker B: What were the terms?
00:22:09.334 - 00:22:12.768, Speaker C: If I remember correctly, it was, like, guaranteeing, like, a 15% return.
00:22:12.926 - 00:22:15.500, Speaker B: Oh, was this the high return, the 15%?
00:22:15.572 - 00:22:38.970, Speaker C: Yes, this was. There have been other chats circulating of what seems to be a deleted user, which allegedly is sue. Sue of a telegram group, crypto fundamentals. Anyways, and. And there was, like, chat about that. I think it. He probably saw or people saw the same deck, but I found it to be, I don't know, my spidey kind of sentence went off.
00:22:38.970 - 00:23:06.082, Speaker C: And most importantly for me, it was like, the level of the operation was, like, concerning. There was just, like, they were moving very fast. Six months later, the second thing that he talked about in that, in that meeting was, like, last an hour, was that he wanted to build an exchange. And that's. That's the end of what I heard. Six months later, someone says me a link is like, go to FTX. I'm like, holy shit, these guys move really fast.
00:23:06.082 - 00:23:40.884, Speaker C: But in that meeting, I thought, like, I don't know. I come from traditional finance background. Like, when we built paraphy, like, there's some processes that you need to have. There's some, like, walls that you need to have, like, and I've always felt that, like, even though if crypto is, like, not as regulator or whatever, you just need to assume that there's a level to your point, Arthur, of, like, operating in business practices, especially if you're as a fund or just operating in, like, finance, that you need to abide by, because it's just the right thing to do. And I felt that that was not. I think they ended up firing this particular person. That, to me, was just like, it was pretty shady.
00:23:40.884 - 00:23:45.544, Speaker C: And I was like, yeah, no, I don't know. I'd rather not. That was my story.
00:23:46.324 - 00:24:20.558, Speaker B: Let me ask both of you guys this, because this is something I'm still trying to think through, is at what point, like, basically, did Sam build. So, obviously, Sam, I think, built Alameda with good intentions to build a huge trading firm. Like, I think he's. He was not like, a scammer that I'm basically trying to wonder what. At what point in the story does Sam become a malicious actor, basically. So I think some people think that everything was going fine until Alameda got on the wrong side of a bunch of big trades during the whole, like, terra Luna, three arrows, Celsius, blow up, all that stuff. And then he used customer funds from FTX to plug the hole.
00:24:20.558 - 00:24:50.158, Speaker B: Maybe it was that. Maybe it wasn't even his fault, and that it was Sam Trabuco wanted to, like, got on the wrong side of the trades, and Sam was like, oh, shit, let's move the funds over. But then when the backdoor thing came out, the, like, backdoor system to get to avoid the compliance inside of FTX, that made me think that, oh, this is a whole. This has been going on for years. So, Arthur, I'm just curious, like, when did Sam start becoming a bet? Was this all set up with malicious intent, do you think?
00:24:50.286 - 00:25:42.732, Speaker A: I think the problem is Sam likely used his effective altruism principle as an excuse to justify whatever action he is doing after a certain time period. When you look at it, like, the whole low float, high fdv stuff was not good, but he was very aggressive in pursuing this. That was in 2020 or 2021, early 2021. He clearly did not feel there's anything wrong with this, and by having essentially no firewall between Alameda and FTX, he clearly did not think there's an issue. So. And I think at one point, where he was just idolized at this extent, you just don't think you can do anything wrong. Like, whatever you do, you think you can cover it up and you can self justify it.
00:25:42.732 - 00:26:32.214, Speaker A: And there's also, like, a rumors that he was tricking, he was taking on some drugs as well. Like, he was a golden boy. It was very well received in the political circle, Congress appearance on a hearing. This is a treatment that not even some bitcoin or crypto oG like Brian Armstrong were receiving, and he was getting it in such a short amount of time and rubbing shoulders with the leading athlete like Tom Brady, Steph Curry, I think that just lead him to think that he can't do wrong. And I think people can even lie to themselves at one point of time. And I think this is also quite similar to other firm that got very big in a short amount of time, like three arrows or even celsius. Like, why they were still lying until the last minute.
00:26:32.214 - 00:26:50.254, Speaker A: Because they think that, you know, it's fine. I I'm so successful, you know, whatever I do can be justified. So I think that's essentially what happened, and I think it's a, it's a slippery, slippery slope once you start doing something, or if it's small, you kind of don't think anything matters anymore.
00:26:51.314 - 00:27:11.378, Speaker C: The only thing I'll add to that is I do agree with a lot of what you said, arthur. The only thing that I'm now a little bit perplexed by is this facade of effective altruism, because, you know, as we know, he's trying to sell a $38.5 million penthouse, which belongs to, I guess, all of us. But I am very, you know, you.
00:27:11.386 - 00:27:11.874, Speaker B: Know what I mean?
00:27:11.954 - 00:27:21.370, Speaker C: It sounds to me like there's a big facade of effective of his reasons to doing stuff. So it's like, I think it's all.
00:27:21.402 - 00:28:01.864, Speaker B: I think it's. I think this has been going on for years. I think the story that everyone talks about with the arbitrage trade in 2017, whenever someone who works in media, whenever you hear a story over and over and over again, that is on purpose, that's not by accident. Why did you hear that story? Why have we heard that story so much? It's because Sam wanted us to all think that they were a market making firm, a market neutral firm, not a directional fund. We all, he wanted all of us to think that Alameda was this, like, market making firm. They didn't take directional bets, whereas really, when that Ian Allison coindesk story came out, I mean, their portfolio was like my friend's Degen retail portfolio, like, it wasn't a good portfolio.
00:28:02.514 - 00:28:42.580, Speaker C: Let me ask you guys a question. The one that I'm thinking about here is CZ, because he, I think has, he was a big investor. He had a huge bag of FTT, and I think he, he has access to, you know, perhaps anyone as connected as anyone in this industry. And, you know, he laid the hammer at some point, he had up to a value of, what, 500 million of FTT tokens. Why? Why did you wait until now? Because if this stuff had been going on for, we'll know exactly when all this stuff could start to happen. But as soon as you start getting into trouble, I tend to think this is a whole, this is the end of the, the Luna kind of fiasco. Like, everyone just got into really bad mess, plugging holes.
00:28:42.580 - 00:29:08.454, Speaker C: But this has been going on for when Luna start, like, March, April, like, you know, six months ago. Why didn't you do it then? And presumably, if you knew about all this stuff and Alameda was, like, coming with stuff, I got to think that, like, it's kind of hard to, like, I think, hide this. If it had been going on for a long time, like, why, why just wait until now? Why not do it a year ago, two years ago.
00:29:10.594 - 00:30:10.114, Speaker A: I don't think CZ actually know that FTX was commingling user fund and were actually stealing from customers money to fund all these ridiculous purchases or crazy investment. I think he just sensed that it doesn't seem right where Alameda's balance sheet is so fragile. And essentially what we understand is Binance lab. They rarely sell any investment, which is why they write off the entire Luna investment. Because Binance was just making so much money, they don't really bother to exit most of their investment. They might have done some, but from what we heard and collaborated by multiple sources in the industry, Binance lab is a fairly long term investor, generally speaking, and CZ and Binance is clearly not in need of money. They probably didn't bother and that kind of give them a little bit of leverage against FTX and Sam if they sell it or then they lose that leverage.
00:30:10.114 - 00:30:47.464, Speaker A: So. But yeah, it just happened that their balance sheet is a lot more fragile than everyone have expected, including CZ. I don't think it's positive for CZ to kill a competitor. I don't think he expected this level of fraud to happen as well. And actually, just to bring back to the previous point a little bit, I think people might have forgotten, but one of the fact that gave a lot of legitimacy to Alameda was the fact that they have two accounts on the Bitmax leaderboard, p and L leaderboard. So people kind of think that they were actually good traders and profitable traders.
00:30:49.004 - 00:31:28.594, Speaker B: Alright everyone, time for a quick word from Circle and USDC. As a crypto user, you know the power of stablecoins, dollar digital currencies that transcend borders, banking hours, and legacy financial rails. While Circle's USDC has quickly become one of the most trusted and widely used stablecoins, it's simple. People use USDC because of its composability, its stability and its reserve transparency. And USDC isn't just adopted by a few of us. Defi degens and DAos and NFT marketplaces, crypto companies alike. They all leverage USDC to diversify their treasury, asset management and ecosystem wide composability.
00:31:28.594 - 00:32:08.634, Speaker B: The adoption is clear. USDC has grown to more than $50 billion in circulation since launching in 2018. We all have, and we all will continue to take shots on our favorite volatile crypto assets, obviously. But USDC is one of the easiest ways to store your funds in a stable asset that can be used to send value around the world almost instantly. It lowers the cost of cross border payments, it integrates into the growing ecosystem of crypto apps. As a seamless, trusted dollar digital currency, USDC is a zero to one opportunity for the financial system. If you want to learn more about USDC, I would recommend you check out their recently published transparency hub on Circle.com.
00:32:08.634 - 00:32:36.298, Speaker B: It's a great update to Circle's content on USDC. It outlines everything from links to their weekly reserve reports, monthly attestations, blog posts that are written by their exec team that highlight how and why USDC was built the way it is. Really recommend it. Just go to Circle.com transparency to access it. Now, let's get back to the show. Well, I would say that they were actually good traders, and profitable traders actually, for a long time.
00:32:36.298 - 00:33:12.506, Speaker B: I don't think you can argue against that. It's just that there's only so large that you can build a success. A market neutral firm in crypto can only get so big, it can only scale as the size of crypto scales. And they want it to go bigger. When you want to go bigger, you have to leave behind the market neutral strategy and take these long only strategies, which actually, Arthur, leads me into the next thing I wanted to ask you about, which is you brought up these low float, high fdv strategies that they would deploy a lot. Mentioned the of Solana ecosystem a couple times. Can you just share kind of what they were doing with the Solana ecosystem and that'll lead into I want to get your take on just Solana and where things go.
00:33:12.506 - 00:33:31.290, Speaker B: But like, you know, that's some pretty shady practices going on with the Solana ecosystem and kind of bundling different protocol tokens, selling them at discounts, propping up things, even venture investing and then basically killing protocols that they had even invested in. Can you just share some, some of the things that they were doing in that ecosystem?
00:33:31.442 - 00:34:34.320, Speaker A: I think they were essentially the first big organization they were building on Solana. They built serum, which is still the foundational liquidity platform of many DeFi apps on Solana. They were integrated with, in fact, which is why right now the community is trying to fork serum right now, because the admin key of serum apparently is held by one FTX employee, which we do not know who is he or she. And they also build Bonfida oxygen and a couple of others. Obviously, most of these are like, have very low traction and usage, but they were definitely the first group of builders, and they ship very quickly. Like at that time, it's very hard to build on Solana because a lot of the documentation not clear, it was not very developer friendly, but they were able to overcome this and ship serum very quickly. And I think that's kind of the major influence they had there.
00:34:34.320 - 00:35:03.403, Speaker A: And how they marketed these projects to the investor are the nefarious one. Like the. Basically, if you get in earlier, you get a lower price. They just keep increasing the price every day. And there was always, like, a very formal kind of effect to get people to contribute money as quick as possible. And obviously, I think there was some leak on the telegram, actually, I know the person directly. He was working for Sam back then, and a lot of the practice was questionable.
00:35:04.303 - 00:35:08.603, Speaker B: What do you think the longer term impact is here on the Solana ecosystem?
00:35:10.703 - 00:36:00.094, Speaker A: I think Solana is going through a very challenging period that, in a way similar to the challenge Ethereum community faced from 2018 to 2019, where the ICO bubble burst and turned out that there isn't much useful stuff that has been built except for fundraising tools and speculation and a lot of the failed projects. Same is going to happen to the Solana ecosystem and the community. And the ecosystem will need a long time to recover from this. But that doesn't mean that what they were building, their technical, architectural direction, is wrong, but the community and balance sheet, the participants, the trust, will take some time, or probably a long time to be repaired.
00:36:00.214 - 00:36:06.714, Speaker B: Yeah. So you think Solana is a strong enough ecosystem at this point to weather the storm?
00:36:08.434 - 00:36:25.574, Speaker A: I think it's tough to say. But if you want to ask me, I think, yes, they should be able to survive this storm, but will they be able to exceed their previous all time high in terms of user activity and market cap? I can't say for sure.
00:36:26.154 - 00:36:30.054, Speaker B: Sante, what do you think about that Solana ecosystem next couple years?
00:36:31.234 - 00:37:03.228, Speaker C: I agree with Arthur. I know a lot of the guys, we've had them on the episode. Um, I genuinely think that there are a lot of good builders in Solana, and I think I. I do. I sympathize in part with the team because they've taken it to the chin over and over and over, and I think, uh, it's just circumstances. And, um, I think they're going through a tough time, but they've built. They seem to be very resilient.
00:37:03.228 - 00:37:45.884, Speaker C: And one of the things that I like about Solana is they're not afraid to. To me, a lot of the other kind of competing l one s, I don't think Solana wants to be or is doing things to suggest that they just purely want to, like, be an ETH killer. And I think the biggest testament to that is, like, their vision of like launching the phone. So I think, like, I like that kind of thinking. It's a bit more bold, it's a bit more out there. But yeah, they've had a very difficult year and, and so, you know, they've, I think, come out and like, have tried to document as much as possible. They have a tweet, an ongoing like, like, port like website where they're trying to document and piece everything together.
00:37:45.884 - 00:38:34.234, Speaker C: So we'll keep monitoring the situation, but I do think it bounces back over time and, and they'll come out of it stronger. Probably it will take time to rebuild trust. But to be fair, like, I guess the. Just to talk about the elephant in the room, to me it feels like one of the more criticized things about all this stuff is they're like, the fact that they sold, like, what is it, six to 8% of all the tokens to Sam, to FTX or whatever, you know, it was a tough. I don't like particularly, I don't know all the details around that, but I'm curious to get you guys's thoughts on that. Like, that. That to me is like they, they've done other transactions, protocols, have done these type of OTC deals.
00:38:34.234 - 00:38:44.722, Speaker C: I'm not like, as cons, like, I'm not overly critical about that. It's a huge percentage of the token supply, but I'm not like, I don't think that will kill them, if you know what I mean.
00:38:44.858 - 00:39:39.558, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that will create a lot of selling pressure over the next twelve months because we do not know what will the bankruptcy estate do with the Solana token on Alameda's balance sheet. They might sell it via auctions or just sell it via OTC desk. I think that's the near term challenges. I think in hindsight you probably should not sell such a high percentage to one entity. But you cannot ignore the fact that FTX and Alameda were one of the biggest supporters of Solana back then. And they are the first exchange to integrate Solana chain to list all the SPL token and were essentially building on top of Solana. So I would say a lot of the early stage success of Solana can be attributed to how much resources FTX devoted to supporting them.
00:39:39.706 - 00:39:40.462, Speaker C: Absolutely.
00:39:40.598 - 00:40:16.714, Speaker B: Yeah. By the way, Santiago, I pinged Anatoly. We have Anatoly and Ben coming on the show in two weeks, so we will dig more into it then. Arthur, I wanted to pivot and talk a little bit about the liquidation process, if you're comfortable talking about that. I know you probably either don't want to or can't talk about sue and Kyle too much here, but can you just. For folks who don't know your background, can you give a little bit of the background and how you got impacted a couple months ago by things and just to kind of set up the conversation for the liquidation process again, I don't know how much you're able to talk about things, but, yeah, we.
00:40:16.874 - 00:41:00.242, Speaker A: I mean, in our public statement, we did mention that we were materially impacted, and it is an ongoing process to sort out the situation. And, yeah, I can't comment much on the detail because there's a legal proceeding ongoing, but we are still communicating actively with the liquidator to sort out the situation. So it was unfortunate that we did not set up our fund in the best way at the beginning. Definitely one of the most expensive lesson ever, and I hope I do not need to pay for the same lesson again. But, yeah, so right now we are moving forward trying to resolve these situations, but, yeah.
00:41:00.298 - 00:41:06.854, Speaker B: Can you share that? Can you share the learning there so that other people don't make the same expensive mistake? Or what was the mistake there?
00:41:07.154 - 00:41:43.484, Speaker A: I think this is not like a very new learning. It's just that when things goes well, nobody really refer to what is written in the legal contract, and a lot of people think they don't need to consult lawyers on many important advice. I mean, look at what Sam tweeted. Right. That was clearly would not be advised by lawyers, but turn out that when shit hits the fence, people will go back to refer to contract on a word by word basis. So, yeah, it's just very important to get legal advice on important matter that have big ramifications. Yeah.
00:41:43.484 - 00:42:10.494, Speaker A: And trust don't. I would say people say don't trust, but verify, but I would say you trust, but you verify. So I guess that's counted the challenge here. And people do change over time and sometimes for the worse. And, yeah, it's just something that, you know, you need. You need to be mindful of, you know, people might not be the same person that if you have known them in the beginning.
00:42:11.754 - 00:42:22.304, Speaker B: How do you think that these liquidation processes play out here with, with FTX? And what do you kind of, when you look at what's happening? Like, what are you looking at? Like, you looking at what liquidator?
00:42:22.804 - 00:43:06.704, Speaker A: Yeah, I think this is likely going to be the most complex liquidation or bankruptcy ever in the history due to the large number of creditors that were spread across different jurisdiction. I think FTX has more than 1 million creditors, and I believe they operate or have customers from more than 50 countries. So this is going to be very complex. And right now it's not in liquidation yet. It's actually in chapter eleven. There is a slim chance that the business can restructure, pay off, struct a deal with the creditor and continue to operate, although I will not bank on it. And I think the brand is so tarnished that it's not possible anymore.
00:43:06.704 - 00:44:08.750, Speaker A: But yeah, it's going to be so complex. Like, just to give you an example, just for three arrows, the counterparties are probably in the hundreds, low hundreds, and they gotten recognition on US court and Singapore court. But imagine, when it comes to FTX, how much court recognition they need to get around the world, because how wide the user base is. And I'm not a lawyer, but it's also questionable that. Why is FTX filing for chapter eleven, including the international? Because when you read the terms and conditions, FTX trading, which is the one we interact with, is the anti Gua entity, and FTX digital market is headquartered in Bahamas. So by administering this in us, you are basically skipping the jurisdiction of Bahamas and Antigua. I know they are small countries, but BVI and Cayman is a small country as well.
00:44:08.750 - 00:44:37.874, Speaker A: They still administer some degradation case as well. So, yeah, this is going to be so complex, they will need to get, I would say, at least five to ten major countries or jurisdictions called to acknowledge this liquidation before they can enforce a lot of the things they want or subpoena a lot of the counterparties that are not based inside us. Even this alone, I think, will take six to twelve months. Yeah. And. Yeah, it's just going to be so complicated.
00:44:38.334 - 00:44:47.686, Speaker B: Yeah, I want to pivot to Arthur. Can you talk about what you're working on next? Or. I don't know if you can talk about.
00:44:47.830 - 00:44:49.598, Speaker A: No, I can talk about it. Yes.
00:44:49.726 - 00:44:52.394, Speaker B: Okay. Okay. So you're raising a fund now? Yeah.
00:44:52.774 - 00:44:53.554, Speaker A: Yes.
00:44:54.694 - 00:45:27.354, Speaker B: I'm curious. I have a couple questions just on, like, your crypto thesis moving forward. One is, what is the impact that this does on token deals? Because token deals died after the 2017 bull market. Or like, okay, icos are dead, no more token deals. We don't need tokens. And then this recent market tokens were back and it was like, oh, tokens make sense if they're structured the right way and if they're attached to a DeFi protocol that does really well. But again, now we're a year into the bear market, and people are like, tokens don't make sense.
00:45:27.354 - 00:45:32.574, Speaker B: You need to invest in the equity of the company. So I'm just curious how you think about doing token deals moving forward.
00:45:33.074 - 00:46:11.004, Speaker A: I think right now it almost becomes a universal standard to bundle a token deal together with equity. I think there's a few reasons behind it. It's mainly due to us regulation. SAF contract went out of fashion. So most of the venture deal are done in a way that you invest in the equity and you get a token warrant. So if the project decided to launch a token in future, you will also get a token on a pro rata basis. And I think this also gives the investor more protection when it comes to governance, because when you own equity, you actually have a voting right and you can also be elected to sit on the board.
00:46:11.004 - 00:46:18.408, Speaker A: Yeah. Obviously it's very interesting that FTX doesn't have a board of directors, but. Okay, let's move forward.
00:46:18.496 - 00:46:24.904, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, hopefully the impact of this is that people end up doing more due diligence on companies and put in place boards. Yeah, yeah.
00:46:24.984 - 00:46:41.164, Speaker A: So I think it's not for the. I think that, yes, pure token deal will go out of fashion unless the project and team are built up since the beginning in a very decentralized manner. Yeah, I believe majority of the deals going forward will continue to be an equity plus token warranty.
00:46:41.544 - 00:47:06.184, Speaker B: Yeah. Do you. I know Santee plays very heavily in the private markets, but at this point, the public markets are just getting so attractive. I would say in crypto, what percentage of the fund will be public versus private? And Sante, I'd throw the same question to you. How are you thinking about public versus private? Arthur, I'll throw it to you first, but how are you thinking about just doing investing in the private markets versus the public markets in crypto?
00:47:07.044 - 00:47:44.300, Speaker A: Our new fund will be 100% focused on the liquid side of the market. We call it a liquid venture fund. Doesn't mean that we are going to be trading it on a very frequent basis. But I think that there's just so much opportunity in the space, in the liquid side that it's worth to devote 100% focus and attention on the liquid side. And I think from a risk management point of view, a liquid fund can better manage the market risks better than the venture fund. Look at, again, sorry to keep using FTX as an example, but investor 200 million whole thing unravel in one week. There's just no way you can manage the risk.
00:47:44.300 - 00:48:34.854, Speaker A: I think people are fine because you sign up for a venture deal, but I think that if you are given a similar risk return profile and you can actually also manage the risk I would think this offer a superior risk adjusted return. I also get a venture return profile, like probably like a five x or ten x in three, five years. But if the fundamental do change or the macro condition change, I'm able to change my mind. And also I do not need to compete in a very crowded primary market because the fact is, for some very high profile and highly contested deal, most investors, unless you are the top five funds, you will not be able to get your desired allocation. But when we in the liquid market, we can determine on the exact amount of position we want, subject to liquidity constraint.
00:48:35.314 - 00:49:33.364, Speaker C: Yeah, well, it's interesting, I was looking at FTT. It's trading at like 600 million fully diluted valuations still. So markets are definitely not rational. But what that is telling you is it's sort of trading at, you know, roughly 2% last round, 32 billion. Right. Arthur, I guess your point is, had you held FTT versus FTX equity, like this discussion, like intellectual, like this exercise has come up again and again, like, would you rather own, and I've done it a number of times in the past, like, would I have rather owned FTT or FTX equity? I guess what you're saying, which I agree with, is in this case, it would have been better to have FTT because you would have pocketed some cents on the dollar and could have managed risk much better if you're actively trading now, most VC's are not active traders. Right.
00:49:33.364 - 00:49:56.958, Speaker C: But still, as a crypto venture investor, I've learned the hard way and over time that you need to have a strategy and become smarter on risk management and managing a position when it's liquid because you have a number and it grows. I remember investing in Defi early on. You need to manage risk that you can't, you, you can't be a crypto manager and say, oh, I'm not going.
00:49:56.966 - 00:49:57.550, Speaker A: To look at this stuff.
00:49:57.582 - 00:50:36.548, Speaker C: It's like, no, wait a minute. If a position grows beyond 20% of your book, you have a, almost, I was going, I'm going to, you have kind of a responsibility to manage risk. And so, yeah, I don't know, like, I don't have any interest in raising a fund, but I am doing other stuff. But I will say angel, only something, two things. If I were thinking about raising a fund right now, I would probably raise like a, what CZ is doing, like a distress fund, picking up pennies on the dollar. A lot of people are going to have to for sale. We haven't talked about contagion.
00:50:36.548 - 00:51:08.706, Speaker C: Let's talk about if the bankruptcy process lasts six years. I mean, look at Mancox. Let's just assume six years and your typical duration of your capital is a year, maybe three. Well, there's going to be. That mismatch allows for opportunities to buy folks out. So there's probably going to be a huge amount of opportunities to do this type of strategy, I think distress deals. But the other thing is, if I were not doing that, I tend to agree with Arthur.
00:51:08.706 - 00:51:58.454, Speaker C: I think there's a lot of opportunities in doing the work in the public side of things, and it has been very easy the last cycle. I think it just started to feel over the top, where there was just a huge amount of capital on the private side. These deals are being chased up and propped up like you, to your point, Arthur, deals were going from 20 million, like, fully diluted valuation to 100 to a billion. You were like, how is this happening? Meanwhile, you have projects like trading out, like, below their seed round valuation with a lot of traction and visible on chain. And so I find the public markets pretty compelling. Now, do I think that you were getting paid enough right now for the level of risk that you were taking? Probably not. Like, I don't generally think that, like, defi yields are very low.
00:51:58.454 - 00:52:09.734, Speaker C: At some point it would be really interesting to bid, but I don't know. I don't. I don't feel that we're there yet. I think.
00:52:10.234 - 00:52:10.570, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:52:10.602 - 00:52:15.614, Speaker B: Are you a buyer at these. At these prices? You agree with Santi that we're not there yet or you're a buyer at these prices?
00:52:18.174 - 00:52:33.874, Speaker A: I think it's very project specific. Depends on what sector and what project you are looking at. I don't like to generalize. I think something for some asset I would be a buyer, but for some, I'm definitely not buying here yet.
00:52:35.294 - 00:53:04.234, Speaker C: The majors seem to me fairly app ETH is a very clean bet. None of this is financial. Absent that, like, I don't know. What I'm worried about is time and time again we felt that, like, we've resolved and figured out, okay, we kind of, like, are starting to get a feeling of contagion and. And then another big blow up happens and I just don't know how long. And I don't have good visibility into the second 3rd order effects of all this stuff will be. And so.
00:53:04.234 - 00:53:29.294, Speaker C: Yeah, but, you know, again, if you're a long term holder, if you have a long term horizon, I think you start seeing good opportunities and windows regardless. Arthur, you said something which I think is very true when you were talking about if you use FTX and you said you moved a lot of stuff off chain because it's a very difficult market and I think it will continue to be really difficult even though we saw a decent CPI print.
00:53:30.674 - 00:53:38.734, Speaker B: Arthur, I know it's late out in Singapore right now. Anything else that we've missed that we haven't talked about that you think is really important or just any last words that you want to share here?
00:53:40.494 - 00:54:34.604, Speaker A: Yeah, I think this is probably one of the biggest takeaway due to the nature of the industry. We just keep giving more opportunity for the bad actor. They are willing to take shortcut to rise to the top a lot quicker than the people they are trying to do it the right way and trying to do the right stuff. I think the ratio of good to bad people, I mean, obviously that's simplistic way of looking at things are probably not that different compared to other like traditional finance industry. It's just that in our industry it's a lot easier for the guys that are willing to take shortcuts to rise to the top. And I think collectively we probably need to figure out what are there any effective way we can mitigate this.
00:54:36.624 - 00:54:36.936, Speaker B: So.
00:54:36.960 - 00:55:24.060, Speaker A: That there are some effective check and balances in place so that the bad actors do get stopped earlier on or actually are not possible for them to commit such huge level of fraud. With FTX going down, binance is going to be the largest player in the market. Like I said in the past, just now I think Czech, he's playing a long game. He's not going to do anything stupid. But that's not count of reassurance we want, right? Like are there other effective check and balances and when you look at, you know, the two guys trying to make a comeback, capitalizing on these opportunities and they are still getting a lot of attention. Yeah. Apparently this space have a very short memories and I'm not sure what, how.
00:55:24.060 - 00:55:42.034, Speaker A: Beside a very strict regulation that will almost definitely kill a lot of the innovation and how this space can operate in future. I don't have a good answer on how we can solve this issue yet. How do we stop the bad actor from getting too big?
00:55:42.854 - 00:55:51.280, Speaker B: When you figure that out, let me know, because it's not just crypto. By the way, Bernie Madoff, this happens in traditional capital markets too.
00:55:51.462 - 00:55:51.892, Speaker A: Yep.
00:55:51.948 - 00:56:01.424, Speaker B: Anyways, Arthur, this has been an amazing conversation. I appreciate you coming on man. I appreciate you recording this late at night out in Singapore in such a crazy week. Means a lot that you took an hour out of your day to do this.
00:56:02.164 - 00:56:03.924, Speaker A: Yep. No problem. It's my pleasure to be here.
