00:00:52.574 - 00:00:58.894, Speaker B: All right, everyone, welcome back to Empire. We've got Sam Hart, and I was gonna say Ethan Buckman. Bucky. You're going by Bucky these days, Ethan.
00:00:59.054 - 00:00:59.726, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:00:59.870 - 00:01:10.230, Speaker B: Nice, nice. For those who don't know, Sam is the head of products and strategy at Skip, also the founder of Time Wave, and Ethan Buckman does a whole bunch of stuff in and around Cosmos. So, guys, welcome to the show.
00:01:10.342 - 00:01:10.886, Speaker D: Great to be here.
00:01:10.910 - 00:01:11.914, Speaker C: Thanks for having us.
00:01:12.294 - 00:01:17.582, Speaker B: Yeah, of course. We were just talking about this before we hit record. One of our most listened to episodes.
00:01:17.758 - 00:01:19.886, Speaker A: Actually, ever was a Cosmos related episode.
00:01:19.910 - 00:01:57.204, Speaker B: With Jack and Zaki, back maybe six to twelve months ago, and so wanted to kind of revisit the cosmos thesis. When I think about Cosmos, you guys have nailed it with the app chain thesis. Unfortunately, though, it seems like the app chain thesis is playing out not on Cosmos, at least. When I look at the industry, it seems like some of that activity is happening on ETH L two s. I would love to. Maybe, Sam, you could kick us off with this idea of the app chain thesis as you see it and how that has evolved, as maybe it's happening, not as much on Cosmos, or maybe I'm just wrong there. So maybe lead us in here.
00:01:58.424 - 00:03:06.430, Speaker E: Yeah, so I think of Cosmos is kind of like late game technology. It's basically some degree of vertical integration within the application. And when the application ends up owning its own stack and from the consensus level all the way up to the interface, then you end up needing some form of interoperability between different applications. So, yeah, we built the app chain stack kind of in reverse of what Ethereum is doing. But for that reason, I think we actually have a number of primitives that are really fit for purpose. And really, over the next few months, I think you're going to see some very interesting stuff as some of the really unique applications come online. Celestia and Duidx, I think, are an early indicator of some of the very cool stuff that's coming.
00:03:06.622 - 00:03:09.446, Speaker F: Yeah, I think the app chain thesis.
00:03:09.470 - 00:04:06.980, Speaker C: Is definitely continuing to play out cosmos as well. I think it's certainly validating to see other ecosystems adopted and push it forward. I mean, that was always sort of part of the goal, part of the mission. I think part of what we're seeing that's so exciting still in cosmos is that the frontier chains, like chains that are really pushing the boundary on new kinds of tech, whether it's privacy or performance or new kinds of scalability, many if not basically all of them, are actually building with the Cosmos stack. And so seeing things like DydX come to Cosmos, seeing Celestia just launch using the Cosmos stack and founding the modularity, the modular era, so to speak. And you've got guys like Anoma and Penumbra really pushing the bar on privacy. You've got new virtual machine chain designs or even just new EVM chains like bear chain using the Cosmo stack, you've got a Gorek with their new virtual machine.
00:04:06.980 - 00:04:46.590, Speaker C: So seeing a lot of the cutting edge technology deployment happening using the Cosmo stack, I think, is very validating. Now, it could be the case that for where we are in the cycle or in the market or in the adoption of these applications, it doesn't make sense for every other defi application to have their own app chain provisioning. Sovereignty is expensive. There's a price to it. I mean, that's part of the point, and you need to bear the cost of that. And are we going to be able to finance that with new inflationary tokens indefinitely? I mean, that's not clear. I don't think anyone ever really thought that was sustainable.
00:04:46.590 - 00:05:18.508, Speaker C: It was always kind of a bootstrap mechanism that made sense at some point in the cycle and maybe won't make sense in the future. But I think as we start to see some of these other infrastructure chains get off the ground, get adopted, as we start to see some of the more advanced applications, you know, prove out the model, then we'll see more apps kind of come back or launch using. Using the app chain thesis when it makes sense. Right. The whole point of Cosmos was to open up the spectrum of possibilities for developers and communities to do the thing that made the most sense for them. Right. And that will be different things at different times.
00:05:18.508 - 00:05:21.024, Speaker C: And so I think that's all very validating.
00:05:22.124 - 00:06:03.124, Speaker G: Can you unpack that a little bit more, Ethan, for someone that doesn't really kind of understand that, of course, we've seen, like, this explosion of l two s. Now, of course, you have projects like DydX, Bootstrap, their own app chain, and as you alluded to, that carry some costs, and that could be subsidized through inflation. So, as you think about, if you're a developer listening to this, what's the ideal protocol that would be suitable to deploy their own app chain? Like, do you need to be of certain size, of certain users of certain market cap for it to be kind of relevant? Or how should we think about this?
00:06:03.744 - 00:06:53.410, Speaker C: Yeah, I was going to say the ideal protocol is one with adoption, but it's a little bit. I mean, yeah, like, you know, it's a heavy solution to have an app chain, you could say. And it gives you, as the developer, it gives you full strap vertical integration so you can control every part of the platform and of its deployment. And that's very powerful. And so if you want that or you need that, if there's elements you need to control, right. If you want to experiment with new kinds of cryptography, if you want to experiment with new ways to address performance, scalability, whatever the case may be, having that full stack integration and control over. Over the full stack lets you do that.
00:06:53.410 - 00:07:31.894, Speaker C: Now, it comes at the cost of provisioning and maintaining an independent validator set right now. So how you afford that? There are also different solutions that. There hasn't been that much, I think, experimentation in that maybe, as we would like there to be. But ultimately, validators need to get paid and how they get paid right now, there's really sort of two basic models is like inflation of a token or. And. Or transaction fees, right? And so, ideally, if you have enough adoption that you're generating enough fees that you can use that to pay your validators, then the burden is not that high. And it makes a lot of sense to run your own app chain, right.
00:07:31.894 - 00:08:37.574, Speaker C: If it makes sense to you to have an inflationary token and to use that as a bootstrap mechanism to attract a validator set and to sort of buy the time to build the adoption and the product market fit, then that can make sense as well. Of course, you're going to be subject to larger market cycles and fluctuations and so on, but that's still a fully viable path that a number of folks have chosen. Now, the other just benefit that comes from building, using the interchange stack and the Cosmos tech and building your own app chain is IBC. And you just get this seamless interoperability with all these other chains. And that's something that shouldn't be under emphasized because it's so powerful to be able to launch and then immediately have connections without having to build bespoke bridges or custom infrastructure to connect to everyone and be able to access that liquidity, access that other functionality, access those users. So it comes with the larger ecosystem, which I think is also very powerful and drives decision making in some cases. For chains to use the stack to be a cosmos chain, so to speak.
00:08:38.034 - 00:09:26.710, Speaker G: Yeah, I want to talk about two things. One, shared security and some of the validators that you could go about, like for instance, Eigen layer. Some of these projects are creating this validator community and that shared security model and how that would compare to launching your own app chain. And I also want to talk about just composability in the context of IBC because that's something that's often talked about in the context of L two s. Like, do you lose composability? Obviously, bridges create friction, but maybe we can start with IBC. Just how powerful that is relative to kind of the current or the different other kind of value propositions out there. You know, could you talk about like how IBC could work and how that from a user experience and from also from a developer experience, how different that.
00:09:26.742 - 00:09:28.790, Speaker D: Is from like for instance, in l two.
00:09:28.902 - 00:09:32.464, Speaker E: At SCIP, we've actually played with a couple of different interop protocols.
00:09:32.764 - 00:09:37.100, Speaker D: IBC, as well as Axel, are playing.
00:09:37.132 - 00:09:39.804, Speaker E: A bit with some of the Ethereum.
00:09:39.844 - 00:09:44.108, Speaker D: Native interop protocols, and we've had a.
00:09:44.116 - 00:09:46.544, Speaker E: Really great experience with IBC.
00:09:47.684 - 00:09:48.664, Speaker D: It is.
00:09:50.364 - 00:09:57.288, Speaker E: It'S quite fleshed out. So the level of interop that you.
00:09:57.436 - 00:10:03.960, Speaker D: That you kind of see in cosmos is quite interesting.
00:10:03.992 - 00:10:06.080, Speaker E: I mean, it actually kind of rivals.
00:10:06.192 - 00:10:12.864, Speaker D: A kind of shared execution environment. So you can do remote execution calls.
00:10:12.904 - 00:10:16.088, Speaker E: Get results back, perform computation after those.
00:10:16.176 - 00:10:18.164, Speaker D: Results have been received.
00:10:19.224 - 00:10:23.934, Speaker E: There's a whole acknowledgement timeout model.
00:10:24.064 - 00:10:31.970, Speaker D: Um, so, uh, you get a rich set of information about, um, the, uh.
00:10:32.082 - 00:10:35.362, Speaker E: The form of execution that's happening on remote domains that can then be kind.
00:10:35.378 - 00:10:40.530, Speaker D: Of like integrated into some local logic.
00:10:40.642 - 00:10:51.616, Speaker E: Uh, so you can have like continuations after remote execution. You do see these like multi chain flows pretty frequently in cosmos, and I haven't really seen that in Ethereum yet.
00:10:51.640 - 00:11:01.048, Speaker D: Where you're performing some swap locally, migrating back to another chain, performing another swap.
00:11:01.096 - 00:11:04.784, Speaker E: Or putting that into a lending protocol on a remote chain.
00:11:04.824 - 00:11:08.816, Speaker D: You're just doing that as a single signing event.
00:11:09.000 - 00:11:28.994, Speaker G: Yeah, I want to level set that because what you're alluding to is it takes up to, you know, two, three, five days to switch between an l two and an l one, for instance. And what you're saying is, with IBC, if you're, for instance, you know, one.
00:11:29.034 - 00:11:30.418, Speaker D: Chain, and then you're.
00:11:30.466 - 00:11:39.534, Speaker G: You're interacting with another, say dy DX, and you want to do something else, you could do that, like, IBC's this connectivity layer that you can do that.
00:11:40.114 - 00:11:45.714, Speaker D: You know, almost atomically atomic. Like, yeah.
00:11:45.754 - 00:11:48.494, Speaker E: So it has asynchronous atomicity.
00:11:49.954 - 00:11:53.970, Speaker D: And the consensus protocol comet was built.
00:11:54.002 - 00:11:56.098, Speaker E: With this in mind. It has instant finality.
00:11:56.146 - 00:12:04.650, Speaker D: So really, you're talking about the duration of a single block time and then a message to be passed and then.
00:12:04.682 - 00:12:06.290, Speaker E: Another block time on the remote chain.
00:12:06.362 - 00:12:14.662, Speaker D: So it's on the order of, like, seconds to perform. Multi chain flows can be a little.
00:12:14.678 - 00:12:17.294, Speaker E: Bit longer depending on the kind of transmission time.
00:12:17.454 - 00:12:23.886, Speaker D: That's kind of all stuff that we're working on is improving block times and transmission speeds.
00:12:23.910 - 00:12:25.054, Speaker E: So you can really do these things.
00:12:25.094 - 00:12:28.854, Speaker D: It's like, okay, it kind of works just instantly.
00:12:28.894 - 00:12:30.754, Speaker E: And I'd touched four different chains.
00:12:31.254 - 00:12:32.034, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:12:32.454 - 00:13:21.650, Speaker G: I wonder, one of the biggest questions for me when I first started learning more about Cosmos, you guys raised around way back in the day for Tendermint and IBC was, like, on the horizon. Then, of course, it took a little bit of time. And one of the things for me when I think of Cosmos is it's kind of like, the tech is really cool, but just for whatever reason, it just doesn't have the same beady muscle and attention or appreciation from the broader community. And, Ethan, you're kind of, like, smirking, smiling. Why do you think that is? Certainly we've seen, like, DydX, for instance, like, appreciate the potential. Like, Facebook at one point was explained, like, a lot of tendermint as a consensus protocol. I think it's super battle tested.
00:13:21.650 - 00:13:33.494, Speaker G: Like, a lot of people have used it kind of in a white label manner. But I'm just kind of curious what you both would attribute to this lack of love or appreciation for IBC and Cosmos in general.
00:13:37.234 - 00:13:38.654, Speaker D: You want to take that, Ethan?
00:13:39.914 - 00:14:37.984, Speaker C: I think there are a few questions buried in there. My general sense is that there is quite substantial love, let's say, for comet, for IBC, for Cosmos. There was, I think, a bigger question about why has the BD in cosmos not been very good, or the marketing and so on? You know, one answer is Cosmos suffered a quite large scale organizational restructuring, let's say, to be diplomatic, that severely interfered with efforts to build kind of a coherent organization. And, you know, three years later, like, or four years later, almost, we're still kind of. We're still kind of downstream of all of that. And so that was a major. Unlike almost every other ecosystem in cosmos, there isn't, like, a single place you can go to get your.
00:14:37.984 - 00:15:15.268, Speaker C: To be routed, to get BD needs answered. That takes responsibility for marketing things like this. And so Cosmos is kind of organizationally uniquely decentralized, which has pros and cons. And one of the cons has been a lack of coherence around BD and marketing. And that's, I think, had a major impact on things. On the other hand, to just take some more direct responsibility for it, Cosmos has always had a bit more of a, look, we're not going to market and chill something here because we want to play a different kind of game. We want to play a longer game.
00:15:15.268 - 00:16:03.884, Speaker C: We want to build, like, transformative, generational technology that is not based on any kind of single token dominating the whole ecosystem the way so many other chains and projects are sort of oriented. And so that kind of orientation, I think, has also focused the project on more sort of technical matters than, let's say, the market and NBD matters. Now, having that orientation doesn't preclude marketing or BD or, you know, it's not supposed to say that, like, okay, those things don't matter. But organizationally, we never really had the opportunity to build the coherence there. And, you know, there have been various efforts, but there've been, you know, there have been setbacks along the way as well. So. Yeah, Sam, I don't know if you want to add anything to that.
00:16:04.824 - 00:16:09.884, Speaker E: Yeah, all those things are very true. I would say the.
00:16:11.824 - 00:16:12.400, Speaker C: The kind of.
00:16:12.432 - 00:16:16.964, Speaker E: Model that a lot of Cosmos developers have internalized is that.
00:16:20.024 - 00:16:25.080, Speaker D: Cosmos is more of this stack or design pattern than.
00:16:25.112 - 00:16:28.404, Speaker E: It is a singular technology. So.
00:16:30.824 - 00:16:32.856, Speaker D: The fact that Ethereum has adopted.
00:16:32.880 - 00:16:36.992, Speaker E: This app chain roll up model is actually kind of a Cosmos win, in.
00:16:37.008 - 00:16:39.784, Speaker D: A way, because if you treat it.
00:16:39.824 - 00:16:44.404, Speaker E: As a pattern, Ethereum has adopted the Cosmos pattern.
00:16:46.344 - 00:16:59.416, Speaker D: We're actually very collaborative with a lot of these folks that are trying to develop app chains on Ethereum. In our view, that is adoption of Cosmos, where you've swapped out a couple.
00:16:59.440 - 00:17:03.160, Speaker E: Of components, you've said, okay, well, I want to use my own custom bridging.
00:17:03.192 - 00:17:08.208, Speaker D: Technology, and I want to outsource, block.
00:17:08.256 - 00:17:12.064, Speaker E: Production to a third party, potentially, or data availability to a third party.
00:17:12.144 - 00:17:14.844, Speaker D: So you've kind of chosen your stack.
00:17:15.744 - 00:17:31.452, Speaker E: And there's a bunch of teams that are working on integrations there. I guess there's just a different frame of reference about what success even looks like. We are like promoting the adoption of.
00:17:31.468 - 00:17:33.924, Speaker D: That pattern, and we were actually very.
00:17:33.964 - 00:18:20.784, Speaker E: Successful in getting Ethereum to adopt that pattern. There are individual components within that stack. So comet and IBC that we think are best in class, and those have made their way into some interesting domains. So comets being used by a bunch of Ethereum protocols individually, just as a. Just an off the shelf solution. IBC has been adopted and gotten integrations into Polkadot and avalanche, and there's a bunch of Ethereum integrations coming. We've been less successful in getting the Ethereum roll ups to use IBC, but that's okay.
00:18:20.784 - 00:18:52.768, Speaker E: So there's still validation of this, this general pattern. I would love to see like greater adoption of some of the core components. And one of the results of this kind of restructuring that Ethan is referring to, I think, is stronger ownership of some of these individual technologies. So I think we're better positioned now to be doing a little bit more of a concerted bd effort that's led.
00:18:52.816 - 00:19:00.312, Speaker D: By organizations that are building Cosmos SDK.
00:19:00.368 - 00:19:02.512, Speaker E: Or building comet, because there's kind of.
00:19:02.528 - 00:19:08.884, Speaker D: A direct benefit to the bottom line there.
00:19:09.704 - 00:19:21.264, Speaker B: Ethan, what'd you think about Roon choosing a fork of Solana for for maker instead of potentially becoming an app chain on Cosmos?
00:19:22.524 - 00:19:24.344, Speaker C: Samra a very good.
00:19:25.284 - 00:19:27.144, Speaker B: All right, then we can throw this.
00:19:27.484 - 00:19:31.388, Speaker C: Summary about why they should choose Comet. Yeah. Birds. Cosmos.
00:19:31.436 - 00:19:45.204, Speaker E: Yeah, yeah. It was one of the reply guys in that, like, gigantic post that ruin had, and we've been chatting to ruin a little bit. First of all, the. My understanding is that they're still evaluating.
00:19:45.784 - 00:19:48.684, Speaker D: He was just kind of like, Solana pilled a bit.
00:19:50.144 - 00:20:09.820, Speaker E: If I'm being honest, I don't fully understand the product requirements that they have. It seems like they may be trying to do a payments thing, which is why Solana is a good option. But I'm kind of reading between the lines a little bit there. Yeah, I had like a pretty detailed.
00:20:09.852 - 00:20:22.264, Speaker D: Like, why maker might choose Cosmos or like the Cosmos stack, and maybe you can link to that at some point.
00:20:24.284 - 00:20:26.860, Speaker E: And I did a kind of follow up.
00:20:26.972 - 00:20:29.636, Speaker D: They asked me to do a discussion.
00:20:29.740 - 00:20:33.424, Speaker E: With one of the guito folks just as like a compare and contrast.
00:20:34.944 - 00:20:37.204, Speaker D: So the jury's still out.
00:20:39.264 - 00:20:41.280, Speaker E: But Solana.
00:20:41.312 - 00:20:43.328, Speaker D: Is also just an excellent set of technology.
00:20:43.416 - 00:20:44.124, Speaker E: I mean.
00:20:46.104 - 00:20:47.888, Speaker D: We'Ve been in conversation with.
00:20:47.896 - 00:20:49.184, Speaker E: Anatoly for a long time.
00:20:49.264 - 00:21:00.814, Speaker D: Like, they've borrowed a bunch of design elements from our technology. We're very supportive of that, that community.
00:21:00.894 - 00:21:05.270, Speaker E: So I really think that people should.
00:21:05.422 - 00:21:09.754, Speaker D: Should be thinking about the selection of.
00:21:10.494 - 00:21:39.334, Speaker E: The underlying components, like, from first principles, like, what are your needs? What are your needs from a functionality perspective, from an integration perspective, wallet support, what is the kind of governance model that you're looking for? And just kind of like, reverse engineer what components plug into that. And.
00:21:41.194 - 00:21:43.706, Speaker D: There'S strong evidence that one or.
00:21:43.730 - 00:21:48.534, Speaker E: More of the cosmos components actually serves customers quite well.
00:21:48.914 - 00:21:55.406, Speaker B: Yeah, Ethan, I know you were half joking when you unmuted to give the little Solana plug there, but I'd actually.
00:21:55.430 - 00:21:56.470, Speaker A: Be curious to get your takes on.
00:21:56.502 - 00:22:03.314, Speaker B: Maybe the op stack versus Solana. And if you weren't building in Cosmos and you had to pick maybe.
00:22:05.054 - 00:22:05.510, Speaker D: Op.
00:22:05.582 - 00:22:10.074, Speaker B: Stack or something on arbitrum versus Solana, where would you tend to trend towards.
00:22:13.654 - 00:23:00.028, Speaker C: Me personally? Yeah, I guess it depends on what I'm building and what I need and how much, you know, what does it come down to? Like, ETH alignment versus performance or something. Right. So which gods do I need to make the sacrifices to? I would be doing something in the, in the cosmos philosophy. I mean, I don't know exactly. It would very much depend on the application. So I don't think you can answer that in general. And I think that's, that's kind of the point of cosmos, is to say that you can't make these kinds of decisions in general, and it doesn't make sense to think about these things in general, and that you actually have to reason about particular applications, particular needs, particular communities, and use cases and deployment strategies, and what you actually want out of the system.
00:23:00.028 - 00:23:43.324, Speaker C: And just trying to build generalized general purpose infrastructure for every single use case doesn't make sense. I mean, that's not how you build scalable social technologies. And I think Ethereum is sort of coming to terms with that in a kind of roundabout way, where they're realizing, okay, maybe we're not going to build a world computer for every application. We're going to build a world computer for settlement across application specific computers, whereas Solana is maybe doing something different. But I think even Solana's use case is very particular. They want to build, you know, very high performance global state machine, and that's not going to serve every use case. And I think they know that.
00:23:43.324 - 00:24:00.796, Speaker C: And I sort of make the joke, oh, it's a cosmos chain. I mean, toli makes that joke, too. But in a sense, it's not a joke, it's real, because they're building under the model that they have a particular community, particular use case, and they're designing for that, and they need control of the whole stack so that they can meet their requirements.
00:24:00.860 - 00:24:01.464, Speaker F: Right.
00:24:02.184 - 00:24:19.044, Speaker C: And that's what, that's what has made Solana so great, frankly, is that they get that right. So I think that, you know, that's, that's important to understand now. So, again, I can't answer that in general, it would depend on what I'm building and who I'm building it with and for what purpose. Yeah.
00:24:19.744 - 00:24:27.084, Speaker G: So does everything become or can, or can become a. A cosmos chain with IBC, like, you know?
00:24:28.084 - 00:24:30.020, Speaker E: Yeah, that's the hope.
00:24:30.172 - 00:24:31.264, Speaker C: That's the idea.
00:24:33.604 - 00:25:06.040, Speaker E: If I had to wager a guess, the reason that people are choosing the op stack today is basically because it has a bunch of out of the box wallet integrations, and DeFi protocols can deploy there relatively easily, and then there's some kind of norm that's set that you can get, you can onboard ETH, liquidity, ETH users. Those are fantastic reasons to choose a stack. They really have nothing to do with technology.
00:25:06.232 - 00:25:08.712, Speaker B: More to do with what? User aggregation, basically.
00:25:08.768 - 00:25:17.124, Speaker E: Like all the user, user and developer aggregation. Yeah. And that is an amazing reason to choose technology.
00:25:18.504 - 00:25:38.064, Speaker B: So the cosmos theory here is that aggregation, historically, aggregation of demand has been around the l one. People are hanging out in arbitrum Defi land, or they're hanging out in ETH land. And your guys theory is that that has to end, right? And that applications end up becoming the real user aggregators like they do in web two.
00:25:39.844 - 00:26:24.876, Speaker E: I think so, yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think, Ethan, I maybe came to this from a slightly different place, but I was very interested in this platform co op type model where it's like, okay, there's these giant web two applications where there's no user ownership and they have an outsized power. So can we actually give users on the platform more agency? And Ethan, I think, came at it from a very kind of monetary localist perspective, a little bit more grounded in economics.
00:26:24.940 - 00:26:25.544, Speaker D: But.
00:26:27.724 - 00:26:50.394, Speaker E: By and large, I would say that's correct. Cosmos is pretty focused on communities, and arbitrum is a community, I would say, that really has a life of its own at this point, but it was kind of like importing a lot of the liquidity users culture of Ethereum originally.
00:26:53.614 - 00:27:54.854, Speaker G: I want to focus on the case of DydX. At some point, the team realized, hey, it's not. I mean, I think they made the choice when there wasn't as a robust of an l two e comma ecosystem today, but there's a great detail post of Antonio. I think that goes into the rationale for deploying on cosmos. I want to get your perspective. One, are we going to see more dy dxs of the world that at some point decide that the cosmos chain is sort of like a the more viable kind of path forward versus having their own l two or a fork of Solana? And if so, I'm curious if there are particular applications that or type of protocols that might do that versus others that just may not.
00:27:59.094 - 00:28:00.278, Speaker C: Yeah, I think so.
00:28:00.326 - 00:28:03.354, Speaker E: I've worked with DydX a fair bit.
00:28:05.054 - 00:28:13.574, Speaker D: And it's definitely of this class of user that wants to have very specific.
00:28:13.614 - 00:28:15.646, Speaker E: Functionality that kind of requires some degree.
00:28:15.670 - 00:28:23.186, Speaker D: Of full stack control. One of the things that they are.
00:28:23.210 - 00:28:37.014, Speaker E: Doing that is kind of common to a bunch of cosmos chains is asking their validators to kind of perform extra work. So they are holding an order book and performing matching operations.
00:28:38.314 - 00:28:52.374, Speaker D: They're going to be involved in the kind of future oracle updates, most likely. And these are things that a roll up potentially could do.
00:28:56.954 - 00:28:58.354, Speaker E: Even the roll up frameworks that are.
00:28:58.394 - 00:29:00.734, Speaker D: Out there today are pretty.
00:29:02.754 - 00:29:03.154, Speaker E: Smart.
00:29:03.194 - 00:29:04.974, Speaker D: Contract plus.
00:29:07.714 - 00:29:10.694, Speaker E: There isn't a lot of access to low level primitives.
00:29:11.474 - 00:29:13.962, Speaker D: And that's just because these frameworks are.
00:29:13.978 - 00:29:18.174, Speaker E: Pretty new and they haven't really been sufficiently explored, in my opinion.
00:29:20.144 - 00:29:27.164, Speaker D: You don't really see these projects leveraging the validator set in the same way, or.
00:29:29.544 - 00:29:35.384, Speaker E: They'Ll add a single opcode or something. That's the degree of customizability that you get.
00:29:35.504 - 00:29:44.012, Speaker D: They're not modifying the consensus engine. That's the kind of thing that, that.
00:29:44.028 - 00:29:45.004, Speaker E: You'Re going to be doing in cosmos.
00:29:45.044 - 00:29:47.444, Speaker D: And that's, that's kind of what DyDx.
00:29:47.484 - 00:29:48.904, Speaker E: Needed at the end of the day.
00:29:50.244 - 00:30:21.124, Speaker A: All right, everyone, so we talk a lot about the institutions coming into crypto on Empire. Santi and I are both headed out to London March 18 to 20th for blockworks 8th ever Digital Asset Summit. Das. This is an institutional buttoned up conference that we've hosted since 2019. I like to joke that it is probably the last remaining kind of suit and tie event in crypto. People are still wearing suit and tie. It's pretty funny, but you'll actually hear from a lot of the largest institutions in the world coming from Standard Charter, FIS, JPMorgan Framework.
00:30:21.124 - 00:30:51.390, Speaker A: Folks coming out Wintermute, Vanek, Goldman Sachs there are a couple big themes of this conference. One, bitcoin catalysts, the halving and the spot ETF. Two, a view from the buy side. Three, RWAs tokenization and stable coins, four, global regulatory frameworks, five, institutional infrastructure, including banking and payments, and six, the macro case for crypto. If you have anything to do with the institutional side of crypto, you have to be there. Santi and I got your back. We hooked you up with a 20% off code.
00:30:51.390 - 00:31:36.086, Speaker A: It is Empire 20. There is a little competition running internally at blockworks to see who can drive the most number of tickets. So help Santi and I out register with our code and you get 20% off. That is Empire 20. This episode is brought to you by Toku, the first comprehensive global solution for token compensation and tax compliance. If you say yes to any of the following four questions, Toku is a no brainer solution for you. Number one, are you planning to launch a token? Number two, is your token already live? Number three, are you currently granting your employees or contractors besting token awards? And number four, are you trying to figure out how to take care of taxable token events for your team? If yes, you have to get in.
00:31:36.110 - 00:31:37.350, Speaker B: Touch with the Toku team.
00:31:37.422 - 00:32:02.076, Speaker A: Toku to high level makes implementing global token compensation and incentive awards simple.

00:32:20.488 - 00:32:21.764, Speaker D: You connected to the team.
00:32:23.264 - 00:32:59.754, Speaker G: On the point of validators, Ethan, I don't know if you have an opinion on that, but I want to just we've talked about, you know, getting a validator set and how important that is to launching your own app chain. Walk us through who are these folks? How easy is it to bootstrap that? And what are the options in terms of the shared security model? Can you borrow it from another app chain and then pay them some sort of a referral fee of sorts? What are the different options? And how easy is it to bootstrap this validator set or get some shared security?
00:33:01.554 - 00:34:00.962, Speaker C: Yeah, I think there's a growing number of validator companies out there, and I don't think chains have had a hard time recruiting validators. I mean, some testnets become like overloaded with validators and validator sets on new chains tend to be quite competitive quite quickly. And so you even find validators who are pretty active, like dropping out of the set kind of quickly because they just don't have enough stake. So it seems like actually recruiting validator sets hasn't been that difficult. Now maybe keeping them sufficiently decentralized or, you know, or ensuring that the sort of long tail of small validators are financially viable, that's been a little bit more difficult with, with, you know, especially during the bear cycle and with inflationary, you know, mechanics and all that sort of stuff. But, you know, of course, now we're seeing an emerging set of options around, around shared security. So one in particular has been the interchange security offering from the cosmos hub.
00:34:00.962 - 00:35:07.508, Speaker C: So that hasn't really been used for launching new chains per se yet. I mean, it's not, the current version that's released isn't really that scalable. So to date, there are two chains using the interchange security model with the Cosmos hub. So those are neutron and stride. So neutron is a cosmwasm smart contracting platform that inherits its security from atom, the Cosmos Hub. And stride is a cosmos wide liquid staking token provider. And we expect to see others, but we're also, there's a lot of work on actually making that protocol more scalable so that it can be really a more viable launchpad, let's say, for other chains or for, for existing chains to sort of segue in and give up their validator set or transition them over to leveraging the hub's validator set, or at least what's interesting about what's emerging there is that it doesn't necessarily need to inherit the whole validator set from the Cosmos hub, but it could use the staked atoms on new validators or a different set of validators, which is sort of interesting possibilities that's being explored.
00:35:07.508 - 00:35:38.718, Speaker C: So I think we're going to see a lot more options over the coming, let's say, year or two years about where new chains can source their security and validator set from. And I think we'll start to see, like, more interesting markets for that, which will be really interesting. I think there's a whole, like, you know, area of mechanism design around recruiting and incentivizing validators. And obviously it connects with, you know, Mev and this kind of research that folks like skip are doing and others. So I think it's about to get pretty interesting, but it's really just starting.
00:35:38.846 - 00:36:24.740, Speaker G: And for, like, perhaps the less in, like, the more uninitiated, like, cosmos person, like, for context, like, one of the common criticism I've heard of cosmos or atoms is in theory, the cosmos hub is, you know, like, you could use atom as like a stake. You stake your atoms, and validators do that. And then, you know, you, it wasn't clear that that would, like, the atom would be like the security substrate of all these chains. So, like, if that makes sense, and that's a common criticism I've heard over and over. It's like, yeah, we get the model. It's super interesting. The tech is very interesting, but unclear if atom will be like that de facto, like security substrate or just like the native token.
00:36:24.740 - 00:36:58.496, Speaker G: Like, you could have dy dx versus atom. And so the value accrual is. So in a world where, yeah, you really nail it. You have so many protocols launching their own chain, and they may use their native token for security and for validation, and not even use atom for that. Is that like, is that a valid argument or not? I'm just kind of curious because I have heard it over and over again and I get it, but I'm not 100% sure it's correct or in practice.
00:36:58.600 - 00:37:02.624, Speaker E: Why would that be any different than Ethereum roll ups?
00:37:03.564 - 00:37:25.064, Speaker G: Well, I guess the argument for Ethereum is if you have a world where l two has really scaled the amount of transactions that can happen in l two, and then there is a settlement at some point happening to the l one, and so the l one does benefit, and so there is some accrual. Now, of course, the big TBD in my mind is, what's that ratio?
00:37:26.544 - 00:38:48.870, Speaker E: But, yeah, yeah, so this is like, kind of gets down to the core tenant of what cosmos is, I guess, which is we just like, think about settlement in a different way. Like, settlement in the cosmos world is a process that happens between two parties. You are settling between two parties, the roll up and the counterparty, or the shared security chain and the counterparty. And Ethereum kind of has this, like, okay, all settlement occurs on the Ethereum chain. You're kind of outsourcing some ledger, like, temporary matching and then doing some settlement back on Ethereum. So, yeah, I guess that kind of, like, frames scalability in a slightly different way. But the way I think about security is generally, it will be if you're thinking about security specifically just from the cost of capital perspective, like, then you're probably going to want to use, like, the most pristine capital that has the lowest cost.
00:38:48.870 - 00:39:45.324, Speaker E: So, like, bitcoin or ethereum is going to be a really good option if you're thinking about it from a functionality perspective. If you want to integrate with the Ethereum block space, you're going to want to use Ethereum. If you want to integrate with bitcoin block space or the bitcoin community, you're going to want to use bitcoin. And what the Cosmos hub has to do from that perspective is, is provide a differentiated service that people want to integrate with. And there's some ideas about what that may be, but I think that's still like an emerging narrative. One of the things that the Cosmos hub is exploring right now is pairing security with lending. So you would get some kind of protocol and liquidity along with security, which seems to have some traction at this point.
00:39:47.384 - 00:40:45.732, Speaker C: I think one of the core value propositions of the hub is to be a kind of stable and safe. I call it an anchor and a thrashing sea. While it may not always be the highest market cap chain, it may not be the fastest, most innovative, but the goal is for it to be around the longest, so to speak, and to provide a kind of, you know, safe home for long term stability. And so to reduce the surface area of the main chain, but within that, to offer a strong, you know, a compelling offering of interchange security and, you know, interchange capital or interchange money, depending on how you want to think of it, but also also governance. Right? And so the Cosmos hub is one of the most sort of active and engaging, let's say, governance communities. And that sort of differentiates it, I think, from a number of other large market cap chains. There's a lot of community engagement and involvement in what it's doing and what its future is.
00:40:45.732 - 00:42:00.950, Speaker C: And the idea with interchange security is to start by just extending the core functionality of the hub and offering new features, new services as Atom secured chains like what's happened with neutron custom, awesome, and with, and with stride, and to continue that. And in addition to extending its own functionality through these kinds of core services, to also offer a kind of launchpad to leverage its security for other chains. So even if other chains aren't using it to launch for their security, it still can extend its own functionality using its interchange security offering, like what it's doing now. But with the innovations that are coming to interchange security, hopefully over the next year, it'll be a lot more compelling and easier and scalable for chains to leverage the hub security offering. And then, as Sam mentioned, there's this effort to differentiate. One direction that's being explored is what we call atomic IDC, which is basically the ability for these chains that are secured by the cosmos hub to interact with each other atomically, they can have composable synchronous operations that execute sort of cross chain within a single. Within a single block.
00:42:00.950 - 00:42:09.554, Speaker C: So that's potentially very powerful. And differentiate the hubs or security offering from shared security offering from those of other providers.
00:42:09.934 - 00:42:10.714, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:42:11.014 - 00:42:42.644, Speaker G: Apologies if this is a really stupid question, but I want to touch on scalability a bit. In a world where everyone leverages atoms and leverages shared security, is there an upper bound that you guys have said in a similar manner like that perhaps Ethereum may face? Like, if you have hundreds, thousands of chains, like, does a cosmos help at some point reach? Like a limitation of performance or the ability to.
00:42:43.824 - 00:42:54.984, Speaker E: It certainly will. I don't really see that as the objective. I think hub specifically should try to aggregate a smaller number of really.
00:42:57.244 - 00:42:57.652, Speaker C: High.
00:42:57.708 - 00:43:11.864, Speaker E: Level operators that actually have select for the best players. We're really talking about the restaking market.
00:43:12.564 - 00:43:13.824, Speaker D: As a whole here.
00:43:17.314 - 00:43:23.458, Speaker E: Yeah, security has other dimensions, but when we're talking about differentiating within a security.
00:43:23.626 - 00:43:28.690, Speaker D: Within a restaking market, you want blue.
00:43:28.722 - 00:43:40.826, Speaker E: Chip players that have tight integration with your core functionality. If you want some form of synchronous state with some of these applications, if.
00:43:40.850 - 00:43:45.564, Speaker D: You need to tap certain liquidity flows.
00:43:45.604 - 00:43:48.228, Speaker E: Then that's going to be one of.
00:43:48.236 - 00:43:51.664, Speaker D: The reasons that you would choose this domain.
00:43:54.404 - 00:44:06.784, Speaker B: How does a lot of this. Ethan, I heard your talk from modular summit. How does a lot of what we're talking about start to unlock new forms, new actually applications and new products and new ways of interlinking finance?
00:44:08.464 - 00:44:55.870, Speaker C: Yeah, well, I've been thinking a lot for a long time about what the actual use case and applications of all this technology we've been building is. A lot of people are out there saying, yeah, what are we really doing here? A lot of people are out there talking about, oh, stablecoins are the killer app. But I mean, if we built all this infrastructure so that we can just trade vouchers for dollars in Circle's bank account, then, I mean, frankly, we failed. And so there has to be more than just custodial, stable coins as the killer feature here. I do think that money really is the killer app. It takes a while to really unpack what that means, because I don't think any of us really, truly understand money or the changes that are going to come to the monetary system over the coming decades. Probably we're on the cusp of sort of large scale constitutional change and reform.
00:44:55.870 - 00:46:27.760, Speaker C: What we've been focusing on, what I've been focusing on is really, really looking at real world debts and grounding ourselves in the sort of real world payment system and the network of liabilities that exist in sort of commercial activity, right? So in the real world, there are extensions of credit that happen between businesses all the time. This is trade credit, the trade credit market, right? Anytime someone issues you an invoice, that's a form of credit, right? They're extending you credit. They ship you goods or offer you a service, and you don't have to pay them for 30 days, 60 days, 90 days. And what we're looking at now is, okay, can we build that? Can we use that use case as an ideal opportunity to surface new opportunities for people to clear their debts? And essentially what we want to think about is, can we build a payment system that is designed to, to clear the most debt with the least amount of money? And right now, the way the payment systems works, no one's really thinking about that problem of reducing debt with less money, of really optimizing the payments graph in general. Now that's a very important problem for banks themselves, for financial institutions themselves, who get together in what are called clearing houses or clearing clubs, where they're very concerned with clearing the most debt between themselves using the least amount of money. These are all liquidity saving mechanisms. And banks and financial institutions have been doing this for centuries.
00:46:27.760 - 00:47:19.502, Speaker C: It's a major part of what's enabled them to grow, to become so powerful is that they form these closed clubs where you can only get access if you're part of the group. And within that club, you benefit tremendously from clearing debts with each other. But access to those clubs is not accessible to the rest of the world. It's not accessible to you and me. It's not accessible to the average business. And so we're all sort of locked out of these, out of these clearing arrangements. And what we're looking at now is, okay, can we use the blockchain technology, privacy preserving technology, and the potential to do sort of atomic, multilateral settlements, executions that run across many agents at once to enable anyone to participate in clearing and sort of seize back the power of really being in the club, so to speak.
00:47:19.502 - 00:48:10.612, Speaker C: Everyone's running around talking about, oh, bitcoin is like a bank account in your pocket. But what's really powerful about banks isn't just control over the assets, it's the ability to discharge liabilities. And so no one really in the blockchain space, I think, is thinking about the problem of the structure of liabilities, the ability to clear them, you know, access to credit, all this kind of stuff. And so we're trying to open that up by looking at what financial institutions have been doing for centuries, really, and trying to make that these clearing systems much more open and accessible. And so that's a project we call collaborative finance, because these benefits really only approve by collaborating in these clearing clubs. And this is something that, again, banks have been doing forever, and we've all been basically systematically excluded from being able to do. And that's led to the current monetary system we have today.
00:48:10.612 - 00:48:52.004, Speaker C: And the way banks and central banks are sort of printing money and doing all this stuff in ways that there's much to lament about. And so we think we can really do something fundamental there. Using blockchain tech in a very practical way for that really benefits real world users and actually has the effect of reducing overall systemic risk, improving the cash flow of individual businesses, improving their ability to, you know, reducing their leverage, improving their ability to access credit, all kinds of things like this. And that actually can make cryptocurrencies themselves more useful in the real world. Yeah. So I gave a talk on all this at the modular summit that sort of goes into a bit more detail. We've been working on a white paper that we expect to release soon.
00:48:52.004 - 00:48:53.684, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:48:55.144 - 00:48:58.256, Speaker B: Is the layman's idea that. So block.
00:48:58.320 - 00:49:00.840, Speaker A: So, historically, Defi has been settlement, like.
00:49:00.952 - 00:49:03.072, Speaker B: Uh, settlement for everybody.
00:49:03.168 - 00:49:08.472, Speaker A: Cofi, are you calling it Cofi? Collaborative finances, settlement plus clearing for all.
00:49:08.528 - 00:49:12.072, Speaker B: Is that the really layman's one. One sentence overview of it?
00:49:12.128 - 00:49:23.824, Speaker C: That's kind of the idea, yeah. So banks have been like, look, um, we're going to keep clearing for ourselves and we're going to off. And we're going to force you to use our rails for settlement. Right. And then blockchains and defi kind of come along. They're like, well, clearing. That involves debts.
00:49:23.824 - 00:49:24.728, Speaker C: We don't like debt.
00:49:24.816 - 00:49:25.200, Speaker F: Let's just.
00:49:25.232 - 00:49:35.384, Speaker C: Let's just open settlement up for everyone. Right. But that's not sufficient. And so we're kind of saying, look, clearing is actually really important. Let's make clearing available to everyone. Yeah. So, that's right.
00:49:40.084 - 00:49:42.184, Speaker B: What does informal systems do, Ethan?
00:49:43.604 - 00:50:19.352, Speaker C: A lot of stuff. I mean, we've been leading development of the Cosmos hub for the last year, so we built and shipped interchange security, and we actually just passed a governance proposal to have our team funded directly by the Cosmos hub for continuing that work in 2024. We also lead development of Comet. So the consensus engine for Cosmos, we built Hermes. That's sort of one of the main IBC relayers as relaying. I think most of the IBC traffic out there we also run a security audits business called informal security. We run a validator, informal staking.
00:50:19.352 - 00:50:25.284, Speaker C: So you can stake with us on some 20 plus different networks. And we've been building COFI.
00:50:26.184 - 00:50:44.528, Speaker B: So I knew you, so I didn't mean that in a derogatory way of saying what in the world are you doing? But when you think about what you guys will be doing in 2024 and 2025, will it start to be more on the front end building these applications instead of just working on. Not really what I'd call the back end, but like the hub and shared security and stuff like that?
00:50:44.696 - 00:51:28.724, Speaker C: Yeah. So co fi is sort of our effort to build a real world application that actually takes the technology we've been building and that everyone's been building for years now to market in a sort of more direct way. And interestingly, we're actually trying to build it as a fully web two product first and just like push as far as we can before we actually need, before we actually need the blockchain tech. And we're getting pretty close to that. But we really want to, like, have there be no question of why blockchains are necessary for this use case and really prove, like, look, this is a fundamental thing that benefits real people that just cannot be done the same way without using this technology. And that's been really.
00:51:29.304 - 00:52:04.042, Speaker B: What are your learnings from governance? Having run informal for a while and participated in cosmos, because actually, when talking to other ecosystems, like, you talk to a lot of other l one s and l two s, and they basically have the inverse problem that Cosmos has. So their problem is, hey, look, we're really, really good at execution. We can ship really quickly. We have no community. We need people engaging on our proposals. We need to, we need to, like, drum up the decentralization. Basically, I would say Cosmos suffers from the inverse of that, which is sometimes a lack of execution ability, but a really, really, really strong community.
00:52:04.042 - 00:52:08.666, Speaker B: So how do you guys think about that? Sam, you're smiling. So maybe you can start there.
00:52:08.730 - 00:52:15.002, Speaker E: Yeah, I've done a bunch of work on the governance system on the hub and just in, cosmos did a bunch.
00:52:15.018 - 00:52:18.998, Speaker D: Of product work there. So you're right.
00:52:19.086 - 00:52:39.434, Speaker E: Kavsas has a super engaged governance community. Part of that is because of the inbuilt delegation system. So validators are also delegated governance powers, and users can override their validator if they wish.
00:52:39.814 - 00:52:46.722, Speaker D: But validators are, yeah, become this kind of intermediary that is supposed to be.
00:52:46.738 - 00:53:18.334, Speaker E: Informed about governance and participates. And there's a. So we know our validators very, very well because they're quite active and they solicit delegations through their kind of external communications and their interactions through governance. The Cosmos governance system is nowhere near perfect today. It was a first stab. I think it does surprisingly well despite.
00:53:19.714 - 00:53:22.734, Speaker D: Kind of its rudimentary design.
00:53:25.714 - 00:53:32.674, Speaker E: I'm pretty excited to see an evolution of that system that becomes more application specific, actually.
00:53:32.834 - 00:53:36.034, Speaker D: So, really, when you know what the.
00:53:36.074 - 00:53:40.322, Speaker E: Purpose of the application is and and really how it should function, then you.
00:53:40.338 - 00:53:43.442, Speaker D: Can start to drill down and delegate.
00:53:43.498 - 00:54:03.930, Speaker E: Specific responsibilities to interested parties. You could potentially do some kind of elections or. The Delphi folks have been kind of pioneering this Borg model in Cosmos, which I think is quite interesting, where you kind of have an integrated legal party.
00:54:04.002 - 00:54:06.896, Speaker D: That has limited, limited liability.
00:54:07.040 - 00:54:08.552, Speaker E: Cosmos kind of painted as being a.
00:54:08.568 - 00:54:10.444, Speaker D: Dramatic ecosystem.
00:54:13.064 - 00:54:33.724, Speaker E: That is just a direct result of very strong user engagement and high agency, which is something that all l two s will, if they are decentralizing, will experience. Um, so it's.
00:54:34.624 - 00:54:37.512, Speaker D: It's kind of a byproduct of of that.
00:54:37.688 - 00:54:42.928, Speaker E: That agency not, you know, anything that's specific to the cosmos community.
00:54:43.056 - 00:54:54.084, Speaker B: Ethan, what do you think about this? Because you guys had a one to one system, right? Yeah, it was kind of more set up like a co op, kind of like one. One person, one vote. At least a year ago when we talked, is that. Is that a similar model still?
00:54:54.584 - 00:54:55.256, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:54:55.400 - 00:55:15.034, Speaker F: So informal is. Is set up like a workers cooperative. So, you know, after you're with the company for nine months, because you get. You get your one vote, that's, you know, the gestation period of a human day to day. Sam, you don't like that. You know, does humor belong in corporate governance?
00:55:15.114 - 00:55:15.814, Speaker C: Yes.
00:55:17.554 - 00:55:20.858, Speaker F: Yeah, I think it's. I think it's important for employees to have representation.
00:55:20.986 - 00:55:22.426, Speaker C: I think what you don't want is.
00:55:22.450 - 00:55:55.974, Speaker F: To overburden your day to day operations with governance. The reality is that governance is very expensive. And, you know, one of the, one of the major things I've learned both from running informal and also from, from Cosmos is that often you have a desire to, to formalize and follow like, you know, rigorous, good, strong practices. And all of that is good, but it can also be. It can also be very, very expensive. And sometimes you need to be able to sort of make practical trade offs. And I think at some level, the hub is actually learning this and has done a decent job at this, and it's been sort of interesting.
00:55:55.974 - 00:56:50.074, Speaker F: And, you know, on one hand, I think things in terms of governance have, have professionalized and prove on the hub I think, you know, other times there's just like, you know, sometimes something needs to pass just to sort of send a signal or to follow through or to not just create like significant added burden to kind of do it again at informal, you know, I think we're learning sort of similar lessons. So we don't, it's not like every decision in the company goes through a full vote. That would be sort of insane, really. The voting just comes down to, like, the big decisions, like the board of directors. So, for instance, we actually did just, we elected a new director because one of our previous directors stepped down. He was moving on to other things. And so we had, you know, we put together like a nominating committee and we nominated someone and then, you know, we brought them into our all hands and they were, they were grilled by like 50 employees, which was kind of a crazy experience for that board member.
00:56:50.074 - 00:56:50.738, Speaker F: But then.
00:56:50.866 - 00:56:51.600, Speaker B: Pretty interesting.
00:56:51.682 - 00:57:33.724, Speaker F: Yeah, but then, but then we did the vote and, you know, elected him and so now he's joining the board. So, so it's not, you know, so what we don't want is to have that kind of level of engagement day to day because that's just a huge, it's just very costly and there's a lot of overhead. And so we've really been trying to understand, understand this problem sort of, sort of more deeply as one of like information ecology. Right. So, you know, people often, you know, they often run around sort of like just demanding, like complete transparency of everything or, you know, involvement and every decision. Everyone's got an opinion, everyone wants to participate, but that's not necessarily useful. You know, making good decisions requires, requires context, competence and experience.
00:57:33.724 - 00:58:32.320, Speaker F: And if you have people trying to be involved that don't have, you know, at least one, if not two or all three of those things, context, competence and experience, then, then it's not really, it's not really valuable. Right. And so just trying to do, you know, radical transparency for transparency sake or like radical engagement for engagement sake isn't necessarily useful. If you have people chiming in that don't have the context, confidence or experience, then you're not necessarily going to get good results just because you did governance. And so we're trying to be a lot more real about that and about how we engage and how we structure things and how we enable the members of informal to actually contribute in the way that's best and how we reduce the overhead, say, on the executive team on, for sort of managing a more complex governance procedure. And that's been really interesting to sort of navigate the company through. And I think the cosmos hub is going through a sort of similar thing.
00:58:32.352 - 00:58:32.472, Speaker C: Right.
00:58:32.488 - 00:59:11.248, Speaker F: Like sometimes you hear from very loud voices who have very strong opinions on governance, but frankly, they don't have the context, competence or experience to actually contribute in a valuable way. And so, you know, that's obviously, there's lots of people that do. And it's sort of interesting that, you know, these, these open systems, you kind of can't restrict people from participating. And that's, that's part of what's so valuable about them. But you also need, you also need ways to manage the sort of information ecology effectively so that you can surface the right information, so that you can have the right conversation, so that you can make the right decisions. Right. So I think at the end of the day, like, one of the major takeaways for me about all this stuff is that, look, humans are political animals.
00:59:11.248 - 00:59:44.288, Speaker F: That's like, part of what it means to be human is to be able to engage in politics. Politics typically has like, a negative connotation, you know, Thanksgiving dinner, and you just talk about politics and everyone hates each other or whatever. But I think there's, I think there is a positive side to it. But I think the key enabler for that really is language and having good language to be able to talk about things and discuss things and have the right conversations. Right. The sort of nature and quality of your politics, I think, really comes down. And by politics, I don't mean like, an individual's political position.
00:59:44.288 - 01:00:06.038, Speaker F: I mean the quality of, like, the, the political institutions really comes down to the language you use and the kinds of conversations you're able to have. And so by focusing on, like, sort of having better language and having better conversations, I think that's really the most important thing. More than any kind of formal governance procedure or voting mechanism or any of this kind of stuff, I think it's really about the conversations.
01:00:06.126 - 01:00:06.750, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:00:06.902 - 01:00:30.574, Speaker E: One thing I'll add to that is that, like, the, the most effective institution is like, is not the one with the least amount of conflict. Conflict is an important part of negotiation and kind of servicing information that's critical for good decision making.
01:00:31.394 - 01:00:32.974, Speaker D: But this gets kind of muddied.
01:00:33.394 - 01:00:34.802, Speaker E: It's very easy to say that this.
01:00:34.818 - 01:00:37.926, Speaker D: Is like, this is a waste of.
01:00:37.950 - 01:00:45.238, Speaker E: Time or this is toxic or something because, like, everybody's arguing, you know, you need to balance that correctly.
01:00:45.286 - 01:00:47.794, Speaker D: But the.
01:00:50.094 - 01:00:51.230, Speaker E: We should really be trying.
01:00:51.262 - 01:00:59.154, Speaker D: To index on what institutions are best for the kind of key stakeholders, and.
01:01:00.094 - 01:01:08.754, Speaker E: That is something that cosmos has not nailed. But at least we're, like, trying to think about in a. In a relatively clear way.
01:01:10.134 - 01:01:21.074, Speaker B: Guys, we think about wrapping this up. Anything that Santi and I have missed in terms of really exciting things that you guys are thinking about going into 2024 that we haven't talked about yet.
01:01:23.774 - 01:01:28.994, Speaker E: One kind of general theme is Cosmos is making its way into.
01:01:30.694 - 01:01:33.318, Speaker D: Kind of unexpected realm.
01:01:33.366 - 01:01:58.694, Speaker E: So there is a bitcoin restaking project that's very directly integrated into cosmos called Babylon. We're working with the Eigen layer folks on cosmos integrations into restaking. So I actually see the cosmos is going to be this interesting mesh that exists between many different platforms.
01:01:58.854 - 01:02:09.234, Speaker B: So the hub will basically be this shared security provider against Celestia. Ethereum Eigen layer. Bitcoin is that kind of where you see that going.
01:02:10.934 - 01:02:45.822, Speaker E: Celestia is a DA provider, so the quality of that security is a little bit different. Like, restaking and data availability are complimentary. Sludge may do its own restaking. Don't know. But, yeah, in terms of restaking providers, bitcoin, the hub, and Ethereum are all kind of like, options that are on the menu. And then there's also this mesh security system in cosmos. So you could do kind of bilateral restaking relationships between different chains.
01:02:45.822 - 01:02:56.284, Speaker E: And now the question is, why would you choose one versus the other? You know, it may not come down to, it may just be an economic.
01:02:56.364 - 01:03:02.104, Speaker D: Question, in which case maybe just go for the lowest cost of capital, but.
01:03:02.644 - 01:03:03.852, Speaker E: I think that these things are going.
01:03:03.868 - 01:03:06.764, Speaker D: To be kind of paired with economic.
01:03:06.844 - 01:03:15.384, Speaker E: Integrations and political integrations. Like, okay, we're going to do a partnership, and we're going to allow one another to slash each other's change under certain conditions.
01:03:16.484 - 01:03:20.444, Speaker D: And so you can hold each other accountable.
01:03:20.904 - 01:03:29.244, Speaker E: You can layer that in with a liquidity sharing agreement or some kind of direct utility that's offered by your app chain.
01:03:30.064 - 01:03:33.364, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, that's really interesting.
01:03:35.864 - 01:04:23.468, Speaker G: The two big themes that I'm seeing are rehypothecation of security, which ties directly into, as it really validates, no pun intended, kind of the ability for projects to then say, oh, wow, I can launch my chain. As we said at the beginning of the episode, when you talked about which type of project is suited to launch their own chain, I think that really lowers the cost or the hurdle to do that. And then IBC, I just see it as that kind of, I've always been of the mind of, it's going to be a multi chain world. And IBC, to me, when I first learned about it, was kind of that huge unlock that would allow you to connect pretty much anything. And so, of course, that took time and, you know, but, but nonetheless, I.
01:04:23.476 - 01:04:25.580, Speaker D: Mean, I think it's, to me, is.
01:04:25.612 - 01:05:31.364, Speaker G: One of the, perhaps the most important pieces of, of technology that exists out there because it ties directly into, no matter how you want to see it, whether you're a Solana moxie or you believe in Solana purely, or you believe in the l one, l two kind of construct, or there's no version where you would be critical or you wouldn't see the value that IBC delivers, no matter what camp you're at, because at the end of the day, it just creates a more seamless connectivity between any chain. And that's huge in my mind. So I really appreciate you guys bearing with us because, of course, we asked really basic questions. As you could tell, you know, my interactions always with the cosmos folks is I think you guys are probably one of the smartest communities out there. And so sometimes we try to level it down to us kind of lizard brains to really kind of understand it. But I guess what's the best way to keep tabs of the cosmos exist and what you guys are working on? I know we kind of didn't do that as much at the beginning, but where can we, where can we go? If we want to learn more about what both of you guys are building?
01:05:34.344 - 01:05:47.404, Speaker F: Follow us on Twitter I'muckmanster. Uchmanster and informal Systems is our company. And so, you know, we post regular blog updates there on all the things we're working on. Yeah.
01:05:49.264 - 01:05:50.324, Speaker E: Yeah. And I'm.
01:05:53.344 - 01:05:54.248, Speaker D: On Twitter.
01:05:54.376 - 01:06:14.424, Speaker E: If you want to play around with IBC as a user, I would recommend going to IBC. Fun, which is like a little demo website that we made to just do like transfers and swaps. You can onboard from ethereum there. And I mean, everybody in cosmos is super friendly. So just reach out, say hi, we can point to stuff.
01:06:14.924 - 01:06:18.904, Speaker B: Except for Ethan Buckman at 02:00 a.m. Over chessboard. I will tell you that much.
01:06:21.004 - 01:06:23.224, Speaker E: Monster. I wasn't friendly.
01:06:24.484 - 01:06:27.384, Speaker B: No, I just remember when they came to close down the bar.
01:06:28.564 - 01:06:35.904, Speaker G: Yeah, just one, one stat. Like, how big are your teams and are you hiring?
01:06:36.684 - 01:06:39.892, Speaker D: Yeah, Santa, you leave them at what I say.
01:06:39.908 - 01:06:40.984, Speaker B: You're looking for a job.
01:06:43.524 - 01:07:00.214, Speaker G: This has been a prolonged bear market. Ad dollars are not trickling down and kidding. No, I'm just, for me, it's like one of those, like, interesting stats because there's just some teams that are massive. You've never heard of them, but they're like, you know, 50 people, 100 people.
01:07:00.294 - 01:07:01.046, Speaker E: But I'm curious.
01:07:01.150 - 01:07:03.994, Speaker F: Yeah, we're like 50 people. I think a bit more.
01:07:04.494 - 01:07:05.390, Speaker D: There you go.
01:07:05.542 - 01:07:09.910, Speaker F: We are hiring a couple roles, so you can, you can check that out. Informal system slash careers.
01:07:09.982 - 01:07:10.686, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:07:10.870 - 01:07:11.262, Speaker D: Great.
01:07:11.318 - 01:07:11.942, Speaker G: How about you?
01:07:12.038 - 01:07:29.624, Speaker E: Skip is 15. We're also hiring some technical roles, but there's like eight ish core teams. And it really depends on what you consider core team in cosmos that vary from, you know, five people to 20.
01:07:29.664 - 01:07:44.084, Speaker D: People building different components. It's more of a kind of flat, flat system. There isn't the same kind of like Ethereum foundation and then everybody else.
01:07:44.124 - 01:07:49.944, Speaker E: It's just like everybody's in more of this, like, peer group doing development together.
01:07:50.844 - 01:07:55.708, Speaker B: Then you've just got one person at blockworks effort capital just putting in the work effort.
01:07:55.756 - 01:07:56.444, Speaker E: Oh, my God.
01:07:56.564 - 01:07:57.444, Speaker F: That's our plant.
01:07:57.524 - 01:07:58.464, Speaker E: Bless him.
01:08:01.244 - 01:08:03.064, Speaker B: That's the mole. He made it in.
01:08:04.324 - 01:08:04.844, Speaker D: Hey, guys.
01:08:04.884 - 01:08:17.712, Speaker G: Well, this has been really great. We'll link to IBC. I'm definitely going to to check that out because I think that's a huge eye opener. But I really appreciate you guys coming on and talking about this stuff and bearing with our very basic line of questioning.
01:08:17.848 - 01:08:18.272, Speaker F: It was great.
01:08:18.288 - 01:08:25.364, Speaker G: Hopefully we can have you guys back on and talk about more of the developments as they transpire the next couple six to a month.
01:08:25.744 - 01:08:27.484, Speaker F: Thanks, guys. Thanks for having us.
01:08:28.624 - 01:08:29.944, Speaker G: Thanks so much for coming on.
01:08:30.064 - 01:08:30.544, Speaker D: Hey, everyone.
01:08:30.624 - 01:08:53.500, Speaker A: Thank you so much for watching today's episode. Really hope you enjoyed it. We wanted to take a second to, to just remind you about our upcoming digital asset summit in London, March 18 to 20th. Santi and I got your back. Seats are limited and we hooked you up with a 20% off discount code. It is Empire 20. If you heard it earlier in the podcast, there's a little competition running at blockworks to see who can drive the most number of tickets.
01:08:53.500 - 01:08:57.380, Speaker A: So when you register for the digital asset summit, make sure you use our code.
01:08:57.452 - 01:08:58.460, Speaker B: Empire 20.
01:08:58.532 - 01:09:01.784, Speaker A: See you in London. I.
