00:00:00.280 - 00:00:28.274, Speaker A: Thought we could start off from a very high level here, kind of like I was just saying, we've talked a lot about how there's a lot going on outside of our little crypto bubble, right. In the macro world, we hear a lot about inflation, we hear a lot about central banking, we hear a lot about interest rates, currency debasement, et cetera. And obviously, there's been a lot of pain recently in crypto, but also in broader markets as well. So maybe we could just start off from a really high level. And Dan, I could pick on you here to kick us off. What's your kind of high level macro framework? What do you think is going on out there in the world right now?
00:00:28.604 - 00:00:31.476, Speaker B: Well, that's a pretty broad question.
00:00:31.540 - 00:00:33.064, Speaker A: Yeah, I set you up. Yeah.
00:00:33.484 - 00:01:14.398, Speaker B: All right. Macro framework. Well, obviously, right now, with the fed being very focused on, I mean, I guess it's inflation, but I think really they've entered a phase now where there's going to be pretty serious demand destruction. And so they're using a very blunt instrument, which is the interest rate tool, and they're not even really using it. They've been jawboning, I think, the market to a place that is unrealistic. And so if you look at the first quarter Fed funds futures right now, today, it's priced in at 3%. And so we have a 1% funds rate.
00:01:14.398 - 00:01:51.914, Speaker B: And if we're going to three by Q one, it is priced by the market. That means they're going to raise another 200 basis points. So if they do that, I mean, I think the markets will be down massively. I do not think that's going to happen. So I think what will happen is that they'll move, they'll shift their focus and their bias after three months of two to three months of obviously negative economic and inflation data. So I think we've peaked at inflation already. I think there are early signs that the growth numbers are going to be significantly lower in the coming six months.
00:01:51.914 - 00:02:31.332, Speaker B: And you can see it in the bond market. The bond market has started to, I mean, at least it's trying to bottom around here, which I think it is. I mean, I don't own any bonds. I haven't for many years. This is the first time in at least five or six years where I think if you're nervous about your equity exposure, you can own some bonds and some gold as your hedge. So in an environment where the interest rates have sort of, the market interest rates have stopped going up, I think that will also be broadly supportive for crypto generally. So that's how I would frame it.
00:02:31.332 - 00:02:37.060, Speaker B: So slower growth being positive, and I think that's coming. And you're already seeing it in China and Europe.
00:02:37.172 - 00:02:57.604, Speaker A: So is that good for those in the audience as well? Can you explain why? What's the connection between higher interest rates and why certain sectors of the economy tend to get really whacked? Right, like, crypto is down 50 or 60% from the highs? You're seeing some, like, growthy sort of tech stocks. Why, when interest rates go up, why do we see those particular sectors just get better?
00:02:58.704 - 00:03:51.812, Speaker B: Whoever liquidity, that's all it is. And, you know, when the Fed has a posture that's aggressive, let's just say, and they jawbone or push the market through their comments and speeches to pricing a certain outcome, you know, liquidity gets removed. And you also see that in the dollar, when the dollar is strong, that means liquidity in the US is tighter than it is in other places. And so you've had the yen at 130 and the euro at 104. You know, this is the strongest the dollar has been in a very long time. I think that's starting to reverse a little bit because the market, sensing that the asset markets are at a place where things are beginning to break. And I think I put something out on Twitter yesterday, the Empire manufacturing index.
00:03:51.812 - 00:04:13.834, Speaker B: And again, listen, I don't do macro at all now. Honestly, I'm 100% in the crypto world. But so, you know, I don't follow the data as closely as I used to. But this empire manufacturing index, this is for May. It's always the first data point for May. It dropped 32 points and is now below zero in one month. Okay.
00:04:13.834 - 00:04:46.204, Speaker B: We've only seen that kind of drop in this index in the COVID March 20, COVID, it's much worse than zero eight. And this tends to be a leading indicator, and I think you'll start to see more of these leading indicators. And then when it's super duper obvious, the Fed will say, all right, maybe we don't need funds at 3%, and then there'll be a view in the markets that liquidity won't be as tight in the future. So you got to let somebody else talk now.
00:04:46.584 - 00:05:01.638, Speaker A: All right, zooming out even. Maybe even a little further than what you're talking about here, Dan. Bill, you did a great episode on jason's podcast, Empire. Talking about kind of long term here, what's really happening. Short term debt cycle. Long term debt cycle. And what that means for the economy.
00:05:01.638 - 00:05:08.862, Speaker A: You've got a really great framework that I think helps even put this recent sell off into context. Would you mind just going into that, giving the audience an understanding?
00:05:08.918 - 00:05:29.854, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. Look, I mean, post Bretton woods, the victors went to spoils. That was us. The dollar became the reserve currency in 71. Everything changed. We all know why. And now I think we're in a very late stage debt cycle vis a vis, you know, that post World War Two era.
00:05:29.854 - 00:06:37.500, Speaker C: I think we're in for a lot of pain, but I still think in the short term the bond rates will come back down. So this kind of macro thesis that the bond market is just going to fall off a cliff, I don't buy it in the very short term. I think the bigger macro problem that we have right now is that when you, after post canceling Russia, right, February 26 or whatever that day was, will be the day of infamy because that was the day that the mark, certain countries realized that they could basically be completely shut off from the US banking system. So working backwards from that, I think it's going to create a long term structural problem where the cost of us debt is going to either have to go up, which means we're going to have to absorb significant pain at some point. Right. Or, you know, the Federal Reserve continues to become the buyer of first resorts, which is what they've been for the last, you know, I don't know what, how many years, basically since the end of the decade. Right.
00:06:37.500 - 00:07:12.334, Speaker C: Petrodollar. Right, exactly. And that's going to break eventually because effectively, from everybody else's perspective, our debt will become worthless and the only people that will buy it will be the banks because, because they're forced to buy it. And so I think the question becomes, okay, what happens for the next two years? I think we're in recession already. And the fed is a trailing indicator pretty much on everything now because they just, I'm sorry, but they basically just lie because it's easier to basically keep people at bay. And as opposed to like, you know, like Trump would say, we don't want to panic. Well, that's ridiculous.
00:07:12.334 - 00:07:49.356, Speaker C: But I'm pretty sure we're in recession now. And I think they're going to basically decide, hey, okay, the bond markets did for us and the oil markets did for us what we wouldn't do for ourselves. Okay, so, okay, great. Fastest credit tightening in history to my knowledge. And they're going to have no choice but to basically say, oh, we got to pause and watch what's happening here. And I think when that happens, it could be really, like, game on at that point, because then everybody, you know, the institute, institutional investors are going to realize, okay, it's back to don't fight the fed again. Whether that happens in July or August or September, I don't really know.
00:07:49.356 - 00:08:37.174, Speaker C: I don't really care, but I don't see how it doesn't happen. And the only question is, how much pain are they willing to inflict before they do that? And then the longer term question becomes, like I said, how do we deal with the fact that these debt cycles? And Dalio is the master at explaining this and his new book is found. Fantastic. If you really, especially if you're into the data, how do you get out of these long term debt cycles without basically what has happened for hundreds of years, unfortunately, which is war. And we can see this playing out again. Finland basically is now saying it is no longer safe for us to not be in NATO, and hours later, Russia's expelling finnish diplomats. This is scary stuff.
00:08:37.174 - 00:09:35.124, Speaker C: And so now the question becomes, is it all playing out again the way it's played out for a few hundred years, or does this global movement towards decentralization, which has been happening in parallel, in my opinion, for the last 40 years, culminate in a way out of this mess? Because we can basically eliminate centralized trust, which has been the backbone of the problem for hundreds of years, because everybody keeps saying the same thing over and over again. Trust us, we're going to make sound money. And at the beginning it looks great, and eventually they say, you know, it's still sound money, but the basis for the sound money is just going to be your trust, and that is that human frailty injected into the system has been the problem for literally 500 years. Does crypto and the crypto model do DeFi, which we're supposed to talk about here, and bitcoin as potentially pristine collateral, represent a way out of that. And that's what's really exciting about this space to me.
00:09:36.504 - 00:10:06.102, Speaker A: Help me make that concrete. Let's connect these, because there's this enormous problem that's building up in the system, debt driven system. We have too much debt. The economy is essentially levered to the debt, which has led to low interest rates, asset bubbles, all this kind of wacky stuff that we're seeing, and we talk about this idea of, especially in crypto, sometimes I think we're guilty of saying decentralization will solve all of this. Right? That's our way out. That's our silver bullet, our problem. Help me connect these two ideas of decentralization and how that could potentially be a solution to everything that we're seeing in the macro landscape.
00:10:06.278 - 00:10:33.206, Speaker C: Sure, I'll go first. I'm sure everybody has an opinion. I think, look, to me, silver bullet means potentially solution, but I don't think there's any way out of the pain. Right. I mean, you look at Japan as a guide, and basically they went through, what, 30 years of deflation to basically deal. They took the pain, but that's a different culture. We have a very difficult time getting our arms around short term pain in the United States.
00:10:33.206 - 00:11:02.484, Speaker C: Right. And so I think that there's no way to avoid the pain that's coming. It's simply a question of what happens at the end of that pain. And I think we end up with a more fragmented world. I don't think you end up with a model which is just a single global reserve currency anymore. I think you end up with yuan, you end up with the dollar, and you probably end up with crypto. And gold is like a transitionary asset.
00:11:02.484 - 00:11:38.900, Speaker C: That could be ten years, it could be 15 years. I don't know. But I think a lot of countries, and I don't know how many people here have been paying attention, but 45 countries met this week, and with a primary topic being bitcoin adoption as a reserve asset. Now, the GDP of these 45 countries in the aggregate is very low. But the fact that they're even having this discussion is astounding. Right? I mean, it's incredible. It was a premise of a talk I gave eleven years ago when bitcoin was trading at $2 and everybody laughed.
00:11:38.900 - 00:11:53.034, Speaker C: And now 45 countries are meeting to have that discussion. So I still think it's seven to ten years out from a macro perspective at least. But we have a way out.
00:11:53.894 - 00:11:58.462, Speaker A: I want to Munir and Christine start calling on you for some of these as well. One.
00:11:58.558 - 00:12:42.634, Speaker D: Sorry, sorry. Actually, just to add to Bill's point, I think, at least from my perspective, the key takeaway is market volatility ahead in the next few months, given all of the uncertainty and the macroeconomic headwinds, I think as a builder, as an investor company, if you're not already fiscally responsible, which I'm sure you are, it's time to batten down the hatches and just be ready for anything. We hope that it's, we will find our ways out of the situation, but there is certainly risk of recession or as Bill said, could already be in one. So I think that would just be the key takeaway from my perspective.
00:12:43.014 - 00:13:13.474, Speaker A: Great reminder. Yeah, absolutely. When it comes to decentralization. A lot of people in. Bill, you were just saying about bitcoin, the need for sound money, something that people can actually store their value and not have it be worried about getting debased. One other interesting thing that you said in a date that you pulled out was when the United States seized some $400 billion worth of assets from Russia's central bank as being a very important thing. And I think sound money is one part of what we need, but also we need this decentralized financial infrastructure as well to accompany that sound money.
00:13:13.474 - 00:13:29.254, Speaker A: Munir, maybe I could call on you here as the founder of decentralized exchange, when you think about why DeFi is important, why we need this way to transfer value that's not beholden to any one country bank, et cetera. What's your framework for why we need that?
00:13:30.184 - 00:14:11.244, Speaker E: Well, I think the reason why we have crypto in the first place is to create a separation between value and any kind of centralized control. So decentralized exchanges is a continuation of that philosophy. It's not just about the decentralization of the asset itself, but the usage and the exchange of that value should be neutral, should not be under the control of any centralized party. So that's why decentralized exchanges took off in the last two, three years. So I think that's the main approach. Is this separation of value, value exchange on top of value holding?
00:14:12.184 - 00:14:43.610, Speaker A: Absolutely. Christine, I could poke you here just as a representative, having previously worked at large bank JP Morgan, now working at starting at Apollo, congratulations on the new role. I mean, how do banks kind of look at DeFi? Because there's this funny contradiction. We talked yesterday about DeFi having this huge potential for disrupting banks. But also, when you explain DeFi to people in the banking system, they're kind of like, oh, yeah, I understand this. So, like, how, you know, how do people kind of inside the banking system, the more institutional part of the market, how are they looking at DeFi? Decentralized financial infrastructure?
00:14:43.722 - 00:16:13.282, Speaker D: Yeah, you know, I think from my time, you know, running blockchain and crypto at J. Morgan in the past half decade and seeing how this space has evolved, essentially, when Defi summer and now the next generations of DeFi that we're watching emerged, I was basically running around, waving my arms around like, this is crazy. Everybody needs to pay attention to this right now, because this is incredibly more disruptive than we might think it could be. And the reason why is because I think what's really interesting is that with DeFi, essentially what you're able to do is do all of the functions that a large financial institution may be able to do, like FX, market making, price discovery, margin management, and collateral management, secured loans, et cetera, in what's prominently been emerging, but all with a close to zero, if not zero, cost basis with like, a few lines of code. Right? And these are functions, having been inside large financial institutions, these are functions that take hundreds, if not thousands of people to support multiple systems. And it's definitely not, you know, it would be disruptive in that way. If, for example, everybody's talked about the DeFi mullet.
00:16:13.282 - 00:17:31.604, Speaker D: If, for example, an enterprising fintech or a neo bank would basically be a regulated entity, that would be the face of using this DeFi protocol backend as an example, because essentially these entities would be competing at a much lower cost basis than some of the established institutions that have already their technology and operations built out. And then furthermore, and bitcoin and crypto as an asset class is definitely disruptive. But I would say that if you're a trader at a bank, you kind of can navigate the market infrastructure that has emerged around bitcoin. It looks actually quite similar to FX or commodities in that there's the futures markets, there's ETF, there's spot, there's options. And so I think that from a large financial legacy of financial institution perspective, there's probably, like, a less clear path on how to navigate, what to do with DeFi, how to play in DeFi, what is our role if and when this emerges to be a thing versus being able to interact in crypto markets at large that are more mature. So, yeah, I mean, and the thing is, it's moving so fast. Fast.
00:17:31.604 - 00:18:06.418, Speaker D: And the reason why, obviously, I don't need to tell you guys the reason why it's moving so fast. You guys are moving really fast. But the idea is, basically, there are three reasons, at least from my trad five perspective. First, it's all open source code. Second, it's multi threaded innovation. So hundreds of teams around the world working on or able to draw from each other's code, or be able to work on each other's projects and kind of compound each of the DeFi Lego blocks on top of each other. And then third, tested with real money.
00:18:06.418 - 00:18:41.110, Speaker D: Now, let's think about how financial innovation used to happen before all of this used to be. Closed source at a bank would definitely have a secret lab where we're developing our proprietary technology. And no, you cannot see it highly protected and top secret, and definitely can't have any competitors know about it. Right, so it was closed source, then it's like single threaded. Right. Because if you don't tell anyone what you're working on, then people can't contribute ideas to it, you can't innovate. Like, it's just basically like waterfall type thinking, right? It's like, oh, this one team thinks this.
00:18:41.110 - 00:19:31.254, Speaker D: And so now we're going to just like, build upon what we're already thinking, as opposed to collecting the ideas from the world. And then the third thing is, if it's not fully baked and you haven't gotten 100 approvals from risk compliance, legal, cyber, ten times over, then you're definitely not going to put any real money in it and you're not going to have any clients using it. Whereas I think it's almost like a feature and not a bug, that some of these protocols are being tested with real money. It hurts. And we hope that everyone that is involved in the market knows what the risks are, that something that could be in the billions can go to zero in days. Hopefully. If that's not clear, it's clear now, but that is actually what contributes to the exponential speed of innovation that we're seeing.
00:19:31.254 - 00:19:40.374, Speaker D: And so it's quite difficult for a large regulated institution to even be able to participate in that.
00:19:41.154 - 00:20:26.866, Speaker A: And yet, despite how difficult it is, you can tell there's desire from these institutions to participate in DeFi, unlock some of that value, even if regulatory constraints don't make it possible today. Guys, there's a very clear line, I feel like, in between the macro driver for bitcoin and kind of like money printing, right? It was the money printer go, brrrr. Meme. It was a bit of a joke, but honestly, in people's minds, it forged this very simple association. When the money printer goes brrrr, and the fed is printing and adding liquidity, then that's good for bitcoin. I feel like in Defi, we still need to flesh out. What is that narrative? When you guys look at the space, what are some of the things that stand out to you macro drivers? Maybe it's yield, maybe it's when assets get seized on a basis globally.
00:20:26.866 - 00:20:33.574, Speaker A: What are some of those signpost things in your mind that say, ooh, that should lead to more adoption for DeFi?
00:20:34.274 - 00:21:04.724, Speaker C: We're one of the largest users of DeFi as a centralized instance institution. And I can give you in the trenches perspective, that's both good and bad. Right? You know, we also do. We have our collateralized lending business to institutions, retail and miners is much bigger than our DeFi positions, but we spend an outsized amount of time, I mean, order of magnitude more time on risk relative to the DeFi positions than we do on the lending positions. Not that we. I mean, our risk management models for the lending is. Are very clear.
00:21:04.724 - 00:21:48.060, Speaker C: There's not a lot of room for interpretation in most of those discussions. But as it relates to DeFi, it's 24/7 no borders. Sometimes we're coming out of positions at 02:00 a.m. On a Saturday night, and that's the way it goes. And we have clients who use Abra earn to earn yield, which is an amalgamation of all these things that we're doing, you know, that we're very transparent about. And they'll say, oh, you know, I have a lot of money in earn, but I'm thinking about putting some money in Tera Luna, and this happened a lot in q one. You know, what is your take on this? And I would never give an opinion to them directly on terra Luna because it's not my job.
00:21:48.060 - 00:22:45.234, Speaker C: But I would say, here's what we do to assess risk, right? And all of my money is in this product. All my liquid cash is in this product. Here's what we do to assess risk. Are you in a position to do this for yourself? And if you're testing it with 1% or a half a percent of your assets, okay, but if you're going to use this as a bank account, which is what I heard over and over again, and I'm saying to myself, okay, no, a bank account has risk management processes. It should be hard to do the things you're talking about as a bank. And at least for us, as a regulated lender and paying interest through a trust, the risk management processes need to be commensurate with the actions that we're taking. And the average consumer, even the average techie in this room who's writing the contracts, can't do that.
00:22:47.214 - 00:23:07.434, Speaker A: It's funny, there's an irony. I remember a year ago, all these yields in crypto are very high, and everyone would always ask, where are all these high yields coming from? And all the more trad five folks in the space would say, these yields aren't sustainable. And all these crypto people would say, oh, these boomers, they don't think the yields are sustainable. A year later, it turns out many of the yields weren't sustainable, honestly.
00:23:07.594 - 00:23:47.104, Speaker B: Well, that's not exactly true. I mean, the very high yield stuff. But, I mean, anyone who's rational would say, look, if I have a 15 or 20% yield, there's some risk there, but the seven, 8% on stable coins that you can get pretty much anywhere, or six to eight on bitcoin, stablecoins, it's been pretty stable, I would say. And I think it's largely really straightforward. There's a capital shortage in the space and borrowing. For someone in the space to borrow at seven or 8%, given the returns that are available in the space, it's very reasonable. And that's the cost of funding innovation.
00:23:47.104 - 00:24:01.620, Speaker B: And so, I mean, I see it in our world and, you know, there really isn't enough capital to fund all the growth that's coming. So that's why the yields are higher. And I think the yields stay high.
00:24:01.692 - 00:24:05.704, Speaker C: For a long time and the banks won't service those.
00:24:06.124 - 00:24:12.648, Speaker B: Yeah. And they don't have the skill set to, you know, even understand why. I mean, this is a very simple.
00:24:12.696 - 00:24:23.952, Speaker D: Explanation, but I don't have to disagree. Definitely understand this. Like, definitely have the skillset to understand why, but just not well positioned to action on it or participate in it.
00:24:24.008 - 00:24:42.696, Speaker C: Or being explicitly told you can't lend to a miner even with 120% collateral. Right. Because we don't recognize bitcoin. And by the way, those of you who've ever taken, tried to take out a mortgage and are holding a lot of crypto, it's no different. Right. What's happening at the institutional lending level is exactly what's happening to you if you're holding crypto and you're trying to get a mortgage.
00:24:42.800 - 00:24:48.964, Speaker B: But, yeah, hold on. Also, I would say if they had the skillset like you, they would leave.
00:24:51.744 - 00:25:00.016, Speaker D: Hold on a second, hold on, hold on, hold on a second. Hold on a second. I'm still staying in trad fight, y'all, though. I'm staying in Trad fight. Someone's got it. Someone's got to fight the good fight from the traditional fight.
00:25:00.040 - 00:25:14.274, Speaker B: Not really. I mean, JP Morgan and Apollo are very different entities. One is a risk taking entity that seeks high returns on their capital. JPMorgan is just a large bank.
00:25:18.774 - 00:26:36.362, Speaker D: Anyway, so on my move to Apollo, I'm super excited to join. So those of you who are not familiar with Apollo, Apollo Global Management is a half a trillion dollar alternatives asset manager that basically has a variety of different businesses. Private equity, credit, credit markets recently has also built retirement services, insurance, low cost of balance sheet, and very entrepreneurial, fast moving culture. And, yeah, so basically I'm joining as a partner to run their digital asset strategy, hoping to build our practice alongside the different businesses that I mentioned. Really excited because you know, will have the opportunity to invest in this ecosystem. But furthermore, you know, I'm like enterprise blockchain queen over here, still trying to realize my dreams of building real world use cases in the crypto ecosystem. So, you know, it's kind of like a take two with like a different approach and a different platform and, you know, different resources to essentially be able to figure out what are the best projects, protocols, and teams that can enable us tech, enable us to be asset manager of the future.
00:26:36.362 - 00:26:54.394, Speaker D: So holler at me if you got something good. But, you know, I think the key thing is, you know, real world use cases. You know, we play in a variety of space spaces. You know, if you think of blockchain as a ledger of assets, all we got are assets. And so, you know, super excited to, you know, see where this next chapter goes.
00:26:55.454 - 00:26:57.554, Speaker A: Ben's smiling like, thanks for team me up.
00:26:58.214 - 00:27:00.550, Speaker B: You're in crypto now. That's what I heard.
00:27:00.622 - 00:27:02.126, Speaker D: I've been in crypto. I've been in crypto.
00:27:02.150 - 00:27:03.834, Speaker E: I mean, you're deep now.
00:27:04.134 - 00:27:06.214, Speaker B: You're going to start getting a lot of.
00:27:06.374 - 00:27:09.594, Speaker D: Yeah, I'm with it. I got it. I got it.
00:27:11.454 - 00:27:30.474, Speaker A: Guys. How important are those higher yields into drawing capital into the space? Right? I mean, cause on the one hand, right, six or 7% doesn't take a genius is better than the whatever, two or 3% or whatever it is in tradfi. But we haven't really seen that kind of mass exodus of capital moving into.
00:27:30.594 - 00:28:21.782, Speaker C: To seek this yield. So I would say from our perspective, like, if you were to ask our private client services sales team, the yields that we're able to generate, to Dan's point, definitely get us into discussion. The risk management keeps them. And when we're getting a net inflow in the last week or so, when everybody else is getting a net outflow, they're saying, okay, what are you doing differently here? Why are there no losses? And, well, it's what we've been telling you all along. There's adults in the room that are actually analyzing risk, reading smart contract code, saying, if you're paying 20% and doing no lending, right, you're basically printing money in order to pay that yield. And so that's what people want to understand at scale. So, yeah, there's a lot of places where you can go to earn 8% on dollar stables right now.
00:28:21.782 - 00:28:53.882, Speaker C: And that's great. But the question is, if you're going to use this in a banking model, what are the risk management processes and how are you using DeFi? I believe that the biggest banks in the world are going to be DeFi based in 15 years. I mean, biggest market cap banks in the world. And I'm actually almost 100. I wouldn't say 100%, but as positive with that sentiment as I can be without leaving room for, like, you know, some crazy next gen thing that I haven't thought of yet. Right. And.
00:28:53.882 - 00:29:00.334, Speaker C: But still. Right. How are you analyzing this stuff? How are you making decisions on where to allocate?
00:29:01.434 - 00:29:47.600, Speaker D: Yeah. And so just to build onto what you're saying, you know, Bancorp know, your company or not, there definitely needs to be. If we want to get to the next generation of users, there definitely needs to be this layer of, like, risk management or education abstracting the complexity and, you know, probably, like, curation and security are probably, like, the most important things. Right. I mean, right now we're kind of in this cambrian explosion of, you know, new stuff is getting built. So, you know, it's not been battle tested, but, you know, if we're talking, like, a few years out, there are going to be protocols already starting to be, like, battle tested and all survived and will be like, okay. And then obviously, you know, hopefully more eyes and more money will mean more auditing and more testing and risk management.
00:29:47.600 - 00:30:11.910, Speaker D: And then at that point, maybe the role of a bank or a financial institution is to curate, what are these back end protocols and to, you know, clearly outline the risks related to the returns from this menu of back end protocols or DeFi protocols that they've curated, and then kind of offer it as, like, in some sort of interface to clients, which sounds like what you guys are doing.
00:30:11.942 - 00:30:13.454, Speaker C: 100%. We agree with that.
00:30:13.534 - 00:30:14.990, Speaker D: Right. So perhaps.
00:30:15.062 - 00:30:16.598, Speaker C: And then we go one step further.
00:30:16.646 - 00:30:18.110, Speaker D: Which would be KyC AML, we would.
00:30:18.142 - 00:31:03.164, Speaker C: Give you real time access to core tenets of web three and decentralization. We won't do anything that doesn't give you real time access to be able to move your funds out of the banking system. And if you know what a ledger is, and a lot of our clients have heard of it, but they don't know how to use it, they can do that whether it's what we're doing now with yield or trading in the future with some of the stuff we're going to be announcing in nfts and whatnot, but they can take 100% control anytime they want. And to me, that's the bank of the future. Not necessarily that 100% of people are going to be using a ledger or whatever competitive device or metamask, but that they can, whenever they want to. So that's how we look at it.
00:31:03.244 - 00:31:55.696, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's the other important part of this. How many of you guys caught Josh Rosenthal's speech earlier on the first day? It was a really powerful analogy that he used about looking back in time, imagining yourself living in medieval ages, how you thought you were entirely free, but in reality, you owned really nothing. And I think everyone who's tried to explain crypto to people who aren't in the space have this frustration of saying those things that you think are your assets, are actually not your assets. And, I mean, look at two of the announcements that just happened at permissionless this week. Robinhood rolled out non custodial services, non custodial trading to their customer base, and Coinbase did the same. So Munir, as the operator of a decentralized exchange, maybe we can touch on this last kind of macro idea about the importance of people owning their own assets. Right, as opposed to a centralized exchange where you go and then you get an IOU people trade on.
00:31:55.696 - 00:31:59.208, Speaker A: I mean, talk to us a little bit about the importance of that and how you view it.
00:31:59.296 - 00:31:59.616, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:31:59.680 - 00:33:00.174, Speaker E: Our user base are mostly defi natives, so they worry. They care a lot about having control and optionality, and it makes a lot of difference for them to be able to make a transaction and immediately get access to the other party that they were trading instead of a binance or a centralized exchange where the only use case they go there is for fiat on ramp, on off ramp. So that's the only use case. So this is for the defi natives. But to build on top of what you guys were saying is this optionality that a user of a centralized service where they can have at any point of time access to their funds without any guarantee and also auditability of that code that is open source and can be seen by anyone. So that part, I think, makes a lot of difference and makes a confidence on the market and can bring new adoption that we may not have seen in centralized services.
00:33:01.234 - 00:33:02.042, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:33:02.138 - 00:33:54.382, Speaker A: So maybe to conclude here, we kind of started off with where we are in the current macro cycle. I'd love to get your thoughts on where we kind of go from here, crypto specific. So in the past, there's been a tremendous amount of importance around the bitcoin happening, which is a reduction in the supply schedule, and that kind of tends to anchor these four year, very predictable kind of boom bust cycles. There's a panel specifically on this later this afternoon, the verge of the merge, but there's an enormous thing happening with Ethereum which is the merge, and there's a drastic reduction in supply that's moving to proof of stake and all these other things. I'm curious, do you see everything in crypto right now's current bear market purely being a function of what's going on in the macro environment with interest rates, or are there internal catalysts that are happening, crypto specifically, that could actually bring us out of the current bear? Oh, you're smiling.
00:33:54.438 - 00:34:39.074, Speaker C: Yeah. Wow, that's a great question. So I would say a few things happening, right? I think the bitcoin peaked sooner than it otherwise would have if it wasn't for the China ban. I wouldn't be surprised if it had peaked in the eighties or nineties. I mean, obviously nobody knows, but that's, I think, reasonable assumption. I think there's a few things converging at once, right, with Ethereum, scalability post merge, potentially looking at charting out in the future. But the thing I'm really excited about that I think could be a catalyst is all the talk now about MPC and how to basically take MPC technology and make potentially applications that really hide key management complexity to real world use cases, both consumer and institutional.
00:34:39.074 - 00:35:17.914, Speaker C: And we're spending a lot of resources on this at Abra, and I'm really bullish on it. And I think Coinbase talked about it earlier this week, and I think Mike talked about it a few minutes ago. And so clearly there's a groundswell about people are starting to get it that, hey, wait a minute, there's actually a way here where you don't have to be a PhD in metamask to actually use nfts and or more importantly, ask a 15 year old what an MP3 is. They don't know what an MP3 is and so they just know music streaming. And I think that's where this is headed now. And there's some new technologies coming out that I think are going to bridge the divide where everybody could be using powerswap and not have to know it. And that's huge.
00:35:18.694 - 00:35:57.094, Speaker E: I think also crypto loves new narratives. So during the previous beer markets, DeFi was the new engine that maybe started or maybe not the new bull markets with compound launching farming that created a whole vague of new ideas. And also people discovered things that for the Defi community were obvious and followed by nfts. So I think new narratives maybe will come in in terms of bringing the masses and bringing the next billions of users into crypto that may create this new bull phase that may come in a few months.
00:35:58.914 - 00:36:39.558, Speaker B: I would just say, vis a vis defi. Obviously this Luna blow up has, I think, pushed off adoption certainly of people's comfort with yield generally on stable coins. Of course, people outside the space assume all stable coins are the same. So that's probably pushed off that massive institutional inflow, that exodus from the banking system you're talking about. But I mean, look, nfts were just started 18 months ago. I think that's probably an area that will boom in this sort of next cycle. I mean, some of the higher quality ones haven't really even dropped in price yet.
00:36:39.558 - 00:36:44.254, Speaker B: So yeah, I think that's probably.
00:36:46.514 - 00:36:46.826, Speaker C: An.
00:36:46.850 - 00:37:00.534, Speaker B: Important driver in the next cycle. But to be honest, I think it's really hard to know. The space is growing so quickly and so much innovation. So I bet, I mean, it could be something we're not even aware of yet.
00:37:01.514 - 00:37:02.834, Speaker D: It's like every day in crypto.
00:37:02.914 - 00:37:04.386, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
00:37:04.530 - 00:37:41.258, Speaker D: Yeah. And from my perspective, as I mentioned, definitely strapping in for volatility ahead in the broader macro. Markets, like people that just don't follow crypto markets just follow regular markets think that the next few months could be a little bit challenging and then we have our own idiosyncrasies. Like things happen, things happen around the corner that we don't expect. But that's cool. That's part of what we're here to do and part of what we're trying to build and trying to build quickly. And so I would say definitely just need to focus on staying in your lane.
00:37:41.258 - 00:38:54.718, Speaker D: If you're building something, build it, try to be, just try to survive and move forward and make progress. If you have exposure to the broader markets from your token, then probably time to work on what your treasury management looks like. And this is what companies do. If they have multi currency FX exposure, then they have to hedge some exposure or they have to manage it actively. Maybe not something that teams have started thinking about yet because you're all so young and usually that's something that mature companies get into, but something that you're going to have to learn faster and probably just try to navigate the uncertainty ahead. But the upside is in the last downturn of crypto, I feel like an old dinosaur all the way. Well, you know, back in the day, you know, in the last down cycle, like the companies that kept building heads down, really focused, really driven, eye on the prize, eye of the tiger, you know, shipped product, became the biggest companies of this cycle and it shook out a lot of the noise, it shook out a lot of the opportunists and, you know, the people that just came for the party.
00:38:54.718 - 00:39:00.072, Speaker D: And, you know, so there's a silver lining to market uncertainty.
00:39:00.208 - 00:39:47.172, Speaker B: You could also have something like lightning on bitcoin take off. I mean, the growth rate there has been huge. There are a lot of naysayers. But when you see, as you mentioned before, was mentioned before, 44 countries going to El Salvador, and I do think that the use case isn't really discussed in the emerging world, I mean, I keep reminding people this is not, not an american bet, right? The dollar is pretty much fine, and there are many countries out there that don't have proper monetary or fiscal policy or currency policy. So there's an intuitive understanding there about the value of bitcoin. And maybe it's something like lightning. I mean, again, we have to see what the uptake is.
00:39:47.228 - 00:40:11.816, Speaker A: But, you know, the other one that I would flag there, too, I mean, it's funny, on the same day that or the same couple of days that the lunaterra ecosystem was kind of imploding, Instagram announced that they were rolling out adoption for nfts. So, I mean, when people talk about when's the next billion users going to come to crypto, we know where the current billion users is. It's in web two. So how does that migration kind of make its way through? I think it's an interesting.
00:40:11.880 - 00:40:22.816, Speaker B: And you've had a lot of focus here on gaming, right? They're 2 billion plus gamers. And so there's that whole view that maybe that's the next whoosh of adoption.
00:40:22.880 - 00:40:24.000, Speaker A: So who knows?
00:40:24.072 - 00:40:25.484, Speaker B: It could be any one of them.
00:40:26.144 - 00:40:29.864, Speaker A: All right, guys, that's unfortunately all the time that we have. Guys, give them a big round of applause.
