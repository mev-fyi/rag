00:00:03.160 - 00:00:08.846, Speaker A: All right, everyone, we've got Rob Leshner from compound, who I think needs no introduction. Rob, welcome to Empire, my friend.
00:00:08.990 - 00:00:10.598, Speaker B: Yeah, excited to be on the show today.
00:00:10.726 - 00:00:13.094, Speaker A: Yeah, man. You going by Rob or Robert these days?
00:00:13.254 - 00:00:17.750, Speaker B: You know, I think I've always gone by Robert, but, you know, some friends call me Rob sometimes, so over.
00:00:17.782 - 00:00:19.274, Speaker A: Over some beers, it's Rob.
00:00:19.814 - 00:00:20.594, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:00:21.174 - 00:00:45.860, Speaker A: All right. All right. So I get the moral of the story. Call you Robert today. So anyways, Robert, we wanted to have you on the podcast because you sent out this tweet which said, make no mistake, the government wants to kill one of the most important and innovative segment, innovative segments of the US economy, which is crypto. We're coming on the back. And that tweet kind of comes on the back of signature closing sec, forcing Kraken to shut down, staking what else happened.
00:00:45.860 - 00:01:00.664, Speaker A: Coinbase as wells notice CFTC sued binance. It appears that Operation Choke .2.0 is here. So I think we just want to kick off this conversation and get your take on the. The backstory of this tweet and how you're feeling about things right now.
00:01:01.044 - 00:01:50.010, Speaker B: Yeah, and it's a great question. So that tweet was really an acknowledgement of what most of us in the industry are seeing and experiencing, which is Operation Choke. Point two. Point zero. At this point, it's almost not a controversial statement that there is a coordinated effort to debank the crypto industry through not entirely normal policy means or legislative means behind the scenes in a way that is not normal. Very similar to how operation 1.0 tried to debank a legal industry in a inappropriate approach.
00:01:50.010 - 00:03:05.324, Speaker B: And we're seeing that right now with crypto. You know, you mentioned both Silvergate and signature bank. These were the two primary us on and off ramps between the banking system and crypto. Both of these went from functional to non existent in an incredibly short amount of time, following statements by banking industry regulators to the banks, by legislators like Elizabeth Warren publicly, and by a number of actors in the ecosystem that were somewhat excited for these banks to fail and for their activities with crypto to no longer be functional. Besides all the things that have already been written, great examples of this are that even post failure, the entire banking apparatuses, um, of Silvergate, outside of crypto, or functioning normally, um, it's. Sorry, signature signature was sold to another bank and all of their customers, with the exception of crystal crypto customers, are up and running. All of the crypto customers were debanked in that process.
00:03:05.324 - 00:04:18.164, Speaker B: Both the signet payment system and the crypto balances were not restored, and the bank, having gone through a sale, transitioned from being one that served crypto companies to one that does not serve crypto companies. Silvergate, likewise is 100% offline for crypto companies. The Silvergate Exchange network and all financial services that they were providing are gone. And at this point, there's almost no mainstream supported infrastructure for legal institutions that interact with crypto to interact with banking system. Most of the economy has shifted over to cross river bank, which is just a single bank of not considerable size, which has become essentially the lone bridge between banking and crypto organizations. But pretty much the map was wiped clean in an incredibly short amount of time due to government action in an unanticipated way. So my tweet is really just an acknowledgement that there's an effort to debank crypto, and it's been, unfortunately, incredibly effective.
00:04:19.744 - 00:04:40.864, Speaker A: This episode of Empire is brought to you by quick node. Quicknode is an end to end blockchain development platform that makes building web3 apps super easy.

This episode is brought to you by synthetix, the liquidity layer for defi derivatives. With synthetix v three, any protocol can now tap into synthetix liquidity to bootstrap derivatives markets. You'll hear more about synthetix later in the show. This word unanticipated is an interesting word.
00:05:06.754 - 00:05:17.774, Speaker A: Were you expecting this at all? And if you were expecting it, how long did you feel like this was coming? And if not, it's interesting. This took everyone by surprise so much.
00:05:18.114 - 00:06:13.626, Speaker B: Well, this took everyone by surprise because in a lot of ways, this was an extrajudicial process. This didn't come through the legislative process where people had a chance to form policy. This didn't even come through like administrative policy. This came through behind the scenes actions that were taken in a short amount of time. And so I don't think anyone had the ability to anticipate that crypto would be debanked so quickly and so effectively. There was a lot of fear following the collapse of FTX that there would be strong actions taken against the industry as a response. But I don't think that most individuals within the industry anticipated that the attack against crypto would be so widespread and so rapid.
00:06:13.810 - 00:06:18.694, Speaker A: Yeah. Have you got any sense of the why behind this?
00:06:19.724 - 00:06:22.504, Speaker B: I mean, anyone's guess is as good as mine. I don't have any.
00:06:23.164 - 00:06:27.740, Speaker A: You don't want to put on your tinfoil hat with me and start to get into some of the theories?
00:06:27.852 - 00:07:24.730, Speaker B: Well, I mean, I think the simplest theory is that following the collapse of FTX, this provided a justification that people that were already biased against crypto had, and this gave them the justification that they were looking for. Simply put, I think it made the timing easier to attack crypto. And so why do people want to shut down a legitimate industry? It's hard to say. There's a lot of aspects of crypto that are extremely positive and I think in the long term, best interest of regulators, of policymakers of our economy, and of, you know, all financial markets. And so it just, in my opinion, it was just like, coincidental timing, but I think it's a reaction more than anything to FTX.
00:07:24.922 - 00:07:40.514, Speaker A: Yeah. How has this impacted your guys product strategy at compound? Because, I mean, we were following the compound treasury launch pretty closely and, like, the build out of that. I'm just curious how you think about those kind of products in the wake of, like, a US regulatory crackdown.
00:07:40.894 - 00:08:21.678, Speaker B: Yeah. So compound treasury was envisioned as this bridge for institutions to access defi, going through a compliant central counterparty and having a middle layer between institutions and Defi. So this has been announced elsewhere. So it's not like breaking news, but at compound labs, we have been in the process of shutting down compound treasury. Um, you know, it's a function of multiple things. One, the business climate has shifted. Um, the idea of using a, you know, middle layer between you and a smart contract doesn't look as appealing as it did before the collapse of FTX.
00:08:21.678 - 00:09:04.944, Speaker B: You know, there was a time when institutions wanted to interact through a counterparty, but I think now everyone is unbelievably, you know, skittish about custody of their assets and having any layers that are unnecessary make less sense. Today. It's really a market reaction more than anything else. But we are shuttering the compound treasury product, which is a small amount of collateral damage and just a very meaningful shift in market structure. But it's really just a result of institutions and their preferences changing in the wake of massive exchange failures.
00:09:05.884 - 00:09:13.292, Speaker A: You remember the DeFi, mullet, fintech in the front, defi in the back. You make me think that that might have been the wrong thesis here, actually.
00:09:13.468 - 00:09:48.544, Speaker B: Well, I think long term, the Defi mullet might be like a really strong thesis, which is you're gonna have transparent, autonomous protocols on the bottom and institutions that are like business forward and serious on top. But really the question is what's in the middle and how does that work? And, you know, long term, I do think the Defi mullet is going to win. It's going to be a viable theory. And you know, we're just going to have to as a society like figure out how to deliver the benefits of Defi to a wider, more institutional audience.
00:09:48.704 - 00:10:02.324, Speaker A: Yeah, it's also just a tough business. The aggregator business model is also just a tough business model. It provides a lot of value to users. If you think about the DeX aggregators, really a lot of value to users, but just a crappy business model.
00:10:02.864 - 00:10:49.550, Speaker B: Yeah, it's one of the things we found. I mean, it was not a successful business, but that's also just a function of the macro interest rate environment. So one of the really big trends that's happened over the last year is interest rates and tradfi have eclipsed interest rates in Defi. And one of the symptoms of that are banks like SVB blowing up, that just took too much interest rate risk. But the other is that you don't have people trying to grab Defi interest rates as much as they were before. They're much more willing to say, let me grab those t bills, as opposed to grabbing Defi interest rates. And so that's really the other macro shift.
00:10:49.550 - 00:11:19.364, Speaker B: When you combine these two things like extremely skittish and less trusting of any counterparty, even ones that are as credible as you can get. Compound treasury was rated by S and P Global, a rating agency. It was designed to be as good of a counterparty as you could have. Plus this macro shift, it means that middle layers between institutions in DeFi are just kind of have to rethink how they go about things.
00:11:19.664 - 00:11:42.576, Speaker A: Yeah, been thinking a lot about that. Like what pulls basically what pulled people into DeFi was, I mean, kind of in part, you guys kicking it off with like kicking off Defi summer. And then people kind of came for the token incentives and kind of the games almost, you could say, and they stayed for the yield. What do you think pulls people back into DeFi? And then what is that the same thing that gets them to stick?
00:11:42.760 - 00:12:18.864, Speaker B: Well, this is a long term statement. This is not like a short term statement. Like I only really think about like things in the five year, ten year sense. The things that are going to pull people back into DeFi I actually think, are the virtues of DeFi that are being brought to the surface by all of this calamity. The virtues of DeFi are that you don't have this opacity, which has led to a lot of problems. That's the first major thing that's going to pull people back to DeFi. The second is going to be the automation and the composability of DeFi.
00:12:18.864 - 00:13:04.420, Speaker B: This is like, it's going to go full circle. And these are really og statements. But the things that are going to pull people back to DeFi are the benefits of self custody. You're not going to have to trust an exchange to be lying to you or not, or telling the truth about how many assets they hold. FTX was such, this glaring example of you really can't trust what they say versus defi, where it's, you can validate yourself or pretty much any, like, you know, trained person on their own can validate, you know, the balances of a defi system or the health of the defi system in real time. Like compare those two things. It's like take their word for it or validate it yourself if you don't have to be afraid that you're being lied to.
00:13:04.420 - 00:13:43.284, Speaker B: It's an incredibly powerful thing. And so I think like DeFi is superior to c five there. Okay. The second thing that's going to pull people back is automation. This is a cost argument, but DeFi works 24/7 autonomously with no real managers or upkeep. Compare that to a CFI, anything. Long term, I think autonomous smart contracts just on their own are going to be seen as just a much better tool for implementing financial markets than how financial markets and products are implemented today.
00:13:43.284 - 00:14:35.084, Speaker B: It costs literally nothing for the smart contract behind uniswap or makerdao or compound or whatever to operate. It's truly unfathomably awesome. And that autonomous nature of it is a huge magnet for developers and markets. Over time, just the amount of effort that has to go into maintaining legacy markets, from reconciliation to accounting to all of these things, it's just horrendous. Automation is going to be a second thing that just pulls people back. Over time, we might see it in interesting ways. I can imagine a distant future people will choose to purchase an asset in DeFi over the other one because just the upkeep is less operational.
00:14:35.084 - 00:15:43.854, Speaker B: And the last thing that I think is going to pull people back into DeFi is composability. And there's a network effect to composability that you don't often get in traditional markets. If you're a customer of e trade, what's happening at fidelity doesn't really matter to you or doesn't really benefit you. But when you're in DeFi, what's happening at uniswap benefits from the changes that are happening in maker now, or benefits from the changes happening, or benefits from everything else that's getting built, because it's all interoperable in a way that CFI and tradfi are completely siloed. If you have a balance at Coinbase, it really doesn't matter what Gemini is doing because you can't use them together. But when you have your own balance in DeFi, you benefit from all improvements to the different applications platforms in parallel. And so that's a really powerful feature that is this hidden tailwind behind everything that I just think develops a network effect that gets better over time.
00:15:43.854 - 00:16:09.808, Speaker B: Eventually, people are going to be, you know, coming back to Defi in full force. It's not about games, it's not about, you know, whatever. Like, you know, momentary thing, like the virtues of it are so strong that eventually Defi is going to win. And I think that all of the calamity of late is just reinforcing of that fact. It makes me more confident about the virtues of Defi.
00:16:09.936 - 00:17:01.812, Speaker A: Let me ask you this then, do you? There's kind of like two views for like, mass crypto adoption right now. There's, I'd call them like the bitcoin route and the ETH route. The ETH route is that you are spot on. Composability, faster, cheaper, composable systems will eventually build better products. And yeah, we're in a bear market, but eventually Defi is just a ten x better product than traditional capital markets, and that pulls people into the system and voila, we've built l three s on l, two s on ETH, and like, boom, amazing system. Um, that's what I'd call almost like the ETH view, um, and like the view of, I think, a lot of people right now. Then there's the view that's maybe come to the, to the front in like the last 30 days, which is the bitcoin view, which has kind of been quieter the last couple of years, which is, hey, maybe we, the system is actually kind of falling apart a little bit.
00:17:01.812 - 00:17:31.414, Speaker A: And, um, we do need a way to store capital and, like, places where there isn't collateral risk. And I think we kind of all saw the virtue of bitcoin in the last couple of weeks as people were trying to move capital outside of the traditional financial system. So I'm curious, like, do you think it's. Are you like, all eggs in one basket? It's going to be ETH. You're not worried about the system breaking, you just think better products will be built. You're like, all eggs in the bitcoin basket or like, a little bit of both these days.
00:17:31.754 - 00:18:25.072, Speaker B: Yeah, I would say I'm like 90 ten on this. Where I think in terms of a technology, I think the ability to build transparent, autonomous, composable financial systems is more powerful than the ability to have a censorship resistant financial asset. Long term, I think having a censorship resistant financial asset is awesome. It's so important. It's like, you know, the proof that creates everything else, but, you know, long term, it's relatively arbitrary, you know, that bitcoin will have value relative to everything else on earth. You know, I personally don't own any gold. Okay.
00:18:25.072 - 00:19:17.088, Speaker B: Not because, you know, I don't think gold is cool, but, like, I don't own any gold, but because it doesn't really do anything. It mostly just sits there and, you know, it's not that useful of an asset. I would much rather own a company or shares of companies than you would gold. And I think of bitcoin the same way, you know, if you need something that, you know, is, you know, truly just a financial asset that doesn't do anything. Bitcoin is great, and its properties as that are great, but I don't think, you know, having another, you know, just like financial asset is as important as the technology that proves out the programmability and transparency and autonomy of a whole new generation of finance, which long term, I think is going to be more valuable and more important.
00:19:17.136 - 00:20:01.884, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I would tend to agree with you there. I have a couple more questions on the regulatory side of things, and then I want to get your thoughts on some other stuff. I guess just like as a founder and as a builder of a protocol, when you see the US kind of cracking down on this, do you. And then you see circle looking to get regulated in France, and I think it was GEMini this week was announcing they're going to potentially launch derivatives in Europe, and Coinbase is leaning heavier into their european business. How do you think about weighing the pros and cons of operating this protocol that clearly the most powerful three letter agencies in the US are not fans of these days? And how do you think about, look, is it even worth it to build in the states right now?
00:20:02.304 - 00:20:22.240, Speaker B: Well, my advice to most founders now when they ask, my opinion is if they have the opportunity to build offshore, I encourage them to do so. At this point, the majority of my time is spent at robot ventures as an investor talking to founders and there's building offshore.
00:20:22.272 - 00:20:29.120, Speaker A: Robert, does that mean, like, you are living offshore? Does that mean your customer base, you are only targeting folks outside the US? What does that actually entail?
00:20:29.272 - 00:21:30.294, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it's all of the above. The best case scenario for founders building new things right now, unfortunately, and this is a massive unfortunately, I wish the reality was the opposite. But right now, if founders have the opportunity to live abroad and build abroad and organize their companies abroad, they should, simply because the US is unfortunately incredibly hostile to innovation within the cryptosphere right now. No matter how well intentioned organizations are, no matter how hard they try to comply, it really doesn't matter. When you look at circle and Coinbase and Gemini and all of these institutions that have hung their hat on compliance for years, they've been in the crosshairs. That should be all of the evidence that people need to know that there's an easier path. Right now, the best intentioned actors are being targeted.
00:21:30.294 - 00:22:27.814, Speaker B: It's not the frauds and the scams and the truly mal intentioned operators in the ecosystem, the best intentioned, most compliant organizations that are being targeted, which is generally not how the rule of law works or should work, but it's the reality. And so I think most innovation is going to start occurring offshore. It's clearly detrimental to the long term interests of the United States. It's unfortunate. I wish this wasn't the case, but most founders now are just reconsidering where they build from, because the US is incredibly hostile and a lot of other countries are becoming more and more embracing of innovation. And I think the tables have turned and that the benefits of us markets aren't necessarily worth it anymore to a lot of new founders.
00:22:27.934 - 00:22:35.010, Speaker A: Yeah. What about existing founders? I guess. What about yourself? I mean, how long have you been running compound?
00:22:35.182 - 00:22:36.734, Speaker B: Well, I don't run compound.
00:22:37.154 - 00:22:43.322, Speaker A: Or when did you start? I don't know how I'm supposed to say it, but, like, when did you kick it off?
00:22:43.418 - 00:23:01.574, Speaker B: Yeah, so I founded Compound labs in 2017, which is a really long time ago at this point, and the world was very different in 2017. You know, if I had to start from the beginning, I don't. You know, I think I would take my own advice and probably locate offshore.
00:23:01.754 - 00:23:15.886, Speaker A: Yeah. Are there other things that you would have changed? Like, would you have not launched a token or would you have done it differently, I guess. What would you change now with, obviously, the insight of hindsight?
00:23:16.070 - 00:24:03.148, Speaker B: Well, I think the compound protocol is actually a really successful example of how to build a system that's not controlled by a centralizing agent. And all of this was developed in the open as sort of a playbook example for society at large of how a protocol can get created and handed off control to a community in a really strong way, following what we knew. I don't think there's that much I would do differently because I can't go back in time. I can't go back to 2017. I can only give advice to people, builders in the ecosystem in 2023 as they think about these things.
00:24:03.276 - 00:24:29.564, Speaker A: Yeah. Have you thought about. So, kicked off compound labs in 2017. Advice to new founders is to start offshore, spending more and more time at robot ventures, which, by the way, I heard some numbers. I heard you and Tarun are having quite a good couple of years at robot, so hats off to you. Have you thought about when it's time to pass the reins at compound labs?
00:24:30.184 - 00:25:02.102, Speaker B: Well, I'm not even sure what you're referring to, but I'm sure we're going to, especially as we start to shutter the compound treasury product, rethink what opportunities there are for institutional products in the space. At this point, compound labs has been focused just truly on institutional products. We're probably going to be rethinking what that means. I think in some sense, I'm going to continue to operate and invest and spend my time in the crypto ecosystem. I don't really see myself stepping down or leaving the industry.
00:25:02.278 - 00:25:04.434, Speaker A: You're not going to go work on AI, Robert?
00:25:04.734 - 00:25:14.594, Speaker B: I am not going to go work on AI. I've tried to do a little bit of GPT four. I haven't used Dali yet, but I'm not the best query.
00:25:16.534 - 00:25:37.976, Speaker A: I met with the world coin folks last week and I'm trying to decide whether or not I think that is like a wild invasion of privacy or whether or not I think that once GBT, like, five or six rolls out the ability to, like, do things online for you, whether world coin, like, saves us from a. From that kind of world. So, yeah, I think the true measure.
00:25:38.000 - 00:26:03.044, Speaker B: Is actually going to be when, like, chat GPT is, like, actually funny because, like, right now you can tell, like, it's like, just a really bad AI when you ask it to, like, write a joke or, like, be funny in any way, it's just like, it's so shockingly not funny and it just hasn't figured that out at all. And, like, I, you know, I think it passes the Turing test when it can, like, tell a joke, like, actually, like, be funny.
00:26:03.164 - 00:26:21.748, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I think it's tough to tell a joke in text. You need, like, a voice almost, or maybe you just needed to create incredible memes. So. But it's funny. I was showing my. I was back in San Francisco, I was showing my parents, and my mom remarks, she goes, you're using please and thank you all the time. I was like, oh, man, I didn't even realize I was doing that.
00:26:21.876 - 00:26:25.108, Speaker B: Yeah, you got to say please and thank you to the robot overlords. You know?
00:26:25.156 - 00:26:33.460, Speaker A: You do. You do. Exactly. So. All right, man, I want to. I want to shift gears a little bit and get your take on. Actually.
00:26:33.460 - 00:26:55.044, Speaker A: This is kind of like same gear, but, like, real world asset stuff. And so coinbase just put out this piece on, like, flat coins. I spend a lot of time inside of maker, and we talk a lot about real world assets. I'm just curious about your overarching view on whether or not it makes sense to pull off chain assets on chain. Yeah, I'm curious to get your take on that.
00:26:55.504 - 00:27:45.022, Speaker B: The answer is yes. I personally think that pulling off chain assets on chain is the superior approach to pulling on chain assets off chain. You mentioned maker, so ill give you a great example. Makerdao is actually getting quite good right now at taking assets from on chain to off chain. Theyre taking dai off chain when they let institutional counterparties borrow dai directly from maker and are getting good at taking stable coins, which serve as collateral off chain, to invest in assets off chain. So makerdao is doing one approach, which is called take things from on chain off chain pretty well. So they're like, building their muscles around, like, moving assets off the blockchain.
00:27:45.022 - 00:28:30.922, Speaker B: I actually think that's the wrong approach. Long term. I'm actually way more excited about the inverse of that, which is taking assets from off chain on chain. So, like, how do we get all of the assets that exist around the world to be represented on chain? Like, when all of these assets, from, like, stocks to bonds to commodities to real estate to art, when all of these assets are represented on chain, they're all going to be more useful, they're all going to be more programmable, they're all going to be more composable, and that's what's going to usher in a utopia of blockchain, so to speak. But until then, I think a lot of what's happening is the opposite, which is assets are going from the blockchain to the off chain, which is the wrong direction.
00:28:31.058 - 00:28:39.082, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's like moving like Internet native news, like, onto print. It's like. That's probably not the way. Exactly.
00:28:39.098 - 00:28:42.042, Speaker B: It's like starting a newspaper to write about crypto. It's like, why.
00:28:42.098 - 00:28:43.814, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
00:28:44.474 - 00:28:44.834, Speaker B: Though.
00:28:44.874 - 00:28:48.274, Speaker A: Who had the magazine? Wasn't it Bitcoin mag had a nice little magazine.
00:28:48.394 - 00:28:50.658, Speaker B: That's true, that's true. But that was early days.
00:28:50.786 - 00:29:21.438, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, exactly. All right, quick break from the show. There is this kind of overuse cliche saying in crypto, but it's true. Bear markets are building and everyone tells you that and everyone knows it. What people don't know is that if you're building apps in crypto and building apps in web3 without using quick node, you are building on hard mode. So quick note is this amazing blockchain development platform. It reduces costs, streamlines, the time to market for your app, and it offers consistent performance at scale.
00:29:21.438 - 00:30:11.098, Speaker A: For folks that have built apps, you will know that there are a couple key points here. One, Quicknode offers unlimited endpoints across 18 different chains and 35 different networks. They have response times that are two and a half times faster than any of their competitors, 99.99% uptime and a dedicated 24/7 customer support team. If you've been listening to Empire for a while, you might know that I am no gigabrain developer, but I do know a lot of devs and a lot of great product teams at other places. So when I see Coinbase and Twitter and Adobe and OpenSea and doing analytics, all leveraging and trusting Quicknode to power their business, that's when we get excited and that's when we want to partner with them. They're the best solution for any leading crypto and web3 company that is seeking an end to end blockchain development platform right out of the box.
00:30:11.098 - 00:30:31.912, Speaker A: So my message to you, get off hard mode. Let quicknode handle the blockchain infrastructure. Let quicknode handle the security. Let quicknode handle the performance while you focus on building beautiful products for your users, visit quicknode.com. Super easy. You can use code Empire. You'll get a free month on their build plan, so don't forget to use code Empire.
00:30:31.912 - 00:31:15.894, Speaker A: Santi and I gotta get credit for this one so they know that we sent you and you will get a first month free. Hope you guys enjoy it. All right, folks, it is time to talk about one of my and a lot of your favorite defi protocols. Synthetix Synthetix has been pushing the limit in defi innovation since 2017, and has just started its most exciting transition yet with Synthetix v three. With Synthetix v three, any protocol can now tap into Synthetix liquidity to bootstrap derivatives markets. The transition has already started with Synthetix perps. Synthetix perps taps into Synthetix's liquidity layer and is a new primitive that developers can leverage to launch defi derivatives.
00:31:15.894 - 00:31:43.610, Speaker A: The perps product has been going incredibly well so far. Hopefully you've seen it. It's had some great traction, hitting 500 million in daily volume this March. We know that liquidity rules defi, and synthetix is becoming the modular liquidity layer for defi derivatives. As a trader, you can trade Synthetix perps with low fees in over 20 different markets at quenta IO, decentrix.com and polynomial fi. And this opportunity set keeps growing.
00:31:43.610 - 00:32:27.196, Speaker A: With ten new partners in the pipeline ready to launch integrations on top of synthetix, including front ends, structured products, and institutional offerings, the team gave me a sneak peek of all this stuff. It's really cool. Would really recommend you check out Synthetix IO perps to learn more. And if you're looking to build on Synthetix, hop into their Discord server, reach out to the team directly. Make sure to tell them that Empire and Santi and Yano sent you again, Synthetix IO perps. You can also hop into the discord server and reach out to the team directly. Any, like, updated thoughts on, like, stable coins now that we're on the other side of this kind of bull market, and, like, deep in this bear like thoughts on stable coins, what the future stables could, could look like?
00:32:27.380 - 00:33:24.924, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a great question. So the most interesting event in my mind was two weeks ago or so, when USDC de pegged. I actually thought that this reaffirmed the value of stablecoins and the risks really well, in a very concise argument, which is all of the money behind USD coin was there. They had 3.3 billion at SVB, which temporarily on the weekend of SVB's demise. Nobody knew if it would be there come Monday, but USD coin, I'm going to paraphrase the numbers, there was $46 billion of USD coin and $46 billion of assets backing it. And even though it was so obvious that this was a one to $1 pegged stablecoin, the market price didn't reflect that.
00:33:24.924 - 00:34:15.044, Speaker B: The nav of one USD coin stayed at a dollar, but the secondary market for USD coin went down to $0.88 on one wild, tumultuous weekend. And the reassuring thing is the fact that when everyone came to their senses, it was obvious there was still a dollar backing each USD coin, and they were convertible one to one with dollars. And the whole system worked exactly as advertised. And obviously USD coin should be worth a dollar. But as it depeged, it just showed that there was an irrationality that was present in the market, where I feel bad for everyone who sold USD coin at $0.88 because they lost a lot of value, but they sold it because of an uncertainty.
00:34:15.044 - 00:35:15.786, Speaker B: I think that actually creates a really strong roadmap for stablecoins and how they're going to work in the future, which is the collateral behind them, shouldn't have to operate just on banking hours. The failure of USD coin for that one fateful weekend was because you couldn't actually mint and redeem it over the weekend, because the traditional banking system doesn't work on weekends. That's the crazy thing. And the crazy opportunity. If USD coin was mintable and redeemable during the weekend on crypto hours, which is 24/7 there never would have been an imbalance in the first place. And I actually think that there's a lot of ways which the financial infrastructure can upgrade over time, but the most important one is just the concept of weekend hours. Finance doesn't operate two out of seven days per week, and, you know, 16 out of 24 hours per day.
00:35:15.786 - 00:35:21.614, Speaker B: Like, that's the crazy thing to me. Like, finance only operates.
00:35:22.394 - 00:35:29.290, Speaker A: One of the big issues with SVB is just that they closed down at 04:00 p.m. So people couldn't get their wires out. Like, that was one of the core issues here.
00:35:29.402 - 00:36:00.944, Speaker B: Right. SVB closed down at 04:00 p.m. So what are you going to do? Stable coins, even when they're one to one backed, aren't one to one redeemable. And USD Coin wasn't one to one redeemable for two days and many hours from Friday, 04:00 p.m. To Monday, when everything opened back up again. And so the stablecoin is still beholden to the legacy financial system. And I think that creates the opportunity, even for one to one value backed stable coins to improve.
00:36:00.944 - 00:36:14.484, Speaker B: I leave it to the thinkers over at center, which sponsors USD coin. But this is a huge opportunity that I think is going to be solved over the next couple of years.
00:36:14.604 - 00:36:55.366, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I mean, so Coinbase launched base and they just put out kind of a call to action like, ideas for builders, I think they called it, or requests for builders. And one of the ideas was for what they called flat coins, which is basically, uh, decentralized stables that essentially track the rate of inflation. Um, and I guess you can kind of get this in like, the bond world, like an inflation tracking bond or something like that. But their, their idea would be like, you'd have an entirely crypto native stable coin that tracks the rate of inflation. Um, and, um, I'm just. Yeah, I want to get your take on this, or like, maybe other stables out there that aren't USDC. Like what are what, fracs? Like, ample worth.
00:36:55.366 - 00:37:00.220, Speaker A: I haven't looked at ample worth in a while, but like, some of these. I'm just curious to get your take on decentralized stables right now.
00:37:00.342 - 00:37:50.158, Speaker B: Yeah, so this is a really fun question, because a decentralized stablecoin that doesn't rely on one to one backing, but relies on over collateralization, like Makerdao, like some types of stable coins, can use anything as its target peg. So when you think of the stable coin, Dai, it doesn't have to target $1, it could target $1.1, it could target $1.03. It could target one ether of what it's worth. The only thing that's required is that there's more collateral backing it than the value of the stablecoins that are represented. So it doesn't have to use a target of one USD, it could use €1 as the target. You can easily make a euro over collateralized stablecoin that's decentralized.
00:37:50.158 - 00:38:42.774, Speaker B: You can really make an over collateralized algorithmic staple coin using any target you want. I really think what base by Coinbase is asking for is if they're going to have a decentralized stablecoin on that chain, why peg it to the dollar at all? Why not peg it to something non dollar? People have talked about pegging a stable coin to a basket of currencies, kind of like special drawing rights, or like a broad basket. You can peg it to anything. And so I actually think it's a cool idea to peg it to an inflation index. I think the downside is going to be that consumers aren't going to get it, so to speak. If you have one, we'll call them empire. And empire is a stable coin that is pegged to some inflation basket.
00:38:42.774 - 00:39:06.714, Speaker B: Each empire is going to be worth less overtime it, or like, even if you do the inverse of it for its peg, like, yeah, worth more over time, it's gonna be worth like $1.1. It's like, as a user, it gets a little confusing, and it's less usable than a stable coin. Like, if you have a, you know, an empire buck that's worth $1.2, like.
00:39:07.534 - 00:39:18.494, Speaker A: It'S hard, basically think that would never. That would never take off until or unless you had a world where something like the US dollar was experiencing hyperinflation.
00:39:19.114 - 00:39:30.626, Speaker B: Yeah. And, like, in that world, the world where biology wins, and, like, that's not a fun world. And, like, to be honest, like, you know, I'll just retreat to a cave and, like, not worry about.
00:39:30.730 - 00:39:53.830, Speaker A: I'll join you. I'll join you. Yeah. And I'm also not sure people are in that world or, like, moving their capital into this kind of, like, low, low market cap, like, inflation hedge, stablecoin that's run by some, like, a bunch of protocol devs. That kind of feels unlikely to me. So, other things. Robert, I want to get your take on app chain thesis.
00:39:53.830 - 00:40:10.888, Speaker A: We talked about this several months ago when you were on the pod, but I want to get your updated take on the app chain thesis. You guys, if I remember correctly, had a plan to launch compound chain on, what was it called back then? Substrate or the Polkadot SDK.
00:40:11.016 - 00:40:13.040, Speaker B: Yeah, substrate, which was part of Polkadot.
00:40:13.192 - 00:40:31.408, Speaker A: Yeah. And I'm just curious to get your, like. So I think Cosmos, like, really hit a narrative. Like, six or seven months ago, kind of. A lot of people were thinking about following a dy DX's footsteps. Then you've kind of had the, like, the l two narrative on ETH has really taken off. You had, like, Coinbase launch base on the op stack.
00:40:31.408 - 00:40:40.234, Speaker A: Then you have, like, arbitrum doing a lot of. Having a lot of conversations about l three s. Like, what is your updated framework around how you think about app chains?
00:40:40.854 - 00:41:35.426, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a great question. Um, I think an app chain, as an idea is incredibly valuable if you need incredibly specialized performance that you can't get from deploying on a main chain for some reason. If you're trying to do one thing, you know, a lot of times per second, an app chain makes a total sense. Some of the best app chains so far, historically have been either things with low usage or special deployments of things like DyDX using Starkware, where you've gotten a lot of transactional throughput. That would have been horrible on an l one. I don't think there's that many applications that have the usage to warrant an application, specifically chain or deployment, frankly. And the ones that do are well served by having an app chain.
00:41:35.426 - 00:42:21.658, Speaker B: And the way I think about it is an app chain is like a semi quasi composability with other things. In crypto, you know, if something's on its own chain, the only composability you get is, like, via exchanges that sit above everything. For you to be able to move assets from, like, one chain to another, or bridges that are built between one blockchain and another, it's, like, really quite clunky to have any sort of even value transport between blockchains. You're generally either using exchanges or bridges which create new assets. Appchain is similar in that the composability is not great. If you look at any of the Cosmos app chains, they're all useful. It's a great platform for app chains.
00:42:21.658 - 00:42:59.040, Speaker B: They actually all work. It's amazing. A lot of people have been able to use cosmos to launch a chain to do their thing. They've had a lot of success at that way, more than, in my opinion, substrate and Polkadot has. But even within that, the user experience and the composability between applications, it's rough. If you've ever used cosmos, it's not easy or intuitive to, like, move assets and value between their ecosystem. Like, you know, chains, they all kind of feel orphaned, even though they're not.
00:42:59.040 - 00:43:19.650, Speaker B: It's just like, it's a really complex user experience that I don't think fits for a mainstream population. Like, if you're extremely technically sophisticated and, like, you're a real dgen, like, you navigate that stuff. But most of my friends are not gonna be navigating, like, positive chains.
00:43:19.842 - 00:43:41.854, Speaker A: So, I mean, I like, if a protocol gets big enough, like, maybe use Uniswap, for example. Like, uniswap probably, like, leaks some value through mev, and, like, they need, like, there's. There's probably some reasons why they would go build their own chain, which I don't know if you ever read, like, Dan Ellitzer's piece on this, but, like, someone, like Uniswap who's gotten that big, does it ever make sense for them to launch a uniswap chain?
00:43:42.434 - 00:44:18.152, Speaker B: I mean, either they, at some point, we'll have a chain, which then people are going to have to very deliberately move their assets to Uniswap chain in order to trade on the Uniswap system, or they're going to have to figure out Mev in some other way. But Mev is the core enemy of Uniswap. I tried to trade on Uniswap a few months ago, and I had forgotten about Mev, and I just submitted a transaction. I was like, oh, wow. Like, I should have, like, you know, really lowered the, you know, percent slippage tolerance because I got ripped up by Mev.
00:44:18.208 - 00:44:29.744, Speaker A: Like, yeah, you got hosed. Yeah. But you got to imagine, like. Like, so do you think that that is behind the Uniswap wallet thesis? Like, where basically, where would. Where do you think Mev will end up accruing?
00:44:29.904 - 00:45:03.410, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a great question. I mean, I think long and Mev is so complicated, but I think long term MeV is deadweight loss, and it's going to get cut out through technology. It's a function of, right now, blockchains being a really bad platform, frankly, to trade on, because you're basically telegraphing what you're going to do to everyone. Even if it's like, most transactions are telegraphed to everybody. You can obviously send it directly to a mining pool and all these things. But net Ux is not built out.
00:45:03.502 - 00:45:04.058, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:45:04.186 - 00:45:13.450, Speaker B: For the majority of usage, and so it's just not a good platform to combine trading and broadcasting information. Hmm.
00:45:13.642 - 00:45:29.796, Speaker A: Yeah. By the way, Mev plug for anyone who's listening and who likes podcasts, we have another podcast called Bell Curve we're hosting with Hasu. I don't know if you know, if you know the Flashbots team, Robert. Yeah. A whole season on Mev with my co founder, Mike and Hasu, which is pretty interesting.
00:45:29.970 - 00:45:47.920, Speaker B: Yeah, I believe they have some really cool ideas on how to, like, take all the MEV and redistribute it, and to say, like, okay, it's a reality that, like, you're broadcasting information, but how do we offset that in other ways and, like, spread out the MEV and, like, do all these other economic things to change the system.
00:45:48.072 - 00:46:15.982, Speaker A: Yeah, well, maybe that's a nice pivot into value accrual. And just like, how you think about this, which is kind of a related question, like, do you think value ends up getting accrued? Let's keep with this uniswap example. Like, does value get accrued to the Uniswap token or basically the Uniswap protocol, the Uniswap, like, mobile app, essentially, or their app, or, like, Uniswap labs, which is like, the builder on top of all of this stuff, or whatever they're calling it these days.
00:46:16.118 - 00:46:50.720, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a tough question. I mean, right now, I would say at this moment, there's really only two things that are accruing value. The miners Mev, which is capturing value from users, and the users who benefit from this thing existing and are like, hey, I had no ability to swap XYZ token. This thing is cool. It's not listed on some exchange. I love uniswap. Or they're like, I want to trade ether and stable coins all day and there's somewhat low slippage and I can do it in my pajamas.
00:46:50.720 - 00:47:24.584, Speaker B: And that's awesome. I really see all of the value right now just for users and people taking value from the users. I don't really see any value temporarily, and this could change over years, going to the protocol or going to the labs or going anywhere. The primary benefit is that this awesome protocol exists and it has tons of users. The users use it because it makes their lives better. And the miners and mev searchers make their money off of those users. And that's the ecosystem.
00:47:25.164 - 00:47:28.944, Speaker A: Yeah. Do you think there's any chance uniswap turns on the fee switch?
00:47:30.204 - 00:48:06.884, Speaker B: I don't follow uniswap governance too closely. I've been delegated some unitokens, and I vote when there's really important proposals or contentious ones, so I don't pay too much attention on a daily basis at all. Last I saw on their forums, there was some debate over whether or not there should be a fee switch. And the last I saw it was like, why would we experiment with the most important pools? Why wouldn't we want to experiment with the least important pools and fees? Because what if we wreck the most. Because the proposal was implement fees on USD coin ether, like the big boy.
00:48:09.244 - 00:48:19.904, Speaker A: Yeah, we'll see. I feel like there's no. Especially with this regulatory, I mean, tying it back to the beginning of the conversation, I feel like there's no. Even if it makes sense for the protocol and for everybody involved, there's no way they do it in this market.
00:48:20.404 - 00:48:23.744, Speaker B: I don't know. I'm not a lawyer and I'm not part of the uniswap world.
00:48:24.764 - 00:48:47.876, Speaker A: All right, let's start to wrap this up about just thinking about the future a little bit. Robert. So you obviously spend a lot of time on the investing side at robot ventures. There were a couple other things that Coinbase had a request to build. One was the flat coins. The three other was on chain reputation, on chain limit order books, and safer Defi, as they called it. I'm curious what you think.
00:48:47.876 - 00:48:55.704, Speaker A: I don't know if any of those would fall into this answer, but curious what you think are the missing protocols or the missing things right now in Defi?
00:48:56.004 - 00:49:32.240, Speaker B: Yeah, it's interesting because all of these things have been tried at some point in one way or another, on Ethereum, on Solana, on avalanche. None of these things are radical ideas, frankly. And I think the more important question is why haven't any of these actually really worked or taken off? Or where have they worked and taken off? So reputation is a really, really tough one that, frankly, is probably best used for actually extending credit to somebody.
00:49:32.392 - 00:49:32.936, Speaker A: Yeah, right.
00:49:32.960 - 00:49:57.288, Speaker B: That's like, the primary use case is like, oh, you know, Robert is good. I can lend him ten USD coin. Hooray. Like, I know, you know, he has some reputation on chain. If he steals the ten USD coin, no one should lend to him. Again, it's like, it's primarily a thing tied most closely to, like, unsecured credit. And I think the market for unsecured credit and Defi has, like, kind of imploded over the last year or so.
00:49:57.288 - 00:50:37.264, Speaker B: Like, a lot of the, like, projects that were, like, exploring this, like, maple and others, had a really tough time because it turns out all the biggest players borrowing unsecured in the ecosystem were bad. Alameda was bad, right? Three AC was bad. It was like, all the people that were borrowing using their name were not people you want to lend money to. And so I think, like, even the idea of unsecured credit is, like, taking a hit and taking a backseat and, like, has decreased. Like, the relevance of reputation, at least for now. Like, I don't really see a reputation based system needing to exist or working for some time. I don't think it necessarily even a priority.
00:50:37.264 - 00:51:17.374, Speaker B: Like, even if you had an incredible reputation system, like, so what? What are you going to use it for? Like, so frankly, like, I'm kind of bearish on reputation when it comes to limit orders. You know, this is also complicated. Like, the earliest versions of zero x had limit orders. Current versions of one inch and matcha do have limit orders, but they only get filled when, like, there's enough mev for someone to fill it. Basically. Like, limit orders do exist right now, and, like, they're not even bad, so to speak. You're basically just, like, putting it out there and waiting for there to be enough Mev for a searcher to include it and take your profit from you.
00:51:17.374 - 00:51:58.794, Speaker B: But they work. Like, you know, I know macha and one inch and, like, all of those things are functional. And uniswap sort of quasi vaguely functions as a limit order trading venue today. So range orders on Uniswap give an individual the ability to say, I'm willing to sell this at a price that's higher than it is today, or I'm willing to buy it at a price that's lower than it is today and not do anything until it gets to that price. And so when you squint, there's already in uniswap limit orders. They're just not called that. And people, whether they're individuals or trading firms, actually do have the ability to use it like limit orders in a lot of ways.
00:51:58.794 - 00:53:13.468, Speaker B: And so limit orders exist. I think Solana has had a lot more success than Ethereum just in terms of its data structures for implementing limit orders. The limit order books on Solana were honestly quite usable when I looked at them compared to Ethereum, but we'll see if anyone actually implements limit orders on that chain. The biggest problem historically with limit orders was it costs the transaction to cancel them. You literally have to submit an on chain transaction to say, remove this limit order, whether it's a matcha or one inch or uniswap like range order, you literally have to do a gassy transaction to cancel it. And so the primary question is if it's on base and, you know, it's a roll up and transactions cost a hundredth as much as they do on Ethereum, do people care and will they pay that $0.01? Or is it still too expensive from a cost or user experience perspective to be submitting transactions every time you want to cancel? Or one of the best things about centralized exchanges is you can make 100 orders and cancel 100 orders like instantly.
00:53:13.468 - 00:53:31.704, Speaker B: Like, you're not like submitting transactions and waiting for them to be mined. Like, you know, API based systems that are like high throughput are like so much better for like orders and limit orders and canceling them than a blockchain. So I'm a little bit bearish on that RFP as well. And what was the third one?
00:53:32.564 - 00:53:36.746, Speaker A: What was the third one? Safer. Safer DeFi, which I didn't, let's see.
00:53:36.810 - 00:53:38.734, Speaker B: I don't know what that means personally.
00:53:40.474 - 00:53:58.254, Speaker A: Self service security testing tools, auditing services, threat prevention, circuit breakers, incident response systems. I mean, you guys have had a couple like all hands on deck scenarios in the last couple of years. Like any learnings from those like things that could have been built or not really.
00:53:58.714 - 00:54:40.114, Speaker B: It's a great question. I mean, you know, there's constantly, you know, upgrades to like how society at large thinks about like security and best practices, you know, you know, within the compound ecosystem, one of the harder things was that it became a distributed, you know, team and process and, you know, ecosystem before, you know, other projects, like, it's actually harder if you've like, moved to like, full on distributed governance. Like, flat out, like, when it's still just like one team with Adenocey is like, it's so much easier to manage security than when it's like, there isn't a team.
00:54:40.194 - 00:54:43.794, Speaker A: Right. You just jump on a call and you say, shut it down and we'll pick it back up in ten minutes.
00:54:43.834 - 00:55:04.194, Speaker B: Like, when it's centralized, it's so much easier to do security than when it's distributed. And so, you know, we've definitely gotten to see a lot. I definitely think there's like, room for everyone to develop better tooling, but I'd have to really dig into that RFP to understand exactly what their ideas are. It sounds like it's just like, we want ideas to make everything better and safer, which is cool.
00:55:04.734 - 00:55:14.630, Speaker A: So if you're not stoked about any of those coinbase rfps, is there anything that you're like, oh, my God, like, give. Put a great founder in this company in front of me and I'm funding them ten times out of ten.
00:55:14.782 - 00:55:41.842, Speaker B: Oh, all the time. I mean, you know, when you're investing at the early stage and robot ventures invest, you know, or tries to invest as early as possible, we're really just betting on people. Right, right. Mostly because ideas change. And, like, any rapidly evolving ecosystem, like crypto, like, what was a good idea three months ago might not work once you try it or doesn't make sense three months into the future.
00:55:41.898 - 00:56:04.734, Speaker A: Like, who did I just see pivoted? A privacy l one espresso. I don't know if you guys did the espresso, but I feel like that's a good example. Now they realize the way rollups need to decentralize is one of the key foundational building blocks right now. And they've pivoted away from their privacy l one into helping to build that.
00:56:05.154 - 00:56:45.356, Speaker B: That's the best example possible, which is founders who understand these systems and the ecosystem and what they're trying to do are comfortable being flexible and like, skating to where the puck is going and making changes and, like, rethinking and reevaluating their assumptions. And, like, that's exactly the type of founders that we like to back where it's like, hey, we want to support you, not the idea. The idea can change. Like, you should feel empowered to figure out what's going to work and add value and, like, be useful and, like, don't feel like you have to, like, do the idea that we funded, you know, just go be useful.
00:56:45.420 - 00:57:01.268, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. Yeah, man, this has been great. This is a fun conversation. Anything else? Kind of big things, investing, landscape, thinking about the next bull market next cycle, compound, really? Anything that's on your mind that we haven't covered?
00:57:01.436 - 00:57:32.236, Speaker B: Yeah, I think. I don't really think about bull markets and bear markets and all of that. I would just say that we're at a really interesting juncture where, you know, my biggest hope is that a year from now there's actually legislation in America that like, begins to set some of the rules, you know, for crypto. Like, we still have really not had any crypto legislation, period, full stop. And it's still. The only legislation we have is like nonexistent. It's just regulation by enforcement.
00:57:32.236 - 00:57:49.160, Speaker B: Like, the number one hope for the industry is that there's some legislation that, like, helps outline how crypto is intended or should exist in the US, because right now it's just still a complete absence and a complete void of legislation.
00:57:49.312 - 00:58:06.984, Speaker A: Yeah. When you went to DC and when you've gone to DC and you've had conversations with, be it policymakers, regulators, politicians, lobbyists, whoever may be, do you feel that they have a sense, like an understanding of, like, what the compound protocol is or right over the head?
00:58:07.404 - 00:58:40.298, Speaker B: Yeah, I think, you know, a lot of legislators and policymakers and regulators are still, you know, relatively early in understanding all of these things because the industry is so wide. I mean, there's like, literally, like, even the word defi includes what I would call DeFi protocols. And also things that I would say are like, absolutely not deFi protocols. Right. Like, including like, actual, just like, ponzi schemes. Right. Even the basic things, like, you know, what are the words? Like, there's so many things that go into them and these large umbrellas of, like, activities.
00:58:40.298 - 00:59:53.004, Speaker B: And so, you know, I've always just tried to, like, focus on explaining, in educating just, you know, what are the virtues of, like, why? I think Defi is, like, powerful and good for society and makes a better world and try to also explain why some things aren't defi, but it's still an educational phase for the most part. And what's cool is everyone's sort of waking up to the fact that this is totally new and they want to learn about it. And there's a lot of excitement to understand what's happening in this market that's made the news, mostly for bad reasons, mostly for FTX and three AC and Celsius and Genesis and all of the firms that have imploded in terrifying ways. And so the challenge that I find is just trying to educate and say, okay, you've heard about it from all the bad things, but why are people in the industry excited? And what are the good things? And how do they lead to a more efficient and transparent and, like, more autonomous financial system? And, like, why is that good? And I think there's a lot of excitement for that once you start to explain it.
00:59:53.124 - 00:59:57.900, Speaker A: Yeah, well said, man. It's a good place to end it. Appreciate you coming on, as always. This is fun.
00:59:58.052 - 00:59:59.884, Speaker B: Yeah, this was. We'll do it again sometime. Cheers.
