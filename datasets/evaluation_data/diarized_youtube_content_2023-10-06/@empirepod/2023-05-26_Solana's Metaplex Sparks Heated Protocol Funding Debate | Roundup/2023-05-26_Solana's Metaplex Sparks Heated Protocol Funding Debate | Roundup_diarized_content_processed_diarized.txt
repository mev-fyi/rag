00:00:18.934 - 00:00:34.306, Speaker B: Empire back to Empire. Jason's out in his honeymoon. Shout out, Jason, wherever you are. Hope you're having a good time. Garrett, the man behind the scenes who does everything and makes all this happen is here with us. Garrett, welcome to the show. You've been on it.
00:00:34.306 - 00:00:43.506, Speaker B: You are usually in the background critiquing our terrible takes and whatnot, making sure we don't say dumb stuff in the pod. But it's great to have you. Welcome back.
00:00:43.650 - 00:00:54.164, Speaker C: Yeah, it's great to be on. I think I was on probably about six, eight months ago. So I've been on here twice. But, yeah, always behind the scenes. I don't have to edit much. So you guys are super smart, but it's fun to be part of it. It's fun to be back on.
00:00:54.354 - 00:01:17.336, Speaker B: That's awesome. Well, there's a lot to talk about. I feel like there's a number of developments. Why don't we just get straight into it? Should we first talk about Nvidia and the fact that it just had one of the biggest candles? What I've seen is it added what the entire market cap of ETH, after reported earnings yesterday, it was up like 26%, which is wild. So walk us through that.
00:01:17.480 - 00:01:54.468, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely nuts. I mean, I'm not going to lie. I'm not somebody that follows this extremely closely, but like you said, Nvidia is up over 200 billion after last night's earnings when they beat it. The big thing with Nvidia is just there's been this huge trend of AI right now, and they produce GPU's. And if you talk about the last, like more than a decade, it's been, you have oil and now data is a new oil, and GPU's are what enable that new compute economy. And that's why Nvidia, some people, I was in a meeting this morning with our analysts and a lot of people think it's overhyped, maybe in the short term, but I'm pretty bullish on this whole AI sector. And it's interesting because you see this with AI, and I think some people are like, okay, this is in the zeitgeist.
00:01:54.468 - 00:02:17.036, Speaker C: It's becoming a bubble. And comparing it to something like autonomous trucks, where you had these companies, like, too simple. And Nikola, the Nikola is the one with the fake truck demo that came out and embark. And these are done through spacs. And you had 3d printing. I remember when I was in college, 30, printing was huge, and everybody was like, I'm gonna put my money into 3d printing stocks. And at the time, honestly, that was, like the outlet for crypto that people didn't know about crypto.
00:02:17.036 - 00:02:33.434, Speaker C: And it. It kind of disappeared. And it's now, though, and coming back up in dental offices and, like, making teeth. And then I think 90, I heard 90% of hearing aids now use 3d printing. So it's pretty cool. I'm curious your thoughts. And, like, I know you're mostly a crypto investor, but are you investing in AI?
00:02:33.594 - 00:03:20.876, Speaker B: I actually added Nvidia, like, three weeks ago to my portfolio officer. I saw Stan two weeks ago after I was. Stan Druckenmiller was on the stone conference, and he was. Had a great interview, and he mentioned Nvidia. Whenever Stan Duck Miller talks, I listen. And I have been adding my exposure in the public markets, and I'm deploying a very unique strategy to capture yield, doing some instruments, not direct investing, but more derivatives and type of instruments, where I get paid a coupon, and I have the option to buy it at a strike set 2030, 40% on the downside. And so if the stock ever goes down below that, I settle it after a year, like, different maturities.
00:03:20.876 - 00:03:52.648, Speaker B: And so my view on the market generally is, I feel like a lot of it is. There's more downside here than upside. Every sort of, I've been, last two, three weeks, I've been spending just really listening to traditional capital allocators from Bridgewater to Stan Grungenmiller and a bunch of other folks. It feels to me like the consensus that I'm hearing from them is you're not getting paid enough to be long in the market right now. I mean, we talk about, like, we're in a bear market, but look, assets rallied considerably since the beginning of the year. Like, crypto's up, what, 80%. The market's up 40%.
00:03:52.648 - 00:04:26.502, Speaker B: Some names are much higher. What is interesting, though, is, like, a lot of the rallying traditional markets is encompassed and concentrated in very few names, especially in tech, like, you know, Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, stuff like Nvidia. And so I think I just. I want to be long marketed, like, long term, like 510 years. But I feel like there's. There's more downside right now, particularly, like, you know, just time and time again. I mean, I feel like people are really set to.
00:04:26.502 - 00:05:35.376, Speaker B: I feel like most people are set to be disappointed when you think, like, oh, the Fed's kind of like, no longer going to hike, but inflation continues to be sticky and we keep moving the gold, but it's like, no, this is the last hike, and this is the last, like, and so I think, like, Germany across the board, I feel like, particularly in the US, I think things are pretty expensive, and so I want to capture yield. And so a lot of these instruments pay a nice coupon of, like, 1015, 20% even, like, I did one with none of this financial advice. But, like, Coinbase, I don't think it's proper. The market, like, most people don't understand it. And so I feel like I always, over the years, have asked people, do you think that Coinbase over, like, underperforms or, like, outperforms, something like bitcoin? Because it could be a really capital efficient strategy to be long crypto. So, anyways, long story short, I have been spending more time in the public markets, and I'm not of the mind that, like, I don't want to be long right now, but I do want to capture yield and there are ways to do that. And this instrument that I'm referencing is a reverse auto call convertible.
00:05:35.376 - 00:05:42.432, Speaker B: It's like a long way of saying, like, yeah, but anyways, yeah, I pay.
00:05:42.448 - 00:06:20.192, Speaker C: Attention more than, yeah, yeah, that's interesting. And I like the fact that, oh, you were talking about Coinbase right there. I do think, I mean, again, not financial advice, I don't know, but it is curious, like, how that would perform and the upside. And really, coming into this weekend, like, this call, I was just thinking about the markets and honestly, like, even though there are movements and if you're deep in the tech, there's constantly new innovations. It does just feel like I was like, Santi, how do you manage during this time? Because it reminds me of 2018 to 19, that, like, there's not a lot of price action, everything. Every time the market goes up by 10%, it seems to come back down. There's a lot of, like, l one s and different tokens that are now not hitting, like, their lows.
00:06:20.192 - 00:06:31.936, Speaker C: But, you know, I don't know, it seems like a little bit of lost momentum and AI has more or less consumed a lot of people's attention. And I even seen. Yeah, yeah, I think this is the.
00:06:31.960 - 00:07:17.206, Speaker B: Best time to look. Bear markets or crabby markets or whatever you want to call them, are quieter and allow you to really, like, just think about the assets that you want to own. And one exercise that I've been doing recently is I look back and the things that I would have during the bull market, there were a couple assets that I wish I would have bought more of that. And those are the things that I just go back and one, revisit what I want to own them today. And that exercise, ultimately, you look at the fundamentals and you could argue, what are the fundamentals in crypto? But I think then someone asked me that and I told them that I talked about it during this podcast. And I think the fundamentals for me, you know, a lot of it, a lot of crypto doesn't have product market fit. I get it.
00:07:17.206 - 00:08:04.232, Speaker B: But I think the fundamentals that I look at are developer activity. I think that is like perhaps the most important thing in an open source context where you want to look at where developers are gravitating to and building. And so, yeah, I just have a list of things that I go back and say, these are the assets that I was really excited about that I wish I owned more in the bull market. I want to look back and say, would I want to own them today? And if so, then it's a great kind of like starting point of, of looking at and like kind of culling the shopping list. But yeah, you know, I think, you know, people are chasing certain narratives. I don't have a particular opinion on, on AI. I play Chad GPT on the daily.
00:08:04.232 - 00:08:51.720, Speaker B: I think it's quite useful. You can make certain bets on it. And, you know, this week alone I was pitched three kind of crypto plus AI startups, some, one of which is particularly interesting. I'll probably end up investing in others, which are like, not so much, but yeah, yeah, yeah. The more, and the more important thing that I want to talk about and I sort of this idea that, I don't know, I think we'll look back and it's always, I always come back this like in 510 years, it's sort of like, you know, crypto is roughly a trillion dollar after class with some inflation baked in, but nonetheless, like 1 trillion. That's like absolute nothing in the grand scheme of things. Yeah, but it, it survived for ten years plus.
00:08:51.720 - 00:10:11.518, Speaker B: It's, it's an interesting asset class. And so you got to remember, like, most allocators haven't even touched this asset class, and a lot of things are really kind of lining up. I think the regulatory activity happening in different jurisdictions, particularly Europe, Middle east, like Dubai, is encouraging even in the US as well. You have, like, you have elections coming up next year, right? And crypto is an important topic. And I think in the context of innovation and where the US wants to be on a geopolitical level. And so ultimately I think, you know, anyone that is listening today and has lost conviction in this space and has been around for like five, six, seven years, like, it's kind of important to like look back and say, would you have thought the crypto have been so important election or so for in the public context and seeing like a lot of these brands build and particular in the NFT space. Like, I just think that sometimes we forget about these things and you sort of have to pinch yourself and look back and say, yeah, I think we made a lot of progress and price is one thing and unfortunately it's kind of the thing that we most latch onto to understand if we made progress or not.
00:10:11.518 - 00:10:33.314, Speaker B: But I don't think it's useful in many ways. And if you're going to look at price all day, you're going to miss and you're going to spend too much time thinking about price and not, not enough time looking at what's happening under the hood. And of course we like to do it here, right? We talk about interesting developments. And so anyways, this is a good time for me to shut up and move on.
00:10:34.254 - 00:11:01.770, Speaker C: No, no, that's really good. I think one thing that I'll probably describe wrong, but we just had Don Wilson on 1000 X, which is a podcast that actually drops on the Empire feed every other week. He talks about how with bitcoin is a negative convexity asset to him. He thinks it's one of the harder assets to trade. And that's because as the price goes up, as an investor looking at bitcoin, there's actually more likely that it gets adopted wider throughout the world in the community and uses a store value. But as price goes down, it actually spirals downward. Right.
00:11:01.770 - 00:11:42.188, Speaker C: Because bitcoin more or less right now is not necessarily a technology or something you build things on top of is a store of value. Though looking at other use cases where when you think about things in defi, that's not necessarily true to me. The price is less directly connected to what's being built because you just have all these different products being built on top. And I'll talk about it later, but it's just like curve is doing a lot of fascinating things with having safety and liquidations and their new lending protocol, and they have a new curve, stablecoin. There's a lot of innovations. I think the last thing I'll add to this little AI bit before we go on because we are not an AI podcast. But I do think it'll be part of the future is that I actually think it's amazingly bullish for crypto.
00:11:42.188 - 00:12:21.160, Speaker C: I think in one way, when you think about audits, that's a huge problem right now in crypto. I think that AI will come into this and can make it a lot safer. Now, you can also AI bots that come in and try to exploit protocols, but I think more or less it's going to be extremely positive and it's going to enable smaller teams to have that built in security. And I think on top of that, it's going to allow for the proliferation of new projects. Because with Facebook, you think about how you have content coming out through users like me and you, but you also have the Wall Street Journal posting on Facebook. And with AI, it's just the proliferation, it almost makes the marginal cost of creating content free. But also, when you think of content really, that can just be code, right? At the end of the day, that's what it is.
00:12:21.160 - 00:13:20.348, Speaker C: So I think if anything, we'll see more things pop up in crypto. And I've been getting ready for a new podcast called Lightspeed. And one of the projects that I'm following are riders is Ben Thompson with stratecry. And he talks about a lot and how Airbnb, for the first time, commoditized trust. And by what he means with that is like when you were traveling before Airbnb was along, you look for the hotel that had the biggest brand because no matter how expensive it was or how sanitary, I said sanitary, how like less local it felt, or it didn't matter how great the hotel was, but you chose it because you trusted it, and you couldn't really trust staying at someone's home for the first time, Airbnb made that different, where you could go and stay at people's homes, and that was through the photos, through the ranking systems, by making it digitized. And because of that, they basically disrupt the hotel chain. I think the same thing could be happening with crypto in that, like right now, we have trust in banks and certain neo banks and financial protocols, but for the first time with crypto, we're trying to disintermediate that trust.
00:13:20.348 - 00:13:22.344, Speaker C: And hopefully AI can mean more to that.
00:13:23.484 - 00:14:09.920, Speaker B: My thesis for AI and crypto at that intersection is very simple, which is, it's probably the only way to prove humanity. Yeah, it. And second, to train data. I think that over time, blockchains are data rich. And so when you think about you know, training a model with pristine data that is immutable, recorded on a public blockchain, accessible to everyone, that's quite useful to train these models over time. And so, you know, I think those two things make me interested in AI in the context of crypto. But, you know, we should be highly skeptical of people that are, you know, going to try to hide both crypto and AI.
00:14:09.920 - 00:14:13.272, Speaker B: And so anyways, you said it best. We're not an AI podcast.
00:14:13.328 - 00:14:14.604, Speaker C: It is AI pivot.
00:14:14.904 - 00:14:15.724, Speaker B: Yes.
00:14:19.344 - 00:14:59.874, Speaker C: Agreed. Well, maybe let's move on to another topic that I think was, honestly, it's not really all over Twitter, but I do follow a lot of the people in the Solana community, and it's something that came up, and I think it connects with the broader theme of just how do you fund the development of public goods? So I'm going to give a super quick, high level overview. I'll probably mess up the technicalities, but this is kind of what's going on. So Metaplex is a salon of protocol that allows for the creation, minting of non, well, nfts, non fungible nfts. It allows for auctions, the visualizing of nfts in a standard way across wallets and applications. And last time I heard, over 99% of Solana NFTs use Metaplex for that. So they have really dominated the NFT sector.
00:14:59.874 - 00:15:49.046, Speaker C: They came out with an announcement this week. So right now it's a protocol, but it's not like a frozen protocol, and that it's not immutable at the moment. So what Metaplex really does is metadata that's attached to these nfts as well. So that's something that you want to freeze because you don't want to have one centralized more or less company, that you have a token and are decentralizing, but in charge of that. This last update will introduce immutability or a way to get there to the token metadata to ensure that these key characteristics are preserved, but also introduce a network fee around different changes and minting and swaps and different interactions that happen with these nfts. So this caused an outrage from a few people, other people understood, but it was like, I think the idea was metaplex raised 46 million back in 2022. And this is actually after Metaplex spun out of, I think, a Solana lab.
00:15:49.046 - 00:16:20.354, Speaker C: So it started in Solana labs, it spun it out, and then it raised $46 million, which I think is like the third biggest beast you raise in the Solana ecosystem, like, just from an individual project. And I think people thought in general, this was going to be a public good. And you saw that with all these 99% of Solana nfts adopting this standard. But the issue is, now that they're adding fees on top of this, people are like, okay, we're going to have to fork this. But you can't do that because Metaplex has an open, they have a license where it says it's open source, but you can actually fork it. Similar to like, Uniswap V three. Uniswap B three.
00:16:20.354 - 00:16:42.950, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly like their code. And now, like, you have this program or this standard that's been developed and adopted. Now it's used by all these nfts. It's adopted by the exchanges and also wallets. And now you have this tax, more or less that people are saying that they put on top. Now the Metaplex team would come out and say, like, look, this isn't free to build. It's actually a lot of work to build and maintain this code.
00:16:42.950 - 00:17:14.045, Speaker C: We need to have a way to have a business model. Others are coming out and saying, this needs to be more of a way that somebody in web two might actually monetize this, where you build the standard. I know Facebook's done this with some programming languages, and then you offer the services and products around that because you're more or less best centered to do that. One of the big problems for this is on Ethereum, you have the ERC 20 standard and the 721 that's built into the protocol. It goes through the AIP process. Solana doesn't have these standards yet. So today the program is just set by Metaplex, and that's what's become the standard.
00:17:14.045 - 00:17:51.164, Speaker C: So I'm curious, Santi, one, I don't know if you have any thoughts on this particular issue. I will say that Metaplex actually tweeted earlier today that they are making a slight update based on community feedback, which is they're going to have no fees on update, verify, freeze and thaw. And that does matter because people are saying if you actually get charged fees on all these updates, well, some solana nfts which are programmable, they might even update, say, twice a day based on day or night, or they could multiple times if it belongs to a game. Yeah. So, Santi, I'm just curious what you view of this, but more or less like, really just the funding of protocol development and public goods and how you see that shaping out in crypto.
00:17:52.424 - 00:18:43.390, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know. I mean, like, I wonder, it's hard, like, once you, like, launch this like, how to put it back in the bag in some capacity. Like, you know, if you're the Solana team, you kind of hatch this product project, like, you know, come up with standard for nfts. And, you know, you have to think, like, how do you subsidize this? Because if this is gonna, if this is gonna hinder, like, NFT development in Solana, then that, like, degrades the interest in the broader Solana ecosystem of onboarding users. And it's a very difficult decision to go through this. But at the same time, you want to, you know, public goods need to be funded in some capacity, or I guess a quasi public good. You're adding a taxation layer on top of it.
00:18:43.390 - 00:19:20.348, Speaker B: And so it's really challenging. I, you know, in some ways, I think it's very difficult because you look at what, what is in Ethereum and you don't have this problem. And I think that really becomes even more, adds another layer of difficulty when you're trying to tell projects and users that they're going to be taxed for something that they're usually not used to being taxed on in other ecosystems like Ethereum. And so this is why I think it becomes an even greater problem, right. Of competition and really low barriers to entry.
00:19:20.406 - 00:19:20.552, Speaker C: Right.
00:19:20.568 - 00:19:55.654, Speaker B: If you're a new NFT project like this actually changes the landscape of it. And I want to, you know, I think it's important and it makes it incredibly difficult. So I don't have a good answer to all this other than I did hear the pitch for metaplex when they were raising. I wasn't terribly impressed, to be honest. I think they raised too much money and I don't think it was my, I wasn't particularly impressed by the team. So that's just my two cent. And, you know, people are going to look at this and say, being critical of Solana yet again, I'm not like, I just wasn't impressed by Metaplex.
00:19:55.654 - 00:20:03.710, Speaker B: And so I hope that they resolve this for, because I want to see, you know, I think the NFT ecosystem of Solana has been flourishing in many ways.
00:20:03.862 - 00:20:04.606, Speaker C: Right.
00:20:04.790 - 00:20:09.134, Speaker B: Yeah. What was that huge project that launched like, couple, like one month ago?
00:20:09.254 - 00:20:11.622, Speaker C: Was it on Solana?
00:20:11.798 - 00:20:12.914, Speaker B: Yeah, on Solana.
00:20:13.254 - 00:20:16.846, Speaker C: Oh, you're talking about mad lads. Probably. Yeah, exactly.
00:20:16.910 - 00:20:27.638, Speaker B: Right. I mean, hugely impressive. Right. So I want to see more of that and I hope that this doesn't get in the way of the momentum that you're seeing the Solana causes.
00:20:27.806 - 00:20:36.438, Speaker C: Yeah. I don't think people can say you're bearish Solana because I think we actually had an episode two weeks ago that I think the title was, like, saty now bullish on Solana or something like that.
00:20:36.486 - 00:20:43.152, Speaker B: I mean, over the years of, like, I've talked about, like, I've been on a podcast critical of people in the Ethereum camp being super siloed and, like.
00:20:43.288 - 00:20:44.576, Speaker C: And then time, Tom, again, we've had.
00:20:44.600 - 00:21:10.002, Speaker B: Anatoly and Ben here. I've been on many podcasts for Anatoly. I really respect how they build out in the open, and they take criticism in a very constructive way and made modifications to their fee system and a bunch of other things. And so, yeah, I think this is. I don't have any issues. I think they're going to figure this out in some way, shape or form. The nice thing about crypto is when.
00:21:10.018 - 00:21:11.130, Speaker C: You have these type of things, people.
00:21:11.162 - 00:21:23.202, Speaker B: Are always constantly looking for stuff that is trying to be too greedy or just not working correctly. So, you know, of course, you have to respect certain license and whatnot, but, yeah, that's not to say you can't build another standard 100%.
00:21:23.258 - 00:21:47.076, Speaker C: Yeah, I feel the same way. I don't really have, like, any strong feelings on this either way. It was curious to me, like, and this is happening all throughout crypto, or did. But, like, when you have a $46 million vc raise, there's nothing bad about that. But it does make you wonder, if you're a vc, you want to get a ten times return on that money. So the ecosystem obviously wasn't like, hey, I wonder how they're going to make this. At the time, I bet that happened, I don't actually know the date, but during the bull market and everything is moving so fast.
00:21:47.076 - 00:22:18.416, Speaker C: One of the cool things about Solana and a lot of these other ecosystems is they do move so fast, and that's one of their core advantages. But you can see in scenarios like this where that can actually be a bad thing. And that lends to Ethereum's credibility as it moves so slow in some ways, like maybe l two s do fragment liquidity and they fragment users, etcetera. But I do think it's pretty cool in that you can, it allows Ethereum to still innovate in a very quick way without having to do that at the protocol level. And with that, you're not going to have issues with this. And I'm curious if Kevin Owocki, if I'm saying his name right, he started get up. Yeah, getcoin.
00:22:18.416 - 00:22:23.364, Speaker C: Have you seen his proposal he made? It's called EIP 6969. Classic.
00:22:24.624 - 00:22:31.924, Speaker B: Not that one I haven't seen. I saw some post about it just because we're meaning it, but what is it about?
00:22:32.084 - 00:22:59.734, Speaker C: It's always fun how they come up with names and terminology in crypto, but so he wants to basically find a way to fund protocol development continuously. And so it's EIP 6969 looking to implement contract secured revenue on Ethereum L two s. And all that really means is developers get revenue when people use their contracts. This isn't like the first time this come around. I think that here has been trying to implement this Kanto, which is believe that's a cosmic.
00:22:59.774 - 00:23:14.838, Speaker B: Yeah, it's like the class like milestone driven funding. Like you seem biotech and has been proposed with some sort of smart contract mechanism. The issue is always the oracle and agreeing on, but I guess in this case it's tied to like usage of the smart contract. But anyone can gas.
00:23:15.006 - 00:23:17.382, Speaker C: Yeah. Which is.
00:23:17.398 - 00:23:19.638, Speaker B: Yeah, it's not, it's pretty interesting, I guess.
00:23:19.806 - 00:23:34.492, Speaker C: What the one thing I do like about it is like, okay, don't do this at l one, which I think at some point people try to do. He's like, let's just try this on individual l two s. And at that point it's like whether this is a good idea or a bad one, it's like, go ahead, go experiment. And you can actually do that now that there is l two. So I think that that's kind of cool.
00:23:34.668 - 00:23:35.004, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:23:35.044 - 00:24:06.498, Speaker C: But yeah, there's just been a lot recently with like, and we won't get into this this week, I don't think. But talking about tokenomics and sharing revenues with token holders and like the money that, the revenue that does go to the protocol, like that, should that be used by um, by vote to be used to say, make acquisitions or BD deals or should some of that be like automatically placed into a fund that's used to fund development going forward? Um, there's so many questions there and I obviously, I think, I think it's just almost impossible to make these decisions with a completely uh, decentralized protocol. It's extremely hard. Um, so I am curious to see like where can I note that, guys.
00:24:06.666 - 00:24:31.876, Speaker B: I gotta say, like, uh, it's, it's. You've now seen this redemption arc by a lot of VC's. Like, I saw Vichel from electric tweet, like, oh, wow. Like, like, you know, the tokenomics of curve are really, really great. And like, I was a part of that. I helped design that back in the day. And then when it launched like the token dumped so much and people were looking at the emission schedule and all this stuff, they're like, this is a terribly designed project.
00:24:31.876 - 00:24:59.654, Speaker B: Like God, like it was. The thing about tokenomics is it's really difficult to kind of construct them. You have turned like I guess precedent and case studies you can look at, but you know, you can overly engineer stuff. At the end of the day, like I've said this time and time again, like no amount of financial engineering and tokenomics is going to solve for a crappy product. Curve is a killer product. Like it really begins and ends there.
00:24:59.814 - 00:25:00.182, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:25:00.238 - 00:25:50.318, Speaker B: Your margin of error and leeway as it relates to constructing tokenomics is marginal when you don't have good product. Like Curve just has a phenomenal project. A product which is started with like for like swaps of stable coins and then you extend that to other type of tokens and it's just one of the like backbones of DeFi. And it was really the first example, or one of the first examples of why DeFi is more powerful and efficient than C five. For all the critics out there like Sam SPF of the world that were saying, oh, you know, nothing really works in DeFi. It's really inefficient building, you know, everything is much more efficient in a C five. And you know, like order book models and all this crap, I'm like, okay, trade stable coins and coinbase and then tell me how that's better.
00:25:50.318 - 00:26:49.786, Speaker B: Your slippage versus, versus curve. And so that was like really powerful. And I think, you know, I, and this is an area I do spend a lot of time on, like trying to design tokenomics, especially like, you know, our airdrops, good customer acquisition strategies, are they going to be really expensive over time? And so, but I think that there might be more, you know, this might come in handy over time. And so my, my best, my best recommendation to a team would be allow yourself the flexibility to like adjust certain things of the tokenomics over time. You know, project like Uma for instance, used, I think their token allocation to the community and whatnot as it is managed by the doubt, a very strategic way. They would do like campaigns and you know, try to test stuff and see what works and what doesn't work and you know, retaining a lot of flexibility, which is difficult because they'll say, wait a minute, the community is going to like look at what happened to arbitrage.
00:26:49.810 - 00:26:50.882, Speaker C: You know, it's like people freaking out.
00:26:50.898 - 00:27:36.354, Speaker B: Because Dow was like taking certain decisions and they weren't, you know, it created some sort of controversy. And so, you know, anyways, it's difficult, but I think the most important thing is I think you want to bake in as much flexibility that you can over time on the token Amex because you kind of don't really know your user today and you don't really know how the project's going to look in five years time, I mean, one year time, let alone five years. Right? So it's so early that fixing tokenomics, like in stone, and codifying them, I know it's been a standard, might be controversial, but I always say if you can allow yourself and give yourself some buffer to then use those tokens in a more strategic way for customer acquisition, for M and a activity, for whatever, then do it for funding.
00:27:37.694 - 00:28:09.074, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm sure you look at token distribution at times when you have new projects like what percentage of tokens are going to the team, to investors, the community, et cetera. And that more or less is a fix, at least in the beginning. But I'm curious, if you see an amazing product, something like curve, yet you don't hate, but maybe you strongly disagree with the tokenomics that were set at the beginning of the project, would that dissuade you from investing? And just because we're still so early, and if that product works, I guess the question is, can you just almost count on the team, the community, to then update and change those economics?
00:28:10.334 - 00:28:42.324, Speaker B: Yeah, I believe that. I think you can count it. Example of that was being part of the Wifi proposal to mint, what was it, 7000 or another, you know, another big chunk of Wi Fi to the new team. Yeah, and so I think that's a good example. Right. Ultimately, this space is very early and so, yeah, I think the focus should really be on building a great product. Uniswap didn't have a token for such a long time.
00:28:42.324 - 00:29:26.852, Speaker B: Many projects shouldn't have a token early on and just focus on building a good project, because once you launch a token, it's essential, it's important in some capacity. From a competitive standpoint, I think Uniswap is boxed in and had to launch one, but it adds a layer of distraction to the team. Most founders and founding teams end up really focused on that, on the token, and the price can be demoralizing and add the layer of complexity that is, it's sort of, you know, difficult for most teams to remain focused while they have a token.
00:29:26.948 - 00:29:48.874, Speaker C: So, yeah, and I mean, 20, 1718. When I was like first starting to get into crypto, it was probably those in 17. I was just reading probably spent like $500 on ethanol. I remember the big thing at the time was like one, how is it going to scale? Because l two s weren't a thing. But it was also there was like an unlimited supply of ETH. Like there was no means to ever reduce the supply. But I just think the fact that even like east tokenomics are more or less slightly slowly, but do change over time.
00:29:48.874 - 00:30:09.682, Speaker C: And I don't know if Mev burn will become a thing or not. I think if that can happen, it's just kind of silly to think that some of these protocols that also find product market fit like, well, don't have the potential to change if the community decides. Because we'll talk about here in a second, more or less. At the end of the day, everything is social consensus. And if community behind it believes that something is better for the protocol and the long term, I think they'll probably do it.
00:30:09.858 - 00:30:25.466, Speaker B: Yeah, you can. To kind of wrap this up. You can find product market fit with terrible token economics. You can, you know me, because if you have great product, if you, if you have great product market fit, you could probably change your tokenomics. Yeah, 100%.
00:30:25.570 - 00:30:48.200, Speaker C: Yeah, big fan of that. There's actually a big discussion going on and you know, blockworks research team, which we have over here, if you don't follow, check them out. I'll put a link in the show notes. But it's talking about tokenomics as well. We'll save this for another time. But they're talking about what is money. And if, like curve, for example, you have their tokens that are incentivizing liquidity, and you have this whole bribe system built on top through convex, et cetera, that starts to look like money in a way.
00:30:48.200 - 00:31:14.036, Speaker C: But this is the whole. Our tokens equities. Is it a claim to the cash flow underneath, or is it something else and something new? And I think that's something that's evolving, and there's no real answer. And I also don't like when people are like, is it money? Is it not like, let's just admit that there's a range of outcomes here, and there's something like us dollar, which is probably like the most money ness, if that's probably even a word. But then you have Apple stock, and if like, they made an acquisition, they can use their Apple stock. They'll pay in cash and they'll pay in stock. They can also borrow against their shares.
00:31:14.036 - 00:31:15.348, Speaker C: So in a way that has a.
00:31:15.356 - 00:31:19.264, Speaker B: Foreign money zone, Apple stock is very valuable currency.
00:31:19.844 - 00:31:20.300, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:31:20.372 - 00:31:22.024, Speaker B: And so is Nvidia stock.
00:31:23.764 - 00:31:26.052, Speaker C: Yeah yeah, I agree 100%.

00:32:24.926 - 00:32:59.206, Speaker C: The next topic, which relatively related it's Vitalik's new paper called don't overload consensus. There's a lot going on here. I think it's inspired a bit by so staked. ETH is obviously becoming more important, especially with the last Chappelle upgrade. And now lsts liquid staking tokens used to be LSD's, but we had to change that. Are becoming more and more important to the ecosystem, especially like LST five, which is involving. Instead of like putting ETH and borrowing its ETH, why not put an LST which is stake teeth behind there? Because you can actually be earning yield as your collateral is locked up.
00:32:59.206 - 00:33:39.264, Speaker C: Part of that is Eigen layer and it's taking ways. How can we basically utilize ETH to a greater extent? So like can the validators that are securing their ETH on ETH l one then use that same ETH to basically restate and secure another project or another layer, etcetera. And that's kind of catching a lot of steam. And it doesn't sound all that different honestly from like cosmos or the atom hub shared security, but it is is probably more flexible. Vitalik more or less writes in here about a situation that you could have these l one ETH stakers who are also say securing an l two with that same ETH. Some hack occurs on that l two. Does that actually give economic incentives to the l one to then roll back the chain? Because you could say you have an arbitrum.
00:33:39.264 - 00:33:59.968, Speaker C: Let's just say it absolutely gets huge and the majority of transactions happen there. If you did have a big hack like Del Hack. Could it come to a point where you're going to have the validators on l two, which are also the l one, say, hey, we need to fork this and roll the chain back? And he's saying, we ought to be careful. And I've seen, like, a quote or two, which is like, social consensus is the ultimate layer of consensus. One more, which, you know, is a.
00:33:59.976 - 00:34:00.776, Speaker B: Little bit more dark.
00:34:00.880 - 00:34:11.364, Speaker C: Financial innovation will not be hindered by social pressure, which, honestly, in crypto, that's probably pretty true. It's like you have stake derivative of stake derivatives. So I'm just curious, what do you think about this situation in this article?
00:34:11.664 - 00:34:42.084, Speaker B: I would encourage people to go back to that eigen layer podcast that we had a BD. All throughout that podcast, I just messaged Jason and was like, this sounds like repothecating security. And I don't think. I'm not. My brain's not. My small brain is not prepared to think about all the risks and increased surface area that that creates. And I do worry about that.
00:34:42.944 - 00:34:45.652, Speaker C: You can't do it. None of us can. I think we're all in trouble.
00:34:45.708 - 00:35:42.452, Speaker B: No, I mean, I love financial innovation, as someone who spends a lot of time in DeFi, but I am reminded of the global financial crisis, and sometimes when you're not pricing risk correctly, it becomes a problem. And I think there's a lot of issues. I think the more important one that you just mentioned, which is the validator set and the incentives of different validators, and if it's highly concentrated, I do worry. I don't think it's just like Cosmos, actually. I think Cosmos is a shared security model. But I think architecturally, people can correct me here, but it's quite different than what the value proposition of eigen layer, which is like, yeah, I think there's an important nuance. I don't know how to crystallize it just yet, but I just think it's different and riskier doing it in the ethereum ecosystem, the way out, how Eigen layer is doing it then, versus what you're having.
00:35:42.452 - 00:36:16.772, Speaker B: Cosmos. That's my hypothesis. People can tell me if I'm wrong or not, and I would encourage, this is probably something that we can have a more deeper discussion with people that are smarter on this topic, maybe bring up people in the cosmos ecosystem and also eigen layer and some other folks to talk about this. But I do worry succinctly re hypothecating stuff can work. But security is not something that I want to mess around with. Because if you lose security, you lose everything. And I want to be cautious of how we do that.
00:36:16.772 - 00:36:41.684, Speaker B: And I would almost kind of shut it down for the sake of. I don't want shit to blow up. Just like, guys, let's say it in other pockets, you know, let's centralize sequencers. Let's focus on other things. But this is something that, like, yeah, you push it too far and you know. You know that, like, fuck around and find out.
00:36:41.804 - 00:36:43.388, Speaker C: Yeah, this is one of those.
00:36:43.516 - 00:36:46.036, Speaker B: This is one of those. Yeah, you don't want to get there.
00:36:46.180 - 00:37:00.396, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's super interesting. And honestly, like you said, we just need to have another podcast on this, and we can explore, like, more. More in full. Jerome from Eigen Lair. He tweeted out in response to that article, and, like, he gave. He gave three points. He said, hey, don't build complex financial primitives on restaking.
00:37:00.396 - 00:37:28.274, Speaker C: They can spiral out. And, yeah, I don't know how you're going to stop anyone at permissionless system from doing that. It doesn't exactly sound that realistic at all. I do want to add, just to get maybe a concept where people are thinking, what's another way this could happen? Anatoly put in a comment. He's like, what about a protocol that bribes ETH validators to censor a specific kind of transaction? I can l two fraud proof, as, you know, optimistic and validity roll ups. They have ways that you can prove it to the l one, and one of those is fraud proofs for optimistic roll ups. In this type of situation.
00:37:28.274 - 00:37:33.894, Speaker C: You could also. You'd actually have the validators censor that l two fraud proof because it's not in their economic incentive.
00:37:33.934 - 00:37:37.038, Speaker B: So, yeah, yeah, I might have to.
00:37:37.046 - 00:37:48.034, Speaker C: Watch the big short. Santi. It's like, maybe people need to read the big short. Not that that's going to happen because of eigen later, but honestly, it's a. It's a great book, and it might give you some insight on, like, what can happen in these scenarios.
00:37:48.854 - 00:38:15.854, Speaker B: The more the both exciting and really challenging thing about crypto is that if there's an incentive, people are gonna build it, people are gonna. And people in your. And you're gonna attract people. So we can pontificate here all day long about how bad it is, and battalion have an opinion on it, and he has. Carries a lot of weight. But at the end of the day, you know, things are gonna be built and, you know, I don't think this. This post will stop Eigen layer.
00:38:15.854 - 00:38:26.090, Speaker B: Eigen lair from. From building. The question is, does it get enough traction? And so, yeah, welcome to the world of permissionless innovation.
00:38:26.282 - 00:38:28.514, Speaker C: Yeah, no. Well, well said, Santi.
00:38:28.674 - 00:39:41.322, Speaker B: Should we talk about the ledger stuff? I think I actually was on and spent a lot of time, I was off last week and I did cut it short because I was like, all right, I think I need to listen into what the ledger team, they hosted a public Twitter space to talk about their social recovery upgrade, and they did a firm braid upgrade. And, and so I'll just kind of hash the big level, high level stuff. So ledger is a hardware, like a HSM, like a hardware stream. Like, they have this device, probably one of them, if not the most widely used, like, hardware wallet in the space, probably has over 6 million wallets or hardware wallets they've sold over time. And they launched a recent firm grade upgrade for their latest kind of devices called, was it the lighter Nano X? Not the nano S, which is a earlier model, but the Nano X, the newer ones that they're shipping out. People noticed that they'd had a new firmware and then they kind of said, oh, yeah, we're going to announce it. And then they kind of, that forced them to announce all this really is, is they say, listen, a lot of people struggle with, they lose their keys.
00:39:41.322 - 00:40:22.524, Speaker B: They, they don't know. They've asked us, they claim that a lot of users have asked them to kind of build a solution to recover their keys in case they lose them. Right. You usually have them jot it down a piece of paper or whatever, and then some people lose it and, you know, anyways, so they said, how do we onboard more people? And so they launched a social recovery thing, which apparently basically cuts the seed phrase in three. You keep one and then it sends one to them and then, or they're using like some, like custodians where they're securely, they're encrypting part of the key and then sending it out to someone. And then that's, of course, let so many people in the community. Wait, wait a minute.
00:40:22.524 - 00:40:49.452, Speaker B: The whole point of a hardware wallet is that it, the key is never exposed, it never leaves the device, it gets generated and then it never leaves. And now you're telling us you can do a firm grade upgrade and this can happen, like, wait a minute. That just completely changed the game. Right? And so, yeah, it was, it was pretty controversial. I think it was one of the worst pr stunts that I've seen in a while. Yeah. French like, I guess.
00:40:49.452 - 00:41:40.884, Speaker B: And so I was in the call on the Twitter space. And I said, guys, like, can you just walk us through, like, what point, what, at what point in time did you allow for this, for a firmware upgrade? Firmware upgrade to kind of allow for you guys or whatever, or someone especially to expose the keys. Right? And so, so I want to say, shame on us, because we should have paid more close attention to this and asked these questions way before, because apparently, and my intuition was when I asked him this question, that this was possible way before. Right? And so it was. Right. And so they claim, like, yeah, we're, you're always trusting Ledger, the company, not to deploy some sort of firmware upgrade that allows for this. But it is hypothetically possible, right? A rogue.
00:41:40.884 - 00:41:42.632, Speaker B: They could just do this, right?
00:41:42.648 - 00:41:43.444, Speaker C: They could be.
00:41:43.824 - 00:42:00.626, Speaker B: And so, of course, like, there's based on practical. So you're trusting them, but you're. And so their device is closed source. It's not open source. And so, yeah, because they have these NDAs with the people that are designing these chips. So you're trusting them. There's no backdoor and whatever.
00:42:00.626 - 00:42:42.284, Speaker B: So, yeah, it was, it was a pretty interesting, it is an interesting discussion in the community. Like, what do you do? Do you want this recovery system? You have to do Kyc. If you lose your keys, you have to go through KYC. And if so, you can reconstruct the key. Then the CEO admitted that, of course, the question is, well, hypothetically, if someone, like an AI agent, like, pretends to be you, Pazos, KYC, reconstruct your keys and then just steal your funds, or, you know, like a state agent goes to let you and says, yeah, I want to access, like, Garrett's key. It's like, right, right about now. And that's it.
00:42:42.284 - 00:43:23.810, Speaker B: Right. And so, and it was all these kind of attack vectors and so that they consider. He's like, yeah, this is problem. So anyways, there is some insurance in this solution. It's like covered up, covers up to, like 50k, which is tells you, like, what this, like, why, like who this product is for. So, yeah, it was a bit of a ramble there, but I think it's, you know, it's always, I think it, it's interesting to then think about how do you secure your crypto? Is it good for the, for some subset of users, probably, right. Less sophisticated ones that have maybe less than 50k or just get comfortable with all this stuff.
00:43:23.810 - 00:43:29.042, Speaker B: But, yeah, I don't know if you have a reaction to all of this.
00:43:29.218 - 00:44:02.614, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that was a great summary. And, yeah, it was definitely super heated the last two weeks. I think what gets me is that I don't think people that are going to have one, like, probably that less than 50,000 mark. So let's just say anywhere from zero to 10,000 maybe on average, um, user. And also someone that's going to want to split and shard their key and have someone else with social recovery is going to be using a ledger, or uses a ledger today. Like, I just more or less think that person is going to be, like, on Coinbase or some other service. So, like, they're going after a user that I don't even think might be like one 1% of their audience.
00:44:02.614 - 00:44:16.282, Speaker C: And that's the main thing that I don't get. I mean, the PR was a failure. I think they're going after the wrong customer. Like, come out with a new product. But honestly, I don't know any friends that aren't really into crypto that want to store their own private keys and not have it. They don't want it to be touched by anyone. They're the ones that get.
00:44:16.282 - 00:44:27.362, Speaker C: They're the ones that want to get a ledger. The people that are, like, I need help with my seed phrase. Like, I understand that. Like, I feel that way a lot, but those people don't. They don't want a ledger. Like, they'll use Coinbase, they'll use Coinbase vault. They'll do two fa.
00:44:27.362 - 00:44:58.474, Speaker C: Or they'll do something like, I have origin on my phone, which is social recovery. I mean, you don't want to put a ton of money there, but it's just like, I don't know, I think they're building for an invisible customer that, like, maybe will be a thing that not. I wouldn't have launched on this device. And I know you have to, like, I think, accept the update for this to go live, but I know you said also, like, there is like, an attack vector that already exists in there. And I saw Haseeb talk about, which honestly is above my head, but he went into, like, there has to be some way to update the device in the sense that when you add new blockchains or like, Ethereum used to have one type of signature, you have to update it, but it's just the communication always.
00:44:59.494 - 00:45:57.962, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it was a big wake up call to everyone in the community. That's why I say my nuts, because if the firmware upgrade, they're able to do that, right, to support new blockchains and they need to do a security patch, ultimately, you're trusting them to do the correct and secure firmware upgrade. And so I think a lot of folks that I follow that are experts in security said you kind of like, what's the option? Never do the firmware upgrade. But you also, you know, but at the same time, like, there will be over time, some upgrades that are pretty critical. That I think the proposal that a lot of people are saying is just come up with two different hardware wallets. One which has a social recovery thing. You're buying it, maybe you buy the cost, and then you have to pay a subscription, pay for this recovery feature, and then another one that is just, you can do these upgrades, but you're just like, you're not ever like, you know, it's not possible.
00:45:57.962 - 00:46:21.422, Speaker B: And as, again, you have to trust their guarantees. You will never be, you know, in a position to expose the key in sharp, like, to, you know, be part of the social recovery thing. But again, I think everyone is now as woking up or is waking up this idea that at the end of the day, you are trusting a company to not do an upgrade that allows your key to leave the device in some way. Yeah.
00:46:21.438 - 00:46:27.874, Speaker C: And you're at that point, like, what do you, what do you do if you really want to be that safe? You, like, you can write it down on a piece of paper or remember it in your head. Right? Like, not using a device.
00:46:28.704 - 00:46:35.284, Speaker B: Yeah. You can generate, like, I guess, a, you know, wallet offline air Gabriel.
00:46:35.824 - 00:46:36.544, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah.
00:46:36.584 - 00:46:57.310, Speaker B: But, but again, for bitcoin, more straightforward. But if you want to interact on chain and do some stuff on chain first, like a smart one. Like a smart chains, like, it is difficult. Yeah, I'm gonna mess around. One key, which is he mentioned was post your shout out to them. And, like, you know, I'm not endorsing any project. I do.
00:46:57.310 - 00:47:39.464, Speaker B: I use a number of wallets. But, you know, at the end of the day, like, the name and security is a Horcrux model, use different arbor wallets, you know, separate your funds, assume that any one of those can, at some point, be compromised, and you'll be okay. You'll lose some funds, but not all of them. And I think that's generally the way you think about risk. Shout out, by the way, Sam Zell, one of the legendary, not the most legendary real estate investor out there, passed away a few days ago. And I was listening to a few of his podcasts, one in capital allocators, and I read also his book and reread his book. And, you know, the best investors always tell you risk.
00:47:39.464 - 00:47:45.324, Speaker B: You never do anything that can kill you because you can't even be lucky if you're dead.
00:47:45.484 - 00:47:46.252, Speaker C: And at the end of the day.
00:47:46.268 - 00:48:32.944, Speaker B: I think this is how you think about security in the same way that you think about risk, generally speaking, which is as you're investing your capital and securing your capital, especially in this world of crypto, which can be your own custodian, you just use multiple solutions. Like, never have one harbor wallet. Use a nosis safe, like, where you have three of five or two of three keys, different keys that are signing a transaction, and you can use all three different hardware, four different hardware, or grid plus, you know, one key ledger, and a treasure with a 25 words, not 24, because there's a vulnerability. So, you know, like, yeah, at the end of the day, like, this is, this is. This tells you how early we are.
00:48:33.604 - 00:48:37.004, Speaker C: I was about to say the same thing. I was like, everything you're saying is so true.
00:48:37.124 - 00:48:55.092, Speaker B: Like, God damn it, like, anyone that is, is listening to this and doesn't think that we're early. And two, that crypto is easy. Like, folks, sorry to cut it, but it's not. We're early and it's difficult. And this is why we get. And this is the asymmetry. You hope, like, naval has great tweet, which is if you are.
00:48:55.092 - 00:49:11.590, Speaker B: If you're in this space and you don't think that you're going to be immensely compensated for being a beta tester for all this stuff and you're willing to ride it out and see kind of the local tops and bottom, then go chase something else. Yeah, not all year for obviously, like, seeing the, like, I'm not.
00:49:11.622 - 00:49:12.422, Speaker C: Not like, intimating.
00:49:12.478 - 00:49:19.198, Speaker B: Like, we're only here for, like, hundred x and, like, that's it. But. But there's a lot of risk and. And you gotta believe in the technology.
00:49:19.286 - 00:49:20.414, Speaker C: And the impact that it can have.
00:49:20.454 - 00:49:31.234, Speaker B: And, you know, ultimately, there's really smart people here. And that's, to me, why I'm excited. The minute that I don't feel intellectually stimulated by this space, I'll leave and I'll go do something else.
00:49:31.934 - 00:49:52.298, Speaker C: I feel the same way. I mean, it's like. It's like working for a seed stage or a series, a company, in a way, and that, like, you don't go there for the salary that you're getting paid. Like, you're going there because you believe. You believe in the space you like. And a big part of that is, like, as an investor, you know, this. Like, crypto does have some product market fit in certain areas, but, like, you're investing, you're investing in your investing team at the get go.
00:49:52.298 - 00:49:54.614, Speaker C: And there are so many smart people in this space.
00:49:55.394 - 00:51:32.288, Speaker B: I'm just, I tweeted this two days ago and because I'm tired of like all these stupid people, mostly from BC, that are pontificating like, crypto has no product market. I'm like, listen, guys, like, stop, right? Because it is in my tweet was, okay, how is this any different? If you don't like NFTs or meme coins or D or finance DeFi because you call, because you think that the artist sucks or that DeFi doesn't work or it's too complicated or whatever, how is that any different from all? When you look at e commerce, for instance, especially in the early days, people are like, I hate some of the crappy products that are sold on Amazon or online, right? Does that make Amazon PayPal stripe bad companies without product market bid? Because maybe you don't like anything that's sold there. Absolutely not. Right? They've created the ability to buy anywhere, anytime, all the time, right? And so crypto in a similar way has now opened that same possibility to everyone, right? Because you're sort of transcending a lot of friction points that the Internet had, which is never allow you to move money to see whether you process information. And so now you're extending that consumer preference, which is now, you know, you have created digital property and you've allowed creators that really appreciate, especially in NFT realm, to sell their art, improve the scarcity of that to the end customer. And so ultimately, if you don't find anything you like today, I guarantee it's gonna be something you like in 510 years. Like Amazon served with books.
00:51:32.288 - 00:52:02.852, Speaker B: There's, people don't like books, but at some point they have now bought something from Amazon because it's the largest company in the world, right, by, you know, headcount, whatever. And so, you know, what I'm trying to say is, I think we do have product market fit. Very much so. And you're seeing it with a number of different realms and verticals, right? And you're going to continue to see that with gaming and all this stuff. And even though it's inefficient even more, think about that. It's like, there's a great post. We're going to talk about Fred Wilson later on.
00:52:02.852 - 00:52:56.764, Speaker B: I don't know if it was Sam or someone else that says if people were willing to go through hoops and barbed wire to enter this space because they want to buy an NFT. Like, how is that not product market like, you know, and Chris Dixon from a 16 Z talks about, you know, the hobbyists and pay attention to hobbyists because those are the guys that are early or the hobbyists, like, are tinkering with technology and it's never easy, but they're so passionate about it and obsessed with it. And that's, you see a lot of hobbyists, we're all hobbyists in crypto right now. And, and that, I think, is a hallmark of strong product market fit. And, and so ultimately I'll go one on one. Anyone that wants to contest the fact that crow doesn't have product market fit because they are totally off base here, you know, totally off it.
00:52:56.844 - 00:53:15.614, Speaker C: Yeah. And those people tinkering are voting with their time, right? Like they're, it's because they truly believe in something and they're the ones pushing stuff forward. I couldn't agree more. It does remind me a little bit of, I mean, I know everyone does this comparison. Little cliche, but like the early, early Internet, like computers, all of that. Like the first computers were the size of a room, right? And they're actually like in the Internet.
00:53:15.654 - 00:53:18.206, Speaker B: And it cost like, they were so incredibly expensive.
00:53:18.230 - 00:53:45.124, Speaker C: Who knows? Yeah. And like the point that people made the Internet for is like ARPANET and then also past then. And the, like World Wide Web was just to get information and collaboration between like academics and like the government, right? Like that's how they saw what the use case was. And it wasn't until you had things like the World Wide Web and the browser. Like that was a huge moment, right? And the Gui on the computer, you just had all these things. And then eventually you had broadband and it's like all these little things that enabled like something so much bigger. And part of that's also mobile.
00:53:45.124 - 00:54:11.490, Speaker C: And I'm slowly getting mobile pill, like, I'm not there yet, but on like how important mobile could be to crypto and that. Yeah. And like, Solana is going down that route to some extent. But like, I think everyone knew this except me. But I saw stat yesterday and I was like, I think it's a, when you're looking at gaming revenue, there's like 50 billion a year on like devices, computers, et cetera, 100 billion a year on your phone, mobile, mobile games, it's like twice as big. I had no idea. So, yeah, I think that's a huge moment for crypto that's coming.
00:54:11.522 - 00:54:35.726, Speaker B: I mean, it just makes it right. I mean, if you have something on the go and you're carrying with you, you do so much more. Right, but this is the other thing. Like, time and time again, I was listening to conference here, and people talk about, like, speculation. This is something that, like, comes up over and over. It's like all, especially with meme coins now just, oh, you know, it's all speculation. This is the casino.
00:54:35.726 - 00:55:42.094, Speaker B: And look, there's a whole industry like Las Vegas that is built on, in Macau that is built on gambling. Now, I don't have an opinion on that. I just, again, it's consumer preference. Like, there is a subset of people like to do this. Like, why not allow them to do that in a more transparent context? And this is the thing, like, I don't have an opinion on anything other than I believe that if something can operate in a transparent system, it will inherently be better than a closed black box system, like full stop. So no matter what you do, no matter what, not to say that this transparent system is going to be perfect, there are trade offs to privacy and a number of things, but you always, invariably will, I will always choose a transparent system, whether it's financialization of x, y or z, or interacting in an open, transparent system will be more efficient, will ultimately benefit the consumer way more, way more than a closed system. And so you're already seeing that across a number of things, right? And people will benefit.
00:55:42.094 - 00:56:19.148, Speaker B: Ultimately, the people that benefit the most are creators. If you're an NFT artist or a developer that is willing to extract more value for their contribution relative to a handful of investors that had privileged access to certain deal flow and have capitalized on the huge rise of tech and software as a service and, you know, social media, like all these huge companies, have only benefited a subset of people. And now, you know, you're building in the open and it, and it, and it freaks and scares a lot of people and Russians.
00:56:19.276 - 00:56:20.636, Speaker C: I get it. Yeah, I get it.
00:56:20.740 - 00:56:26.264, Speaker B: Like, I get it. Like, no surprise. But, yeah, it's really exciting to see real time.
00:56:26.964 - 00:56:28.624, Speaker C: Couldn't, couldn't agree more.
00:56:28.924 - 00:57:15.796, Speaker B: And it's great because it also comes at a really interesting time with geopolitical chips and this idea that, you know, people can now work from home and move freely, and now capital moves freely, too, and startups can work remotely. And it's, it's, I think, an incredible transformation. And crypto is really at the center of empowering so much and so, but that's never to say it's perfect. It will never be perfect. So we should always be skeptical. But the more, the more you try this stuff, I think the more excited you get about how crypto fits in so many different huge, slow transformational trends that have been happening over the last 20 years and are going to continue to reshape this world in a very meaningful way. Preston.
00:57:15.820 - 00:57:38.434, Speaker C: Yeah, we started with this podcast talking about Nvidia going up by 200 billion, which is roughly the size of ethereum. But I think one of the things that also shows the power of the community and what's actually building there, regardless what the price is, just how much crypto and ethereum is mentioned in everyday life through politics. When you think about even Biden coming out, latest speech, you see it everywhere. And it's just something that's, people don't. The more you talk about it, the more important it is that we talk.
00:57:38.554 - 00:57:52.626, Speaker B: He talked about, like, crooked, like, tax loopholes. And I was like, wait a minute, everyone's it. First of all, no one has got gains this year. Second of all, I'd love to know what. I'd love to know what those are because everything happens on chain. So, yeah, like they, taxes in the.
00:57:52.650 - 00:58:11.176, Speaker C: Space, you know, can ignore it, though. I think that's the point. Like, they just, they can't ignore it. And there's enough out there that it's popping up everywhere, regardless of what the price is. So I think this goes nicely just into Fred Wilson's new article, freedom to innovate. Santi, do you want to do this or do you want me to go for it?
00:58:11.320 - 00:58:13.616, Speaker B: Go for it. You do way better summaries than I do, sir.
00:58:13.760 - 00:58:51.018, Speaker C: No. Well, I'm making this one short. I think I ramble, but Fred Wilson came out with an article, I think it was yesterday, and I just took out little bits, but it starts off and it says, back in 2014, USB. So Fred Wilson is, I think he was one of the founders at USV, which is Union Square Ventures, one of the top BC funds, and says, got subpoenaed by the New York state Department of the Financial Services over their web3 investing activities. And now he's fast forwarding today. And he said, I was reminded of that moment yesterday when a quarterly call with our limited partners, we were asked if the regulatory pressure in web3 in the US would result in us cutting back our web3 investing. To which he responded, when they want to shut it down, I say double down.
00:58:51.018 - 00:59:12.620, Speaker C: He said, the most powerful technologies send waves of fear through the establishment. When you see the fear in their eyes and invest in the cause of that fear, I'm not like trying to be cultish because it's like, as I was saying that, I felt like a cult leader, but honestly, it's super powerful. And I think it's amazing that Fred Wilson's been extremely respected in the space, in VC for a long time. Not way outside of crypto. And he got into crypto, whatever. It was probably early, but I've heard him a lot in 2017.
00:59:12.692 - 00:59:18.224, Speaker B: No, I mean, one of the first investors in Coinbase, I think he returned the fundamental month. Just the Coinbase investment.
00:59:18.644 - 00:59:25.184, Speaker C: That's pretty. Yeah, pretty good place to start, and you can obviously just see the conviction. So, anyways, I thought that was exciting, and I'm seeing it pass around crypto right now.
00:59:25.504 - 01:00:13.084, Speaker B: Look, I get. I get pinged a lot by people around regulation, and I'll make two observations. One, I think you're seeing a bifurcation in a camp that is taking advantage of opportunity to attract capital formation and bright individuals and teams. And you're seeing that in Europe. Amika, you're seeing in the UK, you're seeing some caribbean islands, seeing it in Dubai, Hong Kong, not so much in the US by particular agencies. Particular agencies. And I will say the second, which leads me to my second observation, which is we should not think about the US and cluster it and make generalization, because it is a very divided opinion on what one or a few agencies have portrayed this asset class in this industry versus general sentiment out there.
01:00:13.084 - 01:01:01.710, Speaker B: And the third, I guess I cheat. The third observation is we should not lose faith in the court system, because that is the backbone of a democracy, of a developed country, I think, which is what is most interesting and important at this point in time, is the interpretation the courts will have on the opinion of agencies, particularly the SEC, on this industry. And there's the ripple case. There is the grayscale ETF case. Right, grayscale suing the SEC. And then there's also, perhaps more importantly, the Coinbase case. And so I think all of those three, and the early indications, as I interpreted, as not a lawyer, but for that, I will save it for the interpretation in our regulatory podcast with Rebecca and Jake.
01:01:01.710 - 01:01:39.616, Speaker B: But I have faith in the court system, in interpreting the law correctly and the oversight and the regulation, the policy that needs to be shaped in this industry, but at the same time, in a measured way, that is pro innovation. And I think that marries really nicely with the political landscape going into the election next year in the US. And so if you don't have faith in the court system, then good luck. I mean, you have bigger problems on your hands. Like crypto is just one, but it will, you know, as soon as you lose the courts, then I think a democracy fails. Because if you're not going to respect the law, then you go elsewhere. Right.
01:01:39.616 - 01:02:15.388, Speaker B: And that just becomes anarchy. And so ultimately that degrades democracy. But I think I still have faith that. I think the court system in the US is perhaps the best or second best, perhaps the court legal system. The UK is brought more international over trade, but in the US I think it's very solid and strong and I have faith in that. So, yeah, I think ultimately I'm encouraged. And we've been talking about regulation for a long time and, you know, I think these three cases are going to really shape the way that we finally can construct some policy that is helpful.
01:02:15.388 - 01:02:43.184, Speaker B: And it might just come down to where Europe leads the way and then the US copies it. This has happened before time again, over time. Like the UK really has shaped financial policy in a very meaningful way over the last like century or so. Like they were first to adopt and create a framework for gold ETF's and then the US kind of followed suit after they had like banned and really been in opposition to this. So I think we'll probably see a similar path here.
01:02:43.844 - 01:03:07.806, Speaker C: Yeah, I agree. Well, better put than I could do it. This is so left curve. But I think a big part of politics hopefully going forward is you have what I'd say is younger generation, whether it's millennials, Gen Z, et cetera, that are coming into that, being a larger and larger percentage of that voting class and obviously brought up in the digital economy and probably more favorable, something like crypto and open to those things. I think that'll be a pretty big shift just over time. It's literally like the age gap.
01:03:07.980 - 01:03:19.498, Speaker B: Kind of surreal that most of the country is like, uh, shift. You know, it's obviously yacht, the voter base. The voter base is young, right? Yeah, sub 50, 40. But most of the country is run by people that are in their eighties.
01:03:19.546 - 01:03:21.694, Speaker C: And so, or seventies and eighties going on 90.
01:03:22.034 - 01:03:59.610, Speaker B: Yeah, it's difficult. But hey, look, I mean, Chad, like, uh, one of our first investors in paraphones, like Henry Kravitz, like the guy was old, doesn't use a smartphone, but he understand asset classes, like, you know, not all people that are 80 and 90, like, or against technology and innovations. So, you know, I think this is why it's important to step back and understand, like, this is something that is being used. It's something that the younger generation certainly likes and excuse because they don't have any semblance of what a bank is. And they just like spending time in the digital world. And this technology, you know, acutely enables a possibility to do stuff and extend the range of possibilities in digital context. So that's it.
01:03:59.610 - 01:04:39.674, Speaker B: Like, it's really that. Like, let's not overthink it, guys. Like, let's just create, like, nice rules and boundaries so that it makes it a safe environment for most. And if you don't do that and you don't come up with guidance, there's going to be an effective activity because people always profit on ambiguity and lack of clarity, which is difficult. And I think hopefully that's really the resounding message which is come up with some guidance and clear framework because, you know, that's what is allowing and that's the vector that allows for, you know, unfortunately, scams and all this stuff, right? I mean, it's not going to stop all them altogether. You always see scams, like, there's always a subset of games that want to do, like, scanning stuff, and you're going to catch them faster in a transparent system, I'll tell you that.
01:04:40.334 - 01:04:44.754, Speaker C: Definitely agree. So, Santi, anything else you want to talk about or you think we got to wrap it up?
01:04:45.694 - 01:05:11.418, Speaker B: I don't think so. I mean, I think we've covered it a lot. Maybe things that we're looking forward to just. I know we're probably entering, like, a slower part of the cycle, like, of the year. I guess summer tends to be, you know, a period where is a bit quiet, but things that you're looking forward to. I mean, I'm paying a lot of attention on account abstraction and some of the developments there. And I think it fits nicely with kind of how people think about, like, securing their assets and interacting on chain and whatnot.
01:05:11.418 - 01:05:18.894, Speaker B: But I'm curious if you are following certain things that you're launching your own podcast, of course, or you launch your own podcast, which is amazing to see.
01:05:20.514 - 01:05:35.160, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. I won't show yet. I won't show yet. I'm going to give, like, what I'm watching. Not necessarily, like, things that I'm, like, bullish on, but things that I'm interested in. So, like, we just had a season on Bell Curve about Mev, and I think we could have probably done, like, ten more episodes. I think that space is just so interesting.
01:05:35.160 - 01:06:19.044, Speaker C: I mean, I remember two years ago, and I'm sure some people say this now, like, Mev is going to be the death of crypto in some ways. And now people are more or less, like, embracing it, but they're just trying to find a way to stop almost the centralization and like the verticalization of that supply chain because there's so, there's so many incentives to do that. But anyway, I think it's wildly exciting, and Hassu talks about it here, and it's kind of gotten me on this wave of wanting to study more about Mev. I think the other thing that's going to be like a narrative that gets passed around, it probably has already started, is like soft versus hard finality. And by that I'm talking about an l two versus an l one. So, like on an l two, you can get a soft confirmation immediately from the sequencer saying that like, yes, you've made this trade, but it's not truly like, and that could be called soft finality, but it's not truly like hard finality or firm finality. People have different names for it until it hits the l one.
01:06:19.044 - 01:06:51.700, Speaker C: And you're already seeing this trend. We had an episode recently with shared sequencers, and we know how difficult that could be. And I think there's going to be a big push for the soft finality. And what do you need for that to count? Like, will users care most? Probably not, but will developers and will, like the owners of these, or the builders of these ecosystems? And I think part of it too, and this is me being a little less crypto than I should be, probably. But a lot of this people think we can control with economic weight. So if you have shared sequencers, they can stake, and if they do something wrong, you can slash them. And I think that's true.
01:06:51.700 - 01:07:21.330, Speaker C: But I also know there's going to be a scalable model, which is just reputations. Like you're going to have a shared sequencer group on certain l two s. And this is the cool thing with l two, is you get to pick where you want to play, right. But you could have a semi centralized, decentralized group of sequencers or these people that have to put up some form of id, and eventually maybe that could be decentralized id. But I just think reputation is like such a scalable model, and you can have that backed up with slashing. But today that's all we really talk about is economic weight and slashing these sequencers and like soft finality. But I think reputation will become a bigger and bigger thing.
01:07:21.330 - 01:07:23.534, Speaker C: And that's something like I'm going to be looking into.
01:07:24.194 - 01:08:16.412, Speaker B: Yeah, it fits nicely with the overall construct here, which is the, you have many flavors of choice, l one s, l two s, and ultimately, you know, I guess it is fair to say that to your point, many end users will not appreciate security. Don't today. The prime example is that like a lot of people into binance, smart chain when it launched and went to Pancakeswap at some point had more users and trades than uniswap. So I'm not, you know, I am mindful of that. But at the same time I think when you think about how the space over time, you mentioned Ben from stratecury, he has an aggregation theory which I think is going to play out in crypto as well, which is your financial institution. Like JP Morgan will decide to interact on chain at some point because it will streamline their back office compliance it will make, and this is an area that they want to cut because it's bloated. They want to find ways to streamline and increase margin.
01:08:16.412 - 01:09:03.337, Speaker B: And this is a very good way to do that by using blockchains. And so if you believe that to be true, think especially with regulation and clarity coming, then they're going to interact on chain, right? And smart contracts, atomic executions of mortgages and whatever, like. And, and so ultimately they will be sophisticated enough to appreciate security and a lot of these things and the user is going to trust them. There's always trust. Yep, full stop. You're always going to trust someone and delegate that trust to your financial institution, your aggregator. And I think that's why it's important to understand this because I think that will really shape the next iteration of how protocol development and things that really get traction and get hardened over time.
01:09:03.337 - 01:09:31.579, Speaker B: Time to truly, and if you have JPMorgan using Ethereum or a particular l two, that increases liquidity and liquidity begets more liquidity and then it becomes more efficient. Think about curve and why curve became so important. Because they got liquidity. And as soon as you hit a certain threshold, it's very secure and so it's very reinforcing. And that is really the boat here. And so it's really nice. We have all these different kind of possibilities, which is nice in an open source context.
01:09:31.579 - 01:10:16.300, Speaker B: You have really low barriers to entry. People can come and go, use a lot of these chains and we're all experimenting in some way shape or form. And so I'm constantly reminded of that. And this is why I kind of take this approach of like try different things and experiment because I think that's the phase that we are on as an industry right now. Over the next five years, I think we'll continue on this trajectory of trying different things, trying to decentralize sequencers trying to launch me advocate security and see if it works or blows shit up. And then ultimately when you see kind of the next real wave and onboarding of these aggregators that are going to open up and miss the space to so many other users, and I think a large part of that will be games. And then, and then DeFi, but certainly games.
01:10:16.300 - 01:10:36.684, Speaker B: Then I think it gets really interesting. Then I think you really can understand, okay, they're going to use Ethereum or they're going to use Solana or they're going to use something else. And maybe we haven't seen before or maybe it's Coinbase base. Right. I think Coinbase base probably, yeah. Is the one that I'm probably thinking that is going to attract the first users on chain.
01:10:36.724 - 01:10:37.420, Speaker C: Yep.
01:10:37.612 - 01:10:43.988, Speaker B: So yeah, I think I'm really excited. I'm, you know, just be patient.
01:10:44.156 - 01:10:57.844, Speaker C: Yeah. If you listen to this podcast, you're out of the game. I've been listening to it now for two years, so Sadi had me listen to it before I joined. I probably said this on the podcast, but it was Santi that read the producer position that got me on this. So I owe a lot to you, Sonny.
01:10:58.384 - 01:11:14.284, Speaker B: Hey, well, you're great, man. So every episode we come out with, I've been doing more and more reading and podcasts. So I'll do shout out to one book that I'm reading, which is so like, the title is so like cheesy, I guess, and cliche, but it's called how to invest.
01:11:14.864 - 01:11:20.214, Speaker C: Okay. I don't know how to be a billionaire, how to get rich and lose weight.
01:11:21.834 - 01:12:05.914, Speaker B: No, it doesn't promise the formula, but it's just, it's by David Rubenstein, the co founder of Carlisle, which I think is a legend. And he has a, he interviews some of the most successful investors across a number of different asset classes. Distressed debt, private equity, hedge funds, endowments. And how to invest is just a collection of interviews with, from people like Stan Dracomilia, which we've talked about in this episode, to John Paulson to, you know, the Soros fund, the Soros kind of family office, chief investment officer. Just a bunch of people. Right. And every chapter is fairly short, but different perspective on Jim Simmons from like, what's this fund renaissance, Seth Klarman.
01:12:05.914 - 01:12:22.064, Speaker B: Like, just like investors. Really nice books. So it's how to invest. Masters on the craft. Really nice. I've been enjoying it, haven't finished it, but I've taken really good snippets and then obviously the go and listen to the Stan Druckenmiller interview. It's on YouTube.
01:12:22.064 - 01:12:26.860, Speaker B: The song conference. There's two. Maybe listen to both. The one from last year and this.
01:12:26.892 - 01:12:29.908, Speaker C: Year and the snippet from that is.
01:12:29.996 - 01:12:57.528, Speaker B: Like, this is the hardest time to invest from someone who's been doing it in a successful fashion over the last, like, 60 years or so. Maybe 40 years. 50. Like, when you listen to someone like that say that, it's like, okay, gotta listen. That's. Yeah, so anyways, I've been really enjoying those, too. I don't know if you have maybe a movie or a book that you really enjoyed recently.
01:12:57.696 - 01:12:59.520, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm gonna have to check those out.
01:12:59.632 - 01:13:00.416, Speaker B: For me.
01:13:00.560 - 01:13:12.666, Speaker C: I'm reading one that sounds like classic crypto finance person. But how the Internet. How the Internet was made. I read it once. How do you know that happen? That's right. See, you know better than me because I've gifted. That book is right.
01:13:12.690 - 01:13:16.774, Speaker B: The gimbal book that I've recommended the most for people that want to learn about crypto.
01:13:17.714 - 01:13:37.970, Speaker C: How's the Internet happen? Is that book really. Yeah, it's. It's honestly so good. I'm probably, like, one third of the way through, but it. To me, it's just, like, especially someone that works in crypto, there's just so many similarities between the two. And I think, like, going back and learning those, that part of history and even crypto two years ago can help you so much and, like, shape how things have been set today. So I do that.
01:13:37.970 - 01:13:57.834, Speaker C: I gotta give one that's, like, the opposite. This is very, like, trap, bro ish. Have you seen workaholics or ever heard of it? Back in the day, they have a podcast called this is important. And it's the five main characters who just actually happen to be best friends. And they record now, ten years later every Tuesday. And that is just gonna be a pretty hilarious one. So I watched air.
01:13:57.834 - 01:14:00.738, Speaker C: I'll add air. I watched air the other day, and that was a cool show.
01:14:00.906 - 01:14:01.654, Speaker B: Air.
01:14:01.834 - 01:14:03.534, Speaker C: Nike. It's, like, Nike's new film.
01:14:03.574 - 01:14:05.662, Speaker B: Oh, wow. It's out. That's awesome.
01:14:05.718 - 01:14:10.798, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, you can stream it on Amazon. I think it was in theaters. And then I'll go live, like, on other places, I think a few months.
01:14:10.846 - 01:14:13.470, Speaker B: I thought you're gonna say succession, but no. Hey, I'll check that out.
01:14:13.502 - 01:14:18.382, Speaker C: Fisher, check it out. Okay. Before we log off, I got to finally do my shilling. So there we go.
01:14:18.478 - 01:14:20.878, Speaker B: There's always some chilling. Not gonna be permissible.
01:14:20.966 - 01:14:21.678, Speaker C: No, token.
01:14:21.766 - 01:14:24.954, Speaker B: The cheesy way to J, you better do it better than Jason because he does some.
01:14:25.974 - 01:14:55.792, Speaker C: Yeah, I have to cut it all out most time. Okay. So believe it or not, I am starting a podcast called Lightspeed with someone named Mert, who Mert has started Helios, which is like the main leading API and RPC provider in the Solana ecosystem. We've been talking about this podcast for months. I had no idea that I was going to be the one to co host it, but I honestly couldn't be more psyched. And at the end of the day, we really need real products solving real problems. We've been talking about that in this podcast and things that are uniquely enabled by crypto.
01:14:55.792 - 01:15:29.022, Speaker C: And that's more or less what this podcast is going to focus on. I love the Steve Jobs quote where it's like, start with the user experience and work back to the technology, not the other way around. And I think sometimes in crypto we might start with the philosophy and not with the tech part or the user. And that's something we want to highlight, ecosystems and people and projects that are doing that. Super excited to host this. He knows a ton about the Solana ecosystem, so we're definitely going to cover projects there, but like, we're going to cover many, many ecosystems, projects founders. I say we wanted to be the selling point, crypto's most innovative communities.
01:15:29.022 - 01:15:35.670, Speaker C: So I'm going to rug pull empire there. I have to go for it. I have to go for it.
01:15:35.822 - 01:15:39.534, Speaker B: I'll be happy. Just don't stop ever doing the show notes. They're amazing.
01:15:39.574 - 01:16:04.348, Speaker C: Yeah. And by, you know, we talked about trajectory and Big Ben Thompson. Like, my inspiration for this, and we'll see how I do, is to take strategy meets my first million pod, which is more or less about, like, business and coming up with new ideas, but it's like super entertaining and making that light speed. So I'm super pumped about it. We just did our announcement today, and the first episode is going to go live in June. So I'll put a link to the show notes for the Twitter. You're not going to be able to listen to anything because it's not there yet.
01:16:04.348 - 01:16:05.864, Speaker C: But yeah, we're super excited.
01:16:06.204 - 01:16:11.800, Speaker B: That's awesome. Well, I'm really excited for you guys. I think you're going to crush it out and it's a great duo. So best of luck to you, sir.
01:16:11.972 - 01:16:14.504, Speaker C: Sweet. Santi. Well, hey, thanks for having me on.
01:16:14.584 - 01:16:28.584, Speaker B: This is great. Yeah. Jason, if you don't come back from your honeymoon, which is possible scenario, well dared, your permanence you're always welcome back. So anyways, thanks, everyone, for listening. Hope you have a great weekend wherever you're listening from, and we'll see you here next week.
