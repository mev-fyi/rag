00:00:00.280 - 00:00:20.014, Speaker A: I would not give out. And if people want to complain and bitch about the fact that they're not getting 50% of the token supply, I'm like, well, fuck off. Like, what have you done? Oh, you want a pudgy penguin? Oh, cool. Okay. Why is it that you need to get $30,000? Forget about the value. It's like, why? And people, I think, are entitled in this space just. It just bothers me the wrong way.
00:00:20.014 - 00:00:32.394, Speaker A: My theory is a lot of this airdrops has been a result of dancing around lack of regulation and saying, okay, we need to, like, decentralize as quickly as possible. Yada, yada, yada.
00:00:33.174 - 00:01:03.140, Speaker B: If you are an empire listener, hopefully you've played around on chain. And if you have done that, you know that transferring assets across different chains is a pain, to put it nicely. That is why we are incredibly excited to have the wormhole foundation as a partner of the Empire podcast, stewards of the wormhole protocol, supporting over 30 different blockchains and six different runtimes. Stay tuned. Later in the show, we have a cool thing that you can claim, which is a wormhole. Nft. Just for Empire listeners, this episode is brought to you by PayPal here at Empire.
00:01:03.140 - 00:01:43.068, Speaker B: You know that Santee and I are really into real world use cases and always on the lookout for the next killer blockchain app. We're excited to share that PayPal has arrived in crypto to unveil a way to seamlessly connect fiat to digital currencies. Later in the show, you will find out how you can use Pyusd to check out at millions of online stores. What's up, everyone? Before we jump into the episode, little plug for digital asset summit coming up in London, March 18 to 20th. Tickets are pacing so far ahead of schedule that we had to decrease the discount code. So instead of Empire 20, it is now Empire ten. Head over to the website digital asset summit Das London, March 18 to 20th.
00:01:43.068 - 00:01:55.064, Speaker B: Use code Empire ten and get 10% off your ticket. See you in London. And we're back. What up, man?
00:01:55.564 - 00:01:59.844, Speaker A: Hey, it's good to be back. Is this our first of the year, dude?
00:01:59.884 - 00:02:02.004, Speaker B: We have. We have been slacken.
00:02:02.584 - 00:02:07.504, Speaker A: I don't know. I've been. I've been busy, man. I just, you know, tell the people.
00:02:07.544 - 00:02:09.480, Speaker B: What you've been busy with.
00:02:09.672 - 00:02:34.276, Speaker A: I've been trying to ski, but the snow is like, I skied in -35 got frost bit on my. Both of my feet. I still really haven't recovered, so the nerves are something you don't want to fuck around with. Right. And I've got in my hands. When I was climbing kilimanjaro years ago, it was really cold. And then this time, ski -35 deep powder, like.
00:02:34.276 - 00:02:54.042, Speaker A: Yeah, my feet got extremely cold for 8 hours. I was out skiing and backcountry, and I had to go to the hospital just to make rule out proper frost bite. So my feet were not black. But I lost all sensibility, like. And so now I still haven't recovered at all. So the nerves, like, take. They're irritated, so they take.
00:02:54.042 - 00:02:59.426, Speaker A: It's gonna take some time, but for a while there, I thought I was gonna not be able to, like, first.
00:02:59.490 - 00:03:01.534, Speaker B: World problem I have ever heard.
00:03:03.354 - 00:03:14.654, Speaker A: God damn it. See, this is why I don't share anything about my private life. This is why I don't share anything about my private life other than running. And I guess that's also, I don't know, first world problem. I don't know.
00:03:15.074 - 00:03:16.854, Speaker B: No, but good. Good trip, though.
00:03:17.154 - 00:03:20.322, Speaker A: It was good trip. It's great trip. Got my dad see some folks that.
00:03:20.338 - 00:03:21.648, Speaker B: I love to ski with. It's.
00:03:21.746 - 00:03:22.636, Speaker A: I love skiing.
00:03:22.740 - 00:03:23.100, Speaker B: Nice.
00:03:23.172 - 00:03:25.544, Speaker A: Skiing is, like, my favorite second sport.
00:03:26.244 - 00:03:27.464, Speaker B: Outside of running.
00:03:27.844 - 00:03:31.020, Speaker A: Outside of running inside. Well, third after running and cycling.
00:03:31.172 - 00:03:34.344, Speaker B: You like those solo sports, huh? Not. Not a big team guy.
00:03:34.884 - 00:03:49.354, Speaker A: Yeah. This is when, like, people tell me to raise like you want to. I'm, like, perfectly fine having a fun by myself, because I don't. Yeah. Although someone told me recently I'd make a great father. I spend a lot of time with. My sister has two kids, and I love.
00:03:49.354 - 00:03:56.754, Speaker A: I spent, like, last two months with them, and, God, I love kids, but, uh, someone told me that I would make a good dad, for what it's worth.
00:03:56.834 - 00:04:00.894, Speaker B: Is this, uh, you putting your hand up on Empire and saying, hey, ladies, ladies.
00:04:02.234 - 00:04:11.402, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't. Where I live, I don't think I'm gonna find a lot of wife material, but, hey, maybe in a blockworks conference, and this is the plug. I know.
00:04:11.458 - 00:04:18.184, Speaker B: Yeah, I I know where you'll find them. Das baby. And if you're not permissionless, that is wife material at permissionless.
00:04:18.484 - 00:04:24.860, Speaker A: Yeah, dude. I don't know. I don't know if I'll find it in the crypto sphere, but either. But sure, I'll give it a try.
00:04:24.972 - 00:04:26.084, Speaker B: Give it a try. Yeah.
00:04:26.124 - 00:04:33.180, Speaker A: Who's going to build Tinder? Decentralized Tinder? I haven't heard that pitch in a while. Actually, I have, but I passed on it.
00:04:33.332 - 00:04:59.654, Speaker B: So what's, uh. What are we talking? So there's. There's two things. On my mind, there's farcaster, um, which I kind of feel like has already been beaten to death in the, in the pods and on twitter and stuff like that. But maybe could share my take around it and would also love to hear, like, why you're not on it. And maybe I can share how we're thinking about it at blockworks as a company, and I've heard a lot of, like, user takes, but I can share how we're thinking about it at blockworks. And then the other topic is these airdrops, the dimension airdrop happened.
00:04:59.654 - 00:05:13.506, Speaker B: There's a pretty interesting airdrop strategy that is forming the cycle that, yeah, I'd love to talk about. So why don't we start with Farcaster? What is your experience with, with far? Or I can, I can, maybe I haven't tried it.
00:05:13.610 - 00:05:38.154, Speaker A: But I'll say one thing. Before we talk about forecaster, can we just talk about friend tech? Because I resisted going there, and I know I'm not trying to make the comparison between the two totally different, but, yeah, like, Fred tech, I want to talk about that because I didn't join. Guess newsflash. Tokenizing and trading and monetizing your friends turned out to be a terrible idea. Wow. Who would have thought?
00:05:38.774 - 00:05:43.942, Speaker B: Let's talk about this then. All right, I'll give it to you. You were right. You were right.
00:05:44.078 - 00:05:46.994, Speaker A: There's, we shouldn't financialize everything.
00:05:47.774 - 00:05:48.926, Speaker B: No, you're right about that.
00:05:49.030 - 00:05:49.414, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:05:49.494 - 00:05:59.750, Speaker B: I mean, good call not joining Frontech. What is your thought process when it comes to joining? How do you decide if you want to join and, like, test and dabble with new things in crypto?
00:05:59.822 - 00:06:28.988, Speaker A: So, look, I'm an investor in lens. It was just a relationship check. I love Stani. You know, he's a girlfriend. And do I believe in decentralized social media? Yeah, I hope because, like, so most recently contacted an agency because I wanted to build, I have a website that I haven't, like, launched publicly. But I was thinking the other day, I'm like, well, what happens if, like, first of all, the search functionality of x absolutely sucks. I just want to have more agency over my content.
00:06:28.988 - 00:06:48.784, Speaker A: So I believe decentralized social media is really good. It will serve a purpose. Like, look at, what is it? The journalist Tucker Carl Carlson. Carlson, he's going to Russia interviewing Putin. It's shocking. We don't have to talk about how media is just terrible. But I think there is a time, like, there's going to be an increasing need.
00:06:48.784 - 00:07:03.934, Speaker A: Yeah, I know. I believe it. Like, you want to have control and agency over your content and where it lives. Right. And storing it. And so, look, farcaster, I spoke with Dan years ago. I think he's an incredible smart guy.
00:07:03.934 - 00:07:21.094, Speaker A: And early, he was early coinbase employee. And I'm very happy to see the success of Forecaster. I just been too lazy. I've been traveling and so I haven't gone to it. I will get to it. The thing about lens, for instance, lens, and I've talked to Stani about this a lot, so I'll say it here as well. Is that friction.
00:07:21.094 - 00:08:00.902, Speaker A: Right. Of give me something where I can post on Twitter and then it automatically pushes it out to Farcaster. Now, I've heard some really interesting takes from chao and a few other folks that say it has felt, and I'd love to get your take that up. The most recently, there was an inflection point where the engagement there is higher, the conversation's better. And so some people have stopped thinking about Twitter first, then Farcaster. It's now like, no, I'm just going to go to Farcaster. So I'd be really curious to hear your experience, because I can't talk about it from firsthand experience, other than just anecdotally what I've seen from other people, like, in their experience with.
00:08:00.902 - 00:08:02.942, Speaker A: So what has it been for you?
00:08:03.118 - 00:08:20.444, Speaker B: I've, I've loved it. I've loved it. So my experience with farcasters, I joined April 2022, and I lost my seed phrase and there was no way to recover it. And so I had to restart my account this past weekend. So that's my.
00:08:20.984 - 00:08:26.600, Speaker A: When you say restart, like create a new one. And like, was it like add jason?
00:08:26.712 - 00:08:47.732, Speaker B: I got. Yeah, I got no, I got at Yano. And I got it at Yano. And I was like, early, these fids, which is like your farcaster id, I was like, number, I don't know, a couple hundred. Like, it was called 300 or 500 or 400, something like that, I think. And I got Yano, but I was so I didn't do literally anything with it for 18 months. Shame on me.
00:08:47.732 - 00:09:04.084, Speaker B: So I had to start over, but it's my fault. Um, so I got it. So I re. Okay. So I had a to do list. So basically, here's what happened. About a week and a half ago, forecast was blowing up all my, a lot of, like, my crypto friends were like, all right, buddy, you gotta get on forecaster, like, now it's time.
00:09:04.084 - 00:09:33.144, Speaker B: So I was like, all right, I'll do it. Had a thing on my to do list for Saturday morning or Sunday morning to just get on Farcaster. I usually spend like one day of the weekend just like doing some experiment stuff with crypto. Had the episode with Jesse, Walden and Antonio where they talked about. Did you end up listening to that? Probably not. You were skiing. We had this episode with and Antonio from Spindle, Jesse from variant where we talked about headless marketplaces, Farcaster and frames.
00:09:33.144 - 00:10:08.898, Speaker B: And that was probably, I have these empire episodes where every one, once every quarter, let's call it, or once every three to six months, where mind is blown big. Makes me take action on something outside of just like, oh, go buy token or something like that. And this was that episode. So I got off this was completely, went over to Mike in the office, said blockworks has to make a push onto farcaster in a big way. Spent about six to 8 hours on Sunday getting deep into Farcaster. Set up the blockworks channels. Blockworks research channels or accounts.
00:10:08.898 - 00:10:11.850, Speaker B: I set up channels as well, which I can explain if surprising.
00:10:11.922 - 00:10:14.354, Speaker A: No one was like, squatting on app block works on.
00:10:14.434 - 00:10:39.846, Speaker B: So actually someone was squatting on blockworks. We're probably going to have to pay, like, I don't know, ten k to buy the ENS, because on Farcaster, you can create an account and then you can also. But if you own the ens, you can actually take that account with that. Like, ENS has the priority, I think, is how it works, which is pretty cool. And, yeah, I set up my thing and I'm pretty hooked. Like, I now open Warpcast. So the way it works.
00:10:39.846 - 00:11:07.604, Speaker B: So Farcaster is the protocol. Farcaster is the protocol. Warpcast is one of the many clients that plug in that sits on top of Farcaster. My understanding is Warpcast, I think, is pretty centralized entity Farcaster is built on top of. I can't fully figure it out if it's optimism or base, or some part of it is optimism, some part of it is base. Obviously, base leverages the op stack. But, yeah, it's been great.
00:11:07.604 - 00:11:10.160, Speaker B: I really enjoyed it.
00:11:10.232 - 00:11:14.084, Speaker A: What do you like about it? Who's there? How many followers do you have?
00:11:15.224 - 00:11:21.088, Speaker B: 400 followers. I am racing Mike to 10,000. Mike is all that. Yeah.
00:11:21.136 - 00:11:29.254, Speaker A: Hopefully you follow through if you win on the bet, because you didn't. I'm gonna say it again, but we had a bet of who had the most amount of followers.
00:11:31.074 - 00:11:35.534, Speaker B: I'm gonna pull this episode up because I don't think I promised to shave my head.
00:11:36.874 - 00:12:00.594, Speaker A: I mean, I have many flaws, but memory is not one of them. Dude, I have a pretty good memory. So yeah, I beached to it. Breakpoint. I'm still ahead now by a wider margin. You didn't even shave your head, so whatever. I'm just gonna say, mike, if you're listening, hope you are, make sure that you have a bet that, you know, I don't know, you follow through.
00:12:01.094 - 00:12:03.486, Speaker B: All right, shots fired. So.
00:12:03.630 - 00:12:07.302, Speaker A: But, like, the important stuff, like, what do you like about it? Like, what is it?
00:12:07.318 - 00:12:38.254, Speaker B: Okay, so, special sauce. All right. The first thing I like is it's basically the highest signal to noise out there, and that's like an overuse state, like, signal to noise, I think, overuse statement. But the people on there are the people that I care about and that I want to interact with. So when I open my Twitter notifications, it's a cesspool. Like, there's no notification I get on Twitter anymore where it's like, or maybe there's one out of every 50 notifications where it's like, I want to interact with that. And it's a lot of folks where, like, I don't know, it's just not, it's not.
00:12:38.254 - 00:13:13.838, Speaker B: It doesn't lead to interesting discussions, basically. So, like, the way I think about Twitter right now is it's, like, big distribution channel to, like, get things out there. Farcaster, for me, is like, everyone on Farcaster is very crypto native and very, like, high signal. And it's, when I think of Farcaster, it's more like conversations. I'm like, I can actually have conversations on Farcaster. Whereas Twitter is like, yeah, there's a lot of, like, either super retail driven or very, like, maximalist and ideologies. Farcaster doesn't have any of that.
00:13:13.838 - 00:13:32.934, Speaker B: I would say, like, the underlying ideology of Farcaster is curiosity. It's very kind and nice platform with a lot of curiosity and a lot of interesting conversations happening. All right, so that's my first bucket. Second bucket that I like is there are these things called channels. Do you know how these work? Have you heard of these?
00:13:33.514 - 00:13:34.210, Speaker A: Nope.
00:13:34.322 - 00:13:58.396, Speaker B: Okay, so you create an account, like, you would create a Twitter account. You can create an account, like, at Santiago. That's your account. Then you have channels. Channels are. I can't actually, the best way I'd describe a channel is a mix. It's kind of a mix between a Discord channel that you can hang out in or a Telegram group that you could hang out in, combined with, like, a Reddit channel.
00:13:58.396 - 00:14:24.722, Speaker B: So there's a channel, like, it's like, on Reddit, it's like R NVA or something. So we actually have R Empire. We have an Empire channel. So anyone listening to the empire, to Empire there? People are going on there and they're like, hey, great episode on headless marketplaces. Like, follow up question to that episode. I wanted to get your guys take on this, and I'll respond to it, and we have a great conversation there. Hey, thought Ilia.
00:14:24.722 - 00:14:49.904, Speaker B: Podcast on AI and near was pretty interesting. As a follow up, I'd love to hear from this person, or I'd love to see. So that's a channel. There's a channel for NBA, there's a channel for people in New York City, and there's all these great channels that people are hanging out in, and so you can post to the channel. So that's the second bucket. The third bucket is the experimentation that's happening there. Have you seen, do you know what frames are, Santi?
00:14:50.524 - 00:14:51.384, Speaker A: Nope.
00:14:51.684 - 00:14:52.396, Speaker B: Cool.
00:14:52.540 - 00:14:54.932, Speaker A: Making me look like a noob here, but I love it.
00:14:54.948 - 00:15:30.424, Speaker B: It's the first time in my life I can do that. So I'm taking advantage of it. So frames are basically the ability to embed actions and applications inside of your feed. So the best way to think about this, I think, is, so imagine you make a tweet right now. The only thing you embed in that tweet is, like a poll. You can either add a picture into that tweet, or you could add a poll. But what if you could actually add kind of anything? What if you could add the ability to book a conference ticket directly inside of a tweet or subscribe to a newsletter inside of a tweet? Or mint an NFT directly inside of a tweet?
00:15:31.444 - 00:15:31.804, Speaker A: No.
00:15:31.844 - 00:15:53.348, Speaker B: Boy, there's all of these interesting things that are happening. So that's what frames are. They basically make posts programmable. And then you can do, because they're programmable, you can actually bake in these parameters. So Royal is like an NFT music platform.
00:15:53.396 - 00:15:54.484, Speaker A: Yeah, this is blouse thing.
00:15:54.524 - 00:16:09.084, Speaker B: Blouse thing. So blouse, like, go mint this thing. And I was like, I'm trying to mint it. It's not working. And he goes, oh, we programmed it. So you have to follow Royal first to be able to mint. So you follow Royal, then you can mint.
00:16:09.084 - 00:16:24.184, Speaker B: And there's all these different programs. So you could say so, but if you extend this out, it's like, okay, well, maybe I only want my mint to happen for people who have a pudgy in their wallet and have traded over one hundred k of volume on uniswap and bought a permissionless ticket last year.
00:16:24.584 - 00:16:25.080, Speaker A: Boom.
00:16:25.152 - 00:16:29.392, Speaker B: Vip client. Those are the people who can mint something or another. Right.
00:16:29.448 - 00:16:44.456, Speaker A: So that was like the best take that. I've heard that forecaster might become like the primary distribution channel for initially crypto projects, but also extend that further. And not just crypto projects, this programmability.
00:16:44.520 - 00:16:53.816, Speaker B: And so it's frames. That was like the light bulb moment for me on why this went from an application that I think I should play around with to an application that block work should.
00:16:53.960 - 00:17:13.032, Speaker A: Yeah. From a distribution standpoint, hey, we're going to give out this merch if you. But how can you prove, like, hey, you've listened to, it's not merch. X amount of hours. No merch. But like, you're going to get X or Y based on. How can you stitch that? Is someone working on, like, if you've listened to x amount of podcast hours.
00:17:13.208 - 00:17:34.024, Speaker B: Yeah. So take out the programmability for a second. If you just think about. All right, so block works. Here's how we might sell a ticket. We build up our permissionless channel on Twitter, or let's say it doesn't matter about the permissionless handle. Let's say I put, if we want to sell a permissionless ticket on social, I'm going to post a link to our permissionless channel or to our permissionless event page on my Twitter.
00:17:34.024 - 00:18:04.274, Speaker B: The first thing that happens is Twitter throttles that link, or they throttle the post because they are creating, they're basically a walled garden and they don't want people, they don't want users to leave their platform. So any external link is going to get throttled. That's why if you post any sort of external link, your post is going to do much, much worse because they make money from ad revenue. The less time you spend on the platform, the less ad revenue they get. So first off, post gets throttled. But for anyone who does see the post, you asante, you click that event page. You then go to the blockworks website.
00:18:04.274 - 00:18:21.966, Speaker B: You click, you scroll down till you hit buy ticket. You click buy ticket. It opens up an embed from our event platform called universe. You put in your credit card details. They have an, they have a link with stripe. You buy the tickets like eight or nine steps, basically to buy, buy a ticket. Now what you can do, they get.
00:18:21.990 - 00:18:26.126, Speaker A: The Boy Scouts campaign going on frames and it was like a huge success.
00:18:26.230 - 00:18:46.166, Speaker B: Girl scouts. Yeah, exactly. So now what you can do is, what we can do at blockworks is we can post a link to the event page and then inside of that tweet, hey, just announced Santiago as a speaker buy your ticket today for 10% off inside of that tweet, you can, um. What you eatin'over there?
00:18:46.310 - 00:18:50.502, Speaker A: No, it's like a lemon seed. I like putting lemon in my sparkling water.
00:18:50.558 - 00:19:01.662, Speaker B: It was just like, inside of that tweet. You can literally make sure you're watching because. Because farcaster, every farcaster account has a wallet. You can literally just click, buy ticket.
00:19:01.798 - 00:19:02.470, Speaker A: Boom.
00:19:02.622 - 00:19:06.722, Speaker B: Like that. You just bought a permissionless ticket. Subscribe to a newsletter. Same thing, right?
00:19:06.778 - 00:19:26.634, Speaker A: Maybe the folks said, ETH Denver, if they're listening, should adopt this strategy, because I heard it took eight steps to buy God. Every time there's an ETH event, you're just constantly reminded of how little intuition they have in terms of making stuff easier for folks. I'm like, you purposely, I remember Devcon in Osaka. Like, there was two elevators for the entire conference.
00:19:26.674 - 00:19:29.426, Speaker B: I'm like, God, DEfCon is like, purposefully bad, though.
00:19:29.450 - 00:19:37.636, Speaker A: It's like, makes it, it's like you're purposely building, like, barbed wire and fences for people to, like, push away, like normies. I'm like, okay.
00:19:37.780 - 00:20:06.474, Speaker B: So anyways, yeah, I'm very excited about this. So this, like, frames were the thing that got me. We had our leadership meeting this week at blockworks, and I said, look, we're, you guys gotta understand frames. We're making a big push into farcaster and frames, and we have our monthly kickoff with the whole company next week and a little sneak peek for any blockworks folks listening to this. We're talking about forecaster. Like, this is a big part of blockwork strategy today. It impacts everyone.
00:20:06.474 - 00:20:14.298, Speaker B: It impacts marketing, it impacts editorial, it impacts the events team, it impacts podcasts. Right? So we're excited about it.
00:20:14.466 - 00:20:33.932, Speaker A: Yeah, I gotta join. I'll join. I'll put it, I'll add it to the top of the list. What's the, how big does this get? Does it actually displace x? What do you see as the monetization strategy for Farcaster? Like, what's your take?
00:20:34.068 - 00:20:51.504, Speaker B: So I don't know, is the real answer basically? What I think Farcaster ends up becoming is I don't think of Farcaster as a social media platform. I think a farcaster is a proof of identity, basically, which as AI is becoming this incredible, like these, you know?
00:20:52.664 - 00:20:57.324, Speaker A: But why couldn't a bot just create a forecaster account and just roll with it?
00:20:58.704 - 00:21:01.440, Speaker B: Why couldn't a bot create, a bot.
00:21:01.472 - 00:21:11.472, Speaker A: Creates a farcaster account, multiple forecaster accounts, and, you know, you have the civil resistance problem you're alluding to is, how does that how is that solved?
00:21:11.608 - 00:21:23.298, Speaker B: I think there's two ways. One is I think there will end up being something for folks who connect their ensuring. And I don't know if a bot can do that or if that's like too complex. The second thing is, but they, as.
00:21:23.306 - 00:21:26.874, Speaker A: Far as I know, anyone can create any, buy an enzyme.
00:21:27.034 - 00:21:31.962, Speaker B: You actually pay. You actually pay for forecaster. So you are paying much, is it?
00:21:32.098 - 00:21:34.146, Speaker A: You forgot to disclose it. Maybe that should have been like the.
00:21:34.170 - 00:21:40.266, Speaker B: First $.5 a year or $7 a year for storage, essentially, yeah.
00:21:40.330 - 00:21:45.486, Speaker A: Who's providing the storage currently? Um, sounds like them.
00:21:45.590 - 00:22:04.214, Speaker B: I don't know. I don't actually know. I think how it works is Warpcast is built by the Farcaster team, it's a centralized client, and a lot of that data is stored off chain. And you're paying them for that for storage space. I think that's how it works, yeah.
00:22:04.294 - 00:22:35.596, Speaker A: It'Ll be really cool. Have you seen instances where there's just a lot of stuff that x could do that they haven't? Like a lot of, if you're paying for premium, you're, you're gonna tweet more than 140 characters. And so a lot of that ends up becoming a blog post. I've wanted to see and shout out to Murd, who was actually the one who had this idea. And I saw it, I thought it was geniuses. Like give me a tab in my profile where I can make long form tweets into a block content as opposed to people go into sub stack when I just embed it on Twitter. And like, I would love to do that.
00:22:35.596 - 00:22:56.184, Speaker A: Like to have the ability to, and I now I think they've rolled out a similar, like some features. But anyways, all this to say, like, you know, what's that mirror, for instance, like, if you post a really good, whatever they call posts on, can people have the ability to like mirror collect that as an NFT if they really.
00:22:56.224 - 00:23:29.318, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know if mirror has done this, but someone else did this, where you can actually, inside of a frame, you can read the article inside of the frame and then you can collect it as well. Inside of the frame. Okay, here's why I like, here's why I think this is very different than friend tech and very different, like why I'm so excited about this. This in my mind, has the ability to be the first ever breakout use case of crypto. That's non speculative. So anything that's gone kind of mainstream in crypto, like nfts at the end of the day. Like, why were normies buying bored apes? Not for the art.
00:23:29.406 - 00:23:31.474, Speaker A: They're buying speculating.
00:23:32.014 - 00:23:38.486, Speaker B: And I think this is the first. Could be the first thing that, uh. Yeah, could be the first thing.
00:23:38.550 - 00:23:56.998, Speaker A: So, yeah. Yeah. I think the activation, the. The cold start problem for social media is very real. Um, and you have to insert yourself in the flow, um, of how do you capture that attention and the. It's been an uphill battle, at least for me, to. I'm just so ingrained, embedded in.
00:23:56.998 - 00:24:04.068, Speaker A: In x and constantly use it. But, yeah, I'll have to check it out and then report back on the experience.
00:24:04.196 - 00:24:11.876, Speaker B: It's the most excited I've ever seen people in crypto be about something that doesn't have where actually you're paying them. They're not even paying you. Right.
00:24:11.940 - 00:24:12.140, Speaker A: Good.
00:24:12.172 - 00:24:12.484, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:24:12.564 - 00:24:21.864, Speaker A: That's always a good hallmark. I mean, to be fair, a lot of people were really excited about Frentek, and then. And by no means am I comparing.
00:24:22.604 - 00:24:25.364, Speaker B: People are excited about Fronteco. People thought they were making money.
00:24:25.484 - 00:24:25.804, Speaker A: Correct?
00:24:25.844 - 00:24:26.464, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:24:27.314 - 00:24:40.570, Speaker A: Yep. I agree. Interesting. Okay, well, thank you. Similar to. You were on a podcast where you were prompted to go in. I will credit you for going on forecaster then.
00:24:40.602 - 00:24:53.542, Speaker B: So I'll do that now. I can share the secret. Hold on. Let me pull up my post to make sure I get this right. So, it's called a cast. I think you cast it this morning. Said empire Roundup today.
00:24:53.542 - 00:24:56.554, Speaker B: Goal is to convince Santi to join Farcaster.
00:24:56.974 - 00:25:04.190, Speaker A: So, for everyone, I will follow through, because I'm a man of my word, I think. I know. And so, do you know how bad.
00:25:04.222 - 00:25:06.954, Speaker B: I would look as a. As a. As a bald man?
00:25:08.094 - 00:25:16.274, Speaker A: I mean, you look bad already, dude, we all look bad. I mean, look, we're aging to two x, a speed I've given up on.
00:25:16.814 - 00:25:23.218, Speaker B: We were sitting in a meeting the other day, and Mike looked at me. He goes, dude, you have so many gray hairs, man.
00:25:23.386 - 00:25:39.734, Speaker A: You've already, like, you're married. You're golden, man. Us mortals over here need a struggle. Brian Johnson. Like, longevity kind of things, running marathons here and there to, like, stay, stay in the game.
00:25:41.674 - 00:26:45.534, Speaker B: Hey, everyone wanted to give a big shout out to today's sponsor, wormhole foundation, stewards of the wormhole protocol. If you are like Santi and I and you play around on chain, you know how bad the cross chain experience is today? Well, Wormhole has set out to solve that, powering cross chain transfers for over 200 different multi chain teams, including some of the best, like Uniswap and circle. So what does that mean for you, the Empire listener? This opens up a huge number of multi chain use cases across defi, nfts, governance, oracles and more, by supporting over 30 different blockchains and six different runtimes, including Sui Solana, different ETH L two s theorem, and a whole bunch more. That means you have now the most powerful interoperability platform at your fingertips. If you're a developer, you'll be excited to hear that wormhole provides an extensive suite of tools and infrastructure so that you can securely build multi chain applications. But don't just take our word for it. Obviously, wormhole protocol leads the industry in all time.
00:26:45.534 - 00:27:05.432, Speaker B: Messages transferred with over 900 million cross chain messages. 900 million. That is close to a billion. And that's a big number of messages. As a thank you, Wormhole foundation is dropping exclusive nfts. That's right, we got some exclusive nfts for Empire listeners. Hit the link in the description to claim your unique wormhole NFT.
00:27:05.432 - 00:27:47.724, Speaker B: Today, the days of not using crypto for really anything in the real world are over. It is time to start using crypto in everyday transactions, whether that's shopping online or just buying a bagel on the street. We're excited to tell you about PY USD, PayPal's entrance into web3. PayPal is proud to share an open letter to the crypto community that outlines their commitment, their roadmap, and their goals in the digital currency space. PyUSD seeks to transform how you interact with your digital assets available today. You can send your crypto to your PayPal account, swap it for Pyusd, and then use it to check out at millions of stores. PayPal invites you, all the empire listeners, to be a part of this journey.
00:27:47.724 - 00:28:09.768, Speaker B: Hit the link in the description of today's episode to read PayPal's open letter to the community. It gives you a really good sense of what their vision is. Take the next step by signing up for a PayPal account. Today. The future of crypto payments starts with PayPal. Let's talk airdrops. So, yeah, a lot of those.
00:28:09.768 - 00:28:17.884, Speaker B: Let's start with a dimension airdrop, maybe. So this week there was a dimension airdrop, and it was bit, what is dimension?
00:28:18.824 - 00:28:23.484, Speaker A: What was that? What is dimension? For everyone listening out there?
00:28:24.104 - 00:28:32.724, Speaker B: They're trying to basically replace ETH, I think, as the consensus layer for app roll ups is my understanding of dimension.
00:28:34.124 - 00:28:34.864, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:28:36.284 - 00:28:37.344, Speaker B: What do I do there?
00:28:38.644 - 00:28:43.572, Speaker A: Accurate ish. No one really knows. But it's provocative.
00:28:43.628 - 00:28:44.784, Speaker B: But it's provocative.
00:28:45.244 - 00:28:50.556, Speaker A: Yeah. I don't really know. That was my layman understanding of dimension as well.
00:28:50.660 - 00:29:08.198, Speaker B: Yeah. I think the idea is like, if you look at today's optimistic roll ups, they depend on ETH for consensus, right. Like to validate the fraud proofs. And they can use external. Oh, God, I hope. I'm probably going to botch this. They can use external DA, like Celestia to reduce the roll up transaction costs.
00:29:08.198 - 00:29:26.874, Speaker B: But dimension offers the same solution via roll apps, but replaces ETH as the consensus layer here. So. And I think they use, I think dimension. If you are roll up on dimension, use the cosmos SDK to. Oh, boy. Yeah. To implement.
00:29:26.874 - 00:29:40.974, Speaker B: But then you del, you're delegating consensus and security to the dimension hub and to, like, to the dim dym stakers. That's my fifth grade understanding of this.
00:29:41.834 - 00:30:01.506, Speaker A: Yeah, dimension hub is meant to be like. Yeah, yeah. The dimension hub is meant to be the l one. And then you have this, all these different apps, role apps, uh, not roll ups, roll apps that are the L2s. And so it's meant to be that kind of security hub. And you're attracting a lot of these.
00:30:01.530 - 00:30:11.130, Speaker B: Validators and like, and you've got the dimension hub, right. Is the, is. Now you have this like liquidity layer that can flow across all the roll apps and now you don't have to go recruit a bunch of validators and.
00:30:11.202 - 00:30:50.832, Speaker A: Yeah, look, uh, yeah, one of the more interesting teams I've talked to and I would love to have them on the pod and is there's been a lot of up, like a lot of really interesting stuff in cosmos happening. Um, for, for real this time. Um, like, particularly mesh security is one very interesting thing. So like what? Oh, like the core premise is like, so if you're a dy DX, you move over from ethereum, you build your own app chain. Someone like dy DX already has a lot of traction. It's easy to recruit validators for that. But if you're a new project and you want to like deploy your own app chain, you have to pay a, it's very expensive because you have to have these crazy inflation curves to attract validators.
00:30:50.832 - 00:31:20.494, Speaker A: And like, at the end of the day, you need to bootstrap security. The only way you do that is you need to attract, you need to attract validators. Validators have opportunity costs, so you need to incentivize them. And that has become, has been very expensive. Now, I think what you're doing with like mesh security opens up the possibility to, for example, take restaked ETH and use that as the security substrate through Eigen layer. And, like, this project ethos, for instance. I spoke with them, like, in January, like to have them on, have a really good conversation.
00:31:20.494 - 00:31:57.970, Speaker A: And I just think the ability to launch app chains is going to. And the cost to do that to recruit and attract validators, is going to be a major theme this year. And so it's very exciting with, obviously, the restaking of security and the allocation of that in a more efficient manner. Basically, the core thesis, vigon layer is going to have 2nd, 1st, 2nd order effects into cosmos and app chains, actually. And so, yeah, really exciting. I mean, now you have bitcoin, l two.
00:31:58.002 - 00:32:00.250, Speaker B: So how do you, how do you bet on that, though? Like, how do you.
00:32:00.322 - 00:32:04.574, Speaker A: You're not reaching out to the team? No, I reach out to the team and try to invest before anyone else does.
00:32:04.914 - 00:32:11.954, Speaker B: So there's no, like, if you want to bet. I think Cosmos is quite interesting because there's no token that actually, look, uh, the.
00:32:12.034 - 00:32:26.940, Speaker A: The issue of having Cosmos is, like, I believe in. In the technology. I just have never felt that there was a strong enough link in atom as a security substrate. I've always struggled with, like, I felt very excited about Cosmos, not so much Adam.
00:32:27.092 - 00:32:27.784, Speaker B: Right.
00:32:29.764 - 00:32:57.960, Speaker A: And so, yeah. How do you bet on Cosmos generally, IBC? Well, you know, I made. I've talked to a number of teams that are trying to do implementations of IBC. Like, you know, there's the composable finance team, like Picasso. Then there's polymer labs union. Um, and then there's a, you know, I'm an investor in bearer chain as well. Like, proof of liquidity is really novel.
00:32:57.960 - 00:33:19.410, Speaker A: So, anyways, like, I made. I want to have. Cosmos is an ecosystem where I felt underexposed, and I. And I've kind of placed different bets on that. But, yeah, I've never really owned much of Adam, candidly. But, yeah, there you go.
00:33:19.562 - 00:33:22.002, Speaker B: All right, so this dim airdrop happened. Complete.
00:33:22.058 - 00:33:39.762, Speaker A: It happened. I missed it. Every time I travel, it is very, very expensive for me. It's like, yeah, you have to, like, you had to, like, put your address on the, on this thing, and there was x amount of time in order for you to do that. And I was like, on a long.
00:33:39.778 - 00:33:49.612, Speaker B: Flight, what's your take on airdrops? Like, do you not, what's your take? But do you participate in airdrops? Like, are you going, are you trying to, like, are you trying to get all these airdrops? Basically?
00:33:49.708 - 00:33:50.612, Speaker A: No. No.
00:33:50.748 - 00:33:51.996, Speaker B: So you don't do any of them?
00:33:52.100 - 00:34:09.236, Speaker A: No. I mean, like, I've probably given up a ton of value in air claiming airdrops. But a lot of times I, over time, prioritize security, but other times, like, I never want to go first.
00:34:09.380 - 00:34:09.796, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:34:09.860 - 00:34:41.318, Speaker A: Ever. I just rather have other people test it and whatnot. But that's my personal strategy. I still claim from time to time. I think it's really interesting how the Airdrop game has leveled up most recently. And this is something you and I were talking about. You know, it's, if you're a NFT holder, a particular hallmark collections, tensorians, mad lads, pudgy penguins, like it has been you recouped your cost basis and then some.
00:34:41.366 - 00:35:04.158, Speaker B: Right, the pudgies. So someone at block works has a lot of pudgies and they, their dimension airdrop just from the pudgies was $25,000 and then dim has doubled since then. I think they ended up selling it. But yeah, I mean, that's actually, that's a $1000 airdrop just for holding a bunch of pudgies.
00:35:04.206 - 00:35:23.284, Speaker A: That's crazy. Yeah. 50% of like the median salary in the US. So it's really interesting. The, what I've always questioned is what is the efficiency of an airdrop? It's basically, there's two camps. I think. One is it's like a customer acquisition, right.
00:35:23.284 - 00:36:03.822, Speaker A: Most people just do airdrops as a way to distribute and like decentralize. Fine. The question is like, what is the retention rate of that? And I've questioned, most airdrop programs are extremely expensive. They probably go down as the most inefficient campaigns to acquire users because the retention piece has been questionable. What is really interesting though is latest side check. Yesterday someone posted, I'm verified, but still, that 80% of the tokens that were distributed or 80% of the NFT holders that got a dimension Airdrop actually staked all of their dimension airdrop versus selling, which was pretty compelling, actually, when you.
00:36:03.838 - 00:36:07.238, Speaker B: Think about, we're saying 80% of people who got the dim airdrop didn't sell it.
00:36:07.406 - 00:36:17.154, Speaker A: 80% of the people. But this is exclusively to the NF, the people that qualified for the airdrop that had these NFTs. So, meaning.
00:36:18.854 - 00:36:34.214, Speaker B: I will just say, I think that metric is skewed because the dimension airdrop was the completely botched airdrop. I mean, it's done incredibly well in terms of the performance, but like, and I don't know who's market making this thing, but they're doing a ridiculously good job.
00:36:35.554 - 00:36:39.162, Speaker A: But, but the point still stands. So you can sell it.
00:36:39.218 - 00:36:39.690, Speaker B: You literally.
00:36:39.762 - 00:36:47.994, Speaker A: No, I understand that, but but that if you couldn't sell, but, okay, you stake. I guess that's your point, right? If you can sell, you just stake it. So maybe that's.
00:36:48.074 - 00:36:49.840, Speaker B: Oh, it was 80% staked it.
00:36:49.962 - 00:36:56.904, Speaker A: Yeah. 80% didn't sell, but 80% decided to stake and not sell, so they had gone through the hook.
00:36:57.364 - 00:36:59.772, Speaker B: That's an impressive set. Yeah, that's interesting.
00:36:59.908 - 00:37:21.986, Speaker A: Look, early, right. The drop off of these cohorts can be pretty dramatic. So let's revisit this in a couple of weeks and months. Yeah. The other thing, someone might say, well, listen, I understand your point around retention. You're overthinking it. The key thing here is you build mind share, and that's super important.
00:37:21.986 - 00:37:39.214, Speaker A: And this was something where, like, I feel like a few early Solana projects try to get attention from the ETH community, and it was just a good mechanism to have people bridge over, port over in the same case here with dimension. Right. So we'll see. I think.
00:37:39.514 - 00:38:16.134, Speaker B: What do you think of this airdrop strategy in general, of, like, basically an airdrop used to be to reward users who have used my platform early. So Uniswap says, look, early users, people who are actually creating the volume in the early days and creating these pools and stuff, like, and participating in the pools would get dollars. Now it's turned into, basically. So it went from rewarding early users to a market. It should be, like, on your p and l. That is a marketing line item, I think. And now it's basically saying, look, this is the easiest way to bootstrap users in crypto.
00:38:16.134 - 00:38:40.236, Speaker B: And so people are actually targeting these. Really. I think you brushed over this point, but it's really interesting. These PFP communities, like tensorians, mad lads, pudgies, bad kids, has been in a lot of these because a lot of these are starting to be celestial related or cosmos related. So bad kids are getting them. It is a. They are making tremendous money.
00:38:40.340 - 00:39:05.724, Speaker A: I will caution, though, like, I will caution that there is this strategy now. Like, okay, buy Celestia, because you're gonna have access to, like, ten different airdrops. Hold dimension, because you're gonna have access to, like, look, it's a just caught. I will caution people on this strategy because at some point, the music stops and, yeah, okay, you got to keep dancing while the music's on. But, you know, just similar to NFT mania, there was a. There's a lot of speculation around that. And so.
00:39:07.584 - 00:39:56.762, Speaker B: Here'S what's interesting, though. What is, who's winning right now? The folks who decided to go crypto native with their brand and their marketing, right. There are a lot of folks who said it's a bear market. We're going to try to go get the normies maybe, or get the top of funnel folks. And there's definitely a lot of those people in media and anyone who went the opposite way and went very crypto native, those are the people who are winning, like Dan and Farcaster, the folks who've decided, like, why are people partnering with bad kids, pudgies and tensorians, and not bored apes, azukis, and like, I don't know, like another NFT. It's because they're the most, like, crypto native NFT collection.
00:39:56.818 - 00:39:58.490, Speaker A: Crypto punks are pretty crypto native.
00:39:58.562 - 00:40:11.018, Speaker B: But yeah, punks, like, standalone. In my mind, I like, I don't know, I almost think, like, punks folks aren't as active, though, in like, like, punks people aren't really the people who are gonna go claim a $10,000 airdrop.
00:40:11.186 - 00:40:18.494, Speaker A: Not be as like, super active on chain. I get it. Yeah. What our permies, how's that been for you guys?
00:40:19.554 - 00:41:06.536, Speaker B: Permits been tough, honestly, because what the business model of these, so the business, because the business models of NFTs is incredibly tough if you're not spending a lot of time, like, if you're not spending a lot of time on them. What happened with permies is we gave them access. Permies originally were basically just a lifetime pass to permissionless. Um, what folks came to expect, though, was a lifetime vip pass to permissionless. Vip tickets for permissionless this year are going to be like, I don't know, a couple thousand dollars. So let's say there's 500 permes and each one is $3,000. That's $1.5
00:41:06.536 - 00:41:10.284, Speaker B: million a year that we're losing by having permes, basically.
00:41:10.904 - 00:41:13.904, Speaker A: And then because, again, a very expensive customer acquisition.
00:41:14.064 - 00:41:42.522, Speaker B: Very expensive. And then because there's not 10,000 permes, there's only 555. When those things, they're not, like, when they're selling on Opensea or blur or whatever it is, there's not a boatload of volume because there's 555 instead of 10,000. So we're not making any money from these things. Then. One other thing we did is we gave permis access to blockworks research in the early days, which was helpful. It gave us early user testing and things like that.
00:41:42.522 - 00:42:12.734, Speaker B: You could just connect your wallet and you'd get access to blockworks research. The downside is what ended up happening is a lot of folks who would be. Our customers ended up not subscribing to blockworks research because they would basically just say, oh, yeah, no, no, one of our analysts has a permy. We're good. We got it covered. So now I've got paraphy saying they would be spending, maybe they'd buy three seats and they'd spend five figures. That's like five figures of ARR.
00:42:12.734 - 00:42:29.742, Speaker B: Now they're saying, not paraphy specifically, but I'm giving you an example of a crypto fund. Like, now they're basically saying, look, we have two analysts with the permie. Like, we get this for free. So that's ten k of ARR that we just lost a year. So I'm still very excited about permis. I like permies a lot. Like, I would.
00:42:29.742 - 00:42:43.694, Speaker B: I just, I love the community and, like, I think they're great people and I've come to meet and get to know and become friends with a lot of them through these events. But I don't think we've nailed, I don't think we've solved like, the business model of these things, you know?
00:42:44.034 - 00:43:09.432, Speaker A: So you remember when airlines gave people, like, back in the early days, like the eighties, I think there was like a pretty hack where like you could buy like unlimited flights or something. And some people took advantage of that. Like, they've been traveling for the last 30 years. And it's like the most expensive, like, rewards program, these. I think it happens. It's a hallmark of, like, early and not, like, I would love to figure.
00:43:09.448 - 00:43:15.312, Speaker B: Out how to make permies. Like, I don't know. I would. I still like permits. I have a lot of love for permies.
00:43:15.368 - 00:44:11.680, Speaker A: Look, I think you said earlier the programmability of an NFT is very interesting. I don't. Haven't seen much experiments around this, but I do think when I think about token design, there is so much that is left unexplored and there is a fine line between how market wants to understand that there's a very clear mechanism around a token emission schedule, a token economics make it too complicated, backfires. But I do feel like we can push the line a little bit in the boundary of going a bit further and adding more complexity into these airdrops and gamifying them. And I think the design space is very much unexplored. And that's one of the more fascinating things about crypto is that you can run these social experiments in real time. Like, I don't know the simple, like, here's an airdrop because you have an NFT and like we hope that you're going to add value to this.
00:44:11.680 - 00:44:21.680, Speaker A: It's like, we're going to probably look back on that and say that was like, incredibly crude, unsophisticated and expensive.
00:44:21.832 - 00:44:22.564, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:44:22.944 - 00:44:35.166, Speaker A: Like, I don't know, like, the curve did it this very well. Like the v, like the lockup components and locking your curve. And that was ve.
00:44:35.350 - 00:44:36.238, Speaker B: Bring it back.
00:44:36.366 - 00:44:43.774, Speaker A: Yeah. VCRV. Like, those things have been probably one of the more well thought through token designs.
00:44:43.934 - 00:44:44.486, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:44:44.590 - 00:44:56.714, Speaker A: Out there and airdrops. Like, if I were a founder and I don't know, like, people have, like, Dan, I think, is a good founder. This is Dan from Farcaster.
00:44:57.214 - 00:44:57.502, Speaker B: He.
00:44:57.518 - 00:45:36.804, Speaker A: I think I said, like, I don't think we'll ever have a token. Like, I'd rather like, I like seeing that. Because then you really want to strip away. And charging for a product upfront is like, pretty novel in crypto, where most teams just give out free shit hoping it sticks. And I don't know, you, you never really know your core customer what they appreciate, how much of it's mercenary, opportunistic versus people that really love your product. And I think, unfortunately, like, you blow your, like, 50% of your token supply hoping that you retain some percentage and you get mind share, and I get it. But, like, that's playing a short game.
00:45:36.804 - 00:46:25.112, Speaker A: What's going to happen is all these 80% plus of these protocols that already have codified their tokenomics, already have airdropped everything to the community air gaps. Like, five years from now, it'd be like, in a no different spot than urine was, where they had already farmed and given out all the token supply. What about. And I had to, I had to go through that experiment of increasing the Wi Fi supply because who cares if it's a fixed supply and it's trying to be bitcoin default. Like, no one cares. I'm like, you need tokens to recruit top talent, which was, you need tokens for referrals to bring in more liquidity to the vaults. Like, unfortunately, many projects are going to find themselves in a very tough spot.
00:46:25.112 - 00:46:48.734, Speaker A: And I would be very, I would be inclined not to own any of these projects because their survival rate over a five period year period is increasingly low. But they take the short route. Right. Which is, let's get traction. Let's make sure that we get attention. Yeah, man. The problem is there's gonna be another project that's gonna give up larger.
00:46:48.734 - 00:47:28.198, Speaker A: Like, this game never ends well, right? And so I think I was having this discussion with a top tier founder that I've known over the years. Over in December, when he was asking me, like, what do you think about token distribution? Like, how much you go to the community? He was of the mind that, like, you had to give away at least 30% of the community, probably 45 to 50, which is kind of the standard ish. And I was like, what if you didn't give anything out? Let's just, like, hypothetically, let's think about these cases. Just don't give anything out. You funded this startup. You've taken a lot of risks. Your money.
00:47:28.198 - 00:48:04.464, Speaker A: Like, why can't you own 60% of this project? Why does the team have to own 10% of it? Like, most teams don't? Most founders don't end up owning enough of their projects. Okay? And I get it. You want to own a, a bigger piece, a smaller piece of a bigger pie. But I'm like, I don't know. I think that is just, uh, doesn't really fully appreciate that the community today is not the community of tomorrow. And it's just, it just, it just obfuscates it. The very, um, short sided, short sided way of thinking about your growth and your potential, I would not give out.
00:48:04.464 - 00:48:27.386, Speaker A: And if people want to complain and bitch about the fact that they're not getting 50% of the token supply, I'm like, well, fuck off. Like, what have you done? Oh, you want a pudgy penguin? Oh, cool. Okay, why is it that you need to get $30,000? Forget about the value. It's like, why people, I think, are entitled in this space just, it just bothers me the wrong way. I get it. It's like. But, well, I think we should seriously reconsider.
00:48:27.386 - 00:48:50.610, Speaker A: I. My theory is a lot of this airdrops has been a result of dancing around lack of regulation and saying, okay, we need to, like, decentralize as quickly as possible. Yada, yada, yada, make people. But, yeah, I don't know. I think it's one of those things where hopefully, I think we've peaked in the airdrop. It will keep going.
00:48:50.722 - 00:48:51.258, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:48:51.306 - 00:48:55.646, Speaker A: It will peak in the percentage of the total token supply that goes out to the community.
00:48:55.750 - 00:48:56.342, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:48:56.438 - 00:48:57.574, Speaker A: Not vigorous, peaked.
00:48:57.654 - 00:49:13.158, Speaker B: Yeah, I think there are three. Okay, so I think there are three reasons why people do our jobs. Marketing, like user acquisition, regulatory, decentralization, theatrics and need number to go up, because that's how we fund things.
00:49:13.286 - 00:49:13.726, Speaker A: Because that's.
00:49:13.750 - 00:49:19.754, Speaker B: No, because, like, you know, you get more money and stuff. Do you think any of those are a good reason to do it.
00:49:24.034 - 00:49:29.106, Speaker A: No, I mean. Okay, like regulate. No.
00:49:29.250 - 00:49:29.974, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:49:30.594 - 00:49:57.580, Speaker A: It's a tough spot. You have to do something. But I guess I'm not totally dismissive on the airdrop strategy. I think. I think it's just the mechanism by which you design an airdrop is most of the time really inefficient, incredibly expensive. So I will design a program where people need to do more stuff to earn these airdrops. Earn them.
00:49:57.580 - 00:50:19.084, Speaker A: Like, the uniswap is not a bad one. Like, okay, you provided a lot of this liquidity and trading, like Jupiter. Not bad. Candidly, they're going to do more campaigns, so you're incentivized you missed out on the first one because you didn't trade before November. Okay, well, now, you know, I think those type of programs, I don't want to be dismissive of them. I think they work. They are good marketing campaigns.
00:50:19.084 - 00:50:20.456, Speaker A: Pretty good ones.
00:50:20.520 - 00:50:21.080, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:50:21.232 - 00:50:26.640, Speaker A: So. Yeah, but I just think the percentage that goes out may be a little too high.
00:50:26.792 - 00:50:36.284, Speaker B: Okay, last, last topic here is someone filed, I forget who it was for staking inside of the ETH ETF. Did you see this?
00:50:36.944 - 00:50:39.044, Speaker A: I've heard talks about it, but, yeah, go ahead.
00:50:39.384 - 00:50:52.744, Speaker B: Does this make you want to. What is the second order impact of that? Do you think about going out and buying Lido because of this? Or how do you think about just like how. Yeah, what's your thought on that?
00:50:53.124 - 00:51:32.884, Speaker A: Basically the mechanism is, for instance, not with bitcoin, but for future ETF's of proof of stake tokens. Right. So like, say, hypothetically and most realistically, you're going to have a bitcoin. Sorry, ETH ETF. The idea is you can stake what, though, the allowing someone, like whatever the ETF issuer is to stake those tokens. Because at the moment, my understanding is that they won't necessarily stake or none of them will. Right.
00:51:33.654 - 00:51:42.354, Speaker B: My understanding is that most likely none of them will, but they all want to think about it. Because what this gives you is basically the ability to own an ETF and have a dividend.
00:51:42.694 - 00:51:46.982, Speaker A: Well, yeah, not so much like just be diluted. Right. Because if you're not staking, you're being diluted.
00:51:47.038 - 00:51:47.674, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:51:48.934 - 00:52:11.240, Speaker A: Like if everyone's staking, everyone is basically the same. Right. It's just. But if it really is, the inflation in the proof of stake network happens to be where it, uh, it dilutes out people that are not staking. Um, I. Well, there's two trains of thought here. One is, uh, if you're a more crypto native person, then you really like that.
00:52:11.240 - 00:52:57.244, Speaker A: Right. Because you, I guess, benefit from. You have a very big, increasingly, like, market participant that is buying part of the supply and is not staking it. And like, at the moment, 25% of all the ETH is being staked across Eigen layer light os of the world. So, yeah, as there's less tokens out there circulating, then it puts, like, it takes less amount of buy pressure to basically number go up. I think it would be nice to have ETF's they're able to stake. The question then becomes, as we've had with Lido, is, you know, how do you manage the liquidity of the ETF?
00:52:57.364 - 00:52:58.064, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:52:59.124 - 00:53:14.628, Speaker A: And I think it's something that probably is not going to happen, but probably Coinbase can facilitate this for. Because they're already, like, acting as a custodian, right. Of a lot of these ETF providers.
00:53:14.676 - 00:53:15.624, Speaker B: For most of them.
00:53:15.924 - 00:53:33.662, Speaker A: And Coinbase has the infrastructure, like they acquired bison trails and you can. You can stake through Coinbase. So, yeah, I would just. It probably can be figured out. I think it's gonna happen, but I would probably be. Yeah, I don't have anything against it. I think it's just not gonna happen in any.
00:53:33.718 - 00:54:07.254, Speaker B: Yeah, if it does happen, big win. I mean, it's probably like. So I. Have you been seeing Eigen Lair just sucking up staked ethnic layers at 5 billion, 5 billion, 5 billion tv. All right, now Lido sitting at like 32% of all steak teeth. Yeah, I mean, if this happens, you could see Lido bring in, like, I think, like, I think a billion dollars in fees or 500, like, some ridiculous amount of fees this year, which is just tremendous. I actually had dinner last night with this private equity guy, and he was.
00:54:07.254 - 00:54:32.106, Speaker B: He caught the crypto bug and he basically was talking about the efficiency of these businesses and that nobody's waking up to the. He's like, people like SaaS businesses, he's like, because of how efficient they are. Like, wait until you. Till these, like, traditional investors who invest in SaaS, like, wake up to the fact that Uniswap is the most capital efficient business in the world right now. Maker to almost capital efficient business, literally.
00:54:32.250 - 00:55:07.414, Speaker A: I tweeted about this over the years because I was, before going full time crypto, I was at a fund that we were exclusively investing in enterprise software. And you look at all this stuff and capital efficiency and magic number and all this stuff, like, yeah, recurring revenue is a beautiful thing. I'm like, well, the most. The most hot comparison to make is Coinbase and Uniswap. Like, yeah, there was a time where Uniswap started, volume started to like match or even surpass what Coinbase was doing in any given day. And you're like, well, one has less than twelve employees or 20 employees. The other one has thousands.
00:55:07.414 - 00:55:56.132, Speaker A: The cost to run one versus the other night and day. And you're right, I think that's incredibly powerful. And I think a lot of people get sort of like distracted by the fact that they're not distributing the fees to uni holders. But I mean, that admin contract is accruing a whole lot of fees. Yeah, it's right. Two probably big awakenings that the capital efficiency, the kind of like tech asymmetric upside with dividend features, it's probably going to blow people's minds, like a rate, but with like way more asymmetry than real estate, also more volatility. And then the other thing is marketers, right, your point around forecaster could become a huge, huge mechanism to acquire customers.
00:55:56.132 - 00:56:11.744, Speaker A: Like just get attention, get venture. Not to mention I was, I was actually like really surprised. I want to probably end it with this. So I saw someone and I retweeted her about this. It's crazy stuff. Listen to this. Okay.
00:56:11.744 - 00:56:36.864, Speaker A: Apparently only one to 3% of Reddit users actually post. Most of Wikipedia's content is written by zero, zero, three of all users. Like, that's just wild. And of course, like this is interesting because Reddit's thinking about doing an ipo at the 5 billion. Like, I'm not surprised. Like, we all know these power users like games. Like, the 1% of gamers I saw.
00:56:36.904 - 00:56:44.484, Speaker B: Twitter said, Twitter is one. I think 1% of users post, 9% engage, like comment and like, and 90% never do anything.
00:56:45.264 - 00:57:36.704, Speaker A: So that like, anyways, got my brain working for once and it was like, okay, then, like, crypto users are incredibly active, the current cohort. And that's incredibly valuable. Like if you're, I think that's what like LVMH is thinking, right? Like, yeah, there's like probably a hundred thousand really active crazy people. But if you're an NFT holder, you probably like, your LTV is way higher. You're like the core demographic, the most valuable cohort for any company out there, literally any company, because these dj's are also spending in the real world. And so, yeah, it really goes to show, like, people talk about like true, a thousand true fans or whatever. But like, in this case, yeah, it sort of like made me rethink what mainstream really looks like.
00:57:36.704 - 00:57:57.944, Speaker A: Right. Because it's the simple mechanisms like, oh, we need billions of users. Do we really? I don't know. I think you can. Anyways, I'm in the process of rethinking what is mainstream adoption really look like for crypto and. Yeah, it's really. Yeah.
00:57:57.944 - 00:58:04.524, Speaker A: I don't know. Like this, of course, is relentless. Talk about it in another bot. But like the saga phone now soiling over 85,000.
00:58:05.464 - 00:58:07.432, Speaker B: 85,000. Is that the number threat?
00:58:07.608 - 00:58:14.372, Speaker A: Yeah, the. For the second phone, yeah. So is it going to displace the App Store seems crazy, but at blockworks.
00:58:14.388 - 00:58:18.476, Speaker B: Who'S literally switch not just using the Solana phone for like to get airdrops.
00:58:18.500 - 00:58:20.668, Speaker A: And stuff, but using it as like.
00:58:20.756 - 00:58:26.204, Speaker B: His phone because he just graduated college and he's, um, like, I mean, helios.
00:58:26.244 - 00:58:54.208, Speaker A: Right. Uh. Like this is the last thing I want to say. Like, of course, Coinbase put a report yesterday saying, like, Americans would have saved, what is it, 300 million or so if 200 something million if they had, you know, for. Coinbase released its state of crypto for Q four and they highlighted some interesting data. Page two of the PDF quantifies the advantages of crypto versus traditional financial rails in the term of cost, speed and convenience. According to the report, Americans could have saved, sorry, 70, that was way off.
00:58:54.208 - 00:59:30.134, Speaker A: 74 billion in credit card transaction fees in 2002 alone by using blockchain, equaling to about 600 in savings per household. Now, who knows, right? Because if all Americans started using defi, good luck. Maybe with salon. Nonetheless. Yeah, it got me thinking. When are they going to post the report on telco? Most Americans are paying between 20, at least 20, 5100, $200 on their mobile plans. Well, newsflash, folks.
00:59:30.134 - 00:59:38.154, Speaker A: But helios is. Pays for itself, at least for now. Helium. Sorry, helium. Mert's gonna kill me.
00:59:39.054 - 00:59:42.594, Speaker B: Yeah, most frustrating thing to Mert in this world.
00:59:44.494 - 01:00:32.514, Speaker A: At least I led with healing, like his company. But yeah, no, helium, right? Not helix helium, which is the deep and decentralized infrastructure, like mobile, like, so anyways, it's radically cheaper. So it's going to get really interesting. It's going to be really interesting. Do you think this is the question for you? Sorry, this is the last thing. Do you think this is the year where we start to see these big awakenings from traditional companies, like, where people start really realizing, assuming we enter this application phase, forecaster really takes off and some applications really take off because we have the ability to do so better infrastructure. Is this going to be the year where you start seeing it in some of the larger gaming conferences, marketing conferences, banking conferences, it's like, oh, wow.
01:00:32.514 - 01:00:39.562, Speaker A: Like there's a real opportunity here. For real this time. We'll see.
01:00:39.698 - 01:00:40.534, Speaker B: We'll see.
01:00:42.314 - 01:00:58.378, Speaker A: Most hedged answer on the pod. Okay? We'll see. And you need to come to das this to see. What's the layout for you, man? Come on. Oh, God. I don't get enough credit.
01:00:58.426 - 01:01:03.754, Speaker B: I got distracted. Candidly, I got a message about some weird thing. I got distracted. I'll admit it. I'll admit it.
01:01:03.914 - 01:01:06.574, Speaker A: All right, well, that's the goodest time has ever. That's our queue to it.
01:01:08.554 - 01:01:11.414, Speaker B: I'll see you on 20 minutes. In 20 minutes, we doing this call?
01:01:11.794 - 01:01:21.984, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, I guess. Yeah. All right, folks, well, thanks very much for listening. Uh, we'll be here next week as regular schedule, so I appreciate the patience.
01:01:22.064 - 01:01:23.560, Speaker B: Next roundup will be in March.
