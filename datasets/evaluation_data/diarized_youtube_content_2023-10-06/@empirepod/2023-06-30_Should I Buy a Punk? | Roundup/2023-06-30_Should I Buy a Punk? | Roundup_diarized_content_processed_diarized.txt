00:00:02.920 - 00:00:26.234, Speaker A: Alright, folks, welcome back to another episode of Empire. We got the roundup today for anyone watching on YouTube. I'm sorry that I don't have the nice background. As usual, I have been relegated to the side room, the side podcasting room, because Mister Jack Farley from forward guidance is recording in the main room. And the rule of blockworks is whoever has the most downloads gets the main room. And unfortunately, Santi, we got some work to do, my friend.
00:00:26.694 - 00:00:29.758, Speaker B: That's okay. You know, we like being the underdogs anyways.
00:00:29.846 - 00:00:32.734, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. Exactly. So how you doing, man?
00:00:32.894 - 00:01:13.624, Speaker B: Doing great. Really energized after that discussion with 6259 659. Fantastic episode. We just let him talk because, I mean, he has just so much insight. But one of the things is, if I were to like, summarize, because it's our longest episode, but I was summarized or attempt to summarize, the key highlight, as he kept saying over and over, is as a crypto industry, we have got to get better at the narrative of explaining the reason, of explaining why all of this matters to people. This goes far beyond bitcoin, ethereum. This goes to the heart of owning property, and now it's digital property.
00:01:13.624 - 00:01:51.458, Speaker B: And that I think everyone can relate to. And I think it will become more and more obvious over time that, you know, government or anyone should really not interfere with your ability to own and self custody property in the same way that you buy a car, you buy a house. Like, property rights are fundamental for any developed economy. And if you don't have property rights, go look at Hernando de Soto's economist. He talks about, like, why certain countries develop the way they have is because they have sound property rights, and that allows for the formation of credit and a number of things. And I think that's really the heart of the matter here, is forget about crypto. Put that aside for a minute.
00:01:51.458 - 00:02:10.594, Speaker B: Just think about your ability to own digital stuff and custody. And I think that's really important, and that's a narrative that we should continue to drive home. And I think it'd be right for a bunch of people that are doing great policy work to just really hammer that home. So that was really my takeaway. I mean, there's a number of things, but.
00:02:10.714 - 00:03:03.322, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I mean, one, one thing that stood out to me is like just his basically definition envision for the metaverse. Because I, even when I say the word metaverse, it almost feels very cringey. Right. But I think his vision of this is we have this Internet today, it's actually very text based. Still. But if you look at the Internet in 5710 years, the metaverse is basically just the Internet with better visualizations and these persistent visual objects and coming on the back of the apple, what they call it the Apple Pro or the apple spatial computing product, you can really clearly see a future where the metaverse is this mix of AR and VR and real size and real life. As the Internet becomes more visual, then you can very clearly see a link between these persistent visual objects and the value that those persistent digital objects have in that space.
00:03:03.322 - 00:03:26.040, Speaker A: So to me, I think this world, it was kind of funny laughing after that episode, talking about things like azukis or punks or apes or any of these nfTs, they're just these kind of still objects in this really text based Internet that we have today. But in the future, you can really imagine an Internet that is much more visual. Yeah, you can imagine, I mean, like.
00:03:26.112 - 00:04:29.074, Speaker B: A lot more value from an investing standpoint. You have to fundamentally understand, like, what fundamental, like, core human desire are you triggering in the particular investment that you're making? And anyone that is dismissive of NFTs misses the point, because humans, what do humans love to do throughout the history of time? Humans love to differentiate. That's it. And that extends to luxury brands and anything that allows you to differentiate, to express your individuality, whether it's art or collecting or, you know, buying luxury goods or veblem, whatever it is. But humans love to do that. And if you don't think that NFTs will be big, then somehow you're predicating that thesis on the fact that humans will not want to differentiate in the digital context, combined with the fact that every trend that you look at suggests that humans are spending more and more time in the digital world. And as you layer on AR or mixed reality, it even becomes more important.
00:04:29.074 - 00:05:04.792, Speaker B: And your ability to, as he said, you know, very few people can go to even the best museum, totally look at art now. They may now be able to do that in a kind of a, you know, in the metaverse, if you will. You put on these goggles and you're in the MoMA or the Met or Louvre or whatever, but creating your digital Persona is uniquely enabled by, like, digital property, the scarcity of that and that, that's really all NFTs really are, right? You open your closet today, you have a bunch of stuff. You know, you're wearing a horrible yellow shirt. Jason, I don't know what this is. It's.
00:05:04.848 - 00:05:14.032, Speaker A: I was waiting for you to comment. All right, sure. Please stop it's about to be July 4 weekend in New York on Santi. What are we doing wearing a little black golf?
00:05:14.088 - 00:05:42.518, Speaker B: I always, I always wear blue, black, blue. Anyways, not here. Moving along. I just generally think that, like, when you open your digital closet, like, what do you have? And nfTs, are that right? They don't have to be, you know, 100,000, you know, pfps. No. In fact, I'm more bullish on the category of having like, earned nfTs. The NFTs that represent, you know, culture.
00:05:42.518 - 00:06:15.858, Speaker B: Meaning you go to a concert, you know, you go to Fred again concert, which I know you love, and you get an NFT like that. That's important to you, right? Cause you wanna. It's a, it's a representation of time and space and attest to the, of what you've been doing. And so I think that's really cool. And so that's really why it's important to listen to that episode, because those are the highlights. And I think he's a fantastic, probably the best spokesperson to crystallize and talk about this in a way that I think is more relatable to people, normal people. And so I'd really encourage folks to go and listen to that.
00:06:15.986 - 00:06:41.454, Speaker A: Yeah, agreed. Let's get into something that we briefly talked about on the episode, which was, which was actually just punks. So I'm seeing more and more in kind of these just in group chats that I'm in. You know, you're a punk holder. He's a punk holder. In a lot of group chats, people are asking the question like look in the bull market, fall of 2021, I really wanted to punk punks at what like 110 ETH. I think it was some very high number.
00:06:41.454 - 00:07:08.034, Speaker A: Now they're sitting at like 45 or 58th floor. Got to imagine this is like near the bottom of the market. Is now the right, I really want to punk is now the right time to buy punk. So I'd be curious to hear how you think about like for people who dont have a punk. Lets start there. For people who dont have a punk, who are thinking about buying a punk and do have obviously maybe the net worth and the liquidity to do it. How do you think about whether or not now is the right time to get their first punk?
00:07:09.094 - 00:08:12.574, Speaker B: Its a very difficult question to answer because certainly we can talk about why punks are relevant because theyre arguably the first real project, at least in the Ethereum blockchain. And that has a lot of meaning. Theyre also really simple I personally, aesthetically, I find them quite pleasing, sort of pixelated, really, kind of speaking to an era of the Internet, which is raw but cool, I guess. And historically, they just been one of those collector items that people that have been in the space gravitate to. But the question of should you get a punk? Is very specific to a lot of things. And the question is hard to answer because are you collecting? Are you investing? My kind of framework for nfts and collecting these things is purely collecting. Like, I don't pretend to sell and I don't think of them as investments.
00:08:12.574 - 00:09:09.244, Speaker B: Of course, I did a survey on Twitter, which was, why do you collect? And the options were because you just like it, because you think others like it or because you think it's going to make a great investment or other category. And a lot of people said, well, like, the fact that other people like it makes it a good investment, which I sort of don't agree with necessarily because things change fairly quickly. But I personally just collect stuff that I really like. My thesis for hoodie punks was quite simply, at the time, I thought that it was a very unappreciated attribute of a punk because hoodies really represent kind of hacker culture. And that's why I started collecting hoodies, because I just sort of thought this kind of has beard, it has neurodlasses, it resembles me. And so I want that to be my public PFP. But hoodies, the category, I thought was something that I really liked.
00:09:09.244 - 00:09:40.828, Speaker B: And so I think it's shoot, look, arguably some person looking from the outside and say, these guys are crazy. I mean, they're like talking about these pixelated art pieces that are being, you know, being offered for what's the floor on this 45 ETH. That's $85,000. Like guys, like, get your head out of the gutter. Like, like there's a. There's a part of that I'm always aware of that, you know, these things are not cheap. And like, we.
00:09:40.828 - 00:10:05.584, Speaker B: It's hard to. I'm trying to get at. It's hard to understand, like, the value of these things. And I think in that episode with, we talked about the ringer, right, which he bought for six and a quarter million bucks. It's either going to be a great buy or maybe not. Art is very subjective, so it's really hard to think about these things from a value perspective. And.
00:10:05.584 - 00:10:48.112, Speaker B: But, you know, my, I've helped a number of people buy punks over the years. And, you know, I think if you're serious about collecting. I've always felt that this is like probably like an icon. Like this is, you know, a grail in your collection. Maybe this is somehow like in the traditional art world. If you're a serious art collector, you have like a warhol or a Picasso or a Van Gogh. I'm afraid to say this because someone's just going to tear apart what I just said, you know, I mean, and we talked about like, who was bidding for the ringer, right, sorry, the goose, I mean.
00:10:48.208 - 00:10:48.960, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:10:49.152 - 00:11:31.726, Speaker B: And he seemed to think that there were like traditional art collectors bidding for this. And the second highest bidder that pushed it up was like, apparently someone who comes from traditional art world. And so, yeah, I don't know, like, you have to be really patient for these things. I feel really comfortable buying stuff that, collecting stuff that I know I'm never going to sell. I collect a number, I'll collect so much shit. But punks have been probably, when I think of the NFTs that I have, I've gotten a number of, like, I've just gotten things from projects or from folks. But when I think about buying, I've only really seriously, like, when meaningful dollars at stake, it's just punks for me and I'm.
00:11:31.726 - 00:11:32.518, Speaker B: But I'm biased.
00:11:32.606 - 00:11:33.914, Speaker A: Yeah. How are you?
00:11:35.334 - 00:11:36.994, Speaker B: I want, I'm not going to answer that.
00:11:40.334 - 00:11:41.190, Speaker A: Would you look to.
00:11:41.262 - 00:11:47.432, Speaker B: Let me, let me, let's put it this way. I have earmarked and bookmarked ten punks that I would want to buy more.
00:11:47.568 - 00:11:49.564, Speaker A: All right? So that's really what I.
00:11:51.264 - 00:11:52.624, Speaker B: It is an interesting time.
00:11:52.744 - 00:11:53.376, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:11:53.520 - 00:12:36.072, Speaker B: Anytime there are liquidity crunches. Some people just got in hot water, right, because they bought with leverage or they bought speculating, thinking that they were going to flip. And you, and you see it, what's nice about the crypto and the larva lapse interface and they're kind of, you go on, you know, larva labs and crypto punks, and you click on a particular crypto punk and you can see the entire history, right, of who's bought it transfers. But also it's very interesting when you look at certain punks where they're bought and then they're very quickly relisted. Now, a lot of punks are not relisted. None of my punks are. For instance, people can place bids on them.
00:12:36.072 - 00:13:28.166, Speaker B: That's fine. A lot of other punks, you see this trend where maybe they bought at the peak a year ago and then they quickly relisted and then they lowered that, like offered for maybe 400 ETH and then they go down to 350 and then they go to 323 hundred. And you also look at, like at the time where ETH was trading out. So you look at the dollar basis in my mind when I'm thinking of going shopping. I look at these type of punks and I find it quite interesting. Sometimes I want to understand kind of this behavior of, hey, maybe this guy, maybe this person bought it for $300,000 and at the time it was corresponded to x amount of ETH. If I offer the same amount of ETH, or if I offer the same amount, dollar amount, he's at least going to break even, you know.
00:13:28.166 - 00:13:44.498, Speaker B: And so these are some of the things that I think about strategically. And the other thing that I've tweeted about, but I didn't get a really good answer, was like, there's this punk's OTC that they've like, been involved in a number of trades. I don't really fully understand, like, what they do or how they do it or what this value of it is.
00:13:44.546 - 00:13:47.450, Speaker A: We're satisfied. You don't use punks OTC, you just buy it street.
00:13:47.522 - 00:13:55.250, Speaker B: Yeah. Like, for instance, I pick, I just wanted, I pinged them about a particular punk that I liked. He's like, oh, we know the, we know the owner.
00:13:55.322 - 00:14:04.542, Speaker A: And he is this a pug that is currently listed or currently listed. But if it's currently listed, why wouldn't you just buy it on the market? Yeah, yeah, no, I could, I was.
00:14:04.558 - 00:14:15.342, Speaker B: Just curious because he's, it's one of these punks where it's had like a history of like, offered and certain bids close to what he's been, like, what it's offered at. But, you know, you could snipe it.
00:14:15.358 - 00:14:15.510, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:14:15.542 - 00:14:30.968, Speaker B: Then and there. So I personally would not do it. Go again. Because I was docs and like, apparently like few other people ping me. Like I was in certain chats, oh, this guy wants to buy your punk. And like, I don't know when I'm buying stuff, I probably use a fresh wallet stuff.
00:14:31.016 - 00:14:51.964, Speaker A: Yep. And how do you think about, so, I think it was so when I was first, I think it was buying crypto dick butts. Meltom told me, you either buy a grail or a floor, you never go in between. And I think applied to any question. Right. And I'm curious if you.
00:14:53.694 - 00:15:03.598, Speaker B: Yeah, it's an interesting, I've had actually, this discussion a lot in the early days of blur with Pac man. Of how. Because you're right. Like, I think of.
00:15:03.766 - 00:15:06.174, Speaker A: Because you, you like your. Yeah.
00:15:06.214 - 00:15:06.710, Speaker B: Of grails.
00:15:06.742 - 00:15:06.862, Speaker A: I.
00:15:06.878 - 00:15:21.618, Speaker B: Right. I think I have. I think I have grails. I may have a couple of floors, but it's the stuff that I have, I consider to be fairly unique. It's not an alien punk. Maybe, maybe not, but it's, uh. Or like a zombie.
00:15:21.618 - 00:15:32.450, Speaker B: But I, you know, I guess what I'm trying to. It's sort of this, like, what is it? The endowment effect or like the. This idea that once you buy something, you're so attached to it. Do you think it's a grail?
00:15:32.602 - 00:15:33.074, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:33.154 - 00:15:51.580, Speaker B: Um, but look, like, I guess it. I'm trying to get out, like, trying to understand what meltom was thinking when she said that. Because if you're buying floors, if you're sweeping a floor, doesn't that mean that it's more of like a trader mindset? Because in blur, a lot of the activity is tied to floors.
00:15:51.612 - 00:15:51.804, Speaker A: Right.
00:15:51.844 - 00:16:20.894, Speaker B: People sweeping floors and they're making a bet that, like, the floor for a particular collection is going to go up. Like milady's and stuff like that. Like, I feel like it's a more speculative buy, wanting to flip at some point. And it's more of the investor type that says, hey, on a relative basis, punks have really come down a lot. At their peak, they're like three times more. It's kind of like a levered ETH bet. You know, it's hold its value fairly well.
00:16:20.894 - 00:16:35.086, Speaker B: You know, there's a lot of buyers out there that will hold a floor. And unlike, you know, unlike bored apes, this is more of a, you know, connoisseur like collection, if you will. Yeah.
00:16:35.270 - 00:16:40.092, Speaker A: It's not about punks. Right. It's about like, I think this is about all NFT purchases in general.
00:16:40.148 - 00:16:50.664, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah. I think the floor. The floor sweeper is an investor speculator. The Grail one, I'm not so sure. I think it's more specific.
00:16:52.564 - 00:16:58.700, Speaker A: Yeah. Because you could buy a punk right now for, I think the cheapest one is this one with the green hat thing for 85K.
00:16:58.812 - 00:17:00.980, Speaker B: Yeah, 45 e. Yeah, yeah.
00:17:01.012 - 00:17:13.857, Speaker A: But maybe you see, but maybe you see something else where it's like this blue bandana with sunglasses for 55 beat. So it's like, how do you think about spending that extra ten ETH to get something that you really love, right? I guess that's all for it.
00:17:13.985 - 00:17:33.644, Speaker B: You know, at the end of the day, you don't want your wallet litter with shit you don't like. Buy stuff that you like. It's going to be easier. You know, it's like sometimes you. I just found it. That's my approach to collecting. I never want to buy stuff because someone tells me it's worth a lot.
00:17:33.644 - 00:18:07.088, Speaker B: Now, again, it's. It's a, it's a difficult decision because if that incremental ten k is going to make you uncomfortable, then, then reconsider, right? But if you can do it, go for it. In nine out of ten times where I've, like, helped people, like, find the right punk for them. And, like, I'm not, like, punk advisor or not, but I don't know, like, people that are close, which one should I buy? I'm like, what's. Which one speaks to you? And they send me five or six. I'm like, oh, you know, like, I feel like, you know, this or that. And the ones that I bought have been, like, thoughtful buys, which is, like, this punk represent x.
00:18:07.088 - 00:18:25.536, Speaker B: Or I want this punk to be here if I were to display it. Or this punk in many ways, like, people buy watches and jewelry to commemorate certain moments. You know, maybe that's, like, a good way to approach it. So. Yeah, I don't know. It's a. It's very subjective, man, because anyone out there could be listening to this.
00:18:25.536 - 00:18:48.382, Speaker B: These guys, like, are way out of their, like, these crypto people have no sense of what art is. And, you know, for them, it, like, I'm. Who am I to, you know, there are worlds so subjective. Like, there's so many artists. Look. Like, I've walked it. I've always walked into certain museums, like, in Paris, I remember Pompidou museum.
00:18:48.382 - 00:19:21.162, Speaker B: And, like, in the top floor, next to the cafe, there's a canvas. It's just blue. Like, like the back of my. My. Here I'm looking at that. I'm like, this just probably you're wondering, like, why is it here? And it's probably worth, like, 40 million or something, you know? And, like, I don't know. Apparently the guy invented that color blue, so, you know, but I didn't know that, you know, and so unless people told me that, I wouldn't have appreciated.
00:19:21.162 - 00:19:26.958, Speaker B: I'm like, this is, this is ludicrous. Like what? Like, there's so many other things that, like, street art is better, but I.
00:19:26.966 - 00:19:58.652, Speaker A: Think, isn't that part of the, like, let's say you're buying art for, like, the flex basically there, it's really all about who you're trying to. You're almost your target audience on the flex. Or it's like the. So in that case, for example, there's a. You might not know that this guy invite and created this color of blue. But for if you, if you own your punk, your basically target audience which are like your friends who are in crypto or whatever, recognize that that is a cool punk. So whereas someone on the street might just be like, I don't.
00:19:58.708 - 00:20:24.452, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. I will say though, the punks that I've shared this with, people that like, are not into crypto, a lot of like, oh, that's, that's kind of cool looking. Like, I like it. Whereas bored apes like you don't get the similar response. Does it matter? On the margin, for sure. The other thing is you got to be mindful like my hoodie punk, I'm never going to let go. Like, I'm going to sell that.
00:20:24.452 - 00:20:56.008, Speaker B: It's. But one of the things that people are critical of in all of this is the flex component. Just like, oh, you know, you're just buying this because you tell people you can literally splurge 45 ETH, you know, a car on a, you know, right click save image. Like, what does that, like, you're just so vain and like, what type of person you are. And, you know what? Teach his own. I've just learned don't judge. Like, people so quick to judge.
00:20:56.008 - 00:21:24.194, Speaker B: Like, you have no idea. Yeah, and so, but you're, it is a cons, I guess whether it's a concern or not is more of a personal basis. But, you know, just be mindful. People gonna know exactly what you bought it for. And so, you know, as it relates to buying, a lot of times, you know, buy with a clean wallet, you know, so people don't know who it is or, or it's, you know, tied to other stuff that you're doing. And, you know, sometimes it's just kind of good to collect and just keep your head down.
00:21:24.574 - 00:21:58.770, Speaker C: Hey, everyone, quick break from Empire to tell you about another blockworks channel that I know you're going to love. I've been in crypto full time for five years and have always struggled with one thing, which is keeping up with the next big trend. As soon as I wrap my head around Mev, we're on to app chains. As soon as I wrap my head around app chains, we're onto liquid staking derivatives. I'm sure you've been there. Blockworks research has solved that problem for me. Our team puts research, data governance proposal updates, models and more into one really easy to use platform.
00:21:58.770 - 00:22:19.454, Speaker C: So I can always stay ahead of the curve if I don't understand something. For example, I just bought the platform I can search for an L1. I can search for a protocol built the platform@blockworksresearch.com. Comma, I search the term. There's always an amazing amount of insight in a really consumable way. Right now you can subscribe to the platform. It's $2,500 a year or $900 a quarter.
00:22:19.454 - 00:22:47.988, Speaker C: Hopefully you can make more than $208 a month by using the platform. If you can't, you're probably in the wrong business. But if you're not ready to subscribe to the platform today, you can subscribe to the research team's free newsletter. You can follow their Twitter handles today, links in the show notes.

00:22:56.434 - 00:23:04.026, Speaker A: Let's talk about an NFC that did not go so well. So this week, Azuki's launched new Azu.
00:23:04.090 - 00:23:08.674, Speaker B: Revolutionary, really differentiated collection.
00:23:08.834 - 00:23:51.850, Speaker A: So for those who weren't following Azuki's, I would call one, I would call them one of the tier one NFT projects from the, from the height of the, like, NFT boom. So it's like I'd put like a zookees, punks, bored apes movies, cool cats. Like, these were the, like, hottest projects and a lot of them were actually able to raise some money. So, like, Yuga raised with bored apes raised doodles, had a big raise. Mizuki actually tried to do a fundraise around the same time that bored apes raised, but they weren't able to get the fundraise done. As my understanding of it, they launched this new project. Um, everyone's really excited about it.
00:23:51.850 - 00:24:13.002, Speaker A: Basically, if you haven't seen it, it's a brand new project that looks pretty much identical to the original Azuki's. You can, I was flipping between them on, on, on blur. You can barely tell the difference. Uh, it, and it, what it does, it tripled the number of Azuki's. Um, and right away, the price of Azuki's fell 40%. So I think, uh oh, that's what.
00:24:13.018 - 00:24:14.894, Speaker B: You call a dilution event.
00:24:15.034 - 00:24:29.798, Speaker A: You call it dilution event. But they were so they got a lot of shit. But, um, I was trying to play Devil's advocate, I guess. Let me try to play Devil's advocate to this, which is, if you're a company, you need. And you need money. Really, what they did is they diluted. I think they.
00:24:29.798 - 00:24:52.926, Speaker A: I don't know. They sold probably, like, I'm making this number up, like, roughly 60% of the shares to get $40 million. And if you were a company that was really, really struggling and still maybe hadn't found product market fit, they clearly haven't nailed their business model. Um, all they. I mean, they. They minted out 40 million. So the devil's advocate was, like, you could either go down or you could raise this money and keep going.
00:24:52.990 - 00:25:17.714, Speaker B: I understand that, but I think a lot of people are expecting this to be a little bit more differentiated. That's. That's. That's the thing that I'm concerned about, because, look, it's more of a narrative and what you're telling people. Like, I think my understanding was a lot of people were expecting this to be a fairly kind of unique collection. Like. Like, okay, like, me bits, for instance.
00:25:17.714 - 00:25:38.534, Speaker B: Like, not titapunics, but, you know, me bits. Or, like, the bored apes had the mutant apes. Like, they're fairly different. Like, you could tell them apart. And the colonel wasn't like, these things are very different. Right? This was not different. And so I just think, like, it just felt like a cash grab.
00:25:38.534 - 00:25:44.694, Speaker B: Like, fine. Like, if you want to raise money, just do it. Right? But on what promise and what basis?
00:25:44.814 - 00:25:50.662, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it really brings into question the business model of nfts, right?
00:25:50.718 - 00:25:51.606, Speaker B: There is none.
00:25:51.710 - 00:26:14.194, Speaker A: You can go art with royalties you can sell. Well, it's just interesting to see what's happening, right? Pudgies are selling merch on Amazon. Apes are trying to build this game. Doodles are, like. Are trying to build this new age media company. Um, I am in your boat. That I think the best model for this is not having any sort of roadmap.
00:26:14.194 - 00:26:23.234, Speaker A: I mean, look at the folks who had a roadmap. Moonbirds that fell to shit, cool. Cats that went to shit, zookeez. I mean, jury's out here, but it doesn't seem like it's going too well.
00:26:23.274 - 00:26:42.348, Speaker B: So, look, I'm not being dismissive of business models. Like, what is it? The penguins have been selling their. They're like, you know, what do you call these? Like, pushy. Like, what do you call these things? Yeah, but, like, you buy these things, like, I don't know.
00:26:42.396 - 00:26:43.444, Speaker A: It's real life.
00:26:43.564 - 00:26:57.648, Speaker B: No, you buy them on Amazon. Right? It's like a blame on my name. My God. Anyways, I'm not dismissive, like these things. Like, if you want to buy like a real life representation of your punk, like, or a print, like.
00:26:57.756 - 00:26:57.952, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:26:57.968 - 00:27:06.376, Speaker B: There's like adjacent revenue streams you can tap into. I think then it was where I'm more. What was that?
00:27:06.520 - 00:27:07.656, Speaker A: They're called plushies.
00:27:07.760 - 00:27:15.856, Speaker B: Plushies, yes. This is the work. So anyways, plushies. Yeah, yeah. If you want to, I would buy a plushie of some of these things. Like these cute little penguins. Yeah, it's fine.
00:27:15.856 - 00:27:27.816, Speaker B: The question more is like, how far do you, like, thread the needle? Like, oh, this utility narrative and rebuilding a game or reinventing Disney, like, but it's going to take a lot of time.
00:27:27.960 - 00:27:28.688, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:27:28.856 - 00:27:42.080, Speaker B: And resources. Some of these projects have raised a lot of resources. And so anyways, I'm not like, dismissive of that. I'm just, I think this is why, again, I go back to punts, because they don't pretend to be anything other than art.
00:27:42.112 - 00:27:51.200, Speaker A: Yep. Yep. All right, let's get past nfts. Let's talk about funding. Right now. You mentioned to me, you said deal flows up a lot. Yeah.
00:27:51.200 - 00:28:11.790, Speaker A: Looking at some of the numbers. So the deal flow, if you actually look at the numbers of companies raising, is down. So let me just run through these numbers. January 66 fundraises. February 95, March 68, April 60, May 61, June. We have two days left in June 46. That number is the lowest of the year.
00:28:11.790 - 00:28:25.270, Speaker A: However, the interesting thing is the most amount of seed and series A companies fundraisers in June. So 39 seed deals in June already seed in series A, I think it was.
00:28:25.302 - 00:28:29.078, Speaker B: So you're seeing very little larger deals.
00:28:29.206 - 00:28:29.702, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:28:29.798 - 00:28:46.786, Speaker B: The other thing, this is a lagging indicator because you're going by the announcement and sometimes, oh, I've closed the deal and it takes three, or the team doesn't want to announce or it takes three months to announce and they're, or they're tying that announcement to some sort of other strategic, um, announcement.
00:28:46.970 - 00:28:47.586, Speaker A: I mean, we.
00:28:47.650 - 00:28:48.194, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:28:48.314 - 00:28:49.674, Speaker A: Like, uh, weather.
00:28:49.754 - 00:29:30.840, Speaker B: There's always some lag. I will say I'm now, like looking at twelve different opportunities. There was a time where I was like looking at for one or zero for what felt like April, May. It was like very soft, even February. It was, it was just slow. The new, a lot of it is new deal flow, certainly like the deal. The deals that I saw earlier this year felt more, or were more in the camp of projects that I've, I was an investor in looking to raise more money under the realization that they were under the liquidity crunch.
00:29:30.840 - 00:30:14.206, Speaker B: Some of the deal flow now is a combination of that. Because, look, some companies are doing actually very well and they're executing and so they would just want to buy more. They don't know. If you go back to that episode with Avichal and Haseeb and Havi chill, and both of them, I think especially habitual, said, look, it could take another one or at least one and a half, two years of this bear market and liquidity is going to be really dry. And so I think if you're a founder, a lot of them realize that. And so they want to extra insurance and buffer. Interestingly, though, three projects that Im an investor in have returned capital this week, which is great to see, actually return capital.
00:30:14.270 - 00:30:15.326, Speaker A: Like theyre done.
00:30:15.430 - 00:30:48.370, Speaker B: Yeah, like 60, 50, 60, $0.70 on the dollar. Theyre like, look, we raised around last year, either one of our founders have lost conviction or as a team, we havent really found product market fit and we just would rather return capital. We may come back later and I think that's, uh, in most cases, nine out of ten, I think it's, it's probably more teams should be doing that kindly and I respect that a lot. And so anyways, that's been, that's been fairly interesting too. But, yeah, a lot. A lot of the composition of the rounds, mixed bag.
00:30:48.370 - 00:31:37.764, Speaker B: A lot of them have been, um, still, still a lot of infra, like a lot of infrastructure. ZK slap Zk on something. Ck, vm, ck yada, yada, yada. AI, of course, is your crypto AI for a while, has been circling, and a lot of times they come attached with slightly higher valuation, but just categorically, valuations for seed and series a are down a lot. And I'll tell people this is a great environment to be deploying capital if you have it, because a Cedar series a deal is getting done at a fifth of the price. So fairly compelling. Like $7,000,000.10,
00:31:37.764 - 00:31:59.994, Speaker B: 1520 up to 30, which 30 is now rarefied. Like a lot of people now are very, very sensitive and it's a lot of times the investors that were not very sensitive, like not very valuation disciplined in the last cycle, like. Or like now over corrected. But yeah, yeah.
00:32:01.654 - 00:32:05.354, Speaker A: What types of companies are these? Are these defi companies? Are these gaming?
00:32:07.054 - 00:32:30.454, Speaker B: They're a combination less gaming. Now, I would say out of the twelve, like two or two are gaming for like infrastuff. Like a lot of interest in like launching new l two s, for instance. Like three new l two s. I just think there's.
00:32:30.574 - 00:32:41.206, Speaker A: Okay, are they l two s? Or are they, you see what async launched this week. Is it like Zkstack, where you're basically giving someone the infrastructure to go launch their own l two s? Or is it a new l two?
00:32:41.350 - 00:32:42.922, Speaker B: No, it's a new l two.
00:32:43.078 - 00:32:48.482, Speaker A: I don't get that game. Is it like, everyone launching l one? It's the l two is the new.
00:32:48.658 - 00:33:15.700, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, the. I could see why. Because you control the stack. You control some parameters. A lot of them are building on top or for, you know, the op stack. And some are, I'd say, the more interesting ones and differentiated ones are those that, like, no surprise, I'm continuing to explore the banking idea. A lot of people have told me, hey, shut it down.
00:33:15.700 - 00:33:16.580, Speaker B: Like, don't waste your time.
00:33:16.612 - 00:33:20.460, Speaker A: Like, I got from folks being like, satya should not do that.
00:33:20.532 - 00:33:50.476, Speaker B: Yeah, a lot of people like, listen, man, like, I like you, but I think on this one, let me save you the headache. And I was like, I've had a lot of headaches in crypto. Like, I could just be like, maybe doing something, going be a professor somewhere. Just, I don't know. I don't know what I'm good at. But I've met some really interesting folks. And the reason I mentioned this is because I've had two conversations with founders and teams that have been building a lot of financial infrastructure.
00:33:50.476 - 00:34:32.318, Speaker B: Like Robert snooting, you're plugging off chain world, not real world assets, but kind of like off chain world with on chain stuff. One of them is a particular new l two. That is KYC permission, you know, to make it easy for financial institutions to kind of operate in a very safe environment, but still settling with, like, you know, kind of like on Ethereum. So. And some companies, which is really interesting, have built a lot of products, have really good teams, and just need another jumpstart. Like, they've been kind of dormant and they haven't gotten traction. And those companies, like, like, this reminds me a lot of prior cycle.
00:34:32.318 - 00:34:48.674, Speaker B: Like, you looked at Aave, for instance. Like, they weren't, they were not going anywhere. Not because they weren't doing stuff, because the market was just not paying attention and it needed, like, a kickstart. So they rebranded to Aave. They changed the token economics. Kyber did this too. Synthetix did this too.
00:34:48.674 - 00:35:32.534, Speaker B: And in crypto, unfortunately, if you're not in top, the top 20, like in that first page of coin of Coingecko, good luck. And this goes again. Go back to the discussion with Abhi Cho and Haseeb it's like the question to them was, would you rather invest in a new project or an existing project that's been around for a while, but doorman left for dead. I don't know, like the market historically, I think the data would show the most. You would probably skew towards a new project because people like new shiny toys. But from a absolute return perspective, I would argue sometimes you can get a fantastic price for, for really good assets that are more de risked, meaning they're not just a white paper, they're just not a slide. You don't really know the team.
00:35:32.534 - 00:36:11.976, Speaker B: You've actually seen them out in the wild. And those are fairly interesting. I'm looking at one which is like financial infrastructure, like net settlement to really minimize counterparty risk. Like, for instance, in moments of crisis, like when Luna went down, when three arrows had these issues and was going down, like you would march of 2020 during COVID Like, your number one immediate thing is, can I trust my counterparty genesis or whatever? And when you're doing these traits, it's like you don't even know they're going to settle. Like they're going to send it back. And so it's an issue. And this company is like trying to solve that.
00:36:11.976 - 00:36:49.074, Speaker B: Like they've been building for like four years now and they have great backing. There is a really high valuation last round, and so it's, you're, they're kind of stuck. They're, they haven't, they need a jump start. They're willing to, like lower valuation and kind of have this go. But they need the right partner to get that attention in the market because they've also talked to customers when they didn't have that much of a product. So these are like some of the deals that I'm really excited about because it goes back to the idea of a bank, which is people might say like, okay, you've really gone crazy. You're telling me you want to start a bank when Silicon Valley bank signature Silvergate, all these banks are going down.
00:36:49.074 - 00:38:02.546, Speaker B: But I actually think its the best time because I forget who told me this, but its like the second run at a good idea is probably the best investment that youll make, not the first. And I think were in that environment where a lot of people dont have money, have done stupid things. Capital is really dried up, which means you can get stuff way cheaper, you can invest in very decent valuations, but also get teams. Like, it could be in the public markets, it could also be secondaries, it could be recapitalizations of entire businesses where you can just pick stuff up for pennies in the dollar, really good assets of teams that haven't come up, and all they need is another jumpstart. And you come in, you give them a fresh capital injection, and you get it off the ground. Because I don't want to talk about the ETF, but I think there's a lot of momentum there, and I think a lot of what the approval of an ETF could mean and the effects that, that could have the second order effects around regulation and really clearing the path for other stuff. And what you're seeing in Europe, like, all of these things, again, I don't want to talk about it that specifically.
00:38:02.546 - 00:38:23.436, Speaker B: I want to talk about the catalyst, because momentum changes really quickly, especially in crypto. And so I think you got to think about, okay, if that happens, then all of a sudden an investment that you may have thought would have taken years because traffic moves slowly, you say, no, actually, this might be the right time to do this. And so.
00:38:23.500 - 00:38:42.372, Speaker A: Yeah, what do you think? I've seen a lot of deals for bitcoin only companies, and I really don't like that strategy. Or like a bitcoin only wallet or a bitcoin. Bitcoin related, you know, bitcoin only related, uh, exchange. I'm. I'm. I think I'm, uh. I'd love to hear those.
00:38:42.428 - 00:38:44.932, Speaker B: Yeah, I have, you know, I have. Maybe people don't reach out to me.
00:38:44.948 - 00:38:48.748, Speaker A: Because people probably don't reach out to you because you're, you're. This is such an.
00:38:48.796 - 00:38:49.324, Speaker B: I mean, I'm.
00:38:49.404 - 00:38:50.044, Speaker A: I've.
00:38:50.124 - 00:38:52.228, Speaker B: Look, I have a lot of, like we had when he.
00:38:52.316 - 00:39:13.642, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't do. I don't do any of them because it's a, it's a losing strategy because look what. Look what happens when you try to scale. So let's say you're bitcoin only and you have a really successful bitcoin only custody product. For example, like, take Casa. Do you remember, you know, Casa, like Casa Hodl. They were bitcoin only then they launched after like, four or five years, they launched ETH.
00:39:13.642 - 00:39:44.492, Speaker A: And because the bitcoin maxis are so, so, like, stuck in their ways when Casa launched ETH, they. The pushback was tremendous from the, from their core customers. So. And I think this was the thing that you remember in 2017 when Coinbase dealt with this. Coinbase just had, I think, bitcoin and ETH, and they were debating. It was the debate between Brian and Balashi about whether or not they should list long tail of assets. And it shouldn't be a debate.
00:39:44.492 - 00:39:51.864, Speaker A: If you're building a marketplace business, you need as many assets as possible. Look at Nasdaq. Nasdaq freedom to transact.
00:39:52.234 - 00:39:53.914, Speaker B: That's it. Like you should. Yeah.
00:39:54.034 - 00:39:58.914, Speaker A: I don't understand. Yeah, I know. Like I, it's a go to market strategy, right. So like.
00:39:59.074 - 00:40:07.650, Speaker B: Right. And he, and look, I think it's interesting what they're building and ornos have like really taken off and whatnot. But no, I is actually kind of interesting.
00:40:07.682 - 00:40:40.820, Speaker A: Like stacks is a, is weird, has weirdly become a levered bet on bitcoin right now because they did their token raise, but it was one of the only compliant token raises. You remember that, that I dont have talked to some funds who are buying stack because its not investment advice, et cetera, et cetera, but buying it because its a levered bet on bitcoin right now and its actually really, its really tough to get levered bets on bitcoin right now or just exposure in general to bitcoin. Yeah, Coinbase is one way, Preston.
00:40:40.892 - 00:41:43.690, Speaker B: I really pay attention to whats happening in Coinbase because I think its just a general, like, proxy of the overall market's understanding of crypto and appetite. Of course, that was rally like 50% in the bottom because Balboa came out like this is Seth Klarman saying, oh, yeah, we're not taking a view on the company. We're not bullish on the company, but we think these things are mispriced, which tells you the market pendulum, as Howard Marks said, swings to extremes and sometimes things are left for dead. And so, yeah, I think this is the environment where whenever there's a disorderly shakedown in markets, you tend to see mispricing all around. People just flock to safety and they're willing to trade a lot for perceived safety. And those are the moments where you hear standard Millie heal. All these folks talking about like, these are the fat pitches or whatever, whatever you want to call them, but generally, like, you never really kind of knew.
00:41:43.690 - 00:42:30.374, Speaker B: I think, like Vance pushed back and said, like, I don't really feel like I've ever felt that I've done a, like, had a fat pitch, but I'm like, I feel like you start intuiting, like when you look back and you say it feels uncomfortable, feels like you shouldn't be doing it. But you see other people being for sellers, like, for instance, like Robin, who's liquidating a bunch of like, alts because you know that's what they're doing. Like, you have certain, like, bankruptcy proceedings happening and fire sales. And so to me, I look at that, and that's generally combined with negative headlines like the box literally ticked off the bottom, ticked the bottom of their headline, like, this is the worst time for crypto. Crypto is dead. These headlines, generally with forest sellers, generally coincide with market bottoms or at least really good moments to take a long term view in the space.
00:42:30.534 - 00:43:06.024, Speaker A: Yeah, last thing I want to discuss here, pretty light newsweek, I'd say, but I think we shouldn't discuss. One news item is prime trust. Let me just give the overview of prime trust for folks because I think it's helpful to lay out all the details. The background here is Prime Trust is an infrastructure provider for a whole bunch of different crypto companies in the space. Let's say you want to build a consumer app, for example. Let's say you want to build a consumer app for crypto. You raise $5 million instead of having to build all the infrastructure yourself, the KYC, AML, the onboarding, all that kind of stuff.
00:43:06.024 - 00:43:47.630, Speaker A: Oftentimes what will happen is you build the front end and everything else sits on top of prime trust. So there are a lot of series seed, series A, and some series B, though by series B, you start kind of hacking away at the stack. A lot of seed and series A crypto companies that have built their entire stack on top of PrimeTrust. June 7. Three weeks ago, prime trust, it kind of leaked out that prime trust was in trouble and that they were doing a, they were doing an emergency $25 million raise. So that was June 7. June 8, Bitgo announced that they were acquiring prime trust, that the deals of the term weren't disclosed, but it looked like Bitco is going to acquire 100% of the equity of Primecor, who is the parent company of Prime Trust.
00:43:47.630 - 00:44:31.774, Speaker A: That was June 8. June 13, Bank B A N Q, which is a prime trust subsidiary, filed for bankruptcy protection in Nevada. And according to the filing, bank had a little over $17 million with total liabilities of five and a half million. So folks thought that you had 17 million liabilities, 17 million in assets with little over five and a half million of liabilities. Fast forward a couple more days. June 20, about a week ago, prime trust halted deposits and withdrawals, sent out an email saying that they're halting both fiat and crypto withdrawals and deposits. Day later, PrimeTrust seeks receivership from Nevada after it receives a cease and desist from the Nevada regulator.
00:44:31.774 - 00:45:15.734, Speaker A: A day later, no surprise here, Bitco terminated their plans to buy Bitgo. They said in a tweet that after considerable effort and work to find a path forward with prime trust, they moved to make the hard decision to terminate the acquisition. And then earlier this week, June 27, we're recording this. On June 29, in a Tuesday court filing, the state agency asked the court to impound the assets and related properties of prime trust immediately. It also moved to enjoin Prime's employees from removing prime property without the permission of the court mandated receiver. Prime trust, per the Monday filing, was only $861,000 short of paying back its outstanding crypto based obligations to clients. However, here's the kicker.
00:45:15.734 - 00:46:11.844, Speaker A: FID alleged that PrimeTrust lost access to legacy wallets in 2021, and in order to make up for the customer, for the shortfall there, they use customer assets to buy back their crypto. So if you actually look at the numbers for crypto, PrimeTrust owes 69 and a half million to clients and they have 68 and a half million. So they're like, they're like a million dollar short. However, in fiat, they have $2.9 million, but they owe customers 85 and a half million dollars. So that's the kicker right there is they owe clients over $80 million right now. They use customer funds to try to dig themselves out of a hole, and they lost access to legacy wallets all the way back in 2021, which is a real bummer because I know I invested in like six different companies that built their businesses on top of prime trust.
00:46:11.924 - 00:46:12.492, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:46:12.628 - 00:46:24.584, Speaker A: Starting after 2021. So that means the CEO of Prime Trust, whoever was back then, knew that they were onboarding folks when they were, when they were insolvent. That is a, that is a scam.
00:46:25.084 - 00:46:56.928, Speaker B: Let me ask you two questions. One, like, who watches the custodian and attest to this stuff? And second, if you're a client and you're looking at your custody assets, wouldn't you be able to see this flow of funds and misappropriation of funds? Or I guess, like, the funds are still. I guess the funds are stuck in a wallet, right? Someone tagged the wallet on Twitter. I saw it. The funds are there, but they have lost access. So I guess what you're saying is people wants are there, right?
00:46:56.976 - 00:47:10.490, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah. Yeah. And by the way, there's one more kicker, which is I think it was Arkham. Arkham intelligence, kind of a wallet tagging tool. Similar to Nansen. 88% of the crypto that Primetrust holds is.
00:47:10.490 - 00:47:31.424, Speaker A: This is audio token. So they have 69 million in crypto. But is this audience not audio? I've never heard of this thing. Audio 61 million of the 69 is audio token. So, yeah, it's a bummer. I mean, I got a couple of investor updates. Like, one of them said it bluntly.
00:47:31.424 - 00:48:06.946, Speaker A: They're like, prime trust was insolvent ever since we started working with them. Brutal. So, yeah, I guess at this point we wait to hear how the FDIC, how it plays out here. But I'm hoping that for some of these smaller companies, some of them only had maybe 250k in like a settlement omnibus account, maybe another 250 or 300, and like an ACH reserve account. So hopefully, because those are, it's pretty small dollar amounts, hopefully the FDSC figure, you know, gets that money back. But, yeah, go ahead.
00:48:07.090 - 00:48:40.672, Speaker B: I was gonna say that there's obviously one implication here. TUSD, it's like the fifth largest dollar peg, stable coin, 3.1 billion market cap, I believe so. You know, I'd say like nothing major, but he's still big. It's obviously people got wind of this and it's important because they said that they had no exposure to prime trust. But then they sent an email to their customers saying there's no more, no more minting and redeeming due to prime trust. So I mean, like, you know, follow what's happening on chain and never trust what people are telling you.
00:48:40.672 - 00:48:58.802, Speaker B: It's sort of the moral of story. But, you know, I like a lot of people are shorting it. There's, you know, obviously, look at the APy Nova, it's 50 over 50%. People are like borrowing to USD and then selling and like basically shorting it. Um, so yeah, it has a whole host of like, effects.
00:48:58.938 - 00:49:05.826, Speaker A: Yeah. But I think USD, I think Nick Carter had a good tweet on this. It looks like Tusc below justice low. It's like 26K. So it's.
00:49:05.890 - 00:49:14.002, Speaker B: Why. Why would they like. But why would they then halt minting and redeeming?
00:49:14.138 - 00:49:20.310, Speaker A: That's where it's a little. Not sure that one. That one didn't make sense.
00:49:20.502 - 00:49:26.902, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe from. They have to somehow figure out the back end flow some way.
00:49:26.918 - 00:49:33.398, Speaker A: Shakespeare how this works. But maybe the mint. The mint and maybe inside of how that infrastructure works.
00:49:33.446 - 00:49:41.674, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm trust possibly, I guess. But yeah, be wary, folks. If you're transacting trafficking to USD, just beware.
00:49:42.694 - 00:49:46.814, Speaker A: Make it something. This illegal thing. If you're like trafficking in TUSD.
00:49:46.934 - 00:49:58.234, Speaker B: Yeah, with. I use the word trafficking quite a bit. But if you're using touching TUSD, exposure to.
00:49:58.694 - 00:50:02.854, Speaker A: Weirder. Last thing is that you see Lesher launched a new company.
00:50:02.894 - 00:50:05.046, Speaker B: So yeah, terrify invested in it.
00:50:05.110 - 00:50:17.156, Speaker A: So, yeah, yeah. I talked to Ben about that a little while ago. I think it was paraphy, one KX Cumberland coin fund. And I think there's one more distributed, maybe.
00:50:17.300 - 00:50:18.204, Speaker B: I think so, yeah.
00:50:18.284 - 00:50:51.376, Speaker A: Yeah. So it's very cool to see tying this all back together to your conversation about investing in founders who have been at it for a little while in crypto. It's very cool to see some of these DeFi ogs, like Leshner take another swing at it. So Rob is building super state. Their mission is to create regulated financial products that bridge traditional markets. And crypto, as he put it, the primary limiting factor to DeFi is that crypto native assets are the only interoperable assets. Eventually, hundreds of trillions of dollars of offline assets will find their way out to blockchains.
00:50:51.376 - 00:51:05.064, Speaker A: We plan to facilitate that migration on Monday. We filed a preliminary perspective with the SEC for the super states short term government bond fund. It's pretty cool to see, well, have to have. I wanted to talk about what he's building here.
00:51:05.144 - 00:51:26.520, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. Rob's always been. When you, you remember, like, when compound, like, launched a treasury solution, and then they were thinking about going to Polkadot and building their own kind of chain. Like, I think this is always in the back of. If you kind of read between tea lines, it was always kind of in his mind. And now I think this is the way to express that thesis. Just cool to see.
00:51:26.632 - 00:51:30.184, Speaker A: Agreed. What else, man?
00:51:31.604 - 00:51:52.132, Speaker B: Nothing. I think this is a light week. Go out and listen to that episode with punk 6529. That was great. Any interesting books or movies that you've seen recently? Did you finish that poverty one? Goddamn it.
00:51:52.308 - 00:52:08.956, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. My new one. I'm committing to finally read the three body problems, which is, I think, the most popular book in China. This is a three body problem. Xu Xin Liu. It's very good.
00:52:09.140 - 00:52:10.184, Speaker B: What's it about?
00:52:11.324 - 00:52:21.588, Speaker A: I don't know. I'm only halfway through the first book. There's three books to realize. There's. I think it's like the Harry Potter of China or something. I have two friends who love it. One of them, Mike, loves it.
00:52:21.588 - 00:52:23.904, Speaker A: I think it's one of Mike's favorite books.
00:52:24.574 - 00:52:25.030, Speaker B: Nice.
00:52:25.102 - 00:52:26.750, Speaker A: Kind of like physics meets.
00:52:26.862 - 00:52:27.550, Speaker B: Uh huh.
00:52:27.662 - 00:52:31.886, Speaker A: Sci-Fi I don't know. I didn't. I can't talk to too much. I'm only. Yeah, like a third of the way.
00:52:31.910 - 00:52:33.518, Speaker B: Like a Neal Stephenson's kind of thing.
00:52:33.566 - 00:52:37.414, Speaker A: Like, that's what it seems like. I'll tell you once I read the first book.
00:52:37.454 - 00:52:54.224, Speaker B: Okay. I'm reading the jellyfish, what's called jellyfish ate backwards. This is a great book on aging. I love aging. As you know, the prior life, I invested in aging, startup work there, did research. So this is a nice book to just talk about, like, everything that's going on in the aging world.
00:52:55.084 - 00:52:59.572, Speaker A: Isn't that actually a thing jellyfish do, age backwards? Yeah, there's a. There's a type of jellyfish.
00:52:59.668 - 00:53:19.084, Speaker B: There's, like, fascinating thing about certain animals that just behave in a very different way that makes you think that, like, if you understand all the different processes that go on in their organism, then you could probably think about, okay, how does that. How do we age? Right. Some species, like, literally shut down as soon as they have birth. They die immediately. Like. Like octopus.
00:53:19.124 - 00:53:19.508, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:53:19.596 - 00:53:21.972, Speaker B: Once they give birth, like, they're done. Like, their mission is complete.
00:53:22.028 - 00:53:23.084, Speaker A: Spiders have that, too.
00:53:23.164 - 00:53:30.092, Speaker B: Yeah. Certain flies, like, um, certain whales never die. Alligators, like, some sharks, like, it's kind of crazy.
00:53:30.148 - 00:53:32.716, Speaker A: Yeah. There's some sharks that are, like, 400 years old right now. Yeah.
00:53:32.740 - 00:53:33.228, Speaker B: You know?
00:53:33.316 - 00:53:33.604, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:53:33.644 - 00:53:38.516, Speaker B: Oh, big time. So it's. Yeah, I love this stuff. So I. So far, it's been good.
00:53:38.580 - 00:53:40.780, Speaker A: You follow Brian Johnson? You know, Brian Johnson is.
00:53:40.812 - 00:53:52.624, Speaker B: Yeah, the guy who's, like, trying to, like, do all these crazy things and the blueprint guy. Mm hmm. I do. Yeah. Peter, Attia and Davidson, Claire and a bunch of, like.
00:53:53.084 - 00:54:01.684, Speaker A: I actually wanted to have a longevity panel at permissionless this year, but it got next. I thought that would be fun. Yeah.
00:54:01.764 - 00:54:13.664, Speaker B: Well, maybe the best we can do is put our brain in, have the AI train itself to, like, understand, like, our consciousness sort of, so, like, how we operate, and then just create a digital app.
00:54:13.704 - 00:54:22.244, Speaker A: I mean, Brian Johnson looks about as close as you could imagine. I would look like if it was like an avatar. Like, yeah.
00:54:22.624 - 00:54:26.480, Speaker B: Honestly, no, like, yeah, um, go get some sunlight.
00:54:26.552 - 00:54:27.764, Speaker A: Go get some sunlight.
00:54:28.424 - 00:54:34.584, Speaker B: Anyways, man, this is a great episode. Uh, good to see you. Um, thanks for tuning, folks, and, uh, yeah, we'll be here next week.
