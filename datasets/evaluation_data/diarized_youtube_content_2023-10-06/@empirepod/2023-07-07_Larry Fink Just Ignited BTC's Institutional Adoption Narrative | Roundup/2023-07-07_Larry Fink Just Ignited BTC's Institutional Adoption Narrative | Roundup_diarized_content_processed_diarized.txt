00:00:04.120 - 00:00:06.918, Speaker A: Santi, no prep today. Jumping right in. How you doing, man?
00:00:07.086 - 00:00:16.182, Speaker B: It's raw. I mean, the market is just doing its thing. People are blaming, market is raw. The NFT community is going through its first true cycle.
00:00:16.238 - 00:00:20.406, Speaker A: They're blaming capitulation in full effect. Huh.
00:00:20.590 - 00:00:40.078, Speaker B: You know, yeah, everyone's. The timeline is hysterical because last week it's like we're going to catapult from two k to three k. You're not even going to notice it. Everyone's sidelined. Now everyone's freaking out because we're going to have two more rate hikes. And it's just a reminder to slow down a bit, you know? How you doing?
00:00:40.166 - 00:00:42.070, Speaker A: Good time. Panic's a good time.
00:00:42.222 - 00:00:43.434, Speaker B: It really is.
00:00:45.454 - 00:01:00.502, Speaker A: I think the ability to stay calm during panic is going to be one of the, is one of the most profound skills that you can have or traits that you can have in crypto, alongside the ability to think for yourself and think independently. I think we're watching that play out right now.
00:01:00.518 - 00:01:35.378, Speaker B: I was going to say that people say, like, obviously, if you can hold two simultaneously, contradictory. If you can hold two contradictory thoughts simultaneously, it's a sign of high intelligence. The other one is that, that's like raw intelligence, but also the emotional side is, you know, I used to joke with, uh, in my former boss at this, this venture fund that I was at, and they're like long timers. They were like early associates at KKR, like, super successful careers. They've done like some of the biggest, most successful deals in private equity. And they were so dismissive of crypto. I think they still are.
00:01:35.378 - 00:02:00.562, Speaker B: And I'm like, guys, do you realize that what I've lived through, I've seen, like, now, four or five market cycles, maybe more. I mean, we see them like every year now. It seems like the education that you can get as an investor dealing with in crypto is bar none. I mean, just the level of things to keep up on a number of dimensions on a different strategies. Venture, hedge funds, liquid venture. It's wild.
00:02:00.738 - 00:02:34.544, Speaker A: Yeah, it is. Yeah. I was thinking about. Did you ever, I watched the yuval Harari, you ever read sapiens? So Yuval Harari gave this talk at the World Economic Forum, and he said that eventually and in the relatively near future, humans aren't going to have to think for themselves, because there's going to be so many algorithms and so many chips embedded in you, and you won't have to think for yourselves. And I was just thinking like, man, critical thinking. The ability to think for yourself is going to become exponentially more important in the future, I think so. Speaking of that, let's talk about today.
00:02:34.544 - 00:02:51.268, Speaker A: Here's what I'm thinking about. So Blackrock, obviously, Larry Fink just went on Fox Blur. I'd love to get your thoughts on blur. As you were mentioning, blur is kind of getting ripped for being the cause of the NFT bear market. I would tend to disagree. I know you'd probably disagree as well, but would love to get your thoughts. Talking about Coinbase on is ripping.
00:02:51.268 - 00:03:10.564, Speaker A: Some of the OG defi tokens are ripping. What else happened this week? Lido moved their treasury from ETH into Steve. Thought that was pretty interesting, but actually I'd love to start with threads, a non crypto thing. So Facebook announced threads, which is their Twitter competitor. Have you set up your threads account?
00:03:10.644 - 00:03:12.584, Speaker B: No, I'm too busy doing other stuff.
00:03:13.484 - 00:03:15.598, Speaker A: Will you, will you set up a threads account or no?
00:03:15.716 - 00:03:20.534, Speaker B: I don't know. I mean, the incentive to claim it is like, you want to have a good username, right?
00:03:21.394 - 00:03:21.938, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:03:22.026 - 00:03:26.130, Speaker B: But otherwise I have no interest for now.
00:03:26.322 - 00:03:26.906, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:03:27.010 - 00:03:27.434, Speaker B: Have you.
00:03:27.474 - 00:03:42.658, Speaker A: It's been, uh. I have not, I have not. But I probably will. Um, not because I plan on posting on threads, but just, uh, yeah, to claim the username. But also, I mean, as I say this, probably someone's out there claiming jason and claiming yan already, but that's okay. But no, it's. I think it's just fun to try new products.
00:03:42.658 - 00:04:11.916, Speaker A: It's also, it's on track to hit 100 million downloads in the first 24, 48 hours, which makes it the fastest growing social media app in history. I just think that's impressive. They already have 50, 60 million, maybe 70 million users already. I think it's pretty interesting. If you look at the data, if you zoom out and look at just the behemoth that Facebook has built. Let's look at the top ten apps. Top ten social media apps.
00:04:11.916 - 00:04:32.308, Speaker A: I'll read them, read them to you in order. Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp, Instagram, WeChat, TikTok, Facebook messenger, something called Duyin. I don't even know what that is. Telegram. Telegram just passed Snapchat, actually. So telegram and then Snapchat. So of the top.
00:04:32.308 - 00:04:44.562, Speaker A: What did I just say? Ten names. WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook messenger. Four of the top ten are owned by Facebook, so. And if anyone can do this distribution. Yeah, exactly.
00:04:44.618 - 00:04:51.174, Speaker B: They have like 3 billion users on Facebook that you could basically just. Then, that's a huge distribution base.
00:04:52.154 - 00:05:02.626, Speaker A: They have so many users that they've started that they have to create new Internet, right? They have to create, they have to give more people in the world more access to the Internet to get to grow the tam. So I think it's very.
00:05:02.810 - 00:05:22.808, Speaker B: At some point, they're going to get into the AI game, right? Because they have all this data on users and, you know, the stocks going to rip another two x and everyone's gonna be like, why didn't we think of that? You know, it's all these companies. I mean, they think of all the data that they have, just gonna leave it there. Folks, I'm not long meta, but he who controls the data can train them all.
00:05:22.856 - 00:05:41.460, Speaker A: We're living at a. At a historic time, right? You have the best. No matter what you think of threads, you have the best entrepreneur in the world building atoms, right? The best atoms focused entrepreneur in the world with Elon versus the best bits entrepreneur in the world with Zuckerberg. And they're going head to head. I think it's really cool. That's a problem. I think it's pretty historic.
00:05:41.460 - 00:05:42.084, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:05:42.164 - 00:05:45.024, Speaker B: Suckerberg. You'd say Zuckerberg is the best bits entrepreneur.
00:05:46.924 - 00:05:51.184, Speaker A: Yes. Yeah. There's 3 billion users. Who else would you have?
00:05:52.204 - 00:06:04.734, Speaker B: Well, I was more curious to understand the definition of best and how you define best, but, yeah, I agree. Like, as a matter of touching the world. Yeah, for sure. I agree.
00:06:05.034 - 00:06:10.210, Speaker A: Yeah. Used by the most people, biggest impact, whether or not you think impact, whether.
00:06:10.242 - 00:06:13.346, Speaker B: You think it's good or bad or relevant or not to you, but impact wise.
00:06:13.370 - 00:06:13.506, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:06:13.530 - 00:06:16.534, Speaker B: I mean, I think he's like, everyone in the world uses Facebook.
00:06:16.834 - 00:06:35.904, Speaker A: Yeah. So, to tie this into crypto a little bit, I've been thinking a lot about your social graph. Right. I think this has showed the value of owning your social graph. I think there's some things that are interesting with threads versus Twitter. There's supposedly kind of a different value prop from Twitter. Like, Twitter's clearly for news, politics more maybe, like, long form content threat.
00:06:35.904 - 00:06:53.740, Speaker A: Threads inside of Twitter have really taken off. I think what they're trying to do with threads is, like, share your personality, share your thoughts more. Like a more casual, more social Instagram. I don't really like that value prop. I don't think that's really a value prop. I think what they're missing there is, like, I actually treat Instagram as, like, a personal thing. Twitter, for me, is work.
00:06:53.740 - 00:07:30.354, Speaker A: Twitter, for me, is my work outlet. So. Okay, so tying it back to the social graph, the most interesting thing, I think, for me to watch is whether or not threads cares about giving you the ability to share your social graph. And so this guy, Adam Mosseri, who runs Instagram, let me read this post that he said. He said, we're committed to building support for activity pub, which is the protocol behind Mastodon into threads, said we weren't able to finish it for launch, given a number of complications that came along with building a decentralized network. But it's coming. If you're wondering why this matters, here's a reason.
00:07:30.354 - 00:07:49.410, Speaker A: You may 1 day end up leaving threads, or hopefully not end up deplatformed. If that ever happens, you should be able to take your audience with you to another server. Being open can enable that. And I think that is going to be the key thing to actually watch here. They're going to be able to get users. They'll get hundreds of millions of users. They'll end up getting a billion users for threads, probably.
00:07:49.410 - 00:07:57.590, Speaker A: I bet it'll be really successful. The social graph, and whether or not they follow through on that promise is, for me, the most interesting thing.
00:07:57.742 - 00:08:05.674, Speaker B: Where does that leave lands? Farcaster and some of the other crypto first applications.
00:08:08.814 - 00:08:22.294, Speaker A: I think it crushes them. I would love to have someone from Farcaster. We've had Stani on a bunch, so maybe not. There's no. We could have Dan Romero or Stani. Maybe we could have both them on to do. To do an episode there.
00:08:22.294 - 00:08:24.646, Speaker A: But I think it's not good for them.
00:08:24.790 - 00:08:52.074, Speaker B: And all the activation, I mean, the thing, the unfair advantage that Facebook and Twitter and all these platforms have is the distribution that they've acquired over the years. It's always a chicken and the egg problem. It's like, well, they have, they start from zero, but they, at this point in time, they have massive distribution. And for instance, like, they display Snapchat. Like Instagram rolled out stories. And then people, most, a lot of people except teens, stopped using Snapchat. It was like gone like that.
00:08:52.074 - 00:09:17.714, Speaker B: And the activation energy, a lot of the commentary I've seen recently is, so what are you supposed to, like, dual post and then go from there? A lot of the conversations and thinking I've done around lens was, you know, full disclosure of an investor was like, struggling to understand and activating it in my flow of like, when I think of like, tweeting, it's. I think it's a verb. I think of tweeting, I don't think of lensing.
00:09:18.934 - 00:09:58.274, Speaker A: Here, here. Here's why I'm slightly bearish on those apps, is because your social graph is something that you and I are talking about. Here. 99% of people don't even know what a social graph is. For most people, 99% what is a social graph? No, I mean most people's social graph are 50 people. Follow them on social, you've got co workers, family and friends, right? I think people only care about the ability to kind of transfer your social graph after you are famous or a celebrity or for some reason or another have built 50,000 followers or 100,000 followers, then you care about your social graph. But that's in reality probably 0.1%
00:09:58.274 - 00:10:06.294, Speaker A: of these platforms, maybe even less so for most people. It's just, I don't know, start on a new app and get your 50 friends, family and coworkers to follow you.
00:10:06.714 - 00:10:11.986, Speaker B: But practically speaking, say I have 100,000 followers, I could flex on them.
00:10:12.010 - 00:10:19.378, Speaker A: Sandy, I say hypothetically, speaking, hypothetically, if I have 101,400.
00:10:19.426 - 00:10:25.122, Speaker B: Oh yes. See folks, listen, he's really tracking because we have an active bet that who's going to have more permissionless.
00:10:25.178 - 00:10:31.378, Speaker A: I'm not worried about. I lost 100 followers this week. I was like, what happened? I think people listen to this and they like you more, so they've unfollowed me.
00:10:31.426 - 00:11:08.654, Speaker B: Thank you, folks, I appreciate it. Free beers on me and permissionless. Anyways, what does it actually mean? Like, okay, so I want to leave a platform, what is it to take your social graph because your audience is still going to be in that other platform. Anyways. What does it mean? Like you're going to target them, you're going to get their email, you're going to be able to interact with them by inviting them to come to whatever other platform. Then if that's the case, then the incentive is for everyone to then just start spin up their own server and have their own website and landing page and have people go in there and chat. But that's not the case.
00:11:08.654 - 00:11:13.498, Speaker B: I don't think that's the case. Maybe I'm getting it all wrong, but.
00:11:13.546 - 00:11:30.574, Speaker A: You want to know the dirtiest little growth hack of threads so far that hasn't come into play yet, but will come into play when, when it comes to churn of the platform to, you can delete individual posts, to delete your threads profile and the data, you have to delete your Instagram account.
00:11:31.394 - 00:11:50.244, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean the hook is there, but what is it? Going back to the initial question, like, people talk about this a lot, but I have never heard a concise answer on what is the social graph? When you talk about porting it, what does it actually mean? If you're like someone that, as you say, has a huge following.
00:11:52.184 - 00:12:24.900, Speaker A: I think it's pretty simple. It's like a mad, here's a, here's the. So today the world is built of social apps, right? And you follow someone on an app and you like, if I follow you on Facebook, I don't follow you on Instagram. You could envision this being very different, right? You can envision this being. There's a social protocol and there are just apps built on top of the protocol and following and unfollowing gets built into, into the actual protocol. So let's say I followed you on like the lens protocol. Any app that gets built on the lens protocol, we would automatically follow each other.
00:12:24.900 - 00:12:44.444, Speaker A: I think that's, I think that's the social graph or, you know, applied to Twitter and threads to make this more applicable. The ability to like port over all of my followers. So I now have 100,000 followers on threads and I follow, I follow, I don't know, probably 3000 people. Instead of refollowing all those people, I just automatically follow them.
00:12:44.784 - 00:12:54.656, Speaker B: That assumes that these other followers of yours have this profile set up in this other platform. They're going to correct the reality.
00:12:54.720 - 00:13:05.484, Speaker A: Yeah. Or when they create a threads account, it auto follows me because they followed me on the, on the social graph, something like that. I don't know, to be honest. We've never seen it. We've never seen it.
00:13:06.344 - 00:13:12.880, Speaker B: It strikes me as this problem of airline points that you have some consortiums, but what's the incentive for Twitter to allow?
00:13:12.952 - 00:13:13.784, Speaker A: There's no incentive.
00:13:13.864 - 00:13:22.884, Speaker B: There's no incentive. And so when we talk about this portability, it's kind of like a mute point for me. I don't understand it until I see it.
00:13:23.784 - 00:13:24.744, Speaker A: But you're probably right.
00:13:24.784 - 00:13:40.824, Speaker B: I'm fairly bearish on, on anyone that talks about social graph. Maybe I'm a lizard brain here, but I don't see the, I see the value of it in theory, in practicality. I really struggle to understand how it works.
00:13:41.244 - 00:14:20.944, Speaker A: Yeah. At the end of the day on social, people care about a few things. Fame, money, dopamine. They don't care much about their social graph. So let's talk about fame and money and other news. Larry Fink, who is the CEO of BlackRock, you like that pivot, appeared on Fox and I thought it was pretty, I mean, it was a pretty profound interview. He said that BlackRock wants to obviously comply with regulators, but more importantly, he added that his views, that bitcoin is basically digital gold, that crypto is this really unique monetary or investment because it's completely international.
00:14:20.944 - 00:14:34.560, Speaker A: I thought it was a very, in his minds, he called for the democratization of crypto. It was very pro bitcoin, very pro even. Not just bitcoin, but pro crypto interview. I'd be curious to get your thoughts on it.
00:14:34.672 - 00:15:08.972, Speaker B: Yeah, I think you nailed it. He's done a 180 pivot on his stance on crypto. Some have not, like Jamie Dimon has not. But it's impressive because they're the largest asset manager in the world, and their approval rating for ETF's is incredible. Like, basically only one or two have been denied. And did Larry wake up one day and come to this epiphany? No. I think there's a lot of institutional demand, whether it's now or in the future.
00:15:08.972 - 00:15:29.684, Speaker B: I think he sees it. And I think if you, you know the history of Blackrock very well. There's a great podcast that talks about it, of how they become just that. And they've been fairly innovative. And I think they see an opportunity because they are constantly in touch with their largest clients and they see the window here.
00:15:29.844 - 00:16:17.520, Speaker A: Yeah, why don't I share some of that history? Because I think people don't realize, people are just realizing how big Blackrock is. People think of Larry Fink is just the CEO. I would argue that Larry Fink has, is now more powerful than Jamie Dimon, or at least as powerful, is the most powerful capital markets person in the entire world. And I think people underestimate that. So if you actually look at the background, hes been on Wall street for 50 years. Basically, Larry Fink pioneered this idea of debt securitization, packaging up a bunch of different loans as bonds. He ran the trading desk for mortgage backed securities back in the day, eighties, nineties, early two thousands got clobbered, took a, took a wrong bet on interest rates, realized that client trust is important, risk management is important.
00:16:17.520 - 00:16:39.124, Speaker A: So decided to start a new firm focused on those two principles. So he went to his buddies at Blackstone, not Blackrocket. Blackstone Group got a $5 million line of credit. And that was when basically Blackstone financial management was born 20 years later. So that was early two thousands. I think 20 years later, bunch of m and a. This ends up becoming BlackRock.
00:16:39.124 - 00:17:08.793, Speaker A: Now, today, BlackRock is the largest asset manager in the world. They have $9 trillion, maybe, I think, actually recently hit $10 trillion of AUM. Largest asset manager in the world. But what's more important than any of that is just the power that he wields. So let me just pull up a couple of these stories. In 2016, he was touted as treasury secret, almost became treasury secretary. I think if Hillary had won the election in 2016, he would have become treasury secretary.
00:17:08.793 - 00:17:53.520, Speaker A: Very deeply politically connected, very vocal Democrat is often being heard as saying, as I told Washington, that's kind of his line. As I told Washington, let's see what else happened. There's some other big stuff. I'm trying to remember when this was. Okay, this is what it was in 2020. Do you remember when the Fed obviously started printing in 2020, kicked off the bull market, when J pal and the Fed needed to start buying corporate bonds to backstop the economy, who did they turn to do it? Blackrock and Larry Fink. When the FDIC came to wind down the portfolios of signature and SVB, who did they have do that? Blackrock.
00:17:53.520 - 00:18:05.000, Speaker A: So very, very, very connected. Largest asset manager in the world. And I think it's a, I don't know, it's, it's, it's as. It's the equivalent of Jamie Dimon.
00:18:05.072 - 00:18:22.040, Speaker B: I'm very probably or more, I mean, when Blackrock sneezes, the rest of the world catches the cold. I mean, they own, they have positions in pretty much every major company. They're, if not the largest, among the top ten largest holders by virtue of their size, also a huge investor.
00:18:22.152 - 00:18:40.868, Speaker A: I think they're, they start like this. The writing was on the wall, right. They made a huge investment into circle. Circle raised 400 million in 2022. I think it was April 2022. Two of the biggest investors, Blackrock and Fidelity Circle puts their USDC reserves into a Blackrock fund. A lot of people don't realize that.
00:18:40.916 - 00:19:23.244, Speaker B: Yeah, that's interesting because of real world assets. And you talked earlier about the resurgence of Defi and real world assets. We'll get to that later. Of how all this ties in. But I think one, it, the weight that they're now putting in terms of validating the asset class is probably the most important event in a couple of years. The approval of ETF obviously has a ton of bearing and weight, but also just being BlackRock, that I think is the kind of energy and catalyst that you need to change the tide and the narrative Wall street in DC. And it's Blackrock that can do it more easily than others.
00:19:23.244 - 00:20:02.334, Speaker B: I go back to a comment of Dana, I think Fitzpatrick, the CIO of Soros family office, and she said a couple weeks ago that said, look, it's going to be the incumbent legacy firms that really come up and pick up the pieces and dominate crypto. It's certainly starting to look like that thesis is. Is relevant. I'd say there's been also a lot of response after Blackrock filed ETF. I mean, Ark refiled, and then they're in contention, and then they're first and then second, based on a number of things. So there's now a fight, and then everyone else. I mean, I think it was wisdom tree and a bunch of others, like, filed an ETF.
00:20:02.334 - 00:20:37.772, Speaker B: So, you know, of course, you got to wonder what they have filed for an ETF, given their approval rating, knowing that they wouldn't pass. And I don't think that's the case. And I think they have a lot of interest from clients. I mean, that's the only reason why they would do it. I don't think Larry took it upon himself to read the white paper and then come to a massive realization, and then started sending bitcoin to friends and said, wow, my God, this is phenomenal. No, I mean, he's, I think, a very practical man and understands how we can expand his franchise. And this is an emerging asset class.
00:20:37.772 - 00:21:05.410, Speaker B: You're going to want to capture it, and you're going to want to capture it with an ETF. A couple other two points I want to mention. One, the discount on the grayscale products has been moving a lot. It. One point retail, a 59% discount. Right. And then it tightened to 30 ish range, I think, under the expectation that all of this is going to have an impact on the way the court rules on the grayscale and also how that can somehow unlock the trap.
00:21:05.410 - 00:21:07.930, Speaker B: Liquidity, if you will. If you can come.
00:21:07.962 - 00:21:09.890, Speaker A: What's the discount at now? Like 25%?
00:21:09.962 - 00:21:19.834, Speaker B: No, I don't. I don't remember. I think it's widened a bit now, but it's been. I don't think it's as tight as 20 here, but as you look.
00:21:19.874 - 00:21:20.394, Speaker A: 27.
00:21:20.474 - 00:21:21.026, Speaker B: 27.
00:21:21.090 - 00:21:22.274, Speaker A: There you go. Yeah.
00:21:22.394 - 00:21:57.884, Speaker B: Yeah. The second point, you talk a little bit of a transition in the coinbase, of course, that it's rallied a lot. I think two catalysts attributed to that. One, I think the Baupost group. This is Seth Klarman, who's probably one of the smartest amongst, like, Ray Dalio and Renaissance, like, Jim Simmons Fund. Like, baupost, like, margin of safety, that book itself, Seth Klarman is probably one of the most, like, low key guys, but, like, private guys, but, like, Baupost, as an institution is widely respected amongst. In.
00:21:57.884 - 00:22:10.748, Speaker B: Amongst Wall. You know, in Wall street. And so they announced, obviously, they had exposure to the converts of Coinbase. And they said, look, this is not an endorsement of the company, but we just think it was. You know, they have like $5 billion of cash and it's a mispriced instrument.
00:22:10.836 - 00:22:11.060, Speaker A: Right.
00:22:11.092 - 00:22:31.338, Speaker B: And then the stock like that, they went up, shot up like while all this while, like the ETF stuff was going down. And so I think those two factors really, like Coinbase went from 50 ish to like 70 box or so. Like it's rallied a bunch. The reason the ETF is talks up 130% this year.
00:22:31.426 - 00:22:32.774, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. It's crazy.
00:22:34.114 - 00:22:35.522, Speaker B: And if we'll disclose, I don't think.
00:22:35.578 - 00:22:38.454, Speaker A: $75 Coinbase looks like a steal in the bull market.
00:22:38.834 - 00:23:01.574, Speaker B: Listen, guys, I mean, I've been public about this for a while. I have exposure to Coinbase. So I have, I'm biased. We had the folks on talking about base. I think it's a company doesn't is not understood by Wall street. And I look at that as an opportunity to, one, an indication that we're early. And two, I've always asked this question when I'm making an early stage investment, one, is going to outperform ETH or the underlying bitcoin.
00:23:01.574 - 00:23:50.562, Speaker B: And second, am I better off buying Coinbase stock? Because one might like actually track or be rally first, but I want to go back to one thing. I know I'm kind of like all over the place, but the ETF is relevant because my understanding is that BlackRock disclose that they would use Coinbase. And of course, that was a huge validation. All of this while the government is, the SEC is suing Coinbase. And so, yeah, I mean, I think investors are obviously worried about the lawsuit and what the implications that can have on the company. But it's a huge endorsement when the largest asset manager in the world says, yeah, we're going to pick one player and it's Coinbase. And so I think, and if you.
00:23:50.578 - 00:24:18.614, Speaker A: Remember the announcement from. That was a great point, Santa, but the announcement from last year too, when Blackrock selected Coinbase to be. What's, what's BlackRock's professional trading platform? Aladdin is their professional. Is there like wealth management platform. They announced that they're going to give clients access to trading in custody via Coinbase prime. Right. So, yeah, so likelihood of a Coinbase acquisition by BlackRock.
00:24:18.614 - 00:24:20.482, Speaker A: What are you putting it out?
00:24:20.538 - 00:24:51.354, Speaker B: It was one of my predictions last year that there was going to be m and a and that value Coinbase would be a prime acquisition target for a fidelity of the world, a blackrock of the world. JP Morgan I mean, they could certainly swallow it easily. The question is, do you want it or do you keep it some sort of distance and you just work with them? Yeah, I don't know. It's actually an interesting question. Do you think they get acquired by Blackrock?
00:24:51.694 - 00:24:52.434, Speaker A: No.
00:24:53.134 - 00:24:56.794, Speaker B: Feels like it's. Yeah, no, no, I don't.
00:24:57.294 - 00:25:38.738, Speaker A: Problem with m and a from big companies like traditional companies into crypto is in a bear market. That's when you would do it. Right. Because the valuations are the most depressed. However, if you're like a public company or you're a larger traditional company, it's very tough to convince your board that buying a crypto company in a bear market makes sense in a bull market, when everyone's pro crypto and you can easily convince your board that you need a crypto strategy. Crypto valuations are far too high, so everyone always thinks that there's going to be a lot of m and a. But I think that's why you haven't seen the traditional to crypto m and a and then you haven't seen crypto to crypto m and a because a lot of people raised in a boom need and then need to get acquired in a bear, but their valuation expectations are far too high.
00:25:38.866 - 00:25:41.298, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, we'll see.
00:25:41.466 - 00:26:08.282, Speaker A: Yeah, we'll see. Last interesting stat. Then we can move on from that is average open interest for bitcoin futures on CME is at 2.9 billion. That is the highest it's been since December 2021, which was one month after picotop. Yeah. So I think this pulls some other folks into the arena, right? Like I interned at Capital group american funds, which was a huge mutual fund back in the day.
00:26:08.282 - 00:26:38.912, Speaker A: If you look at the top mutual fund groups, you have, like Blackrock, then Fidelity, Charles Schwab, JPMorgan Barclay Hedge, Fidelity State Street, Capital Group, BNY Mellon, Pimco, Northern Trust, Invesco. About half of those have crypto strategies. Like from the top, CEO driven crypto strategies. Blackrock Fidelity with Abbie Johnson, Franklin Templeton family run CEO driven crypto strategy. Half of those dont have crypto strategies. And I think what this is going to do is they're going to be forced, those, those big mutual fund groups are going to be forced into the market by their customers.
00:26:39.008 - 00:26:50.752, Speaker B: Yeah. So they all will respond, not because they believe in the space, but because they want to capture an opportunity that their clients, if not offered, will go elsewhere for.
00:26:50.928 - 00:27:05.314, Speaker A: Yeah. NFT capitulation. You mentioned it. What's going on with blur? Why are people, what is the argument that blur is blur has caused the crash to the market. Can you explain this?
00:27:05.354 - 00:27:35.544, Speaker B: Price goes down and people look for a scapegoat. I mean, a lot more nuance to that. I think the financial, the incentives of season one, two, three of blur, I think have, people are claiming that that has artificially, or I don't say, I mean, it's been influencing, if you will, the floor price and the activity of the NFT marketplace.
00:27:36.764 - 00:27:51.348, Speaker A: And is the argument that if you look at what Blur did, they incentivized a bunch of trading and specifically, actually they kind of incentivized some leverage. So what that did is it caused people who maybe had ten k to buy nfts. They maybe put 50k into NFts using.
00:27:51.396 - 00:28:23.008, Speaker B: Twitter, that on the margin. I think it was also the idea that with this collection, like an incentivized trading of specific collections, because you remember, initially, blur would only support, like, for the seasons, like it was, I think believe, like certain collections for the launch of. Was it blend. Right. Their marketplace. I tend to think it's like, you know what Blur is effectively, and we recorded two podcasts with Pac Man Titian. So you should go listen to those and form your own opinion.
00:28:23.008 - 00:29:10.874, Speaker B: But my, my view is that blur, whether you want to blame blur or not, the people that blame blur will blame blur or whoever else. Their view is that financialization is bad. My point is the market, what Blur has done is introduce more efficiency to what is to the market. Especially when you think of nfts, they're fairly more inefficient. And so it's sort of, you allow for more ease of transactions, you bring more liquidity. That creates more price transparency of these collections. And you got to wonder, was the price actually in the first place? It was probably inefficient.
00:29:10.874 - 00:29:55.814, Speaker B: It was probably, why don't we go out and blame all the hype of these collections that talk about utility and have not delivered? Why don't we talk about the celebrity endorsements and certain wallet providers that were like, sending and gifting nfts without publicly disclosing this to artists and celebrities? That's real. That's something that should be talked about more. But no, no, no. Let's blame this instrument that allows for more price discovery. I would say let's get to it faster. If we can create more efficient markets, then all the better, because you're going to have a better price discovery. I just hate fundamentally inefficient markets because then this is what happens, right? Can you, let me ask you a question, Jason.
00:29:55.814 - 00:30:21.322, Speaker B: How easy is it for someone to manipulate the stock of a public company that is worth like a couple billion dollars, a large cap like in the s and P 500? How difficult is it? Difficult, yeah, quite difficult. Like you can have people chat or you can have like muddy waters or whatever, put a report. Certainly has an impact. Right. But in crypto, it's so sensitive, right. Because there's low liquidity and there's not.
00:30:21.498 - 00:30:23.778, Speaker A: Get a little nice twitter thread going in.
00:30:23.906 - 00:30:24.530, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
00:30:24.562 - 00:30:25.594, Speaker A: Got yourself a problem.
00:30:25.754 - 00:30:52.178, Speaker B: So that's where I stand and I'm in that camp. Like we could talk about are the incentives structures correct or not? But look, there's always incentives no matter how you slice, whether it's earning blur tokens or there's another NFT marketplace that does this, you know, so that's my, of course we can talk about royalties and creator royalties and all this stuff, but, you know, I would just encourage people to go listen to the player episode.
00:30:52.346 - 00:30:57.374, Speaker A: Yeah, bored apes about to go sub 30 ETH.
00:30:57.954 - 00:31:01.122, Speaker B: I mean, is there a price? Would you buy them? Candidly, no.
00:31:01.298 - 00:31:02.714, Speaker A: Board ape.
00:31:02.754 - 00:31:03.682, Speaker B: I just don't like them.
00:31:03.778 - 00:31:13.430, Speaker A: I sold them. I sold, I wouldn't, I'm a, I'm not a buyer at any price. I mean, maybe a couple. Maybe a couple ETH. Maybe like like five ETH or something.
00:31:13.542 - 00:31:15.766, Speaker B: This begs the question, and I think.
00:31:15.790 - 00:31:24.542, Speaker A: Crypto punks under 40, I've done a lot of thinking since our last conversation. I think sub 40, sub 40 e punks are a nice buy.
00:31:24.678 - 00:31:49.744, Speaker B: I'm gonna ask you a question, like what does this tell you about the NFT marketplace, the fact that people are like one? I mean, I think it's going through a capitulation, but we've different moments of time talked about what is the composition of the NFT community? And does this, do you, like, what percentage would you say are purely buying these things? To speculate on them?
00:31:53.524 - 00:31:54.984, Speaker A: Just to speculate.
00:31:56.004 - 00:31:58.492, Speaker B: Like, I want to flip this in six months because I think the price.
00:31:58.548 - 00:32:21.526, Speaker A: I mean, previously probably 99%, but I think the folks who are left remaining are people who have, I mean, look at the, I mean, this is just like semi data driven. Look at the collections that are doing well. It's like punks, squiggles, autoglyphs, Fidenza. It's people who are as close to art collectors as you can get in NFT land.
00:32:21.590 - 00:32:23.414, Speaker B: I mean, there's still a lot of bag holders, right?
00:32:23.534 - 00:32:52.184, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, but that's, but that's who, that's what's doing well, right. Any of the like, metaverse land, building a game like those are doing awful. That being said, sandy, I still do. I like that this is how all markets go, right? You have greed, excess money comes in, deep bear market. People start blaming other people for failures and then market comes back. And it's interesting to see this happening. It does feel like NFTs are one year lagging behind Defi.
00:32:52.184 - 00:33:03.296, Speaker A: Basically. It feels like we just got into the absolute depths of the bear market for nfTs, full capitulation. This is where Defi was a year ago. A year ago. It kind of felt like Defi was.
00:33:03.320 - 00:33:05.844, Speaker B: Like, oh, arguably still is.
00:33:06.664 - 00:33:21.644, Speaker A: Yeah. But I mean, look at, look at, look at the price of some of these OG Defi tokens right now. Look at some of the innovation that's happening in Defi. We're about to have ECC, and I'm sure, you know, a bunch of the stuff coming out of ECC too. But like, man, the Defi innovation is nuts right now. Yeah. Stuff going on, liquid staking.
00:33:21.984 - 00:34:43.004, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a tough comparison, right? Because one is meant to be have utility, the other one arguably not, but I think I would have, I think this is a clear it reflection that most, a large subset of the NFT community is just speculators just fine, that just want to speculate. And look, the trade went sideways and hasn't worked out for them. And so maybe you should just, you know, when Price goes up, you're a collector, you're an art connoisseur, and you're in it for the culture. When Price goes down, it's like, oh, let's blame this finance, this platform that allowed for people to dump on me. Well, folks, I think this is maybe just reflect on why are you buying these things? I've said it time and time again. I don't consider, and people should go, perhaps even listen to the episode that we did with punk 6529, right, where he's, where we asked him, like, how do you think about, because he has a, he talks about items in a public collection that he never intends to sell, and he talks about certain pieces that are part of his fund that at some point he will dispose of and capitalize on. And I think it's, I'm actually fascinating to see how that thesis and that strategy plays out because I've always found it incredibly hard to let go of things that I collect.
00:34:43.004 - 00:34:54.114, Speaker B: And perhaps the most important distinction that I try to make when I make an investment is not to fall in love with it, but just think of like rationally where do I exit?
00:34:54.274 - 00:34:54.682, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:34:54.738 - 00:34:56.810, Speaker B: You constantly kind of revisit your thesis, right?
00:34:56.922 - 00:35:02.674, Speaker A: If you don't want to treat an investment like a collection, like a collector's item, you don't, you don't sell. You hold on to that. You pass it down.
00:35:02.754 - 00:35:37.152, Speaker B: An investment, I mean, look, is there, I think there's always a price by which you really could start contemplating. You know, say you buy a car for ten k and then someone comes in and offers you a million bucks. Well, you know how much you love the car. I mean I think you probably let go of it because there's other things that you might, you might want to buy a house, whatever, all these kind of relative opportunity costs. But what I'm trying to say is it's not the motivating driver for you to go out and buy things that you like as a, as a collector, I think, but, you know, teach his own. Look, I'm not, I'm just that this is my perspective. It has helped me in some capacity.
00:35:37.152 - 00:35:58.366, Speaker B: I know that some punks that I bought are deeply underwater. I still love them when I see them. You know, it's like, you know, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't go in there thinking, oh God, like this punk is like, I don't, the price doesn't compute as much. Like not even. Yeah, I certainly know what I paid.
00:35:58.470 - 00:36:46.706, Speaker A: By the way, Sandy, like, on your question of speculators, it is a funny thing that speculators are looked down upon actually. I think, and a lot of my, like non folks outside of crypto often like to say, oh, isn't crypto just for speculating? And I think if you like, read history and you study history, speculators provide the necessary liquidity and risk taking that enables new industries. And if you look at the oil industry, oil industry was fueled by wildcatters, these crazy speculators who purchased land and drilled in hopes of striking it rich. And that was speculation. But the speculation led to these discoveries of oil reserves which led to the growth of the oil industry. And then all the ancillary sectors that came from the. That like technology, right? Technology in part grew because of the venture capitalists were willing to take these huge, huge bets.
00:36:46.706 - 00:36:54.794, Speaker A: Even the rise of like agricultural industry, right? You have like early farmers taking the risk of investing time and resources into the land in hope of a future.
00:36:54.834 - 00:37:41.352, Speaker B: Yield, which speculating is part of the fundamental human desire to improve your condition. There's a nuance between are you speculating or are you gambling? But I don't have any problem with speculation. And in fact, I think it's, as you said, it is the primary driver for innovation, and we should not think of it as a negative energy. It fuels everything. I mean, it feels innovation fuels curiosity, everything, right? There's nothing wrong with making money. Some people, somehow this woke culture is like, oh, no, don't ever talk about money. Like, what's wrong with that? Like, you know, money is highly dense energy to move things and, you know, fuel interests and new movements.
00:37:41.352 - 00:37:43.000, Speaker B: Like, without money. Good luck.
00:37:43.152 - 00:38:12.904, Speaker A: Yeah. Last thing for you. And then we can make this a short roundup is. So I saw this week, Lido just executed proposal 161, staking all of the ETH, 20,000 ETH in the treasury into steeth. So they now hold. So this is their treasury now, 21% in steethy, about 63,000,075, 76% in Lido, which is 231 million. I just thought that was an interesting treasury management strategy.
00:38:12.904 - 00:38:23.944, Speaker A: Put your money where your mouth is. Question for you. And I don't know if you're comfortable sharing this or not, but what percentage of your ETH is some form of stake deeth?
00:38:27.264 - 00:38:35.484, Speaker B: Like between a third and 40%?
00:38:36.264 - 00:38:43.364, Speaker A: And why that number? Is that a. Like, do you, is that on purpose, that number? That's a thoughtful number. It just kind of happened that way.
00:38:44.024 - 00:39:20.592, Speaker B: I've, over time, just kind of staked it more, and I've restaked it for some other things, but I just like, sometimes like to hold, like, the question is, what I. Will I ever stake 100% of it? No, because I like to keep ETH pure sometimes to just do other stuff for risk management purposes, too. Like, I know it's liquid and whatnot, but, you know, I want to see more Lindy. I know, I know I'm forgoing a yield. That's fine. But you made me think maybe it should be. Should it be 60, 70, 80%? I don't know.
00:39:20.608 - 00:39:49.886, Speaker A: What do you think I'm going to make a decision on that. I don't have. Most of my ETH is not staked ETH, and I'm leaving money on the table, and I know that. So Bell Curve, another block works podcast, just launched season five, and it's an entire season on liquid staking, basically. So I plan on. Basically, it's on staking. Liquid staking tokens, restaking, eigen layer, liquid staking across different ecosystems.
00:39:49.886 - 00:40:08.742, Speaker A: Like, looking at cosmos and what that looks like kind of history of liquid staking, the risks of liquid staking. So that's a whole season led by Mike, and then also, this guy, Miles O'Neill from reverie, going to be a really interesting season. So basically, I plan on listening to that season and then making an assessment, but I think I'm underexposed to liquid stick.
00:40:08.798 - 00:40:23.374, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I'll listen to it, too. I don't think it's one of the. You kind of caught me there off guard a bit, because it's one of those things where I haven't been, I haven't paid, I haven't dedicated enough time to think about how much I want to stake, actually.
00:40:24.794 - 00:40:34.690, Speaker A: Same. But this, this new season's made me, made me start to think about it, so. Yeah. Yeah. Um. That's kind of all I got, man. Yeah.
00:40:34.722 - 00:40:38.162, Speaker B: A couple quick things. ECc coming up, so a lot of announcements will.
00:40:38.258 - 00:40:39.050, Speaker A: Are you going?
00:40:39.202 - 00:40:43.222, Speaker B: No, no. The only conference I'm going to this year is permissionless.
00:40:43.378 - 00:40:45.974, Speaker A: Let's go. Why?
00:40:46.134 - 00:40:48.674, Speaker B: I don't know. I just like, conferences are meh.
00:40:49.414 - 00:40:50.914, Speaker A: Why permissionless, though?
00:40:51.774 - 00:41:36.898, Speaker B: Because I'm actually excited to, for real go, because last year I didn't go. So, yeah, I think it's once a year, one conference once a year. I think. I think it's sort of where I've landed. I prefer to just. I'm more productive when I'm out of conferences, and if I want to see someone specifically, I'll make a point to do that. And I think it's more targeted sometimes I found myself going to conferences, and a lot of people are there, but the depth of conversation is unfortunately not really there because your attention span is so low, like you have, there's running around and all this stuff.
00:41:36.898 - 00:41:42.850, Speaker B: But I enjoy it. Like, you know, virtual conferences. I've done a lot. Yeah. Awesome.
00:41:42.922 - 00:41:43.170, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:41:43.202 - 00:41:43.930, Speaker B: Well, I'm excited to go.
00:41:43.962 - 00:41:45.898, Speaker A: Do we have you? What are you speaking about?
00:41:45.946 - 00:41:47.774, Speaker B: No idea. No idea.
00:41:48.074 - 00:41:59.826, Speaker A: It's a good lineup. We've got, like Voorhees, Anatoly, Raj, Hester, Pierce, Jesse from Coinbase. Let's see how to crypto at Apollo. Stanis, come in.
00:41:59.930 - 00:42:45.796, Speaker B: I think the composition of your, like, ECC is a great event. I've been there a number of times. ETH Denver. Some of these pure youth conferences are really good. I found myself one year in Paris in my hotel room or a cafe, streaming these videos in two x a speed while the conference was going on. And so I was like, okay, well, maybe I should just stay at home. But my understanding in talking to you, permissionless as a crowd, a more diverse crowd, and I'm actually quite curious to understand more, like the sentiment of someone you don't get Hester peers at ECC and so you have a mix of crowd and it might be one of the more diverse conferences out there.
00:42:45.796 - 00:43:02.504, Speaker B: It's not like BTC. Miami is pure BTC folks and then there's like side events. So I think it's more for that reason. I find it quite valuable. I mean, the other one I have been going to is Tokyo 2049 in London and Singapore. I don't want to go to Singapore. It's like too far this year.
00:43:02.504 - 00:43:07.176, Speaker B: So now I'm prioritizing going to permissionless.
00:43:07.320 - 00:43:24.524, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I agree. Yeah. If you've got like, you know, toggle or togrul, like the, you know, head researcher at scroll, you know, sitting next to Jim Bianca. Oh, it's Macro guy next to Ben Foreman, next to, you know, Ben Jones from optimism. So I'm pumped, by the way. People want to learn more. We, it's just blockworks.com,
00:43:24.524 - 00:43:25.736, Speaker A: permissionless.
00:43:25.800 - 00:43:46.314, Speaker B: So easy, soft plug. I guess, you know, um, the other quick thing I wanted to mention is I saw, I mean, just as an anecdote, we talk about secondary opportunities a lot. It sounds like Tiger paused their sale. I mean, they were like doing fire sale in their secondary portfolio. It sounds like they paused it because they got so low stink bids that they're like, you know, might as well hold the bag.
00:43:46.814 - 00:44:12.488, Speaker A: It's too tough to value individual companies. I think at that point, like they were selling off. I think it was like open season on 400 of their portfolio companies. Right. It was like anyone can buy anything. Yeah, so far, so, yeah. Did you see the tie? The thai exchange, I'm forgetting the name of them, but the leading crypto exchange in Thailand raised at a billion dollar valuation a year or two ago.

00:44:17.072 - 00:44:26.806, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, bullets survive, hopefully. I mean, at this point, a lot of founders are looking in the mirror and saying maybe that other valuation, wipe it out and recap and survive, you know?
