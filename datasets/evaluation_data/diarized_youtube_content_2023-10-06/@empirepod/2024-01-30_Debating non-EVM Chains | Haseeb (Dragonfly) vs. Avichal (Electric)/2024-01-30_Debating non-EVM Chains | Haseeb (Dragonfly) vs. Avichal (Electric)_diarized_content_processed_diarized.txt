00:00:00.200 - 00:00:15.398, Speaker A: That's sort of where, like, I start to get a little bit paranoid, where I'm like, okay, like, what's happening is everybody's. Not only am I optimistic about this, now, everybody's optimistic about this. And therefore, everybody's assuming a bunch of stuff is going to happen over two years. That's actually going to take, like, five or six years. And that starts to worry me a little bit, because then that means, like, the short.
00:00:15.446 - 00:00:25.518, Speaker B: Okay. I mean, look, you're, you're, you're saying that this worries you. You're saying that you're paranoid, but you're also, like, mega long, all of these things. So in what sense? In what sense are you everyone?
00:00:25.566 - 00:01:01.960, Speaker C: If you have been listening to empire, you know that Santi and I are fed up with unaffordable fees and frustrating transaction speeds that make the on chain experience basically unusable. So the arbitrum team reached out, and they showed us the platform. They showed us what you can do on arbitrum. Whatever you're doing, you can experience frictionless transactions at lightning speed on arbitrum. So head over to portal dot arbitrum IO and check it out. What's up, everyone? Before we jump into today's episode, I'm excited to share Empire's first ever security partner. Harpy is the best tool to prevent your wallet from theft in real time.
00:01:01.960 - 00:01:23.000, Speaker C: Harpy is not just a security solution. They are a peace of mind solution. But don't just take our word for it. Harpy is the only wallet security solution that protected 100% of its users from attacks like the ledger one and Q four, which was an off chain signature attack. To learn more about Harpy, click the link in the show notes or visit Harpy IO, forward slash Empire.
00:01:23.152 - 00:01:23.808, Speaker B: What's up, everyone?
00:01:23.856 - 00:01:49.512, Speaker C: Before we jump into the episode, little plug for digital asset summit coming up in London, March 18 to 20th. Tickets are pacing so far ahead of schedule that we had to decrease increase the discount code. So instead of Empire 20, it is now Empire ten. Head over to the website Digital asset summit Das London, March 18 to 20th. Use code Empire ten and get 10% off your ticket. See you in London. What's up, everyone? Welcome back to Empire.
00:01:49.512 - 00:01:59.392, Speaker C: We have our two favorite guests on the show. We've got a Haseeb and Avichal. We've got four guys in four different time zones here, so, yeah, welcome back to the show, guys.
00:01:59.528 - 00:02:00.360, Speaker A: Good to see you.
00:02:00.472 - 00:02:01.416, Speaker B: Thanks for having us.
00:02:01.520 - 00:02:04.004, Speaker C: Yeah, bring the energy.
00:02:04.984 - 00:02:12.884, Speaker B: I am going to try my best. It is early morning here in Singapore, but whenever I'm here with a beach we always just want to fight about. So I think it'll make it work.
00:02:13.424 - 00:02:13.808, Speaker A: Good.
00:02:13.856 - 00:02:47.914, Speaker C: Well, I'm excited for some beef here, I think. All right, so last time we had you guys on, we were talking, like, kind of mental models for investing in crypto. It was about maybe seven or eight months ago, heart of the bear market. And you guys basically laid out your kind of bull case for why you guys were excited, still excited, and what I would say is the heart of the bear. And now I think consensus is that we're back on maybe beginning of the bull. So I think maybe that's the best place to start. Haseeb, if you could maybe kick us off, and then, Avic, I'll ask the same question of you, like, what is your framework today for where we're at in this cycle?
00:02:49.494 - 00:03:29.868, Speaker B: So, bull market, bear market is fairly difficult to quantify in crypto. The reality is that if you look at the last year, like 2023, I think the lived experience of most people in crypto is that 2023 was this year of contrition. It was a pretty difficult year. Things were pretty slow and icy and not a lot of deals getting done and a lot of really challenging moments with the SEC coming after the industry, a lot of regulatory action. The reality was that if you actually just go look at the chart of crypto market cap over 2023, we were up every single quarter. Basically, things. If you, if you just look at the line, it just basically is just up into the right, almost uninterrupted for all of last year.
00:03:29.868 - 00:03:59.174, Speaker B: Now, basically, up until Q four, everyone was calling it a bear market. And I think the way in which they, in their mind it was a bear market, was just, the vibe was kind of bear market y. And I think the totality of, hey, we just, we're still feeling the FTX overhang. We're getting put on public trial. There's a lot of negative energy and attention on crypto, and that feels bear marketing, and there's not as much retail engagement. Right. And I think that's how people think about what it means to be in a bear market as opposed to what a price is doing.
00:03:59.174 - 00:04:44.198, Speaker B: Q four really feels like when the sentiment shifted. Q four was when you saw the crazy Solana run up ordinals activity. All the retail engagements start to come back, price action start to come back, and then basically, q one, of course, the bitcoin ETF has driven a lot of the story for January so far. So my sense of where we are in the cycle like you said, we're in a bull market now. I mean, if price isn't the indication, the retail engagement and the positive sentiment that you're seeing from retail, institutional investors, exchange volumes, flows, all those things are there now. So it's hard to argue that we're not in a bull market. I think the question is where are we in that bull cycle? And I think most people, I more or less agree with the consensus.
00:04:44.198 - 00:05:12.274, Speaker B: I think last year I was probably a little bit more out of consensus. Now everyone pretty much agrees this year is going to be a good year. There's a lot of positive catalysts. It's hard to really even see what there is to be worried about because it looks like all the regulatory risks that we were scared of are really getting pushed back and minimized by just how much energy and consensus is being built from the institutional side and even the legal and regulatory side around crypto. So it feels like a really good year vigil, maybe.
00:05:12.394 - 00:05:29.214, Speaker C: I would assume you agree with Haseeb. So ill throw a slightly different question to you, which is if we are, lets assume we are okay back in this bull market. I agree with Haseeb. We probably started at some point in 2023 and now its consensus that were back. How do you position as a fund for being back on?
00:05:31.034 - 00:06:11.804, Speaker A: I think you just get more paranoid. Like, I think what's going to happen, like the best time to invest is when it looks like a bear market and everybody's scared and the founders that are coming in have some true conviction and they, you know, it's like, hey, I've been doing a PhD for five years and I want to productionize my research. Like those are the best people to be investing in. The opportunists tend to come out when it's clearly a bull market. I don't think we're in like peak bull yet. And so you start having to have your sort of, you know, spidey sense going a little bit more and like making sure people are here for the right reasons not to, not to sort of milk it and, you know, you don't want to accidentally end up in the next FTX. So, you know, yeah, I think you just have to be a little bit more cautious, actually.
00:06:11.804 - 00:07:03.536, Speaker A: I will, I will add, I think, you know, it's when everybody is on the same page that this is definitely a bull market that I also think the market has a tendency to inflict pain. So I, while I agree that we're probably in a really positive sentiment and I think we're probably going to be in a good spot at the end of the year, both in terms of market and also just building and shipping. It's just so much backlog of great stuff that's going to ship over the next three, six, nine months, which are really positive catalysts. I also think that it's entirely possible that we're just over our skis a little bit, like the sentiment is too good relative to what's actually happened. I think the ETF is a good example here. I think a lot of people's expectations is that the way that the first couple of days here have gone, the first week, which has got a couple of billion dollars in, that, that's just going to scale linearly. It's just going to be now every week another billion dollars comes in.
00:07:03.536 - 00:07:28.064, Speaker A: And so we should just be at $50 billion pretty soon. And that's not really how these flows are going to work, I think. And so I think a lot of the sentiment, when it gets too positive, people get over their skis a little bit and then it needs to pull back. That's my guess for where we are right now, actually, which is pretty typical. If you look at prior cycles and stuff in this part of the pre having cycle, it's very typical for people to get over their skis for some reason, and then it pulls back.
00:07:29.244 - 00:08:26.114, Speaker D: So one of the things both of you traffic in private and public markets, perhaps Haseeb, you guys, more so on the public side, but nonetheless, how do you think about going back to what you said, Haseeb, of the indicators you're paying attention to as it relates to where we are in the cycle? And I appreciate you guys invest through multiple cycles, not just like a year horizon, but from a relative allocation of dollars. Certainly it's felt that private rounds have really ratcheted up. You're back to like the valuations are back up, the size of the rounds are increasing. The type of founders that are coming to the space are not just like the true crypto natives. How do you think about the relative opportunity cost of taking more duration of liquidity risk versus putting it in the public markets? It's also been a rally of have and have nots. Like Solana is going to ton Ethereum, not so much, but still prices are down 50 60% from the highs. So general question to both of you, how you think about allocating dollars in this current environment?
00:08:28.614 - 00:09:07.062, Speaker B: No, it's the right question to ask. Not all of our funds have the ability to just go buy Publix and say, okay, well, I like ETH versus doing a private round. You do need to pick your spots in a situation like this where, uh, you're right, there is a lot of catch up in the private market. Valuations which had been lagging Publix. I think if you look at, like, Q four was probably the best time to be doing privates, just because privates had not caught up yet with Publix, now they've kind of raced back into line. And so I think, you know, we're probably past the period where you're still going to be getting discounts going into the private markets. Um, that being said, like, I.
00:09:07.062 - 00:09:48.690, Speaker B: If you. If you do take the view that we're early into this cycle, and I think it seems pretty clear to me that we are, one of the indicators I look at is how much is retail really engaged. We've seen a huge amount of institutional interest. The ETF has obviously driven a lot of institutional eyeballs and a lot of buying from folks who previously didn't have access to the space or just had too many hurdles to actually get direct exposure. But if you look at the barometer I like to use within the US is looking at Coinbase. So where is the Coinbase app on the App Store right now? Coinbase app, last I checked, ranks 30th for finance. In the finance category, it ranks 30th, which means, like, we are not anywhere right now.
00:09:48.690 - 00:10:22.014, Speaker B: This is not like if you go driving an Uber, if you go to your barber, are they talking to you about tokens and what coins to buy? No. At least not my experience. So, to me, I think we're very, very early into retail, really paying attention and getting engaged. Now, that's not to say they will anytime soon. It could be a year, two years, who knows? Maybe the last retail cycle is over. I kind of doubt that, but it's something you have to take into account as a possibility. But the reality is that this is, so far, mostly institution driven, mostly kind of smart money driven up till now.
00:10:22.014 - 00:10:57.244, Speaker B: And I think once you start to see the macro environment shift, and once you start to see risk appetite really start to turn back on over the next year or two, that's when I think you're going to see a more broad based participation in crypto. Even the meme coin activity, inscriptions, all the stuff that we're seeing around this huge engagement of meme coins, especially on platforms like Solana, in absolute numbers, it's still pretty small. If you look at daily actives on Solana, we're not looking at 5 million people who are buying this stuff. If you look at that. Compared to what's happening on centralized exchanges, it's still a far cry from what we saw in 2021, 2022.
00:10:59.214 - 00:11:30.630, Speaker A: Which I think speaks a little bit to this idea of where is sentiment relative to the underlying fundamentals, who's actually using this stuff, and how much real utility is there and so on. And I think this is part of what creates the cycles in crypto is that the sentiment just gets so out of whack with where we actually are. And everybody that has been paying attention is so excited about something like the ETF happening. It took so long that I worry a little bit that we're over our skis right now in terms of sentiment relative to actual progress.
00:11:30.822 - 00:11:42.742, Speaker C: I guess I'd push back there when have. So I think what you're saying there is sentiment. It's like a ratio of sentiment to fundamentals, basically. But if you looked at the last cycle, fundamentals didn't matter in the slightest.
00:11:42.798 - 00:11:42.942, Speaker A: Right?
00:11:42.958 - 00:12:01.508, Speaker C: You have something like, I don't know. Or even if you look right now, maker is spitting off, I don't know, what did maker do last year? 100 million in revenue or something. Great fundamentals. Yeah, hundreds. Right. Coin is not going up, though. Avitral, how do you think about whether or not the best investments this cycle will come from fundamentals?
00:12:01.636 - 00:12:21.796, Speaker A: Well, here's a question. If you look at maker is a great example, because you might be able to look at the cash flow. The fully diluted valuation of maker right now is 2.1 billion. If you had a company that was making 100 million in revenue, not net profit, out to shareholders, would it be worth $2 billion today? I would argue it wouldn't be, actually. Now, there are reasons. I think you get a lot of the traditional public markets.
00:12:21.796 - 00:12:57.062, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly right. So to me, that actually suggests that there's some other reason that people are willing to value it as such. And I have my theories on why. One could be that there's a positive sentiment baked in. People are like, this is going to do so much more revenue in the future. And so the sort of growth rate that they're baking in could be that this thing's going to do a billion really soon, because that's how crypto works. Another could be that, which is one thing I hold is like, it's a longer conversation, but I think there's an argument to be made that network values for token networks will always have an implicit PE ratio that's much higher than public equities.
00:12:57.062 - 00:13:25.094, Speaker A: And it's a side effect of who's participating in the markets where if you have a bunch of people in Southeast Asia and Nigeria and West Africa and Latin America, and in these places, you're losing eight or 10% per year to the dollar. That's like zurp on steroids. You thought zero interest rates were bad, where there's just a bunch of money. What happens if your money's losing eight or 10% a year? You need to get it out. You need to get it into something. The way that that manifests in a market then is essentially really, really high PE ratios. And so that could be what's happening.
00:13:25.094 - 00:13:26.702, Speaker A: But I would argue, actually, like, you.
00:13:26.718 - 00:13:34.750, Speaker D: Talk about like a scar city premium that will continue to exist as long as people don't have easy access to traditional capital markets in the US. Like buying stuff like Google Easter, correct?
00:13:34.782 - 00:14:08.566, Speaker A: Yeah. And so, like, one way, like it manifests in the public markets on the US side is like, you get these crazy multiples on a Tesla or a Facebook or an Amazon, because what you have is a cohort of people that are baking a really, really high growth rate into the future projection of what this company or this entity, this network can do that could create a really high multiple. So a hundred million from maker could result in a $2.1 billion network value. Or the other theory I have is that it's a bunch of people all over the world who don't really have access to the US financial markets and don't have access to any good financial products. They don't even have access to dollars. And now all of a sudden, they have an entity that is producing cash flow at $100 million.
00:14:08.566 - 00:14:53.538, Speaker A: Right? So there's any cash flow coming off of this thing in us dollar terms is better than them losing 10% in argentinian pesos or 20% a year in naira or whatever their base currency is. And so their willingness to pay a very high, effectively, penalty for that cash flow is what then drives up these ratios. Um, but, but in either case, right, like, I think that's relative to the other opportunities that you might have. The sentiment is so far outstripped what you could do with that cash. Like if, if you're not a crypto fund, let's say. Let's say you're a family office, you're just a private investor, do you want to pay those kinds of multiples for that cash flow? I would argue you don't, unless you have a lot of positive sentiment. Right? So unless you sort of believe that there's going to be a lot of growth here, it's hard to justify those multiples, um, which is where I think the sentiment is sort of manifest.
00:14:53.538 - 00:15:04.494, Speaker A: So, like, I look at those numbers actually, and I don't, I look at that somewhat negatively. Like, I know you're sort of saying that's like a positive indication. I sort of look at that as proof that sentiment has outstripped fundamentals.
00:15:04.954 - 00:16:12.504, Speaker B: I don't know that's an indication that sentiment has outstripped fundamentals so much as that. You know, if you look at, let's, let's look at maker specifically in the case of maker, and I should disclose it, that we're long maker, I think the. So, so for one, you know, kind of actually a point in favor of AvicL, the forward revenue that you're looking at is probably overstated because of the fact that we know that interest rates are likely to come down. So it's likely, actually that the true correct adjusted forward PE is going to be lower than what you're seeing on token terminal, for example. That being said, I think what people are baking in when they're looking at maker is the fact that I don't know anybody who's not bullish on this RWA story in the sense that it's very, very clear that stablecoin supply right now, it's kind of been stuck at about 130,000,000,100 and 3140 for the last, call it like year and a half. And it's very clear this is a very temporary stopping point, especially as interest rates come down. There's going to be more and more cash that's find its way on chain and it's going to get tokenized and stabilized, especially if we get some kind of stablecoin regulation passed that's going to make it easier for people to get more comfortable interacting with stable coins within the US, much less internationally.
00:16:12.504 - 00:16:43.598, Speaker B: I don't think. I don't think there's any reason to think that this is not going to continue as a trend. It's basically, if you look over the last five years, it went from what's something like 800 million circulating in 2018 to now being like 140 billion. That's an insane growth rate. And I think we had a temporary stopping point during a pretty horrible bear market and historically high interest rates. We're moving away from that pretty rapidly. And I expect stablecoin supply to start expanding now that we're getting back into a much healthier environment.
00:16:43.598 - 00:17:23.154, Speaker B: And I think maker is going to be a beneficiary for that. So I think there are good reasons to think like, hey, there's some positive catalysts here, and maker has a lot of downside protection compared to a lot of other things that you can be investing into that are a lot more ripe for disruption. Maker at this point is one of the lindiest things in defi. People argue that it's boring. It doesn't really capture a lot of beta. Sometimes the rest of the market's moving, and Maker is just sitting there, standing in the middle of traffic, kind of unfazed by all the other excitement that's going on. Um, but I think there's a, there are very few things you can invest into that actually, really represent the RWA narrative and actually have real cash flow denominated exposures to what's happening with respect to that market.
00:17:23.154 - 00:17:27.970, Speaker B: Uh, Maker's kind of the biggest game in town in that regard, and I think it's a, it's a, it's a real force.
00:17:28.162 - 00:17:55.844, Speaker A: So I should also, uh, two thoughts. One, none of this is financial advice, obviously, from, from any of us. And you should not listen to random people on the Internet, anybody that's listening right now. Oh, so second, I should also disclose, we're also a log maker. We also own maker. But I think what you're saying actually kind of proves my point, right. Which is like, the reason to invest is not because relative to today's cash flows, the price that you're paying is a great price.
00:17:55.844 - 00:19:06.932, Speaker A: It's that there's this reason to believe that in the future it's going to do really, really well, which requires a sort of set of assumptions about tokenization, about real world assets, about things moving on chain, about this being the beneficiary of all those trends, and hence, in five years or ten years, some long period of time, that you might have a good investment here as a venture fund. But to believe all these things, I think you have to have extremely positive sentiment. If you weren't extremely optimistic about the future here, about these trends, then you just wouldn't make those investments, which gets back at this point that fundamentally, in the short term, is sentiment driven, not fundamentals driven, and that has a tendency to get over its skis. And when that happens, we got to be really, then as an investor, you got to get really careful, because then the question you're asking is, am I being too optimistic about how quickly these things will happen? Because the tendency, especially for investor types or technology types or founders, is to underestimate how long it will take for things to happen. You have a tendency to be too early rather than too late. Right. And so that that's sort of where, like, I start to get a little bit paranoid, where I'm like, okay, like, what's happening is everybody's like, not only am I optimistic about this now, everybody's optimistic about this.
00:19:06.932 - 00:19:14.708, Speaker A: And therefore, everybody's assuming a bunch of stuff is going to happen over two years. That's actually going to take, like, five or six years. And that starts to worry me a little bit, because then that means, like, the short.
00:19:14.756 - 00:19:23.184, Speaker B: Okay. I mean, look, you're, you're, you're saying that this worries you. You're saying that you're paranoid, but you're also, like, megalong, all of these things. So in what sense? In what sense are you.
00:19:24.104 - 00:19:25.760, Speaker A: Well, no, you got to keep dancing.
00:19:25.792 - 00:19:26.840, Speaker D: While the music's on.
00:19:26.952 - 00:19:52.120, Speaker A: Well, no, because it goes back to, I think, the thing that Santi was talking about, which I often say, which is people overestimate what's going to happen in two years, but they underestimate what's going to happen in ten years. And so if you have a seven to ten year time horizon, then you can sort of tolerate that volatility in the short term. But I think you have to sort of. To the investment question, then you have to be a little bit careful about, are you, are you overpaying in the short term?
00:19:52.152 - 00:19:52.296, Speaker B: Right?
00:19:52.320 - 00:20:23.814, Speaker A: Like, are you, are you actually paying? You know, like, there's, there's people out there that bought ETH at 1500 and they saw it go up a bunch and came down a bunch and then it came back, you know, like, how much money have they made on their, like $1500 ETH as of today or like, at the end of q one or q two? Right. It's been kind of crazy. So, so there is an argument, I think, too, that even if you think ETH is worth a lot of money in ten years, and who knows if it is that being disciplined about the point at which you decide to make that entry based on where you think the market cycles are and so on, you can sort of factor that into your decision making.
00:20:25.034 - 00:21:06.352, Speaker D: One of the things I want to get your thoughts on vitro, obviously, you guys put up and have produced for a number of years now. This developer report, which I think is one of the most important reports and pieces of information that I look at to make investment decisions, I would love to transition. Talking about Solana versus the EVM centric mindset, I think most VC's are way overexposed to Ethereum and have been caught off sides with Solana. I'm curious how you guys think about that. The Ethereum roadmap and your conviction on that working versus something, clearly that we've seen consumer behavior in Solana and you can actually see a low fee environment. So we'd love to get your thoughts on that. I think it touches on modularity and a bunch of other things that are hot now.
00:21:06.528 - 00:21:53.820, Speaker A: Yeah, another disclosure, we also have a lot of Solana, and so you don't listen to me about anything. Yeah, it's interesting. I think on the report there's a couple of takeaways, I think, for me. One is that an increasing number of developers are developing across multiple chains, and so I have to go back and look at the number. I want to say it's like 30% of devs are now writing code that will hit, ultimately will sort of straddle up more than two chains, which is pretty amazing. And when you zoom into that, what's really interesting though is that 80% of devs or so, I'd have to go back and look at the number. I want to say it's like 70, 75, 80% somewhere in that zone are actually writing code for at least one EVM chain.
00:21:53.820 - 00:22:30.118, Speaker A: And so while you are seeing people write for more than one chain, what you are seeing simultaneously is a network effect around the EVM and convergence there. Not that dissimilar. I think a common analog that people will make is JavaScript, which is the EVM is busted in all sorts of ways, but these things tend to have a path dependency. So the Internet runs on JavaScript despite all of the challenges of JavaScript. And that's maybe where we are with EVM. Maybe these ecosystems will just have to use EVM in some form and that has a real network effect. At the same time, what you see is that these ecosystems like Solana that are not EVM, tend to have the most dedicated developers.
00:22:30.118 - 00:23:18.444, Speaker A: They have the developers that are only writing for those ecosystems. I think that's a really interesting go to market strategy for an ecosystem to essentially say we're going to not have devs that then later take their code and deploy it somewhere else. We're going to pick devs that only write for our ecosystem. And yes, that's a harder place to start, but over time that might be a higher retention strategy. For example, there are these really great flow diagrams that we looked at, where we actually looked at the code that's deployed on chain, and where does that logic first show up? You can fingerprint that and you look at the flow of code across chains in the back of the deck. They're beautiful diagrams, they're like, I want to turn them into, like, prints or nfts or something. But what you see is that actually most of the code that's on ETH originated on ETH, but there is something like 1020 percent of code that originated on b and B, or originated on polygon.
00:23:18.444 - 00:23:42.584, Speaker A: And actually, like 80% of the code that's on BNB came from Ethereum. So you're seeing sort of this like cross pollination. Right. But in effect, what that means is that there's a lot of people writing code in the BNB ecosystem, almost like a testnet for ETH. Right. What they're doing is taking some code, putting it over there, writing it, and then bringing it over to ETH later, which is fascinating that they're doing that. So it's not just ETH code being exported, it's other people writing code and bring it back to ETH.
00:23:42.584 - 00:24:05.796, Speaker A: But you don't see that with Solana. It's not like people are writing code in the Solana ecosystem and then porting it over to ETH after they figured out if it works or vice versa. That actually, over time, is an interesting advantage. We tend to think these things are not going to be winner take all. There's going to be some sort of power law. And if you think that the biggest winners are worth a lot of money, then even the second and third and fourth place winners could do quite well and have their own ecosystems. And there's a lot of precedent for this.
00:24:05.796 - 00:24:41.174, Speaker A: Right. If you look at take something like social networking, which I think people think of as like a pure network effect, kind of a business. Yes, you have Facebook, but at scale, you also got snap, you also got TikTok, you also have YouTube, and then you also have regional networks. Right? You have kakaotalk in Asia. Right? You have Vikontakte in Russia. And so at scale, you can actually have networks that are regional or bounded by communities that can also be really successful. So I tend to think that we're going to actually probably have way more alt l one s than most people would conceptualize today because of the way these network effects will work over time.
00:24:43.954 - 00:24:45.494, Speaker C: See if. How do you think about that?
00:24:48.114 - 00:25:00.240, Speaker B: It's a very interesting question. It's one that we've had to grapple with a lot of. So we own some soul people. It sounds like maybe we own less soul than he was. He had a big smile when he was talking about how much soul we owned.
00:25:00.432 - 00:25:02.976, Speaker C: But you own more makers, so we can count on that.
00:25:03.080 - 00:25:07.952, Speaker B: We do. Yeah. We do. Okay. That may be the indication of who owns what on a relative basis.
00:25:08.128 - 00:25:10.160, Speaker A: The relative slack claiming we owned it. That's right.
00:25:10.192 - 00:26:04.936, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. So, yeah, what's my look, my view on Solana is that I think we may have crossed the period where you can start a new programming environment for your own blockchain. I think there may have been a critical period, basically around, like, 2018 to 2021, where there was enough, like, the space was inchoate enough that you could start from scratch and still be competitive in terms of development, environment, auditing, firms hiring, all this stuff that has now increasingly solidified around a very small number of ecosystems. It feels like, basically there's EVM, which is by far the dominant paradigm for programming something. Nine out of the top ten chains, by TVL and by users, are EVM based. So vast majority of it is EVM, if you draw the pie chart. Second is SVM, which is Solana's virtual machine.
00:26:04.936 - 00:26:30.704, Speaker B: Then you have WaSM, and then you have move, and after that, it's just basically non existent. Now, there are other. There are other programming paradigms that people have put together, but they have basically a rounding error of adoption. And I think we're at the point now where if you start a new one, it may have been true for Solana in 2019, but it's not true anymore. Today, if you start a new programming paradigm, nobody will join you. The costs are too high. Only an idiot would constrain themselves.
00:26:30.704 - 00:27:26.428, Speaker B: If starting a new company, starting a new paradigm, hiring a bunch of engineers, trying to get super expensive audits for some programming paradigm nobody knows about, hoping there are no bugs in the runtime, like the enormous amount of commitment that someone would have to make to betting that your new l one paradigm is going to work against everything else that's out there, it's just too late. So my sense is that we're in the situation now where we've got the Android, which is EVM, which, I don't know, this may be a bad analogy, because there's some other connotations between Android and iOS, but we sort of have the Android, which is EVM, which is basically everywhere, and the vast majority of people on earth are using EVMs. Then you've got Solana, which is this higher end, super high performance thing. But there's only one chain, there's only one home for it. Maybe there will be other roll ups or something that are going to use the SVM. But right now, it really kind of seems like Solana is the only game in town. And if you're building on Solana, you're kind of pot committed.
00:27:26.428 - 00:28:15.996, Speaker B: And that's what you see from a lot of the Solana builders, is that obviously there's been a lot of churn through the bear market of people who end up dropping out. But there was no new people who came into Solana and started building. Over the last year and a half since the collapse of FTX, nobody in their right mind started building on Solana. Now you're starting to see people come back and some new renewed interest, seeing the retail engagement, seeing the price action, seeing the support and the ecosystem energy. But basically, it's like, if you look at the projects that are all successful in Solana, they're all people who started during the FTX era and were willing to stick it out through the valley of darkness. And that's kind of what built the strength of that ecosystem was the belief and the confidence that people had during a time when no one else believed in them. So they really kind of had their hero's journey in forging that collective identity for Solana.
00:28:15.996 - 00:29:12.698, Speaker B: And I give a lot of credit to them for having borne through that. But if you look at a lot of the other ecosystems that are trying to play for that spot that Solana's playing for, the reality is that it's really, really hard for there to be multiple contenders for the non EVM chain. I really think that right now, if you look at Nier, you look at the move chains, and we're investors in many of them, Solana is really pulling a lot of the air out of the room, and it seems to me at equilibrium, there's going to be probably one main non EVM chain that sucks up a lot of the non EVM use cases, and everybody right now is fighting for that spot. Now, to be clear, Solana is the front runner right now, but it's far from over, right? Very few of the non evms really have that much going on. In absolute terms, even Solana. Right now, most of what's happening on Solana is people trading meme coins. There's some defi stuff that's starting to work.
00:29:12.698 - 00:29:49.334, Speaker B: There's obviously a lot of airdrop farming. There's a lot of infrastructure that people are excited about, like Jito and whatnot. But in terms of real mass market applications, most of what's happening right now is happening on evms, whether it's binance, smart chain, or Polygon, or Ethereum, mainnet, or some of these other platforms. And so I think the race is still very young. Price, action, slot, has raced ahead and there's a lot of consensus that's been built around them. But there's a lot of game left to be played. And so I think if you draw the line out over five years, I think there's still a lot of room for people to jockey for that position to be that dominant non ethereum l one.
00:29:49.454 - 00:29:59.630, Speaker A: So Haseeb, do you think the market structure is going to be like 80 20? It's basically EvM and one other big one and then everything else is ultimately a rounding error or do you think it's more power law, like seven?
00:29:59.702 - 00:30:26.584, Speaker B: Basically. Basically I think it is going to be 80 20 ish with evms. And then the non EVM chain and the non EVM chain. It could even be bigger, it could even be like 30% or something. But I think of it actually a lot like operating systems. So if you think in terms of operating systems, I think in a way you can analogize the EVM to Linux. And Linux is at this point the basis for the vast majority of computing.
00:30:26.584 - 00:30:59.614, Speaker B: MacOS is based on the Unix kernel. And there's just, almost everything is just compatible with this thing because it's just the easiest thing for everybody to coordinate on. It's not high performance. It's not really designed to go fast or be good. It's just designed to be usable and everyone knows how to use it. So the paradigm is recognizable then you have now if you're doing robotics, if you're doing hardware for a car or for something that really requires high performance, you will not use Linux. You will use some kind of real time operating system and a real time operating system.
00:30:59.614 - 00:31:32.314, Speaker B: It strips out all the nice affordances, all the common paradigms. Everyone knows about user space and kernel space and all the security guarantees and all this other shit because it just needs to be really fast. You cannot have a robot or a drone get stuck in some garbage collecting like oh, we're sorry for switching from this kernel space to that kernel space and blah, blah, blah. Um, you need it to be super, super high performance. In the process of that you lose a lot of affordances. It's not very nice to develop for a real time operating system, but it's the only way to get super high performance. There's a class of applications that are going to want this.
00:31:32.314 - 00:32:02.284, Speaker B: It's not every application. In fact the majority of the stuff that people seem to use crypto for, um, they don't really need 400 millisecond, uh, latency, right? One, 2 seconds is fine. You know, if you're paying somebody, you know, one or 2 seconds is fine. It's not really that big of a deal if you're trying to do Nasdaq on the blockchain. Yeah, one, 2 seconds is not going to cut it. So there's a. I think there are use cases just like there are with respect to operating systems that require a very different set of performance guarantees for which people are willing to eat the glass and take the trade off.
00:32:02.284 - 00:32:07.964, Speaker B: That's, I think, what, in the long run, this whole system is going to bifurcate into. That's my thesis.
00:32:08.544 - 00:32:12.284, Speaker A: But why do you think it's operating systems and not programming languages or databases?
00:32:16.054 - 00:32:31.318, Speaker B: I think because with programming languages it's not. I mean, you can make the same analogy. It's just a little more tortured because of the fact that programming languages don't divide as neatly across use cases. A lot of the times, someone who's doing payments, you can do payments in.
00:32:31.326 - 00:32:36.714, Speaker A: Python, you can do payments in C, sort of. You don't want to render a web page and see.
00:32:38.534 - 00:32:42.102, Speaker B: Web pages are rendered in HTML. Right.
00:32:42.278 - 00:32:54.794, Speaker C: So, Joseph, do you think l one s will divide across use cases? So you think there'll be use cases, cases that are basically strictly only possible on Solana? Basically. And then there's use cases on the EVM. Essentially.
00:32:55.454 - 00:33:19.204, Speaker B: I think at equilibrium, you're going to see the vast majority of value, if you think of it value weighted. Not just are people trading nfts on Solana, of course they are. Are people trading nfts on everything? Yes, more or less. They're trading nfts on anything they can trade them on. But it's very clear, like, you don't need everything that Solana has built to trade nfts. Right? It's obviously overkill for trading nfts. You can trade nfts on fucking anything.
00:33:19.204 - 00:33:20.864, Speaker B: I did require.
00:33:21.924 - 00:34:09.604, Speaker A: I disagree. I mean, like, the history of the Internet would. Would suggest that is computing would suggest that that's not true. Like, this, this is sort of reminds me of the, like, bill gates who needs more than, what is it? Sixty four k of ram, or whatever his quote was, or two hundred fifty six k of ram. It feels like, actually, the history of computing is always like, the more infrastructure you throw at it, the more new use cases somebody figures out, and hence it sucks up all the infrastructure. I guess you might be, I might grant you, it's not clear to me if you need a true real time operating system to trade nfts, but as a side effect of there being a bunch of people who have seen a wealth effect on something like Solana, who then go and trade nfts, you now have saturate the network and therefore you have to figure out how to get more through it. And then somebody comes up and then somebody gets some new use case.
00:34:09.604 - 00:34:13.204, Speaker A: And therefore the new use case saturates the network. You enter this like Flywheel, right?
00:34:13.324 - 00:34:19.804, Speaker B: So, yeah, so I completely agree with you with respect to saturation. Right? So that's why I'm grouping the evms as like a big blob, right?
00:34:19.844 - 00:34:20.236, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:34:20.340 - 00:35:07.428, Speaker B: It's clear the vision for how EVM scale is not going to be. We have Solana and then we have the big EVM, right? I don't think, you know, even. Even with something like Monad, which is a parallel EVM limitation that I'm very excited about, it's not going to be able to absorb every unit of demand that people have for interacting with EVM chains. It's more that I believe over time, there's going to be more and more opacity to the end user of where their money is going and on what chain it's being settled. And at the end of the day, right now, we are in the age of. You are literally typing into your browser what protocol you want to use. Fetch this using HTTP, fetch this using FTP, fetch this using go whatever, like a gopher, the very, very old Internet client.
00:35:07.428 - 00:35:28.344, Speaker B: And that's where we are right now in crypto, where human beings are manually specifying these things and dealing. The reality is that, why is it that you as a human being are trying to figure out how to bridge across a protocol or where your USDC is or all this stuff? It doesn't require anywhere near your level of IQ to do this.
00:35:28.884 - 00:35:29.780, Speaker A: Arguably, it requires.
00:35:29.812 - 00:35:30.904, Speaker B: Right now, you're handling.
00:35:31.324 - 00:35:34.460, Speaker A: I'm always paranoid that I'm like, yeah, that's true.
00:35:34.492 - 00:35:35.036, Speaker B: That's true.
00:35:35.140 - 00:35:38.284, Speaker A: The problem is actually the opposite. It's like there's too hard.
00:35:38.444 - 00:36:02.554, Speaker B: No matter how smart you are, the paranoia does not go away. That's what I'm saying. It's like this feels like it should really be machine led. This should not be human beings doing this, but it is. Right now, all of this is completely transparent to us as users of all the nitty gritty details of how money is moving around, but people are doing it. They're moving the money around in this very mechanical way. That is what I'm looking at going to go away.
00:36:03.534 - 00:36:26.024, Speaker D: What did that then? Suggest that the percentage that you think the EBM share is 80%. Let's call it is actually going to be materially lower. If there's chain abstraction. Right now, you've seen, let's consider the number of users in crypto. Why are we going to slice it? It is a microcosm. We're all beta testers. Chain loyalty is not going to be a thing.
00:36:26.024 - 00:37:02.198, Speaker D: People don't have back bias when they're coming fresh into crypto. The next 100 million people will care, will not even care about any of these chains we're talking about. They will care about, am I able to do stuff faster, better, cheaper, which is a threshold by which people start using the stuff. And so when you think about, I agree with you, you don't need a Ferrari like Solana to trade an NFT or send a payment, but you do care. And I think Solana may have a greater shot at attracting attention. And if you're already doing one thing in Solana, then you may, you're probably going to end up doing most of your things, like, by virtue of just aggregation theory. I don't know if you would agree with that.
00:37:02.198 - 00:37:26.084, Speaker D: And so, like, my thesis is, why wouldn't Solana eat up way more into the EVM share today? Because you're seeing, like, Defi has been challenged, like, the number of, like, when fees are incredibly low. It really has unlocked, like, this nonlinear consumer behavior already. So wouldn't that dictate that Solana could really become that, like the inverse, actually 80 20?
00:37:27.984 - 00:37:54.460, Speaker B: Well, here's what I'd say. So when you actually have, I mean, this goes back to the very age old argument about horizontal scaling versus vertical scaling, right? And Solana is basically kind of max long vertical scaling. If we just scale the fuck out of this thing, we do giant beefy boxes. The history of technology tells us eventually you have to go horizontal, right? It doesn't matter how big you go vertical. Eventually, if you want to serve world scale, you always have to go horizontal eventually. Facebook learned that. Google learned that.
00:37:54.460 - 00:38:35.784, Speaker B: Everybody eventually learns you have to go even stack overflow, which is the poster child for, oh, we were all running this on one server. And, you know, scaling is for losers. Now they have two servers, right? So, like, eventually you give up and you realize if you want to be Internet scale, you have to go horizontal, right? And I think Solana recognizes this, that yes, we can scale the shit out of this relative to every other one. But that does not mean there is infinite capacity for having a decentralized network of big, beefy servers that can run all the compute that people want to on it. Eventually it will also get saturated, just like everything will get saturated because blockchains are physically bound. That is the way it works. Let's take that as a starting point that every network is physically bound.
00:38:35.784 - 00:39:09.986, Speaker B: Everybody's eventually going to have to go horizontal if we believe that. Hey, there is actually a mass market use case for this shit in that story where you are going massively horizontal. If you look at Facebook, how did they go massively horizontal? The first thing they did is they basically just did MySQL. Just lots and lots of MySQL databases all talking to each other. Just basically an off the shelf database or scale. Eventually they did Cassandra and all this other fancy stuff that was really, really specialized. But the easiest thing to do is to just get the thing that's easiest to use, scale it out horizontally and effectively load balance between them.
00:39:09.986 - 00:39:26.650, Speaker B: Right. The thing right now with Solana and look, I give a lot of credit to Solana. I think it's a very, very interesting and dynamic ecosystem. The reality is that Solana does not have anywhere near the robustness of tooling and the safety that the EVM has. Right. It's way better on performance. Performance.
00:39:26.650 - 00:39:51.154, Speaker B: It's like eleven out of ten on security. The reality is that we have. I don't think we've even seen a major Solana hack yet. Why have we not seen a major Solana hack? That seems really weird, given that everybody in Solana is writing in rust. They're writing in a super low level, unsafe language. All this stuff. How many auditors are there for Solana? Like three? There's not that many.
00:39:51.154 - 00:40:20.384, Speaker B: There's not the same level of open source, battle tested contracts. We don't have the same ecosystem of bug bounties and people who've been. What is it? What's it called? CTF. We don't have that same ecosystem of security around Solana. Even the protocol itself. The protocol itself has never found a major bug. There's been things that fell over because of demand.
00:40:20.384 - 00:40:59.534, Speaker B: Basically, the RPC's got hit, or there was just too much load and it fell over because of load. But if you remember, evms have been broken many times, and the EVM has existed for like seven years, and there's still bugs in the major EVM clients. We just had base who was a little while back, and then we had Nethermind, which had a major bug in it as well. Almost certainly Solana client has bugs in it. There's no fucking way that a code base writing something as complex as Solana does not have bugs the question is, why haven't we seen any? My theory of why we haven't seen anything happen yet is because most of this stuff is not open source, and it's just so complicated.
00:41:00.634 - 00:41:10.818, Speaker D: So I would challenge that, because that was my impression, too. Two weeks ago. I always felt like most of the projects were closed source, and there's a stat now, I think, like, the overwhelming majority of Solana projects are open source.
00:41:10.946 - 00:41:40.044, Speaker B: This has changed drastically. If you look at. I assuming you're referring to the DeFi Llama dashboard, which shows percent of open source versus closed source, which has gone from 40% a year and a half ago to now 90% open source. Right. I assume that's what you're referring to, because that's the only shareable number I've seen anyone ever share. That is a TVL weighted number that is showing by TVL how much of the stuff on Solana is open source versus closed source. That's in DeFi Llama's database.
00:41:40.044 - 00:41:45.524, Speaker B: That basically is saying that there's a huge amount of liquid staking on Solana, and that stuff is open source.
00:41:46.024 - 00:42:09.448, Speaker A: I think it's probably, I mean, based on the developer numbers we have relative to the developer numbers the Solana foundation publishes, I think we're off by about two x. That was, like the Delta. And my theory is that we track only the open source devs. And the Solana foundation is probably using, like, RPC calls or, like, they have. They have, like, endpoints that they're looking at that are, like, accounts. And so I think it might actually be pretty close to, like, 50 50 at this point. I always.
00:42:09.448 - 00:42:22.224, Speaker A: I historically had the impression, too, that it was a lot more closed source. But given that the delta between, like, the numbers we're seeing and what the Solana foundation put out was, like, two x, that's suggesting, me, we're, like, probably close to 50 50 at this point. I mean, it might be like, we don't.
00:42:22.264 - 00:42:22.640, Speaker B: Yeah, we don't.
00:42:22.672 - 00:42:53.094, Speaker C: I mean, we don't have to debate, like, open source versus closed source here, because, I don't know, we all have different numbers here. But, haseeb, I think the next question I'd throw to you is, okay, let's say it is EVM. What is the EVM landscape going to look like? Because there's the early folks, like arbitrum and optimism and the first l two s. Now there's this new wave of folks trying to parallelize the EVM, and there's say and Monad and this next wave of folks working on the EVM that look like in your mind?
00:42:53.754 - 00:43:25.332, Speaker B: Yeah. So it's very clear that part of the reason why Solana has gained so much mind share is because of their relentless pursuit of high performance. And everyone realizes that this is every bull market we see, that this is the problem is that we don't have enough performance. We need more scale, more DACA, more, just more, more, more. And in this case, I think Solana makes some really steep trade offs in order to achieve that performance. I alluded to some of them. Obviously we can debate the particulars of how much open source, closed source, whatever.
00:43:25.332 - 00:44:00.076, Speaker B: But one of the things that you get from Solana because of its pursuit of performance is that the EVM was really designed to be a smart contract platform from the ground up. And it made a lot of trade offs. Actually, I should take that back. It was designed in a harebrained weekend, but it has evolved to become more of a focus on just smart contracts. If you look on Solana, for example, just to drill in the point, and then I'll bring it back to parallel EVM on Solana. If you go on Solana block explorers, you can't see contract code. Why can't you see contract code? The whole point of blockchain is that you don't need to verify.
00:44:00.076 - 00:44:19.900, Speaker B: You can trust, or, sorry, other way around. You don't need to trust, you can verify. You should know exactly what you're interacting with. Even for the things that are open source on Solana, how do you know that the thing you're interacting with is the thing whose source is open? Seems like an obvious question. Well, on the EVM, it's trivial to do that. On Solana, it's not even the Solana, all the canonical block explorers, you can't see the contract code. You don't know what you're interacting with.
00:44:19.900 - 00:44:38.644, Speaker B: You kind of have to trust that you're interacting with the right thing. Now, one of the reasons why that is, is that most of the Solana build process is not deterministic. When you are compiling shit in rust, it's a non deterministic compiler. It's not designed to be deterministic. If you want deterministic builds, they're slower. And compilation in Solana is already a pain point. It's slow, it's annoying.
00:44:38.644 - 00:45:15.412, Speaker B: People don't want to. People don't want to eat the cost of doing that, at least not right now. And the culture doesn't demand it. So when you interact with things that are nominally open source on Solana, it's very difficult for you to actually even verify that the thing you're interacting with is the thing that supposedly is on GitHub. Evms have solved this problem, and it's very deeply baked into the culture of the EVM that you can't get one without the others claiming something is open source, but not actually being able to verify in a block explorer that yes, this is the bytecode that this solidity code produces. That is the only way to actually be confident that yes, this is the thing I'm interacting with. EVM gives you all of that.
00:45:15.412 - 00:46:00.676, Speaker B: It gives you the interoperability, it gives you the guarantees about transparency and verifiability, not because of something intrinsic about the EVM, but because of all of the tool chain and the supply chain and the culture and the audited code and the contracts and blah, blah, blah, all that shit. It's all already there, it's already been built. If we started with Solana, we started with SVM, we would probably all have all that shit for the SVM as well. But we didn't, we started with EVM. And so therefore the EVM is just the most built out ecosystem for this. So now I think there's this relentless pursuit to, okay, if we take it for granted that the EVM is JavaScript, look, JavaScript sucks. It was a horrible language that also was written in kind of a cocaine filled weekend by Brent and Icke, basically trying to shift something out as a v one, and we got stuck with it.
00:46:00.676 - 00:46:31.404, Speaker B: We're just stuck. It was horribly designed, it was not really built for being the world scale language, but it's now the most used language in the world because most computers are basically glorified browsers now. It's all we do is just sit in browsers. And so JavaScript is basically most of what your computer does is just run fucking JavaScript. So JavaScript is super, super, super highly optimized. It is probably the most optimized language in existence, besides maybe c and C. And so because of that, the analogy you can draw is, okay, the same thing will probably happen to the EVM.
00:46:31.404 - 00:47:36.064, Speaker B: I've been waiting for a very long time for somebody to really seriously do this, and it's more or less taken until this year for serious contenders to try to do to the EVM what has long been done by Google and Mozilla to JavaScript for that same process to happen to the EVM. If you look at something like Monad, for example, Monad, it's not currently live yet, say, is also doing a parallel vm. But my bags are in Monad. I'm going to show Monad. Monad. What they're essentially doing is taking the sort of the modern blockchain design that has massively changed since when Ethereum was first developed of separating execution and consensus using something like hot stuff or more PBFT style, more modern consensus mechanisms, totally rebuilding the storage system. Right now, almost all the geth chains, whether it's binance, smart chain or polygon or whatever, that just for Geth, their bottleneck is storage almost all the time, because Merkel Patricia trees, which are the data structure for Ethereum, just fucking suck to read and write to efficiently from storage.
00:47:36.064 - 00:48:15.092, Speaker B: And so they're basically designing their own database that only is optimized for storing and retrieving Merkel partition trees. And all of this stuff leads to really, really massive throughput gains. And then the last thing, of course, we talk about parallel EVM. I didn't mention anything about parallelization, because parallelization is actually a very small part of what leads to the performance gains in these new next generation EVM implementations. But they're also parallelizing. They're using block STM, which was originally created by Libra, and later by Aptos and SWE, or co opted by Aptos and Swe to basically do optimistic concurrency or parallelization. A little bit different from Solana, more similar to what Aptos and SwE do.
00:48:15.092 - 00:48:50.354, Speaker B: In assuming that, hey, we can kind of guess much more like what your processor does is guessing which transactions or which computations can be paralyzed. And if we get it wrong, okay, we rewind, and then we just do these things serially. That's a very high level intuition for all the things that these new generation of evms are trying to do to massively increase performance and get. They're never going to be Solana like performance because they're running EVM. And EVM is just a big constraint, but they're getting massively more performance than you can get just doing a vanilla geth type implementation.
00:48:51.214 - 00:48:58.102, Speaker A: So can I highlight a couple places where I think I just disagree with a bunch of this stuff that Hesi was thrown out there?
00:48:58.278 - 00:48:58.798, Speaker B: Go for it.
00:48:58.846 - 00:49:45.194, Speaker A: One, it's not clear to me that the right analogy is the operating system. I tend to think of these things much more like programming languages and databases, because I think you're, I don't know who said it, maybe Santib, but I don't think the end user five years from now is going to care that it's running on Solana or Ethereum or near or Monad or some l two, they just want to do the thing. They just want to solve a problem that they have. And it reminds me a lot of what happened with mobile or what happened with early Internet. There was a time with mobile where as an angel investor or as a VC or even a founder, you would go in and you would pitch and you would pitch that I'm an iPhone app, and I look at all the new APIs, and I take advantage of the new camera APIs, and therefore I can do XYZ. At a certain point, you just stop pitching that you were an iPhone app. You just went in and you pitched and you were like, I solved this problem.
00:49:45.194 - 00:50:10.696, Speaker A: And if at that point today, if you came into a VC's office and you're like, we're a mobile app that does XYZ, the VC's would look at you and be like, well, of course you are. If you're not a mobile app, what are you doing? That's where all the users are. I think we're on a similar arc here. And so five years from now, or seven years from now, or ten years from now, people just won't care what the database is that this thing runs on. And if we get to that world, it's not clear to me that. That these distinct.
00:50:10.760 - 00:50:11.136, Speaker B: That a.
00:50:11.160 - 00:50:30.856, Speaker A: The market structure will be 80% EVM one. Right? Like it's. That's just you can have a lot of fragmentation because a lot of different developers can choose to plug these components in in different ways. Like, you get one execution environment and one data availability layer and some other for settlement. And, like, you can plug these things together and the end user won't really care. And that might break the network effects, right. That might mean that you don't get power laws anymore.
00:50:30.856 - 00:50:51.776, Speaker A: You get a high degree fragmentation. Two, it's interesting that we think of this as EVM, right? Like, that just happens to be sort of the nature of the compatibility that we're talking about. But actually, underneath the EVM or a lot, you know, arbitram is different than optimism, is different than Monad is different than Ethel one. Like, you know, these are. These are actually different chains in some sense. And that in some sense also breaks the network effects, right.
00:50:51.800 - 00:50:51.912, Speaker B: It's.
00:50:51.928 - 00:51:48.602, Speaker A: It's different flavors of a thing that happens to be compatible and can talk to each other, but they're not actually the same thing. I also think that if it's true that the. The network effects are sort of the technology layer, but not at the chain layer, what that means is the real power in the ecosystem is at the layer of whoever has either the developers or has the users. And I think it's going to be actually towards the users. I think from that perspective, the real question, the question that sort of in the back of my head is, in ten years, are any of these things even worth remotely what they're worth today? Do you actually end up in a world where actually all the value capture happens at Coinbase? Because Coinbase is the place where you have to fiat your money in on ramp it, interact with a bunch of stuff, and it's on a phone, and who cares what chain it's on. I just need to do the thing. I need to move my money around.
00:51:48.602 - 00:52:06.954, Speaker A: I need to get to my payroll. I need to pay my creator friend $10 this month for whatever service and who cares what service it's running on. And so I think there's actually an argument here that this is not going to be 80 20. I think there's an argument that actually, even inside the eVM, it's going to be like 100 different things, and that the end user just won't care at all.
00:52:07.334 - 00:52:19.726, Speaker B: Okay? So let's take that for granted. Let's assume that we're in that world where there's total chain abstraction. As a user, I just have a wallet. I don't even know what this Solana wallets on. Ethereum wallet. It's a crypto wallet. And the wallet figures it all out.
00:52:19.726 - 00:52:21.270, Speaker B: It bridges. Bridging is fat.
00:52:21.382 - 00:52:22.278, Speaker A: That's not even magic.
00:52:22.366 - 00:52:23.406, Speaker B: All the fashion is gone.
00:52:23.510 - 00:52:31.910, Speaker A: Magic Eden is doing this now. For example, their new wallet just sort of like seamlessly switches between chains. You don't have to think about where you're like, is it a Solana NFT or is it a bitcoin NFT? I don't have to.
00:52:31.942 - 00:52:40.354, Speaker B: Sure. Let's assume that. Let's assume that it's multi chain. It does all the bridging. It's super smart, okay? It's like AI driven, whatever. Who gives a shit? So we're already there. Okay, we're already there.
00:52:40.354 - 00:53:07.562, Speaker B: It does not sound plausible to me that. Okay, because we're there because we're in that world where most consumers are interacting with this super smart wallet router app that like, let's take for granted that, okay, I want to trade. I want to buy a crypto punk. I want to move some USDC around right the way in which I move that USCC around. I think you're right. It's, it's going to be, you know, it doesn't really matter. It's kind of like swift, right? It figures out what rails to take the bank transfer to go from here to there.
00:53:07.562 - 00:53:31.158, Speaker B: It doesn't, you know, that's totally opaque to me. If my friend is on Solana, they'll get the USCC on Solana. If my friend is on arbitrage, they'll get on arbitrage. Right? So there, it doesn't seem to me like there's going to be a payments based monopoly per se, unless it's focused around liquidity and large size. But for small size, it can basically be anywhere. Okay, fine. Now, for the most part, I'm going to want to interact with a game, an NFT platform, a blah blah blah.
00:53:31.158 - 00:54:08.420, Speaker B: I want to interact with something. And the thing that I want to interact with, is it plausible that it's, okay, well, every single thing is going to live on Solana, or every single thing is just going to be dispersed uniformly across blockchain such that everybody sort of has their own blockchain. Or do we expect there to be some agglomeration where there's like, yeah, I want to. I want to buy this NFT, and I go to OpenSea, or I go to magic Eden, I go, whatever, and it just so happens that this NFT is on Solana or this NFT is on Ethereum. And it's still on Ethereum. Even five years later, it's still on Ethereum. If we ask the question why, five years later, is it still on Ethereum? Why is it not on? Okay, everything is on its own chain.
00:54:08.420 - 00:54:43.328, Speaker B: And because it's all abstracted, nobody ever has to worry about competing for block space ever again. And all the blockchains have no network effects and all the fees have gone to zero. Why didn't that happen? And to my mind, the reason why that didn't happen is twofold. One is that there are real good reasons why you want atomic composability and tighter integrations between certain ecosystems, especially when it comes to on chain liquidity. There's a lot of stuff in defi that benefits from having the liquidity there on the same chain. But the second thing in my mind is the intolerant minority. This is a concept from Nassim Nicholas Taleb, where he talks about.
00:54:43.328 - 00:55:20.796, Speaker B: I think the analogy he gives is kosher, like kosher food, in that most people don't give a shit about kosher. They don't care if their food is kosher or isn't kosher. If you tell me like, oh, these cheetos are kosher. Even if I'm not jewish, fine, I'll just eat the cheetos. But the people who are jewish, they really fucking care whether this stuff is kosher or not. And so they are basically going to dictate that every piece of, of junk food is kosher because you might as well just make it kosher so that jewish people also eat it. So this concept is known as the intolerant minority, where a small number of people with very strong preferences end up shifting the entire economy in a certain direction if the cost is relatively low in order to satisfy those preferences.
00:55:20.796 - 00:55:35.758, Speaker B: And this feels to me like the reason why NFTs are not just going to shard into 1000 different blockchains and be uniformly distributed over everything or over a kajillion l two s instead. I suspect the most valuable NFTs will still live on Ethereum.
00:55:35.806 - 00:55:36.350, Speaker A: Why?
00:55:36.502 - 00:55:59.834, Speaker B: Because they're probably going to be some hipsters in the year 2029 that are like, yo, I just believe that Ethereum nfts are more valuable than the ones on Solana. And I still care about that. And maybe most people don't. And maybe most retail people, yeah, they just know Coinbase and they don't even know what chains are. They just know crypto and their wallet figures it all out for them. But I still know, and I so really care. And like, there's something to me important about the Ethereum.
00:55:59.834 - 00:56:26.594, Speaker B: Culture religion, Solana culture, Solana religion, et cetera. Even if someone goes and forks Solana and says, oh, Solana is so expensive now. There's all this competition for block space. It's too, you know, state rent is too expensive on Solana. Solana is going to implement state rent. It's going to be expensive to store a state on Solana, but eventually there will be another Solana and somebody will fork it and you'll say, why not launch your NFT on Solana, too? And the answer is going to be, well, because it's not the real Solana. And some people will care about that, even if most people don't.
00:56:28.174 - 00:57:02.258, Speaker C: All right, I mentioned them in the pre roll. Now I'm going to bring them up again. It's arbitrum. Santi and I are really fed up with these high fees, and we're really excited to have teamed up with Arbitrum for the next couple of months on Empire as the leading Ethereum scaling solution. Arbitrum now powers hundreds of decentralized apps across defi, herps, nfts, gaming, and a whole lot more. The team has showed us everything in the ecosystem, both now and what's to come, and we're really, really excited about it. Arbitrum allows both daily users and developers to interact with Ethereum at scale with low fees and faster transactions.
00:57:02.258 - 00:57:35.406, Speaker C: The way the team got me excited was through portal dot arbitrum IO. So my call to action to you is to get started by visiting portal arbitrum IO. Go experience on chain like it was meant to be. For a lot of empire listeners, your crypto is not just another number on the screen. It's part of your future. I know Santi and myself feel that way. Our security sponsor of this episode, Harpy, takes this responsibility seriously and is the only wallet security tool that shields users from both on chain threats and sneaky off chain signature attacks.
00:57:35.406 - 00:58:20.758, Speaker C: If you've ever been in that situation where you're moving quickly, you approve something on chain, you realize that the address might be a dubious address, or you're really hoping that you could take that back. Harpy has you covered. Harpy can redirect your assets to your self custody vault, ensuring they remain completely under your control, safe and sound. With Harpy's always on monitoring, you're not just detecting threats, you're actively blocking and recovering compromised assets from malicious transactions before they can even confirm. On chain, Harpy is the only wallet security solution that protected 100% percent of its users from attacks like the ledger one in Q four, which was an off chain signature attack. So if you're serious about protecting your crypto investments, it's time to make the switch. Secure your wallet for free at Harpy IO, forward slash empire.
00:58:20.758 - 00:58:27.434, Speaker C: That's Harpy. H a r p I e IO. Forward slash empire. If you want it to be even easier, just click the link in the show notes.
00:58:29.054 - 00:59:21.172, Speaker D: I know it's early and. But, like, are you, like, I see this stuff that's happening in Solana, and I've constantly updated my thesis. Now I understand, like, the question that I think is most important is, like, why haven't we seen more hacks in Solana? I'm not sure. It's because, like, I agree. Rust is not, like, move. Like, move is, like, actually probably a language that, you know, we should be able to, like, we should probably, like, I would take it, but that move becomes a more prevalent language just purely on a security basis. And so if your JP Morgan visa, like, you know, that matters to you, but still, like, I don't know, like, I'm not hearing a very convincing argument as to why Solana can't, like, overtake evm, you know, and you hear time and time again from founders that are trying to, like, vampire attack in some capacity of EVM, and, like, you know, the current liquidity and users are there and the culture is there.
00:59:21.172 - 00:59:25.716, Speaker D: But is it really, like, I don't know, like, you know, I still am.
00:59:25.740 - 00:59:27.984, Speaker B: Of the mind of what is it really?
00:59:28.394 - 00:59:28.922, Speaker A: No, no.
00:59:28.978 - 01:00:16.324, Speaker D: Like, what I'm trying to say is, as you think of, like, investing your capital and where the space is headed in a ten year time horizon is where I'm looking. And if you extend, and I know it's you extrapolate what's happening today. I just think a lot, like, when you think about the scalability trilemma, you know, there is, I think, a threshold by which you reach in terms of sufficient security, sufficient decentralization, that I think Solana has crossed, that the most important thing at that point is scalability and fees being as low as they are in Solana, in my mind, is the most important driver that gives me conviction that Solana's share relative to the EVM is going to grow by an order, like, by meaningful share over the next 510 years. And I'm not hearing the same argument from you.
01:00:17.064 - 01:00:30.814, Speaker B: Okay. No, no, no. I am not saying that Solana is not going to continue growing. And I'm also not saying that Solana doesn't have a very important place in the ecosystem. Right. To be clear. And let me, let me re underscore this, because I think I may come across as though, like, I think Solana is going to die or something.
01:00:31.754 - 01:00:35.074, Speaker A: Just doesn't want the intolerant Solana minority coming after him on Twitter.
01:00:35.114 - 01:00:36.858, Speaker B: No, no, no. Come.
01:00:36.986 - 01:00:42.042, Speaker C: They already has raised up his pid for many times.
01:00:42.098 - 01:00:42.762, Speaker B: Many times, many times.
01:00:42.778 - 01:00:43.934, Speaker D: We're bringing Myrt on.
01:00:46.714 - 01:00:52.094, Speaker A: Cardano. People. Like, you learned your lesson with the Cardano one.
01:00:52.574 - 01:01:03.966, Speaker B: No, no, no. Look, the Solana team, the Solana team, like, they know I. Dude, I've been criticizing them for, like, fucking two years, and. But we still invest in Solana. Like, we own Sol. We invest into a bunch of stuff in the Solana ecosystem. They know that I want.
01:01:03.966 - 01:01:25.700, Speaker B: It comes from a place of love because, like, we're long this shit because we believe that what they're doing is great. Like, they're. They're killing it at the same time. Like, look, I think Solana is going to continue to grow because of the fact that this niche that they're going after is fucking massive. It's extremely important. Right. What are you going to be able to do with super high performance? And I think, in many ways, actually, I don't even know if it's so much about scalability.
01:01:25.700 - 01:01:42.716, Speaker B: Quas scalability in the sense of super low fees. I think actually low latency is the thing that's most important about Solana rather than the low fees. Low fees are a function of demand. When demand goes up, fees go up. That's just how it works. There's no magical we're the low fee chain. That means we are the capacity exceeds demand chain.
01:01:42.716 - 01:02:08.656, Speaker B: That's what it means to have low fees. When demand goes up, fees will go up, period. And if you're right that Solana is on this ascension, which, great, we're long Solana, I'd love to see that fees will go up. That's normal. Every chain goes through that. At the end of the day, what I am arguing is that it is very hard for Solana to play the same role that the EVms play, because they're optimizing for a different thing. To be clear, Anatoly is very clear about that.
01:02:08.656 - 01:02:29.604, Speaker B: He's always been very clear about that. That like, look, I'm not trying to be what ethereum's trying to be. I'm trying to be something very different. I'm trying to build the Nasdaq on the blockchain and everything that he is doing, from an architectural. From the point you were making about security and decentralization, I agree with you. In the very early days, I criticize Solana for lack of decentralization. I think Solana is very decentralized now.
01:02:29.604 - 01:02:44.504, Speaker B: I think the development of Solana is not decentralized, and that's obvious to everybody. That's true for every Alta one. No alto one has decentralized development, and that's fine, whatever. They're startups. My view on Solana is not. The problem with Solana is that it's not decentralized or it's not real. It's not a real blockchain or whatever.
01:02:44.504 - 01:03:03.292, Speaker B: There are people who make all sorts of criticisms about, and I made some of them, and I think they're real. And I do have real concerns about the auditability and verifiability of what's happening on Solana. You can't run a live client, you can't verify the code, blah, blah, blah. All that shit is real. They can eventually fix it. They haven't fixed it yet. But these are all solvable problems.
01:03:03.292 - 01:04:08.914, Speaker B: Nothing that I described is beyond the pale of solving. But it is just true that Solana is optimizing for a different set of things than Ethereum and the evms are optimizing for, and that's very likely to lead them winning in different sectors than the evms in which the evms are going to win. And you see it, the market is telling you this, that although DeFi is making a comeback on Solana, it is not as much as DeFi has made a comeback everywhere else. Right? So if you just look at the TVL recovery overall in crypto, Solana has recovered to something only one 10th of where it was in the FTX era, whereas there's been tens of billions that have flowed into the rest of the crypto ecosystem and all the evms, because evms are safer. Now, obviously, there are a lot more hacks that we've seen in the EVM space. Large part of the reason for that is there's a lot more shit to hack, right? Instead of having three protocols of which the code is all poorly understood and it's all written in rust, and there's not as much tooling to be able to actually, if you're a black hat and you want to go hack Solana, we should more or less. My view is that there's an efficient market's hypothesis around the stuff is that probably, even if you do hack stuff on Solana, it's hard to monetize a hack on Solana.
01:04:08.914 - 01:04:46.480, Speaker B: It's not as much liquidity. It's easier to choke things off. I don't know. I more or less assume that if you're a black hat and you're thinking about how to spend your time, there's also just so much laying fruit. Who wants to learn a new language when there's already so many fish in the barrel you can shoot in EVM land. But if Solana really does become dominant, which it hasn't yet, and it may, if Solana really does become dominant, there will be a reckoning for all of the tech debt that has been incurred on the Solana side. And there's certainly a lot now, they've been working on it, but I think there's certainly a lot, and I say that with eyes wide open.
01:04:46.480 - 01:05:20.130, Speaker B: I'm investing in Solana anyway because I believe its utility for the use cases they're targeting is there. And I think that's one of the things in which we haven't talked about, which I think is actually perhaps the most interesting thing about Solana is that no other chain, even Monad, even a lot of these other chains, nobody is trying to do as low latency as Solana. A big part of the reason for that is that Solana makes a lot of trade offs around the P two p architecture. The fact that there's one leader, the leader rotates immediately. There's no mempool, there's no mercalization. A lot of these things allow you to move much faster in rotating who the leader is. So Solana is 400 millisecond block times.
01:05:20.130 - 01:05:45.484, Speaker B: Nobody else is even close to that. If you're talking about stablecoin settlements, especially for traders, that is one of the things that I'm surprised has not already migrated to Solana, where the fastest way to move stable coins from exchange a to exchange b, if you're doing high frequency shit, is on Solana. Now. Most people do it on Tron. Tron is the predominant way today that people actually move stable coins from exchange a to exchange b. Well, if they want to be quickly.
01:05:46.024 - 01:05:53.444, Speaker A: The only thing faster than. Than a decentralized system with 400 millisecond latency is a centralized system. And so that makes sense.
01:05:53.864 - 01:05:57.376, Speaker B: But Tron is slower. Tron is like two second block. I think it's like two or three second block time.
01:05:57.400 - 01:05:57.944, Speaker A: Oh, is it really?
01:05:57.984 - 01:06:01.968, Speaker B: Tron is actually what? Tron is actually an order of magnitude slower than salon.
01:06:02.096 - 01:06:13.714, Speaker A: On the chain. It is. I actually don't know. I haven't looked at that. But on the chain, it certainly is. But are the exchanges honoring that, or are the exchanges doing stuff like, you know, presumptive, you know, closing the block?
01:06:13.754 - 01:06:21.938, Speaker B: And they're like, oh, no, no, no. So actually, you pull this up. I think Kraken has their. Kraken they published. Let me see here.
01:06:21.986 - 01:07:06.806, Speaker A: Confirmation. I know the data on all the volume is through Tron, but, you know, this might actually speak to, like, as you were talking through there, one thing I was thinking was, I think part of the reason that I think it's not anywhere close to game over. I mean, it reminds me of Facebook versus MySpace in some sense, which is an overdone analogy. But I think there is a lesson here, which is MySpace had 80 million users when Facebook got started and Facebook won. And so these network effects, even at 80 million users, were not enough that something else couldn't overcome it. And so we're just such an early days here that I actually think a lot of the network effects are going to be driven by the killer apps. And I think that you could certainly imagine a situation where there's a killer app that emerges on Solana.
01:07:06.806 - 01:07:40.712, Speaker A: Maybe it's visa because of stablecoin settlement. They said that they're playing on Solana now such that all of a sudden you get the next 100 million real users coming into that chain, and all of a sudden, the network effects of 25,000 developers on ETH and a couple billion dollars just gets overtaken in twelve months. I don't think that's out of the question here. It's part of what I think it was, maybe, Santiago, your original question, I think that's one of the really challenging things in investing in this space, is we're so early that the network effects, I think, as they are, I don't think they're insurmountable by any means. And so, you know, like, one thing, as you said earlier, I mean, first.
01:07:40.728 - 01:07:46.120, Speaker D: Of all, like, every blockchain has anti network effects. Perhaps Solana is the one that doesn't.
01:07:46.272 - 01:07:48.552, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, like, that's the thing.
01:07:48.568 - 01:08:08.510, Speaker D: Like, I think network effects are largely misunderstood here. And I think someone like Dydx, Antonio, will tell you very quickly, yeah, like, this is why we moved to Cosmos. Now, we haven't talked about Cosmos, but, yeah, to your point of view, like, where do you actually believe that we may achieve some degree of anti network, of network effects? Because every chain today has anti network effects.
01:08:08.622 - 01:08:11.478, Speaker A: Yeah. So I don't know, I kind of.
01:08:11.486 - 01:08:21.994, Speaker B: Think it's like, I dispute that, that it's not anti network effects. Right. It's bounded network effects. Bounded network effects. Right. Like, but that's true for Solana, too. If Solana gets, like.
01:08:24.334 - 01:08:37.206, Speaker C: To improve, Solana is going to need their version of 1559. They're going to end up needing Solana. L two. Like, this is gonna. I'm gonna, I'm gonna pull us forward. I'm gonna pull us forward into the next topic because we spent an hour on this already and it's actually a shit.
01:08:37.230 - 01:08:38.374, Speaker A: That was only one topic.
01:08:38.494 - 01:08:43.390, Speaker C: It's related, it's related to this, which.
01:08:43.422 - 01:08:58.694, Speaker B: Is, before we move on, just one thing I wanna close the loop on. I have it in front of me. The crack in confirmation times per chain. Tron. Ust on Tron is two minutes, Solana is two blocks. So basically, a second to get to have it show up in your kraken account.
01:08:59.954 - 01:09:33.573, Speaker C: Everyone thought this was going to be the cycle. This is the cycle where we put infrastructure behind us and we start talking about the big app and the consumer use case and millions of people. And here we are, and we just spent an hour talking about programming languages and the l one s again. So my question to you, maybe, Avitra, I'd throw this to you. Is this actually the cycle where we get the big use case and the big consumer thing, or is this one more cycle, which is probably actually totally fine. Maybe it's not fine, but is this one more cycle of infrastructure?
01:09:34.513 - 01:09:35.737, Speaker B: Just one more cycle, bro.
01:09:35.785 - 01:09:43.185, Speaker A: Just one more cycle. Just keeps pumping his monad bags. He's like, one more cycle with infrastructure.
01:09:43.329 - 01:09:49.766, Speaker B: Please, bro, just give me one more cycle. No, hold on.
01:09:49.870 - 01:10:10.394, Speaker D: Well, this is a relevant conversation because you guys spend a lot of time in Asia. The question is, are we going to, like, nervous type that didn't develop? That's expectation. But are we going to see actually some sort of regional fragmentation, or is this too low level infra that it doesn't matter and we're just going to have kind of this duopoly that you guys are both agreeing on?
01:10:11.294 - 01:10:13.514, Speaker B: No, basically no.
01:10:15.154 - 01:10:20.794, Speaker A: And why is that? The tech depth just isn't there to do the innovation that you need to really win at the base layer.
01:10:20.874 - 01:11:13.120, Speaker B: Yeah, look, I think if you're talking about ecosystems, definitely not. You can look at binance smart chain and say, okay, well, this is like the China emerging market binance distribution chain, which is true. Polygon has huge penetration in India and Indonesia. And so it is obviously the case that there are certain chains that have higher geographical penetration in certain places. But the idea that at equilibrium, we're going to have a chain for China that's written from the ground up to be for China, I think we're way past that being a possibility. I think that's obviously absurd and it's not going to happen. The question of will there be, within the EVM ecosystem, will there be a L2 or a roll up or application specific blockchain that is catered to a local application that's maybe in Malaysia, they have this hot app and they are like, oh, we're going to roll it on l two because it's too expensive for our users to be on main net or something.
01:11:13.120 - 01:11:28.600, Speaker B: Yeah, totally. That might happen. In a sense, that's what Binance merchant is. It's like, hey, binance has a lot of users that no one else has, and they're going to let them play in their little walled garden. That is absolutely going to be a thing. But is somebody going to rewrite from the ground up this new blockchain that's going to be for China?
01:11:28.672 - 01:11:49.334, Speaker C: No, Vic, let me alter my question a little bit, which is you guys sitting in the investment seat. No matter how good a consumer app is, most of them still don't have a token. So you guys aren't actually incentivized at this stage of where we're at in crypto to invest in that. So what gets us to, like, get over that infrastructure hump?
01:11:49.634 - 01:12:29.956, Speaker A: Uh, I actually think we are incentivized. Um, I think that it kind of goes back to this idea of what is the catalyst for this stuff actually working long term. And I think if, if we're like, in this constant cycle of let's build the next gen infrastructure, it just doesn't bring in enough people to actually use the thing. And until there's like, fundamental utility, this stuff doesn't work. And so in some sense, it's kind of like the bitcoiners went through this, I think, where you realize that if you just hold bitcoin, that's important, but there has to be lightning. You want the thing to have flow, there needs to be usage, there needs to be businesses integrating with it. You need to have square doing its thing.
01:12:29.956 - 01:13:03.330, Speaker A: And so this ecosystem matters. You need to incentivize the devs to keep working on it. You can't just have a chain that's dead because the core devs don't work on it. So almost from an ecosystem perspective, if you think of it as a portfolio, I think there's a strong argument that if investors are not investing in things beyond infrastructure, the infrastructure is useless. You have to be investing in the ecosystem. If only, and this is not the reason to do it, but I'm saying if only to make sure that your infrastructure investments are actually used, they have to be apps. Now, the way we think about it is actually beyond that, which is that the real end case here? The end state that we would like to get to is that people don't even mention the word crypto.
01:13:03.330 - 01:13:15.894, Speaker A: Right. It's just the way we don't mention the word mobile. You know, it's just, it's just an app. It's just, you solve a problem. I'm taking a photo. I need to, like, order groceries, I need to get a car. Like, you just think of the thing that you need to do, and some of those things will use cryptography.
01:13:15.894 - 01:13:50.398, Speaker A: Like, I think the solution to a lot of the AI deep fake stuff is a cryptographic solution. It's like the White House needs to attest that they're the ones who took this video. They need to publish that cryptographic signature somewhere into an open database that anybody can read from that cannot be corrupted easily based on some standard that everybody agrees to. Like, what do you know? Like, that's literally what we've created here, right? Or we have a portfolio company will never have a token. It's a company called Spruce. Spruce now powers the California DMV's app. So like your California DMV, your driver's license in the state of California on your phone is powered by Spruce.
01:13:50.398 - 01:14:42.674, Speaker A: Spruce originally started as sign in with Ethereum. So it's literally the same public private key cryptography ported for this government use case. And now your driver's license in California and actually another state is powered by that same technology, that's real utility. And so I think for this stuff as a technology to get out into the market, empower healthcare use cases and government use cases and real world use cases I think is really, really important. And then between that, between the infrastructure and these apps that will never have a token and may never even write out to a chain, there's this huge white space of stuff that's messy and in the middle. And so you look at something like an NFT marketplace and you say, well that trades nfTs, that kind of has some NFT l one stuff, maybe it could be its own l two, maybe it needs gas, maybe it doesn't. Should it have its own loyalty points? Should it have its own token? And so I think there's this like messy middle right now, especially around things like nfts creators social, um, which I think will probably have both.
01:14:42.674 - 01:15:13.330, Speaker A: I think it will have like an end user utility where people just want to use the thing for the thing, but it's going to be crypto native. It'll take advantage of things like cryptography, l one s gas, loyalty points, marketplace dynamics, bonding curves. Like there are these like really interesting innovations that will get baked into those applications. It won't, you won't call it a crypto application. It'll just be a marketplace that does a thing. And that middle ground I think is really interesting right now. I think it's probably possible that in this next cycle, two or three people kind of into some really interesting stuff there.
01:15:13.330 - 01:15:52.534, Speaker A: And so you're starting to see the very early beginnings of that. Like, so to me something like friend tech feels to me like the first sort of proto social network or farcaster working. It's starting to feel like, you know, we're in that like 2002 era of social. So this is even a little bit before my time at Stanford, but at Stanford there was a social network that was launched called Club Nexus. It was started by this guy Orkut. And then Orkut went on to work at Google and started the social network called Orkut that took off Orkut that took off in like Brazil and India, it was bigger than MySpace and Facebook in some of these markets for a long time, but they were sort of like proto networks. They didn't have like a newsfeed.
01:15:52.534 - 01:16:27.964, Speaker A: They didn't have like a lot of what we would look at as a social network today. And it took a couple of years of exploration. I think we're in that window now. I think, like somewhere in the next three years, somebody will figure out, like a social app, for example, that really takes advantage of the native social breakthroughs, the social innovations here. And that might be the thing that goes really viral or gaming, right? There's how many great teams that actually have gaming experience have now entered the space and have been hacking for the last two years. Like the last gen games that we had, they were fine, but they were kind of like the play to earn stuff. Most of it was because people were grinding to get tokens, not because they wanted to play the game.
01:16:27.964 - 01:17:12.072, Speaker A: And I think this cycle, you might actually get some games that are fun to play or, you know, nfts themselves. Like, you know, in this bear market, people, I don't know how closely people have been paying attention, but, like, Nike has been shipping, lvMh did a drop. Like, these big brands have been continuing to sort of push forward with their teams because the people who understand luxury goods and understand social signaling understand that this is actually digital social signaling. And that's a huge market. Like, literally the richest man in the world is Elon Musk, the second richest man in the world, Bernard Arnault runs lVMH, and their business model, if you look at it, is to take capital and to turn it into social capital. Like, that's literally when you buy a Louis Vuitton handbag, what are you doing? You're buying social capital. You're signaling to all the other primates that you have excess capital.
01:17:12.072 - 01:17:45.532, Speaker A: And that clearly has to be digital, right? And this is like a really deep, ingrained human behavior. And you know what it reminds me of is, like, in the early days of the Internet, there used to be these graphs that were like, amount of time spent on newspapers, amount of time spent on the Internet, dollars spent on newspapers, dollars spent on the Internet. And you're like, wait, that just has to fix itself. Like, the dollars have to go where the people are. And I think we're in a similar state right now with digital goods spending and luxury good spending. Like, all the luxury goods spending is offline and it has to move online. And NFTs are the vehicles to do that.
01:17:45.532 - 01:17:50.184, Speaker A: Like, right now, we can't see our shoes. Why does it make sense for me to buy $1,000 shoes? That makes no sense.
01:17:50.874 - 01:17:51.162, Speaker B: Right?
01:17:51.178 - 01:18:00.258, Speaker A: You can't see what's on my wrist. Like, it doesn't make sense for me to buy a $20,000 watch. All of that spending all those billions of dollars to spend, I think, move online. So I think we have these, like, categories.
01:18:00.346 - 01:18:02.374, Speaker B: Does that mean that you have a $20,000 hat?
01:18:03.634 - 01:18:10.946, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, but that's a really good insight, man.
01:18:10.970 - 01:18:11.650, Speaker B: You talk about watches.
01:18:11.682 - 01:18:12.466, Speaker D: I like watches, man.
01:18:12.490 - 01:18:14.414, Speaker A: We talk about, like, crypto people we can have.
01:18:16.054 - 01:18:16.438, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:18:16.486 - 01:18:17.434, Speaker D: I mean, probably.
01:18:18.814 - 01:18:47.854, Speaker A: Point being, though, I think, like, we have some really interesting candidates beyond the infrastructure now, whether it's social and sort of proto social networks, nfts as social networks, nfts for social signaling, you know, these other applications that may or may not actually have on chain influence, like, we're starting to, I think, see some proto applications here that I think could actually break out, and you only really need one of them. Like, you know, you get one or two, and all of a sudden, everybody will start copying it and mimicking and building on top of it, and you're off to the races.
01:18:49.314 - 01:19:04.986, Speaker B: I completely agree with you on the NFT side. I actually. I love the point you brought up about Elon Musk, which is that. Which is also. That just occurred to me. Is that, okay, richest man in the world, Elon Musk, second richest man, is the creator of LVMH. LVMH is doing NFT drops.
01:19:04.986 - 01:19:12.078, Speaker B: And surely he must recognize that the second richest man in the world must recognize that the richest man in the world does not wear LvMh.
01:19:12.246 - 01:19:14.190, Speaker A: Doesn't signal that way. Yeah, that's right.
01:19:14.222 - 01:19:23.094, Speaker B: Doesn't signal in the way that, like, the old world and like, the. That massive market into which he has locked in, elon Musk signals in a totally different kind of way.
01:19:23.174 - 01:19:23.550, Speaker A: Yep.
01:19:23.622 - 01:20:15.654, Speaker B: And that is much more the way that crypto natives signal and think about social status and value. And that's why I'm also bullish on nfts, and I think they will come back and continue metamorphosing. However, I am not bullish generally on crypto consumer and crypto social in a broader sense, nfts, I think I kind of bucket in more with financialization of status. And I think the further away you get into the outer reaches, farther away from money, the less crypto holds valence and the less power it really has to actually create new, more interesting products or things, the closer you are to that core. And I think nfts are actually still pretty close to that core of being about money and value and status. The more valence I think crypto has and the more power it has to have real staying power.
01:20:16.794 - 01:21:18.268, Speaker D: I think we always want validation into our interests. And if you're collecting art, wine, watches, whatever it is, or digital, translate that and include digital first, then it doesn't really matter you want validation. Crypto is a really good mechanism to find price discovery on these tail end of things, much better than the real world because you drive more liquidity. The question I ask is some music NFTs as an example, or games as we saw defi with the veneer, gaming, which was like farming yams was better than playing Axie. And no one can tell me otherwise because I had a lot of fun farming in defi summer until prices collapse or you had hacks. Nonetheless, are there instances where, as you talk about moving outside of these concentric circles, the closer are your financialization, the better? Are you guys not investing in things where you think that by introducing financialization or more of it in a more real time manner, it actually detracts from the user experience? Gaming is an example. If you're playing World of Warcraft, hey, maybe you played it and then you're like, whoa, I can actually sell these things.
01:21:18.268 - 01:21:49.194, Speaker D: But if it's constant real time, it's distracting, it's noise, and so it degrades from the user experience the same way that perhaps artists with music nfts realize, which is like, wait a minute, my fan base all of a sudden might call me because the price of the NFT collapsed 90%. That's not good because it introduces a vector that I don't like. So I am curious if you, if one your views on gaming, on music, and like some of these other things that are trying to overly perhaps financialize it and detract from the consumer experience.
01:21:50.174 - 01:22:42.080, Speaker B: Thoughts there, there are a lot of things in the range of human experience that shouldn't be intertwined with money. Like if you give me a gift and I give you back a gift, and I point out to you that like, well, my gift was worth slightly more than your gift, it somewhat destroys what we were doing with the gift giving, right? If I sit down with you and I'm like, hey, Santi, I know you're going through a tough time. I really want to support you. And look, you know, this means a lot to me because my time is extremely valuable. I make, you know, whatever huge amounts of money per hour and I'm foregoing that to spend this time with you, you kind of be like, wow, what a fucking dick. Like, that kind of ruined what I thought we were happening here. So even though these things might be facially true, it's actually important for a lot of the things that we do that they not be directly tied to money, because there are different kinds of things that we do as human beings that are not about money.
01:22:42.080 - 01:23:26.028, Speaker B: And I think it's obviously true that for a lot of games, it does cheapen the experience or contort the experience, distort the experience. If we start making something that's about me building a community and bettering myself and really building something and getting very excited about creativity with, well, how much more money am I making per hour if I keep leveling up my character or doing this or doing that? Actually, I don't want that to be the experience that I have when I'm playing elden ring or whatever. However, there are a lot of games that are some of the oldest games in history that are directly about money. Some of the most popular games in the world are games that people play mahjong. It's one of the most popular games in Asia. I'm in Asia right now. People play mahjong all day long, and mahjong is played for money.
01:23:26.028 - 01:23:58.704, Speaker B: People gamble over mahjong. People gamble over poker. They gamble over all sorts of games that have very, very deep valence. But the way in which the game is played and the kind of game that it is, is distorted by the gravitational field that money applies to what it touches. And so I think it requires some thoughtfulness in order to figure out how does a game interact with money in a way that makes both of them fun and doesn't cheapen the game and also doesn't kind of detract from the monetary game that is also happening underneath it. I think we're still very early in exploring that intersection of, if you think about it, poker. Poker.
01:23:58.704 - 01:24:20.488, Speaker B: Poker is a good game. I think, obviously, it's very popular. It continues to be popular. It's been popular for a very long time. There are very few games that have been invented in the last hundred years that are like poker. It's kind of strange that there's been so little kind of successful innovation in, you know, there are variations of poker, but they're all still, you know, 52 cards, people sitting around a table. There's nothing Internet native.
01:24:20.488 - 01:25:04.524, Speaker B: There's nothing like in a digital space. There's nothing like we haven't really figured out why is it there must be a richer intersection between money and risk and gaming and fun and worlds, and there must be more there than we've currently explored. And that's where I think the most fertile intersection of crypto and gaming probably lives. I don't think it's going to be, oh, well, your sword can be exported from this game to that game. That's a lot of what people talked about in V, one of when people thought about crypto and gaming. I think it's going to be something more complex than that, when crypto gaming really starts to work in a deep way. Until then, it's been a lot of just Ponzi schemes disguised as games where you work through the game in order to play the Ponzi scheme.
01:25:04.524 - 01:25:28.050, Speaker B: Ponzi schemes are fun. They're also one of the oldest forms of gaming in the world. Bubbles and Ponzi schemes are naturally, you could argue that's what a meme coin is. A meme coin is a bubble as a game. And we all play the game of, when do you get in the bubble? Did you pick the right bubble? Did you exit at the right time? It's a fun game, but it's a different kind of game than I think. What's going to end up working in the intersection of crypto and gaming?
01:25:28.162 - 01:25:55.944, Speaker A: Well, I will say I think that. So from an investment perspective, it's something we're very cognizant of. I think we don't want to create incentives for people to cheapen the thing. It has to be additive. I agree with a lot of what Hasee was saying, I think, though, and I also agree that I think the intersection of what crypto can do natively, and either games or nfts or social experiences, is very underexplored right now. And in part, it is actually going back to the infrastructure thing. I think the infrastructure just wasn't ready.
01:25:55.944 - 01:26:36.016, Speaker A: You couldn't actually have high throughput what DyDX had to do over the last two years to get to the app chain that they built. It just wasn't possible to do that in 2016, 2017. It took a lot of infrastructure building over the last five years to get to this point. And actually, if you look at the history of technology, people talk about these kind of like ten year cycles, and there's this turn of phrase. I think it might be a Bill Gates phrase that's people overestimate what's possible over two years and underestimate over ten. Going back to what you were saying before, Santi, and we're like, five years into the wave. Now, if you think about the 17 ICO bubble to now like five or six years in, and I think only now is the infrastructure gotten good enough.
01:26:36.016 - 01:27:35.626, Speaker A: Which is why I sort of think that if you think of these things on a roughly ten year cycle, somewhere over the next, like two or three years, somebody will stumble into some killer apps at the intersection of these things that will feel crypto native and really take advantage of the technology, because it's now possible to do that. Like, who was it the Xerox Parc guys that were doing the ZK game? Was that who that was? Was it Park Labs? Yeah. Like, that was a really early example of like, people trying to take ZK proofs and do something novel as a game with it. And I think we're going to see a lot more experimentation now that the tooling has actually gotten good and useful. And so we're just at the very beginning of that now. I think that the unfortunate reality is that when you hand a bunch of people technology and tooling, they will tap into these really negative, potentially negative feedback loops that exist in the human brain. And so you could certainly get people that build things that take advantage of these loops and are net negative, potentially net negative on society even, but are extremely addictive and have extremely good feedback loops.
01:27:35.626 - 01:28:16.332, Speaker A: I think as an investor, it's something we think about a lot. Are we actually building? You don't want to invest in a thing that you don't want to invest in a literal casino? We don't. At least what we want to do is invest in markets that are helping price discovery on real fundamental utility happening. We can get the capital markets all over the world to have access to a better financial product in the form of reinsurance. Now, the reinsurer, which is creating a really net productive thing in the GDP, can actually go like fund that activity with a lower cost of capital because there's all these people that will give them money at a lower cost because they don't otherwise have access to good financial products. That's a net positive use of capital on chain. But I think it's going to happen.
01:28:16.332 - 01:28:30.214, Speaker A: It's unfortunate, but it's inevitable. When you hand a bunch of people a bunch of technology, some of it is going to end up getting combined in a way that is going to take advantage of people, sort of exploit people. So I almost feel like the market level, that's unavoidable that that happens.
01:28:31.594 - 01:28:35.266, Speaker B: What do you have against casinos? What's wrong with casinos?
01:28:35.410 - 01:29:10.064, Speaker A: I think that, well, the challenge with casinos is that there's a good way to run it, and there's a not so great way to run it. The good way to run it is that it's kind of similar to the meme coin thing, which is like, if everybody knows the game that they're playing, it's all good. Like, we're all playing this game of money, chicken. I put in $50. Like, let's play chicken. And whoever takes the money out last loses, right? So the problem comes, I think, when. And it's a form of entertainment, right? And it's like, yeah, I was going to spend, like, I now have to spend $50 at the movies, you know, great, this is better.
01:29:10.064 - 01:30:08.608, Speaker A: The problem comes when you have a bunch of market participants that don't realize they're playing a game or are unable to play the game in a way that is net productive to their life. And that's the risk that you run when the motive for the existence of the entity is to create more money. Because the easiest path to creating more money is to take advantage of those people who are least likely able to understand that there's actually, there's a game and they shouldn't put all their money into the game because they're going to. It's like a net, it's a zero sum game. And that's where I think, like, bad actors can take advantage of that because there are a lot of people out there that don't understand what's happening. I mean, something I worry about, I was actually talking to a set of founders just yesterday about, you have to be really, you know, like one of the really interesting things with, with exchanges is the early people that come into this part of the market cycle often do understand that there's a game that's being played. A lot of people come in like, late cycle, don't understand the game that's being played.
01:30:08.608 - 01:30:53.534, Speaker A: But the saving grace often has been you've denominated these other games effectively. Like, if you think of meme coins as a game, that you've often denominated them in assets like BTC or ETH. And so you've inadvertently, when you take any profit or you've ended up with gas or dust or whatever, you've ended up with an asset that has actually store value kind of characteristics and has appreciated over time. And so the saving grace for a lot of people is they like, maybe they came for the game and then they ended up with a stack of chips at the end of it that was like, they're down 80%, and then they just ended up with some BTC, which when they looked back three years later, they're like, oh, whoa, I'm up on my bitcoin. Like, what happened? Right. And so there's this, like, weird saving grace where it's like a lot of people play the game. They don't realize they're playing the game, but then they end up getting their butts saved because the thing that they not the game that they were playing, but the other thing kind of saved their butt.
01:30:53.534 - 01:31:10.522, Speaker A: And that actually, I think, ended up saving the exchanges in a lot of ways because that prevented the exchanges from burning all their users out. Like, if you imagine a situation where, like, everybody plays the meme coin game and most people lose money because that's what's going to happen, you actually will just burn all your users. There's no reason for people to come back because they just lose faith in the whole system.
01:31:10.658 - 01:31:13.874, Speaker C: Haseeb, give me the counter on meme coins.
01:31:13.994 - 01:31:15.174, Speaker A: Are you pro meme coins?
01:31:16.554 - 01:32:00.540, Speaker B: Well, I've been thinking about a lot, because we've been digging into a lot of the data of what's happening on certain of these super high engagement chains. Like, if you look on Dex screener and you just look at where are most of the meme coins trading? The vast majority of them are on Solana. And that's actually where a lot of the retail engagement. You look at what are all the transactions in Solana? What are all these people doing? Mostly they're trading meme coins. And when I talk to people who are really young, one thing I always try to track is basically what's the current young person's hustle that they're sort of one step ahead of older, more esteemed people who have real careers, but they're making a lot of money. What's the thing that they're doing? Santee in 2020, it was Defi summer, and it was yield farming and all this other stuff. Then a year later, it was NFT trading.
01:32:00.540 - 01:32:23.604, Speaker B: Then there was airdrop farming, and thats getting competed out. And so now its trading meme coins. And theres just this insane churn of meme coins where basically every couple of days theres a new meme coin. And these guys who are 17 1819 who just are building up their bankroll, theyre trading meme coins. And theyre looking at the alpha and theyre looking at the signals. Theyre seeing which ones coming up when. And the turnover on these is crazy high.
01:32:23.604 - 01:32:46.784, Speaker B: If it has a hat, it has more longevity. Yes. Yeah, that's right. But what's interesting so the thing that I was asking myself looking at this, because I'm a fucking. An old fart and I don't do any of this shit. So I'm trying to philosophize about meme coins, obviously. So the question I'm asking myself is like, okay, this is the game.
01:32:46.784 - 01:33:12.034, Speaker B: This is the game on Solana. It's a game. Obviously, there are meme coins everywhere, but Solana seems to be where most of them today are getting launched. Like, people aren't launching them as much on Ethereum these days. And a large part of the reason why they're not is because Solana fees are so low. And so, you know, I was reading a Reddit post about this guy who deposited, like, he gave his little brother $10 to go trade on Solana. And his brother's made, like, all these trades, like, insane amount of meme coins he's going in and out of, and now he has $20.
01:33:12.034 - 01:33:20.328, Speaker B: It's like, wow, he turned $10.20. Like, that's. You know, people are. This is. This is the game on Solana. You can't do this on any other chain, right? You can't. You can't trade around $10 on any other chain.
01:33:20.328 - 01:33:56.464, Speaker B: So now the thing that I'm thinking about this game is that this game doesn't seem sustainable to have this high churn of meme coins. Now, why do I say that? The reason why I say that is, to Aviche's point, this is a game that's rigged against you. There was a story recently about Zack XBT talking a bunch of shit about meme coins, and people got mad at him. Normally, he's like the crypto Twitter hero, but then he kind of became the villain because people are like, oh, why are you shitting on meme coins? And the thing he said is like, look, most meme coins are rug pulls. And he's right. Is that anybody who's launching a fly by night meme coin overnight, they are giving themselves a little bit of supply pumping into meme coin. It dumps two days later, and they move on to the next one.
01:33:56.464 - 01:34:26.370, Speaker B: Everyone is fine with the creator of the meme coin basically taking a big tax in order for them to create the game. The next casino game that we're all going to play to basically do the next Ponzi or the next game of chicken, essentially, as you described it, Vichel. I think that's right. I think that's the right mental model for what meme coins are, is we're all kind of playing this game of chicken. There's a new round that starts every couple of days and you get to play the new meme coin. And then we all move on to the next one. And it's all a function of what's doing the most volume and where you think you are in the hype cycle for this new meme coin, if that's the game that's being played.
01:34:26.370 - 01:34:56.040, Speaker B: If you think about casinos, going back to casinos, slot machines are the most popular things in casinos. They make the most money by far. They're insanely profitable, and they are perhaps one of the most optimized computer programs in human existence. What they are optimized for is to maximally extract money from people over unit time. And how do you maximally extract money over unit time? Well, there's two things you're optimizing for. One is how much money you're getting per hour and churn. You're minimizing churn, maximizing money per hour.
01:34:56.040 - 01:35:25.520, Speaker B: And there's some complex function you're optimizing to make sure that you keep people there. You have the right variable ratio reward function, but you're not taking too much money. So they don't feel like they're losing enough bells and whistles in the meantime. Right? That is what meme coins should be doing if they want to be sustainable. They should be trying to optimize for long term longevity and minimizing churn. But obviously they're not going to do that because there's not a single actor in the meme coin game. There's all these different people launching meme coins and trying to get their meme coin to be front page so they can make some money from getting in and out of their own meme coin.
01:35:25.520 - 01:35:57.544, Speaker B: And so it's just going to be too extractive. People are going to lose too much money over a long enough period of time such that now, this is not true for meme coins with longevity. So I think Dogecoin has infinite longevity. People will be able to play that game forever because it's not extractive at all. There is nobody who's making money from you except maybe exchanges from you trading doge and maybe with dog with hat. There's nobody who's maybe making money from you at this point. But for this meme coin loop of, there's a new meme coin coming out every other day, this game doesn't feel like it's sustainable.
01:35:57.544 - 01:36:37.852, Speaker B: And I think this game, if you think about this kind of random walk of like what's the fashion that people are doing where before a year and a half ago, it was trading nfTs. There's a new NFT collection every single day that people were jumping in and out of, and now it's moved on to meme coins. The question I was asking myself is, is this going to stay? And the answer to my mind, if you look at this, is probably no. I think in two years, there will be a new thing that people will be doing that's not meme coins, because meme coins as they are made today is not sustainable. I think the big meme coins will survive, but this crazy rotation of meme coin into meme coin, I don't think this will be the thing that people are still doing in two years for that reason. That's my meme coin thesis. I was thinking about that a lot yesterday.
01:36:37.948 - 01:37:07.752, Speaker A: Yeah. I generally agree, though. I think these things will have a lot of longevity. I suspect it's not two years because I basically agree with the unit economic math there, which is Netflix burns people out and it's net extractive. But I think there's a lot more people who have not yet been burned. And so I think the size of the pool of people to come in to want to play the game is just so large that I suspect the meme coin.
01:37:07.888 - 01:37:19.804, Speaker C: But this isn't unique to this cycle. I mean, like 2021, I remember playing, I opted into the game like Goblin town NFT, or like Frank. Frank NFT. That. That's no, that was no different.
01:37:20.784 - 01:37:28.928, Speaker B: Won't be other bubbles. It's that the game will change. The meta will. Oh, yeah, yeah. It won't be meme coins anymore. Right? Last cycle, it wasn't meme coins. It was meme nfts, essentially.
01:37:28.976 - 01:37:29.160, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:37:29.192 - 01:37:31.632, Speaker A: Well, I mean, there's, like, still meme.
01:37:31.648 - 01:37:34.984, Speaker D: Cos it was like, what's a moon? Shiba moon?
01:37:35.064 - 01:37:35.724, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:37:38.144 - 01:38:15.214, Speaker D: No, no, let's just put in perspective, like, in terms of aggregate liquidity, volume, interest. Like, meme coins have all always been, like, at the center of every. Every cycle in crypto. Perhaps after you have, like, smart contracting platforms that enabled this stuff. But, like, the way I see it is you, like, you can invest in maker, which is probably the extreme of boring, not sexy, doesn't move, you know, but in the other extreme, like, meme coins and then, like. Or nfts that are, like, really cool, but not as illiquid. And so there's attacks that are coming in and out, and meme coins sit slightly more closer to nfts, which is.
01:38:15.214 - 01:38:40.236, Speaker D: And really financialize. And so it's fun. It has like emotional cache, but the deep liquidity that, like, perhaps an NFT is not going to have. So if you're going to buy something, probably it's going to be a meme coin, not necessarily an NFT because there's like unit bias and like 10,000 collections, like, tend to be really pricing out a bunch of people in the market, whereas you're not going to buy maker because maker is just the pet rock that doesn't move.
01:38:40.340 - 01:38:55.008, Speaker B: Yeah, I completely agree with you, but I don't think that the operating variable there is liquidity. I think it's volatility. Meme coins are super volatile. When people buy meme coins, what's their psychology? The answer to my mind is that they're buying lottery Tickets.
01:38:55.096 - 01:38:55.504, Speaker A: Yep.
01:38:55.584 - 01:39:28.674, Speaker B: And they see the Reddit post, they see the Twitter, but they see whatever. Like the friend of a friend of a friend who turned, you know, $1,000 into a million dollars. That is what keeps them playing and buying the next meme coin. To think maybe this one is going to be the next Shiba Inu or the next Dogecoin. And that dynamic could very easily move to something else, whatever is the next iteration. And maybe it's something that right now we can't quite imagine because maybe something we think is so stupid that why we want to imagine it. But that will be the thing that has this crazy volatility and the ups and downs and the mince the thousand x returns.
01:39:28.674 - 01:39:47.834, Speaker B: And then people will start doing that, even if it has terrible liquidity or if it has super bad slippage, they'll say, whatever. That's not why people are not buying lottery tickets. Based on their understanding of the payouts and the EV of doing that. They have no idea. Most people don't even check to see how much they're losing the average time they pull a slot machine. They just feel it over time through their own churn.
01:39:53.734 - 01:40:37.566, Speaker A: Yeah, I do think the only thing I would add there, I generally agree with a lot of that. I think the. Because I was also thinking about this this week is like. I think it's turned out to be the case that the saving grace has been that the base units of account of these things, which have been bitcoin and ETH historically have appreciated to such a degree that even if you lost a bunch of money on the meme coin side, you did okay. Because the base unit that you held has appreciated so significantly, which kept you in the game, which allowed you to sort of pay the tuition. It's almost like a tuition cost, a lot of people pay and then they realize the game that they're paying playing. And at some point I worry that that, like, that cycle can't hold anymore and that you, you can actually burn.
01:40:37.566 - 01:40:44.686, Speaker A: A lot of people who don't realize there's a game that's being played, that they're not playing a game, they think they're investing. And that's a, that's a real challenge.
01:40:44.710 - 01:40:46.514, Speaker C: I think I see it kind of differently.
01:40:47.854 - 01:41:20.242, Speaker D: Well, the worst game that was played was Terra disguised as a stable coin. People didn't know the game they were playing. The size of the door stayed the same. The number of people in the room increased by orders of magnitude. When I'm going to try to get out, it was a problem. And that has burned. And that's probably the biggest hurdle because if you go look at the, our Reddit forum, Wall street bets, people still talk about that and really burned, which leads us to we need to build a really beautiful consumer applications that are not as destructive as pure casinos to pull in these people in, hopefully this cycle.
01:41:20.378 - 01:41:21.534, Speaker A: Yeah, you had a thought.
01:41:21.874 - 01:41:56.682, Speaker C: I actually like Haseeb's framework for this, which is you can kind of opt in or opt out to these games. It's actually kind of how I think of casinos or, like Vegas, basically. Like, I'm not a regular of Vegas, but once in a blue moon, I like to go some friends to Vegas and I'm like, I know I'm going to lose a bunch of money, but I'm going to opt in for the entertainment, basically. And, like, that's how I treated honestly, like, the meme nfts in 2021. That's how I treat. Like, I was like, I'm not opting into these meme coins. And I saw, like, something like blur and I'm like, okay, let me, let me get a little, like, you know, shots of dopamine and me, like, let me play this game for a little bit because it's fun.
01:41:56.682 - 01:42:11.354, Speaker C: And then I see, like, some other ones. I'm like, I'm not opting into this just because I don't have the time or something. And I don't know, I actually kind of like, it's almost, it's like sports betting or casinos. It's like, yeah, I'll probably lose money on this, but, like, I don't know, it's kind of tokenized attention and tokenized.
01:42:11.434 - 01:42:33.376, Speaker A: Fun and, no, they definitely play a role. And I think it's, it's just entertainment and I think it's, we shouldn't police how people want to, like, spend their money in terms of entertainment. Um, it's just that I think that sort of as investors or as people who are trying to build the ecosystem, the only way to make it sustainable is to make sure that there's enough high utility. Like, if we ended up in a world where it's 100% meme coins, and that's the only thing that happens on Solana or Ethereum, it's over.
01:42:33.400 - 01:43:00.904, Speaker C: Like, what I think is really bad for the industry is when actually, folks maybe in, like, your guys's seat, like, some of the, like, leading investors or whatever you want to, you know, kind of title you want to put on you guys, like, there's some venture folks who are, like, people who are deemed by the crypto Twitter to be, like, the good investors in crypto are pumping these meme coins. Then they basically go from entertainment to retail, thinking they're a good investment, and that's when people get burned. So, yeah, haseeb, man, you came to this episode saying you're tired.
01:43:04.004 - 01:43:05.452, Speaker B: Vitriol just gets me going when we.
01:43:05.468 - 01:43:06.404, Speaker A: Start disagreeing on shit.
01:43:06.444 - 01:43:11.020, Speaker B: A couple of Solana. Yeah, actually, Solana. Solana.
01:43:11.052 - 01:43:11.624, Speaker A: Really?
01:43:15.704 - 01:43:33.760, Speaker B: Yeah. No, look, guys, I really enjoyed this conversation. I got to run soon. But, Santiago, I love your point about terra in that the thing that I got to give respect to meme coins on is that they are honest, and nobody goes into a meme coin thinking that they're making a sound financial investment. They know they're playing a game.
01:43:33.872 - 01:43:36.992, Speaker A: Oh, I totally disagree. I'm glad we're ending on a disagreement, haseeb.
01:43:37.128 - 01:44:05.030, Speaker B: Okay, good, good. But, like, I think people who are. I think people who are buying, uh, these meme coins, they understand that they're buying lottery tickets because they see the thing happening around them, and people come into casinos, and they also understand that they're, you know, they're. They're not going to be able to trick the slot machine, but they might think that they're going to win, and they might think they're lucky, and that's okay. That is entertainment. It's the oldest form of entertainment. Human beings have been doing this forever, and even when you make it illegal, they still do it, because this is.
01:44:05.030 - 01:44:35.752, Speaker B: This is just a lot of what drives our psychology, kind of. You can sort of backpropagate what makes humans have fun, and the answer is risk. Risk is one of those things for a lot of people, not everybody, but for a lot of people, that taps into the deepest form of engagement and excitement. And I think that's okay, as long as people know what they're doing. But tarot was not an example of that. And there are many cases where there are basically these kinds of games, of games of chicken that are disguised as something else, and I think those are very disruptive. And I think axie Infinity was one of these.
01:44:35.752 - 01:45:18.072, Speaker B: I think Tarot is one of these, and I think there are others that I'm sometimes in the habit of calling out. But at the end of the day, my issue with meme coins is not so much that they're bad for the world. I think they're fine as long as the people who are buying meme coins are the people who want to buy meme coins, but rather that, because, like I said, there aren't repeat players. It's a new guy every day launching the next meme coin. Um, it's better, I think, if you have repeat players, which I don't know how you do that, but maybe, you know, like fan coins or some of these other kinds of things are. Are more akin to that. Um, or, uh, no players at all, which is the case for something like Dogecoin or, uh, shiba Linu or some of these more like truly decentralized meme coins that are out there.
01:45:18.248 - 01:45:24.844, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that's a good stopping place. I have a feeling this won't be the last.
01:45:25.784 - 01:45:26.432, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:45:26.568 - 01:45:27.144, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:45:27.264 - 01:45:43.674, Speaker D: I suspect this episode is also going to be one of the most liked. So if I think there's so many things that we didn't get to cover that it was on my list, like bitcoin, l two activity bitcoin, you know, and so many other things that I want to get your thoughts on. Always a treat having guys on absence. Yeah.
01:45:44.014 - 01:45:44.302, Speaker B: Good.
01:45:44.318 - 01:45:45.470, Speaker D: See you guys. Thanks for coming on.
01:45:45.502 - 01:45:46.074, Speaker C: Yeah.
