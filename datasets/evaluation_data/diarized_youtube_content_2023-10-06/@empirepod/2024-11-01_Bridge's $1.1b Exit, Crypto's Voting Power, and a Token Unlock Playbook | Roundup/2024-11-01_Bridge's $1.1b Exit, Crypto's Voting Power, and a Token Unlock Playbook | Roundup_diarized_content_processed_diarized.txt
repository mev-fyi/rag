00:00:00.200 - 00:00:14.481, Speaker A: The reason it hasn't worked is not because it's stablecoins haven't worked or Stripe's not smart enough. There's a lot of inertia to getting a new thing done at a company and sometimes you have to make these really big bold like burn, burn the boats type of moves. As a founder, I feel like I.
00:00:14.513 - 00:00:21.885, Speaker B: Don'T want to touch something that doesn't capture and does fundamental value. I just. I'm sorry, but I don't feel comfortable owning it inside my portfolio.
00:00:22.905 - 00:00:44.077, Speaker C: Scale is the blockchain that is simply built different.

00:02:09.735 - 00:02:11.515, Speaker B: We're in the same city finally.
00:02:11.975 - 00:02:13.447, Speaker A: How's the New York trip?
00:02:13.591 - 00:02:14.663, Speaker B: Love it. Love this.
00:02:14.719 - 00:02:22.263, Speaker A: Oh man. Should we zoom in on how do we look at that. Look at that cleanly shaven man.
00:02:22.319 - 00:02:33.679, Speaker B: Everybody, this is as, as, as as probably. I did check fully. Yeah, that my barber back in back home, he just went at it.
00:02:33.807 - 00:02:35.031, Speaker A: Barber went butcher mode.
00:02:35.103 - 00:02:37.115, Speaker B: Yeah, he did really butcher me.
00:02:37.535 - 00:02:48.207, Speaker A: Anyways, I Don't know his butcher, but he. I mean, clean shaven, clean. Well, I guess if you're fundraising, you need to. It's like, you know, you come to New York, you look like the New York Yankees. Tighten it up a little bit.
00:02:48.351 - 00:02:52.703, Speaker B: Sorry for your loss yesterday, by the way, folks. You know, it was tough.
00:02:52.799 - 00:02:54.423, Speaker A: I'm a Red Sox fan, so I'm.
00:02:54.559 - 00:02:56.475, Speaker B: Oh, are you? Me too. Yeah.
00:02:56.555 - 00:02:58.699, Speaker A: Yeah. Why are you.
00:02:58.827 - 00:03:03.651, Speaker B: Because I went to school in Boston. I literally live like, I could see Fenway park from my house.
00:03:03.723 - 00:03:17.651, Speaker A: Nice, nice, nice, nice. Great Netflix show going on called the Comeback, which is about the Red Sox, Yankees and then the 2004 ALCS, which were. Red Sox were down three. Anyways, how's the fundraising trip? You're here to fundraise?
00:03:17.843 - 00:03:34.555, Speaker B: Well, I'm here to run the marathon on Sunday, but I did, I did get in earlier to just have a bunch of meetings and. Yes, fundraising meeting, potential hires, got office space yesterday, so very exciting stuff.
00:03:34.595 - 00:03:35.235, Speaker A: Let's go.
00:03:35.355 - 00:03:53.705, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. I mean, New York's such an important city. I think a lot of the team's going to be based here. Most of the strategy is going to be based in the US Just, you know, looking at targets. So that's all ongoing. It's just kind of paralyzing everything. So, yeah, incredibly busy, but very exciting.
00:03:53.705 - 00:03:57.345, Speaker B: The marathon at this point is an afterthought, to be honest.
00:03:57.965 - 00:04:19.101, Speaker A: Yeah, it's funny, last year I feel like everybody was really into the marathon and like run like training very hard. Um, like not just you, a lot of my friends and even people at Block Works. Like everyone's training really hard this year. Still the same amount of people running the marathon, but nobody's taking it that seriously. So I'm like, what does that say about society or where, where people are at, sir?
00:04:19.133 - 00:04:33.613, Speaker B: I mean, n of 10. So the data, the data sample is pretty small. I was thinking about tweet about this. I mean, just if you have the opportunity to run the New York Marathon, you should. It's like the best. I've done all the majors. I've done, God, so many marathons.
00:04:33.613 - 00:04:58.053, Speaker B: But I make a point to come here every year and run it because it's just amazing. Like Boston's great. Tokyo, Berlin, London, Chicago. Run a same sf, Mel. I've run a bunch. New York is just on a whole new level and I just love coming here because it's greatest city in the world and the experience is unparalleled. It's just unreal.
00:04:58.109 - 00:05:04.225, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Any interesting fundraising meetings or probably can't talk about them yet, can't talk about it.
00:05:04.605 - 00:05:29.619, Speaker B: But yeah, I mean, a lot of people have been reaching out, so I appreciate that. A lot of my time has been spent focusing on just dd, on potential targets. And I'm just like, my brain's there. Fundraising is like, I'll have some meetings here and there, but it's a lot of the people that I've worked with in the past I feel most comfortable going with initially. And it's very informal. It's just, you know, conversations. And, you know, of course, people seem to like the strategy.
00:05:29.619 - 00:05:37.751, Speaker B: It's. But until I close the fund, you know, I, as I tell people I'm either going to raise what I want or I'm going to raise zero and I'm going to put my money to.
00:05:37.783 - 00:05:39.775, Speaker A: Work and, you know, yeah, nice.
00:05:39.855 - 00:05:41.919, Speaker B: Live or die, but I'm gonna do it.
00:05:42.087 - 00:05:48.423, Speaker A: Target. Target goal of 1 billion. Yes. Cool. Four more.
00:05:48.559 - 00:06:02.173, Speaker B: I mean, the strategy is uncapped, but I do think as a first fund, it would be. As I've thought about it, I. I think that would be a sufficiently large fund to execute on the strategy and be dangerous.
00:06:02.319 - 00:06:02.889, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:06:03.017 - 00:06:04.409, Speaker B: In the good sense of the word.
00:06:04.577 - 00:06:23.165, Speaker A: So we, we interviewed last night Zach, who's the founder of Bridge Bridge XYZ, which just got acquired by Stripe, obviously for $1 billion. And we talked about the deal. It's the first public appearance. Let's go. La Colomb sponsor us, baby. We need.
00:06:23.825 - 00:06:24.529, Speaker B: This would be.
00:06:24.577 - 00:06:26.745, Speaker A: How many La Colomb's are you drinking a day these days?
00:06:26.865 - 00:06:32.169, Speaker B: Don't ask questions you don't want answers to, by the way. Also, this would be. La Colomb would be a reason to move back to New York.
00:06:32.217 - 00:06:53.659, Speaker A: So La Colomb, if you are out there, could use a sponsor. Yeah, for sure. Actually, we get roasted for having too many sponsors on the show. But, yeah, we had Zach. Yeah, we had Zach on the pod. It was so. It was the first public appearance that he's done about the Stripe acquisition.
00:06:53.659 - 00:07:39.235, Speaker A: So the deal hasn't actually closed. It's with Lina Khan and the regulators right now. But we talked about the acquisition, but I mean, the show ended up basically turning into a pitch for Inversion Capital. It was really an amazing. I've heard your pitch obviously for it, but it was amazing to have that in my head and then hear him outline the benefits that stablecoins actually bring to the market and actually can bring to these legacy companies. And he walked us through a couple of examples and whether it's treasury management or payroll or I Think the most exciting thing that he talked about is like, look, we're kind of doing what happened with the Internet and with the iPhone, which is like you just apply it to these old use cases. But like the new use cases, the really crazy cool stuff hasn't even come yet.
00:07:39.235 - 00:07:43.919, Speaker A: So anyways, just a really good episode that'll be out on Tuesday, folks.
00:07:44.047 - 00:08:08.769, Speaker B: People should definitely. It's one of the more invigorating kind of energizing conversations of course, because I'm thinking like breathing this constantly. But I go back to like the early days of like DeFi. Like stablecoins are just the minute you use them, people talk about it. It's a Trojan horse, it's a killer use case. It is just such a powerful thing. Like if we just stopped innovating and that was, that was it.
00:08:08.769 - 00:09:12.975, Speaker B: It was, it's just an amazing use case. Anyone that's traveled, anyone that has done cross border payments, anyone that has a company that does international, like, you know, basically international really, really appreciates that. One of the things that Sack said that I really liked was how he described the current financial system, which is a lot of fintechs, including Stripe or Square where he was at previously, or Brax, some of these like, you know, fintechs that have, he said they've innovated on the margin, which is I took to mean, you know, the current financial system is very antiquated and you can only do so much. Like we've sort of like hit a limitation point at which like even Stripe, as I think about why they acquired Bridges, they sort of realized like you can only innovate so much with a patchwork of antiquated systems. The next level of growth, the future is really, you know, operating in these permissionless ledgers. And it's like from scratch, right? It's just. And stablecoins really are that.
00:09:12.975 - 00:10:05.153, Speaker B: And I think that's why, you know, if you were to ask, you asked him some great questions around, why would stripe acquire them versus bill them? They just launched 18 months ago, like, you know, Stripes. A really good, competent team. They could have done this themselves. But I think Stripe just sort of woke up one day and the Carlson brothers are incredibly smart in this way and they've been talking about stablecoins and I think they just realized like three years ago, probably too early today they woke up and they, they felt a sense of urgency because Bridge has gotten so much traction so quickly. And Zach was just describing how many of the developers were just innovating and pushing them, doing all these crazy Use cases that I think Stripe saw through that and felt this kind of woke up one day and said, felt this sense of urgency and was like, we need to get this now, otherwise we're going to lose a very big competitive advantage that they have already.
00:10:05.329 - 00:10:41.505, Speaker A: So Stripe has actually tried to do things with stablecoins twice in the past and both times it hasn't worked out. And the reason, from my understanding and talking to friends at Stripe and stuff like that, the reason it hasn't worked is not because it's stablecoins haven't worked or Stripe's not smart enough. There's a lot of inertia to getting a new thing done at a company and sometimes you have to make these really big, bold, burn the boats type of moves. As a founder, I feel like. And this to me was the Collison brothers doing that. They said you never talk about how they overpaid and stuff like that. First off, I don't think they overpaid.
00:10:42.325 - 00:10:47.653, Speaker B: I think this is like an Instagram meta acquisition where in the future we'll look back and this is incredibly cheap.
00:10:47.789 - 00:11:19.035, Speaker A: But I think the big reason why they did it was because I heard the way that the deal went was there was a deal team and they had the DCF and they're building these models and Patrick said, fuck your models. We're paying a billion dollars for this company or whatever the real amount was 700 million or 1.1 whatever. We're paying a large amount that nobody on the M and A team thinks makes sense. We're getting this deal done. I've got voting shares, push this thing through. And you know, for him, I mean, that's just rumors of what I kind of heard.
00:11:19.035 - 00:11:43.401, Speaker A: But for him to do something like that, the reason I think that he did it is to plant their flag in stablecoins. You get this huge press release, big announcement, Stripe is here to play in the stablecoin space. And I think it's a. I think it's a brilliant acquisition. I think it's. Bridge has these low level APIs. Zach talked about this on the episode, but they haven't really created APIs for one use case they've done.
00:11:43.401 - 00:11:48.965, Speaker A: It's the exact same way that Patrick and John talk about their business. And I just like it a lot.
00:11:49.265 - 00:12:47.831, Speaker B: Yeah, a lot of what I. To your point, around inertia, I've been spending a lot of time talking to the implementation partners, the tech stack, a lot of which I've invested in, but also that I'm going to implement in the first Hundred days kind of playbook. And it's just really interesting to hear and go deeper into why we haven't seen as much of an adoption. Makes you wonder, was the timing off? Is the tech not ready? Is there just where is this lack of appetite to. Because we know clearly it works. It's just wise. And one of the things that I've heard kind of over and over is most businesses, especially if you're doing B2B, B2B or B2C, is this idea that merchants are very sensitive and unwilling to risk they'd rather pay 4 or 5% even more to than add any amount of friction into the checkout process, into the equation.
00:12:47.831 - 00:13:50.085, Speaker B: Right. But I guess the point that I'm trying to make here is why now? Because there have been very, over the last year, I'd say, very important innovations that have facilitated and just made the UI UX incredibly seamless. That I would challenge people and say, and go as far as to say, if you look at Blackbird for instance, and their pay flow, it's just actually on par or easier than traditional payment methods if you are using PayPal. And a lot of that's counter abstraction, gasless transaction, batching, all these things really do matter. And I don't think we could have, you know, I don't think three years ago it was very different experience is what I'm trying to say. And a lot of times in crypto, people, you know, people don't come back, people don't revisit the thesis, people don't, you know, or sort of have this idea of what crypto is and you just have to, you know, keep hacking away and just, you know, I do think that when stripe, with the muscle and the distribution of stripe, just totally different game because Zach was describing this friction. Right.
00:13:50.085 - 00:13:55.605, Speaker B: So it's really incredibly exciting to see how that plays out.
00:13:57.105 - 00:14:19.249, Speaker A: Very much so. All right, Few other few news stories I wanted to get to in this roundup. So one was Coinbase. Coinbase had earnings and the market reacted pretty poorly. And I want to make the argument that that was just a really overblown reaction. I very much disagree with it. Celestia Unlocks happened this week and it was one of the biggest unlocks in the space in a couple of years.
00:14:19.249 - 00:14:54.319, Speaker A: And so I think just the celestial unlock is less interesting, but more interesting to talk about these, you know, what was the market reaction? How will the market react to two other unlocks? There was a big poly. The market thought it was a big poly market story. I think it's A total nothing burger of a story. But there was a wash trading story about Poly Market and then there were actually a couple of layoffs this week. So maybe we can start with the layoffs. So this week dydx, Consensus and Kraken all publicly announced layoffs. There are a couple other more quietly announced, quietly done layoffs that have not been publicly announced yet.
00:14:54.319 - 00:15:28.565, Speaker A: But DYDX CEO Antonio Giuliano said that 35% of the core team was let go. Consensus CEO Joe Lubin said consensus had cut 20% of the staff. That is 160 positions at consensus. That is, let's see for DX I think it's about, I think that probably 50 folks, I think that's about 10 people. And then Kraken also had layoffs. So Kraken announced a new co CEO. What is his name again? Arjun Sethi.
00:15:28.565 - 00:16:00.783, Speaker A: He was at Tribe Capital, I'm pretty sure before. I think he's also one of the largest independent shareholders of Kraken. I think don't quote me on that. And yeah, they cracking head layoffs as well. So laid off somewhere between 15 and 20% of the company. So this is interesting, right because it gets to this idea of are we in a bull market? Are we in a bear market? David and I were, David Hoffman and I were debating on stage at Permissionless. He said we're in a bear market.
00:16:00.783 - 00:16:03.559, Speaker A: I said there's no possible way we're in a bear market. Bitcoin.
00:16:03.647 - 00:16:04.975, Speaker B: Bitcoin hit all time high this week.
00:16:05.015 - 00:16:24.579, Speaker A: Bitcoin hit all time highs. It's just that eth is not moving. I'm sorry David. So it kind of gets to this question. I think that this is interesting for two reasons. One is actually really, really one thing. First off, I don't think we're in a bear market.
00:16:24.579 - 00:16:50.141, Speaker A: I think we're in a bull market. Bitcoin's about to hit an all time high. Other things are hitting all time highs. You're just seeing a bigger dispersion than we've ever seen in the industry between things that go up and things that go down. The really interesting thing was actually one line that Joe Lubin said and then Antonio said a very similar thing. So he put a little bit of blame on the sec. He said look, with the government coming down on us, such a tax, this is a quote.
00:16:50.141 - 00:17:37.955, Speaker A: Such attacks from the US government will end up costing many companies that have been investigated, sued or sent wells notices many millions of dollars. But there was an interesting line here that I'm starting to see in telegram Chats with founders and group chats that I'm in with different founders. This is a quote from Joe Lubin. He said, looking ahead, I see a next generation not dominated by large monolithic companies. Instead, smaller, agile, AI supercharged companies with Web3 based coordination tools will operate more efficiently. To stay competitive in this fast growing space, we need to reshape ourselves and be more agile, more effective, even higher performing. It's very related to something that Antonio talked about if anyone listened to the D IDX episode and he posted in his blog post about this.
00:17:37.955 - 00:18:09.871, Speaker A: He said DYDX is moving to a model that has flat hierarchy, less meetings, no management structure. And actually, Zach brought it up on the Bridge podcast too. He said, look, we've got about 50 employees today. We have zero managers, we have zero management at the company. It's a very different way of, of building a company. And it's, I mean, the thing that kind of took the Internet by storm, at least in the tech world, probably six weeks ago or four weeks ago, was, was this, you know, founder mode, right. Paul Graham wrote about it, but really it came from Brian Chesky.
00:18:09.871 - 00:18:50.307, Speaker A: And so I just think that this, I mean, it's something that is quietly behind the scenes being talked about in every single founder group chat I'm in. Because people are building their hiring strategies for next year, right? They're talking about, you know, people owe their budgets to the board, they owe hiring strategies to the team. People are doing their financial reviews and people are wondering how many, what really is the benefit to just layering on more and more and more people at these companies instead of staying really agile and just saying, how can we get more efficient? More efficient, more efficient. So, yeah, I'm curious if you have any thoughts on this.
00:18:50.491 - 00:19:50.681, Speaker B: Oh, that's well put. I think I'll just add Gary Tan, who is the president of Y Combinator, had a few interesting tweets that I saw a couple weeks ago which talked about the cohort, the new cohort, the batch of Y Combinator, and how they were really just even leaner and meaner because they were leveraging a lot of tools, like particularly AI, that allowed them to just not hire as many people. There was also a tweet, I don't know how much lend as much credence to it or not, but I found it interesting, which is a lot of these companies are building a lot of these solutions in house using AI tools and ripping and kind of replacing existing SaaS solutions. I don't know how much of that is true. It's Something that is worthy just to pay attention to. I think about it a lot as well in terms of these transformations, like how much can you replace your CRM, your workforce, management? These are large companies that historically have been very much embedded into pretty much every organization. The penetration rate is still quite low.
00:19:50.681 - 00:20:30.019, Speaker B: A lot of businesses, particularly medium sized, don't really adopt technology and especially family owned businesses. But now you can do a lot with just build a lot of these solutions in house with like, you know, a lot of stuff that's open source. Right. So I don't have as much of a kind of really good assumption, like view into how real or how, how much of that's actually happening in practice, but it's definitely interesting. You know, it's kind of like the McKinsey reports that everyone's talked about or these consultants that say, hey, look, it's going to be a massive transformation in label labor market over the next decade with AI. Right. So maybe that's part of that.
00:20:30.147 - 00:20:31.515, Speaker A: 100%. 100%.
00:20:31.635 - 00:20:56.643, Speaker B: Antonio, I was thinking about what Musk did at Twitter. He went in, just fired a lot of the organization and you know, it's like, Twitter still works. It's actually a better product. So it's like how much of these companies are actually bloated just because most companies I just think are bloated or, you know, and so you go in there and just. I think Antonio, that's probably what he saw, right? Taking Moss Playbook.
00:20:56.819 - 00:21:40.697, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's just gonna, I mean, it's gonna be really interesting to see what ends up happening as these, I think, as. I think this strategy will end up mostly working. Mostly working, I would say. And I'm not sure it's going to be the consensuses of the world who lay off 20% of their people and still have a thousand employees and it makes them much better because it's like there's a lot of, again, like the stripe example, there's a lot of inertia inside of these companies. What I'm really excited to see is the, the new founders who come in and build these companies and just don't end up hiring people. They just get better and better and better at using AI.
00:21:40.841 - 00:21:42.777, Speaker B: So. Yep, absolutely.
00:21:42.921 - 00:21:57.885, Speaker A: Yeah, Yeah. I don't know. It's something we're, I'm, we're thinking a lot about it at Blockworks, right. Because we, we create so much content. So it's like, what is, what, what is the role of AI there? So I don't know. All right. Coinbase earnings.
00:21:58.205 - 00:21:58.869, Speaker B: Yes.
00:21:58.997 - 00:22:00.221, Speaker A: Did you take a look.
00:22:00.413 - 00:22:02.745, Speaker B: Of course. Last, last night, yeah.
00:22:03.525 - 00:22:07.625, Speaker A: All right, Coinbase announced earnings. Let me see if I can pull up a little summary tweet here.
00:22:09.125 - 00:22:11.933, Speaker B: They don't set a fair buyback, but yeah, go for it. This is.
00:22:11.989 - 00:22:26.611, Speaker A: Yeah. So Ryan Rasmussen, who's head of research at Bitwise, just put out a good summary tweet. Coinbase Q3, 2024 earnings. All right. Revenue came in at 1.2 billion. This is down 17% versus Q2.
00:22:26.611 - 00:22:53.581, Speaker A: Net income of 75 million which is up over 100% versus last quarter adjusted EBITDA 449 million down 25%. Cash is up to 8.2 billion which is up 5%. I don't think it shows it in here, but about 25% of their balance sheet is now in or I think it's 25% of their cash is now in crypto. Not, not in fiat. They did a. They authorized $1 billion share repurchase.
00:22:53.581 - 00:23:11.535, Speaker A: Base transactions are up 55% versus Q2. And then front and center in this PDF in this image that they always released. They're now 1.8 million people. Advocates of stand with crypto. The market didn't like it. They didn't like seeing.
00:23:11.535 - 00:23:15.336, Speaker A: Here I can just pull up the stock's at 201.
00:23:15.401 - 00:23:19.415, Speaker B: Market just open now, but it was down 5% after earnings.
00:23:20.805 - 00:23:38.525, Speaker A: The news stories, Coinbase shares fall as muted crypto trading leads to third quarter miss. Coinbase stock falls on earnings. Ms. Coinbase revenue may be hurt by lower trading volumes and regulation. Coinbase stock dives on earning miss. So that was the analyst, that was the streets reaction.
00:23:38.645 - 00:23:51.453, Speaker B: Yeah, I saw one of the JP Morgan analysts updated his model last week ahead of earnings and like the price Target was like 191 this time. Talks at 200 now it's up 16% year to date. Yeah, it's sort of a tale of two cities.
00:23:51.509 - 00:23:51.653, Speaker A: Right.
00:23:51.669 - 00:24:02.501, Speaker B: It's always interesting how the market responds to this and you know, but, but I, I do think that. Yeah, I mean the share buyback's pretty encouraging, I'd say.
00:24:02.533 - 00:24:09.705, Speaker A: Yeah. What are your. Do you have general thought? I mean I know long term thesis on Coinbase, but any, any updated thoughts on this?
00:24:10.445 - 00:24:12.685, Speaker B: On the particular earnings report?
00:24:12.845 - 00:24:15.557, Speaker A: Yeah, on earnings or like current thoughts on Coinbase?
00:24:15.741 - 00:24:45.511, Speaker B: Can we quickly just z the earnings call around what was the commentary on base? Because base has been seeing incredible amount of growth and we can maybe link some of the stats, but usage is up. I think revenue price sequencing. Revenue has also gone up substantially. I mean it's becoming a non trivial component of their, of their P and L. Yeah, and earnings I'd say. So let's just look at that for a minute. And also in the while you do that, I'm going to try to look at what was the commentary from the management team on it.
00:24:45.623 - 00:25:14.487, Speaker A: Yeah, so I just pulled up our dashboard on base. I mean you can see transaction count, you can see addresses, you can, you can look at their financials. I mean let's see the key numbers that they put out for base was 2.5 billion in TVL2 time 2x. The growth on new contracts deployed quarter over quarter up 55% increase in base transactions quarter over quarter. I don't know if they put the revenue in there.
00:25:14.631 - 00:25:47.855, Speaker B: Other Transaction revenue was 34 million in Q3 down 35% quarter over quarter. Primarily driven by lower base sequencer fee revenue. The number of transactions on base increased 55% quarter over quarter as users and developers took advantage of lower fees. Medium fees in Q3 were less than 0.01, so that's a cent. We believe that more developers would choose to build their products on base as the cost to transact becomes lower. This quarter we saw developer engagement continue to increase and the number of new contracts deployed more than doubled from Q2.
00:25:47.855 - 00:26:17.783, Speaker B: So that was their commentary on base subscription revenues which is something that is also interesting. Has been going, you know, becoming a non trivial component as well. That was came in at 556 million down 7% quarter over quarter. They were pleased with the results even though it was slightly down. What else Stablecoin revenue which is also pretty substantial. 247 million up 3% quarter over quarter. This is something that we, you know, would be interesting to see.
00:26:17.783 - 00:26:35.229, Speaker B: We've talked about extensively during the pod. You know every exchange is going to launch stablecoin. Every perhaps application, you know, even in the episode with Sack yesterday is going to launch our stablecoin. What does that do to USDC and their. And the stablecoin revenue for Coinbase. Right. They talk about here primarily.
00:26:35.229 - 00:26:50.229, Speaker B: So stablecoin revenue 247 million up 3%. The primary drivers of growth were higher average USDC on platform balances. That's interesting. Grew. That grew 7% quarter over quarter. 6.6 billion in stablecoin balances on the platform.
00:26:50.229 - 00:27:12.541, Speaker B: So you know, potentially that money flows into crypto, you know, as more risk on appetite post election kind of thing. Be interesting to track how that 6.6 evolves over time. Higher average USDC market cap grew 5% quarter over quarter that's also interesting. Those drivers were partially offset by lower effective interest rate. So that makes sense. Or rate cuts.
00:27:12.541 - 00:27:31.545, Speaker B: So we understand that. So at the end of Q3 they had 8.1 billion in on platform USDC balances. That is 8.1 billion on the platform. That's pretty good. USDC market cap reached 36 billion, the highest total since early 2023.
00:27:31.545 - 00:27:45.565, Speaker B: Year to date, USDC has been the fastest growing major USD stablecoin. Our platform incentives, combined with deeper integration of USCC across our products has been contributors to both market cap and on platform balance growth.
00:27:47.225 - 00:27:52.645, Speaker A: All right, can I give you my take on all this? Auntie, I think everybody is. Oh yeah, yeah, go, go ahead.
00:27:53.465 - 00:27:57.965, Speaker B: No, do it. I'm gonna read through it and just give the skinny to people. But please give us your take.
00:27:58.405 - 00:28:19.225, Speaker A: I mean, I think everybody's mid curving the hell out of this. Everybody. This whole Coinbase earnings call is overblown. The people don't trade in the summer, people don't. You people don't trade in the summer. And people, I mean people don't trade when the market's just in this consolidating period. So you combine the summer with this kind of crypto choppiness.
00:28:19.225 - 00:28:55.494, Speaker A: Coinbase also hasn't had many memes on the platform. This is just a really overblown earnings call. I think next year Coinbase is going to have a monster year. When you think about where Coinbase sits in relation to the entire market, I mean if you're bullish crypto, you gotta be bullish Coinbase right now it feels. What's the market cap? Market cap is 50 ish, I want to say. Yeah, okay, it's sitting exactly. Yeah, it's at 51 today.
00:28:55.494 - 00:29:18.835, Speaker A: Yeah. You're looking at $50 billion market cap for the best public company and the fastest. They're two of the fastest growing industries in the world. It's AI and crypto and Coinbase is the leading company. It's just, I mean I own Coinbase on bias, but it just feels extremely cheap. And then, I mean, congrats to Jesse and the whole base team. Like they had insane growth.
00:29:18.835 - 00:29:33.201, Speaker A: Easily the, I'd call them the winning L2 of the year so far. Yeah, I just think, I just think they've had like, I don't know, feels, feels like a very mid curve take to be selling Coinbase right here.
00:29:33.353 - 00:29:59.811, Speaker B: The market's always played the short term game. A couple more interesting salient points from the earnings call. Stablecoin volume. This is USDC and all combined reached 22 trillion year to date, more than doubling year over year. Okay, we talked about USDC market cap also growing 11% fastest growing USD stablecoin. Another interesting thing. Obviously Coinbase rolled out CB BTC.
00:29:59.811 - 00:30:39.237, Speaker B: That will also be interesting to track as more activity in the Bitcoin network, particularly in Defi and other on chain applications grows. There's a whole host of L2 side chains that are picking up steam from Babylon to Arch and a few others we found in the podium. Also probably capitalizing on WBDC's just kind of what I would call fumble. Your point around base is correct. Base is now the number one L2 in both transactions in total TVL that grew 55% quarter over quarter surpassing all other L2s and four times higher than Ethereum. That's the L1 over the last 30 days. Yeah, I agree with you.
00:30:39.237 - 00:31:15.655, Speaker B: I mean ultimately I think people are just coy and waiting for the election result and litigation is ongoing, so that continues to be a sticking point. But encouragingly the analysts keep it at neutral and I think this tells you the market sentiment towards crypto. Maybe this is a good transition into ETF flows because that's also been something that people have been paying attention. There was a lot of ETF flows yesterday. It's a tale of two cities. You have Bitcoin having record inflows, Ethereum basically getting zero. So there's also filings by Cayman Capital and a few other folks.
00:31:15.655 - 00:31:43.077, Speaker B: I mean on the Salana etf, bitwise I think in great, I believe it was. Bitcoin continues to have, you know, just changes to their registrations on other ETF products like with Ripple and a few others like this is over the last couple of weeks that I've just observed. So yeah, we'll see the all eyes on the, on the election. I don't think the market both with Coinbase and just generally is going to do much. There might be some volume, but I think people just on the sidelines like yeah, waiting.
00:31:43.221 - 00:32:10.955, Speaker A: By the way, I mean great point on the ETFs if people miss this. BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF had its largest ever inflow day in history yesterday. 875 million in a single day. Which means the Bitcoin ETFs took in more over the past two days, Tuesday and Wednesday than the Gold ETF took in during its entire first year. So yeah, just tough not to be excited about this going into the election.
00:32:12.055 - 00:32:15.635, Speaker B: MicroStrategy announced also some purchases.
00:32:16.575 - 00:32:45.191, Speaker A: Yeah, they announced. Oh God, what was it? I think saylor announced plans to buy $42 billion worth of Bitcoin over the next three years. For context, 42 billion is about double the amount that all of the ETFs have brought in so far since launch. Let me fact check myself on that. Yeah, raising 42 billion to buy. Yeah, more Bitcoin. So yeah, 42 billion over the next three years.
00:32:45.263 - 00:32:53.887, Speaker B: JP Morgan update on the Coinbase. Very timely. Thank you. Kenneth Worthington, who was the analyst over there. They kept their price target the same.
00:32:54.071 - 00:32:55.415, Speaker A: Kenneth Worthington.
00:32:55.575 - 00:32:56.791, Speaker B: Yeah, Kenneth Worthington.
00:32:56.863 - 00:33:01.605, Speaker A: That is just a a chad analyst name if I've ever heard it.
00:33:03.665 - 00:33:17.565, Speaker B: Their summary was Q3 2024. Results fall short of expectations, but Coin continues to execute on its longer term plan. Potentially more friendly regulatory environment on the horizon. That'll be nice.
00:33:19.505 - 00:33:48.279, Speaker C: Scale is the blockchain that is simply built different. Let's face it, other L1 networks have costly transaction fees that increase as the network gets busier. Skale has solved this problem with a GAS free scalable infrastructure where users never pay gas fees.

00:36:21.365 - 00:36:36.615, Speaker A: Let's talk election because I feel like we've done a pretty good job of not talking about the election so far on the roundup, but there's a, there's a so here. First let's pull up Poly Market. Let's see where the odds are sitting.
00:36:37.075 - 00:36:44.425, Speaker B: All right, 66 for Trump. Last check Camelot 30 something 33:65 verse.
00:36:44.554 - 00:37:45.655, Speaker A: 35 all right, so Fortune did a big piece. Who is the Leo Schwartz at Fortune wrote this piece. Exclusive election betting site Polymarket gives Trump a 67% chance of winning but is rife with fake wash trading researchers say the researchers in this case were Chaos Labs who I know you're an investor in. They run by Omar, they do great work and then Inka Digital. So Chaos. I'll read a snippet of this Chaos Labs separate analysis by both firms said said that there was a false impression of volume and activity. Chaos Labs found that Wash trading constituted around one third of the trading volume on Poly Markets Presidential market, while Inca Digital found that a significant portion of the volume on the market could be attributed to potential Wash trading.
00:37:45.655 - 00:37:52.191, Speaker A: What are your thoughts on this on this report on this thing?
00:37:52.323 - 00:38:28.133, Speaker B: I'll caveat and preface that I'm both an investor in Chaos Labs and I led one of the earliest rounds in Polymarket and Paraphi is one of if not the largest holder of Polymarket. And I have vested interest in both. So that is bias and disclosures out of the way. There's two arguments. One is people in crypto are more inclined and kind of are expressing their views not rationally, but just their desire, so to speak, for Trump to win is know. But the other counterargument to that is, well, but they're also rational investors. Like, they're not going to lose money and there's an arbitrage potential opportunity if the market's off.
00:38:28.133 - 00:38:52.409, Speaker B: Right. So I'm not, I'm not really sure how to explain it. Like, there is a big delta between these markets. You would think that there shouldn't. And this delta, as I understood it, like it was very tight, tightly correlated. Like the spread between predicted Robinhood, some of the others, and Poly Market was not far off, but it has just recently really blown out of proportion.
00:38:52.577 - 00:39:23.405, Speaker A: First of all, I love the, that reporters are starting to work more with like the Chaos Labs is and these data providers. I think that's a really cool thing. I really didn't like the framing of this article because the title says Poly Market gives Trump a 67% chance of winning. So it's about these odds, but is rife with fake wash trading. So what you're doing there is you're saying the wash trading is making the odds skewed. And there's a really. But that, that's not actually how wash trading works.
00:39:23.405 - 00:39:57.921, Speaker A: Wash trading shouldn't impact prices very much. Right. Wash trading can create false market perceptions. Like the volumes can be wrong, but that doesn't necessarily mean price manipulation. So I think I just, Yeah, I don't like saying that. What this is, the title implies that wash trading has created price manipulation, leading to Trump having this 67 chance of winning on Poly Market. It later in the article down the article, the author acknowledges that, you know, that that's not how wash trading works.
00:39:57.921 - 00:40:12.485, Speaker A: It doesn't actually change the. Usually it doesn't manipulate the price or the odds here. But again, like, I, I don't think anyone's reading this article. It's behind a paywall you have to pay for Fortune. Like, no, nobody read this article, so they just see the headline.
00:40:12.605 - 00:40:19.865, Speaker B: A lot of these are woke, you know, publications. So, yeah, New York Times, Fortune, they all skew, you know, Democrat, I believe.
00:40:20.445 - 00:40:44.743, Speaker A: So I like the, I like the premise of doing investigative journal. I like, I, I mean, I will always support someone doing investigative journalism and it's a really hard business model and we're, we're in that we're in the same business. Right. But like I just really don't like trying to discredit something like this on a false premise. And what's here I'll. What's actually happening is. Here's what's actually happening.
00:40:44.743 - 00:41:16.001, Speaker A: Poly Markets definitely are probably. I know nothing. I'm sure you know something and can't say say but like Poly Market will probably launch a token and just like anything that is going to launch a token, there's all these farmers who come in and there's no fees on polymarket. So what do you do when there's no fees in a future token coming? You, you, you wash volume. Right. Just like you would on any dex or crypto exchange or whatever. You just wash a bunch of volume to rack up user activity to then get a token.
00:41:16.001 - 00:41:30.107, Speaker A: So that's what's happening here. It's not what they're quietly doing is implying that there's like fake volume coming in to move the odds. That is not what's happening. There's just airdrop farmers coming in and washing a bunch of volume.
00:41:30.131 - 00:42:01.005, Speaker B: Yeah, so. So Omar, he's supposed to join, he'll join next week but I'm reading his tweet thread right. There's a couple of observations that he makes that I think are just worthy to present without commentary. So they're the Trump yes tokens have traded $0.01 to $0.10 higher in poly Market than similar tokens on Kalshi, a US only prediction market that recently received regulatory approval. So it's really on August 17th that this spread really blew out.
00:42:01.005 - 00:42:06.185, Speaker B: He posted this six days ago by the way, if you want to show it on the screen. There it is. That one.
00:42:06.305 - 00:42:06.825, Speaker A: Thanks.
00:42:06.945 - 00:42:46.946, Speaker B: Yeah, that one. So what the data shows according to them, a Single person on August 17th bet across four distinct accounts Fred, you know in Poly Market and became began accumulating a massive Trump yes stake that day. This particular trader's activity over these four accounts accounted for 28% of the market's total volume. And Poly Market he purchased a roughly 700k of Trump yes net shares. There was also a piece on the New York Times talked about this. So this single four trader cluster accounted for 28% of the polymarket's activity.
00:42:47.016 - 00:42:51.814, Speaker A: And that, that's one, that's one trader's behind all four of those one traders.
00:42:51.884 - 00:43:20.621, Speaker B: I think he's French. One trader account for 28%. So it really was four of these days were concentrated around mid August. So when Poly Markets imply Trump odds begun diverging significantly from the calling based consensus. So of course this moves the market in Polymarket. We know that. So Polymarket's current $0.01
00:43:20.621 - 00:43:58.735, Speaker B: market depth, that is the size of an order needed to move the market price by 110 is currently around 100k. I think that's interesting. So it's a large market, but the market depth is particularly in this case he's making the argument it's not as kind of robust, so, and it was quite shallow in August, okay. This particular trader, since August has bought or sold more than 100k size with a single transaction on 60 different occasions. He also mentioned that again and again. Omar, why are you repeating yourself? Making a fool here. So what's the gap? This is a tldr.
00:43:58.735 - 00:44:37.623, Speaker B: The impact of the whale trader, Omar argues, cannot be understated. If one entity represents 25% of the total market and at times 20%, 20% of the daily volume, it will have an outside influence. And further, you know, the illiquidity of these markets, you know, can move the price. However, you know, this is probably the most important point. He says there's, it's, there's no trivial way to arbitrage this spread, which is a point I made earlier. Under Cauchy's current fee structure, price takers in the election market pay a fee of $0.02 per transaction.
00:44:37.623 - 00:45:17.155, Speaker B: So that potentially is a, you know, gets in the way of arbitraging this. And furthermore, polymarket is only available in theory to non US users where Kalshi is only available in theory, in practice to US users. So that might account for the kind of, the ability, I guess get in the way of like arbitraging this out. And then last Matt Levine also wrote about this. Any would be arbitrage or runs. The added risk of an adverse market resolution of a candidate disputes the election result. And that is probably the most important.
00:45:17.155 - 00:46:08.965, Speaker B: So in summary, and I don't know how much of this explains it because your pointer on watch trading doesn't explain the difference. The difference of the spread might be just the particular preference of a user, non US versus US. And if the spreads are that wide between these markets, in theory, in an efficient market that should be arbitraged out. But because of this, two things, One, US users versus non US users, different people can't access the platform. The fees to come in and out of this are mitigators. And the third risk of, I think of before in the prior election Poly Market had an issue because obviously the election result was contested and the resolution of that market was controversial. And so if you want to arbitrage these markets, it makes you think twice is what I'm trying to say.
00:46:08.965 - 00:46:32.403, Speaker B: So I don't think your point is a really good one. Watch. Trading doesn't explain the spread. The lack of being able to arbitrage that spread for these three reasons I just outlined that Omar and Matt Levine talk about would explain the spread. It's a material spread. So anyways, I don't, that's really it. I don't have a point of view here.
00:46:32.539 - 00:46:39.891, Speaker A: Cool. By next roundup they'll be a president. So we'll see. Gonna be a crazy week. Have you voted?
00:46:40.043 - 00:46:41.095, Speaker B: Have you voted?
00:46:41.595 - 00:46:43.107, Speaker A: No, I still haven't voted yet.
00:46:43.251 - 00:46:44.095, Speaker B: Why not?
00:46:45.355 - 00:46:46.575, Speaker A: Because I'm lazy.
00:46:47.515 - 00:47:16.337, Speaker B: I damn got invoked. So you are what I consider pretty politically well versed. I know we don't like to talk about politics in the podcast. Give me your two to three or longer view on the election. To summarize it all for people that are, you know, been living under a rock, what are you paying attention to? What are, what do you think the results just get give.
00:47:16.481 - 00:47:49.743, Speaker A: I'm putting, I have no idea. I think it's crypto. People pay really close attention to poly market. Like we just spent 15 minutes on a podcast talking about it. The 65% Trump versus 35% comma makes it feel like Trump is obviously going to win. I think it's going to be ridiculously close. And then what's going to happen is like I think it's literally a toss up and then I think what ends up happening is, I mean both, both sides are already prepping for a all out war to contest the election.
00:47:49.743 - 00:48:26.753, Speaker A: So this thing's not like it's, I think there's an idea that the market is waiting for the election to calm down and to get some certainty and then things rip. And I think we, I don't think that could happen. I don't think that'll happen until maybe January, maybe even into into February because November and December, it's. There could be even more uncertainty then than there is today. I don't know if it'll be that drastic. But like I think it's going to be. We, we, we'll never see, we've never seen a contested election like we have seen for, than we will see for this one.
00:48:26.753 - 00:49:08.275, Speaker A: So that's the first thing that I think I'm kind of prepping for mentally that I don't think people are thinking too much about. And I think, I mean I know both sides are going to do that Right. If Kamala wins, Trump's team, they're, they're Republicans are doing an all out war contesting the election and same vice versa. So that's going to, I mean that's going to get pretty messy and I think that won't bring the market certainty that people are expecting. That's, that's one thing on the, on the like next couple of days, I mean it's basically just people have mostly made up their minds. I mean there's very few undecided voters anymore. Now the important thing is getting people to the polls for both sides, so.
00:49:08.855 - 00:49:10.595, Speaker B: Including yourself.
00:49:11.215 - 00:49:15.487, Speaker A: Getting me to the polls? No, I'll vote. I was, I was, they don't strike.
00:49:15.511 - 00:49:16.383, Speaker B: Me as a non voter.
00:49:16.479 - 00:49:48.255, Speaker A: Yeah. The interesting thing about the is there's two extremely different campaign teams. So usually in politics you have like basically a carbon copy of the operation and the team on both sides. Just one is, you know, red and one is blue. It's like blue team versus red team. Right now Trump, Trump's team, if you look at the campaign team is extremely different than Comma's team like in their operations and who they've hired. And I mean, so he's trolling.
00:49:48.295 - 00:49:52.007, Speaker B: He's like in a garbage truck because like Biden called garbage. Right.
00:49:52.071 - 00:50:22.247, Speaker A: So Trump strategy right now is like, you know, yeah, McDonald's, the garbage truck stuff, these huge rallies and I think there's actually probably more people who are interested. I mean there's a lot. He's done a great job of getting people interested. He doesn't really have the ground game that Harris's campaign has. Like, like Harrison in the key states. Like they are on the ground, they know they are. They have years of experience of how to get people to the polls, I will say.
00:50:22.247 - 00:50:45.901, Speaker A: So it'll be interesting to see if like yes, Trump has gotten a lot of people very interested in Trump. Can he actually, like you can have a 22 year old or, you know, or an 80 year old who loves Trump but doesn't get off their ass to go vote. So it's really important that both sides right now are getting people, their people to the polls. Not just, hey, I'm a Trump guy. Oh, hey, I'm a, I'm a common guy.
00:50:46.093 - 00:51:23.253, Speaker B: Well, if you listen to Elon Musk's speech, the, the route Trump rally in New York, Madison Square Garden, which is super electric. I saw some clips. He, his point was gone vote, like get out and vote and vote early and let this be a landslide result. So I think like the, the weight and Gravitas of musk I think is very important. How to your point, how much of that translates into people getting to vote? It is just a. To your point around friction and inertia. It is just a game to get people to vote.
00:51:23.253 - 00:51:35.013, Speaker B: Trump's. Trump's. Trump is tweeting at Mert. I mean, never thought I'd see that Mert. Congrats. He I think ratioed Trump too. Pretty.
00:51:35.013 - 00:51:59.397, Speaker B: Pretty amazing. Look, I mean we talked about this before. The swing states historically have been tight. Like less than 100,000, 150,000 like difference in these. In the outcome. Best believe that there are at least 100000 people in some of these states that love crypto. And you know, imagine the headline.
00:51:59.397 - 00:52:24.347, Speaker B: That would be probably the most bullish headline for this industry. Imagine the outcome of the result comes down to swing states, very tight margin, 100k voters. And these voters, most of them are pro crypto. And they just identified more with Trump because he's just been very clear in pro crypto. And if. Imagine the headline like Trump wins key constituent base the crypto. Both PAC from a fundraising standpoint.
00:52:24.347 - 00:52:37.707, Speaker B: But also more importantly, younger voters like Obama won the. Won the younger crowd, won the immigrant crowd back in the day. Right. And that was the headline. So younger people. You know, he really did that grassroots campaign. His.
00:52:37.707 - 00:53:06.255, Speaker B: I think that was probably the Democrats you're pointing to better job that. But imagine if this election is won because of the crypto voter that I think unequivocally just places crypto. It sets an immense precedent of how important crypto is that has captured the psycheist of a generation. It sets. I mean that, that would be. Yeah, that would be pretty amazing if you ask me.
00:53:06.415 - 00:53:08.715, Speaker A: If you ask me, too bad you can't vote.
00:53:09.645 - 00:53:18.741, Speaker B: Well, you know, I will say I'm wearing. I am in the US so I don't know if people can see, but I'm wearing a American flag, baby. Can you see it?
00:53:18.933 - 00:53:20.385, Speaker A: Yeah, I can see it.
00:53:21.445 - 00:53:29.029, Speaker B: I wanted to be in the US not just for the marathon, but I want to be here. I think it's gonna be a historic election. Yeah, I'm really excited about it.
00:53:29.157 - 00:53:35.037, Speaker A: Nice, nice. There's a trash article in the Atlantic. Here, I'll show you.
00:53:35.141 - 00:53:36.025, Speaker B: Shocker.
00:53:39.085 - 00:54:01.007, Speaker A: The Atlantic posted the worst of crypto is yet to come and made the argument that the only reason that crypto has come back over the last two years is not because anyone built their way out of a bare market with all odds stacked against us, but because we've spent a lot of money on super packs and this just. Oh, like this. I mean, it's just, you know, it just.
00:54:01.111 - 00:54:01.615, Speaker B: More reasons.
00:54:01.655 - 00:54:05.119, Speaker A: I don't know why this stuff still bothers me. I'm like, what a stupid article.
00:54:05.287 - 00:54:09.235, Speaker B: Well, I canceled my subscription to the Atlantic a couple years ago. Needless to say.
00:54:10.615 - 00:54:28.777, Speaker A: There you go. All right. Last thing I want to talk about is the Celestia unlocks. So they're big Celestia unlocks. Yesterday or Tuesday there was about a billion. Oh, man. I think I'm going to get this right.
00:54:28.777 - 00:54:41.323, Speaker A: Yeah, it's 180 million. TIA hit the market, which is roughly, you know, 9 at the time was like 900 million. So celestial was hovering above 5ish or 5 bucks.
00:54:41.410 - 00:54:43.499, Speaker B: So that's. Yeah, no higher.
00:54:43.586 - 00:54:59.235, Speaker A: 6. Is that 6 a week ago? Sorry. Yeah, 6. So it's down about 25%. Yeah, down. So anyways, huge unlock, about $1 billion of TIA unlocked represents about 80% of the current supply. Got unlocked this week.
00:54:59.235 - 00:55:39.983, Speaker A: Funding rates on TIA were crazy negative in the past like couple of weeks. And I mean it's actually positive today. If you look at coin glass, I guess that's what VC is closing out their perp shorts as they, as they unlock them. But yeah, I'm just curious how you like, when you look at this big of an unlock hitting the market, TIA is down from 6 down to 470. To me, I'm like, this is kind of what I've been talking about for a little while, which is. I think some of these unlocks are overblown like that. Yes, that's down 20%, 25%.
00:55:39.983 - 00:55:55.525, Speaker A: But like, it feels a little. It feels like the market absorbed it better than people thought it was going to absorb it. But I'm curious how you. Although I guess maybe the counter argument is this is. This is the real chart. It's really down from.
00:55:55.905 - 00:55:59.505, Speaker B: Look at our. Yeah, I mean, look, I. Yeah, it's down quite a bit.
00:55:59.625 - 00:56:02.081, Speaker A: Down from 20 down to 470 there.
00:56:02.193 - 00:56:19.387, Speaker B: I think they did some. One of the things that I was tracking was secondary market activity and transactions for T. There was some. A lot of movement there over the last six months. There are some. I think treasury transact. There was some like treasury diversification transactions at higher than the current spot.
00:56:19.387 - 00:56:56.899, Speaker B: And even before the unlock, like six bucks, I think there was, there was some movement there which likely, you know, to your point around, it wasn't as bad as you would have thought. I think a lot of it is just secondary market, healthy secondary market allowed for some. Some of this orderly transactions before the unlocked, you know, and I think, you know, these shares are not potentially VCs that are weighing the money of de risk. And so that creates a more orderly unlock. I'd say it's still down quite a bit. Arbitrum had to say, you know, I. We'll see.
00:56:56.899 - 00:57:15.313, Speaker B: I think it's too early to tell. I wouldn't be shocked if this goes down to three bucks. I would also, you know, because as people continue to sell and you know, there's this idea of like, all right, I'm not going to sell, maybe in the first week, but I'm just going to continue to drip out. And there's this constant sell pressure. I don't know. You could also argue that the market's just been soft for, you know, a lot of these projects. It's.
00:57:15.313 - 00:57:40.519, Speaker B: It's really much a bitcoin solana meme game ethos flat. And also, you know, you could talk about specific idiosyncratic things about Celestia. Right. You know, it's. You can look at like DA revenue is not much. So is this, you know, do these things trade on fundamentals or not? And I mean, certainly I think that's something that I'm observing, you know, like, what's the DA revenue like? Yeah, I understand the modularity thesis. It's important.
00:57:40.519 - 00:57:54.519, Speaker B: We've talked about it. We've had Nick White on the podcast. We've talked, we've talked about it. The question is, yeah, blah, go up to that. You have your dashboard, which is really good here. Total blob fees are 51,000. Like, you know, there's a mass amount of data.
00:57:54.519 - 00:58:10.105, Speaker B: It's important. There's not much revenue. So it makes you wonder what's the viability of this project? At some point, fundamentals, I believe, do matter. And you compare that against maker. Vastly different story. Celestia is trading at higher value.
00:58:10.145 - 00:58:37.935, Speaker A: No, let me take the counter argument. Counter argument is that all right, so if you look at the Blockworks research Celestia dashboard, you can see Celestia data posted to the blobs by namespace. So you can see things like manta and lira and Eclipse and B3 and things like that. I mean, that chart is up and to the right base. Here's the, I think bull case for Celestia. The market still doesn't trade on fundamentals. No one's valuing this thing on a cash flow basis or, you know, a multiple of revenue.
00:58:37.935 - 00:58:58.359, Speaker A: There's big volatility in the short term because there's These obviously unlocks the bull. Case is probably blob space. Demand is on fire. It's on the rise. L2s are launching. You know, every day it feels like modular stack is expanding and Celestia is basically positioned themselves as the go to da layer. Gotta imagine it's a go to DIA.
00:58:58.407 - 00:59:00.903, Speaker B: Layer, but there's no. There's a value capture.
00:59:01.079 - 00:59:03.263, Speaker A: Okay, but like if you're selecting compare.
00:59:03.279 - 00:59:28.063, Speaker B: That, compare that to Jito's revenue. Man, like, put a pull up Jito's fucking revenue record. Like, you mean like, again, like, maybe it's not the right comparison. But like, I definitely, you know, I mean like Solana just continues to post and capture a lot of this MEV and transaction fees and tips. Like, I don't know, like, I never want to invest in some. Look, none of this is investment advice. But you asked me.
00:59:28.063 - 00:59:49.313, Speaker B: I don't want to touch something that doesn't capture and does fundamental value. I just. I'm sorry, but I don't feel comfortable owning it inside my portfolio. Chris, if you're listening for placeholder, I know he has uber bullish Celestia and there's others that are not. We can have a pod. I think it'd be great discussion. I do want to fundamentally understand why this thing is worth how much.
00:59:49.489 - 00:59:53.033, Speaker A: Let's get, let's get. We should do a pod with Nick and Chris.
00:59:53.169 - 01:00:09.045, Speaker B: All right, let's do just napkin math. Spare me a minute. I'm gonna pull up FDVs for these projects. And I know people are going to say, why are you looking at ftv? Well, sorry, folks, this is how my brain thinks. So if you don't like it, close down the tab now and stop listening Jito.
01:00:10.105 - 01:00:11.725, Speaker A: Here, I've got. I've got it right here.
01:00:12.635 - 01:00:21.218, Speaker B: 300 million FTV. 2.3 billion. Okay, 2.3 billion. Celestia FTV. 5 billion.
01:00:21.218 - 01:00:50.145, Speaker B: All right, almost over a 2x discrepancy in fully diluted VAL. To be fair, Celestia has 30% afloat. Jito has less. Jito has 13% float. Okay, all right, fair point. But still 2x difference. But you mean 2x difference and fully diluted.
01:00:50.145 - 01:00:53.405, Speaker B: Jito's making vastly more money than Celestial.
01:00:53.445 - 01:00:54.829, Speaker A: I get that. I get. I get that.
01:00:54.877 - 01:00:56.517, Speaker B: Maker, lastly.
01:00:56.621 - 01:00:58.917, Speaker A: No, I. Okay, I'll stop talking Maker.
01:00:59.021 - 01:01:06.981, Speaker B: No, you got me. This is Locke alone. Coffee, by the way, ladies and gentlemen. Locked in Maker. Maker. Billion dollar in market. Cap Vance from Framework.
01:01:06.981 - 01:01:16.021, Speaker B: If you're listening, you should come on and talk about maker, fully diluted VAL, 1.1 billion, 97% float. All right, Maker is making how much money here?
01:01:16.093 - 01:01:23.025, Speaker A: Financials monthly last month, 230 million.
01:01:23.325 - 01:01:42.677, Speaker B: Will maker makes in a day what Celestia makes in a year, so to speak, kind of thing, or more like. I don't know, ladies and gentlemen, but I don't want to own something in my book that has. That is trading at 5 billion and is making less money than, you know, I don't know.
01:01:42.861 - 01:02:01.013, Speaker A: All right, let me take the. Let me just take the counter and then we'll have. We'll wrap this up and we'll have Nick and Chris to give us the Uber bull case for Celestia, which is. Celestia is the go to da layer right now. Token's been whacked because of these unlocks. The unlocks just happened. L2s are launching every single day.
01:02:01.013 - 01:02:36.283, Speaker A: Blob space demand is on the rise. Eth Blobs are just starting to see, like, early price discovery. The blobs are probably going to get more and more expensive as more L2s come online. And if I am Celestia, I'm thinking about you've got your kind of modular stack. You got to eventually expand outside of just DA and give people the ability to launch, like. Yeah, to kind of compete with the op stacks and initias and, you know, Avalanche, L1s and ZK elastic chains and arbitrary orbits of the world. So that's probably where I would guess Celestia goes.
01:02:36.283 - 01:02:44.555, Speaker A: So Celestia announces maybe that they are competing with the op stack. Like, I don't know. That's. That's the counter.
01:02:44.715 - 01:03:07.589, Speaker B: Sounds. Sounds a lot like I need to believe many things to happen and basically price to fucking perfection. I don't know, man. I don't need to believe many things for salon activity to continue to, you know, perform. And it being the most, you know, friendly chain and integrated and, you know, I mean, like, sounds like a Jenga tower of assumptions. You know, Celestial has to do this and then maybe, maybe, maybe they'll do.
01:03:07.637 - 01:03:08.981, Speaker A: Nick is. Nick. Nick.
01:03:09.053 - 01:03:09.333, Speaker B: Nick.
01:03:09.389 - 01:03:11.189, Speaker A: Chris, you're getting the invite. Coming on the pod.
01:03:11.237 - 01:03:26.735, Speaker B: Please, come on. Great tech again. There could be great tech, but the Valley crew may not be there. There's plenty of examples of that now. Maybe in the future. Certainly possible. If it's great tech, it's embedded, they have the possibility to then, you know, capture more value in different ways.
01:03:26.735 - 01:03:49.357, Speaker B: You know, a lot of companies like Uber had this issue, and I'm cognizant of that. And it takes years to turn a profit. It's a good product. Eventually you have the optionality. If you're really embedded, if every L2 is using you, then presumably you can. You're in a position of strength and you can lean into that to make more money. But currently it's not making money for that reason, I would be cautious.
01:03:49.357 - 01:03:50.345, Speaker B: So I'm saying.
01:03:51.605 - 01:04:22.925, Speaker A: All right, last thing on this note and then I have one more thing to share is our friend Simon over at Moonrock Capital posted this note on scroll. So I know you're an investor in scroll, so I don't know how much you can talk about it, but Simon said, I really don't want to hate on scroll, but to me it was a textbook example of a launch using an outdated playbook that doesn't work anymore. BC raise at an inflated valuation. Pointless airdrop farming meta. And the worst is binance listing for five and a half percent of the supply. That's about 70 million at least. Flushed down the toilet.
01:04:22.925 - 01:04:41.045, Speaker A: Sexes are the only winner again. Investors pissed. Community pissed. Retail wrecked. The one thing that they didn't focus on was the only real North Star metric. An ecosystem should have actual apps on top that people genuinely want to use, creating lasting value. It's unfortunate, but it was all too predictable that this approach would backfire.
01:04:41.045 - 01:04:43.865, Speaker A: I don't need you to comment on scroll because I know you're an investor there.
01:04:43.905 - 01:05:02.033, Speaker B: But I would challenge the last point though. The only real North Star. His point that they weren't focused on that I would completely like challenge. I think Simon, go and talk to scroll team. I think you'd be generally surprised of the quality of the builders there. I think they're. They've done a very proactive effort and less playing the point meta game.
01:05:02.033 - 01:05:14.299, Speaker B: I'll just say that the Binance 5% fee we talked about. Yeah. I think my point, my opinion on that is fairly clear. And it's just a. I don't think it's a scroll problem, it's an industry problem.
01:05:14.347 - 01:05:14.483, Speaker A: Right.
01:05:14.499 - 01:05:17.499, Speaker B: I mean the fact that they have to give five and a half percent. Yeah.
01:05:17.667 - 01:05:21.307, Speaker A: Binance is just hosing people right now. But it's bonkers.
01:05:21.371 - 01:05:30.203, Speaker B: And by the way, like, I don't have a sense of like this 5%. Is it fair or not? But Sandy had a post about that and she explained the reasoning. But I mean it's.
01:05:30.259 - 01:05:40.483, Speaker A: Yeah. So it's not scroll. It's not a scroll thing. It's a. Everyone is being forced to give between like 2 to 8% of their tokens. Yeah. Of their token supply to Binance.
01:05:40.483 - 01:05:51.615, Speaker A: Right. Now it is highway robbery. So I don't know. That's why we talk about these ICOs coming back. Like that's behind my excitement about these ICOs coming back.
01:05:52.155 - 01:06:04.289, Speaker B: Last point I'll make, which every time we talk about regulation is what's the intent of the law and who's getting hurt. And I think you could argue that in the current state of affairs, people are getting hurt far more than in a war world of ICOs where.
01:06:04.337 - 01:06:21.777, Speaker A: Yeah. All right, to wrap it up, I want to just shout out. The Blockchain association just launched this dashboard. It's the regulation enforcement dashboard. It tracks the SEC's Anti Crypto Crusade. They update it in real time. Maybe not.
01:06:21.777 - 01:06:53.359, Speaker A: I don't know how they would do this in real time. Self reported data figure updates as legal proceedings continue. It shows the amount spent in defensive litigation. 426 million. The number of SEC enforcement actions brought against crypto under gendler. 104. And it's just a good, it's a good dashboard and it shows this big report about like how they think about voter perception on SEC enforcement.
01:06:53.359 - 01:07:00.695, Speaker A: So it's timely with the election and talking about regulation and yeah, just shout out to the Blockchain Association. Doing good work.
01:07:01.275 - 01:07:10.335, Speaker B: All right, folks, well, thanks for listening. Go out and vote. If you're in the us you're able to vote ineligible. Please go and vote. It's important. Yeah, I know. That includes you.
01:07:10.875 - 01:07:12.555, Speaker A: I don't miss voting. I always vote.
01:07:12.595 - 01:07:30.429, Speaker B: I know, I know, I know. Anyways, and again, if you're running the marathon, drop us a comment. Drop your time, your corral, what have you. And maybe we'll love to see some of you folks out there running or on the sidelines. If you do see me, please cheer me on because I will be struggling, struggling.
01:07:30.517 - 01:07:33.989, Speaker A: Do you have your struggling, struggling. Do you have your bib number?
01:07:34.157 - 01:07:49.493, Speaker B: I do, I do my bib number. People can track me, I guess. No pressure. My bib number is 4, 8, 5, 1.
01:07:49.577 - 01:07:50.760, Speaker A: Well, let's go.
01:07:50.845 - 01:07:52.463, Speaker C: 4, 8, 5, one.
01:07:52.559 - 01:07:54.271, Speaker A: So there's an app that you can download, right?
01:07:54.383 - 01:08:05.543, Speaker B: Yeah, there's an app you can download. Results are online so people can comment and I don't have a time in mind. I'm just going to go out there and have fun.
01:08:05.719 - 01:08:26.009, Speaker A: Nice. I'm going to read a post that I wrote to wrap this up. I wrote this four years ago, sent this email to the company and I think it's relevant today. All right. I wrote it's time to vote. September 2020. I said, whatever your politics we can agree that the upcoming election is critical.
01:08:26.009 - 01:08:53.865, Speaker A: I said Team voting in the US is hard. There are 50 states with 50 different systems. Nearly every other modern democracy holds elections on weekends or makes Election Day a national holiday. But not here in America. Let's look at what that does to voting. Just over 36% of eligible voters showed up to the 2014 midterms, the lowest turnout in 72 years. The 56% participate participation rate in 2016 puts us 26th among 32 developed nations in voter turnout.
01:08:53.865 - 01:09:17.609, Speaker A: The importance of the upcoming election can't be overstated. We'd like to do everything in our power to encourage you to vote.
