00:00:02.360 - 00:00:04.554, Speaker A: How many tabs do you have currently open right now?
00:00:06.454 - 00:00:24.686, Speaker B: Currently I only have three. I only have three, actually. I'm not a big tab guy. I don't understand the, like, fomo over having tab. Like, I use this tool called pocket, actually. So, like, if I have something that I just want to, like, come back and visit, I'll just pocket it. And, you know what I find is.
00:00:24.710 - 00:00:26.514, Speaker A: Like, do you manually open it?
00:00:27.124 - 00:00:40.104, Speaker B: 98% of the things I think I'll come back to, I don't come back to it. So. Yeah, I think that's probably most, like, the tab hoarders will call them. They don't actually ever go back to the tabs.
00:00:40.404 - 00:00:44.904, Speaker A: No, it's just that illusion of, like, you're getting shit done, but you're really not.
00:00:45.684 - 00:00:51.084, Speaker B: I signed up for a crypto podcast. You're getting a. Getting a personal productivity, a lecture on.
00:00:51.244 - 00:00:52.864, Speaker A: Tabs and then tab.
00:00:53.404 - 00:00:54.820, Speaker B: How we doing, partner? How we doing?
00:00:54.852 - 00:00:56.346, Speaker A: I'm doing all right. Doing all right.
00:00:56.370 - 00:00:56.634, Speaker B: Doesn't.
00:00:56.674 - 00:01:15.330, Speaker A: I was just saying I'm busy. Doesn't feel like a bear market certainly wasn't this active and just came back this week, and it's just been really active. I. I don't remember being like this in 2019. 2019 was, like, dead right now. It's not that.
00:01:15.522 - 00:01:27.414, Speaker B: Yeah. This is a man Jesse had. I love Jesse's quote in that podcast. I mean, obviously, we'll talk a lot about Coinbase here, but he's like, feels like there's a bear market in prices, but on chain activity is at an all time high.
00:01:27.494 - 00:01:30.126, Speaker A: And I just like creativity. All time high.
00:01:30.230 - 00:01:30.446, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:01:30.470 - 00:01:31.630, Speaker A: That last part of the episode really.
00:01:31.702 - 00:01:50.274, Speaker B: Fired up so much stuff going on right now. It's nuts. There's, like, so much stuff happening in crypto. It's so funny because I went out to dinner with a couple friends. Like, one's a doctor, one works at Uber. A lot of them work in, like, web two, like, SaaS companies and, like, the Ubers of the world. One's a doctor.
00:01:50.274 - 00:02:07.114, Speaker B: None of them think that anything's happening in crypto. They're like, yeah, I mean, we own some bitcoin and some ETH, and, like, I don't know. I feel like nothing really happens in crypto anymore. I was like, oh, man, I am living in a totally different world than you guys.
00:02:07.814 - 00:02:46.744, Speaker A: Okay, that's them, right? Get worried when, like, the Uber drivers and, like, these tech bros start asking about crypto and which nfts to buy. That's, like a sign, a signal that we're toppy. But like, I think we just said something really cool in that episode with Jesse, which was like, even if you're in crypto, I think there will come a moment where we just click. It just clicks, and we reach kind of this really big inflection point, escape velocity, whatever term you want to use. And I think he's right in the sense that, like, we, all of us here, you, I, and everyone in this generation kind of lived through the. The rise of smartphones where it didn't exist. And then it kind of went in it, like, in a matter of years.
00:02:46.744 - 00:03:06.552, Speaker A: Like, it just penetrated a two thirds of the world's population, and it just exploded a whole category of verticals. Like, you had the app boom and bust. Everyone was building apps, and then you went from, like, shitty, like, Internet super expensive to LTE. We've come such a long way, and, like, massive empires have been built.
00:03:06.728 - 00:03:07.584, Speaker B: Like, you know what I mean?
00:03:07.624 - 00:03:54.562, Speaker A: Ubers of the world that, like, without a smartphone, like, it wasn't, like, really kind of viable business model. But somehow, like, as I was thinking about that, like, living through that didn't feel super impactful. Like, it felt incremental, right? And then it compounded to then this thing called the smartphone, iPhone you can't live without. You now have trouble sleeping without. You get anxiety if you don't look at it, like, constantly. And I think we're like, it's probably pretty impressive that that happened because, you know, we talk a lot about in this podcast about how transformational we think the crypto is going to be. But I wonder, like, at what point are you going to pinch yourself when that actually happens? And I don't think we're far from that.
00:03:54.562 - 00:04:08.876, Speaker A: We've talked a lot about account abstraction. You know, the activity in l two s. It does feel like. Like I was reading this great book. It's called web design, actually. Let me put up one sec.
00:04:09.060 - 00:04:11.864, Speaker B: Oh, the big one. So the big bulky book.
00:04:13.444 - 00:04:40.524, Speaker A: Yes. Like, an illustrated book. Honestly, one of my favorite. How the Internet happened. And then this book, unreal. Like, you just go through, like, the first versions of websites to, like, it goes all the way to today, which is, like, 2018, but still, like, I just went back to it and I didn't even remember, like, using, like, miniclip and on some of these websites. And, like, it's really good to look back and, like, see how these things evolved.
00:04:40.524 - 00:05:02.622, Speaker A: The bottom line is, as these things really transformational paradigm shifts, whatever you want to call them, happen when you're living in the moment, even though you're part of the industry, when you're living and breathing it, it doesn't feel like how you describe it at post mortem. Like it was like the biggest thing that could probably happen to this generation. So anyways, yeah, I agree, man.
00:05:02.678 - 00:06:11.796, Speaker B: I mean there's this great. Yeah, so you talk about the mobile phone revolutions. Like one of the crazy things I think from that era was the iPhone introduced this infrastructure that then enabled you to build these apps and then the apps pushed developers and founders to then build better infrastructure. And like, you know, you couldn't have Uber until you and Lyft, until you had a map inside your pocket and you couldn't have, you know, Instagram and Snapchat until you had a phone inside your pocket and, but when someone saw the phone in a camera they didn't think Snapchat and Instagram. So it's cool. Like what better infrastructure can do? And obviously, I mean, I basically want to spend a lot of this podcast talking about Coinbase but, and that podcast that we did and your thoughts on that podcast and just their announcement over their l two. But there's actually this great, I'll link to this piece by USB that I always reference, which is the myth of the infrastructure phase which they talk about the relationship between apps and infrastructure and they track it back 50 years.
00:06:11.796 - 00:06:48.760, Speaker B: So they're like, first there was messaging 1970 and then email in 1972. That, that inspired infrastructure that made it easier to have broad consumer adoption of those apps of messaging and email. And that was like the ether, like Ethernet in the mid seventies. TCP, IP, ISP's like Internet service providers in the mid seventies. Then there's another wave of apps which were like web portals like AOL and Prodigy. And then the web portals inspired us to build infrastructure like search engines and web browsers. Then there was another web of apps like Amazon which inspired us to build PHP and JavaScript and Java.
00:06:48.760 - 00:07:34.116, Speaker B: And you think about Facebook, like we, I brought up React, the coding language like Facebook created React because they were, my understanding is that they were having trouble handling the ad marketplace they were building. So that was an app that required a better coding language of infrastructure. So anyways, I think you see this playing out and I think that ties in nicely with this Coinbase announcement, which is one of the biggest pieces of infrastructure news that I think we've ever seen in crypto. We did this episode with Jesse and will with their team. And if you guys haven't listened to that, I really recommend you guys listen to that before you listen to this. And it should be the last episode on Empire that just came out yesterday. Basically, I'll give the summary and then I really want to hear your thoughts.
00:07:34.116 - 00:08:08.800, Speaker B: The summary is that Coinbase just announced their own layer two. The l two is called base. It's built on the op stack, which is different than optimism. The op stack is open source code that powers optimism. Coinbase met the optimism team while they're working on EIP 4844, which is the proto dang sharding proposal. And Coinbase is actually joining as the second core dev team working on the op stack, which I think is really cool. They're doing that to ensure that the op stack is a publicly, as a public good, available for everyone, to everyone for free.
00:08:08.800 - 00:08:46.339, Speaker B: And they're also going to contribute 20% of sequencer revenue to fund public goods, which is just like I tipped the cap to Coinbase. From a competition lens, it's super interesting because base is actually going to compete with optimism and all the l two s. Eventually they see everything integrating together, but not yet. So I think you heard me on the podcast. It was a little tough for me to wrap my head around because optimism is helping Coinbase here, but they're also competing with them, which is just like, I don't know, I was just smiling at that after we stopped recording, I was like, it's very crypto. It was interesting to hear, like, before the l two, they debated a couple other ideas. Like they discussed building their own l one in 2018 and 2020.
00:08:46.339 - 00:09:03.962, Speaker B: They discussed building an ad network. They discussed building this identity product. So it was cool to hear them go through this product, years of product feedback and stuff. And finally they landed on this l two. I think it's called base. So base is the name of it. It's going to be permissionless from day one.
00:09:03.962 - 00:09:26.134, Speaker B: It's in testnet right now. Mainnet comes soon. They're launching an ecosystem fund as well to incentivize development. And then from the business model perspective, it seems like there's two business models here, fees and Mev. They're not enabling Mev right now. Transactions are just going to come in in the order that they come into the sequencer. It seems like a fee based business model right now.
00:09:26.134 - 00:09:33.604, Speaker B: No token. But anyways, I just like, very excited that they're building this and would like to hear your thoughts on it.
00:09:34.304 - 00:10:07.356, Speaker A: I think you summarized it extremely well. It was just good to have Jesse and Will, which I met previously, and really smart guys. And to be fair, I gained a much bigger appreciation of the role that Coinbase is playing in the industry. They're synonymous with buying crypto in the US. And I'll give them credit for that. When I was buying my crypto back in the day, super early, it was Coinbase. And I think they played a huge role, irrespective of what Jim Cramer and the stock has done.
00:10:07.356 - 00:11:26.938, Speaker A: I think you'd be an idiot not to recognize the role that they've done as an on ramp, as a primary on ramp for Americans mostly, and most of like other in the UK and other places. Incredible role that they played. And it's also pretty remarkable that the company is investing and putting a lot of resources into contributing to the ecosystem. And Jesse kept mentioning the plan, the long term vision, three part vision that Brian laid out in 2017, which it sounds like they're entering the third one, which is like creating the App Store and the everything app for this web three and becoming the gateway for this web three world for everyone. Really. One of the things that we talked about in the episode that I think is still TBD is what does this actually mean for Coinbase business? I think they pointed out, rightfully so, that historically they built a Coinbase wallet, which is great product. And the question was, are you basically cannibalizing your existing business by building all these things that encourage users to leave the Coinbase kind of centralized solution? I think you came up with a great answer, which I actually believe.
00:11:26.938 - 00:12:13.500, Speaker A: I dont think its like Kool Aid, which is look, at the end of the day, its such a small pie right now that our primary goal to drive value is to bring hundreds of millions, billions of people into space. And if you don't do that, none of this matters realistically. And I think they, it's great to see that the organization like that is willing to like reinvent themselves to some capacity because I think by and large, a lot of, most like 98% of businesses in crypto haven't found product market fit. Yeah, like Ethereum has centralized like on ramps have, there's a lot of speculation in the space, but a lot, a lot of projects are masking product market fail. The token and you know, that's okay. Like you don't have to find product market fit immediately. You don't have to find like business models immediately.
00:12:13.500 - 00:13:35.724, Speaker A: Like social media went through this phase where all you all Zuckerberg was focused on was like building the best social media platform and then, and then you could layer on a whole other things, but it started and ended with being the best social media platform. And if you have that engagement, then you can do a lot of things with that. And I think Coinbase, like, has that as an organization really, really focused on, we have to be the place where people come to interact in this world. And I think a large part of the rationale is, if I'm them, it was really interesting to see, as you mentioned, the evolution of why they decided, of all the things in their whiteboard to make this the number one priority from an engineering standpoint. I think this is a phenomenon that you constantly see in crypto, which is, as an engineering team, the question was, you already allow withdrawals to an l two like optimism. Why build a separate chain using their stack? He didn't lay it out explicitly, but my appreciation and just seeing how other people have reacted to this today is, I think by building on the op stack, you control a lot of things. You brought up permissioned defi, like a permissioned l two, which is, hey, if institutions are going to play here and regulations come, well, I think you have a greater degree of control and ability to prioritize certain things, like KYc insurance, controlling who actually can interact in the l two.
00:13:35.724 - 00:14:04.154, Speaker A: You know, they're calling it permissionless. But my hunch is that there's going to be some elements here that if you want to play in this base, you're going to have to comply with certain things. And I think the second hypothesis that I have that I'll borrow from an unnamed person that I saw in a chat was maybe they'll offload a lot of the tokens to the cell, too, assuming that some tokens become problematic to have in the main platform, coinbase. So I don't know what you think of all that.
00:14:05.014 - 00:14:40.878, Speaker B: So the second part is. So there's this qualified custodian regulation that's going into effect. And part of that regulation is going to, I think we'll say that qualified custodians can only hold certain tokens. So you could see the long tail getting offloaded there. I would actually just actually go back to Brian, arm your thing about focus and Zuckerberg and focusing on the social network, until they mastered the social network, and then they moved on to other things. There's this blog post that Jesse mentioned at one point in time, the Coinbase secret master plan from Brian. I don't know if you've ever actually read this.
00:14:40.878 - 00:15:16.242, Speaker B: It's from September of 2016, before the 2017 bull market, before everything ripped, before all these people came into crypto. September 2016, which keep in mind, as you remember, was only one year after Ethereum went live. And he lays out these, like, four he basically says, I'm going to outloan. I'm going to outline where crypto is headed and how the world will come to have an open financial system. There's going to be four major phases, and here's what we're going to do in each of them. He goes, phase number one, we got to develop the protocol. There's only a million people, Max, who are going to, like, be involved in that stage.
00:15:16.242 - 00:15:41.996, Speaker B: We got to develop the protocol. And that was Ethereum, like bitcoin and ETH get invented. Phase two, build a crypto exchange that can reach 10 million people. And in that phase, this again 2016, before the market rips. So that's what they did. 2017, Coinbase was like the go to place to buy and sell crypto. So they built, they did, they executed on phase two, build a crypto exchange that reached you ten, exercise that reached 10 million people.
00:15:41.996 - 00:16:19.440, Speaker B: Phase three, you ten x the size again, 100 million people, build a mass market interface for crypto apps. And six over six years later, six and a half years later, they have 108 million users. The man just nailed it, like six and a half years. He just called a shot and he crushed it. And they built this mass market interface for crypto apps, and that's Coinbase today. And now we're going into phase four, which is build the apps of open finance of an open financial system where you ten x the size again to reach a billion people. And this Coinbase announcement of building an l two fits directly into that.
00:16:19.440 - 00:16:48.790, Speaker B: So I think it's a brilliant. I'm very long, like, I just. I think it's a brilliant, brilliant build by Coinbase. And I just, like, tip my cap to Jesse and to Will and Brian and the whole team. I think it's a game changer. It's an l two ready to bring crypto to 100 plus million registered users on Coinbase. EVM equivalents, gasless transactions, APIs, account abstraction, native bridging professional RPC nodes from day one, like, boom.
00:16:48.790 - 00:16:51.634, Speaker B: You just can't get tough to get better than that right now.
00:16:53.454 - 00:17:07.794, Speaker A: Yeah, look, I mean, a lot of this stuff is. I reserve judgment because when I see it, I think I'll have a better opinion on a lot of these things. Nonetheless, it is really encouraging to see Coinbase move in this direction, contribute to the.
00:17:08.254 - 00:17:09.734, Speaker B: You're less excited about this than I am.
00:17:09.774 - 00:17:15.634, Speaker A: No, look, I mean, look, I'm an investor in arbitrum, and so the question is, I asked him, and so, look, I have some bias.
00:17:16.014 - 00:17:18.630, Speaker B: I was really curious about this. I know, we're going to. We're bringing them on for.
00:17:18.662 - 00:17:50.266, Speaker A: Well, I reached out to Steve, I reached out to Steven. And so what do you think of this? I'll let him speak because I want to bring him on next week or when we do it. I think we're due for an empire pod on arbitrary. There's a lot of cool stuff happening. I was very curious to hear from Coinbase team what they thought about the existing l two ecosystem, just generally, and the rationale behind building on the op stack, which I wasn't really familiar with. I mean, it's fairly recent. They just kind of announced it.
00:17:50.266 - 00:18:07.694, Speaker A: Right. A lot of stuff happening behind the scenes. But this was news to me. But look, net net, I think, is still very positive, right. Where we covered to some extent, which I don't fully still understand, is base acting as this bridge. Right. It's not only about optimism, it's just bridging everything, really.
00:18:07.694 - 00:18:40.116, Speaker A: And so, look, I don't want to dis, I don't want to come across. I'm not excited about this. I'm super excited about this primarily because I hope and wish that other companies like Coinbase, like, start doing more of this stuff. Like, I know that Kraken, I think, has some grants and like, supports some, like core devs, a bitcoin and a few others. Like, I'm not. But still, I think, like, this is, this is, I think, some. One of the best moves of a coinbase, of a company contributing to like, an open source network protocol like Ethereum.
00:18:40.116 - 00:18:44.816, Speaker A: So, yeah, let me.
00:18:44.840 - 00:19:08.004, Speaker B: Let me make the business case here. Instead of just. Cause I've seen a lot of twitter posts being like, this is great. Like, shout out to Brian and Coinbase. Like, they're contributing to open source code and they're contributing to the community, blah, blah, blah. Let me make the Wall street argument here. Let me make the revenue argument, which is right now you have a bunch of l two s that make over 100 million in revenue a year on sequencer fees.
00:19:08.004 - 00:19:43.314, Speaker B: Even in a bear market with less than like half a million users, you've got these l two s making $100 million a year on sequencer fees. Now, there's obviously, there's probably, let's call it a 20% to 30% margin on that. They probably pay like on 100 million in revenue, probably 70 to 80 million, just settling those fees to the, to the l one. But still, it's a really large top line binance, like BNB binance chain did over a million dollars in fees yesterday alone. They have roughly the same volume as arbitrum in terms of transaction scale. So that's, they did 1.2 million fees.
00:19:43.314 - 00:20:19.006, Speaker B: If you bake that out for a year, that's like $440 million a year of revenue in a down market. And I think there's no reason that the base chain, or base, whatever they're calling it, base, can't do a similar amount just on, on chain fees. Not including all the other stuff that they'll probably do, like real world assets and like on ramping and things like that. That's almost half a million dollar. Excuse me, half a billion dollars a year of additional revenue in a down market. So it was just one of the funny things for me was seeing Wall Street. I think Coinbase's stock was down like one or 2% today.
00:20:19.006 - 00:20:23.234, Speaker B: This, like Wall street just has no idea how to price.
00:20:24.054 - 00:20:27.414, Speaker A: They're so stupid. I mean, like, they no idea how to price.
00:20:27.454 - 00:20:44.124, Speaker B: And I see something that will spit off an additional half a billion dollars a year in fees from this l two. And they see them competing. The commentary I heard was like, they see them competing with their own business. I'm like, man, you guys are just really missing the force for the trees here.
00:20:44.984 - 00:20:52.724, Speaker A: Yeah. Not only that, but it's again, this idea of you're going to onboard, like you're going to forex your user base.
00:20:54.104 - 00:20:54.552, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:20:54.608 - 00:21:36.824, Speaker A: My potentially, like think of probabilities, right. But all the focus should be as the industry is really the next bull markets can be predicated on like macro side and all the speculation side. But, but like the long term thesis of the space, I think starts and ends. If you believe truly one thing that we can build killer products that people use and love, like hold it, not absent holding bitcoin, not like as a macro head, whatever, but like web three. Do you believe that, that people are gonna, and this is where like a lot of people are really skeptical on like show me what people are using here. Even Jesse said, look, I try to use crypto every day. I kind of use it four or five times a week.
00:21:36.824 - 00:21:47.020, Speaker A: There's like, admittedly like few apps that exist today that like people are using on the daily. Like, you know, I can assure you stubbed land my daily life.
00:21:47.172 - 00:21:47.556, Speaker B: I'm not.
00:21:47.580 - 00:22:37.854, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Look, with account abstraction, like envision a world with account abstraction that just kind of removes a lot of the friction of how you interact in this space and set up and manage your keys and all that jazz. And then you just kind of remove that stress from your life and then you just focus on, hey, look, I want to interact and play these games like Illuvium or go on a walk and you step in or you name it. Right? I think this is the cycle, this is the time where you and I have seen them. We've had these people on the podcast that they're focused on building beautiful, really engaging, front facing consumer applications.
00:22:38.194 - 00:23:07.438, Speaker B: Yeah. I have three arguments. If I was talking to a traditional investor about this, that's not like, oh, Coinbase is really doing good for the community. One argument why this is powerful is because the fee thing that I just mentioned. The second is real world assets. Um, if you believe that real world assets will come to crypto, this is now the obvious place to do it. Right? Given base, chain has account abstraction, Coinbase.
00:23:07.438 - 00:23:43.658, Speaker B: Coinbase has KYC AML data for 100 million users. They can now really easily launch real world assets on chain, restrict it to just approved wallets or just accredited investors, whatever it may be. And that would really easily let you put securities on chain. So that's the second thing that I think is just really exciting about this. And then the third thing would be, I mean, we just. You missed this episode, but we had a staking episode that will go live on Monday, I think it is with the. With rocket Pool and actually the lead, the guy who runs staking, John, guy who runs staking at Coinbase.
00:23:43.658 - 00:24:07.894, Speaker B: So Cbeth is going to be pushed heavily on base. And this is just another big revenue winner for Coinbase. There is to try to make Cve the de facto liquid staking derivative for ETH. So pushing CB real world assets and multiple hundreds of millions in fees. I don't know. I think this is a great move for Coinbase.
00:24:08.494 - 00:24:35.494, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. I'm going to ask you a question, which I'm still thinking through. One, why wouldn't this work? Like, in one year from now, we look back and because, you know, like, the Coinbase NFT marketplace was a total flop. It didn't get any traction. And so the question to you is, why would base not work to. What does that do to the other l two s in the space, including optimism?
00:24:39.434 - 00:25:05.204, Speaker B: Right now, Coinbase is the only. It's a very centralized l two. It is a centralized l two. Coinbase is the only sequencer. Eventually, they will decentralize the block building. And you asked this great question near the end of Jesse about decision making and how decisions get made right now. He gave the, I think, pr friendly answer.
00:25:05.204 - 00:25:24.180, Speaker B: But, like, right now, they're the only sequencer on the chain, and eventually they'll decentralize the block building, but they haven't yet. And so if I was building, and I was like, very pro crypto native and I, like, I'd probably build on, like, optimism or I'd build on arbitrum.
00:25:24.372 - 00:25:52.618, Speaker A: The counter argument of that is USDC. Look at what happened there, right? Like, you know, at the very beginning, people were like, so against it. And a big cohort was like, God, even I remember trying to onboard it as collateral maker during March 2020. And for a long time, people were like, this is centralized. Like, there's Dai, this is counter, the ethos. And then now it's just become like the number one stable coin.
00:25:52.816 - 00:25:53.406, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:25:53.510 - 00:25:55.354, Speaker A: Here's a value convenience. Right?
00:25:56.174 - 00:26:31.512, Speaker B: Okay, let me ask you this. What does, if you're building a defi application, what does launching in Polygon or on polygon versus launching on Solana give you? That? Like, traditional non crypto stuff doesn't give you, like, if I launch a fintech app versus launching a Dex, I'm trying to lead you into an answer that I want you to give, but maybe I'll just answer my own question, which is, girlfriend, it gives you instant liquidity. It gives you a boatload of, like, launching a fintech app, you start at zero, you got, you got no users. You got to go run a bunch of.
00:26:31.528 - 00:26:33.736, Speaker A: Facebook is a beautiful thing.
00:26:33.880 - 00:26:48.644, Speaker B: Go acquire those users. When you launch on Solana or on arbitrum or on optimism or on directly on ETH, you've got baked in users from day one. And I'm like, I hear myself getting too excited about this, the issue.
00:26:48.804 - 00:26:57.004, Speaker A: But the retention piece is harder because the barriers to exit and entry are so low, they're quick.
00:26:57.044 - 00:27:37.174, Speaker B: Okay, so what I'm trying to get at, though, is that, you know, your point is 108 million registered coinbase users to tap into. And when I heard Jesse say that they were thinking about the ad market, the ad mark. What? Why were they thinking about an ad market? Because they've got 108 million users and then you've got all these founders and devs over here and there's a disconnect. So what the admark had done is they would have connected projects with 108 million users. So I'm like, if I'm debating where to build, I'm like, oh, man. Coinbase is clearly thinking about ways to get my project in front of those 108 million users, which would excite me a lot.
00:27:38.234 - 00:28:13.460, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a great point that you bring out the ad because during the episode will really kind of mentioned the sequence because Jesse was like, I had all these ideas, including an out network, and Will said, you're not wrong on any of them. It's just sort of, the sequence was off. And I think you're absolutely right, which is you have build base first, then do everything else. Yeah, but you're right. I mean, it's gonna be really interesting. I haven't seen which protocols from day one like, are going to be on base, but I think it's the majors. And I wouldn't be surprised if it's like the compound Aave uniswap and a bunch of others.
00:28:13.460 - 00:28:51.170, Speaker A: But yeah, I mean, the allure of. Because we to some extent talk about aggregation theory here, and whoever who controls a user commands a lot of power. And in this case, like BNB as an example. Right, like Binance has launched their own chain, I guess is a good analogy. And there was a time where BNB as a chain had way more transactions. Pancakeswap had more users and transactions in uniswap. At some point the activities dwindled a bit, but just goes to show how it's so powerful.
00:28:51.170 - 00:29:26.480, Speaker A: Binance is the number one exchange in the world in number of users and volume. Launching their own chain was something that they did. And CZ is a smart guy. And the traction that you got because they own the user, it's just so easy, right? They're going to push all their users to go to base as opposed to withdraw arbitrum or polygon or Solana or whatever. And not only that, but the app ecosystem. I think they're going to curate and create a safe environment and actually a one where they're going to probably support a lot of projects. So I'm really excited to see that.
00:29:26.480 - 00:30:11.114, Speaker A: I think a lot of times, you know, when I talk to new users and do the education piece of crypto, they're like, I need handholding. I need someone to tell me, these are the apps that you, you know, the suggested apps. When you buy a smartphone, there's certain apps that are preloaded. And I think in this case Coinbase is also going to do that in web three. Some, some apps by default, safe, trusted apps. And I think that's what's needed for a large number of users. Like the 80%, 90% of users in their first time should probably go through a handholding exercise and in a safe environment.
00:30:11.114 - 00:30:48.922, Speaker A: And if base can do that, then great, right? I'm not, you know, to be fair, all the l two gurus out there, you know, you look at Poly, when we talk about decentralization, it's always easier to say, hey, wait a minute. It's going to be controlled by Coinbase. I'm like, yeah, guys, but let's talk about the sequencer of all the other l two s and fraud proofs. Are there fraud proofs in optimism? Who controls the sequencer? There are reorgs in Polygon. This tech is not perfect. Right. So I'm just.
00:30:48.922 - 00:30:54.202, Speaker A: You know, we should. I'm really optimistic about all these.
00:30:54.258 - 00:30:54.898, Speaker B: All these things.
00:30:54.946 - 00:30:59.114, Speaker A: But, you know, the tech is still fairly on, you know, nascent. We'll get there.
00:30:59.194 - 00:31:11.470, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. I mean, most l two s have this centralized sequencer run by the foundation or the lab rock proof. And, yeah, they have a roadmap to.
00:31:11.502 - 00:31:17.774, Speaker A: Decentralize Eigen layer episode. Go talk to that. We just told the guy, listen, how is this going to work? A committee of people. Okay, great.
00:31:17.814 - 00:31:21.554, Speaker B: So. Okay, so it's centralized. All right, let me. Let me ask you this.
00:31:21.894 - 00:31:27.754, Speaker A: So you've got this whole affirmative decentralization. No, I don't want to just throw shaded. I can make it whatever.
00:31:28.294 - 00:31:47.194, Speaker B: You have this whole app chain thesis, which has primarily been a cosmos dominated thesis, and I'm curious if you think that base is the start of, like, the app chain thesis becoming possible on Ethereum as well.
00:31:50.854 - 00:31:52.634, Speaker A: But I don't know what that means. Right.
00:31:52.934 - 00:31:54.234, Speaker B: Let me. Here, let me.
00:31:55.174 - 00:32:15.706, Speaker A: Different l two s. Is that like, an app chain? No. Right. Cause you're still using the base chain. Like, when I think of app chain, it's like a totally different architecture. Like, I'm speaking out of my. It's like, monolithic versus, like.
00:32:15.706 - 00:32:26.338, Speaker A: You mean, like, it's a different architecture. I think when you talk about app chain thesis versus an l two, still settling in an l one. Does that make sense?
00:32:26.506 - 00:32:27.242, Speaker B: Yeah, it does make sense.
00:32:27.258 - 00:32:29.722, Speaker A: I don't even think that maybe the distinctions even matter.
00:32:29.778 - 00:32:29.994, Speaker B: Right.
00:32:30.034 - 00:32:31.432, Speaker A: But, yeah.
00:32:31.568 - 00:32:34.724, Speaker B: Yeah, I think I get basically about, like.
00:32:35.664 - 00:32:53.776, Speaker A: I guess, like, to put it in concrete terms. You have a team that was pretty important in the theory. I'm called Dy DX. That decided to leave. That decided to go and build their own chain. And they picked cosmos. Yeah, Cosmos SDK tendermint consensus.
00:32:53.776 - 00:33:06.484, Speaker A: Bft is fairly. Fairly battle tested. People should go and listen to the episode with Zaki and what's. We did a cosmos episode.
00:33:06.524 - 00:33:07.772, Speaker B: Jack. Jack and.
00:33:07.788 - 00:33:08.124, Speaker A: Jack.
00:33:08.204 - 00:33:08.460, Speaker B: Yes.
00:33:08.492 - 00:33:10.748, Speaker A: Sorry, Jack and.
00:33:10.916 - 00:33:11.236, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:33:11.260 - 00:33:21.304, Speaker A: DyDX left Ethereum, and they decided to build their own chain because they just said, look, Ethereum right now is unusable, and we can't really. It's not like. It's not viable for us.
00:33:21.664 - 00:33:25.484, Speaker B: And so they didn't just leave Ethereum, they left an l two. They left starkware.
00:33:25.824 - 00:33:46.484, Speaker A: Yeah, totally. Like, they abandoned ethereum, then they just went to Cosmos, built their own chain to control a lot of parameters. And look, I think the question that we should kind of revisit over time is, are we going to see these teams come back and build on base and abandon their product? And they're abandoned their.
00:33:47.024 - 00:33:47.552, Speaker B: You know what I mean?
00:33:47.568 - 00:34:13.086, Speaker A: Like, I guess the question is, if DyDx were to do this over again, this exercise of the pros and cons of staying in ethereum, maybe even building their own l two or going to Cosmos and building their own chain, it would be interesting to see how that would play out with base live. I don't know if it changed the calculus, but maybe something we can ask Antonio from Dydx or some other people that have thought about this.
00:34:13.270 - 00:34:23.063, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. I don't know. Any other thoughts on Coinbase? No.
00:34:23.363 - 00:34:33.023, Speaker A: No, I don't think so. Timing wise, you probably know this better than I do, but it sounds like relatively soon, that is, next month, they'll launch beta.
00:34:33.683 - 00:34:35.063, Speaker B: Well, no, they're in test.
00:34:35.563 - 00:34:36.823, Speaker A: They're in decent now.
00:34:37.163 - 00:34:39.813, Speaker B: You can bridge over. You can go to base.org and bridge.
00:34:40.003 - 00:34:40.401, Speaker A: Got it.
00:34:40.417 - 00:34:42.889, Speaker B: Test net assets over. Yeah, got it.
00:34:42.921 - 00:34:43.433, Speaker A: Okay.
00:34:43.553 - 00:34:44.065, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:34:44.169 - 00:34:48.377, Speaker A: No and no token. So, guys, there's no base token. Don't be scammed.
00:34:48.505 - 00:35:06.813, Speaker B: Oh, oh, you know what I realized, you know, I. This is so dumb of me that I didn't. It was probably obvious to everyone else except for me. So Coinbase's ticker is coin base. Eventually there'll probably be a base token. So you got coin base base. Was this, was this super obvious to everyone? Maybe I'd.
00:35:06.813 - 00:35:15.180, Speaker B: I just put that down. All right, base token is dollar sign base. Then you got dollar sign coin. We got dollar sign Coinbase.
00:35:15.372 - 00:35:42.216, Speaker A: Yeah, true, true, true. We asked him if they were going to launch a token. They've been fairly clear and binary here that there won't be a token, but again, they leave the vector open. I think that over time, if there's a committee and the committee decides to launch a token, then you presumably could see a token. But, but, but folks, please, don't be scammed. There is no base token. Don't be led otherwise, and don't give your coins some scammer out there that is telling you to, like, claim a base token.
00:35:42.216 - 00:35:42.960, Speaker A: There is no base.
00:35:42.992 - 00:35:52.044, Speaker B: Yeah. Why do you think they only had one sequencer from day one? Like, why didn't they just like, surely they could have had more folks get involved from day one.
00:35:52.464 - 00:36:11.084, Speaker A: My assumption is that they'll probably very quickly add more people that are in their institutional validator sets, like they acquired bison trails to allow large enterprises to run their own validator. I'm thinking that they're probably going to tap into that network to decentralize the sequencer.
00:36:15.264 - 00:36:43.414, Speaker B: Okay. Yeah. Then I guess on the no token, people's probably biggest question there is, like, okay, well, if you don't have a token, how are you incentivizing the validators? My understanding is that there are no value. This could be totally off. There are no validators. The signed transactions will be sent to Coinbase, who centrally manages the sequencer in the state. They periodically checkpoint the state back to mainnet using the optimistic roll up.
00:36:43.414 - 00:36:48.494, Speaker B: Eventually, we want to have validators, but not yet. Is that your understanding of it?
00:36:48.874 - 00:36:50.394, Speaker A: That is my understanding of it.
00:36:50.474 - 00:36:52.134, Speaker B: Okay. Okay. Yeah.
00:36:52.474 - 00:36:55.184, Speaker A: The key there is the fraud proof. I think.
00:36:58.044 - 00:37:01.476, Speaker B: I got to dig in. I don't. I'm going to talk out of my ass if I keep going here.
00:37:01.500 - 00:37:02.188, Speaker A: Me too.
00:37:02.356 - 00:37:02.724, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:37:02.764 - 00:37:06.144, Speaker A: So please, YouTube commentary, please. Crucify whatever you just said.
00:37:06.444 - 00:37:08.324, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I would love to know.
00:37:08.404 - 00:37:10.264, Speaker A: We're entering unqualified territory.
00:37:12.924 - 00:37:20.284, Speaker B: Fullback. You know? All right. You know, it's funny. So, like, Mike. So we have this plot. We have another podcast at blockers called Belt Curve.
00:37:20.324 - 00:37:25.452, Speaker A: And it's like, I don't know what that is. We don't talk about other episodes. I left.
00:37:25.508 - 00:37:32.548, Speaker B: I left. We're allowed to. We're allowed to. Uh. I I'm abandoned. I've abandoned that ship. But this season's on app trains, and next season's on.
00:37:32.548 - 00:37:49.084, Speaker B: On Mev. And so Mike has been spending his weekends, uh, like, studying Mev, basically. Like, I was. I was actually out bowling on Saturday, and, uh, he's sending me all these, like, videos and stuff of. Of Mev. And I was like, not. Not the time, buddy.
00:37:49.084 - 00:38:19.884, Speaker B: But he's like, yeah, I'm locked in. I'm learning about Mev. And then as the text kept coming, it was like, you know what? Like, Mev is reminding me I need to, like, go back and relearn how Ethereum works at, like, a core level. And I don't know, actually reading about this, like, coin, like, seeing what coinbase is launching. I was like, wait, so if you don't have a token who validates the validate? How do you incentivize? And I was like, oh, man, might be good for a refresher. I'm like, how this stuff all works. I don't know if you ever find yourself in that boat.
00:38:19.884 - 00:38:20.944, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:38:21.024 - 00:38:27.944, Speaker A: What do you think I do on the weekends? Like, I don't go bowling, dude, I would.
00:38:27.984 - 00:38:28.880, Speaker B: I would run your show.
00:38:28.952 - 00:38:30.040, Speaker A: Do you have bowling shoes?
00:38:30.152 - 00:38:30.904, Speaker B: I was.
00:38:31.064 - 00:38:37.408, Speaker A: Are you the kind of guy that shows up with his, like, bag this ball, and just bowling shoes? I just have bowling shoes. Like, when you go skiing, you want.
00:38:37.416 - 00:38:38.432, Speaker B: To have your boots.
00:38:38.608 - 00:38:48.856, Speaker A: I'm not. Just the fact that you're not even telling me this. Just, you're, you're, you're pleading the fifth, but you're admitted. You're admitting guilt by, like, cleaning the cloud.
00:38:49.040 - 00:38:53.040, Speaker B: Have. I have big feet. And when I have put on those, I mean, I put on Jason's like.
00:38:53.112 - 00:38:55.200, Speaker A: What are you, six?
00:38:55.352 - 00:38:57.912, Speaker B: You're six up there. Yeah, six four.
00:38:58.088 - 00:39:08.048, Speaker A: You def, oh, you're claiming that. You see, this is the cop out. You're claiming that you have bowling shoes, because somehow when you go bowling, they never have your sides. So this is like a flex.
00:39:08.176 - 00:39:09.312, Speaker B: This is a flex.
00:39:09.488 - 00:39:24.214, Speaker A: I'm calling you on this flex. God, dude, let's go. I'm gonna keep you focused. No, you have bowling ball and you have bowling shoes. Good lord. Folks, I'm leaving empire. I cannot fundamentally be with someone moral of the stories.
00:39:24.254 - 00:39:28.750, Speaker B: We're going bowling and permissionless, that's. We're putting an ETH on the game.
00:39:28.902 - 00:40:03.034, Speaker C: Hey, everyone, quick break from Empire to tell you about another blockworks channel that I know you're gonna love. I've been in crypto full time for five years and have always struggled with one thing, which is keeping up with the next big trend. As soon as I wrap my head around Mev, we're on to app chains. As soon as I wrap my head around app chains, we're on to liquid staking derivatives. I'm sure you've been there. Blockworks Research has solved that problem for me. Our team puts research, data governance proposal, updates, models and more into one really easy to use platform.
00:40:03.034 - 00:40:18.584, Speaker C: So I can always stay ahead of the curve if I don't understand something. For example, I just bought the platform. I can search for an L one. I can search for a protocol. Pull up the platform@blockworksresearch.com. I searched the term. There's always an amazing amount of insight in a really consumable way.
00:40:18.584 - 00:40:42.950, Speaker C: Right now, you can subscribe to the platform. It's $2,500 a year or $900 a quarter. Hopefully, you can make more than $208 a month by using the platform. If you can't, you're probably in the wrong business. But if you're not ready to subscribe to the platform today, you can subscribe to the research team free newsletter. You can follow their twitter handles today links in the show notes. Trust me, once you do that, you're going to want to subscribe to the platform.
00:40:42.950 - 00:40:59.994, Speaker C: If you are ready to subscribe right now, I got you guys with a little hookup. Empire listeners get a 10% discount for the first 50 people who use the code Empire. Ten got you back. Check out the links in the description to find out more. Now let's get back to the show.
00:41:02.594 - 00:41:31.542, Speaker B: All right, so moving past that there was moving right along. This is, I want to talk about Polygon, actually. Yeah, there were two Polygon things that happened this week. One is Polygon laid off 20% of the team, which was, I think, about 100 positions. So I think they had about 500 employees. They laid off 20% per Sandeep's tweet. Everyone received three months of severance, et cetera.
00:41:31.542 - 00:42:07.394, Speaker B: So that was one thing. Is Polygon laid off 20% then also, I really haven't looked into this reorg or what it was, but I'm sure the blockworks team has dug in. I just need to read about it. But Hayden Adams of Uniswap tweeted, out he goes, Polygon needs to make moves publicly to solve its reorg problem. 157 block reorg, which is about five minutes of history yesterday and 120 in December is bad. It can break bridges, centralized exchanges, et cetera. Maybe we need a consensus algorithm change or a social consensus based hard fork to slash the validators.
00:42:07.394 - 00:42:37.616, Speaker B: And then jaunty, who's one of the co founders of Polygon, tweeted, this is in progress in two parts. The first is already in the main net since January. Yesterday's reorg was caused due to a bug which will be fixed soon. Then obviously Emin from avalanche tweeted out, the solution that makes the most sense is an avalanche subnet. You dont say. Im just curious what you make of it. Seems like all things were very rosy at Polygon because they were winning a bunch of big brand deals that got a bunch of headlines.
00:42:37.616 - 00:42:42.284, Speaker B: And now people are maybe realizing that things are a bit more chaotic over there than folks realized.
00:42:43.304 - 00:43:29.960, Speaker A: Yeah, reorders are real. They've happened before. This is always something that I was thinking about while people in the Ethereum community are giving Solana a hard time for outages that seem to happen every month in a kind of regular cadence. But yeah, look, this is an invitation for someone to Polygon to come up and step up and talk about this stuff. I admittedly don't interact much in Polygon for this reason. Like, I've done some stuff, but if you track, like, my activity on chain, my footprint is fairly limited historically to what I've done in polygon. But again, I just feel more comfortable in a different type of l two.
00:43:29.960 - 00:43:36.484, Speaker A: An optimistic roll up arbitram or optimism.
00:43:36.904 - 00:43:38.916, Speaker B: Yes. I just thought it was a deep.
00:43:39.000 - 00:43:42.864, Speaker A: The security, the security guarantee. Like, it's just. It's just different.
00:43:43.324 - 00:43:56.452, Speaker B: It's a different. I thought it was a. It was a reminder that whatever built what folks are building here is deeply technical and you can have the best biz dev in the game, but if your blockchain is missing transactions and you have to reorg twice in three months, like, that's an issue.
00:43:56.548 - 00:44:37.814, Speaker A: So, yeah, so this is interesting because we had Camila and, and talking, yeah. Talking about, like, she's at serotonin, and they focused a lot on convincing big brands to enter the space. And either issue, nfts, largely nfts, it's like Reddit and Tiffany's of the world and nikes and whatever. And my question to them was, how much are these corporates in their RFP list? Valuing, ranking, security, decentralization security. It was like, nah, not really. I think they're just going where the users are, and this is where BD becomes important. It's sort of like a reflexive in some capacity.
00:44:37.814 - 00:45:24.298, Speaker A: If Polygon has a lot of users, then if reorganics happen, but they're not losing users, then I guess the brand just kind of overlooks that. I do think that over time, this needs to be addressed, and if it's not, then it really just hinders the long term viability of polygon, really delivering to a lot of the expectations that these brands are. They'll just go elsewhere, they'll deploy elsewhere. The nice thing about this space is that I think what you've seen is a lot of brands just migrate over to different chains. It's fairly easy. I think we should focus on this. I think we should have Sandeep or someone from the Polygon team come on and talk about this and what their long term strategies to fix this and address this issue.
00:45:24.496 - 00:46:05.502, Speaker B: Yeah, it was bad week for them with the reorgan layoffs. What I didn't get is why? No, not so, like when Solana has an outage or a reorg or whatever, or like if ETH had an outage or like, optimism had a reorg or something, like that, everybody would be talking about it. And I didn't see anyone talking about, you know, it's a big reorg, it's a 150 block reorg. Nobody on Twitter was talking about it, which I'm like, I was probably too optimistic on Coinbase stuff. Now I'm probably digging into polygon too much. But, like, that tells me that there aren't as many people using Polygon. And I think they've been winning a bunch of these brand deals.
00:46:05.502 - 00:46:17.334, Speaker B: But, like, crypto is a bottoms up game, and you got to win the bottoms up game, too. You can't just go top down with it. And you saw a lot of people make that mistake in 2017, trying to go super top down, winning the big brands, and look where they're at now.
00:46:17.374 - 00:47:00.784, Speaker A: So, no, it's a great point. Sometimes we're used to hearing these bd can sometimes triumph over the best tech. Betamax VHS is a prime example. But I think that that analogy doesn't really apply in web three, where the only reason why you want to build something is because you value security, and that's the number one priority, decentralization. Otherwise, just stick to web two guys, just don't even bother coming here unless you want to capture extract value. Like, if you're a mark, like a brand that you want to be around and issue nfts and like, acquire users, fine. But still, in the long term, if your chain's breaking, like, there's a lot of harm that's done.
00:47:00.784 - 00:47:44.524, Speaker A: And so I think ultimately this is why the case for Ethereum long term today is probably the strongest thesis as a prevailing kind of network because it's so battle tested, there's a Lindy effect. And you know, like, if your chain's not secure, real continue to happen, forget about it. Like, it doesn't matter. Like, this is why we've had a number of episodes this year, talk about security, because it is the most important thing. There's other folks that don't believe that. I truly believe that. Like, if we don't nail security and we don't build confidence that these things are truly decentralized, permissionless or immutable, then, like, close shop and go back to web two.
00:47:44.524 - 00:48:34.194, Speaker A: Otherwise it's a really inefficient web to crappy stuff, you're never going to compete. The only reason why you want to build this stuff is this is why I like DeFi is such a killer use case. Because when you're settling billions of dollars, you don't want to have counter, you want to minimize counterpart risk. That was my whole thesis for DeFi early on. It's like you saw bitcoin people really valued being able to move large sums of money and settle, you know, cross border, like their immense use case and DeFi, the idea of settling billions of dollars or executing certain transactions with if then statements like programming money and removing counterparty risk is, is the killer use case. And if that's it, I think we'll still build tremendous amount of value that's not even reflected in the total market cap of crypto. Now, how that composite that is composed.
00:48:34.194 - 00:49:22.294, Speaker A: I've always thought that the percentage of DeFi encompasses of the total crypto market cap is grossly, grossly undervalued just because that is today the killer killer use case of Ethereum. We talk about NFTs as a transfer of value that is still defi like you're collecting, but it's value, so it's transfer value, so it encompasses. I'm including that in the, the use case. So, yes, really important reminder that, you know, we can't lose sight of, of. There's still a lot of work that needs to be done. It is as Jesse Walden first coined it, I believe he's now at variant investing, previously at a 16 c, but he really coined this term, which is progressive decentralization. And I think this is the way things should work.
00:49:22.294 - 00:49:48.480, Speaker A: But I think the time eventually runs out if you don't progressively decentralize. And it is sort of like attention, right. Because when you try to push it too far, you might lose grip on product development and building. Like, the question is, okay, polygon can progressively decentralize and speed that up, but that's not necessarily going to fix reorgs. Right. That still is very much the core team. Right.
00:49:48.480 - 00:50:01.552, Speaker A: That needs to focus that. So, yeah, it's kind of a bit of attention of decentralized, but also kind of building the product. And the product still needs to come a long way for 99.9% of all the crypto protocols out there.
00:50:01.728 - 00:50:09.164, Speaker B: Yeah. All right, there's some other news of the week that I thought was noteworthy. One is Gloria capital shutting down.
00:50:10.064 - 00:50:19.096, Speaker A: This is no goal. No, not Golib, Kevin. Yeah, but is that how you pronounce it go?
00:50:19.200 - 00:50:20.288, Speaker B: I don't know. Galloway.
00:50:20.376 - 00:50:21.790, Speaker A: Galloway's. Galloway's.
00:50:21.952 - 00:50:22.442, Speaker B: I don't know.
00:50:22.458 - 00:50:25.242, Speaker A: I think Galloway's. Galloway scallows. Galloway. Galloway.
00:50:25.298 - 00:50:29.490, Speaker B: What? What is that? I don't know what that is. What does it sound like?
00:50:29.522 - 00:50:35.906, Speaker A: Alois Galloway. I used to trade with these guys. Gallows, Kevin Galois.
00:50:36.010 - 00:50:41.370, Speaker B: It's a French, he's a french mathematician and political activist from the 18 hundreds.
00:50:41.482 - 00:50:45.506, Speaker A: Scalia's now, and he died now 20 years that I mispronounced it for so long.
00:50:45.570 - 00:51:15.072, Speaker B: He died when he was 21 years old. So anyways, I wonder if, anyways, anywho, uh, Galois Gallowees, however you want to pronounce it. Uh, there were rumors that they had their money dropped on FTX, and sure enough, it just, uh, came out and said that the fund is no longer viable. They had half the assets trapped on, on FTX and they're shutting down. So about, I think it was fund was around like 200 million. And they also, they're, I mean, it sounds like you trade with them. I think they were a market maker as well.
00:51:15.072 - 00:51:57.170, Speaker B: Um, and I don't know, I just, I was actually pretty sad to see this. Like, Kevin, who runs Gloise, we'll call him glories, was one of the first to have identified and warned everyone in crypto about terra Luna and like, the risk to like, the algorithmic stable coin. And um, it's just a bummer because like he's so, he nailed it. He nailed the risks before, like, most people saw it, and yet he still got trapped on FTX. And I think it's like for, I hope people remember him for pointing out the terra Luna risk. I'm sure lb bag is a super smart guy. And I would also just say, I did see some people saying, well, why did they have so much of their aum on FTX? I think that fails to understand the market making business.
00:51:57.170 - 00:52:05.986, Speaker B: And if you're going to make markets, you got to have your assets somewhere. And FTX made sense for him. So I don't know, I feel bad for Kevin.
00:52:06.010 - 00:52:37.694, Speaker A: Yeah, so unfortunate he said, and intimated that this was not the end of what he was doing, but I understand why shut down the fund he returned, I think it was like other half of his assets run FTX. The other half, he returned 90% to investors. And I think even after that big haircut, their investors still came out positive. So if that is true, kudos. And we hope that we haven't lost a good soul in space and he will continue and come back in some other capacity.
00:52:38.144 - 00:52:42.160, Speaker B: So, yeah, let's see what else happened.
00:52:42.352 - 00:52:50.968, Speaker A: Interesting there. Oh, no, that was interesting there. He sold, he sold half of, he sold his stake and FTX it is.
00:52:51.016 - 00:52:52.204, Speaker B: You just shush me.
00:52:53.424 - 00:53:22.106, Speaker A: He just, he sold his claim that is stuck in FTX for $0.16 on the dollar. And he basically said, look, this might take years. And I'm not a bankruptcy restructuring expert, so I'll just punch out. Pretty interesting because there were some claims trading at some point in stark contrast with Madoff. In that case, you brought it up, creditors recouped $0.82 on the dollar.
00:53:22.106 - 00:53:35.054, Speaker A: $0.90 on the dollar took ten plus years, but nonetheless, just 13 years. Memable, but yeah, in this case, really interesting that he decided to punch out at $0.16.
00:53:35.364 - 00:53:39.812, Speaker B: Yeah. What else went on this week?
00:53:39.988 - 00:53:49.476, Speaker A: Oh, two, arbitram. Speaking of giving credit to another l two, arbitrum had its first day with more transaction, more transactions than ethereum. L one, a lot of stuff happened.
00:53:49.500 - 00:53:52.064, Speaker B: That's big. I mean, all activities belong to l two.
00:53:52.724 - 00:53:53.956, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, definitely.
00:53:54.020 - 00:54:27.180, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's it. What else? I think that's, oh, you're, oh, there's one other thing. Tom Emmer introduced this CBDC anti surveillance state act on Wednesday, which does three things. One is it prohibits the Fed from issuing a CBDC directly to anyone. Two is it bars the Fed from using a CBDC to implement monetary policy. And three is it requires any Fed CBDC project to be transparent to Congress and the american people. So I think, I mean, doubtful this goes anywhere.
00:54:27.180 - 00:54:59.124, Speaker B: I'd say just a bill that's being introduced, but shout out to equal bill. And I thought there was a really good Tushar tweet, Tushar from multicoin who pointed something out that I hadn't thought of. And he said a negative externality of a US CBDC is the total destruction of credit markets. Why would you keep cash at a commercial bank if you could just keep it at the Fed? But the Fed doesn't make commercial loans. So I hadn't thought about the relationship between a CBDC negatively impacting credit markets in the US.
00:54:59.774 - 00:55:42.090, Speaker A: So, yeah, the only other thing that I want to point out too, because he just got a lot of attention, was top shot. And there was a judge that denied Dapper's request to dismiss a suit that allowed them to be investigated. Or like that. Certain pieces of top, like top shots were securities. Dapper tried to contest that and tried to dismiss the suit. And you know, quote unquote, this is Dapper's response because a lot of people saying, oh, you know, this just basically is saying that nfts are securities. And like, there are some memes out there that people are saying, oh, listen, my, you know, here's my baseball card.
00:55:42.090 - 00:56:25.014, Speaker A: I'm not going to open it because, you know, SEC is going to come knocking on my door I think that was overblown. So taking a step back, I think this adapter statement, they said, importantly, today's order only denied the defendant's motion to dismiss, ie, their motion to dismiss the complaint. It did not conclude that the plaintiffs were right, meaning that top shots are securities and it is not a final ruling on the merits of the case. So it's a good reminder that there's a lot of people out there in crypto that encrypted Twitter that very quickly engagement farm and make these statements. But it's important to actually understand that. This is not to say the court ruled that the top shots were securities.
00:56:25.204 - 00:56:33.454, Speaker B: See, well, in this case, it's funny to see how fast fake news spreads. But do you want to know the original source on this one?
00:56:35.154 - 00:56:35.754, Speaker A: Enlightenment.
00:56:35.794 - 00:56:54.658, Speaker B: Bloomberg. Bloomberg. It came from the Bloomberg terminal. So the Bloomberg Bloomberg had an article, NBA top shot nfts are securities judge says in landmark case. Lovely. So it started on the Bloomberg terminal, then it went to DB tier ten k, if you know that account. And then it just read like wildfire.
00:56:54.658 - 00:56:57.094, Speaker B: So I think, I mean, Bloomberg really botched this headline.
00:56:59.034 - 00:57:01.730, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, they were just in for clickbait stuff.
00:57:01.882 - 00:57:09.106, Speaker B: Thank you. Yeah, everyone, I mean, I think they just made a mistake, but everyone's freaking out about it being classified as securities, and that's just not what this decision.
00:57:09.210 - 00:57:39.234, Speaker A: I know you guys are building, like, a media company for this reason. Maybe this is why you kind of decided to, but it's actually, like, really frustrating and disappointing. They're like, if you're a legal reporter and you read through this case, why would you write this headline? It's not like, it's just not factually correct. Am I missing something here? Like, if you were to write this headline for block works, would you write it like that?
00:57:40.254 - 00:57:56.254, Speaker B: You couldn't write it like that because it's wrong. It's fake news. But here's what happened behind the scenes. Something came out. Something behind the scenes got filed. So, like, that court case probably filed. And Bloomberg prides themselves Bloomberg because of the terminal business.
00:57:56.254 - 00:58:22.676, Speaker B: So people think of Bloomberg as, like, this big media business. They make 90% of the revenue from the terminal business, and they pride themselves on being first to the news. So, like, every media company has to decide where they win. So, like, Bloomberg wins by being first to the news. Blockworks does not win. We usually are not first to the news, but we have better insights and longer and more insightful takes than anyone in crypto. At least I'm very biased.
00:58:22.676 - 00:58:48.354, Speaker B: But that's what so like, you have to decide where you win. And that's why Bloomberg. So, but when you are racing to the news, you make mistakes. And so. But, yeah, anyways, TLDR in this case, all that happened was the motion to throw out the case was denied. And I know I've been, I've been, I've been very critical of top shot and, like, think that calling a public blockchain that has KYC is like, like, that's just not. Shouldn't.
00:58:48.354 - 00:59:09.966, Speaker B: Public blockchain shouldn't have any KYC. But anyways, calling them securities is totally ridiculous. Um, it's, uh, it's just, I mean, it's like, you don't call when I buy, like, my Barry Bonds card on eBay. Like, and I think the price is going to go up. Like, that's not, that's not a security. Why is a top shot a security? It just, I mean, it makes no sense. But they're not calling it a security.
00:59:09.966 - 00:59:13.334, Speaker B: There's. The motion to throw out the case was denied.
00:59:13.494 - 00:59:24.142, Speaker A: Yeah, interesting case nonetheless. Even when this actually goes to court. And one to follow, of course, for the NFT community. So, yeah, we'll have to keep tabs on that.
00:59:24.318 - 00:59:49.460, Speaker B: Santi, I got to jump. This was great. I forgot to plug permissionless at the beginning, so I have to do it now, which is this week. We just had our biggest ticket sale day since we launched the event. Um, yeah, so that was a, it's been a really big week for permissionless ticket sales. Uh, tickets just increased in price again. So they're now like, hold on, let me get these facts right.
00:59:49.460 - 01:00:06.494, Speaker B: I think it's like $440 for permissionless ticket. And we've been showing them since they were like $100. So, yeah, last week it was 394, today it's 441. They are going to just continue going up in price. So if you're thinking about going to permissionless, get your ticket.
01:00:07.074 - 01:00:08.374, Speaker A: Already did mine.
01:00:10.154 - 01:00:15.010, Speaker B: Did we give you a. Did we give you a free ticket or do you have to pay? You gotta pay. No, we're not waiting.
01:00:15.082 - 01:00:21.842, Speaker A: Wait, what? No, come on. No, I'm speaking. But I already booked everything else. Like, I already.
01:00:21.978 - 01:00:25.506, Speaker B: You can get a 10% discount. You can get the empire discount.
01:00:25.690 - 01:00:38.072, Speaker A: See, folks, how this, how, how my co host treats me. This is coming from a guy that has bowling shoes and a bowling ball. I'm tuning out. This has been a great episode. We learned a lot about Jason.
01:00:38.208 - 01:01:00.694, Speaker B: Hope you guys enjoyed. I hope you guys enjoyed. We will see you guys next week. We've got a super interesting episode on staking the centralized kind of player with coinbase versus decentralized player with rocket pool. They compete against each other, but they are both kind of come at the industry from the same view, saying that Lido has too much market share. I think you guys will really enjoy the episode and see you guys Monday, folks.
01:01:01.074 - 01:01:03.074, Speaker A: Thank you, folks. Have a great weekend. Thanks for listening. Cheers.
