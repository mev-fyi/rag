00:00:00.160 - 00:00:51.124, Speaker A: While we've seen a washout, a trough of disillusionment, broadly in the NFT space, we see this pocket of really fine digital artists having pockets of success, and we see what we're seeing on the ground day to day, is that global museums are leaning in to where the NFT community has left slack. So some of the biggest buyers right now of crypto punks, of really amazing, like, fine digital art from, like, Rafiq and Mike and others, have been global museums like that is. When you think about that, like, that's mind blowing. The fact that, like, the people taking up slack right now are, you know, the M pluses and the Momas and the pompey dos and, like, really, like, substantial cultural institutions, cultural gatekeepers.
00:00:53.264 - 00:01:11.528, Speaker B: Hey, everyone. Welcome to a new show. We don't have a name for it yet, but Santiago and Ryan are close friends, and we recorded two of the most listened to podcasts I've ever done with them. So we thought it's worth coming together and seeing if we could do a show together. What's going on, guys?
00:01:11.616 - 00:01:12.312, Speaker A: How you doing, bud?
00:01:12.368 - 00:01:13.000, Speaker C: Hey, Tom.
00:01:13.112 - 00:01:17.364, Speaker A: Yeah, great to be here. And let's. Let's dive in. Let's riff on this.
00:01:17.664 - 00:01:21.330, Speaker B: Let's do it. Santa, you want to give your quick overview.
00:01:21.472 - 00:02:15.474, Speaker C: I don't know who I am these days. I guess, you know, long time in the space, obviously, I've now turned my attention to education after I left parafy, you know, parafy, we were one of the first kind of funds doing just individual strategy, which is Defi, before it was a thing, and kind of before that was just angel investing in the space. And I love that kind of DNA of just being really close with teams. And sometimes in crypto, it is a very emerging asset class. And so having the flexibility, Ryan, you as well, you just manage your own capital. We both been through the, we've done the fund, and now we both now manage kind of our own capital. And I really enjoy that because, you know, crypto is sometimes, you know, it's difficult as an institutional investor to do certain things like buy NFTs or buy, or get into yield farming, if you will, or do some of these strategies.
00:02:15.474 - 00:02:52.466, Speaker C: And it's just a very emerging asset class. And so I'm still very actively investing. And one of the key priorities for me is just raising the bar for the level of discourse. What I like to describe is, I think in crypto, it serves you well to be highly curious but also highly skeptical. You constantly have to question things, and I think, yeah, that's kind of hopefully, what we try to do here is just elevate that bar and raise and have an honest, open discussion of the things that are happening in crypto and things that we're both, all three of us are seeing because we get to see so much on the investing side and just generally, yeah, I think that's.
00:02:52.490 - 00:04:09.928, Speaker A: A really great point and something that in the decade that I've been in crypto, I've tried to make a defining feature of my process of thinking through things from first principles of getting excited and getting conviction around completely novel ideas that you want to see for the intellectual curiosity of it, whether it's Ethereum or makerdao, or in recent years with NFTs and Platter and gaming with Axie and other things. The best investments that I've made over the years have always been something where what compelled me to do it was the intellectual curiosity of just wanting to pay to see the river and see this story unfold and thinking through with an independent mind from first principles perspective of what could be if you use these important primitives that crypto native values offer us, is something that has been incredibly rewarding, um, and my life's passion.
00:04:10.016 - 00:04:41.274, Speaker B: Yeah, I like your point on the intellectual side, Ryan. I, I think I was thinking about this the other day. After a couple of years investing in the space, it gets pretty easy to just take the boring route, like, you know, do all the deals every fund is in, not really care. Um, it's easy, it's easy money, it's easy, you know, tweets, stuff like that. But it's just so intellectually boring and excruciating to not have an opinion or review. And I think that's hard to stay non consensus over a long period of time. So definitely like that.
00:04:41.394 - 00:06:14.878, Speaker A: We've seen all these emerging trends over time that don't look like the last one, right? You saw capital formation trend with icos in 17, and then from there, defi summer and this idea of like, of decentralized debt and amms being able to offer yielding opportunities. And from there we see play to earn gaming emerge, which was, I think the first, like non speculative use case and digital scarcity for digital artists emerge with nfts. And those are like, those are always really, really different. Throughout it, we've seen a common thread of, of infrastructure and value accruing to the infrastructure layer. But I find myself, to your point, somewhat exhausted. For example, how many L2 proposals are there right now? Or like hybrid L2? Layer one natively integrated with ethereum, modular, some level of thinking on zero knowledge, like how many are there out there right now? Like it's certainly in the hundreds. And sort of trying to sift through that is, is somewhat exhausting versus trying to find like the next real trend in the space, whether that's social or whether that's, you know, something else that we have that we're not even thinking about yet.
00:06:15.006 - 00:07:27.494, Speaker C: That's a good point. Like I feel like after ECC there's a kind of general fatigue or criticism in the market of like how much infrastructure is enough in terms of the deployment of like the number of dollars have mostly gone to infrastructure. And to your point, Tom, I mean if you were to look back over the last, you know, ten plus years, that's where the money, the real returns have been made, you could argue. And so there was a natural tendency I think for people to keep deploying the next infrastructure project. And so the question is like at what point do you actually focus on apps we are seeing? Obviously base is fairly interesting if you think about the number of users that Coinbase has and it being a very kind of a hold handing experience for so many people that haven't been ready to venture into this world. And then you have an ecosystem of apps like Friendtech if you, or the like where they get access to these applications. But historically, I mean I think most funds out there would rather deploy and continue to deploy infrastructure.
00:07:27.494 - 00:07:59.234, Speaker C: So I think other technological kind of revolutions went through this phase as well. But you have to wonder at some point we have to deliver beautiful products, apps that people want to use to really, you know, make this all worthwhile. And I think we'll get there. It's just a matter what that is going to be. To your point, around gaming, you know, we've all three here believed in the category. A lot of people are now dismissive of how play to earn was like a thing that was the stupidest thing out there. And a lot of these things, you know, people are critical of.
00:07:59.234 - 00:08:30.026, Speaker C: But I'm constantly reminded that a lot of things in their first instantiation look really stupid. But then it's a second 3rd that with certain tweaks that actually, you know, really are how, how things kind of evolve. And so I think, yeah, just a general comment on like infrastructure and applications. Like I don't think there's nothing you can do. I think the market will do what the market does and just put a shit to an extreme of continue to fund more lts and more l ones and you know, it's just, you just.
00:08:30.050 - 00:08:46.064, Speaker A: Kind of have to let the chaos reign and, you know, it'll kind of sort itself out in the long run. And in all of these categories, inevitably less than 5% will survive. And that's just the natural ebb and flow of venture markets.
00:08:46.224 - 00:09:17.916, Speaker B: Well, I mean, Fronttech is a good example, though, right? Like, base started their own l two, spun out of Coinbase. Coinbase is like the most legit and trusted centralized brand of crypto in the world, I think, or one of the most. And, you know, the app is, I wouldn't say overly legit, but it's, it definitely speaks to uptake of, of the app itself. I don't know. Do we want to discuss, like, Frontet? Because, like, that's a change from infrastructure to the app level that we're kind of discussing do.
00:09:18.100 - 00:09:18.396, Speaker C: So.
00:09:18.420 - 00:09:53.320, Speaker A: Jaguar, do you, do you see that as like, the next big app that onboards, you know, significant numbers of users into the space? Because that's really one of the things that I'm so concerned about, uh, is that, like, hey, like, it's kind of the same group of us that it's always been like, trading these coins back and forth to each other. What is the thing that's going to onboard, like, a real significant uptick in, in, like, real world users? Do you, do you see this as like, the big breakthrough or what are your thoughts?
00:09:53.432 - 00:10:39.006, Speaker C: No, no, definitely not. I mean, I haven't signed up for it, but I think from a number, for a number of reasons, I don't think it's right. Um, like, mainstream app first mainstream app. I may be wrong, but it's not like the email of this category, I think, you know, I recently talked to the base team, and one of the things that they're, one of the applications that is deploying is kind of this restaurant reward program, which to me feels like totally on the back end. Something that you embed yourself in a flow that is, you know, so many people are like, how many people day to day are thinking about speculating on the value of their friends? Like, no, it's one of the things that once people show you, like, oh, some people might gravitate and be like, yeah, cool, I'm going to do that. But then they lose interest. And I think you're seeing that very quickly in trends, even just now.
00:10:39.006 - 00:11:22.178, Speaker C: But when you think about much bigger categories, okay, everyone's going to dining out. And if you embed that with the incremental improvement of saying, hey, you're going to get these points, you're going to get nFTs or these restaurants like oh, that's pretty cool. And so you have an application that looks and feels very much like an open table, but within this added component of points and the gamification and the incentives and I feel like that to me it's happening. It's. I forget the name of the team that's going to do this, but I'd much bet on that type of application which is incremental, I get it. Versus frantic, which is just very niche. It's no different than Defi.
00:11:22.178 - 00:11:44.804, Speaker C: And there's, to your point earlier, there's, there's a very discreet, small number of people that just think about that and we're going to see the full hype, right? We're going to see celebrities and some sports folks come in there. But I struggle to see that as like the killer app. I want to be proven wrong. I just don't believe in that aspect of printing.
00:11:44.844 - 00:12:19.378, Speaker B: The only thing that I like though is like my thesis for base is very simple. I think you guys probably have a similar one, right? Like Coinbase has 100 million plus users, a zillion dollars. Like an easy route to get that capital. And that user base on chain through base is fantastic. And Friendtech is up the alley of a consumer level app which is similar to the retail users that Coinbase has. So I think on the social user base fit, it's nice. But I'm with you in that I think the app should have been waited.
00:12:19.378 - 00:12:52.464, Speaker B: They should have waited a month to launch the app. It should have been launched with full functionality like pictures, videos, the whole nine yards. It shouldn't have been as janky. And I think the bonding curve is messed up because you quickly price the entire mass market out after you get a couple dozen users and there's no fractionalized shares or keys that they're calling them. And I don't know, I think it's hard. So I'm with you. I don't think it's the end game, but I struggle to see why they, I think they just should have waited and thought through the bonding curve and the features a little bit more before launching.
00:12:52.644 - 00:13:40.720, Speaker A: Ill take the other side of this debate in that Im not that excited about base because for me at the infrastructure layer, financial incentivization is the key killer use case. Without a token, youre just going to have greater apathy. Youre not going to have stickiness in your community. There's no buy in there to base. They're just like your brand affinity to Coinbase, which isn't that strong. And then further with friend or friend Tech. My issue is we're trying to build apps that onboard people.
00:13:40.720 - 00:14:51.586, Speaker A: To Santiago's point, the first successful use cases will be really specific apps that solve a specific problem and are generally useful. Then they will generalize to the generalized social platform. We won't start with this. Facebook magically appears on chain in anything. The last thing that I find peculiar is that instead of the incentivization being at the base layer in baseball, its abstracted away and in this gamified function in friend tech. And that feels really inauthentic for connecting on a social layer, that its ultimately this recursive function of trying to spin up money between each other and theres lots of attack vectors there. And I really have to say, you know, there's a point where the community probably needs to start to have a more discerning eye to the things that paradigm is putting out there.
00:14:51.586 - 00:15:49.014, Speaker A: You know, it's a like, it's a pretty consistent track record and I think Nick Tomato is the only guy really like publicly calling it out, you know, FTX and then Blur. Blur was a, you know, a pirate attack on artist royalties, which, which really like detracted from high quality fine art going on chain and has been net negative for the space. And I'm wondering if friend tech isn't going to be the exact same thing where it's another black eye that sets our whole community back by months if not years, and makes us look like the money grubbing grifters that Calicanus and various other folks outside of crypto are trying to paint us, which is not the case. Right. There's so many examples of. Of things that are amazing and really genuinely changing the world. And so I disagree fundamentally with where incentives were abstracted to.
00:15:49.014 - 00:15:58.090, Speaker A: And obviously as a result, I'm not super excited about this, but over time I think cryptosocial will be a thing.
00:15:58.242 - 00:16:33.364, Speaker C: There's a lot there to unpack. And of course I'll get the blur in a second because that was an investment blur. I'm curious actually to get your thoughts on, on this point that has it dissuade artists from more artists from coming on chain, but we'll get to that later. I want to touch on a point that you mentioned around tokens. And Lookbase doesn't have a token yet. The Coinbase team has been very explicit that they. But I will say like, you know, I believe in what I think we all can agree on, that the value accrual, the token is a necessary component of this space.
00:16:33.364 - 00:16:52.092, Speaker C: Without it is sort of like a glorified database. And the token, because a lot of people like Cal candidates. And your point, say, why do you need to have a token? And why does it need to be traded constantly? It's a casino. It's like, no, wait a minute. It represents the ability to distribute value in an open source context to contributors. Full stop. Without a token, none of this works.
00:16:52.092 - 00:17:45.308, Speaker C: And it allows you to incentivize and program things for the coordination of these trustless systems, distributed and decentralized, two different things. But you need to have a token in order to do that at some part of the layer stack. Okay, fine, so we agree on that, but I don't think it is necessary. When I think about mainstream adoption, the normie out there, forget about the people that are like, thinking about, hey, this is a speculation, and that's a whole part of this space, which I think is not wrong. Most people in crypto would have shied away from just saying, look, speculation is real and it's necessary for any technological innovation. It fuels growth and whatever. But the normal user, when he goes to a restaurant, is interacting on Twitter or these applications, is not thinking about value in the way that crypto delivers it.
00:17:45.308 - 00:18:44.368, Speaker C: So whether you have a token or not, I don't think is a necessary prerequisite to attract users out of the gate. So I would, I would, and this is why I'm more bullish on base, is where I'm trying to get at, which is I think that they'll be very competitive in onboarding people because there will be cool apps there. Because, Tom, to your point, they just, they have the distribution. And so now I think you're going to get tokens higher up the stack, whether it's friend tech or this restaurant app or all the defi apps that are now deploying on base. And that incremental incentive, once the user comes to crypto is going to be like, oh, wow, this is great. But I think it's a paradigm shift into thinking, which needs to be, just because we have a token, that's not enough to attract the billions of users out there. It's like, what are you, that's not the faster, better, cheaper criteria that you need to have in the product at a product level.
00:18:44.368 - 00:19:06.304, Speaker C: We just need to make onboarding easier. We need to make the, the flow easier, the experience easier. And then, yeah, if you have, if you have a token, well, that's the kind of the x plus y, the Y element that you don't have in web two, but for so long in this space. It's just been like, hey, there's a token. There's value accrual. You're going to participate in. I don't think that's enough.
00:19:06.304 - 00:19:10.808, Speaker C: I think it's important for early community, but I don't think it's enough for me to go.
00:19:10.976 - 00:19:14.888, Speaker A: What do you think is the thing that they have? Sorry, go ahead. Tomorrow.
00:19:14.896 - 00:19:51.912, Speaker B: No, no, no, it's okay. One thing I'll just to agree with both of you a little bit. Like, Ryan, you mentioned that there's a million l ones l two s. Sandy, you mentioned that you don't really need the token, or you might need the token to attract users. I think base is super interesting from the consumer adoption standpoint because you don't have to worry about going to a new Cosmos chain, going to another ETH l two, bridging to xyz l one. Those steps are just so confusing for people. And I think if people can access an app just out of the gate, like, we all want.
00:19:51.912 - 00:20:10.760, Speaker B: Like, we all want this, but then again, we're all funding new l one s into l two s all the time. Like, it doesn't make any sense. If we're able to steward an l two like base that has this great consumer appeal, it's super easy to onboard. Like, that's the thesis. Like, let's just go with that. Let's just focus on the apps built there.
00:20:10.792 - 00:20:11.364, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:20:12.504 - 00:20:13.176, Speaker A: What do you think?
00:20:13.200 - 00:21:13.524, Speaker C: That look, it's no different than the smartphone. When you buy a smartphone, it comes preloaded with certain apps, whether you like those apps or not. You can then go to the App Store, and certainly there's restrictions on what Apple allows to be on that App Store, as we all know. But at least that's, I think, the way I see this moment being so important for crypto, because right now, for a normal user, getting onboarded is like, okay, what do I do in this, like, vast ocean of things? Like, it's daunting, right? Whereas I think Coinbase will do that handholding experience where it's like, hey, this is the curated set of apps for the normal kind of set of Coinbase users. And that's great, I think. And then over time, they get more familiar with how to work the system and kind of operate in this new paradigm world. And then to your point, Ryan, they discover, oh, wait a minute, I'm using an app right now that is not giving me many rewards.
00:21:13.524 - 00:21:42.124, Speaker C: There's an alternative, Dex or, you know, social media platform out here that gives me better rewards, has better features. Yada, yada, yada. Like, there's no. There's a plethora of apps out there. You know, I. Not that we need to go on a tangent of airdrops and how unsuccessful. I think that we'll look back on some of these airdrop programs, be like, wow, that was incredibly expensive.
00:21:42.124 - 00:21:57.836, Speaker C: Customer acquisition with terrible retention. And that's just going to be. It's going to be pretty bad, because if you look at the retention numbers, it's not. Throwing airdrops to people is not enough to have them stick around. Yeah.
00:21:58.020 - 00:22:58.000, Speaker A: What do you think that base has that say you can't find in the polygon ecosystem, for example? Polygon really surprises me. It's quite a conundrum in the space right now where they continue to execute really well. There's now on the order of hundreds of games there. The apps for onboarding and bridging are about as good a UI as you're going to see in the space there is sort of like, relatively decentralized ownership. There's a really strong community there. They went and shipped Zkevm with my brother, Jordy Bellina here across the street from us. And Zkevm, unfortunately, still has hundreds of daily active users, which begs the question of, do people care about zero knowledge, privacy, you know, from a user perspective? No.
00:22:58.192 - 00:22:59.688, Speaker B: I think the thing that Polygon got.
00:22:59.696 - 00:23:02.960, Speaker A: Right in other ecosystems.
00:23:03.152 - 00:23:25.024, Speaker B: Well, I think Polygon got the biz dev right. I think they, in a sea of technical people, they hired and executed on sales, marketing, and biz Dev in a way nobody else did. Like, they inked major partnerships. They were out here selling the chain they acquired. I mean, remember Matic originally acquired Polygon, and then Polygon acquired. Was it Hermes? Was that was the ZK tag?
00:23:27.884 - 00:23:28.196, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:23:28.220 - 00:23:38.180, Speaker B: So they have a phenomenal track record of not only selling their own product to brands and users, but acquiring the tech that they need, which is also, at the end of the day, sort of like sales. So I think that sets Polygon apart.
00:23:38.252 - 00:24:06.044, Speaker A: But nobody would call that like, a financial success based on their early. Certainly not based on their early rounds, which were, you know, were pretty. Pretty, like, fully priced. You know, if. If base had a token right now, it'd be somewhere in the deca billionaire valuation range. And. Yeah, and I'm kind of, like, still at this thing of, like, what do they have that polygon doesn't? Is it just that they have a centralized owner? Effectively, they have the trust.
00:24:06.044 - 00:24:09.384, Speaker A: Are they just gonna give the money back to the banks and, like, forget about.
00:24:10.164 - 00:24:52.772, Speaker C: I mean, Ryan, let me ask you a question. When people in America, if you were a survey and in other jurisdictions where they're at, they are synonymous with crypto, whether we like it or not. I mean, that's just the brand recognition that they command amongst outside crypto people. It's coinbase you think of. They're synonymous. And I think it will look pretty silly in 510 years time that the whole issue of the space, which is something that I've thought about a lot, is that when we comment on the success of things, we are referencing for the most part a token price, which is not really the most important thing. Unfortunately, it's the thing that we hold on to the most because it's a price.
00:24:52.772 - 00:25:28.998, Speaker C: The problem with that is it's early stage, it's, it's venture that is in full price discovery mode. Even bitcoin, ethereum are full price discovery mode. And so the wild swings are highly distracting because if Polygon did the last one at a buck per token and now it goes to 30, but they've signed all this bd deals and they have all these corporates on boarded. But like, unfortunately, most people like, oh, it's dead. Like, this project is going to zero. And like, it's so I think for, for most market commentators and investors, it's, it's just an unfortunate situation. But I mean, this is the state we're at.
00:25:28.998 - 00:26:00.090, Speaker C: But you know, so many times we, we comment on things like play to earn and all these different things. I think price, ultimately, markets are efficient, especially, I think, in crypto. I do believe that there's efficiency in market to tell you if things are working or not. But I think there's a lot of emphasis on, on that. And so maybe, maybe like, look, there's been some apps like Uniswap, but they don't have a token for such a long time. But they are, they just dominated and they continue to dominate. I think there's a natural evolution of when you want to have a token.
00:26:00.202 - 00:26:32.488, Speaker D: Everyone, we'll get back to Empire in just a minute, but before we do that, I want to let you know that, that we have permissionless coming up. Permissionless is big conference that blockworks and bankless put on together. It is the biggest, the best DeFi conference in crypto this year. It is in Austin, Texas, September 11 through 13th. If you've been in crypto for a while, you know that bear market conferences are the best kind of conferences. We have a phenomenal lineup of speakers. A lot of the guests that you hear on Empire are both going to be speaking there.
00:26:32.488 - 00:26:56.312, Speaker D: You will have the opportunity to meet them there. And a lot of the topics that we cover on Empire, ZK tech roll ups, account abstraction, Mev app chain, thesis, a lot of that kind of stuff. That will all be discussed at permissionless this year. So because you are a listener of Empire, you get a special discount. That's right. Santi and I negotiated with our marketing team. You get 30% off.
00:26:56.312 - 00:27:13.602, Speaker D: If you go to blockworks.com forward slash permissionless, empire 30 is going to get you 30% off your ticket. Today, when I'm recording this, that's about $300 off your ticket. So type in Empire 30. When buying your permissionless ticket, you get about $300 off. Click the link at the bottom of this episode. It's in the show notes.
00:27:13.602 - 00:27:22.754, Speaker D: Do it quickly because prices go up all the time. And if you are going to permissionless, hit me up, let me know. Shoot me a DM on Twitter. I would love to meet up with you there.
00:27:22.834 - 00:27:50.882, Speaker B: I don't think anybody cares about base being centralized. I don't think 99% of people care. I don't even think the people in crypto really care. I think eventually, if they get fraud proofs down and people could like, eventually roll back or like argue on chain if something goes wrong, sure. But for Coinbase's brand, I don't think they're ever in a million years going to cause an issue that would lead people to have to do that. So even in the edge case, I don't think it cares. So I don't know.
00:27:50.882 - 00:28:01.352, Speaker B: I'm pretty bullish on it because I think it's just consumer adoption and I think they will launch a token. I just think Coinbase corporate is never going to say that for the next five years, given the regulatory landscape.
00:28:01.448 - 00:28:24.024, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know. Like, I'm here for crypto native values and like, you know, lowering the genie coefficient and decentralized, decentralizing power and wealth among, among network actors to make things community led and not centralized. So for me, it's a, it's a bit of a bastardization of what we're trying to do here.
00:28:24.924 - 00:28:26.684, Speaker B: But Ryan, again, push back.
00:28:26.844 - 00:28:28.268, Speaker A: People make money on it.
00:28:28.436 - 00:28:48.634, Speaker C: Let me, let me ask you a question, Ryan. Were you, like, back when, back when Facebook announced Libra, let's just go pro or con, were you, did you see that as similar? Like, this is terrible. This is just going to co opt a lot of the values and people are going to think it's crypto, but it's not. Or Facebook launching metaverse like to. Do you think that those two things are negative for the subject?
00:28:48.754 - 00:29:05.698, Speaker A: Not only did I think it was negative, Facebook called us in at the time because they wanted to collab with polychain on the subject. And I told them that to their face at their campus that this was, like, totally against crypto native values.
00:29:05.746 - 00:29:06.114, Speaker C: And they were.
00:29:06.154 - 00:29:07.014, Speaker B: What did they say?
00:29:08.474 - 00:29:37.774, Speaker A: What was their, they responded with, like, all these metrics of how Facebook's power was continuing to dominate the world. And I responded with the same thing that you and I talked about a few podcasts ago, that social network effects are dual power law, both on the way up and the way down. And so, like, when they turn the curve, they'll, they'll also know. And so, yes, they're still on the dual power law going on the way up, but it's not as defensible as they think they think they have.
00:29:38.804 - 00:29:45.204, Speaker C: Yeah. Tom, what do you think of some, like, Libra and, or like, the metaverse?
00:29:45.244 - 00:29:47.220, Speaker A: I mean, we have that. It's called payPal.
00:29:47.292 - 00:29:58.308, Speaker B: I'm with Ryan. I think Libra was a desperate attempt to try and save their business and lean into some clout. I don't think it was ever in the realm of decentralization or crypto. And, I mean, it failed pretty miserably.
00:29:58.356 - 00:30:11.954, Speaker C: Right. I mean, look, well, I will take, I'll take the opposite here, because I. I'm very aware of that. It is not crypto. Right. It is for a variety of reasons. It's not a perfect.
00:30:11.954 - 00:31:14.230, Speaker C: But I will say one thing. It is from a practical standpoint, I think of, is it going to move the needle? Even centralized central bank, digital currencies, I think they're all positive in the sense that you stand. My hope is that in my thesis is once people get conditioned in using these things, digital native money and tokens, and understand that, then their imaginations open up and say, okay, what else can we do here? And I think for base in particular, or if you get airdrop Libra, what was supposed to be, then you're like, okay, I think it's a higher probability to convince and convert that user that now starts to forcibly, for better or for worse, has to understand how to use this technology. And it opens up this sort of Pandora's box, so many users, and so you hook them then and there. And the whole, I think a lot of the thinking in crypto has been very binary. And is it. It's either crypto or not.
00:31:14.230 - 00:31:46.482, Speaker C: And I think it's a spectrum and a sequence of things for early adopters. I get it. But over time, I think, you know, I would argue that taking a more practical mindset of there's a progress and a journey that people need to take to get to really understand the power of this technology. Now, it might be a quick aha moment. Ryan, I know you're so close to artists. Like, artists really get it very quickly because they're like, oh, you're telling me I don't have to go to gallery and sell my stuff through Sotheby's, which charge me an arm and a leg. Say no more.
00:31:46.482 - 00:32:16.174, Speaker C: It's actually been the thing that I explained to people the most. This digital scarcity through art is nfts have been beautiful because you can explain and crystallize this technology. And the people that, that are in this industry get it very quickly. But, but for so many others, I think it's going to be a work your way up, which is, hey, I have this thing, Libra, or the central bank digital currency. Wait a minute, what's going on in this other pocket that I hear rumblings on? Oh, okay. Well, it's pretty cool. Like, I want to get, I want to interact with that.
00:32:16.174 - 00:33:10.576, Speaker C: And my whole thing with crypto is think about Montesquieu, like three layers of power, and there's checks and balances. I think crypto is that for stool, which is you're not going to blow up governments, you're not going to blow up Wall street as we know it. But the ability to quit the system, it introduces more competitiveness to political, economic, financial systems across the world, because for a variety of reasons, and that increased competition is really good. It just creates a better system. And actors within all the systems, legacy and new, start acting better because they know that if they are excessively greedy, people are going to leave, whether it's they're going to leave their Venezuela, to go to Colombia, or they're going to leave Argentina. And so I think that's my view of crypto. It's not that we're going to blow up the world and rebuild new systems.
00:33:10.576 - 00:33:16.152, Speaker C: It's more, so you introduce more competitiveness in existing systems, and that's really positive.
00:33:16.208 - 00:34:01.674, Speaker A: I think your view to kind of summarize here is that there will be two value and information superhighways. One that is, like, compliant and probably easier to use. And that will fit a mixture of these corporate things like base, but also central bank currencies and things like that. And then there will be a Badlands where like bitcoin exists and like the fully decentralized, like crypto native values exist. I think my point is I only want to spend my time, energy and capital in the Badlands because that is the most intellectually interesting as well as most profitable area to invest in.
00:34:01.714 - 00:34:01.946, Speaker C: Agreed.
00:34:01.970 - 00:34:03.434, Speaker B: Both from 100% agreed.
00:34:03.554 - 00:34:14.572, Speaker A: Time capital as well as financial capital is the way that I look at it. All this other stuff like bridging Web two and, and like. Yeah, you know, but.
00:34:14.628 - 00:35:04.420, Speaker B: So, Ryan, I agree with you that the most interesting things happen in the Badlands. Like you get the builders who could literally build new things without any appeasement of what's been built, or a boss or a bureaucracy or a company. Like, I totally understand that. The only route, Santi, I would agree with you on is the profit perspective becomes really lopsided to the base world. If they are able to actually onboard the amount of users that they want to, then the apps built on base, because then the Badlands becomes interesting, but much user or much lower on every metric versus a base eco that is successful. And I'm not saying it will be very successful. I'm just saying, you know, most of people on base are not going to bridge over to the bad lads, right? Just by definition, if they're the mass market of the US or the globe.
00:35:04.532 - 00:35:06.828, Speaker C: Well, I mean, if you give them.
00:35:06.876 - 00:35:12.186, Speaker A: A leverage, right, you incentivize the movement over, they'll get there, right?
00:35:12.250 - 00:36:02.244, Speaker C: Yeah, I. And that's, that's a good point, Ryan. I think fundamentally you have to believe that what is most exciting to me in this space, and always has been, is the possibility to constantly layer new incentive models and mechanisms to. And they really move people to drive and drive certain actions. It's been difficult because you're, for so long, it's a very small subset of users that are using these systems. So running experiments on a low end that is neither large or sufficiently diversified is tricky. Mac, to my point, on airdrop, but I think over time, imagine a world where base onboard, say, 2030, 40, 50 million people, and they're all using these apps.
00:36:02.244 - 00:36:46.692, Speaker C: I would argue that there is a subset of one. I think all the projects that are now obviously deploying, like all the DeFi protocols are deploying on base. And there's. And so that's positive for the space in and of itself because, hey, by the way, there's like 50 active users on DeFi on any given day. But now you have more now with that. I recognize that it's happening on base. Not to get into a tangent of value accrual, like fat protocol thesis or app thesis or wherever you think, but I do think that it's hard for me to imagine a world where over time, something that has a ton of usage usually accrues some meaningful value.
00:36:46.692 - 00:37:26.998, Speaker C: And so I would think that if you have 50 orders of magnitude of users, it's going to certainly benefit Coinbase, but it will also benefit all the apps that, you know, are struggling for breadcrumbs of attention that are happening in every other chain. And so naturally, if there's an incentive to bridge over, I think we got to talk about not maybe here, but over time, the bridging experience, users not going to want to think about that. They're just going to use all these apps. And however that gets settled in the back end is going to be a thing that, you know, no one thinks about. And protocol loyalty is not even going to be the thing for me.
00:37:27.086 - 00:38:29.320, Speaker B: One thing I want to hit on because like we're talking about two different worlds here of like the Badlands versus like this more business esque, Wall street, government approved world. I think the real thing for me is just being okay with like at the edge versus like high compute, right? Like you can both, like the breakdown between a user in the future. They could run a data availability sampling node on their phones for Celestia, right? They can also run the next version of a web3 app on their phone. But the reality is the hard compute, the big nodes, the builders in Ethereum, that's always going to be centralized. The ZK stuff is always going to have centralized compute because the fraud proofs, the verification is just way too big right now. So I think we need to break this into stuff that the user can run at the edge versus the stuff run in a centralized manner. And I think as long as the edge has control to fight or argue with the larger nodes, I think we're fine.
00:38:29.320 - 00:38:38.376, Speaker B: So I don't know. That's the decentralization centralization spectrum I think about a lot and it's far from fleshed out, but I think that's kind of the world we end up in.
00:38:38.440 - 00:38:40.706, Speaker C: By the way, Ryan, are you on Frentek? I'm not.
00:38:40.770 - 00:38:41.218, Speaker A: I'm not.
00:38:41.266 - 00:38:41.738, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:38:41.866 - 00:38:47.434, Speaker A: I mean, I've looked at it and a bunch of the team has played around with it, but like, you know.
00:38:47.554 - 00:38:54.690, Speaker C: Uh, like I stopped when it asked me to connect my twitter. I'm like, yeah, yeah, no, this is in a service area that I don't want to open up.
00:38:54.722 - 00:39:13.114, Speaker A: So ultimately I want to try to lead by example, by doing like the right thing and being in, in things that are, are pushing the space forward in a positive frame of mind. And I'm not sure that this is going to be seen in long term as possible. The same way that very clearly blur was not possible.
00:39:13.774 - 00:39:34.274, Speaker B: The one thing, not to stand it, but the one thing I did like was their workaround of the App Store. Just the ability to install like shortcut right on your phone from Safari. You can access it. Like, that was a fantastic way to get around Apple's 30% tax and Apple's App Store, which I thought was phenomenal. Yeah, that'll definitely be for now. Yeah, for now.
00:39:34.934 - 00:39:42.998, Speaker C: And it sounds like it's super easy to get funds on it, right? It is easy. So something good will come out of.
00:39:43.006 - 00:39:43.894, Speaker A: This experiment for sure.
00:39:43.974 - 00:39:45.654, Speaker C: Bridging and just this hack.
00:39:45.694 - 00:39:50.074, Speaker B: All right, we have to move on. Orion's going to fly here and shoot me. What are we going to next?
00:39:51.734 - 00:39:52.990, Speaker C: Let's do it.
00:39:53.182 - 00:40:48.400, Speaker A: Well, let's talk about, like, the movement in ETF's and what that means for capital allocators in the space. And so obviously we're on the cusp of both bitcoin and ether. ETF's being readily available within the next six months. I would argue that we're probably a year out from coherent regulation in the US anyways. And so the cambrian explosion is about to begin because markets are leading indicators. But just talking about the ETF's for a second, so that's great. It means that there's going to be a lot of demand side pressure because a lot of institutions that would like to hold one or 2% for treasury management in mature crypto, like bitcoin and ETH, can do so and do so very easily and at a low cost level.
00:40:48.400 - 00:41:30.778, Speaker A: The interesting thing there is what happens to the plethora of venture funds that are essentially just charging 220 to hold your ETH in your bitcoin and maybe like a basket of, like some other things. But. But there, like, I read a stat the other day that somewhere that approximately half of the 808 hundred odd crypto funds that existed at the peak in 2021 have gone out of business. Does this mean that it halves again or more? And what do you guys think about that as capital allocators? And how do you then propose novel creative fee structures for your LP's?
00:41:30.976 - 00:42:05.738, Speaker B: I have some thoughts on the ETF and then maybe more stronger views on the large fund side. I'll go for the more interesting one, which is the larger fund side. I think larger funds that are just allocating to ether bitcoin are toast. I've always thought that. And I also just don't think there's appetite in the market to effectively allocate billions of dollars from one single fund into the space. Right now, I think their game is just overlapping management fees, and I don't think it's outperformance on the carry side at all, which, look, if that's their game, that that's fine, to each their own.
00:42:05.786 - 00:42:06.666, Speaker A: But that's such an.
00:42:06.690 - 00:42:07.066, Speaker B: I just.
00:42:07.130 - 00:42:09.482, Speaker A: Inelegant way to live. Like, is that.
00:42:09.618 - 00:42:19.894, Speaker B: It's boring to me. It's. It's just like you're not. You're more. You're more interested in investor relations than you are in, you know, project relations. Right. And it's just not interesting.
00:42:19.894 - 00:42:22.202, Speaker B: I have views on for the two.
00:42:22.258 - 00:42:27.062, Speaker A: Instead of the 20 is just ridiculous way to conduct yourself philosophically.
00:42:27.158 - 00:43:11.432, Speaker C: Do not disagree with you guys. I don't think that they go bust, at least not immediately. And I just look at traditional hedge funds and large asset allocators that have just stopped playing the 20% game and optimized the 2% game because they realized, hey, you know, we could just scale this up by an order of magnitude and just play the 2% game. And so I look, you could even argue, well, I don't think. I don't think they go away, like, look, look at Grayscale. I mean, grayscale charge, and I would argue Grayscale goes bust for sure. Well, they'll probably convert to an ETF, but no, I mean, they convert to.
00:43:11.448 - 00:43:28.514, Speaker A: An ETF and their, and their cash flows get cut by three quarters or more. Right. Because they got. The ETF's got to have maybe 25 bits of fees, 15 bits of fees, tops. And so they become a much, much smaller entity.
00:43:29.494 - 00:44:00.244, Speaker B: I want to ask, though this, because this is an interesting thought experiment, to play devil's advocate on my own view here, because we're all in agreement. If there is no place for large funds like mega funds, does that mean that as an industry, we haven't grown to a. Where we're not growing to a level where we have that capital allocating projects, or does that mean that the projects themselves are doing capital formation directly to retail and their users and it's not necessary? Like, I'm hoping it's. Yeah, I mean, which is it?
00:44:00.324 - 00:44:44.196, Speaker A: I very much hope it's the latter. And we're able to just like, crowdfund the vast majority of interesting innovation in this space, and which will be much more intellectually interesting. And what I think we're seeing across venture beyond crypto is that the era of the mega fund is over. Venture is a craft game. The right size for a venture vehicle is between 100 and $300 million. And beyond that, somebody show me a fund on planet Earth. In the history of venture that raised over a billion dollars of initial lp capital that returned above three, Moic doesn't exist.
00:44:44.260 - 00:45:14.076, Speaker C: There's a reason why benchmark is the most successful venture fund across vintages, because they've stuck and disciplined to, I think it's like 150 or 350. Every fund is the exact same number. Three, and that's it. But you're right. Look, I mean, I think a lot of people gave sequoia shit for leaving, but I think it's to your point, Tom. I mean, they're, I don't, I think they're smart, and they, they've said that the opportunity set is not here for us to deploy meaningful chunks of capital. And so I respect that.
00:45:14.076 - 00:45:22.652, Speaker C: I mean, I, there's a lot of things that I don't agree with, like, like, you know, but, but that at least, I think, is an honest assessment of where the industry is in terms of how much capital you can deploy.
00:45:22.748 - 00:45:55.486, Speaker B: Yeah. One of my favorite structures that rolled out was, and I'm not an investor in it, and I don't know how they're doing right now, which was Hydradao, which is just one large pool of capital at the top, and it rolls down into specific subdaos. And the subdaos are all led by, I'm pretty sure it was founders in their respective fields. So they, like, have unique experience. They know exactly what the landscape is like, they can specialize. They don't have to worry about Defi to do infra. They don't have to worry about gaming if they're doing ZK and they can crush it, and then that rolls back up.
00:45:55.486 - 00:46:07.554, Speaker B: And that was always my favorite way to do it. But from, you know, as we all know, creating a venture fund around that scenario with, like, current laws and landscapes is pretty hard.
00:46:08.294 - 00:46:24.268, Speaker A: But, yeah, a venture Dow is a failed experiment, right. For now, I think we will get success in a venture Dow. But all they were, were front running experiments where people were participating in with a nominal amount of money, then front running the shit out of the deal flow, which is like, but the other.
00:46:24.276 - 00:46:37.516, Speaker C: Thing I would have go as far as saying most dows are just failed experiments. People realize it run daos and governance and like, no, like you, you can't have a flat organizational structure. Guys wake up. Like, you need to have some hierarchy.
00:46:37.580 - 00:46:54.484, Speaker A: Yeah, with, no, with no one being paid it. Dow dows are probably in an industry with terrible acronyms and misnomers. The Dow may be the worst one because I don't know a single one that's actually decentralized in any way autonomous or particularly well organized.
00:46:54.784 - 00:47:13.954, Speaker B: The thing that was, the thing that, the reason why I like the specialization on subdaos versus the large investment daos is because 98, 99% of the people do not show up to vote. And the ones who do vote, only half of them are reading the ic docs. It just doesn't scale with investment club like approach of people voting. It just doesn't work.
00:47:14.024 - 00:47:42.844, Speaker A: We've changed, we've completely changed our fee structure. You know, we're, we're like a friends and family thing anyway. So we don't like our fee. Our fees are way below market to begin with, but we've completely changed our fee structure to be like, based on the yielding out performance of ETH rather than, than just like raw return, because, like, who's going to just give you money to, like, hold ETH? Like that's, you know, that ship is sail. So now you got to do something.
00:47:42.964 - 00:47:57.012, Speaker C: Actually, it's interesting, I think that fee structures, gene, like, is the correct one here, because are you outperforming? The underlying, like, your hurdle is ETH plus staking. You can be pretty hard outperform. Like, it's, it's hard outperforming.
00:47:57.108 - 00:48:01.268, Speaker A: That is the most elite bar in the game. Outperforming.
00:48:01.356 - 00:48:04.588, Speaker C: Yeah. Which, by the way, most funds historically have not.
00:48:04.676 - 00:48:08.404, Speaker A: I mean, it's an elite, it's hard. It is an elite bar.
00:48:08.864 - 00:48:10.744, Speaker B: But what, what percent of investment?
00:48:10.864 - 00:48:32.314, Speaker C: The thing about ETF, though, that I'm curious about is, like, you go, they don't outperform ETH. Like, probably nine out of ten don't outperform me for like over five year period. The, the interesting thing, I'm actually curious. I don't know this for a fact, but the ETF, how does the ETF factor in staking rewards from, like, proof of stake? Like for like, ethanol?
00:48:32.384 - 00:48:39.470, Speaker A: So, three, this is, the funny thing is, I haven't seen a Steve, which is the, that's the winning ETF.
00:48:39.662 - 00:48:40.270, Speaker B: Well, there is.
00:48:40.302 - 00:48:42.726, Speaker A: Ryan has the yield on it.
00:48:42.870 - 00:48:44.318, Speaker B: So three IQ is a portco, and.
00:48:44.326 - 00:49:20.974, Speaker C: They'Re doing, it's like a reit, right? It's like, yeah, yeah, that's huge. I mean, people don't appreciate, like, the venture, like, growth profile of some, like, ethereum of general computer as more apps get built. Plus, the staking yield. The market has not seen this type of product out there, and it may remind me of just early days of reits, of just how widely popular they were in the market. But, of course, real estate growth prospects are much lower than technology. Yeah.
00:49:21.354 - 00:50:44.792, Speaker A: If you go back a decade and look at tech mega caps, to now, like your Apple, Google, Amazon, Faang, so to speak, over the course of the decade, an intelligent basket of those companies returned about a ten x. And like, how many venture funds returned ten x? Such that somebody could have, you know, in consumer and web two, someone could have just owned a basket of those, of those mega techs and probably outperformed, you know, the vast majority of funds, especially the mega funds that charge the 330 instead of the 220 and are raising billions of dollars. We could be entering a decade where we see the same thing with ETH, where, like at here, here at 1600 plus a 3.5% yield, there's no clear line of path for a venture capitalist to obviously outperform ETH over the next five year period. ETH has got an easy ten x in it. During that time, you got to go and put some wins and some DPI on the table in order to outperform that. Like I said, an elite bar to get over at this point.
00:50:44.792 - 00:50:55.644, Speaker A: And now that it's commodified, you know, you can't just rely on family offices giving you money to hold, Ethan. You get 20% of the upside. Right. That game, that. That ship is sailed.
00:50:56.064 - 00:50:57.944, Speaker B: Yeah. One of the things that's interesting, and.
00:50:57.944 - 00:51:02.144, Speaker A: I think that's why the venture rounds have been as difficult as they have been. Right. You know?
00:51:02.184 - 00:51:03.360, Speaker C: Yeah. The other thing is just the fee.
00:51:03.392 - 00:51:29.026, Speaker B: Battle, like the ETH. So we have bitcoin. We have a bitcoin futures product. My personal take is the next one is an ETH futures product, then a spot and grayscale converts at some point. But essentially, the ETH products can offer. The ETH futures products are now competing. The war on fees is already down to 20 or 30 bps, and it's obviously going to go lower, but that'll eventually flip positive.
00:51:29.026 - 00:52:02.384, Speaker B: But they don't have to stake the entire lot of their ethnic to be net zero in fees. They only need to stake five or 10% of the holdings to cover whatever their fee is to flat out at zero without taking all the risk of staking their ETH. But the point is that when you go to Wall street and you're offering to Ryan, to your point, ETH exposure with no fee or potentially a gain, that becomes incredible. Then we start to get into a scenario where the yield goes down.
00:52:06.364 - 00:52:30.464, Speaker A: Definitely. Programmable money is ultimately a race to perfect competition, where economic profit may persist, but, or, sorry, accounting profit may persist, but economic profit will be obviated away. And I think we see that in staking. We've seen that in Defi. We've seen that in so many things. We move down that curve really quickly in this space.
00:52:31.044 - 00:52:51.740, Speaker C: Yeah, say more about that, because I don't think people appreciate that nuance. You're saying, like, there's a lot of consumer welfare, like consumer, sorry, not consumer benefit that gets created and that the value translates to the consumer, the end user. But that doesn't accrue to these historical gatekeepers that have captured this value because there's friction in the system. They have to gatekeep.
00:52:51.852 - 00:54:18.756, Speaker A: Yeah, if you look at, if you look at, say, different types of yielding opportunities throughout the history of the space. So, like, let's take mining as the particular example. You know, it's a race to perfect competition at a relatively accelerated field or pace, right? Like, mining took a little bit longer, but like Defi, which is now, you know, like vanilla Defi, if you don't have like, automation and a bunch of, of software tools protecting you, you're getting lower than fed funds rate. It has moved from Defi summer, where you're getting high double digit, triple, even triple digit yields, to now, where you're below fed funds rate, or mining, where I remember early days of mining, we were calculating profit per week because you had to turn over your rigs so fast, but you were making so much money that it didnt really matter. By the time 2015 hit, it was six 8% yield by capex businesses. Our space moves towards this equilibrium of near perfect competition where there could be a small profit, for example, like ETF's. Well, make money on the lending and yielding, and, and they'll re hypothecate the capital that they have to have a business model.
00:54:18.756 - 00:54:28.304, Speaker A: But you see this very aggressive movement towards perfect competition across the space in all areas which is similar with MEV.
00:54:28.804 - 00:54:49.252, Speaker B: Every time we see an MEV play or see a debate out in public, most of the time, every argument is, look, people are going to bid these bundles to do the arbitrage, up to 99% of their profit, and they're going to give that all the way back to stakers or the protocol or something like that. Like, it's a similar debate in the MEV world right now for sure.
00:54:49.308 - 00:55:03.236, Speaker A: I mean, early 21 was a party every day in MEV and now it is a slog, right? It's a slog. So, I mean, that's just a characteristic of the speed of our business.
00:55:03.340 - 00:55:46.656, Speaker B: Yeah. I did a podcast recently with Hal Press, Scott Galloway and a couple other people. And one of the most interesting points I heard from HAL was that despite an ETF being somewhat inevitable, it really changes the aura of acceptance in crypto, totally outside of the flows in general. So, sure, the flows will be nice, but when everybody is able to buy it, it ushers in this acceptance. And everybody is okay working for a crypto company, everybody's okay pushing for new regulations, everyone's okay holding the tokens. I thought that was a, you know, a kind of a nuanced point that I thought was kind of interesting. For what it's worth, curious if you guys agree.
00:55:46.760 - 00:56:28.884, Speaker A: I mean, I am of the opinion that we are months, not years, away from coherent regulation around widespread participation in crypto. And because markets are leading indicators, the market's going to respond to that already when it's on the horizon. And if nothing else, I think Gensler is gone next November because Trump is clearly taking the White House and Gensler's Democrat pocket. So that's out the door and somebody else is going to come in. And since Trump made so much money on his nfts, I assume he's got a little bit better perception of crypto at this point.
00:56:29.864 - 00:57:14.064, Speaker C: Yeah, I would agree with that. I think we are. It's interesting, Brian, you and I both live in Europe, and a lot of people don't appreciate, but the sentiment in Europe, which a lot of people criticize for not for being tech backwards looking, is farther. Like, you know, it's much more positive, particularly among more entrenched old family offices that look, I mean, I think at this point, every allocator of capital is known about the space. They've already been educated on the space. Like, they've gone through multiple cycles. And to me, it was a bit of a shock because you would have thought, gosh, the amount of value destruction across Celsius, FTX, Voyager, Terra, you're like people, like, we've set ourselves back not a couple years, like a decade.
00:57:14.064 - 00:57:49.304, Speaker C: And to my surprise, that's not the case. And I think even mainstream media like Bloomberg, crypto, like, they actually, the quality of reporting has gone up and they make the distinction between what is centralized blow ups and actual crypto and the promise that it holds. So I'm actually quite to your point, Ryan. I do agree we are closer. And historically, I think even in the UK, Gold ETF's got approved there first and then they got approved in the US. Ultimately, I think it's going to happen that way. And markets are highly efficient.
00:57:49.304 - 00:58:06.134, Speaker C: As soon as you see that and the amount of opportunities being left on the table, it pushes, it will push the US to adopt a more coherent regulation. I think it's just going to take this coming election cycle to run its course. And after that, I think we're going to have clear visibility.
00:58:07.234 - 00:58:35.104, Speaker B: I was in your guys camp that I thought we were going to get super clear regulation. And then this morning there's the treasury or something in the US having time to dig into it releases a document that every gnosis safe holder is a broker. Right. And those are the types of regs that are being proposed here that are pretty dangerous to crypto. And to see them still coming out kind of makes you think, like, are we actually moving forward as fast as we think?
00:58:35.644 - 00:59:32.464, Speaker C: I will. Two things. I will make a point that especially around election years, there is no shortage of politicians that want to come out ahead by putting it like inflammatory, headline catching, grabbing stuff. But it is important to track the developments that are happening in the courts because the courts are ultimately the ones that tell you the interpretation and how these things are going to be adopted. So I think it's overwhelming, I want to say overwhelmed, but the sentiment, I think is quickly turning in Congress that particularly with the ripple case, you need clear rules and regulations. They're not going to be perfect ever. Mika's not perfect, but at least having a starting point so that you avoid the current status quo where it's regulation by enforcement, is a vast improvement to unlocking everything, not just founders, but also capital allocators.
00:59:32.464 - 01:00:19.034, Speaker C: I think to Ryan's point, I think the ETF really solidifies that, which is this is an industry, an asset class that is here to stay whether you like it or not. We don't care, but there's, there's money here, there's innovation, and that's gonna happen. So, you know, I agree with you, Tom, and sometimes, like, I pay too much attention on these headlines. I'm like God. But I have faith in particular in the US. Like the courts have, to my surprise, positively, really just taking peeled back like, and just like been more favorable to crypto, like their interpretation of the law, securities laws, which need updating, but at least even in the current outdated framework, they've been quite positive towards crypto. So that to me is I have.
01:00:19.074 - 01:00:33.134, Speaker A: Faith in the decentralization of wealth and power that crypto has caused. Right. Ethereum, spawned somewhere in the tens of thousands of millionaires, and those people are making political.
01:00:33.214 - 01:00:38.814, Speaker C: It's the number one piece of technology in the history of the world that has created the most amount of diversified and distributed. Yeah.
01:00:38.854 - 01:00:57.798, Speaker A: And those people are writing checks to politicians and telling them that they are single issue voters that care about this matter. And I have to believe that core to american values is that the money talks, especially in politics. And we're getting that.
01:00:57.886 - 01:01:54.742, Speaker C: The one thing I will say, the one thing I will say, guys, is I look at Uber as a prime example of something that, like, crypto got so much pushback because it bumped into the tax, like, the taxi lobby groups that were very vocal against it, and they got shut down. They went into cities, they just plowed ahead, and ultimately they succeeded. Why? Because it was a goddamn better product than a taxi. Like, you just cannot fight the consumer. And this is where, if this doesn't work in the next two, three years, is because we failed on that point of delivering that, because a lot of people still, when you go talk to them or say, show me, like, a good product out there that is not just, like, frank money grab, to your point, grifting activity. And it's always the hardest, the softer point out of every discussion that you will have, have on crypto. It is.
01:01:54.742 - 01:02:15.942, Speaker C: It is unfortunate, but it's a state of how early we are and unlike other movements of technology, so you can't move fast and break things like their needs. Cryptography has been in the works for so much, and so you have to be more meticulous in deploying these things and cautious. And so in my mind, it needs to be more social, more like, not just money.
01:02:16.038 - 01:02:18.550, Speaker B: No, no, I like your mistake. I like your uber example.
01:02:18.582 - 01:02:18.774, Speaker C: That.
01:02:18.814 - 01:03:01.610, Speaker B: That is a really good one. The one thing I'd say is, like, I didn't realize how much I appreciated the US's judicial system until this year. Like, I straight up did not really put that much time or thought into it until this year, like, like, between. And I didn't really, you know, it caught me off guard. I think last summer when the SEC started suing everybody they could, everybody that was, like, remotely even connected to crypto, good or bad. And I was like, well, you know, how the do we just deal with this until we hopefully get a new chair or Commissioner Peirce gets a couple of two friends to help them decide on more cases. And with the pushback on the ripple case, with Coinbase really pushing in, I think Kraken should have pushed more.
01:03:01.610 - 01:03:19.964, Speaker B: But I think it was a business decision. And now with the SEC and grayscale, those are three of the main cases I'm tracking. And honestly, I'm not a lawyer, but I think they're pretty positive. If you go and listen to the grayscale oral arguments versus the SEC, like, go listen to them and let me know who you think won.
01:03:20.344 - 01:03:48.642, Speaker C: We're at the hour mark, but I know, Ryan, one of the things that you're really close on is this high end art, and I think we should round it up. I always want to leave an episode with positivity because we're in a bear market. People are always very dismissive. It's the end, and NFT is no different. Nfts are kind of going through, and a lot of collections have gone crushed. You could argue that those were crappy art and should have never accrued the value that they did. But you've been super active.
01:03:48.642 - 01:03:58.994, Speaker C: There's a whole pocket of the NFT world that I think is getting a lot of traction, but not enough attention. You're really close to that. So maybe we just close it with that because. And comment on your experience.
01:03:59.074 - 01:04:02.054, Speaker B: And Ryan, say, how late you were up last night?
01:04:02.914 - 01:04:35.810, Speaker A: Oh, I mean, I slept an hour. I was not only up all night, I was so amped and amped up that I couldn't even sleep. But just to contextualize. So we were fortunate enough to win the monument by Sam Spratt. The monument really is a crossover between a lot of what I'm loving about fine digital art on chain. So it's an extraordinary digital painting that took thousands of hours and a year. He worked on it every day for a year.
01:04:35.810 - 01:05:09.620, Speaker A: It has an incredible amount of detail. It's 70,000 pixels. We will display it in museums on massive, massive screens so that people can interact with it. And that's the other part, is that it's a crypto game, so you could buy an edition. That edition gave you the right to make an observation on the work, and so it engaged a community. People got really excited about it because they could participate in the art creation as well, and it kind of feels more like theirs as well. They have some small part in this.
01:05:09.620 - 01:06:08.194, Speaker A: And these are the things that we really enjoy about this generation of digital artists using crypto primitives to create a new class of collectors and really engage their community. We see this with people. We see this with Rafiq Anadal. You know, our piece from Rafiq is up at the moment right now and has broken every record that the MoMA has for average time in front of a work, you know, in front of starry night, in front of water lilies, in front of every work ever. It reminds us that this remarkable digital art is one of the things that will bring people back to museums. And people are really getting excited about digital art and the crucible moment for digital art. The knee of the curve has been the creation of digital scarcity.
01:06:08.194 - 01:07:02.782, Speaker A: Before crypto, if a digital artist like Rafiq or beeple sold a piece, someone could copy it and know who had, there was basically no way to has the copy. So it doesn't have any collectability. NFTs conveyed that element of collectability and digital scarcity, which allowed digital artists to find artistic and financial freedom. And I find that really, really inspiring. Before Beeple sold everydays for 69 million at Christie's, the highest he ever got for an everyday was $110. And it shows, like, you need that collectability element to it. And so while we've seen a washout, a trough of disillusionment, broadly in the NFT space, we see this pocket of really fine digital artists having pockets of success.
01:07:02.782 - 01:07:51.896, Speaker A: And we see what we're seeing on the ground day to day, is that global museums are leaning in to where the NFT community has left slack. So some of the biggest buyers right now of crypto punks, of really amazing, like, fine digital art from like Rafik and Mike and, and others have been global museums, like that is, when you think about that, like, that's mind blowing. The fact that, like, the people taking up slack right now are, you know, the m pluses and the momas and the pompey dos and, and really substantial cultural institutions, cultural gatekeepers, whether we want to admit it or not, I just find that this space to be really interesting. I lean into these artists that are using crypto primitives, and we're collaborating with.
01:07:51.920 - 01:07:52.544, Speaker C: A bunch of artists.
01:07:52.584 - 01:08:34.524, Speaker A: You'll see over the next few months a bunch of different projects that really use crypto in an interesting way to change the trajectory of the art over time and engage a community in that way. And the monument ultimately, I think, will be seen in history as the turning point in that this was the first time that an artist really leveraged crypto primitives to add a new narrative to an incredible story, along with being just great art. And so we're excited about it and excited about this movement. And I think it's going to catalyze an interesting comeback, at least for this pocket of nfTs.
01:08:35.424 - 01:08:55.713, Speaker B: Ryan, how do you, what's the, what are the two groups there, though, like, so you have the one group where you're hoping that, like, the world sees this, the best collectors, the museums. But, like, then there's the crypto side of this, which you want to interact with, a game. I don't know as much about it, but, yeah. Could you maybe just. Could you share more on the two different groups? Because it's two very different worlds there coalescing around one piece of art.
01:08:56.813 - 01:09:32.686, Speaker A: Yeah. So there's, you know, what we kind of refer to as the capital a art world. And this is, you know, the auction houses, the. The museums, the, you know, the financiers, the collectors of what we often refer to as traditional art, but is more commonly referred to in that world as contemporary art. And they rightfully, you know, take a skeptical eye to things. I think throughout art history that's been the case. People were really, you know, really skeptical about abstract expressionism, about photography.
01:09:32.686 - 01:10:20.044, Speaker A: Every new movement is met with poo poo from. From the art world. It's just kind of the nature of the beast. And then we have, you know, the crypto community who, you know, who has engaged with a certain kind of, like, community element of art. So, like, obviously, pfps had a certain moment, and one of one, digital art has had some, like, elements of success, but it's been really sort of isolated to a handful of artists. You know, Beeple, Rafiq, Anadal, now Sam Spratt, a few others. And the capital a art world has no interest whatsoever in, like, the collection stuff, the, like, social clubs of, you know, of, like, bored apes or whatever.
01:10:20.044 - 01:11:05.076, Speaker A: There is a little bit. There is more respect for cryptopunks as an isolated art project because of its originality. But other than that, no, what I think they are starting to wake up to is that digital art has and belongs rightfully to within art canon. And up until now, digital artists have not had the rightful place in art canon. There is no digital artist who really has been globally celebrated on the level of a Jeff Koons or a Damien Hirst or any contemporary master. And I think we're starting to see a sea change in that, and that is culturally important. I think it'll also be financially important.
01:11:05.076 - 01:11:20.864, Speaker A: Right. Like, you know, people who own Rafiq anodals are going to do very well over the years because he's going to be seen as one of the defining artists of this generation. But more importantly, it's culturally important that digital art is art, and that's kind of what we're trying to do here.
01:11:24.684 - 01:11:40.116, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, one thing that I mean, you're the expert here, Ryan, but one thing that I always thought was kind of interesting was like, the great artists are celebrated years after they're dead. It seems like the great artists in the NFT world are being celebrated while they're alive. I don't know which is soul reference there.
01:11:40.220 - 01:11:43.060, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
01:11:43.212 - 01:12:39.160, Speaker C: I mean, there's a, for a lot of the skeptics and critics of the art world, and a lot of times they criticize what is happening in digital art and saying, that's not real art or whatnot, but they don't have a full appreciation of how different art movements happen over time, to your point, Ryan. But Picasso, I think, went through an evolution of, like, not being very popular. And during his lifetime, he painted so many different things and never got traction. And he was very much a salesman. And like, you know, he did these clubs and, like, you know, history repeats itself. And I think for what I found is, you know, people that really understand art have studied art throughout history, have a finer appreciation for digital art and its place, to your point line, its cultural relevance and as a movement in and of itself. And it's really, the more collectors that look have made money and be like, hey, I want to buy, like, a Damon Hearst, because, you know, that's what you do.
01:12:39.160 - 01:12:56.284, Speaker C: You want to wear a coons because, you know, it's flashy, and you put it on display and people recognize it. That camp is perhaps a little more skeptical, but over time, it's always that, like, those people end up buying it two, three, four, in ten years time, 20 years time. And that's okay. That's normally how these work.
01:12:56.444 - 01:13:39.686, Speaker A: No, I mean 100%. The art world moves slower than it should, and our space sometimes moves faster than it should. But one of the great things that crypto native primitives have brought to digital artists is that they can tap a global market for the first time. Right? Like, if you have a Picasso on your wall, the chances that somebody is going to pass by it, love it enough to make you an offer, and you're going to accept that offer very, very remote. Right. But the art that you hold on chain is essentially, like, available for sale at any time. And artists conceptually should get royalties.
01:13:39.686 - 01:14:10.154, Speaker A: I think that's a topic for another, for another podcast. But we have a way of potentially changing the business model and again, distributing more of the value to the artist. So it's a great movement for the artists, and that's why great artists are leaning into it. And you can find really amazing artists making great digital art. And NFts in this moment, and that's what we're so excited about.
01:14:11.544 - 01:14:21.144, Speaker B: Ryan, just one last question here. I mean, could you maybe share your views on the whole royalty debate in the art world? Because, like, opensea, blur, like, a lot.
01:14:21.184 - 01:14:26.096, Speaker C: There's a whole new pod. I don't want to open that box.
01:14:26.120 - 01:14:29.376, Speaker A: That's a topic for another pod. Come back to that.
01:14:29.560 - 01:14:35.884, Speaker C: We got to save some stuff for another pod. Controversial. And I gotta. I gotta sharpen my axe.
01:14:37.004 - 01:14:38.380, Speaker B: All right, well, start going hard at.
01:14:38.412 - 01:14:39.372, Speaker C: Blur, and that's okay.
01:14:39.388 - 01:14:48.500, Speaker A: I respect all attempts at innovation, but at the same time. Yeah, we'll unpack that in a future episode. Stay tuned.
01:14:48.652 - 01:14:50.820, Speaker B: I didn't know about the pre existing Twitter debate.
01:14:50.852 - 01:15:01.680, Speaker C: Let the record show that I am very much pro the inefficiency, and the creator should be fairly compensated. I'll leave it at that. But there's nuance in this discussion, and we should pick it up in next.
01:15:01.752 - 01:15:18.472, Speaker A: I'm actually super excited to be educated and really, like, think through this in an open minded fashion from first principles. I actually am very confident that you'll have influence on the way that I see it, and I'm excited to go through that.
01:15:18.568 - 01:15:19.328, Speaker C: This is fine, guys.
01:15:19.376 - 01:15:19.944, Speaker B: Until next time.
