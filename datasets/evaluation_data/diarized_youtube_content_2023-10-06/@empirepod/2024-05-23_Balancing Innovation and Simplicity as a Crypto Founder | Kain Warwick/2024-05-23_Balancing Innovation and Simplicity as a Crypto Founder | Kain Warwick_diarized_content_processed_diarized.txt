00:00:00.160 - 00:00:29.184, Speaker A: Like, empirical evidence is the most valuable thing that you could have in the world, right? All of the theories, all of the models, all of systems you can build to try and understand something. Nothing is as powerful as empirical evidence. And so if you go and build a thing and say, do you like this? And everyone says no, you go, hmm, okay, interesting. If you go and build something, and then you keep building and building and building and extending and extending, extending, and you come back and you say, do you like this? And they say, no, you've wasted two years of your life. Right? It's crazy.
00:00:31.804 - 00:00:39.584, Speaker B: All righty, everybody. What's up? We got Kane. Kane no longer introducing you as synthetix. We've got infinex, right?
00:00:39.884 - 00:00:41.252, Speaker A: Awesome. That's right.
00:00:41.348 - 00:00:47.036, Speaker B: Is there a dictator of benevolent dictator of infinix, or we're dropping the dictator.
00:00:47.220 - 00:00:59.118, Speaker A: Unfortunately, I think we front ran that whole thing. There was never a dictatorship. We went straight to decentralized governance. So I didn't even get a chance to be the dictator, unfortunately.
00:00:59.166 - 00:01:14.154, Speaker B: Fancy. So fancy. So boring, too. But that's okay a little bit. Dude, how's it feel to be, like an ETh OG? Still. Still out here, as Chamath would say in the arena? Or I guess maybe that was Teddy Roosevelt, who then, who originally said it. But we can credit.
00:01:16.334 - 00:01:53.736, Speaker A: You know, it's interesting. I've tweeted about this a little bit, right. Like, coming out of the bear market, I definitely feel underexposed to eat and even BTC for a whole bunch of reasons. Like, just structural reasons, especially on the synthetic side. One of the challenges with synthetics is that there's built in leverage, but in the bear market, you got to pay that debt down. And so a lot of my ETH and BTC went to paying down debt in the synthetics ecosystem. Like late 22, even into 23.
00:01:53.920 - 00:01:55.200, Speaker B: Your own debts or the debts.
00:01:55.272 - 00:02:24.924, Speaker A: Yeah, paying down. Yeah. Everyone's got their own debt in synthetics, right? Like, you know, this built in leverage. You got to mint susd against SNx, right? So, you know, leverage is a dangerous drug, and even when it feels, you know, like it's not that much leverage, you're still. You're still levered if you're borrowing against volatile assets. So, you know, definitely lost cycle some lessons about high leverage there, and, you know, or trying to basically rebuild the ETH stack again.
00:02:25.464 - 00:02:46.656, Speaker B: I mean, dude, if you feel underexposed. I definitely feel underexposed if you're underexposed. Damn. How does it feel? Like, maybe less on the investing side, but just on the building side. I mean, we were talking about, like, we were kind of laughing before we hit record about this. This Kobe piece. And, you know, I feel like a lot of blockworks employees were like, who's Kobe? And I was like, man, that's a trip.
00:02:46.656 - 00:03:00.444, Speaker B: And I bet a lot of people are like, who's Kane? So, I mean, how do you think about just still being out here building, like, still trying to, like, get attention and, like, do you gotta do the marketing thing? You gotta go hire the people? Like, how. How's the grind right now?
00:03:00.784 - 00:03:19.952, Speaker A: I think it's interesting. Like, the OGS know the ogs, but new people that came in, you know, during the late bull and stayed through the bear often don't. Right. You know, so Kobe's an interesting one. Like, he's had his account locked on Twitter for a while now. I'm not sure exactly how long. But, you know, that cuts off attention.
00:03:19.952 - 00:04:01.134, Speaker A: Like, that's the main point for people knowing who you are, especially if you're not tweeting much through the bear market. You're not on people's radar. I think the interesting thing on the e defi og side is, like, the three year Defi bear market that was foreshadowed by Djen Spartan has turned into the four year defi bear market. It's still going. I don't think Defi's had its resurgence yet, mainly because ETH hasn't had its resurgence. So NFTs, I think, took a lot of the wind out of Defi loss cycle. And meme coins have taken a bit of the wind out of the sales of defi this cycle.
00:04:01.134 - 00:04:27.922, Speaker A: So there will be a moment where Defi has its resurgence, but it hasn't happened yet. If you're a Defi OG, like Robert Leshner, or obviously people know Hayden, I think uniswap is so big that you really can't avoid knowing who Hayden is. But, you know, there's a lot of people that were pre defi summer that the average person in crypto today who's slinging meme points would not know who they are.
00:04:28.058 - 00:04:45.028, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. It's interesting. I was asking one of our employees the other day about Ave. I know I mentioned Stani because we're talking about speakers for permissionless. They're like, oh, Stani. Like, he's. He created lens, right? And I was like, yeah, well, and Ave, he's like, oh, Ave.
00:04:45.028 - 00:04:49.900, Speaker B: I think I've heard of that. I was like, oh, man. Living in a different world right now.
00:04:50.052 - 00:04:50.744, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:04:51.444 - 00:05:11.468, Speaker B: Like, what's the decision? What was the decision, like, to, you know, if you look at, like, Stanis got Ave lens, Lechner's got. He was doing compound, walked away from that to do super state and kind of handed over the keys to Jason over there. You know, Hayden's still doing uniswap. Like, what was the decision, like, to. You're not doing synthetix at all, right. You're 100% on Infinix.
00:05:11.636 - 00:05:21.124, Speaker A: Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Not even on councils anymore. I even, it's so bad that I forgot to vote in the last election. They're gonna stream me out.
00:05:21.164 - 00:05:22.356, Speaker B: Fully out. That's good.
00:05:22.500 - 00:06:01.096, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm fully out. Like, I, like, I knew that epoch was getting close, but, like, we were so close to launching with Infinix that, you know, I was, I was like, I got a vote and then I was like, oh, man, that was yesterday. Oops. So, yeah, it's. It's really hard. This is, I would say, probably the third time in my career where I've had two different projects or companies running. There was a period where blue shift, my payments company that I built in 2014, that was an on ramp to crypto in Australia for a lot of the crypto exchanges and brokerages.
00:06:01.096 - 00:06:23.718, Speaker A: I was running blue shift and starting haven at the same time. And it's just a nightmare. It's really, really hard to split focus and you sort of do a disservice to both. So it didn't take too long. I think it was somewhere in 2018 where I went to the blue ship board and I was like, look, I just can't do this anymore. I need to hand it over to someone else. I'm not doing a good job of kind of running this.
00:06:23.718 - 00:06:59.172, Speaker A: And, you know, I think it's kind of a similar situation where I just had to, like, say goodbye to synthetix and, you know, even things like, there were many years where I read every single message in discord, in the synthetics discord. You know, I was responding to everything. You know, I was. I was really on top of all the different governance things. And over the last year, as Infinix has ramped up, especially once I took over as the working group lead, it's just been impossible. And so I'm like, I can't even stay in touch with what's happening, at which point my opinions are no longer informed opinions. So you can't really trust them, but people will.
00:06:59.172 - 00:07:14.196, Speaker A: So it's actually a net negative for me to come out and say something that's uninformed. And then people go, oh, he's probably right. And like, I was never probably right, but now I'm definitely not right. So you just have to let it go and let governance kind of play itself out.
00:07:14.300 - 00:07:25.940, Speaker B: Nice. That's great. Yeah, I remember, I think it was summer 2020, or maybe it was fall. Maybe it was the end of 2020. You guys were debating what to name the synthetix front end. Like when I think I still. Almost.
00:07:25.940 - 00:07:50.810, Speaker B: When I think of Infinix, it's like, oh, it's the synthetix front end. So tell me, take us through that journey of being like, hey, synthetix needs this better. Front end needs a good user experience for synthetix all the way until now. I was in the little test group. That's when I had this oh, shit. Moment of, this is a platform. It's got best in class account abstraction.
00:07:50.810 - 00:07:59.230, Speaker B: It's multi chain deployment. Take me through that journey of going from synthetix front end to, oh, wow, there's actually a massive opportunity here. Yeah.
00:07:59.262 - 00:08:46.588, Speaker A: So the original thesis was that we have solved the protocol level functionality problem. And in order to solve that, there were a whole bunch of things that needed to go right. We needed l two s. We needed even 4844 was part of this, that you needed cheap enough, fast enough execution, that an exchange that was running on an l two could compete credibly with a database. Like the delta wasn't so large that it was like, I'm only using this for ideological reasons. I'm not actually using this because it's a better experience, right? And a whole bunch of things like liquidity and number of assets and number of markets and all of that stuff over. It took a long time, took longer than we all thought it would.
00:08:46.588 - 00:09:18.730, Speaker A: But eventually we got to a point where it's like, okay, this thing is real. You look at DydX, you look at GMX, even hyper liquid. Now, in synthetix, there's a number of different exchanges that, on paper, can compete with a centralized exchange. And yet, if you go back a year ago, and this is where I had this realization, binance is still beating all of the on chain exchanges, 50 to one by volume. So we're in a bear market. It's only crypto native people left. We've got the tech.
00:09:18.730 - 00:09:50.406, Speaker A: Like, the tech is there, right? And yet despite all of that, we're just getting absolutely chopped up by binance still, right? And so I was like, all right, something has to change here. There's something wrong. Like, what is it? I went back to first principles and I was like, it's actually, the onboarding experience. People who are used to trading on binance are used to the web, two off. They're used to a username and password and, you know, MFA and all of that stuff. And there's a lot of them that just don't trade on chain or don't do on chain transactions at all. And they're still crypto natives.
00:09:50.406 - 00:10:41.536, Speaker A: They've still been in crypto for years. That their version of crypto is just binance, though, right? Trading perps or spot on finance. And so I was like, all right, let's actually test this. Let's build a centralized wrapper around a decentralized protocol and see if we can bridge that ux gap. That was. That was the original thesis, right? It took about three weeks to realize that that was insane and not a good idea, and that we actually didn't even need to do that, really, that we could potentially not make it completely centralized. And so I think that by the time we got to late last year, we realized that there were a number of different infrastructure plays that have been built in the bear market that could allow us to connect them together in such a way as to bridge the UX gap without requiring centralization.
00:10:41.536 - 00:11:13.054, Speaker A: And so that's when we were like, all right, let's pivot to Infinix. And once we realized that, that we could actually bridge this Ux gap and build a Ux layer on top of defi, it was like, well, it feels silly to just build this for an exchange, right? There's a whole bunch of other stuff that is very useful. Right. For us to do. And so, you know, whether it's, like, yield bearing assets like Athena, or lending, like Aave or spot swaps like Jupiter or Uniswap, there's just too many things that you can do with this to focus on a perps Dex. And so that's what happened. So we.
00:11:13.054 - 00:11:19.914, Speaker A: We basically, you know, got to a point where we're like, this needs to be an actual platform, not an exchange play.
00:11:20.534 - 00:11:27.022, Speaker B: Who's the we here? Do you have co founders, or is it like a small team and you're. You're the solo founder, or. What's the. What's the. Who's the we?
00:11:27.198 - 00:11:46.540, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a good question. So. So when I first started this, the person who was building it with me was working in my family office, and I was like, hey, do you want to build this thing with me? You know, should take us a month or so to just build, like, a. On top of synthetics, right? A level of like insanity, that's required, right?
00:11:46.572 - 00:12:06.304, Speaker B: Yeah. So it was just the two year anniversary of, like, launching blockworks research, and Mike and I dug up some old messages to each other and we're like, we think it'll cost two hundred k and we'll need three people, and we could probably run it like that for a while. And now we are like, 25 people and millions later. Like, I'm like, all right.
00:12:06.804 - 00:12:17.720, Speaker A: I think, you know, there's a level of, like, irrational exuberance that's required to start something that if you knew how painful it would be, you never would start.
00:12:17.752 - 00:12:18.724, Speaker B: I would never do it.
00:12:20.624 - 00:12:50.544, Speaker A: There was definitely that component. I was like, a couple of people together, throw an interface up. We should build, smash this out in a couple of months. By the time we realized what the actual opportunity was to build this ux layer on top of DPI, I was like, okay, now this is a multi year exercise we started. You know, I allocated more capital to it. I've been bootstrapping it myself, but I allocated more capital to it. And we went out and, like, aqua hired a couple of teams and, you know, we've built a team now of like 35 people.
00:12:50.544 - 00:13:18.726, Speaker A: So it's a big, it's a big crew that are running this. Yeah, I put in about $25 million so far. Now, we haven't used all of that. Like, we're not insane, right? But the reason why I did that was because once I realized, I was like, all right, this thing is way bigger than we thought. It's going to need a lot of funding. It's going to need a lot of people. There's a lot of infrastructure that needs to be built.
00:13:18.726 - 00:13:45.524, Speaker A: And I just wanted to make sure that we had no constraints, basically. And at that point, I was like, all right, I'm all in. So the person who started it with me was the working group lead when we launched the governance process. A bunch of things have happened in the interim. And it just got to the point where I was like, this thing is too big. I need to actually step in and run this working group. There's too many people.
00:13:45.524 - 00:14:06.750, Speaker A: It needs someone who's experienced in D five, experienced in crypto. And I was like, all right, time to step up. It wasn't my intention. Had I known that I was going to be running this thing and sleeping 4 hours a night, I probably would have just said, I'll let someone else do it. You know, once, once I realized the opportunity, I was like, all right, I got to dive in.
00:14:06.862 - 00:14:16.994, Speaker B: Yeah. So the way you describe it is interesting. The way you describe it is like the UI or the UX layer for DeFi, as opposed to finance on chain or something like that.
00:14:18.134 - 00:14:40.514, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that the thesis is basically that you have a bunch of people building protocols, right. And, you know, some that we're very close to. Right. And they probably wouldn't be offended to hear this. But one good example is wormhole. Wormhole has built this very solid protocol. It powers a bunch of things.
00:14:40.514 - 00:15:18.844, Speaker A: It is being extended to support cross chain queries. It's a really hard thing to build at a protocol level. Then you use the portal bridge interface and you're like, this is incredibly painful to use. I don't think that would be surprising for them to hear. It just is. Now that we've built this UX layer and we have the platform, we have already started working on bridging functionality and the bridging functionality that we built, there's an early demo which you'll probably get access to because I think you're in the testing group. You'll probably get access to it in the next couple of weeks.
00:15:18.844 - 00:16:17.650, Speaker A: It just works. The reason why it just works is because we have a bunch of middleware that we built. We've abstracted gas, we've abstracted all of these things, and so we can be a lot more opinionated on the flows that we're enabling. We've just got a lot of people who are very focused on the user experience and we sort of see it as the platform is ready. Our integrations into other protocols that are on chain is where the secret sauce is. Our ability to integrate something and build a better front end experience, end to end, from onboarding all the way through to on chain transactions, is where we're going to win and we've got the right team for it. We've gone out and looked for people that have that domain expertise, rather than people who are, let's say, on chain focused, whether it's programs on Solana or smart contracts on Ethereum.
00:16:17.782 - 00:16:25.054, Speaker B: Yeah. How much easier is it to build now, going from like zero to one than it was building synthetics in the beginning?
00:16:25.714 - 00:16:50.384, Speaker A: It is a lot easier. There's certain things. Certain tooling, like canon for example, is one of the tools that we use for multi chain deployments. It just makes it a lot easier. Is it easy? No, it's still very hard. Right. I think the challenge is that in the early days of synthetix, we were struggling to deploy 50 contracts onto mainnet.
00:16:50.384 - 00:17:30.881, Speaker A: That process would take us several days. Sometimes you can go back and look at, hey, we started the deployment in discord, and then three days later, it's like. And we've just finished the deployment. Good job. That process was really hard. Now, though, we're talking about simultaneous cross chain deployments on five EVM chains and Solana, synchronizing a bunch of middleware and a bunch of off chain infrastructure and having all of that go live. When we did our launch, there was a countdown timer, which for me, as a defi OG was petrifying because I've never seen anything in Defi actually launched at the right time.
00:17:30.881 - 00:18:04.062, Speaker A: And so there's this countdown timer and we're counting down. It's like, this feels really dangerous. And then the countdown timer ended and it worked. It was all deployed, it was all there and it just worked. So, yes, it's much easier to build, but I think the scope of what we're trying to build has gotten much, much larger. But for the user, that's great, because it means that we're actually trying to solve the user experience problems that previously we couldn't even tackle because it was just too hard to even get stuff on chain. So the scope of what we're trying to do is much larger.
00:18:04.062 - 00:18:11.480, Speaker A: So I think the difficulty is probably equivalent. It's just the experience that you get as the end user is far better now.
00:18:11.582 - 00:18:24.264, Speaker B: Yeah. Can you tell me, like, as specifically as possible, like, what you guys are using? Like, do you, like, what'd you say, canon? Or, like, do you use privy? Like, what are these apps that make it so easy? And, like, what are the tools that make it easy?
00:18:24.724 - 00:18:58.368, Speaker A: Yeah, so the architecture is. And this, one of the big decisions we made was to go with poskies. So we had a number of delays. And I think that, you know, obviously delays are never great, but sometimes they play into your hands. And I think in this particular instance, it definitely played into our hands. So we were originally using a couple of different options for key management and how we synchronized keys and how a user would execute a transaction. So there's a bunch of different ways you can do this.
00:18:58.368 - 00:19:27.204, Speaker A: Keys in browser, things like privy. But what we realized is that passkeys were actually ready. We decided to go with passkeys. The advantage that we have by launching with passkeys only and no passwords is we will never have legacy password support. If you are a platform that launched last year, let's say prior to June last year, you didn't really have an option. Pass key support was not there. You had to actually launch with passwords.
00:19:27.204 - 00:20:07.162, Speaker A: And so you now have this dual track system where you have legacy users with passwords that you've got to wean off onto pass keys because it's just that much better of an experience. But it might take you years to do that. So by delaying launch and waiting for the cross platform passkey support to get better, and I would say very good. Now, there's a few little gaps, but for most platforms, especially on Apple, it's very robust. So passkeys is the starting point. A user has a passkey. The passkey is similar to like EoA or a hardware wallet or something like that.
00:20:07.162 - 00:20:42.940, Speaker A: You've got this cryptographic scheme that is connected to a platform that stores keys. The platform that stores the keys is called Turnkey. It's made by the same people who built Coinbase custody. So the Passkey connects to your own signing key that's then connected to an on chain account. That's cross chain. So you have an account that's deployed to base, optimism, Mainnet, and then Solana as well. And that key that you have is an eoa that's stored in Turnkey that allows you to interact with your account.
00:20:42.940 - 00:21:29.222, Speaker A: And then we use gelato for gas abstraction. So basically you have this gasless signing mechanism where you log in with a pass key. We create a session for you, and then within that session you can do a whole bunch of things, right? You can claim your points and you can do swaps or trades. This is obviously future functionality, but you would just sign in once with a passkey. Once you've got your session initiated, then you can do a whole bunch of things. If you then decide that you want to do something that requires some kind of auth escalation, then you would need to sign in with your pass key again and maybe use some other MFA, or maybe you use an EOA or some escalation process to withdraw. Right.
00:21:29.222 - 00:22:01.302, Speaker A: And so we can build kind of a role based security system that looks more like what you would expect in web two. So you can have sub accounts and you can have, okay, you're allowed to do these functions, and then you've got an analyst who's only allowed to do a subset of those functions. So there's all kinds of things that we can do where we can leverage all of the work that's gone into web two, auth and web two security and replicate that, but with still the account living on chain.
00:22:01.438 - 00:22:23.294, Speaker B: Yeah, it's really nice. Maybe I'll share my screen in a second and show people. Just like, the onboarding. It's actually really really clean. Let's see. That's the stack. What about the integration layer? Once you're in, you guys want to launch the ability to bridge between optimism and Polygon and Solana and then do a swap and then maybe take a borrow.
00:22:23.294 - 00:22:37.214, Speaker B: How do you think about integrations with different people for bridging? Do you build a bridge? Do you partner with wormhole swapping? Do you do. I don't even know, uniswap hooks or whatever. How do you think about integrating?
00:22:38.514 - 00:23:22.508, Speaker A: At the moment, it's a very ad hoc, manual process. For our initial bridging, we're using wormhole. So we've basically used wormhole, a combination of CCQ, which is their cross chain queries, and the standard wormhole bridging, which other people use but then have built liquidity bridges on top of. So we don't have liquidity bridging yet. We likely will either partner with someone that has liquidity bridges or build our own liquidity bridges. But the way that the architecture works is you have an account, it's yours. Your assets are in that account on any number of chains, on any one of the six chains.
00:23:22.508 - 00:24:28.360, Speaker A: So you could have USDC on four different chains, but it's the same account, controlled by the same EOA that's stored in turnkey that you control via your passkey. So for you, if you want to move funds from base to optimism, all you need to do is just authorize that with passkey, and then the platform itself figures out the routes and where things need to go. Once we've got functionality that's being integrated, for example, curve swaps. So, stablecoin swaps, because we've started with stablecoins USDC, both wrapped and bridged USDC, we need a way to do stable point swaps. That's the most obvious functionality. What we've done is we've created a piece of middleware, like a smart contract that lives outside of your account that you can opt into enabling so you can say, okay, I want to upgrade my account to support curve swaps. And then you've got the curve contracts that live outside of that.
00:24:28.360 - 00:25:19.432, Speaker A: And the advantage to this is that you don't have your account with specific permissions. You've got another contract that's been deployed that basically understands the interface between the smart account that controls your funds, that holds your funds and curve. And so we can then upgrade that integration of curve changes. So it's basically these middleware contracts that sit outside of your account that are bridged between your account and curve. Your account and uniswap your account. And you have the ability to enable these and set permissions on like a per protocol level, like a per integration level or opt out of it. You can say, actually, I don't want to integrate with green finance, which I guess, apparently no one knows what that is today.
00:25:19.432 - 00:25:42.402, Speaker A: I sound like a boomer, but you might be like, look, that's too high risk for me. I want to switch that off. That functionality. I don't want. You have a lot of granular control when you go to your security settings, which features do you want to enable? Which ones do you not want to enable? Which ones do you want to require escalation? Which ones are you happy to do? You know, but just a simple task. You sign it.
00:25:42.578 - 00:26:00.118, Speaker B: Huh, that's really cool. Do you think that, like, if you play this out, maybe three, four, five years into the future, you guys will start having to chip away at the stack? Like, you'll go deeper into building some of those protocols yourself to maybe capture more of the flow or have better margins or whatever, whatever it may be.
00:26:00.306 - 00:26:25.014, Speaker A: I certainly hope not. That would be dark. I really hope we don't have to do that. There's so much innovation. My example before, there are people that are crypto native, or whatever we would call that crypto native, they're on crypto Twitter. They just live in finance. The only functionality that they ever get from on chain activity is what binance gives them, the scraps that binance throws them.
00:26:25.014 - 00:26:57.524, Speaker A: To say, you can do this now, you do eats taking whatever. But like 95% of the fun on chain things, fantasy top, right? Probably not going to get integrated into binance. That level of innovation, those on chain games and on chain protocols that are being deployed every day, you want to be able to access. But for a person who's lived in finance their entire life, they're like, I don't know about this metamorphosis. I'm just not doing it. And even. Okay, so you say, fine, privy.
00:26:57.524 - 00:27:34.682, Speaker A: So you can sign in with privy. There's really harsh trade offs with that. There's a level of risk around custody, et cetera. So the onboarding process for a lot of these protocols that have been trying to bridge the UX gap, in my opinion, makes some trade offs that I think are not ideal. So we would love to be able to integrate something like fantasy top. Are we going to build something like fantasy top? No, we're just not. It's a lot of effort to do that, and we're never going to be able to out compete all of the innovation on chain.
00:27:34.682 - 00:27:52.254, Speaker A: We just want to be able to give that innovation a larger audience to bridge the UX gap. So we become the UX layer so people can be easily onboarded. Everyone's got an Infinix account, there's a ton of TVL. All their assets are stored in there. And I'll give you another example. Right. 2021.
00:27:52.254 - 00:29:15.638, Speaker A: All the people who got onboarded into nfts but were not onboarded into good OpSEc, they didnt have hardware wallets. They fomoed into nfts, and it was enough fomo that was created to get them on chain but not in a safe way. The amount of funds that were drained and lost and seed phrases, etcetera. If something like Infinix had existed back then and nfts were integrated into Infinix, we would have just connected you to opensea or to blur or to whatever NFT platform you wanted to trade on and you wouldn't be able to get fished because pass keys are much more resistant to phishing and to bad links and what have you, because you're actually in this kind of walled garden that protects you from someone being able to get you to, you can't sign a transaction, there's no malicious signing. You're not signing random transactions, you're only touching things that are already vetted and you've opted into. Yeah, you can go and sell an entity on Opensea, but you can't accidentally sell the wrong NFT because the integration has been done properly. And so literally hundreds of millions of dollars would have been saved through that know nft mania if something like Infinix had existed.
00:29:15.726 - 00:29:24.358, Speaker B: Hmm. Who, where, where do you get the TVL from? You guys are so you are at like what, 80,000,085, 90 million Tvl right now?
00:29:24.526 - 00:29:26.150, Speaker A: Yeah, almost, almost 90.
00:29:26.302 - 00:29:29.154, Speaker B: Almost 90 after what, six days, seven days.
00:29:29.574 - 00:29:31.246, Speaker A: Today is the 8th day.
00:29:31.350 - 00:29:32.414, Speaker B: 8Th day. That's good.
00:29:32.454 - 00:29:32.774, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:29:32.854 - 00:29:34.030, Speaker B: And how do you know users?
00:29:34.062 - 00:30:10.044, Speaker A: Like 10,000 roughly, there are about 7000 accounts created. So one interesting thing, right? We had 200,000 people on our waitlist, right. And we were kind of curious to see if anyone had worked out how to do a bot, farmed past key onboarding. And it turns out that you actually kind of can't, the tech isn't there. Pos keys are so new that like bot farms haven't worked out how to do it. And there's like browser based constraints and stuff. So, you know, could you just sit there with a team of 20 people in front of laptops pressing buttons.
00:30:10.044 - 00:30:15.064, Speaker A: Yes, of course. Right. Like, you know, the phone meme of like 100 phones on a big wall.
00:30:15.524 - 00:30:18.524, Speaker B: There's much easier things that you can go civil attack right now.
00:30:18.644 - 00:30:48.360, Speaker A: Exactly. So you know, one thing is we, we deliberately created an incentive scheme that didn't incentivize civils. That was, that was step one. Right. And then step two is pass keys are actually, you know, a really resistant measure against civils. And so we have I think seven or 8000 users of which about 50% of deposited funds, which is great. Right? Like we're paying all the gas, we're not having sybils come in and like drain gas, et cetera.
00:30:48.360 - 00:31:06.526, Speaker A: So you know, it's been a very sort of efficient process and we're getting a better sense of like how many actual users do we have? Because yeah, of course you can create a couple of accounts and there's some people that are like name squatting, but you know, it's not like orders of magnitude out our user base versus the actual humans that are using the protocol.
00:31:06.630 - 00:31:33.204, Speaker B: Yeah, let's uh, let's go into sybils right now. So you had this tweet thread. We can, we can link in the show notes if people want to read. The whole thing is from May 3 said man, layer zero. You're really going to make me write up another thread, huh? And it's about sybils. So just talking about how like, no, look, no one wants to reward these sybils, but DePEndinG on the game, symbols are either not a big deal or catastrophic. If the game has capped rewards for address or non linear reward, scaling symbols must be killed with fire.
00:31:33.204 - 00:31:52.688, Speaker B: But if the rewards are not scaled or uncapped, then sybils have no advantage. In fact, they're disadvantaged because it costs more than just doing all the activity on one address. I won't read the whole thread, but maybe you can just expand on like, yeah. Your thoughts on just like Sybil attacks and like Sybils and like, I don't even know if I'm pronouncing it right after all these years. Sybils.
00:31:52.736 - 00:32:29.990, Speaker A: No, Sybil's right. Yeah, yeah, that's right. You'll say cyber. Yeah. So the, this comes from a long, long history of learning lessons in building incentive schemes. We did so many of these different schemes in synthetics to incentivize different behavior in different ways at different times in different groups of users. One thing that I learned and one thing that I've said many times in discord and on Twitter is anything that you build that can be gamed, will be gamed.
00:32:29.990 - 00:33:14.320, Speaker A: Crypto is the most adversarial place. You know, the incentives are so powerful that if you build something that's gameable, it will be gamed. It's not like, oh, let's hope that it's not gamed. Or maybe no one will notice. Like, if it's a genuine thing that has value, people will game it, right? Like, there are thousands of people scouring crypto at all hours of the day looking for the most minute advantage. Like, from a market efficiency standpoint, gaming incentives in crypto is a very efficient market. So, okay, what do you do with that information? Well, you have to really be informed when you're designing an incentive scheme.
00:33:14.320 - 00:34:20.713, Speaker A: You really need to take that into account. If you just yolo build something and hope you're just going to get run over. The challenge is, though, that there's trade offs. Like, it's trade offs all the way down, right? So if you say, okay, we're going to avoid civils, really the only way to avoid civils is to do a linear distribution, right? But then that, you know, helps whales, right? And so you're going to have a situation where people either say you're just saving the whales, right? You're protecting whales and giving them a huge advantage, right? Or you have a situation where sibyls run over all of your users and take everything, and there's no avoiding that trade off. Like, it's a very clear trade off, and you have to pick where you want to be on that continuum. The problem is people try and have it both ways. They sort of say, let's build a thing that kind of incentivizes sybils and makes it look like we're disadvantaging whales, because then the optics will look good, and then people turn up and they get nothing and they're like, what just happened? Like, all my money was stolen.
00:34:20.713 - 00:35:12.090, Speaker A: And it's like the sibling ends up looking good for metrics as well. And so when you're a project that's out there that's designed an incentive scheme that absolutely incentivizes sibyls and knowingly goes out and talks about the metrics that you've incentivized for the Sybils to do, and then gets to the very end of that game and goes, oh, man, how? I don't even know what's going on here. How did this happen? Right? Like, sorry, guys, that you got nothing and that a bunch of bots got everything. This is crazy. How could anyone have predicted this? It's like, no, no, everyone could have predicted this. You did this on purpose. And then you talked about the metrics and then you sit there and play dumb and try and pretend like you had nothing to do with it, right? And so you either have to be honest with the community and say, we're going to do a distribution that disadvantages Sybils.
00:35:12.090 - 00:36:00.384, Speaker A: The trade off here is that, yes, there will be some whale accounts that get a lot, but at least those whale accounts will be real people, right? It won't be a bob farm. Now, at the end of the day, all of this is inefficient, right? And all of this inefficiency comes from the fact that you cannot get tokens in the hands of your users other than giving them away for free. And like, that just is a terrible idea. Like, it's a fine idea as, like a slight bonus for some people that were early and paying attention as your only mechanism for aligning yourself with the community. It's horrific, right? And we see what happens. The community's like, you've given away a bunch of money to people who are mercenary and have dumped it. I actually care about this project and I'm aligned.
00:36:00.384 - 00:36:04.320, Speaker A: I got nothing now. I hate you. Like, no one wins, right?
00:36:04.392 - 00:36:17.840, Speaker B: I saw your tweet, the dimension airdrop, and you're, I think it's mentioned and you're like, because I wasn't in the discord and didn't click confirm or something, like, I didn't even get this, but I, you know, but I was early supporting, I think that was you. Something like that.
00:36:17.992 - 00:36:57.714, Speaker A: So, yeah, I think it was actually my, my kids, they're pudgy penguins holders and, you know, it's my responsibility to go and claim the airdrops that all the pudgies get on their behalf because they're seven and four. And, you know, I don't, I don't want them to get to 18 and be like dimensions worth a trillion dollars and you miss the airdrop, you idiot. So. But yeah, again, like, you know, you have to, you have to set up the incentives in a way that actually gets you the behavior that you want. Right? If you set up the incentives in a way that gets you the behavior that you don't want, but then pretend like that's not the case, people will see through it. It's, you know, people aren't idiots.
00:36:58.094 - 00:37:02.398, Speaker B: So what, so what's the, like, what's the behavior that you want? Early activity.
00:37:02.446 - 00:37:43.724, Speaker A: You want alignment? You want alignment, right? Like, we have a solution to this, right? Which is like ge alignment. Yeah. You want, like if you care about my project, you should be able to get alignment with that project, right. So the problem is that people are too scared to let people get alignment to get tokens other than giving them away for free, right. That's the only mechanism that we're willing to use. And so if you're only willing to give away tokens in order to get the right number of tokens to the people who are aligned, you have to give away so many tokens that it actually ends up hurting everyone. Right?
00:37:44.064 - 00:37:45.280, Speaker B: Why is that? Can you explain that?
00:37:45.312 - 00:37:59.068, Speaker A: Okay, so let's say you have 1000 people who are aligned with your project and so you go and you create an incentive scheme that is intended to get tokens in the hands of those thousand people.
00:37:59.216 - 00:37:59.876, Speaker B: Yep.
00:38:00.020 - 00:38:03.140, Speaker A: But you can't sell them tokens, you have to give them away for free.
00:38:03.252 - 00:38:05.020, Speaker B: Because of the, because of the regulations.
00:38:05.052 - 00:39:10.332, Speaker A: Around selling token because of interpretation, because everyone's afraid of the uncertainty and lack of clarity, right? Like in theory, I mean there are solutions here. Echo for example, right? Like Echo is trying to solve this problem of, okay, how do we do this in a compliant way given that we don't have clarity, you know, trying to find a way through this, right? So, you know, I'm bullish on that, right? I'm bullish on anyone who's trying to solve this. But just throwing your hands up and saying, well, the regulations are unclear, so we just got to try and avoid anything to me doesn't make sense. I think there are ways to let people who are early to your project get alignment that don't involve selling all the tokens to VC's. That's not the way to do it either. Let's imagine a hypothetical project that has 1000 people in a discord that are super bullish on this project. The easiest way would be to say, hey, all of you people who get this project, we're going to sell you tokens at the seed round, let's call it 30 mil or something, right? And you just sell them tokens and that's it, done, end of story.
00:39:10.332 - 00:40:03.106, Speaker A: You lock them up for six months or twelve months or whatever, they've all got alignment. They go out and they're excited about the project, they use it, they tell their friends, they help build hype, problem solved. But you're too concerned to do that because of regulatory uncertainty. And so you say, look guys, I know there's a thousand of you in the discord and I know this is an early stage project and you know, we think the vowel is 30 mil or whatever, but we can only give you tokens. So we want you to go out and do a bunch of weird stuff, right? Jump through these hoops, deposit TVL, do all of this stuff, right? And we're gonna drag it out for as long as possible, right? Because we want to game the metrics. And so we do all this stuff. We come up with this convoluted scheme to get tokens in the hands of these thousand people that were early, right? Process kicks off, a bunch of people come in and inevitably gain this incentive.
00:40:03.106 - 00:40:32.356, Speaker A: There are the whales with TBL that are just trying to extract value. They don't care about the project. They're just looking for the thing, or they're bot farmers or sybils or some combination thereof, and they turn up like locusts, and they take this free pile of money that's been put there, and they leave like, a couple of scraps, right? And the thousand people that were in your discord are sitting around being like, this is all I get. What's going on here? Like, this is not. I would have given you money for the thing, and now, you know, you've.
00:40:32.380 - 00:40:39.124, Speaker B: Actually given away your early die hard cohort and community is now pissed at you. And then they're burned.
00:40:39.284 - 00:40:58.664, Speaker A: They're burned. They're like, guys, like, come on. You know, I would. I would happily have spent $1,000 to get $1,000 worth of tokens. Instead, you forced me to go through this thing, and I didn't even get what I expected to get. I got some far less. So I get $10 worth of tokens for jumping through all these hoops.
00:40:58.664 - 00:41:48.010, Speaker A: Meanwhile, they're watching VC's buy the tokens at the same val, and they're losing on both sides. They've got people now that have gotten a token. You've had to give away 15, 20% of the token supply to try and get 1% in the hands of your thousand best people, and it didn't even work. This whole structure is just broken in so many different ways. The end result is that we need to try to find a way to get people alignment with the project early enough when they're still early. And, you know, we have to find a solution to it, because, and again, echo is one solution to it. I think there are other solutions to it.
00:41:48.010 - 00:42:02.494, Speaker A: You know, we're trying to think through how we can do it, because just doing these, you know, yield farming games is never going to be enough, and you're never going to get the alignment. And so it's an incredibly inefficient way of getting alignment with your community.
00:42:02.794 - 00:42:32.028, Speaker B: Yeah. Can you put on your, like, crypto historian hat and, like, when did this flip? Because there's a lot of, like, the. Okay, so Echo is the solution. There's, like, a quick tweet here that would say IcO's worth a solution, which some would say is right and some would say is wrong. And then you could say, maybe ico, like, the post it all kind of flipped post ICo era. But I'm very curious to get your take on, like, when this. It's capital formation and community alignment are the two things we're talking about here.
00:42:32.206 - 00:42:57.472, Speaker A: Exactly. So back in the ICO days, you would do an ICO, you would do a private sale. It would be very compressed into, like, a three to six month window. It wouldn't be a multi year process. It would be a three to six month window. You propose some scheme, you would do the ICO, you would also carve out tokens for an air trial. And that was a bonus to the community that were paying attention.
00:42:57.472 - 00:43:18.908, Speaker A: It wasn't the only alignment that they could get. And this is a critical thing. It was like, hey, if you really love the project, buy tokens. And also if you do these things, which will help us, you can get some extra tokens as a bonus for your support. Cool, done, right? And then go out, do a TGe. You know, it's all rolled up. It's a single sale.
00:43:18.908 - 00:43:39.612, Speaker A: The delta between the cheapest price that was bought off market and the TGE price would be, you know, three x, four x. Maybe. You know, maybe the earliest people who went into seed round bought tokens at. It listed at $0.30 or $0.40 or $0.50. It wasn't like people were buying tokens at zero zero.
00:43:39.612 - 00:44:01.284, Speaker A: It lists at like $0.50. Right? Like, that's insanity, right? And you can read Kobe's post if you want much more details of why that breaks down. Okay, so icos, cool plays out. Gets to, like, early 2018. Icos were really starting to fall off for reasons, right? There was a ton of inefficiency and ton of grift that was that it crept in.
00:44:01.704 - 00:44:05.808, Speaker B: 4 billion. 4 billion raised and then cooked and.
00:44:05.816 - 00:44:49.284, Speaker A: Then just a zombie chain for the rest of time. And yet, when you look at that, and I made this point in a tweet a few months ago, if icos had kept going, the market would have realized some ways, and this was already happening. There were people that were, you know, starting to dig into structure of icos and trade offs. And, you know, Vitalik proposed geicos, right, these, like, staged, you know, which was very aspirational. Maybe a little bit too. I know, right? Yeah, maybe a little too right curve for everyone, but, like, you know, the rightest edge of the right curve.
00:44:49.324 - 00:44:49.764, Speaker B: Right.
00:44:49.884 - 00:45:19.480, Speaker A: And so, like, there were people that were proposing solutions this to better align the incentives. If the market had been allowed to play out, I think we would have gotten there. There was irrational exuberance, a blow off top. The market would have figured it out in the bear market, people would have kept doing icos, and they did, but that's not what happened. Instead, you had this chilling effect of regulatory scrutiny saying, you can never do this. You can't sell tokens. They're all securities, or they're all this, or they're all that.
00:45:19.480 - 00:45:42.248, Speaker A: All of this confusion about what you could and couldn't do. The Dao ruling, et cetera, et cetera. The Dow report. And so through the end of 2018, it basically drops off to almost nothing. And then you have this resurgence of icos as ieos, initial exchange offerings.
00:45:42.336 - 00:45:44.048, Speaker B: Right? The Binance launchpad.
00:45:44.176 - 00:46:21.450, Speaker A: Binance launchpad. Everyone was doing this. Poloniacs. The problem there, in my mind, is not necessarily the structure. There was a sort of misalignment of incentives on the exchange side, where the incentive was to just push through as much as possible through these launchpads, because they were getting a free carry, 3%, 5%, 10% of the tokens in these deals. There was no alignment of incentives. It wasn't like they were investing in the ICO alongside of everyone.
00:46:21.450 - 00:46:52.088, Speaker A: They were literally saying, we have a platform that we can launch you through, and we get a free cash, so you get a free option. You're just going to pump out as many of those options as possible. There was a lot of toxic flow through that. Then people were like, ok, that's bad. Let's try to realign incentives again. Balancer launches, lbps, and there were a few other on chain mechanisms like, like this, where it was like, you know, and this started with uniswap. The.
00:46:52.088 - 00:47:49.436, Speaker A: The starting point was that we had people that were doing these, like, single sided pool things, or like, you know, there were a couple of different schemes that people came up with, like inject liquidity, like initial liquidity, you know, launches. And then balancer was like, we've got a better solution to that. And so there was this iterative process in on chain launch pads to kind of replace the IEO and then I think people got to the point where projects were like, we're too scared to even do that. Right? Even that's too risky. And that probably ended, I think, like 2020 or whatever, like, and there's still a few examples, but it's basically been since like 2021, I would say, where there was no way for anyone to get early alignment with a project at all. It just switched off almost completely. I can't think of an example.
00:47:49.460 - 00:47:53.144, Speaker B: In the last coin list, did a couple actually successful.
00:47:53.924 - 00:48:20.988, Speaker A: Yeah, coin list. But remember, coinless was not open. Right? There's still this gated KYC. It's not like if you have 1000 people in your discord, the likelihood that those people have coin list accounts is pretty small. So that early stage alignment, I mean, it's not bad, don't get me wrong. And same thing with Echo, right? I think Echo is a little bit easier for people to get access to than coinless. So it's definitely more open.
00:48:20.988 - 00:49:06.342, Speaker A: But the end result is that we've had a period since maybe the middle of the last bull run all the way through the bear market, where basically everyone just stopped doing this. And then also nfts popped up, right. And so people were going into NFT mints rather than into protocol sales or protocol launches. But people are starting to figure out that there is like latent demand for this and that people are frustrated with the dynamics that are in place where VC's buy tokens at pennies on the dollar and yeah, they're locked up for a year or whatever, then they get some liquidity. But the end result is the vast majority of token appreciation happens privately now versus publicly.
00:49:06.478 - 00:49:28.424, Speaker B: And it's, you know, if you think back a couple of years ago, like retail was making, I mean, one of the premises was that retail could make the money before the venture crowd got in. And now it's like, I mean, if you're doing, I think you might have tweeted this or someone else tweeted this. Like if you do, if you get into a seed round, especially if it's infrastructure, like you're printing a ten x.
00:49:32.164 - 00:49:51.980, Speaker A: It'S always positive ev, right? And it's funny, I've had a couple of debates with people about this. They thought that hot take was a bit off. And it's interesting though, the people that are trying to claim that it's much harder are all seed investors. So it's a little self serving to be like, oh, this is actually much.
00:49:52.012 - 00:50:10.042, Speaker B: Harder than another crowd. People who did a lot of angel deals but did them into c. Five companies who did, like, apps or centralized, whatever. No exit. Like, there is no, there's. I think Celkis tweeted this. There's like six companies in crypto that have ever exited.
00:50:10.042 - 00:50:13.082, Speaker B: And like, yeah, three were to FTX or something like that.
00:50:13.138 - 00:50:46.390, Speaker A: Like, yeah, exactly. So, yeah, exactly like that. You know, there's. There's the liquidity trade off, I think, in tokens changes the dynamic, which is why treating them like equity is a bad idea. Whatever structure you think needs to be in place to protect investors, it's different to equity structures. You can't just try and overlay it completely. I've joked about this.
00:50:46.390 - 00:51:07.394, Speaker A: You talk to a seed investor and they're like, no, you don't understand. I've done, like, you know, ten or 20 angel checks and only, like, three or four of them have been 50 x. And it's like, yeah, exactly 21. Like what? Like, I'm no mathematician, but, like, I think you're doing okay. Right? Like, they could all go to zero after that, and you're gonna be fine. Right. So, you know, it's.
00:51:07.394 - 00:51:39.042, Speaker A: It's just really positive ev to go into seed rounds. That said, it does change depending on the cycle, you know, as you get further into the cycle, seed rounds go from 20 to 30. You know, in the deep in the bear market, there were seed rounds that were going at 1520 mil val. Now it's popped up to 30, you know, whatever. But it'll, it'll get, I mean, element was probably the, the most crazy one last cycle, 320 mil seed round, you know, so, yeah.
00:51:39.178 - 00:51:43.786, Speaker B: Saw my 1st 50 million seed of the cycle. I was like, oh, we're, we're back.
00:51:43.850 - 00:51:50.282, Speaker A: There's a few floating around. There's a few. Yeah, yeah. It's a good, it's a good early bull market sign when seed rounds are getting inflated up.
00:51:50.378 - 00:52:06.334, Speaker B: I actually think one thing that could happen especially is, you know, this is, we're recording this on May 20, which is like this ETH, ETF day. The Bloomberg guys, I don't know if you've. Because you're in other time zone. I don't know if you've seen this yet, but the, the Bloomberg ETF guys, did you see this?
00:52:07.434 - 00:52:08.666, Speaker A: I haven't seen it yet, no.
00:52:08.730 - 00:52:56.464, Speaker B: Okay, so the Bloomberg ETF guys, Eric Balconis and James Seifert, I think is his last name flipped. They're basically the probability that from 25% to 70%, from 25 to 75, and then the SEC seems to be backing down on some stuff. I actually think one prediction that will probably come true is some brands, some companies or projects, whatever you want to call them, will get back to an ICO. Not an ICO style, but they will do seed round or series a or a series b, and they will launch a token that retail can buy at a similar price. I would assume they end up marking it up a smidge. So let's say they raise their series a 100, they'll probably sell it at 150 to retail. But even that is a much better model, I think.
00:52:56.464 - 00:52:58.004, Speaker B: And I think that'll come this year.
00:52:58.624 - 00:53:16.694, Speaker A: I think the challenge, right, the trade here is that back in the day, you know, like the Haven ICO, right? FDV at ICo was 60 mil fdb. Right? Now, at the bottom of the bear market, it got down to three mil. So it was dark times, right? But, you know, it's. It's sitting at.
00:53:17.634 - 00:53:18.562, Speaker B: That is nuts.
00:53:18.618 - 00:53:44.930, Speaker A: Yeah, it's pretty crazy, right? Yeah, yeah. 2 January 2019. I remember it very, very well. And, you know, after BTC fell off the cliff in late 2018, it just didn't recover, but then it started grinding up from there, right. You know, so I think it's. It's just below a billion. Sorry, FD now, right? So it's recovered significantly from where it was.
00:53:44.930 - 00:54:00.894, Speaker A: But even the icos that were doing 150 mil raises, right, they were crazy things like Puma pay. I remember in, like, early 2018, did 150 mil raise. That was for 75% of the tokens, right? So, you know, the FDV was float was plus.
00:54:01.474 - 00:54:03.418, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, the float was there, you.
00:54:03.426 - 00:54:26.480, Speaker A: Know, and, yeah, it got crushed and disappeared and whatever, right? Who knows what happened to that hundred? I mean, by the time they abandoned shipped there, that 150 ETH was probably down to 20 million. So it's probably gold, right? You think about, you know, you raise 150 million, you start spending ten mil a month, it goes from 1000 to 80. And then, you know, you look around at the bottom and you're like, how do we have $50 left? What happened?
00:54:26.512 - 00:54:27.084, Speaker B: Right?
00:54:27.464 - 00:55:08.180, Speaker A: And so, you know, all of that is to say that, like, the. Even in 2017, 2018, as excited as everyone was, the level of awareness that crypto had back then was tiny compared to where we are now. And so the fbvs of these icos, even. I mean, eos is different story. But if you look at, like, most of the normal icos that were a single ICO, the fdv was like sub 300, right? And most of them were like 30, you know, 2030, 40, 50 fdv. And so today, though, if you were to try to do that. I don't think there's enough room for all of the demand, right.
00:55:08.180 - 00:55:43.794, Speaker A: If you try to do a 30 mil FDB ICO for a credible project, it wouldn't work, right. So you need to ratchet it up and say, okay, we're selling half the tokens. So you know, there's just a different structure. Unfortunately that's required. I don't think you get away with selling half the tokens at 30 mil. Obviously you avoid the low float stuff and the low float stuff is directly the result of only being able to give away tokens. If all the tokens you sell are locked and all the tokens you give away are unlocked, then if you only give away 10% of the tokens, there you go.
00:55:43.794 - 00:55:50.086, Speaker A: If you even lock up some of the ones you gave away, then it's even worse. You got a 3% float or something like that.
00:55:50.190 - 00:56:32.166, Speaker B: Well what's the solution here? Because like founders who don't have 25 million to put into their next company, I think the second time Defi founders or second time infra, whatever you want to call it, like second and third time crypto founders can do it right. Like they know the game and they can do it right and they probably have enough capital to do it right. But what doing it right looks like as a first time founder is you're basically saying I'm taking regulatory risk and I'm putting my middle finger up to all these vc's who on paper are about to make me go from a, you know, I was working at Facebook as a PM and now I'm about to have 250 million on paper.
00:56:32.230 - 00:56:33.678, Speaker A: Paper? Yeah, on paper.
00:56:33.726 - 00:56:39.326, Speaker B: But I'm like, you know, now I'm worth 100 million when my friends are worth like I don't know, they're still grinding at Goldman or something.
00:56:39.430 - 00:57:21.954, Speaker A: So yeah, the thing is though, right, like the low float games feel good but it's actually so detrimental to alignment. And this is the thing where it's just layers upon layers upon layers of misalignment. So you have this low flow thing where it's like, oh hey, you know how you were early when we were selling tokens to VC's at 30 mil and you were sitting there in the discord grinding away helping us refine the product or whatever. Well how does ten bill FTB sound for you to buy the token? And it's just like, well that sounds terrible but I guess, Yolo. Whatever, I'm still bullish. And so you end up buying the token because you're like FTB is a meme. The market cap's really 100 mil.
00:57:21.954 - 00:57:51.264, Speaker A: It's going to be fine. And then unlock, unlock, unlock. Three years later, you're 80% down. You just kill the community, you kill the alignment. The whole point of tokens, the entire point of tokens is alignment with the community. If you break the alignment, and not just break it, but break it in multiple compounding ways, it's worse than having no token. You might as well just be an equity project and never launch a token and never have that alignment.
00:57:51.264 - 00:57:54.268, Speaker A: It's Diabol.
00:57:54.356 - 00:58:02.184, Speaker B: So if you are a first time founder, would you raise it? Let's say I have term sheet for 100 million and a term sheet for a billion. What are you doing?
00:58:02.724 - 00:58:28.414, Speaker A: Here's the thing. As a first time founder, you have far less leverage than it even looks like you do on paper. As a first time founder, you have to follow the meta. Investors are looking for a reason to disqualify you. They're seeing tons of different seed rounds. So if you go out and you say, hey, everyone's doing a 30 mil seed round, that's the median. And the range is ten to 50 or something like that.
00:58:28.414 - 00:58:49.726, Speaker A: Percent confidence interval, whatever. So you go, okay, so I'm going to nail it. I'm going to hit the median, I'm going to do a 30 mil raise, right? I'm going to do 10% of the supply in the seed brand. I'm going to do this, I'm going to do a 15% airdrop. And you literally go and just copy pasta the entire meta, right?
00:58:49.750 - 00:58:52.094, Speaker B: You do the points, you do some restaking.
00:58:52.254 - 00:59:39.958, Speaker A: We're doing everything. We're literally, I've got one through ten, I'm doing it right, and you don't deviate at all. What do you get from that? What you get is horribly misaligned incentives at the end of it with your community, but you actually raise the money because at no point in that ten point list did you get disqualified. Whereas if on, .3 you're like, well, actually, we're not going to do points, we're going to do an LBP, right? And most investors just go, move on to the next one. So it's like, so unless you have some leverage in the market, you're just going to disqualify yourself. Now, how can you get leverage? You can have prior credibility from like a prior startup or something.
00:59:39.958 - 01:00:11.384, Speaker A: You know, as you say, second time founder, but it doesn't have to be crypto founder. You could have come from something. You could have like a really deep network, your ex coinbase. And, you know, like, people know you and they know you're credible, whatever. So, like, you can get more leverage. But even the people with the most leverage, the only way that you can really break the meta is have your own money. If you have your own money, you can be like, well, I'm doing my own meta because I've got my own money and I don't really care what you think, right? And then the irony of that is then people go, wait, wait, you got your own money? Like, take my money.
01:00:11.384 - 01:00:27.228, Speaker A: Like, come on. Like, I want to play too, right? Like, and so you can break the meta. So someone has to break the meta, right? And we've seen this already. Like, you know Robert Leshner, right? He broke the meta. He's like, actually, I'm not going to do, I'm going to do this other thing. I'm doing Rwas. I'm going to have this whole structure.
01:00:27.228 - 01:01:14.618, Speaker A: And like, he's like, I saw that last meta and it didn't work for what I want to do. I'm doing new meta and I'm bringing my own money and I'm doing my own thing. And you can come with me if you want, but, like, I don't care, right? And that's very powerful because, you know, people are like, okay, well, if you don't care about me, then I definitely want to be in, right? And so, so it's like, you know, once, but once the meta is broken, once you've actually done it, then you've got this situation where it's like, okay, you've broken the meta, and now other people can follow that meta because that's a new playbook, right? So someone has to break the meta for other people to be able to say, well, I'm just doing what Robert did with Superstay, right? Or I'm just doing what racer did with friend tech. I'm going to airdrop everything, right? Like, once the metas out there, then you can kind of do it, especially if it's been successful.
01:01:14.706 - 01:01:18.138, Speaker B: That's why I was happy to see you doing nfts. I still love NFT.
01:01:18.266 - 01:01:21.794, Speaker A: I love, me too. Me too. I think nfts are bullish.
01:01:21.914 - 01:01:36.202, Speaker B: And maybe, I mean, tell us how you're breaking the meta. You've got, like, my understanding is you got, you deposit the USDC into the Infinix wallet. You get, you, you can stake that and you can earn points, I think, governance points or GPS or something.
01:01:36.298 - 01:01:38.346, Speaker A: Yeah, governance points. Yeah.
01:01:38.490 - 01:01:40.746, Speaker B: And then you're running this 30 day campaign right now.
01:01:40.810 - 01:01:40.986, Speaker A: What.
01:01:41.010 - 01:01:42.204, Speaker B: What's the name of it?
01:01:42.904 - 01:02:18.766, Speaker A: So speedrun the waitlist. So we've got this big waitlist, right? And we're like, these people are mainly bots. How do we find the real people? If we just start letting random people off the waitlist, they might not be real. Right. So we need a way to sort of figure out who's real, who's actually aligned, who's doing the thing. And so you earn governance points. And now that we've got a list, a ranked list of 3000 people, where if we were to enable Athena today, for example, right, then we would say, okay, Athena's enabled the top hundred people get access to it, and then the next day, the next thousand, and then the next day, the next thousand.
01:02:18.766 - 01:02:25.694, Speaker A: And so it's a way for us to do like a stage rollout of new functionality so we can test it without just throwing it to everyone.
01:02:25.814 - 01:02:36.710, Speaker B: And you've got a set number of these points, right, that you're giving. It's like 400 million or something, or 307 million, I think, is the number. And their set number points. And those points are.
01:02:36.742 - 01:02:38.978, Speaker A: They convert to the deposit. Exactly.
01:02:39.126 - 01:02:39.538, Speaker B: Okay.
01:02:39.586 - 01:02:47.082, Speaker A: That's right. Yeah. And so, yeah, it's not like, hey, we're doing points and then, like, next week we're gonna do more points. I'm gonna inflate you into infinity, right?
01:02:47.138 - 01:02:48.174, Speaker B: Yeah, I think so.
01:02:48.674 - 01:03:05.426, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, the everyone strategy, right? Like, it's like, we've got points, people want points. What if we just keep giving them more points and they'll keep doing stuff for us, right? Like, it's hard to wean yourself off that, right? If you're like, way more narrative starting.
01:03:05.450 - 01:03:21.684, Speaker B: To turn after Eigen Lair, like what you said, like, you not. It actually works in the inverse, too. You need someone to break the mold and do something, right? But you also need one of the loved people to do something and piss people off. It's like, I think people are seeing that on Twitter saying, oh, like Eigen lair can do something wrong.
01:03:22.304 - 01:03:23.048, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:03:23.216 - 01:03:23.688, Speaker B: So.
01:03:23.776 - 01:03:51.364, Speaker A: And, you know, on some level, right, it was like this false promise, right, of like, we're going to do this thing, right? We're going to. We're going to have this great scheme to give you alignment, right? And then it turns out to be bullshit. And people like, you rubbed me like, I thought we were aligned. You did the thing, you got everything that you wanted. You got the metrics, you were able to do the raises, you got the high fdv. And now I get nothing. That's not a good trade.
01:03:51.364 - 01:04:22.334, Speaker A: And this is the downside to the points matter. Back in the day, you used to say, well, we have 100 million tokens, and we're going to give you 10 million of those tokens to do x, y, z, right? And if you do it, you get them, and that's it. Right? Like, it's very clear. But then, you know, as soon as points were invented, it was like, well, we can just give you infinite points. And the conversion ratio, you don't know what it is. And then by the time you work out what it is, we've already got everything we want, and we're off into the sunset.
01:04:23.074 - 01:04:30.054, Speaker B: So I keep interrupting you. Tell me about the points, tokens to nfts. Tell me about this whole flow.
01:04:30.984 - 01:04:51.456, Speaker A: We have this governance process, and we've got points. And so we had a proposal of distributing some points. There's a fixed number of points, and so we're going to distribute some points to different people in the ecosystem. And then the community was like, no, don't distribute to them. Distribute to the. And it started this war of like, who's. Where are the points going to go? And there were like five or six different counter proposals.
01:04:51.456 - 01:05:12.134, Speaker A: Right? So, you know, this is a well known governance problem, right? If you. If you open things up to decentralized governance, then, yeah, you have a situation where there's crazy stuff can happen. So this is still a thing that's being discovered in real time, like what people's sensitivity is to it, what people's issue is. Yeah.
01:05:13.914 - 01:05:38.844, Speaker B: I have a question that probably most of the listeners won't find that interesting, but I'm just curious, as a founder, how are you? What are the lessons that you learned from running synthetix and just other companies, the non crypto companies, too? How do you run this company? Do you have. Are you a meetings guy? Not a meetings guy. Do you hire a big leadership team right now? Because you're like, fuck, this is my fifth company, and I can't be. How do you run this company? What are some of the lessons learned?
01:05:39.344 - 01:06:13.596, Speaker A: I'll give you just one lesson, literally the one most important lesson, which, in spite of 20 years doing startups, I didn't learn when I started Infinix, which is to build something simple and iterate. There's a, you know, there's a tendency, I think, in everyone, right, to want to build the perfect thing, right. I want this thing to solve all of the problems at every edge case. And, like, it has to do all of the things, right. Now, most of the time, you have constraints, and you can't do that. You have trade offs. You're like, well, we can't solve x and y.
01:06:13.596 - 01:06:44.094, Speaker A: We have to, you know, pick one because we've only got $100. Right? And it's going to cost $100 to do each of them, and so we've got to choose one. Right. The challenge, I guess, as a 8th time founder, especially one who's had some success, is I felt like maybe I didn't have to have trade offs this time, and maybe we could try to do everything. And so what we ended up doing, and this was a problem that ICos also fell into back in the day. They would raise 30, 40, $50 million, and they were like, we have infinite money. We can do infinite things.
01:06:44.094 - 01:07:03.402, Speaker A: They would lock themselves in a room for, like, three years, and they would come out and be like, look what we built. This beautiful palace in the sky. And people would be like, this is absolute nonsense. Garbage. This doesn't. This is not what we wanted. Like, you guys have been locked in a room for three years.
01:07:03.402 - 01:07:25.002, Speaker A: The world's moved on. You're building something that's like a. For a different era. Like, whatever, right? And, like, there's many examples of this. Auger is a great example, right? Like, just going off into the wilderness for, like, two years and coming back and being like, look what we built. And everyone's like, guys, like. And it just never got used, right? And it's the problem of, like, not building a thing and testing it.
01:07:25.002 - 01:07:56.032, Speaker A: Like, empirical evidence is the most valuable thing that you could have in the world, right? All of the theories, all of the models, all of the kind of systems you can build to try and understand something, nothing is as powerful as empirical evidence. And so if you go and build a thing and say, do you like this? And everyone says no, you go, hmm, okay, interesting. If you go and build something, and then you keep building and building and building and extending and extending, extending, and you come back and you say, do you like this? And they say, no, you've wasted two years of your life.
01:07:56.128 - 01:07:56.456, Speaker B: Right?
01:07:56.520 - 01:08:27.776, Speaker A: It's crazy. We started with this idea of, like, trying to build everything, and we actually tied ourselves up into knots where, like, the thing didn't work. The security model was, like, way too convoluted. No one understood it, which is super dangerous when it comes to security. Like, you want something that's simple, right? And so what we've done over time is to pare back a lot of the stuff that we built and actually simplify it. And we've now got a security model that is much more simple. And so we've built something that, you know, right now, the platform is the feature.
01:08:27.776 - 01:08:46.854, Speaker A: It doesn't do anything. It just is an account that you can deposit funds into. And that is very simple. And yet we've gotten great feedback from, this is an easy thing that I can deposit money into. Right. If we were trying to do ten different things and 80 different features, it would obscure the signal. You wouldn't even know, like, does the core thing work? And now we know.
01:08:46.854 - 01:08:49.194, Speaker A: We're very confident that the core thing works.
01:08:52.294 - 01:09:40.066, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, that's, that's really good. Yeah, I, so when we launched blockworks research two years ago, and the idea was like, you have all these tabs open. You've got, like, Masari and token terminal and Artemis and, like, all these, all these platforms and coingecko and Defi llama and all these platforms, too many platforms. Bring it all into one place. And if you can just bring all that information into one place, it makes it easier for the user. And that what you don't realize on that thesis is like, you're trying to go build an average of all those ten products, essentially, and the better product strategy to do that took us, that we had to learn the hard way was like, you have to do one thing better than all of those people.
01:09:40.250 - 01:09:41.210, Speaker A: Exactly.
01:09:41.362 - 01:09:42.642, Speaker B: And then get the users in that.
01:09:42.658 - 01:10:20.354, Speaker A: Way and frame model of, like, you know, just try and do everything and hopefully that will work. And it's like, no, like, you haven't solved a problem for anyone, right? You're a worse version of everything, right. And that's, you know, again, it's a very first time founder problem, right, of, like, the first time you build something, you know, your intuition is wrong. Right. Like, as a person, as to, like, what, you know, very few people get that intuition, right. You know, obviously there's places like y combinator and stuff where they, like, beat that out of you and like, say, like, simplify, simplify, simplify until you're finally like, okay, fine, we'll simplify. Right.
01:10:20.354 - 01:10:35.592, Speaker A: But the tendency is, no, I want to build a perfect thing. I'm so excited. Like, don't. You know what? This could be, right? But building a, you don't build a complex system in a vacuum. You build a complex system out of small parts.
01:10:35.768 - 01:10:39.952, Speaker B: Yeah. And talking to customers as much as humanly possible. So what exactly.
01:10:40.088 - 01:10:40.376, Speaker A: Okay.
01:10:40.400 - 01:10:57.704, Speaker B: Now that you've built, like, centralized companies with just equity and then crypto companies with tokens, would you ever build a company without tokens. Again, thinking about it simply from the perspective, not from the community alignment perspective, but the liquidity. Founder liquidity perspective.
01:10:58.564 - 01:11:21.514, Speaker A: From. From a founder liquidity perspective. Like, still no. Right? Like, I think that tokens, especially in crypto, if I was to go and build a tradfi business, I don't know why I would want to do that, but no, I wouldn't tokenize it. It doesn't make sense. Right. But, you know, certainly within crypto, you cannot compete in the market without a token.
01:11:21.514 - 01:11:36.434, Speaker A: It's just impossible. Right? So if you're building something that is designed for institutional people, fine, maybe you can get away with it. But the alignment that your competitors will have, even if it is aimed at institutions, is just far larger.
01:11:38.374 - 01:11:41.714, Speaker B: Yeah, it's interesting. Cayman, anything else? It's a great chat.
01:11:42.454 - 01:11:57.916, Speaker A: No, all good. It's always good to chat. Hopefully you guys can chop this up into something that's workable. I'm sorry about all the interruptions. New office. I've learned. I've learned a good lesson about not sitting in a glass box in the middle of 30 people.
01:11:58.020 - 01:12:09.636, Speaker B: Yeah, right? You guys should go play around. I onboarded onto Infinix. That's Infinix. I n f I n e x. Xyz. Yeah. There's a sign up button.
01:12:09.636 - 01:12:26.830, Speaker B: It's really cool. I would say this, and there's. Kinto are, like, the two best onboarding experiences that I've experienced. And it's like, it's not even a. Hey. I feel like we're moving from, like, one year to the next. It's like, a ten x improvement over, like, any other application, so it's.
01:12:26.830 - 01:12:28.514, Speaker B: Yeah, it's cool. Congrats, man.
01:12:28.814 - 01:12:35.214, Speaker A: Thank you very much. Yeah, it's been. It's been a slog to get here, but we're excited now. Exactly.
01:12:35.334 - 01:12:35.814, Speaker B: You're welcome.
01:12:35.854 - 01:12:37.294, Speaker A: Thank you, sir. All right, talk soon.
