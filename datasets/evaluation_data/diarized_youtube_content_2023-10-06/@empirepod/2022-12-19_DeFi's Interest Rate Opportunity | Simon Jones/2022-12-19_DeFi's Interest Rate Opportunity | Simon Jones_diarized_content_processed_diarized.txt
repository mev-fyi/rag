00:00:00.280 - 00:00:20.566, Speaker A: Is London Clearinghouse. It's an entity in London. It's responsible for about 90% of the world's interest rate swap clearing. They have to employ thousands of people to maintain that exchange. Right. And it still is extremely opaque, and it's regulated the hell out of in order to make sure that it kind of works as it should do for society. But why does that need to exist? I don't think it does.
00:00:20.566 - 00:00:23.554, Speaker A: I think the entire thing can be replaced with smart contracts.
00:00:25.134 - 00:00:39.824, Speaker B: All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Empire. We are joined today not by Santi, but my name. My is trusted co founder, Mister Mike Ippolito. And we are very lucky to be joined by Simon Jones. Simon Jones, CEO and co founder of Volts Protocol. Simon, welcome to the show, man.
00:00:39.984 - 00:00:41.960, Speaker A: Hey, nice to be here. Yeah, yeah.
00:00:41.992 - 00:01:31.134, Speaker B: Great to have you here. So, for folks who don't know volts, Volts is an amm for interest rate swaps. We had Simon on another blockworks podcast called Bell Curve. Really highly listened to and just enjoyed episode talking about, like, interest rate swaps episode. What Simon is building at volts is kind of sitting at the intersection of, really, how do we build this, like, large and transformative fixed income ecosystem in DeFi? And we want to bring Simon back on the podcast because Volts just published this really interesting research paper exploring the relationship between tradfi rates and Defi rates, which is a really interesting topic that Mike and I talk about and Santi and I talk about all the time. Right. If you were to think about the bull market, a lot of folks got pulled into DeFi because these super high rates, there's the meme.
00:01:31.134 - 00:02:05.404, Speaker B: What interest rate do you get in your bank account? And it was like, 0.001%. And then on AAVE, you can get 10% or something. That meme has kind of gone away, as rates are actually lower in DeFi now than they are in tradfi on the lending side. So, anyways, we just want to bring Simon on to explore that paper and explore, really, this idea of how do you build this colossal, uh, fixed income ecosystem in. In Defi? So, Simon, I think my first question for you is, can you just explain, like, the why behind. Why you guys put in so much work on this paper and what really, what you were looking to get out of it?
00:02:05.944 - 00:03:15.142, Speaker A: Yeah. So, I mean, I guess it's pretty helpful just to take a massive step back. Like, why. Why does Vault's labs as a team even exist? And I guess, at the most macro level, kind of what we really hold as our North Star is that we want to try and help DeFi become the financial system for the whole of the world. And frankly, in doing so, completely changed the way in which society works all around the world, and ultimately changed the lives of billions of people, which, holding that as our North Star, like twelve months ago, we spotted a very clear problem that needs to be solved, which is actually something which I think we talked about in previous podcasts around the fact that the ecosystem, like the byproduct of the technology, is that it only produces variable rates of return. And not only were those rates of return variable, they're also at times extremely volatile, which, if we want DeFi to become adopted by the whole world, clearly that's a problem that needed to be solved. And the solution to that really is kind of an interest rate swap market, which for anyone that's not familiar with it, it kind of sounds small.
00:03:15.142 - 00:04:27.124, Speaker A: And then you look at traditional finance, and it's the biggest market in the whole of traditional finance. In fact, it's cartoonishly large. There's a quadrillion of notional traded each year in tradfi interest rate swaps, because it is such an important part of a financial system. And from our perspective, we launched the protocol, or the community actually deployed the protocol, 1 June this year, and trading volume on the protocol has been growing about 25% week on week. So there's clearly need for this type of instrument in DeFi, which is pretty exciting, but clearly, as a team who are spending all our time looking at rates, one of the other things which Jason, you just touched on, which is so stark, really, is that twelve months ago, interest rates in DeFi used to be high yield, high cost of borrowing. In tradfi, it was the reverse, it was low yield, but also low cost of borrowing, to the point that actually in Europe, you had negative rates, so you got paid to borrow, which is insane. Then if we fast forward twelve months, it's completely the opposite.
00:04:27.124 - 00:05:11.068, Speaker A: Where Defi yields have come down, Defi borrowing costs have come down, but tradfi rates have gone up. Both cost of borrowing, but also now the yield you get in your bank account is actually better than you can get in Defi. So we found that just kind of theoretically interesting, and we kind of wanted to understand why. Like, why is there this behavior where these two different rate markets behave in such a different way? And that's basically the purpose of the analysis, is we're exploring that. We're exploring the relationship between the two. But then actually, more importantly, in the second part of the report, we started going into. Yes, okay, Defi yield has come down, but that also means that the cost of borrowing has come down.
00:05:11.068 - 00:05:27.344, Speaker A: And what does that mean from an opportunity perspective for Defi, rather than viewing this as some sort of negative? Because like you said, the yield, we used to have this meme where the yield in Defi was so much better than the yield in tradfi. Obviously that's changed, but what are the opportunities that come off the back of it?
00:05:28.564 - 00:05:44.134, Speaker C: Can we start with the, like, there's a lot to unpack there. Can we start with maybe like the very tip of the iceberg, so to speak, and can you tell us what you sort of found when you were trying to suss out what is the relationship in between these two different rate regimes, like the tradfi rate regime versus what's going on in crypto?
00:05:44.634 - 00:06:20.306, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think there's kind of two major points that really came out of the analysis. I think the first, which is kind of somewhat obvious, but actually only feels so obvious once you've done the work, is that the two different rate regimes are anti correlated. So as one goes up, the other goes down, and you kind of feel that the anti correct, you kind of sense it. All you've got to do is look at the yields in d five or stratify, and you can tell that's the case. But actually, when we did the analysis, we didn't expect the relationship to be as strong as it was. So as a first point, we found that pretty interesting.
00:06:20.306 - 00:07:10.214, Speaker A: But then the second point, which I think is by far the more interesting point out of those two, is when we're exploring why is it anticorrelated. Our initial thought was that as tradfi rates went up, that would bring DeFi rates down. But actually defi rates come down before tradfi rates even start moving. So before the central bank start putting the rates up, the DeFi rates are coming down. So we started trying to explore what we thought the driver of that was. And the hypothesis that we have, which we explore in the report, is that it's inflation. This is where the second point gets really interesting, because we then started looking at the time lag between inflation data being announced versus rates moving.
00:07:10.214 - 00:08:36.474, Speaker A: And in DeFi, the rates came down on average twelve days after inflation data was announced, whereas in tradfi, the central banks changed their rates around 100 days after the inflation data was announced. So it took them almost three months. The reason I find this so interesting is obviously we all recognize the benefits of DeFi in terms of building a global financial system in terms of removing intermediaries and inefficiencies and all this type of stuff, which is extremely important. But actually what we've seen in this analysis is, is also as a mechanism, programmatic, market driven protocols are a lot more efficient at converting market data and changes in market data into those markets than centralized entities that are run by human beings. And actually the difference there is almost ten x twelve days versus 100 days. So if you think about, if you really zoom out, I think pretty much every central bank around the world is criticized for how slow they responded to changes in inflation. And if they had responded faster, who knows where all the economies in the world would be right now? We might not even be in recession.
00:08:36.474 - 00:09:37.410, Speaker A: And if you go into that even further, central banks, has anything actually changed at a central bank for the past like 50 years? Have they ever changed the way in which they make their decisions? I'm not sure that they have. And I'm not necessarily saying a central bank is going to be displaced by a decentralized protocol, at least in the short term. I don't think a central bank is going to give up monetary policy, control over monetary policy, but at least we now have really clear data that shows kind of centralized entities using humans as those decision makers are kind of way slower than market driven protocols. And what could that mean if we were to adopt this type of mechanism for that type of decision making process? Could it mean that actually that data was absorbed a lot quicker, such that the rate regime changed faster and potentially maybe global economy wouldn't even be in recession?
00:09:37.602 - 00:09:54.654, Speaker B: Simon, I have a kind of 101 level markets question here for you. So you were talking about how the central bank, in traditional capital markets, the central bank changes the interest rate and it took them 100 days, and in defi it only took twelve days. This is my 101 level question. What changes the interest rates in Defi.
00:09:56.434 - 00:10:49.078, Speaker A: Market forces? And specifically what we were looking at is we're looking at borrowing costs on stable coins, on ave and compound. So as people stop borrowing more. So basically your borrowing costs are driven off the utilization of the pool. So if there's loads of supply and loads of borrowing, if that's ultimately only 10% of the total supply, the cost for everybody who's borrowing is going to be low. But if you end up kind of close to 100%, which actually we saw in the build up to the merge, those boring costs are going to shoot up massively based on the kind of interest rate model that exists on avian compound. So it's ultimately like the utilization is basically representative of supply and demand dynamics. So if the supply and demand changes, then the cost of borrowing is going to change.
00:10:49.078 - 00:10:51.474, Speaker A: And that's what we saw kind of in that data.
00:10:53.814 - 00:11:27.674, Speaker C: I'd be curious, Simon, how do you, let's go back to this negative correlation that you found, and I sort of understand it at a high level, that the fallibility of how interest rates are set in traditional markets, at least at the short end of the curve, is it's all based on central banks, which is just small collections of people that are very opaque and don't have very much accountability. Can you walk me through what is the transmission mechanism here? How actually, did DeFi respond more quickly to changes in inflation than the central banks were able to do?
00:11:30.214 - 00:12:19.494, Speaker A: So? Well, it's not, I mean, ultimately, it's not clear entirely what the relationship between inflation going up and DeFi rates going down is. So you can only build hypotheses, right? And I guess there's one, perhaps, which is that there's a lot of retail activity in DeFi. As inflation actually started going up, people had less disposable income. There was less capital, therefore, to come into the ecosystem. So therefore there's less, perhaps supply, there's less demand for borrowing. That all starts to suppress a lot faster than in a non market driven environment. That, I guess, is one hypothesis with a central bank.
00:12:19.494 - 00:12:59.894, Speaker A: The way that that works is they collect loads of data. Do you know what? Honestly, there's a part of me that doesn't even know because it's so fake as well. But they collect a load of data with regular cadence. They have monetary policy committees where they discuss that data and they make a decision on what the base rate should be. And the time lag from inflation changing versus those decisions being made is way longer versus obviously what we observed in DeFi, where you immediately start seeing the market forces play out in the data of the ecosystem.
00:13:00.234 - 00:13:06.094, Speaker B: Why does this matter? Simon, why does it matter that it takes ten times longer to change interest rates?
00:13:07.314 - 00:13:45.746, Speaker A: Well, I think it's the economy. Ultimately, if you can really zoom out, imagine if central banks had responded ten times faster. Honestly, there's a reasonable argument to say that the global economy wouldn't be in recession. And what does that mean? It means that we got technology improves over time. And I kind of find it. I mean, obviously the opportunity of DeFi is transformational, but there's also an opportunity for some of these old legacy structures. If they don't get displaced, then they can evolve, too.
00:13:45.746 - 00:13:57.454, Speaker A: So why did they not look at more efficient ways of making these decisions and adopting technology, because I don't think a central bank has changed for the past 50 years.
00:13:59.434 - 00:14:00.082, Speaker B: The way that I.
00:14:00.098 - 00:15:03.422, Speaker C: Was thinking about this. Simon, I'd love to get your thoughts here before I read the paper that you guys published, was the reason why there might be this sort of anti correlation is if crypto is in like, one way to think about monetary policy in economic cycles, the way you'd read in your textbook, right, which is the Fed raises interest rates, and that impacts the cost of borrowing, and then fewer projects get funded, and then that slows growth that way. But you could sort of make an argument. This weird, like, keynesian economic experiment that we're running here, largely the way actually monetary policy gets transmitted, is when you raise interest rates, it has an impact on the price of financial assets, and financial assets go up or down based on interest rate sensitivity. And then that actually ends up dictating economic policies, this weird backwards way of transmitting monetary policy. And that was kind of how I was thinking about what happened in crypto, right? We raised interest rates, or even before we raised interest rates, the Fed signaled that they were going to raise interest rates. Their forward guidance, which is kind of more important than the actual raising of the interest rates.
00:15:03.422 - 00:15:39.834, Speaker C: The market believed them. And then one by one, we've seen risk assets collapse, and crypto is kind of at the very tip of the frontier of risk assets. And as crypto prices collapsed, then all of these opportunities for generating yields, that there was the basis trade, which is collapsing, that spread in between forwards and spot, or futures and spot. Then there was the grayscale arbitrage, which is now pretty infamously exploded in the wrong direction. So that was the way I was kind of thinking about it. Does that kind of fit into your theory? Maybe you don't think that's the way that the transmission would actually occur?
00:15:40.574 - 00:16:30.754, Speaker A: I think so, but I think that what we saw is that DeFi responded faster than that. I mean, that's kind of what we expected to see. We expected to see chadfire rates go up, or at least expectations of traffic go up and then DeFi rates to come down off the back of it. But actually, the hypothesis is that inflation was the cause, and that actually, as inflation started to change, people stopped spending money on crypto assets. So the prices got suppressed a lot quicker than the Fed even had begun to react in terms of expectation setting. And that meant that the rate regime came down. So the whole ecosystem actually responded around ten times faster than the Fed.
00:16:30.754 - 00:17:06.932, Speaker A: And I think that was the most interesting, because before we did the analysis, I completely agree with you. That's exactly the way in which we expected it to play out. The fed raises rates or expectations of a rate rise change, and then at the most macro level, that has an impact on the proportion of capital that's being allocated to higher risk assets, of which crypto is one, and therefore DeFi gets affected. But that's not what happened. We think it was inflation. First defi came down and then the fed reacted.
00:17:07.108 - 00:17:32.096, Speaker C: Raoul, so walk us through what the implications of this are. If you look at the, a little while ago, there was basically no concept of risk free rate in tradfi, right. They brought fed funds down to 0% during March of 2020. Now, that's not the case. Right. And the terminal rate is over 5% as of this week's FOMC. And even like the two years, I don't know, off the top of my head, but around 3.5
00:17:32.096 - 00:17:47.924, Speaker C: or so percent. So. And at the same time, you're seeing almost like negative, those negative borrowing costs that we were talking about with european side sovereign debt we're now seeing in crypto. So what are kind of the implications of switching that dynamic on its head?
00:17:48.264 - 00:18:51.234, Speaker A: Yeah. And this is kind of what we started to explore just as more of a thought process more than anything in the second part of the report, because I think clearly as Defi yields has come down, there's been a lot of Defi projects that have been kind of destroyed as a result, that the business model, kind of form of a phrase, was designed around, like, the fact that yield is higher in Defi than it was in traditional finance. So I guess there's some bearish sentiment around the fact that that flipped. And actually what we wanted to kind of talk about in the report is, well, like flip that on its head. What's the opportunity, right. Instead of being bearish, what's the opportunity now that these have changed? And one of the things that we think at least exists in the short term is the opportunity to use defi as a low cost of borrowing or source of low cost of borrowing, which can obviously exist across various different kind of products. The one which we talk about just because I think it's arguably the most interesting is fixed rate mortgages.
00:18:51.234 - 00:20:05.992, Speaker A: And the reason that we bring this up in the report is there's something really interesting that happened a couple of months ago where somebody bought an NFT on Opensea, where the NFT represented ownership over a physical house. So they effectively bought a property by buying the NFT. And why I find that so interesting is that I haven't got into all the details of the legal structure that exists around it, but what we have in principle facilitated is we have facilitated the purchase of a property on chain. So the next step is to finance the purchase of the property on chain. And what we kind of lay out, again, it's just thought provoking more than anything, is like, what are the steps to enable that? Well, if the NFT represents the physical property, then the NFT clearly has intrinsic value. So if you can use that as collateral on a money market protocol such as Aave, for example, then in theory you could borrow against it. And if you were to do that, then effectively you have financed the purchase of the property on chain.
00:20:05.992 - 00:20:54.464, Speaker A: Is someone going to do that at a variable rate? I don't know. I think that's pretty risky because you don't want to get liquidated on your house purchase. Clearly what we talk about within it is you'd want to compose that with an interest rate swap. So you're borrowing a fixed rate, at which point you effectively have fixed rate mortgages on chain, which is pretty cool. Why is that so exciting? Well, with the difference in the rate regimes, you could borrow at a fixed rate of 2% versus borrowing a fixed rate of, say, 6% in traditional finance at the moment. So you're getting a three x improvement on your cost of borrowing by doing it through defi versus doing it through treadfi. I'm not saying it's about to happen, honestly, I think it's possible for it to happen, but if it's ever going to happen, it's going to happen now.
00:20:54.464 - 00:20:56.684, Speaker A: And I think it's pretty exciting as a thought process.
00:20:59.064 - 00:21:51.714, Speaker C: Can we talk about the inverse of that as an opportunity as well, and the opportunity for DeFi protocols to import yields from Tradfi? We were talking about this a little bit on. You just mentioned that most DeFi protocols had built their business model around having higher yields in crypto. Jason, we covered this quite a bit, but we also talked about it a lot off air. We watched maker basically divert some of the USDC in their peg stability mechanism into Coinbase and start earning some of the yield that center, which is the consortium between Coinbase and circle, were earning. Suddenly that's a non trivial stream of income that maker is generating for itself, and they're just taking some of the assets that they have, dollar assets, USDC, and earning some of the yield that's in tradfi, and it's a pretty significant stream of income. So what opportunity if any, do you see sort of in reversing the business model?
00:21:53.374 - 00:23:23.864, Speaker A: Yeah, I think there's definitely opportunity there. I think one of the things that we talked about is if you were to have tradfi rate markets like sofa rate markets or Sonia rate markets, if anyone's not familiar with Sonia, you've probably potentially heard of Libor markets. That kind of, Sonia is replacing libel. If you were to have them accessible in the same exchange as DeFi rate markets, then actually in the short term, what that opens up is it opens up a huge amount of arbitrage opportunity based on the fact that those rate regimes exhibit anti correlating behavior. So for anybody that sits across both DeFi and Tradfi every time, say, the Tradfi regime moved out of whack with the one in the defi based Tradfi regime moved out of whack with the one in traditional finance, you could basically just add that away. And that what we discussed in the research is the idea that that as a kind of catalyst could enable more sophisticated actors to start coming into DeFi, because there is this arb opportunity that essentially acts as like a carrot on a stick to get people to start coming in. And then off the back of that, that will enable kind of more sophisticated kind of fixed income markets to essentially be bootstrapped in DeFi where they're taking advantage of all the underlying benefits of the infrastructure relative to these traditional financial markets.
00:23:26.364 - 00:23:59.664, Speaker C: Let's talk about a little bit about like that. Let's kind of transition here into the second half of your report and talk about like, what are some of the other opportunities that this creates? When I just sit there and close my eyes and think about these two, which I knew beforehand, but the way you spelled that out was really helpful for me, which is there are these two different financial systems with different rate regimes. Eventually there's going to be some opportunity in getting those regimes to talk to one another. Can you describe a little bit about what this opportunity represents?
00:24:00.514 - 00:25:18.214, Speaker A: Yeah, so, and I think the catalyst there is getting like sofa. So say if you've got sofa rate markets on chain such that they're accessible within the same trading venue, then as a trading firm, you start to be able to start taking advantage of the fact that there are kind of differences in behavior in the way in which these two regimes behave. So the most kind of macro level, there's obviously an ARB opportunity and a relatively simple carry trade for anybody that kind of knows what they're doing. A further end of that kind of spectrum, there's opportunity for people to take advantage of the fact that there is a lag, or an observed lag in the way in which central banks react versus the way in which the Defi markets react. But off the back of bringing in these more sophisticated institutions, I think there's opportunity to start creating essentially more sophisticated products, like structured products, ultimately long term interest rate swap caps, flaws, nonlinear derivatives, like swaptions, stuff that exists in traditional finance that doesn't yet exist in defi. But by having those two regimes in the same place, it essentially enables you to bootstrap that market.
00:25:20.214 - 00:25:29.194, Speaker B: Simon, how do you import this? Might be a really dumb question, but yeah. Like, how do you import the ten year yield into, like, to be on chain?
00:25:29.614 - 00:26:04.708, Speaker A: Just an oracle? Yeah. I mean, at least, yeah. In the short term, I don't think there's any other way of doing it. It's just an oracle, but it's. It depends what you're trying to do. If you're trying to create a synthetic like derivative market, as long as you've got the oracle feed coming in of the overnight rate, then in theory you can create a market on that vault, at which point you'd have a three month .6 month point, whatever different maturities exist within that ecosystem.
00:26:04.836 - 00:26:13.520, Speaker B: You think, this hasn't been done yet? Probably because there was no incentive to do it, because rates previously were higher in DeFi, so there was no incentive to go by a ten year old.
00:26:13.572 - 00:27:06.650, Speaker A: There's no incentive to do it. And also, I think that there's a lot of just opportunity. There's a lot of white space that already existed in just defi on its own. And I think this is one of the things that we discuss in the report, because it's thought provoking. It's like, okay, what could happen in order to bring more sophisticated institutions in and bootstrap relatively rich and kind of more sophisticated fixed income market in DeFi. But then at the same time, there's so much white space in DeFi anyway. It's kind of like, does this actually even need to happen in the short term, or is there other stuff? I mean, particularly with the collapse of CFI, there's an opportunity to build out all of that infrastructure and trading volume can migrate from what was previously in CFI exchanges into DeFi.
00:27:06.650 - 00:27:07.374, Speaker A: Anyway.
00:27:09.354 - 00:27:10.458, Speaker B: Can we talk about.
00:27:10.586 - 00:27:43.774, Speaker C: I'd like to go in a little bit more detail about. So we talked about like, one of the opportunities, like a big bucket, right? Being fixed rate mortgages that are native to crypto or defi. The other one that you sort of just briefly touched on there a little bit is more complex financial instruments for tradfi, like swaptions and those sorts of markets. But then there's also products for corporates. And that was the section that you outlined in your piece. I'd love to. When I think about corporates interacting with financial markets, I usually think about them hedging raw materials and things like that.
00:27:43.774 - 00:28:09.880, Speaker C: Right. So if youre buying a whole bunch, it was sort of my background before this, but if youre buying a whole bunch of steel or something like that, right. You dont want your gross. Thats an enormous part of what makes up your gross margin. You cant have that fluctuating 100% year over year. So you go out into the market and you buy futures to sort of hedge that out. And same thing with anything that you, that goes into your product, and then same thing with interest rate swaps.
00:28:09.880 - 00:28:30.720, Speaker C: If you do business in multiple different jurisdictions all over the globe, you don't want to be taking interest rate risk because you can get slammed if like the dollar goes way up and get a bunch of international business. How do you think about what are some of the opportunities or reasons why corporates would want to engage in some of like on chain products and yeah, let's start there.
00:28:30.752 - 00:29:13.620, Speaker A: Actually, I think the short term opportunity is lower cost of borrowing. And the short answer is, I don't know if it'd be a corporate directly or be a corporate through some sort of institution. I think it's probably more likely to be a corporate through another institution where they're packaging up the low cost borrowing that you can get from DeFi through to them. But then over time, I think it's, I mean, there's a whole variety of different structured products that can be built. I think one of the kind of by far most interesting at the moment is that people are using state ETH. I mean, this is not defi plus tradfi. This is just kind of like defi.
00:29:13.620 - 00:30:00.656, Speaker A: And what's native to defi, people are using state ethers effectively. Thinking about it is the base rate of the metaverse, so to speak. And there is a kind of relatively predictable yield that comes off the back of that. If you start hedging that yield away, you can start building all sorts of structured products. You can predictably buy options, for example, of the fact that you have a predictable source of yield coming off your staked ETH, and those types of at least even just having access to a diversified set of yield sources for a corporate, a very sophisticated corporate that can start to become pretty interesting. But you need interest rate swap markets in order for those types of structured products to exist.
00:30:00.800 - 00:30:31.224, Speaker B: Do you think that off chain entities end up doing this or do you think that we're basically just in a waiting game for on chain entities to get. Because I can see this happening in the next cycle with protocols that are spitting off revenue. They go to these markets, they take out a loan, the corporate loan market gets recreated and the credit market gets recreated, but only with on chain entities. Do you think that we're basically just waiting for the on chain world to get really, really big? Or do you think these off chain entities in the next cycle are actually going to take advantage of this?
00:30:35.044 - 00:31:38.828, Speaker A: It's an interesting. So I think DeFi is going to. My personal opinion is I think that DeFi is just the fundamentals of the technology and the fundamentals of the ecosystem are so strong that like I think the direction of travel for the whole ecosystem whilst has kind of had a difficult second half of the year actually coming out the other side, we're going to end up with a much kind of like stronger set of primitives that kind of really facilitate, kind of like the smart creation of financial markets. So my personal view is that by the next cycle I think that's going to be massive. I still think that you probably end up with institute, I mean institutions I don't think are going to just completely disappear between now and the next cycle. So I think you're still going to have institutions that are interacting with these very low level rails and much more efficient mechanisms of creating markets than a centralized entity. Which means that they may package up products for corporates, for example, off these low level rails.
00:31:38.828 - 00:32:03.464, Speaker A: Or what's amazing about DeFi is if a corporate is sophisticated enough to be able to interact directly, they may choose to do that as well. But yeah, I think the short answer is unfortunately, I think between now and the next cycle I don't think all institutions are just going to disappear. But I do think DeFi is going to essentially become the new set of rails which people are interacting through, if that makes sense.
00:32:04.934 - 00:33:04.344, Speaker C: This is a little bit of a callback to actually the season of Bell curve that you helped us kick off. But do you ever see ultimately what we're driving towards here? There's these two separate rate regimes, but ultimately Jason, I believe this is too, and I know you do as well with building volts that there's going to be a rich defi native interest rate but also fixed fixed income market that's native to crypto and I think the question Jason was getting at there, but one that I spent a lot of time thinking about and came up in that season of Bell curve we did, was, is the demand going to be greater from corporates or institutions who seek this stuff on chain, or there are these on chain entities, Daos. Right. That could basically they engage. Everyone engages in equity financing right now, but eventually you'll have predictable cash flows and you'll be more mature and seek to add debt financing. So I'd be curious if you see that as a potential driver eventually.
00:33:05.084 - 00:33:12.876, Speaker A: Yeah, I remember it. I think there's one person that was like, yeah, it's Dallas borrowing. I forget exactly who that was.
00:33:12.940 - 00:33:16.260, Speaker C: I guess it might have been Ben or. I can't remember, actually.
00:33:16.332 - 00:34:29.614, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, no, I remember. I remember listening to it. Like, I think a combination, I think by next cycle, though, I still think a large part of it's going to be institutions and institutions. There is a kind of, if you really zoom out, it's actually more with kind of the c five collapse. If you really zoom out, like, how do you create a financial system? I kind of find that quite interesting, an interesting, like, thought broking question, because what we've had historically is we've had like centralized institutions essentially acting as the gatekeepers to the whole financial world. And the issue with that in many ways is that those centralized institutions are extremely opaque and have got massive capacity for incentive misalignment, which basically means a society like our solution to make sure that that doesn't happen is we just regulate the hell out of them. But inevitably, by definition, regulation lags innovation.
00:34:29.614 - 00:35:02.857, Speaker A: So every now and then we've had these instances where the regulators haven't understood the risks that exist in the sector, and we've had these like spectacular blow ups in centralized institutions. So we saw that, I think most notably in 2008, global financial crisis. And frankly, what's happened in c five is just, in my opinion, is a repeat of that. It's just opaque systems, incentive misalignment regulation isn't there. It blows up. So long term. Well, so then that kind of brings you on to what's the other way of creating a financial system.
00:35:02.857 - 00:36:01.674, Speaker A: And I think the thing that's so exciting about DeFi is in many ways its polar opposite of that. Instead of having these really opaque kind of institutions, you actually have transparent open source protocols. Instead of having the capacity for incentive misalignment, you actually have these trustless systems which nobody is in control of. And then ultimately, instead of having the need to regulate, arguably, because the rules of the system are known to everybody. Arguably, the infrastructure regulates itself. So, really long term, coming back to your original question, I'd love all institutions to basically disappear and the financial system to be built off these open source, permissionless protocols by the next cycle. Where do I think it's going to get to? I think there's opportunity for, I think particularly trading infrastructure, to completely displays kind of every form of centralized exchange.
00:36:01.674 - 00:36:43.860, Speaker A: And a good example of that in relation to what we're doing is London Clearinghouse. It's an entity in London. It's responsible for about 90% of the world's interest rate swap clearing. They have to employ thousands of people to maintain that exchange, and it still is extremely opaque, and it's regulated the hell out of in order to make sure that it works as it should do for society. But why does that need to exist? I don't think it does. I think the entire thing can be replaced with smart contracts, but by the next cycle, there's still going to be institutions, I think, ultimately sat on top of that, driving a lot of that volume through those new rails. Long answer, but I find it interesting.
00:36:44.012 - 00:37:30.462, Speaker C: Yeah, no, I do as well, and maybe we can even. I would love to. I know we've talked about this at length, and I've heard you talk about blockworks podcasts and other podcasts, but it would be good to maybe get back, just so we provide context for listeners who might not have that background. Just about why what Volts is doing is so important and why we need the ability to borrow at fixed rates. Because I think, could we actually start with mechanically, because you started this episode by saying, look, there are structural reasons in the technology why we only have variable rates. I actually also found, when doing that season of Bell Curve, there's no such thing as a 30 year fixed rate mortgage in the wild, either. Those also get created by interest rate swaps.
00:37:30.462 - 00:38:03.694, Speaker C: Even if you look at Libor, which preceded Sonia, that was variable, too. And the reason was these bankers in London called each other overnight. They were like, hey, how much would you theoretically loan me for? And they got in a lot of trouble for manipulating that eventually, but it changed. Based on what? Not the technology, but the bankers feelings. And then that has to get hedged out with people that want to speculate on interest rates. But could you just describe why structurally, the rates are variable in crypto right now, and why it's important for us to give people the ability to borrow in fixed rates?
00:38:04.154 - 00:39:07.118, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess this goes back twelve months ago to the problem that we're looking to solve with vaults. This mental framework sometimes that I use, which is just if we look at the stack, the entire stack that exists in DeFi, if you go right to the bottom of the stack, essentially right at the bottom, you have nodes that are validating blocks on a block by block basis, and the yield that effectively comes out of those nodes is variable in nature. So right at the base of the ecosystem, you have variable rates coming out. On top of that, you essentially have your protocol layer. And the vast majority of protocols that have been built in DeFi rely on supply and demand dynamics. Whereas supply and demand changes, the rates that are produced out of those protocols changes. So again, at that layer, you have variable rates of return, and then at the very top, you kind of have your institutions who are building trading strategies and perhaps market making.
00:39:07.118 - 00:40:16.780, Speaker A: But even the most sophisticated, even if they're following some sort of market neutral strategy, that is still going to produce variable rates of return. So the entire ecosystem produces variable rates. And there have been times in the past where those rates have been extremely volatile. There's actually been instances where borrowing costs have jumped from 2% to 40%, back to 2% again in a few days. Um, which clearly, if we, if we want the whole ecosystem to be able to serve the financial needs of the world, right, like that can't continue to be the case. Um, and there had not been, until we kind of created vaults, there had not been an efficient mechanism to move something from a variable rate to a fixed rate, which can, if you think about what vaults does at the most macro level, it enables you to transition from something that is unstable, do something that is stable. And because that can be applied essentially synthetically across the entire stack, it means that there is the opportunity for the whole stack, in many ways to become stable for those that want it.
00:40:16.780 - 00:40:48.040, Speaker A: Which what that means is it means that we have massively expanded the use cases for the ecosystem, which we're starting to see play out. Like, obviously, since we launched, we've had about 25% growth week on week, which a lot of that is people trading and also hedging risk associated with, say, staked ETH. But we're actually also now what's exciting is we're starting to see teams coming in and building new products on top of the fact that this new market.
00:40:48.112 - 00:41:04.518, Speaker C: Exists in Defi in the end state as well. Just to give tradfi analogs for why, like to just compliment your sort of intuitive statement about why 2% to 40% to 2% is a problem, is because if your mortgage rate worked like that.
00:41:04.566 - 00:41:04.774, Speaker A: Right.
00:41:04.814 - 00:41:09.902, Speaker C: If you look at the, you could never do it. No one would own a house if that was, if that was the case.
00:41:09.998 - 00:41:11.838, Speaker B: Or companies could never borrow like that.
00:41:11.886 - 00:41:44.548, Speaker C: Companies could never borrow. Right. Right. That's the important, that's the important thing. So I guess like this, these relationships that you've outlined in this paper, Simon, do you expect that to, to continue? Like one of the, one of the difficulties, right. Is like, first of all, correlation doesn't necessarily equal causation, right? We know that from, like, statistics and stuff like that. But also, one of the things that is so hard about inflation trying to, even in tradfi, like, people don't have great explanations for why inflation really happens, because so few instances of inflation do happen.
00:41:44.548 - 00:41:55.184, Speaker C: So we just have not very many data points. So how are we going to kind of continue to track this relationship? Should we expect it to repeat and this anti correlation to be sustained into the future?
00:41:56.204 - 00:42:52.058, Speaker A: It's. Do you know, it's a really interesting question, because I think the closer that the two worlds become, that actually they start to inverse, they start to go from being anti correlated to being correlated. If the entire world is borrowing on Defi rails, then you'd expect there to be some sort of correlation between tradfi and Defi raids. Like heavy correlation. I guess the real question is what happens in the short to medium term? And that's where we call out the fact that anybody who's able to operate across Defi and tradfi rate markets, if you have tradfi rates existing in DeFi such that you can trade the two in the same venue, then that opens up a huge amount of ARB opportunity, which clearly, if you just really zoom out over time, the ARB is clearly going to disappear, as all arms do, which the other way of saying that is over time, you'd expect the two to become correlated. Yeah.
00:42:52.066 - 00:42:55.134, Speaker B: If enough people are, are about that opportunity, then.
00:42:55.634 - 00:42:55.922, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:42:55.938 - 00:42:56.794, Speaker C: I mean, like, honestly.
00:42:56.874 - 00:42:59.330, Speaker B: And then they go from anti correlation to correlation.
00:42:59.522 - 00:43:10.232, Speaker A: But if we didn't, like, just if we didn't have, if we had absolutely zero friction between on and off rams with regards to on and off rams, everybody would be boring for Defi.
00:43:10.338 - 00:43:11.984, Speaker B: Right, right.
00:43:12.724 - 00:43:24.356, Speaker C: Which is so funny you say that, because I think that if you follow that to its, like, logical conclusion, every big business in crypto has been built off of bringing something in from tradfi or the real world.
00:43:24.420 - 00:43:24.620, Speaker A: Right?
00:43:24.652 - 00:43:41.076, Speaker C: Like, exchanges are the best example of that. Kind of like, they import capital from the real world. But a really interesting business that has also done. This is circle. Circle has done a phenomenal job of importing dollars into crypto as well. And it's a structural advantage. Right.
00:43:41.076 - 00:43:49.624, Speaker C: That I can. You have to imagine people are looking at that business being like, okay, we would also like to do that. Or maybe it's importing instead of dollars. It's treasuries.
00:43:49.924 - 00:43:50.300, Speaker A: Maybe.
00:43:50.332 - 00:44:02.276, Speaker C: Maybe it's on chain treasuries. Right. Someone just puts that on chain, and it could be as simple as circle. Like, they just put a box in and they buy a bunch of treasuries and then they issue treasuries. And there's an on chain oracle, and Bob's your uncle.
00:44:02.460 - 00:44:03.268, Speaker A: I don't know.
00:44:03.396 - 00:44:04.064, Speaker B: But.
00:44:06.364 - 00:44:16.026, Speaker A: You know what? I think the pro, the pro. I mean, I wish it was that simple. My feeling is that it's regulatory. That is the competition. Right. Yeah. Yeah.
00:44:16.026 - 00:44:22.298, Speaker A: That makes sense. Otherwise. Otherwise we'd have done it already. Yeah. Yeah.
00:44:22.346 - 00:44:41.984, Speaker C: You'd guess so. Well, Simon, I mean, this has been. First of all, we'll link the report that you published in the show notes. Do you have any, just closing thoughts for our listeners here on anything that we might not have covered or anything that you want folks to know about volts and what you guys are building?
00:44:43.044 - 00:45:16.840, Speaker A: I think the thing that I would say is that it is unbelievably straightforward. If we wanted to, to create sofa rate markets on chain and to trade that through vaults. We haven't made a decision in the short term as to whether we're going to do that or not. I think if you actually play out that medium long term view, of course we're going to do it. Like, it has to happen. These two worlds have to come together. But if there's anyone that's listening that is thinking kind of, wow, if those two things existed right now, there's all these things that I could do.
00:45:16.840 - 00:45:19.964, Speaker A: Obviously, we'd love to be talking to them. Cool.
00:45:20.344 - 00:45:21.364, Speaker B: Awesome, man.
00:45:21.784 - 00:45:22.640, Speaker A: So great.
00:45:22.752 - 00:45:24.312, Speaker B: It's been a fun man.
00:45:24.408 - 00:45:26.656, Speaker A: Yeah. Thanks for coming on. Always fun.
00:45:26.840 - 00:45:27.472, Speaker B: Always fun.
00:45:27.528 - 00:45:27.712, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:45:27.728 - 00:45:29.452, Speaker B: Good chatting with you. We'll talk to you soon.
00:45:29.608 - 00:45:30.424, Speaker A: See you.
