00:00:00.320 - 00:00:02.822, Speaker A: There's a lot of people who, like, yell from rooftops or like, look at.
00:00:02.846 - 00:00:04.022, Speaker B: My X or Y partnership.
00:00:04.086 - 00:00:05.726, Speaker A: But I ultimately think that, like, the.
00:00:05.758 - 00:00:09.342, Speaker B: Applications and the numbers and the users tend to tell the real story, have.
00:00:09.366 - 00:00:26.682, Speaker C: The virtuous cycle going. It won't necessarily always be going at the speed, you know, at which, like, the Monad community or the Monad's repute grew, like right after a fundraise, for example. If you're doing the right things, if you have the right principles, then when you go through that boost, you are really able to take advantage of it.
00:00:26.766 - 00:01:01.924, Speaker D: Hey everyone, we all know blockchain is changing the world, but who's actually driving it? I'm excited to invite you to the 6th edition of Meridian, a web3 conference hosted by the Stellar Development foundation in London. From October 15 through 17. Get early bird tickets at meridian dot stellar.org with code blockworkspod. Special thanks to stellar for sponsoring us. Now let's get into today's episode. Everyone knows there's a massive shortage of top senior marketers in crypto, and teams are constantly struggling to get their go to market done right.
00:01:01.924 - 00:01:33.696, Speaker D: That's why we're excited to have partnered up with Renault Partners, the premier go to market advisory firm for early stage crypto. Teams get in touch with their team by heading on over to Renaud Partners.com or giving the co founder Jeff a follow on x. Check out the links in the description below. Hey everyone. Jason here. Have you ever wanted to play casino games with your friends right from your couch? I'm excited to tell you about my prize, the first multiplayer online casino where you can play, chat and win together.
00:01:33.696 - 00:02:01.880, Speaker D: When you make your first deposit of dollar ten or more, you'll get dollar 20 for free. Head on over to myprize.com, invite Empire to get started. What's up, everyone? Before we jump into today's episode, I'm excited to share Empire's first ever security partner. Harpy is the best tool to prevent your wallet from theft in real time. Harpy is not just a security solution, they are a piece of mind solution. But don't just take our word for it.
00:02:01.880 - 00:02:16.620, Speaker D: Harpy is the only wallet security solution that protected 100% of its users from attacks like the ledger one in Q four, which was an off chain signature attack. To learn more about Harpy, click the link in the show notes or visit Harpy IO forward slash empire.
00:02:19.360 - 00:02:21.408, Speaker E: All right, everyone, welcome back to Empire.
00:02:21.584 - 00:02:25.792, Speaker D: We got a little casual Friday morning community building chat with two of the.
00:02:25.816 - 00:02:32.100, Speaker E: Goats Keone from Monad Smokey from Bear chain. So, Keoni, Smokey, welcome to Empire, guys.
00:02:32.760 - 00:02:34.300, Speaker C: Yeah, thanks for having us.
00:02:34.680 - 00:02:36.736, Speaker A: Cheers, man. Always good to be here.
00:02:36.848 - 00:03:08.230, Speaker E: Yeah, I guess I should say welcome back. Okay, so there's a. I actually want to do this a little differently than most of the pods you guys have been on. There are a lot of podcasts that you've both been on talking about the technical aspects of why Monad is better or bear chain is better, and proof of liquidity and parallelization, all that kind of good stuff. And we can link those in the show notes. I don't want to talk about any of that, actually. I would like to talk about community building ecosystem bd, just the general development of the l one l two ecosystem.
00:03:08.230 - 00:03:20.192, Speaker E: So I thought it'd be fun to start with a question about the other person, actually. So, Smokey, I think I'll pick on you for this. This first one. How would you describe the Monad community relative to bear chain?
00:03:20.336 - 00:04:22.310, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure, man. I think generally, they seem like a pretty inviting and welcoming bunch. I think that there's, like, a pretty interesting focus or encouragement around, like, it seems like content creation and, like, sort of, like, funky art and visuals. They've got, like, their own, you know, swath of mascots of various animals and, like, reptilian creatures, among other things that would appear so. I think there's, like, there's a kind of fun vibe there that seems to have been built. It feels, I think when I think about it in perspective to the parachain community, a little bit more, what's the right word? It feels a little bit more friendly to the point of, hey, this is welcoming in a sense that can be seen as desirable by some and perhaps less by others if they're MOre crunchy, jaded CT natives. I think that, on the other hand, when I think about the bear chain community, there's definitely some folks who are pretty wag me and a little bit more monot esque in that manner, feel like there's a little bit heavier waiting towards, like, the edge lords or like, the guys who are just perhaps a little bit more mentally ill.
00:04:22.310 - 00:04:53.090, Speaker A: That might be my initial impression. And then I think that the other thing that I think about a bunch is, like, there seems to be a good Lore being developed and, like, you know, good, like, good backstories existing within the various characters in those communities. And I think that they do a lot in terms of, like, I'm not sure whether it's, like, Telegram oriented or discord oriented, like, missions or quests to, like, you know, sort of engage in certain things and, like, help produce x or y forms of content, probably in combination with different strategic initiatives in the community. So it feels like a well coordinated group.
00:04:53.390 - 00:04:56.490, Speaker E: Keone, same question, but inverse for you.
00:04:57.830 - 00:06:19.722, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that the Barachain community also have a ton of respect for Barachain community and what the team has done to help cultivate that, and then the contributions that the different individuals within the Barachain community for sure have made to help really put the community on the map and really make the community kind of famous. I agree with that characterization. I think the branding of Barachain seems to be a little bit more bear oriented. That sounds really dumb to say, but just like, there's more of a. A single coherent theme of, like, okay, bears and then honey, and then I don't know what other things related to that. So maybe it's like, a little bit easier for people to riff off of, like, just other things that are related to bears. Whereas I think for the monad community lore, it's maybe initially started a little bit more randomly with just a character that someone uploaded that then kind of, like, through community curation, rose to the top and ended up taking up more and more mind share.
00:06:19.722 - 00:06:38.898, Speaker C: And then, so the lore is developed a little bit randomly and organically, but it's probably true for everything. So I don't know. But yeah, there's more new characters being created within the Monad story verse, let's say. In my view, you know, a lot.
00:06:38.914 - 00:06:44.830, Speaker F: Of what we talk about here is community and culture. How would you define that?
00:06:47.570 - 00:07:06.594, Speaker A: That's a good question, man. I think it comes from a number of different aspects. On one hand, it is what is, like, the first thing that people think about when they think about your brand or your chain, if you will, it's like, what is that instinctual feeling? I do think a lot of it is that oddly psychologically driven portion of it. It's like, oh, how does this brand.
00:07:06.642 - 00:07:07.986, Speaker B: Or community or group make me feel?
00:07:08.058 - 00:07:43.332, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the culture is also sort of endemic to that in terms of like, okay, how does this make me feel? And what does this make me want to do right? Or what is broadly encouraged? Is it encouraged for people to hang out with each other, to try to better each other? Is it encouraged for people to shitpost and copy pasta and make memes and fuck around and find out? Is it encouraged for people to just be absolute violence on the Internet? What is that baseline? And I guess that, you know, the way that we think about it a lot is how do you build a culture that, that feels authentic and real? And how do you build something where, you know, it can be approachable from.
00:07:43.356 - 00:07:44.540, Speaker B: A number of other audiences and.
00:07:44.580 - 00:07:46.092, Speaker A: But also, like, malleable over time.
00:07:46.156 - 00:07:46.644, Speaker B: Right.
00:07:46.772 - 00:08:20.332, Speaker A: So I think that, like, in many cases, we've tried to stay true to our roots or our origins of, like, you know, we try to be fairly competent in the work that we do, but we also try not to be serious because I think that being overly serious is one of the biggest turn offs. And I think that when I approach and then see a lot of these other l one and l two ecosystems of the past, there's been many times where they actually sort of, like, leave people with this feeling of, like, belittlement almost, right? Or it's like, you are not good enough to understand X or Y. This is not a space for you, right. So I think that there's a degree.
00:08:20.356 - 00:08:22.092, Speaker B: Of authenticity that comes a lot with.
00:08:22.116 - 00:09:00.700, Speaker A: Like, building effective community and culture. It's like, hey, we are not manipulating you guys to perform x or y actions. We're not trying to farm you guys. We are going to try to build x or y things that seem interesting as a whole, and we're going to try to build a culture of excellence around building cool shit while having a good time, right? And I think that that has probably been how we think about culture and community the most. And then when it comes to community, I feel that's a series of, like, you know, little ripples where you sort of like, you know, help plant seeds for a little while, but you don't actually want to have a heavy hand in that. You kind of just want to, like, give people ideas, or you kind of just want to, like, talk about what an ideal end world might look like. And if people resonate with those ideas.
00:09:00.740 - 00:09:03.024, Speaker B: And some of them might rise to the occasion and say, hey, we're going.
00:09:03.032 - 00:09:11.968, Speaker A: To go and run this for us, I think a lot of the stuff that is actually thought of as being done by the foundation for Bear chain is actually just a product of a.
00:09:11.984 - 00:09:13.432, Speaker B: Bunch of randoms in the community who've.
00:09:13.456 - 00:09:16.392, Speaker A: Been around for a couple years and said, hey, I'm going to take matters.
00:09:16.416 - 00:09:17.392, Speaker B: Into my own hands.
00:09:17.456 - 00:09:54.880, Speaker A: Whether that is the app builders, whether that's stuff like the honey jar, which is a community initiative that's evolving into a super team esque structure that's helping with a whole bunch of ecosystem work and grants and exposure for different projects and community resources, or whether that's even more targeting targeted initiatives like the bare bodies like I wish I could say that I played a role in helping manufacture any of these things, but in most cases, I just, you know, bounced around ideas with folks and said, hey, this sounds kind of cool, or this sounds pretty cursed. Maybe we don't do that. And tried to provide guardrails, and then it just sort of turns into a set of organic interactions where people hopefully help each other and have a good time while doing so.
00:09:55.780 - 00:10:24.456, Speaker E: The counter to maybe the openness, Smokey, is one of the best ways to build a brand is to say who you're not for, I think, and to almost make it exclusive at the beginning, and it kind of compounds from there. So, like, I think Anatolian Raj did a really good job of this at Solana. It was like chewing glass, and they would openly say, look, it's really fricking hard to build here. We don't want everyone. Nine out of ten people aren't cut out to build on Solana now. It's more open. Now, that's not the message, but in the early days, that was the message.
00:10:24.456 - 00:10:31.920, Speaker E: Um, I'm curious how you guys think about, like, building for a really targeted set of people, and then eventually you have to open it up.
00:10:33.740 - 00:10:54.510, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that's. That's a good point. There is definitely a. I mean, there's a lot of ways to think about it. You could think of it as, like, bulking and cutting cycles. And so, you know, maybe there's some periods where the. The right thing to do is to be more exclusive, to be.
00:10:54.510 - 00:11:32.748, Speaker C: I see a lot of early communities now starting to. Trying to start off by creating this era of exclusivity. Like, oh, we just opened our discord for ten minutes, and anyone who got in is in, but now you can't get in that kind of thing. I think there is a potential issue where now that everyone's trying to do that, it might not be nearly as effective. And then also the actual experience in the discord or in whatever, like, gated community like that. It actually needs to be something that's valuable to people. Otherwise, it just.
00:11:32.748 - 00:12:27.700, Speaker C: It will end up fizzling out. So I think that the idea of building community ultimately has to be about giving, like, trying to create an environment that the people enjoy being in and trying to offer value to the community members. And, you know, sometimes the, like, one requirement, actually, for the community being a pleasant place to be in is gating the entry in some way, mostly so that spammers don't get in and just send a bunch of GM's and ask a bunch of repetitive questions just to try to, like, farm engagement. And so that's. That's, I think, also increasingly becoming a problem for new projects in the space is, like, sort of filtering out the. The signal from the noise. It's almost like the.
00:12:27.700 - 00:13:33.290, Speaker C: I forgot what it's called, like the vanishing point or something. A while ago, I was, and this is a little bit of a tangent, but it gets harder and harder for just a thought that I had for crypto startups to hire engineers over time, because over time, more and more of the job applicants will be North Koreans. And so to have to sort through that number of potentially malicious people, it becomes a higher and higher burden over time. And kind of in the same way, when you're building a community, it gets actually harder and harder over time because there are more and more bots that are going to kind of, like, swarm and overwhelm you, and there's zero cost to the bot operators to run all these bots, so they're going to definitely swarm more and more and gating the community, or having some level protection to make the community a pleasant environment. Plus actually being very thoughtful about, like, what it is that people actually, you know, what benefit people are getting from being in the community. Those two things together really important for growing an early community.
00:13:34.470 - 00:14:14.460, Speaker F: We're in that state of the market where, like, every cycle, people come out and say, we have too much info. Why do we need competing l one s? Why do we need other ecosystems? Why don't we just double down on what's existing? And obviously, you guys disagree with that. I mean, you go out, you're building your own. Um, how much of. How much of the builders that you're attracting are very mercenary ish, like, very profit seeking. And one, do you care to, what can you do about that? And, like, does it matter for you guys? Right?
00:14:15.320 - 00:14:47.060, Speaker A: Yeah, good question, man. I think this actually ties in a little bit to what Yano asked earlier in that, like, I think that in Tolie and Raj saying, hey, you guys got to eat glass, you guys are going to have a horrible time here. I think that actually creates a high pass filter, like a higher barrier for entry. And the best goal there really is to self select for the people who are going to be able to go the distance. Crypto is famously problematic in terms of incentives when it comes to long and short termism, if you will, and probably weighs a lot heavier towards short termism at the moment. And I think that there are certain.
00:14:47.100 - 00:14:48.716, Speaker B: Things that one can encourage within their.
00:14:48.748 - 00:14:58.690, Speaker A: Messaging, within comms, and within incentive programs at the chain and mechanism level or the foundation level to do your best, like avoid said mercenary counterparties.
00:14:58.730 - 00:14:58.882, Speaker B: Right.
00:14:58.906 - 00:15:11.658, Speaker A: And there's a number of debt giveaways in many cases, but what you're really trying to create is on one hand a degree of like loyalty and allegiance, I think, and a willingness to take a concentrated bet. And on the other hand, I think.
00:15:11.674 - 00:15:13.226, Speaker B: A degree of vendor lock in, as.
00:15:13.258 - 00:15:16.186, Speaker A: Cursed as that might sound, but I don't think it's actually entirely inaccurate.
00:15:16.218 - 00:15:16.410, Speaker B: Right.
00:15:16.450 - 00:15:17.986, Speaker A: You think about the slot in web two.
00:15:18.098 - 00:15:19.002, Speaker B: Is there a way that one can.
00:15:19.026 - 00:15:49.864, Speaker A: Increase switching costs, but is there a way that one can actually drive enough value, the protocols building around you to actually make that increasing switching costs, if you will, worthwhile for that protocol such that it's not a antagonistic relationship for us? I think there's a couple of things that we do to ensure that we avoid mercenary builders. One is, I think that we try to be very diligent in our processes when it comes to understanding the backgrounds and the previous work of folks that we're working with within the ecosystem. I simply think that just doing a little bit of homework can reveal a.
00:15:49.872 - 00:15:51.448, Speaker B: Lot of information on what people have.
00:15:51.464 - 00:15:58.332, Speaker A: Or have not been involved in in the past, which can definitely pay some dividends and avoid some grenades. I think on the other hand, we.
00:15:58.356 - 00:16:00.108, Speaker B: Don'T run any grant programs, and we.
00:16:00.124 - 00:16:06.268, Speaker A: Think that the vast majority of granted incentive programs of that sort are quite toxic and more than anything attract these.
00:16:06.324 - 00:16:07.796, Speaker B: Mercenary farmers and builders.
00:16:07.868 - 00:16:26.782, Speaker A: And in the same way as Keone was talking about bots, there's a very similar sense of like, you know, bought builders of sorts who are just like, you know, spitting up really shitty univ two and Aave three forks at Max speed to try to farm grants across every ecosystem without a developed, you know, set of primitives. So I think that one of the.
00:16:26.846 - 00:16:27.998, Speaker B: Easiest things that you can do is.
00:16:28.014 - 00:17:18.028, Speaker A: Simply be very upfront in that messaging, and then also to have a very rationally skeptical view on a lot of builders. I think that what that leads to at the end of it all is actually just a focus on net new applications. Because I would say that the majority of mercenaries are not always building something that is net new. Certainly some are very competent and they're saying, hey, I'm building something you've never seen before. Pay me to come here and build this and we'll go to whoever bids the most for us. But I do think that what actually happens at that point is that if you can help convince that person that maybe as opposed to taking a short term is more mercenary mindset on this, that there's an opportunity to really make it something generational or something that is category defining and to go along on it, then I think it is possible to turn mercenaries into missionaries. I think ideally you just find missionaries in the first place.
00:17:18.028 - 00:17:21.080, Speaker A: But that's been our internal thinking on this front.
00:17:22.230 - 00:17:35.090, Speaker E: Keone, would love to hear your thoughts on that also. Keone, I'd love to hear you passed over this comment about trying to avoid hiring North Koreans. So we'd love like 1 second of commentary on that. But also would love your response to Santi's question.
00:17:37.110 - 00:18:26.892, Speaker C: Yeah, sure thing. Yeah. Maybe just to explain that a little bit further, I think there's. Yeah, this is a specific comment about, you know, when you're hiring solidity engineers. You know, they're definitely, there have been a number of notable incidents in the space where a team hired someone who was either anon or maybe they weren't anon, but like they portrayed themselves to be like, I don't know, in another country. So they couldn't like turn on their camera or they couldnt travel in to interview. And then there actually was some sort of attack on the protocol months later after things launched.
00:18:26.892 - 00:19:22.240, Speaker C: I think Munchables was a good example of that. And when I say North Korean thats kind of like maybe lazy phrase, but just in general someone who is trying to infiltrate a company to insert a backdoor in some way. And I just think over time there's more and more of these resumes floating around or more and more automated submission of these resumes to job postings. So it becomes harder and harder for folks to sift through all of that. There are definitely a lot of telltale signs. In the past I've written about this on Twitter, how to spot a quote unquote north korean software developer applicant. So I think there are ways to train oneself to just have the right set of questions to ask.
00:19:22.240 - 00:19:33.258, Speaker C: But it is definitely becoming a higher burden or just more and more overhead for folks, especially hiring certain roles, especially solidity engineers to deal with.
00:19:33.444 - 00:19:51.450, Speaker E: Yeah, I guess back to Santi's question. Who do you think of when you think of the ideal person to come build in Monad Keone? Do you ever meet someone you're like, honestly, you should go build in Solana or Barachain or movement or se? Or avalanche or something else? Or are you like, look, we're come one, come all?
00:19:52.030 - 00:20:53.910, Speaker C: Yeah, that's an interesting question. It's very much come one, come all. I do think that I agree with Smokey's point about how a lot of the grant farming developers are proposing to build something that's very similar to something that already exists. And I think anyone that's trying to build something that's very unique, very differentiated, there's no problem with that at all. It just like there's different spectrums of aggressiveness in terms of how speculative of an application a team is willing to build. Some people are very focused on things where the path to the story of how this is going to be a very useful app is very easy to understand, like a very straight path. But it's also probably because it's more similar to other things that have come before that have been successful.
00:20:53.910 - 00:21:21.664, Speaker C: And then there are other ideas that are just much more inherently speculative in nature. And yeah, I think that I'm definitely excited about some of those more speculative ideas because I think that's what the space needs is just a much broader diversity of efforts. And that's how we ultimately get apps that can cross the chasm to mass adoption.
00:21:21.862 - 00:21:58.060, Speaker E: Before we go a little, because I want to spend a whole section on ecosystem and stuff like that, there's one thing I want to talk about before moving into that, which is founder brand building instead of just the brand of Monad and the brand of Barachain. How do you guys think about just your personal brand and striking this balance between Degen and professional? I feel like you come across very level headed, cool headed, balanced, savvy, engineer like Smokey. You're a little more like dgen, like fun memes, things like that. How do you guys think about striking that balance?
00:22:00.640 - 00:23:17.226, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess I think about it a lot in terms of how does it resonate with a broader brand, but also just how does it remain authentic? I don't want to ever attempt to morph myself or my public image into something that is going to be misrepresentative of when people meet me irl or we end up chatting, etcetera. I think that it's been an interesting tool for us, though, because I think a lot of people, especially going into this next little while, have very high expectations, probably for both teams here. And I think that, on the other hand, what's been kind of nice is that there's a lot of people that just sort of wrote off bear chain from the start because they're just like, okay, there's a bunch of bears and these guys are anonymous and like, what the fuck is going on? This looks really stupid. And it has a name like Barachain, which is meant to induce stupidity. So, like, I think that there's very much a set of folks that thinks like, hey, if I talk to these guys, they're gonna be clowns. And I don't mind that, actually, because I think I'd much rather have that contrast or that cognitive dissonance and hopefully not come off as a clown when I chat with these folks. It's been an interesting recurring theme sometimes when we have a conversation with people that have only ever seen us online, or perhaps who have, like, not just dug in too much, and on one hand, that can backfire spectacularly if that becomes the dominant narrative.
00:23:17.226 - 00:23:48.564, Speaker A: On the other hand, it's something where I think that if enough people see these network effects forming and keep on asking themselves, hey, why are all my friends who I respect and who I think are competent, excited about or backing or building on ver chain, then I think it actually leads to a really interesting set of what the fuck? Moments where people are like, I am confused by this and I am interested in this, and therefore I wish to learn more. I guess when I think about founder brand, I try to keep it as real as possible while also being responsible towards baritone as a whole.
00:23:48.612 - 00:23:48.796, Speaker B: Right.
00:23:48.828 - 00:23:50.484, Speaker A: I'm not going to go off on.
00:23:50.572 - 00:23:52.388, Speaker B: Unhinged tangents for no good reason, but.
00:23:52.404 - 00:23:57.760, Speaker A: I'm also not going to try to make myself seem like a suit when I'm relatively far from the such.
00:23:58.940 - 00:24:31.174, Speaker F: I've definitely had those interactions with. People ask me, they know I'm an investor in parachain and they're like, there's very polarizing views. Not so much for Monad, I think, uh, but especially for bear. Bear chain, people are like, this is like the next terror. How. You know, how, like, why is it that you're pushing it? Like, why do you like about it? Uh, I think in part it people don't understand, like, proof of liquidity and, you know, they do. You think that while I agree with.
00:24:31.174 - 00:25:14.860, Speaker F: With everything you guys are saying, that sometimes you want to create, like, a high barrier to be self selecting for people that are serious people that are committed. On the other hand, it may present a roadblock in attracting other investors or attracting where people might just rule you out. And it is a very competitive landscape. I think both of you guys have a healthy, vibrant startup ecosystem of projects building. I've met a few on Monad. I met and invested in a number in Barachain, as I have in other ecosystems. I'd like to double click on this.
00:25:14.860 - 00:25:40.070, Speaker F: Is there a particular founder that you guys think that you're not attracting that you would like to attract, but it's just been difficult because of how you position the protocol of how you position what you're looking for. And is there something that you guys think that has been very beneficial to the success that you've had so far in attracting builders?
00:25:42.330 - 00:27:12.790, Speaker C: I mean, I would just say that it's hard as a new founder to attract the resources that are needed to, you know, grow the product further, build the, build the team further. It's hard because you're also competing for mind share, but nobody really knows you. They don't know what. Yeah, like for most people, they don't like, start out with a significant Twitter following or something and then they're building a company from like building a team, building a company from scratch and learning all of the lessons of. Yeah, of creating a startup from nothing, creating culture, figuring out how to hire, figuring out what they can compromise on. Making the first hire is honestly the hardest thing, in my opinion, because you're starting at a time when you have no credibility or resources, you don't really have a lot of money, and then you're trying to get real, the like, absolute best person, because getting that first or second or third really good person on the team then helps set a really high bar, which then makes it easier to recruit more good people. So you're kind of, you know, like you have to figure out what you can compromise on and find a diamond in the rough in some way.
00:27:12.790 - 00:27:50.634, Speaker C: But then also you've never, for most people, like, they've never done that before. So they don't have actually know what to look for either. And I think in traditional tech, the startup journey could last several years before starting to get bigger and raise more money. And the team sizes are quite small in the early days, whereas I feel like in crypto everything is sped run. So people are expecting that you. I don't know, it's just that everything is faster, but the learnings still have to be kind of the same. So the learnings have to happen a.
00:27:50.642 - 00:27:53.426, Speaker D: Lot faster when it comes to founder.
00:27:53.458 - 00:28:44.490, Speaker E: Brand, how much of it, I mean, this question in the most respected, respectable way to you guys, how much of it is because of you and like, what you've done on Twitter and building the community versus like, oh, Monad just raised hundreds of millions of dollars. Therefore Keone is someone we have to follow. Therefore Keone gets a lot of followers, which then gets VC's more excited. There's this kind of virtuous flywheel that happens. And I think Smokey the same could be said with Barachain because you guys are very hyped up, people like you guys. But the tier one VC is invested and it creates this kind of big brand building flywheel, I guess maybe with the audience in mind of a founder of an l one or an l two or an app that hasn't really taken off as much. What would your advice be to them to do, like, both brand building and founder brand building?
00:28:45.550 - 00:29:02.134, Speaker A: Yeah, I think a lot of it comes down to just having something to believe in. I know that sounds kind of corny, but I believe that there's a non trivial element of truth there. And going back to a little bit of what Keanu was saying, I think that there's very much something to be said about like attracts like.
00:29:02.222 - 00:29:02.446, Speaker B: Right?
00:29:02.478 - 00:29:12.172, Speaker A: It's one of the oldest laws in chemistry, but it's also one of those things where I, you know, good talent attracts good talent. Differentiated, interesting creative builders. Attract differentiated, interesting creative builders.
00:29:12.236 - 00:29:12.844, Speaker B: Right?
00:29:13.012 - 00:29:24.444, Speaker A: And I also do think that the space is so small at the moment in terms of, like, actual vetted leads or addressable market, in terms of people who are actively using crypto knowledgeably on a day to day basis and people.
00:29:24.492 - 00:29:26.052, Speaker B: Who are actively trying to build in.
00:29:26.076 - 00:30:04.050, Speaker A: Crypto, that in many cases, if you think of yourself or your brand, your community, your network as a set of nodes, if you do have a few strong nodes, whether that's people like Santi advocating for us or other friends spreading the good word, it sort of ends up getting in a lot of the right places at the right times. I think of it as those branching network effects, and a lot of it does come back to that brand. Like you were saying. I think on one hand, definitely the hype cycle plays into it and people are like, oh my God, lots of VC money raised is something. Something. Airdrop, yahoo. Let's go farm the shit out of this and engage and do our best to find free money.
00:30:04.050 - 00:30:24.722, Speaker A: I also think that more recently, it's definitely created an angrier faction, if you will, of folks who are like, oh, scam VC chain. Like bad. Like, you know, money bad. Go away, I hate you. VC's are going to dump on me. And I understand that too, right? I don't think it's like an irrational viewpoint. I also do think that that comes from a history of, like, lots of.
00:30:24.746 - 00:30:25.698, Speaker B: L1 s that have raised an.
00:30:25.714 - 00:30:45.868, Speaker A: Unholy amount of money, or l two s for that matter, and then ended up with like a ghost chain and a pretty dead ecosystem with nothing for these users to actually engage in. So I understand, like, the PTSD there. So when I go back to your actual question there, like, you know, founder, brand building, community brand building, I think it's giving people something to believe in that is real and backing it up.
00:30:45.884 - 00:30:48.140, Speaker B: With evidence and empirical facts. Right.
00:30:48.260 - 00:31:11.204, Speaker A: It's not just, hey, look at this ecosystem. I promise there's so many sick builders here. I promise it's going to be great. Like, you don't want to sound like a Soundcloud rapper. You want to be able to demonstrate, like, proof of shit being done right. I think that's why, for us, we do our best to really help support projects that are building stuff that we think have a chance at adoption. And it's so funny, especially with this consumer crypto wave that's happened recently.
00:31:11.204 - 00:31:46.836, Speaker A: It's like people suddenly woke up and realized that we need things that people want to use, which maybe seems a little bit more logical on its face and incredibly obvious that. I'm just like. It's almost insane to me that we're calling a consumer crypto when it's just like, okay, crypto that people want to use in some manner. And I think that being able to help encourage more products that ultimately solve a problem or, like, make people's lives better in some manner and then showing how that translates back to your brand or your community, that sort of helped enable that in the first place is kind of the way to go about it.
00:31:46.868 - 00:31:47.036, Speaker B: Right?
00:31:47.068 - 00:31:57.292, Speaker A: It's like, how do you become the melting pot or, like, that. That launch pad that cool things come out of? And I think that certain communities and certain ecosystems have, like, temporarily captured that.
00:31:57.316 - 00:31:58.460, Speaker B: Lightning in the bottle in the past.
00:31:58.500 - 00:32:03.984, Speaker A: Like, I think there was one point to which you would see cool new stuff living on arbitrum to start.
00:32:04.032 - 00:32:04.168, Speaker B: Right?
00:32:04.184 - 00:32:16.584, Speaker A: And that was just, like, the playground. That was the test ground. That was where all the cool new, like, spicy ideas came out of. I think we're seeing a whole bunch of it on base right now. I think the bigger question is, how do you keep momentum? How do you maintain inertia, and how.
00:32:16.592 - 00:32:17.976, Speaker B: Do you keep that ball rolling such.
00:32:18.008 - 00:32:24.184, Speaker A: That it isn't like a six month flash in a pan, but rather it's something that, you know, has a continuous.
00:32:24.232 - 00:32:25.824, Speaker B: Stream of hits, one after the other.
00:32:25.872 - 00:32:29.320, Speaker A: After the other, and maintains attention. Like Hyundai effectively mentioned earlier.
00:32:29.400 - 00:32:30.020, Speaker B: Right.
00:32:30.710 - 00:32:46.814, Speaker A: So I think that it comes down to authenticity, I think it comes down to clear messaging, and I think it comes down to evidence that the work is being done, because I think that there's a lot of people who yell from rooftops or look at my X or Y partnership. But I ultimately think that the applications.
00:32:46.942 - 00:32:48.342, Speaker B: And the numbers and the users tend.
00:32:48.366 - 00:32:49.574, Speaker A: To tell the real story.
00:32:49.742 - 00:34:15.584, Speaker F: Yeah. From my perspective, the three startups that I've invested in the berataindeen ecosystem, I asked him, why are you building on bear chain? And I think all of them seem to appreciate the novelty of proof of liquidity and how that can be pretty interesting from a yield standpoint and just alignment standpoint. Similarly, I think for Monad, I've met a few startups that are building there, and they seem to appreciate kind of the benefits of Moderna, even though there are other, perhaps competitors around this parallelization kind of concept. And the biggest question that I ask is, like, why not go and build on Solana? You're taking for both of these chains, you're taking timing risk, right? This might be a next cycle kind of thing you could be building in Solana today. There's a particular startup that you introduced me to, Keoney, that, like, has was building on Solana and decided to just, you know, take the risk and build on Monad. So I'm curious, you know, for you guys, like, how much of the positioning is we're different from Ethereum in this way and we're different than Solana in this way, or how much of it is. This is what we stand for.
00:34:15.584 - 00:34:44.690, Speaker F: Because a lot of times you can. You can, like, attract people that have been perhaps frustrated in certain other environments and say we're different by being, you know, I guess, like, differentiation by, like, you know, telling people what you don't stand for versus something that you're just truly kind of, you know, novel in some ways, like, contrarian for the sake of being contrarian versus, like, standing on something very unique.
00:34:45.319 - 00:35:42.904, Speaker C: So going backward to something earlier that you said, which I think is a question about differentiation and brand and founder brand, there's a lot of value in getting people's attention maybe being a little bit more controversial. And that's never really been my approach. It's always just been trying to give, like, you know, say what I think and just have be like, sort of common sense driven and then also stay out of it. Like, if I don't have a unique opinion. So there is, you know, one thing that happens is, like, basically crypto Twitter is like, you know, it is a little bit of, you know, to a certain extent, it's for entertainment. Like, it's a, it's how we all keep up with what's going on. But there's a competition for attention and something will happen.
00:35:42.904 - 00:36:52.864, Speaker C: And then immediately there's a whole bunch of posts or threads or whatever about in response to that. And there's sort of a strategy for growing one's Twitter account, which is to immediately go respond to that with something. And I've just never personally wanted to do that because unless I had a really unique take or something that actually made me laugh and I'm not that funny, so I can't, can't really do that. So I think that, at least for me, it's just about trying to share unique insights when I have them. And as I've had gotten more and more experience building a startup and so on, then I do have something that I can share with other people that I think would be valuable. And so I try to, like, tweet more about that, share more about that. But no matter where one is in their startup journey and no matter how well known one's project is, there's always still an opportunity to grow the snowball a little bit and have the virtuous cycle going.
00:36:52.864 - 00:37:40.400, Speaker C: It won't necessarily always be going at the speed at which the Monad community or the Monads repute grew right after a fundraise, for example. But if you're constantly making progress, then every now and then you get a boost. It's like in Mario Kart where you go through the little booster square and then you get a boost. And if you're doing the right things, if you have the right principles, then when you go through that boost, you are really able to take advantage of it. So all that is just to say, like, I'm not, I think it's possible to overthink it also, there's so many other things going on. Like, there's, you know, we're posting on Twitter, but we're also trying to grow our teams. We're also, like, working on product.
00:37:40.400 - 00:38:21.026, Speaker C: We're also, like, strategizing around a lot of other things that are going on. So it's possible to over index on, like, the brand building. And I think it's better to just sort of do something that's natural, that is, like, consistent with who we really are. And then, you know, like, people tend to respect authenticity. And if anything, like, the thing to tweak would just be, like, the frequency of tweeting because, like, if you're not sharing anything, the people can't really respond to that. So that, that's, like, the only thing that I would say is, like, an intentional, like, just try to, like, push the button a little bit more maybe.
00:38:21.058 - 00:39:01.250, Speaker E: Let'S shift a little from brand to bd for a second. There's a big BD week on Twitter this week. Smokey, I think I'll throw this first question to you. There's a high level, esoteric conversation you can have about what BD means, but can you actually go really micro and as tactical as possible? I'd love to hear just how Barachain thinks about BD. You guys hired that guy Jack, who's great, obviously, and, like. Like, what is he doing on a daily basis? What are you doing on a daily basis? Are you, like, cold dming people that you find on GitHub? Are you cold dming founders of projects and other ecosystems that might not be, like, be doing as well? Like, like, what do you actually. What.
00:39:01.250 - 00:39:04.670, Speaker E: What is BD inside of one of these big l ones?
00:39:05.370 - 00:39:18.142, Speaker A: That's a. That's a fun one, man. Yeah. It's been a big week for the BD guys on Twitter. They're having a moment. And just to preface this, I think my take. And I yapped into the void on Twitter about this yesterday.
00:39:18.142 - 00:39:47.134, Speaker A: It's mostly all bullshit right now, if you ask me. And I just simply say that because I've seen a lot of cases in the past look at the blast ecosystem, where there are a whole bunch of people who are like, yep, can't wait to do this on blast. Can't wait to go live. Token price cratered. Half the teams are dipping to other chains. There's literally the meme coin of the ecosystem. Gwen Islanade, you know, shit happens at launch, right? So I think that on one hand, you can make the very best plans on launch and on having a strong ecosystem, but there's also a world in which you get punched in the face despite best efforts.
00:39:47.134 - 00:39:52.422, Speaker A: If the market says, like, fuck this. Now, I think the more productive viewpoint there is, if you do a good.
00:39:52.446 - 00:39:54.342, Speaker B: Enough job, the market shouldn't punch you in the face.
00:39:54.406 - 00:40:20.796, Speaker A: But, you know, macros, macros. So I try to be self aware on that front. In terms of the work that we do on the BD team, I think that there's a few different angles. I think that the focus, number one, is always, you know, trying to identify projects that have something, you know, incredible going for them, something that really breaks the mold. On one hand, sometimes that is just a founder that just absolutely has that dog in them. And, like, you know, that no matter what they do, they'll, you know, run through walls. Not to be corny, but they'll just.
00:40:20.796 - 00:40:26.924, Speaker A: They'll just do what it takes to win. And those are very few and far in between. But I think when you find them, you know, you bet on them and.
00:40:26.932 - 00:40:28.012, Speaker B: You do everything you can to help.
00:40:28.036 - 00:40:39.374, Speaker A: Them win and enable them, right? Not in an unfair manner, but just like, if there's things that you can teach them, if there's knowledge you can impart, if there's introductions you can make for them, you do what you can there, right? On the other hand, sometimes there are.
00:40:39.382 - 00:40:41.790, Speaker B: Just amazing ideas that require refinement.
00:40:41.910 - 00:41:24.354, Speaker A: And it's like, okay, you guys have a lot of the right pieces of the puzzle here and you have the right skeleton, but you just need to like rearrange a little bit to make it actually able to walk. And that's another thing that I think we spend a lot of time doing. It's like, hey, this product actually has great legs, but I don't think you're telling the story correctly. Here's some way that, you know, it might be a little bit easier for people to rock it. So I wouldn't say that it's as much like cold calling and Dming. I think at this point, luckily the team is pretty well networked and, and has a way of getting to a lot of different folks. It's on one hand talking to our different investors and our different friends and community members and saying, hey, what's cool stuff you're seeing? What do we think would fit nicely in the ecosystem nowadays with like a couple hundred projects and change building in.
00:41:24.362 - 00:41:25.266, Speaker B: The bear chain ecosystem?
00:41:25.298 - 00:41:29.722, Speaker A: There's a lot of flywheels forming there by themselves and folks saying, hey, my.
00:41:29.746 - 00:41:30.922, Speaker B: Friend heard that I was building here.
00:41:30.946 - 00:41:41.942, Speaker A: And I want to come build here as well. We're live on testnet. Can you guys help us with this or that? Can you help us solve this problem with deployment? So that's part of the equation as well. On the other hand, it's us saying.
00:41:42.046 - 00:41:43.846, Speaker B: In a more opinionated manner, like, hey.
00:41:43.878 - 00:42:52.390, Speaker A: These are a few things that we think can be absolutely massive in the future. How do we get ahead of that? And how do we make sure that there's ideas that represent this concept on bear chain nice and early, right? How do we make sure that we are not simply chasing a narrative, but rather helping to define it ahead of time? And I do think that that even going back to some of your earlier questions, man, is the thing that's super important if you're building a brand, if you're a founder, if you're some early stage team team, it's important to think about how does one not just subscribe to an existing narrative, but how do you actually help craft or create a new narrative and help further the metagame? I think that that becomes really cool, and that's something we try to work with teams on. So how do you tell your story in a manner that's both authentic and new, but not new just for the sake of it, but new because it truly is that. I think that just means that you have to have a very high filter. I think the other side that this really comes down to is thinking about the different aspects of an ecosystem that need to work together well. Bear chain has, of course, a large focus on liquidity. So of course thinking about different ways that there are applications that could bring lots of TVL into the ecosystem.
00:42:52.390 - 00:43:17.902, Speaker A: Even though I don't think TVL is as robust of a metric as it once was in the past, it's a question of how do you make sure there's enough ambient capital floating around to make sure that people are actually able to transact as they desire. And then I think, increasingly, increasingly important. Over the last few months it's been how do you actually think about distribution? There are so many chains that have dozens, perhaps, let's say of applications and.
00:43:17.966 - 00:43:19.686, Speaker B: Maybe hundreds of users, or let's say.
00:43:19.718 - 00:43:21.730, Speaker A: Thousands of users that are there.
00:43:22.110 - 00:43:25.558, Speaker B: That ratio doesn't often end up working out really well. You need to find a way to.
00:43:25.574 - 00:44:21.968, Speaker A: Get your applications, your content, whatever it might be, in the hands of tens, hundreds of thousands of people if there's a chance of stuff actually taking off. So I think we also try to figure out how we can help curate an application ecosystem that has a chance of actually attracting people, whether that is again, good ideas or more seamless user experiences that you can abstraction type approaches. Is it telegram front ends? How do you actually get something to a point where people can use it easily and they want to use it? So on the micro scale, what that really comes down to is having conversations with founders and team members, figuring out what their strategic initiatives are, figuring out what problems they need to solve. Is it, hey, I need a better way to bootstrap my own liquidity in my user base? Is it, hey, my project is running out of steam just from a narrative and thought process point of view. Is that, hey, I'm having trouble raising is it, hey, I don't know how to grow a community?
00:44:22.144 - 00:44:23.072, Speaker B: What can I do here?
00:44:23.096 - 00:44:44.692, Speaker A: What are some things I can try? I think a lot of it is just finding ways to be that concierge or that extension of a team in a manner that isn't short termist. Again, hey, let's just go throw money at you and let's just go like raise a round for you. I think it's a lot more, hey, how can we help teach you guys how to do this for yourselves such that in the future you're just a.
00:44:44.716 - 00:44:46.076, Speaker B: Better team as a result of having.
00:44:46.108 - 00:45:18.902, Speaker A: Worked with bear chain and having just jumped into the ecosystem. And I think when done correctly, especially with the right sorts of concentrated bets, that leads to a lot of loyalty, that leads to a lot of brand affinity, that leads to a lot of people who end up being pretty ride or die. Because I think it's really easy to just say, you're going to do something, or it's really easy to say, hey, we're going to throw some money at you. I think it's a lot harder to say, hey, I'm going to make time and effort to work with you guys on a weekly basis and to check in on this or that, or to review different materials you're putting together and.
00:45:18.926 - 00:45:20.630, Speaker B: To really get your hands dirty and.
00:45:20.710 - 00:45:44.952, Speaker A: Have a vested interest in the success of these different protocols. I think it's also most authentically done when it's not a grift and when you're not like, hey, you should give me some advisor tokens from doing that. Fuck that. Um, if you're helping teams in your ecosystem, you should just be helping teams in your ecosystem. You know, like a chain. I've said this quite a few times, but I really do see a chain as a sum of the apps that are built on top of it. The chain should not be the main character.
00:45:44.952 - 00:45:51.312, Speaker A: You know, maybe that attracts some of the hype in the first place, but at the end of the day, the apps are what matter. Um, and it's our job to give.
00:45:51.336 - 00:45:52.896, Speaker B: Them the best chance of success and.
00:45:52.968 - 00:45:54.808, Speaker A: Actually like making it out the hood, if you will.
00:45:54.864 - 00:45:55.104, Speaker B: Right.
00:45:55.152 - 00:45:58.512, Speaker A: And, um, I think a lot of that just comes down to, to putting.
00:45:58.536 - 00:46:02.096, Speaker B: In that time and effort and there's very few excuses or alternatives for doing.
00:46:02.128 - 00:46:08.900, Speaker A: So, both in the minds of myself and I think many project founders that, you know, want someone who cares about what they're doing.
00:46:11.120 - 00:46:57.822, Speaker D: Hey everyone, Jason here. Just wanted to take a quick break to talk about something exciting in the world of blockchain, the stellar Development foundation is hosting their 6th annual Meridian conference this October, 15 through 17th in line. It's a three day event where the brightest minds in web3 come together to discuss everything from tokenization to defi. If you're a developer builder, policymaker or business leader looking to make an impact in transforming global systems through blockchain? This is your chance to join the conversation. You'll get to network with the forward thinkers who are defining the future of this space. Head over to to meridian dot stellar.org and use the code blockworks pod for early bird pricing.
00:46:57.822 - 00:47:44.416, Speaker D: Now let's get back to today's episode. Hey everyone, we all know that there's a massive shortage of top senior marketers in crypto. We've seen it over and over that teams are constantly struggling to get their go to market done right. That's why we're excited to have partnered up with Renault Partners, the premier go to market advisory firm for early stage crypto teams. They help top founders tell their stories better and build great non technical teams. They advise founders on all things marketing, including tight brand positioning, community building, social media and building a internal teams don't just take it from us, they work with some of the top projects across Solana, Monad Base, and many more. If you're a founder or a VC looking for support for your teams, I highly recommend connecting with them.
00:47:44.416 - 00:48:20.158, Speaker D: Get in touch with their team by heading on over to Renaudh partners.com or giving the co founder Jeff A follow on X. Check out the links in the description below. Hey everyone, wanted to take a second to talk about my prize, the first multiplayer casino where you can watch, chat and play together with your friends and favorite creators.

For a lot of empire listeners, your crypto is not just another number on the screen, it's part of your future. I know Santi and myself feel that way. Our security sponsor of this episode, Harpy, takes this responsibility seriously and is the only wallet security tool that shields users from both on chain threats and sneaky off chain signature attacks. If you've ever been in that situation where you're moving quickly, you approve something on chain, you realize that the address might be a dubious address, or you're really hoping that you could take that back. Harpy has you covered.
00:49:02.034 - 00:49:38.104, Speaker D: Harpy can redirect your assets to your self custody vault, ensuring they remain completely under your control, safe and sound. With Harpy's always on monitoring. You're not just detecting threats, you're actively blocking and recovering compromised assets from malicious transactions before they can even confirm. On Chain Harpy is the only wallet security solution that protected 100% of its users from attacks like the ledger one in Q four, which was an off chain signature attack. So if you're serious about protecting your crypto investments, it's time to make the switch. Secure your wallet for free at Harpy IO, forward slash empire. That's Harpy.
00:49:38.104 - 00:49:44.120, Speaker D: H a r p I e I o. Empire. If you want it to be even easier, just click the link in the show notes.
00:49:46.900 - 00:50:35.780, Speaker F: So a lot of this has been perhaps a more philosophical discussion around culture and, you know, positioning. And I want to, I want you guys to take us into the future. And what is the, what do the apps look like? You know, what does the ecosystem look like in a year from now? What are the breakout kind of apps that people are using? Yeah, I'm curious from your vantage point, if there's anything right now that you're seeing that is being built that you're really excited about and you think is going to really, if you were to survey 100 people that are using the chain, most of them are using x or Y or a few apps. Yeah.
00:50:40.520 - 00:52:20.374, Speaker C: Yeah. I think maybe one, like vision that seems pretty clear in my head, is like WeChat. Like, if you've ever used WeChat, there's just so many sub apps that are almost embedded within the app, just to name the obvious ones. Like you can order food within WeChat, or you can hire a handyman, or you can get a courier service, or you can just do online shopping, or you can see your friends, social media. There's just so much that you can do all embedded within the super app. And I think that crypto has the potential to basically be the back end for this super app kind of environment because you have embedded payments, like we have a currency system already, we have an account system with that could store any kind of arbitrary data. There's commitment schemes to the data could be potentially compressed or I encrypted stored off chain somewhere, but then the commitment to it is stored on chain so that we have all the pieces, but it's really on us to put the pieces together and create this coherent user experience that is modular, that allows new application developers to plug into that and give a really fast, just like very pleasing and fast user experience.
00:52:20.374 - 00:52:55.690, Speaker C: So I think that when I think about that, it comes down to like the user onboarding the user experience. Mobile is a huge part of it, which is why I actually feel like the blasts pivot to focus on mobile does make sense to me in some way. Of course it's all about execution, but I think that, yeah, just like that would be one very specific vision of the future that I feel has is pretty reasonable to imagine the possibility.
00:52:57.710 - 00:52:59.050, Speaker E: Smokey, what about you?
00:52:59.670 - 00:53:18.798, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that I imagine sort of an infinite playground of sorts, and I think that ideally that playground is as accessible as possible and has little satellite locations in every system or every city, and a very smooth and pleasing user experience for sure, because I think that that's evolving over time and the.
00:53:18.814 - 00:53:20.494, Speaker B: Bar is going higher and higher in.
00:53:20.502 - 00:53:30.838, Speaker A: The space, especially as adoption of stuff like Solana increases and people just get used to that nice snappy user experience, which I think is very important. I think that for us, we've been.
00:53:30.854 - 00:53:32.022, Speaker B: Excited to see a lot of teams.
00:53:32.046 - 00:54:40.038, Speaker A: Just getting a little bit deeper and growing and expanding on testnet and getting to try cool new things. I think that is what I hope for to see continue. I think that I'd love to be able to see the baritone ecosystem as a place where people go to build something cool, new and interesting in a very welcoming environment, and where there's a lot of precedent and scar tissue by their peers who built cool stuff in the past. On one hand, I think the ecosystem is primarily known, or was first known for a pretty heavy defi focus, and I think there's a lot of really cool stuff in the mix over there. Whether that is the gummy guys that allow you to basically borrow anything against anything else, has some very fun experiments with leverage. The concrete dudes who are building credit default swaps on chain, which can be incredibly interesting for a more sophisticated, more traditional finance audience as well, or the guys like exponents who are allowing you for the first time to effectively directionally incentivize leverage trading with different tokens. You can actually use that to really tap into some of the crypto culture and have someone saying, hey, this is mog versus Harry Potter, Obama Sonic ten inu pair.
00:54:40.038 - 00:55:01.214, Speaker A: I'm going to bribe someone to go long on one token and go short on the other, and actually have those mini social games with economic incentives playing out. I think all that's super interesting. I think like I mentioned, consumer has been a bit of a meme, but I'm actually really excited to see some of the stuff that's tapping into the culture and feels correct for bear chain starting to see legs and I want.
00:55:01.222 - 00:55:02.686, Speaker B: To see more and more of those in the future.
00:55:02.758 - 00:55:08.902, Speaker A: So, for example, there's the guys at Puff Paw who Santi knows, and I've.
00:55:08.926 - 00:55:11.090, Speaker F: Invested in three startups you have mentioned.
00:55:13.990 - 00:55:37.542, Speaker A: No, but like, they're amazing, right? These guys are building something that is actually, it's very colloquially seen as vape turn, but it's actually a pretty interesting incentivization mechanism for people to quit smoking over time. And I actually think that is like a superpower of crypto, like beyond even instant settlement and efficiency, which taps into some other apps in the ecosystem. It basically means that one can use.
00:55:37.566 - 00:55:39.848, Speaker B: These token incentives to help enforce certain behaviors.
00:55:39.934 - 00:55:43.060, Speaker A: And I think the core of that is having a product that's good enough.
00:55:43.100 - 00:55:45.356, Speaker B: For people to use without that incentive.
00:55:45.468 - 00:55:50.956, Speaker A: And using that incentive to really turbo it. But in the case of puffball, for example, they actually incentivize people to decrease.
00:55:50.988 - 00:55:52.556, Speaker B: The amount of nicotine they're consuming over.
00:55:52.588 - 00:56:20.282, Speaker A: Time with increasing token rewards, and have a pretty elegant system there. There's guys like over under which I know Santi loves and I'm a big fan of as well, just a founder who very much has that dog in him and is building the kind of abstracted experience that allow people to use computer vision approaches to actually speculate on twitch streams and basically automatically predict odds of various events happening in game from previous trading data. I think stuff like that is super cool because you can basically go and.
00:56:20.426 - 00:56:24.082, Speaker B: Partner with the streamer and start reaching tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands.
00:56:24.106 - 00:56:48.502, Speaker A: And hopefully even millions of people in a very simple way, just with a chrome extension. I think that stuff like that gets really cool because it sets a precedent for more stuff that could actually utilize crypto in a manner that isn't annoying to people and actually have some advantages when it comes settlement yield, earning potentials, et cetera, on chain. So I guess without just doing a massive bear eco shillfest, what I really want to get at is I think.
00:56:48.526 - 00:56:49.726, Speaker B: That we want to see cool new.
00:56:49.758 - 00:57:22.614, Speaker A: Things continue to develop. I think we want to see experiences that truly get to users. I would similarly agree. I think there's exciting stuff happening in mobile. One of the areas that I haven't seen talked about as much, but I actually saw Peter from one KX talking about this on Twitter recently that I think is so untapped, but is really cool. Building products for women, right, like this is maybe like a taboo topic in some cases, or just not discussed that much because I don't think crypto is always the most welcoming space for girls. I think it's been actually really enlightening to like, meet more folks like the bare baddies, because they're actually, they're pretty cool.
00:57:22.614 - 00:57:40.098, Speaker A: They're, they're like sharp, they like what they're doing. They're like, you know, learning more about crypto and having a good time while doing it. And when you think about it, just from like a spending power point of view, from like a purchasing habits point of view, women really do drive that. In the United States and in many other geographies, they're the largest content producers.
00:57:40.154 - 00:57:41.602, Speaker B: In many cases, there are guys that.
00:57:41.626 - 00:57:57.510, Speaker A: Follow them into different habits for various motivations. I think the building apps that the girlies want to use is actually a massively untapped field. And we've got a couple of those starting to cook in the earlier stages. I actually think that building products and.
00:57:58.010 - 00:58:02.906, Speaker B: Airing towards applications that help tap into the increasingly prevalent culture of the Internet.
00:58:02.938 - 00:58:28.230, Speaker A: If you will, while keeping a nod towards cryptos more cypherpunk origins is really important here. I think that's what I hope to see the ecosystem continue doing while just taking advantage of the capital efficiency, the liquidity unlocks, the customer acquisition cost advantages, the proof of liquidity and staying fun. I think that if we stop being fun, then we've lost it all. I think that that's what I want to really make sure we maintain going forward.
00:58:29.500 - 00:59:12.950, Speaker F: We have both of you guys here. Clearly, these two ecosystems along others are great beachheads to attract not just existing builders, but the other builders that haven't bothered to think about crypto, and now they will. At least that's the bet. How do you think about interoperability? Maybe a founder comes in, starts building on Monadheendeh, but ultimately, are you guys actively encouraging or facilitating interoperability to the point where, I mean, at the end of the day, you want the app to be extremely successful, and that may entail building connectivity between other ecosystems.
00:59:15.730 - 01:00:30.814, Speaker C: Yeah, I think I care the most about just seeing the growth of the space of decentralized apps. So for me, that is the single biggest thing. The technology that we've built at Monad, basically building a much bigger pipeline that can support a lot more users, support a lot more transactions. We think that that's an unlock for a lot of users or for a lot of developers that are aspiring to mass user adoption. And if you run the numbers, it doesnt take too many daus from a traditional tech perspective, or that many transactions per user per day from a traditional tech perspective, to end up with a pretty high number of transactions that are needed per day relative to what Ethereum offers right now, which is like a million transactions per day, crazy low. So I think that theres, there's good synergy between certain kinds of applications and the technology that we're working on that we've built. But I actually am most focused on just seeing high quality applications within the space in general.
01:00:30.814 - 01:01:24.750, Speaker C: And then in terms of where people choose to build what they choose as the best backend, that's almost like a secondary consideration to me personally. And so I will do what I can as an individual to like, just share learnings and try to do things that like share information, share learnings that help accelerate the space for all builders without worrying as much about the exact where. So from an interoperability perspective, I think it's great that we have great different bridging solutions that are helping to connect all these different environments. And Monad is an EVM compatible layer one it's actually really easy for developers who built for the EVM to deploy on Monad or to deploy in other environments. There's not a vendor lock in aspect like what Smokey was mentioning earlier.
01:01:28.410 - 01:02:01.530, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. And I guess quickly add on to that from our side. I think it's incredibly important to have effective inroads and outros to an ecosystem. I don't think that one should ever attempt to constrain users. I do think it's important to be able to find a way to keep applications sticky because I do think that that's a meaningful portion of the problems that have plagued a number of other ecosystems. I guess the way that we think about that is in the course of value alignment. Tapping into proof of liquidity is not just necessarily a one click process, but it's hopefully one that can make lives.
01:02:01.570 - 01:02:02.722, Speaker B: Better for a lot of applications.
01:02:02.786 - 01:02:05.466, Speaker A: And we've definitely found it to be one of those tools that sort of.
01:02:05.498 - 01:02:07.242, Speaker B: Answering your original question, Santi has allowed.
01:02:07.266 - 01:02:31.326, Speaker A: Us to get more builders excited because they're like, oh, cool. For the first time, the chain can actually help power my application. It's not me just having a parasitic relationship in some manner. It's this chain actually helping me succeed. So I think that's been really helpful and I think it also does help model a little bit more clearly for folks even coming from our trad development audience, and that they're like, okay, the.
01:02:31.358 - 01:02:32.742, Speaker B: Infrastructure of the base plate that I'm.
01:02:32.766 - 01:02:49.334, Speaker A: Using is improving my experience as a builder, right. So I think that's been quite good to us and I think for the long run, like, it's incredibly important to actually build a welcoming place, but also one that ultimately recognizes some of the power laws that will exist.
01:02:49.422 - 01:02:49.646, Speaker B: Right.
01:02:49.678 - 01:02:56.622, Speaker A: I do think that in almost all ecosystems and in almost all cases to date, there do tend to be these breakout applications.
01:02:56.686 - 01:02:59.622, Speaker B: I think that we should do everything we can to support a wide range.
01:02:59.646 - 01:03:13.982, Speaker A: As possible, but ultimately, you know, I think that striations form within those ecosystems. And you want to be able to make sure that you're supporting every team, but you're not neglecting those that are actually helping to drive a ton of value into the Eco as well as.
01:03:14.006 - 01:03:40.440, Speaker F: A follow up to this point. A lot of. There's. There's some confusion around what success for an application looks like. We talk about mainstream adoption, but Keone, you said something around it doesn't take much. Maybe the user, current user base of crypto is one that skews high purchasing power. So you don't need a million people on chain, you don't need a billion users.
01:03:40.440 - 01:04:06.470, Speaker F: You need maybe thousands, but are more engaged because there are stakeholders in the system or because their purchasing power is higher. What I guess depends on the application. But the question is, what is that? KPI, when you think about breakout success, and how do you define that for the applications being built on the ecosystem?
01:04:08.010 - 01:04:36.100, Speaker C: I would say it's two things. Number one is you have to evaluate the application as a business as well. How, like, to what extent or, sorry. When you're evaluating businesses, there's sort of two things to look for. One is, like, the revenue or more specifically, the profit of the business. And then the other thing is the rate of growth of the business. And, you know, that's how companies are valued in the traditional space.
01:04:36.100 - 01:05:45.324, Speaker C: And while not everything is the same in the crypto space, I think it's a useful framework for. For reference. So I think that the good news is that because the amount of on chain usage is still very, very limited, there are a lot of people that are excited, that love crypto, that think about crypto a lot, but they've never actually set up a wallet. They only just trade crypto on centralized exchanges. There's actually this huge amount of potential energy, potential users that already have, like, some amount of maybe alignment with the values or awareness of the memes or awareness of, like, what's going on that just need to be tapped into and encouraged to come on chain and are just waiting for, like, the right application to really get them going. I think that, you know, from looking back in the past, you know, there were certain applications that, that absolutely went viral, that absolutely had incredible rates of growth of their user base. Axie infinity comes to mind.
01:05:45.324 - 01:06:51.700, Speaker C: Step n comes to mind. Those were like, I think it's fair to say, driven by financial incentives. And the speed on the way up was really aggressive, and the speed on the way down was also really aggressive because there was a bit of element of new users coming and buying. The NFTs then push the price up, which then propels the economy, which then causes more people to want to go jump in there. But it's not like fundamentally sustainable. So I'm not advocating for that rate of that specific mechanic, but I think that you can see that when there is opportunity, when there is something that really goes viral, you can see an incredibly fast growth and there's just so much potential. It's really just about having that application that has inherent value, that offers inherent value to the end user so that they keep coming back rather than being purely motivated by some sort of temporary incentive or temporary condition that maybe logic would dictate is not really going to last.
01:06:53.480 - 01:07:00.940, Speaker E: I'm curious if your guys answers overlap here. Smokey and Keone, who are the three chains that you guys end up competing with the most?
01:07:01.280 - 01:07:01.640, Speaker A: What?
01:07:01.680 - 01:07:03.780, Speaker F: But you got to let Smokey answer my question.
01:07:05.120 - 01:07:07.340, Speaker E: Go off, Smokey. Go off, Smokey.
01:07:08.040 - 01:07:12.020, Speaker F: You know what? You'd think that Yano and I would get better over time.
01:07:13.680 - 01:07:15.992, Speaker C: We got to deal with on a daily basis.
01:07:16.136 - 01:07:27.424, Speaker E: Check the YouTube comments. We got to check the YouTube comments here. Everyone's got to go on YouTube and say, who's a better host this episode, Santi or me? That's the real album. Smokey, go ahead.
01:07:27.472 - 01:07:27.656, Speaker C: Question.
01:07:27.688 - 01:07:29.210, Speaker F: We know the answer that the patient.
01:07:29.250 - 01:07:53.710, Speaker A: Of a saint over here. I think that I would agree with a lot of what Keone said. I'd also add a couple more things in there. So on one hand, yeah. Can it stand on its own feet or does the application get inflated, emitted to death without weird additional incentives? That's one thing for sure. Can it be cash flow positive? Very few apps in crypto are. I think part of the reason that everyone's hyped over pump fun is because they're like, oh, this makes money.
01:07:53.710 - 01:08:20.886, Speaker A: Part of the reason people were hyped over opensea in the past. Like, oh, this makes money right now. Notably, no token for either of those. So it becomes a bit different when that dynamic is added. But that's 100% part of it. On the other hand, I also think about total number of users because, Santa, you're quite right in that there's right now a very heavy skew towards more enriched users. But I also do think that if crypto is ever to not be a weird thing, and if it's not to be a thing, where it just, uh.
01:08:20.918 - 01:08:22.718, Speaker B: Here'S a bunch of grifts and here's a meme coin.
01:08:22.814 - 01:08:49.560, Speaker A: Not. The meme coins are bad. Like, I think you do need stuff that like, you know, lay people can use and people actually care about if they have a couple hundred dollars or $1,000 in their bank account or whatever it might be. Um, I do think that becomes, you know, especially interesting for emerging markets. And I was actually recently talking to a builder from Nigeria who was like, literally, if you go to the gas stations, if you go to like, you know, train stations, if you go to like, anywhere in public malls, people are just clicking with, playing these tap to earn Telegram games non stop. And he wanted to find a way to get those two to trigger like.
01:08:49.600 - 01:08:51.800, Speaker B: Backend actions on different, like, smart contract.
01:08:51.880 - 01:09:22.995, Speaker A: Or on different apps. And I was like, that's pretty funny. Anyway, I think that we do need to be able to, like, skew towards things that actually have a chance of getting more than a small subset of users and that aren't just whale games. I think two more things I'd add in. There are one, like the user experience, like, you know, just the feel of that application. Is it something that's really easy for people to onboard and get to use? You know, like, I think the moonshot app on Solana recently is an interesting thing there, right? Like a Robin Hood for meme coins kind thing. And then I think another thing is like, how much of a fundamental base plate is it within an ecosystem, right? I think, like, GMX is a pretty good example of this.
01:09:22.995 - 01:10:04.340, Speaker A: Within the arb ecosystem, you had a ton of people building products around that, right? Whether that was like delta neutral volts or leverage products, or means of like borrowing against different primitives, etcetera. I think all that becomes quite important at scale. So really, like, how embedded or how much of like a foundational piece of an ecosystem is this, actually? And then, Jana, for your question, man, which change do I think we compete against most? I guess. I'm sure there'll be competition between us and Monad. Obviously, I think we address different user groups, but EVM identical EVM compatible chains, I think people will look to that. And lots of recent activity. I think that base is very much in the mix.
01:10:04.340 - 01:10:13.104, Speaker A: More recently, I think that there is a pretty thriving consumer, user facing ecosystem there. There's interesting DeFi projects, experiments being there.
01:10:13.152 - 01:10:15.808, Speaker B: It very much feels to me like where arbitrum was a couple of years.
01:10:15.824 - 01:10:50.730, Speaker A: Ago, but with a better shot at distribution and better brand value in that sense. Not to look down on ARB, to be clear. Just saying where I think a lot of the attention's at, and I think hyper Liquid's also interesting. I think that they have a very strong community based group who's like, hey, this has no vc funding. This is a good product. There's a lot of excitement around what they're building, and I believe they're accepting that into and EVM environment as well. I'm not sure exactly what the interplay between the core hyper liquid infrastructure and that EVM will look like, but I expect that there will be cool stuff being built there and that there'll be some cool competition to see.
01:10:53.830 - 01:11:11.420, Speaker C: Yeah. And I would echo what Smokey said. I think from my perspective, it would be base Solana, and perhaps blast, although it depends a little bit on the timing there.
01:11:12.080 - 01:11:13.140, Speaker E: That's interesting.
01:11:15.160 - 01:11:20.660, Speaker C: I think in the past, it was a little bit more of a, yeah, there's a little bit more overlap.
01:11:21.240 - 01:12:04.136, Speaker F: Mm hmm. I recently saw this is a great tweet by one of the pretty involved Solana investors out there and says, like, most of the first batch of apps in that ecosystem, like, are no longer around and are not the breakout apps that you're seeing today. Like, the pre FTX apps were, like, very few of them still have any decent traction today. Most of the best apps came after this kind of traumatic, hardening, defining moment for the chain. That's true for Solana. For Ethereum, it's different. You had a lot of ICO projects, went through this boom bust, and then reemergence in some ways changed a lot.
01:12:04.136 - 01:12:37.970, Speaker F: Like aves of the world, for instance. Anything that you guys are paying attention to prior kind of observing the evolution of an ecosystem like Ethereum or Solana. And I guess if any lessons learned from perhaps those two projects or others that you're taking to heart, and then you're kind of making sure you avoid certain mistakes. I call them mistakes, but just like, lessons learned, I guess.
01:12:38.670 - 01:12:44.334, Speaker A: Yeah. I think one thing that comes to mind really quickly, and this is something that I discussed, I can't remember if.
01:12:44.342 - 01:12:45.650, Speaker B: It was on a pod or where.
01:12:46.430 - 01:13:18.824, Speaker A: But I think that almost every major ecosystem has had, like, a, that stood the test of time, has had some massive trauma bonding experience. Like some point where shit hits the fan and everything goes wrong and everyone's like, holy shit, is it all over? Bitcoin had mount Gox, Ethereum had the Dow hack, Solana had FTX. I think those all were craters in their own respects. But I think that that actually serves as a very interesting culling moment where the people that survive and the apps that continue doubling down are that much more locked in. In.
01:13:18.872 - 01:13:19.056, Speaker B: Right.
01:13:19.088 - 01:13:50.720, Speaker A: And they're that much more like hell bent and fully, I'd say, aligned with whatever is being built and also tends to be a good learning experience and endpoint for change going forward. I think that for us, I've been thinking a lot about that. On one hand, it's simply perhaps been how long people have been waiting for bear chain in some cases. On the other hand, I think we've certainly seen shit in the market over the last little while that isn't necessarily barachain specific, but it has, that has had ripple effects. But I think that, like, whether we've had that trauma bonding moment or not, I actually think that that's an event.
01:13:50.760 - 01:13:51.832, Speaker B: I will look forward to in the.
01:13:51.856 - 01:13:56.136, Speaker A: Future if, you know, if it hasn't already happened. Because I think that that means that.
01:13:56.208 - 01:13:58.376, Speaker B: Whoever, like the crowd that remains after.
01:13:58.448 - 01:14:15.998, Speaker A: You know, getting gut punched is an exceptionally, you know, strong crowd. Right. I like to make fun of Cosmo Adamaton because I just think it's like a very problematic ecosystem. But I can't deny the fact that there's a number of diehards that no matter how many times Cosmos gets punched in the face, they don't care. They're like, they're there to ride.
01:14:16.054 - 01:14:16.486, Speaker B: Right.
01:14:16.598 - 01:14:43.288, Speaker A: And I have begrudging respect for that. I think that one of the other things to think about from the soul versus eth and just sort of these ecosystems over time is the importance of strong hands up on product leadership and focus on building something that is pleasant for people to use. And I think that this has happened in a couple of different ways on ETh. I think we think about the scaling roadmap, I think about zks over time. I think a lot of things that have excited people technically, but may not.
01:14:43.304 - 01:14:44.912, Speaker B: Have always borne fruit in the manner.
01:14:44.936 - 01:14:55.528, Speaker A: In which they thought. Even right now, there's lots of conversations about, okay, l two s scale eth, but are they actually parasitic to the chain itself, etcetera? Like, what does that look like? And we think about this as well.
01:14:55.584 - 01:14:56.752, Speaker B: As like a number of groups look.
01:14:56.776 - 01:15:20.220, Speaker A: To build, you know, roll ups or Altus Tabera, because with the full EVM identical environment that has like an unmodified execution client, you can deploy op stack roll ups, ARB orbit orbit roll ups, whatever it is. To baritone without having to do anything different. And we think about how you actually secure effective relationships between an l one and an l two. And we've got some kind of cool.
01:15:20.260 - 01:15:21.924, Speaker B: Ideas brewing over there that might allow.
01:15:21.972 - 01:15:27.364, Speaker A: For some stuff that taps very uniquely into proof of liquidity, and how an l two can actually play a role.
01:15:27.412 - 01:15:28.628, Speaker B: Or its token can play a role.
01:15:28.684 - 01:15:32.400, Speaker A: In block rewards and the block building process on bear chain that we think will be quite cool.
01:15:33.270 - 01:15:34.542, Speaker B: On the other hand, I think that.
01:15:34.566 - 01:16:06.132, Speaker A: Like, there's been complaints or concerns in many cases over, you know, a lack of direct leadership or product focused vision on the e side, despite having a massive and very difficult roadmap. Whereas I think the one thing I've always seen within Solana has been like a relative relentless, like, engineering focus, like, you know, not. And I think that there's a balance that needs to be struck between, you know, effective ethos of decentralization and building something that is actually, you know, correctly distributed and is effectively decentralized versus decentralizing.
01:16:06.156 - 01:16:07.556, Speaker B: To the point at which, you know, it's.
01:16:07.588 - 01:16:13.404, Speaker A: It's easier to lose path and to not have, you know, a force that is clearly pushing things forward.
01:16:13.532 - 01:16:15.460, Speaker B: And then there's always vocal members within.
01:16:15.500 - 01:16:42.654, Speaker A: Those groups and, sorry, that'd be the last thing, is I think that, like, another example, this is chainlink back in the day, and I make reference to these guys relatively often, you find this set of folks in your community who just become the loudspeakers for their voices, if you will. They become their advocates in some manner. I think Mert is a very famous example and a classic guy who does that for Solana. He obviously is friends with the foundation, but he speaks his mind and says what he thinks about the path of.
01:16:42.662 - 01:16:43.890, Speaker B: The product going forward.
01:16:44.710 - 01:16:48.094, Speaker A: I think that having that network of a few folks in the community who.
01:16:48.102 - 01:16:49.542, Speaker B: Are really not afraid to say what.
01:16:49.566 - 01:17:01.540, Speaker A: Needs to be said is also really important to curate and to create a safe space for them to say things because you don't want it to fall on deaf ears, but you also don't want, like, a, you know, a full community takeover of a project, if you will.
01:17:04.600 - 01:17:06.100, Speaker F: Keone, anything to add?
01:17:07.280 - 01:18:38.536, Speaker C: Yeah, I think regarding the. The trauma, bonding, I mean, crypto definitely seems to go in cycles. And I think for any startup founder that's really ambitious, has a really big vision, it's going to be a multi year build that almost certainly will go through a period where crypto is almost universally questioned and where it's tough to tell your partner's parents what you work on. Or inevitably, there's going to be tough times for the industry or maybe where the reputation isn't as great and where it's harder to hire from outside of crypto and so on. So I think that to the point about Solana and the builders trauma bonding during the post FTX really tough period, I can definitely see that. I can also see that it was just like that bear market period was a time when the builders that were building really ambitious things were mostly like just building, because it does take time to build things. And so it's almost like not the, you know, it obviously makes it difficult, much harder to attract resources, but like, you also just need that period of time to go and realize the vision.
01:18:38.536 - 01:19:28.112, Speaker C: And so one thing that I, I think would be good to be better understood in the space is just the amount of time it takes to build something that is really trying to push the limits of whats possible from an application perspective. We should reset our expectations a little bit instead of being like, okay, well, project started. Theyre going to be launched in six months and fully deployed in a year. It might take longer. In the traditional tech space, the expectation is much longer for how long it takes to build things. And I think if we want really great apps, then we should set our expectations longer and we should almost know during that time that there are going to be periods that are really tough.
01:19:28.256 - 01:19:29.100, Speaker A: Mm hmm.
01:19:30.080 - 01:20:20.078, Speaker F: My last question, I know Jano has another one, is around this idea of price and tokens. Tokens, while they are phenomenal coordination mechanisms, they're also the way that you map contributions in this open source world. And they're great. They can be great mechanisms to layer incentives and acquire customers. On the other hand, they can be very distracting. They can really, when it's a down only because the markets, we're in a bear market, it can lead to this huge disillusionment, to the point where people leave and don't want to come back. How do you think about that? Is that something that you can control or you can at least guide teams to say, hey, to your point, Smokey, you guys have been around for a while.
01:20:20.078 - 01:20:50.158, Speaker F: You don't have a token in many ways. Perhaps other chains are a bit more eager to launch a token. I don't know if there's a good answer or perfect answer to this. I guess it depends on market environment. Some people say launching the bottom of the bear, but you don't maybe have that luxury. Right. But I am curious specifically for the apps that are building on the ecosystem, how do you think about tokens and price being in that relationship, are we? Perhaps.
01:20:50.158 - 01:21:23.730, Speaker F: But are projects launching tokens too early? Because in traditional startup land you have many years of traction and building, and then you ipO. I'm curious what your thoughts are there, because once you have a token, it's a whole new game dimension that you have to think about as a builder, and that could be both really good but also really bad.
01:21:24.110 - 01:22:02.582, Speaker A: I think that you can't control price. Price does its own thing, the token does its own thing. It is in many cases almost famously separate from the product, which is cursed in its own way. I really do think that the best thing that one can do for the health of your token price, et cetera, is build a good project. I don't think that's rocket science, and there's many different interpretations of what a good project is, but I think something that's easy for people to use, something that's accessible and something that has good people building on it, that it can ultimately help bring value back home, if you will. I think the other thing, when it comes to actually projects launching tokens, I.
01:22:02.606 - 01:22:03.782, Speaker B: Tend to agree with you there Asanti.
01:22:03.806 - 01:22:23.218, Speaker A: In that I don't know. I come from a trad tech tradup world and it's incredibly odd to have this set of incentives where it's like, yes, you IPO as you start building the company, or a couple months or if months or maybe a year into building the company, and then the open market is really what decides your fate in many ways after that. I think a lot of it also.
01:22:23.274 - 01:22:25.266, Speaker B: Does come down to vesting structures, which.
01:22:25.298 - 01:22:40.554, Speaker A: I do imagine at some point are due for some sort of a spicy overhaul. I was talking to someone recently about how I actually think that right now certain meme coin projects probably have the best vesting structures that I've seen, as cursed as that is to say, and.
01:22:40.562 - 01:22:42.274, Speaker B: That they're actually more tied to certain.
01:22:42.322 - 01:22:47.582, Speaker A: KPI's, whether that is the amount of fees generated by Xylp, whether that is.
01:22:47.606 - 01:22:50.414, Speaker B: The amount of market cap, the market cap, or the FTV of a given.
01:22:50.462 - 01:23:02.758, Speaker A: Token, and they'll basically have it set up such that people who have invested, they get out over time versus based on the project's success. And I'm defining success broadly here, but.
01:23:02.774 - 01:23:05.130, Speaker B: I'm correlating it to price action in this case.
01:23:06.470 - 01:23:07.662, Speaker A: On one hand, I can see that.
01:23:07.686 - 01:23:09.494, Speaker B: Being more problematic for different funds that.
01:23:09.502 - 01:23:13.702, Speaker A: Are thinking about return time frames and the predictability for their lp's and what.
01:23:13.726 - 01:23:15.942, Speaker B: They can take management fees on, et cetera, et cetera.
01:23:16.046 - 01:23:45.968, Speaker A: On the other hand, I can see it as something that might actually be more healthy for the world in a long term scenario where it's like, hey, in order for one to hit this unlock, this project actually has to have continued growing in some manner. Do I think that's a perfect solution? No, far from it. I just think of it as a potential alternative in this weird world of vesting. I think ideally a token is, is an accelerant or something that allows some that has already hit a degree of product market fit to continue driving said product market fit.
01:23:46.144 - 01:23:48.728, Speaker B: Of course, for us as l one s, it's a little bit different and.
01:23:48.744 - 01:23:59.848, Speaker A: You kind of need those for gas and the utility of that, if you will. But I think in the case of many applications, they end up being to some extent a user acquisition tool, on.
01:23:59.864 - 01:24:02.816, Speaker B: The other extent a sentiment acquisition tool.
01:24:03.008 - 01:24:06.656, Speaker A: And I think that the former narrative has been played out more than the latter.
01:24:06.808 - 01:24:08.656, Speaker B: I think the latter is ultimately almost.
01:24:08.728 - 01:24:15.512, Speaker A: More important, as in, like, I think that the acquisition cost per projects with tokens is actually famously quite high.
01:24:15.576 - 01:24:15.776, Speaker B: Right?
01:24:15.808 - 01:24:45.458, Speaker A: Like, you're paying like, you know, hundreds of dollars or thousands of dollars in tokens for a single user, which is like, kind of insane when you consider that from like a CAC to LTV ratio in trad businesses, right? But what I do think is valuable and what I think can be, you know, thoughtfully engineered, is how you can actually design a token release schedule or an airdrop or distribution event that rewards the right people, is targeted around that effectively has well vetted leads, as opposed to just spraying a whole bunch of.
01:24:45.474 - 01:24:46.978, Speaker B: Tokens into the abyss and hoping that.
01:24:46.994 - 01:24:51.986, Speaker A: A few people want to start playing with it after. I think that pre vetting that audience.
01:24:52.058 - 01:24:53.474, Speaker B: And then finding a way to actually.
01:24:53.522 - 01:25:01.484, Speaker A: Ensure that you're awarding the people who have contributed the most is super important and can maybe turn those sorts of, like, you know, token distribution events and.
01:25:01.572 - 01:25:03.108, Speaker B: The existence of a token into a.
01:25:03.124 - 01:25:10.120, Speaker A: More useful thing for a product than just like, oh, man, charts up, charts big down, right? And riding that wave.
01:25:10.700 - 01:25:13.080, Speaker E: Smokey, how's your, how's your lifting game these days?
01:25:13.460 - 01:25:18.920, Speaker A: You know what, man? Travel has been. Been less than ideal, but it's good. I'm in, I'm in decent shape.
01:25:19.220 - 01:25:20.720, Speaker E: Setting the bar low for.
01:25:23.020 - 01:25:36.970, Speaker F: I think. Smokey, I saw a tweet of your, like, these oversized shirts I've started. Yeah, Yana said that I can't lift. I mean, but fine. Like, so I wear these oversized shirts to hide the lack of muscle.
01:25:38.750 - 01:25:51.798, Speaker A: That's what I'm going for. These days, they're. They're just very cozy. And that way, like, you know, I never like being that you never want to be that dude in the gym, or I don't like being that dude in the gym and, like, the tank top. I would rather be the dude, like, the oversized hoodie who, like, you know.
01:25:51.854 - 01:25:52.982, Speaker B: Hopefully pushes some good weight.
01:25:53.006 - 01:25:55.050, Speaker A: And then people like, whoa, what's going on over there?
01:25:55.380 - 01:26:07.812, Speaker F: You know, you can't even wear a tank top. And out here they're like, really? No, you're gonna wear a polo shirt. That's why I'm blaming it.
01:26:07.996 - 01:26:08.760, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:26:09.140 - 01:26:11.668, Speaker F: All right, guys, this is great discussion. Yeah.
01:26:11.764 - 01:26:15.156, Speaker E: Yeah, Smokey. Thanks, Keoni. Thank you. Appreciate it.
01:26:15.308 - 01:26:16.560, Speaker A: Thanks for having us, man.
