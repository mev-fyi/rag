00:00:00.320 - 00:00:48.070, Speaker A: This episode is brought to you by Paraswap, the leading aggregator to find best prices across various Dexs. You'll hear more about them later in the show. Welcome back to another episode of Empire. Today we are joined by the B Lister, Mister Mike Ippolito, my co founder at Blockworks, Zondiago Santiago, is taking a break from the pod for the day. Now, he had a couple of board meetings to attend to, so Mike is. Mike is stepping in. And today we are very lucky to be joined by Jeff Dorman, the CIO at Orca, one of the most respected funds in the space, but really just Jeff is, in my opinion, one of the most respected and thoughtful and often contrarian investors in all of crypto.
00:00:48.070 - 00:01:02.612, Speaker A: He spent about 15 years, maybe a little longer, on Wall Street, I think, at Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers, Citadel, and then joined Arca back in 2018, and has just been leading the charge for crypto investing since then. So, Jeff, welcome to Empire, my friend.
00:01:02.708 - 00:01:10.244, Speaker B: Thanks for having me, and thanks. I got a much more ceremonial intro than just being called a b lister, so I appreciate that. That was nice.
00:01:10.364 - 00:01:15.020, Speaker C: Of all the monikers that Jason has given me over the years, b list is one of the kinder ones, so I'll take it.
00:01:15.052 - 00:01:23.124, Speaker A: Yeah, you should see what I call them on when we're not recording here, Jeff. So, awesome. Jeff, can you see this? Can you see this chart here?
00:01:23.244 - 00:01:23.972, Speaker B: Yes.
00:01:24.148 - 00:01:41.708, Speaker A: Awesome. So this is what I want to jump into first. We just had Travis Kling on the podcast, and this was one of the big topics that we talked about, is just the correlation between bitcoin and the Nasdaq. Right now, there's about a 95% correlation. If you look back over the last couple of months, it's really trading in. Bitcoin is trading in tandem with. With the Nasdaq.
00:01:41.708 - 00:01:46.866, Speaker A: And my first question for you is, just when does this snap? When does this correlation breakaway?
00:01:47.010 - 00:02:22.858, Speaker B: Well, don't forget, I mean, there's a reason that this is so concerning to people, right? It's concerning to people because we've been calling bitcoin an uncorrelated asset for the last five years. So all of a sudden, because for the last four months, it's so highly correlated to the Nasdaq, people are freaking out. But the reality is, you could have had these exact same conversation five different times with five different assets over the last five years. You could have run the same chart versus the US dollar three years ago. You could have run it versus the chinese yuan two years ago. You could have run it versus gold four years ago, the definition of an uncorrelated as it is that the correlations are not consistent. And that's the same thing today.
00:02:22.858 - 00:03:15.294, Speaker B: Just because we have a high consistency with the Nasdaq right now, that also is not a consistent relationship, because that wasn't the case five months ago, two years ago, four years ago, it will eventually break, just like it has with every other asset that we've shown high correlations to over the past five, six years. In terms of when or why, I think a lot of it has to do with the type of people that are in the market. When you have new entrants to the market, and largely most of them are macro funds, specifically who are getting into bitcoin. You have a few traditional credit funds and equity funds here and there. But for the most part, most of the new money that has come into this space has been macro funds. Macro funds are more correlated than necessarily the assets they trade, meaning they're all doing the same thing. They're all looking at rates, they're all looking at the dollar, they're all looking at commodities.
00:03:15.294 - 00:03:59.926, Speaker B: So they're all doing the same thing. And when you have retail largely leaving the market for the last three to four months, you've had most of the new money coming into digital assets, coming in specifically into venture, rather than the liquid funds. You just have an environment right now where it's being dominated by a few players that all do the exact same thing and look at all the same things. So to me, it has nothing to do with bitcoin versus Nasdaq. It has to do with when new players are going to enter that are not macro funds. For instance, fidelity just talked about allowing some of their 401K customers to be able to buy bitcoin. Who knows if more corporate balance sheets will get involved in bitcoin? Who knows if more governments will get involved? There's all these different players that are not touching bitcoin today.
00:03:59.926 - 00:04:03.594, Speaker B: That could be in the future. And if that happens, that will be what breaks the correlation.
00:04:04.374 - 00:04:49.698, Speaker C: There was a lot to unpack there. Jeff, I got a couple of questions for you. Just because you're one of the few guys who can both speak deep in the weeds about crypto, but also speak compellingly about the macro environment as well, one thing that you touched on there was this idea of correlation between the Nasdaq and crypto, and maybe some of that is like common ownership, right? So that kind of Dan Moorhead quote, when he got into hedge funds back in the day, it was alts, because they were actually uncorrelated but now everybody owns the same stuff, right? So this element of common ownership and then the higher level thing is just the Fed in general. And I've heard you kind of say in the past, like one of the reasons you were excited to get out of Wall street is felt like you were just analyzing what the Fed was saying every six weeks. And that's not ultimately very exciting. But the big thing that's changed over the course of the last year is inflation in general.
00:04:49.746 - 00:04:49.882, Speaker B: Right.
00:04:49.898 - 00:05:02.634, Speaker C: And the Fed hasn't had to fight that in a very long time. So my question to you is just, do you view the Fed as being in control of the current situation, as it pertains to inflation, and does that matter when it translates into the crypto market?
00:05:02.794 - 00:05:28.122, Speaker B: Sure. And first of all, let's also remember that most digital asset participants are not coming from traditional finance, so they're learning some of this stuff. I remember six months ago when we had a really bad jobs report, and all of a sudden people are like, oh, maybe there's another jobs report coming out. People didn't know that there was weekly jobless claims every Thursday at 08:30 a.m. And that there was a monthly report every month. But they learned it. They're like, okay, right now this is driving the market, so we need to pay attention to it.
00:05:28.122 - 00:05:58.770, Speaker B: Right? Same thing. Most people who are trading bitcoin and other digital assets probably weren't too concerned about each of the FOMC meetings every six months or every six weeks for the last three years. But since the inflation print in November of last year, now all of a sudden everybody cares about it every day, most likely, just like we talked about. The correlations, the same thing with these drivers, they come and go, right? Right. Now, this is the only thing people care about. But it won't be the only thing people care about six months from now, twelve months from now. With regard to the Fed being in control, I would say absolutely not.
00:05:58.770 - 00:06:42.004, Speaker B: I think you can see that in the fact that we have a eight and a half percent year over year CPI print and we have a quarter percent fed funds rate. By definition, that means they're not in control right now. That should be, I think the last time we had CPI in the 8.5% range was something like in the, I want to say in the early eighties, and the Fed funds rate was like 14%. So yes, clearly they're not in control right now. Now the flip side of that is that they can't really be in control. Most people, including the Fed, themselves will tell you that they really can't do anything to fight inflation raising rates, whether it's 50 basis points at a time or 75 basis points or 25 basis points, it's not a whole lot they can do about rising oil prices or about rising food prices.
00:06:42.004 - 00:07:09.874, Speaker B: So a lot of it is symbolic. And there's a reason that if you look at the last three weeks, right before the next FOMC meeting is May 4, today is April 26, they're in a blackout period right now. For the next eight days they can't talk. But before that, every single day, there was two or three Fed governors that were speaking right. That's not normal. They don't go out there and talk every single day for three weeks. The reason they're doing that is because they know it's less about the rates and the rate hikes as it is about the narrative.
00:07:09.874 - 00:07:50.570, Speaker B: If they go out there and tell everybody we're in control, we're going to raise rates, we're not going to let this get out of control, then it keeps people from freaking out. Inflation is more of a mindset than anything else. If you think that your paycheck is not going to be worth as much two weeks from now as it is today, if you're in a hyperinflationary environment like in Venezuela or South Africa or Turkey in years past, you're literally spending your money the second you get it because you're worried that things are going to be too expensive a day later or two days later or a week later. That's obviously not the way. The prices aren't rising organically that fast. They start rising that fast because people are freaking out and spending much faster. So what the Fed's job is to do is to make sure that doesn't happen.
00:07:50.570 - 00:08:16.146, Speaker B: They're trying to tell everybody, hey, we got this under control. Hey, rate hikes will slow things down. Hey, we'll have this off landing to get people to be like, yeah, inflation's high, but it's not like I'm going to rush out there to buy milk the second I get paid because I'm worried that it's going to be $0.20 more expensive tomorrow. So a lot of what they can do is just talk markets down. And that's what they're doing. And that's why you see everything from bonds getting crushed to oil getting crushed, to equities getting crushed to crypto getting crushed.
00:08:16.146 - 00:08:40.234, Speaker B: It's all the same thing. That is the only thing they can do right now is to try to dampen the financial markets to basically lower people's purchasing power to make them not go out there and just start spending like crazy. The rate hikes themselves are symbolic at this point. And in fact, you could argue that it's already done, right? The two year is already at 270. It's already priced in. Everything they're planning to do is already priced in by the markets anyway.
00:08:40.394 - 00:09:32.042, Speaker C: So I guess then, knitting those two things together, let's say the Fed has woken up and said, whoa, we are way behind inflation. If you go back to the last comparable period where we had this, this rate of inflation in the US, there was the 1970s and eighties, and Fed funds was at 14% or whatever, it was €10 over 18%, I think. So it's like we have to slow things down, we have to crush demand and essentially cause a recession, right? So if you're looking at in terms of sentiment, it's like, this is like the most bearish I can ever remember it being, the most consensus I can ever remember it being for everything is going down, right. And you're starting to see that pain finally show up in the stock market. We also just talked about there's a huge correlation right now, like record high in between the Nasdaq and crypto. So my question to you is, if the Fed is indeed going to kind of pull the fire alarm and want to slow everything down in more traditional financial markets, is that necessarily going to have to translate into crypto at least over the next, like, let's say, six to nine months?
00:09:32.218 - 00:10:05.010, Speaker B: Well, let's, let's take it a different direction, which is you could argue that digital assets are performing pretty admirably in the face of what's happening here, right? So let's, let's, you know, let's look at some numbers for a second. This is updated through Sunday just because I wrote about it just the other day. But if you look at the returns over the last year to date, let's just look at. Bitcoin was down about 14% as of Sunday. The Nasdaq was down 18%. Long bonds were down 20. Emerging market equities were down 14.
00:10:05.010 - 00:10:51.746, Speaker B: Euro equities were down 16. That's a pretty admirable performance. If you think about why do hedge funds exist in the first place? Hedge funds convinced pension funds and endowments that, hey, we can capture all or most of the upside in the market, but we'll protect you against that downside. And even though hedge funds have underperformed for basically the last twelve years because the market went straight up from 2009 to 2021, people still invested in hedge funds. Why? Because they were convinced that, okay, well, when we need them, when the market turns, they'll outperform, and we want that outperformance. Basically what they're saying is we want something that has high up capture, meaning you're going to capture most of the upside, and something that has low down capture, meaning you're not going to capture a lot of the downside. Well, digital assets just as a whole, as an asset class, basically just did exactly what every investor is looking for.
00:10:51.746 - 00:11:21.594, Speaker B: The last two and a half years, during everything going up, digital assets outperformed everything under the sun on the way up, but on the way down, they're performing in line, in some cases even better than tech stocks and other ways. What's going to happen here is of course, right now, like you said, sentiment is really bad right now, nobody wants to touch anything. Right now, there's high cash balances, there's high shorts. Every fear and greed index is at the lows. It looks like no one's ever going to invest ever again. That's usually the best time to invest when nobody wants to. But it looks like the world is ending.
00:11:21.594 - 00:11:58.504, Speaker B: Of course, it probably isn't. Not every 10% or 20% correction means the world is ending. But eventually, when something changes, where that sentiment changes and where people start to get aggressive wanting to buy assets again, investors are going to look at that performance. They're going to say, hey, you know what I need to own? I need to own some digital assets. Because for the last five years, it just showed exactly the kind of characteristics I'm looking at. It has high up capture and it has very low down capture. So to me, that's the most important thing right now, is that when everybody pulls their money out, it doesn't matter if you're in a money market or you're in the most riskiest stock or digital asset in the world.
00:11:58.504 - 00:12:31.768, Speaker B: When people pull their money out, nothing's going to do well. But when they put the money back in, you're going to start to see flows go in certain directions. And I think it's pretty clear right now that Russia and China is pretty uninvestable, or at least not very high on anyone's list. Europe, because of how much they import and how much reliance they have on energy abroad, is not very high on anyones list right now. Bonds, not very high on anyone's list right now. Given we're heading towards continued rate hikes, that doesn't leave a whole lot. That leaves us equities, that leaves us real estate, that leaves digital assets.
00:12:31.768 - 00:12:42.728, Speaker B: And I'm sure there's some things I'm missing here, but you get the idea. Fund flows generally drive performance more than anything else. And I think it's pretty clear that the needle is moving in the right direction for digital assets in that regard.
00:12:42.816 - 00:13:08.486, Speaker A: Jeff, you mentioned. So Mike has asked a lot of macro related questions about the Fed, and you mentioned Russia and Ukraine. And then there's these macro indicators like the central banks hiking interest rates. I've heard you talk about censorship and just financial asset censorship in companies and countries seizing assets. How much of that narrative do you think has kicked off this, like, crypto outperforming relative to other assets?
00:13:08.590 - 00:14:08.536, Speaker B: Mike? Yeah, it's always hard to tell in the moment, but I think years from now, we're going to look back and it's going to be very obvious that February and March of 2022 were massive turning point with regard to understanding and interest in owning barrier assets like digital assets. Starting off with what Canada did, where they basically said, if you're part of this trucking convoy, we're going to freeze your assets. Okay, that's weird, right? That's not the kind of thing you'd expect to happen in Canada to, obviously, Russia, with Putin just unilaterally deciding, hey, we're going to tank our economy and the ruble just to attack Ukraine to the US and Europe, basically putting sanctions on anybody who is in Russia to even what the LME did. Right, the London Metal Exchange, basically just saying, you know what? We're going to just cancel these trades. And if you had positive p and L because of nickels rise, because you were, we're just going to cancel it. It's not yours anymore. You start to put those things together and you say, well, wait a minute.
00:14:08.536 - 00:14:40.196, Speaker B: I thought my money was my money. And now I'm finding out that my money isn't actually my money. My money is the bank or the brokerage account or the government's money, and it's really their liability to me. And whether or not they're actually going to pay me back, I have no idea. This is the kind of thing that most people in the digital asset world have been talking about for eight years, but it doesn't resonate with most people when it doesn't affect them. Now that it's starting to affect people that are more like them, right? Your russian oligarchs, your canadian citizens, your people in Europe, all of a sudden you start to say, wait a minute, this could happen. To me too.
00:14:40.196 - 00:15:01.574, Speaker B: And I don't think I'm okay with that. So you start to think about the hypocrisy of what's going on and the fact that you don't actually own your assets. And it makes you realize, maybe I do need some protection there. Maybe I do need to own some stable coins or some bitcoin or some ethereum or something else. And I think that is starting to resonate all over the world. And a year from now, we're going to point back to that and say, yeah, that was obvious.
00:15:02.154 - 00:15:13.466, Speaker C: Do you view one period of time in history that people point to as being really influential is the closing of the gold window, right. And that's when we kind of departed with all this notion that we're on some sort of gold standard. And no, it's all just fiat backed.
00:15:13.490 - 00:15:13.650, Speaker B: Right.
00:15:13.682 - 00:15:57.640, Speaker C: In general, you kind of heard some proclamations recently that the FX seizures, specifically of the russian central bank assets, right. That this was the closing of the FX reserves window, right. When if you think about the ability that there's a great thread from punk 6529 on, basically the ability to transact underpins the rest of your freedoms, right? The ability to free speech and write to assembly and freedom of the press doesn't really mean shit if you have no money to transact and actually accomplish any of that stuff. So do you view this as people kind of waking up and saying, wow, this is not actually my stuff, and we actually need something else that's more solid to underpin the global reserve currency. Maybe it's bitcoin, maybe it's some crypto thing, maybe it's commodities, whatever it is. But do you view this as being like the starting gun, essentially, for countries to think about that?
00:15:57.752 - 00:16:07.592, Speaker B: Yeah, certainly. Maybe that's probably a bigger question than what I have any real knowledge to answer, but I think yes, but I.
00:16:07.608 - 00:16:09.208, Speaker C: Also would demand answers, Jeff?
00:16:09.336 - 00:16:35.176, Speaker B: Well, I think exactly. I think the better way to think about it is, for the most part, people just trust what works. If it works, people trust it. The US dollar, for the most part works, and people just trust it. If you actually peel the onion and look what's behind the US dollar, there's not a whole hell of a lot. We all know there's nothing there other than the will of the US government and the military. The same thing would be true of an algorithmic stablecoin.
00:16:35.176 - 00:17:00.866, Speaker B: It's a joke to most people until after years it works. And finally you're like, yeah, I don't really care what's behind it. It works. I think the same thing. That's mostly what FX and currency is. It's a trust based system. I'm not really sure if the answer is making sure there's always a hard asset behind it so much as it is that you can see in this last decade and even more so in the last few months, that a lot of that trust is eroding.
00:17:00.866 - 00:17:23.482, Speaker B: And when trust erodes, people want a new system, and if you back it by something, it just leads to the next question. Well, then people might stop trusting the thing that it's backed by. I'm not sure just a backing itself is the answer, but I do think that it's clear that people are losing faith with the idea of just blindly trusting your governments, your corporations, your banks and brokerages.
00:17:23.658 - 00:17:55.082, Speaker C: I think one interesting way to maybe frame that too, is just the basic idea of property rights. When you talk about bearer assets, that's actual property rights. People own that. And there have been these studies done on just what makes an economy or successful in general. And people tend to point to these very political things like, oh, it's a democracy, or it's not a democracy. But in reality, there's a much higher correlation between strong property rights and courts that uphold those property rights, as opposed to a causal indicator of what makes an economy successful. You could trace that to what we're kind of talking about, this very macro sense, like currencies and the dollar and all that kind of stuff.
00:17:55.082 - 00:18:17.538, Speaker C: But then there's maybe like the more web3 ethos, like web two versus web3, where you own the digital assets that you're creating. And actually, this may be like a departure from what we're talking about. But I saw you wrote a post that Twitter should issue a token. So I'd be curious to get your whole standpoint on the Elon Twitter acquisition and what you're writing about in that post in general, because I think that kind of plays into this.
00:18:17.626 - 00:18:41.648, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. I mean, I'll back up for a second. I think ownership is all that matters, right. And you can point to a lot of what has happened in the last 2030 years. I think there's a great Twitter handle that's like what happened in 1971. Basically, since 1971, everything has just gone downhill. And that's basically when we removed from the gold standard, and all of a sudden wealth inequality became massive.
00:18:41.648 - 00:19:32.718, Speaker B: And basically you had to own a house or own equities to keep pace with inflation and everything like that. But ultimately it comes down to ownership, whether you own stocks or you own gold or you own a house or you own something. Well, what I think is so powerful about digital assets, and I've said this over and over again, is I think I always say I think digital assets are the greatest capital formation and customer bootstrapping and wealth equality function we've ever seen. It is the first thing that has ever basically fully aligned all of the participants of a company or an organization. I've used this analogy many times, so apologies for anyone who's heard it before, and it's repetitive. Take McDonald's for an example. There's no reason that if you're a McDonald's customer that you have to be a shareholder or vice versa.
00:19:32.718 - 00:20:41.152, Speaker B: And in fact, that's probably, if you look at a Venn diagram, that's probably one of the least overlapping circles of a Venn diagram of any company you'll ever see between a mismatch of their customers versus their shareholders. That's crazy. That means that you as a frequent customer of McDonald's, or you as a worker at McDonald's, you are doing all of these things to make McDonald's what it is and sharing in none of the ownership or the property rights or the financial benefit of that success. You can look at tons of other companies that are the same thing, from Airbnb to Doordash, even Amazon. How many Amazon prime members and delivery people are not benefiting from Amazon shares? What we're doing with digital assets is we're largely giving that ownership to the people who make these projects and companies work. Let's look at Facebook famously, 15 years ago, or 13 years ago, said, we figured out growth hacking faster than everyone else. We basically figured out that if our users like ten posts or follow ten friends within the first week, they're basically going to be a customer for life.
00:20:41.152 - 00:21:14.824, Speaker B: So Facebook did everything they could with their UI and their UX to basically force or trick their users into doing those actions, because then they would become a customer for life. But none of those users got anything for it. They weren't being paid for it, they weren't receiving any benefits for doing those things. It was just basically one giant UI UX trick. That's ridiculous. The whole idea of yield, farming and digital assets, or this idea of earning for being a participant is that basically you get the shares. It'd be the equivalent of, hey, if you do those actions Facebook wants you to do, they're going to give you some Facebook shares for doing it.
00:21:14.824 - 00:21:39.230, Speaker B: That's basically what we're doing in the digital asset world. If you're an early depositor to a Defi application, or if you're an early trader, or you're an early user of looksrare with nfts, or you're an early gamer, you're going to be paid for those actions. They are rewarding you for doing the actions that they want you to do. That is how you solve for wealth inequality. You basically reward people for actions. Let's look at Twitter. Twitter is not.
00:21:39.230 - 00:22:07.238, Speaker B: First of all, the Twitter stock price obviously hadn't gone anywhere since the IPO, which is why people have been so angry and why Musk came in. The people who made Twitter go from a few active users in San Francisco to 300 million global daily active users, they're getting nothing out of Twitter's success, even though they're the ones who make it possible. So why wouldn't you introduce a token there where it's like, hey, what are the actions we want people on Twitter to do? Well, we want you to engage in content. Great. We'll pay you for it. Hey, we want you to write content. Cool.
00:22:07.238 - 00:22:52.256, Speaker B: We'll pay you for it. Hey, we want to have discussions on Twitter spaces or whatever. You get the idea. It wouldn't be hard for executives in Twitter to say, what are the things we want people to do, and let's go reward them with it. And then we can make that token not only quasi equity in the form of getting some of the kickbacks from the revenue and profits of the company, but then you can also make it utility. Hey, you can redeem your Twitter tokens to post, or you can redeem them to amplify a post or boost it. There's all these different things you can do, and I haven't thought through all of it, but you get the idea this is the perfect company for ownership or property rights or benefits to be shifted from shareholders to the people who make it work on a daily basis.
00:22:52.256 - 00:22:55.336, Speaker B: And I think they would be absolutely crazy not to implement that.
00:22:55.400 - 00:23:32.080, Speaker A: Jeff, what's the problem that you're trying to solve for here? Because if I'm putting it on almost like a web two skeptical hat, I'm saying, well, Facebook did all right without a token, right? They've got a $500 billion market cap and 2 billion users. If I'm Uber and the Uber's, I think the one that gets used a lot is like, we could have given tokens to the drivers by bootstrap and help bootstrap the growth there. But if I'm an Uber executive or an Uber VC, I'm saying, well, we did pretty damn well we've got a public company, $60 billion market cap, and the biggest ride sharing company in the world right now. We did all that without a token. So what is the problem that you're trying to solve there?
00:23:32.232 - 00:24:16.834, Speaker B: Well, that's survivorship bias, right? You're looking at the ones that succeeded. How about all the executives that are sitting around wondering how come they didn't become the next Uber or the next Starbucks or the next Facebook? I mean, there's thousands or tens of thousands of examples of things that failed that probably had similar models that could have worked. And you can look around on a daily basis. I mean, how many things that you do in your daily life do you actually have an equity ownership? Here's an example. I'm maybe a different demographic than some of your listeners and you guys, but I take my kids to the park in the morning, and then maybe we go get a haircut, and maybe we go eat at a local restaurant, and then maybe we go to a climbing gym or something. Like, I don't own anything. I have no equity ownership in any of these small private businesses that we transact in on a daily basis.
00:24:16.834 - 00:25:05.404, Speaker B: What if I did? What if I had a token and all of a sudden I not only am using these even more, but now I'm evangelizing and trying to get all my friends and family to go use these services as well? Most of the things you do on a daily basis, you have no real incentive or interest in the success of that business. You're just using it. But what if you had some sort of economic success or some sort of loyalty to these businesses and services you're using? You could argue that a lot of these would succeed even faster. So I don't know. I wouldn't point to the super successful mega tech companies and say, therefore, we don't need to align incentives because these worked. I would point to all the failures in small businesses that haven't maybe lived up to their potential, possibly because they haven't aligned their customers with their profiteers.
00:25:05.564 - 00:25:56.440, Speaker C: Maybe this one, we can get into the weeds a little bit more on crypto governance, because you guys are pretty active on some of these. From a governance standpoint, a lot of the protocols that you invest in, maybe the way that I kind of see what we're talking about here, which is giving ownership in the protocol to new users, is it's a CAC versus LTV problem. If you think about there's a cost, it's almost like equity financing, where you're giving equity away to these new users of your platform, and you're hoping that the growth that you get from those new users more than offsets the cost of whatever equity that you're giving away. I think one of the early iterations of that was yield farming. It was usually around these decentralized finance farming type applications where they wanted liquidity to move on. And I think you're starting to see this almost passed on compound. They kicked off Defi summer with exactly what we're talking about.
00:25:56.440 - 00:26:30.920, Speaker C: And they actually talked and almost passed, stopping giving away those farming incentives. Because I think the problem with it is that, to your point, it's a very expensive way to acquire customers and you don't actually maybe acquire the best ones from your perspective or Arka's perspective. How are protocols? What do you think the best way to actually give those tokens or equity away to new users? Is it just to dump it on them? Is it to maybe have lockup periods? How are you seeing v one of yield farming evolve in this next iteration of governance?
00:26:31.072 - 00:27:05.788, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I mean, a lot of it is different incentives for different types of companies and businesses, right? I'm not sure there's a one stop shop answer to how to do it, but you're seeing that experimentation. I mean, the early days from compound and even like AavE and some of the other lending borrower platforms were like, it's clear that they just inflated way too much, way too fast. They just gave it away. They got mercenaries to come in and then those guys left, and now they're left with a, I suppose a worse off capital structure than maybe they would have otherwise. But at the same time, those protocols are still functioning pretty well. It worked. Those guys are.
00:27:05.788 - 00:27:45.534, Speaker B: It's not like this is a high barrier to entry space, and it's not like there isn't competition. But if you look at TVL like compound and Maker and Aave are still leading by a mile in terms of the lending borrowing platform. So you could argue that maybe they gave away too much and maybe they didn't have the stickiest customers out of it, or maybe they didn't get the best results, but they certainly got good results. Notwithstanding the price of their tokens, the business itself is doing exactly what you'd hoped to do. If you have, I don't know, exact numbers, but what is it? You're in the multiple tens of billions now. You got 14 billion at TVL at maker, 11 billion at Aave. Curve's got 10 billion.
00:27:45.534 - 00:28:19.170, Speaker B: Those are real numbers. Compound 6 billion, those are real numbers for startups. I think I read something a while ago that if you took all of the DeFi applications and put them together collectively, DeFi would be the 19th largest bank in the United States, which is pretty powerful, considering DeFi is basically two years old in all intents and purposes. So it has definitely worked. It may just not be perfect. So what's other iterations that people have tried? Well, they tried the curve or the ve tokenomics, where if you just lock up your tokens for longer, then you get more benefits. And that's okay.
00:28:19.170 - 00:29:06.710, Speaker B: That's a way of saying, okay, you have to at least be a long term holder to get the benefits, but it doesn't really incentivize the actions that you want. I think the right design is to take each business, just like we talked about with Facebook, and say, what is it that we want you to do? What is a perfect customer look like? And let's incentivize you for doing that. I mean, looksrare is probably the best example right now. Right? Looksrare is just a copycat of OpenSea. Opensea is a corporation that is owned by venture Equity, that has all kinds of regulatory pressure that's preventing them from doing a token or doing anything to reward their customers. There's a $13 billion equity valuation of which, what, six guys benefited from that? None of the customers or people on Opensea are benefiting at all from Opensea success. So here comes looks rare.
00:29:06.710 - 00:29:16.934, Speaker B: And what do they do? They say, hey, what are the actions we want people to do? We want you to list nfts. Okay, cool. We'll pay you for it. Hey, we want you to buy nfts. Okay, we'll pay you for it. Oh, we want you to trade. Okay, we'll pay you for it.
00:29:16.934 - 00:29:37.430, Speaker B: Right. Those incentives are already starting to wear off and looks rare is continuing to rise in terms of market dominance of nfts, these actions matter. Now, there's not a perfect formula yet. I think these have to be tweaked constantly. And I think sometimes you start something, you realize it doesn't work, and that's where governance comes in. And you say, hey, this isn't working. Let's make a change, or let's try this.
00:29:37.430 - 00:30:06.222, Speaker B: And I think the ability to be fluid and flexible really matters. But I don't think there's going to be just an answer to what is the perfect dynamic. I think holistically, the things that I really believe in is that one you have to align all your stakeholders, your founders, your developers, your passive investors, your customers, your liquidity providers, you have to align them. And two is you have to figure out what it is you're actually trying to achieve in your business, and let's figure out a way to get people to do that.
00:30:06.318 - 00:30:24.418, Speaker C: How are you seeing governance evolve in general? Again, I keep asking these one size fits all questions, but if you had to take a snapshot of how governance worked at some of these large protocols, like ones that I know you've been involved, like a sushi or something like that, let's say twelve months ago versus what it looks like today, how do you see that structure evolving?
00:30:24.606 - 00:30:53.292, Speaker B: I mean, you first have to kind of start with, most daos are not decentralized autonomous organizations. Very few are decentralized. Almost none of them are autonomous. They're really just organizations. So let's just start there and call spade a spade. Most of them are just organizations that have a fun way of describing themselves. But to get to decentralized or autonomous, there is a path to getting there.
00:30:53.292 - 00:31:31.954, Speaker B: But very few things can start fully decentralized and autonomous. Bitcoin and even to some extent, ethereum are probably the anomalies, not the norm. Most projects need to start with a real leader. They need to start with some direction. And then as you start to figure out exactly what you're solving for in your product market fit and what works and what doesn't and what kind of employees you need and what kind of customers you're attracting, then you can start to figure out, okay, how do we automate some of this? How do we decentralize some of the ownership? Right. And if you go back to what Hester Pearse in the SEC put out, I think two years ago with her safe harbor, she pretty much nailed it. She put out a three year safe harbor idea which said, go ahead and start your company however you want, we'll give you three years.
00:31:31.954 - 00:32:10.190, Speaker B: But you need to hit these check boxes along the way. That proves that you're heading towards decentralized and autonomous in order to basically be safe from retribution. That's probably where you have to head in terms of governance. Today, a lot of what has worked from a governance standpoint is less opinions, not more. Right? In the early days of a company, you kind of need a king or a leader or a monarchy. You can't just have a thousand voices and be like, yep, we're going to get it right on day 30 because 400 people all have different opinions, and we're going to figure out how to put that together. It's like, you know what? Sometimes you just need one person to make a decision, and it might work and it might not.
00:32:10.190 - 00:32:31.044, Speaker B: But at least you can actually make a decision. And if it doesn't work, then you can fix it. So I've always thought the right way for governance is governance is a checks and balances system. It's not designed to run the company. Just because you're a big token holder and have a large vote doesn't mean you are now the CEO. It just means that you're the checks and balances system. You have the keys to overturn bad decisions.
00:32:31.044 - 00:33:00.070, Speaker B: You have the keys to help off board or onboard if you need help. You have the ability to basically prevent bad actors. You know, all this talk about from the SEC, or really not the SEC, it's really just Gensler. But all this talk from Gensler is about, we need a cop on the beat. We need someone to protect you. The reality is, most of the time, crowds are better at protecting than individual enforcement. And if you have the crowd saying, hey, you guys, go ahead, you two or three or five or ten people, go ahead.
00:33:00.070 - 00:33:14.622, Speaker B: Run your business however you want. But we're going to be watching you. And if you make a mistake, we're going to call you out on it, and we want you to do it in the public domain. We want public dashboards. We want public transparency. We are going to be your public board of directors. But we're not having a board of director meeting every day.
00:33:14.622 - 00:33:34.674, Speaker B: We're going to have it when there's a reason to have it right, when somebody does something wrong, or when a big decision needs to be made. And that's probably how it works best. And that's how we've seen it works best, is get the right people in place, run it like a business. But when big decisions need to be made or when changes need to be made, that's when the governance really comes into play.
00:33:36.414 - 00:34:05.304, Speaker A: All right, everyone, quick break from the show to share a big update from our friends at Paraswap. The best platform to stake, swap, trade, farm, and more. Periswap just launched. Gas refunds. Based on how much you stake, you can now get up to 100% of your gas refunded on all of your swaps on Paraswap. This is huge for anyone who has spent a lot of time in Defi, or maybe it's just starting out. You know how egregiously expensive the gas transactions can get.
00:34:05.304 - 00:34:28.572, Speaker A: The gas fees are ridiculous at some points in time, and now you can get those entirely refunded on Paraswap. To participate, all you need to do is stake a minimum of 500 psp. Big shout out to the paraswap dow for making these refunds possible. Really, it's just. It's tough to beat Paraswap right now. They give you the best prices, they save you money. You've got this gas refund if you stake PSP.
00:34:28.572 - 00:34:47.424, Speaker A: They've got a smooth and really user friendly interface. Fast swapping. It's really everything that you'd want from a defi platform if you don't use them already. Check out Paraswap today at Paraswap IO. Now let's get back to the show. Jeff, if you look at two, let's. Let's.
00:34:47.424 - 00:35:11.498, Speaker A: Let's compare two companies. So you've got Coinbase and Uniswap, right? Um, they both enable users to swap and trade tokens. Uniswap has 3% of the employees of Coinbase, yet they do about 75% of the trading volume. And the reason that this has happened, I think you would argue, is because the incentives are completely aligned. They make their users owners via governance. Tokens and lp tokens. Is there any way for these? Almost.
00:35:11.498 - 00:35:32.524, Speaker A: I think in crypto, we call them c five companies, right. The blockfi and the Coinbases of the world. Is there any way for them to compete with. Is there any way for Opensea to compete with elixir or Coinbase to compete with the uniswap? Like, what is your vision of how these two types of companies, DeFI and CFI, coexist in the next couple of years? Or maybe you would argue DeFi, just kind of runs over these c five companies.
00:35:32.824 - 00:35:55.532, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, I think short term, the answer is move out of the US, right? I mean, FTX and Binance both have a token. Right. You know, the reason I love the exchange business, as an analogy is because you have three exactly the same companies all doing it completely differently. Right. You have something like Coinbase, which just has debt and equity and no token. You have something like Uniswap and Sushiswap that has no equity and just a token.
00:35:55.532 - 00:36:29.672, Speaker B: And then you have, like Binance and FTX that have both, or Bitfinex. And they're all doing the exact same thing, and they're having different levels of success based on partly their capital structure. You could certainly argue that binance and FTX are having the most success because of the fact that they have the equity base to help them grow when they need it. But they also have the token base. Who has this loyalty and membership benefit part in addition to financial upset that matters? That is probably the best alignment we've seen. So I think the short term answer is, you have to get out of the United States. The United States is not allowing you to do it, or at least nobody's been willing to fight them enough to challenge it.
00:36:29.672 - 00:36:55.196, Speaker B: You would love to see an opensea say, I hear you, but I'm going to go issue a token anyway, and you can fight me in court to see if it's legal or not. But they're not there yet. They'd love to see Coinbase do it. I think it's crazy that Coinbase even did a public stock listing instead of doing a tokenized stock offering. You're the behemoth in the business. Go out there and try something that's hard, even if it doesn't have the best financial results, and go see if you can make changes that are beneficial to you long term. It's not like issuing equity did much for them.
00:36:55.196 - 00:37:44.840, Speaker B: The stock's down 60% since they went public. You need the bigger companies that are well resourced and have the legal teams to go out there and push the envelope. I think that's step one, is the US is challenging, but somebody needs to just push the envelope and try to win a court battle. Two, though, is I think ultimately, I do think that DeFi and Cefi kind of merge, where I think eventually these centralized companies really just become pass through entities to a DeFi. Back end the analogy. And I'm always big on analogies because I speak to a lot of investors who are new to digital assets. I try to find ways to dumb it down, and I test things on my 73 year old parents to see if they understand.
00:37:44.840 - 00:38:27.394, Speaker B: I know others will, but the analogy I always use is like 20 years ago, 25 years ago, if you flew at an airport, you basically had your paper ticket, they issued you the paper ticket in the mail, you showed up, you handed your paper ticket over, you got on the plane. Somewhere around 1820 years ago, they started doing the electronic ticketing and the kiosks, and you had to swipe your credit card to get your ticket. As silly as this sounds now, people were terrified of doing that. They're about to go up in a plane, the 30,000ft in the air, going 500 miles an hour, and they're totally fine with that. But they were terrified about swiping their credit card in a machine. So what they would do is they'd go up to the ticket counter and be like, hey, I need to go get my ticket. And the person behind the ticket counter would say, okay.
00:38:27.394 - 00:38:54.796, Speaker B: And they would walk you over to the kiosk and show you how to use it. That's basically what I think the CFI DeFi relationship will be. It's like you'll go to Coinbase because it's comfortable. You'll go to Opensea because it's comfortable. That's your ticket agent, that's your live person on the phone who can help you. But all they're going to do is route your trade through a DeFi back end. You're going to have the Amms providing liquidity, and they're going to route trades and source the liquidity, just like anybody who uses DeFi directly.
00:38:54.796 - 00:39:09.842, Speaker B: So ultimately, it doesn't mean that they don't have a place. It just means that you're not going to Coinbase because they have the best market makers. You're going to Coinbase because they have a brand and a service. And ultimately you're all basically going to be transacting out of the same liquidity pool.
00:39:09.988 - 00:39:30.118, Speaker C: So, Jeff, maybe let's turn the focus here towards the future. You guys see a whole bunch of different opportunities as a fund. I know you've been active in a whole bunch of different governance proposals, that kind of thing. What are you excited about, let's say, over the course of the next six to twelve months, any areas where you're just super keyed into excited about from.
00:39:30.166 - 00:39:31.710, Speaker B: A theme or sector standpoint?
00:39:31.822 - 00:39:33.714, Speaker C: A theme or sector standpoint, yeah.
00:39:35.694 - 00:39:35.958, Speaker A: I.
00:39:35.966 - 00:40:16.944, Speaker B: Would definitely say it's a little bit of a lull right now in a the sense that a year ago, two years ago, we were incredibly excited about nfts and gaming. We were incredibly excited about DeFi right now. It's a little boring in a sense. Honestly, the biggest thing I'm most excited about is stable coins. I think stable coins going from zero to 200 billion in the last year and a half, probably heading to a trillion plus in the next year. I think that's a huge deal. There's a lot of pure play ways to play that, from Luna to fracs for those who have access, maybe circle equity, but I think that is a huge growth engine for all digital assets.
00:40:16.944 - 00:40:57.034, Speaker B: I think Bridges is still something that is really important. Whether you are. There's obviously a lot. I don't want to get into the technology here, but in terms of the different types of bridges that exist, we'll see which technology wins out. But this idea of a cross chain world where you don't even really care what chain you start on or end up on, all you care about is can my assets get there. I think that's a huge problem that will be solved here in the next year. Some form of interoperability, whether that's atoms IBC ecosystem, which we're really bullish on, or something like multi chain or synapse, but there's a lot of different ways to tackle that problem.
00:40:57.034 - 00:42:11.704, Speaker B: Then I'm also really a big believer in kind of non trading consumer apps that start to work. I mean, we've seen little iterations of that, things like step in for those who are unfamiliar, the idea of getting paid for basically moving and exercising to some, even b, two b things like a, unibright that's working on logistics to certain gaming apps or integrations with shopping. I think, for example, even though the metaverse is a really loose term and probably years away from having any real traction, you could think of, Amazon really is a giant metaverse right now. You go to Amazon and you click around and you shop in different stores. Well, one day that might be a metaverse experience where you have your avatar and you're going into these different storefronts within Amazon. So I think this idea of real world consumer behavior things, rather than just things that are based on trading and finance, are really exciting. And then lastly, this is one we've liked for a while, really big on this interaction between fans and their favorite sports teams, celebrities, athletes, etcetera.
00:42:11.704 - 00:43:05.190, Speaker B: We've talked about Chili's many times with their idea of fan tokens, connecting fans directly to their favorite sports teams, but I think it goes beyond that. I think you're going to have these personal connections between musicians, athletes, influencers, celebrities where they directly own their communities. The communities can benefit both financially as well as via utility for being a part of that community. So I think that's sort of the biggest growth engine. I'll leave with one last that's probably further out, but what really excites me mostly is I think every company and entity in the world is going to have a token one day. We already talked about Twitter token. It is so inevitable to me that Disney will have a token one day, and the Disney token market cap will be greater than the Disney equity because that token will give you rights to Disney plus and access to rides at the park and divs on IP and things like that.
00:43:05.190 - 00:43:56.736, Speaker B: I think every municipality will have a token. You want to fund a certain project in the city you live in, great. You can do that through a token and get better access to the park, or maybe faster lines at the airport, or different rates and taxis, or maybe you live in San Antonio, but you're bullish on Atlanta, Georgia. You can invest in that token if you want, even if you don't live there, rather than instead of the old way of having to go there and buy a house to have any exposure to it, now you can do it through a token. I think every university is going to have a token. You're going to buy UCLA token for your kid when he's born, and if he goes to UCLA 18 years later, you can use it as tuition, and if not, you can trade it for Notre Dame Coin or a Harvard coin. I just think it's so obvious that every entity in the world is going to have a token that is going to be so much bigger than what exists today.
00:43:56.920 - 00:44:38.366, Speaker A: Jeff, one thing that stands out that you didn't mention, you mentioned gaming in the metaverse and everything having a token. One thing that is clear that you didn't mention is defi. To me, when I think about your investing style, you are one of the unique folks where you didn't come from an engineering or software background and started investing, you came from this finance background. Because of that. I feel like one of the ways you look at the market is you say, okay, some of these things actually have almost traditional spit off cash flows and they've got margins, and you can analyze these things in almost more traditional capital markets ways. For Defi, TvL has really stagnated since November or December of 2021. What's your take on Defi over the next six to twelve months? Still stagnant.
00:44:38.366 - 00:44:46.438, Speaker A: Got over its skis in Defi summer, and it's going to continue just stagnating or you think we're primed for a breakout in Defi again?
00:44:46.566 - 00:45:00.362, Speaker B: Well, I think it depends on if you're talking about the token prices or just the usage and the activity level. So I think I didn't mention Defi just because, as silly as it sounds, Defi is kind of old news compared to what's coming in the future. Right. It's the utility.
00:45:00.418 - 00:45:02.794, Speaker A: It's becoming a utility of the industry.
00:45:02.954 - 00:45:33.514, Speaker B: Yeah. Defi is a mature two years old now. Right. It's not exciting anymore. No, but I mean, I'll go back quickly to, I mentioned at the top of the hour, we talked about my experience with Citibank freezing my assets and me having a hole to plug at Coinbase. Do you know how I actually plugged that hole? I took some ethereum I deposited on Aave. I took out a USDC loan and I took that USDC and I sent it over to Coinbase to plug the hole until I had access to my bank again and I insured my risk at Aave with Nexus mutual.
00:45:33.514 - 00:45:56.606, Speaker B: To me, that took 15 minutes. That was an obvious solution to a problem. I'm guessing most people in the world don't think of that as an obvious solution to a problem yet, but it was. My bank literally froze my assets for 14 days. Didn't tell me I had no customer service, no idea what was going on, and in 15 minutes I solved the problem through Defi. I think Defi just works. It may be boring right now because TVL has stagnated.
00:45:56.606 - 00:46:22.074, Speaker B: It may be frustrating because token prices have been down for twelve months, but it works. It really works. I think more people, instead of just writing about it and talking about how nothing works. Like Joe Weisendahl, Bloomberg, for example. I was picking on him the other day because he was just like, he wrote an article yesterday or two days ago saying all crypto is trading for speculation. The reality is I haven't solved for anything. And I'm like, that's clearly somebody who hasn't tried to do anything.
00:46:22.074 - 00:46:42.538, Speaker B: People who have played blockchain based games know that it works. People who have used Defi applications know that it works. People who have sent money across boundaries with stable coins know that it works. It's just that not enough people have actually tried it yet. It's still intimidating. It's still scary. Again, I joked, but 20 years ago, people thought it was scary to put your credit card in the machine.
00:46:42.538 - 00:47:06.490, Speaker B: They really did. They were like, I'm not doing this. And then one day there was that Malcolm Gladwell tipping point was like, well, you kind of can't function in society unless you put your credit card in things. And one day it was just like, okay, I don't agree with it. It's scary, but I'm going to do it anyway. That's sort of where we'll head with Defi. It's just like one day you're going to have more and more of these anecdotal stories like mine, where you use Defi to get a loan or to send assets, and you'd be like, yeah, it just flat out works.
00:47:06.490 - 00:47:49.188, Speaker B: And it works a lot better than the system that we have in the banking and brokerage world. So I don't know when that tipping point happens. I don't know when it just becomes normal for people to do that, but I think we will get there. But in terms of investing, yeah, I mean, DeFi is one of the easiest things to invest in because those cash flows and revenues are real. I mean, we can model, we only invest at Arca in companies and projects that we can see a real path to token accrual. We're not making these early stage bets of, oh, this is the future network of the world, and we'll figure out token later. We invest in things that say, yeah, we can see a path right now or in the near future to how that token is going to accrue economic value.
00:47:49.188 - 00:48:31.892, Speaker B: And that's usually through a combination of revenue and cash flows and some form of utility feature. You know, binance is a good example, right? Binance from a cash flow standpoint is easy. They make money when you trade on their platform, and you know, some portion of that money gets used to buy back BNB tokens. But they also have all these different utility ways to use the BNB token. You can use it to get discounted trading fees, you can use it to get collapsed as collateral to trade futures and options. You can use it to get in the lottery for new tokens that get issued on binance. They've solved for that hybrid function of here's the cash flow financial upside on one side, and here's the supply, here's the demand function for the utility or member benefit on the other side.
00:48:31.892 - 00:49:08.520, Speaker B: Defi a lot of them do the same thing. We certainly look for those tokens that accrue that real value through cash flows, but also have found ways to make the token useful within the network. It doesn't necessarily mean just because things are valuable doesn't mean they go up, though. I think that's where the misnomer is in crypto investing is everyone thinks that if you find something that's cheap, it has to go up 100% tomorrow or you're wrong. Sometimes it takes some time, sometimes you have to own it and be like, yeah, I bought it and it was really cheap at two times sales and four times earnings with a 15% dividend yield. And guess what? Six months from now, it just got cheaper. Now it's trading at one time sales and two times earnings and a 20% dividend yield.
00:49:08.520 - 00:49:28.480, Speaker B: It doesn't mean you were wrong per se, it means it got cheaper. Your risk model should be telling you to buy more. So that's how we think of it there. We certainly have heavy allocations to Defi, and we've been adding on the way down. But it's about finding the right businesses, finding the right projects, finding the right tokens that accrue that value.
00:49:28.632 - 00:49:56.574, Speaker A: One thing that I don't think we've solved in crypto yet that actually some of the banks really have done a good job at is keeping your user and just making it really. Even though the product sometimes sucks, you end up sticking with your fintech app or your bank for 20 years. You mentioned you use Coinbase. I bet you use Coinbase because Coinbase was probably the first place that you ever bought your first bitcoin. I don't know when it was, but I know that's the same for me. I've been using the same bank account for 20 years. Even though I hate the experience.
00:49:56.574 - 00:50:20.704, Speaker A: In Defi, we haven't solved that. It's really easy for a user to just flip out of one protocol into another. And we've tried to solve it. First with yield farming, then yield farming. We realized people dump the token. So then we introduced these ve mechanics to try to lock up users and to keep them for longer. What is the future of building moats and capturing value and just keeping a sticky user look like in Defi?
00:50:20.864 - 00:50:53.028, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a great question. I don't have a marketing or branding background in any way, shape or form, but I think you've hit it on the head. Right? Is that a lot of times, you know, especially in this space, people care so much about the technology and most of the time it has nothing to do with the technology. It has to do with the business development and the ability to, you know, create that sticky customer experience. I don't know if I have great answers for what you have to do, but I can give you examples of, you know, like I mentioned, Nexus mutual. I'll pick on them for a second. I really like the Nexus mutual team.
00:50:53.028 - 00:51:23.074, Speaker B: You know, there's only seven or eight people working there compared to, you know, 500 at like, you know, an insurance tech company like root or lemonade. Clearly, economically it works. You can go out there and you can buy your insurance, you can protect your principal and it makes all the sense in the world. But from an insurance standpoint, in terms of an easy product, most people aren't going out there seeking insurance. The insurance just comes with what you purchase. If I buy a car, I'm basically being forced to buy the insurance. If I go rent a car, I'm being forced to buy the insurance.
00:51:23.074 - 00:51:53.406, Speaker B: I'm not renting the car. And then 45 minutes later trying to drive to an insurance agency to get insurance on the rental car, I just got it. That's crazy. That would be a terrible experience. Nexus mutual is caught in that right now as well. It's like I go on Aave or I go on compound or I go somewhere where I put assets to work and then I have to separately go find Nexus mutual and say, hey, can I buy insurance on that? That has nothing to do with whether or not the technology is great or not. For something like Nexus mutual, it has to do with they have not solved that customer stickiness thing.
00:51:53.406 - 00:52:37.512, Speaker B: They have not solved the business development or the partnerships they need with Defi applications to get people to, in one click, buy the insurance. It should be the second I connect my metamask wallet to a DeFi application, there should be some sort of a pop up that says, do you want to insure this transaction? They haven't solved that. That has nothing to do with anything other than, again, marketing, pr, customer relations, things like that. So I think that is a real issue in the industry. Not necessarily specific to DeFi is that most of these teams are just tech teams. They haven't invested in the business development, in the marketing, in the customer stickiness. They're just building cool tech and putting up a 1990s style user interface and hoping that people try.
00:52:37.512 - 00:52:42.844, Speaker B: Look at Curve. Curve looks like an Atari game. That's awesome.
00:52:43.304 - 00:52:46.404, Speaker C: I feel like that is great branding, don't you think?
00:52:47.224 - 00:53:04.456, Speaker B: Yeah, very well, maybe. But my point is that's clearly not a focus of. There's no focus there. There's no team at Curve. It's like, you know, what we're going to focus right now is on customer retention and building and marketing and Ui. Right. So I think that is probably is something that definitely needs to be solved for.
00:53:04.456 - 00:53:28.918, Speaker B: I don't have a lot of good answers to how you solve it, but I think that is definitely where money will be spent in the future, is figuring out that loyalty. And, you know, it's. You're right. I mean, a lot of the companies and businesses that you use are not necessarily ones that you love, but it's just easy because you've been there for so long. But I would actually argue it's the other way. It's more that you're a prisoner. It is just such a pain in the butt to change banking accounts.
00:53:28.918 - 00:53:59.926, Speaker B: It is such a pain to onboard at some of these financial institutions that you just basically are like, I don't care how bad of experience, I'm willing to do it. The ease of. The ease of DeFi, how easy it is to be fluid, basically allows you to be free. While you could point to that and say, well, therefore, Defi has a customer retention problem. You could also say that Defi as a whole has an awesome customer experience because you are free to move around until you find one that you really like. And then once you find something that you like, you're going to stay. Right.
00:53:59.926 - 00:54:09.190, Speaker B: So it's probably better for the consumer, but definitely a challenge for the companies and projects.
00:54:09.302 - 00:54:49.426, Speaker A: Yeah, nobody moves into stablecoins and then moves back to their us dollar in their bank account. It's just a better user experience. One of the last questions I have, I'm not sure if Mike has anything else, is actually, we've been talking about the app layer a lot, but I'm curious to get your take on layer ones and really this base layer. And I think my main question is, when you look at valuing these layer ones, do you look at them more as a business where you're looking at cash flows basically, or do you look at them more as a economy or a country where you're valuing it on the economy of a nation? How do you value and mental model and framework these kind of layer ones?
00:54:49.590 - 00:55:17.494, Speaker B: Sure, and it's a good segue to maybe a future guest for you would be a great analyst we have at ArCa by the name of Nick Hodz, who wrote an article exactly that. Right. Our blockchain February 22 on our blog. You can find it at Ar CA, but it says our blockchains businesses are nations. And he actually walks through exactly how we look at these different entities. And the answer is, we look at both. Again, valuation techniques are not meant to be.
00:55:17.494 - 00:55:51.930, Speaker B: We do one thing and that's the answer. It's usually multiple different frameworks, even in the equity world. You'll use a DCF analysis, you might use a comparable comps method, you might use a dividend yield model, you might use three or four different ways to come up with what is the valuation of this business. We do the same thing right now with blockchains when they first start a startup blockchain. A layer one. Obviously you have to look at it more like a nation. It's the equivalent of if you found some remote island in the middle of the Pacific, it might have speculative value on day one because it's land.
00:55:51.930 - 00:56:26.692, Speaker B: All these things you could do with it. You could build roads and businesses and all these different things that generate economic activity. But it's a blank canvas. You have to do something with it before it has value. But then ten years later, if you actually succeed with that and all of a sudden you have all these things happening, then you could point to look at all this tax revenue that we're creating now you could actually value it business because you have real cash flows. I think the answer is both. I think Ethereum is a great example, because Ethereum is the most mature of all the layer one blockchains in terms of being on both sides of that aisle as a business.
00:56:26.692 - 00:57:19.784, Speaker B: Really easy to analyze right now. It's high fees. Those cash flows are real because of EIP 1559, as well as heading towards the ETH 2.0 merge, you can start to really see the economic benefit of those cash flows and how it accrues back to the ETH token. So you can very easily create an ETH model and say, what are these cash flows worth? But at the same time, those cash flows are in ETH terms, which basically means that it's a currency in its own native. It's very circular. So then you have to look at it as a nation and say, okay, well, within this nation and all this economic activity or GDP that is happening, how valuable is it to have your own native currency where everything is transacting? So we look at it both ways, and again, it depends on which one you're looking at and how mature it is, whether or not fees make sense, or the stickiness of that currency and the velocity of that currency within the nation.
00:57:19.784 - 00:57:40.632, Speaker B: The biggest takeaway for us is that three years ago, nobody knew how to do anything in terms of valuing these things. Now we have two separate valuation methodologies that we're using, and we might have four or five in the future, but they're both really helpful ways to look at the future economic growth of these blockchains and how that ultimately accrues back to the tokens.
00:57:40.828 - 00:58:01.712, Speaker C: Well said. I think it's certainly tough to do. We didn't get into talk about anything like Mev or anything like that. When I think about how to value something like ETH, it's the discounted sum of all the future fees that accrue to the network. But obviously there are block rewards, and then there's also Meb and value that gets extracted that way. But that's maybe a topic for another time, honestly.
00:58:01.888 - 00:58:08.260, Speaker A: Or there's the Ryan, Ryan Sean Adams from bankless, which is blockchains are just companies that sell blocks.
00:58:08.452 - 00:58:33.954, Speaker B: Yeah, I like that. Yeah. And you can, I mean, you could actually run a real income statement based on that. You could say, you know, this is, you know, this is the block sales and this is the, you know, cost of blockchain space. And, you know, you can actually run a real, you know, tradfi analogy, income statement there. That looks very similar. But I think it's just cool that there's enough people in this space now that are starting to think this way, that are starting to put that work out there and starting to test these models.
00:58:33.954 - 00:59:01.846, Speaker B: Don't forget, everything that we now believe is gospel in the equity and debt world. That stuff didn't exist 100 years ago either. The fixed income securities Bible that everyone reads was created in the sixties or seventies. Graham and Dodd, I think, was in what, the twenties or thirties? Before that, stocks were around for 300 years. Before that. That people traded without having any idea what the value was. The fact that this stuff in year ten is starting to be developed.
00:59:01.846 - 00:59:43.016, Speaker B: In 30 years, every kid coming out of school is going to be forced to read the digital asset valuation handbook, and it'll be 1400 pages long. And most of the people will skip reading it and think they'll figure it out on their own, and six years later they'll realize they need a better base and they'll read it. So we're heading in that direction where these valuation techniques are being created and they're being tested and people are thinking of them through. In 20 or 30 years, digital asset investing will be a boring commodity, just like equities, where if you give ten analysts the exact same information, they're all going to give you the exact same outputs. That's what equities and fixed income look like today. That's obviously not what digital assets look like. You give ten digital asset investors the exact same inputs, they're going to give you wildly different outputs.
00:59:43.016 - 00:59:45.208, Speaker B: And quite frankly, that's where the alpha comes from.
00:59:45.336 - 00:59:59.468, Speaker A: Yeah, right now, crypto moves on the memes and the narrative more than just, I think probably the cash flows. You might argue differently, but that's how I see it. How long does it take for this fundamental investing to move into crypto? Is it really 20 to 30 years or do you think it happens, happens faster than that?
00:59:59.556 - 01:00:38.950, Speaker B: No, I think it definitely happens faster in terms of the types of investors. I think it might be 20 or 30 years before you have an agreed upon framework. But again, we talked about at the top of the hour that the reason bitcoin is so correlated right now is because macro investors are dominating trade when pensions and endowments, and they're coming very fast when they start putting their money in. And when you start getting long, short equity managers coming in and you start having these different fundamental managers coming in, then fundamentals will matter more than means. Right now, memes matter because this is highly dominated by macro and retail as the investor base changes, the inputs to success and failure change as well.
01:00:39.142 - 01:00:41.394, Speaker A: Jeff, anything else you want to talk about here?
01:00:41.934 - 01:00:54.858, Speaker B: No. Shout out to the great work you guys are doing, appreciate all the education you guys are doing. And shout out to my team at Arca, who I think is the best in the business in terms of thinking through some of these challenging concepts. So I appreciate you having me on and getting a chance to talk about it.
01:00:54.946 - 01:01:06.538, Speaker A: Yeah, of course, Jeff. Places to find you is on twitterman 81. Arca is Arka. And then I would recommend everyone subscribes to their newsletter, the two satoshis. Really?
01:01:06.586 - 01:01:08.242, Speaker B: That's our two satoshis? Yeah.
01:01:08.298 - 01:01:11.650, Speaker A: So, Jeff, thanks again for coming on. This has been awesome. And, yeah, be well.
01:01:11.762 - 01:01:13.498, Speaker B: All right. Appreciate you guys. Been a lot of fun.
01:01:13.626 - 01:01:15.134, Speaker A: Yeah. Cheers.
