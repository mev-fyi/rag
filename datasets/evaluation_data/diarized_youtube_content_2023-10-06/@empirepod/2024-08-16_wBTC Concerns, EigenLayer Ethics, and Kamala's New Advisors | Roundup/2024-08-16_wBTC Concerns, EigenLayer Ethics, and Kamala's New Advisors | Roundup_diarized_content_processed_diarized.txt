00:01:45.458 - 00:01:51.346, Speaker A: Well, I was promised that it was going to be a slow, slow summer. It's nothing but.
00:01:51.498 - 00:02:01.738, Speaker B: Nothing but we've had with european companies. We're trying to sell some deals. Some european companies right now, man, they're out. They're out all of August. It's insane to me.
00:02:01.834 - 00:02:07.670, Speaker A: I don't have food in my fridge. It's Thursday, it's holiday. There's the supermarkets are closed.
00:02:08.370 - 00:02:15.642, Speaker B: So I don't know what my chef, my chef left and my backup chef is not coming. And the third chef somehow hasn't shown up.
00:02:15.746 - 00:02:24.602, Speaker A: So I'm a simple man. My diet is like, I don't like having that type of stuff around. I like to just go to the fridge.
00:02:24.666 - 00:02:28.254, Speaker B: Speaking of food, I mean, I got roasted for eating lunch last week.
00:02:28.402 - 00:02:31.430, Speaker A: Well, that, I didn't want to say it, but yes, that was the guy.
00:02:31.510 - 00:02:43.222, Speaker B: One guy comments, I understand this is a free podcast, but can you please not eat your meatballs on the screen? And another guy goes, Jason, took literally 20 minutes to eat his lunch, which.
00:02:43.246 - 00:02:44.342, Speaker C: By the way, I don't think that's.
00:02:44.406 - 00:02:50.078, Speaker B: That long of a time to eat food. I'm just gonna put that out there. But I love the.
00:02:50.174 - 00:02:55.934, Speaker A: You know what it is. People are paying attention. The guy actually was like to the t. I was like, time stamped it.
00:02:55.982 - 00:02:57.454, Speaker B: Yeah, you know what? 20 minutes.
00:02:57.502 - 00:03:02.074, Speaker A: Yeah, I like it. Shout out to that guy. You know you're listening. I appreciate you, whoever you are. I appreciate you.
00:03:02.122 - 00:03:03.058, Speaker B: Someone called you trump.
00:03:03.114 - 00:03:07.386, Speaker A: Like, yeah, yeah, I saw that. It's like entitled background.
00:03:07.418 - 00:03:11.230, Speaker B: Said, you have an elite. You got access to an elite education. Where'd you go to college?
00:03:11.850 - 00:03:18.538, Speaker A: My safety school. Bu, Boston University, by the way, education.
00:03:18.634 - 00:03:20.106, Speaker B: No offense, but I feel like.
00:03:20.138 - 00:03:43.072, Speaker A: Yeah, I was gonna say, like I. First of all, I graduated early. I got a scholarship from JP Morgane called the launching leaders scholarship as a sophomore. So I'm gonna say I was the youngest of this entire program. I got it. And then I got into the investment bank, which, by the way, if you've been living under a rock, JP Morgan does not recruit at BU. So there's a later time.
00:03:43.072 - 00:03:44.384, Speaker A: I'll tell you a story of how I got in.
00:03:44.432 - 00:03:46.580, Speaker B: Actually, you don't want to.
00:03:47.080 - 00:04:06.860, Speaker A: I was an intern as a freshman actually, as well. And I was the only. They don't have a program for freshmen. They had to do it bespoke. So I had to crawl my way up to a place where I wanted to work because, you know, JPMorgan is the best investment bank along with Goldman. But I felt in the department that I wanted to be in the investment bank. It was the best and nothing was.
00:04:06.860 - 00:04:13.836, Speaker A: It was a lot of luck. But to say that it was handed down to me, like, you know, these rich kids that their dad calls like, hey, Jamie.
00:04:14.028 - 00:04:14.892, Speaker B: Hey, Jamie.
00:04:14.956 - 00:04:18.300, Speaker A: Hey, Jamie. Could you have my son intern in the investment bank?
00:04:18.420 - 00:04:20.604, Speaker B: I will say, though, there is a lot of not.
00:04:20.652 - 00:04:21.140, Speaker A: There is something.
00:04:21.220 - 00:04:26.218, Speaker B: But like I. Yeah, I mean, there is just a pipeline and the pipe.
00:04:26.394 - 00:04:38.482, Speaker A: Look, I mean, most of the interns, most of the interns come from like these particular schools where the MD comes from, Williams or Princeton or whatever. Yeah, it's super like that. I agree.
00:04:38.626 - 00:04:39.218, Speaker B: I remember.
00:04:39.314 - 00:04:41.818, Speaker A: Not here. We're not here to talk about investment banks.
00:04:41.954 - 00:04:56.252, Speaker B: This junior year internship, I was trying to get it on, the s and t internship at Goldman. I showed up, I was so fucking nervous. I was like, so sweaty and so nervous is like my first interview at like one of these bulge brackets and there's like all these, like, you know, straight out of Dartmouth?
00:04:56.356 - 00:04:56.732, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:04:56.796 - 00:05:07.572, Speaker B: Like, northeast boarding school. They went to lacrosse player, St. Paul's and Choate and all these schools, and, like, they're like, oh, yeah, I've got seven offers already. You know, I'm just doing this because, like, my uncle works here and I.
00:05:07.596 - 00:05:33.622, Speaker A: Want to, like, that was me, ladies and gentlemen, to be fair, my. The last thing I'll say in this point, which is there's a couple things that I care a lot about. Crypto is, one, two, nuclear energy, three, education. And my biggest frustration was, like, I was not allowed to take. There was an investment banking class in the business school at BU called. There was called investment banking. You could only take it as a senior.
00:05:33.622 - 00:05:36.670, Speaker A: And I'm like, that doesn't make sense.
00:05:36.790 - 00:05:39.406, Speaker B: Because all the internships are lined up junior year, which is.
00:05:39.598 - 00:06:06.330, Speaker A: Yeah, so I have to go to Harvard extension School across the river, across the Charles. I basically showed up, paid three k or whatever, two and a half k. And it was a graduate level course. They didn't care if I failed or passed the class, but that allowed me to be really prepped for the technical part of the interview. And then later on, the dean of BU, who'd worked at KKR, who's like, what can we do better? I'm like, I don't know. Let me fucking take the investment banking class if I want to. What do you care? It's my GPA.
00:06:06.330 - 00:06:17.770, Speaker A: And he's like, oh, well, you need. Of course, you know what? They do it right. They want you to be there for four fucking years, 50K semester. I'm like, I don't have that fucking money. It's a scam. You think crypto is a scam? No, no.
00:06:17.930 - 00:06:48.212, Speaker B: Actually, not to tie it all back to crypto, but the reason I do like crypto is I think there's the. I mean, at some point, the industry will get, like, tech and, like, Wall street and stuff, and they'll be feeders, and they'll be like, it'll get exclusive and stuff. Like, I mean, here's what you need to do if you want to go get a job in crypto. You create a Twitter account and you write some research, and you write twit Twitter threads once a week with your two page research report, and you break down a hot topic or a hot narrative. Do that for three to six months and someone will hire you. One of the programs.
00:06:48.236 - 00:06:49.200, Speaker A: Or you make money.
00:06:49.500 - 00:06:52.036, Speaker B: Yeah. Or go. I mean, trade and make.
00:06:52.108 - 00:06:54.200, Speaker A: I hired Nick.
00:06:54.700 - 00:06:55.444, Speaker B: Did you make that?
00:06:55.492 - 00:07:05.800, Speaker A: No, no. I hired Nick Chong at paraphy, and he was, I think in high school or, like, a senior in high school or just about to go to college. And I discovered him on Twitter.
00:07:05.920 - 00:07:13.792, Speaker B: Yeah. We made hires for our research analysts who are out of college. Like, they're in college, not. They haven't even graduated yet.
00:07:13.856 - 00:07:18.792, Speaker A: The beauty of open source systems is the truth of services like talent services. Faster. You don't need this transmission.
00:07:18.856 - 00:07:19.460, Speaker B: Eleven.
00:07:20.080 - 00:07:40.914, Speaker A: Yeah, that too. That's honestly one of the more inspiring, motivating things for me in these. In this open source system that is called crypto, that it really kind of transcends this, like, pedigree and all this crap, because I think it's bullshit. Credentials are important. The way we do it currently is not effective.
00:07:41.042 - 00:07:41.490, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:07:41.570 - 00:07:43.690, Speaker A: And crypto is much different.
00:07:43.810 - 00:07:45.266, Speaker B: Okay, here's a question for you.
00:07:45.378 - 00:07:45.762, Speaker A: Yep.
00:07:45.826 - 00:08:05.648, Speaker B: If you had kids, let's say you had, like, an 18 year old today. That's a scary thought. If you had an 18 year old today, would you send them to a public school, a private, and they were going to college, public school, private school, or home school? Or maybe the question is more about middle school and high school. I don't like, maybe just take out college, high school. But what would you do with your.
00:08:05.664 - 00:08:58.746, Speaker A: Kids education early on? I would like to homeschool them because I think that the current curriculum is very ineffective, meaning it's still memorization based and it doesn't stimulate. Like, if you're really talented in math or in writing, you should, like, really, really develop that talent. Why do you need to take all this other shit? Whereas I'd rather have my, like, if I had a rare skill like that, I'd want to be nurtured and fast tracked into, like, becoming the best at that, I think. And so I had the fortune of going to a liberal arts high school, if anything, like, the liberal arts, there's liberal arts type of education. And, like, memorization based. Liberal arts teaches you how to think. Question the scientific method.
00:08:58.746 - 00:09:20.538, Speaker A: All that's doing research. Like, it teaches you a process that, by the way, it's the same as investing. Right? And so I think the criticism of homeschool, because, you know, my sister has kids, and she's like, what do you know? You don't have kids. I'm like, I don't know. She's like, your kids are gonna be like, you're socially awkward. Your kids are gonna be ten times more socially awkward because they're homeschooled. I'm like, I screw that.
00:09:20.538 - 00:09:37.690, Speaker A: Like, you could actually, like, that's where hobbies are for, like, they could be in a sports league, you know, they could have friends. I appreciate it's on the margin, like, more challenging, it's more work, but I like to do it if they like it. But once they're older, it's up to them, really. I don't know. What would you do?
00:09:39.670 - 00:10:14.788, Speaker B: You're like, okay, this is how the uniswap curve works. This is how pool works. I would do, by the way, I mean, I say this with no kids. I think the dream. I think the best thing for k, for kids would be a homeschooling with a large group of parents who have kids in your, like, actually, I think this is best for parents too, is like living near a lot of friends. And like, I think we've totally lost, like, the element of community. So I think the best model is like, living near a bunch of your friends.
00:10:14.788 - 00:10:43.006, Speaker B: You guys all share your resources. You hire, like, I don't know, nannies together and you hire educators together as well. And maybe there's a group of like 20 or ten kids who do this together. That's, I think, the best model. The thing that, like, I mean, we, I'm sure there's all these parents, like, listening, being like, go fuck yourself listening to this. But I mean, I'm sure, I'm sure the amount of work that goes into that, it's like. And by the time you, you know, you have a five year old going to school or however they're old they are when they go to school, it's like, oh, my God.
00:10:43.006 - 00:10:50.294, Speaker B: Like, just, just put them in the school next to us because, like, I just need three. I need to walk them to work, to school for three minutes and then get to the office.
00:10:50.462 - 00:11:00.678, Speaker A: So, yeah, I've invested in ed tech is one of those areas where I love meeting people that are trying to reinvent it, but, you know, unfortunately, it's challenging. Right.
00:11:00.774 - 00:11:03.326, Speaker B: My wife, sister works in Edtech. It's a tough business.
00:11:03.518 - 00:11:10.492, Speaker A: It is. Yeah. Like Chegg kind of, but it's sort of marginal. Like renting books, but yeah, I think just read.
00:11:10.596 - 00:11:31.120, Speaker B: I read the new book by, yeah. Salman Khan. Oh, my God. What's the name of this book? Oh, brave new worlds. How AI will revolutionize education. Because my dad's doing some work in that world and it's a whole book about, like, how the education system will get flipped upside down. Actually, I didn't think it was a very good book, but.
00:11:31.120 - 00:11:43.380, Speaker B: Well, I thought it was good if you work in the school system and maybe you're not following, like chat GBT or anthropic or any of that stuff. But it did make you think, like, man, the way that our system works today, there's no way that'll work like that.
00:11:43.420 - 00:12:03.202, Speaker A: So I've learned more from, and I had the privilege of traveling that, like, I consider myself incredibly privileged because I was able. I was able to travel a lot. Not luxuriously, just travel a lot. My dad had a lot of time. He's self employed. To me, that is like the thing that has given me the most amount of education.
00:12:03.396 - 00:12:03.822, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:12:03.886 - 00:12:10.130, Speaker A: Going out, meeting new people, different cultures from a very early age, to me, that's invaluable, really.
00:12:11.430 - 00:12:32.140, Speaker B: So this is a crypto pod. Should we talk crypto? We've got, we got, we got rap BTC. There's some political stuff this week, and we got some eigen lair drama. So let's start with rap BTC because that's an easier conversation. Okay. So I think let's do this. I'm going to tee up the story.
00:12:32.140 - 00:12:59.380, Speaker B: Let me share the history of WBTC and talk about what it is. Then I'll talk about what happened this week with Bitgo and Justin sun and Tron and all the drama. And then I'd love to hear your take on it, because I think you were there in the early days of rap bitcoin and all that kind of stuff. Okay. So for people who don't know what rap bitcoin is, it basically is the w of WBTC is wrapped bitcoin. And it's a way to get bitcoin onto Ethereum. It's a way to use bitcoin and defi.
00:12:59.380 - 00:13:28.958, Speaker B: So you deposit your bitcoin, they lock it. Bit goes the custodian, they lock it. It's very transparent. And you get WBTC, and then you can actually move it onto Ethereum and do stuff with it. So the backstory of wrapped bitcoin is. And there's this great thread by Loy Lu at caliber build, and he's one of the founders of Kyber. Back in the day, back in 2018, a few months after they launched Kyber, which was on Ethereum, it was like very early Defi days.
00:13:28.958 - 00:13:47.702, Speaker B: There really weren't many alts or anything on Ethereum. The dex ecosystem was like a million a day in trading volume. There was no Kyber was like the first Dex. Kyber, was it? Yeah. So TvL was super low. I wouldn't be surprised if Aave was still called Ethel. And it was very early days, right.
00:13:47.702 - 00:14:11.562, Speaker B: And so they needed some liquidity into Defi. So the best way to get liquidity into Defi was by bringing bitcoin liquidity into Defi. So there were a couple of people. It was meow, who is the founder. People might know meow because he's one of the founders of Jupiter. And there was Victor Tron, who's one of the other co founders of Kyber, and Euron Velner, I think was the fourth guy. It was like this was the crew.
00:14:11.562 - 00:14:47.824, Speaker B: And they were really excited about this. And so they ended up linking up with this guy, Ben. What's Ben's last name? Benedict Chan, who at the time was the CTO of bitgo. He's now the vp of engineering at Chainlink. And tell me if I get any of these facts wrong. But they met up, they shared the problem with Ben, who was at Bitgo, and they basically said, look, let's work with a centralized custodian model to keep this super simple and avoid any hidden technical smart contract risks. And so they ended up creating this thing called wrapped bitcoin and custodying the bitcoin with Bitgo.
00:14:47.824 - 00:15:21.042, Speaker B: And I remember when this happened, there's actually a really fun. It kind of flashed me back of like, the part of the announcement of this. It was like gnosis and compound and blockfolio Im token, Omisego, like Dharma maker, all these like, air swap, if you remember, airswap. Like all these old school defi people kind of announced this thing. And so the plan was that. So it was between Kyber and Bitgo. They didnt call it like Kyber Coin or Bitgo BTC or anything like that.
00:15:21.042 - 00:15:51.686, Speaker B: They wanted it to be a public good, which was really cool. It was this neutral brand wrapped bitcoin. No one owned the project. Bitgo was going to manage a lot of the off chain technical and legal work, like minting and burning process, integrating it with bitco custody and setting up this transparency dashboard, which at the time was basically one of the first proof of reserves things different members of the team were doing, marketing and all that kind of stuff. So fast forward to today. That was 2018, six years later. Wrapped bitcoin is huge.
00:15:51.686 - 00:16:07.430, Speaker B: It has around 9 billion, I think. Nine. Nine and a half billion in TvO. And, excuse me, in TVL. It is now the de facto bitcoin token on Ethereum and other EVM chains. So I'll pause there. Good.
00:16:07.430 - 00:16:38.528, Speaker B: Summary questions? Keep going. All right, keep going. So today, how it works is Bitgo is the custodian. There's all this transparent stuff and it's domiciled in the US and it's really like it's a bit go thing and Bitgo importantly doesn't do anything with the bitcoin. When you send the bitcoin to bitgo they keep in a total separate like custody trust, nobody touches it. They don't do like any Genesis style lending of it. So bitgo manages all this money or bitcoin but they dont actually do anything with it.
00:16:38.528 - 00:17:39.955, Speaker B: If you think about that from a business model perspective theyre not actually making any money on that bitcoin. So what happened earlier this week is that bitgo, who is currently the sole custodian and backer of WBTC, published a blog post announcing that in I think October its going to form a strategic partnership with Bit Global. Bit Global is a Justin sun company. Justin sun is the founder of Tron that's based in Hong Kong. So if you dig into the details and the reason people freaked out so much is the partnership consists of giving bit global access to two of the three WBTC private keys. So now instead of having the private keys in the US with Bitgo, you now have two of the three keys with with Justin Sun's company and domiciled in I think one is in Hong Kong and one is going to be in Singapore. So right after that people on crypto Twitter freaked out.
00:17:39.955 - 00:18:29.334, Speaker B: Then Makerdao's risk team came out. They wrote a post a day after the announcement proposing that WBTC be delisted as a collateral asset. Belshi jumps in on the forums. He responds I can talk, I can talk about his responses in a sec because I think there's some good things they said and some bad things. Then there was this Twitter spaces where Belshi and Justin sun were both interviewed by Meow. Again the founder of Jupiter also involved in the creation of WBTC and I think some quotes were important here and then ill shut up because im rambling here. But Meow basically pressed Belshi, who I have a ridiculous amount of respect for just for building this crypto company for eleven years but he pressed him on the question of whether bit global could mint or move the underlying bitcoin treasury on a unilateral basis because now they have two or three of the keys.
00:18:29.334 - 00:18:54.588, Speaker B: So he said is it possible that there's no one single party that has the capability to mint or move the funds? And Mike responds, I don't want to quite answer the question but let me give you a couple points around it. Every security system has a weak point. Just because that exists doesn't mean you have to change it right now. Maybe it can be changed in the future. That's one red flag in my mind. The second is I think he just kind of like. His response for the partnership was kind of flimsy.
00:18:54.588 - 00:19:40.616, Speaker B: He said it's the reason for it was jurisdictional decentralization as a big reason for that. And actually, on one hand I'm like, oh yeah, the US is cracking down, but on the other hand I'm like, I don't know, you're moving it to Hong Kong, who's been, like, very anti bitcoin over the years. Right now is pro, but historically has been kind of anti. I don't really understand how that location improves your jurisdictional decentralization. And then the last thing, and then I'll shut up is I think it was around like 40, 45 minutes in. Belshi says that WBTC isn't a profit center for Bitgo. And then, so Meow says, is Bitgo receiving any monetary benefits for the partnership with Justin sun and Belshi kind of gave this non answer about securing the space better, and then the call ended.
00:19:40.616 - 00:20:00.310, Speaker B: So I guess I'll close it by saying, like, I have a insane amount of respect and trust in Bitgo and in Mike Belshi and their firm as a whole. But I really don't understand this decision and I have some concerns. But again, I've been talking for a while. What do you think about this? And then I can share my thoughts.
00:20:02.410 - 00:20:44.270, Speaker A: Very much the same. I don't want to jump to conclusions, but the two points that you raised are concerning. And I think that given all the precedent in the space, like, you'd rather play it safe. And I think you move fast when there is smoke, because typically when there's smoke, there's fire. And I don't know, the idea of not being very forthcoming with the question around, can you mint unilaterally the jurisdictional decentralization doesn't matter. It's like there's two parties here that can collude and can, you know, act maliciously. That's it.
00:20:44.270 - 00:20:57.690, Speaker A: That's all you need to know. Like, I'm not going to trust. Like, I understand. I'll give people the, you know, the benefit of the doubt, but I'm not going to risk my funds there. And I think it's not the right setup. There are. There is a better way to do this.
00:20:57.690 - 00:21:19.428, Speaker A: And you're left wondering, like, why wouldn't you do it that way? You know what I mean? Like, why? Why would you. I can't think of an argument of. Of why it would make sense because it degrades all trust in the product that has been working, as you said, for a while. Like it is, it is pretty embedded. It's been used for a long. It has a good track record. Like I just.
00:21:19.428 - 00:21:51.978, Speaker A: I just can't understand why they would do. Why they would do it this way. And for that reason I'm just, you know, I understand the, the kind of very. The reaction from Aker, right? Yeah, like of course I would do, I would do the same. Like we've had enough bullshit with FTX and other stuff to risk and WBTC is something that is pretty embedded. I want to call it like super systemic. Right.
00:21:51.978 - 00:21:55.426, Speaker A: But it's like 10% of the collateral, right. For Maker, I think last time I checked.
00:21:55.458 - 00:21:58.346, Speaker B: Yeah, it's 10% of dies backing. Yeah.
00:21:58.458 - 00:21:59.250, Speaker A: That's a lot.
00:21:59.370 - 00:22:00.030, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:22:01.250 - 00:22:02.310, Speaker A: What do you think?
00:22:03.610 - 00:22:31.800, Speaker B: Um, I think a lot of. Yeah, I mean, a lot of this comes down to Justin Sun's reputation too. Like if you were part. I mean, if they were partnering with someone else, I don't know, imagine you partner with like circle or something and it's like, oh, we're sharing the keys with Circle. Like I think they just have a better reputation. I mean, there was some like weird proof of reserve stuff with. Remember Justin sun? They bought Poloniex actually from circle, from Jeremy.
00:22:31.800 - 00:23:00.710, Speaker B: And then they had, I think they tried creating their own TBTC or like rap BTC product and then there was some like really weird proof of reserve stuffs going on. So I think there's definitely like a. Just a reputation thing. And actually this is what Belshi said in his response. He said, this seems to be more of a reaction to the Justin sun name than to the facts. And so I need to go read Belshi's whole, whole post. But I don't know.
00:23:00.710 - 00:23:32.960, Speaker B: Here's what I'm looking for is are they going to just keep the bitcoin sitting there? Because there's a shit ton of money to be made if you lend out that bitcoin, right? There's a crazy. There's $400 million a year to be made if you go lend out that bitcoin at only 4%. So that's $400 million sitting there where someone can really easily convince someone, hey, there's, there's $400 million sitting here. Let's just go lend it out in a really safe way at 4%.
00:23:33.080 - 00:23:35.040, Speaker A: Trust me, bro, it's gonna, it's gonna work.
00:23:35.160 - 00:23:43.340, Speaker B: Like everyone's lending out at 8%, 10%. Let's just, let's just do something safe at 4%. And that is what I'm concerned about.
00:23:45.270 - 00:24:17.096, Speaker A: The operating assumption in crypto should always be that the most economic people act in the self interest. And if there's a sufficiently large economic opportunity, most people will take it and they will act short, like, they will take it. And so you have to design systems that the default and the correct kind of the acting correctly is also the most economically favorable outcome.
00:24:17.248 - 00:24:18.032, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:24:18.216 - 00:24:47.102, Speaker A: Elon tweeted, actually something to this effect, which is you here. I'll try to find it. Don't kill me here. And we can, here's a quote. A society should make the right things easy and the wrong things hard. And I think that gets to the core of how you design a blockchain or any system for that matter.
00:24:47.246 - 00:25:17.892, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think there's also a bigger technical question here, which is, hey, this is a pretty old school method. This was created six years ago. Like, we're just sending, like, even just holding it at bitgo. Like, I mean, that's not, if something happens to bitgo, that's 10 billion just poof. Right. And then there's the question of like, okay, what's after that? It's like, well, there's like on chain bridges, but I think there's probably the end state of this is like canonical bridges or validating bridges.
00:25:17.892 - 00:25:43.640, Speaker B: And like, if you, if you. I haven't really dug into this, but I was reading one research report about like the BitVM and OpCat unlocking, like these trust minimized wrapping of BTC using validated bridges. I think it was way Dai from one Kx was posting about this. And I think that's a good point, which is like, what we're doing now is just Band aid over what should existed long term.
00:25:44.060 - 00:25:51.720, Speaker A: Well, the other point is Coinbase, I think is jumping at this opportunity. They are promoting CB BTC.
00:25:52.060 - 00:26:01.358, Speaker B: They had a brilliant marketing move. I love this. They just tweeted, no blog posts, nothing. They just tweeted CB BTC.
00:26:01.534 - 00:26:06.030, Speaker A: Yeah. And that's basically the same mechanism. But you're trusting Coinbase.
00:26:06.110 - 00:26:38.194, Speaker B: All right, so what are your predictions with Coinbase? With, with Coinbase wrapped bitcoin? So, so Dan Ellitz are actually, let me give you, let's start with a, over, under Dan Ellitzer's thing. So Dan Elitzer goes, where'd his tweet just disappeared? Oh boy. Ah, okay. CBDC was CB, BTC was inevitable and super strategic to Coinbase. Frankly, I'm surprised they didn't ship this years ago. My predictions, a zero fees on mint, redeem b zero fees to withdraw to base. Super smart, by the way.
00:26:38.194 - 00:26:44.070, Speaker B: And c. It'll pass WBTC in supply within six months of launching.
00:26:44.610 - 00:26:45.466, Speaker A: Yes.
00:26:45.658 - 00:26:47.394, Speaker B: You think? Okay, that's interesting.
00:26:47.482 - 00:26:48.530, Speaker A: I agree with that take.
00:26:48.650 - 00:26:49.266, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:26:49.418 - 00:26:52.706, Speaker A: I mean, the distribution of coinbase is massive.
00:26:52.738 - 00:26:55.190, Speaker B: Would. Would you wrap your bitcoin and put it on chain?
00:26:57.810 - 00:27:02.070, Speaker A: Um, depends.
00:27:04.650 - 00:27:05.390, Speaker B: On.
00:27:08.410 - 00:27:11.930, Speaker A: Uh. Depends on. I don't know, like, I don't.
00:27:11.970 - 00:27:13.594, Speaker B: Here's what it depends on for me.
00:27:13.682 - 00:27:44.082, Speaker A: There's the yield opportunity, I guess. And you're going to compare that to, like, other stuff in bitcoin? I'm going to get ahead of the criticism here, folks, because I've seen in some chats, why would you even move it to a shit network like ethereum? I'm like, well, you did deposit your money in Celsius and, you know, some other centralized providers, but some of the other, like, Babylon and that stuff arguably has more risk, just has less Lindy. Right. Than some, like, ethereum. Of course you're trusting the. It all comes down to the nuance.
00:27:44.106 - 00:27:47.870, Speaker B: Of, wait, wait, wait, wait. Babylon has less risk than putting something on?
00:27:49.170 - 00:28:10.842, Speaker A: If you can go and test all these experimental l two s or side chains that are cropping up in the bitcoin ecosystem. And your argument is, I'm not going to move it to Ethereum, but I like the yield, so I'm going to use it in like a native. Like a bitcoin l two. I'm like, I don't know. I would argue that it's safer to do it through Coinbase, wrap bitcoin and then moving it to, you know.
00:28:10.946 - 00:28:27.210, Speaker B: Yeah. So here's my prediction. This is the start of every single exchange doing this. Everyone's basically just said, like, you know what? Bitgo kind of has this. WBTC, we don't want to do anything. It's the start of every single exchange doing it. Kraken will do it, OKX will do it, binance will do it, Coinbase will do it.
00:28:27.250 - 00:28:29.122, Speaker A: You need to have a custodian arm, right?
00:28:29.266 - 00:28:51.012, Speaker B: Yeah. So Gemini has a custodian arm. Coinbase has a custodian arm. Kraken made an acquisition of a custodian, didn't they? Maybe, yeah, maybe. I don't know. So anyways, I think that's the start of that. And some of them are going to play it safe and they won't lend out that bitcoin.
00:28:51.012 - 00:29:22.360, Speaker B: And then other people are going to say, hey, to add $10 billion, 4%, that's $400 million. I'm a public company, or I'm trying to go public or I'm trying to raise my series D. That's $400 million we're leaving on the table. I've got my board breathing down my neck. Turn that on and something like that will end poorly. So that's one prediction. The second thing I'd be looking for is not just the yield opportunities, but I don't know if you can see my screen right now, but they've done a phenomenal job at the proof of reserves.
00:29:22.360 - 00:29:40.222, Speaker B: Bitgo has done a great job. So you can actually track everything happening. If you look at the screen right here, August 14, you can see crypto.com pulling out 100. Whatever, 100. Wbtc crypto.com pulling out 150.
00:29:40.222 - 00:29:47.958, Speaker B: Crypto.com pulling out 100. Galaxy pulling out 73. Crypto.com doing their one BTC test. That's funny. You can see it right here.
00:29:47.958 - 00:30:07.544, Speaker B: So you can see everything and you can see it on chain and you can see the funds sent to the merchant and the burn completed and all of that stuff. Coinbase. So some of the exchanges have done a really good job with proof of exchanges. Like, actually, OKX, I think, has done a great job with proof of proof of reserves, Coinbase actually doesn't. Yeah, they don't do that today.
00:30:07.632 - 00:30:12.928, Speaker A: The argument's always been some of those security. For security reasons.
00:30:13.024 - 00:30:24.904, Speaker B: Right. But I would hope that actually, for a product like this, they would do it. I doubt they will because people trust Coinbase enough and they have a trustworthy enough brand, and I just don't think they'll do it. But I would really, as a user, like to see them do it.
00:30:25.032 - 00:30:31.610, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. But anyways notwithstanding, I agree with your prediction. Every exchange, probably, that has a custodian arm will do this.
00:30:31.730 - 00:30:36.630, Speaker B: Yeah. Um. All right. Should we talk politics?
00:30:37.850 - 00:30:39.230, Speaker A: Uh, yeah.
00:30:40.130 - 00:30:43.850, Speaker B: Well, we don't have to. We don't. We definitely don't have to.
00:30:43.970 - 00:30:49.290, Speaker A: But what do you want to talk about? The odds? Just flipping. Um, the great flipping, actually.
00:30:49.330 - 00:30:57.224, Speaker B: I wasn't even thinking about that. It has been funny seeing everyone say prediction markets are the next big great thing. They're the greatest innovation in society since.
00:30:57.272 - 00:30:58.752, Speaker C: Blah, blah, blah, since sliced bread.
00:30:58.856 - 00:31:11.240, Speaker B: And then now that, you know, Kamala is beating Trump on poly market or. I don't know if that's still the case because I haven't checked this week, but people are like, prediction markets are rigged. They're a completely mechanism for guilty is charged. Yeah.
00:31:11.400 - 00:31:25.870, Speaker A: So it is possible, right? I mean, I simply ask the question, what is possible that if you, if you've raised, you know, hundreds of millions of dollars for your campaign. It doesn't take much to move the market.
00:31:26.450 - 00:31:30.350, Speaker B: Oh, you think that they're putting, you think that they're putting their foot on the lever here?
00:31:31.530 - 00:32:09.236, Speaker A: I mean, it's, I don't think it's a 0% probability, but is it greater than 50? Probably not. But my argument, it's reflexive, right? There's this dynamic that if you're a voter and you see the odds skew really in favor of a particular candidate, then there's, like, this apathy component, like, say, I'm not gonna vote because it's already a done deal. Right. And so if you were Trump supporting, you see that the odds are now really flipped marginally. I think it influences certain people, like, this dynamic around, like voter apathy or just voters not voting for this reason, I think is real. And so it becomes this reflexive dynamic. Right.
00:32:09.236 - 00:32:33.324, Speaker A: If you're in the campaign, you put money in polymarket, you bet on Kamala. That moves the odds from 40 to 70 or something. It doesn't take much money to do that, by the way. In the grand scheme of things, people are looking at that and be like, it matters. It's driving a conversation. And the criticism that I heard on my tweet was like, you're an idiot, bro. Polls have been a thing for a while.
00:32:33.324 - 00:32:49.330, Speaker A: I'm like, I'm not talking fucking polls. You know, it is a prediction market. So there's money on the line, and that carries more weight. And I think it's far more influential than a poll. There's more signal there, arguably. So that was my point. I mean, I think it.
00:32:49.330 - 00:33:15.840, Speaker A: And to say that, like, polymarket is only, like, you know, is not visible and only people in crypto, Twitter are paying attention is also not correct. I mean, the Wall Street Journal just is referencing this data. Major news publications are referencing data on the daily. So whoever, like, I just want to push back on that criticism. So there is some possibility. I still think prediction markets are good.
00:33:16.420 - 00:33:19.900, Speaker B: I mean, I'm just saying it's funny that people thought it was the best thing since sliced bread.
00:33:19.940 - 00:33:24.600, Speaker A: No one was saying it still is, though. Like, it's better than media, it's better than polls.
00:33:25.940 - 00:33:45.160, Speaker B: I think it serves a purpose. It's really good at quantifying outcomes at a large. At a large enough size. The problem is all these markets are too small. Like, if you're saying that they're not that small. Yeah, but if you're saying the campaign can just, like, move the market by, like, you know, throwing a million bucks into it. Like, that's a, that's too small of a market.
00:33:45.280 - 00:34:06.958, Speaker A: The counter argument to this is like, a sophisticated financial player might look at that and say, okay, this is clearly made. This is clearly a big actor trying to inflict play like this, that it has a non economic incentive. Right. They're willing to, like, burn this money. So if you're a savvy financial player, you'd be like, I see that. And the odds has become juicier. Right.
00:34:06.958 - 00:34:56.866, Speaker A: And so you're going to bet on Trump now, and the payoff is greater so that the market equilibrium should. There is, that's the nuance here. There is a party that might look at prediction markets and have a non economic incentive, like a state actor that is willing to burn that money, so to speak, and influence the odds because it may drive for non monetary reasons, for driving the conversation, and that becomes reflexive and has second order effects. But in theory, you should have financial people that look at that and say, okay, the odds are clearly skewed here and, well, balance it out. I would like to see more analysis on the transactions, the size of the transaction, the origin of the transaction.
00:34:56.938 - 00:35:11.430, Speaker B: Here's the thing. There's no way that the, if the Harris campaign or the Trump campaign is, there's no way they're sophisticated enough on chain to be able to hide that it was them. So, like, I. So we should, we got to call it chain analysis here to figure this one out.
00:35:12.090 - 00:35:13.218, Speaker A: Yeah. In theory.
00:35:13.314 - 00:35:24.350, Speaker B: Here's, here's a weird societal question for you. Do you think it should be legal to bet on yourself in a, in a prediction market?
00:35:25.770 - 00:35:35.590, Speaker A: I was thinking about that, actually. People do it, right? Boxers do it. They bet against themselves or they bet.
00:35:36.210 - 00:35:37.778, Speaker B: No, that's illegal.
00:35:37.874 - 00:35:38.554, Speaker A: Is it?
00:35:38.682 - 00:35:44.658, Speaker B: I think. I mean, that's why Pete Rose got kicked out of the game of baseball. Oh, not boxing, though. I don't fall boxing.
00:35:44.714 - 00:35:48.178, Speaker A: I think in boxing, like, I remember, like, I think you can.
00:35:48.314 - 00:35:53.710, Speaker B: Oh, in baseball, you certainly can't. Shoeless Joe Jackson rip.
00:35:55.250 - 00:36:03.430, Speaker A: I think it depends on, on the type of, on the thing you're betting on. Right. It doesn't feel right.
00:36:04.690 - 00:36:15.988, Speaker B: So because it technically gets to a more efficient market faster, it technically gets the truth out into the public faster if you do that. But it, but it feels really wrong.
00:36:16.044 - 00:36:17.732, Speaker A: You would have to disclose it. Maybe.
00:36:17.876 - 00:36:49.182, Speaker B: But, like, like Biden before he stepped down. Well, is it a fair thing this would have gotten let, like, this would have. Is it fair for Biden to basically just put down a big old bet on himself? That Biden was going to drop out because the fair market people would argue that, like deregulation and fair market people would argue that, yes, it's totally fine for him to do that because it brings truth out into the light. But then the, you see the problem with it.
00:36:49.366 - 00:37:19.770, Speaker A: Okay, yeah, I think there's a nuance here. Like I'm looking at. Boxing allows it. You can bet on yourself, you can bet against yourself to hedge your winning your purse on a binary outcome. Either you win or you lose. You're not allowed to bet on more discrete things, like, for instance, the number of rounds you could still win, and then you know you're going to win. But if you bet it's going to be more than four rounds, then you're going to drag it out.
00:37:19.770 - 00:38:05.930, Speaker A: And so that feels more easily manipulate, like easy to manipulate. The thing about Biden, in that extreme scenario, he might bet against himself, for instance, is the airdrop going to no different than you work at a company, there's these markets on. Is the airdrop going to happen before x date? I don't think you should be able to do that because you can influence that. Or if you're betting, then you have to excuse yourself from that. But if you're a decision maker, you shouldn't be allowed to do that. It's a gray area for sure. Yeah, I think it's something, something for me, in the scenario of a boxer, win or lose doesn't feel as, I have less issue with that.
00:38:05.930 - 00:38:42.150, Speaker A: Unless of course, like you'd be like, do you care about your reputation? Do you care about your standings? Do you write, that would be the counter argument if this is last fight of the guy and he bet against himself, you know, I mean, like, it might be, I don't know if it's a repeatable game in theory. Like, people should be able to do it, but not on more discreet, not a more discrete things. Binary, yes, not discreet, but I don't know, it gets to the heart of like insider information and manipulation, markets and all that stuff.
00:38:44.340 - 00:39:19.046, Speaker C: Hey, everyone. Jason here. I wanted to talk about something that's been on my mind a lot recently, and that is, where are all of Crypto's killer apps? We often ask this question on this show. So I'm excited to tell you about Empire's latest partner, Anoma, the universal intent machine. Intents are a new way to build dapps, enabling users to say what they want without needing to specify how it's done. Let's say you have an NFT on one chain, but you want to swap it for a token on another chain. To make things even worse, you also don't know which bridge to trust or how to navigate different Dexs on each chain.
00:39:19.046 - 00:39:52.974, Speaker C: Disaster, right? But here's the good news. Thanks to intents, you can just tell the app what you want to do, and Anoma's solver network takes care of all the complexity in the background. We're excited to see what cool dapps Anoma's architecture will unlock. To stay up to date with Anoma. You can follow them@x.com anoma or sign up for the newsletter@anoma.net dot special thanks to Anoma for sponsoring today's episode hey everyone, I wanted to take a second to talk about Real a permissionless l two for tokenized real world assets on arbitrum orbit.
00:39:52.974 - 00:40:43.094, Speaker C: What's really cool about real is that it uses the off chain yields from RWAs as a sustainable solution for native liquidity incentives. Real is also the first l two, where 100% of profits from transaction fees and fees from protocols accrue back to the l two s governance token. RWA Real has just launched their rewards program, where 10% of the RWA supply is being given away to early users of the chain. Users can provide concentrated liquidity, trade, borrow and leverage tokenized real world assets, including t bills, real estate and tokenized basis trades. Just as a quick disclaimer, this is not investment advice or product solicitation and not aimed at us persons. Find out more at Re al Rewards. Special thanks to real for sponsoring today's episode.

00:42:19.540 - 00:42:53.438, Speaker B: All right, let's get into the politics stuff. So Alex Thorne posted. Alex Thorne shout out legend head of research at Galaxy. New evidence that Kamala Harris will continue crypto crackdown. Her advisor choices suggest that she will keep Biden's hostile attitude to crypto. Harris is working with Brian Deese and Virat Rama Murdy, who are two key anti crypto officials from the Biden admin, and he posted this, this thread about it and shout out. Bloomberg, I think, had done this reporting for those who don't know.
00:42:53.438 - 00:43:25.388, Speaker B: So what's the guy's first name? Brian Deese and Barat are kind of two architects of the Biden administration's anti crypto crusade. And specifically, I think Barat was one of the main guys behind choke. .2.0 so there was a lot of, I mean, like, you know, we've tried to stay out of this, but like, you know, Mike posted. What did Mike Post? I thought Mike said something pretty well. I should have pulled this up beforehand. This is really disappointing to see.
00:43:25.388 - 00:43:50.470, Speaker B: I don't care about political theater, but appointments like this will have very real consequences to our industry. I still can't. I still believe the best out for. I still believe the best outcome for crypto is to be neutral. But I can't ignore what's right in front of me. Ryan Sean Adams said Bharat was an architect of Chokepoint 2.0. If Kamala Harris populates her administration with anti crypto people like Bharat, her administration will be anti crypto.
00:43:50.470 - 00:44:15.056, Speaker B: It's that simple. Extremely disappointing, but also a very clear message. Nick Carter said Harris appears to be Warren 2.0. Barat equals it's over. Over. And then Austin Campbell, who I think has had very clear summaries of a lot of what's going on, he said, this is rather unfortunate, but I'm forced to agree with Alex here. If the Harris administration is going to continue Operation Choke, .2.0
00:44:15.056 - 00:44:44.642, Speaker B: it's impossible to support them from an ethical standpoint. And I say that as a Democrat, unless you believe administrations should be able to pick winners and losers to get banking access, depending on their preferences. This is a nonstarter for me. And if you do believe that, you'll believe it's okay for a future Trump administration to designate things like green energy producers and public sector unions as high risk industries that should be debanked. Right. I will say I personally don't believe this is okay. Just like I don't believe it's okay to be doing this to crypto at some point.
00:44:44.642 - 00:45:31.060, Speaker B: It's my hope that the us political scene returns to a belief in civic norms rather than unrestricted warfare at all costs through the system that are hollowing out the rule of law and core rights of Americans. And I mean that about all sides. So this is, I mean, you know, I've been very optimistic that the democratic administration, Harris, or whatever you want to call it, would come out and whether it's Novogratz or Cuban or Scaramucci or someone would have the sway to kind of show her that this is like, why are you staying anti crypto? And I really was very optimistic that they would turn their stance and go pro crypto. But, yeah, I mean, this was, this was pretty disappointing to see. I'll say.
00:45:31.360 - 00:45:38.008, Speaker A: Looks like a duck, swims like a duck, quacks like a duck, probably is a duck.
00:45:38.104 - 00:45:41.380, Speaker B: It's a frog. It's a frog. It's a frog.
00:45:42.080 - 00:46:11.866, Speaker A: Yeah. I don't know what else to say. I mean, I think I've been surprised by the, the odds in poly market and predict it and even eight silver. I've had a lot of conversations around it. I think the market is responding in real time to that. And you read Arthur Hayes latest post. The sentiment is, hey, probably sit it out for a bit until the election unfolds.
00:46:11.866 - 00:47:07.530, Speaker A: And then there's some relief rally, mostly driven by monetary policy, nothing more than that, less so around the stance of a particular administration towards the industry. We've been in the current environment for a while. And so I go back to what I said in the last pod, which is, I think I've looked past whoever will win, and I'm just more optimistic for the Chevron case that peels back administrative power to some extent. I go back to court findings and rulings for particular crypto cases, the ETF approvals. That didn't happen and weren't easy. It was a long road shout out to everyone that was involved, but you basically had to sue to get this product out. And I think that for that particular reason, I think that the train sort of has left the station.
00:47:07.530 - 00:47:54.030, Speaker A: This has become a big industry. It's become an asset class in its own right. You have Larry Finks of the world supporting it, believing in it, and I think, is it perfect? No. Do we need to get. We need rulemaking, whoever comes into power, we just need the administrator, we need the legislative branch to put forth rulemaking for this industry. That is sensible. I hope that with the Chevron case now, in effect, that the people within the agencies that actually do the work actually draft these things that you can.
00:47:54.030 - 00:48:25.460, Speaker A: That there isn't enough of a roadblock simply because it's just time to have rules for an industry that is this big, that has been around for such a long time. And I think time is on our side. So if you were to. Let me ask you a question. How would you. If you were to plot the degree of hostility towards crypto on a chart, how would you. How would you describe that graph?
00:48:27.560 - 00:48:30.060, Speaker B: What's the X axis? What's the y?
00:48:31.400 - 00:48:43.532, Speaker A: The X axis is time since inception. The Y axis is hostility. The greater you go, there's more hostility from zero to 100 index. So zero to 100 being, you know, this is.
00:48:43.676 - 00:49:13.690, Speaker B: Where are we and how will it go exactly? I think we're probably at, like, a 70. I think there will be a. I think for crypto to win and for bitcoin to win, there will probably be a. Actually, I think a lot of it depends on the selection. I think there could be a massive global government level crackdown that we've never seen before. You know, who didn't come after us this past cycle was the treasury. Right.
00:49:13.690 - 00:49:24.390, Speaker B: Treasury can basically shut down self custody. And so I think there's. Yeah, I don't think it's. I think it's very possible that it gets much worse.
00:49:25.280 - 00:49:34.552, Speaker A: So you're saying we're at 70. Where have we been before? How does that line. Just, what does a progression look like? And I'm pressing on the progression of this line over time.
00:49:34.616 - 00:50:05.110, Speaker B: Like, what could it. What could it be? What could it look like? I mean, at one point in the United States, they banned citizens from holding gold. But a hundred years ago, they made all the citizens. What was it? Act 60112, whatever it was called? I think it was FDR or someone around that time forced every single us citizen to walk over to the banks and. Or to the government agencies and to the credit unions or wherever it was, and turn in their gold. And they came and they tried to figure out if you were holding gold and you had to turn it all in. Right.
00:50:05.110 - 00:50:27.294, Speaker B: And at some point, if bitcoin becomes a threat, to, let's say bitcoin becomes a threat to the us dollar. I mean you better believe they're banning bitcoin. They're making it illegal for us citizens to hold bitcoin. I think that's a, I think. I'm not saying this administration, I'm just saying at some point I think. I think that's a, that is by.
00:50:27.302 - 00:50:58.300, Speaker A: The way that has always been a risk. That's why I care about the progression over time. It's the marginal change that I care about and what drives markets. It's not the point in time, it's, it's a mar, it's a derivative. And what I'm saying is I think we've peaked and the more time, I've always felt that the more time that we have for this industry to grow naturally that comes down. This is not like the hostility. The hostility could still be very high.
00:50:58.300 - 00:51:49.216, Speaker A: The repercussion of that hostility. I think the more time we've had for this industry to grow that particular systemic risk that you described which is probably one of the biggest ones has come down. I think this is too big. You can do it, but it's too big and it's decentralized. China's tried to do this and India's tried to do this. The US is a different animal, I get it but it would be a big unwinding and I can't understand the incentive to do that without the kind of repercussion. And so I would say the graph for me looks like hostility varying low 2030 percolating the synergies grows and then in the last couple of years much higher right chokepoint being the peak and I think that was the peak.
00:51:49.216 - 00:52:20.200, Speaker A: I think the particular moments of ETF, the ripple case, the bit wise, not the bitwise, the grayscale case all of those were kind of the peak. And now irrespective of the administration the graphs going forward might look very different and that slope of decline might look very different but even if it remains constant, I just think it doesn't remain constant. I think we've peaked and we're going down.
00:52:20.240 - 00:52:21.500, Speaker B: Yeah. Interesting.
00:52:22.080 - 00:53:00.306, Speaker A: Then the second chart is the potential impact of said hostility. I think irrespective of the. What makes the US such a great democracy and the probably the best political system in the world is that the system works and it transcends a particular figure. That is not the case in other places where a particular government official like the three branches of government actually are very balanced. And that I think makes the US the most sound democratic system in the world where rule of law stands.
00:53:00.418 - 00:53:00.876, Speaker B: Right.
00:53:00.978 - 00:53:03.488, Speaker A: And I don't think that's going away anytime soon.
00:53:03.584 - 00:53:10.384, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you see it even when the SEC comes down on someone. Yeah. You have to spend a lot in legal bills, but the courts challenge, like.
00:53:10.552 - 00:53:14.384, Speaker A: How many times have we said it in this podcast? Have faith in the courts. If you, if you've lost faith in.
00:53:14.392 - 00:53:18.088, Speaker B: The courts, then you got a bigger, then. Yeah. Then you got a big problem.
00:53:18.184 - 00:53:19.920, Speaker A: Forget about crypto. We got a bigger problem on our hands.
00:53:19.960 - 00:53:21.440, Speaker B: Yeah. So that's.
00:53:21.480 - 00:53:47.696, Speaker A: I don't want to, I want to, as I said before, I think we spent too much time thinking about government. I think it's incredibly important. I do agree with you. I think this, this particular election result is going to be very critical as to how that line progresses because it could be a very big decline, as it sounds with one administration, and it could be probably more of the same with another. And it would be nice to have the former, not the latter.
00:53:47.808 - 00:53:53.192, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay, Eigen game time. We had to do the 50 minutes warmup.
00:53:53.256 - 00:53:54.580, Speaker A: We saved the best for last.
00:53:55.040 - 00:54:08.630, Speaker B: Well, we could also talk about shared sequencers, but we can skip that. But I am not piled. Okay, great reporting by Sam Kessler and Danny Nelson.
00:54:09.610 - 00:54:11.266, Speaker A: Coindesk does it again.
00:54:11.458 - 00:54:46.364, Speaker B: Yeah. Top crypto startup drove other projects airdrops to its employees. So I'm just going to read some of the stories, some of the highlights. Eigenlabs circulated a list of team members wallets, addresses to Eigen layer ecosystem projects that were preparing to issue tokens. Some teams asked for it, at least one didn't. So let me just read they have four bullets is like the highlights of the story. Eigenlabs, the developer of restaking juggernaut Eigen layer, distributed a list of employee wallet addresses to ecosystem projects preparing to launch crypto tokens.
00:54:46.364 - 00:55:20.960, Speaker B: Some teams said they asked Eigenlabs for the list, but one said it didn't and felt pressured by the company to send its employees tokens. Experts and insiders say the payouts, worth nearly 5 million at peak prices, raise conflict of interest concerns. By the way, at peak prices. It's like way, way, way down from that. Just to flag that. Eigen Labs and the nonprofit Eigen foundation have since banned such payouts to employees. So on one side of the spectrum, and I'm going to ask you where you fall on this, on one side of the spectrum is this is insane behavior.
00:55:20.960 - 00:55:37.580, Speaker B: Completely disgusting. Sriram should be out of. I'm going as far to the left on the side of the spectrum. Sriram should be out as CEO. This is the second kind of ridiculous ethical thing that they've done. They've had some shady internal behavior. The operations are a mess.
00:55:37.580 - 00:56:10.750, Speaker B: They botched the airdrop Eigen layer. Wow. Really blowing it on the other side. I've seen people say, I'd go so far as to go a step further and say, AV's builders should actually 100% give people who spend all day thinking about Eigen layer financial stake in the protocol to get their attention, brain power. It's not so they shill your project or corrupted. It's so they have an incentive to meaningfully contribute, even if that contribution is shitting on a design decision you made, which makes you rethink how you're going about it. So that's the other side.
00:56:10.750 - 00:56:26.370, Speaker B: No, I'm not going to call out who said this on. It was someone on Twitter. No, Mike is. I would say Mike is. As far to the former as you can. Mike is extreme. And I'm on Mike's side.
00:56:26.370 - 00:56:32.142, Speaker B: Without ruining the conversation. Mike is extremely disgusted by. This is how I would describe it.
00:56:32.206 - 00:56:32.902, Speaker A: Amen.
00:56:33.046 - 00:56:35.850, Speaker B: Yeah. What do you think about this?
00:56:36.390 - 00:56:37.530, Speaker A: It's disgusting.
00:56:38.400 - 00:56:46.980, Speaker B: Why? So can you explain this as you see it? Yeah, just give me. Give me your overview.
00:56:50.520 - 00:57:23.560, Speaker A: There's a couple of issues that I have with it. It presents a clear conflict of interest. When we had. I want to go back to that interview we had with Sriram and Calvin in January of 2022, I believe. And one of the things that I press them the most on is how they would preserve security and make decisions when you have all these abs's. Because naturally people chase yield and they don't look at that, and they could create some issues. That was kind of the gist of the question.
00:57:23.560 - 00:57:53.700, Speaker A: And they said, well, we're going to have some sort of security council. And most of it, you know, people with an eigen and then potentially other people outside the organization, presumably. Hopefully. And that was the first thing that I thought when I saw this, Mike. Okay, well, that's an issue more so for Eigen than perhaps any other. Other protocols. An example would be, imagine.
00:57:53.700 - 00:58:22.200, Speaker A: Imagine an investment bank. They're gonna take Facebook public like JP Morgan, whatever. And you now, all of a sudden, Facebook grants all these options. Not to the investment bankers that are running the deal. They clearly want this to be a huge success because their bonus depends on it. But to the equity research analysts that are going to publish their price targets on the stock, you think that's allowed?
00:58:23.860 - 00:58:26.040, Speaker B: I mean, no, exactly.
00:58:26.630 - 00:58:59.530, Speaker A: I think it's class sequel or something. So it's not. Why? Because otherwise the analysts would say, oh, you know, they would be heavily influenced to be biased. Aave Imagine has a risk team internally that determines what collateral gets onboarded and what are the parameters and maybe some of the incentives to get allocated to that. Do you think it would be fair to have these particular team members get a huge airdrop of emerging protocols that carry way more risk? Do you think that's not going to influence your decision?
00:59:02.950 - 00:59:06.758, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it will if you're an individual, like employee. Yeah.
00:59:06.894 - 00:59:27.620, Speaker A: Okay. Two examples. And this is the exact same thing for this security Council thing. That's the thing I care most about. These decisions around how you treat an AV's is problematic, to say the least of, and particularly because Eigen, I think, carries a lot of some more systemic. It's a. It's a protocol that can.
00:59:27.620 - 00:59:45.916, Speaker A: The carrier carries more systemic risk than others. I'm not saying that it would be nice. It would be equally or less sorry. I'm not saying that if other protocols did it, it would be less wrong to do so. I just. I just find it. Yeah, I just think it's.
00:59:45.948 - 00:59:46.434, Speaker B: It.
00:59:46.572 - 00:59:51.134, Speaker A: Anyways, that was my biggest concern when I first saw this, if that makes sense.
00:59:51.222 - 00:59:56.530, Speaker B: Yeah, it does. Should any, like, action be taken? Should any like. What's the. What happens next in your mind?
00:59:57.790 - 01:00:29.056, Speaker A: Well, any individual that receives an airdrop should probably return it. They don't want to return it. Then they should make it very clear and disclose it. And they should not be. They should excuse themselves from any type of decision making that involves a particular treatment or of that particular abs or just abs in general or whoever. Right. There's going to be a decision around a particular proposal program or whatever.
01:00:29.056 - 01:01:26.510, Speaker A: You should excuse yourself from that, I think, personally. Yeah, I don't know if I'm. Yeah, it doesn't sit well. I could see a lot of counterarguments, and I'm trying to play those out of what people might say. It's like, oh, you know, like investors that might have an investor in Eigen, and then this other company that did the airdrop, well, they're going to vote on chain, and they have a clear interest in these two protocols, and they can drive some of that decision. And it's a fair point. Like, I don't think we figured out governance all that well, but when you have these incentives, I think it starts getting complicated, especially when it's not properly disclosed.
01:01:26.890 - 01:01:27.554, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:01:27.682 - 01:01:34.820, Speaker A: And I think that's probably the solution. And the answer to all of this is just, just a disclosure around it.
01:01:35.840 - 01:02:28.200, Speaker B: Yeah, that's my recommendation, I think more so, like, blockworks has a, you can, like, you can Google Blockworks financial disclosures and anyone who writes content or creates content, like our entire research team, me, Mike, any podcast host, any of our writers, there's financial disclosures. So anything that we own that's over $5,000 is on that sheet. Nfts that we own, liquid assets, public equities related to crypto, bitcoin, eth, et cetera. It's actually all on that. And that's historically always been a media company thing, but just because there's so much angel investing and cross things and there's tokens, I don't know. I really actually do think that it doesn't need to be mandatory, but it wouldn't be the worst idea to have more, more disclosures than other industries, is what I'd say.
01:02:28.860 - 01:03:21.460, Speaker A: Here's what's going to be the sign for all this. The response and how they respond, I think, is going to tell you. You know, sometimes when you do things, the operating assumption should be, if this were to surface and everyone would know about this particular deal, would I feel comfortable? And I think that has always served as a moral compass to any decision that you make. And I think you might be wondering what a particular employee that was on that list and how they're feeling right now in the wake of this surfacing to light. And maybe they don't have any problem with that. Maybe they can come up with a very rational solution that we're doing a lot of work and, you know, maybe that is the answer and that's fine for them. But I, I think that is, that is the question that I think you should be.
01:03:21.460 - 01:03:46.690, Speaker A: You should ask yourself, right. If you're in that position, how would you feel if it came public, of a particular offer that you get, and it goes back to, I think, in crypto oftentimes. I mean, why, I guess the counter would be, why does it matter that it was to particular individuals? What if the company got it? Maybe we arguably wouldn't have gotten as much of blowback.
01:03:46.730 - 01:03:46.906, Speaker B: Right.
01:03:46.938 - 01:03:56.914, Speaker A: Or outcry. I mean, there are countless of examples of protocols being incentivized to deploy in a different chain. Right.
01:03:57.002 - 01:03:57.630, Speaker B: Right.
01:03:57.930 - 01:04:02.310, Speaker A: Do we have a problem with that? Well, you know, it's an incentive. Right. It's.
01:04:02.930 - 01:04:19.404, Speaker B: But it seems more clear, I think the issue is that it's more clear. It's very out in the open. It's like, hey, CRV, is bribing with this? Oh, let's see what happens. Um, yes, it's very open that. I think that's the issue. Okay. So I thought about this so much because SPF, the SPF.
01:04:19.404 - 01:04:25.596, Speaker B: And so SPF funded the block with $40 million. You remember that he had given loan.
01:04:25.628 - 01:04:27.524, Speaker A: To one of the acting CEO, to.
01:04:27.532 - 01:04:48.406, Speaker B: The CEO, Mike McCaffrey. And actually. And people might give me shit for this. That in and of itself is nothing like illegal or raw. Like, I mean, it's wrong, but it's not the worst thing in the world. There's a lot of media companies that are kind of funded by billionaires. Mark Benioff in time.
01:04:48.406 - 01:05:02.794, Speaker B: Bezos and Washington Post, that Henry and Boston Globe. It's that you didn't share it publicly. That's the problem. I mean, and SPF was a scammer and all that kind of stuff. And they got. No, no. Just disclosure.
01:05:02.794 - 01:05:10.138, Speaker B: Just say it. And if you're. And, like, this is what Mike and I always talk about, if you're worried about disclosing it, it probably means you're doing something wrong.
01:05:10.314 - 01:05:20.010, Speaker A: It's just what I said. But a better way, a clear way to say it. Just. Yeah, I think in the abundance of caution, it's. You just disclose it.
01:05:20.130 - 01:05:20.830, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:05:21.130 - 01:05:27.026, Speaker A: Okay. There's all these projects that are building an eigen. We, by the way, received some air drops.
01:05:27.098 - 01:05:44.836, Speaker B: You know, actually thinking about this, I think we're gonna add. We should add, not, not we in the. You and me, we, as in block work, should add people's private angel investments to this disclosures, doc. Because that's not on there, too. I don't know. I think I'd like to, for sure.
01:05:44.868 - 01:05:47.356, Speaker A: I mean, you have research components, so. Absolutely. Yeah.
01:05:47.428 - 01:05:48.080, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:05:48.940 - 01:06:16.926, Speaker A: Look, every time this has been, and I hope we do this right way here, like, you know, when we have teams on, when we talk about a particular project, you know, first of all, nothing is financial advice. Second of all, there is clear bias. So you disclose it. Right? I'm like, I'm an investor, and we just had mega east. I'm an investor in mega east. It's one of the first things you say, right? I'm an investor in sky trade. I'm an investor in so many different now you could look at that and say, I don't want to listen to this guy because he's clearly biased.
01:06:16.926 - 01:06:46.284, Speaker A: He's shelling his back. I'm like, I mean, then what's the argument? You can't have him on the pot. Well, I want to share because I think they're building interesting things, real use cases and whatever. If you want to, if you, I think there's, you're never going to convince that those people, but that's not going to stop me from bringing really good founders that I've had the, you know, that you and I or whoever have invested in, because they're going to come on and I think it's worthwhile for them to share their story, whatever. So. But I think you, you always disclose it, I think.
01:06:46.332 - 01:06:46.960, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:06:49.020 - 01:06:53.130, Speaker A: So, yeah, it will be interesting.
01:06:54.190 - 01:06:57.410, Speaker B: If you're an investor in Eigen, how do you handle something like this?
01:07:00.030 - 01:07:50.412, Speaker A: I'd like to really understand the decision making process of who signed off and what was the reason not to disclose it. Because you have to pass from checkpoints. Right. If you're going to get an airdrop in particular, like, if you're going to get some sort of compensation outside of your work compensation, you have to disclose it in most contractual employment agreements. And so someone up the chain should have knew about it. And I think if you come from a traditional background of, like, you know, HR, illegal like this would have had to be disclosed. So they probably knew about it.
01:07:50.412 - 01:08:24.422, Speaker A: And then I think it would have been probably wise, whoever that person was, to maybe think about publicly, you know, making certain disclosures that. Yeah, and if whoever, that person that probably has some gray hair on them, I think it's on them and they're on the chopping block. If I'm an investor, if I'm on the board, I'd be like, that person needs to probably go, I don't know. Maybe I'm being too harsh, but I don't, I don't think so.
01:08:24.446 - 01:08:34.490, Speaker B: No, no. I think this is a very serious situation. I don't think, and I think there's more teams who have done this who are now really getting things under wraps probably right now.
01:08:35.630 - 01:09:11.040, Speaker A: Again, these are some things that we need to bring more transparency. And just, there are certain rules in the traditional world that are really good, and they're there for a reason, and they apply here, too. And there's no reason why you think they shouldn't, because you're creating some novel piece of technology. Like that has nothing to do with that. So it's always worth to hire good counsel. I know sometimes it's expensive and whatnot, but, you know, it's really important. Cool.
01:09:11.120 - 01:09:11.688, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:09:11.824 - 01:09:44.321, Speaker A: And, like, transparency. And I think, like, sometimes these, the problem at times is like, you go back to FTX like, it was a club deal, there's no lead. And so no one's really negotiating terms, and information disclosures are really important. Someone. Board composition is very important, and not for the reason you want to be nagging the founder, but for the reason that you want to be there to support him. Because sometimes, like, investors act as a sounding board. So who's on the board of Eigen? You know, like, I think that is something that should be like that.
01:09:44.321 - 01:09:52.185, Speaker A: These are some of the things that, like, investors can really help you in that. As a sounding board for some of these things.
01:09:52.297 - 01:09:57.549, Speaker B: Yeah. You want to discuss shared sequencers, or do we call it.
01:09:58.300 - 01:10:08.680, Speaker A: Oh, man, what about him? I saw your tweet. That was pretty savage, man. I was. I was proud. That's my boy. I was like, fish, fish pumping.
01:10:09.100 - 01:10:18.280, Speaker B: I didn't even think I was roasting. I got some messages being like, what the fuck, man? Like, why you gotta. Why you gotta come at us with that? I was like, I was promising. I was not thinking of you.
01:10:18.900 - 01:10:23.172, Speaker A: Yeah. As the saying goes, Yanna woke up that day and he chose violence.
01:10:23.236 - 01:10:46.380, Speaker B: Islands chose islands. So I'll give people the TLDR. The TLDR is that Rushi, who's the founder of movement Labs, tweeted, all sequencer companies are going to zero. TLDR is that shared sequencing base sequencing, et cetera, are all going to zero. As focused value props as a b two B model. These ideas make no sense. One, there are only five to six rollups worth attracting.
01:10:46.380 - 01:11:19.658, Speaker B: And if there are five to six shared sequencing groups, again, this is all ruches. Know what I'm saying? If there are only five to six shared sequencing groups, there's simply no market to justify venture scalable companies. Two, those five to six roll ups are all working on their own sequencing implementation for their respective networks. Orbit, super chain move collective, etcetera. And 399.99% of the population does not understand, nor does not care, nor care. So then he said, the sequencing debacle boils down to this.
01:11:19.658 - 01:11:41.182, Speaker B: Everyone wants their own chain. Everyone believes there will be the l one l two, l three, l four, l five to roll them all. It makes no sense to design architecture around a singular chain because the end game is just multi chain. Not in a corny way, but it is. Base will coexist with Solana, which will coexist with arbitrum, whether you like it or not. Teams are incentivized to launch their own chains to build their own ecosystems for better financial outcomes. Deal with it.
01:11:41.182 - 01:11:53.902, Speaker B: That's just the truth. I think this is net healthy. As competition over time will weed out the top four to five chains, just like in web, two for websites during.com bubble. Now that we. Okay, I mean, this is a very long post. I'm not going to read it all.
01:11:53.902 - 01:11:58.820, Speaker B: We can link it, but that's the gist. What do you think?
01:11:59.320 - 01:12:03.224, Speaker A: Well, first of all, we had Rishi, and I'm an investor in movement labs, so.
01:12:03.352 - 01:12:05.768, Speaker B: Did you not disclose that at the beginning of the episode?
01:12:05.824 - 01:12:17.576, Speaker A: Slumpty closing it now. I'll disclose it in that episode, by the way. But I agree with that. I think people should go and listen to the pod with Anil from Rome.
01:12:17.608 - 01:12:22.048, Speaker B: Protocol and with astria and espresso.
01:12:22.104 - 01:12:22.344, Speaker A: Astria.
01:12:22.352 - 01:12:24.120, Speaker B: Nespresso from like a year ago, actually with.
01:12:24.160 - 01:13:01.040, Speaker A: Right. Yeah. So I think the vision for something like Rome, which I'm also an investor, is great in that he actually says, and I talked to him when I saw that post, he said, this is exactly why we've gone. And our vision is just more than shared sequencing. And I think what he's getting at there is the point that rush is making, which is the size of the market. It's not like venture scale. And, for instance, Rome is using Solana and leveraging that network and security for the sequencing, whereas the other implementations are creating their own network from scratch and bootstrapping that.
01:13:01.040 - 01:13:31.682, Speaker A: And that's more complex. And, yeah, I think the biggest point that I think Ruchi made in there was it might work. It's just the. Is it a venture scale type of outcome? And you might say, hey, listen, for context, the sequencing is incredibly valuable. They capture Mev. And so, you know, as these things continue to grow, then that could be pretty lucrative. But it depends, right? If you're sharing that and who.
01:13:31.682 - 01:13:36.242, Speaker A: What's the network look like? And it depends.
01:13:36.346 - 01:14:00.772, Speaker B: Yeah. So I would take. That has nothing to do with sequencers, which is that if you meet the founders of a lot of these shared sequencer companies and the teams, they're actually some of the best teams in all of crypto. So whether that's Anil at Rome or Josh at Astria or Jill at Espresso and Ben Fish from Espresso, like, I know all three of those teams very well.
01:14:00.796 - 01:14:10.848, Speaker A: Ben was like a gigabrain from Stanford jail, was at a venture fund before that. What's the other guy's name from Josh from Australia?
01:14:10.944 - 01:14:12.900, Speaker B: Josh was like Josh Bowen.
01:14:13.720 - 01:14:14.144, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:14:14.192 - 01:14:34.900, Speaker B: Josh was at Celestia before that. And I just think, like, shared sequencer or not, like, I think people are. I think all, first off, all of them understand what rushi is saying like, I don't think any of them read rushes. Post was like, oh my God. Like, that's the truth of shared sequencers. Like, oh crap, we don't have a business model. Like, they understood this a year and a half ago.
01:14:34.900 - 01:14:54.890, Speaker B: And I just think a lot of their thesis is like, there's a lot, shared sequencing is about coordinating block production. Block coordinate, excuse me, block coordinate. Block. Yeah. Block construction across chains. There's like the role of coordinating block construction. There's a lot more that you can do with it that's not being done right now.
01:14:54.890 - 01:15:06.830, Speaker B: And I think a lot of them will end up doing things around it, whether that's building a marketplace around it or selling temporary sequencer rights, whatever it is. Like, there's some of the best founders out there.
01:15:06.990 - 01:15:08.366, Speaker A: If you sit at the heart of.
01:15:08.398 - 01:15:10.862, Speaker B: That, you will figure out a good business model.
01:15:10.926 - 01:15:49.706, Speaker A: Well, it's a big mode and you can capture a lot of value in the same way that if you're running a shared, a single sequencer, like we're going to publish the episode with the mega eth team. We talk about this too. Like it's, we've go listen to the episodes with Steven from Arbitrum as well, the single sequencer. Like there's a lot of value there. That's like what captures the MeV. And so, yeah, I would agree with that last statement you just said, which is if you can create that network, you can build other stuff on top of it. And I would actually argue if we had Rishi and Ben and Jill and Anil, they would probably kind of all agree on that.
01:15:49.706 - 01:15:50.778, Speaker A: Maybe, maybe not.
01:15:50.834 - 01:15:53.590, Speaker B: Yeah, I think they would end up agreeing more than people think.
01:15:53.890 - 01:15:57.654, Speaker A: Exactly that. That's the point. And I think that's a good way to end it.
01:15:57.742 - 01:16:31.888, Speaker B: Yeah, I started watching industry and it is not the right show to watch before bed. It's like, so actually, so this guy I know who worked, who was a trader at Goldman for a while said it's the most reflect, it's the show that most reflects what it was actually like to be a trader at Goldman. 15 2025 even. Yeah. Like 1520 years ago. It's I think set in like 2007 or 2008. So what was that 15 years ago? So it's not like a Wall street in the eighties show.
01:16:31.888 - 01:17:01.882, Speaker B: It's like, it's like a Goldman whatever in 20 07 20 08 20 00 920 ten. And so I started watching it. I watched episode one. It's too stressful to watch before bed. I was like, I was like, I was very much worked up kind of remembering my trying to get this internship at Goldman and yeah, I know one of the guys in the first episode, I'm just going to ruin it for people. He dies from taking too much Adderall and drinking too much Red Bull because he's trying to turn a deck for a client who doesn't even show up for the meeting.
01:17:01.946 - 01:17:03.450, Speaker A: That's based on a true story, right?
01:17:03.490 - 01:17:05.442, Speaker B: Yeah. Bank of America analyst, unfortunately.
01:17:05.506 - 01:17:24.130, Speaker A: And that was, I was, I was a first year analyst at the time and then that's why they created this protected policy where. Protected weekend policy. I think once a month you had a weekend protected. You couldn't be emailed from the time you left the office Friday, I think you had to leave at seven or 08:00 p.m. and you couldn't be email until it's like Sunday at like, like noon.
01:17:24.590 - 01:17:27.710, Speaker B: Oh, that is not, that does not exist at most places.
01:17:27.830 - 01:17:52.138, Speaker A: No, no, it does protect weekend. Yeah, it was a thing because of this problem was. So I tried it, like, of course, like, I'm like, well, fuck. See, I've had like the, we were working out 100 hours, weeks plus, like, but it was good. Like, you know, it was just whatever. I think it was like the last class of like, true investment banking, I guess. So towards the end of it, we had like, this protected week and we're like, oh, this new class is going to get so much better.
01:17:52.138 - 01:18:03.450, Speaker A: The problem with this policy is, fine, you leave Friday, you're like, am I getting an email? You enjoy Saturday, but you just know when that Sunday news comes raw.
01:18:03.610 - 01:18:04.550, Speaker B: Oh, yeah.
01:18:04.930 - 01:18:08.426, Speaker A: You just can't blueberry that BlackBerry, you know BlackBerry?
01:18:08.498 - 01:18:09.150, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:18:09.570 - 01:18:14.090, Speaker A: That's just gonna go off like a Christmas tree.
01:18:14.210 - 01:18:24.258, Speaker B: Yeah. When I lived in, when we moved to New York, how many guys we put. So Mike and I both went to Emory together and we put five people.
01:18:24.314 - 01:18:26.950, Speaker A: You know, the, the ivy of the south. Am I mistaken?
01:18:27.250 - 01:18:28.298, Speaker B: What is this?
01:18:28.474 - 01:18:29.834, Speaker A: The ivy of the south.
01:18:30.002 - 01:18:36.218, Speaker B: Oh, the ivy of the south. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah, that's Emery, baby. That's Emery football team that's never been.
01:18:36.234 - 01:18:38.386, Speaker A: Defeated because it never played.
01:18:38.458 - 01:18:39.590, Speaker B: Because it never played.
01:18:41.010 - 01:18:42.910, Speaker A: EU doesn't have a football team either.
01:18:43.730 - 01:18:57.050, Speaker B: So I grew up in, outside of San Francisco and I was like, yeah, I'm going to Emory. Nobody had heard of it. Nobody. So I like being on the east coast where people actually know what Emory is. So we lit. Yeah. Mike and I were the only two of our friends who didn't go into IB.
01:18:57.050 - 01:19:14.264, Speaker B: And just because that was like, what you did, it coming out of Emory. So we lived with one guy at Evercore, one guy Guggenheim and one guy at JP Morgan. And they were just never home. It was amazing. Mike and I just had the place to ourselves. It was great.
01:19:14.432 - 01:19:19.380, Speaker A: So industry. No, kid, I watched. I started watching house. Re watching house of cards.
01:19:19.840 - 01:19:20.976, Speaker B: Great show.
01:19:21.088 - 01:19:23.096, Speaker A: Great show. Just this feels right.
01:19:23.208 - 01:19:28.528, Speaker B: It's. I mean, you remember it was the first show ever to drop it all at once.
01:19:28.664 - 01:19:37.984, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, it was so good. And they looked straight in the camera created just as new genre. You're like, whoa. Then it was amazing.
01:19:38.032 - 01:19:40.230, Speaker B: I don't want Kevin Spacey to talk to me.
01:19:40.400 - 01:19:43.670, Speaker A: Yeah, no, certainly not now.
01:19:44.850 - 01:19:47.106, Speaker B: I did watch the Kevin Spacey documentary.
01:19:47.218 - 01:19:50.842, Speaker A: Oh, really? Putting that aside, great show. Come at me.
01:19:50.866 - 01:19:51.274, Speaker B: Great show.
01:19:51.322 - 01:19:51.970, Speaker A: Cancel me all.
01:19:52.010 - 01:19:54.858, Speaker B: It's like listening to my, like I still listen to my.
01:19:54.954 - 01:20:10.476, Speaker A: It's still a great show. And so, you know, I'm watching. I watched that, I watched the. What was another one? Oh, it was a cartel. Cowboys on Netflix. It's. Let me see.
01:20:10.476 - 01:20:14.772, Speaker A: I think cowboy cartels are. Cowboy cartels. That's really good.
01:20:14.836 - 01:20:16.700, Speaker B: You ever watch about like narcos?
01:20:16.740 - 01:20:36.544, Speaker A: Well, I think it's by the same producer, narcos. And it's basically like how they dismantled this one of the deadliest drug organizations, which actually was very prominent my. Where I grew up, which was actually really bad. And because they were buying all these horses in the US and like the. One of the brothers of the cartel guys was living in Texas.
01:20:36.612 - 01:20:38.700, Speaker B: And like, where did you grow up?
01:20:39.200 - 01:20:50.632, Speaker A: Uh, Monterey, Mexico, and Mexico City, but most of it this north northeast city in Mexico. Like I spend a large part of my childhood there.
01:20:50.696 - 01:20:53.104, Speaker B: Did you go to school in, in Mexico?
01:20:53.232 - 01:21:00.304, Speaker A: Yeah, american school, but it was, um. At this point, I've lived most of my life in the US, actually.
01:21:00.392 - 01:21:02.800, Speaker B: Why is your english so good if you grew up in Mexico?
01:21:02.920 - 01:21:15.820, Speaker A: Because I'm a fucking savant. No, not really. I'm gonna lose her brain. No, no, no. Funny. Funny enough.
01:21:16.120 - 01:21:20.820, Speaker B: We gotta make the intro like just on Sabbat.
01:21:21.480 - 01:21:28.724, Speaker A: Oh God, that's gonna come bite me in the ass so hard. I made it a point to not have an accent, actually, consciously.
01:21:28.912 - 01:21:29.572, Speaker B: Really?
01:21:29.716 - 01:21:55.150, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, of course. I mean, I spent so much time in the US, but like when I went to college, I probably still have marginal accent. I mean, I went to an american school and high school. Like middle school and high school. Most of the classes, nine out of ten are English, and then you have 1 hour of Spanish. But most of my friends, they went to school like, you know, Harvard MBA, Stanford they still have an accent. I'm like, guys, why do you have an accent? I'm like, you've been living here? Like, they're like, what do you mean? I'm like, you know, you have an accent.
01:21:55.150 - 01:22:08.510, Speaker A: Like, fucking use your iPhone. Like, listen. And for me, it was just really important to perfect language, you know? Like, you can. You can perfect something. Like, get rid of the accent, you know?
01:22:08.590 - 01:22:09.318, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:22:09.494 - 01:22:16.982, Speaker A: Not neutralize it. Like, you know, I still have an accent. Maybe it's northeastern. Maybe it's, I don't know, some hodgepodge or whatever, but.
01:22:17.086 - 01:22:24.340, Speaker B: So it's a leap. It's elite, nouveau rich elite.
01:22:25.880 - 01:22:31.200, Speaker A: Yeah. Come at me. Come at. This is how I'm gonna be reading.
01:22:31.240 - 01:22:35.400, Speaker B: These about to get shredded this week.
01:22:35.440 - 01:22:48.230, Speaker A: You'll see me Sunday night, crawled up in my bed reading the comments. I haven't tried learning a new language. I think it might be too late in life. But I don't see the incentive now that I moved to, like, I don't want to learn French.
01:22:48.350 - 01:22:51.926, Speaker B: But I just think with AI is going to get so freaking good that, like, you're.
01:22:51.958 - 01:22:52.454, Speaker A: It's.
01:22:52.582 - 01:22:53.270, Speaker B: No, no need.
01:22:53.310 - 01:23:03.702, Speaker A: I just don't see the point. Plus, like, there are languages that you can learn. I think if you date, if you're significant other speaks another language, I think that's the strongest incentive to learn it.
01:23:03.806 - 01:23:04.182, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:23:04.246 - 01:23:06.810, Speaker A: But, uh. And been the case yet.
01:23:07.910 - 01:23:09.206, Speaker B: All right. Good pod.
01:23:09.318 - 01:23:16.740, Speaker A: Good pod, sir. Good pod. Well, uh. Is that it for the week? No, you have tomorrow. We're recording another.
01:23:17.200 - 01:23:34.224, Speaker B: Yeah, we're doing dawn, guys, we have some good apps coming out. Mega eth. We've got Keoni and Smokey come out this Tuesday. Keoni, founder of Monad, Smokey founder, Bear chain, come out on Tuesday. We had a really good episode with Jeremy Allaire, one of my favorites. Favorites we've recorded in months. Great episode with Jeremy Allaire.
01:23:34.224 - 01:23:35.688, Speaker B: So stay tuned.
01:23:35.744 - 01:23:39.260, Speaker A: We're gonna have Brian Armstrong from Coinbase. Is that happening next week?
01:23:40.680 - 01:23:46.768, Speaker B: I think the condition that he put to us is once one of us goes bald, and I'm not doing it.
01:23:46.864 - 01:23:47.888, Speaker A: So next week, right?
01:23:47.984 - 01:23:51.752, Speaker B: Yeah, next week. Awesome. All right, folks, thanks for listening.
01:23:51.936 - 01:23:54.700, Speaker A: Thanks, everyone, for listening. Enjoy the rest of the summer, I guess.
01:23:56.480 - 01:24:17.750, Speaker C: Thanks for watching today's episode. Just wanted to quickly mention that the wait for Crypto's killer app wave is nearly over.
