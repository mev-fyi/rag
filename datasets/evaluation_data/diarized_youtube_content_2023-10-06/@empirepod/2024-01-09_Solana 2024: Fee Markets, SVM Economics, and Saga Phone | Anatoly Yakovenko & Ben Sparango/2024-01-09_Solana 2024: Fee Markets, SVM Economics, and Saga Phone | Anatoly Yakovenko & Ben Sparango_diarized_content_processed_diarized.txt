00:00:00.200 - 00:00:37.354, Speaker A: And you can try to meme it into ultrasound money. But what I would rather see is real world stuff that has value to humans, like a wireless cell plan, like something that is external to crypto, that is forcing somebody that's, like, did their job and grew some food and got money to pay a validator to go include transactions that kind of, like, real world tie into the economy, I think is really, really important. And we need more of that and stuff that's not reflexive. I'd rather see things priced in real world assets instead of sold, and those generate enough fees for validators to pay themselves.
00:00:37.734 - 00:01:00.638, Speaker B: All right, everyone, so on empire, you obviously know that we talk a lot about the institutions coming into crypto, and that is why we are super excited to share that we are hosting the digital asset summit. We've hosted this since 2019. It's coming up in London, March 18 to 20th. Don't miss your chance to get ahead of the curve. You can get 20% off with code Empire 20. We'll see you in London. Hey, everyone.
00:01:00.638 - 00:01:36.546, Speaker B: If you have been listening to Empire, you know that Santi and I are fed up with unaffordable fees and frustrating transaction speeds that make the on chain experience basically unusable. So the arbitrum team reached out, and they showed us the platform. They showed us what you can do on arbitrum. Whatever you're doing, you can experience frictionless transactions at lightning speed on arbitrum. So head over to portal dot Arbitrum IO and check it out. What's up, everyone? Before we jump into today's episode, I'm excited to share Empire's first ever security partner. Harpy is the best tool to prevent your wallet from theft in real time.
00:01:36.546 - 00:02:12.794, Speaker B: Harpy is not just a security solution. They are a peace of mind solution. But don't just take our word for it. Harpy is the only wallet security solution that protected 100% of its users from attacks like the ledger one in Q four, which was an off chain signature attack. To learn more about Harpy, click the link in the show notes or visit Harpy IO Empire. All right, everyone, special lab. 13 months ago, we recorded an episode with Anatolian Ben Ben Sprango, head of BD over Solana Foundation Tolle, founder at Solana Labs.
00:02:12.794 - 00:02:46.284, Speaker B: I think I got that right. And the episode was basically around the premise of can Solana move past SPF? And that was, I think, 13 months ago to the date. And since then, Solana has, in fact, moved past SPF, and a lot has happened. So I think, like, totally. I mean, we want to make this episode more about 2024, but totally, I think I'd throw this first question to you of just like, did it, was it always obvious to you that we would move past the FTX and SPF debacle or were there some, like, late nights there sitting in bed thinking this might be the end here?
00:02:48.464 - 00:03:11.742, Speaker A: My stomach was definitely churning. Raj is much better at this is nothing. All the ecosystem teams are building it. I don't know. It definitely felt like a moment where I was terrified. Oh, man. The first thing that I thought was all the ecosystem teams had their funds on FTX and all their runways.
00:03:11.742 - 00:03:57.734, Speaker A: Now zero, and we're dead. Luckily, that was not the case. Most team, very few teams actually had any cash on there. And the second one was that, like, I didn't think there was going to be an exodus. I just thought that the really long, prolonged bear market is just like, kills funding, and the new batch of new startups that come in and build stuff is really, really important just to keep momentum going. And that was like, kind of, I thought, oh, man. Like, a really long bear market and FTX, because of the size of the implosion, is going to prolong it, and within 18 to 24 months, it's just going to be worse than the bottom of the last bear, which was bad when ETH was at 80.
00:03:57.734 - 00:04:25.354, Speaker A: Amir from Xerox, I don't know if he remembers it. I was getting coffee with him. He was like, dexs are dead. Literally. He told me that there's no point, so I thought it was going to get there. And that's for a smaller ecosystem that's much harder to survive that. But, like, yeah, I'm very surprised by how fast things rebounded, to be honest.
00:04:25.474 - 00:04:58.062, Speaker C: Maybe Vander. Totally. From your standpoint, what would you attribute the market waking up to? Solana, over the course of the last 13 months? Bonk. Just. I've been hearing you totally being very vocal about why you're building Solana. I think you have a very good understanding of the type of user that is going to use this, whereas I think in crypto, historically, it's been, let's just build this cool, decentralized systems. But I think you do have a very unique appreciation of why you're building it.
00:04:58.078 - 00:04:58.634, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:05:01.854 - 00:06:06.686, Speaker A: My view is that it's the builders that are building on top that ship products that go get users. So the infrastructure layer is middleware. Like, we don't actually make anything happen. Right? We just unblock devs, and then somebody like Armani builds mad lads and attracts a bunch of users and then builds backpack and builds an exchange now, right? Like, that person is doing all the kind of, like, value creation, all the drive and everything else. And because of somebody like Armani and, like, a whole bunch of other devs, opportunity for, like, nom to build bonk and capture, like, the imagination of a bunch of people arise because bonk is able to integrate across, like, 50 projects, right? And, like, people start messing around with it and then, like, that catches fire. So, like, we just did a pretty good job shipping the system with not too many bugs to where those dabs were not blocked. That's kind of how I look at it.
00:06:06.686 - 00:06:41.962, Speaker A: We didn't screw it up. That that's like the. And that's hard not to do that because these systems are so complex and you're trying to optimize for, like, a bajillion different variables. But I can't imagine we would be here if it wasn't for those developers because, like, what's the point of a fast blockchain if no one's using it, right? And we're not building products for users. We're like the core team that's working on the protocol with fire dancer and Jira and all those guys are working on middleware. They're optimizing latencies and stuff like that. It takes a bunch of devs to go build products that makes stuff happen.
00:06:41.962 - 00:07:14.150, Speaker A: And I think, like, Breakpoint has been, like, a place for a lot of developers to do launches and announce products, and it just kind of happened that way. It's not like no one's coordinating it, but, like, it just started happening simply because it's a good time to do announcements. And, like, this breakpoint, there were like over 30, close to 50 or something like that, just different launches of products and protocols and integrations and all this stuff. And it all finally, I think, got.
00:07:14.182 - 00:08:11.060, Speaker D: Over the hump users excited, all of that for sure. I think that something that I've sensed kind of broadly in the crypto ecosystem right around the time of breakpoint, or maybe right before, is people are frustrated in this bear market with applications that are still hard to use, and they're thinking about their long term thesis around why they're building in this space and where this is going long term. And people were like, look, fees are still high. It's still clunky for the average person to use this stuff. And then there was this point where some people started trying some of the Solana applications and some of the really cool stuff that people are building over here and that led into breakpoint where there were more announcements and more cool stuff. And that started to really feed the fire, which got more people using the chain. Once people use it, they make a swap on Jupyter or they try something, they're like, oh, my God, this is, like, complete.
00:08:11.060 - 00:08:33.704, Speaker D: I don't feel like I'm using a blockchain. And I think that kind of precipitated everything that we saw after that, where they're like, okay, maybe the way that Solana is architected is the way that we get this millions or billions of concurrent blockchain users onto web three or onto crypto long term. And I think that there was a little bit of a mindset shift in that capacity that happened.
00:08:35.784 - 00:08:41.248, Speaker B: Was there a turning point, Ben, that made it really obvious? Was there a point in 2023 where you're like, this is.
00:08:41.416 - 00:09:31.132, Speaker A: This is, for me, the mad lab, mad lads launch, was that turning point because you kind of saw the NFT, because nfts were dying across the entire space, and they were. Because Solana, smaller than Ethereum, they were hurting even more than Ethereum. Like, it was just like, kind of the energy was really being sucked out and just. Tristan and Armani did such a good job creating that community and building excitement around it. So when we saw it launch and it captured volumes and everything else at the top of the charts, I was like, okay, there's really, really good devs still able to capture market share. And that, to me, was the turning point where things, I think, psychologically rebounded for a lot of the developers. Because once you see, like, somebody else do it, you're like, oh, I can do better.
00:09:31.132 - 00:09:45.124, Speaker A: You know, like, like, startup founders are always, like, think that they're the best, right? But they need to see an example of somebody succeed. They see that road, and then they think they can do a better job. And that, that's what keeps driving everything. Mine's a.
00:09:45.164 - 00:10:06.140, Speaker D: Mine's a little bit of an intangible, but I would say that everyone here is familiar with Mert. But when Mert really started to find his voice on Twitter, that felt. That felt like a. That felt like a hardening point where it was like, we're going no lower than where Mert will allow the ecosystem.
00:10:06.172 - 00:10:07.260, Speaker B: You want to hear something funny then?
00:10:07.292 - 00:10:07.484, Speaker A: Is.
00:10:07.524 - 00:10:25.264, Speaker B: So we have called with all these other, like, l one s and l two s and stuff and different ecosystems, and, you know, we're talking to them about, you know, one of the ways blockworks makes money is, like, sponsorships and ads and stuff like that. And, you know, talking to them about their marketing strategies, and everyone's like, just need our merch. We just need a merch. Can you help us get a merch?
00:10:26.374 - 00:10:27.662, Speaker A: He's going to love this.
00:10:27.798 - 00:10:52.634, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess. I want to ask, you know, I think, tully, I've seen you be very. You're probably one of the founders that is most engaging in Twitter and, like, taking criticism. Solana's no, not perfect. I think you're probably the first one to call that out and appreciate that as you think about the current state of Solana. You know, you talk about all these applications and people, like, bridging over to Solana having like, this aha. Moment.
00:10:52.634 - 00:11:03.004, Speaker C: What are some of the things that you guys are focused on? First, let's start. What are things that Solana still needs to figure out as an l one? And then what are the priorities for this year?
00:11:06.304 - 00:11:45.436, Speaker A: I look at this as the Linux kernel or any operating system, because hardware changes. The software is never done. You're always going to have to go like, oh, there's caches are now bigger, or this thing is now slower and there's more cores, and you got to go re trigger stuff. It's always going to be the case unless humanity stops building silicon. And then we should all focus on bunker coins. As long as human progress is moving forward, the software that kind of tries to expose that hardware up and get out of the way, the hardware is going to need some work. Where I feel like Solana's done is when that work is kind of moving downhill.
00:11:45.436 - 00:12:23.476, Speaker A: And I almost feel like we're there, but I feel like we're actually, like, with fire dancer out, I will feel like there's no single point of failure left anymore. Because now you have two different client teams that both understand they have, like, bus factor. You know, there's two bus factor, two people for every component. Like two teams, two different code bases. That, to me, is like a really, really important hump. And once that's there, I feel like it's really, really downhill from there. And there's still going to be changes like that are performance improvements, and it's just a bunch of people looking at Grafana and doing analysis and stuff like that.
00:12:23.476 - 00:13:02.024, Speaker A: I think for the most part, we're almost there. The major changes that I feel like we need to fix that are kind of glaring issues that we have designs for. Just got to coordinate and roll this stuff out are like state fees. How do we deal with evicting old state that's in the chain and charging people for being in the hot state, how do we deal with write lock saturation? The 1559 for Solana, what does that look like? It has to be multidimensional. It can't be global in the block. All those problems we're aware of, and there's designs. It's just a matter of, you know, what you need to do.
00:13:02.024 - 00:13:53.026, Speaker A: You don't know the order. The order is typically, it's almost like fire driven development, as we called it. Is that like, what is the biggest kind of, like, glaring issue right now that's blocking developers. If developers are yelling about, like, fees or, like, transaction inclusion, you actually have to dig into the problem and understand why. Is it actually because we need a 1559 or is it a bug in the scheduler that's slowing things down so things are not getting prioritized? And stuff like this is like part of the general day to day kind of like, okay, there's a, you know, there was, like, inscription event and things slowed down. Why did they slow down? Is it actually, like, saturation and the processing blocks of data and whatever, and it takes, like, a week to figure it out. Okay, okay, this is the bug.
00:13:53.026 - 00:14:17.844, Speaker A: Let's go fix it. I think, like, yeah, my feeling is that, like, the ecosystem devs should focus on getting fire dancer out because that's a very, very huge milestone, even if that means slowing down some of the feature development that we know we need to do. And then after that, crank out all the fee optimizations and stuff like that.
00:14:18.004 - 00:14:18.652, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:14:18.788 - 00:14:34.184, Speaker C: Firedancer was a big and shout out again, Mert. I think this team put out a fantastic blog, really, detailing fire dancer, so we don't have to go into all full detail. I would just encourage people to go and read that. To me. It was very illuminating. Can you just briefly touch on Fire dance or its significance?
00:14:35.284 - 00:15:12.718, Speaker A: So my whole vision for Solana and why I built it was that, like, I didn't care about store value. Bitcoin was already good at that. I didn't care about settlement. Ethereum's already good at that. What I cared about was execution and specifically making sure that information is fairly and quickly decimated across the world. And this is because if I did a bunch of trading as an amateur and every time I had a good trade, it would take a little longer to land and the data would take a little longer to arrive, and somebody would get ahead of me. And what I thought was really cool is that, like, if you can build a global system, that's.
00:15:12.718 - 00:15:47.914, Speaker A: This is kind of the opposite of scaling. I'm like, no, we need a single shard because two shards and information is propagating at different speeds between them. You have arbitrage. So, like, I'm not. I don't care about scaling. What I cared about was solving this one problem for synchronizing global information. And if you do that, you actually end up building something really fast and cheap, because you utilize the hardware to its maximum capacity, and that means that you're aggregating all the pipes that you have available into one gen pipe, and things, and prices get better that way.
00:15:47.914 - 00:16:13.662, Speaker A: Everything works better. Firedancer is a second implementation by a different team coming out of jump trading. That's really, really awesome. High frequency trading. Engineers that have built pipelines to handle, like, terabytes of market data. So they, like, know how to manage how to move bits through silicon, and they're not rewrite. They're not changing the Solana protocol.
00:16:13.662 - 00:16:47.240, Speaker A: There's some stuff that they found, like, that could be better. And they're like, hey, you guys should change how this hash is calculated or whatever. But the fundamental Solana protocol is the same. They're just writing it from the ground up because they see our implementation and where we end it up, and they can actually do the big rewrite. Let's make this architecture as fast as hardware allows. When they do that, they can prove out the system at much, much larger bandwidth. We were able to prove out Solana at about one gigabit in a big box with 200 cores.
00:16:47.240 - 00:17:32.656, Speaker A: We can get it to handle one gigabit worth of data there with, like, four cores to eight cores are able to saturate ten to 20 gigabits, which means. So there's, like, an order improvement in just, like, rewriting the software, knowing exactly what it's supposed to be doing from the ground up. And you can't really do that at the start. Like, sure, if we had ten years, an infinite budget, and we would have done a whole bunch of, like, engineering work and testing and all this other stuff and been like, this is what it looks like. Yeah, we could have done that, but you can't do that as a startup. You have to ship, and you have to get a product out. And we were able to do that while maintaining the vision and getting the big bones of the design out.
00:17:32.656 - 00:17:48.470, Speaker A: And that, to me, has been like, holy shit. We did a really good job on the engineering side because Solana is still, like, no competitors cut up to it, I think, in terms of speed and cost. The fire dancer guys didn't tell us to go rewrite a whole bunch of stuff that was stupid.
00:17:48.622 - 00:17:56.606, Speaker B: What does that do for the user totally, or for the founder? Building on Solana, what does fire dancer actually enable two clients?
00:17:56.670 - 00:18:33.314, Speaker A: Means that the probability of a bug in both clients is pretty low, because two different teams are very unlikely to write the exact same bug. So kind of like stupid bugs that could be very catastrophic to the chain. Not talking about halt, I'm talking about like exploit, which prints soul right or something, or like overwrite state that could be really, really catastrophic. If there's two implementations, it's very unlikely the chain will halt. If there's enough stake, one node will halt, and that's great. We've dealt with those. It's egg in our face, whatever.
00:18:33.314 - 00:19:11.946, Speaker A: Within 24 hours, the chain will be back up. If you're not time sensitive, it doesn't matter, there's no loss of funds. But that's really, really important that catastrophic bugs are caught by two different implementations. So that's one thing. The other thing is that, like, since they figured out all the bottlenecks, it's much, much easier for the labs engineers to know, ok, these are the bottlenecks in these pipelines. Let's go fix those up and get the labs client up to speed to where fire dancers at. And when both clients are equally fast, you can actually increase the capacity of the network.
00:19:11.946 - 00:19:46.386, Speaker A: So we can then start handling more and more transactions. So then we start really leveraging hardware improvements. Like, the number of cores you can buy per dollar goes up. Like a system that you buy at a data center per month is going to cost somewhere between $100 to $400 a month. No matter what you do, you're never going to spend $5 for a high availability system. So there's just a minimum cost to how much high availability hardware costs. And at the bottom cost, the amount of hardware you get per dollar doubles every two years.
00:19:46.386 - 00:20:03.864, Speaker A: And even if Solano is running at that bottom, cost is going to continue improving just from data centers continuously updating their hardware. But I think if there's demand, I don't see a reason why the validators won't run at like $400 a month. Doesn't matter, right? Like, as long as there's demand, the hardware is the cheapest part.
00:20:06.924 - 00:20:11.444, Speaker C: In that case, broadband becomes like the most expensive component over time.
00:20:11.524 - 00:20:19.704, Speaker A: What do you imagine is the cost per terabyte out of a data center of egress? Like, you just take a wild guess.
00:20:21.924 - 00:20:22.824, Speaker B: Good luck.
00:20:24.684 - 00:20:26.504, Speaker A: It's $0.64.
00:20:27.114 - 00:20:28.562, Speaker B: Yeah. For a terabyte.
00:20:28.698 - 00:20:29.458, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:20:29.626 - 00:20:30.374, Speaker B: Wow.
00:20:30.674 - 00:21:11.354, Speaker A: So like a single transaction that you send, like, you would have a node just pay to send it to every other node. So you have the dumbest implementation. I'm going to give this, my block producer a transaction that's 128 bytes, and it's going to send it to 10,000 machines without leveraging any kind of, like, anything else, it costs like a fraction of a penny because it's $0.64 for terabyte, and a single transaction that's 128 bytes, right? So, like, this is what the cost of using a blockchain should be, because the dumbest implementation is literally the block producer sends all the data to every other node.
00:21:12.054 - 00:22:08.544, Speaker D: I think this is what's lost on, like, a lot of crypto Twitter, too. Is that, like, the novelty of the way that this Lana blockchain was architected is that it scales in this capacity where it should scale on the basis of just computing getting better into the future, rather than us having to reach some sort of ceiling on saturated blocks, and then needing to figure out our way out of that until we reach some new ceiling. So this is what I think when going back to your question, you know, is, like, when it comes to, like, people using the blockchain or people building their companies on top of this architecture, they can have assurances well into the future that this architecture is going to support their application, regardless of who else is building on the chain, how many people are transacting on it long term. And I think that gives a lot of solace to people when they think about architectures that they need to be using.
00:22:09.044 - 00:22:40.244, Speaker C: I wanted to ask you that, Ben, because a lot of the teams that are trying to build a DeFi protocol or an NFT, whatever, a game, they're like, hey, we're interested in some of these next gen l one s, whether it's napto sui se, and I've asked them, well, have you thought about just Solana, particularly Solana with fire dancer? Like, why even go through the exercise of. And I'm curious what you would say to that, right. Like, when you compare across, forget about ethereum and sort of the. But some of these other kind of competing l one s, if you will.
00:22:41.984 - 00:22:42.384, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:22:42.424 - 00:23:51.812, Speaker D: So usually by the time that someone comes through my inbox, they've already somewhat made the decision that they are going to deploy on top of Solana. So I haven't had too many scenarios where I've had to make those distinctions. What I would say, theoretically, is that being here since 2020 and going through all the trials and tribulations of what we needed to do as an ecosystem, to harden the ecosystem. And what needed to happen on the technical side, in terms of implementations, in terms of bug fixes, in terms of all of these things that we had to go through, is that when you are using one of these newer high throughput chains, you are in uncharted territory. You are working on an architecture that you have no idea how it's going to perform when users come back in droves to use that stack, whereas you have three plus years of history in the Solana ecosystem of us handling those types of market events. So that is the biggest thing that I don't think a lot of people understand is like, yes, it might be performant today, but what happens when the users 20 x over the span of the next twelve months, what is. You have no idea what that end state is going to be.
00:23:51.812 - 00:24:56.514, Speaker D: The other thing that I would say is that the work that we did in the early days to create relationships with the necessary on ramps, implementation partners, or other things that now encompass the entire Solana ecosystem, that is something that doesn't happen overnight. And each one of these people has their own business and their own balance sheet that they need to think about, and think about driving revenue. So, like, when it comes to custodians, exchanges, just like data, like dune analytics, flipside, those kinds of people, you need to go independently with each of these new architectures and pitch them on why they should integrate your blockchain, where the users are coming from, and what's the business case for them. And that is such a long term task that a lot of these people are not even going to be like, dipping their feet into. So you might launch on another chain now, but then you know you're not going to have all the tools and all of the access that you might have in the Solana ecosystem. So Solana is the complete package today, and it's why I think people shouldn't be going anywhere else, at least at the moment.
00:24:57.574 - 00:25:19.008, Speaker B: Can we start to talk about some of these big maybe issues that you guys are, or maybe not issues, but topics that you guys are thinking about going into the, into 2024, things like fees and the SVM. So maybe. Totally, I could pick on you. How are you thinking about just like execution, basically just the economics of the SVM right now at a very high level?
00:25:19.056 - 00:26:07.420, Speaker A: Yeah, we got lucky with the design. I think the reason why the SVM works the way it does, and kind of the weird nuance about it that's very different from even Aptos and Monad and all these other approaches, is that every developer has to go through this painful process of explicitly declaring all the state that they're going to read and write on the chain. So effectively every transaction is required to have a complete access list. That means that it's very easy for the underlying runtime to go schedule everything and make sure parallelism works. But that was luck. My dumb luck of working on digital signal processors, that was how you had to code on a DSP on mobile, is you have to lay out the memory. So like, I knew exactly that.
00:26:07.420 - 00:26:48.330, Speaker A: If we do it this way, it's going to be fast. What was cool about it is that that information is what you need to then do local fee markets, because then you can find hotspots by state. All of these NFts are minting the same NFt. They're all touching the same auction. There's now contention on the writable part of that auction that's common between all of these transactions, and then you can sort them and pick the top ones for that particular state and then do the same thing for all the other ones. And that only is obvious in retrospect and should have been obvious because it's kind of very common database hotspot problem. But that information that we have allows us to do this isolation at the economic side.
00:26:48.330 - 00:27:41.754, Speaker A: And that means that we can also build like multi dimensional 1559. It's kind of like the big next thing is you have exponentially increasing fees for everyone that's searching the exact same hotspot. And that creates a base fee that goes up and forces spammers to back off. And that means that we can actually run defi and payments and nfts and liquidations all in the same environment without them causing the bottom price of transactions to be the highest price of any use case. This is like the key part that a shared system needs to solve is if you have use case a and use case b. If a can force the price for b to go up, b is going to move to its own chain, its own roll up. If we can't solve it, it means you should have svms on top of Celestia.
00:27:41.754 - 00:28:34.944, Speaker A: If we can solve it, it means it's possible to have a single shared computer that's atomic. And I think that completely changes the economics of how these systems work, because you have hotspots that generate all the value creation, all the fees come from content, not from infra. In my mind, the best economics you can have is when you're charging for user generated content is always new, always hot. It's always being created infrastructure is always getting cheaper. In my mind, the only way that these systems survive over the long term is not by separating the DA layer from execution. It's by combining the two and having hotspot content that's unique to the content of the system. Subsidize the infra to be like as cheap as possible.
00:28:34.944 - 00:28:50.690, Speaker A: And I don't think that's possible to do if those are separate teams. It becomes very, very hard to align incentives, but it becomes very, very easy. A single integrated giant state machine. So that's.
00:28:50.722 - 00:29:07.194, Speaker B: Yeah, you mentioned 1559 a couple times, so I just can tell. It's like maybe top of mind for you. Yeah. What do you think 1559 got right about like, alignment of incentives across different actors? And what do you think 1559 got wrong about alignment between different actors?
00:29:07.314 - 00:29:48.740, Speaker A: Actually, I don't care about the monetary policy of it. What I cared about it and I thought was really cool was that it's exponential backup for spam. So you have some resource on the network that the reason why this is hard is that you have a bunch of machines that you don't control. They're all slightly different all over the world. They're all going to behave a little differently. You can force the network to over provision and have ten times the capacity that you use, just so everything executes perfectly well. Or you could actually provision it to be about like the average or a little bit above the average.
00:29:48.740 - 00:30:59.198, Speaker A: And when things get saturated, you start increasing the cost of that resource because you know that some machine somewhere is going to start to slow down because it's getting hit in that particular chunk of memory and caches are being missed and things are bad. When things are redlining, it's just kind of like when you're running a system at its capacity, like stuff starts happening that's not good. And if you could start increasing the cost to run the system at capacity exponentially, you force the attacker to back off. And this is like, I think the really, really beautiful property of 1559 is it kind of like at a very low level engineering way, it forces resources to be priced correctly and you're actually able to manage the system and provision it better. Instead of trying to provision it for the worst case, you can do it up slightly better than the average case and force this, the attacker to back off. So the system's always running well. So I thought that was like, I think again, I was very critical of the 1559 initially, but seeing it in action and work on Ethereum really switched my mind.
00:30:59.198 - 00:31:58.884, Speaker A: I feel like every resource that we have on Solana needs to have exponential economic back off, that if it gets saturated, you just push back. So the challenge, the reason why I was skeptical of it is because I knew it was going to raise the cost of access to the system for everyone to be basically at the cost of deFi. So if you have defined a system, you have arbitrage, and arbitrage is like, I send a transaction that checks, hey, is this trade profitable? And if it's not, abort. But if it is, take the trade and I just spam the network. And as long as, even if 1% of my transactions succeed, as long as the ROI is above that, I will spam it. So I'm sending transactions that effectively fail because 1% of them will succeed, and that will pay for all the fees. So that will naturally increase the cost of using the chain up to the cost of defi.
00:31:58.884 - 00:32:47.474, Speaker A: Just no matter what you do, you're, if you have defi, you have monetary, like, incentives to access the state. I have monetary incentives to spam, and I will spam as long as it's like, I can make money off of it. So I knew that 15 was going to cause it, and that was my initial gut reaction to not support it. But now that I've seen it work, I believe that multidimensional, like, 1559, we can force that specific Sol, USDC market, and orca, that's the one that all the arbitrage bots are hitting to start going up in price in terms of access. That will force the defi to pay more, but payments to continue to go through. And this is kind of like the really, really. It's just, you only see the stuff.
00:32:47.474 - 00:32:57.294, Speaker A: It's obvious in retrospect, but you have to actually go build something, deploy it, see it not work as expected, and try to really wrap your head around it.
00:32:57.654 - 00:33:17.154, Speaker B: When you're on a walk thinking about this problem, like, who is in your mind? Like, are you trying to, are you optimizing the economics of Solana to incentivize for validators? Um, or for it to be, like, cheaper for founders and builders to build things? Like, who, who's in your mind there?
00:33:17.494 - 00:33:54.924, Speaker A: I actually think of it as like, a shared system, like isolation. Like, I have user a and user b. How do I protect user a from b? Like, how do I make sure? Like, I think of it as, like, almost like security. Like, I don't want a single attacker to increase the cost for everyone else. Just like in consensus, you don't want a single attacker to, like, cause the performance drop for everyone else. Right? Like, so it's almost like a, like if you're building like working in the Linux kernel, it's called the denial of service. If you have a single application that can spam the kernel to the point that somebody else can't use the network card.
00:33:54.924 - 00:34:02.908, Speaker A: So you have to kind of build these like very similar problem resource containers, like around in any kind of shared system.
00:34:03.076 - 00:34:03.628, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:34:03.716 - 00:34:14.876, Speaker A: And with crypto, like, you don't have like the hardest thing about crypto is that you have a financial incentive to spend. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:34:14.900 - 00:34:37.144, Speaker C: Like, well, I mean, the way I think about it is like there's been like anti network effects with usage for pretty much every network. And then with this you probably could solve it. Can you talk a little bit on this fee stuff, local fee markets, but also like priority fees kicking in? I think with Jito it was just like you started to see like a whole, but not all, my understanding, not all projects have like adopted this. So what does that kind of state look like today?
00:34:38.044 - 00:35:27.342, Speaker A: So the way that like Solana priority fees work is that the app developer can add them to the transaction or the wallet. So it's kind of flexible where it's done and usually actually recommend that app developers do it because they are monitoring their own markets and they know exactly when they're getting saturated or not. So they are probably best at figuring out what the priority price should be to access that. The way that the scheduler works, and it's not perfect, is that it sorts all the transactions by priority fee. So that seems simple, right? You just like, you verify, validate that they can pay the fee, then you sort them and then you start filling up the block. And there's two dimensions to the block. One is the total block space, which is like 48 million compute units.
00:35:27.342 - 00:36:26.694, Speaker A: And then no single writable account can exceed 12 million compute units. So if you have a NFT mint, or like liquidation, or like bonk, with whatever market that is being spammed, right, that particular market has a state and that state is writable. And everyone that is trying to access that particular market is going to add compute units to that one location on chain and eventually it will hit 12 million and you can no longer add any more transactions to exceed that capacity. So then you have to go find some other state that isn't saturated and you will add highest priority fees there. So that incentivizes people that are accessing that specific market to outbid the 12 million limit to be at the bottom price there. But that doesn't mean that for block inclusion, you have to outbid that market. You can still send a normal transaction.
00:36:26.694 - 00:37:10.784, Speaker A: And our ping service sends, if you go to explore, dot Solana.com, comma, we have this ping, and it sends unprioritized transactions, and it shows you the average ping time of a dumb unprioritized transaction and how long it would take for it to land in a block. And we do see some block saturation now, which is cool. So what's cool about it is that the incentives for validators are now like, okay, blocks are saturated. I should actually double the block space. So we have more hotspots that can all increase their fees concurrently, instead of limiting the block space and trying to squeeze more out of the average user.
00:37:13.444 - 00:37:30.704, Speaker D: For any listener that might be unfamiliar with the topic we were discussing, when we're talking about fees going up and fee spikes and those kinds of things, our fee spikes are still fractions of a penny. So these are not fee spikes as you might be familiar with on other.
00:37:30.884 - 00:38:11.598, Speaker A: I think you have to be a bit more accurate there. So if you go to, like, Solana compass, they have a pretty good real time system. And if you can look, you can actually look at max versus min and average versus median. And you see that sometimes in a block, max extra fee is like one sol, like 1.2 sol, which is like, what do you expect to pay in ethereum, that's $100. So usually that means some bot liquidator decided that the maximum fee at that opportunity was, like, worth it that much. But at the same time, you can see the minimum fee was like, basically zero.
00:38:11.598 - 00:38:15.470, Speaker A: It's the blue part and the minimum.
00:38:15.542 - 00:38:18.318, Speaker C: Also, to your point, it still gets. There's still inclusion.
00:38:18.366 - 00:38:29.562, Speaker A: So that was observed, minimum, included fee. And then you can also look at the average versus the. The median. And most of the time, there's a very large difference between the two, although sometimes they cross.
00:38:29.618 - 00:38:30.810, Speaker B: You can see it right here.
00:38:31.002 - 00:38:49.214, Speaker D: Yeah, well, this is a perfect example of what you were just referring to with, like, the defi example. Totally. It's like somebody made the decision that the decision to send that one sole fee was profitable for that particular transaction, yet it's not affecting folks who are trying to use the chain for alternate purposes.
00:38:51.074 - 00:39:22.866, Speaker A: Yeah, and you cannot. So this is like, what about l two s? What about Zk? You cannot solve hotspots with any of those technologies because they're content dependent. Like, if you think about it, there's that one opportunity, that one price disparity between the, whatever, that market a and market b. That's worth $100. It doesn't matter if you, if you, like, handle it in zero with zero knowledge proves or in a roll up or whatever. It's the cost of that. Accessing that opportunity is $100.
00:39:22.866 - 00:39:52.444, Speaker A: Somebody that is economically incentivized is going to pay 100 to be first to access it. And it doesn't matter. Right? Like, moving that to a different layer is not going to solve anything. And this is like, to me, like the economics of a single integrated system that can handle multiple of these in parallel are awesome because, yeah, let's increase block space. Let's handle more hotspots. Let's get more stuff on chain. That's worth money, right? Like more NFT is more of everything.
00:39:52.444 - 00:40:04.164, Speaker A: And the hotspots should subsidize the cost of the validators to just keep buying more cores because, like, it's like a really, really well aligned, like, I think economics.
00:40:05.144 - 00:40:05.568, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:40:05.616 - 00:40:27.160, Speaker C: Just to round out this discussion, because I'd be remiss not to ask the question because I feel like a lot of criticism has been like, oh, inflation and it's not sustainable and validators being subsidized by the foundation and they're not profitable. This is all a Ponzi. This is all, and I want to give you guys an opportunity to really, like, parse this through because I feel like some of that is lost in the discourse of Twitter.
00:40:27.352 - 00:41:28.078, Speaker A: So, like, the, this is you guys, push back. If I'm making an argument that's not logical, please push back. So my understanding is that Solana is going to run as long as the validators can pay for the hardware and for their operational overhead, right? Like, if whatever their returns are, cover the cost of the hardware and like, the OPSEC, they will continue running the chain because why not, right? They don't really care about the price as long as, like, they're getting paid more than the cost of the boxes, right? A hobbyist is going to cost, is going to put their cost to their Opsec at zero because they're doing it as a hobby, but they still have to pay for the hardware. Right? Now, a system from latitude costs $350 a month, right? You can go buy it. It covers like one gigabit connection. Sixty four cents per terabyte is pretty cheap. So you have 2200 validators right now times 350, times twelve.
00:41:28.078 - 00:41:53.104, Speaker A: It's about 9.2 million a year in hardware costs. This is the bare bones. You can probably the lowest estimate we can give for running Solana, right? So it does 30 million. There's 30 million second per year. Right. And it does about 500 tps of user transactions, not votes.
00:41:53.104 - 00:42:18.492, Speaker A: So $9 divided by 30 million times 500 is 0.00,616. So that's the average price per transaction that the network needs to charge to keep it running. That's really cheap. Right. Sometimes they're lower than that, because our fee markets are, like, priority based. Sometimes they're higher. Right now, they're much higher than that.
00:42:18.492 - 00:42:56.294, Speaker A: So as long as no one's going to balk at the idea that Solana, if Solana can charge zero, zero, six, so, like, what is that zero point, zero, six cents per transaction and survive, it means it's a very cheap network that's sustainable. If the average fee is above that, great validators. The network is making money. If it's below that, then, yeah, the network is subsidizing the cost of running it. I think this is the missed point, is that the cost of proof of stake networks is really, really cheap. Ridiculously cheap. They're not paying for electricity to pick the quorum.
00:42:56.294 - 00:43:22.848, Speaker A: So it's just the hardware. And because we can stuff a lot of transactions in this hardware, the average cost that each transaction needs to pay is pretty low. Now, that may not always be the case. Right. Like, during the bear market, it was not generating that many fees. I think it was, like, maybe doing about $3 million worth of fees per year during the bottom of the pair. Right now, I think it's close to 100 million.
00:43:22.848 - 00:43:57.404, Speaker A: So, like, yeah, inflation. Yeah, inflation is like, in my mind, it's like, needs to be high enough for people to rationally want to stake, but low enough that not everybody stakes 100% of their tokens. And two, the slashing risk needs to be significant enough that people take care in picking who they stake with. This is all inflation and slashing need to balance. Is those two kind of two dependencies.
00:43:58.624 - 00:44:49.492, Speaker B: I have a, I have a much. That was like, I mean, that was a good pushback. Totally. I have a much, like, more left bell curve, basically response when, when folks ask about, like, validators being subsidized by Solana, the Solana foundation, which is because you guys have the Ben, what's the program called? The delegation program. Right, where, like, x percentage of validators, I think, are paid through the delegation program. I would just look at, like, the history of ETH and, like, look at the, you know, consensus, basically, like, consensus in 2016 and 2017 and Lubin and the Ethereum foundation, and basically, like, spending capital to bootstrap growth in an ecosystem with, whether it's tooling or like infura and metamask and infrastructure and grants. That's a way to get a network off the ground.
00:44:49.492 - 00:44:51.340, Speaker B: But I'd be curious how you think about that, Ben.
00:44:51.492 - 00:45:34.056, Speaker D: Totally. And I'll just make a clear distinction, just so people are aware. So, like, the delegation program is not the Solana foundation paying anybody or anything like that to run infrastructure on the network. All it is, is a delegation of the soul, that the Solana foundation has some portion of the soul to your validator for some duration of time, so that you can get your validator up and running, so that you're somewhat profitable and that you can start to go get your own organic stake with the intention that over time, the Solana foundation removes that stake, and you are your own self sufficient validator. And so that's not, there's no, like, payment of soul. There's no payment of cash or anything like that. It's just delegation of stake for some pre determined, determined amount of time.
00:45:34.056 - 00:46:14.972, Speaker D: And then it's as long as you meet certain uptime and performance requirements, like, if you are constantly offline and all these things Solana foundation pulls that way. It's also important to note that we recently hired a head of staking ecosystem, Ben Hawkins, who used to run the cogent validator in the Solana ecosystem. He's actually working on a revamp for how we do. The delegation program in the era of the Solana ecosystem has grown to the point where it is we might not need this in the form that it was created originally. How can we make it better and more efficient in the future, given that the ecosystem is, like, more mature and might not need this subsidy and the capacity that we're doing it at the.
00:46:14.988 - 00:46:19.944, Speaker A: Moment, what percentage of the stake does the foundation run right now?
00:46:21.484 - 00:46:24.304, Speaker D: That's a good question. Number off the top of my head.
00:46:24.684 - 00:46:27.300, Speaker A: It's below 20, I think above ten.
00:46:27.492 - 00:46:30.012, Speaker C: Latest I take was, like, 14 ish or so.
00:46:30.108 - 00:46:52.204, Speaker A: Okay, right, so, so, like, the way that inflation works is global inflation. If there's 14% left, everyone else returns go higher. Right? Does everyone make sense? Does that make sense? So, like. So that means that, like, there will be some amount of nodes that keep running the network. Given that the fees right now are north of 100 mil.
00:46:54.464 - 00:46:54.960, Speaker B: I think it's.
00:46:54.992 - 00:47:47.974, Speaker C: Really, like, if you look at it from a, like, financial, like, a p and l standpoint of the network, and people have done this for Ethereum and for Solana, what you're saying is fixed overhead is, like, roughly 9 million that potentially goes down with hardware improvements or Moore's law, yada yada, if you believe that. But let's just assume 910 million spread across everyone that participates and does validation. And then on the fee side, like the variable cost of processing a transaction relative to what you're charging, there's a pretty big gap there. Like a margin of, like an operating margin of, like, I forget the numbers that you quoted, but it's fairly healthy. It's like what you're saying is you need to believe that the network continues to crank out decent fees. And look, sure, that margin might compress over time, but it's still pretty healthy tech like margin.
00:47:48.554 - 00:47:59.126, Speaker A: If it's content based, it might not compress. If the network was purely charging for data, it should 100% compress because it's commoditized.
00:47:59.190 - 00:48:02.422, Speaker C: But if it's high value content, then the margin stays high.
00:48:02.518 - 00:48:16.314, Speaker A: This is, I feel like the Achilles heel of the modularity thesis is that, like, the data is going to be commodity based and also would have to compete with a network that can take content and subsidize the data.
00:48:19.854 - 00:48:33.878, Speaker C: The point on inflation that I just want to hash out is what people in a proof of stake system, I mean, push back or correct me if none of this is right, but if everyone is staked, if 100% of the supply is being staked, no one gets diluted.
00:48:33.926 - 00:48:59.058, Speaker A: It's sort of just, you know, mathematically, inflation is equivalent. Global inflation, right? Like, is equivalent to you burn 5% of the stakers account balances, and then you do a split to bring, like, one, you know, 95 to one split right across the entire thing. So the non stakers are back to where they originally were, but everyone else balance goes up.
00:48:59.146 - 00:49:02.254, Speaker C: Yeah, but it's really the non stakers that get diluted.
00:49:03.154 - 00:49:37.678, Speaker D: The way that I've been trying to describe it to people who are not steeped in crypto. Like my father, for example, over Christmas, he was trying to understand Solana staking, and I was explaining it to him. It's kind of like treasure. Buying treasury bills, you are locking up your capital for some period of time. Obviously, this is not a loan, but it's the same type of mechanic. You are locking up your capital for some period of time in order to remain with the inflation rate of the monetary system of the United States. And then if you keep buying treasury bills or you keep your money in treasury bills, you do not get diluted by inflation.
00:49:37.678 - 00:49:48.154, Speaker D: But if you are, like on Solana, if you are staking, you do not get it diluted by staking or by inflation. But if you are not staking, then you are getting diluted.
00:49:48.654 - 00:50:04.510, Speaker C: The question that I just wanted to finish this discussion is around when you initially design the inflation curve. Back in the day, my understanding. So you have to make certain assumptions about profitable network. Do you think that that is high today?
00:50:04.662 - 00:50:06.214, Speaker A: Do you remark it?
00:50:06.374 - 00:50:07.634, Speaker C: How do you do that?
00:50:10.694 - 00:50:39.476, Speaker A: I didn't think inflation mattered because I'm in John Carboneau's camp. It's just numbers moving around the black box. So, like, I honestly, like, I thought the curve that cosmos had was pretty good. And most of the validators that we had initially came from Cosmos and they kind of picked a similar one. So that was kind of the theory that I had. Like, I don't think it matters. Like, it needs to be high enough that some people stake rationally.
00:50:39.476 - 00:51:02.158, Speaker A: You need some stakers to pick the quorum. The quorum can't cause a safety violation that can halt the network. But a well managed run system, the quorum cannot really do anything. So you need some incentives for people to stake to pick the quorum. And you need some. A stick slashing for people to do a good job when they pick the quorum. That's it.
00:51:02.158 - 00:51:17.084, Speaker A: And, like, what the curve is. And, like, it's probably too high right now. Like, I think it could actually be like ten times lower and everything would be fine. So, like, I don't think the costs matter that much at the end of the day.
00:51:19.024 - 00:51:49.924, Speaker B: All right, everyone, so we talk a lot about the institutions coming into crypto on empire. Santi and I are both headed out to London March 18 to 20th for blockworks 8th ever digital asset Summit. Das. This is an institutional buttoned up conference that we've hosted since 2019. I like to joke that it is probably the last remaining kind of suit and tie event in crypto. People are still wearing suit and tie. It's pretty funny, but you'll actually hear from a lot of the largest institutions in the world coming from standard, Charter, FIS, JPMorgan, framework.
00:51:49.924 - 00:52:09.398, Speaker B: Folks coming out. Wintermute, Vanek, Goldman Sachs there are a couple big themes of this conference. One, bitcoin catalysts, the halving and the spot ETF. Two, a view from the buy side. Three, Rwas tokenization and stablecoins. Four, global regulatory frameworks. Five, institutional infrastructure, including banking and payments.
00:52:09.398 - 00:52:28.642, Speaker B: And six, the macro case for crypto. If you have anything to do with the institutional side of crypto, you have to be there. Santi and I got your back. We hooked you up with a 20% off code. It is empire 20. There is a little competition running internally at blockworks to see who can drive the most number of tickets. So help Santi and I out register.
00:52:28.642 - 00:52:52.754, Speaker B: Register with our code and you get 20% off. That is empire 20. All right, I mentioned them in the pre roll, now I'm going to bring them up again. It's arbitrum. Santi and I are really fed up with these high fees, and we're really excited to have teamed up with Arbitrum for the next couple of months on empire. As the leading Ethereum scaling solution. Arbitrum now powers hundreds of decentralized apps across defi, perps, nfts, gaming, and a whole lot more.
00:52:52.754 - 00:53:25.898, Speaker B: The team has showed us everything in the ecosystem, both now and what's to come, and we're really, really excited about it. Arbitrum allows both daily users and developers to interact with Ethereum at scale with low fees and faster transactions. The way the team got me excited was through portal arbitrum IO. So my call to action to you is to get started by visiting portal arbitrum IO. Go experience on chain like it was meant to be. For a lot of empire listeners, your crypto is not just another number on the screen, it's part of your future. I know Santi and myself feel that way.
00:53:25.898 - 00:54:16.140, Speaker B: Our security sponsor of this episode, Harper, takes this responsibility seriously and is the only wallet security tool that shields users from both on chain threats and sneaky off chain signature attacks. If you've ever been in that situation where you're moving quickly, you approve something on chain, you realize that the address might be a dubious address. Or you're really hoping that you could take that back. Harpy has you covered. Harpy can redirect your assets to your self custody vault, ensuring they remain completely under your control, safe and sound. With Harpy's always on monitoring, you're not just detecting threats, you're actively blocking and recovering compromised assets from malicious transactions before they can even confirm. On chain Harpy is the only wallet security solution that protected 100% of its users from attacks like the ledger one in q four, which was an off chain signature attack.
00:54:16.140 - 00:54:49.944, Speaker B: So if you're serious about protecting your crypto investments, it's time to make the switch. Secure your wallet for free at Harpy IO, forward slash empire. That's Harpy. H a r p I E I o. Forward slash Empire. If you want it to be even easier, just click the link in the show notes I want to get us into start moving into the next part of the conversation, but maybe to wrap this part about the SVM and stuff. There's this kind of trend right now of talking about the SVM for execution, ethereum for settlement, Celestia for data availability.
00:54:49.944 - 00:55:10.204, Speaker B: Eclipse came out, obviously. I'd just be curious, maybe a two part question. Totally. Like, what are your thoughts on shipping the SVM elsewhere? And maybe it's just one question, how does that impact you guys? How does that tie into your strategy? What are the economics of that in your mind? What do you think of that strategy as a whole, and how's that going to play out?
00:55:14.104 - 00:55:36.284, Speaker A: The way to think of it is that I would wish my competitors were so blinded by greed that they build close sword systems that try to keep all of their jewels locked up. That would be great. That's.
00:55:37.544 - 00:55:39.244, Speaker B: You love Linux, I can tell.
00:55:39.744 - 00:56:17.860, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, there's no way you could compete with the fastest growing possible ecosystem. And the fastest growing one is the one that is able to commoditize the commodity parts of it the fastest and give them away. And that prevents a competitor from establishing a foothold and stuff like that. So it would be bad for Solana if another parallel virtual machine was gaining traction as a roll up environment, actually. So it's actually good. Even though execution fees that could be captured on Solana are now being captured on eclipse, you can think of it as that way.
00:56:17.860 - 00:56:54.462, Speaker A: The total addressable market of getting priority fees and any network is x, and now Eclipse is gaining some of that instead of Solana. It's better for that to be SVM. It would be better if Coinbase launched an SVM roll up. It'd be better if finance launched an SVM roll up than an EVM one. Because I think the bigger picture here is getting more devs to launch more products and growing the overall pie. And having a bigger share of that pie is more important than having, you know, a big share of air.
00:56:54.518 - 00:56:58.678, Speaker B: You'd rather have them be SBM. Be SBM and have them get comfortable with it.
00:56:58.766 - 00:56:59.394, Speaker A: Right.
00:57:00.934 - 00:57:32.012, Speaker C: Just one minor point around security and the developer experience. You know, obviously, from my standpoint, one of the biggest issues that crypto faces today is security. You keep having reentrancy attacks. You could argue a language like move potentially is just more robust to fix security. One. How do you guys think about security in general? Like, and like, I think when I've talked to you years ago, it was like a lot of the projects in Solana were closed source. I think the majority now are actually open source, which is.
00:57:32.012 - 00:57:35.324, Speaker C: I was surprised by that status bias.
00:57:35.444 - 00:57:38.704, Speaker A: Like, I guess, good point.
00:57:39.644 - 00:57:52.700, Speaker C: But, yeah, I just wanted to pick your brain on how do you think about security at the code level, just preventing bugs and if move is ever in your radar of like yeah, close.
00:57:52.772 - 00:58:38.264, Speaker A: Source is not going to save you because attackers will just fuzz the binaries. They've built tools that are sophisticated enough that it doesn't matter if it's open source or not. And I think it'll slow down growth on the security side. Specifically, move I think is pretty cool. It's really, really hard to build a language, and we have a team that is actually building a LLVM front end that will compile move to SVM. And part of that challenge is making sure that SVM can support that, and that's making some changes to the SVM environment that are making it a bit more generalized to support languages with a bit heavier runtime. That's great.
00:58:38.264 - 00:59:25.694, Speaker A: I think that you can do the same proof systems with rust. Connie Proof Steegs is for us. Certura does this so squads protocol proved their multisig with using Ottersex prover. So all the stuff you can do in rust can do in solidity too. Provers exist for every language because they work actually on the most of the time they don't work in the front end language, they work on some intermediate representation. And actually the lower level you go, the better for finding bugs, in my opinion. I think that security, there's some changes that I've thought about that I've proposed, but we haven't really seriously considered them.
00:59:25.694 - 01:00:08.282, Speaker A: My feeling for security is that redundancy is the best way. You have two client implementations, firedancer and, and labs, and maybe three like Syndica is working on the Zic version. You can also have two implementations of the exact same orca market built by different teams, and if the transactions ever diverge, you abort. We can do that actually in the SVM layer, we can start adding support for redundancy at the implementation side. I think to me that's probably the only way we can ever make these systems robust and secure. I'll add one, but like yeah, I'll.
01:00:08.298 - 01:00:56.646, Speaker D: Just add one last thing on the security front and then we can move on to next topic. But this was a good opportunity to just plug token extensions, otherwise known as Token 22. Token extensions are basically like the next iteration of the SPL Token standard. One of the key features of token extensions is something called permanent delegate authority, where theoretically you can mint tokens to this standard and say you have a DAO that owns the permanent mint authority, you actually have burn and revoke rights over that token in perpetuity until that is removed from that dao. For example, there's a huge hack. You say USDC is a token extensions token. 100 million USDC gets drained out of this thing.
01:00:56.646 - 01:01:34.084, Speaker D: The DAO can actually meet together and take a vote to revoke those tokens directly from the wallet. So that's just another thing as it relates to like compliance and security. As we get further into like the maturation of crypto and crypto, abiding by all the laws that we're going to need to abide by, at least in the United States, that's something that we can at least throw a bone to regulators and like people in the legal profession, where we can avoid these types of huge hacks in the future in novel ways outside of just the technology security that Tully was talking about.
01:01:35.544 - 01:01:42.376, Speaker C: I guess USDC is like this across all chains, is my understanding, and tether. They can freeze it, they can burn.
01:01:42.400 - 01:02:02.394, Speaker D: It, so they can freeze as it exists today. But until, if they were to change it into a token extensions token on Solana, that would give them full like physical revoke or burn capacity. You can always freeze the tokens in that wallet. They always just stay in that wallet. You just need to remind them elsewhere.
01:02:02.974 - 01:02:24.322, Speaker A: Yeah, the problem here is that these are like governance. Yeah, governance becomes hard and then there's delays between the attack happens. You need like somebody to convince the governance, and that usually requires like a court order, and that's two weeks after that.
01:02:24.418 - 01:02:43.118, Speaker B: Well, how are you thinking about governance in general? Like when you started bringing up multiple clients? Totally. Like the thing I was thinking about in my head, I've seen you writing more and I was like, oh, this is totally going into the next stage of like, now. This is, you need math, soul, alignment, the vision of soul, and like, yeah, how are you thinking about governance in general?
01:02:43.246 - 01:02:54.126, Speaker A: Alignment is just like l seven engineering. You have to go talk to a bunch of people across the and get everyone aligned and you pitch them a doc and you're like, we're going to do this.
01:02:54.190 - 01:02:54.790, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:02:54.942 - 01:02:57.318, Speaker A: Are you guys going to support it or block?
01:02:57.366 - 01:02:58.326, Speaker B: Are we aligned or not?
01:02:58.390 - 01:03:03.114, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, exactly. Like, how do you, all of a sudden it's a job.
01:03:03.494 - 01:03:20.444, Speaker B: How do you think about who has the power? Because if you. So Linux, like, you've mentioned Linux bunch, and I can tell you have a strong affinity for Linux, like decentralized, like open source, but like what's the guy's name? Like Linus has, you know, an overwhelming amount of power, I'd say there.
01:03:20.484 - 01:03:23.908, Speaker A: So like influence, but he would you.
01:03:23.956 - 01:03:25.540, Speaker B: Like to have in solo?
01:03:25.572 - 01:03:46.110, Speaker A: I don't think, I think influence, you can have as much of it as you want as long as everyone else can take it away as soon as you do something bad. So it doesn't matter how much, it doesn't matter how much influence somebody has, as long as it's not actual power. Linus doesn't control Linux. He's got influence over it because he keeps doing a pretty good job.
01:03:46.262 - 01:03:48.274, Speaker B: He doesn't have power. He has the influence.
01:03:50.174 - 01:04:21.534, Speaker A: Lots of people in the Solana ecosystem of influence, I probably have the most because I'm an engineer and I see stuff. But as soon as I like, people push back on my ideas all the time. And this has been probably because I hired a bunch of my friends that I worked with as peers, but they were like able to, like in their ten years prior to Solana were like, no, that's a dumb idea. And it's like, we're not gonna build back. So. Yeah, like that, yeah.
01:04:22.034 - 01:04:45.214, Speaker D: I also think you're underselling it too. I mean, it's a testament to like, your personality is that like people feel comfortable pushing back on your ideas because they know you're just trying to get to the right answer. And I think that that is so important when it relates to the ecosystem and the technology that everyone is collectively building is that it's not what Toli says goes, it's, Toli has an idea, let's make this better.
01:04:45.594 - 01:05:40.718, Speaker A: Yeah, and like that, that's been like, I think that's just kind of like how actually software is developed basically everywhere else. Like if you go inside Microsoft or Google, you have a bunch of teams with different needs and ideas of what they want to do. The CEO doesn't make any of those decisions. There's people that have influence over the direction of the technology, but that influence is not based on the chart, it's based on their ability to argue a specific design. And I think that's actually fine. Like, there's going to be like, we'll fight over the right way to do economic, you know, exponential fees on write locks or like bonding curve for state. That's all fine, like, and the process is good and people like come to a decision like, yeah, you've identified the right problem and you have a good solution and it's the right one to do right now.
01:05:40.718 - 01:06:14.256, Speaker A: We'll go fix, we'll go, we'll go ship it. Ultimately though, like, I think you have this power of the user soft fork and you've seen this play out, I think in bitcoin land, probably the best during the block size wars. And that's the ultimate power. I think it's the futarchy system where if people really want it, they can fork it. And there's an economic opportunity to fork. There's a reason for somebody to. To go create a Solana.
01:06:14.256 - 01:06:37.684, Speaker A: No. Anatolia. Right? And like, maybe if. If I suck, that would be viable and there's nothing anyone could. I can do nothing to stop them. And as soon as there's enough, like, of a market demand to do that, all the centralized exchanges will list that coin. And because they'll get fees from trading, they don't care.
01:06:37.684 - 01:07:17.936, Speaker A: Right. It'll just like all that stuff is playing out. I think in the normal kind of like development, I think there's stuff that we generally like to do is any questions of setting hyper parameters for economics? We leave it. We try to make that a validator like vote because the economics impact how they are able to monetize stake, right. And that impacts their ability to run the network. So generally that's been like, I think a pretty good filter is that like, hey, if this impacts how validators earn money, this change is necessary for XYZ. You guys set the hyper parameters.
01:07:17.936 - 01:07:24.456, Speaker A: We'll try to, you know, or we just try to make sure that they don't cause the system to fail. Right. Like that. That's it.
01:07:24.600 - 01:08:08.784, Speaker C: I've heard you maybe transitioning more towards, like, things that you're excited in terms of use cases. And Ben, I want to also pick on you because I think you see a lot of this, but I've heard you totally say, hey, look, I don't necessarily care if most of the value accrues to apps, not to talk about price, but I am curious. You could call it the fat protocol thesis. People have tried to think about where value accrual will happen. We've talked a lot about economics and fees. I'm curious, picking on both of you, how do you foresee the network to evolve as you start getting more usage, all these different applications and content and value accrual?
01:08:09.964 - 01:09:11.673, Speaker A: I think, like, I would say that, like, up to now, all of crypto has been disappointing in the accrual because it's very reflexive. I think protocols on Ethereum make the most fees, not because they're serving the most users or creating the most values, because ETH has valued highly and they're able to kind of get a percentage of that. And that, to me, is like a bad sign. It means that they're kind of like scraping a little bit off the top of the value of ethereum and kind of like. And it kind of works right like and you can try to like meme it into ultrasound money. But what I would rather see is real world stuff that has value to humans. Like a wireless sell plan, like something that is external to crypto that is forcing somebody that did their job and grew some food and got money to pay a validator to go include transactions that kind of real world tie into the economy I think is really really important.
01:09:11.673 - 01:09:48.198, Speaker A: And we need more of that and stuff thats not reflexive. Id rather see things priced in real world assets instead of Sol and those generate enough fees for validators to pay themselves. If the Dexs on Solana were trading real world assets against USDC and that was generating enough fees to cover the hardware cost of the network, it will run forever. Its no longer dependent on the price of soul, no longer depend on anything. It just keeps running and its providing value to humans. Its done. But right now were not there yet.
01:09:48.198 - 01:10:28.796, Speaker A: Things are still tied to the underlying spam resistant asset. For some reason. I think this is part of the hangover from bitcoin and I think there is tremendous value that bitcoin creates as a decentralized censorship resistance store value. When my parents stuffed the USSR, literally they would only let people take $50 a person. So seven people, dollar 350, that was it. You need something like bitcoin right? But like I think everything else that's in the execution layer doesn't need to be that. And bitcoin runs without economics.
01:10:28.796 - 01:10:32.304, Speaker A: It's just exists because it's because of the.
01:10:32.804 - 01:11:05.656, Speaker D: Yeah, I tweeted about this not long ago. It's like the goal of what we're building here is a hardened infrastructure layer to allow people to create monetary transfer or value transfer applications. I think once you have a hardened infrastructure layer, the value accrual moves up the stack just as it did in web two. People built applications. People built businesses on top of this tech stack. And the applications were the things that accrued value. And people can figure out value accrual mechanisms there.
01:11:05.656 - 01:11:55.624, Speaker D: Now I'll caveat that with the hangover of bitcoin and maybe the Ethereum ultrasound money meme, is that it's entirely out of our hands. Like the Solana Foundation, Solana Labs, Anatoly, anybody, the ecosystem alone can decide that, hey, we want to introduce some larger burn mechanism and we want to drive value to the sol token or we want to do something like that. Longer term, it's a decentralized ecosystem, and we don't know how that's ultimately going to play out. The mission statement of why Toli originally created the blockchain and what the Solana foundation is trying to do from, like, an ecosystem growth perspective is to make it a easy to use platform to build these types of applications and have, hopefully, most of the value accrue to the applications that are being built atop.
01:11:55.784 - 01:11:56.512, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:11:56.688 - 01:12:07.136, Speaker C: Now, this is where I foresee the skeptics saying, well, that's blockchain, not crypto. Like, why. Why even have a token called soul? Like, you know, and the real answer.
01:12:07.160 - 01:12:08.404, Speaker D: How the network works.
01:12:08.784 - 01:12:10.208, Speaker A: Well, exactly. Right.
01:12:10.376 - 01:12:26.960, Speaker C: I was just, I was just imagining someone, like, saying blockchain, not crypto. But it's like, the reality is you need a token for coordination and economic security. Like, it doesn't obliviate the need for soul. It's just, if ten, if value has been created today on a 99% have.
01:12:26.992 - 01:13:18.680, Speaker A: Zero value, why would you, as soon as you build a permission system, you're like, well, why don't you use your database? The whole point of it being permissionless is that the, it creates trust minimization. When you have a very large, uncountably large number of people that run the system, you kind of get a very hard sense of security. Right? Like, I don't know what it. What it would take for these systems to, like, actually handle, like, world's finances. Like, trillions of dollars per day moving through this. Maybe you do need 100,000 full nodes run by every financial institution in the world, right? And there's no way that's a permissioned environment. So, like, in my mind, like, the highest impact thing we could build is permissionless, high performance, like, single state machine.
01:13:18.832 - 01:13:23.844, Speaker B: How far off are you, do you think, from that vision, tola, this, like, vision of Nasdaq on Solana.
01:13:27.464 - 01:14:01.704, Speaker A: Fire dancers, performance numbers, we could probably get there, but it would, we would have to cheat by running on specialized hardware in specific data centers and stuff. But the fact that it would work would be, if there's demand, you can get there and then start working on how do we solve all these other problems? How do we get more data centers, more infra involved? The problem isn't, I think the technology is there already. It's just the demand isn't there to drive everything else.
01:14:01.844 - 01:14:03.764, Speaker B: Where do you think demand ends up coming from?
01:14:05.744 - 01:14:33.116, Speaker A: This is a really good question, man. My theory is that when it first started, I thought I was replaying that moment in mobile when we went from feature phones to smartphones, and it was like one year we literally saw 80% dominance by smartphones. And I thought, oh, man, we have to get Solana out the door as fast as possible. It's going to feel like one year.
01:14:33.140 - 01:14:36.184, Speaker B: You'Re going to be the iPhone moment and like, boom, and it's good to go.
01:14:36.764 - 01:15:30.456, Speaker A: And I think what I realize now is that finance and money is something that humans really, really have a hard time giving up control over to automated systems, for good reason, because when this shit breaks it back. So it's going to take a very long time for, like, high finance to actually start kind of moving, moving stuff over. But I, like, you know, the world, the science fiction version of the future. 100% of the world's finance runs on these systems that are trust minimized. Probably a big chunk of the execution runs on something like Solana. That's like information bus that's synchronized at the speed of light is really, really cool, right? Like, why wouldn't you use it once it's there, right? How long? That's going to take a long, long ass time. Well, I think I want to get.
01:15:30.480 - 01:15:33.124, Speaker C: Your thoughts on privacy on that point.
01:15:33.504 - 01:16:19.780, Speaker A: I think that's a feature of the smart contracts. I don't think you need privacy for the quorum. Like, I think, I think you need attribution for slashing and stuff like that. So you kind of, like, if you're trying to build, like, some really, really low level privacy version of bitcoin, you could probably do something very clever at the proof of work and quorum and kind of layer stuff on top to where things are super, super private. But I think for payments, like, businesses want privacy, but they also want auditability and compliance and all this other stuff. Right? Like, there's so many different constraints. That feels very much like custom smart contracts for different.
01:16:19.780 - 01:16:21.264, Speaker A: For different features.
01:16:22.084 - 01:16:29.864, Speaker B: Ben, where do you, I guess, same question over to you. Like, where do you think the demand ends up coming from? Because you probably talked to more folks building in Solana than anyone else.
01:16:30.324 - 01:16:46.904, Speaker D: Yeah. So I've kind of, like, flipped on where I thought the demand was going to come from. I originally thought it was going to come from the growth of Defi in the earlier days. Like, earlier days. I'm talking about, like, 2019 Ethereum. I thought that that was like a real pivotal moment.
01:16:47.204 - 01:16:49.104, Speaker B: Coinbase and totally.
01:16:50.484 - 01:17:50.624, Speaker D: And I've kind of flipped to, I guess it's like a product of, like, me maturing as like, my own inner product builder, but, like, you need a product that is just ten times better and equally as easy to use for the end user for people to make a switch from one thing to another. And it wasn't until like somewhat recently where I saw that, well, people have always been talking about stablecoins as this killer use case. But I kind of thought like, beyond this, as I've talked to a few people who are building different types of payments or financial applications, specifically in the RWA tokenization space. I'm specifically talking about what Franklin Templeton is doing with their Benji token, or what Ando is doing with USDy is basically they're tokenizing a money market fund. So it's a yield bearing token, but it's essentially representing cash. You have effectively a money market token that is yielding you whatever the risk free rate is that you can use as cash. So in a future scenario, say the user experience of crypto is super easy.
01:17:50.624 - 01:18:30.218, Speaker D: We have it easily custodied on your mobile phone, and you can effectively do like a tap to pay type system. You have the option to hold a non yield bearing cash in USDC, USDT, or something else. Or you have a yield bearing cash in the benji token or the USDY. Why would any consumer hold the non yield bearing token over the yield bearing token? Currently I have money in money market funds. If I ever need that cash, it's a minimum t plus two event for me to get liquidity for that thing. And then I can then go pay for groceries or pay rent or pay whatever I need to do. If I just have this yield bearing token sitting in my wallet, I can pay rent at any time with that token.
01:18:30.218 - 01:19:03.374, Speaker D: And I think that's just a fundamentally better product. The thing that is just impeding us right now is the user experience of that, which is why we were excited about saga and about the mobile push and these types of things to try and make it more usable, move crypto from desktop, desktop to mobile. And I think we're still in that phase. But it's those types of applications that I think get a lot of people using crypto immediately, and then everything else is downstream from there. When you already have tokens in your wallet, then you're like, where can I put this to work? Oh, maybe I'll go buy an NFT, maybe I'll use this application over here. And you're already crypto native. You're already digitally native.
01:19:04.434 - 01:19:36.314, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. It unlocks like nonlinear consumer demand. A different, like the velocity of it is, I think, gonna really surprise all of us. On the upside, you spoke about the saga. This was something funny enough, a lot of people were like, why are they wasting their time with this? You know, I'm like, I actually felt that at the time when we had you, I felt that this is the type of thinking that is kind of a hallmark of your team, which is you're willing to try stuff that just for better, for worse. Other teams just can't or won't. And it was a felt like a moonshot.
01:19:36.314 - 01:19:44.472, Speaker C: But, you know, now everyone's like, wow, this thing can actually disrupt. Now. It's like, okay, can we disrupt the App Store? Can we disrupt this? Oligopoly?
01:19:44.608 - 01:19:57.724, Speaker A: We sold 20,000 phones to Apple and Samsung, 6 billion. So the probability of us disrupting the App Stores are 20,000 to 6 billion. It's not zero, but it's 20,000 to 6 billion.
01:19:58.904 - 01:20:01.444, Speaker C: Yeah, it's like. It's like dumb and dumber.
01:20:04.624 - 01:20:05.128, Speaker B: Say it.
01:20:05.176 - 01:20:07.728, Speaker A: Yeah, it's sold out because bonk, basically.
01:20:07.776 - 01:20:12.408, Speaker B: I mean, this is like kind of a meme and kind of a joke. Like, how has your.
01:20:12.576 - 01:20:13.104, Speaker A: Okay.
01:20:13.184 - 01:20:15.804, Speaker B: Your thought process evolved around, like, using.
01:20:16.464 - 01:20:20.424, Speaker C: Yeah, I just want to get your updated refresh views on saga and it's theory.
01:20:20.544 - 01:20:30.764, Speaker A: And this sounds. You guys push back on it, but I think it actually sounds good in theory, but I don't know if it's bases, if it's still based in reality or not, or if I just.
01:20:31.544 - 01:20:32.392, Speaker B: Oh, boy.
01:20:32.528 - 01:21:05.120, Speaker A: Yeah. So, like, Apple and Google charge 20% to 30% on App Store fees. That's a very large tax, and that's very disruptible. The problem is distribution, and getting, like, comparable distribution devs are going to look at what makes them the most money regardless of the tax. Right. Similar to why nobody cares about Ethereum gas fees as long as they're making money. So that's the thing that we need to overcome, is the network effects.
01:21:05.120 - 01:21:38.536, Speaker A: But it's a huge opportunity because most of the way that the App Stores make money is not from Uber. It's not the applications that you use for the stuff that you think about. Oh, my mobile phone is really, really, really important for Uber. No, most of the way they make money is from loot boxes from all of these games and everything else. $100 billion business that Apple and Google simply take a cut off. And that's very disruptible because crypto people are super spenders on the Internet. They're the whales.
01:21:38.536 - 01:22:19.330, Speaker A: And a lot of how these games monetize is, 1% of the audience generates 90% of the revenues. So if we can get 20,000, 100,000 of the spendiest people on the Internet, in the same distribution channel. That's a very lucrative channel. So that's the theory. Is it going to work? I don't know. And the reason why it would work is because those devs are now incentivized to get their whales off of their stores into saga, and they're incentivized to give rewards and reason for that to happen. So my theory was like, we launched this phone Solana ecosystem team.
01:22:19.330 - 01:22:41.044, Speaker A: Start building apps, crypto incentives, and something will pop. And that happened up to be bonk. But now you've saw like an NFT airdrop, the page for the phone, basically like a bunch of other coin drops. So, like, the big question is that works for a 20,000 audience. Can we scale this up to 100,000? Can we scale it up to a million?
01:22:41.584 - 01:23:14.046, Speaker B: I mean, I actually don't think you're crazy. Okay, so here's what's happening on our end totally is. So blockworks is a media company, and a lot of the ways that we make money is like, advertising and sponsorships. 90, like 5% of the world's, or at least the US's, ad spend is controlled by the three or four big group m publicis horizon. The big. The big agencies, basically. So, you know, a normal person there might spend 500 million managing Budweisers, like tv spend alone.
01:23:14.046 - 01:24:02.714, Speaker B: They have now started coming to crypto companies and crypto publishers and podcasters and media companies, saying, and the reason that they're coming is because they believe that we have the wealthiest audience in the world. Basically, they say there is no group of 20 to 30 year olds in the world with this much wealth. So we need, it's the highest value consumer in the world is the crypto audience. Now there are a lot of wealthy 40 year olds. There are a lot of wealthy 50 year olds in the world. There is no group of incredibly Internet native sub 35 years old with this much wealth anywhere else in the world. And they want to do anything that they'll spend, like in advertising, at CPM rates, they might spend ten times the CPM to go reach that consumer.
01:24:02.714 - 01:24:19.620, Speaker B: So if that's the pitch for the Solana phone, let's say my base case is that the industry will grow, let's say, in number of people by ten x in this cycle. Like, if there's 20,000 people today, then that's 200,000 people. It's a decent.
01:24:19.812 - 01:24:40.752, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a real thing. So you need like, at least 100,000 to make it, like, worthwhile. From the hardware perspective, it's really, really hard to. 20,000 units in hardware. 100,000 I can get on board. So, like, yeah, that's. And, yeah, what's next?
01:24:40.768 - 01:24:44.640, Speaker C: What's next? Are you gonna ship another toy?
01:24:44.672 - 01:25:06.080, Speaker A: Like, we don't know. Raj and I are, like, are wrestling with the. With the idea of what to do. We'll figure it out. But I think this is probably the one opportunity in a lifetime to drive a wedge into between, like, in Google and Apple. Like, I don't think there's any other. You will probably see any other one.
01:25:06.080 - 01:25:10.684, Speaker A: So it's like, what else would I be doing? I don't know.
01:25:14.424 - 01:25:20.924, Speaker C: Are there other type of these type of moonshots that you've thought about or may implement in the future?
01:25:21.744 - 01:25:48.790, Speaker A: Phone, like, hardware is always top of mind for me because of my background. I worked on the first augmented reality device. Um, stuff like that. It's just, um. That stuff gets really, really exciting. But it's so early, like, you're layering, like, crypto risk of, is this crypto idea even going to have adoption to, like, is the augmented reality could have any compelling use cases. Right.
01:25:48.790 - 01:26:20.054, Speaker A: Like, with a phone, do you at least have, like, a product that people use? Um, I mean, I'd be down to ship everything. Yeah. Like, we've talked about, like, all sorts of random stuff. I think you have to have a. It comes down to, like, this is a. Could be a really cool idea. Can we find a team that we can fund to do that? Versus do we do it internally? And there's a lot of trade offs with both of those approaches.
01:26:20.054 - 01:26:43.234, Speaker A: But if we're not the. Like, I think if I wasn't ex Qualcomm and had deep connections to how to go build and ship this device where I knew, okay, within 50% of the timeline, we will actually ship this thing. If I didn't have that kind of confidence, I don't think I would be doing it. It's hard to do that for things that you don't know.
01:26:44.094 - 01:27:12.644, Speaker B: I have a question for both you guys. When you look at the other ecosystems, are there any. Is there anything that you look at the other. When you look at other ecosystems, like, is there anything that you say, like, oh, they're doing it really, really well. And I want to take this from that ecosystem this year and start to implement it. Maybe, Ben, it's on a marketing or BD side or Toli, whether it's cosmos or something in Avalanche or something that one of the l two s is doing, like, anything that you guys see that you're really impressed by.
01:27:13.344 - 01:27:54.114, Speaker A: I was impressed by Polygon's BD efforts last year. I would like, I was very dismissive. Like, my theory was that, like, we shouldn't be paying for logos or users or like, it doesn't, none of the stuff matters. And I think it does actually create enough momentum to where people will like, it takes work to get any of those BD deals. You actually have to have, like, the CEO of that company decide, okay, I'm going to associate this thing with this. So they have to do due diligence and get the stuff over the line. When you have enough of those, people will be like, oh, right, they've been vetted by x, Y and z.
01:27:54.114 - 01:28:23.244, Speaker A: I'm going to go build there. So that does actually create some effects. Beyond that, I don't know. I haven't seen anything that was really exciting. I think Celestia data availability, sampling, the fact that they built it and shipped it is pretty cool. That's a technology that I think is worthwhile to have in every blockchain. Like, I think that that should be just adopted everywhere.
01:28:25.504 - 01:29:25.958, Speaker D: I'd say, yeah, I've noticed I'm in the same boat. I mean, there's nothing like major that stands out. The only thing that came to my mind, which is not really something that anyone is doing, but it is the network effects of the EVM and the mind share that comes along with that. In most of our conversations where we know that them using Solana as the architecture for whatever they're trying to build is the right architecture for the thing that they're working on, it's so hard to get them away from the idea that they need to build on Ethereum or they need to build on Ethereum. L two, just because that is where the majority of people have built or, or have been building over time, and it's a gradual process of convincing them otherwise that like, hey, you know, you're not foregoing decentralization. You're not foregoing all of these other things that you might have been told, like, here, let us walk you through it. So the network effects around the EVM are definitely really real.
01:29:25.958 - 01:29:47.344, Speaker D: The thing that we obviously have on our side is that still feels like we're early in this very long term game, and it is very much a positive sum game. So I think that we are just looking for a portion of the overall pie. It's not like Ethereum is going anywhere, the EVM is going anywhere, but Solana is going to be a large portion of that pie.
01:29:47.384 - 01:29:50.404, Speaker A: Moving forward, there can be only one.
01:29:56.104 - 01:29:58.564, Speaker C: Half jokingly, but I felt that.
01:30:00.504 - 01:30:00.816, Speaker A: I.
01:30:00.840 - 01:31:10.012, Speaker C: Feel like these chains, there's always a multi chain world. Maybe when you think about the relevance of one chain, it does feel like duopoly ish or monopolistic technology has always been kind of hovering around certain standards and ossifying. So my thesis is, like, we're finally entering the stage where you have real applications and usage, and that's when I think you start to realize the have and the have nots from a technology standpoint, like, and it all, it ultimately shows up in the consumer activity. You know, anyone that bridges, are they going back? How many more trades are they doing on Jupiter? Can you have drip elsewhere? Probably not, because compression is, like, super unique. And ultimately, when I look at that, I think it's so far we've been in a state in crypto where even the top ten, there's stuff there that hasn't shipped. And crypto has been in a ten years of recapture the imagination of what if Nasdaq can come on chain, but we're coming closer to that state, whether it's in the next five to ten years. But I think you can reasonably underwrite based on real activity.
01:31:10.012 - 01:31:40.762, Speaker C: And I think that's going to be a major theme in this next cycle where you're like, yeah, this chain actually has million devs or million users or multiple million users, and there's others it just can't and break. And so I think that that's. I think that's different this time versus other cycles and historically in crypto. So for what it's worth, I guess we've covered a lot. Jano, anything else or. Totally. Ben, any parting thoughts? It's been great having you on and getting the refresh.
01:31:40.762 - 01:31:42.694, Speaker C: It's been a long year. I can imagine.
01:31:44.194 - 01:31:47.254, Speaker B: Anything we're missing, guys? Anything we didn't cover that you really want to hit on?
01:31:48.074 - 01:31:51.214, Speaker A: No, I think we got everything. Yeah.
01:31:52.714 - 01:31:57.654, Speaker D: It's always a pleasure coming on and talking with you guys. Maybe we can make it a regular annual thing.
01:31:58.314 - 01:31:59.374, Speaker C: That'd be great.
01:32:00.874 - 01:32:04.106, Speaker B: One day you'll get that invite on. Lightspeed, Ben. One day.
01:32:04.290 - 01:32:07.210, Speaker D: Perfect. That would be great. Come on, Mert. I'm looking at you.
01:32:07.282 - 01:32:17.714, Speaker B: Yeah, looking at Mert. Well, totally, Ben. Appreciate everything. Congrats on everything, guys. It's been. It's crazy to look back and say 13 months ago we were saying, wheel Solana, recover post FTX. That's very cool to see everything that's happened.
01:32:19.254 - 01:32:20.566, Speaker A: All right, awesome, guys.
01:32:20.590 - 01:32:21.238, Speaker C: Thanks for coming on.
