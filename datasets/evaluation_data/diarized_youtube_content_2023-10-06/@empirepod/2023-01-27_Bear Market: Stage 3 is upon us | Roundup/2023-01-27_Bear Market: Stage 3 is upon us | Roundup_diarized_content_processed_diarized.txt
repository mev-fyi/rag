00:00:03.920 - 00:00:16.446, Speaker A: All right, everyone. Happy Friday. Welcome back to another weekly roundup. You got Santi, you got me. I'm coming at you guys a little sick today, so if you hear some sniffles, I apologize in advance. Santi, how you doing?
00:00:16.630 - 00:00:24.314, Speaker B: I thought it was, I thought the sniffles were something related to, like, crypto existential, you know, disillusionment and really just bottoming out.
00:00:24.614 - 00:00:31.274, Speaker A: Do you think I was crying or did you think I was, like, doing a lot of drugs? Because both are kind of, like, disillusionment with crypto.
00:00:32.144 - 00:00:53.320, Speaker B: That's a great question. I think you're just like, you know, really disillusioned with the space. But then all of a sudden, the market rips and we're up, like, you know, two x on some things, and everyone seems to, you know, be, be really happy and all. So, no, I can't complain. I'm doing great, you know, you know, really excited for this roundup we skipped last week, but there's some really interesting developments and. Yeah, why don't we kick it off?
00:00:53.472 - 00:01:08.502, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Sorry we skipped last week, guys. We block works at our company offsite last week. Went to spooky Savannah, Georgia. Learned down there that it's the most haunted city in the whole world. So we did a ghost tour. Aside from that, it's pretty, I mean.
00:01:08.518 - 00:01:17.894, Speaker B: But Jason, it's pretty ironic. What could possibly scare you after the entire, like, last twelve months in crypto? I guess, like, you lose, you become numb. You know, it's funny.
00:01:17.934 - 00:01:30.390, Speaker A: You know, it's funny. We did it. We did a ghost tour. So we did a ghost tour of Savannah. And, you know, the guy's like, giving us a tour. It's like, kind of a history tour meets, like a ghost tour. And he's like, so what do you all do? I heard you're here for, like a conference or something.
00:01:30.390 - 00:01:45.758, Speaker A: We're like, no, it's our company offsite. It's like, oh, nice. What kind of company do you do? I always say, like, I was like, it's a financial media brand. Like, I usually don't get into crypto stuff. And he's like, oh, like, what kind of finance? And it's like, oh, it's a crypto company. And he's like, oh, crypto. He goes, I love nfts.
00:01:45.758 - 00:01:59.804, Speaker A: He goes, I'm staking my nfts. Have you heard of it? And he starts, you know, going off on, like, have you heard about this NFT collection, this defi platform? I hadn't heard of any of them, but I was like, oh, man. Mass adoption, baby, when you're a savannah tour guide is into nfts.
00:02:00.704 - 00:02:11.016, Speaker B: Okay, let me ask you a question. Do you still struggle? And when you go to a random get asked, what do you do? Do you avoid telling people that you're in crypto still?
00:02:11.200 - 00:02:27.176, Speaker A: I still. If I'm at, like, a. I think it actually probably depends. I mean, it definitely depends on the group, but if I'm at, you know, I was. I was back home. I was at a. My cousin's wedding back home in San Francisco and hanging out with an age group of, I'd say, like, 50 to 70.
00:02:27.176 - 00:02:52.480, Speaker A: And if people who I don't know in that group ask me what I do, say, I run a financial media brand in New York. Yeah, yeah. And if they say. If they dig further and they're like, oh, so, I mean, tell me about it, or, like, like, tell me a little more. I'm like. I like, you know, like, Wall Street Journal or Bloomberg, we've basically created something similar for crypto. That's my, like, one line spiel for folks who know nothing about crypto.
00:02:52.672 - 00:03:24.150, Speaker B: Yeah, I. The only time I, like, I don't feel ashamed, obviously, but I do sometimes look back and say it was kind of unnecessary because it becomes, like, the central topic of a conversation. In a ripping bull market, everyone's. You're the most popular guy in the party. All of a sudden, everyone surrounds, like, which entity should I buy? Where should I stake my tokens? Like, and obviously, you know, it's so. And then in a true, like, bear market, like, we're in now, everyone's like, oh, wow. Like, you know, are you doing okay? Like, do you want to drink? And I was like, no.
00:03:24.150 - 00:03:24.950, Speaker B: Like, I'm okay.
00:03:24.982 - 00:03:27.794, Speaker A: Like, do you want to drink?
00:03:28.094 - 00:03:45.604, Speaker B: Or, like, oh, wow. Like, yeah, it's a scam. And, like, they. They all of a sudden start, like, berating you of, like, what's the point of crypto? And you're like, I just came here to talk, and just, like, talk about non crypto. Like, my 99% of my time is spent on crypto Twitter. Like, can I just. You know.
00:03:45.604 - 00:03:47.704, Speaker B: But, yeah, no, it's interesting.
00:03:48.124 - 00:04:17.244, Speaker A: All right, so today we're talking about stage three of the bear market. Apathy had some tough conversations with companies I invested in this week, and just want to. I mean, I'll anonymize them, but want to share some of those stories and just, I think, share some of the way, share some of the feelings that I think folks are going through right now, because I think a lot of people are going to. Having a bit of a tough time right now. Want to talk about that. Maybe we can touch on Aptos. Aptos is, like, the only thing ripping right now.
00:04:17.244 - 00:04:39.030, Speaker A: Also want to talk on. Talk about CCTP circles, cross chain transfer portal, and then Doodles announcement moving over to flow. So I think maybe a good place to start. Oh, you know what? First thing is permissionless. I saw in our slack channel. I don't know if this has gone out on Twitter yet, but new speakers. I was looking through the new speakers because we have a marketing and an events channel.
00:04:39.030 - 00:04:50.770, Speaker A: We got Justin. Justin Drake. We've got Christine Moy, who leads crypto at Apollo. Got Vance and Michael from framework. Sure enough, I see Santi's face pop up. So, Santi, we're. We're excited to have you at permissionless.
00:04:50.770 - 00:04:51.210, Speaker A: Sir.
00:04:51.322 - 00:05:07.088, Speaker B: Yes, sir. I'm really excited to be invited back, given that last year, I was unable to make it. It was very much weather related. But, yeah, no, I'm very excited for that. And Austin's a great city, so. It's an Austin, right? Yeah, I'm really excited about that.
00:05:07.266 - 00:05:20.332, Speaker A: Get your tickets. If you guys are listening, on Friday, you just missed the ticket for the last. Again, every two weeks, we increase the price of the tickets. They were $312. Now they're $352. They're going to go up to $400. And then they go to 500.
00:05:20.332 - 00:05:34.728, Speaker A: And then they go to 600. I forget what the actual price increase. I think we increased the prices, like, five or 7.5 or 10% every two weeks. So get your tickets. All right, so, uh, let's. Let's talk about, uh, chow.
00:05:34.728 - 00:05:53.804, Speaker A: So, chat. Chow had this tweet, um, and he said, for crypto professionals, the second year of the bear market tends to be the most painful one. It's the year of apathy. There seems to be no light at the end of the tunnel. But simply being aware of this gives you a massive edge. Year three, things will get much better. This is the year you start to question your assumptions.
00:05:53.804 - 00:06:17.524, Speaker A: You ask yourself why you're in this space in the first place. Your coworkers are leaving. Your friends and the media don't care about you anymore. Your growth metrics seem stuck, no matter how hard you try. Power through. And so we have this offsite in Savannah, and at all of our off sites, Mike and I kick off the off site, and we have this, like, I don't know how long the presentation was. Probably, like, 90 minutes.
00:06:17.524 - 00:06:43.382, Speaker A: Presentation to kick off the off site. And one of the sections was about, where are we in the cycle? And, like, how are we feeling about things? It's kind of big state of the union, state of the nation presentation, and we kind of, we walked the company through these four phases of the bear market. Phase number one, and I'll lay out how we see it. I'm curious if you see it the same way. Phase one is the blow up. So this was November of last year. We topped out of November 2021.
00:06:43.382 - 00:07:09.074, Speaker A: We top out December, January. From November to mid January, we cranked down from, like, 68k bitcoin. Sixty eight k to, like, maybe bitcoin around 30k. So, like, that was the blow up. And the blow up is categorized by, like, euphoria rolls over, the leverage blows out, rapid price changes. And I think the main enemy that you're facing there is just fear is, like, this holy shit moment. So that's phase one.
00:07:09.074 - 00:07:36.044, Speaker A: Phase two is the fallout. And that's what we were facing this summer. That's when Luna blew up. Three arrows blew up. The feeling in the industry changes to disenchantment. And that's when I think that phase can be categorized by everyone's angry, everyone's looking for someone to blame. And this is when you saw people really getting riled up about Mashinsky and Kyle and Suzu and Doe.
00:07:36.044 - 00:08:10.290, Speaker A: You're looking for someone to blame, basically, and that's the fallout. Phase three is what we're going into right now, and I think we've entered it. I think we're officially in phase three of the bear market. And that's boredom and apathy. This is categorized by, like, unless you're really deep into the space, unless you're very crypto native, I would say there's. This is categorized by complete silence, lack of attention, peak floor, and, like, overall, not just prices, but inattention. And the enemy here, for people in the industry, is boredom.
00:08:10.290 - 00:08:28.380, Speaker A: The enemy is not disenchantment. It's not fear. It's boredom. And I think, I don't know how long this lasts, but that's phase three and then phase four, which what I'm looking for next is the rebirth. This is, like, sparks of hope. The price of bitcoin could go from, like, 15 to 30k. No one will even talk about it.
00:08:28.380 - 00:08:48.494, Speaker A: No one will mention a bear market rally. No one will even get excited about new projects. All sparks of hope get brushed off. And I think the enemy in phase four is disbelief. So that's the way that we presented it to the company. I'm curious to get your take on how you feel about that, and especially your take around this phase three, I think boredom that we're entering into right now.
00:08:49.194 - 00:09:44.136, Speaker B: I think it's well established cycles of market psychology, and I observed that that happens previously in other crypto cycles. I've seen three now very much kind of, they're all slightly different, but very much follow the same psychological pattern, I think. I do agree we're entering into this apathy phase, although there are some really exciting developments. And it's difficult because my perspective is, you have to wonder, your eco chamber in Twitter, there is a lot of excitement around certain developments. Shanghai liquid staking derivatives we talk a lot about narratives in this podcast. Crypto has very much expanded and now covers so many different verticals that at any given moment in time, like, there are very exciting, hot narratives. They could be, like shooting stars.
00:09:44.136 - 00:10:40.374, Speaker B: They might, like, burst and go into flames and then die off fairly quickly. And so categorically, like, in a broad stroke, I generally do think that we're in this phase of apathy. If you really zoom out and say, by and large, relative to where we were in the peak, yeah, certainly, like, a lot of people have left, a lot of people have questioned why this all matters. And the key there is, like, Xiao, I think crystallizes it fairly well, which is, personally, as someone involved in the industry, when you see a lot of this fallout in this pain and fraud, it's difficult. I think you fundamentally question, like, where, where are we going? Even though there are really exciting developments. But you're. Kane said this to me at the bottom of last bear market.
00:10:40.374 - 00:11:20.114, Speaker B: This was January of 2019. He said, you know, you're in a bear market. And I think he was hinting at the phase of the bear market that we're in now, which is apathy. When any development, any announcement positive. One of new products that we're launching, he says, he said at the time, the token just drops because people are reminded that they hold a bag and then they just sell whatever is left. Now, I'm not sure we're in that phase now because fair, like, to be fair, even though a lot of prices have gone down in a similar manner, or last cycle, we're down 90%, 95%. And sure enough, some of these assets have, like, gone up at two x since the bottom.
00:11:20.114 - 00:12:09.944, Speaker B: You know, I still think that it's going to take a while to get rid of the skepticism, disillusionment, and I'll be, you know, I think I'd be remiss not to say like, it has impacted me, even though the thing that gives me the most amount of comfort is talking to founders because I tend to think that investors are more impacted by this psychology, whereas builders just keep the heads down and, you know, are, are fairly more, like, detached from this psychological curve. But you mentioned that you talked to founders, so I'm really curious to understand how they're feeling, because when you, I think when you see founders categorically be more impacted by it, I think that's where you're close to the bottom.
00:12:10.064 - 00:12:34.370, Speaker A: Right. Well, first off, I'll share those stories in a second. But it's funny, like, talking to, you said talking to builders, like, gives you a little hope. You also mentioned, like, crypto Twitter and this, like, echo chamber that we're in. I was trying to think back to 2018 and 2019 when Mike and I were trying to get blockworks off the ground. I didn't know that we were in a cycle. I didn't know that we were in a bear market.
00:12:34.370 - 00:12:43.872, Speaker A: I was just like, oh, the prices are going down. So, like, you just keep building. You just like, that doesn't impact how you build. And I actually think that for you.
00:12:43.928 - 00:12:49.520, Speaker B: Right, you're going to report, I mean, I would almost say sometimes bear markets are even better for reporting.
00:12:49.552 - 00:13:28.122, Speaker A: It doesn't matter what we were building back then. I think it was like you just, especially for first time founders in crypto, I think it's really easy for you and me to, and for a lot of people who have been in the industry since 2017 or 2015 or 2013 to be like, oh, this is another cycle. We got to get through this cycle. There's a lot of people who, who came in in the 2020, really 2021, like NFT bull market and 2020 Defi bull market that, like, they're kind of just like, all right, Bob. And this is just what happens. You just kind of keep building. And actually, I think that crypto Twitter is your best friend in a bear market.
00:13:28.122 - 00:13:53.968, Speaker A: Funny enough, I know people say that, like, get off crypto Twitter. It's the bear market. Get to building. I think that crypto Twitter is your best friend in a bear market and your enemy in a, in a bull market. In a bull market, you have an extreme, at least I do, an extreme amount of fomo for everything going to every day during the bull market, go into crypto Twitter. I invested in this, but this other investment made more money. We're building this, but a competitor is building this and it seems like this is doing well.
00:13:53.968 - 00:14:17.914, Speaker A: Extreme amount of fomo in a bear market. I'm like, oh, my God, there's so much going on in the industry to be excited about. Super cool developments with meV. Really interesting stuff happening with bridges that, like, circle is doing. Very exciting developments in the, in the liquid staking, develop liquid staking derivatives space. Really cool. Like, like these NFT projects making interesting decisions.
00:14:17.914 - 00:14:27.674, Speaker A: And I just think, like, to me, there's a ton going on. If you didn't spend time on crypto Twitter, you're like, oh, crypto's dead. So I found crypto Twitter to be a place of hope right now.
00:14:28.574 - 00:15:08.336, Speaker B: Yeah. Although to be like, I definitely agree with you. I think the most important thing you said there is you've been through this before for. And there are a lot of, like, when you think about the adoption curve overlaid with this market psychology curve, the sheer number of people that have entered in this last cycle is, I think, a multiple of what entered in 2017. And so every subsequent cycle, I think you're going to expect just more people that are new to the space experiences. Pretty brutal volatility that is just inherent of early stage technology. The new paradigm here is obviously that you have a greater price discovery or attempted price discovery through 24, 7365 markets.
00:15:08.336 - 00:15:39.504, Speaker B: Whereas you didn't have that in the Internet because the Internet, you had the boom and bust, like, of 99. But it was fairly, I guess there was a lot of retail investors that got hit by that because companies were going public much faster. But in crypto, companies go public, I guess, like they want. Right? And so it involves much more people. Like, to think about this. Ethereum is a piece of technology. It's created the most amount of millionaires and billionaires, I think, by far, like, and so it's just this virtue that people can invest in that in a lot of these projects, and they go through that pain.
00:15:39.504 - 00:16:16.152, Speaker B: And, you know, when you think about, like, something like FTX, there's a million people that were affected, and a lot of them has been their only experience with crypto and so, or Terra, you know, and I think that's what is quite different. We've talked about this before. I think the bar is much higher for those people that perhaps have left the space in order for them to come back. This idea of, like, how adoption curves happen is like this viral coefficient. So you learn about crypto. Then you tell five people, those five people tell other five people or three people. And so it's just factorial rights, like, exponential.
00:16:16.152 - 00:17:05.014, Speaker B: It goes both ways, right? It can be very positive and very negative, right? Like positive and negative, like, and so, you know, I think still the what's still fairly been, although we're in apathy phase. I'm very surprised though that there are NFT projects, new mints that are getting a lot of attention. And the NFt pocket of crypto is sort of, I don't want to say totally insulated, but behaving, you know, somewhat like unrelated, kind of just doing its own thing. And, and so new people are coming to the space they might not be interested in, you know, l two s and d five or whatever. But there's still a fair amount of activity in the NFT land that wasn't the case. Yeah, last cycle.
00:17:05.434 - 00:17:08.426, Speaker A: All right, so I got, I've got the, I've got a couple stories from these founders.
00:17:08.450 - 00:17:08.826, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:17:08.930 - 00:17:37.404, Speaker A: Three calls with founders this week. I'm going to anonymize all them. Just a ridiculous amount of respect for these guys. One of them trying to figure out how much to share, basically one of them is pivoting. I'll just go really high level here. One of them is completely pivoting the company and is really excited about the pivot, but is completely pivoting the company. And I think that's symbolic of things that happen to bear market is these full blown pivots.
00:17:37.404 - 00:18:15.750, Speaker A: Because in a bull market, everything's working. In a bear market you're like, if I don't pivot, I could be done completely pivoting. Trying to raise another round seems to be going well. So that's one company, the other one, and they're feeling super excited. The other one is incredibly dejected because they are, in their minds operating better than they've ever operated. But every single number that they track, volume, users, everything is tanking. And I think that's super symbolic of a bear market where like you can be, you can be running 100 mph, you can be running through a brick wall and the numbers just don't really move.
00:18:15.750 - 00:18:57.856, Speaker A: And one thing that we told blockworks at the offset is in a bull market, one unit of output will get seen. As you input one unit and you get one output the next day, for example, you do something productive and you'll see the output the next day or the next week. In a bear market, oftentimes you do something productive and you don't see the output for like twelve to 18 months. And that can be really discouraging. So I think the second founder is feeling really dejected and I, and I really understand that and empathize with that. And the third, the third one unfortunately had a big founder dispute. They're at this point in the business where, like, they had this founder dispute.
00:18:57.856 - 00:19:21.148, Speaker A: One wants to go one way, the other wants to go another way. They couldn't come to an agreement and they've decided to shut down. So, and that's just a real. Yeah, and these, like, I just really feel for them and I just think these are things that happen in, in bear markets and it's tough. And I just, like, I think a lot of folks are going through this, but, like, you don't see that on, on Twitter. You don't see people sharing those stories.
00:19:21.196 - 00:19:58.592, Speaker B: So it's very interesting. I've had actually three calls, too, in the last week and a half and very similar pattern. One of them, the two co founders, one of them wants to exit crypto, doesn't believe in it anymore, and the other one does. But they have these disputes around ownership, of course, and they're going through that. The other one company is questioning, like, they hasn't found product market fit and have limited resources and are saying, look, we have x amount of Runway. It's decent, it's over a year, but we just want to pivot and do something else. And the other one is actually doing fairly well.
00:19:58.592 - 00:20:58.626, Speaker B: And they want to double down and raise more capital, and it's largely going to be existing investors that are going to give that. And so I was talking to a few other folks that invest, and I think what is one we always talk about, like, product? Well, I think in bear market, in bull markets, product market fit is, can be disguised and you can punt that to some extent. You have more margin, whereas, you know, a bear market is more brutal. Right. It will tell you, to your point, if things are not working and you're just, you're just throwing stuff that you think is really cool and innovative, but no one's there, no one cares. And it's really difficult to iterate and understand if you're navigating and string the right course. And this goes back to the theory of, if I look back to some of the more successful defi projects that kind of grinded through this, I'm thinking about Aave compound synthetix maker.
00:20:58.626 - 00:21:25.164, Speaker B: Synthetix, for example, started as a stablecoin project called Haven. It was actually the largest ICo raise and the fastest. And it sort of ticked up the absolute top of the ico craziness. And then they went through this kind of transition where they said stablecoins are not going to work. Bases shut down. They had to pivot. And they said, a synthetic stable coin, well, you can express that and pivot it to a generalized synthetic platform.
00:21:25.164 - 00:21:49.778, Speaker B: And seeing that pivot, even though they were fairly well capitalized, was difficult. And they were building what is still a fairly complicated, difficult thing to understand. What saved them, I think, and did very well, was surround themselves with a very small but vocal and engaged community in their discord. Like the synthetic discord channel to this day is just very, what are they called?
00:21:49.826 - 00:21:51.202, Speaker A: The Spartans or something?
00:21:51.378 - 00:22:21.018, Speaker B: The Spartans, yeah. And so I think that was, it goes to this theory of you'd rather have like ten or 100 diehard fans than a million, you know, kind of not so engaged, you know, users, if you will, because those are the guys that are going to give you really good product feedback. And I think for any founder listening here, I think, you know, if you have a discord, identify those people that are really active in the community because they're going to be the ones that are going to help you navigate when nothing you seems to be working.
00:22:21.146 - 00:22:21.854, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:22:23.274 - 00:22:36.304, Speaker B: And then when that spark phase of the market, we're entering into that spark phase, you know, that's where I think you'll be rewarded. But it could take, who knows? Right timing is really difficult.
00:22:37.444 - 00:23:18.032, Speaker A: So let me share a trend that I see, that I saw companies do, that I see companies doing right now saw companies doing 2018 and 2019, including blockworks. I'll share a really embarrassing story that blockworks did and then that I saw even happen in the past or that I heard happened in the past. Bear market, I wasn't in the space, but I heard happened. So in a lot of the talks with founders, I think a lot of the disputes are, for example, in this, theres this one company Im invested in. One founder wants to go one way, another founder wants to go the other way. One of the founder wants to, what id say, chase short term cash, really scared about cash flow. The other one wants to build what it will be a very successful thing and im sure of it.
00:23:18.032 - 00:24:01.994, Speaker A: Its just going to take another twelve months and the immediate cash flow is not really there. I think there's a tendency to get really scared about cash flow and in one, in a bear market and on one hand, you should, you should be scared of cash flow. And there's this great book, Andy Grove, like only the paranoid survive and you should like optimize, you should cut your burn and you should get to cash flow positive if even possible. Some of these companies are too early to do that. But I actually think optimizing for cash flow can hurt companies and can be a really, can be a fault if you try to do it too early. And I have two stories to share here. One is actually Coinbase.
00:24:01.994 - 00:24:31.162, Speaker A: For people who are at Coinbase in 2015, you should fact check this story, but would love to hear from you guys. But the story that I've heard about Coinbase is, do you remember the enterprise blockchain? You remember enterprise blockchain? And it started to get kind of pushed in 2016. By 2017, it was all the rage. The commercials on tv is like, walmart's moving their supply chain onto the blockchain. Thanks to IBM's blockchain platform, you can now track Hyperledger. Hyperledger. Remember, like mangoes? It used to take like 48 days to track a mango.
00:24:31.162 - 00:24:32.426, Speaker A: And now you can track. Yeah, yeah.
00:24:32.450 - 00:24:40.458, Speaker B: It's like, we're gonna track trace, we're gonna. We're gonna reinvent supply chains and, you know, like, pharmaceuticals and providence, and all this gonna get solved. Yeah.
00:24:40.506 - 00:24:50.400, Speaker A: Yeah. This here, Walmart and blockchain. First off, they spelled blockchain. Wait, let me. Let me read you. This is amazing. November 2017.
00:24:50.400 - 00:25:01.936, Speaker A: Walmart and blockchain. First off, blockchain is two words. Block space chain. It takes two to mango. This was Walmart's. This is Walmart's push is that they were going to. Oh, man, this is amazing to read.
00:25:01.936 - 00:25:14.246, Speaker A: Basically, it took a long time to track a mango. The supply chain of a mango and a blockchain would solve that. Anyways. Didn't. Enterprise blockchain didn't make sense at all. Coinbase, though. Coinbase launched, um, I forget when.
00:25:14.246 - 00:25:28.470, Speaker A: Like 2013 or something, and didn't have much success. And then, like, all. All of a sudden, it went really parabolic as they helped people buy crypto and. And hold their crypto. Then the bear market hit and everything fell apart. Like, their user numbers tanked. User numbers tanked, like 98%.
00:25:28.470 - 00:26:03.586, Speaker A: Revenue also tanked, like 95% to 98%. The board of Coinbase was really pushing Brian Armstrong to get into enterprise blockchain and to go sell software for enterprise block for, like, banks, to help banks get into and adopt enterprise blockchain. And Brian and, you know, their. Their argument was probably what a lot of VC's are doing today, which is like, hey, cash flow, we need to make money. You're thinking about this esoteric thing in the future, crypto markets. We're thinking about the money today. And Brian, to his credit, at least from what I've heard, was like, we're not doing enterprise blockchain.
00:26:03.586 - 00:26:11.396, Speaker A: I'm just. We're not doing that. And other folks did go do that and they chased that. And it didn't work. Um, and it's. I just love that story because it. So that was.
00:26:11.396 - 00:26:39.628, Speaker A: That was the 2015 bear market for blockworks. I was reminded the other day, I went to, uh, I messaged, I pulled up my DM's with Kyle Simone, and the last dm I had with him on Twitter was from mid 2019. I said, hey, man, good said. So we hosted that. Blockworks hosted the Multicoin summit in 2019. I said, hey, Kyle, good meeting at the Multicoin summit. A bunch of our clients have been asking for influencer campaigns, and your name was brought up.
00:26:39.628 - 00:27:15.092, Speaker A: Would you ever be open to paid influencer deals with companies like Blockfi and Gemini? To Kyle's credit, he said, no. I said, cool, good talk. Right? But it reminded me, blockworks, in the heart of the bear market in 2019, we needed money so badly, and we're this bootstrap company. We started spinning up influencer marketing deals for brands as basically just an agent, an influencer agency. Now, the good is that that helped us survive. The bad is that, like, we quickly realized that's not a good business and, like, not a business we wanted to be in.
00:27:15.148 - 00:27:35.390, Speaker B: But, you know, there's some things that. It's Elad Gill, who's a very well known investor. Yeah, angel investor has a great book. I think it's a growth manifesto or something. And he talks about certain anecdotes, some. Yes. The growth handbook.
00:27:35.390 - 00:27:36.118, Speaker B: Great book.
00:27:36.166 - 00:27:38.470, Speaker A: High growth handbook. It's really good. Yeah.
00:27:38.622 - 00:28:10.654, Speaker B: Very practical. Good resource. One of the more interesting things is sometimes you do things that don't scale to survive. Airbnb sold cereal boxes during the presidential campaigns to like. And that hustle of both the founders impressed Paul. I think it was at y combinator that then they got in last minute, that grit. And this is a point that I want to bring up because I just read a book by Ann Drucker and Annie Duke.
00:28:10.654 - 00:28:49.106, Speaker B: She first wrote a great book called Grid. Yes. Thinking in bets. And then she just wrote a new book called Quit, which talks about fairly interesting concept, which is most of the time we're really bad at quitting because there's collective idea that you need to persevere and, you know, you grind through it, and the harder you work, the luckier you get. And I think it's sometimes a thing that we don't talk about enough. In this conversation with these founders, I've had had to, like, ask myself, well, maybe the best choice here is to return capital versus to go through another cycle with your founder. Or if you haven't found product market fit.
00:28:49.106 - 00:29:27.824, Speaker B: If you're not. If there's no, like, viable product, just return capital. And I think it's something that doesn't get talked about enough, but sometimes it's the right thing to do. And I've seen now two companies return capital, one that was building in the terror ecosystem that had to shut down and was, like, going through this motion and kind of had an existential crisis and was like, look, you're great founders. I think a great founder will probably probabilistically get his existing investor base to invest in. The next thing he does, they return capital, and they show that maturity. And, you know, it's a very difficult thing to do.
00:29:27.824 - 00:30:08.784, Speaker B: But the general concept of this book is, most of the time, when you look back, when you think you've quit at the right time, it's too late. And so it's just an interesting concept, because in crypto, we talk about Hodl culture grinding it through, believing in long term vision. But sometimes the idea might not work. It's too early, and it's okay to just survive and take time to observe. And, you know, it was just a really interesting perspective because I don't know what you think about that. And if you felt that at times in the early days of blockburgs, like, did you ever have this existential crisis? Did you ever think about quitting? Did you ever have this kind of discussion with Mike?
00:30:11.404 - 00:30:17.260, Speaker A: Not really. We couldn't. We couldn't. We. Our whole rep. Our whole. It was all.
00:30:17.260 - 00:30:47.786, Speaker A: It was. I mean, no, not really, honestly. Like, what? No, we didn't. I mean, I remember, like, we. I remember one day when we had beers in 2019, and, like, I remember specifically the conversation of, like, what would you go do if we weren't doing block works? Or, like, maybe it was, like, what industry would you work in if you weren't? I think those were two questions that we asked. What would you do if you weren't doing block works? And what industry would you work in if it wasn't crypto today? I would never. There's nothing else I would do.
00:30:47.786 - 00:31:06.082, Speaker A: I don't know. I'd work in crypto still, and, like, I would. I don't know. I couldn't see another option outside of blockworks. But, like, that was definitely maybe in the back of our mind, but, no, I don't think we ever thought about crypto, probably because our whole reputation relied on blockworks. We were like. We were the first ones of anyone we knew to go do crypto full time.
00:31:06.082 - 00:31:32.674, Speaker A: And, like, the amount of shit that we got. I mean, it was like, you're gonna go do what, host cryptocurrency events for that blockchain thing? You're gonna do it full time. You're gonna quit your good jobs that you got? Like, okay. I mean, I think everyone was basically waiting for us to, like, come back to the real world and, like, come back to our real jobs, you know? So. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:31:32.794 - 00:31:55.208, Speaker B: I don't have a good answer. I do practice quitting when I run. Like, there's sometimes the races, right. Just, you know, it's not your day. That's it. It's easier to practice it then and there. I think as an investor, where I like, whenever I make an investment, I like to think about scenarios where I would quit, where I would exit, and have a framework in mind.
00:31:55.208 - 00:33:06.554, Speaker B: Thinking in probability, saying, if I do a five x, then. Then I take chips off the table, like, systematically. And thinking about that probability, thinking, like, embayes in theory, I think was really helpful to then say, like, what is the probability if something has gone up x, for it to go up another x? Or am I better off allocating my capital elsewhere? And I think it's ultimately, it's really difficult to give, like, these broad based, like, generalized advice, because my, what I like to think is everyone has a very unique perspective, journey and position. And so when you look at crypto twitter, when you look at people, like, giving this advice, it's like, well, it really depends on your time horizon, your equity position. The most important thing that I think, and you mentioned it, is, you know, just position yourself to be patient and to have the opportunity to take more time. Because the biggest mistakes I've done are feeling rushed into a decision, either because I'm under some sort of stress. Like that is you didn't have cash flow in the last cycle, and you had to sell some tokens at the very bottom or near the bottom, had so many people see that, like, go through that phase.
00:33:06.554 - 00:33:48.046, Speaker B: And so, you know, I think those were my biggest learnings from the past cycles. It's kind of. It's kind of a fool's errand to start thinking about, like, have we. Is this a bear trap or, you know, have we really bought em? I think the other thing that it's. I do definitely agree with what you just said, is I think the more time you spend in this space, it's fairly difficult to say that this is going to die. And it's almost like you open a door, you see the future. It's hard to imagine the next crypto not being a fundamental piece of fabric of how we do things in the next maybe ten years.
00:33:48.046 - 00:34:08.534, Speaker B: Now, how we get there is the most difficult thing. And so you just assume the journey is going to be very difficult, and you then do everything in your power to have enough resources, fuel, water, granola, whatever it is in this pike, to be able to grind it through, because, you know, it's still going to be very.
00:34:08.614 - 00:34:10.910, Speaker A: Is this still a running analogy? You lost me.
00:34:10.982 - 00:34:20.344, Speaker B: I'm trying to like sports. Sports analogies are the best because I think it's. Or you're hiking. Like, I just. I just got. It's very relatable. So, anyways, yeah, that's.
00:34:20.344 - 00:34:21.280, Speaker B: That's all I'll say.
00:34:21.392 - 00:34:45.838, Speaker A: I also have the feeling of quitting when I run, but the difference is I usually have that feeling at, like, a quarter of a mile. I think you can. You can usually go. Go longer than I do there. So, yeah, I actually think one. I mean, one thing that. I think one thing that I think influences your decision on to quit or not to quit was how much time you put into the decision of what to do, to do it or not to do it.
00:34:45.838 - 00:35:04.734, Speaker A: Like, I have a friend, he's always starting new things. Every four months, he's starting a new thing. Every quarter, he's got a new thing. He's got a new, like, d to see. One quarter, it's a d, two c pop up website selling, like, you know, this little massage tool. The next quarter, it's like, he's, like, he hacked the system for how to create, like, a best selling book. The next.
00:35:04.734 - 00:35:45.158, Speaker A: The next quarter, it's like a newsletter, and. And then he quits them. And the reason I think that that's okay to quit those things is because those ideas were created on, like, a spark of excitement. There wasn't much thought that went into them. I've seen other companies in crypto do it, too. I think one exercise to do is, like, a really good exercise to do is that I don't think many first time founders do is like, what's the end state of this look like? Because one thing that you'll notice if you look at a lot of crypto companies from this last cycle is like, they all. A lot of them kind of converge to be the same thing.
00:35:45.158 - 00:36:26.326, Speaker A: So back in 2017 and 2018, a lot of infrastructure companies were raising money to be, like, you know, to help with crypto as crypto became institutionalized and, like, the infrastructure needed for that, so you had custodians being created you had lend and borrow platforms being created, like BlockFi and Celsius and Nexo. And those folks, you had the custodians being created, like Anchorage and Bitgo and fire blocks. You had the trading platforms being created. Eventually, after, like, three or four or five years, they all converged to be the same thing. Those are all, they're all creating one version of either a prime broker or a crypto bank. And in media, it's the same thing. Some people start with newsletters, some start with conferences.
00:36:26.326 - 00:36:56.530, Speaker A: Some people start with news. Some start with data, some start with research. I can assure you, everyone will end up competing on the same thing, which is like, full stack media and information platforms that combine news with, like, opinion stuff like newsletters and podcasts, with data, with research. All ends in the same space. So I think one thing to think about before you jump into it is like, what's your end state here? Okay, you're going to nail ETH custody. Like, cool. You're gonna do that better than anyone else.
00:36:56.530 - 00:37:02.282, Speaker A: All right, what happens next? You're gonna have to introduce a way to make money, because custody. Custody is not a money making. Yeah.
00:37:02.338 - 00:37:31.608, Speaker B: So, yeah, on this, on this point, I've been thinking a lot about. I think a big theme this year is gonna be some regulatory clarity. I may be wrong, but I think it's closer than ever and push back. Yeah, well, well, let's just assume we're gonna get it in the next 1224 months. I think it has been difficult as a project. I'm not talking about a crypto service provider. I'm talking about a native crypto native project has a token.
00:37:31.608 - 00:38:31.260, Speaker B: Thinking about token design has been fairly constrained in the sense that we've been thinking about governance. Tokens and monetization has been something that has been on the backseat because of the securities laws, and you don't want to confer, like, a promise of profit and relying on the effort of others and the how we test, basically. And, you know, I think, like, I have an open question here. I'd like to have another regulatory podcast where we talk about, okay, imagine a world where if these things are deemed securities, some, is that a would be existential for, like, a lot of these projects and meaning, would it create a very burdensome. Would it create, like, would it make it impossible for them overly expensive to, like, comply? And I do think of a scenario where it's really not. I mean, a lot of this data is on chain. A lot of the smart contracts are deployed.
00:38:31.260 - 00:39:04.674, Speaker B: Everything is readable for everyone. You think about Edgar sec. The thing that, of course, needs to be emphasized is these disclosures that happen on Discord channels. But maybe you just post and there's an API that reads and stuff, stuff on a website that is like, you know, the Edgar sec of crypto or, you know, the FCA's version. I don't know, but I think, like, you know, a lawyer will give you his perspective. And I've heard this numerous times, which is like, it would be impossible for a token issuer to, like, operate. It's so expensive.
00:39:04.674 - 00:39:53.092, Speaker B: Think about, like, companies going public. It's a very expensive thing. Cost millions of dollars. But is it really, and is it really that bad if something gets deemed a security? It's just an open question. Because I think if, if it is, and I don't have an opinion here, I'm just saying, if it is, then we will go back to the drawing board and say, all right, well, let's actually design the uni token to be the most profitable exchange that the world has ever seen. And one of the more, like, I've always felt that crypto companies are highly efficient, like, labs, crypto, like, companies that develop a piece of protocol and deploy it and then have some sort of, like, are able to monetize that you're talking about, like comparing Coinbase. We've all seen these comparisons.
00:39:53.092 - 00:40:21.322, Speaker B: We can link them up. I did it once, which is compare a game studio like Axie to a normal game developer like Sony and Activision Blizzard. Compare Uniswap to Coinbase, a normal centralized exchange. These pieces of technology and protocols, once deployed, are self maintaining and on the margin. Like, they just. The unit economics of that, I think are the best of anything I've ever seen. And I was a soft, like, I was investing in enterprise software before really going full time in crypto.
00:40:21.322 - 00:40:57.122, Speaker B: And all you look at is unit economics. And so the issue now is, well, what is the relationship between Uniswap Labs and the Uni token? And the uni token, like, Deejon Spartan keeps saying, well, these are all worthless governance tokens. And in large part, you know, he's right. Like, what is actually the value? Okay, well, then we figure out, like, curve wars, and you have. There's value in voting power because that influences certain things. And. But I just, a part of me says, let's just call these things, like, let's just get some clarity because that's the biggest problem, I think, at this point.
00:40:57.122 - 00:41:08.094, Speaker B: Whereas you're in this, like, weird limbo where it's a governance token, but it's a highly profitable protocol. What's going on? You know what I mean? So, yeah.
00:41:09.194 - 00:41:38.314, Speaker A: All right, so maybe going up, maybe, maybe going off that santi, like, regulation leads to, like, better business models a little more like sound fundamentals. In kryptos. In kryptos, good transition into apdos, which is up 400% in 30 days. I'm assuming you were a seed investor or early. What's going on here? Why are we pumping? Is this just like a nice little crypto, Twitter bear market pump?
00:41:39.494 - 00:41:55.274, Speaker B: I honestly have no idea. I think, I mean, it's on a relative basis, up more than something like Solana, which is up a little bit more than two x it bottom to nine. But I actually don't have any idea.
00:41:56.144 - 00:42:01.764, Speaker A: Hmm. What, uh, what price range did seed investors get after set?
00:42:03.184 - 00:42:07.352, Speaker B: Uh, I'm not sure that's public information, so I'll defer to comment.
00:42:07.408 - 00:42:18.544, Speaker A: Like, all right, let me, let me maybe, let me rephrase it then. How do you think about, are you can, are you able to sell Aptos tokens right now?
00:42:18.704 - 00:42:20.804, Speaker B: No, no, they're locked.
00:42:21.940 - 00:42:22.004, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:42:22.004 - 00:43:17.870, Speaker B: I mean, is it up worth 13.6 billion or something like. It's an interesting question. I think a lot of the, a lot of the, what I've observed is competing l one's trade on a very relative basis. And, you know, if Ethereum is worth, what is it, 174, 200 billion or so? Yeah, 200 billion with some, like some inflation, then what should a competing platform trade at? And then you look at, okay, what is, you know, some of the other l one s trade at Cosmos, avalanche, Solana. And so I think it's, it goes back to this question of how do we price crypto assets and what is the monetization model for these crypto assets. And, you know, I think it's fairly, it's going to take a lot of time for the, for the market to converge.
00:43:17.870 - 00:44:14.764, Speaker B: I don't think the market is sophisticated enough to look at this on a fundamental basis. It's really just relative valuation that we're looking at here. You do have some, like, arguably things to go off of the value network like Ethereum, that has pretty sound like some interesting properties from a cash flow perspective with the IP 1559 and some other components of staking and, you know, float and some, there's like a number of ways that you can kind of try to compare this, like, to, like, a normal Internet like company. The former analyst James, who was at Ark, did a great, has a great analysis, and he sort of compares, like, Google to Ethereum so we can link that. And yeah, the other thing I say is people should go look at the electric capital developer report. This came out last week. I think it's one of them more qualitative and quantitative because they've been doing it for a few years of tracking developer activity in some of these networks.
00:44:14.764 - 00:44:51.054, Speaker B: Now I'm not suggesting that people look at that and then it has an immediate market reaction or impact in the market, but I think it tends to be one of the higher signals that I look at to then indicate, okay, there's a lot of developers that are migrating to Aptos, for instance, from Solana to Aptos as an example. Maybe, maybe not. But I think that's some of the other really interesting kind of data points you can look at to kind of triangulate to some relative sense or fundamental sense of evaluation for these things.
00:44:52.074 - 00:45:16.664, Speaker A: Sandy, let me ask you this, because when I think about you and your l one thesis, I think of you as a very ETH all in on Ethan. And like, when I bring up other things like maybe Cosmos or Solana, I would say you're quite interested and like open to exploring them. But like your thesis is built is like an EVM ETH heavy thesis. Why then invest in like an apdos? What's your thesis around something like that?
00:45:17.044 - 00:45:57.280, Speaker B: Well, I'd push back and say I've been on the record for a long time saying that I believe in a multi chain thesis in a multi chain world. And while certainly like a lot of my portfolio is based in Ethereum, I have invested in other chains and projects mainly that have been building in other chains. Like I built. I've invested in defi ecosystem in Solana, in Cosmos, in near, haven't invested in avalanche. I looked at it seed round. I've been to the conference, but I have invested in projects there. Some projects ended up going and building an avalanche.
00:45:57.280 - 00:46:24.144, Speaker B: So I have some exposure to some extent invested in optos. I think for me there's two ways I look at it. One, it could be it's a hedge. There is a version of this world where Ethereum is supplanted. And I, as an investor, you cannot miss that. If that happens, you cannot miss that event. If you miss that event, you're kind of dead in the water, in my opinion, and so you can't miss that.
00:46:24.144 - 00:47:23.736, Speaker B: And the second component is, I think we're very early still, and the number of use cases that are going to develop in this, in crypto, be supported by, you know, trustless execution environments, is going to be like, we're just, we're just seeing, like, as you said, this concept of Chris, which is great, is skeuomorphic concepts, which is things that exist. And we have certain things in web two land that we're porting over to web3. But there's so many use cases are going to pop up. I tend to think that security and we have the Eigen layer guys on which I think is interesting podcast. This idea that every different application, if you believe one, that there are going to be many different use cases for crypto, other than sound monetary, like something like bitcoin, then this Internet of value supports nfts. Today, defi gaming. There will be many other type of business models that will emerge in a similar manner that the smartphone, like, no one really imagined the smartphone for you to invest in the Internet.
00:47:23.736 - 00:47:58.188, Speaker B: In 2002, where people were being critical of the Internet, there's a great interview with Bill Gates that he was being asked in one of those morning talk shows. He's like, what are you building? Like, this Internet stuff? We're coming off of the.com crash. Like, just go home, pivot, do something else. And, you know, I think for you to invest in the Internet, then, like, it was very difficult to. Then you have to foresee the full extent of the Internet. You have to foresee some, like smartphones being developed and then software as a service, and then everything that came after smartphones, cellular towers and like LTE and then TikTok and all these other different applications.
00:47:58.188 - 00:48:28.992, Speaker B: And how. How much of that has impacted your daily life is remarkable. I think something similar will happen in crypto. This is why we're here, and that's the reason why I'm here. And I fundamentally believe that it will not be one chain to support all of those use cases, even though there will be certain standards. But you can compare how the Internet developed one to one to how crypto will develop. I think there might be shared security.
00:48:28.992 - 00:49:06.324, Speaker B: There might be different chains for different applications that require different security parameters. And I think it is solely based on the premise that there will be many, many different use cases for this technology that I am not seeing today, because my imagination doesn't stretch that far. I recognize that. But then I'm vertin that that leads me to invest in other chains, because I do believe that a lot of these chains will talk, and there'll be different galaxies, clusters that will support a lot of these different environments. Kind of like a federation, if you will. Like, I don't want it to talk about Star wars, but I love Star wars. So I'll use that federation analogy.
00:49:07.584 - 00:49:11.044, Speaker A: Have fun sitting on the right side of the bell curve, my friend. Must be nice over there.
00:49:14.544 - 00:49:19.416, Speaker B: Yeah. Anyways, I was gonna.
00:49:19.440 - 00:49:39.354, Speaker A: I was gonna pivot us into the news because I realized we're 50 minutes and we're supposed to talk about the news here, but here's my transition is that I just got a text, um, about a new business models. Uh, Buzzfeed just announced that they're going to use chat GBT to create content instead of using writers, and their stock is up 100% today.
00:49:40.454 - 00:49:42.514, Speaker B: Yeah. AI is new crypto man.
00:49:43.494 - 00:49:57.748, Speaker A: Yeah. Um, all right, so I. I think we can keep this relatively short. I just want to talk about two things. One is circles CCTP, and the other is doodles. Building on flow. Maybe we'll say floated until the end.
00:49:57.916 - 00:50:03.468, Speaker B: And then I want to talk about one thing at the end, one news piece of item. So why don't you cover those two, and then I'll cover one more.
00:50:03.636 - 00:50:22.624, Speaker A: All right. Basically. I mean, I think so circle launched their cross chain transfer portal. Everyone's sleeping on this. I think it's one of the biggest announcements, I was going to say of the year, but we're only 27 days into the year. One of the biggest announcements in a while, like, massive, massive, massive props to circle. They're doing two really interesting things right now.
00:50:22.624 - 00:51:02.072, Speaker A: It's their own chain. One is their own chain that's semi related to this, and then the other is the cross chain transfer portal. So just like, major props to circle for everything. They're building the TLDR on this CCTP is. They're calling it an on chain utility. Really, you can think of it like a bridge that basically burns USDC on the source chain and then mints native USDC on the destination chain. So the reason I think it's so cool is because bridging has been, like, just this colossal, not failure, but, like, honey pot for hacks.
00:51:02.072 - 00:51:58.724, Speaker A: There are over $2 billion of bridge hacks in 2022. And I think bridges have, like, a been this honeypot for hacks, but they've really fractured liquidity. Like, you've got, like, wormhole USDC, and then, like, Axelar USDC is really confusing from a user experience point of view. So I think it's a pretty smart branding play by them not calling it a bridge, calling it a utility for the space. I think that's pretty intentional, and I think it'll unlock a lot of liquidity across the industry, and I think it's really good for Defi the devil's advocate to what I'm saying is that the way I understood it is that circle here serves as the ultimate source of truth. They kind of serve as the minter, the burner, and the price oracle for USDC. Putting my crypto native want to build a permissionless future world that doesn't seem great to me.
00:51:58.724 - 00:52:05.764, Speaker A: So little torn on this, but I do think it's a good innovation. Curious what you think of it.
00:52:06.264 - 00:52:49.012, Speaker B: I don't have a strong opinion here other than the last point you said is very true, but I'll take the practical approach. USDC, I think it's a good product. I'm not endorsing it, I use it even though I know it's centralized. But yeah, I mean, they've proven to be very capable, competent long term, like we've had Jeremy on. I think he's a serious builder and as a serious organization behind it, so of course he has risks. But, you know, fairly interesting development and it's actually interesting that they've developed and gone in this direction, given everything that's happened in Bridgeland over the last year. And it's maybe one of those things where it's a spark, but a lot will be met with a lot of skepticism.
00:52:49.012 - 00:53:11.018, Speaker B: Be surprised if a lot of people are highly critical of it because it's a, centralized and b, it's a bridge and has whole like wormhole and ronin and all these things. But I think that it's worth a critical look and obviously testing but whatnot. But I think they'll do the right thing in terms of auditing and having maybe a good set of validators, if you will, to make this increasingly decentralized and not fully centralized.
00:53:11.146 - 00:53:38.234, Speaker A: Yeah, it's interesting to think about what will happen for other bridges. Other bridges could, I think, leverage CCTP to do native cross chain swaps. CCTP works for USCC because circle happens to be both the asset issuer and the bridge operator. But it'll be. Yeah, I'm curious to see what happens for other bridges. Like, I think. I think bridge volumes across the board will probably get hurt by this.
00:53:38.234 - 00:53:51.550, Speaker A: Like no one's going to realistically use a bridge when you can just burn USDC on chain, a mint USDC on channel. Unless you're like a true decentralization maxi or if circle is forced to kyc it, that changes things.
00:53:51.622 - 00:53:59.094, Speaker B: Yeah. Assuming a lot of the bridge activity is for stable coins, but the non stable coin piece is still going to exist and support multiple other bridges, I believe.
00:53:59.914 - 00:54:40.216, Speaker A: Yeah. There's also something else that circle is developing, which is. What's it called? Noble Circle's developing. So there's a chain that's like a general asset issuance chain called Noble, and it leverages the Cosmos hub for security through ics. And Circle, the way I understand, is circle is the first company that's going to use Noble to mint USDC into Cosmos. And I think this is really important for cosmos because now you get native USDC inside the cosmos ecosystem. So two good developments coming from circle.
00:54:40.216 - 00:54:42.244, Speaker A: Yep. Long circle equity.
00:54:43.664 - 00:54:46.604, Speaker B: I had a chance to buy that really cheap last cycle. Did it?
00:54:48.944 - 00:54:50.248, Speaker A: You did or you didn't?
00:54:50.296 - 00:54:53.896, Speaker B: Did not. Again, done a lot of mistakes in my investment.
00:54:53.960 - 00:54:56.638, Speaker A: Feel so bad for you, Santi. Yes, feel so bad for you.
00:54:56.686 - 00:54:59.354, Speaker B: Hey, man, we'll live to see another day.
00:55:01.094 - 00:55:17.814, Speaker A: Okay, so that. So that's that. We might bring the circle team on. We're talking to them about potentially coming on. I really want to do an episode with both Circle and then Antonio. Antonio, respond. So Jeremy Allaire, the founder of Circle, tweeted this out and then Antonio commented, saying DyDx would be excited to use CCTP on day one.
00:55:17.814 - 00:55:37.470, Speaker A: If you prioritize supporting cosmos, we'd use it for the main deposit and withdraw flow on DyDX. Super cool first use case there. I think that's great. So, thinking about having them on. Keep you posted. All right. The next thing is we're going to cruise through this and then I don't want to share too many thoughts on this because I have kind of negative thoughts on doodles.
00:55:37.470 - 00:56:21.238, Speaker A: So Doodles, one of the biggest NFT projects, they announced that they're moving to the flow blockchain, or Doodles two is launching on flow. Doodles two is like, I think the way I understand it is going to span, like, millions of nfts instead of the original 10,000 avatars in the first Doodle series. I think the core Doodles collection remains on ETH. The reason that I forget the Doodle founders name. Julian, maybe, or Jordan, I think it's Julian posted this thread on why they chose flow, but a. There's like, frictionless conversion, scalable with zero transaction fees. Programming language enables customizations and dynamic nfts.
00:56:21.238 - 00:56:43.102, Speaker A: And as a reminder, flow came out of cryptokitties. If you remember cryptokitties in the end of 2017, cryptokitties, like, clogged the entire Ethereum blockchain. They created flow as an offshoot so that it wouldn't as like a. As a. As a l. One that really, like, was built for nfts. And actually, a lot of the Doodles team came from cryptokitties and from flow.
00:56:43.102 - 00:57:03.350, Speaker A: So, like, I think there's a little bit of background there, but I don't know. This does feel like. I don't really know the details. We'll have doodles on to talk about this, but, like, it does feel like there's a little. I don't know that, like, flow kind of just went to doodles and was like, hey, guys, we know you from back in the day. We really want you to come onto our chain. Doodles is probably, like, I don't know.
00:57:03.350 - 00:57:20.826, Speaker A: Like, nobody uses flow. No one really likes flow. And then do. And then flow is like, I mean, we'll give you, like, a lot of money. We'll pay you $10 million or $20 million to come onto our chain. And not that it's really a bad thing to take that, but it doesn't. I don't know.
00:57:20.826 - 00:57:41.130, Speaker A: Something about it is not really sitting right. And even in the announcement that they shared, I don't know if you read that, but, like, it felt a little apologetic and, like, really, like, we're, like, overly explainative on why they were moving to flow. It felt like very much like we're moving to flow, but, like. But, like, don't be mad at us. Like, here are all the reasons why it's a good idea. So, I don't know. I'm probably.
00:57:41.130 - 00:57:45.094, Speaker A: I might be reading into it too much, but did want to share some of my candid thoughts there.
00:57:46.034 - 00:57:46.814, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:57:47.314 - 00:57:47.642, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:57:47.658 - 00:58:20.970, Speaker B: I don't have a strong opinion. So, yeah, I do want to touch on one last piece of news. I think it's an important thing that I want to raise awareness to, which is. So Kevin Rose got hacked, or, well, Kevin Rose signed a sick, approved, signed a signature that master was faking to be open opensea. And then that allowed the. That allowed the attacker, if you will, to drain his wallet and, you know, sell these nfts. So it was fairly sizable.
00:58:20.970 - 00:58:42.622, Speaker B: I mean, he was able to salvage a few of, like, a zombie punk. Wasn't affected, but he lost, like, I think, one to 2 million of nfts he had in this wallet. There's two things I want to touch on here. One, it's not a hack. I think it is very important when we try to do a post mortem of what happened, because it helps everyone in the space.
00:58:42.678 - 00:58:43.918, Speaker A: Right. Right.
00:58:44.086 - 00:59:04.882, Speaker B: That it wasn't a hack. He signed a sick. Like, he signed a signature that was faking. It was like, a phishing attack, and I think it's different. And the distinction might appear, like, nuanced, but I think it's fundamental here. A hack is it could be like zero day or something much more like that would affect other people potentially. Right.
00:59:04.882 - 00:59:35.588, Speaker B: And so I think this was, as difficult as it may seem, is, you know, it was just an omission, right, because it was just a phishing attack, but it wasn't a hack. And I think it's important to make that distinction because as a community tries to, like, help each other in these type of situations, you know, what ended up happening here is he was, there's this, like, he signed an off chain signature, created a listing for all of his open sea approved assets he had previously approved.
00:59:35.716 - 00:59:37.864, Speaker A: Where did he sign that from, though? Like, where?
00:59:39.524 - 01:00:23.000, Speaker B: So it's this thing. Seaport is what it was announced, like, last year, and it was, like, marketed as a huge upgrade to what was possible both on and off. OpenSea so kind of, like, allowed you more flexibility for trading assets, you know, and including, like, bulk trading for nfts, sweeping floors and, you know, a lot of it. So it's through C port allows anyone, in this case, the attacker, to create, like, this bundle, like, consolidating assets and offering a bunch of assets all at once. And so my understanding was, you know, it was, he was fish. He clicked this link. It appeared to be opensea.
01:00:23.000 - 01:00:54.082, Speaker B: It was just appeared to be like a harmless signature. He clicked it without looking and inspecting closely, and then that triggered this transfer of nfts. And then the attacker sold it for like $2 million. And so the thing, the learning here is one, be very careful on the links that you click. A lot of these are coming from discord. A lot of them might appear to be new mints. And so whenever you're interacting with that, be careful in the links that you're clicking.
01:00:54.082 - 01:01:10.866, Speaker B: Always verify. Have bookmarks in place in your browser. And if it's not a bookmark site, be very careful in what you're interacting. And the second one, perhaps more fundamental, is why did he have all his nfts in one wallet? I understand you might want to showcase this in a museum type of fashion.
01:01:10.930 - 01:01:15.654, Speaker A: But, yeah, I'm with you. That felt like a flex. Like, you only do that if you're trying to flex.
01:01:16.404 - 01:01:41.658, Speaker B: And if you have it in an EoA, just not a multisig. Be very careful if you're going to sell one NFT and you have 20 nfts, transfer the single piece of NFT that you want to sell to one other wallet and consider that wallet, the hot wallet, can interact with crazy batch of crazy contracts. Worst case, one you lose one, not 20.
01:01:41.836 - 01:01:42.150, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:01:42.182 - 01:02:10.920, Speaker B: And so it's really, really important, folks, to. It's really sad to see, you know, I hate to see this type of stuff, and, but we have to learn from it. And so it's just, it could be avoided. A hack, not necessarily the zero day type of stuff. It's like we're all going down. Like, you know, like, you have to upgrade your browser kind of stuff. You know, like, if it's like, you know, these password managers get hacked.
01:02:10.920 - 01:02:25.848, Speaker B: Like that. That's a hack. You know, that that is like, will affect potentially millions of users, and it requires kind of critical, immediate attention to the security community. This wasn't a hack. And so I think it's important to make that distinction.
01:02:25.936 - 01:02:31.120, Speaker A: Right. Yeah, 100%. Have you ever used revoke cache?
01:02:31.232 - 01:02:35.250, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, all the time. I revoke access to everything all the time.
01:02:35.362 - 01:02:51.370, Speaker A: Yeah. So I was going to recommend go to revoke. You can go to revoke cash to basically revoke access to any open contracts and approvals that you no longer, like, need or want. And, yeah, we definitely recommend people revoke all the, all the smart contract approvals that they don't need right now.
01:02:51.442 - 01:03:14.340, Speaker B: Yeah, please, folks, I will do that. Please. If there was, like, a banner here of, like, segregating segregate wallets, it costs nothing to have so many, like, create a new wallet. Just do it, folks. Don't. You do not want to cut corners when it comes to security, not how early the space is. Like, these things can largely be avoided.
01:03:14.340 - 01:03:51.114, Speaker B: Take time to learn. And if you don't know, and if you have any sort of doubt, ask. I've always found that one of the nicest things about crypto is it's a very friendly, collaborative community. Even though there's Maxis on both ends of the curve, largely, a lot of people here willing to help because we've all had that. There's, like, this idea that if you haven't been hacked, then you haven't been in crypto long enough. And it's just like a good assumption to take to heart because you just kind of have to assume that you're a target and just, you have to be really aware of this stuff.
01:03:51.654 - 01:03:53.394, Speaker A: Yeah, agreed.
01:03:54.474 - 01:04:25.312, Speaker B: A good place to end. I always recommend, well, I'll recommend the book quit, which I referenced by Annie Duke. Great, great read. Love to hear what other people think about this idea of quitting, particularly as we go into this bear market and whatever market psychologies like part of the cycle that we're in also apply to that. And the second I saw this Netflix documentary on tennis, which was made by the same people who drive to survive. It's called breakpoint. Pretty good, actually.
01:04:25.312 - 01:04:36.936, Speaker B: Pretty good. Not drive to survive, but not drive to survive. Not drive good, though I'm not as good, but. And the third piece is drive to survive comes out next week or the following week.
01:04:37.120 - 01:04:37.884, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:04:38.344 - 01:04:57.130, Speaker B: So why didn't go watch breakpoint? And if you think it's terrible, it will at least kill some time to take off a madness that's happening in crypto and then just wait. If you don't like it, drive just rides around the corners. So it's a warm up, it's a chaser, whatever you want to call it, for drive to survive, which we all know and love. So I will.
01:04:57.162 - 01:05:08.442, Speaker A: I will stick with the sports content for you. And I'm listening to a good podcast by the folks that acquired. They did a three and a half hour deep dive into the business behind the NFL. Really good podcast.
01:05:08.618 - 01:05:09.114, Speaker B: Interesting.
01:05:09.154 - 01:05:09.442, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:05:09.498 - 01:05:10.786, Speaker B: Well, let's put it in the show notes.
01:05:10.850 - 01:05:22.894, Speaker A: That's how you know we're in a bear market, is when we are. All of our content is just tennis f one NFL. There you go. Bear market, baby. Santi, been a pleasure. Thanks for listening. We will see you guys next week.
01:05:22.894 - 01:05:23.238, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:05:23.286 - 01:05:25.014, Speaker B: Thanks so much for tuning in, guys. Have a great weekend.
