00:00:00.160 - 00:00:09.914, Speaker A: Peter and I used to always say, like, the institutions are coming. And of course we meant, like, the Goldman's and the cities. And we were right about the institutions coming. We were just wrong on the type. It's really the brands.
00:00:10.374 - 00:00:50.094, Speaker B: All right, everyone, welcome back to the first episode of Empire of 2023. Super excited to have two of my favorite folks in the entire industry on Empire. Kicking off the year with us, we have Colleen Sullivan and Peter Johnson, the co leads of the venture team at Brevin Howard Digital. And we've got Santi co hosting this up with us. I just want to make sure everyone knows, like, all opinions in this episode expressed by Colleen or Peter or myself or Santi are solely our own personal opinions. They don't reflect the opinions of Revin Howard or Brevin Howard digital. No opinion should be expressed as an inducement to make a particular investment or follow a particular strategy.
00:00:50.094 - 00:01:15.032, Speaker B: These are all just opinions. This podcast is for informational purposes. We are really ramping up the legal side of things in 2023 as regulatory stuff perhaps cracks down. So empire, you're going to hear potentially a few more disclaimers than usual. So, Peter and Colleen, I thought it'd be an interesting way to kick this off. You guys made 15 predictions for the year, and I really do want to make sure we touch on each of those. So we're going to spend, like, maybe five minutes on each of the predictions for this episode.
00:01:15.032 - 00:01:31.484, Speaker B: But I actually want to start by just, like, really high level framework. So, Colleen, maybe, and I want to pick on both you guys for this opening question. Colleen, can you just give us your, like, high level framework of how, like, how you are thinking about crypto going into 2023, what you think this year looks like?
00:01:32.464 - 00:02:08.656, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I'm incredibly optimistic about 2023, which may sound strange coming off of 2022. As an investor in the space, I feel like obviously we see valuations coming down. We see the people that are really here because of the technology are the ones who stay. We've seen, you know, because Peter and I have been through, I think this is our third bear market at this point. And when I think about 2018 and 2019, there just wasn't that much built. You know, we didn't have the brands that we have in the space today. We don't have the financial institutions that we have in the space today.
00:02:08.656 - 00:02:23.124, Speaker A: And things are really working today. So we've got a much higher foundation than the last bear market. So it couldn't be more excited, which, you know, I think most of our predictions are really optimistic. So you'll hear more about that as we go through them today.
00:02:23.824 - 00:02:25.124, Speaker B: Peter, what about you?
00:02:25.464 - 00:02:58.030, Speaker C: Yeah, I would totally echo that in that I am incredibly excited about where we are today and maybe that's different than some folks, but having gone through multiple cycles and seen 2013, 2014, it was all about bitcoin. And then I would say most people thought crypto was going to die. 2017, 2018, you had ico. Boom. And a lot of people thought crypto was going to die. And there wasn't, as Cleen mentioned, there wasn't really a lot that was built at that point. And then in this cycle, you actually had a ton of things that are launched and getting traction.
00:02:58.030 - 00:03:38.674, Speaker C: You have Defi, you have nfts, you have stable coins, you have brands coming into the space. All of these real meaningful traction that you didn't have last time's around. So I think this time most people don't think, hey, crypto is going to go away. It's okay. What is this cycle going to look like and how deep is it going to go and how long is it going to take? But nobody thinks it's going anywhere. And we all, I think most people that have been around realize this is a fundamental technological innovation, that you have true digital ownership, you have open network value transfer that is not going anywhere, that's going to change the world in some way or another. And we're starting to see those changes in payments and branded goods and gaming and all of these things that we're going to talk about.
00:03:38.674 - 00:04:11.484, Speaker C: If you believe that, hey, this is going to change the world, then as an investor, when do you want to be investing? Do you want to be investing top of the hype cycle or in a trough? Obviously you want to be investing in a trough. So we're in a great time to be investing right now. And for me and Cleen, like one, thrilled to be working with Colleen, like one of the best investors in the world. So just thrilled to have partnered up with her this year. We're at Brevin Howard, which I think is a great place to be. So feel great about the industry, feel great about timing, feel great about our team overall. Just feeling really good.
00:04:12.344 - 00:04:39.302, Speaker B: Just got a couple of optimists here on the show. So I love it. I think let's. So when I was, I really liked your guys predictions, which is why we wanted to have you on the podcast. So I think let's start with the infrastructure side of things because, Peter, you just mentioned payments there and the first prediction that you guys had was stablecoin. Volumes surpass visa volumes. So I'm curious as to, I'd love to just hear, Peter, you make this prediction and expand on why this is kind of the first one that you.
00:04:39.318 - 00:04:40.274, Speaker D: Guys put out there.
00:04:40.734 - 00:05:35.052, Speaker C: Yeah. So for me, this is a big one. And this is something that I, and we have been paying attention to for a long time. And that stable coins, I think, are fairly clearly one of the first real killer apps for crypto, in that for the first time ever, anyone in the world has access to dollars, can save in dollars, can spend in dollars, transact in dollars, and there is insatiable demand around the world for dollars. And stablecoin is how that demand is being met. Weve seen the growth of stablecoins over the last few years. Its really only been a few years that theyve really had any meaningful usage, but it's really exploded over the last four or five years and this year in 2020, stablecoins on chains and stablecoin settlement volume, so this excludes on exchange volumes, just actual on chain volumes, was about $7 trillion in volume.
00:05:35.052 - 00:06:26.012, Speaker C: And I think that most people don't realize that that's already significantly larger than Mastercard, which is at about 2 trillion. Amex, which is at about a trillion discover, which is 200 billion. And it's getting close to Visa, which is the largest payment network in the world, our largest card network in the world, which settles about $12 trillion a year. So it's a pretty short leap at this point for stable coins to surpass Visa and to surpass all the major card networks combined. And I think that that was a stat that we put out there that I think a lot of people didn't realize. And it caught their attention because it just shows the scale that stablecoins are at. And I think that's really just the start of where stable coins are going to be.
00:06:26.012 - 00:06:54.560, Speaker C: I think it's a good comparison point because Visa and these card networks are processing a lot of volume. But the real kind of the final bosses that stablecoins are going to come for, it's the wholesale money movement networks like ACh and Fedwire. And it's actually really impressive. You can compare it to those networks. And ACh is doing $70 trillion a year. Fedwire is doing like a quadrillion dollars a year. Big numbers.
00:06:54.560 - 00:07:21.694, Speaker C: But that means stablecoins are already doing 13% of ACH volumes, 1% of Fedwire volumes. That's crazy. The world financial system runs on Fedwire, and stablecoins are already doing 1%. And they're only a few years old. So I think that we are just at the beginning of stablecoins really changing how money moves across the world. That's something that we're really excited about. We spend a lot of time on that.
00:07:23.674 - 00:07:48.962, Speaker B: I really like that prediction. I think my only pushback potentially would be like Mastercard and Visa and discovering those folks, those volumes are sourced from consumer spending. But I think a lot of stablecoin volume is more like trading and investing or speculatory, I would say. I'm curious about how you think about comparing two buckets that maybe aren't perfect comparisons.
00:07:49.058 - 00:07:52.454, Speaker C: Yeah, they're definitely imperfect comparisons.
00:07:54.924 - 00:07:55.372, Speaker D: But I.
00:07:55.388 - 00:08:42.500, Speaker C: Do think it gives a sense of scale on making the comparison. And two is that I think a lot of people look at stablecoins and they just said, this is all speculation. And we've looked into that some and we don't believe that's true. And if you look at where stablecoins are held, earlier this year we took a look at where are stablecoins? Are they held on exchanges? Are they in smart contracts? Are they in non custodial wallets? Because that gives, it's not an exact science, but gives you a sense of how stablecoins are being used. And this was in, we looked at it in October of this year, and only 8% of USDC and 25% of USDT was held on exchanges. Put that together, less than 20% of stablecoins are actually held on exchanges. You have another percentage that's in smart contracts.
00:08:42.500 - 00:09:32.254, Speaker C: But then the majority of stablecoins, over half of USDC and over 60% of USDT are held outside of exchanges. Outside of smart contracts. Those numbers are actually going to be higher now because a lot of people have moved their stable coins off of exchanges. But even at that time, you say, okay, these are coins that very likely are not being used purely for speculation because they're not on exchanges and they're not in smart contracts. You can also look at the distribution of holdings, and at least on Ethereum, 75% of wallets that hold stablecoins hold less than $100 of stablecoins. So these are, it's not just, hey, these are a bunch of big market makers that hold these and they're moving it between exchanges. It's a lot of small dollar accounts that people are holding, often in non custodial wallets, which to me indicates that these are being used for something other than just speculation.
00:09:33.314 - 00:10:07.314, Speaker D: Would you say that from a sort of KPI standpoint, what is more important to you? Is it total transaction volume? Is it average, like number, like frequency or volume or size, because a lot of times folks have multiple wallets and so it's difficult to track that. But would you rather see, I guess the question is, would you rather see average transaction value, like average holdings in wallets grow or would you rather see total number of wallets grow? I mean, it's not mutually exclusive, but what do you, when you think about this category and prediction, what is more interesting, important to you?
00:10:07.814 - 00:10:31.094, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that the, like, the number that we put out there as far as transaction volume is meaningful because it's an eye catching stat. And I think the comparison there is eye catching. I think what I'm most excited about is the non speculative usage and that is probably things more like number of wallets that are active and transacting is going to be more indicative of, of what you're actually seeing there for non speculative usage.
00:10:32.434 - 00:10:39.654, Speaker B: Last question on this bucket and then we'll go to the prediction number two. Do you think, who do you think wins this stable coin game?
00:10:41.034 - 00:10:45.134, Speaker C: USDC, I think has a pretty dominant lead here.
00:10:46.754 - 00:11:02.134, Speaker B: Maybe a better question that, Peter, because I had a feeling you were going to say USDC, is do you think we'll see a real competitor in the, maybe like the algorithmic stablecoin space, basically a non USDC competitor, like a non centralized competitor?
00:11:02.434 - 00:11:26.788, Speaker C: I really don't think so, not in a meaningful way. I wish that was not true. I would love to see a more decentralized stablecoin that much more fits with the ethos of crypto. And it would be great to have. I think realistically, regulators don't like algorithmic stablecoins. People don't really trust them. After Luna, it's going to be hard for non centralized stablecoins to get significant traction.
00:11:26.788 - 00:11:58.714, Speaker C: And on one hand that's somewhat of a bummer because there is centralization there, but it also is, it's somewhat centralized, but it still is an open system and these are still open network dollars, which is completely different than the current system, which is completely closed network. If you want to onboarding to dollars right now, you have to have a bank account or be part of the Fedwire system or Zelle, everything is closed network, stable coins, even if they are issued by a centralized party, these are open network dollars. And I think that that is the most important point.
00:11:58.834 - 00:12:26.484, Speaker B: Yep. All right, so your response to Santiago is that one of the most important metrics that you're looking at is the number of wallets, the number of active wallets. Colleen, I think I'd throw prediction number two to you, which is this bucket of digital goods. Right. Prediction number two that you had was brands bring millions of new users to web3 and generate over 500 million from nfts. So I think is that brands alone will generate over 500 million from nfts. Would love to hear you expand on this prediction.
00:12:26.944 - 00:12:35.296, Speaker A: Yeah. So. Well, okay. I listened to you on a podcast this weekend. You mentioned the Starbucks odyssey program.
00:12:35.360 - 00:12:49.332, Speaker B: We actually had a lot of similar predictions for the year, which there was another one. Yeah, we had about Opensea and. Yeah, uniswap. And so we actually overlap with some of these predictions. But, yeah. Okay. I'd love to hear you talk about this.
00:12:49.388 - 00:13:20.294, Speaker A: Yeah. So, okay. Here's the way I think about things, and I think Starbucks is an interesting one to start with because, well, first of all, they're not new to web3. I think a lot of people forget that they invested in Bakkt in 2018. So part of me wonders if the Starbucks odyssey is. The Odyssey name is indicative of the journey they've taken over the last four years to sort of find product market fit within web3. So Starbucks has 27 million loyalty members that they're going to be introducing to Odyssey.
00:13:20.294 - 00:13:48.414, Speaker A: And Odyssey, obviously built on Polygon. If you take a closer look at it, it's really a game. It's very much like Pokemon Go, where you have to complete certain challenges and you get stamps. So Starbucks is calling NFT stamps, and then those lead to rewards and experiences. So that's Starbucks. Right, with its 27 million. And then you've got Instagram coming out with its product for creators that is also built around nfts on Polygon.
00:13:48.414 - 00:14:14.180, Speaker A: That's 2 billion users. Then you get into Reddit. Reddit has, I think, 50 million daily active users, and they've built out their digital collectibles program with their nfts. So we're just seeing more and more of the brands engaging in this space. And so that is sort of the foundation that this piece is built on. Peter and I used to always say the institutions are coming. And of course, we meant like, the Goldmans and the cities.
00:14:14.180 - 00:14:49.514, Speaker A: And we were right about the institutional company. We were just wrong on the type. It's really the brands. So we've spent a lot of time thinking about, why is that? Why are the brands willing to innovate over here, especially brands like Tiffany's and Gucci? They've been around for over 100 years. And we think that it's because they're not afraid to take risk, meet their customers where they are, and Gen Z, Gen Alpha, digitally native. This is where their future customers reside. And so that's really the foundation that this prediction is built on.
00:14:49.514 - 00:15:49.544, Speaker A: We just see a tremendous amount of engagement here and it's opening up net new revenue monetization streams for these players. So you've got, you know, and I heard you talking about fidgitals, right? So you've got a brand like Gucci that today is within Roblox selling five dollar purses to kids playing that game. But as those kids grow older and their purchasing power increases, it's going to be a $5,000 phygital. So a physical bag with an NFC or RFID chip within it tied to an NFT, and importantly, you'll be able to bifurcate those. But through that microchip tied to blockchain, you'll be able to verify the authenticity of that project, of the product. You'll be able to verify from a sustainability standpoint where the materials came that built that product. So it's really, you know, and then you're going to have like, just direct to avatar commerce where you don't have the fidgital but just the NFT item that the avatar will wear in the metaverse environment.
00:15:49.544 - 00:15:55.064, Speaker A: So that, you know, that's the origin of that particular prediction.
00:15:57.124 - 00:16:27.442, Speaker B: Do you? I actually think this ties, I think my question ties in with your third prediction, which is. The third prediction is Polygon's NFT volumes catch up to its business development, which is a really interesting prediction because it does seem like Polygon has basically won this, has, like, cornered the market for brands building in the digital goods space. So I just, I'd love to hear you talk about, like, predictions for Polygon, agree or disagree that, like, they've won this niche and then maybe expand on what that prediction actually entails.
00:16:27.538 - 00:16:53.018, Speaker A: Yeah. So Polygon brought over a guy named Ryan Wyatt to head up Polygon Studios. And Ryan came out of YouTube. He led YouTube gaming, and he's phenomenal. He's a force of nature. So I think what Polygon has done, first and foremost, is hired really well and built out a great team. Another really important factor is the merge.
00:16:53.018 - 00:17:28.910, Speaker A: So all of these brands care about sustainability. Like, they really fundamentally care and their customers care. And it's important because post merge, you can go into the ecosystem. So the ethereum ecosystem, of course, which Polygon is built in, where you have all of the customers, the liquidity, the infrastructure, the safety, the security, and that leads to better experiences for brands and customers. So Polygon is sort of sitting in the middle of all of this. And I think what we've seen thus far is fantastic business development. And now we're about to see execution.
00:17:28.910 - 00:17:53.606, Speaker A: So that's the only sort of open question is can they deliver, can they execute as well as they've been able to bring in these companies and brands? And I think the answer is going to be yes. Peter and I, our experience with the Polygon team is they're outstanding. So I think it's too early to say that they've officially won, but they're in pole position for sure.
00:17:53.790 - 00:18:19.322, Speaker B: Yeah. How do you. So it sounds like you heard me mention on the other podcast, I got the demo of the Starbucks platform and saw what's coming and it's super cool. And I will say I have been very, I almost have, like, battle scars, I think from the 2017, like blockchain, not bitcoin. Like, I think I've been pretty anti corporates getting into crypto because I was just like, they don't know how to do it. They're not going to do it. Right.
00:18:19.322 - 00:18:57.014, Speaker B: They always chase this thing and then they, and then they disband their teams a year later once we get into the bear market. But after seeing what Starbucks is doing, it kind of red pilled me, honestly. But I also, it kind of clicked that nfts for brands, they're really nothing crazy. They're kind of just like loyalty programs on steroids, I would say. It's like, if you think about loyalty programs as something that has gotten better and better, but like marginally better and better over the years, this is like a ten. Nfts are like a ten x improvement on existing loyalty programs. I'm curious if you guys agree or disagree with that framework for brand based nfts.
00:18:57.474 - 00:19:49.958, Speaker A: I think it's part of the framework and I think it's a really important part of the framework because through these loyalty programs tied to nfts, you go direct to your customer, so there's no intermediary in between you and the customer anymore and you can continue to feed them experiences and rewards. So I think that part is really important. But I also think there's the phigital and the straight digital component. So we like to say that House of Gucci's biggest competitor isn't Prada, it's House of Fortnite. So fortnight over the last four years has sold $20 billion worth of virtual goods, so emotes and cosmetics skins. And that we expect to continue. I mean, that's why you've seen these brands go into games and sell digital goods for gaming avatars, whether that's skins or bags or whatever it may be.
00:19:49.958 - 00:20:30.634, Speaker A: And I just know through my own kids that this concept of what is real and what is virtual is merged. Your friends in Fortnite, your friends in school, they're just friends. So again, it kind of goes back to this younger generation where you have 75% of the kids in the United States, UK, New Zealand, Australia, and Canada in Roblox. So 50 million daily active users, 10 million people in there at a time. Like, it's a different generation. And the brands know that they have to meet that generation where they are. So I think that direct to avatar commerce, just the pure digital items, will become really important.
00:20:30.634 - 00:20:46.054, Speaker A: You want to flex in the metaverse or the environment that you're in. And then I do think fidgitals, I really think, like, we will look back in a few years and think it's odd that we ever bought, like, a streetwear or luxury good that didn't have an NFT tied to it.
00:20:46.914 - 00:20:49.162, Speaker B: I think we're gonna need a better name than fidgetals, though.
00:20:49.218 - 00:20:55.850, Speaker A: Oh, it's terrible. Yeah, we've heard so many. Yeah, yeah.
00:20:55.922 - 00:21:01.974, Speaker B: Our, the producer of Empire Shout out Garrett was like, can you please not use the word phigital on this podcast? I was like, I don't know if I can.
00:21:03.074 - 00:21:07.614, Speaker D: If I could fickle and fidgety. It's. Yeah.
00:21:11.834 - 00:21:12.718, Speaker B: Okay.
00:21:12.906 - 00:21:24.554, Speaker D: On prediction, I'm just curious to take, like, what, where would you look at in terms of, like, what could derail polygon or what could derailed brands coming into the space?
00:21:28.974 - 00:22:29.144, Speaker A: It's a good question because I've thought about this quite a bit in the sense that, you know, does our investment thesis need to change after everything we've just gone through with FTX, all of the lender issues that we've had in 2022, and I kind of go back to, like, NBA Top shot and dapper, and that was built during the bear market, and I tend to think so. It's almost like, if what we've been through in 2022 hasn't scared these big brands away, and it doesn't appear to be doing that. Like, that is a great stress test for your question. And it doesn't feel. I mean, it's early, right? We're still not even through that, but it doesn't feel like it's going to scare brands away. I think, again, partly because there is this new avenue for monetization and revenue. There's something really there.
00:22:29.144 - 00:22:41.014, Speaker A: So I don't. Yeah, so I, yeah, I feel good about where we are with brands coming in and them staying in and it being sticky.
00:22:42.314 - 00:23:41.334, Speaker B: Santia it reminds me of something that we've talked about a lot, which is like, this stuff only gets implemented when it's actually a better, when there's a business use case for it. Um, and like the biz, the business use case for, I'm going to use the word phigital here, which is terrible. But like, or like digital goods or something like, basically having a digital goods strategy in my mind is incredibly strong right now, which is if you're a brand you're worried about, I would be worried about one of maybe my big concerns would be like, how do I reach kids age like 17 and under or something like that? Because I think they're getting more and more wealth. Kids are getting wealthier and wealthier because they're able to make money online faster and faster and younger and younger. And if you're a traditional brand, like, you basically have to make your experience very, your product very experiential and your brand very experiential and nfts and like digital, having a strong digital goods strategy is like the natural extension of that. So.
00:23:41.634 - 00:24:25.474, Speaker A: Well, it's kind of funny, that point. And I know we need to move on to make it quick, but it's like with my kids coming up, they didn't want dollars, they wanted v bucks or robux. Like the concept of us dollars was kind of like, well, I'm just going to convert it into digital dollars, you know, in my game anyway, so I don't want those. And I think for parents too, it's like, okay, well, you know, they can, the kids can buy something within a game. I don't have to like throw them in the car and take them to the store and like go get this thing. Like it's just right there, right in front of you. The Wall Street Journal actually had a really good article on this where they also noted that kids are spending, I think it's age twelve to 1792 a month on online goods, most of those being virtual items.
00:24:25.474 - 00:24:32.154, Speaker A: So again, it's just this generational shift that I think we're seeing with Gen Z and Gen Alpha.
00:24:32.974 - 00:25:22.118, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, just for stats purposes, I mean, you've got, you're still seeing like 2020, $5 billion of NFT volume this year, certainly tied to the activity happening in broader crypto. But it does feel like you're seeing some collections of nfts just doing well in spite of the current market conditions. You know, just for context. I mean, the market, discucci alone, certain brands are just generating, you know, not to, you know, in terms of size, it's just a drop in the bucket. So if you bring on a luxury segment or just a gaming segment or just some sort of. Not just retail, but other all kinds of brands, it doesn't take much to see this volume go to 100 billion, you know, 200 billion over the next five years. So people will continue to spend.
00:25:22.118 - 00:25:29.194, Speaker D: And the trend towards digital and gaming, people like to be entertained in bull and bear markets.
00:25:29.854 - 00:25:57.664, Speaker B: Yeah. There was another prediction that ties into some of the stuff that Santiago was talking about and what, Colleen, you were mentioning with v bucks, one of the predictions, I think, is number six or seven was talking about gaming studios integrating nfts into existing games. And I think you laid out these four stages of how that will happen. I'd love to hear one of you. I don't know, Colleen, if you want to continue on this or if, Peter, you want to jump in, but would love to hear you kind of expand on these four stages.
00:25:58.404 - 00:26:41.706, Speaker A: Sure. Yeah. And it's really stages that we've seen. We started investing in web3 and gaming in 2018. And so I would say, like, stage one was really, and this is all specific to web two game developers and publishers, but really the first step was kind of monitoring what was going on, almost like having little incubators. And Ubisoft was really the first one that we saw do this where they had the entrepreneurs lab accelerator and they would admit web3 gaming studios. So I think it was an interesting way for Ubisoft to kind of monitor, like, what are they doing? What does crypto do for games? Should we be paying attention to this? So is stage one.
00:26:41.706 - 00:27:29.340, Speaker A: Stage two was investing in web3 gaming startups to get just that much closer and really understanding what's going on behind the scenes. So here we saw take two, the creator of GTA invest in Horizon blockchain games. Ubisoft also did, and notwithstanding Tim Sweeney's cryptocurrency tweet from last week, Epic Games has invested in Manticore's last two rounds. And Manticore is essentially a competitor to Roblox, building out Metaverse tooling for user generated content. And they've added in web3 tools for creators. Epic also offers core on the Epic Games store. So we're seeing this activity in stage two.
00:27:29.340 - 00:28:25.794, Speaker A: Stage three is where we see web two game developers set up specific subsidiaries for crypto games, web3 games. So essentially wanting to bifurcate that a little bit away from the parent company, whether that's for legal reasons, because a crypto game may have tokens and nfts and you don't want that potential liability to flow up, or it's because of some of the gamer backlash we've seen against nfts. But that was a structure that Peter and I saw a decent amount last year. And we think this is going to be the year where you don't necessarily need that subsidiary, where you start to add just some elements of crypto, whether that's adding USDC as a payment rail for crypto type purchases. Now, of course, that's not going to be within the App Store, given everything that's going on, but for a web based game, or it's adding NFT elements, bits of ownership to the game, we think that's where we'll start to move into in 2023.
00:28:26.374 - 00:28:47.814, Speaker B: Do you think this will come from a tier one gaming company? Like leaning into crypto? Like, what are some Sony or Microsoft or EA or Activision Blizzard, take two, one of those? Or is it going to come from like a tier two, tier three that says crap, we're falling behind and like, our best strategy here is leaning into crypto.
00:28:48.634 - 00:29:14.242, Speaker A: You know, I do think it will come from tier one. You know, we saw Ubisoft try to do this with its game Ghost recon, where it added nfts. And of course there was this big backlash. But Ubisoft has not given up. They've said the gamers just don't really understand the utility of nfts and what that brings to them. That now they're going to own the assets. They're not sitting on Ubisoft servers anymore, and they have secondary liquidity.
00:29:14.242 - 00:29:47.234, Speaker A: And eventually, because these assets are programmable and composable, they can plug into defi, you can rent, you can lend out, you can get liquidity through Uniswap. So, I mean, I think that we will see, and I would view Ubisoft as a tier one gaming studio. I think that they will continue to push the envelope here and really open this up. And then I would be watching firms like Epic to see what they decide to do. Take two for sure. So I think we'll see it from a tier one in 2023.
00:29:47.894 - 00:30:26.124, Speaker B: Peter, can I ask you about the financialization of nfts? Because that was something that really started to like, catch a narrative, I guess I'd call it at the end of the last bull market is really like lending against using nfts as collateral. Really like the financialization of your nfts. There's a lot of risk associated with that. And now that we're on the other side of the bull market and a year into this bear market, you maybe look back at that and say, like, wow, that's probably actually good thing that that didn't take off, really. I'm curious to get your take on if you think all these like in game nfts will and like these brand nfts, like what the financialization around those looks like and what it should look like.
00:30:27.624 - 00:31:09.334, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm sure Colleen has had some good views on this as well. I think that there's like different angles to the financialization or financial products that are being built around nfts. There's things like buy now, pay later, which I think makes a lot of sense as nfts are increasingly consumables and they're not investments. It's something that you want to buy. It's like a luxury good or a fashion good, and you want to pay for that over time. And that completely makes sense. Things like lending, like borrowing against your nfts, I think probably makes sense for some of the higher value items, things like crypto punks or fidenzas that are really high end artwork in some sense.
00:31:09.334 - 00:31:27.994, Speaker C: So putting those types of products, I think, around them do make sense, or could make sense. There's things like the fractionalization of nfts. I think that that's a little bit tougher, especially as you get into the securities potential issues around there. But I think it depends on which financial product you're looking at. And some of them make sense and some, I think it will probably have some issues.
00:31:28.894 - 00:31:37.594, Speaker B: Santa, would you ever use your punks or any other maybe valuable NFT you have as collateral, or does that feel like too risky to.
00:31:38.194 - 00:32:15.594, Speaker D: It depends. There are some which I will definitely not, and I'm an investor in some sort of finance, like, you know, JPEG and a few others, I think. I do think it will like the art market, like the, the art market and luxury market and like loans for that type of use cases is massive. And so I think you'll see some, but I don't think, I think a subset of NFTs do lend themselves fairly well for that. And I think you're seeing that with a type of also investors that are coming in and just sweeping floors. They don't necessarily have a particular attachment to punk 9159 or 62 whatever, and so. But yeah, I definitely see that.
00:32:15.594 - 00:32:50.790, Speaker D: More exciting thing is if it nfts as we think of them today is just purely kind of art. But if it works for art, then you can extend that to so many other use cases, insurance contracts. And I mean, when people talk about financialization amenities, I say, well, think of it. An NFT is just an illiquid asset. So if that's a real estate, you know, digitized real estate, you know, contract or whatever, insurance contract, or you can basically, the fractionalization use case, I think, is going to be much, much more interesting for things other than art.
00:32:50.982 - 00:33:22.814, Speaker B: What is the room for, like, the crypto native brands, I guess I'd call them, because in this world that you're talking about here, Colleen and Peter, there's like, a lot of the big brands are coming into nfTs. It's like Reddit and Starbucks and they're coming into nfTs. And then you've got like, all right, well, who's going to do well in the crypto gaming space? You've got like Ubisoft and take two and Fortnite. Like, what is the. When you. Because obviously you two lead the venture side of Rev and Howard Digital. Where do you look to invest in the gaming space right now?
00:33:23.954 - 00:34:17.914, Speaker A: Oh, let me, let me answer the first part of the question first. I think there's an interesting answer there because Alex Danko, who runs blockchain for Shopify, had this great interview that he did with Paki McCormick on token gated commerce and the power of cross collaboration. So basically, I'm Gucci and I want to reach Santiago, who's a punk holder. So I'm going to collaborate with you guys so I can get to all the punks holders and I can introduce them to these Gucci products. It's almost like what Tiffany's did right with punks. So it's this cross pollination, and I think that's where the magic really happens, where you bring these two communities together and you introduce them to each other. And that's where these crypto native brands and what's being built on the crypto side is so important.
00:34:17.914 - 00:35:09.060, Speaker A: And a lot of the traditional brands really want to access those communities and vice versa. So, you know, when we think about investing in this space, well, the gaming space, let's go there really quick, because the way I think about investing in the gaming space is I don't really want to take single game risk. So if I look at the Apple App Store, there's like 900,000 plus games there. Google Play, I think it's 400 plus Steam, 10,000 games a year. That tells me there's just a ton of content and I'm not better than anybody else at figuring out what's going to be a hit. So I want to be more on the Epic Games model side of things for Web three, where you've got companies building out all of the technology that's going to help bring that game to life. So it's almost like Fortnite is the tent pole for the Unreal engine and that's what we really look to invest in.
00:35:09.060 - 00:35:25.664, Speaker A: Like who's building out the tech that's going to bring these games to life? And maybe they have a tentpole game that they're going to test everything out on as they then spread it out into the web3 community. But that's where I really see the investing in web3 games for us.
00:35:26.164 - 00:36:12.734, Speaker D: Not to get too off track, but I do think about this a lot. Like, would you rather invest in an l one that accrues like the MEV, for instance, if it has an l, one that has like great unit economics. This is going to capture all this volume. Do you buy Fortnite secondary or do you think on a relative basis, like try to find some sort of tooling that is helping brands like enter the space more of like a consultant, which doesn't necessarily scale that well? Or do you invest in a wallet that renders nfts really nicely? I'm just kind of curious because sometimes it all really just boils down to on a relative basis and a risk adjusted basis, like what is the best way to play this? What we're seeing is a massive growth in nfts.
00:36:13.234 - 00:36:52.918, Speaker A: Yeah. And it's an interesting question to try to answer in the sense that some of what I feel like we're investing in was almost unimaginable a year ago. So it's just changing so rapidly. So I think a good example here might be one of our portfolio companies, Horizon blockchain games. And what originally attracted us to Horizon was the game Skyweaver, which is a trading card game very similar to the gathering, but using nfts. But Horizon is so much more. They had to build a smart contract based wallet called sequence that uses social logins.
00:36:52.918 - 00:37:49.464, Speaker A: You've got key recovery because they had to bring in non crypto people to play the game. So first they had to build the wallet because they were so early. Then they built out an AMM for 1155 because trading cards are semi fungible, and they realized that they needed an internal vertical marketplace for those cards that now other companies building in web3 are using. So it's like they've built these pieces of infrastructure that are making it easier for other web3 game developers to come into this space. But I can tell you, when I was at CMT Digital and we first invested in Horizon, I didn't realize that's sort of exactly what this was going to grow into. And I think they will keep growing and iterating to sort of fill those needs. So it's kind of hard to say in that sense.
00:37:49.464 - 00:38:05.316, Speaker A: Like, would I rather invest in like an l one or a company like horizon where I see very different and unique monetization verticals across what they're doing? Yeah. So I don't think I have a good answer to that.
00:38:05.440 - 00:38:06.144, Speaker D: Hmm.
00:38:06.924 - 00:38:43.208, Speaker B: There was one last gaming prediction I want to talk about, and then we can move into the infrastructure side of things. And Peter, I'm really looking forward to talking to you about that. It was about gaming interoperability, which is funny because I think that's the kind of red, it's actually the wrong red pill moment for a lot of people. It's like, maybe especially for non gamers, you're like, oh, I can take my, like I played Halo and I became a general and like, I got these cool things, but then I was never able to move that into like my madden game. Like, oh, that, that sounds awesome. I'll be able to do that. Gamers oftentimes know that that doesn't actually happen.
00:38:43.208 - 00:38:58.244, Speaker B: Right. And I think you actually had the line like said no, whenever I want to take my peely skin out of Fortnite and drop it into Grand Theft Auto. Like, no, that actually is not what people desire. So I'm curious just to hear where you guys think interoperability within games goes.
00:38:59.514 - 00:39:50.934, Speaker A: Yeah, so we think that the magic really happens when you get into the programmability and the composability of the gaming items. So, you know, one thing that we heard from a few teams building in the space is, you know, Jason, you're going to come in with your wallet and you've got some like really awesome doodle in there. And you're going to connect into a game. Let's say it's like a Pokemon go type game that's built for web3. So you connect your metamask wallet, you've got your really awesome doodle in there. The game is going to recognize, and it's already ranked all the doodles that exist. So that the game devs have said, okay, we're going to take punks, we're going to take doodles, we're going to take apes, we're going to take world of women and we're going to rank all of the different nfts.
00:39:50.934 - 00:40:32.596, Speaker A: So when you enter, and we've obviously ranked our own in game assets, we're going to say, okay, Jason's coming in. He might sort of be like a whale because this is a really expensive cool doodle that he owns. So we're going to grant him a really awesome, let's say, charizard, which has a really high, like, you know, fight ratio. And when you enter the game, then you enter sort of with that superpower that you can then use in the game. So those are the kind of things that we're starting to see. And I think that's where things start to get very interesting. So it's not necessarily, like you said, dropping peely into GTA.
00:40:32.596 - 00:40:58.424, Speaker A: It's more like how, and especially with the changes that Apple's made with privacy. Like what are the unique user acquisition methods going to be in web3 gaming that aren't really possible in web two gaming? And now they're even harder to do in web two gaming. And one is like through looking at what's in a wallet and then bringing those attributes into an existing game.
00:41:00.884 - 00:41:26.696, Speaker D: Yeah, that's such a good point. Like when you read actually transcripts of games and how they revenue has softened this year, they do allude to it's become very, very difficult to acquire users and much more expensive. But just broadly, I think it extends even beyond gaming. Like nfts are the cookies. I mean, you're building an identity. And most people don't have hundreds of wallets. They kind of have a wallet that is front facing and purposely do that.
00:41:26.696 - 00:41:53.278, Speaker D: And I think that trend will probably persist, especially if you start then getting a lot of benefits from brands. You enter a store, you scan something, you get an empty that then gives you certain perks or discounts. It's just not brands. It could be airlines, it could be really anything. You can even enter a country and scan. If you have certain nfts, you get certain perks, get, you know, and so it could be crazy. Some people might look at this and say this is like panopticon.
00:41:53.278 - 00:42:08.154, Speaker D: Like this is true surveillance state. But like, I think, you know, it just depends on, you know, people who use Twitter, Facebook, some of these social media platforms that are free, I think understand that, you know, it's not really free. That comes at a cost, I guess, of privacy.
00:42:11.154 - 00:42:45.028, Speaker B: I remember Laura Shin episode in 2018 with Marco Santori and they were talking about cryptokitties actually. And it was actually the first time I ever heard this. But Marco, four and a half years ago, Marco is like, it's not about cryptokitties. It's about brands being able to track people in the new digital world and to give them opportunities for new experiential things. And I heard that, I was like, that makes no sense. How are cryptokitties? That just hit me. I just got reminded of that I want to pivot into some market infrastructure stuff.
00:42:45.028 - 00:43:19.664, Speaker B: And maybe the nice pivot into this would actually be one of your predictions around NFT market infrastructure, which was around Opensea. This was actually one of my predictions for the year as well, which was Opensea's market share ends up falling. If you look back at the bull market, they had 75 or 80% market share. Now they're hovering in the like 40% to 50% market share. I don't know if Peter, Colleen, who wants to take this, but one of your predictions was that Opensea market share would fall below 25%, which is a pretty substantial drop. So we'd love to hear your thoughts on this.
00:43:22.444 - 00:44:36.368, Speaker C: Yeah, I think either of us can speak to this, but yeah, I think you made the same exact prediction, and that there's a lot of emerging competition for Opensea that are picking away at different angles. You have pseudoswap for AMm style floor trading, like blur for professional style trading, nifty swap for ERC 1155s, rarible, et cetera. All of these more specific marketplaces that appeal to different users. And we think we're going to continue to see that. As you see more gaming assets, as you're seeing more fashion and luxury type assets, then it won't be a one size fits all for everybody. It makes me think of, I don't know if anyone's familiar with this, but years ago there was this graphic of banks being unbundled, and you had each of these specific things that banks did, and they all turned into fintech startups. And I think we're going to see a lot of that in crypto as well, as you have these kind of monolithic platforms that are built for everybody, and that gives the opportunity for more niche players to come in that serve certain user segments better.
00:44:36.368 - 00:44:39.484, Speaker C: And I think that's one of the things that we're going to see around nfts.
00:44:41.544 - 00:45:11.344, Speaker B: Can I take the other side of our. I know we all made this prediction. I agreed with this prediction. Let me try to take the other side of the prediction, though, which is that if you look at marketplace businesses, there's usually a massive power law. And usually it's a winner take all or winner take most market. Like if you look at you remember the ride sharing boom of like several years ago you had Uber and Lyft, but then you also had via and get. And I forget at one point there are like nine different ones in New York or.
00:45:11.764 - 00:45:55.248, Speaker D: Yeah, Jason, what you're saying though is ride sharing is one very specific vertical, whereas nfTs, I think what Peter's saying is like there are very different types. It's like e commerce, right? You have net a port a. And like, like if you look at the e commerce composition, yeah, Amazon has a big, big chunk for particular categories, but the UCL luxury segment has whole new different, like total different, you know, platform. You have Etsy, you have of course, like they all come at different kind of volume relative to the vertical that they're going after. But still, I think people from a discovery standpoint would much rather, people are not buying like Gucci bags on Amazon. Gucci has never purposely sold their product on Amazon because it just would, it goes, it's counter to the brand. What I'm saying.
00:45:55.248 - 00:46:15.904, Speaker D: There are very different types of nfTs. Right. But also, like the question for me is more from a liquidity standpoint, perhaps that's where the aggregator comes in because you might have many front facing kind of marketplaces, but then on the back end, you do need to perhaps stitch together the liquidity.
00:46:17.004 - 00:46:46.204, Speaker B: Well, also think about it from not just the good point on the liquidity, but also the user's perspective. I'll keep with the Uber example here. Maybe it's a bad example, but Uber is now layering on the ability to rent a car from Uber. So now you don't have a place to go rent a car. You do it on Uber. You have the ability to deliver groceries on Uber. And so it's like usually these marketplaces end up accumulating more and more, basically verticals instead of disbanding verticals.
00:46:47.744 - 00:47:38.042, Speaker A: I think that that might get hard because there are so many verticals. Like when I think Santiago used the word discoverability and I think that's so important. Like when we think about gaming and all of that. I mean, are there going to be trillions of gaming of nfts? I mean, there's going to be so many of them. And then you're going to, for a specific game that you may be playing, you're going to want to figure out like how much experience does this particular asset have? What kind of, you know, you need to get really granular as to the different powers and attributes of these very specific assets. So I think you almost necessarily need specific verticals. And I could even see where gaming ends up bifurcated into different types of games, like hyper casual games.
00:47:38.042 - 00:47:57.826, Speaker A: You might end up with like one marketplace for those types of assets. You may have first person shooter marketplaces. Like, I think it's going to be that massive. And to have good user experiences and discoverability, I do think you end up with these different vertical. I just think we're so early.
00:47:58.010 - 00:48:43.334, Speaker C: Yeah. And I do agree with you that marketplaces often tend to consolidate and liquidity is in one place. But I do think the differentiation here is that there are kind of significantly different customer segments for different types of NFT. NFT is such a broad term that it covers so many different things. And maybe the better example here is probably an even older example of the graphic of the unbundling of Craigslist, which everything used to be sold through Craigslist, and then you had startups that came out that are specific for different types of services and housing and jobs and community and personals and all of these things that originally you would go to Craigslist for all became hundreds of different startups that are more specialized for these niches. I think that that's what we could see.
00:48:44.594 - 00:49:11.320, Speaker B: For what it's worth, I think it will go that way as well. Like Craigslist was like services and then people were like, oh, wait, there's a lot of kinds of services. And like even Amazon, it's like selling, or not just Amazon, but like selling things online. It was like, oh, there might be one place to like sell goods online or like sell collectibles with eBay, for example. And then it's like, ah, there are a lot of kind of collectibles. So, no, I also think it goes that way. And, and also opensea, for what it's worth.
00:49:11.320 - 00:49:24.792, Speaker B: Like, I don't know if Opensea people listen to this podcast, but like the NFT, even if they fall from 50% to 25%, but if your market grows by 100 x, like they're going to be, I think opensea is going to end up doing pretty damn well. So.
00:49:24.928 - 00:49:29.324, Speaker A: Yeah, and of course they listen. Everybody listens.
00:49:30.904 - 00:50:04.312, Speaker B: Santi and I always joke about having a listener base of one, which is ourselves, but I'm glad to hear there are listeners to this thing. So. All right, Peter, I want to stick with some of the market structure stuff and get away from really good first half of the podcast talking about gaming and nfts, I do want to start talking about trading and more traditional market infrastructure. One of your trading predictions was that Uniswap would overtake Coinbase as Dex spot trading, market share reaches a new all time high. That was the quote. Would love just your overarching thesis for this.
00:50:04.488 - 00:50:56.892, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. So I think that this is going to be the year that we see significant and long overdue market structure changes for crypto trading, and that's going to be a move towards more non custodial wallets. People are actually holding their own crypto or non custodial trading, which is more trading on dexs instead of sexes, and also trading in how the centralized market structure works as well. And we can get into that. But on the Dex versus centralized exchange share, and I think you guys might have already talked about this on a separate podcast as well, but if you look at the share of Dex trading that peaked at about 17% in mid 2020, and then it came down, it's been around ten or so. Certainly think that that is going. It's been rising recently.
00:50:56.892 - 00:51:33.914, Speaker C: I think that that will continue to rise and that will be 20 or 30% this year. As again, more folks look to. They want to hold their own assets, don't want to trade on centralized exchanges, get more comfortable with that. So that is certainly something that we think we will see. And we think that Uniswap will overtake Coinbase on a consistent basis. It has on specific days in the past, had more volume than Coinbase, but has, I would say, overall been catching up to Coinbase, and I think that it will definitively flip coinbase this year on a volume perspective as part of that broader trend moving towards Dex trading.
00:51:34.934 - 00:52:47.944, Speaker D: I guess on this point, I want to get your take on something perhaps more broadly on DeFi, which is how do you see Defi going forward in its existence from a regulatory standpoint? There's this traveling rule, this KYC component, and interacting in, like, pools of capital. The tornado cash situation that happened this year, I thought was, you know, gave people a lot of pause into what does it actually mean to use Uniswap? Uniswap 101, you need the liquidity. If people all of a sudden, if regulators make it really hard to supply capital and be a liquidity provider, then that will really make it impossible for Defi. And so I'm kind of curious to get your take on how this all shapes up as an institution. Like, are you skewing more towards defi? And what do you perhaps need to see from a regular, or what do you think is going to happen from a regulatory perspective, because it sounds like you're bullish on DeFi and decentralized finance versus regulatory arbitrage, stuff like FTX. But I'm curious how that all shapes up in your mind.
00:52:49.554 - 00:52:52.014, Speaker C: Colleen, you want to take the regulatory side of that?
00:52:52.354 - 00:53:10.042, Speaker A: Yeah, I'll take the regulatory side of it. Yeah. I think here is where the disclaimer becomes really important, too, because I think, you know, Peter and I have each been in this industry. Yeah. Big letters, right. Displaying. Can you do flashing bright lights at this part.
00:53:10.042 - 00:54:17.704, Speaker A: Yeah. You know, Peter and I have each been in this space for about nine years, and I think we share the same sort of reason for being here. And that really is just building a system that is inclusive and open to everybody. And so our ethos on DeFi runs deep. Now, as an institution that is heavily regulated in the United States and european and Asia and the Middle east, there are certain things that we can and cannot do because of that regulatory umbrella that sits on top of us. And right now, that does make doing significant activity in DeFi challenging what we think will happen from a regulatory standpoint. There's a couple things, and obviously, my answer is going to be pretty us centric in 2023 for DeFi.
00:54:17.704 - 00:55:01.644, Speaker A: I don't think much will actually happen because we're so polarized. We've got some policymakers far on one end of the spectrum, Brown and Warren and others on the other. So McHenry and Emmer, and I think it's going to be challenging for them to come together and find a framework that works for both sides. And now, obviously, we've got bifurcated House and Senate. So to come up with legislation that's going to pass both chambers in 2023, I think is going to be tough. I think the positive side of that is for DeFi. So it gives DeFi more time to harden and grow and really prove its utility.
00:55:01.644 - 00:55:54.294, Speaker A: So I think that is really important. I think the negative of not getting some kind of framework put in place in 2023 is we really need clarity. I mean, asset classification, not knowing what's a security and what's a commodity is, I mean, really bad for the industry. And we've seen that just, it's bad. And when I think about, you know, what kind of regulation we could end up with for DeFi, you know, there's been a lot of talk about, I think the more benign framework would be regulating the front ends, obviously not the protocols, because you can't regulate them, but could. Uniswap.org Kyc Aml groups using the Uniswap protocol.
00:55:54.294 - 00:56:48.058, Speaker A: But then it is, well, what does that look like? Do they register as a broker dealer, as a registered investment advisor? What is that? I mean, obviously, you would want a framework that is specific to DeFi, but that's going to be challenging to get. What you don't want is any kind of regulation. I think this is where you were going at the beginning of this, saying, like, us registered investment advisors and broker dealers can't touch crypto. Like, that's a problem, right? That is, you know, we can talk all we want about how we can't regulate bitcoin because it's software running autonomously on the Internet. But if something like that happens, that is really bad. You know, I tend to think that we have enough support now politically that we won't end up in a situation like that. That where we probably end up is some kind of front end regulation at some point.
00:56:48.058 - 00:56:50.414, Speaker A: But I don't think it'll be 2023.
00:56:52.674 - 00:57:06.684, Speaker D: What is the. So FTX happened? Do you think that that is. Compresses the timeline to get regulation? Do you think that that is. Do you see that as a positive or negative from a regulatory standpoint in 2023?
00:57:06.804 - 00:57:49.264, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, my answer is going to be a little bit odd because, you know, and if we were back in 2022 and we didn't have a divided house and Senate, I think we would have pretty quick reactive regulation that would get put in place. I think in 2023, it's going to be harder. In theory, FTX should help prove the case for DeFi. Right. I mean, that. And that's where, as an industry, I think, like every day we have to remind ourselves that these systems are not safe yet. They need our protection, which means we need to be talking with regulators and policymakers to help them understand the benefits of DeFi.
00:57:49.264 - 00:57:52.144, Speaker A: But I actually think.
00:57:53.964 - 00:58:07.540, Speaker D: I think you're going to this. Do you actually think that FTX actually has helped regulators and other folks understand the distinction between these decentralized protocols and centralized institutions servicing crypto?
00:58:07.732 - 00:58:38.128, Speaker A: Some. Some. I think some are going to see what they want to see no matter what. The reality is, though, I think some have built up a narrative about what they think crypto is. And even if we explain all day long that the situation with FTX is no different than the situation with Archegos or with Madoff, like a fraud is a fraud, they're still going to see what they want to see. And crypto scares people. It's just scary.
00:58:38.128 - 00:59:01.412, Speaker A: We have the privilege all day of investing and seeing what the future is bringing. It's exciting. Regulators and policymakers only think about the risks. And that's why I think it's so important that we keep trying to bridge that gap and help them see what we get to see all day long. Like this future is really, really bright. Let's think about the opportunity. Risk is one half of the equation.
00:59:01.412 - 00:59:10.866, Speaker A: Opportunity and benefits are the other. So. But I think having a divided house and Senate in 2023 is, is actually.
00:59:10.930 - 01:00:21.814, Speaker D: Going to help us from, not to get too off topic, but, you know, I think from an, just going on this thread a bit more from a fundraising standpoint, you know, you're talking to sovereign wealth funds, other institutions that, you know, just given the brevinhower brand and you carry a lot of weight. At least that's my opinion. And you get to talk to a lot of these folks. Is it, I mean, there's a lot of, like, there's a lot, it could be a lot of noise, right. Because macros like, has put a lot of people on hold because they don't want to take on more risk in their portfolio. But in these conversations, do they, have you felt a shift in tone saying, for the reasons that they don't want to invest in crypto, saying, you know what, this whole FTX thing just further, you know, delays my interest in the, in this sector. Do you think, how big of an impact do you think that is going to have from a fundraising standpoint and getting institutions that have perhaps warmed up to the sector over the last couple of years, but just now may not because of FTX or may, I don't know, I'm curious to get if you've observed a shift recently.
01:00:23.914 - 01:01:31.184, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I would say that the folks that I talk to that are allocators that are seriously looking at allocating to the space they have bought into? Okay. This is a fundamental technological innovation here, and this is going to really have a significant impact on the world and it's something that we should be investing behind. The timing of that, I think has often been impacted by. You have something like FDX happen and folks just want to take some more time to think about things. And that absolutely makes sense and would be expected. But I think a lot of those conversations now, or at least folks that I talk to are kind of what I went back to at the beginning, which is okay, if you believe in this and that you want to be investing in the market, when do you want to be investing? Do you want to be investing at the top of a hype cycle or trough, you obviously want to be investing in the trough. And where we are in that trough, you can't exactly time the market, but it's clear we're somewhere in there now.
01:01:31.184 - 01:01:35.144, Speaker C: So this would be the time to do it.
01:01:36.724 - 01:02:33.628, Speaker D: Brevin Howard made its name with Macro, and so you have a whole side of that you may talk to or interact with, but perhaps you consult them on this. Everyone's now a macro expert on crypto Twitter, but I think you guys are actually incredibly, very smart and some of the best macro thinkers out there. How much of that factors into your thinking in terms of allocating versus getting paid 5% of treasuries? I'm just curious how you guys think about deploying and investing. Maybe it's early stage, doesn't really matter because valuations have come down, but there is a pretty high relative opportunity cost now of taking on risk. And I guess, I guess that's one part of the question. The second one that I'm perhaps more interested in, if you don't answer the first spine, is like, do you think that on a relative base, like the whole narrative is for bitcoin has been, it's a hedge against. It's like a macro hedge, which it hasn't.
01:02:33.628 - 01:03:05.384, Speaker D: And because crypto has never gone through a recession or like it, you know, and now we are in, that feels like. And so do you think that the narrative for bitcoin is dead, meaningfully undermined, given the recent performance? And when allocators come back into the asset class, do you think that the relative percentage of capital that flows into the space just goes directly into something like a tech bet, like ETH or Solana or whatever, and just doesn't even think about bitcoin in their portfolio for digital assets?
01:03:07.024 - 01:03:40.572, Speaker C: Yeah, from my view. So from the macro perspective, I think being at a place like Revin, there's a lot of brilliant macro folks here. It's great to get that insight. Our investments are, as you mentioned, largely early stage. So it's not like we're trying to time the market and we're looking for great founders and great companies. And the macro outlook at the moment doesn't really impact that too much. Maybe it impacts timing of deployment of capital a little bit and those types of things, but I would say not a huge impact.
01:03:40.572 - 01:04:20.054, Speaker C: From my perspective. The bitcoin narrative question, I think is really good one. What is that narrative going forward? I believe that this year, the outside money narrative for bitcoin is really going to reemerge and that is that most money in the world, it's inside money. It's inside the. The banking system, specifically the US banking system. And if you are, the US can seize that money. At the end of the day, if you're Afghanistan or Russia or whoever you might be, you don't really own those assets.
01:04:20.054 - 01:04:47.928, Speaker C: It's subject to the whims of somebody else. So there's, I think, going to be increasing demand around the world for a lot of reasons. For outside money, things like bitcoin, gold, commodities. That was something that earlier last year, I think, got some interest from a narrative perspective. I think that that will come back this year. And I think it is an interesting narrative for bitcoin. I think at the end of the day, bitcoin is a better gold.
01:04:47.928 - 01:05:07.294, Speaker C: I think that that is the winning narrative for bitcoin. ETH could somewhat fall in that category as well. Bitcoin's a pure play on that belief. ETH is more of a tech bet. Yeah, those are my thoughts on that one, Pauline?
01:05:07.994 - 01:06:04.344, Speaker A: Oh, I largely agree with Peter, and I think you got to throw bitcoin some love. It's his 14th birthday from launch day today, so we've got to, like. No, I mean, I agree quite a bit. And I think also, you know, I agree with everything he said. And I do think when institutions do, financial institutions and others, when they come back into this space, I do think that it's going to be interesting, the timing. Have we made any progress on the regulatory asset classification side of things? And is the SEC increasingly aggressive on enforcement as to what is and is not security? And is that almost forced, if you're going to go into one, does that almost force you into bitcoin? Because it really is the only asset that enjoys, like, a pristine regulatory moat. Ethereum should be in that category.
01:06:04.344 - 01:06:27.684, Speaker A: But of course, we've heard, like, rumblings, you know, back and forth. Is it. Is it not a security? I think the fact that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange has issued Ethereum based products should put it in the commodity camp. But nonetheless, it's like, I do think that that continues to be a factor. Like, what can institutions actually invest in from a regulatory standpoint, assuming they're heavily regulated and conservative?
01:06:28.224 - 01:06:34.896, Speaker D: I want to do three firearm questions on regulation, and then we can move on. One is, so if you could entertain that, that'd be great.
01:06:34.960 - 01:06:37.552, Speaker B: It's always terrifying when Santi throws out the regulation.
01:06:37.688 - 01:06:42.964, Speaker A: I'm like, I'm really afraid here. I'm going to do my best. We need more disclaimers here. Santiago.
01:06:43.614 - 01:06:53.594, Speaker D: Trust me, we'll make all the decisions. One, do you. Do we see another El Salvador this year, like legal tender for bitcoin or.
01:06:53.934 - 01:06:54.754, Speaker A: Yes.
01:06:56.014 - 01:06:59.134, Speaker D: Is it a developed or developing country?
01:06:59.254 - 01:07:00.234, Speaker A: Developing.
01:07:00.614 - 01:07:03.114, Speaker D: Okay. Like a Peru or Mexico?
01:07:03.814 - 01:07:15.114, Speaker C: I think a lot more we might see that. I think more impactful than legal tender laws are central banks accumulating bitcoin or ETH. And I think. I don't know if we'll see it this year, which they might have already, but they're not.
01:07:15.274 - 01:07:17.094, Speaker D: And you think they'll be public about it?
01:07:17.954 - 01:07:23.614, Speaker C: I think at first it won't be public. I think it could be happening now. I think it's likely happening now, but they're not public about it.
01:07:24.594 - 01:07:47.914, Speaker D: I mean, yeah, Russia has sort of intimated that they want to settle with bitcoin, and that could have a whole host of issues, but I won't even get there. That's not a firearm question. I guess I was going to ask more on a relative basis. You talk about the US being pretty divided. Do we see a big regulatory action, good or bad, from, you know, in the UK or the European Union, that then the US adopts as a framework?
01:07:48.334 - 01:07:52.634, Speaker A: That's a really great question. Do I have to do yes or no?
01:07:53.534 - 01:07:56.318, Speaker D: No. You could sort of, like, expand on it.
01:07:56.366 - 01:08:44.124, Speaker A: Because, I mean, I think historically, you know, I've always thought that the US kind of sets the framework and then other countries follow, and I think it might be getting to the point where we see other developed countries. So what's happening in Europe, UK start to become what sets the standard on things like asset classification and how to handle that, where the US ends up actually following the frameworks that have been set elsewhere. I think crypto may be what actually shifts that. I don't think historically we've really seen that.
01:08:44.704 - 01:09:01.126, Speaker D: On the ETF side. I think it was like the gold ETF. I mean, you might know the history well, but it was like, I think in the UK, the US dragged its feet and the UK kind of approved that, and then the US adopted that. On the financial innovation side, I think it's been your Europe has been a little bit more cutting edge. Maybe the last one. Bonus question. Do we have a major.
01:09:01.126 - 01:09:12.046, Speaker D: A major insolvency collapse this year that we haven't seen? And if so, where do you think that comes from? Because it felt like all the dominoes will fell at this point. Maybe binance.
01:09:12.190 - 01:09:13.514, Speaker A: Peter, that one's you.
01:09:14.614 - 01:09:20.582, Speaker C: I'm off the regulatory hot seat, major. I don't think so.
01:09:20.638 - 01:09:24.482, Speaker D: Like, I don't think maybe more specifically, tether and binance.
01:09:24.578 - 01:09:40.174, Speaker C: Tether and binance? I don't think so. I think there's going to be continued aftershocks of the FTX thing that folks are going to go out of business. I don't know for sure, but I would be surprised if there was binance or tether issues.
01:09:40.514 - 01:09:44.414, Speaker B: Do you think we see any major tier one crypto venture firms go down?
01:09:45.314 - 01:09:46.454, Speaker D: Oh, that's good.
01:09:49.334 - 01:09:50.474, Speaker C: Depends what you think.
01:09:53.854 - 01:10:01.274, Speaker D: I guess if it goes down, it's not a tier one, but, you know, in terms of, like a big one, like a greater than three, four or 500 million in Aum.
01:10:01.934 - 01:10:25.894, Speaker C: I don't know. I think that there are. There's probably a number of funds that are in a tough spot because they're down so deeply, and we'll need to make some tough decisions on, do they carry on? Do they try to claw their way back? Do they start a new fund? Do they know, how do they manage that situation? So I think we're going to see probably some changes just because of the dynamics that you get yourself into. If you're a fund and you're down.
01:10:25.974 - 01:10:31.234, Speaker D: 80%, I guess it's fine. I want to keep going. Does Coinbase get acquired?
01:10:32.934 - 01:10:41.234, Speaker C: Reasonable chance of that? I think that that could be a very attractive asset for a large financial institution.
01:10:42.274 - 01:11:06.494, Speaker B: Will, let me piggyback on the Coinbase question. Will coinbase, this is actually one of your predictions that. I thought this was a really interesting prediction, that custody and settlement are going to have to separate. Like right now. Exchanges and crypto are not actually just exchanges. They're exchanges plus brokerage, plus custodians, plus clearing and settlement houses. Do you think that Coinbase will be forced to separate these sides of their business?
01:11:06.954 - 01:11:37.398, Speaker C: No, not Coinbase. Coinbase will continue to operate altogether. I think it works well for Coinbase. It's one of the few places that it works well generally, as you mentioned, this is a weird, or it's a different market structure. Traditionally, you don't have a brokerage and exchange and a settlement agent altogether in one entity. Crypto grew up that way because there wasn't third parties to do it. When Coinbase started, they needed to do this themselves.
01:11:37.398 - 01:12:17.950, Speaker C: I think it works at a place like Coinbase because they're a trusted custodian, they're a trusted exchange. You can trust them to do all these things, in my view. There are lots of exchanges where traders, market makers, trade on. They don't want to have their assets there, and they haven't wanted to have their assets there. For years, but they have put their assets there because that's been how you make money is you trade on these other exchanges. That's always been something that for years me and Colleen have been talking about this. Traders, market makers, have been pushing for, we don't want to hold our assets on the exchange.
01:12:17.950 - 01:12:40.586, Speaker C: We want to hold them with a trusted custodian or ourselves, more likely a third party custodian. You give us credit on the exchange for it, we all settle at the custodian. That is a typical market structure, and that is what traders would like. It's way less risk. It's more capital efficient. There's just a lot of benefits from having that type of market structure. Historically, exchanges have basically said no.
01:12:40.586 - 01:13:11.044, Speaker C: If you want to trade on our exchange, give us your coins, give us your cash. And traders have consented to that post FTX that is finally trade changing where traders are saying no. If you want our volume, you want our liquidity. We're going to hold it at Fireblocks, we're going to hold it at Bitco, we're going to hold it at copper, and you're going to give us credit for it, and we're going to settle at the custodian. If you won't sign up for that, we're out this year. The line is getting drawn on that, and that is going to make market structure change.
01:13:12.864 - 01:13:42.744, Speaker D: On this piece. I guess you guys are active traders. You have a whole component that is building really interesting infrastructure. We've seen liquidity really dry up in crypto, especially for tail end assets. Who do you think fills that void? I mean, we've talked about Defi perhaps, but I'm curious, like, do you think that we'll see the rise and someone really come in and fill that gap? And where is that going to come from? Or liquidity? Is liquidity going to be really an issue in 2023?
01:13:42.864 - 01:14:40.104, Speaker C: I think markets will be less liquid in 2023 because market makers have pulled back for good reasons. It creates an opportunity, I think, for new players to enter the space that maybe wasn't there before to play in some of these spots and some of these assets that the vigorous players don't want to play in, perhaps. I think that we're in a spot right now where I think everybody's got to pull back for good reason. Folks are going to lean forward, I think more as the year goes on, and we're also probably going to see some new entrants come into the space to fill some of those gaps. I think we're going to see that from a trading perspective. I think we're going to see that from a lending perspective. I think a lot of these places where people have gotten burned, that's when new opportunities arise for folks to come in and do it, have better risk management and do those types of things by doing it in a better way.
01:14:41.714 - 01:15:32.396, Speaker D: This is a question for both of you, and it's not a fly around question. It's more just kind of thinking about everything that we've talked about so far, which is what do you think are going to be the biggest narratives of the year? I mean, we've talked about gaming nfts. I'm thinking more from the lens of like last cycle. It was really defi that got started, the kind of the bull run and then that extended into nfts, but it was really kind of the compound like launching this equity mining program that got everything on high gear. What is that one? Do you think that we'll see that kind of phenomenon in 2023 or what happens in terms of maybe not in 2023, but what do you think are going to be the biggest narratives this year, whether we are in a backing and up only market or not?
01:15:32.500 - 01:16:12.094, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't know if we'll have that moment in 2023. I hope we do. I think it could come from a few different places. I think you could have a really good web3 game that goes viral. It's actually really fun to play and has assets NFTs in it that people truly own and that could go viral and attract a lot of new users. I think you could have branded goods that come in that there's just some really cool existing brand or a new web3 native brand that people just get really excited about the brand and they want to be part of it and they want to own the assets and that could kick things off again. I think the payments narrative is never going to be something that gets really hot.
01:16:12.094 - 01:16:34.082, Speaker C: It's just going to be slow adoption in the background and slowly changes the way the money moves across the world. But it's not going to kick off excitement in the market per se. But those would be things around gaming or branded goods would be my guess on it. If we have that moment, Colleen, you probably have better perspective.
01:16:34.258 - 01:17:34.770, Speaker A: No, I mean, obviously that's where I spend the vast majority of my time and that's where I do tend to think we'll continue to make progress in 2023. The way I think about it is to me, Defi Summer was so crypto native. Obviously we brought in non crypto people but it really was crypto native and it was complicated unless you were sort of in the weeds of it. Right. You know, I remember that somewhere so vividly, like, just, you know, everything you had to, like, learn by doing and really, like, make a lot of mistakes and figure it out. And I think and sort of hope that where we're moving to in 2023 is that we're starting to abstract away some of those complexities where it's just easier and easier for people to come into this space where we almost don't even know if it's going to be like an NFT summer or a DeFi summer. Like, it'll just be, people are just using this stuff because it's making their lives better.
01:17:34.770 - 01:18:28.770, Speaker A: Like, that's really my hope for 2023. And I do think we're starting to see that, like, actual avenues of monetization that are real and net new and enhancing, you know, and I do like the word enhancing. Like, when I think about gaming, like, you know, Peter and I aren't at the place where we're looking to invest in, like, games being built 100% on chain with the decentralized game engine like that, that's not where we are. Do we hope we get there in ten years? Yeah, that'd be great. But I mean, I think it's like these sort of baby steps where we're going to have this conversation a year from now, and hopefully we're going to look back at 2023 and say, like, all these incremental steps really added up to something significant. That's what I hope in 2023. So it may not be like a big thing, but just like, you keep getting there.
01:18:28.922 - 01:18:55.106, Speaker C: I completely agree with that. I think that the, like, how do you get the next billion people or a huge amount of people into crypto, onboard them into crypto is that you don't. You don't onboard them into crypto. Crypto powers things that they want to do. Like they want to play great games. They want to buy, you know, digital items online that resonate with them in some way. They want to move money around the world and pay people seamlessly or save in dollars or those types of things.
01:18:55.106 - 01:19:13.214, Speaker C: And crypto is behind all of those services and enables them to do those things in a better way. But they don't identify themselves as web3 people or crypto people or onboarding to crypto. They're just, they're using services that happen to use crypto in the backend. And I think that that's a lot of what we're going to see this year.
01:19:17.954 - 01:19:53.164, Speaker B: I have two defi questions, and then we can start to think about wrapping this up. One is, do you think we'll see a tier one defi application, like, let's say, uniswap compound aave someone like that? Lean into the app chain thesis and move onto their own app, or build. Build their own app, or, excuse me, build their own chain. Uniswap being the obvious one here, I can never tell if you guys know something that you're not supposed to say publicly, which is, I'm assuming, what it is when you don't answer me.
01:19:54.744 - 01:20:39.842, Speaker C: I don't think for uniswap. I think that they've come out and said that they don't plan to actually do that. Will we see it for one of the more blue chips Defi protocols? I think, like, I mean, by DX is doing that. So I don't know if you consider them to be in that category, but you know that they're leading the way in doing that. Will we see more folks do that and say, hey, I'm gonna have an app chain. I can control more of the value capture by doing that? I think probably, I would say, in general, we are less excited about the app chain thesis than I think, a lot of VC's. Um, but we'll probably see some of that.
01:20:40.018 - 01:20:58.242, Speaker B: Yeah, I think my last one, and then we can throw back to Santi to close this up, is, um. Uh, one of the narratives that drove Defi was that you could get high yields in Defi. Now, that's kind of flipped on its head, right? I can actually get a higher yield through. Through my. Like, through a rob, through putting money on, like, parking money on Wealthfront or Robin Hood. I can get, like, 4% treasuries.
01:20:58.338 - 01:20:58.546, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:20:58.570 - 01:21:19.474, Speaker B: And through treasuries. Exactly. Will we be able to get access to the yield that comes from the ten year in DeFi in 2023? And if so, does that drive? I don't know if these are related questions. In my mind, they are. But will that drive this permissioned DeFi use case?
01:21:20.054 - 01:21:44.834, Speaker C: I don't know. How do you bring treasuries into DeFi or that type of yield into defi? At that point, I kind of start to question, like, what are you solving for? If you want treasury yields, go buy treasuries. You don't need the DeFi part of it. I do think that there's an interesting market opportunity right now for a fintech to just make it easy to buy treasuries for millennials and Gen Z completely.
01:21:45.134 - 01:21:54.510, Speaker B: Well, there's also a nice arbitrary, there's also a nice arbitrage going on which, like, you can borrow in DeFi and then just buy the ten year right now, which you got to imagine that gap closer.
01:21:54.542 - 01:22:01.302, Speaker D: Can't really borrow, can't be both fixed in scale or efficiently fixed term. So that makes it difficult.
01:22:01.398 - 01:22:02.234, Speaker B: That's true.
01:22:02.814 - 01:22:13.634, Speaker C: But yeah, yeah, there you really are being your own bank. You're borrowing short, lending long. That's a bank, all right. Yeah, but the, like, the yield.
01:22:15.574 - 01:22:15.814, Speaker A: I.
01:22:15.814 - 01:22:43.824, Speaker C: Don'T know if I am excited long term, like the crypto credit market and lending in Defi. I do think it's really interesting because it does create a whole new way for capital to move across the world, from folks that have capital to those that need capital in ways that I think is more open and can be more efficient than the current system. But right now, that market, as you mentioned, yields are really low. It's not really very attractive.
01:22:47.504 - 01:23:49.694, Speaker D: So I think this has been a fascinating discussion. I still remember when we met right before the tarot was going down the summer, and I think things have happened, more things have happened. So I think it's really hard to predict things that happen in crypto, but I think creating predictions is still a useful exercise to go back and think about why you came up with those predictions. So I guess I have two closing questions. Like, one, as it relates to this art of coming up with predictions, I'm curious where you guys have historically been very wrong in terms of if you look, for instance, at the predictions that you did in 2022 or 2021 or historically maybe for listeners to understand what kind of goes into this process to that your predictions were very good in terms of where have you, looking back, where have you, like, made the biggest mistakes or what is that has, like, surprised you the most? I guess I don't know if that makes sense.
01:23:50.434 - 01:24:44.590, Speaker A: Well, I know one area for me for sure is, like, the institutions are coming. I mean, I think once I really understood the power of bitcoin, because that's, of course, where, you know, everything started for me. It's like you think everybody's just going to get it and be in the space. Like, I just, I really expected adoption to be much quicker, especially with financial institutions coming into the space. I also think one area where I was naive in the beginning was not appreciating that when you are creating technology around money, you're causing a lot of fear. And I think that it's very different than the Internet. Right.
01:24:44.590 - 01:25:50.272, Speaker A: And opening up information. When you're doing this with money, things just take longer. I mean, we are living what a unique period of time we're living in and working in this industry, rewriting how money works. And I think where I just have sort of constantly missed a little bit is just the time it takes for adoption if I look back on things. But I think, you know, coming up with predictions, you know, anytime you have to sort of put pen to paper and challenge what you think, I think is always a useful exercise. Like can you support what you think is going to happen with data? Or like, even when I think about gaming and brands, like, where I constantly would push myself is how, how does this make the consumer life better and how do brands and gaming companies make money? Like, both those sides have to work for this thesis to be valid and for these predictions to actually come true. And it's actually not a very easy exercise.
01:25:50.272 - 01:26:01.954, Speaker A: Like, you really have to read a lot and think a lot and write a lot and throw things away. But I think where I've gotten it wrong over time is just how much time it takes to build.
01:26:04.414 - 01:26:08.834, Speaker C: Peter yeah, I think historically I was just trying to look back at some of my predictions.
01:26:09.974 - 01:26:11.154, Speaker A: Peter gets pretty.
01:26:12.894 - 01:26:57.680, Speaker C: I like to say my track record is pretty good. Historically, 20 and 2021, I think they were quite good. 2022 was less good. I was too bullish, like a lot of people coming into 2022. I think where I have gotten things wrong, one is the speed that things move. I think that often things just take a little bit longer than you think or hope they will, especially when you're dealing with institutions, for example. I would say the second is maybe getting caught up in like what is the kind of the hot thing of the moment that people are like everyone is excited about or maybe things that you've made an investment in that you want to happen.
01:26:57.680 - 01:27:29.584, Speaker C: But maybe isn't really the right theme. And I think that where I've generally gotten things right is where you come back to the first principles of, like why these things matter and what is the impact that they can have and where does the data show that actually starting to happen and like, that, I think is like that more first principles type thinking, I think is generally where I've gotten things more, right.
01:27:31.884 - 01:27:57.924, Speaker D: Yeah, definitely. My last question is, and feel free to pick the order because it might influence your answer depending on who goes first, which is what are some of the things that you disagree with the most, both of you, as you think about when you're making investments or thinking about your worldview, what are some of the things that you constantly or really disagree with in your crypto worldview.
01:28:00.224 - 01:28:04.444, Speaker C: That we disagree with each other with or disagree with the broader consensus?
01:28:05.714 - 01:28:06.434, Speaker B: Great.
01:28:06.594 - 01:28:19.294, Speaker D: I actually would want to know both. But perhaps starting with where Peter and Colleen, where you don't agree with, and then where you perhaps have a very specific view that the crypto world doesn't agree with.
01:28:20.154 - 01:28:52.954, Speaker A: Okay, I'll start. And then Peter can tell you all the things where he thinks I'm insane. But, I mean, part of the reason I feel so grateful to have Peter as a partner, because I think investing in crypto is actually pretty hard. I don't think it's easy. And I really do feel if I can't convince Peter that this is a good investment, then I shouldn't do it. I really believe that. I trust his judgment so much.
01:28:52.954 - 01:29:39.374, Speaker A: And as you can tell from this conversation, we tend to focus on different areas. And I think that's really healthy, because if I can't pull Peter along or if he's not engaged or doesn't see merit, then I usually tend to think I'm probably missing something, and I need to look at that harder. To me, that's the value of having a true partner. So I don't like, I really, truly can't think of areas where I disagree with Peter. I mean, we definitely have healthy conversations and, you know, and we see things in different ways, but it's kind of like that combination that I think makes us better together. I know, certainly. Than I am separate.
01:29:42.314 - 01:30:20.734, Speaker C: Yeah, I would totally agree with that. I think that me and Cleen are really good compliments, and that's why I came over to Brevin to work with her in that we certainly have different interests. A lot of our interests also overlap, but we look at things in slightly different ways. And I think that we broadly have, we're typically in agreement on the broad themes, and then it's the kind of the nuances within that, and we have really good discussions on. And the same thing. Like, if I can't convince Colleen something that is a good idea, it's probably not a good idea, and it's a good kind of check on my thinking in terms of.
01:30:21.034 - 01:30:36.694, Speaker D: I mean, we've discussed a lot of predictions here, but just, they don't have to relate to this. But where do you think that the crypto market or generally the world doesn't agree with particular things? This is sort of the thing that. What do you believe in now that others don't but will at some point?
01:30:38.954 - 01:31:40.204, Speaker A: I mean, you know, I think we all, like, have the reason, like, I mean, if 2022 didn't test us on, like, why we're in this space and why we're staying in this space, I don't really know what will. And the way I tend to think about things. And again, it's like all these steps along the way, like, you know, I firmly believe, like, we're going to get to a place where everybody, through this technology, has an opportunity to create wealth and generate wealth for themselves. And just a tiny example, like, in the context of gaming, you take a company like Roblox. 100% of its value is generated by the creators on that platform. The first time they could participate and generate wealth through Roblox was when it went public at 41 billion. Like, that doesn't make any sense.
01:31:40.204 - 01:32:23.174, Speaker A: And I think, and this is fraught with regulatory risk right now, but we will eventually get to a place where we open up these systems so that the people that create value can also generate wealth for themselves along the way. And I think that's like the power of building open systems that everybody can access. So I feel like that's the thing that I see, but I don't know how long it's going to take us to get there. But I feel like that's like, if I have a secret, like, hey, I know, like, someday, like, you know, this kid in a stroller, like, you're going to generate wealth through these open systems that we're working so hard to build and protect and nurture. Like, that's what.
01:32:23.714 - 01:33:06.858, Speaker D: Yeah, before Peter goes, it's sort of like a lot of people now are questioning, rightfully so, like, what does this all matter? What are the actual tangible use cases beyond this being a 2024 7365 casino? And it's like, well, go talk to an artist. And I compare that to what? Like Sotheby's and Christie's, like, rips them off with and the ability to access the distribution network of the Internet to sell their art without having to go through a gallery and or someone that can monetize their content much better than what YouTube is extracting. And so anytime you kind of see that, it's sort of a force that once you see that, you don't go back. Once you transfer a stable coin. Yeah, it can be hard. You think about security and all these things. But if you extract, like, the use cases is there is real, whether people want to see it or not.
01:33:06.858 - 01:33:25.174, Speaker D: But, you know, the creators certainly have appreciated that. If you look at NFTs and gamers will certainly appreciate that, you know, people forget that some of the best builders in the space have had bad experiences in gaming. None, starting with Vitalik. But yeah, definitely agree with that. But Peter?
01:33:26.034 - 01:34:20.644, Speaker C: Yeah. As far as what I believe that others don't believe, I think that a lot of the maybe things I believe became more consensus over the last couple of years, I would say right now I would say it's the scale that I believe these things will go to and the conviction that I have that they will reach that scale. I am absolutely certain that I shouldn't say absolutely certain. I have a high degree of confidence that stable coins are going to be a double digit trillion dollar market. Thats going to be the new euro dollar market, that digital goods that you actually own, NFTs will be a larger market than physical goods sales, that central banks will hold digital assets, they will hold bitcoin and ETH. These are things that I think are fairly inevitable. I think that is maybe a non conviction belief that I don't think that these are likely to happen.
01:34:20.644 - 01:34:23.980, Speaker C: I think that these are inevitable things that will happen.
01:34:24.132 - 01:34:27.820, Speaker D: I think I could get more bullish, but this may be even more bullish. Yeah.
01:34:28.012 - 01:34:42.344, Speaker B: No. Colleen and Peter, this is a great start to the year and I think Santi and I both share in your optimism for the year and the optimists usually win in life. So I'm glad to see you guys are staying optimistic and yeah, this was an amazing chat.
01:34:42.644 - 01:35:42.934, Speaker D: Yeah, I'm really happy both of you came on. I mean, obviously you guys have done incredible work and it's been largely in the background. And so I know I've pushed you and Melanie and others in your team to say you got to be more public about all the great stuff that is happening because it's really nice to see someone like Brevin or Alan Brevin Howard move into the space because I can't think of an institution of that size reputation to really just, you know, you certainly have like Paul Tudor Jones and, you know, Soros and a few other like, big guys that come into the space. But I don't think it's been to the level of commitment in terms of not just investing but also building. And I think there was for people that want to learn a little bit more because Alan's been, you know, he's sort of in the background. He's not a very public guy. But there's a great, I thought was a great financial Times profile on Alan and what and his vision and your team's vision on, on digital assets, crypto and the industry, and so maybe we'll link it to the show notes.
01:35:42.934 - 01:36:00.914, Speaker D: But it's great to see you guys come out and be more public about your strategy and your conviction in the space, which seems like not really going away or unwaving, especially in spite of everything that's going on. So it's great to see that. And thank you both for coming on the show. I'm sure listeners will appreciate that.
01:36:01.614 - 01:36:28.834, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks so much for having us. It's been a lot of fun. I feel like it's, you know, we're obviously friends with you guys as well as, you know, being on here. And it's when I think about everything we've all been through and I think about people like you guys, like, it's, you know, that's equally the reason to be here and to stick around like, it's such great people, I think. So thank you for all the work you guys do. I know that I look forward to running.
01:36:30.414 - 01:36:31.434, Speaker D: There we go.
01:36:31.934 - 01:36:38.476, Speaker C: It's your guys'. Weekly. You know, listen to you guys every week. That's what keeps us going. So we appreciate it.
01:36:38.580 - 01:36:40.828, Speaker B: Now you can listen to yourself. Yeah. Listen to your own voice.
01:36:40.876 - 01:36:58.604, Speaker D: Yeah. Well, we'll have to have you guys back on before the end of the year so we can compare how these predictions shaped up. But what's I'm sure this year will be crypto is always great entertainment value. So, you know, we'll have to have you guys back on later on in the year to talk about this.
01:36:58.724 - 01:37:00.084, Speaker B: Colleen, Peter, thanks so much, guys.
