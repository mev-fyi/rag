And you know, on the founder side of things, like, we've all been kind of handicapped by what, by what we can do in this industry. And I think that's like the, that kind of power is about to get unleashed.
00:00:17.305 - 00:00:33.905, Speaker B: This can actually be way bigger than 10 trillion or way bigger than digital. Like a gold market cap. Yeah. How much value do you think could settle on the fucking Internet? How big do you think that is? You mean like that's not 10 trillion? It's hard. I hate to break it. It's way, way bigger than that.

00:02:45.625 - 00:02:46.937, Speaker B: God feels good.
00:02:47.081 - 00:02:49.833, Speaker A: Trump wins and you go to Hawaii, huh? Or am I not supposed to?
00:02:49.929 - 00:02:50.967, Speaker C: We can actually wrap this.
00:02:51.001 - 00:03:01.507, Speaker B: Oh, too late for that. I am. I am still in America. The land of the brave, the home of the free. Or what is it? The home of the free, the land of the brave.
00:03:01.651 - 00:03:03.107, Speaker A: Close. Yeah, close.
00:03:03.291 - 00:03:10.295, Speaker B: God, feels good. The probability of me moving back just goes up, like, through the roof. I love this country.
00:03:11.275 - 00:03:20.547, Speaker A: Wow, we got a new Santu today. Man, what a crazy week, huh? First off, how's the marathon? I got to do the friendly.
00:03:20.651 - 00:03:34.751, Speaker B: No, no, none of this is about the marathon is an afterthought. I'm like, I don't. It didn't even. I wasn't even thinking about the marathon. I was thinking about the fond. I'm thinking about, like, the election. But honestly, like, what a great week.
00:03:34.751 - 00:04:03.029, Speaker B: I mean, I've been sleeping so much better. You are. Before this, recording this, you said, I Woke up at 5 in the morning blasting EDM of each of music. I mean, I, I gotta think that most people in the industry are feeling a combination of euphoria and such a relief because, I mean, it's. When you think and look back. Yeah, it's, it's, it just. It's been tough.
00:04:03.029 - 00:04:25.035, Speaker B: It's been really tough to, like, feel like you're, you know, you don't feel comfortable telling people about the space. It feels, like, dirty to say that you're in crypto. Forget about the bear market. It just feels now it's like, God feels great to have someone that actually believes in this. And I don't know, it was a landslide win. So let's. Should we just unpack the election?
00:04:25.935 - 00:04:33.927, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, let's. Let's unpack it. And, And I would focus on. Yeah, yeah, let's unpack it. I'd be curious to get your general takes.
00:04:34.111 - 00:04:36.743, Speaker B: Well, I was going to lean on you because you're the political expert.
00:04:36.919 - 00:05:14.967, Speaker A: I mean, look, we. I just finished our monthly kickoff and what we said to the. What Mike and I said to the company is, you know, there's. There's two ways to talk about this election. There is the societal element of Republicans versus Democrats and Trump versus Harris and the societal impact and the economy and taxes and abortion and immigration. And, you know, I don't think that stuff really should enter into the workplace. I think companies are better when they're focused on their mission and their vision and making an impact on the world through those things.
00:05:14.967 - 00:05:51.705, Speaker A: And so I, You Know, on the kickoff we said, look, I think it's important right now to have, there are, there are a lot of people who are really happy, there are a lot of people who are really upset and it's important to have empathy for both sides. That being said, there's another way to talk about this, which is just from the light of the impact on the industry and the impact on, I mean we're, we had our, it was our all hands. So the impact on the company. And it was, I mean, it's about as good as it can get, I will say so. I mean, it's only been 20 less than, you know, it's been 36 hours since the election and what, Bitcoin shot up 7% overnight. It was actually interesting. It wasn't even overnight.
00:05:51.705 - 00:05:56.385, Speaker A: It was when the market started to realize that Trump was going to win.
00:05:56.505 - 00:06:09.393, Speaker B: Which was the odds of market went from when the odds of polymarket. It always was a direct movement with the odds of polymarket going from like high 50s all the way to 69 or 60 and then 70. Like you could just, the market was just moving in line with us.
00:06:09.529 - 00:06:53.131, Speaker A: So it was really interesting. So I'm from California, I'm from San Francisco, so I've got a group chat with my high school friends who are all pretty liberal. Then I've got, then I was watching MSNBC and like flipping between cnn, MSNBC and Fox and just seeing how the different channels were covering it. Then Twitter and then Polymarket and these things. You know, you would think that these things would all be kind of in line or kind of similar with maybe a lag. But the market realized basically poly market and the market moved to Trump like a solid two to three hours before media did. And before, you know, my group chat from home with, you know, fairly liberal friends moved to that conclusion.
00:06:53.131 - 00:07:09.117, Speaker A: And so, yeah, I mean, look, the market's telling us what it thinks. Bitcoin went up 7% all time high. Coinbase shot up like 20%. I hope you bought that coinbase when we had breakfast. And yeah, it's just like you saw.
00:07:09.141 - 00:07:11.265, Speaker B: Me confirm the trade on the phone.
00:07:13.165 - 00:07:39.073, Speaker A: But I mean, zooming out for a second, we have operated in an industry where for the first decade of the industry it wasn't partisan nor bipartisan. It wasn't like people didn't like us or liked us. Nobody cared about us. So first 10 years of the industry, nobody really cared about us. But the last several years we have operated as in an industry where people didn't like us. Right. Whether it was this recent administration.
00:07:39.073 - 00:08:29.109, Speaker A: But even people forget when Trump in 2016-2020, he didn't like crypto either. So for the last eight years, we've tried to build this industry with a political administration and House and Senate and kind of that side of things, just not liking us, just making it much harder to build and to invest in this industry. And so I think what's going to be really interesting to see and really fun to see is what happens when you let founders and entrepreneurs operate to the full extent of what they think that they can do. And you know, on the founder side of things, like, we've all been kind of handicapped by what, by what we can do in this industry. And I think that's like the, that kind of power is about to get unleashed.
00:08:29.277 - 00:08:59.845, Speaker B: Absolutely. I mean, there's a couple of things to unpack. Brian Armstrong had a great treat, great tweet says welcome to the new members of America's most pro crypto Congress ever. 219/pro crypto candidates and counting have now been elected to the House and the Senate. Tonight, the crypto voter has spoken decisively across party lines and in key races across the country. Americans disproportionately care about crypto and want clear rules of the road for digital assets. We look forward to working with the new Congress to deliver it.
00:08:59.845 - 00:09:06.593, Speaker B: This was a day ago, so the full tally was not counted, but nonetheless.
00:09:06.769 - 00:09:10.111, Speaker A: It is now up to over 250 folks.
00:09:10.273 - 00:10:00.701, Speaker B: And yes, which to me, that, that candidly is probably more impactful from a legit. Because when I think about to your point around what's been handicapping the industry is we don't have clear rules and regulations. And so a lot of resources have been focused on trying to get that. Every team that I've invested in spends at least 10 cents on every dollar that they raise on sort of legal advice and forget about the things that they haven't done or the, you know, the design space that hasn't been explored because there's just things that we haven't, not because we don't have the imagination to innovate, but it's just, you just don't know. You just don't go there. And so I think it's, it's going to be really exciting to see that of course, now it puts a lot of emphasis on delivering and executing at the project level. You know, I think that's another point that I wanted to make.
00:10:00.701 - 00:10:32.493, Speaker B: It's great. You know, it might take a little bit of time, but if you're a founder in the space then accelerate. Right now it's fully on you to build, to execute and I think that's really liberating. But yeah, the other thing I want to point out is polymarket. Amazing what they've done. I think I had the privilege of meeting Shane very early on in his journey invested when I was a Parify. Parify has become one of his key partners.
00:10:32.493 - 00:11:06.265, Speaker B: But it's just been amazing to see how Poly Market has become the news. And that was the thesis back then. You know, the prediction markets, you know, surface the truth and our highest, higher signals when you put money on the line. And it was very interesting to see. I mean I think they had a great tweet to the effect of Corp, you know, like the office meme, which is corporate wants you to identify differences in the two images. And it was Polymarket's October 24 prediction of the election outcome and the real outcome. And it was like the same, it's like the same picture.
00:11:06.265 - 00:11:43.157, Speaker B: And I think that just goes to show how powerful that was because everyone got it wrong. Like I was tuning in on even Bloomberg's of the world. They got it wrong either they have a lot of bias because they spin on one side. They're either very pro liberal and they don't like to report things as they are. But now we have what is a more credible source of truth in real time combined with Twitter being owned by Elon, which is surfacing a lot of these insights. And so I think that was just very, very powerful to see. It was also the fact that it didn't go down.
00:11:43.157 - 00:12:15.719, Speaker B: You know, it's pretty amazing as well. There's a lot of volume on the line and I think it was very, very good to see that. I mean, I think again, yet another crypto application that is providing a lot of utility. We talk about stablecoins a lot. Prediction markets for this election were essential. So shout out to Shane and the entire Polymarket team for just becoming so embedded in the election and really showcasing yet another use case for crypto that is really useful for people. So that was, that's pretty awesome to see.
00:12:15.847 - 00:12:36.383, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean the success of Polymarket then, I mean Robinhood just launched prediction markets as well. Like this is, you know, I was watching flipping between, like I said, msnbc, CNN and Fox and Fox was, I mean Fox basically turned, turned off their coverage for a little bit and was just showing Poly Market like, yeah, you.
00:12:36.399 - 00:12:37.555, Speaker C: Know, one of the real.
00:12:38.295 - 00:13:29.925, Speaker A: I've really fought this, what I'm about to say for years because I'm A real believer in media. I'm a real believer in journalism and strong reporting and I probably underweight the impact that polymarket and Twitter has on the world. And I have for the last couple of years because I'm a real believer in media. With that caveat, one of the biggest losers of this election is mainstream media. Mainstream media. Just, you know, if you don't think that they are, I'm, I almost am. I, I'm still in the processing phase of it for me, like, I think I've come around to this later than most people have because, you know, running a media company and, and I think I, I think actually there's, I want to make a clear distinction between like what I'd call niche or B2B media.
00:13:29.925 - 00:14:04.005, Speaker A: And then there's mainstream media and mainstream media just completely, completely flubbed it here. I mean they just, they just missed and they missed really badly. And I've been reading the coverage after the election, specifically mainly from the New York Times and from the Atlantic, and they're continuing to miss, they're just continuing to say, you know, half the country is misogynistic and sexist and that's why, that's why the Republicans won. And it's just really polarizing the point.
00:14:05.225 - 00:14:22.753, Speaker B: Because people like my mom was getting alerts on her phone, you know, I landed and I'm with my parents here this week. And she was like getting notifications from New York Times, only mom just turn them off. Like, just look at Poly Market. She's like, I'm gonna win. She's like, you're really calm. I'm like, he's going to win. Like unequivocally I've been telling people, like for me it was, it was a no brainer.
00:14:22.753 - 00:15:25.139, Speaker B: Like I just never, like obviously the, the odds kind of fluctuated a bit. But I mean for a variety of reasons I just felt he was going to win. But the media coverage, you remember what I told you when I invested in you guys, A big part of my thesis was you have an opportunity to create a new media company and show the world what that could be and that might be through different mechanisms that you can leverage some elements of crypto to create just a better organization. I think eventually you ought to wonder is there a probability where you turn into like there's a very good, There's a couple of paths here. One that you continue to grow and the path towards growing is becoming very polarizing and clickbaity and appealing to a particular constituent base. Is that the right path? That's Certainly what like the New York Times and so and even Fox, like they become very political, they become very biased in their reporting. But there's another avenue here where you can actually like growth is not incompatible with being objective and being balanced.
00:15:25.139 - 00:15:35.771, Speaker B: And I think you guys have proven that over the last two years. Like you have been. I go back to that moment where one of your reporters published the op ed piece.
00:15:35.843 - 00:15:41.691, Speaker A: I forget it was about not, not a reporter. An opinion. An opinion.
00:15:41.803 - 00:16:09.239, Speaker B: It was an opinion piece, my bad. And you guys published it. It was controversial, most people didn't like it. But you know, opinion pieces are important. You should be kind of doing that. And so I think it's been from my standpoint, I think it's been very refreshing to see you guys kind of try to build and restore some of that balance in reporting and media organizations. The question is you keep growing.
00:16:09.239 - 00:16:42.365, Speaker B: Like can you, can you like avoid that trap that every influencer, every large organization some says in order to continue to grow you need to resort to these clickbaity things. Why? Because I don't know, for a variety of reasons. If you're an influencer, you know the value that you get, you know, it's a very small percentage of the cut that you get from YouTube and Instagram and all these things. So in order for you to kind of. It starts with very pristine content and then over time it just gets co opted and you have to do brand sponsorships and you know, all this stuff. Is that really bad? No. Is it objective? No.
00:16:42.365 - 00:16:45.313, Speaker B: So as long as you have proper disclosures.
00:16:45.369 - 00:16:45.585, Speaker A: Right.
00:16:45.625 - 00:17:11.629, Speaker B: So anyways, I think that I'm optimistic. I don't think media, let's just be realistic. Media organizations will continue to have a really big influence in the world in how people consume information. Right. But you now have prediction markets that surface the truth and can at least be, can at least be a thing that you can point to and say no actually. Well, how do you reconcile what you're reporting and what's the market's telling us? Like how do you bridge that gap?
00:17:11.757 - 00:18:08.297, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Like I'm actually very excited to work closely with Poly Market in the, in the coming years because I think that the media and prediction markets serve two sides of the same coin, which is trying to get to the truth. So what media is really good at is actually contextualizing something like again not the New York Times and the Atlantics of the world anymore, but I think like someone like Block works like our, our editorial team I think, I think is probably the best in the industry and really, really, really good at what they do. And they're very good at contextualizing things and adding like background and like thinking through things and like, and sourcing things and actually just reporting on the facts. What media, just because of like, what media is worse at is quantifying, quantifying the future and quantifying the facts. So media can add context. But it's very tough for media to be like, there's a 71% chance that Trump is going to win.
00:18:08.297 - 00:18:38.331, Speaker A: And you saw the New York Times start to try to do this, which is like their, you know, little. They had a, like the New York Times needle they call it. But you know, they completely, they completely whiffed on that. But, but that is them trying to quantify the future instead of just adding context. And I think that is where. But the problem with that is it's just an internal team of people there doing that or it's some model they've built. And what you need are the free markets quantifying things, dollars backing, backing the predictions.
00:18:38.331 - 00:18:51.907, Speaker A: And so I think the future will not be oh, it's only prediction markets or oh, it's only media. It's these two things kind of working in tandem where the prediction market helps quantify the news and contextualize.
00:18:52.091 - 00:19:17.893, Speaker B: Yeah, I think you triangulate on the truth. But in a world where you don't have prediction markets, a world is better. In a world, the world is better when you have prediction markets to at least fact check to. You know, there's a big. Just to focus the discussion in this podcast. And another, there's a lot of debate around, well, which prediction market's better? There's a big divergence that we talked about in the prior episode. Well, who's right? Predicted says one thing, polymarket says another is a big gap.
00:19:17.893 - 00:19:49.177, Speaker B: Trying to explain that gap is useful. That's where we should focus the conversation. The question will be, of course, like, what is the future viability of a prediction market? The election encompass a lot of volume. You do need to have for prediction markets, I think to be. To surface the truth. It goes back to this great book called Wisdom of the Crowds. And in order for the crowd to surface the truth, meaning a market to surface the truth, I think you need to have sufficiently large number of participants that are also heterogeneous.
00:19:49.177 - 00:20:25.635, Speaker B: Meaning if you all have left people in an extreme scenario, you have, imagine it's a soccer match, who's going to win the Champions League? Well, if you have all real Madrid fans only betting on the market and if you have many real millions of real Madrid fans. Well, obviously that. That's a very homogeneous market, large but homogeneous. So that skews it. So that's not servicing the truth. What you want to have is a sufficiently large and like number and participants in the market and dollars backing it across a very diverse group that. That surfaces the truth.
00:20:25.635 - 00:21:07.999, Speaker B: That's like the criteria that I think is Jim forget his last name in wisdom of the crowds. So that would be interesting to maybe this like from a product idea Polymarket, it would be useful for them to kind of maybe try to quantify that. And so because there's a lot of different markets people can go to Polymarket, you can pull it up and they have on all kinds of stuff, you know, sports, you know, discrete events and whatnot. Some of them have very shallow liquidity. So is that going to be useful enough? Arguably not, but I think it's still. It still allows us to. It's still better marginally irrespective of whether it's sufficiently large or heterogeneous.
00:21:07.999 - 00:21:19.189, Speaker B: I do still think that it is a good thing to focus on just to folk for a conversation starter to say, well what's the delta? Like, why is this phenomenon occurring? Right.
00:21:19.327 - 00:21:49.571, Speaker A: Yeah, the last thing. And then we can move on from this is if you. The context that. So I think people think of just media as news stories. But like I'm really, really, really bullish on podcasts and newsletters obviously as people know from Blockworks and Empire and stuff like that. But like, you know, we didn't cover the election actually that closely relative to some other Blockworks channels. But we have a show Forward Guidance and like Quinn Thompson and Tyler and Felix who's the host of Ford Guidance.
00:21:49.571 - 00:22:10.859, Speaker A: Like if you listen to them, you would have made a tremendous amount of money. Like they have been so early and so right on the Ford Guidance podcast. And actually the other thing that I missed out on mentioning was like I was just plugged into the. We. We launched all these Telegram channels across the block works like podcast. So there's an Empire channel. We can link it in the show notes.
00:22:10.859 - 00:22:34.243, Speaker A: There's a Xerox research, there's a thousand X channel. And I think the best source of information for me during the election was actually the Ford Biden's Telegram channel. So yeah, that's. So anyways, yeah, let's. Let's get into crypto. How do you think about just how are you repositioning your portfolio? Are you re rethinking your investment? Are you. Do you.
00:22:34.243 - 00:23:14.075, Speaker A: Do you Feel like you're perfectly positioned, do you think? You know, so I mean, it was interesting looking at what went up, right? Bitcoin went up like 7%. ETH went up 5 or 6%. The meme coins went up like 15%. Coin went up 20%. And the DeFi tokens, like the probably blue chip defies went up like 15 to 20% as well. So how, you know, some of the l ones like Sui Aptos, Solana Avalanche went up 10 to 15%. Like, I think there's a really interesting thing to do which is look at the performance in the first 24 hours, which should actually, I think give you some signal into what will happen over the next several months.
00:23:14.075 - 00:23:15.815, Speaker A: So I'm curious how you're thinking about this.
00:23:16.475 - 00:23:37.585, Speaker B: I didn't make any changes. I was very well, like positioned coming into it. That was as long as it could get. And so I was fully allocated. So as we were recording this, Bitcoin is at an all time high of 76,361. ETH is at 2,800. Solana is about to hit 200 to 194.
00:23:37.585 - 00:24:01.581, Speaker B: So yeah, I think you're right. It was really interesting to observe which ones rallied the most, particularly defi tokens. And I think there's a category in Coingecko that talks about like SEC securities. I want to look at that and how that performed. Let's, let's go quickly there. Categories. So Coingecko has a nice filter, says categories.
00:24:01.581 - 00:24:36.705, Speaker B: And there's one that in particular that I'm really curious about. Apologies here. Where is it alleged SEC securities that includes Solana, Tron, a bunch of others. So that was, that was up. I'm pulling it up here for one sec. That was up over the last, over the last seven days. That's been up quite substantially.
00:24:36.705 - 00:24:49.693, Speaker B: And that includes Soul, bnb, Tron, near, filecoin, Matic, like. And then you go down the list from there. You know, a lot of defi tokens.
00:24:49.869 - 00:25:07.723, Speaker A: So these ones are. These are up actually less than, you know, like Filecoin is only up 6%. Near is only up 4%. Ton is only 2%. Tron's down 5%. The things that are up the most actually tend to be, well, memes are.
00:25:07.739 - 00:25:08.579, Speaker B: Up the most, right?
00:25:08.627 - 00:25:12.935, Speaker A: Memes. Yeah, the memes. And defi, like lido is up 12%.
00:25:14.035 - 00:25:18.451, Speaker B: Right? Oh, on that you're quoting seven day, not 24 hours.
00:25:18.483 - 00:25:19.895, Speaker A: Yeah. Oh, yeah, you're right. You're right.
00:25:21.485 - 00:25:21.885, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:25:21.925 - 00:25:28.141, Speaker A: Well, it's more than 24 hours is the thing, but yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.
00:25:28.173 - 00:25:35.141, Speaker B: I mean I think it's. No, I mean everything's going up. Right. But I do think so what I. Of course I.
00:25:35.253 - 00:25:42.613, Speaker A: If you look at Ave is up 30 in the last 28 in the last 30 days. In the last seven days. Excuse me.
00:25:42.709 - 00:25:49.743, Speaker B: What's like whiff is up with. Is down actually on a seven day pair.
00:25:49.879 - 00:25:51.479, Speaker A: Why is whiff down?
00:25:51.647 - 00:26:02.155, Speaker B: I had no idea. I mean it was, it rallied quite a bit from the bottom. It was like a 190 or so. Now it's a 238 go up quite a bit.
00:26:02.815 - 00:26:27.753, Speaker A: So Ryan Watkins had this tweet, or I can pull it up. He said there's more opportunity. Single greatest setup for liquid tokens we've had since 2021. Global liquidity is expanding. Regulation is radically easing a potential US strategic bitcoin reserve could spark a sovereign bitcoin accumulation race. Crypto is unambiguously becoming the election trade and will likely be the fastest horse in the race. A few powerful alt narratives are accelerating.
00:26:27.753 - 00:26:44.801, Speaker A: AI Autumn Soul Super Cycle, Meme Coin Mania, Defi Renaissance. How do you think about like, are you trying to pick any new winners right now? Are you re looking at things? Are you basically just sitting in your Solana Meme Coins Coinbase stock and just kind of sitting on that?
00:26:44.833 - 00:27:08.255, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, I'm not, not doing okay. Chris Berniski had a tweet around, like, if you've been sidelined, you have the window on allocating is closing. And so yeah, he's had something to that effect. Yeah, actually I actually would take the opposite argument here. And I responded to his tweet. I'll tell you why. We'll read his tweet first.
00:27:08.255 - 00:27:47.275, Speaker B: I mean he said, he basically said that it's a bit further down. If you've been sidelined, you have a narrow window of time to fix your mistake. That was a day ago. My response to him says, I'd argue you have plenty of time because it's still very early and this industry will grow much more than most believe. We're still at a point where most businesses don't appreciate how crypto works or how it can help them. I think you'll know we're no longer early when most businesses leverage crypto and yet their users may not even know it or care about it. And that's the point because I do think that like many transformational technologies, crypto will be invisible, but its impact will be felt.
00:27:47.275 - 00:28:28.693, Speaker B: Like again, going back to the discussion, like polymarket was very visible. It was Very useful for many people beyond the crypto. Kind of what is still a very small ecosystem I would characterize, even though there's millions of users. However you want to slice it. But you know, I mean, like, okay, like we talk about the biggest opportunity I think ahead of us is if you're a project, the design space hopefully just opens up dramatically in the things that you can explore in the way you design your token economics and how. And then the inverse of that is. Or the alternate point is a lot of businesses have been sidelined like from people that want to invest in the asset class.
00:28:28.693 - 00:29:14.919, Speaker B: You know, we've heard it from Multiple institutions like BlackRocks of the world, like a lot from an allocation perspective. Many banks, RIAs can even, you know, most of the flows into ETFs are still self directed accounts or not managed accounts, meaning the bankers not calling can't recommend an ETF product. But I'm quite excited obviously from my vantage point and what I'm trying to do now with the fund is you ought to wonder how many businesses I think at this point understand this, have a good sense of what crypto can do for them, but they haven't really been comfortable getting involved because of the regulatory, lack of regulatory guidance and clarity and a very hostile environment. Right. So I mean I think it, this is a perfect setup. Obviously you can play it in the short term. There's a huge, I think the markets continue to.
00:29:14.919 - 00:29:35.325, Speaker B: You know, I sort of agree with Ryan's take and Chris's take. Like, you know, it feels like 2025 is going to be a great year for a variety, variety of reasons. But if you extend that to five years, 10 years, like there's a real shot that, I mean, you know what I mean? Like it's not a 10 trillion opportunity here. If this really works, it's gonna be way bigger than that.
00:29:37.345 - 00:30:08.455, Speaker C: Skale is the blockchain that is simply built different. Let's face it, other L1 networks have costly transaction fees that increase as the network gets busier.

00:33:42.525 - 00:34:22.653, Speaker A: So I think you both are right. Chris is probably right that we're entering the stage of the cycle where things get really freaking crazy. Like 2025 could be really, really, really crazy. And like, do you really want to be buying if you're kind of trading the cycles, you know, do you want to be buying bitcoin at like 120 or something? Like maybe not like late stage cycle if you're holding for a decade. Yes. What I think nobody is thinking about is we had a massive out. What's the opposite of influx? Departure of developers actually to AI about a year, maybe over the last two years.
00:34:22.653 - 00:34:40.379, Speaker A: And what you're about to see, I think, and we're kind of positioning for this with we just announced permissionless four today, which I can. I know you're probably 7:00am there right now, so I can. I don't know if you've seen it yet, but we're bringing Brooklyn. Yeah, we're bringing it to Brooklyn. Well, you're. Yeah, okay, we're up by 5am what.
00:34:40.387 - 00:34:40.963, Speaker B: Are you talking about?
00:34:41.019 - 00:34:42.003, Speaker A: Yeah, you're out here.
00:34:42.139 - 00:34:43.555, Speaker B: I'm drinking great Hawaiian coffee.
00:34:43.595 - 00:35:11.307, Speaker A: This is, this is. That looks. That looks phenomenal. Actually, the thing that nobody's thinking about or I just haven't seen people talking about is what happens to the industry when you get a 10, when you 10x the number of developers. And these aren't crypto developers. These are Shopify developers and Stripe developers and developers coming from traditional capital markets and from, from Airbnb and from Facebook. And look, it takes them some time and maybe they're not as.
00:35:11.307 - 00:35:39.607, Speaker A: What they, what they lack on the crypto nativity and the ability to launch a token and have that token go up, they make up for and more in their ui, their ux, their ability to think about customer acquisition. And yeah, just build a really good consumer product. And so I think people forget what happens when you 10x the number of developers in an industry. And that is about, that is much more important in 2025 than the price going up in 2025. We are about to 10x the number.
00:35:39.631 - 00:36:18.343, Speaker B: Of developers we hit just an all time high before the election and maybe the market was feeling that. I'm talking about bitcoin. It's sort of like we've gone this far in a very hostile environment, you know, no matter how you want to talk about it. Lance Vance from Framework had a great tweet around how difficult it is to run a U.S. you know, based investment firm in crypto, like from one day to the other. And I've seen it, your bank account gets shut down, it's very difficult to have service providers, you know, people constantly discount you. So it's from that standpoint it's very hostile.
00:36:18.343 - 00:36:35.807, Speaker B: Most teams left the U.S. they went to Dubai, they went to Singapore, they just gone even to London because that's marginally better. So I mean certainly like you're going to have more developers come into the space. But from my standpoint, like there's a lot of really good tech that's been built. It's just, it's just, it hasn't been.
00:36:35.831 - 00:36:57.059, Speaker A: Adopted because it is legal to work in crypto now. Like it's obviously been not going to go to jail for working in crypto but they make it about as hard as as you can make it to work in an industry. I mean everyone was getting debanked last year. It's hard to set up a fund. You can't accept tokens. Everyone's setting up these Cayman entities. There's no rules around how to issue a token.
00:36:57.059 - 00:37:09.435, Speaker A: Like it is damn hard to operate in this industry. Even hosting conferences. Look at all like consensus used to be the flagship US conference. They're hosting their event in freaking Toronto next year. Like they, they left the US and.
00:37:09.475 - 00:37:45.575, Speaker B: So here's a, here's a, here's an interesting take that I agree with Michelle. He said if Trump wins, ETH loses its regulatory mode. Mind you, eth these referencing ETH has been dubbed as a non like not a security accelerating the timeline for the sole Eth flipping we actually agree with. It's interesting take. I of course have talked about Solana flipping Ethereum because I see more developers, I see more activity there. Some of the like the slope of the curve and if you go listen to the debate that I had with Avitual, Avitual is actually the one that described it like this. Shout out to Avitual, he said the slope of the curve because they put out the developer report.
00:37:45.575 - 00:38:19.541, Speaker B: There are more developers in Ethereum today. There's more TVL on Ethereum today. But the slope of the curve is what you want to be looking at is from the best new teams are building on Solana. The best, most exciting projects are building in Solana. More users, the newer users and developers entering the space are going to Solana. One of my portfolio companies, Time Fon, just announced that it was going to move over to Solana. There's plenty of examples like Geonet, some of these projects, they all realize the activity and the attention is in Solana because it provides just a more seamless, frictionless experience for the user.
00:38:19.541 - 00:38:39.943, Speaker B: So I actually shall frame it from that lens, which I thought was interesting. And I agree with. So Solana is up vastly. Solana responded much more than Ethereum after the election. Like Salana's now, it was like a 160. Now is close to 200 eth has gone up as well. But Salana like the Soul east chart, pull that up.
00:38:39.943 - 00:38:44.135, Speaker B: I'm not, I'm not a chartist or hey, but I do appreciate, you know.
00:38:44.175 - 00:38:48.755, Speaker A: I'm not a charter. But when I sees the Soul Eth chart going up, I will want.
00:38:49.535 - 00:38:50.823, Speaker B: I'd be remiss.
00:38:50.959 - 00:39:24.535, Speaker A: So look at here, here. Let me get out of the prices for a second and show you what I think is more interesting, which is not actually I tweeted this. I said US conferences are back. So, so totally tweeted Break Point USA 2026. Jill said, Hear me out DEVCON 2025. And Rush, he said, can we finally have more conferences in the States yet? And the thing that is interesting is, I mean it's not even in how long you've been in the industry. A decade, right? Every two years we ebb and every two to three years we ebb and flow between Asia and the U.S.
00:39:24.535 - 00:39:38.327, Speaker A: asia and the U.S. it's like, you know, U.S. is super hot. U.S. cracks down, everything goes to Asia, then China. China does the bitcoin mining ban, everything come back to the US Then FTX blows up. Gensler cracks down, everything goes to Asia.
00:39:38.327 - 00:40:09.435, Speaker A: And this marks the US is back on. I would say the us The US trade is back on. People are reminded that New York is the crypto capital of the world, the hub of all the. Of, you know, of all the capital. And I just think that's good net good for the industry and Net good for the United States. Like it doesn't make sense necessarily that this industry should. I mean I'm biased, I'm a US Person, but like it's a good thing to have a strong and vibrant US Ecosystem.
00:40:09.515 - 00:40:30.545, Speaker B: Absolutely. The US in my mind, like when people ask me where I'm from, I identify American. I'm not American, but I identify American because it's the best place in the world for two reasons. One, it has a system that works. Why? Let me, let me elaborate on that. Crypto you still had very hostile, you know, the branches of government, what makes a democracy great. You know, you have executive, legislative and administrative.
00:40:30.545 - 00:41:22.101, Speaker B: You know, even in a very hostile administration, you still won most of the biggest, most important court cases when it went to court. And the constitutional interpretation of things, like there's a bedrock there like you and we have talked about it how many times in this podcast is you have to believe in the court system because if the court system fails and it fails in many other countries, then that's a problem. So no matter who the executive is, no matter how the administration, the legislative composition is on one outside of the aisle or the other, you believe the courts will interpret the Constitution and the key values and principles of a country and what it stands for. So I think from a systemic standpoint, countries are great. From that reason, like the interpretation of the law needs to be sound and predictable. It has been in the US for crypto. I appreciate it's been very regulatory.
00:41:22.101 - 00:41:38.145, Speaker B: Like the hostility has been an all time high. But the courts have ruled in the favor of Ripple. What is a dcg Grayscale. Right. You have the ETF approved. We have to sue the three letter agency to get it approved and we won. You know, I mean like, so that's really powerful.
00:41:38.145 - 00:42:24.645, Speaker B: And the second one is just from a cultural standpoint, like it is a place that it is aspirational still for most people around the world. Like you go to the US because people care more about what you think and what you stand for as opposed to where you come from, if you come from money or not. And you can actually fail. And, and people, people allow that. There's so many cultures where, you know it's not very pro innovation because as soon as you fail, it's like seppuku, like your family, it's a disgrace. And I'm not going to name the countries, but there's many cultures like that. And so I think I came to the US and for me it was the biggest opportunity that I had because you are in the Most competitive markets, whether it's New York, whether it's elite institutions.
00:42:24.645 - 00:42:50.875, Speaker B: And also, people care more about what you think. And that's so refreshing, incredibly refreshing. People that don't appreciate that live in the US Go and travel, go meet people, ask people, ask immigrants where they come from and how they're treated in their country culturally. For that reason, I think America, in my mind, has always been the greatest country for at least of our generation. Is it at its prime and peak?
00:42:50.995 - 00:42:51.347, Speaker A: No.
00:42:51.411 - 00:43:04.923, Speaker B: But I'd argue where this is a big inflection point to recover marginally what it lost. And I'm really excited to see that. Heck, I'd move back. I told you this, I'd move back. I mean, I'm not sure I'm going to move back.
00:43:05.059 - 00:43:06.375, Speaker A: You think you'll move back?
00:43:07.635 - 00:43:13.115, Speaker B: Definitely. I have. I have office space. I have office space in New York now.
00:43:13.235 - 00:43:13.987, Speaker A: Let's go.
00:43:14.131 - 00:43:23.393, Speaker B: That's where most of the people that I'm hiring are going to be based. The strategy and most of the businesses that I'm already looking to acquire are based in the U.S. the other thing.
00:43:23.409 - 00:43:51.109, Speaker A: That people haven't mentioned is the IPO market is going to open up. It's been really tough to raise money as a crypto company. I mean, we're not raising, but like talking to a lot of founder friends. If you are a seed in series A, like, you probably actually had some success the last couple of months. But Series B, series C and series D are completely hamstrung from fundraising right now. And the. There's two reasons for that.
00:43:51.109 - 00:43:56.725, Speaker A: One is the IPO markets are closed. They've been. They've been closed, but they never been open for.
00:43:56.765 - 00:43:59.025, Speaker B: They've never been open for crypto companies, really.
00:43:59.405 - 00:44:02.105, Speaker A: They've never been up. You know, they've never been open.
00:44:04.525 - 00:44:09.333, Speaker B: The last fundraising environment has sucked. You haven't really had new money come in or being allocated to crypto funds.
00:44:09.429 - 00:44:16.969, Speaker A: Well, all the funds are really struggling to raise. As you know, there's some tiny fundraisers happening right now with these funds.
00:44:17.017 - 00:44:26.681, Speaker B: I think most of the success had been like sub 100 million funds, some break and like 100, 200. There's few that have raised more than that.
00:44:26.793 - 00:45:11.399, Speaker A: So there's just no new money. And, you know, 10T Dan Tapiro and 10T let our last round and I saw that Dan said something on stage at an event yesterday, said they got like 30 to 50 inbounds yesterday from. From folks. And you know, we had our board meeting this week and he was saying similar stuff just about, like, what. What would happen, which is there's a lot of allocators who are now just woke up and they can't allocate to the liquid crypto markets. Like, they're not just buying Ether Solana, so they need to allocate to these funds that'll take them, what, six months to do. And so there's actually this, like, there's a real lag in the fundraising markets from an event like this.
00:45:11.399 - 00:45:17.599, Speaker A: And so it's. I would watch it. You know, maybe we'll see it, like end of Q1, going into Q2, like, I think you'll start to see it.
00:45:17.607 - 00:45:42.875, Speaker B: Might be, it might be sooner than that, actually. Well, what's, what's, what's different now, of course, is. Well, two, what I'm thinking about is how many of these allocators haven't allocated and we're waiting for the outcome of the election. Waiting for, you know, and so now that that's been resolved, where are they going to allocate? Are they going to buy an etf?
00:45:43.215 - 00:45:43.959, Speaker A: Have.
00:45:44.127 - 00:46:25.543, Speaker B: Did they do that before the election? And how much of their allocation of crypto from a portfolio standpoint is going to go to funds? Historically it's been this idea of, like, I'm going to allocate in a fund and that's how I'll let them handle a lot of the complexity. And now they have an ETF in the picture. Right. But we've had it for a while. I think the etf, the people that were on the sidelines, I would argue more of that capital will flow into funds, less so on a marginal basis in the ETFs, because people, I think for the most part kind of like, were comfortable buying the Bitcoin etf, maybe an Ethereum etf. Um, but you're right. I mean, we should, we should track flows.
00:46:25.543 - 00:46:47.319, Speaker B: But I do think I got like two or three emails from different funds. They're like, we're opening the subscription window all of a sudden. And you're like, yeah, of course you are. Which is good, you know, like. Yeah. And I think they're. And I think to your point around Dan and 10T, like a lot of them are getting inbound interest from people that, that were just waiting for this to be resolved to then saying, okay, I want to do it, I do want to have exposure.
00:46:47.319 - 00:46:49.773, Speaker B: And now I want to find the right manager to do that for me.
00:46:49.919 - 00:47:20.151, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. We just talk about this how crazy thing, I have two friends who are down in Mar a Lago and actually, well, I'm not gonna. I mean, basically Trump was just saying extremely bullish things about crypto to them. Like outlandishly bullish is what I would say. Just outlandishly.
00:47:20.223 - 00:47:28.023, Speaker B: Listen, if even 5% of what he said about crypto is true and actually follows through on it, I mean, it's a huge risk.
00:47:28.159 - 00:47:48.487, Speaker A: So take the bitcoin, went up 7% overnight. But take something like the bitcoin reserve. So as a reminder, the bitcoin reserve was introduced by Senator Lummis back in June, I think. And basically what the bitcoin reserve means is you would use existing funds at the Fed and the treasury to purchase 1 million Bitcoin, which would make the.
00:47:48.511 - 00:47:51.311, Speaker B: US the largest.1 million units of Bitcoin.
00:47:51.383 - 00:47:58.271, Speaker A: Units of bitcoin, which would make the US the largest nation state holder of bitcoin. Give us about a 5%.
00:47:58.463 - 00:48:00.915, Speaker B: It still is because of the seas Bitcoin.
00:48:02.855 - 00:48:36.365, Speaker A: Yeah, good point. Okay, it would give us about a five. That's a good point. But it would give us about a 5% ownership of the network, which people are like, oh, they would never do something like that. Well, newsflash is that we are 5% ownership of the network is about on par with our stake in the global gold supply, actually. So this would get us on par with where? With our ownership in the gold supply. And you know, if you look at where we're at as a country, we have 36 trillion in debt, growing at about $1 trillion every hundred days.
00:48:36.365 - 00:49:17.851, Speaker A: All roads seem like they're leading to inflation. There's a risk of losing the status as the global reserve currency if that keeps happening. And if you have a long term outlook here, like everything from a macro perspective signals that you should increase your exposure to risk assets. I don't think it's really crazy to think that Trump might actually follow through on something like the bitcoin reserve or shutting down the ability for the U.S. marshals to sell their, their seized bitcoin. Yeah, these kind of things that it's like, it seems like these outlandish things, but now that it's actually happening, I mean, the head of his transition is Howard Lutnick. Howard Lutnick is the runs Caner Fitzgerald who banks tether, right.
00:49:17.851 - 00:49:30.295, Speaker A: He owns personally hundreds of millions of dollars of bitcoin. It's just like I don't think people are really big understanding how, how insane this actually could get.
00:49:32.755 - 00:50:38.975, Speaker B: People ask me why I steal crypto is because I tell them very concretely, I am of the mind that I'm earlier now than I was before because you see the impact of starting to work in many things that perhaps before I didn't appreciate. And the second, I think it's sort of this quote by Bill Gates which is, we tend to overestimate what happens in two years and grossly underestimate what happens in 10. And I appreciate we've been at this for more than, you know, since like the financial crisis, but I genuinely think that this is like, I think most of the markets and people's imagination doesn't go that far. So you stop believing. Because if you've been in an environment where things have been slow and not all of it is attributable to a regulatory environment that has been hostile, but you become tired, you become more skeptical, heck, you become cynical. And it's really important in my time in crypto, it is so important to check yourself in the mirror and say, have I become cynical? Because you got to remind yourself of why you came into the space. You got to also re underwrite your thesis as you're doing now.
00:50:38.975 - 00:51:18.041, Speaker B: Perhaps with this, there's new information, there's a new environment, you should re underwrite the thesis. But go back and remind yourself, observe, talk to founders of what's working. And again it's like invert and say if it's been working and we've gone this far with the tech not being as great, that was like, or with a regulatory brand, it's been hustle, the combination of all that. But you have some really powerful, really useful pieces of tech, like a stable coin or like a prediction market. Or then you wonder like, okay, yeah, this can actually be way bigger than 10 trillion or way bigger than digital. Like a gold market cap. Yeah.
00:51:18.041 - 00:51:54.259, Speaker B: How much value do you think could settle on the fucking Internet? How big do you think that is? You mean like that's not 10 trillion? It's hard, hate to break it, it's way, way bigger than that. Now is it going to take like the, the challenge always like markets always get ahead of themselves. And maybe that's Chris's point. Like you gotta, you know, you gotta, you gotta underwrite that. You gotta move before others do. And a lot of the big moves in prior cycles have been, you know, you had to, you had to be allocated. Like the difference between allocated in like a month before compound launch, liquidity mining and the month after was the difference between a 30x and a 20x or 15x or a 5x.
00:51:54.259 - 00:52:35.115, Speaker B: Like it was months. And so is that going to, is it going to be different this time around? I don't markets do react very violently, but, man, I just. It is still kind of crazy that money can now move kind of at the speed of light. And that's just. We're talking about this. Most people, like, don't appreciate how limited the investment opportunity is for people outside the US they cannot buy Apple stock. I've had this belief that perhaps the most amount of money in this space will be captured by people that aren't in the space today, but will be in the next couple of years.
00:52:35.115 - 00:52:57.265, Speaker B: Because they. They're coming at it from like that fresh perspective that you came at it, like, when you started in crypto. You're like, holy shit, this could really transform the Internet. But, you know, you spend enough time to get rugged a few times, you get frustrated, you lose patience, you become cynical. But I think the whole theme of this episode, the narrative, is I think you ought to re. Underwrite your thesis.
00:52:58.485 - 00:53:09.727, Speaker A: And I think that's a really good point. I mean, take something like tokenized stocks. Like, that will happen. But if you've been in the industry for as long as we have, you hear that and you're like, oh, my God, you don't get it.
00:53:09.791 - 00:53:12.351, Speaker B: 50 mirror and synthetics.
00:53:12.463 - 00:53:14.143, Speaker A: You don't get it. Everyone's tried. That does.
00:53:14.199 - 00:53:14.703, Speaker C: Doesn't work.
00:53:14.759 - 00:53:37.953, Speaker A: Someone will come and do that. Someone will come and do that. Or here's another one. I want to move these freaking election. I mean, thank God it wasn't a close election because thank God it wasn't a close election because if it was close, I mean, the next three months in this country would be. Would be total hell. Like the election fraud and the votes getting recounted.
00:53:37.953 - 00:53:48.045, Speaker A: Like, we gotta move these. We gotta move these votes onto a damn blockchain or something. Or some better system. Like some entrepreneur who's never.
00:53:48.625 - 00:53:51.249, Speaker B: Colorado, Colorado did this. A pilot.
00:53:51.297 - 00:54:08.595, Speaker A: I don't know. Everyone piloted these things. But like, all these, like, all these entrepreneurs in crypto who are the really good entrepreneurs, including myself, would be like, that's been tried before. You can't do that. Some entrepreneur out there is going to be like, oh, my God, we got to fix this.
00:54:10.095 - 00:54:29.697, Speaker B: What makes a great founder? You and I have listened to so many founders. You're a great founder. What makes a great founder? I'll tell you why. I'll tell you why. I think the best founders need to be maniacally obsessive about a particular idea combined with some naivete of how you.
00:54:29.721 - 00:54:30.369, Speaker A: Have to be naive.
00:54:30.417 - 00:54:51.551, Speaker B: You have to be naive enough to not fully understand how difficult it's going to be. But you have to have both. The ability to take extreme pain. That's a quote from the Four Seasons founder. Excellence is the ability to take pain. Right? That requires a maniacal obsession about, you know, right now I'm obsessed about friction in systems. It pisses me off.
00:54:51.551 - 00:55:27.955, Speaker B: Every hotel, every interaction that I have, I'm like, God damn it, there. There has to be a better way to do fucking things, you know, so you maniacally obsess about something, you are obsessed about media and the frustration with it, but you also have to be naive enough about how difficult it was going to be. You have to keep at it. So your point is that is it almost requires. If you've been in the space long enough, you probably lose that sense of, you know, naivete. But you have to be kind of new coming into the space and say, well, shit, why are we counting votes with paper and all this crap? Like, there surely is a better way to do that in an immutable ledger.
00:55:28.035 - 00:55:28.635, Speaker A: Right?
00:55:28.795 - 00:56:03.917, Speaker B: Right. And he doesn't know that. There have been like 30 pilots, like, I'll give you an example, talking about mistakes I've made in my investing trajectory, which is not very luminary, but nonetheless, I passed on helium. Multico was like an early investor and they came to me and said, hey, you want to participate? I was like, this has been tried way too many times in Web2. Like, why is it gonna be any different? And it was that, you know, sometimes. Or like a lot of people passed on defi because they said, uniswap. Oh, you must not know.
00:56:03.917 - 00:57:22.623, Speaker B: Centralized order book models. If you're a finance guy, you're like, centralized order book models will always be superior. I'm like, yes, but let's talk about, you know, some of the benefits of an amm. So anyways, yeah, to your point around developers, I think in a perfect world, you want to understand out of the new developers, how does that quality compare relative to prior cycles or prime? Like, is the quality not just the number of it, but the quality of the founder? Where are they coming from? Are they the exceptional founders that in moments of time in this industry have come from the likes of Google and the top, like Web2 kind of companies, Are they entering the space and where are they building, which ecosystem, which application? Now all this to say is some of these founders are not necessarily the best because historically it's been very difficult to build in crypto. Right? And a lot of the same founders that came from Stanford or some of these elite companies ended up were the ones that Ended up leaving the fastest because they lost conviction and they knew that they could just go and find another job. Right. What I'm trying to say is I think most of the people that pivoted the AI or left the space in like, in prior cycles were these guys that like, or, you know, they came from the Googles of the world and like, they lost really quickly.
00:57:22.719 - 00:57:23.395, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:57:24.095 - 00:57:37.385, Speaker B: So anyways, I'm not suggesting that everyone on Google and Stanford is soft, but you gotta have a lot of grit in this space and a lot of ability to take pain. And so anyways, it's not easy.
00:57:38.125 - 00:57:41.725, Speaker A: This week I saw two pictures that made me think of you. I will show them to you.
00:57:41.845 - 00:57:43.341, Speaker B: Oh, boy, here we go.
00:57:43.493 - 00:57:47.345, Speaker A: No, no, no. This is one of them.
00:57:47.685 - 00:57:50.261, Speaker C: Due to rising costs, all non cash.
00:57:50.333 - 00:57:56.945, Speaker A: Transactions will incur a 3.5% processing fee. Wait, here's the other ridiculous.
00:57:57.725 - 00:58:00.785, Speaker B: Where is that? New York.
00:58:01.605 - 00:58:13.957, Speaker A: Yep. And then the other one was my local bodega cash discount. 2%, baby. So friction in the system got 2. 2 to 3.5%.
00:58:14.141 - 00:58:25.389, Speaker B: This is my calling. I'm like, I'm just obsessed. The same way that you are about media and transforming. I'm a. I'm obsessed from a. There ought to be a better way with just friction in systems.
00:58:25.477 - 00:58:33.185, Speaker A: It's crazy. You want to see something else? That's wild. Just because I'm sharing my screen and says nothing about crypto, I went to.
00:58:33.565 - 00:58:34.909, Speaker B: Wait, is this a crypto pod?
00:58:34.997 - 00:58:36.573, Speaker A: I went to a butchering class.
00:58:36.749 - 00:58:37.745, Speaker B: Oh, wow.
00:58:40.005 - 00:58:44.029, Speaker A: This dude Gary taught us how to butcher a full pig. Isn't that crazy?
00:58:44.197 - 00:58:48.935, Speaker B: Wow. Well, who's on the chopping block?
00:58:49.595 - 00:58:59.347, Speaker A: I tried to. I was going to tweet it. I was like, pug, pig butchering, golden bull market. I was like, this has nothing to do.
00:58:59.451 - 00:59:07.555, Speaker B: You're just stretching. You just saw something that was really. Is this really your first time you've seen like this pro, like the sausage making process, so to speak?
00:59:07.595 - 00:59:10.043, Speaker A: I've never seen how the sausage is made. Yes.
00:59:10.139 - 00:59:18.225, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Well, definitely avoid it. Fascinating discussion. We're Both up at 5am.
00:59:20.805 - 00:59:24.533, Speaker A: Have you watched the permissionless launch video? If not, I'm going to show you it. It's 30 seconds.
00:59:24.709 - 00:59:26.381, Speaker B: This is Brooklyn one.
00:59:26.533 - 00:59:29.797, Speaker A: It is. Can you hear the sound?
00:59:29.861 - 01:00:04.497, Speaker B: Yeah, I can hear baby. Nice.
01:00:04.601 - 01:00:05.605, Speaker A: I'll be there.
01:00:05.945 - 01:00:07.753, Speaker B: By the way, great song. Great song.
01:00:07.769 - 01:00:12.457, Speaker A: How sick of that video. How good is that video? All right, what else is that?
01:00:12.521 - 01:00:15.961, Speaker B: I think that's pretty good, right? Anything else we should talk about?
01:00:16.153 - 01:00:17.577, Speaker C: No, no, go.
01:00:17.681 - 01:00:56.131, Speaker A: I'm sure other people have much if you guys want an actual political take of what happened in this election and like an actual debrief of like red versus blue type of stuff. I'm sure Quinn and Tyler and Felix are going to do that on the forward guidance podcast. But yeah, that's it. Bullish crypto. Bullish crypto in the United States. And just. Yeah, if you, if you have made it this far and you've been listening to Empire for a while, like small tap on the back for, for getting to this, getting to this place and I, I know a lot of Empire listeners like it was your first real cycle and a lot of you guys came in and the last cycle maybe and braved it to.
01:00:56.131 - 01:01:02.059, Speaker A: Through 2022 and 23 three and got to this point and yeah, just grateful for, for all you guys for.
01:01:02.147 - 01:01:08.251, Speaker B: We have a, we have a telegram chat. There's some, some activity happening there so you might want to join that and.
01:01:08.363 - 01:01:25.035, Speaker A: There'S, there's some activity happening there. Yeah, we, let's, let's put a link at the very top of the show notes, make it easy to find. We've got 362 folks. We have somewhere between like 10 and 15,000 listeners per episode here. So we got a. We gotta pump those numbers.
01:01:25.375 - 01:01:43.623, Speaker B: Yeah, there's rookie numbers. Let's pump them up. Ladies and gentlemen. If we're not at 50 000, I'm quitting this. I'm. I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be way busier going forward by the way. I mean I was busy before, but we need to get 50000 or bust 15, 000, 50000 and that's like selling short, boss.
01:01:43.719 - 01:02:04.371, Speaker A: Yeah, we go way higher. We release episode on the day of the election. So I would recommend going and actually listening to that episode. If you guys missed it, it's Zach, the founder of Bridge. It's his only interview he's done since selling the company to Stripe. So I'd really recommend going to listen to that for sure.
01:02:04.483 - 01:02:22.901, Speaker B: Yeah. And by the way, thank you for the feedback. I know a lot of you have DM me. A lot of people really like that episode and this is one of the most die hard listeners. He always sends me feedback on episodes. So again, now's your chance to share feedback live on the telegram group or on YouTube or on Twitter. We are listening.
01:02:22.901 - 01:02:27.421, Speaker B: If you like stuff or you don't like stuff that we're doing, please let us know. We appreciate it.
01:02:27.573 - 01:02:29.477, Speaker A: Cool. Cheers folks. See you Tuesday.
01:02:29.621 - 01:02:30.585, Speaker B: Thank you guys.
01:02:31.285 - 01:02:50.525, Speaker C: Hey everyone, thanks for watching today's. Episode. Just wanted to quickly thank today's title sponsor, Skale. Skale really is one of the best chain experiences out there today and I've used so many different chains. There's a reason they are gaining so much adoption in both gaming and AI use cases. Hit the link in the show notes to explore the scale ecosystem.
