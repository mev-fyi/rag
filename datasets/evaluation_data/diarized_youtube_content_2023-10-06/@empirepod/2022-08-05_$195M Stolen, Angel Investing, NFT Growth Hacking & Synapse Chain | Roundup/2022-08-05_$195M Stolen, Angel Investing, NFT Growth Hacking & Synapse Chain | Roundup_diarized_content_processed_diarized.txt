00:00:04.360 - 00:00:13.718, Speaker A: This episode is brought to you by core, the brand new non custodial wallet that offers a seamless and secure experience on Avalanche. You'll hear more about core later in the show.
00:00:13.806 - 00:00:30.080, Speaker B: People are commenting that I, like, have terrible. Like, do you read a lot of the YouTube comments? Because I find them. I love trolls. There's people that, like, they're like, this guy has no semblance. Like, he doesn't even know how to speak to the camera. I'm like, I don't know, man. I'm all over the place.
00:00:30.080 - 00:00:35.080, Speaker B: Like, I'm looking in my. Like, you know what I mean? Like, I'm not gonna look straight. It's so weird.
00:00:35.232 - 00:00:40.008, Speaker A: It was like. Like, why is Santiago the unhappiest man in crypto? This guy's never seen a smile.
00:00:40.056 - 00:00:55.488, Speaker B: I'm like, guys come down a ton. What are you talking about? Like, can't you see I'm visibly depressed? No, no. I love people. It's like, so I'm gonna make an effort to look straight in the. Literally, like a psycho. Just look straight in the camera. It's very weird.
00:00:55.616 - 00:00:55.880, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:00:55.912 - 00:01:01.408, Speaker B: Like, I think I'm, like, socially awkward, and so looking at the camera feels like I'm looking at someone in the eyes, and, like, I don't.
00:01:01.496 - 00:01:14.216, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. I think, um. I mean, I think the way that the Internet goes is, like, the deepest trolls are on four chan. The second deepest trolls are probably in the depths of the YouTube comments and are definitely crypto. Like, definitely. Yeah.
00:01:14.240 - 00:01:16.552, Speaker B: The two Venn diagrams are very much so.
00:01:16.728 - 00:01:22.648, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah, man. It is a. Yeah, the YouTube comments are a scary place. Try not to look at those.
00:01:22.736 - 00:01:38.456, Speaker B: It's a tough crowd of. Please. So, anyways, I'm still gonna do this. I don't care. So I'm not gonna get. I'm also not gonna get podcast video training. Unless blockwurst wants to send me to a camp and get me a coach to do, like, pr training, which I'm not there in life, then I'm okay.
00:01:38.456 - 00:01:39.520, Speaker B: I'm just gonna keep doing my thing.
00:01:39.552 - 00:01:43.336, Speaker A: You ever. Have you ever used a business coach or, like, an investing coach or, like.
00:01:43.360 - 00:02:07.252, Speaker B: Anything very briefly, like. Like a wendy in billions, but briefly. And I'm a big believer, though, in therapy and self care. Um, I think it's one of the best investments I've made, but I've usually just don't use them for business stuff. It's more like personal stuff that I wouldn't be able to talk to friends for. The other stuff, I just use this podcast as my way to riff and.
00:02:07.428 - 00:02:12.704, Speaker A: Yeah. Did you just subtly compare yourself to Bobby Axelrod? Santi.
00:02:14.444 - 00:02:21.644, Speaker B: There is an episode where he does give one of his employees a ledger, like, with, like, loaded with, like, a billing BTC. I still remember that scene, but, yeah.
00:02:21.684 - 00:02:27.412, Speaker A: Or maybe. Maybe you're more of a. Who's the. Who's the person that he hires a tailor. Maybe you're more of a tailor.
00:02:27.588 - 00:02:30.884, Speaker B: Oh, man. I don't know if I should take that as a compliment or not, but.
00:02:30.964 - 00:02:35.364, Speaker A: All right, we're moving on. We're moving past that. Check how we feel about the. About the current markets.
00:02:35.444 - 00:03:01.910, Speaker B: I'm feeling pretty hot. I'm feeling pretty good about it. I think increasingly, like, look, you always sort of look at signs of a bottom. There's a few that I've observed. The one that I was reading today is this. There's an index that is composed of, like, private market secondary valuations. And that has come down to a point where it is down, like, 28% year to date, which is now below the Nasdaq performance.
00:03:01.910 - 00:03:41.258, Speaker B: And I've always felt that, like, there was a time where the. Not just in crypto, but, like, about private market valuations were still very inflated and hadn't corrected. And now they have at least look, this index, not comprehensive, but it does track some stuff. And I think that's a very healthy barometer of, like, okay, we probably. You always look at things that need to be corrected, and this was one that I was looking at, and I think it's sort of a late indicator and an important one for a sign that we've probably bottomed. So inflation seems to be coming down a bit. Obviously, there's risk still china, that is concerning, and the whole Taiwan situation, that could be escalating or not.
00:03:41.258 - 00:03:53.050, Speaker B: And then Europe and gas, uh, prices. Uh, I mean, like, just like the energy prices. I mean, Europe's pretty much gonna go in a recession. I think so. But that doesn't necessarily concern me. I'm not a macro expert. I observe it.
00:03:53.050 - 00:04:01.226, Speaker B: But, no, I'm feeling pretty good in crypto. Um, there's a lot to talk about, especially this week, a lot of events since we did the last roundup. So I'm excited.
00:04:01.370 - 00:04:23.368, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. It feels like the last part of the market that hasn't been hit hard is still the labor market. Actually. Um, that's pretty. I think there's still more pain to be seen in the labor market, but we've seen a lot of the extent of the actual, uh, equities and crypto market pain has been, uh, I think we've seen the bottom there. I don't think we've seen the bottom in the labor market.
00:04:23.368 - 00:04:25.528, Speaker A: That's the probably last big thing I'm watching.
00:04:25.656 - 00:04:57.860, Speaker B: Yeah, it was interesting, I think we mentioned in, in a prior episode, but, uh, I think it was, uh, Peters who said it. Um, bitcoin was a leading indicator of risk, and bitcoin actually, and crypto generally, like, topped and declined before all the recession concerns. This was November of last year. And if you believe that to be true again, then perhaps crypto is also going to mark the bottom. And then obviously, ETH and bitcoin, general crypto markets up quite a bit since last month, since the bottom. And so that may be a leading indicator.
00:04:57.972 - 00:05:26.244, Speaker A: Yeah. Speaking of the labor market, we saw Robinhood do layoffs. Second round of layoffs, we saw Gemini did the same thing. They laid off a couple of people, a little bit of the workforce, then they had to do bigger layoffs. So Robinhood, they did 9% cuts in April. Now they just did 23%. So I think you actually, I think there's a second round of layoffs coming for companies that didn't dig deep enough, maybe back in, let's say, june or even July, in the June or July cuts.
00:05:26.244 - 00:05:50.328, Speaker A: And so I think that's a big thing. I'm paying attention to Larry Summers, the former treasury secretary. I don't know if you saw this. He stated that we need 5% unemployment for five years to get, to get inflation under control. That would be a 40% increase in the unemployment rate. So I think that's pretty interesting. I'm curious how you're advising your.
00:05:50.328 - 00:05:54.896, Speaker A: Are you seeing crypto companies get, like, what are you seeing from your portfolio in terms of the layoffs?
00:05:55.000 - 00:06:46.948, Speaker B: Well, I thought you were going to ask me in terms of deal flow, but in terms of layoffs, not so much. Um, what I have observed is it is easier for so a lot of the companies that I talk to just raise around certain position of strength, actually gotten higher. Uh, and they've found that it's a pretty interesting market because a lot of talent comes up and is available. Whereas in, you know, a year ago, it was impossible to hire, like, competent people, it's, like, super expensive and competitive. Now, um, you know, a lot of folks are looking to go elsewhere, and it's easier for these companies that are just raised around, well capitalized to go out and hire, like, really, really good talent, which I think is great. And so that's what I'm observing. I've also been more active I track, like, my average kind of check size, like my deployment cadence and all the number of deals and dollars at work.
00:06:46.948 - 00:07:11.172, Speaker B: That kind of, like, really took a hit. Over the last three months, I just wasn't seeing good deals. Not so much that the valuation wasn't there. I think there was a lot of these deals kind of came down quite a bit. It was just like, I don't know, I didn't talk to that many teams, even though they were interesting funds arounds. I wasn't part of many. Now, over the last two weeks, I've just literally committed to six new deals, one of which you actually shared with me.
00:07:11.172 - 00:07:39.598, Speaker B: So I appreciate it. But, yeah, I've seen really good, kind of like, a new wave of and crop of pretty interesting companies across the gamut of defi gaming core infrastructure. And so I'm really excited to see that and good to see founders come to the space and want to continue to build. A lot of these are first time founders in crypto, were successful outside of crypto, but are coming in, and that, to me, has always been a really positive signal.
00:07:39.686 - 00:07:52.842, Speaker A: Yeah, when you do. When, okay, so you wrote six checks in the last couple of weeks, or you plan on writing checks into these six companies. Are you doing the same size into each of these? Do you size it up based on conviction? How do you think about an angel investment?
00:07:53.018 - 00:08:33.430, Speaker B: I typically have a minimum check size that, to me, I ask for, because if I don't feel that I can do that, then to me, it just feels like I don't have enough conviction or haven't done enough work. So I try to stay disciplined at a minimum kind of threshold of dollars at work that I want to have. And then that's based on portfolio size and a bunch of other things. I sort of think of it as if a position is, if you're not willing to make a position, like, at least kind of 50 basis points or 25 basis points or 1% of your portfolio, then you're probably, you're probably, like, better off doing something else. So I try to kind of size it like that. Um, so, yeah, it's. It's at least a minimum threshold.
00:08:33.430 - 00:08:39.830, Speaker B: There are instances where I've meaningfully, like, increased, uh, that, uh, based on conviction.
00:08:39.982 - 00:09:13.428, Speaker A: Yeah. And will you. So, like, let's say, okay, so the company that I introduce you to, when you look at something like that, it sounds like you're doing it, by the way, but when you look at something like that, are you saying, okay, maybe I'll allocate my normal check size, but I have a lowest allocation that I'm comfortable with. If they can't give me the minimum check size I'm comfortable with, it's just not worth it for my time. And what is that? How do you calculate that minimum? Is it 0.25% of your 25 bits of your total portfolio, of your angel portfolio? How do you think about that?
00:09:13.516 - 00:09:57.490, Speaker B: Yeah, look, sometimes. Sometimes I really come across founders, um, that are kind of exceptional, that I really want to work with, and I align myself, like, philosophically, and I, like, I'm not hard and fast. Um, I. I obviously try to push for a minimum, but if I can't get it, like, in this case, super late in the process, he's just making it, like, squeezing me in. And so, um, I'll be very vocal about trying to get the minimum, but if I can't, then at that point, it's like, do I really want to work with this person? And, you know, I want to be a part of that journey? And so I kind of like, yeah, on certain exceptions, there are certain exceptions where I just say, look, this is a team that I really like, and I want to be a part of this story, and I'm fine, like, just getting whatever I can get.
00:09:57.642 - 00:10:20.702, Speaker A: Yeah. How do you think about the opportunity cost of doing these angel deals? So company we invested in, I think it's going to be big company, but I also think ETH is going to go up a lot. We've got the merge coming up, the opportunity cost of doing these angel deals that are illiquid, too, where maybe there's not a token coming. I feel like it's higher than ever right now. Yeah.
00:10:20.718 - 00:10:39.754, Speaker B: It's a great question because it's really hard to outperform Ethan long term. Very, very hard. I guess not all my portfolio is invested in in privates. A lot of it is illiquid. A lot of it is in early stage stuff. I just like it. I feel that's where I enjoy the most, working with teams.
00:10:39.754 - 00:11:43.316, Speaker B: But you're right, it's, you have to believe that this, whatever company you're or team you're backing will outperform, factoring in, like, applying some sort of illiquidity discount. Right. Of 20, 30%, however much you want to do it, and some sort of, sort of hurdle. If you think ETH is going to do two x, hypothetically speaking, and none of this financial ways, but hypothetically, if you think ETH is going to do a two x or a three x, then you have to clear that hurdle over whatever time horizon and be willing to take liquidity, and so you apply further discount attached to that. And so if after doing all that math, you come out and say, okay, I will outperform, then that's it. Right? The other thing that you obviously need to think about is, look, a lot of times the biggest mistakes I've made and observed other folks do is like, you spent 90% of your time building a thesis, doing research, talking to the team, and at the very end, you think about allocation and portfolio construction. And that's where most of the mistakes I've made are based.
00:11:43.316 - 00:12:29.464, Speaker B: Where I had faulty portfolio construction, meaning I was too weighted on liquid or illiquid. I didn't really think much about that. It was a great investment, but it wasn't sized big enough, so it didn't really move the needle. And look, if you think, like, if I look at my portfolio, historically, there have been, there have been, out of all the winners, I think from a absolute return, dollar wise, it's been only a handful that have really meaningfully drove that outperformance. And there were certainly times where it was a great bet it wasn't sized correctly. And I think as an investor, I always like to think, look, the odds of me continuing to perform x really go down. Like, this sort of mean reversion is very true.
00:12:29.464 - 00:13:22.820, Speaker B: And unfortunately, a lot of people in crypto are conditioned to think that a five x is like, it's like a terrible return. It's like, guys, that kind of thinking is very destructive, because if you continue to do a five x, you literally be the best investor of all time in the history of the world. That's just not going to be the case. And so, so anyways, yeah, what I'm trying to say is, portfolio construction is equally as important as doing the work and doing the research, like on the particular company. And so, yeah, look, it's an evolving kind of criteria and process. It really depends on market conditions. And for a while, for instance, for the last like nine months, you probably saw better r and r, uh, sorry, better, probably risk adjusted returns on ETH than a lot of private deals that were being funded at like north of 100 million with like no product.
00:13:22.892 - 00:14:17.294, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I am starting to get, I heard, um, the co founder of HubSpot talking about his angel investments, and, yeah, the guy's worth probably hundreds of millions, or actually probably at this point, maybe over a billion. At this point, he's done 100 plus angel deals. He'll write big check sizes, he'll write 250k check, he'll write million dollar angel checks. And his take on angel investing is it's actually, you probably will outperform it in crypto, in the public markets, you'll probably outperform your angel investments. Most people will outperform in the public markets just by buying ETH or something like that, or buying a couple of concentrated tokens that you really, really like. But the angel side of things, if you're a founder and you like to build, there's no better feeling than sitting down with these founders that you've, uh, invested in early and helping them out. And also, candidly, there's like a flex as he talks about, you know, he's like, I invested.
00:14:17.294 - 00:14:24.446, Speaker A: I was like, one of the first checks into Coinbase. Like, yeah, that's a, I made a lot of money, but, like, that's a flex that goes on the, that goes.
00:14:24.470 - 00:15:05.646, Speaker B: On the resume, you know, that's absolutely right. I mean, sometimes it is about that network and it is about that kind of insight that you can get by talking and being close to founders and teams building. For instance, you might have angled into, say, a gaming deal, not axie. Maybe it was one that wasn't as successful or not successful at all. But by virtue of you making that investment, perhaps you learned so much about the web three gaming space. What was right, what went wrong, why it didn't take off, why the game, like in game economy, is broken. That insight, had you not invested in this particular company, hypothetically, that learning, you may have never have gotten.
00:15:05.646 - 00:15:38.024, Speaker B: And so a lot of times I think, okay, if I want to get smarter on a category, I'm going to deploy x dollars of work. Say I want to learn about zero knowledge proofs. Well, of course, the universe is smaller, but maybe that's not a good example. So say I want to learn about gaming, and so I go out and invest in five different companies, ten different companies. I will deploy 25k checks, hypothetically, into all of these. And so, okay, you're putting $250,000 of work to learn about a category you think is going to be massive. So you have to believe the category is going to be huge to warrant this kind of investment as a percentage of your portfolio, whatever that sum is.
00:15:38.024 - 00:16:14.418, Speaker B: And it could be deployed into public or private companies, right? Because a lot of folks might be listening. Wait a minute, I don't have access to ten private companies. It was fine. But in crypto, the beauty is there's all these projects and discord channels you can join, right? And so you can go out and for all intents and purposes, every crypto investor right now, whether it's a token or not, is a venture capital, is an angel investor because these are super early stage projects with liquidity. And so anyways, what I'm trying to say is sometimes you're right. You want to get smart in the category, and there's. It's kind of unrealistic to assume that you're going to really pay attention to something if you don't have skin in the game.
00:16:14.418 - 00:17:02.386, Speaker B: And so, or, and the learnings that you can get from being really close to founders, not just investing privately, but also, like, just buying the token, whatever, and then joining the discord, because founders are really accessible in crypto, and that gets you ultimately smarter about a category. And so I've always found, you know, naval kind of said it best. I think there's a old tweet from him that said, look, as an angel, you kind of have to assume and be comfortable with losing, like, all of your principle understanding that, like, there might be, like, one or two really asymmetric outcomes, but even if you lose everything, it would have been worthwhile to learn and to get access to these founders that are really smart.
00:17:02.450 - 00:17:16.014, Speaker A: Yeah, I want to get your take on ETH merge and actually bitcoin for the second half of the year, and then we can jump into some of the news of the week. What is your current allocation? Bitcoin to ETH. Allocation.
00:17:20.364 - 00:17:23.104, Speaker B: Nine to one.
00:17:24.204 - 00:17:25.188, Speaker A: ETH to bitcoin.
00:17:25.236 - 00:17:45.770, Speaker B: The bitcoin to bitcoin. Yeah. I just see a very clean, compelling narrative and catalyst for ethereum, and. And I think the merge is understood, but not necessarily kind of priced in, I think. And don't ask me why. I just. I just have a feeling, like I.
00:17:45.770 - 00:18:18.538, Speaker B: I think that a lot of institutions, like, kind of understand it. But look, the merge has been kind of talked about for so many years, and, you know, every time there's, like, some commentary from the devs, Tim, or whoever about a potential delay, a lot of people are like, here we go again. This has been delayed for years. I think most people still are discounting the fact that it's actually going to go through. But I think the setup for. And this is for anyone listening here, there was a great episode that we had with Travis. Yeah, Travis, go listen to that, because I think that really covers it well.
00:18:18.538 - 00:18:39.514, Speaker B: And I believe in most of what is discussed there. Look, it's not to say that I don't believe in bitcoin. It's just, to me, I always think of, okay, what's the catalyst? And there's a very compelling, strong catalyst for Ethereum that I don't think is wholly properly understood by kind of the majority of the market participants out there.
00:18:39.674 - 00:18:56.666, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. Interesting. Do you think, do you think it's like a bitcoin having event where maybe like the price doesn't actually move that much post having, but maybe like a year usually at the having, like the price doesn't rip it at the having, it's like maybe it takes six or.
00:18:56.690 - 00:18:58.458, Speaker B: Nine or twelve months, like three, six months after.
00:18:58.506 - 00:19:01.794, Speaker A: Right. Yeah. Yeah. You think? We like a lot of people.
00:19:01.834 - 00:19:08.464, Speaker B: A lot of people. There's always this idea that like bitcoin happenings, this one, it's like the next bitcoin happening will be priced in and historically it hasn't.
00:19:08.504 - 00:19:08.824, Speaker A: Right.
00:19:08.904 - 00:19:12.176, Speaker B: You never have this phenomenon, other correlation.
00:19:12.320 - 00:19:27.964, Speaker A: Like tell me, tell me the price action of ether. Do you think we maybe it's like buy the rumor, sell the news. It's like we kind of rip into the merge, it sells off and then we kind of consolidate around for several months and that, and then it, and then the merge gets priced in whatever.
00:19:28.584 - 00:20:27.910, Speaker B: It's like taking out a crystal ball because I have no idea. I think you become less of a gambler and more of a speculator if you have a longer than one year time horizon. So whatever Ethereum does in the near term likely will be correlated, likely will kind of trail. If we're continue to be in this macro uncertainty backdrop, then I think the merges, while very interesting catalyst will take a backseat and macro, macro still is front seat in a lot of markets. They're still jittery, they still trade around whether Pelosi is going to Taiwan or gas prices and whatever happens in Europe. And so I think there's earnings season, people are still looking at that and then everything else kind of moves according to that, which it means if you're a patient long term investor, it's kind of a great setup when you think about it because you know this is coming. Whether market participants want to pay attention to it, they're probably going to be really distracted for the rest of the year.
00:20:27.910 - 00:20:37.246, Speaker B: And so I always like to think of these moments as like you're never, you can never really play a short game because you're really going to get, you're really going to get carried away.
00:20:37.430 - 00:20:37.894, Speaker A: Right.
00:20:37.974 - 00:21:15.174, Speaker B: And that's where you really mess up. But if you say, look, the merge has been something that is going to be very net positive for Ethereum long term. It will further credentialize the fact that this is a network that can upgrade, that can execute on the roadmap that has been discussed for a long time. And it's very interesting from an ESG narrative perspective. And then I think if you see that, then you kind of observe and cost average. Like what I would do, what I'm doing is I always kind of like build conviction and accordingly allocate. It's not that I'm doing it all at once.
00:21:15.174 - 00:22:07.768, Speaker B: And I feel good about these entry points over a two, it, three, four or five year horizon. Like I don't know, like hopefully folks listening here, like I'm never in a position like, you know, do when I do liquid stuff and I try not to do as much because I know I'm terrible at timing it. And we can talk about like even some like Cathie Wood super sophisticated I think has one of the best research shops and out there has been really right about calling certain like macro technological trends, whether it's Tesla and you know, batteries and electric vehicles and or genetics and like stuff like CRISPR and certainly crypto. She punched out a Coinbase literally on the 27 July and Coinbase is up almost 100%. Like so like, yeah, you never.
00:22:07.896 - 00:22:20.456, Speaker A: Anyway, I know what an amazing hedge fund that I know. That's very. They're quite successful. They texted me a week ago and said we're. We're putting on a big short on Coinbase. What are you guys doing? They're like, we're putting big short on Coinbase. I don't know.
00:22:20.456 - 00:22:40.016, Speaker A: It's already down a lot. They're like, no, we got. It's like it was right after the NFT video that they launched, the bored ape video. They're like, this is ridiculous. Like they're clearly wasting so much money. Put on a big short and yeah, even the best, even the best traders have no idea what's happening in the short term. I will say I am getting very bullish on things right now.
00:22:40.016 - 00:23:18.152, Speaker A: I had two conversations that have made this week that have made me rethink what this bear market will look like. I've previously been thinking that this is going to be a long and maybe a deep bear market. Again, I had two conversations with one, one of the biggest market makers in the world and then B, the second one was the head of crypto, one of the largest financial institutions in the world. They are both pushing deeper into crypto right now. They are not backing off. They're both doubling down. And I was really surprised to hear that push at them a little and probe and see if they're actually doing that.
00:23:18.152 - 00:23:31.920, Speaker A: They are leaning into the merge, and they're really excited internally. And that made me think that it's only two conversations. It's completely anecdotal, but that made me think that this bear market might be a little more shallow, a little less intense than I originally thought.
00:23:32.032 - 00:24:10.304, Speaker B: Yeah, hope that's the case. The institutions are coming has been a narrative that has been ongoing in crypto, and we're still here. But you're right. I mean, I do sense a lot of the discussions I've had over the last two years are smart investors that haven't allocated to crypto, that see the merge and are tracking it, and have done a lot of work over the last couple of years to understand the implications that that has on the Ethereum network. So I think people are ready to execute on it, and a lot of them might just be kind of waiting for this to go live, to really go back to their investment committee and say, okay, it's here, let's go.
00:24:10.384 - 00:24:34.640, Speaker A: Yeah. Speaking of institutions, I forgot to plug our conference the last three weeks, and our team keeps getting really pissed at me. We are hosting digital asset summit September 13 and 14th. We have a competition going on internally. Santi, whoever drives the most tickets using their discount code gets a free dinner. And I want that free dinner. So you can use Yano 250 to get $250 off.
00:24:34.640 - 00:24:35.644, Speaker A: There's the plug.
00:24:36.984 - 00:24:39.616, Speaker B: No, this is New York or London because you do.
00:24:39.680 - 00:25:04.924, Speaker A: This is New York. It's actually really interesting what we've put together. So permissionless, very crypto native event. Das. We have put together an event that combines the macro with the crypto. We have folks like Rob Leshner and Amy Wu at FTX, and Mickey at Paradigm, and Antonio, the founder of Dydx. But then we also have Jurian Timorer, the head of macro fidelity, with Brent Johnson, Danielle DeMartino Booth, Mark Usko.
00:25:04.924 - 00:25:27.160, Speaker A: Like a really, really, really interesting macro crowd. And so it's like, I don't think there's ever been an event that puts Mike Green and Brent Johnson and Danielle DeMartino Booth on the same stage as Michael Shalov and Rebecca Redig and Danielle DiMartino and Rob Leshner and some of these deep crypto folks. I think it'll be a really interesting event, actually.
00:25:27.272 - 00:25:28.000, Speaker B: Nice.
00:25:28.192 - 00:25:31.782, Speaker A: That's great. Yeah, it should be good. Maybe you'll show this time.
00:25:31.928 - 00:25:51.778, Speaker B: Oh, maybe. Yeah, yeah. I won't make any promises, given how constrained air traffic is these days in travel. But certainly I'm messing with. I think a lot of the tourism flow is going the other way, which is Americans trying to go to Europe because the euro is kind of really low. But nonetheless, we can be.
00:25:51.866 - 00:25:55.894, Speaker A: That's true. All right. All right. Now that the plug is out of the way, we can talk about the hacks.
00:25:56.674 - 00:26:00.236, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. Let's definitely talk about the Solana hype.
00:26:00.420 - 00:26:20.916, Speaker A: Yeah, you want to start with Solana, you said? Yeah, yeah, let's start with Solana. We'll also talk about Nomad. I will say people are calling this the Solana hack. I think it should really be called the slope failure. This was, you know, a lot of people are saying this is the Solana hack. Really? So here's what happened. On Wednesday morning, there's fear started to spread through the Solana ecosystem.
00:26:20.916 - 00:26:41.328, Speaker A: Thousands of users started reporting that their wallets were drained without any approval. I think the final number is that over 7000. I think it was like 77 or 7800 wallets were hit by. Yeah, we're hit by hackers now. It's a relatively small number, like out of 25 million. There are about 25 million users on the Solana network, or wallets. So it's 7000 or 8000 out of 25 million.
00:26:41.328 - 00:27:08.514, Speaker A: But still that's 7700 more than should happen. About $5 million were drained. So we'll talk about the nomad hack. Nomad was 190 million. This was only 5 million. Anatoly, the CEO of Solana Labs, said it looked like a supply chain attack on iOS based wallets, which what a supply chain attack is. For those who don't know, supply chain attacks happen when a hacker basically enters and modifies software by injecting malicious code in a system.
00:27:08.514 - 00:27:57.080, Speaker A: The code inserts can be employed to deliver a malicious payload or backdoor malware. In Solana's case, what Anatoly said is that it's possible that a hacker attacked the iOS wallet libraries to extract private keys. I think what ended up coming out today or yesterday is that what really happened there is that this was not a Solana protocol failure, but it was actually connected to Slope, which is a Solana based wallet. Slope stores their users. I think this is either a theory or maybe it's been confirmed, but Slope stores their user seed phrases in plain text on servers. What they do is you've got the wallet app. They were sending user seed phrases to a centralized server that could then be read like the phrases were not encrypted.
00:27:57.080 - 00:28:20.418, Speaker A: So anybody with access to the specific server could potentially access users private keys. And I think this really, that is a low security standard. It actually makes me concerned of like, I know this is a low security standard. I bet other folks are doing this, though. The low security standard probably led to the breach, which gave hackers the ability to acquire the seed phrases and drain funds. So that's the overview.
00:28:20.506 - 00:28:42.834, Speaker B: That's great overview. I woke up and I was monitoring this like, like crazy, because for a while I, you didn't know what was really going on. There were, most of the user were salon, but there was a few like theorem wallets, there's some ETH ones, there was some ethereum ones too. And so you started then. I think there was some really good folks that you should go out and follow when all this goes, goes on. Samsung, obviously he was not as vocal in this time. He was very vocal.
00:28:42.834 - 00:29:41.586, Speaker B: Nomad Adam, what's his name, Korsharan, he was tracking this a lot. I think he talked to a lot of users that had their wallets drained to understand kind of the, the profile of the user that it, that was being exploited. And, you know, over the ensuing, kind of like twelve to 16 hours, they very quickly said, okay, everyone here has like use slope and, or imported their private key into slope. And so that kind of like, it was great to see the developer community come together to kind of get to the bottom of it. Not so great seeing folks really jump the gun quickly and dunk on something. Solana say, oh, here we go. You know, this is why Solana is crap, you know, and I think that you, I pay attention to the kind of folks that do that because, you know, it's, look, at the end of the day, we'll talk about Nomad in a second.
00:29:41.586 - 00:30:13.604, Speaker B: But from a sheer magnitude, dollars that have been lost, I mean, Nomad was orders of magnitude higher. And so, and that was just like solidity code like issue. And so, yeah, look, I mean, I think I take this opportunity to tell users, like, the most important thing, the takeaway, when you see these kind of incidents, hopefully no one was affected. Um, it are two things. One, get a hardware wallet. Just don't trade convenience for security. Like, security is paramount.
00:30:13.604 - 00:30:48.824, Speaker B: Um, and I don't care what anyone says, just go get a hardware wallet. If you're, if you have more than $100 at work in crypto, go get a hardware wallet that costs like 50, $60. You'll understand about security. You, you'll, it's, it's not easy to, to use, but take it as a learning. Like, it's not like super intuitive at first, but then it becomes very easy once you get the hang of it. And I think it's a very worthwhile time and money investment to understand security. Like, if you're bullish on crypto and you really want to start allocating your time and attention and energy and money, like, trust me, it will pay off.
00:30:48.824 - 00:31:06.164, Speaker B: Like, it will pay dividends just having a hardware wallet get one. 2310. I don't care. Related to this. There's a few accounts that I think we should link here in the notes that I think provide really good security, like, best practices. The founder of. What is it, my crypto.
00:31:06.744 - 00:31:12.644, Speaker A: We'll put together some stuff yet. Tay did something. Bobby ong at Queen Gecko did something.
00:31:13.024 - 00:31:45.218, Speaker B: Tay is one of the more, like, very outspoken, like, will not hold back, which he thinks and provides really comprehensive threads about security, and I recommend following her. And so, anyways, that was. I'm glad that we got to the bottom of this pretty quickly, because it could have been way worse, and it wasn't. It wasn't a salon of failure. It wasn't. It was just simply devs not being very cautious and, like, adopting terrible practices and copying libraries and not really understanding what they're doing.
00:31:45.346 - 00:31:55.986, Speaker A: Yeah. So this was a. This was a private key. So the private keys were compromised here. Right. This was not like a phishing scam. This was not like, malicious approval and smart contracts.
00:31:55.986 - 00:32:00.886, Speaker A: This was just a. A private key compromise through these centralized servers. Yeah.
00:32:00.910 - 00:32:19.734, Speaker B: Like, when you generate a key with slope or you import a key, a private key through slope, they were just, like, storing that in plain text. If there's one thing that you need to do as a wallet, like, seriously, is, like, make sure that whatever you do, you just don't store in a third party. This is the most important.
00:32:19.894 - 00:32:28.140, Speaker A: Or even if you do store in a third party, which you really shouldn't be doing, they have to be encrypted. There has to be some sort of encryption there. I think they're just storing them in plain text.
00:32:28.212 - 00:33:06.714, Speaker B: Yeah, this is, like, the very top of the things that you need to do as a wallet developer and be focused on is not doing this. And they did that. So it was also, like, pretty disappointing to see their statement. Like, their post mortem was, like, it wasn't sufficiently clear to users that they should, if they had created an account, to create a new private key outside of slope and migrate their assets immediately. Like, this should have been in plain red text, and it was not. And I understand they might be, like, worried about being sued, which they probably will, but still, like, God damn it, guys. Like, protect your users.
00:33:06.714 - 00:33:27.734, Speaker B: Like, what are you guys doing so anyways, this is, like, gross negligence in my mind. Like, it's okay. Look, as a developer, you're gonna. There are things that you may. There are other hacks where, like, some of the stuff, the surface area is pretty complex. If you're doing a bridge, like, bridges are very hard. And in this case, I just think, like, whatever it is, just own up to it and protect users.
00:33:27.734 - 00:33:42.750, Speaker B: Like, make sure that you mitigate and contain it as soon as possible. And communicating to users clearly and allowing them to kind of take the necessary steps to protect themselves is paramount. And I didn't see that in the press release, candidly.
00:33:42.822 - 00:33:43.046, Speaker A: It was.
00:33:43.070 - 00:33:44.222, Speaker B: It was, like, very underwhelming.
00:33:44.318 - 00:33:53.686, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. So I have a. I have a. Maybe a second order impact. I think this is, um. This feels, like, pretty bullish for Solana, actually.
00:33:53.686 - 00:34:10.250, Speaker A: I don't. I don't know. Like, there's. There's a crazy amount of adversity that Solana has gone through recently. It's like, you've got these, like, I feel like a lot of it, like, wormhole. You've got, like, these bridge hacks and deep, like, the defi app hacks and wallet hacks. You had, like, a lot of performance issues.
00:34:10.250 - 00:34:29.130, Speaker A: You had, like, stability issues. The network kept going down. You have these, like, decentralization narratives about how the network's not decentralized. You have all these other l one's, like, aptos and Sui are rising. A lot of attention being on, like, cosmos right now and things like that. It's a non evm ecosystem. But, you know, I'm looking at the price right now.
00:34:29.130 - 00:34:47.374, Speaker A: It is still. It. It is still hovering around $40, like, for the last three months. No, two months. This thing is, like, refuses to go below 35. I mean, maybe Sam's just got, like, a fat finger bid sitting at 35. But, yeah, it's pretty interesting that it hasn't gone down more.
00:34:47.374 - 00:34:47.774, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:34:47.814 - 00:35:05.462, Speaker B: There's a very interesting tweet from Raj, one of the co founders of Solana. It says, like, this further solidifies the case to have a Solana based phone. And I'm not an expert on, like, hardware, like, secure enclaves or whatever, but, like, the idea Anatolia had a tweet and we should bring him on to really talk about the Solana phone, because I think it would be interesting.
00:35:05.478 - 00:35:06.182, Speaker A: He's coming on answers.
00:35:06.238 - 00:35:31.474, Speaker B: He's coming on because a lot of this might just, like, if you think about, okay, going forward, like, how can we really mitigate these type of things in some capacity? It's just the hardware device and what you could do if you're interacting on mobile. And so I think it sets us up for an interesting discussion around the Solana phone and why it's actually necessary. And I think this hack further kind of supports that thesis.
00:35:31.554 - 00:35:51.706, Speaker A: All right, folks, this episode is brought to you by our friends at Avalanche and Ava Labs. They have just dropped a new crypto wallet called Core. You're going to be hearing a lot about it over the coming months. You can now be one of the first to try it out. Here's the reason I'm excited to partner with them on Empire right now. Crypto wallets and browser extensions, they feel clunky. They feel non intuitive.
00:35:51.706 - 00:36:19.138, Speaker A: That's why Ava Labs built Core. It's a free, non custodial browser extension that gives avalanche users a seamless and secure web three experience across the entire avalanche ecosystem. Here are a few reasons to try core. Here's what I'm experimenting with. Number one, Core has intuitive dashboards with a unified display for all of your NFT collections, all your crypto assets. You can execute asset swaps directly inside the wallet. It's a really nice experience.
00:36:19.138 - 00:36:47.738, Speaker A: Experience. Maybe you want to earn, yield or borrow against your bitcoin, but you don't want to do it on one of those c five platforms. Right now, core's native bridging functionality makes it really easy to bridge your bitcoin to avalanche's robust defi ecosystem. Last but not least, core makes on ramping super easy. You can convert dollars to crypto right now using the moonpay integration. Just takes a few clicks. Download core today using the link in the show notes.
00:36:47.738 - 00:37:03.130, Speaker A: It's really, really nice. If you are interested in the avalanche ecosystem at all, you have to be using core. Download core using the link below. Now let's get back to the show. Yeah, yeah. All right. Should we talk about Nomad?
00:37:03.322 - 00:37:04.094, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:37:05.394 - 00:37:45.106, Speaker A: All right, so let me, I'll do my best to try to explain this, but jump in where I'm missing things. So Nomad is. Nomad is a bridge. Nomad is kind of the bridge for like Evmos moonbeam milk o meta, which I don't even know what milk o meta is, but maybe I should. They were hacked on Monday for over $190 million. Basically their cross chain bridge that supports token transfers across like ETH moonbeam avalanche, they raised, I think it was $22 million earlier this year from folks like OpenSea, Coinbase and other corporates and also some crypto native VC's. What happened with Nomad and I'll try to do my best here.
00:37:45.106 - 00:38:26.706, Speaker A: But again, fill in the gaps is there was a previous protocol upgrade led to a vulnerability that basically enabled hackers to withdraw an unlimited amount of funds from the bridge. So after this hacker realized this and initiated these large transfers, I think it was like 300 other users copy pasted those transaction scripts, replaced the receiver address with their own, and basically started to exploit it as well. This was, I think, a smart contract exploit. I think it was. Samson explained it like this. I can just quote him because he broke it down way better than I ever could. The bug came from the developers erroneously modifying the bridge's smart contract and deploying the code without proper audit.
00:38:26.706 - 00:39:01.206, Speaker A: The Nomad bridge hack. Oh, this is the important part. The Nomad bridgehack is made possible due to an improper initialization leading to the zero address. So zero x zero zero being marked as a trusted route, which led to every message being proven valid by default. So, basically, what this means is that marking it as zero x zero zero, also called a zero address, accidentally turned off a smart contract check that ensured that withdrawals were made to valid addresses only. So after it was turned off, you could, essentially, anyone could withdraw funds from the bridge if they wanted. So this.
00:39:01.206 - 00:39:30.452, Speaker A: It's interesting. Like, this is a lot of money, 190 million. The exploit didn't require any advanced technical knowledge of smart contracts or anything like that. All you had to do was basically just edit the hacker's transaction with etherscan, replace the destination address with your own address, and then make the withdrawal request from the nomad bridge. Yeah, I mean, when you put it like that, it's no wonder that there's this feeding frenzy of hundreds of bad actors here who pulled a total of 190 million out.
00:39:30.548 - 00:39:46.270, Speaker B: There were some folks that were white hacking this, so they saw this, and then they, like, quickly use the same transaction, modify the withdrawal address, and then kind of try to, you know, do that to safeguard funds. And then some of them, only those.
00:39:46.302 - 00:39:51.790, Speaker A: Only nine. I. So that they did, like, they did do that, their white hat hackers, but there's only 9 million, so.
00:39:51.862 - 00:39:55.634, Speaker B: Yeah, so far. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I agree.
00:39:57.094 - 00:39:57.382, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:39:57.398 - 00:39:58.034, Speaker B: I think.
00:39:58.374 - 00:40:15.874, Speaker A: What was that third biggest hack of the year? I think Ronin was 625. Wormhole was 325 or 326. I guess Harmony Bridge was 100 million. There was the. I mean, the poly network was 611, but that was different.
00:40:15.954 - 00:40:34.736, Speaker B: Yeah. Before we move away from these hacks, I found an interesting use case for nfts in the Solana. And what is it, the. I don't want to call it the Solana hack but nonetheless, the, what is it, the sledge we should edit.
00:40:34.800 - 00:40:35.312, Speaker A: Slope.
00:40:35.408 - 00:41:30.030, Speaker B: Slope. I found an interesting use case for nfts related to the slow pack, which was this. There was a person that sent an NFT that was hosted on a prize, like on a specific domain to the hacker wallet and was waiting for them to open the NFT. And then that would, like, that would reveal the IP address, presumably of the hacker. Of course, if you were monitoring the address and you open it up in your computer, it would have, like, it's not the hacker, but it's an interesting way to, like, triangulate around IP addresses behind a wallet with nfts. And I think this is in large part why you get a lot of these kind of spam nfts sent to your wallet that you don't see in Opensea. But, um, but also going forward, you can envision like traditional companies imagine saying, hey, I want to understand where most of the board apes are.
00:41:30.030 - 00:41:51.764, Speaker B: And if you're a high end business in New York, all of a sudden you understand which wallet, like, like, you can retarget these people. And so at the end of the day, nfts are the cookies of web three. And I guess it's important to use a VPN all the time if you care about like, you know, just folks, not like trying to understand where you're based.
00:41:51.924 - 00:42:33.980, Speaker A: Yeah, nFts are the cookies of web three. I completely agree with that. I think what will end up happening is not just around ips, but actually just like movement of capital on chain. So, like, let's say someone goes through an onboarding solution like Moonpay or like Kado or something like that. What one of those folks could do is like, drop an NFT, basically could like give an NFT to that user once they onboard. Um, and they can essentially, I think what they could, what they could do is they could keep, I mean, one, once you're basically onboarded through one of those folks, they can see your movement of capital essentially forever, unless you put it through like a tornado or something like that. They could keep dropping nfts into your wallet once you like.
00:42:33.980 - 00:42:55.848, Speaker A: Let's say they see that you've made like 50 transactions inside the Solana ecosystem. They partner with Solana and they drop you like a Solana 50 activity NFT. And then other folks, and other folks can be like, oh, who owns that NFT? Let me target you. And I think this ends up leading into a web three CRM that we'll 100%.
00:42:55.896 - 00:43:39.964, Speaker B: So imagine this. Pick whatever event that you go say you went to a stadium or a music concert, and in that event, you can middle the event is a scan this QR code potentially to win a sweepstake or whatever. You scan the code, you get an NFT of proof of attendance, if you will. If you're smart, maybe you just want to use a burner wallet. You know, whatever, say a subset of users just uses their only wallet. And then all of a sudden, that event organizer, artist, sports company, whatever, now has really interesting data on who attended and what the preferences are, what kind of nfts you're buying. Of course, now it's like, you know, you could, you can infer so many things just now.
00:43:39.964 - 00:44:13.620, Speaker B: Imagine we have limited time of a lot of these users, but really rich data. And at the end of day, blockchains are data rich. And so imagine how much more data is going to exponentially rise over the next ten years of users just may have one or two wallets, or wallets that can be easily linked through stuff like chain analysis. And look, for a lot of people out there, it's like, oh, my God, this is like panopticon. This is like big brother. This is what you don't want to hear, but it's just a reality, right? And so again, privacy is one of the things that is important in crypto, but nfts make it. Make it hard.
00:44:13.732 - 00:44:39.088, Speaker A: Yeah. Here's a product request, if there are any entrepreneurs listening to. This is. So when we launch permus, we launched permis 555 nfts. That basically got you access to permissionless and a whole bunch and our research platform and a whole bunch of other stuff. I manually would go in and look at the address of the people who had bought the permes, and it tells you really interesting things. You're like, oh, okay, this permy whale is also like a doodle's whale.
00:44:39.088 - 00:45:29.608, Speaker A: So it turns out, like, we had a lot of folks who hold doodles who also hold Permes. We had a lot of, like, bored ape folks who also held permes. And it gives you some really interesting insight because it's like, okay, if you can see that, let's say, I don't know, moonbirds holders, there's a massive crossover between moon birds and permes. Well, then you can do a collab that tells us, our marketing team, that we should then do a collab with moonbirds, right? Or let's say we see that the permes holders, there are like, no whales, right? Maybe there's just like a bunch of, like, really, really, really small. Uh, each person has, like, less than a thousand or like one ETH in their account or something like that. Like you want to market to those folks very differently and talk to those folks very differently than if everyone who holds a permit has like 50 ETH, for example. So anyone who can like I think this is, I think this is a huge platform.
00:45:29.608 - 00:45:32.848, Speaker A: I think this web three CRM is, will, will be really really big.
00:45:32.936 - 00:45:47.416, Speaker B: And feel free to answer this question or not. But you looked at this data. Did you go back to like some of the sponsors or organize and say hey listen, the average transaction value of the people attending permissionless is x and so you better give me a discount on y or something like that?
00:45:47.520 - 00:45:50.608, Speaker A: I mean this will branch, we didn't, but we should have.
00:45:50.696 - 00:46:15.396, Speaker B: Maybe should just hire me to run your growth hacking. I'm kidding. Web three growth hacking. Look, every time I tweet about this there are very vocal people that say God, this is not why we design web three like this is, this is terrible. This is the police state, big brother. I'm like guys, it's just, it's just in a reality, whether you want to see it or not and whether you want to be cautious or not and take precautions, that's up to you. Right?
00:46:15.500 - 00:46:41.826, Speaker A: Bridges, you want to talk synapse? I want to talk synapse chain, which I think was a pretty interesting announcement. I don't know if you saw that. Here, let me get. Maybe it's helpful to have a quick primer on bridges. So basically bridges are bridges move assets between chains. If I want to move some capital from Solana into ethereum, that's technically really, really challenging. So I need a bridge to do that.
00:46:41.826 - 00:47:24.500, Speaker A: Bridges can be classified into trustless bridges and trusted bridges. The latter means that the bridge relies on a centralized entity to function. The, the former means that the bridge relies on smart contracts. So for trusted bridges, users need to trust the security and good faith reputation of decentralized custodians. The risks are centralized entities going rogue and kind of this incompetent security management which we're seeing play out with some of this stuff like slope. For trustless bridges, users need to trust the security of the underlying blockchain and the smart contracts written on top to enable the functionalities of the bridge. The risks are like badly written code, social engineering or new vector attacks that were previously overlooked.
00:47:24.500 - 00:47:51.884, Speaker A: So that's, I think bridges will end up, I think bridges are a really, really really crucial aspect of crypto. As everything goes, goes multi chain, they're also clearly the hardest thing to build. Technically. We've had over a billion dollars in bridging hacks. But I think maybe one of the problems is that users actually shouldn't be interacting with bridges. I feel like bridges should just be like completely behind the scenes. Nobody ever knows that they're using a bridge.
00:47:51.884 - 00:47:54.864, Speaker A: I feel like that's where the future of bridges go.
00:47:54.984 - 00:49:12.382, Speaker B: Yeah, it is. It's pretty hard at a very high level. You have two different networks, blockchains, if you will, that have different security levels, levels of security. And the bridge is essentially connecting these two, trying to get some finality on the transfer, the state transition. Like, if you're moving one asset or messaging or whatever, generally that is recorded in the blockchain and one on one side to the other through the bridge, then that needs to be recorded on both sides, both which have different levels of security and finality, and both from a time perspective and quality of like, of the security itself. And so the bridge is kind of a lot of need to figure out that out, which is very complex, and, and so sometimes require like a trusted, like a system of relayers, if you will, in the bridge that are doing this and taking some risk and being compensated for that. Um, and, and so that's kind of like, it's probably, as you said, which I would agree, it's one of the more complex things, um, in, in crypto, at least now, because it has a lot of surface area, meaning like there's a lot of different kind of components need to work, and it requires a lot of.
00:49:12.382 - 00:49:44.972, Speaker B: I think they're kind of like bridges and zero knowledge proofs are heavily researched. But I would characterize as one of the more kind of ambitious on the roadmap of things in cryptography that need to be figured out. And so, but to your point, I think both are kind of will work at some point or are critical for the functioning of where at least I see, and I think you see crypto evolving, which is, it's a multi chain world and one that allows for massive scalability through xenonauts proofs and multi chain through bridges.
00:49:45.068 - 00:49:58.732, Speaker A: Yeah. There's an interesting bridge announcement last. No, was it this week? Earlier this week with Synapse. Right. Synapse is launching their. I don't know, you call it l. One maybe, or smart contract ecosystem, I don't know.
00:49:58.732 - 00:50:22.950, Speaker A: Basically, synapse is one of the biggest bridges. So they're a cross chain protocol that is best known for the bridge. They have a synapse bridge. They also have, um. Uh, the, the bridge consists of the synapse network and the synapse cross chain amm, um, they're one of the market leaders right now. So they have weekly volume around like 20 million. I think it's on par with like wormhole, which is around 25 million.
00:50:22.950 - 00:50:55.984, Speaker A: It's ahead of other bridges like hop or stargate. Um, synapse for folks who've been around for a while, uh, probably remember them as nerve. They started as a stable swap amm on the binance smart chain, which just goes to show you how much folks can pivot. And they really started as like a gateway for moving assets between ETH and binance smart chain. Anyways, why are we talking about Synapse? They are one of the most popular bridges. They revealed earlier this week, or end of last week, that they're going to be one of the first, maybe the first bridging protocol to actually develop their own smart contract platform. So they're calling it synapse chain.
00:50:55.984 - 00:51:43.790, Speaker A: And I don't know, I think it's a pretty interesting conversation around. One of the main problems that many teams building cross chain applications are facing today is the lack of a single execution environment. So instead what they have to do is they have to deploy smart contracts on several different chains. This ends up increasing security risks, communication barriers, development needs, et cetera. Unlike those existing systems and how things are built today with synapses chain, the way I understand it today is it enables developers to build a cross chain smart contract exclusively on the synapse chain. Build apps can get built on the synapse chain. They can then execute that logic across any blockchain and then the finality happens on Ethereum.
00:51:43.790 - 00:51:58.874, Speaker A: I think it's pretty interesting. It's compatible with EVM. It enables any existing app to be deployed on Synapse chain, gives developers a similar building experience to any other EVM chain, but allows you to build a cross chain application. I think it's.
00:52:00.494 - 00:52:03.968, Speaker B: They actually reached out to me last week and we can get them on the plan.
00:52:04.056 - 00:52:24.224, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, we had the biggest competitor to this is probably Layer Zero. We had Brian on the podcast. The way I understand Layer Zero is this is a very direct competitor to it. Layer Zero raised what they raised at a $3 billion valuation. Bunch of money, obviously. Very hot project. I think Layer Zero competes directly with this.
00:52:24.224 - 00:52:52.318, Speaker A: So. Yeah, interesting. Yeah, I will say Synapse blockworks research had the alpha. I have to plug this. We wrote a piece on this saying synapse is going to be doing this. We wrote it July 14 and recommended that the synapse that like syn, is maybe interesting, as Synapse ends up launching their chain. And so, yeah, we had the alpha two weeks, two weeks before it was live, and Synapse token did pop 50% on the day it announced.
00:52:52.366 - 00:52:57.356, Speaker B: So how many, as an aside, how many guys do you have on your research team?
00:52:57.550 - 00:53:02.648, Speaker A: We have a eight person research team now, seven person.
00:53:02.696 - 00:53:09.912, Speaker B: They have any full liberty to go out and research whatever they want. There's like a director?
00:53:10.048 - 00:53:51.716, Speaker A: No, actually, each analyst, the way that we've set everything up is each analyst has covers only two or three different protocols. And so instead of, we think, other maybe research folks in crypto have made the mistake of being way, way, way too wide. And they try to cover everything in crypto and like, all right, there's nfts popping up, boom, we're going to go race and try to cover that. Like, we are hyper focused on DeFi right now. And so each of our analysts just covers two or three or maybe four things. And what like coverage means is like, they're in the discord, they're on the governance forums, they know everyone at the protocols, and because of that, we can give hopefully a lot of alpha through the platform.
00:53:51.820 - 00:53:53.704, Speaker B: So that's great.
00:53:54.134 - 00:53:58.126, Speaker A: I'll get you access. If you're a permit holder, you actually get it.
00:53:58.150 - 00:54:00.390, Speaker B: Oh, there you go. Yeah, I'd love to check it out.
00:54:00.542 - 00:54:38.514, Speaker A: Yeah, cool. I had a thought while reading about the synapse chain, which is in CEFi. All apps end up converging to become a bank. So if you look at, no matter if you start with, there's all these companies that start as custodians like anchorage and Bitgo and copper and folks like that. Uh, then there's like Blockfi and, well, you know that some of the borrow and lend platforms didn't end up making it too much. But like the blockfi's of the world, then there's like Coinbase and Gemini, they all basically end up looking like a bank in DeFi, it feels like everyone is building their own chains. Everyone's building like, Aave launched their own stablecoin, Synapse.
00:54:38.514 - 00:54:58.464, Speaker A: They started like, Aave starts as a borrow lend platform, they launched their own stable, Synapse starts as a bridge. Now they're launching their own smart contract platform, they have their own ammo. It feels like everyone in DeFi is now starting to like, I don't know the right word. If CeFi converges and everyone creates a bank, defi converges, everyone creates an ecosystem.
00:54:59.404 - 00:55:03.464, Speaker B: A vertically integrated, decentralized, stable coin that eventually collapsed. No, I'm kidding.
00:55:04.724 - 00:55:06.104, Speaker A: Do you know what I'm saying though?
00:55:06.684 - 00:55:39.684, Speaker B: I do. It's sort of like this idea of like it is common at times to be vertically integrated and or horizontally. The thing though is it's hard to make the analogy, I think, because, well, I'm going to say two things. One is, in crypto, this idea of composability is really powerful because you have apps connecting and talking to each other in a very seamless kind of atomic way. You don't have that in web two. Composability is like the 8th wonder of the world, if you will. It sort of obliviates the need.
00:55:39.684 - 00:57:12.646, Speaker B: The simple thesis for DeFi is if you look at what plaid this company that is trying to stitch together financial applications, one application that you have on your phone, your bank of America app, talks to another app, like Venmo, if you will, and be able to do that seamlessly or seamlessly in the front end, they try to patch this kind of very disparate, convoluted, complex patchwork of financial applications and services that have been created since the modern age, if you will. Web two with the Internet, and even preceding the Internet, it's very bare bones because it's like trying to patch together stuff that will never talk to something that is redesigned from scratch from the bottom up, that just talks with each other seamlessly. Composability is what makes DeFi amazing and super powerful. And it's sort of like you don't need these kind of like connectors, if you will, that lose, there's a lot of friction still. And so that's why DeFi is so powerful, but still. I just was talking to a company earlier, actually the one that you introduced me to these guys saying, okay, listen, if you want to build and integrate with DeFi protocol, so say that you're a bank, which it will happen if you're a financial institution, Robinhood or whatever, PayPal or what have you, they want to integrate with DeFi. It's actually quite hard to plug into all these protocols because the documentation is not necessarily there.
00:57:12.646 - 00:58:10.894, Speaker B: If there's upgrades from Aave two to v three or whatever, it requires a lot of know how and complexity to do that. And so that's what I mean by like you're still going to probably have these kind of, let's call middleware solutions connector solutions that allow non web three native solutions, or maybe front ends like user aggregators, to stitch together and connect to this very composable ecosystem. Because it's not necessarily easy for banks to do that. Or some other application. That's one idea. The other thing is we've talked about this in prior gaming episodes, which is at the end of the day, maybe what is an interesting phenomenon happening is a lot of games will maybe roll out their entire suite of Defi and l one. Like, like something like Stepn, for instance, is now the number one Dex in Solana.
00:58:10.894 - 00:58:45.644, Speaker B: Why? Because it has all the users. Like if you look at the, there's a great tweet. We'll link it in the show notes. But like overnight it, well, not overnight, but like, because Stebbin has become a very popular app. Be a number of users. It is naturally interesting, if you're the team, to say, why don't we just build our own apps and control the experience for the user and maybe even go out as far as creating an l one because, hey, Solana keeps going down or it's not supporting us. So it keeps breaking, if you will, just the virtue of the amount of demand.
00:58:45.644 - 00:59:45.686, Speaker B: That's, I think what is informing a lot of these product choices of these teams. It say, hey, listen, it's not kind of tailor made, it's not fulfilling our needs. And so let's go out and build a Dex or a lending protocol or a stable coin. And so, but I would say like the last thing we'll say on this is I don't think we're going to see the same level of kind of consolidation, vertical or integration, vertical integration in web three, generally, even though you've seen companies like, you know, Yuga Labs try to do a lot, they built a game and they're going to build other stuff. I'm still of the mind that there are advantages of using a settlement layer like Ethereum, which is much farther along, much proven, much benefits from what I do think is a network effect of an ecosystem of developers and applications that you can plug into seamlessly or through.
00:59:45.830 - 01:00:07.810, Speaker A: EVM compatibility, I think that's a really good take. Let's move on to another ecosystem announcement this week, which was Magic Eden. So Opensea. Opensea is the biggest ethereum NFT marketplace. Magic Eden is the top Solana NFT marketplace. They have 90% of Solana's NFT market share. They announced that.
01:00:07.810 - 01:00:14.552, Speaker A: So back in April, Opensea integrated with Solana. Magic Eden just announced that they're integrating with ethanol.
01:00:14.552 - 01:00:14.954, Speaker B: This.
01:00:16.734 - 01:01:09.962, Speaker A: Raises a really interesting question, which is like, are communities going to continue to be loyal to their marketplaces? Is this a winner take all market? Magic Eden obviously raised a big $130 million Series A about two months ago. At a $1.6 billion valuation. This is probably comparable, actually to OpenSea Series B, which was 100 million at a $1.5 billion valuation that they raised exactly a year ago. So it feels like maybe Magic Eden is about twelve months behind Opensea. But there's some pretty interesting data I've been looking at that is points in the direction of magic Eden doing well, which is when you look at marketplace businesses, whether it's Airbnb or Uber, anything, eBay, the most important metric is not actually the GMV, like the gross merchandising value, it's the transaction frequency.
01:01:09.962 - 01:01:39.860, Speaker A: Because transaction frequencies build user habits. That's much more important to marketplaces than GMV. So I haven't looked at this data in a little bit, but, like, Opensea has a much higher gross merchandising value, but Magic Eden has less users and two times and more transactions, which means that users on magic Eden are transacting. Like, I haven't, again, haven't looked at the data in a little while, but last time I looked, it was like four or five times as much as Opensea users. And that's the end goal of a marketplace.
01:01:39.962 - 01:02:05.024, Speaker B: Would you say that. Would you say that that is because of, like, lower transaction fees or just the type of user that is using Solana is just more freak active? Or the value of what you're also a function of, like a lot of the Solana NFTs, or just in aggregate, on average, median, whatever you want to see it is much lower than, like, the blue chain.
01:02:05.064 - 01:02:57.152, Speaker A: I think there's probably two things. Yeah, I think there's probably two things. Which is, like, if you are in the Solana ecosystem, like, you're probably a pretty active user of crypto in general. Solana users are probably much more active than ETH users for a number of reasons. And then I think also the average price point of a magic Eden NFT is probably like one 10th or one 20th of the average price of an Opensea NFT, I would guess. And so I think this leads to higher frequency of purchases, which then obviously leads to greater user retention, which means more opportunities to step into value for other areas that the marketplace can build. And I think it was Lee Jin put this, she explained this really well, which helped define my thinking on this, which is Uber is a big marketplace for connecting cars and people, obviously for transportation.
01:02:57.152 - 01:03:18.376, Speaker A: Uber starts as uber black, then they expand to Uber X, then they expand to uber Eats and other product lines. It's like you're basically just as a marketplace ramping up uh, the. The frequency of transaction within the marketplace. So. Yeah, yeah, we'll keep an eye on data, on magic, Eden versus opensea. Anything else, Santi? Any other, uh. Oh, here's.
01:03:18.376 - 01:03:40.782, Speaker A: Here's another one. I don't have much commentary on it. Michael Saylor, stepping down from CEO as microstrategy, takes on a new post as exec chairman. I mean, just reviewing the data, they own 130,000 bitcoin. Uh, they bought it at an average price of 30k bitcoin sitting at 23k right now. So they. What is the, uh.
01:03:40.782 - 01:03:48.038, Speaker A: You want to help me do some mental math here? 2 billion. They've got like, 2 billion bitcoin. They bought it for, like, 3 billion.
01:03:48.206 - 01:03:48.742, Speaker B: Yep.
01:03:48.838 - 01:04:14.324, Speaker A: No, they've got 3 billion. They bought it at 4 billion, I think, is my mental math. So they're down, like a billion on. On the bitcoin trade. That's all I got from microstrategy. Um, I guess, other news, we'll keep running through this, uh, SEC charged vorsage founders, promoters, uh, in $300 million crypto Ponzi scheme. The, uh, CBoe reported a $460 million write down on the ars x transaction.
01:04:14.324 - 01:04:28.364, Speaker A: Um, crypto backed spacs, or, excuse me, paCs, uh, are starting to ramp up spending, um, for the primaries. And, uh, yeah, I think that's the news of the week.
01:04:28.484 - 01:05:10.140, Speaker B: Yeah. There are some other interesting. Some interesting news that we don't have to all cover here, but the CFTC came out saying the regulation of bitcoin, Ethereum, will squarely fall into their domain. There's been interesting. We're going to have a great episode on regulation with Rebecca and Jake around these type of topics, so we'll save discussion for then. But there's some really interesting developments. It feels to me like there's a higher cadence of, like, discussion among regulatory bodies in the US, which to me feels like there's a maturation of, like, properly kind of understanding these and then regulating these stablecoin kind of act.
01:05:10.140 - 01:05:55.584, Speaker B: And Bill and I think all of these things ultimately will be net positive, irrespective of kind of the resolution. I think regulators understand that it is the next very interesting arc of innovation, and they don't want to, like, necessarily just create something that totally shuts down the space. And so there's a lot of development and interesting kind of things that I will foresee will happen over the next 612 months that is just interesting to pay attention to and is a narrative that we'll continue to track closely in the pod and bring on guests that can more eloquently talk about it. What else? There was another interesting. Did we cover Coinbase? I mean, obviously the stock is up like a ton, but they, they were chosen by Blackrock. Did we cover that? Should we cover that?
01:05:56.124 - 01:06:29.794, Speaker A: I can give the overview here, which is that there's big news from the institutional crypto world. Today, Coinbase announced they're partnering with Blackrock. BlackRock is obviously the largest asset manager in the entire world. TLDR on the partnership institutional clients of Aladdin. Aladdin is Blackrock's investment management platform. Institutional clients of Aladdin now have direct access to crypto trading, crypto custody, crypto prime brokerage and crypto reporting through a direct integration with Coinbase Prime. I think users have to be clients of both Coinbase and Aladdin.
01:06:29.794 - 01:07:15.506, Speaker A: But I mean, this is a huge deal, I would say for Coinbase, this is really helpful for, I mean, this is an amazing integration for clients of Blackrock and of Aladdin. It's pretty frustrating. If you're a private client of someone like, let's say the two big ones like Goldman or JPMorgan, if you are a private client right now of someone like Goldman, you can't hold your crypto with Goldman. You can allocate on their platform to different funds, but you can actually hold your crypto. You can't trade crypto. There are a lot of folks who made a lot of money in crypto. They don't want to bank at their, use their checking account that they use when they were, you know, in college or something.
01:07:15.506 - 01:07:22.866, Speaker A: They want to go be a private client of like a Goldman or JP Morgan. But most of their wealth is in crypto, so they can actually, I mean.
01:07:22.970 - 01:07:38.690, Speaker B: This really sets us up for more interesting products, like being used. Crypto is collateral for a number of things. And it's not just Blackrock. I mean, obviously Blackrock is the large, it is the largest money manager in the world. 10 trillion.
01:07:38.802 - 01:07:40.294, Speaker A: What? 10 trillion, right.
01:07:41.114 - 01:08:46.689, Speaker B: And the setup there is explosive, I think, especially not the key things are the custody of it. It's like the full suite of Coinbase that they've already developed. I think that's their biggest moat. Call it what it is, whether margins are down, you don't agree with the management team or the, they do have this kind of moat of having built like an end to end suite of solutions that an institution like Blackrock is probably going to go and use them versus someone else. There was also an interesting development that happened in Europe, BMP Paribas, which is, if not the largest one of the largest banks in France also similarly, is now going to allow their private clients to support them, like allocating to crypto. And by allocation, I mean being able to, from their platform, you log in, you buy it and, like, you, you see it in your statement, like it's there. I, you know, and they're, I don't think they're, I'm not sure who they're using on the back end, but it's, it's like, from a custodial standpoint and what have you.
01:08:46.689 - 01:08:53.241, Speaker B: But yeah, these are some of the headlines that kind of go unnoticed in, during these markets. You know, most people, this coin, this.
01:08:53.257 - 01:09:01.411, Speaker A: Coinbase announcement, if it was a bull market, it is plastered all over crypto, Twitter. It's like front page news. It's like just quietly goes, goes by in a bear market.
01:09:01.537 - 01:09:57.243, Speaker B: Yeah. You know, so I think you're speaking around that, which I think, just to tie nicely, kind of the episode is we had the head of research at Ark come on last week and I think he's a, you know, these guys are, in my opinion, one of the best research shops out there. And, yeah, you know, they, they traded out a coinbase, which they've held for quite a bit of time. Was it two weeks ago? A week and a half ago? I think July 27, they kind of punched out. And now obviously the stocks up a ton now 80, 7100 percent, depending on where things are. It probably moved quite a bit during this recording. So you're left wondering again, we didn't ask them much, but why did they punch out of it? And a lot of people are obviously saying, well, you literally took the bottom.
01:09:57.243 - 01:11:00.758, Speaker B: And this is why it's so hard to think on. I don't know what their thesis or if it was like a for selling situation. They had to just, I don't know the particulars. But what I'm trying to say is I think it's important to kind of appreciate and go back to the original thesis of why coinbase is valuable, why I think it's valuable, and the moats that it has. And just from first principles, like should this business be worth x and its trading out y? It's interesting because I think Coinbase and microstrategy both will tell you the sentiment around crypto and how far that pendulum is swinging from Howard Marks is a great quote. And I keep going with Howard Marks because I think he's one of the best investors, which is like the business the real world deviates. And kind of here the market is, you add the psychological component and humans not being very rational with species deviates like this.
01:11:00.758 - 01:11:23.754, Speaker B: And so it's like, have fundamentals really changed and so on the margin. Yeah, maybe. Right. How much of it's priced in were super hard to understand, but at least you can point to saying, okay, this business has x amount of cash on their balance sheet. It's generating y. Unless I fundamentally think that's going to totally go away. And it's trading at this p multiple, which is like below distressed steel mills.
01:11:23.754 - 01:12:10.978, Speaker B: Should this, what is still a technology business that is synonymous with crypto in one of the largest markets in the world, should it be trading at close to book value or a p ratio of six or seven or four? Well, maybe not. And so, yeah, you know, it just is a reminder that you can, they're very smart people looking at these things and, and even them, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's really hard to time the time the market. But, uh, yeah, it's an, I look at Coinbase and microstrategy is like very clear barometers of, of general sentiment towards the asset class. Um, and, and, you know, I think it was like, again, have we bought him? I don't know, but like there was a while there with Coinbase restraining at like pretty distress levels.
01:12:11.026 - 01:12:11.250, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:12:11.282 - 01:12:16.626, Speaker B: So I don't know, you could argue. Still is. But, you know, you guys should go and do the work.
01:12:16.730 - 01:12:20.666, Speaker A: Do the work. All right. Santi, good app. You excited for New York, my friend?
01:12:20.850 - 01:12:26.714, Speaker B: Very much so, assuming I am flying through Heathrow, I believe. And so.
01:12:26.794 - 01:12:29.474, Speaker A: Oh, the bad call. Very bad call.
01:12:29.514 - 01:13:06.590, Speaker B: Hey, listen, you know, uh, it is what it is. I will just, uh, I'm excited to go and meet up with some folks out there. Uh, we didn't cover it, but as a punk holder, I, I will say it will be interesting to see this Tiffany. I will. Let's just end it with this Tiffany in our know, I think one of the sons of Bernard is, you know, has a bored ape, I think, as his profile picture. And he's been, you know, very much in the frontier of being pro web three. And, and I think developing a strategy for the suite of luxury brands, whether it's tag the watchmaker or Tiffany the jeweler or some of the other ones.
01:13:06.590 - 01:13:55.906, Speaker B: Right. And so in this case, Tiffany unveiled that it was doing 250 pendants. So if you have a punk, there are some folks that were whitelisted, others that are just going to try to buy it up to there's 250 nfts and you can redeem the NFT and get a custom, like, pendant with some like, rare gemstones, if you will, of the punk itself. But you can only claim it within the first, I think, like couple weeks or like months. It's not like you can wait forever. So, yeah, it's interesting from, you know, I think it will pave the way and show other luxury brands why web three is so important, because I think LVMH as a conglomerate is by far. In fact, it's my top three.
01:13:55.906 - 01:14:59.678, Speaker B: If I could just own one stock, and I don't typically own stocks other than private companies going public in my portfolio, it would be probably LVMH because humans always want to differentiate. And I think the way they've kind of gone after and developed this luxury conglomerate across multiple categories is very impressive. So you're left wondering who's next within their portfolio of LVMH brands, especially in the backdrop when a lot of sales, they've been hit hard with the US dollar rising luxury brand based in the US and or Russia, all of a sudden, certain brands like Dolce and Gabbana and were deriving 30, 40, 50% of the revenue from Russia. Well, guess what? That just went to zero. And China for a while has been clamping down on anti corruption practices. And so that also has put pressure on these brands. And so what's next? They always wonder, like, what's next? What's next? How do you appeal to a, a younger demographic and capture growth? Well, I don't know, maybe do what Tiffany is doing.
01:14:59.678 - 01:15:43.024, Speaker B: So I think it's a very interesting experiment, whether you like it or not, whether you like the pendants or not, I personally probably will not be shelling out 30 ETH because I, I don't have a significant other and I'm not much independence. But, but they look pretty cool. I mean, I guess I will say the only thing that I was thinking was, oh, let me go out and buy a bunch of female punks. Because then I think, like, I don't know, like, look, it's like a man, it's like a satchel. You remember that scene in the, in the hangover, which is like, he's wearing like a man bag and there's this whole discussion on what, what it is, and I think they look. Yeah, don't get me wrong, if you use man bag, Satchel, whatever you want to call it, great. But I'm just not a pendant guy, so I always buy for personal consumption.
01:15:43.024 - 01:15:49.216, Speaker B: And this is not something that I, at this point in my life, see myself just wearing I'm with you.
01:15:49.280 - 01:16:07.728, Speaker A: I mean, this is a, yeah, I mean, shout out to Louis Vuitton and LVMH. Like, first off, Bernard Arnaud, the french billionaire who, dude's worth 168 billion, they own LVMH, owns Dior, Fendi, Mark Jacobs, was it Celine, Sephora, tag all the.
01:16:07.736 - 01:16:10.578, Speaker B: Liquidity Tiffany, all some of the best liquor brands out there.
01:16:10.746 - 01:16:31.818, Speaker A: Yeah. And like just they, they, I think they're behind El Catardon, like the amazing investment firm he put. The reason I think this deal went down is he put his son Alexander, 28 year old in charge of Tiffany. So it's no wonder that like Tiffany is doing this. Shout out to I pinged Alexander, see if we can bring him on the podcast. Yeah, yeah. Santi, be well.
01:16:31.818 - 01:16:33.178, Speaker A: I'm excited to see you soon in New York.
01:16:33.226 - 01:16:41.934, Speaker B: Thank you. Likewise. Thanks, everyone for listening and hope. Stay safe out there and we'll be back next week.
