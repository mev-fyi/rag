00:00:00.360 - 00:00:17.685, Speaker A: Maybe we're making our crypto to be more influential than it actually is in in the grand scheme of the electoral game theory. I know Brian Armstrong tweeted or said something to the effect that if you're anti crypto in dc, it's like committing seppuku. Like it's a suicide. Political suicide.

Special thanks to Real for sponsoring today's episode. Hello.
00:01:58.573 - 00:02:17.195, Speaker B: Happy Friday. So I listened to Peter Thiel, Joe Rogan episode and you. So they'll keep it running. If they like go take a piss break or something, they just keep it running. If they go like step out, shoot some guns, they keep it running. Maybe we should do that.
00:02:17.935 - 00:02:25.155, Speaker A: Yeah, if you relocate to Austin, maybe we can go and shoot guns in the back door. You know, just open the door and shoot some deer or whatever.
00:02:27.185 - 00:02:37.513, Speaker B: So what's going on? So we took the last two weeks off. Big, big win for Empire. Hit a record number of monthly downloads in August. Correlation causation.
00:02:37.689 - 00:02:40.289, Speaker A: Does that mean like, we should just like take the entire year off?
00:02:40.377 - 00:03:03.485, Speaker B: I don't know. Yeah, big shout out to the Delphi guys. They got on the feed in August. That's been awesome. And then the thousand x Podcast, which is also Avian Jonah, which is also on the Empire feed, has been booming. So, yeah, just big hats off to, I guess, this mini empire that we're creating on Empire. And just big thanks to everyone who's been listening and supporting.
00:03:03.485 - 00:03:11.465, Speaker B: We've been doing the show for, like, three and a half years now. Coming up on four years. Yeah. So let's go.
00:03:11.925 - 00:03:22.625, Speaker A: That's good. We're just getting started. I mean, if we can hit these numbers during what has felt like a very dead market, then we're doing something right.
00:03:22.745 - 00:03:32.045, Speaker B: I think we're the third biggest show now. So it's. I think it's bankless. And then I think Unchained is still the second biggest show. And then. And then it's us now. So.
00:03:32.045 - 00:03:38.365, Speaker B: I do love Laura, I do love Ryan and David, but we are coming for that. For that number one spot.
00:03:38.825 - 00:03:39.713, Speaker A: Absolutely.
00:03:39.849 - 00:03:42.721, Speaker B: Yeah. What's on your shirt? What are you wearing?
00:03:42.833 - 00:03:55.175, Speaker A: I don't know. It's like my T shirt that I wear. Nice sleep with, I guess. Gotta get you pretty late out here. Just. Just so you guys know, I'm burning the midnight oil here and in Seoul.
00:03:55.675 - 00:03:57.895, Speaker B: Yeah. Tell us about Korea. So you're at kbw.
00:03:59.155 - 00:04:21.587, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I was. I got here yesterday, was at the Aptos Experience event today. Speaking with. It was like a fireside chat with Neil, the head of ecosystem, talking about DeFi and kind of my perspective. I was so jet like that I made it. He was like, you're not supposed to ask questions in this fireside chat. I'm the one asking questions.
00:04:21.587 - 00:04:34.295, Speaker A: I'm like, wait, wait a minute. It's easier to ask questions. And I'm speaking tomorrow again, so. Yeah, really good. I really like Asia in general.
00:04:34.915 - 00:04:37.815, Speaker B: Any takeaways from the event or too early?
00:04:39.275 - 00:04:44.785, Speaker A: Very well put together, very well attended. Quality of speakers high.
00:04:45.165 - 00:04:49.185, Speaker B: So it's. It's. It's fact block and hashed. Put it together. Right.
00:04:49.925 - 00:04:51.453, Speaker A: The Aptos Experience.
00:04:51.589 - 00:04:53.005, Speaker B: No, no. Kbw.
00:04:53.165 - 00:05:04.745, Speaker A: Kbw, yes. Yeah, I haven't. I didn't go to that one, actually. Surprisingly, traffic is very bad in Seoul. I didn't remember it. Last time I was here was for the Winter Olympics in 2018.
00:05:06.685 - 00:05:07.893, Speaker B: And. God, traffic.
00:05:07.949 - 00:05:38.055, Speaker A: Just horrible. Funny thing is, like, I tweeted about this, but, like, the streets are, like four or five lanes. You could, like, roll tanks through these streets and there's like two. Two lanes that are always congested because they want to turn left. And it's just like everywhere you go, it's like 40 minutes, like, every. The recurring theme of the year is Dubai. There's flash floods, huge traffic and congestion that so has this conference.
00:05:38.055 - 00:05:44.259, Speaker A: I'm trying to forget that there's another one. I mean London was not so bad, but yeah, it's just brutal.
00:05:44.387 - 00:05:52.775, Speaker B: Tough. I had a long catch up call with Alan, who I think. Did I introduce you to Alan? Do you know, did you end up doing the opensocial deal?
00:05:53.195 - 00:05:55.643, Speaker A: No, but I saw your tweet. Maybe you should talk about it.
00:05:55.739 - 00:06:06.757, Speaker B: Yeah. So had a long catch up. So I'm going to Token. I've never been to Singapore. I'm very excited. I've never. It's my first like work trip, I'd say to Asia.
00:06:06.757 - 00:06:36.425, Speaker B: I'm very excited for that. I've spent, I've spent time and been to Thailand a couple times and Vietnam and stuff, but I've never spent a long amount of time there for crypto. So I'm just excited to like be boots on the ground and worth thinking a lot at Block Works about like there's kind of this untapped market in Asia. Not just obviously Token's done a very good job in kbw, but more from a media and research and data perspective. And so I'm excited to go there. So anyways, I had a long catch up called Alan. Alan runs evg, Everest Ventures Group.
00:06:36.425 - 00:07:28.523, Speaker B: There are, I think the best way to look at evg. I kind of hate to use this comparison but like it's a good mental model is they're kind of like the DCG of Asia. They're just, they're a large holding company, they incubate companies, they own companies, they invest in companies and they just have a lot of influence over that area of the world in crypto and just had a very long catch up call with Alan and his CMO and his COO the other day and one thing I realized is just how little Westerners know about the Asian crypto markets. I think the idea is that in Asia it's like number is big. Oh, a lot of users in Asia. Okay. Maybe people in Korea like to trade a lot and maybe there's a lot of users in Indonesia and like basically the knowledge, unless you really have spent time on the ground there, the knowledge kind of ends there.
00:07:28.523 - 00:07:59.395, Speaker B: I've realized and it's kind of shocking to me just because of how large the industry, how large the impact of Asia is on the industry, the, the lack of knowledge there. So yeah, at least in the west, right? In, in the west, in the west, yeah. And so like, I don't know, he just walked Me through all these things, I actually want to have him on the. On the show to do this big, like, almost Asia brain dump, because there's. There's a very. Some very interesting buckets. Okay? So one was like, who the powerful players are.
00:07:59.395 - 00:08:39.985, Speaker B: And he kind of described it as, there's like three buckets of very influential and powerful players. The most powerful are the Exchange owners are the Exchanges. The second are kind of the most. The, like, the apps that have really taken off, like Sky Maven and things like that. And then there's kind of like Animoca, like the holding companies like EVG and Animoca and folks like that. The big difference, one of the big differences from, from how Asia operates versus how I think people in the US operate US is very bottoms up, right? Like, let's say you're making a sale to someone. Let's say you're trying to sell a software or trying to sell a partnership or something.
00:08:39.985 - 00:09:12.971, Speaker B: You know, you can kind of start with like a junior BD person. That person elevates it to their head of bd, who elevates it to the CEO, elevates it to the co founder. Everyone's happy. Go lucky. Alan was describing a hierarchy that exists in Asia where it's like CEOs talk to CEOs, you know, head of BD talks to head of BD. It is very like, not power games, but hierarchical in, like, class of what you've built and what you've accomplished and like, where you sit in. Where you sit in the power games.
00:09:12.971 - 00:09:52.151, Speaker B: And like, those people should interact with those people. And if you want to get something done, like, you know, he goes to the CEO of X Exchange, and X Exchange goes to the CEO of, you know, maybe OkX comes to him and he goes to that person. And like, it is very direct business like that, I would say, which is actually for folks who have built companies in the US it's very different from how it works. And there have been a lot of US companies who have tried to go to Asia specifically. A lot of CEFI brands that I think really failed, really flopped. And Alan described that hierarchical difference as one of the main reasons why a lot of them flopped is because they just send a lot of, you know, BD people who maybe speak Mandarin or something.
00:09:52.263 - 00:10:25.985, Speaker A: You gotta. You gotta pay. You gotta pay respect. Sort of very much ingrained in the culture. Doing business in Asia requires a very subtle and deep nuanced appreciation for culture and cultural differences between the countries. Like Korea has its own unique forms, then Japan, and certainly China, like, and, you know, like uk, like, Confucianism, like, is a big backbone culturally of these countries, but there's flavors to that. And.
00:10:25.985 - 00:10:46.991, Speaker A: Yeah, it's just very. You gotta know. And it's. It's very apparent when you don't. And, you know, like, you remember the scene in, like, the Last Samurai where, like, there's a certain tradition and ways to do things. Like, they'll also never reject you outwardly. And so they're just polite, but they're actually telling you, like, off.
00:10:47.143 - 00:10:48.191, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:10:48.343 - 00:11:05.759, Speaker A: And so, you know, like, even tipping, like, it's. It's actually considered very rude to suggest that you. You're going to tip because it implies that the service was not up to excellent standards. This is actually very refreshing.
00:11:05.807 - 00:11:07.543, Speaker B: But also, you don't tip.
00:11:07.679 - 00:11:09.007, Speaker A: No, absolutely not. You don't even.
00:11:09.111 - 00:11:09.959, Speaker B: See, I didn't know.
00:11:10.047 - 00:11:13.671, Speaker A: See, you don't even.
00:11:13.783 - 00:11:14.335, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:11:14.455 - 00:11:42.867, Speaker A: Suggesting tipping implies subpar experience, which is an insult in many ways to it. So you can imagine someone coming from New York where even a robo coffee maker suggest a 20% tip. So, yeah, it's. It's very. My first time in. I don't want to say Asia, but in Japan was, like, very magical. Like, I'm obsessed with Japanese culture.
00:11:42.867 - 00:12:02.993, Speaker A: One of my favorite books is Shogun by James Clavel and his whole taipan. And he has a whole series of books. I landed the taxi driver's wearing, like, gloves. Just the position of, like, he would take off his gloves when we hit a red light. As soon as he would. He would know exactly when it would turn green because he would put his gloves back on. I kid you not.
00:12:02.993 - 00:12:09.017, Speaker A: Every time he finished putting the second glove on, immediately the light turned green. I'm like, I'm living in a city.
00:12:09.041 - 00:12:12.545, Speaker B: You're like, sir, just keep driving this car around. Just keep driving it around.
00:12:12.705 - 00:12:32.073, Speaker A: I could have. I could have. I was in this trance, like state observing his hands in this process. I'm like, there's just excellence here. You sit down for a makase. You're seeing the assembly line, and people should go watch the documentary of Jiro dreams of sushi, like, the Japanese cuisine. And is.
00:12:32.073 - 00:12:47.129, Speaker A: Is. Is like, not one of adding stuff. It's like simplicity in the ingredients and, like, perfection. And that is what drives a lot of the flavor. It's just crazy. Like, the chef, like, you, 17 years of just, like, being able to.
00:12:47.177 - 00:12:48.105, Speaker B: I love that. I love that.
00:12:48.185 - 00:12:50.497, Speaker A: Make the rice. Touch the rice.
00:12:50.601 - 00:12:52.005, Speaker B: Touch the rice. Yeah.
00:12:52.665 - 00:13:05.329, Speaker A: And like, you're not. You eat with your hand, like, the omakasa, like the nigiri you eat with a hand, you're not supposed to add soy sauce. The chef will add the appropriate amount. It's just very interesting.
00:13:05.497 - 00:13:06.249, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:13:06.417 - 00:13:24.925, Speaker A: But to bring it back to crypto Korea. Korea is an interesting market. It's always been one of the most crypto. The countries with the highest crypto adoption. I think over like 10% of the population has used crypto. It peaked a few years ago. It.
00:13:24.925 - 00:13:52.421, Speaker A: At certain moments in time the volume in Korea has eclipsed and been larger than U.S. markets. It's very impressive. There's been a setback because of Terra. Right. But yeah, it's a very cool place. Japan is similarly very much, very much bitcoin centric, but also very much like people really get crypto here.
00:13:52.533 - 00:14:25.917, Speaker B: Yeah. The downside of the hierarchical thing that I was saying earlier is that in a place like Korea, it's very dominated by. In the US it's like startups versus the incumbents and everyone's like, yeah, go startups. Although unless you're maybe the current administration or whatever who seem to be very anti founder for one reason or another. But um, you know, there, it's like in, in somewhere like Korea. It's like you, you really need the stamp of approval of a Samsung or a Hyundai or you know, SK or Kia or LG or Posco or something like that. Right.
00:14:25.917 - 00:14:54.395, Speaker B: Like it is in the way that like the. I don't know, from speaking with the guys that hashed and speaking with I don't know, some of the, some of the builders in Korea, it is very. It's less about wanting the enterprise connection because of like users like I don't know, I think people here, you know, maybe an L1 wants to partner with Nike because they have all the users there. It's like they just need the almost societal stamp of approval because it is a very top down.
00:14:55.455 - 00:14:56.023, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:14:56.119 - 00:15:04.035, Speaker B: Way of building. Now I do recognize there were two white guys talking about what it's like to build companies in Asia. So I will. I am going to invite Alan on.
00:15:04.765 - 00:15:07.181, Speaker A: Yeah, well, you know, at least our perspective.
00:15:07.293 - 00:15:07.845, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:15:07.925 - 00:16:15.023, Speaker A: But I've made a number of investments in you know, not so much in Japan, but definitely Korea, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore. One observation, just one of the things I get so excited, inspired being here is like I remember in 20, the early 2000s, like when I started my professional career investment banking, you're covering all the Internet giants. What we're still growing in the US Fairly rapidly and you started to see the rise of Chinese Internet companies. And the commentary from people in the west was they're only copying what is, what is working. China historically has been copycat manufacturing, therefore it's copying tech. And in some respects, it was true for, like the likes of Alibaba, you know, copying Amazon. But then you had this phenomenon called WeChat, which was actually something quite novel and new, where it just became started with messaging, so you could have confused it with WhatsApp.
00:16:15.023 - 00:16:56.145, Speaker A: And then it just became the Everything app. It was Netflix and Uber and Instacart and Amazon, and everything was bundled into this Everything app. And so just today, I was just reminded of that. And my theory is, or the way I link it is like Defi, in many ways, attempts to do what WeChat has done in a market, like China or Kakao has done in Korea. The point I'm trying to make is it's very integrated. Like payments is natively integrated in whatever it is that you're doing. So you never leave the app.
00:16:56.145 - 00:18:01.091, Speaker A: So it's like the seamless integration of finance within the app in app compared to in the west, where you're thinking of finance as a standalone product, meaning you're doing something over here, an app, you want to do a payment for the most time you go to another app, you log into your bank account, you input your credit card data, but you have to think of leaving. And so finance is the standalone product with apps or Revolut or Venmo or PayPal, maybe Apple Pay approximates that. But it's nowhere near the integrated how it's so integrated, natively integrated in Kakao or WeChat. And so, like, I think when you come to Asia, you truly appreciate how powerful it is to have that native integration because it just totally removes the friction. People don't, people don't even think about finance should be invisible. But it's not in the West. And so I think, I don't know if that explains why crypto is just more native and easier to understand for someone in Asia.
00:18:01.091 - 00:18:36.125, Speaker A: And maybe that explains part of the adoption. But I can certainly, I think if you were to survey like 100 people in Korea, for instance, and you were to tell them, hey, get on board at a crypto, how easy is it for you? They would probably say, I'm interested in this. This doesn't feel as foreign, and it's actually fairly easy to get onboarded, whereas if you do the same survey in the U.S. for instance, it'd be like, God, this is. This is really difficult. Why do I need this? I don't really understand it. I have Venmo, PayPal, Revolut.
00:18:36.125 - 00:18:54.561, Speaker A: But it's one of those things where you have to feel it, you have to experience it. You have to send your first stablecoin transfer and like do that to really have that aha moment. So that is just a bit of more of a barrier for adoption, I think in a place like the US or in Western Europe.
00:18:54.673 - 00:19:00.165, Speaker B: Yeah. You ever looked at the top 20 Internet companies and where they're located?
00:19:00.625 - 00:19:01.405, Speaker A: Asia.
00:19:01.745 - 00:19:21.855, Speaker B: So yeah, here, I'll pull this up. So seven of the top 15 are now in China. So for anyone who's listening on Spotify or Apple or something can't see the. I'm sharing my screen on YouTube, but Amazon and Amazon and Google. So Alphabet, Amazon and Alphabet at the top two. Then it's JD.com which is in Beijing.
00:19:21.855 - 00:19:40.831, Speaker B: Yeah, in Beijing. Then Meta in San Francisco, obviously. Then it's Alibaba and Tencent, then Bytedance. So 5, 6 and 7 are in. Then May 12 hang out Shenzhen and Beijing. Then it's Netflix. This is by revenue, by the way, not market cap.
00:19:40.831 - 00:19:45.631, Speaker B: Right. Then it's Netflix. Then it's my turn.
00:19:45.783 - 00:19:46.455, Speaker A: Meituan.
00:19:46.535 - 00:19:49.639, Speaker B: Meituan, what? Big e commerce company too, right?
00:19:49.687 - 00:19:51.519, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. E commerce company.
00:19:51.647 - 00:20:31.047, Speaker B: Then PayPal, then wildberries in Moscow, which I know nothing about, then Salesforce, then Sunning in Nanjing, then Baidu or then Ozon in Moscow as well. Then Baidu. And Baidu is like the Google, right? Of China. Yeah, so very interesting. So anyways, so to wrap up the Asia conversation and my chat with Alan, I posted this thing on Twitter which is the daus of the top three social protocols. So open social. So basically Farcaster and Lens really dominate the narrative.
00:20:31.047 - 00:21:18.429, Speaker B: And I was looking at some like open social type investment stuff and I was like, I wonder what the not like not open social in the name of the company. I was looking at some like decentralized social investment stuff and I was like, I wonder what that market looks like. And I'm a small investor in this company called OpenSocial. So I get some updates from them. And what it what I realized is the narrative is all about Lens and at least on my crypto Twitter feed, yeah, it's like all Lens and Forecaster and it feels like kind of like Lens maybe has more of the creators and it's more like soft marketing and fun and playful and some awesome creators are on there. And Farcaster is more like the intellectuals and like the Ethereum crowd and like crypto natives and stuff. And it's there's another one someone posted about on about some.
00:21:18.429 - 00:21:45.795, Speaker B: Someone in Salon. I'm forgetting the name DSC VR, which I'd never heard of, but it sounds like a forecaster for Solana. But it turns out so lens has 25,000 daily active users. And again, these are dune metrics. It's very tough to actually figure out real DAUs and how many people are actually. But it's a standard, like standardizing some of the data because a lot of it's from the same person. It's like lens is 25,000 DAUs, Farcaster 65,000 DUs.
00:21:45.795 - 00:22:13.411, Speaker B: And this company, OpenSocial, run by Allen and Everest Ventures Group, is 110,000 DAUs. And the most interesting thing here, I think is twofold. One is the dispersion between narrative and users. Right. So Farcaster and Lens dominate the conversation, but OpenSocial has two times the users of Farcaster and almost five times the user of Lens. But nobody talks about OpenSocial. Nobody really knows OpenSocial.
00:22:13.411 - 00:22:55.393, Speaker B: And the only reason I know them is because I'm a tiny, tiny, tiny investor. And I've noticed that US crypto media and crypto like blockworks included and crypto Twitter really rarely covers the founders and companies and communities in Asia, whether that's Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia. I actually think there's a big media opportunity to help kind of bridge the narrative awareness media gap between east and West. So that's one thing I'm thinking about a lot. The other thing is I just think it's like, it's crazy what can happen when the. Right. When like there are either less regulations or very clear regulations.
00:22:55.393 - 00:23:12.765, Speaker B: And I think you're seeing. I mean, there's obviously a lot of people in Asia, but I don't actually attribute a lot of this to like the number of people in these places. I attribute it to just like the builders can build there and in the US they're really hamstrung right now. So I don't know, I just found this data very interesting.
00:23:13.075 - 00:23:24.347, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. Yeah. I mean, I mean, certainly, like, I actually got a lot of coverage in the West. It's play to earn movement and I think in terms of adoption, like.
00:23:24.371 - 00:23:24.523, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:23:24.539 - 00:23:50.911, Speaker A: I mean, actually most of the users came from, you know, the Philippines, you know, Malaysia, Indonesia. It's just. Yeah, the probably combination of younger demographic plus more digitally savvy and you know, for something like guilds, obviously, like the income opportunities, just more. More like they are there for these folks.
00:23:51.023 - 00:23:53.607, Speaker B: Yeah. So. All right.
00:23:53.751 - 00:23:54.475, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:23:54.855 - 00:24:18.121, Speaker B: What else happened this week. Well, we missed the last couple of weeks, so I hope people enjoyed the extra guest episodes. But there are a couple SEC things, right. SEC issued a Wells notice against. I'm doing this off memory so I should probably Google this Open Sea. But I'm trying to remember what it was for. I think it was for.
00:24:18.121 - 00:24:19.241, Speaker B: You know what this is?
00:24:19.273 - 00:24:22.645, Speaker A: This is dumb unregistered securities again.
00:24:23.345 - 00:24:46.329, Speaker B: Yeah, Open sea. All right, let me read the. So this is. I like Devin Finster's post. Devin Fincer is the CEO of OpenSea and it's very clear he's going on the offensive here. So OpenSea has received a Wells notice from the SEC threatening to sue us because they believe NFTs on our platform are securities. Longer posts that we can link to if people are curious or you can just search his name on Twitter.
00:24:46.329 - 00:24:57.525, Speaker B: But so, so that happened. So the SEC is threatening to sue OpenSea because they believe NFTs on the platform are securities. And then the CFTC Pokemon Pokemon holders beware.
00:24:57.865 - 00:25:00.553, Speaker A: Pokemon holder cards, baseball cards holders beware.
00:25:00.609 - 00:25:24.365, Speaker B: But yeah, the, the CFTC issued an order against Uniswap Uniswap Labs for illegal digital asset derivatives trading which is essential. And I think they, I think they settled. I think it was $175,000 settlement over basically I think it was over levered tokens being accessed on the front end.
00:25:25.545 - 00:25:26.081, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:25:26.153 - 00:25:27.457, Speaker B: So yeah there was.
00:25:27.521 - 00:26:04.293, Speaker A: There was also a settlement of two. Something north of 200,000. I think it was 225,000. The gallows capital. It's a font based and former fund based in Florida that and also prominent like just Twitter account but got entangled in the whole FTX stuff. They had assets in FTX and the complaint of the SEC was they brought charges to them because they were using an unregistered custodian and they were, they were. They failed to adhere to their redemption policy.
00:26:04.293 - 00:26:45.271, Speaker A: It was a very. Galloway then put out a statement saying and like other hedge fund managers then came out in. In their defense was, you know some of these assets are not supported by registered custodians. So the best solution to use is something like fire blocks and you know that's just the nature of the industry. And their redemption policy was like five days and then they just were like they allowed people to redeem and waive that five days and they thought it was like a good thing. And yeah, I just went after them for that. I think it had more to do.
00:26:45.271 - 00:27:03.045, Speaker A: Not knowing anything from the inside was more to do with the. Probably the fact that they they were using non registered custodians. I think it probably had to do some like the fact that they had so many assets on FDX and that that penalty is going to pay their investors actually.
00:27:04.745 - 00:27:53.617, Speaker B: So maybe quick thoughts on both of these cases. One is OpenSea. The old take is, I think the old SEC take was that if you can prove their belief was if you can prove something as an unregistered security on your platform, then it makes it more likely that your entire platform is an unlicensed, unlicensed exchange. And I think that is starting to be, I think that is starting to be disproven in the courts in cases like Coinbase and Ripple and things like that. Right. So what the Ripple case again should probably have a lawyer on here. But I think what the Ripple case showed us is that the token is not a security, the investment contract is a security.
00:27:53.617 - 00:28:28.283, Speaker B: So tokens of security investment. And then I think there was a Coinbase case or another case where the conclusion was something along the lines of hey, it's not just, it's not that having unregistered securities on your, on your platform makes you an unlicensed exchange or even an exchange. You can just delist that asset and you'll be fine. So the new take I think is like you just from the, from like a policy or legal perspective inside one of these either dexes or sexes is just delist the asset. And so now what I think the SEC is trying to which asset with.
00:28:28.339 - 00:28:29.815, Speaker A: If you don't have guidance.
00:28:30.715 - 00:28:46.809, Speaker B: So it's a really. I think again I haven't dug into this too much but just seeing like you know, blockworks is coverage and stuff like that and post on Twitter. I think what the SEC is trying to do with Open Sea is. And again none of this is fully public yet. Right. I think it was just a Wells. I think it was just a Wells notice.
00:28:46.809 - 00:29:45.583, Speaker B: So which basically means they will be coming after them at some point soon and hey, giving them a heads up basically they it's kind of a sneaky way to go after an unregistered security because if you wanted to really go after an unregistered security, you should go after that company itself be assure the issuer. So but in by going after Open C the issuer can actually defend themselves. So like making or I won't say any names but like going after NFT XYZ saying they're an unregistered security. Well now OpenSea kind of either has to defend them for them or just say okay fine they're an unregistered security. We'll delist them. It's kind of a smart move by the SEC to do this. The other thing about going after Opensea is it's the same thing that pissed me off when they went after Uniswap and I think April issuing them a Wells notice is Uniswap is in New York.
00:29:45.583 - 00:30:28.099, Speaker B: Hayden has just been posted up in Brooklyn for several years. Devin is in either California or New York. These are founders and teams and companies who decided to not leave to Dubai and not leave to Singapore. And I know so many founders who have done that. They've said it's just too risky in the US I'm just going to leave to Dubai. And they built subpar products and honestly kind of shadier things and Uniswap and OpenSea did it the right way and they've got massive legal teams, they spend a shit ton of money on outside counsel and they're the ones getting sued because they decided to stay in San Francisco and New York and that just. They didn't even go to Texas.
00:30:28.099 - 00:30:56.653, Speaker B: Right. Like it's, it's, it's. If you're going to stay in the US it's much more favorable for you from a legal perspective to go to somewhere like Texas and get sued in the courts. In Texas they decided like if you get sued in California and you're fighting in Northern California, you're fighting the SEC in Northern California, like that's an uphill battle. Like Northern California is much friendlier to the sec. And so I don't know, it just, it just that like there's so many bad actors. I was walking around Brooklyn the other day and there's Unicoin, which is a scam company.
00:30:56.653 - 00:31:19.981, Speaker B: They've been advertising on taxis for two years. Like their entire taxis that at the top in the electronic bar and the whole taxis now wrapped with it says Unicorn, the world's best cryptocurrency as a scam company. And nobody's taking action against that. And they're going after Hayden and Devon. So yeah, it's just like. Yeah. From a found.
00:31:19.981 - 00:31:42.113, Speaker B: It just really pisses me off because it's. And you gotta imagine like the Dems are saying they're start. You know, they're pro crypto and Kamala's pro crypto and coming up. But like if I'm, I don't, I don't know the communication between like CFTC and SEC and the administration and the campaign. Right. Those kind of four actors. But if I'm Kamala I'm like, you idiots.
00:31:42.113 - 00:31:50.379, Speaker B: Like, you idiots, we are trying to get these people to vote for us and you just keep going after them. Like now, that ship might have sailed, honestly.
00:31:50.427 - 00:32:08.027, Speaker A: But yeah, two, two counter observations that. One, I think these cases take a long time in the pipeline to develop, build a case. So it might have been possible that they've been building a case against these two companies and then they decided to, you know, this.
00:32:08.091 - 00:32:13.651, Speaker B: Yeah, but someone is more powerful than Gary Gensler and someone should be saying, shut it down, buddy, shut it down.
00:32:13.683 - 00:32:53.241, Speaker A: No, no, this was my second point, which is maybe we're making our crypto to be more influential than it actually is in the grand scheme of the electoral game theory. I know Brian Armstrong tweeted or said something to the effect that if you're anti crypto in dc, it's like committing seppuku. Like it's a suicide, political suicide. I mean, if that were truly true, you would, you know, be acting like you said. But yeah, no, it's, it's. It's a world of, of polar opposite the counter.
00:32:53.433 - 00:32:53.833, Speaker B: Trump.
00:32:53.889 - 00:33:21.295, Speaker A: Trump apparently, you know, obviously has, has only intensified his fervor and support for crypto, whereas Kamala has just been silent and the current administration, which she serves obviously as a vice president, as you know, continues, continues to be under the same. Like, it hasn't shifted at Stan. So I don't know.
00:33:22.395 - 00:33:34.575, Speaker B: Yeah. The counter to the Brian Armstrong thing is the Fair Shake pac, which is a pro crypto pac, became the largest super PAC of the entire election cycle. Right.
00:33:35.275 - 00:33:43.755, Speaker A: And Trump, I think, is now receiving more money in crypto than in Fiat or had for like a week or so. I mean, it's Trumpet.
00:33:43.795 - 00:34:04.851, Speaker B: So Blockworks did this, like looked at the. On chain data and some of his royalties info is public because of the lawsuits. So there's a great Blockworks piece. He's. Trump is now making more money from Ethereum, NFT, from. From NFTs than he is from all of his royalties from the show the Apprentice.
00:34:05.043 - 00:34:05.699, Speaker A: Wow.
00:34:05.827 - 00:34:08.603, Speaker B: Yeah, that's good headline. Good headline.
00:34:08.659 - 00:34:10.083, Speaker A: Yeah, that's it. That's a good headline.
00:34:10.179 - 00:34:11.055, Speaker B: Good headline.
00:34:12.115 - 00:34:50.475, Speaker A: The last, the last thing on, on this conversation around what happened was obviously Pavel Durov, the founder of Telegram, got arrested when he flew into Paris. Unclear why he flew into Paris because there was an arrest warrant and he had. There's interview with him saying he avoided Kona, the US and Europe and was mostly traveling, you know, in. In other places. Unclear why he went to Paris. He was detained. What was interesting was so he was A citizen of Russia.
00:34:50.475 - 00:35:28.095, Speaker A: Then he acquired nationality in France and then Dubai. The. Dubai, the United. Sorry, the United Arab Emirates. So UAE actually issued a statement where they canceled a purchase order of fighter fighter jets from France and were pressuring the French government to get more clarity on the arrest. Kind of like really protecting a citizen of their own. To me, that was like pretty awesome to see, candidly, you know, and it just speaks to how government should protect their people.
00:35:28.095 - 00:36:00.825, Speaker A: And yeah, it was. It was really like, I'd be lying if I didn't. Like now of the places you go as a, you know, someone that is in crypto, like Dubai is probably top of the list, candidly. I know, I know there's other factors why you wouldn't want to perhaps live there year round, but primarily the weather. But from a government stance, like, I think it's. They're leading the charge. I mean, it's been incredibly impressive and even more so solidified, reinforced by their recent support of Pavel and really putting pressure on the French government.
00:36:03.285 - 00:36:46.693, Speaker B: Hey, everyone, Jason here. I wanted to talk about something that's been on my mind a lot recently, and that is, where are all of crypto's killer apps? We often ask this question on this show, so I'm excited to tell you about Empire's latest partner, Anoma, the Universal Intent Machine Intents are a new way to build dapps, enabling users to say what they want without needing to specify how it's done. Let's say you have an NFT on one chain, but you want to swap it for a token on another chain. To make things even worse, you also don't know which bridge to trust or how to navigate different dexes on each chain disaster. Right? But here's the good news. Thanks to Intense, you can just tell the app what you want to do. And Anoma's solver network takes care of all the complexity in the background.
00:36:46.693 - 00:37:17.659, Speaker B: We're excited to see what cool DAPPS Anoma's architecture will unlock. To stay up to date with Anoma, you can follow them at x.com anoma or sign up for the newsletter@anoma.net Special thanks to Anoma for sponsoring today's episode. Hey, everyone. I'm excited to tell you about fbtc, an Omnichain bitcoin asset being used throughout Defi today. It launched back in July, and since then it's accumulated about $157 million in total value.
00:37:17.659 - 00:37:57.356, Speaker B: Locked FBTC aims to make Bitcoin more accessible and useful in various Defi applications. Currently, you can use FBTC on both the Ethereum and Mantle networks. FBTC is highly composable, interoperable and secure with over 27 starting partners. If you're ready to get started, check out the rewards program Sparkle, designed to reward users. Eligible FBTC positions will now accrue Sparks. They're also offering additional rewards like a token airdrop from a project called Babylon and a new token from mantle called co. Get started at fbtc.com
00:37:57.356 - 00:38:41.549, Speaker B: ongoing-campaign Huge thanks to Mantle for sponsoring today's episode. This episode is brought to you by Polygon Polygon Labs is developing the next generation of open source Zero knowledge tech to aggregate crypto liquidity and user bases, empowering developers to grow in a unified web of interoperable chains. With the AG layer, that was a big mouthful. So I'm going to tell you what it means in my words. There's all these things popping up, L2s and L3s and it's chaos, right? If you are building something, you no longer have to worry about bootstrapping liquidity. You can basically just build in the AG layer to tap into the liquidity of the AG layer and the users of the AG layer. You get the users, you get the liquidity.
00:38:41.549 - 00:38:58.413, Speaker B: It's the AG layer. It's hot. It's by Polygon Labs. They've got the Polygon Community Grants Program. It was launched with 1 billion tokens just for Polygon builders. Season one it's live right now. It features 35 million in Matic to support the next generation of Polygon Builders.
00:38:58.413 - 00:39:37.282, Speaker B: Join the aggregated future today by applying at Polygon Technology Grants. That's Polygon Technology Grants. If you talk to anyone, let them know Blockwork sent you. Hey everyone, I wanted to take a second to talk about real. A permissionless L2 for tokenized real world assets on Arbitrum Orbit. What's really cool about REAL is that it uses the off chain yields from RWAS as a sustainable solution for native liquidity incentives. Real is also the first L2 where 100% of profits from transaction fees and fees from protocols accrue back to the L2's governance token.
00:39:37.282 - 00:40:21.063, Speaker B: RWA Real has just launched their rewards program where 10% of the RWA supply is being given away to early users of the chain. Users can provide concentrated liquidity, trade, borrow and leverage tokenized real world assets including T bills, real estate and tokenized basis trades. Just as a quick disclaimer, this is not investment advice or product solicitation and not aimed at US persons. Find out more at Re AL rewards Special thanks to Real for sponsoring today's episode. I always struggle to explain like why I'm excited about crypto and what I like, why I think crypto is good for the world. And one of the ways, there are many ways to describe it. There's like the bitcoin argument.
00:40:21.063 - 00:40:53.505, Speaker B: It's like almost like a hedge against chaos. Like you never know. There's the like maybe Chris Dixon way of explaining it, which is like, look, the incumbents just have too much power and like we need to. This is the best way. Like regulation is not the best way to eat away at their power. It's like empowering startups and crypto are the best rails to do that. There's another way to describe it which is just that censorship resistant applications and ways to transfer value and ways to transfer information don't matter at all until they really matter.
00:40:53.505 - 00:41:30.935, Speaker B: And I think people in the US really can't comprehend that. And I it's very tough for me to grapple with what that even means because I grew up in the U.S. i lived in the U.S. my whole life. But there's this, this Wences Casaras like podcast with Laura Shin from maybe 2016 or 2017 that was one of the first podcasts I listened to and it really just stuck with me. And he just explains how like I think in the US the US is the hardest place in the world to explain crypto to someone because the government works and our money works and the companies don't. They have too much power, but they don't abuse the power.
00:41:30.935 - 00:42:17.651, Speaker B: And monopolies oftentimes end up helping consumers with lower prices. So it's like the monopolies and the companies work, the government works and the money works. So it's very hard to explain. This telegram case with Pavel just reminded me that you need alternative in a world of overreaching. Not just governments, companies, governments, whoever it may be, you really need a way to opt out of that and have censorship resistant platforms. And again, there's actually a wired piece. There's a wired piece called the Kremlin has entered the chat and if it focuses on how the so so there's a lot of like I'd say sympathy pose for.
00:42:17.651 - 00:42:59.723, Speaker B: For Pavel, which is great. And I don't think the French government should be doing what they did. Obviously there's another side of the argument which is this Wired article called the Kremlin has entered the chat which focuses on how the Russian government has basically increased its surveillance of private communications on Telegram and there it kind of highlights. This case of Marina Patsapulina I think is their name, which is a Russian opposition activist whose private group chats on Telegram were accessed by Russian authorities. And it. There, there's a lot of other kind of examples in this story. And so the thing that is frustrating so one is it's a reminder that it's important to build censorship resistant platforms.
00:42:59.723 - 00:43:29.175, Speaker B: The other thing is it pains me that I don't know who's telling the truth. I don't know if the Russian government has infiltrated Telegram. I don't, I just, I don't have a way of seeing that. You either have to listen to the. What like this Wired article or you have to listen to the CEO of the company. Like there's no way to verify it. And I just wish there was a way to openly and publicly verify what the privacy settings of Telegram actually are.
00:43:29.175 - 00:43:48.395, Speaker B: And I'm hopeful that building things on crypto Crypto Rails can help with this. Maybe. Z. I'm not smart enough to understand if it's ZK or crypto Rails or open ledgers or whatever it is, but I'm very optimistic that like we'll live in a society one day that where I could quickly verify what, what that is.
00:43:48.775 - 00:43:56.019, Speaker A: Yeah. Internet encryption is like Telegram is not encrypted as far as I know. Unless you make the chat secret.
00:43:56.187 - 00:44:04.291, Speaker B: Yeah. What I do know is that the, my friends who care about privacy the most refuse to use Telegram and yeah.
00:44:04.323 - 00:44:09.139, Speaker A: But then they, they were using Signal and then they stopped using Signal. So what do you do?
00:44:09.227 - 00:44:25.665, Speaker B: A lot of them are still like anything with the US Government. The US Government is all. So I'm at all these chats with, with folks trying to get them to speak at Permissionless. It's all on Signal, interestingly enough. It's all. All US government stuff. It's all on signal.
00:44:27.165 - 00:44:31.705, Speaker A: Yeah. You know you meaning like people that work in the government.
00:44:33.365 - 00:44:46.381, Speaker B: Wow, that's crazy. John. Sorry. John Deaton just since the Republican nomination. That's crazy. Big Elizabeth Warren taking. Taking on Elizabeth Warren for her Senate seat.
00:44:46.413 - 00:44:50.947, Speaker A: Sorry, you mean the government uses Signal?
00:44:51.091 - 00:45:04.415, Speaker B: The government uses Signal. Not public, not publicly, but like any. Anytime you're trying to chat with someone who works in the administration or on like even on the campaigns, it's all on signal. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And they won't use Telegram by the way.
00:45:05.355 - 00:45:08.415, Speaker A: I think that's for ideological reasons more so than anything.
00:45:09.955 - 00:45:13.563, Speaker B: Yeah, that's fair.
00:45:13.739 - 00:45:36.715, Speaker A: But they, they probably have a backdoor and a signal. They can control that whereas they don't Necessarily the telegram. They may not have guarantees, but the working theory is, you know, you get pressured into, like. Like Zuckerberg actually. Also relevant. Zuckerberg issued out a communication saying that he was Meta. Was pressured into censoring.
00:45:36.715 - 00:45:56.045, Speaker A: Censoring posts on. During the COVID During the onset of COVID pressure by the administration. And he said it's one of his deepest regrets. He wouldn't. He wouldn't do it again. So it just. Just goes to show that, I mean, I guess if you're.
00:45:56.045 - 00:46:19.355, Speaker A: The probably likely reason why Pavel got arrested was that he refused to censor particularly stuff around child trafficking, pornography, you know, bad stuff like terror, you know, terrorist activity. And. And so whereas had he complied, you know, they were asking him to comply and I think he refused to comply.
00:46:19.475 - 00:46:20.083, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:46:20.219 - 00:46:52.285, Speaker A: Around ideological reasons of like censorship, resistance. And. And then you have the opposite. Right, which is someone like Meta, which. Which complied. So, I mean, I think we're living in interesting times, like very Orwellian, like Panopticon kind of thing, where there's probably no semblance of privacy, not if you're using signal, not if you're using any type of communication. So it's just sort of like the state of the world.
00:46:52.285 - 00:47:21.907, Speaker A: The one thing that I think you brought up was most important is like, you know, Twitter's become the, you know, World Forum, the. The town hall of the world in many ways. And most of. I mean, I don't even check news sites at this point. Haven't for ages. Like, Twitter is just the place where stuff gets, you know, reported first. There's also a lot of commentary.
00:47:21.907 - 00:47:39.345, Speaker A: The community edit notes or. Really valuable. Yeah, I mean, I think what would have happened if we were living in a world where Elon was not at the helm of Twitter? You know, it's, It's.
00:47:39.725 - 00:47:45.213, Speaker B: I mean, it came out that the. That Twitter and the US Government were. Yeah, yeah, so.
00:47:45.389 - 00:48:18.783, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. So, you know, I think there's always this. There's always this really delicate, controversial discussion when you talk about censorship, resistance and permissionless systems. Right. You develop a protocol and it gets used in ways that no one really intended for it to be used for evil. And technology in of itself is neutral, but the implementation of it might not. And how do you.
00:48:18.783 - 00:49:10.433, Speaker A: How do you grapple that? How do you sensibly, kind of, you know, contain it, if you will? You really can't do that in a permissionless system. Right. So what's a happy medium? Where do you draw a line? Who's the arbiter of who's the judge of that, what's fair, what should and shouldn't be censored. I mean, it's very, it's not, it's not very. It could be heavily contested. But, you know, I think we can all agree that, you know, human trafficking, terrorism, anything that causes harm is bad and should be censored. You know, but maybe there's some far extreme ideological people that say that they're doing that as a, you know, response to authoritarianism and yada, yada, yada and all this crap.
00:49:10.433 - 00:49:41.525, Speaker A: But I don't know, it's, you know, there's a reminder like all these Noble peace prices. It was Alfred Noble who invented dynamite and he wanted to absolve himself from that pain that he had by creating this, you know, what could be used for industrial purposes, ended up being used in war. And, you know, so, you know, he created the Noble Foundation. But yeah, it's the myth of Prometheus, so to speak. He brings fire to the world and it's not always used for cooking.
00:49:43.225 - 00:50:18.825, Speaker B: There's one other, there's one other case that I feel like hasn't been talked about enough, which is this Binance executive case in Nigeria. I just wanted to call out Tigranes. Yeah, Gambarian. It's a really fucked up thing that's happening and just people, I don't think are talking about it that much. So basically he's an American. He was the head of, I think financial compliance at Binance. He has been detained in Nigeria for over six months basically on claims of essentially money laundering.
00:50:18.825 - 00:50:59.815, Speaker B: So Nigerian officials have accused, have accused Tigran and Binance of money laundering and they're actually being charged separately. He is. There's a video that. The reason I bring this up now is there's a video that just came out on, on, on Twitter that basically got leaked of him going into his trial. He is currently suffering from both pneumonia and a herniated disc and he can barely walk. And he's bait. And I mean, you can visibly see him walking on this crutch and he tries to grab the arm of someone to help him walk and they won't let him walk, they won't help him out and they won't put him in a wheelchair.
00:50:59.815 - 00:51:23.335, Speaker B: And he says, he says this is fucked up. He was told not to help me. Pointing at a, at a guard, he says, why can't I use my goddamn wheelchair? This is a show. I'm effing innocent. And it's very clear that just looking at him now versus looking at him a Couple months ago. Like, his health condition is rapidly deteriorating. And usually I would have seen something like this and said, this is really messed up.
00:51:23.335 - 00:51:33.245, Speaker B: I don't really know the story. This is really messed up. And it would have been a bummer, but I just want to shed light on it. I just read this book, Red Notice.
00:51:34.345 - 00:51:35.281, Speaker A: Bill Browder.
00:51:35.393 - 00:52:01.495, Speaker B: Bill, about Bill Browder and Hermitage Capital. And really one of the. Really the first, like, big hedge fund in Russia from an outsider. And it is a story of building a hedge fund for the first half of the book and a story of like extreme human rights. Yeah, just violations. And they killed this.
00:52:01.535 - 00:52:18.671, Speaker A: They killed his lawyer, his bodyguard, they detained him. He's. He then had. Then he then became too, too important that Putin ended up protecting him, you know, because it was like, yeah, you met.
00:52:18.703 - 00:52:19.431, Speaker B: You met him.
00:52:19.543 - 00:52:21.853, Speaker A: Yeah, I was at event with when he was being honored.
00:52:21.999 - 00:52:37.081, Speaker B: Yeah, it's an. It's an insane book. I would re. I just finished two books actually, in the last. I've been reading a lot recently. Two books. One is this one, the Fish that Ate the Whale, about the Banana King, which is really good.
00:52:37.081 - 00:53:03.775, Speaker B: And then Red Notice. And I really recommend both of them, but Red Notice, I mean, it's literally what they are doing to this guy is what they did in Red Notice, which is they have a suit against Binance. And Binance, you know, Richard Tang came out and was like, Nigeria is not a big market for us. The government said that we made 20. The government of Nigeria said they made 26 billion in revenue from Nigeria in 2023. Obviously, that's not the case. They did 20.
00:53:03.775 - 00:53:43.819, Speaker B: Almost 23 billion in total transaction volume, not in revenue. So they're mistaking revenue and total transaction volume. And what the Nigerian government is doing is literally what Russia did in this book, Red Notice, which is holding the. An important person who could have been tied to something hostage, letting his health really deteriorate and hoping. And basically every day probably putting statements in front of him saying that Binance is guilty. And eventually his health will get so bad that it's like, do you want to live more? Do you want to live or do you want to say that Binance is guilty? And one day a lot of people crack. They sign the thing that says Binance is guilty because they need to go to the hospital, they need to get a surgery.
00:53:43.819 - 00:53:53.725, Speaker B: And it's. Yeah, it's extortion and it's horrible human rights violation. And. Yeah, I just. I don't know. I just haven't really seen people talking about it. So I just wanted to.
00:53:54.465 - 00:53:55.569, Speaker A: Really good point. Yeah.
00:53:55.617 - 00:53:59.241, Speaker B: Yeah. So I don't know there's any policymakers who listen to this or any US.
00:53:59.313 - 00:54:16.629, Speaker A: Government people, but some people were suggesting something about it for folks to tag his representative. And I don't know what district he's voting district he's on, but the tag is representative and probably get more attention that way as that being an effective strategy in the past.
00:54:16.757 - 00:54:28.117, Speaker B: Interesting. Yeah, that's a good call. I did see rep. Who I think Rep. Hill. Representative Hill called it outrageous. So it's starting to get some eyes.
00:54:28.117 - 00:54:38.485, Speaker B: So anyways, tough to. I don't know. You have any like high notes? Any good things happening? I feel like we've been like on a downward trend this podcast.
00:54:38.525 - 00:54:38.845, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:54:38.925 - 00:54:41.185, Speaker B: People in a bad mood going into this weekend?
00:54:42.755 - 00:54:44.695, Speaker A: No, not at all. I mean, I. I think.
00:54:47.395 - 00:54:50.651, Speaker B: I have a question for you. Did you see Travis Kling's post yesterday?
00:54:50.723 - 00:54:54.935, Speaker A: I did, yeah. I mean, you want to talk about positive. Yeah, well, let's talk about that because.
00:54:55.275 - 00:54:58.651, Speaker B: Well, this is, this is to continue.
00:54:58.723 - 00:55:00.499, Speaker A: On this magical trend of positive.
00:55:00.587 - 00:55:04.115, Speaker B: Okay. I was gonna say this is pretty negative, but I mean it's.
00:55:04.275 - 00:55:08.273, Speaker A: It weren't talking about. I think it's. There's some good points there.
00:55:08.409 - 00:55:35.735, Speaker B: Yeah. So Travis runs Ikigai and they got hit hard by some FTX stuff. They had a lot of funds on FTX and they've recovered all or most of that money. And he's just a. He's a personal friend and really like the guy. But he tweeted just essentially a long thread, essentially about like quiet quitting in crypto.
00:55:37.115 - 00:55:48.051, Speaker A: He said NFTs are dead, the metaverse is dead. Defi is not going anywhere. So what are we doing here kind of thing?
00:55:48.203 - 00:56:29.429, Speaker B: Yeah. Is that what I'm hearing and what I'm seeing and hearing and Twitter is glitching out? What I'm seeing and hearing is that a meaningful swath of the crypto community is simply much less engaged than in prior years. And they are much less engaged because there's much less belief in the potential of crypto projects to solve real world problems and gained significant adoption as a result. That was a dream that was consistently sold and bought from 2017, the year I got in, until 2022. Crypto will solve real world problems and gain significant adoption as a result. Many billions of dollars of venture capital funding were raised on this premise and there were steps along. Anyways, we can link to the thread, very long thread, that essentially that there are a couple of takeaways from it that he Drives to in the conclusion.
00:56:29.429 - 00:56:48.125, Speaker B: But one of them is just that there's a lot of quiet quitting happening in crypto and people who got in in 2017, the 2015 or 2017 class, are just like, look, I mean, I still probably got a lot of my net worth in crypto, but like, I'm cooked. I'm either burnt out or I don't believe in this anymore.
00:56:50.225 - 00:56:51.645, Speaker A: Does it surprise you?
00:56:53.305 - 00:56:58.857, Speaker B: No. No. I would assume this happens in most industries, I don't know, in every cycle.
00:56:59.001 - 00:58:09.931, Speaker A: Sort of like a hallmark of a trough. Now the question is this time any different and is this sign of something that is more enduring? Where are we going? And think the beauty and the curse of crypto is that you have real time price discovery emerging assets that in traditional markets wouldn't have price discovery, they would be private. But you're attempting to have price discovery on very liquid emerging piece of technology and assets. And that presents both an opportunity and a challenge. Even though you can drive it through mechanisms like an AMM and novel mechanisms. But it's still, even Bitcoin is still going through this. Is it digital gold? Can it be digital gold? Can it be uncorrelated? Is it truly going to work out as a hedge against everything else blowing up? But let's go through a series of questions.
00:58:09.931 - 00:58:19.615, Speaker A: Do you think that the idea of NFTs, of digital ownership, of creating digital art or digital scarce assets going away?
00:58:21.955 - 00:58:23.155, Speaker B: No, I mean, I.
00:58:23.315 - 00:58:48.945, Speaker A: If you go and talk to artists that have made their livelihood and being able to monetize, not just the big guys, but just small artists that can no longer need to rely on Sotheby's, Christie's or art galleries in soho or somewhere to be discovered. Do you think that, do you think that that's going away?
00:58:51.405 - 00:58:56.805, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't think. I mean, I don't think any, I don't think any of this goes away. Okay, let me put it easier.
00:58:56.845 - 00:59:38.745, Speaker A: Do you think that Larry Fink is going to stop talking about crypto because of the soft quitting that Travis is talking about? There's two kinds of investors. One that gets really excited when they're soft quitting and another one that freaks out and says maybe we're dead and every cell in your body is telling you as Price goes down or does nothing. I wonder. I think Price not doing anything is probably worse than Price going down because it gets to the impatience of many investors. But I read that and I think it's another affirmation of where we're on the cycle. The opportunity of Being disciplined, being patient. I don't know.
00:59:38.745 - 00:59:47.045, Speaker A: Like, I've seen this movie many, many times. Yeah, people. How many times have people called the death of bitcoin?
00:59:48.145 - 01:00:14.717, Speaker B: My current thinking around this cycle is that it just got very warped BY actually the ETFs. So you should have seen a line up that looked like this, looked like this. But instead you saw an extreme rise up at the beginning of this. When was that? December or January. And then. But it basically pulled all of that growth. Like you should see like a slope of one.
01:00:14.861 - 01:00:19.637, Speaker A: But Yano, like, crypto never, never is linear.
01:00:19.821 - 01:00:21.997, Speaker B: No, no. Yes. Growth is never linear.
01:00:22.061 - 01:00:35.777, Speaker A: It's been a linear phenomenon in crypto. Like, it's just we, we. The, the famous Bill Gates quote, which is we overestimate what can happen in 10 years. Underestimate. We overestimate. We'll get. What is it.
01:00:35.777 - 01:00:40.822, Speaker A: We overestimate what happens in two and can happen and underestimate what can happen in 10.
01:00:40.880 - 01:00:41.433, Speaker B: In 10.
01:00:41.529 - 01:00:49.565, Speaker A: And like people fast forward and like they. Crypto cures cancer one day and then it's rat poison the next.
01:00:49.865 - 01:00:56.721, Speaker B: I'm just trying to put a reason on why I think the vibes feel very down when.
01:00:56.793 - 01:01:22.929, Speaker A: Because the market is ripping or I was ripping, like that's, that's something fundamentally if, if we're all in this together and equities are going down and rates are low and crypto is going down, it's like, yeah, you know, it's just, just, you just got to hunker down. You know, we're valuing deep long term investors. But when that's not happening, then it's like, oh, shit, maybe.
01:01:23.057 - 01:01:24.609, Speaker B: But the market's not ripping.
01:01:24.777 - 01:01:36.945, Speaker A: It was, it was most recently like the last week or two videos down a bit. The Magnificent Seven is down a bit. But this year to date, it's been a stellar performance nonetheless.
01:01:37.105 - 01:01:38.025, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:01:38.065 - 01:01:48.841, Speaker A: And it's. And as we covered in the other podcast, it's. It's been. The cycle has been one which has been different. It's been one of very selective outperformance. The same way that traditional markets have. Right.
01:01:48.841 - 01:02:27.575, Speaker A: If you weren't invested in the Magnificent Seven. Yeah, you really missed it if you were in the Russell. Yeah, you missed it if you were in MSCI World Index. You missed it if you were invested in Europe. Yeah, good luck. Like, you know, you really underperformed similarly here, if you weren't in Solana or Bitcoin or Meme coins, everything else kind of like has been in a, in this, in a bear market kind of down only trend line. So what I'm trying to say is it just hurts more when an easy, simple narrative like AI punt Nvidia has done so well and you end up looking like an idiot.
01:02:27.575 - 01:03:09.821, Speaker A: You look at yourself in the mirror and you're like, what am I doing here? Like, I should have just punted AI and gotten enjoyed my summer. And here I've been glued to the screen, poking my portfolio, refreshing and not seeing anything. It's like the impatience, right, gets at you. I'm not worried about it. We probably in the next week, month or so now we see 50 basis points rate cuts takes one week where Bitcoin goes to 75 and everyone's like, let's go.
01:03:09.973 - 01:03:12.869, Speaker B: Okay, that was my take. It takes one. Let's go.
01:03:12.997 - 01:03:16.261, Speaker A: And Travis, secretly, it's like, yeah, we're.
01:03:16.293 - 01:03:25.547, Speaker B: Back, we're back, we're back. That was what I was going to conclude with too. It's like, all it takes is one up only week.
01:03:25.611 - 01:03:26.283, Speaker A: And then it's.
01:03:26.379 - 01:03:28.411, Speaker B: And then it's BlackRock's buying our bags.
01:03:28.483 - 01:03:31.227, Speaker A: It takes one green big candle to.
01:03:31.251 - 01:03:43.859, Speaker B: Say price drives narrative. Maybe price drives narrative. So then it's prices above 70k and then it's okay, we might get a pro crypto administration. And the SEC is backing off and Larry thinks buying our bags.
01:03:43.947 - 01:04:07.337, Speaker A: It's a classic meme of bitcoin hits. If Bitcoin's at 59, if Bitcoin's at 65, we're going to 250. If Bitcoin's at 51, we're going back to 40, like Goblin Town. And it's like there's a big asymmetry there. Like just temper your emotions and just like go do other things.
01:04:07.521 - 01:04:08.657, Speaker B: Go do other things.
01:04:08.761 - 01:04:09.725, Speaker A: You know what I mean?
01:04:10.305 - 01:04:30.461, Speaker B: Preach. All right, we got some big new speakers. I was supposed to call this out at the beginning of the show, but per usual, I forgot. So come to permissionless. We got actually we got some really cool new speakers lined up. We got the most likely the future senator of Utah, Rep. John Curtis coming in.
01:04:30.461 - 01:04:55.877, Speaker B: He's speaking. That's going to be really exciting. Got the commissioner of the cftc, Caroline Pham. We got Richie Torres, great Democrat in New York. We got Dan, Dan Moorhead from Pantera coming in. We got Speaking of Crypto 2017 class, we got Ari Paul from Block Tower. We've got global head of crypto at Google coming in.
01:04:55.877 - 01:05:00.945, Speaker B: Rich, who's been great position still exists. What's the tradition?
01:05:01.325 - 01:05:03.005, Speaker A: I don't know. I don't know.
01:05:03.125 - 01:05:04.265, Speaker B: What did you say?
01:05:05.485 - 01:05:07.345, Speaker A: I'm surprised that position still exists.
01:05:07.925 - 01:05:09.157, Speaker B: What acquisition?
01:05:09.341 - 01:05:10.285, Speaker A: That position.
01:05:10.445 - 01:05:17.879, Speaker B: Oh, that position, dude, that role. Don't sleep on Google. Don't sleep on Google's crypto team. No, no, no, no, no, no. That is. They.
01:05:17.927 - 01:05:21.263, Speaker A: They are. That's the tease to go to Permissionless, I guess. No.
01:05:21.279 - 01:05:29.035, Speaker B: Do you want to actually see this? Wait, Google Crypto. This is a slept on thing. Oh God. I don't know what this website is anymore.
01:05:30.015 - 01:05:31.715, Speaker A: Try the 404.
01:05:33.695 - 01:05:47.775, Speaker B: No, I'll link it. Google has done some really cool indexing of all of the L1 and L2 crypto data. So if you are someone who sits on top of that data like a Nansen or Blockworks research.
01:05:47.855 - 01:05:48.815, Speaker A: Oh that's true, that's true.
01:05:48.855 - 01:06:08.519, Speaker B: They've done something like with it. With. My prediction is that Google is going to run people's show in crypto data and they will end up being one of the biggest crypto data providers actually. Yeah. But anyway, it's going to be a great event. We have tickets for you. Tickets are now 700 bucks a pop.
01:06:08.519 - 01:06:16.201, Speaker B: They keep going up like every week. So go get them now. 700 bucks. Empire 20 is the code. So you heard it right.

01:07:13.419 - 01:07:20.675, Speaker A: You know, I sell my student ID card, by the way, I was. I'm so cheap sometimes.
01:07:20.715 - 01:07:21.655, Speaker B: I used to.
01:07:22.075 - 01:07:34.059, Speaker A: Not, not anymore but like back in the day, like without now they're. They look at me and they're like, yeah, no, no way. But you know, like a year or two after college, you know, I whip out that ID card and they'll be.
01:07:34.067 - 01:07:38.375, Speaker B: Like, oh yeah, you gotta. A year or two for sure. I was eating sardines.
01:07:39.835 - 01:07:41.859, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean sardines are probably really.
01:07:41.907 - 01:07:56.139, Speaker B: You know my salary my first year in New York, 18K. Which I later learned is a year yeah, below. Well, then I got. And then I got. And then I got commissioned, too. But it was. I got a 1500 check.
01:07:56.139 - 01:07:58.375, Speaker B: And on the last day of every month.
01:07:58.745 - 01:07:59.481, Speaker A: Wow.
01:07:59.633 - 01:08:06.485, Speaker B: Yeah, it was tough. It was a grind. So I. I actually did eat sardines and black beans. It was. It's a good grind.
01:08:07.105 - 01:08:09.257, Speaker A: Damn, that's impressive.
01:08:09.281 - 01:08:11.645, Speaker B: And I started buying crypto on credit cards. Good.
01:08:12.705 - 01:08:13.765, Speaker A: There you go.
01:08:14.465 - 01:08:22.073, Speaker B: All right, we just got the permissionless agenda live. Oh, your boy Logan. We got Block production. MEV on Solana, Lucas, Eugene, Logan. I'll be good.
01:08:22.129 - 01:08:22.657, Speaker A: Nice.
01:08:22.801 - 01:08:26.284, Speaker B: All right, Agenda is now live. You heard it here first. Go check it out.
01:08:26.584 - 01:08:27.648, Speaker A: Oh, that's good.
01:08:27.776 - 01:08:30.364, Speaker B: That's a good panel. Oh, see, Raj and Rich.
01:08:30.744 - 01:08:38.324, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm. I'm. I'm no longer qualified to speak next to this caliber of speakers is really. I'm too afraid to go and talk.
01:08:38.624 - 01:08:40.392, Speaker B: These are good. These are good panels.
01:08:40.528 - 01:08:41.048, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:08:41.136 - 01:08:59.942, Speaker B: What's the main stage? Day two. Oh, we got Ruchi Mert, Nick from Celestia Rushi from Movement, Kyle Samani, and Josh from Supra. Interesting. Oh, we got Baji given a keynote. Oh, this will be a good panel, actually. Macro case for bitcoin. Jan Vanek, Mike Novogratz, Dan Morehead, and Dan Tapiera.
01:09:00.038 - 01:09:01.038, Speaker A: That should be great.
01:09:01.166 - 01:09:02.366, Speaker B: Yeah, it'll be fire.
01:09:02.550 - 01:09:06.062, Speaker A: Really good stuff. Some. Some.
01:09:06.198 - 01:09:08.394, Speaker B: Well, the IRS has entered the chat.
01:09:09.334 - 01:09:10.754, Speaker A: Some AI stuff.
01:09:12.534 - 01:09:14.998, Speaker B: I think this is going to be our best event. Yeah, this looks good.
01:09:15.046 - 01:09:24.285, Speaker A: Absolutely. This might be also a very politically important conference. Gets picked up by traditional media if a lot of these. Crypto.
01:09:24.865 - 01:09:29.605, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. We've got axioms going, Politico going. Wall Street Journal, Financial Times.
01:09:30.945 - 01:09:31.817, Speaker A: Very cool.
01:09:31.961 - 01:09:35.889, Speaker B: Oh, live Empire Roundup. Good thing Santiago won't be there.
01:09:36.017 - 01:09:41.441, Speaker A: Oh, snap. Oh, there it is. I'm still there.
01:09:41.633 - 01:09:48.565, Speaker B: That's a real. That's a good. I don't know who set this up. That wasn't me, but that's a great. So I'm Vance and Ari.
01:09:48.905 - 01:10:04.097, Speaker A: So I'm speaking at a breakpoint, and the. It's at breakpoint. Our debates only. And I'm debating Solana versus Ethereum. A vitriol, actually, is my opponent. He's taking the Ethereum side. I will be taking the.
01:10:04.161 - 01:10:05.645, Speaker B: Vitro is going to get cooked.
01:10:07.465 - 01:10:12.565, Speaker A: I basically tweeted to. I was like, where's the prediction market for this? Like, come on.
01:10:13.785 - 01:10:19.501, Speaker B: I love you, vitro. You're going to get cooked. That's not even. It's over. Yep.
01:10:19.693 - 01:10:21.061, Speaker A: So that should be fun.
01:10:21.213 - 01:10:24.589, Speaker B: Yeah. Oh, well, good.
01:10:24.677 - 01:10:31.613, Speaker A: Sir, I'm excited. You know, Very good to see you. We're back. We'll be definitely see.
01:10:31.709 - 01:10:35.385, Speaker B: You know what? I didn't get your take on the Maker rebrand. What do you think of Maker rebrand?
01:10:35.845 - 01:10:39.461, Speaker A: No comment. Sky. I was barely.
01:10:39.613 - 01:10:41.825, Speaker B: I think that's. I think you just gave a comment.
01:10:44.075 - 01:11:01.467, Speaker A: I came to a conversational. So Rune reached out and I did a Twitter spaces with him and I finally. We had him on the pod. I didn't understand anything of the roadmap and the end game at all. Mind you, I've been fairly close to Maker for many years. It was just. I didn't get it.
01:11:01.467 - 01:11:24.545, Speaker A: So he. We did the spaces, he organized it and it was, I think me, him, Ansem, I think joined and myself. And so I finally started to understand the end game. I don't know if I agree with it, but I understood it finally, I think. And then as soon as I was starting to understand it, there's a rebrand. I'm like, okay. I just.
01:11:24.545 - 01:11:54.835, Speaker A: I. This, this is a topic for a broader, more longer conversation around the future of Stable coins. There's now speculation of more people entering the chat, more people entering the game. Stablecoins are highly lucrative. Like, you got to look at Tether and say that's a huge opportunity. And so it's just. I struggle dai's position in the market in not being singly focused on distribution.
01:11:54.835 - 01:12:25.739, Speaker A: Yes, you're focused on Yield. Yes, you're focused on kind of like the Athena side of Yield is important for adoption, but you need the distribution. You need to be embedded in exchanges. You need. And if you don't have that look, there's a reason why Tron stablecoin is. What is it like? Is it Tether on Tron? That's the most popular. Tether on Tron is the most widely used stablecoin and it's super popular in emerging economies.
01:12:25.739 - 01:12:32.859, Speaker A: And they just crush the local distribution game like no other. I don't see Maker doing that.
01:12:32.987 - 01:12:33.735, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:12:34.315 - 01:12:46.215, Speaker A: So I don't know what they're. I don't know what you as a former delegate think, but, like, what do you think about the rebranding and just generally like the position of die in the ecosystem? Is it just gonna be capped?
01:12:48.275 - 01:13:06.497, Speaker B: I'll. I'll talk about the rebrand. I just, I, I don't like the rebrand. I don't like. But I don't like 9 out of 10 rebrands because it's really hard to build a brand. Like, building a brand is just about trust. And like every day that your Brand survives and lives is another day that your brand gets stronger.
01:13:06.497 - 01:13:46.107, Speaker B: And Maker is one of the backbones of Defi and they've got one of the best brands in all. Like what is Defi? It's Maker, Aave Uniswap. Like I think of like those companies honestly like probably those three protocols and maybe some others but really those three and I just don't like the rebrand I think I think you should do a brand evolution and turn Maker into something else. Like if they want to build like an app or something or a chain like just extend Maker out and make it more things but nobody knows what sky is. Now you've got to. Now you've got to make a brand from. From scratch and that's a very hard thing to do.
01:13:46.251 - 01:13:50.917, Speaker A: I in the sky. Yeah. Well said.
01:13:50.981 - 01:14:00.505, Speaker B: I wouldn't bet against Rune. He's a. He's an eclectic but very guy but very good builder I would say very good crypto builder.
01:14:01.285 - 01:14:11.269, Speaker A: Well I want to end it with. It's been as you alluded to a an active summer of reading. I read this fantastic book. It's called Never Enough by Andrew Wilkinson, the founder of Tiny.
01:14:11.357 - 01:14:13.277, Speaker B: Oh yeah. Was that good?
01:14:13.301 - 01:14:22.213, Speaker A: I got that fantastic read. Fantastic. People should go read it and you'll finish it in a day or two. It's really good if people planes one.
01:14:22.229 - 01:14:24.869, Speaker B: Or two takeaways Honestly it reaffirmed a.
01:14:24.877 - 01:14:51.571, Speaker A: Lot of my my evolution and thinking of like what you optimizing for. He was incredibly successful and he just documents his journey from nothing to being a billionaire and all it and the realizations that he came about and it's just a really good perspective from someone that has made it and and then came to terms of what he was optimizing for. Very refreshing model.
01:14:51.603 - 01:15:19.277, Speaker B: He's a very very good storyteller too. For people who don't know Andrew he started Tiny Lab. They own companies like Arrow and they buy company they buy startups like they buy companies aeropress, Metalab Dribble and he's also the co founder and chairman of We Commerce which is a. They start and incubate and buy and invest in a lot of amazing shopify businesses. Public company. I think he took it public with Bill Ackman. Yeah yeah it was public really.
01:15:19.277 - 01:15:21.749, Speaker B: But I've got that on my list. I'll get that.
01:15:21.837 - 01:15:22.949, Speaker A: Yeah put it on the top.
01:15:22.997 - 01:15:27.905, Speaker B: Read it Any like main takeaways for folks who aren't going to read it?
01:15:28.285 - 01:16:09.945, Speaker A: Time is the most valuable asset we've time and time again we've talked about it here in this podcast. Owning your time, you know, is the most important, valuable thing. I think you talked about it in a prior pod of like being a time billionaire. And I think that's the most important thing. That liberty of owning your time is the greatest luxury that you can have and sometimes it does not equate to the amount of money that you make. And so being able to share it with the people you love. But owning your time is my North Star.
01:16:11.445 - 01:16:17.705, Speaker B: So there's a. You ever listened to the Graham Duncan Tim Ferriss episode?
01:16:18.485 - 01:16:19.685, Speaker A: No, I don't think so.
01:16:19.805 - 01:16:34.239, Speaker B: Okay. So I put that as a. I haven't listened in years, but it's a must listen to episode. It came out in early 2019. We'll try to link in the show notes but. Or you can just search like Graham Duncan, Tim Ferriss and basically Graham. So Graham Duncan's a hedge fund manager.
01:16:34.239 - 01:16:39.035, Speaker B: He says he references a. Do you know Tyler Cohen?
01:16:39.335 - 01:16:40.895, Speaker A: Yeah, the marginal revolution.
01:16:40.975 - 01:17:34.893, Speaker B: Yeah. So Tyler Cohen talks about cultural billionaires. And so Graham Duncan basically says something along the lines of, he says, look, I feel like in our culture we're so obsessed with, as a culture with money, we defy dollar billionaires in a way. And he was thinking about something like he says, I was thinking about time billionaires that when I see like 20 year olds, the thought I had was they probably have 2 billion seconds of their life yet, but they aren't relating to themselves as time billionaires. And I was thinking, and this is his quote, he's like, I was thinking about how if you could, you know, what would Rupert Murdoch, who's worth 20 billion and he's 90 years old, what would he pay if he could take the next five years of someone's 20 year old, healthy body, mind, et cetera, for that 20 year old, how would they price it? And he said over time my pricing has gone completely vertical because the next five years, if I were to lose. And the key to this question is that you can't sell the five at the end of your life. You got to sell them right now.
01:17:34.893 - 01:17:57.371, Speaker B: He said, I don't know how I'd price it because my kids are at a certain age, they'll never be again. But I don't know that I, that I live every day that way, but I aspire to. So I think his idea of this time billionaire is. Yeah, he's trying to capture this like cultural billionaire, dollar billionaire. It's time billionaire. There's also a Tim Urban calendar. He has this concept of a life.
01:17:57.371 - 01:18:17.655, Speaker B: I don't know if you ever read the blog. Wait, but why By Tim, Tim Urban. Yeah. He has this concept of a life calendar and what he, he sells it as a poster actually I'd recommend it. What he does, he puts a week, he does a circle for every week. So he's 52 circles on the horizontal and then 90 rows. So you can actually see a 90 year life in weeks right on one poster.
01:18:17.955 - 01:18:19.787, Speaker A: And it's a powerful visual.
01:18:19.891 - 01:18:21.195, Speaker B: Very powerful visual.
01:18:21.275 - 01:18:36.203, Speaker A: Yeah. So I, I was with my parents, they visited and I was just talking to my dad about it and we're like, how many more skiing, we love skiing. How many more skiing vacations do we have? You know, my dad's approaching 70s.
01:18:36.379 - 01:18:36.923, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:18:37.019 - 01:19:23.565, Speaker A: I'm like. And then so for me it's a no brainer when it's like, because king go skiing. My dad and I will never regret that I maybe have, I don't know, 1, 2, 5, probably no more than 10 good ski trips lined up. So when I think about it like I invert and I think about it like that, it just gives me so much focus of where I want to spend my time. Funny enough, I announced an investment in time fun which is trying to token is, is tokenizing time and it's trying to bring price discovery into time. And I think it's just going to be the best way. This primitive of time as a valuable instrument, commodity, an asset, I think is an area that I'm really excited to explore.
01:19:23.565 - 01:19:43.281, Speaker A: And there's web, two companies that have been trying to do this. But I think it's going to be interesting how this unfolds and maybe even gets layered into social apps. Right. You want to get my attention, you want to get a phone call, but other things. Right. And so I think it's. Yeah, it's going to be a fun experiment.
01:19:43.393 - 01:20:01.707, Speaker B: Yeah. The. I'm going to, I'm going to send you this time calendar post by Tim Urban. The thing that he, he wrote this one line, I haven't read it in years. That really hit with me is 98% of the time that you've spent with your parents is gone. Right. Because you grew up with them every single day.
01:20:01.707 - 01:20:04.179, Speaker B: And now, I mean rare moments.
01:20:04.227 - 01:20:04.675, Speaker A: Right.
01:20:04.795 - 01:20:08.691, Speaker B: Right. You only, let's say you're, let's say you're 40. You got, yeah.
01:20:08.723 - 01:20:10.147, Speaker A: You see your parents, your parents are.
01:20:10.171 - 01:20:20.651, Speaker B: 80 or something or your parents are 70. Right. You've got 20 years left with them and you might see them twice a year and five days at a time. Very finite amount of time.
01:20:20.803 - 01:20:24.015, Speaker A: So Think about that every day.
01:20:24.885 - 01:20:27.705, Speaker B: So great, positive note to end on.
01:20:28.925 - 01:21:14.595, Speaker A: Value your time and maybe as an experiment, thought experiment this weekend, think about something that you haven't done that you get a lot of value from, whether it's calling your parents, doing that thing that you've. Oh, here's the question. And I heard it in a podcast. It's like everyone always knows who their call would be if you were to say you got one call. Everyone is something that is very top of mind for people. Maybe it's your parents, maybe it's your loved one, or maybe it's something that you've always wanted to do and, you know, call that person that you wanted to get it off your chest. So I don't know, maybe it's worth doing before.
01:21:14.595 - 01:21:18.101, Speaker A: Before you're actually put on the hot spot.
01:21:18.223 - 01:21:26.805, Speaker B: Yeah, good call to action. There's also one last movie on this time concept called In Time. It was Justin Timberland.
01:21:27.185 - 01:21:27.985, Speaker A: I've seen that.
01:21:28.025 - 01:21:52.803, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. From like a, I don't know, 10 or 15 years ago. But you've got like time on your wrist, remember, and you pay for things in time. And there's these time billionaires and it's like you go to the casino and like you're buying in with chips. You give them time and you get time back. So you're like taking other people's very interesting concept. And then the really poor people, like, are always racing to do jobs to get more time or else they just die if they run out of time.
01:21:52.899 - 01:21:59.891, Speaker A: So that's the bull case for technologies. It will free us up of our time by creating abundance.
01:22:00.003 - 01:22:08.771, Speaker B: Ah, sorry, the last thing. And we're the last of the last. This Gavin Baker episode. Let's end. Okay. On an optimistic note. So I want to talk.
01:22:08.771 - 01:22:23.641, Speaker B: There's actually this Gavin Baker episode that he did with Patrick O'Shaughnessy. It's one of the best podcast episodes I've listened to all year. It has nothing to do with crypto. There are some crypto comparisons with. He's talking about investing in apps versus infrastructure. Why infrastructure is more exciting from an ROI perspective. Very.
01:22:23.641 - 01:22:28.337, Speaker B: There are a lot of similarities to crypto. I think we could have talked for 30 minutes about that, but let's make.
01:22:28.361 - 01:22:33.769, Speaker A: That the homework episode. People, go listen to that. We'll link it. We'll talk about an exp.
01:22:33.857 - 01:23:01.891, Speaker B: But if you want to get optimistic about the future, go listen to Gavin Baker Talking with Patrick O'Shaughnessy about Full Self driving. So, I mean, Gavin lays it out clear. We have solved Climate change. He says we have. He said to all the 20 year olds who are terror, don't want to bring kids into this world and crazy pessimistic all the time. Like, I don't know, a lot of Gen Z people are like crazy, crazy pessimistic and like, you know, refuse to bring. Yeah.
01:23:01.891 - 01:23:16.309, Speaker B: And I think there's a correlation with that sometimes. But they. He's like, we have solved it. We are compounding at 11% a year. It is like, go, I don't know, just go. Listen to this episode. It's very good.
01:23:16.477 - 01:23:21.069, Speaker A: Yeah. Thank you for sharing that immediate response to it. And I loved it.
01:23:21.157 - 01:23:21.445, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:23:21.485 - 01:23:32.133, Speaker A: So we'll link it, people listen to it, we'll talk about the next pod. So that's homework for people. Haven't given people homework in a while. Back in September. School's back in session. Get your ass. Hopefully you rested.
01:23:32.269 - 01:23:33.725, Speaker B: Yeah, we got homework, baby.
01:23:33.805 - 01:23:35.745, Speaker A: We got homework, baby. Let's go.
01:23:36.445 - 01:23:39.973, Speaker B: All right, I have the block works all hands. Now I gotta jump.
01:23:40.029 - 01:23:41.621, Speaker A: I am going to sleep. It's midnight.
01:23:41.733 - 01:24:04.053, Speaker B: Nice. Peace, sir. All right, thanks for watching today's episode. Just wanted to quickly mention that the wait for Crypto's killer app wave is nearly over.
