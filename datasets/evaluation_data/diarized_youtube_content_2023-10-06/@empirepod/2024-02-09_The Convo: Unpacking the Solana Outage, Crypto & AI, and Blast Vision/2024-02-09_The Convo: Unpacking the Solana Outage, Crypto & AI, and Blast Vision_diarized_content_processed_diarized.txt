00:00:01.040 - 00:00:16.070, Speaker A: The highest likelihood of any of it is that we still haven't seen the winner. We don't know the name of the actual underlying financial substrate that will guide the world in the future that that still has not been created.
00:00:16.102 - 00:00:17.754, Speaker B: I thought it was Blackrock chain.
00:00:22.014 - 00:00:44.374, Speaker C: What's up, everyone? Before we jump into the episode, little plug for digital asset Summit coming up in London, March 18 to 20th. Tickets are pacing so far ahead of schedule that we had to decline the discount code. So instead of Empire 20, it is now Empire ten. Head over to the website Digital asset Summit Das London, March 18 to 20th. Use code Empire ten and get 10% off your ticket. See you in London.
00:00:44.494 - 00:01:16.398, Speaker D: Hey, everyone, just a reminder that nothing said on this episode is a recommendation to buy or sell any securities or tokens. This podcast is for informational purposes only, and any views expressed by anyone on the show are solely our own personal opinions and not financial advice. Myself, Santiago, or Ryan may hold tokens personally, or their associated funds may have exposure to tokens or equities mentioned. Hey, everyone. Welcome back to the convo with Ryan, zur Santiago, and myself. Excited to talk today. We're going to cover Solana's outage.
00:01:16.398 - 00:01:28.640, Speaker D: We're going to talk about blast, we're going to talk crypto AI, and we're going to talk defining themes for 2024. So we'll get spicy. To start off, Ryan, let's talk about Solana's latest outage.
00:01:28.832 - 00:02:40.844, Speaker A: So it's almost like, you know, in the Simpsons opening montage where there's that thing of, of like, how many days without an accident? And Solana almost passed the one year without an accident but didn't get there. And now it goes back to zero days. And the big question is, does it matter? Does it matter to the Solana community? Does it matter to the broader community? But me looking at it, I would say for the institutional high transaction volume clients that Solana is trying to attract, it matters a lot. It clearly didn't matter to their core community this week because the price stayed relatively flat throughout this, and leadership seemed to brush it off as we saw Anatoly put out a tweet saying he had gone to sleep before it happened, woke up after it was solved, and he seemed unbothered by the whole thing. But I'm wondering from you guys, what is your take? Does this matter as investors, as community members, and what are the implications?
00:02:41.324 - 00:03:06.628, Speaker B: Of course it matters. Of course. You know, it's like that meme of, like, everyone's like, cracking their neck and, you know, let's go you know, theorems like Solana's had an incredible amount of attention and run up, and, you know, this is a moment to really dance on the grave for, so to speak. There is a big distinction. So, like, if we look, historically, this was a liveness failure. My understanding is not to bore people to death. Was that it's.
00:03:06.628 - 00:03:45.454, Speaker B: It. It was a known issue. They were working on a patch. It was related to, like, the validator kind of code base. And so, in this instance, yeah, it was close to the year. I believe this outage lasted 4 hours, 46 minutes. And relative to prior outages, one before that was, I believe, you know, February 25 of 2023, that outage lasted 18 hours.
00:03:45.454 - 00:04:34.942, Speaker B: So, you know, a lot more. And historically, look, I am not the most technically competent to speak to this, so I will go by what I've learned from the Solana dev community and trying to process everything that went on over the last couple of days. And, look, I don't want to brush it off or minimize it. I think I certainly agree with you. Like, liveness failures are no fun. It is a challenge. It is well known that, you know, Solana, as an ecosystem project, is much younger, as they were trying to push out a lot of the code from the Solana Labs Foundation.
00:04:34.942 - 00:04:53.116, Speaker B: I believe it's labs who did most of the coding. What you see now, you know, it's. Even Anatoly would concede they had to make certain compromises. One, they were really bootstrapped, and two, they just didn't have enough resources. Right. And they're sprinting. Now, that's like, I agree with you.
00:04:53.116 - 00:05:17.880, Speaker B: That's not a sufficient. I don't think it's meant to be an excuse. It's more meant to be just an acknowledgement of the state of Solana. It's a much younger project. They acknowledge these issues, and they're working on them. Right. I mean, you're gonna have fire dancer later this year, which, for anyone that's not familiar, fire dancer is under their client.
00:05:17.880 - 00:05:28.324, Speaker B: So that would add more redundancy to the chain, and that's huge. Right. Ethereum, I believe, has. Ryan, you know this better than three or four clients?
00:05:29.224 - 00:05:29.632, Speaker A: Four.
00:05:29.688 - 00:06:07.344, Speaker B: Yeah, four, exactly. So having more client diversity is essential. Fire dancer is developed by jump. There is an excellent blog posts by the Helios team that goes into a lot of detail. It's not just that you're going to have a second client, but a lot of the upgrades, both in terms of performance and reliability, are meaningful. And so, yeah, just part of the, you know, there's a reason why Solana trades at a fraction of what Ethereum trades at.
00:06:08.124 - 00:07:15.564, Speaker A: Sure, but I mean, Solana trades at 56, you know, versus Ethereum's 220, and so let's call that a quarter. And the big question that comes to mind is the fact that Ethereum didn't have major liveness issues four years into live chain. This is core value proposition to Solana. Like, imagine what it costs a visa to have 4 hours and 46 minutes of outage time, and how they must be taking a pause with all of this. We're relatively large deployers in the Solana Defi ecosystem, where we see a lot of very raw products and code base, and it does beg the question. It clearly was undervalued at some point over the course of last year. But has it gone over its skis versus where it is technically?
00:07:16.624 - 00:07:17.884, Speaker B: What do you mean by raw?
00:07:20.344 - 00:08:08.284, Speaker A: For example, Defi pools don't pull directly from rpcs, and you have to run command line to deploy a lot of capital. And we're talking about a second client from a relatively centralized source in literally year four. So there's a lot of extra software to be built out from here. For it to be in a comp category with Ethereum, for it to be a quarter of Ethereum's value. One would think that the DeFi ecosystem should be relatively intuitive, like Defi and Solana for retail right now. Really challenging if you don't have good engineering resources. Best of luck to all players in the game.
00:08:08.284 - 00:08:26.084, Speaker A: And that's the question that I look at is, again, clearly it was undervalued, but has it run too much versus where it is in its moment? Is it just ahead of its moment in valuation at this point, at one quarter of Ethereum, or roughly just, you know?
00:08:27.044 - 00:09:13.528, Speaker D: Yeah, I think so. The way I'm thinking about it is I expected Solana to have more growing pains, but I think the less time of this outage is obviously better. Right? That's like an improvement. I think the thing that would really screw me up is if Firedancer was released and was not performant, that's what I think would be obviously very bad. So I think the market is pricing in a very strong fire dancer release, significant upgrades. You know, people are okay with lack of client diversity at this point and are overweighting the performance from Fire Dancer, which is great. But I think if that comes out and there are issues there, that's going to be way more disastrous than the labs client having issues.
00:09:13.528 - 00:09:14.280, Speaker D: Does that make sense?
00:09:14.312 - 00:09:22.872, Speaker A: Or so success in firedancer is priced in, and that is compensatory against the outages.
00:09:23.048 - 00:10:00.184, Speaker B: Look, I don't know exactly. First of all, I don't think you ever know what's priced in just to get the bitcoin happenings. We're 70 days out. Is it priced in? Historically, it's never been priced in. So, like, something as predictable as that is not priced in. What makes you think that fire dancer is priced in? I don't think. I guess if you were to survey, most people in the market don't have a true appreciation of what firedancer is, or ANSA, which is a third dev shop building another client.
00:10:00.184 - 00:10:36.134, Speaker B: I don't think. I mean, Ryan, your point around is Solana current valuation relative to Ethereum, accurate? I would argue it's not. It's undervalued. I don't want to minimize this outage. I mean, I think I was kind of expecting it to happen sooner, given the incredible amount of activity that you've seen in a very short order. Like there's just been. Let's put it in perspective.
00:10:36.134 - 00:11:31.380, Speaker B: Over the last couple of months, the number of activity across Defi and other applications like Drip, tensor has been incredible. I would have expected, like, I would have expected, if anything, the network to go down during the Jupiter claim, which was, you know, put a lot of, I would have thought, would have put a ton of strain on the network. And in fact, the network performed really smoothly. Priority fees kicking in is something that is pretty encouraging from my standpoint. I think the issues with Solana are well known, documented, and go listen to a lot of pods that Anatoly has been on recently, including mine, Empire, Lightspeed.
00:11:31.412 - 00:11:33.604, Speaker A: And, well, include including this one in a couple weeks.
00:11:33.644 - 00:11:36.024, Speaker B: Yeah, I think they're.
00:11:36.644 - 00:11:37.644, Speaker A: Ask him directly.
00:11:37.684 - 00:12:07.362, Speaker B: Yeah, but I would have thought that the network, if anything, would have gone down sooner, particularly during either the Cheeto or most recently, the Jupiter airdrop claim. But when I say what gives me the most amount of conviction. Yeah, look, I hear you, Ryan. Solana is, you know, to say that, look, it's a baby chain is not really right. I mean, it's 50 billion worth of baby chain. That doesn't constitute a baby chain. And it's been a couple years out.
00:12:07.362 - 00:12:52.754, Speaker B: But the reality of things is, I almost think that in reality, for me at least, Solana is a very different chain. It's just gotten the quality of projects. I hear you. While still not perfect, I think the quality of products on the Solana ecosystem are superior to many of what you see. Not comparing just to Ethereum. Just are products that I would send a uninitiated person in crypto to try out first, particularly tensor and Jupiter. But I'm not here to debate the retail side.
00:12:52.754 - 00:13:07.814, Speaker B: I'm here more, to debate more with you guys. The fundamental question is, is it acceptable? I think it's unrealistic to assume that any chain is not going to have issues. Right. There's always going to be bugs. You've had bugs at bitcoin. Pretty serious when you. Fat bugs in ethereum.
00:13:07.814 - 00:13:13.138, Speaker B: I mean, this is part of the game. Right, Santiago?
00:13:13.186 - 00:13:36.260, Speaker D: So one thing that's different versus the last outage is there's obviously way more usage on Solana. I think. I mean, just, I think so now versus in the past. Right. So the ripple effects of an outage could be, like, quantified, it's larger. Like, I don't think we even have, like, an instant report out yet. But do you have any idea of how this affected Solana, defi trading, you know, the whole nine yards there?
00:13:36.292 - 00:14:09.890, Speaker B: Like, yeah, I don't have a post mortem. I think the impact I was looking at, a couple of people reach out to the Jupiter team, say, hey, well, what's going to happen, right, some of these positions, like, is there a bad debt? I don't think it was. Yeah, I haven't seen a post mortem. There's a short answer to that. And you're right, the biggest risk during these outages is particularly defi. Right. You have, like, oracle, like, these pride this, see, like, centralized exchanges keep processing these trades, and so there's a price.
00:14:09.890 - 00:14:52.834, Speaker B: There's an oracle there. And so once the network is back online, you might be, you might be instantly liquidated. So, yeah, I haven't seen a post mortem, but I suspect it's not as big because it wasn't that much of movement as Ryan alluded to earlier in prices. Different story. If, like, Solana would have been down 10% in prior just happened or other Defi assets would have been down, like, you know, quite a lot. But I don't think this was the case in this instance. Maybe because most of the world was sleeping, like, wow, I guess, like, you know, like, in the west coast, like, just went to bed and wake up and nothing, as if nothing can happen.
00:14:53.454 - 00:15:25.414, Speaker A: Defi remains strong. I mean, we, when, when we were talking in November, it was around that $300 million range, and, and, like, it had come down really precipitously. But now we're talking about, you know, 1.5 billion. I actually think it's going to be closer to two or 3 billion and maybe a month because of all of the interesting stuff going in that ecosystem. And to your point, there are some. You know, there is some rawness to work out, but there's a lot of excitement.
00:15:25.414 - 00:15:40.124, Speaker A: And, like, what is the. What are some of the one or one to three things that cause you to conclude that not only is it not over its skis in spite of the challenges, but its undervalued versus its peers?
00:15:40.284 - 00:16:17.814, Speaker D: Trey, I mean, to take it a different way, I think the thing that Im struggling with, with ETH is just the obvious question of long term value flows in a fractured environment. Like, you have ETH a settlement, you have Eigen and Celestia as Da layers and a couple others coming online. Then you have the l two s. Like, the modular stack is awesome. And seeing the celestia tweets from Nick White on all the money that roll ups would save by using them is phenomenal. But that's all money that's not going to ETH L1. So I am struggling a bit to understand where the best place to play ETH is long term.
00:16:17.814 - 00:16:46.772, Speaker D: And the DA layers have their own concerns on. On value capture themselves, because all the money they save is clearly not money they are making. So, that's sort of one issue that I'm struggling with on e, which is kind of ironic, because on slide, you get composability by default and fast fees and money. Now we have this uncomposable value capture issue, which I'm struggling with. But, yeah, I definitely did not answer your question, Ryan. I took it a different way, but.
00:16:46.868 - 00:17:06.274, Speaker A: Maybe you answered it via the counterfactual. And you're saying maybe, relatively speaking, ETH is just over its skis because of these really significant architectural challenges. So that does answer it. That is a way to why one would be outlier. Bullish. Solana, right now.
00:17:06.654 - 00:17:13.382, Speaker D: Yeah. And, I mean, the amount of ETH locked up is also phenomenal. Right? Like the amount in blast, the amount.
00:17:13.438 - 00:17:21.393, Speaker B: In, what is it, 25% of all ETH is staked across Eigen layer? L two s and a bunch of other places.
00:17:22.093 - 00:17:29.233, Speaker D: Yeah. And we're. I mean, we're investors in eigen layer. I'm an angel. Like, I. I love seeing the traction there. I think that.
00:17:29.233 - 00:17:41.813, Speaker D: I mean, there's a lot of different restaking options. You can do etherfy. You could do Renzo puffer. There's a lot of options, and it makes sense. Right. Eigen layer has caps. You can go through these protocols, earn extra to earn their points.
00:17:41.813 - 00:18:15.134, Speaker D: Or tokens and then also get some pro rata access. So I think the adoption that Eigen layer has on the supply side is phenomenal and definitely blew my expectations out of the water. The questions I have on that side are obviously rehypothecation risk. So you slash eats somewhere, how does that affect the rest of the system? And then to the demand side, what is actually being built beyond Eigen? Da, I think is my two largest things I'm tracking right now. But yeah, it kind of just goes back to the ETH side.
00:18:15.434 - 00:19:15.720, Speaker B: By the way, Tommy, check out the Q and A that Shuram and the Eigen layer team posted recently around this rehypothecation and a bunch of other questions. It was quite useful, I think. My big look, not to get to on a tangent here, but yeah, just go read it. Because I think the risk is not so much in rehypothecation at the Eigen layer layer at least certainly on like, who you like the restakers. But it's really around like this idea that the chain and the scalability roadmap of Ethereum is being, I guess, delegated to a whole set of other parties. And particularly my biggest issue with Eigen, when I first heard the pitch from Calvin and Saram, I guess maybe butchering his name, is that they're going to have this like Security Council to determine the security parameters. Initially I'm going to select this few people to set these guardrails.
00:19:15.720 - 00:19:27.164, Speaker B: And when I hear that, it makes. It gives me pause. I'm sure there are competent people to make this determination, but a lot of it is just difficult.
00:19:28.272 - 00:19:37.444, Speaker D: And to. I absolutely would want a centralized council making those decisions to start. I definitely do not want a community of add ons like deciding risk engine.
00:19:37.604 - 00:20:19.802, Speaker B: I'm not suggesting that an anon would do it. I'm just saying the point around, I guess, like, I much rather see trust minimize systems. And the original conception of a theorem is just trust minimize. Like, you don't need to trust anyone, right? And now you, you're seeing certainly, like, I think the scalability roam up of theorem is something that perhaps we should debate at some point. I I don't think it's impossible. I think composability at one point, if your guys were DeF Con and Kyoto was like the word, right, you're gonna break composability. I think breaking composability is not the right mindset.
00:20:19.802 - 00:20:50.644, Speaker B: I think the Internet, when I go talk to core engineers way back in the day, I think a lot of what you think about composability. Not everything needs to have atomicity and it's a spectrum, and I think you can fix that with better connectivity between chains. I think it's solvable. I don't want to come across because most recently I've been, of course, very vocal about Solana. Most of my portfolio is still ethereum centric, folks, I hope I can't unwind.
00:20:50.724 - 00:20:51.584, Speaker D: Say it again.
00:20:51.984 - 00:21:42.846, Speaker B: I will say it again. Most of my historical and current portfolio, because I invest in early stage projects, are skewed heavily, heavily on the Ethereum camp. But. Well, but that doesn't mean that I will say do not like. I think I've just gotten frustrated with the lack of visibility into how Ethereum really becomes a chain that can attract like, mainstream adoption. And I hear you on the celestial pitch, I hear you on like modularity, and certainly it gives us more breathing room. And I think maybe that's, that's the, maybe that is the bull case for Ethereum, which is the human capital, the developer side, which, you know, it's like high school.
00:21:42.846 - 00:22:46.174, Speaker B: You at the last minute figure shit out and hand in the homework and you, humanity has a way of fixing things in the last minute and I'm never going to short that side because ethereum dominates. But I just see a very clear path for Solana to when I see how it has been able to handle a surge in activity. I think it would be unfair to look at this network outage, which was known issue, which is recently this upgrade called the Berkeley packet filter. It was like a recent improvement, and they knew the issue, they were fixing it and it just sort of, the network went down. But I think it would be a bit unfair to look at this and say, oh, Solana is just a centralized vc coin. Sam from prison is probably seeing memes of the Nintendo 64 blowing in the cassette. That misses the point.
00:22:46.174 - 00:23:00.574, Speaker B: And there's still a lot of people that are offsides, a lot of people that haven't been paying enough attention to Solana. I think it is still a very non consensus trade and crypto is still very much non consensus, so doubly non consensus.
00:23:02.554 - 00:23:14.858, Speaker A: Interesting. Well, that's great feedback. With that, let's switch gears and dive into the crossover of crypto and AI.
00:23:14.986 - 00:23:25.338, Speaker B: One last thing, Ryan, last pod. I think it's funny because we were talking about the Solana phone and, you know, you really dismissed that and now you're gonna have egg on my face.
00:23:25.386 - 00:23:26.946, Speaker A: On the Solana for all three of that.
00:23:27.010 - 00:23:31.266, Speaker B: Not, not to put you on the spot. I don't think it's like.
00:23:31.290 - 00:23:34.890, Speaker D: Like, it sounds like you're putting them on the spot. No, no.
00:23:35.082 - 00:24:03.324, Speaker B: Hey, listen. The question was more directed around Ryan. You're someone that has paid a lot of attention. You all are playing in Solana. It sounds like everyone here has invested in projects that just didn't get off the ground or haven't gone off the ground. Have you changed your mind on something in particular about Solana as of late, given everything that's been going on, both good and bad and neutral? But have you revisited your thesis on Solana?
00:24:06.744 - 00:25:10.204, Speaker A: Absolutely. I mean, I think you come back to it consistently. And from the time of the seed saft investment up to now, it has been this sort of like, give and take of, okay, this feels over at skis, and then, okay, you know, actually, they're doing some really interesting things, and this is a genuine community. That's one of the things that was very obvious of 2023, that you had to respect the fact that it's a really legitimate community of network devs and people taking a very different approach to the almost religiosity of bitcoin, or derivative of that with Ethereum, where decentralization trumps all. And you must sacrifice so much more for that, because that that trumps all their different approaches, is really compelling. And I think they brought new energy into the space. And there are some really interesting things.
00:25:10.204 - 00:25:21.204, Speaker A: The phone. I certainly respect the fact that you can pay for the phone with airdrops. I think thats a great idea.
00:25:23.504 - 00:25:23.816, Speaker B: As.
00:25:23.840 - 00:26:16.634, Speaker A: A venture capitalist, would question the, the wisdom of going and fighting the holy war against an apple and a Google in phones on your own while trying to run a chain. And so there are red flags. And I think that's fair. I deploy capital mostly in yielding, but also speculatively in the ecosystem right now, but do so very tepidly and do so questioning myself at every. At every corner, because I don't. You guys must go through the same thing. But the more time that we spend in this game, the more somewhat unsure of myself I am, and the more I'm questioning my own, my own hypothesis.
00:26:16.634 - 00:26:56.526, Speaker A: And just, like, trying to stick to a framework, I don't propose to have the solution on Solana right now. I suppose in this exact moment, I take a little bit of the other side and I say, man, a quarter to a fifth of Ethereum in this moment feels expensive because of my perspective from yielding and the quality of the yielding ecosystem in EVM versus quality of the yielding system in this moment in Solana. But at the same time, they evolve much faster than Ethereum because they don't have all this architectural technical debt.
00:26:56.670 - 00:26:57.366, Speaker B: What's up, everyone?
00:26:57.430 - 00:27:12.134, Speaker C: Quick break from the show to talk about digital asset summit. This is going to be blockworks 8th das. We've been hosting this since 2019. It's our longest running conference series, coming up March 18 to 20th in sunny London town. Spring in London. You don't want to miss it. It's a crazy lineup.
00:27:12.134 - 00:27:39.150, Speaker C: Definitely our craziest Das yet just added Michael Sonnenscheim from Grayscale, the head of digital asset research at Franklin Templeton. We've got DRW, we've got KKR, we've got Marshall wace group. We have Bloomberg, we have visa, we have Wintermute, we have Vanek, we have FIS. We've got the framework. Folks joining us, one CAC coin shares, JPMorgan, Standard Chartered, QCP, Morgan Creek. Santi is coming, of course. Ledger CEO and chairman Pascal will be there.
00:27:39.150 - 00:27:52.808, Speaker C: It is going to be a phenomenal event. You don't want to miss it. Tickets are pacing so far ahead of schedule that unfortunately we can't offer 20% off anymore. There's a new code, Empire ten. Empire ten is going to get you 10% off. See you in London.
00:27:52.896 - 00:28:35.694, Speaker B: What? Uh, maybe perhaps if you guys can entertain a question, because I would be curious to understand what are you most excited about from the Ethereum scalability roadmap? Is it parallelization through some like Monad? Is it zkvms? Is it modularity like celestia type of stuff, really compressing down costs? All of the above? A lot has happened, I guess, and it's increasingly happening. It's hard to keep up. But I'm curious if you guys are what is it that you're most excited about from Ethereum side?
00:28:39.954 - 00:29:30.850, Speaker D: So the thing that I'm most excited about is also the thing that I think is the biggest issue. So Solana narrative, very simple. Fastest global state machine, speed of light, yada yada. I'll let someone on Solana crack me on that on Twitter after this goes live. The Ethereum side I think the thing I'm most excited about is also the problem in that there are so many teams building. I don't think any of us, and I've tried to find a guest to do this, could conceptualize everything that's going on in the short amount of time or reasoning that makes sense. I don't think you can ever put the dozens of l two and infra teams now building around Ethereum in a concise way that makes the narrative super sticky and understood.
00:29:30.850 - 00:29:52.924, Speaker D: So it's positive in that there's all these teams building. It's negative in that the narrative is not a catchy one liner. But I don't know any other way that it's going to play out other than the things built on top get mega popular. That drives value back to ETH as a settlement layer, and that's sort of the narrative, but.
00:29:53.824 - 00:29:58.324, Speaker B: Well, this narrative for the value accrual, but not so much on how to get billions of users.
00:29:59.384 - 00:30:08.214, Speaker D: Yeah, well it is though, because the hydra of apps built on top of ETH on l two s will directly target users. It doesn't have to be on the l one.
00:30:08.254 - 00:30:10.074, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm pushing the fees.
00:30:10.894 - 00:30:11.422, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:30:11.518 - 00:30:12.394, Speaker D: Oh, sorry.
00:30:12.974 - 00:31:07.714, Speaker A: I think we have probably, we've clearly not seen the emergent one that will capture like the millions of retail users. The thing that I'm excited about with respect to ethereum scalability is capital efficiency and capital sinkholes. So capital efficiency is just what you guys were talking about. Rehypothecation. New ways to yield and use that capital such that it's compounding and accruing back to ETH as a base layer, and then ETH is a base layer. I am resigned to the fact that if you own less than $1,000 in an ETH address, get it out in the next x number of months, because eventually its going to be dust. It will have a certain cost.
00:31:07.714 - 00:31:58.734, Speaker A: And thats because of the second thing, the capital sinkholes, where there are all these ways to use capital and efficiently rehypothecate capital such that it sucks up a lot of ETH. There isnt that much circulating. Ethan. Then as a result, you get appreciation. And I think that generally that will drive interest because of the financial incentivization, people are making money and it's scalable because of that. One of my core theses right now is that the financial use case for the foreseeable future is the killer app of crypto. And thats okay.
00:31:58.734 - 00:32:29.274, Speaker A: We dont actually necessarily need social and need a whole bunch of other things. All we need to do is be able to give decentralized loans and hopefully do decentralized capital formation, aka IcO 2.0 on the horizon. And thats fine. And if we can just do that, that will attract millions of users. Because if you give a man an incentive and a lever, he can move the world. He'll get, he'll figure out which l two and he'll figure out all the mess of it all because he's financially incentivized.
00:32:29.274 - 00:32:37.814, Speaker A: To do so because this is where the capital is flowing because of capital efficiency and capital sinkholes. Sorry, that was a bit long winded.
00:32:38.634 - 00:32:39.802, Speaker D: No, it's not long winded at all.
00:32:39.818 - 00:33:06.994, Speaker B: It's great both of you guys have touched on, I agree, the financial gimmicks of restaking, rehypothecating. Yeah, like, go fucking farm yams. Like, it was fun, I get it. But none of you guys have touched on fees. And when I think of, to your point, Ryan, what about the user that has less than a speculate? Impossible.
00:33:07.774 - 00:33:08.286, Speaker A: Impossible.
00:33:08.310 - 00:33:08.822, Speaker B: I don't know.
00:33:08.918 - 00:33:11.394, Speaker A: Main chain and an l two man.
00:33:11.934 - 00:33:46.240, Speaker B: Who knows, you still got a bridge. Bridge to it. And it is challenge. It is. You know, I would encourage listeners, you guys, for me, one of the more eye opening experiences in this journey was I've constantly, like re underwriting my thesis, talk to some project like drip, like compressed nfts. The ability to do things at like meaningfully orders of magnitude cheaper than even an l two s. You'd be like, yeah, so what? L two s are pretty cheap.
00:33:46.240 - 00:34:26.282, Speaker B: And I get it today. But look, so much in investing is understanding the present. I think l two s today can support way more users than what they have. But there is, I think, a limitation to that, and I don't see that big of a problem with Solana. There's other issues for sure. They're going to have to implement an EIP 1559 fees, you know, not perfect, but they're like on the margin is what I'm trying to convey. I see more fundamental issues, more leap of faith on the Ethereum scalability roadmap.
00:34:26.282 - 00:34:32.454, Speaker B: Not to say that it won't be figured out. I just think it carries actually more risk than perhaps people are willing to acknowledge today.
00:34:33.434 - 00:34:35.930, Speaker A: Whereas Solana, certainly inertia.
00:34:36.122 - 00:35:15.504, Speaker B: Yeah, and you're betting on fantastic developers that time and time again have risen to the occasion. And I think quality of devs is superior in Ethereum or, you know, it just attracts a lot of attention because the liquidity has been there historically. I'm just not so sure that that will continue to be true going forward. If you're a builder, I asked every portfolio company that is deciding on which chain to build. I'm like, yeah, I understand. Like, I'm an investor in many l two s that we're going to talk about. See an investor in scroll blast, arbitrum montage, like a lot.
00:35:15.504 - 00:35:43.244, Speaker B: Why? Because I just want to see these things work. But today I just genuinely asked the question, like, what can you get out of all of these that you will not be like that you're not getting, like, why not just build in Solana with fire dancers performance wise and maybe Ryan. Yeah, that's, hey, well, the chain goes out and there's network outages, and that's fair criticism and we can leave it at that.
00:35:44.744 - 00:35:47.440, Speaker A: You know, we shall see.
00:35:47.512 - 00:36:15.204, Speaker D: Well, Santi, to your, to your point, I mean, one thing ceteris at Delphi or head of research always brought up was that, like, the design space of a chain with such low fees has never truly been exercise to its full potential. There hasnt been years and years of which to create apps that could take advantage of that low fee market. And I think thats a really good bull case for Solana as well. And up what you guys are talking about.
00:36:17.064 - 00:36:35.204, Speaker B: Yeah, there will be many, my view, and Ryan, I think we can all agree, and I know were supposed to disagree, but, you know, it's a multi chain world in my mind. Not all applications require composability, not applications require the same level of security trust assumptions.
00:36:35.984 - 00:36:53.080, Speaker A: But, you know, the highest likelihood of any of it is that we still haven't seen the winner. Like, we don't know the name of the actual, you know, underlying financial substrate that will guide the world in the future that that still has not been created.
00:36:53.112 - 00:36:54.764, Speaker B: I thought it was Blackrock chain.
00:37:00.624 - 00:37:07.744, Speaker D: Blackrock's busy buying up all the single family homes and pricing single mothers out of their houses. Well, that's the Instagram memes are going.
00:37:07.784 - 00:37:09.844, Speaker B: Blackstone or Blackrock? You're talking about.
00:37:10.264 - 00:37:10.736, Speaker D: Sorry.
00:37:10.800 - 00:37:13.704, Speaker B: Yeah, Blackstone real estate. I'm talking about black.
00:37:13.784 - 00:37:14.184, Speaker D: Sorry.
00:37:14.264 - 00:37:15.564, Speaker B: Come on, man, get it.
00:37:17.684 - 00:37:21.424, Speaker D: It was a late one. I get one mess up.
00:37:22.484 - 00:38:04.094, Speaker A: We can see that Vegas landscape in the back. So, actually, let's hear from you. I want to hear the Tommy Shahana seat viewpoint on the crossover of crypto and AI and where you're excited, uh, about these, these two important technologies, which there has been this ridiculous false dichotomy created of, like, ah, people in crypto should leave and, like, go to AI. And it's like, actually, the two are incredibly enabling for each other. And so I want to hear more of how you think through that.
00:38:04.794 - 00:38:50.008, Speaker D: All right, I'll try and I'll try and keep it quick. I'm on the spot. So, I guess the, my interest got peaked with mid journey, right? I think that's what, over 18 months ago, I gave that a shot and was just blown away by what you could make. Type in a prompt, get a picture. Super cool, right? That significantly accelerated with chasupt launching as who else sort of went into a slight existential crisis like, are we in a simulation? Does this all work? Yada yada. Ended up realizing that large language models like chat GPT are obviously not Arnold Schwarzenegger terminators. They're really good at finishing our sentences.
00:38:50.008 - 00:39:35.954, Speaker D: They don't have any creativity, thought value system, anything like that. It's almost like confusing the user on how good they are. So they're trained on the world's Internet goes into a system fine tunes, aka changes a billion, zero and ones to certain numbers. And when you write a prompt, it goes through that system. So that was sort of my journey with llms and chat GBT. But then I further got solidified that crypto AI is perfect. Given the OpenAI drama, the concept that you have a board of what looked like high school teachers, I think one was controlling the most powerful foundational model on earth is just extremely laughable.
00:39:35.954 - 00:40:22.200, Speaker D: And the idea that that could change hands back to Sam Altman and crew over a weekend is ridiculous. So imagine not just chat GPT that you have now that you're entering chats into, but the chat GPT App Store. There's 3 million GPTs built on that foundational model. If you slightly change that model, let's change it a little bit so that we hate Santiago. Let's change it a little bit so we like Solana. That reverberates through every application built on top of chat GPT and literally changes the flow of society. So at a foundational level, I think that the most powerful open, most powerful models should be open source, should be transparent, and should live in a crypto like world.
00:40:22.200 - 00:40:58.434, Speaker D: They should not be centralized like OpenAI, and we should be able to see them. So thats sort of my core thesis for why AI and crypto go together. The other kind of tidbits are that I think in the future, on the long arc to Agi, Agi will be using crypto. Theyre never going to go into a bank branch. Theyre never going to trust a Charles Schwab account. Theyre going to use permissionless money to build their own purposes. Another angle is that all the latent hardware we have around the world, Macs, PS five, s, et cetera, should be used to train these models.
00:40:58.434 - 00:41:33.222, Speaker D: There is a cost that people will pay to do that. The Jensen folks talk about that's just increasing the amount of energy in the world. Having all these extra gpu's to train models or to do inference and host those models against to run prompts, I think is massive. That's like ionet, Akash, Jensen, they're all doing that. The other side of it, one level up the stack is just smarter apps. Uniswap liquidity provision is really hard. Let's create an off chain AI model that is large and can handle that effectively.
00:41:33.222 - 00:42:02.480, Speaker D: And when you want to rebalance your position now, you could ping that model and move things around. Applications get really smart. Another angle is the user side. Right. Llms make it really easy to use crypto. So instead of bridge by ETH to stake ETH, to put it into a pool, to lever up yada yada, just type your intent in a large language model, see the simulated result, and hit send. So, yeah, there's a lot of ways this can go.
00:42:02.480 - 00:42:09.364, Speaker D: I have pros and cons for Bittensor and other projects, but I'll stop there for right now.
00:42:10.164 - 00:43:25.642, Speaker B: Yeah, I share a lot of views. So a lot of my education and AI has come from specific folks like Daniel Modulus, which I'm an investor in, and they're doing verification. Being able to prove that the model is actually doing and performing in the way that you told it or telling it to, and that becomes quite valuable. You know, a model could go rogue, so to speak, and having the guarantee that it's not is pretty valuable. And I am, you know, I've looked at, to your point, Tommy, I've looked at the decentralized kind of compute, like a deep in angle, like, you know, for training purposes, like the Akash and bit tensors of the world. I'm curious to get your thoughts around, like, two things. One, are you more excited about inference or training of these models? And second, you know, talking.
00:43:25.642 - 00:43:35.584, Speaker B: Going back to the initial discussion, I think it's unrealistic to deploy an LLM on Ethereum. Can't handle it.
00:43:39.484 - 00:43:43.504, Speaker D: He had to bring it back to Solana ride. It was five minutes too long.
00:43:45.964 - 00:43:50.144, Speaker B: I'm not saying it has to be staying, not saying it has to be Solana.
00:43:50.964 - 00:45:40.674, Speaker A: I'm just saying Alec had a hilarious tweet in, like, I think it was sort of mid 2017 where he said, people who are talking about AI on top of blockchain, why do you want to live your life in this way? The context of those blockchains? It was a ridiculous conversation, right, to talk, learning, using Gollum or something like that, on top of Ethereum main net. It just like, like, to his point, like, why, like, why do you even want to live your life in this way? Um, that's fair. You know, one of the. There are obviously some like, low hanging fruit, that that can be compelling. Like, are you guys looking at, um, at any startups focusing on, uh, attribution of, uh, of data, like, data inputs into. Into models? So, for example, it would seem like a logical use of crypto technologies is getting that decentralized attribution so that value can be shared across all of the necessary tokens or data points that compose to make an output. So if I go and say, what were the top ten news headlines of the day? That you can use a cryptographic proof that shows that they pulled one headline from the New York Times and one from the Economist, and one from here and there and everywhere, and then those entities can be paid in a secure, trustless, and even private fashion for the data that they supply to the model that creates the output.
00:45:40.674 - 00:46:09.714, Speaker A: That seems to solve one of the big problems that very clearly, AI has this tsunami problem on the horizon of the fact that theyre using all of this intellectual property and not pay for it, and they got to find a way to pay for it. And it would seem that crypto is the most efficient path to getting these disparate parties to align on a payment mechanism. Is that something that you guys are looking at?
00:46:10.324 - 00:46:20.384, Speaker B: Well, didn't. What's his name? He. There's a decentralized hedge fund model. Right. You would upload your model. There is. You would upload your model, and if your model outperformed, like, you get.
00:46:20.924 - 00:46:24.124, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, yeah. Numerous. Yeah.
00:46:24.164 - 00:46:24.548, Speaker B: What is it?
00:46:24.596 - 00:47:58.100, Speaker A: I happen to be enumerai numeroi. I happen to be an investor, however. So with, you know, day one, you know, 2015 investment, the interesting thing about the numerai story is that, and this is my observation from the outside, because they have to homomorphically encrypt the data before they share it with the tournament participants. There is an argument that I have made observationally, that you may have greater loss in the quality of the data and the inference that you can derive from it because it's hidden behind homomorphic encryption, than you gain by having the wisdom of the crowd. And thus, it becomes really difficult because you have that veil of the homomorphic encryption, to outperform, say, you know, like the medallion fund or whoever else on Wall street, because they don't have to worry about that part of the privacy of the underlying data. I do say that having, with the tip of the hat, that Richard Crabe and his team have performed exceedingly well and very consistently up market, down market numerai continues to do really well, and. But, like, it doesn't have those, like, you know, those massive outlier gain years like a citadel will have.
00:47:58.100 - 00:48:05.536, Speaker A: And I would argue that that is probably the missing link, is that you have to hide it all behind homomorphic.
00:48:05.720 - 00:48:39.410, Speaker B: Wait a minute. But the lizard brain of mine. My basic understanding of homomorphic encryption is you take any set of data, and if you don't trust, you don't. So if you're an analyst, you don't want other people to look at your model, because, hey, it's alpha, but you're going to submit it. No one's going to be able to see the model, just a result. Right? But the model, you can train an LLM with homomorphic encrypted data, and the LLM itself becomes superior. So say that, like, ten analysts upload their models.
00:48:39.410 - 00:49:09.354, Speaker B: It's homomorphically encrypted. You can still. The whole point of that is to train a model with all these data sets and only like. And you care about, like, the result. The model becomes smarter, adapts, takes all these inputs, but the whole notion is that the people behind it can't look at each other's models and copy that. But the LLM itself becomes smarter as a result because it's ingesting more data. The quality of data should be higher.
00:49:09.354 - 00:49:17.290, Speaker B: So I'm lost in the point you made, which is the wisdom of the crowds. Like, should be.
00:49:17.362 - 00:50:34.354, Speaker A: So let's say. Let's take a really trivial case. Let's say we're trading a bunch of stocks, and these stocks have a number of data sets. It's like weather and tea and some economic data and things like that. And then you hash that underlying data. The argument there is that in hashing that underlying data, so that look behind homomorphic encryption so that it can be shared with these groups, and then they can evaluate the trends between those data points in order to create models, or the inference between PE and weather and how those interact, and then the model will create a more intelligent output because of that. The sort of loss of data quality by going and holding it behind a hash of a homomorphic encryption, prevents the model from getting that really outlier insight, because it's just an inference.
00:50:34.354 - 00:51:25.714, Speaker A: And so even if it's like, let's say it's like 5% loss of data, you're talking about something that is harder than the Olympics. Let's say it's a 1% loss of data. You're done against a citadel over that 1% is their lunch money. The question is, can you make that 1% up or that 5% or whatever, that small loss of data quality up by using the wisdom of the crowd across a number of models, and I think that remains to be seen. Now, again, numerai does pretty well. It's not citadel, though. It's not millennium, but it does pretty well.
00:51:25.714 - 00:51:39.494, Speaker A: And I would argue that the reason, the thing that holds it back from being that, like, dominant global capital pool is that, like, small bit of data quality loss through the encryption process.
00:51:39.794 - 00:51:51.534, Speaker D: To your point is how do you choose what models being used for what inference? Right. Like there's going to be billions of models, right, exactly.
00:51:52.114 - 00:51:57.298, Speaker A: Like they don't know that it's weather data. They have to infer that it's weather data. Right, exactly.
00:51:57.346 - 00:52:21.902, Speaker D: Like something with bitten sour is like a good example. Like they have 30 subnets. Every subnet does something different. Model creators upload their models to each subnet in an effort to provide the best value to the inference provider. So if you're doing image generation, all three of us upload our fine tuned image models. Mine's Adam a. Ryan, yours hyper realistic.
00:52:21.902 - 00:52:40.026, Speaker D: Santiago has Solana on top of every picture for his. You know, how do we gauge which inference is the best one? Right. And I think deciding which model is going to be used in each situation is going to be really hard, and I don't think bit tensor solve that or anyone else.
00:52:40.090 - 00:52:44.274, Speaker B: Well, doesn't the market solve itself like the market solves this problem very efficiently.
00:52:44.314 - 00:53:00.582, Speaker D: Right, but how, though? If you have a million images, image models created, you have to run each inference against each of those models and get feedback from every customer to then rate them. Yeah, it's very hard once it's images.
00:53:00.638 - 00:53:32.794, Speaker B: Economic challenge. Right. Because not everyone's going to have the ability to do that at scale and well resourced players. This is why technology is a centralizing force, the only shot that we have. Right. Because this would dictate over number of iterations. The well capitalized players might not have the most superior model initially, but they just become the de facto standard because they were able to play this game farther out than a less capitalized player.
00:53:32.794 - 00:54:34.828, Speaker B: Crypto comes along. And I think this is, from a more philosophical standpoint, why crypto is essential in this transformation that we're going to see in AI is because technology is an incredibly centralizing force. And the only shot that we have is to prevent AI to be incredibly, even more centralizing than what we've seen today is by creating more sophisticated coordination mechanisms with better incentives that make it the superior alternative. Now, what does that actually mean in practice? I have theories, but I don't think it's a bit tenser in Akash as they look today, candidly, or even I like, it's gonna take a lot of work because you can just go to, you can use the time and time. Ryan, you remember these fucking pitches back in 2017? Like, let's build a decentralized Uber. I'm like, why? I want to fucking use. Who do I call? Airbnb.
00:54:34.828 - 00:54:59.384, Speaker B: Centralized Airbnb. Who do I call? Like, how do I resolve this? We need. We need to up our game in crypto. The stakes are getting higher. The opportunities are higher. Blockchains are data rich. They will produce pristine, tamper proof data that is incredibly valuable will be over time.
00:54:59.384 - 00:55:34.482, Speaker B: We haven't figured out the product side of the house, the incentives side of the house, the economic and crypto economic side of the house. We need more talent coming into these sectors to really be able to have a shot at competing against web. Two players like mid journey and so many of the other players that allow you to, like, spin up or rent out quickly. A gpu doesn't have to be decentralized, by the way. It doesn't. The more compelling are. Tommy, in your list of things that I definitely agree with is Agi.
00:55:34.482 - 00:55:50.138, Speaker B: Like, AI agents will use stable coins just because they don't have any other option. And that's to your point, Ryan. Maybe that's good enough. I would love to see stablecoin demand go up 100 x. Yeah, I want.
00:55:50.146 - 00:56:32.094, Speaker D: To share the counterpoint to my own thesis. My own thesis is that AI should live transparently. We should all see the parameters, yada yada. The counterpoint to that is exactly what Modulus, Giza and our own Porco inference labs is delivering, which is if you're spending an obscene amount of money training a model for a specific use case, you're paying for specific data, specific training, or some algorithm that's God tier. You have this huge sunk capital cost. Why would you ever give that away for free? You're going to keep that model off chain. You're not going to want to reveal the parameters because you have this edge.
00:56:32.094 - 00:57:06.202, Speaker D: You spent all of this money. Why would you give it away for free? And you're going to let crypto applications and users inference that model without revealing any of the weights or parameters while it lives off chain, because it also is too large to fit on chain anyway, right? And someone like inference labs does that, right? Like, you have the model, you have a hash and an identifier, and you use that model. If the model parameters change, the hash changes, you know, something's changed. You're not going to use it, but it still lives off chain. So that is the counterpoint to my crypto AI thesis a bit, but curious what you guys think about it.
00:57:06.338 - 00:58:16.452, Speaker A: Well, that dovetails with an observation that I make about AI broadly. The sort of generalist mechanic, venture capitalist me is very cautious with respect to AI as a vc category because it may be the first emerging industry where the incumbents accrue the most value. Microsoft didn't win search, Google didn't win social, Facebook didn't win crypto. You can go down the list. Usually the upstarts are the dominant players in a novel industry, but in this case there may just be so much compute and data concentrated in a few centralized forces that this time around that story doesn't play out the same way. And that's why most of my AI play has been magnificent. Seven thus far and not in startups.
00:58:16.508 - 00:58:21.780, Speaker B: Same here, even though I've invested in shared number of portfolio companies. But I think.
00:58:21.892 - 00:58:26.104, Speaker A: Well, and Tommy, you've hit it out of the park with mid journey. Congrats on that.
00:58:26.484 - 00:58:32.124, Speaker D: No thanks. It was through a fund that we invested in, so shout out to them.
00:58:32.284 - 00:59:22.314, Speaker B: But where I am, I'm looking at a company now that I've actually, this is one of the best founders I've talked to recently. We were supposed to have a 40 minutes call. We ended up having like much longer discussion. Back to my original point of where I think crypto is particularly well suited for training and reinforcement learning. I think that's where you could probably create a more superior system relative to web two. And the whole notion is you can train these models with human feedback and you can optimize that. And the rate of improvement is faster.
00:59:22.314 - 01:00:30.104, Speaker B: The question is, can you do it efficiently? And I think crypto so far has been really interesting experiments to create systems that really improve coordination and incentives. And so I think that's an area where probably is where you have a better shot at winning over an incumbent with, again, reinforcement learning with human feedback. And it's no different than perhaps you think about play to earn, for example, which most people discredit now these days. The question is, is it sustainable? You're doling out these incentives via token reward mechanism. Is it sustainable? And that's an issue that gaming, at least the initial games, if you want to call it that, have struggled with. At some point the game economy collapses. And in this case it's actually, I think it collapses because the network effects are not properly understood.
01:00:30.104 - 01:01:40.780, Speaker B: The network effects, I think of machine learning like this are, you know, the idea is, Ryan, if us three are contributing to a particular model and we're being incentivized to do so, I have an incentive to provide feedback. The machine becomes better. Tommy, your turn comes. You also have an incentive to, you know, give feedback, and then when it's your turn, Ryan, the model is just so much better. And once you get that flywheel going, you could argue that you don't necessarily need that much financial incentives to keep that loop of feedback going around because it has very powerful, stronger network effects than your axie infinity. And I think a web two company is going to struggle to incentivize a vastly distributed and harder to coordinate distributed and decentralized group of people and for training. To your point, wisdom of the crowds fails.
01:01:40.780 - 01:02:03.344, Speaker B: Why? There's two parameters that you need for wisdom of the crowds to be true. Otherwise, it's a bunch of idiots have produced terrible results, and that is sufficiently large n so the pool is large and diversity. And I think with crypto, you can do that very efficiently, better than perhaps a web two company can.
01:02:05.124 - 01:02:42.392, Speaker D: The one pushback I don't totally understand is that AI is a centralizing force, right? You have all the best hardware, all the best data, you train the best model. But the counterpoint is, if Ryan were to create a fine tuned LLM, he takes an open source model like llama, trains it on all of his DM's, it becomes Ryan. Right? That model will always be Ryan. Better than that. GBT will be Ryan, because Ryan's model is fine tuned. It's specific, it's. It's perfect, right? And we'll have.
01:02:42.392 - 01:02:57.768, Speaker D: We'll have it on the pod someday, right? But the large models have to generalize about the entire world. So, sure, the model gets smarter as you get more info, but it's getting info from everyone and has to cater to the largest target audience, which is everything all the time, you know?
01:02:57.776 - 01:03:07.384, Speaker B: Who creates a better model of Ryan than Ryan? Who has more data than Ryan than anyone else? Oh, Google or Facebook.
01:03:09.244 - 01:03:09.844, Speaker A: Not Facebook.
01:03:09.884 - 01:03:13.596, Speaker B: Yeah, you're Ryan. I'm talking. You know what I mean?
01:03:13.700 - 01:03:18.412, Speaker D: But that's it. Ryan, we're creating you. We don't want to tell you that lens.
01:03:18.468 - 01:03:37.190, Speaker A: The second order implication of that is that Google captures a lot of the value of these individual models because they already contain the data trove on you. And then they also have the compute war chest to go and do the work.
01:03:37.342 - 01:03:44.486, Speaker D: And it's like, Ryan, I tweeted this out a couple weeks ago, and I think it's a contrarian view, I think. Google beats OpenAI.
01:03:44.670 - 01:03:57.470, Speaker B: Facebook. I was loading up on Facebook because most people are like crushing it because of the metaverse surfers. I'm like, these guys are going to spin up some of the best models out there because they have the most data.
01:03:57.542 - 01:03:59.900, Speaker D: I think they have the most h 100s. Facebook.
01:04:00.012 - 01:04:24.940, Speaker B: Ryan, I definitely am in your camp. Like, look at who has the most h 100s. It is the top, the biggest tech companies, right? And then furthermore, who has the best data? They're not sharing it with anyone. Amazon, Facebook, Google, Twitter. Like pharma. Yeah, good luck trying to be spinning up a specialized lm for insurance. Pharma.
01:04:24.940 - 01:04:48.668, Speaker B: You don't have any of the fucking data. How are you gonna build a model? It's all in the data. Yeah, this is where the AI is going to come crashing, by the way. There's so many venture companies that are going up this. I've looked at a sector that I like, but I have been really cautious to invest against my own will. Is biotech. Everything looks like a Christmas tree.
01:04:48.668 - 01:05:23.614, Speaker B: Everything looks shiny. It's going to cure cancer and it just doesn't because the startups don't have good data. And the big, the big pharma, big pharma has data on all these clinical trials that you've never even heard of. They're going to then go back to that shelf and train it and run through and do protein unfolding, yada, yada, yada and come up with the next vaccine mRNA, or come up with the next cancer treatment or whatever. It's gonna probably be big far. Yeah.
01:05:23.654 - 01:05:31.274, Speaker A: Whenever anybody says, oh, aren't there a lot of scams in crypto? You just say, oh, you've clearly never spent time in bio.
01:05:33.454 - 01:05:38.758, Speaker B: Ryan, what's the difference between a scam and a. Not a scam in the venture?
01:05:38.846 - 01:05:49.070, Speaker A: Yeah, what's the difference between a scam and a preclinical trial company in biotech? Nothing.
01:05:49.262 - 01:05:54.314, Speaker B: Wait, but you have Henry kissing us. That's supposed to be legit.
01:05:56.054 - 01:05:56.878, Speaker D: Oh.
01:05:57.046 - 01:06:01.342, Speaker A: Anyways, let's switch gears. I think we got blast.
01:06:01.478 - 01:06:02.110, Speaker D: Wait, wait, wait.
01:06:02.142 - 01:06:14.026, Speaker B: Before we do that, parting thoughts. AI, how bullish are you on a scale one to ten, Tommy Ryan. And then I'll give my answer. And when I say bullish, I back it up with dollars like percentage of your book.
01:06:14.190 - 01:06:55.204, Speaker D: Yeah, so I'm very bullish. I think crypto AI is the next narrative for sure. And I think it's a long term narrative, and we're very active here. We're going super deep with founders. We're putting our money where our mouth is and we have been for a year or our first investment in AI was author state machine and then recently it was test machine over 15 months ago. And to date we've done ionet inference labs, we've done upshot, tofu, Geppetto, mythos Ventures, angel and my peach. So if you're building on the intersection of crypto and AI, would love to talk to you.
01:06:55.744 - 01:07:53.494, Speaker A: Cool. I would say the allegory or maybe the lesson from the advent of chat. GPT it's interesting how the world was like oh my God, this is going to change everything. Like overnight, like jobs are going to be wiped out en masse and then now a year and a half into it, so to speak, it kind of changed a lot less than I think most of us predicted. But then at the same time, over a long period of time it will do all of those things. And it's something that I'm to Tommys point im taking long view on. So weve made some investments, some that Tommy said, the first one being asm obviously, and origin and a few others actually going back to numerai in 2015.
01:07:53.494 - 01:08:21.354, Speaker A: But its something that I am also more cautious and sort of like less high conviction in early stage than I have been in the past because of this really significant challenge that I see with compute and data that is owned by the magnificent seven. And so I would say we're relatively tepid right now.
01:08:22.174 - 01:09:07.253, Speaker B: Yeah, I am probably somewhere in the middle, I think, on my non crypto portfolio. I've meaningfully allocated to names. Like none of this financial advice, but the usual suspects. I think Facebook was a clear winner that a lot of people were overlooking. I'm looking at who has real data because I just think that's the biggest moat on the crypto side. I think I'm increasingly cautious to have taken my time to form a thesis largely leaning on people that are way smarter. Go listen to the podcast with Casey and Daniel.
01:09:07.253 - 01:09:57.974, Speaker B: And so to really just understand like okay, what are these use cases, what is actually doable? Who's actually going to be willing to pay for this stuff? And see, I made like ten or 15 investments, one of which is a fund Tommy and I share with because I just think much like venture, I'm not an expert on AI, but I think there are people that have a very deep network within the AI community and a lot of people that, for instance, I want to be investing in. The manager that left OpenAI knows all the developers that are going to leave at some point and build their own companies. It's not going to be me who captures that alpha. It's going to be someone that is very deep in that community, and I'm happy to pay manager 220 for that. Cool.
01:09:58.994 - 01:10:00.374, Speaker A: That's a great strategy.
01:10:02.474 - 01:10:19.288, Speaker D: Yeah. One last note. The thing that I like about the fun that Santiago mentioned, it's mythos. Bc it's run by Vishal. They have some of the best thinking on moats and AI. The rule of thumb is, or their rule of thumb is proprietary data. Ryan, you mentioned this earlier.
01:10:19.288 - 01:10:35.352, Speaker D: Proprietary algorithms. So new foundational models, things like that were proprietary business integrations. The AI agent that's integrated with Microsoft Excel clearly has a moat versus the one that you have to download as a plugin. I really like his thinking and always like to share that.
01:10:35.448 - 01:11:14.584, Speaker B: I would argue most VC's that are pouring billions of dollars into startups that are trying to get on the waiting list for H Nasdaq probably outperforms those VC's nine out of ten times, right? Because all the efficiency gains that traditional businesses are going to get through AI over a 510 year period, if you just play that out, low cost, low fee, ride the Nasdaq for the next ten years, I think that's probably as simple as it sounds, but I think that is probably better bet than, uh, most VC investments right now that are just purely, like, funding Nvidia's, lining Nvidia's coffers.
01:11:14.924 - 01:11:18.676, Speaker D: Tiago, I need this at a deep level. I need it.
01:11:18.700 - 01:11:23.324, Speaker B: See how, like, both of you guys are, you know, it's okay.
01:11:23.484 - 01:11:24.444, Speaker D: No, we love you.
01:11:24.524 - 01:11:27.524, Speaker B: No, no, we just. Not questioning that.
01:11:27.564 - 01:11:29.184, Speaker D: We're not cyberbullying you.
01:11:29.964 - 01:12:19.064, Speaker B: It's been a while since someone said, actually, I got a lot of. Of I love blast. Yeah. Very controversial, eh. You know, I think it started with, admittedly, a launch that didn't go properly as planned, and I think the team owned up to it. And I'm specifically saying it would have been far better to communicate the risk, to communicate how it was architected, to communicate what it was and what it wasn't at the time. Meaning you were depositing in a contract, just a multisig that is gonna take an ETH and deposit it to Lido or maker and capture yield until the protocol was built.
01:12:19.064 - 01:12:39.914, Speaker B: I don't think there were forthcoming with that. I don't think. I don't think they were explicit about that. And I think the community really crucified them for it. And that's crypto. You make a wrong turn, you're going to get called out on it. And I think we've gotten better, candidly, as a community, to really call out bullshit.
01:12:39.914 - 01:13:11.772, Speaker B: And yeah, I think they acknowledge that where I think a lot of people have been a bit blindsided, if you will, or just myopic is not revisiting the thesis. I happen to be. Of course, I'm an early investor. I've known the team way before they even started their first project. What most people know them for, which is blur, which is the NFT marketplace that, you know, is dominant in Ethereum. Are we, are we talking about that.
01:13:11.788 - 01:13:13.140, Speaker A: In past tense, by the way?
01:13:13.172 - 01:13:55.582, Speaker B: Is dominant is to this day, like, yeah, just one market share. There's just a great, our network newsletter coming out this week that talked about marketplaces and the evolution of how tensor beat out magic, Eden and Solana, and then Blur beat out like, opensea. Just incredible. And it serves with great product. And so I think, to me, that was my thesis. Simplistically, I think these guys know how to build a great product. And I wasn't involved in the launch mechanics or whatever, but I do think a lot of portfolio companies reached out saying, hey, we want to be connected to the team.
01:13:55.582 - 01:14:08.994, Speaker B: How can we participate? We want to deploy in the ecosystem. Of course, they're looking at over a billion dollars of staked ETH now. It's up to closer to two anyways.
01:14:09.454 - 01:14:11.110, Speaker A: Yeah, it's between one, two.
01:14:11.142 - 01:14:22.854, Speaker B: It's between one and two. Yeah. Who would have thought with all that liquidity, there'd be interest from developers? Yeah. So I've never faded. Founders that know how to build great product.
01:14:26.794 - 01:14:42.754, Speaker A: How is that split now for them? Like, did they go and split the team? And it's like, okay, now half are building blast and the other half are doing blur still. And like, that kind of feels disjointed in a bit. Like, how does that fit together for you?
01:14:43.094 - 01:15:03.670, Speaker B: Great question. It's something, that was something I asked that the Elton said. They hired additional resources. That's why they raised money. Titian, of course, known as Pac Man, I guess, is split. I think he, I would encourage people to go read his tweet when this came out publicly. And it's something I talked to him about.
01:15:03.670 - 01:15:43.200, Speaker B: It's like, hey, how do you think people are going to perceive this? Like, you're. There's a very clear rationale why they're building this l two is because as the amount of traction that they got demanded that they build an l two. And I think makes a lot of sense when you get that amount of traction, it's like DydX. At some point you're faced with the issue of can I build an l two or can I own my destiny in a greater capacity? Dydx went the app chain work route. And I understand that you have more agency, you have more control over certain parameters. Your validator set your incentives. You're not competing for a single threaded like block space.
01:15:43.200 - 01:16:21.494, Speaker B: Fine. In the case of blur, I think they got an incredible amount of traction and they saw an opportunity to build their own l two with a more customized parameters to just make it a more unified, candidly improve the, improve the product, their core offering, which today is blur. So that was a rationale. I believe it. Of course, the resources from the top are split, but I think there's a very clear direction in where they're going. It would be no different than the DydX team going out and building their own app chain.
01:16:23.494 - 01:16:24.622, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, thank you.
01:16:24.638 - 01:16:31.790, Speaker D: So what's the, what's the naive, like, understanding for why blast is different as an l two outside of the one.
01:16:31.822 - 01:17:01.634, Speaker B: Liner, which Dechun always goes back to one liner like for blur was, we're building a marketplace for traders. NFT marketplace for traders. That's it. Open seat, neglecting them. In the case of blast, it's a yield, like a native yield bearing protocol. And when you think about blast, a lot of it is in these marketplaces is if you have the deepest liquidity, you're going to have the best execution. In order to attract liquidity, there is a trade off.
01:17:01.634 - 01:17:49.434, Speaker B: If that ETH deposited, waiting to hit a particular threshold, to sweep a floor of a particular NFT collection, it needs to be earning some. There's an opportunity cost, increasingly so to your point around, these other opportunities are staking and then restaking your ETH. And so if you don't have that natively built at the protocol level, it becomes difficult, increasingly so, to attract traders. And that is, if you want to call that a one liner, a really long one liner. But that would be it is to compress the opportunity cost of depositing east, to build deep pools of liquidity to improve the marketplace experience at the protocol level.
01:17:50.414 - 01:17:54.486, Speaker A: And that's, that's really interesting. That cuts to the capital efficiency, right.
01:17:54.630 - 01:17:59.590, Speaker B: Brian, you understand this better. If you improve that, then you're in the game for sure.
01:17:59.702 - 01:19:12.624, Speaker A: I mean, and the like absolute central thesis that we talk about around the office this year is that any l one or l two that isn't propagating their own capital efficiency through a vibrant defi community is not going to have a general community. There's no path to retail use or to just having a real ecosystem if you're not directly incentivizing a defi community to be the backbone of that ecosystem. And I confess I like blast way better than blur. I think. I think Blur will like a number of things in, you know, that we see in the space. We'll have it stay in the sun and then let's see if NFT become the domain of traders or not. But one could argue that volume is down so much and that its really just high value nfts that are actually dominating the landscape at this point.
01:19:12.624 - 01:19:42.122, Speaker A: So its becoming more digital art and that could be the constituent to really lean into that is not being adequately attended. But blast is really cool because hes taking a direct approach to how can we build capital efficiency in at the protocol layer. And I think, you know, if I was talking with Pac man right now, I would say it's fine for you to split your time, but split at 80 20, don't split a 50 50.
01:19:42.298 - 01:20:04.684, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean a blur, it's kind of a ship. It's sailing and efficient. You know, the amount of work that's required at blur, the blast level is much higher. Right. You're going to think about spinning up an entire ecosystem, attract developers, coordinate. All of that takes time and effort. And so I'll report back on this, guys, I'm a judge at the first hackathon.
01:20:04.684 - 01:20:44.694, Speaker B: We're getting a ton of inbound of projects that are looking to deploy both new teams but also existing teams that are in other ecosystems and are trying to see if there's an opportunity. And so I think it's going to be rather interesting. I think there are ways to bootstrap ecosystems. Arbitrum is probably the most in my mind, and I'm biased, of course. Course has been probably the most successful l two to capture a very organic for the long term kind of ecosystem of builders and projects. Probably the most legitimate out there without paying for crazy and giving crazy grants. I said organic.
01:20:45.194 - 01:21:41.944, Speaker A: But see, that this is the thing is this game is just beginning in the l one and l two, direct incentivization, whether its grants or subsidizing DeFi ecosystems or deploying that capital. The big story, I think of 2024 and maybe over the next two years, but certainly this year is how these very well capitalized ecosystems and foundations deploy that capital to get what theyre after, which is users eyeballs, capital, TVL activity, so on and so forth. And we're in any one of that for sure. But anyways, that's sort of a defining thesis for me, 2024. What is a defining one or two thesis points for you guys in the year ahead?
01:21:44.064 - 01:22:42.848, Speaker B: Well, I mean, it's no surprise. I've tweeted about this a lot at length. So not the poor listeners or you guys, but I'm quite excited. I feel that I'm earlier in crypto today than I was twelve years ago, because finally we're entering that stage of you've been in twelve years of infrastructure build out that has rendered a lot of business models impossible to scale historically. And it's very exciting to revisit that and encouraged by the amount of activity that you're seeing in higher performance, lower, lower latency and higher throughput chains, particularly Solana in this case. It is encouraging from my standpoint, not because I'm ideologically a maximalist, I don't fucking care. Give me a chain that is meets the thresholds of security, decentralization and performance, all because I want to see these chains.
01:22:42.848 - 01:23:21.546, Speaker B: We all want it. Like, I want to see the day where crypto is translating its core properties in a benefit to the consumer. And I think we're finally going to be there. I think the quality of builders at the app layer is improving dramatically. Anyone that is not using protocols like on chain is pontificating, stuck in old narratives, that UI UX is an issue and all this crap. I think chain abstraction is going to be real. Something that is probably not paid much attention to is the cosmos ecosystem.
01:23:21.546 - 01:24:08.840, Speaker B: You have IBC solving the connectivity layer across chains. Cosmos builders have had to, and I've heard this from Sam, from skip. Cosmos builders from day one have had to deal with chain abstraction, and I think that positions them very well, to scale out of cosmos and then implement IBC across the universe of blockchains and secure these without compromising on security. You want to connect all these different chains. And so I think that's incredibly exciting. Succinctly, I think we're entering. Historically, it's paid off to invest in infrastructure over anything else in crypto.
01:24:08.840 - 01:24:52.580, Speaker B: Vast majority of dollars have gone there. I may be calling it too early. I'm certainly not implementing this, but I do think that there will come a time where more dollars are going to flow and returns are going to be far superior at the app layer. Maybe not, maybe far superior, but I think on a proportional basis, on the proportional basis, I think it has to, right? Otherwise, if it doesn't, I agree that the fat protocol thesis is sort of. I ascribe to that notion. I think if the token serves its purpose, like, you're locking it, you're consuming it. Like, value should flow down, but on a relative basis of what historically has been returned.
01:24:52.580 - 01:25:28.954, Speaker B: If you're an infrastructure investor to an asset app layer investor, I think the proportion of dollars should meaningfully increase at the app layer. It should, and that will be a hallmark for entering the application phase of this industry, which would dictate more mainstream adoption. So I'm actually quite excited, like, encouraging to see activity. One of the areas we're seeing it in NFT trading is kind of like, will be a thing. It's. It's such a killer product. Stable coin demand is going to be a killer product.
01:25:28.954 - 01:25:38.834, Speaker B: Anything financialization driven is going to be a killer product. But also gaming, real gaming. So that's it for me.
01:25:39.974 - 01:25:41.994, Speaker A: Great. Tommy?
01:25:42.294 - 01:25:54.440, Speaker D: Yeah. I have one question. What do you think about the mix of apps and then app chains, like. Cause there's a world where the apps and the infra are one and the same investment when the app has its own chain.
01:25:54.472 - 01:25:55.484, Speaker B: Like Dydx.
01:25:57.024 - 01:26:02.248, Speaker D: Yeah, exactly. So it's sort of like you get the best of both worlds in that way. Yeah.
01:26:02.296 - 01:26:25.860, Speaker B: I mean, topic for another discussion. How many more successful breakthrough applications are gonna go the route of building their own l two? Blur blast. Dydx went their own way. Maker tinkering with this. Maybe this is a theme that we're going to see. We saw it in 2017. Right.
01:26:25.860 - 01:26:51.134, Speaker B: A lot of really smart developers realized that they would make more money if they built their own competing l one. The incentives are just stacked. Maybe that's what we're going to see. More and more of breakthrough applications deciding to build their own either l two or app chain. I mean, Cosmos is due for a resurgence. I think Celestia was a dimension injective. Like, I wouldn't fade cosmos.
01:26:51.134 - 01:26:53.334, Speaker B: I would certainly wouldn't fade IBC.
01:26:58.154 - 01:27:04.714, Speaker D: So what should we chat on next time, guys? What should we leave listeners with? Ryan, you're usually pretty good at this.
01:27:04.794 - 01:27:05.362, Speaker B: Let's hear.
01:27:05.418 - 01:27:06.494, Speaker D: Let's hear your.
01:27:06.844 - 01:27:17.904, Speaker A: You know, I'd like to hear one of your core thesis of 2024, if you can. If you can squeeze it out before you. Before you pass out and paint.
01:27:18.604 - 01:27:23.904, Speaker D: I got a couple of minutes left in me. The struggles real.
01:27:24.724 - 01:27:26.944, Speaker A: Just keeping you propped up over there.
01:27:27.364 - 01:28:04.836, Speaker D: Yeah, it's the Red Bull in the chair, basically. Crypto AI for sure. Already covered that, so don't want to go into that in too much depth. Pretty excited for the app chain thesis to actually play out, make it really easy to create app chains, I think is new design space, like with initiative and others. I think I want to see the Solana thesis play out for that area under for low cost transactions, what apps are built there. Pretty excited about the gaming side as well. So a pretty big hodgepodge.
01:28:04.836 - 01:28:31.004, Speaker D: But I'd say generally crypto AI is one of the themes I'm most interested in, the user sovereignty side. So running a light node on your phone with Celestia, using Thor chain, using chain flip, like building out the on chain future with gnosis is my second theme that I really like. And then I think seeing how the app chain thesis versus e fragmented value flow plays out is something I want to figure out soon.
01:28:31.504 - 01:29:05.964, Speaker B: All right, I got an idea for next pod. Most overhyped narratives. And this was inspired because I did a poll on Twitter and end of 2022, it said which which outperforms, and it was like bitcoin, Ethereum, Nasdaq, or like other. I didn't even list Solana in there. Funny enough, like 70% selected Ethereum, and it was like the one that underperformed the most. I ran it again yesterday. I've gained more Solana followers.
01:29:05.964 - 01:29:21.794, Speaker B: So now Solana was at what Ethereum was at the end of 2022. I don't want to jinx it, but I think it's a good setup to think about non consensus areas, just things that are, like, overly crowded and getting ahead of skis or something.
01:29:22.894 - 01:29:25.118, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah. Let's dive in.
01:29:25.206 - 01:29:29.862, Speaker D: I think Ryan's gonna have some. Ryan's gonna have some fun stuff for us too, I think. Next episode, but.
01:29:29.918 - 01:29:30.830, Speaker A: Oh, let's see.
01:29:30.902 - 01:29:32.566, Speaker D: He hasn't told me coming soon.
01:29:32.670 - 01:29:43.358, Speaker B: He's been teasing. All right, well, hopefully. Hopefully. Well, that. That then puts a hammer on, like, close it soon because hopefully it doesn't take four months as we took the coordinate.
01:29:43.486 - 01:29:44.926, Speaker D: You have until next podcast.
01:29:44.990 - 01:29:47.438, Speaker B: You have until next podcast, which is in two weeks.
01:29:47.566 - 01:29:47.990, Speaker D: Three weeks.
01:29:48.022 - 01:29:51.834, Speaker A: My closing ability, definitely better than our ability to get next.
01:29:53.134 - 01:29:56.318, Speaker B: Can't think of a better way to end this pod then. All right, we'll get.
01:29:56.406 - 01:29:58.510, Speaker D: All right, see you guys next year.
01:29:58.582 - 01:30:00.174, Speaker A: Thanks, guys. Cheers.
