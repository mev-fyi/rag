00:00:00.240 - 00:00:09.790, Speaker A: This episode is brought to you by Core, the brand new non custodial wallet that offers a seamless and secure experience on Avalanche. You'll hear more about core later in the show.
00:00:09.942 - 00:00:15.214, Speaker B: This might be the most important like news that coming out of in a long time. Defi and no one talk about it.
00:00:15.254 - 00:00:16.982, Speaker A: Because in crypto, I think all of.
00:00:16.998 - 00:00:48.724, Speaker B: Crypto actually all crypto because in bear markets these things go unnoticed, right? But if you're paying attention, you look at this and you're like, and we talked about it with Eric yesterday. What needed to happen for Defi, in whatever shape form it's going to be to become the operating standard. This introducing real world assets is messy, is complicated, it's tricky. But the fact that this is happening is very moment. It could set us up for the next bull run. If and whenever that happens and Defi leading the charge.
00:00:52.614 - 00:01:24.874, Speaker A: We are live back with another episode of Empire. We got the weekly roundup coming at you. Mano Imano with Santi, your favorite hope you guys all had a good weekend last weekend. Hope you guys had a good fourth. I know we were all happy to see that the Arthur Hayes doomsday predictions for the July 4 weekend did not happen. Even the smartest people in crypto have no idea what's going to happen. We've actually seen a few green candle days since last week with BTC and ethanol currently sitting at BTC over 20k, ETH over 1100 and Macro.
00:01:24.874 - 00:02:06.800, Speaker A: The Fed's June minutes came out on Wednesday. Nothing too surprising to me. I don't know what you think Santi, but the TLDR is really, the Fed is going to keep hiking until a either we go into like a deep, deep, deep recession or be the November election, which you know, I think is going to be a turning point for the Fed. Gold extended sell off to a nine month low on Wednesday while the dollar hit a two decade high. There are just some weird things going on in the markets right now. You've got like the yield curve inversion from the front end to the ten year rates are skyrocketing back up. Commodities are showing weaknesses, but like the major stock indices are up on the day and yesterday, it's just funky.
00:02:06.800 - 00:02:34.974, Speaker A: Things like stocks seem very disconnected from the bond and the credit and the commodity markets right now. Just weird. Markets in general still not looking great. Obviously we're rooting for a turnaround, but not looking great. In better news, SBF came in, said that the worst of the liquidity crunch appears to be over and that FTX has a few billion still to support the industry if things still keep falling. So anyways, Santi, per usual, I'll ask you the same question. How are we feeling today?
00:02:35.314 - 00:02:59.444, Speaker B: I'm feeling great, actually. This morning I felt more bullish than bearish. And maybe it was coming off of a great episode that we recorded yesterday with Eric Peters. Shout out to Eric. He's such a great thinker and he was talking a lot about survival. And yeah, it just got me reflecting. I feel, I mean, I felt calm throughout this entire period.
00:02:59.444 - 00:03:32.808, Speaker B: Disappointed in a lot of things, perhaps things that I should have been more aware of, but I'm feeling great. I think we're beginning to chop. We're beginning to understand how things might unfold. It has felt like a lot of the chaos. It just felt like week after week there was just chaos after chaos. And I mean, I'm not prepared to say that we've seen the full extent of like the cascading effect of three arrows and how that kind of pierces through a lot of, a lot of crypto. But it's felt to me like that has been.
00:03:32.808 - 00:04:14.624, Speaker B: I don't know. I agree with SPF that I think we've seen probably the worst of times. I do sense a shift in the narrative in macro, away from inflation and more towards like, lack of growth. And I think that might be percolating now. And I wouldn't be surprised if we start seeing more of recessionary kind of narrative alongside growth, which I think is encouraging for crypto over medium to long term, because we know that there's a lot of growth in this industry. There's a lot of innovation and capital, at least in the private side looking to be deployed. And I felt, as always, and I've been saying it for a while, that crypto is a very high growth area.
00:04:14.624 - 00:04:35.180, Speaker B: And just a testament of that, and I'll stop talking, is. I like watching Bloomberg one. It's kind of therapeutic to have it in the background. I've just, like, I grew up at JPMorgan in a trading floor environment. Like, these tvs were always on. So it's like, feels like I'm in like, you know, my mother's womb or something. Hopefully my mother's not listening to that.
00:04:35.180 - 00:04:36.332, Speaker B: I've replaced Bloomberg.
00:04:36.428 - 00:04:40.916, Speaker A: You should just say your mother's womb is like a Bloomberg. I mean, like, like CNBC playing in the back.
00:04:40.980 - 00:04:41.476, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
00:04:41.500 - 00:04:42.028, Speaker A: Like babies.
00:04:42.076 - 00:04:44.468, Speaker B: Like, like find out therapy. I find out if I, if I.
00:04:44.476 - 00:04:47.524, Speaker A: Was a nice guy, I would edit that out. But we're not getting that one.
00:04:47.604 - 00:05:08.504, Speaker B: We don't ever edit anything out of these episodes, FYI. Nonetheless, mom, I love you. I. I feel that, like, I read the paper, too. Every day there's a huge column, a full, dedicated, like, financial times today, like, every day there's a full column on crypto. And some takes are pretty accurate. Other takes are very extreme.
00:05:08.504 - 00:05:35.734, Speaker B: But to me, I mean, that's, that alone just tells you that. I mean, there's something there. And I feel like a lot of people are just continuously being exposed to this and the narrative keeps evolving. So I think that whether you, we have our views around how the media portrays crypto, like Jim Crames of the world just make a mockery of this space. But it's a NASA class and it's growing and it's attracting a lot of eyeballs. And that's positive, I think.
00:05:36.874 - 00:05:57.702, Speaker A: All right, so you've got SPF talking about how this could be the bottom. You're feeling pretty optimistic. Financial Times is making a mockery of crypto right now, or at least they're trying to. Maybe they're making a mockery of themselves. Actually, Jim Cramer is coming out. His stance obviously completely flipped. It feels like if I'm reading between the lines, maybe two or three weeks ago, you were kind of just sitting back, taking all of this in.
00:05:57.702 - 00:06:07.766, Speaker A: You weren't buying, you were kind of just taking all this in. Now it feels like I would assume you're still not buying, but maybe finger is moving a little closer to the trigger. Am I right there?
00:06:07.950 - 00:06:52.122, Speaker B: I think so, yeah. To be fair, I haven't done anything different, but I feel that we're perhaps closer to entering that period of three to six to nine months where we're going to be chopping, but it's not going to be as violent, as volatile. And I think these are the periods where I start thinking of accumulating slowly and then ramping that up. Interesting feature. And this is not an endorsement to FTX, but they just rolled out. I think a TWap feature, if you're using, which I think has always been like t whopping into these positions, cost averaging your way in, however you want to do it, is always like, for me, it's been a sensible strategy where I'm not looking at time markets, I'm just looking to accumulate a certain allocation of my portfolio over some period of time.
00:06:52.218 - 00:07:13.738, Speaker A: Yeah. All right, today's episode, we are talking about the latest updates on contagion running through CFI. It might get a little repetitive, it might feel like that, but I personally feel like it's really important to just review what's happening with Voyager. Blockfi, Celsius, three arrows, Alameda, et cetera. SPF coming in. FTX. So we're going to give a couple of quick updates.
00:07:13.738 - 00:07:44.114, Speaker A: There an update on the BTC, minor crises and contagion that is flowing through miners right now. We've been talking about it. It's starting to finally hit. Makerdao has some really interesting things that we're going to talk about bringing real world assets. If you ever see RWA, that's real world assets, into DeFi, then if we have time, I might ask Santi a series of some insider questions that I want to get his take on. If we don't have time for that, we will put them on the spot next week. Santi, ready to dive in?
00:07:44.194 - 00:07:45.122, Speaker B: Let's do it.
00:07:45.298 - 00:08:10.650, Speaker A: Amazing. All right. Voyager update. Alameda's $500 million line of credit could not save Voyager crypto brokerage Voyager, who just filed for chapter eleven bankruptcy on Tuesday. Our team went through some of the filings. Here are the things we found. Voyager has an estimated 100,000 creditors and somewhere between a billion and 10 billion in assets with a similar range of liabilities.
00:08:10.650 - 00:08:36.584, Speaker A: Their plan is to restructure and maximize value for stakeholders. The question is, at what cent on the dollar rate will the depositors and the creditors get paid back? Some estimates are coming in around $0.70 on the dollar. I've seen $0.80 on the dollar. This is really where you wish you had FDIC insurance. But Voyagers bank is saying that there's no FDIC insurance and that there's no insurance on some of those assets.
00:08:36.584 - 00:09:36.846, Speaker A: If I understood that correctly, Alameda, who is, interestingly, the second largest borrower from Voyager at 376 million, has a $75 million line of unsecured loans to Voyager. They also own 9% of Voyager's equity. They will likely take about a 20 30% haircut on the $75 million loan as it is pari passu with customer deposits, and that equity is going to zero. I think it's also important, just in this last note here, and then I'll get your take on it, is it's tough to talk about Voyager without mentioning the primary catalyst of the bankruptcy, which is three arrows. Right? Can three arrows continues to be a major problem for Voyager? Three arrows represents about 60% of Voyager's total loan book, over 650 million in loans. They also made, I think they made the $650 million loan Voyager did on an uncollateralized basis, not under collateralized, fully uncollateralized zero collateral, if I understand that correctly. That is just right.
00:09:36.846 - 00:09:52.886, Speaker A: So what 3 hours would do is they were part borrowing from of Voyager at 12% against zero collateral. It depositing those funds in anchor at 19% free money until it all blew up. So anyways, TLdR Voyager filed for bankruptcy, chapter eleven bankruptcy this week. Any thoughts there, Santi?
00:09:52.990 - 00:10:33.828, Speaker B: That was a great summary. The only thing that is going to be interesting is this idea of FDFC insurance. As sweet and as great as Defi can be, know attracting a lot of people on this higher interest rate. Historically, we've been in a low record, low interest rate environment. So this precedent is pretty interesting. It leaves you wondering, can we ever, can we get FDIC insurance if and when your financial institution is tapping into deFi? Like I would be looking at this and asking the hard question, which is, am I FDIC insured? And I think it's important. FDIC insurance is super important.
00:10:33.828 - 00:11:00.796, Speaker B: It only covers. Remind me, Jason, this applies only to us depositors, right? There's other kind of similar versions of this elsewhere, but it's like up to what? 150,000? I think 250,000. 250,000, right. So look, it's something. And so that's something that I found interesting. Had it been regulated like a normal bank, then perhaps you could have argued, but these. These institutions are not, or have, have argued for a long time not to be regulated as banks.
00:11:00.796 - 00:11:04.516, Speaker B: And so naturally they don't get the benefit of FDIC insurance, I think.
00:11:04.660 - 00:11:31.904, Speaker A: Yeah. And the reason we're talking about this, there's a tweet from November 12, 2020. Voyager tweeted out, have you heard? USD with Voyager is FDIC insured up to 250k. So Voyager in their marketing was saying, your money is USDC insured, it looks like. Or FDIC insured. It looks like the FDIC insurance is not protecting Voyager against this bankruptcy. Well, I don't have all the details I haven't fully dug into, by the way.
00:11:32.604 - 00:12:01.242, Speaker B: That might be what comes and bites him in the ass, because that opens them up to a class action lawsuit, right? I mean, that screams to me, misrepresentation. And if you're a depositor in Voyager and had expected that, then you have a pretty good claim pointing towards that. And so, look, I don't want to trigger, like, ambulance chasing lawyers, but I think as a depositor, I sympathize with a lot of people that might thought that they were going to be protected the same way that they get protected in a normal bank.
00:12:01.418 - 00:12:34.618, Speaker A: Right. I'm looking at Voyager's website here, there's a blog post from December of 2019. The blog post is titled USDC held with Voyager is FDIc insured. I just pulled up their disclosures, and it said, and on their disclosures page today, it says, crypto held on the Voyager platform is not protected by FDIC insurance. So these are two polar opposite statements. So this could be what comes back to bite them in the ass, you know, it sucks. Actually, I have a little bit of money on Circle.
00:12:34.618 - 00:12:42.894, Speaker A: Circle's retail app from back in the day. If you remember, Circle had that retail app in 2016, and that's where I bought some crypto. Voyager acquired them.
00:12:45.274 - 00:12:46.098, Speaker B: Voyager.
00:12:46.226 - 00:13:12.428, Speaker A: Now my. Yeah, well, it's still in that circle app because it's a New York. Cause I signed up with a New York license, and technically, then they weren't able to transfer it over to Voyager because of the bitlicense. So basically, only the New York residents have their money still sitting in the Circle app. And I just kind of left it. I was just sitting on it. I was like, oh, whatever, and now I can't pull it out, which sucks, but what are you going to do? Three arrows has been ordered into a liquidation.
00:13:12.428 - 00:13:35.228, Speaker A: We talked about this briefly last week by a British Virgin Islands court, BVI court. They filed for chapter 15 bankruptcy on Saturday. Um, Adam Cochran had some good takes on this that I want to try to summarize. Um, in terms of the bankruptcy, the three arrows liquidation feels pretty comical. Uh, first, they self filed for the liquidation. This is a. This is actually a big deal.
00:13:35.228 - 00:14:06.644, Speaker A: Uh, this was not appointed by a court. They decided to file themselves. This typically means, as Adam says, I'm not a lawyer. It means that they know it's over. Um, it's also an interesting play that usually results in more favorable treatment when you actually self file. Now, getting into the more favorable treatment, what are they actually looking for here? Suzu is listed as a creditor himself in the application. So sue actually put himself is claiming himself as a creditor, meaning in a liquidation, the assets are always distributed back to the creditors.
00:14:06.644 - 00:14:24.222, Speaker A: Right. Sue is claiming himself as a creditor. That is a. And right there. There are reasons why this could happen, right? That maybe sue put up some of his own starting capital for the phone fund. He loaned three arrows some of his own personal money. Maybe he made himself a guarantor on the fund assets.
00:14:24.222 - 00:15:00.660, Speaker A: But it just feels like a shameless and bold move to make himself a creditor on these assets. And I feel like there are a lot of startups that gave capital to three heirs that should get that money before sue should. So. And I think the last piece from the bankruptcy, again taken from Adam, is the whole bankruptcy filing in summary, shows that or suggests that, a, there are still assets, b, those assets include coins and tokens, c, those assets are worth fighting over and D, maybe most importantly, we have not seen the end of this quote, unquote, dicey saga, as Adam says. So any, any thoughts on three arrows here?
00:15:00.772 - 00:15:55.074, Speaker B: No, I mean, again, like, I don't have any information other than what's out there available. The thing that I found interesting is obviously they moved to Dubai and he's been trying to liquidate a house that is in Singapore under his son's name and then other assets pretty quickly. It has felt, obviously there's going to be a lot of forensics and I think crypto, Twitter does a pretty good job at this. There seems like a trading arm and an operation. So I think a lot of what is happening here, my interpretation is they've started this bankruptcy to protect and kind of insulate perhaps where the true value and any sort of money that is left in sort of a trading arm I think, that they had. And so that feels to me like they triggered this bankruptcy to protect themselves and isolate themselves from kind of creditors coming after everything. Right.
00:15:55.074 - 00:16:13.642, Speaker B: And the other, of course, is starry night, which is their NFT fund. I've seen some kind of things being circulated and it sounds like the manager of starry night, Vincent van Doe. Vince. Vincent van Doe. I think Doe was. Yeah, was caught off guard along with.
00:16:13.738 - 00:16:15.498, Speaker A: Who is VVD? Is that, is that Kyle?
00:16:15.546 - 00:16:23.534, Speaker B: No idea. No, no. I actually don't know who this person is. I mean, it's pseudonymous. He's a collector who is managing this fund.
00:16:23.834 - 00:16:26.730, Speaker A: One of the things that $100 million NFT fund, right?
00:16:26.802 - 00:17:04.224, Speaker B: Yeah, correct. And he. I'm looking at that because there might be some fire sales in the NFT land. And so I find that pretty interesting and compelling. I don't know if they're going to, how they're going to liquidate that, but at some point you assume that they will. And what was interesting is that my understanding is that all of those wallets were kind of controlled by like three arrows. So it feels like three arrows had like, I mean, there's a lot of connectivity that three arrows had with, like, these two funds, but their ability to, like, sweep wallets and control wallets was pretty, like, deep and I don't know, like, I think.
00:17:04.224 - 00:17:41.213, Speaker B: I don't think you should be structuring things like that. Like, you know, if someone. Like, even if they have, like, some sort of majority ownership, like, you typically have, like, some sort of, like, compliance and, like, processes in place where in order to move assets, you need to have, like, two or three approvals. And, I don't know, these are the things that, like, proto. Like, you have certain protocols internally as a fund to, like, make sure that there's not, like, key man risk. Like, if, like, Kyle were to go crazy or sue goes crazy. He can't just sweep a wallet, but it sounds like they actually could, which to me just screams, like.
00:17:41.213 - 00:18:07.876, Speaker B: Like, who. Who advised them on the structuring of this stuff, you know? I mean, like, it is alarming, candidly. And it's. You should always never. You should never skip on lawyer fees and accounting fees as much as they are painful. But, like, in this asset class, like, you just need to structure things in a very, like, as perfect way possible because, I don't know. Like, these things are pretty real, and you never think that it's gonna happen to you, and then, you know, it does.
00:18:07.940 - 00:18:08.544, Speaker A: So.
00:18:09.084 - 00:18:34.072, Speaker B: Yeah, like, like, in your. I mean, you don't have to tell us everything, but, like, for your wallets, like, can you move them around just at will, or do you have, like, a controller and, like, maybe your co founder that, like, there's a multisig and people need to sign and, like, approve a transaction over a certain threshold. Like, these are, like, common governance practices, best practices that exist not only in crypto but just in any company. There's.
00:18:34.168 - 00:18:45.918, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, not pretty much all of my crypto is you. You need a multisig to move it. You need there need there need. There are multiple signers. I cannot move. Probably 95% of my crypto. There you go.
00:18:45.918 - 00:18:53.594, Speaker A: Yeah. So were you an investor? An LP in defiance? In Arthur's? No. Nope. No.
00:18:53.714 - 00:18:57.978, Speaker B: I had no exposure to three arrows or terra or any of that, you know, knock on board, but no.
00:18:58.106 - 00:19:19.234, Speaker A: Yeah. Another couple other companies will move. Move on from this. Genesis, the institutional crypto trading desk, prime brokerage, confirmed Wednesday that the large counterparty who failed to pay their margin calls in June was, in fact, three arrows. This was the speculation. It is true. Genesis sold three arrows collateral upon the failed margin calls to hedge their downside.
00:19:19.234 - 00:19:53.894, Speaker A: But this still led to some material losses. Genesis will be fine. They've got the full weight of, like, a, they're probably the most successful lending desk in crypto of all time, or trading desk, and then, b, they're backed by the full weight of DCG. So Genesis will be just fine. Celsius looks like they're actually paying down some loans, and it looks like they could make it out of this, actually, which is just nuts. They let go of, I think, about 150 employees. To reduce the burn, they have now paid off over, I think, $200 million of their debt.
00:19:53.894 - 00:20:08.690, Speaker A: I think when we were, I think, maybe an hour ago or so, as we were recording this, Celsius, or right before we recorded this, they finished paying off their loan to maker and maker. Got. How much was this? 440 million in collateral back.
00:20:08.802 - 00:20:09.730, Speaker B: Yeah, I know.
00:20:09.762 - 00:20:10.694, Speaker A: 41 million.
00:20:11.194 - 00:20:24.558, Speaker B: Well, they owed them. I think the debt outstanding was 41 million, and the collateral posted against that was 220 wrapped bitcoin. So that's worth 440 million. Sorry.
00:20:24.606 - 00:20:43.118, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, exactly. Exactly. Okay. I'm just reading some of these other notes here. Celsius reshuffled their board of directors. They appear to be finding ways to stave off bankruptcy via other restructuring measures. It's interesting, FTX, and so, like, on one hand, you could say that Celsius might actually make it out.
00:20:43.118 - 00:21:12.994, Speaker A: Make it out of this. Um, which then it's like, well, should they make it out of this? And who's going to give them their capital? And on the other hand, it's like, well, FTX and Alameda, who, like, clearly, desperately wanted to give capital to folks to start acquiring people on the cheap for pennies on the dollar. They extended loans to both Blockfi and Voyager, um, who are even worse off now than perceived last week, but they passed on Celsius after looking at their balance sheet. Um, so it seems. Yeah, I'm not sure.
00:21:13.454 - 00:21:18.142, Speaker B: Get on my head. If you have any money in Celsius, take it out, if you can, as soon as possible.
00:21:18.318 - 00:21:39.234, Speaker A: Like, would you say that about the, uh. Would you say that about exchanges? Like, would you be. So I think it's. Hopefully, it's obvious to people, take your money out of these c five lend and borrow platforms. What about the exchanges right now? Maybe, like, the tier two, like, the coinbases and finances of the world will be totally fine, but what about maybe, like, the tier two or tier three?
00:21:39.934 - 00:22:22.154, Speaker B: Well, my view is, like, an idealistic one, and then I'll give you a practical. And the idealistic one is minimize any significant sums of money and put them in, like, a multi sig, like your keys. You control that, and you minimize counterparty risk. But I would say for now, you know, tier ones, as you said, fTx, binance, coinbase, seem the better ones out there. But. And so, you know, I don't want to sound alarms here, but there's been a lot of, I think, fighting out there on some of these tier two exchanges, and it can cause a lot of harm to them. Just like a triggered bank run, maybe without merit, but, yeah, I'd be cautious on that.
00:22:22.154 - 00:22:39.224, Speaker B: You know, I think if. If you have any degree of. Of uncertainty and you have your spidey senses go off, don't risk it, honestly. Just go to a safer place and don't minimize your exposure.
00:22:40.404 - 00:22:52.300, Speaker A: When you say set up a multisig, where are you doing this? Through Coinbase now has the ability to set up a multisig through Coinbase, or are you doing this on gnosis? Thank you. Thank you.
00:22:52.372 - 00:23:10.774, Speaker B: Yeah, it's tricky because gnosis only covers my understanding. I think is only Ethereum and Erc, 20 tokens. Uh, they may have launched in Solana, but actually, like. So, yeah, for now. Like, I mean, yeah, gnosis is. Is pretty battle tested. Um, but, you know, like, depends on the sum.
00:23:10.774 - 00:23:37.372, Speaker B: Some of these providers, like, fire blocks that you're still in control of. Your keys don't take, like, retail money. It's just purely if you're a fund or like, a, you know, a protocol of sorts. But, yeah, like, again, the. The strategy that I like to use is, and I'll use a Harry Potter analogy, is a Horcrux model, which is just segregate, have multiple wallets. Multiple, like, you know, if you're going to use FTX, Coinbase, use all of them candidly and minimize your exposure. Right.
00:23:37.372 - 00:23:45.372, Speaker B: If one wallet gets compromised, one counterparty gets compromised, you don't lose it all. And so I think that strategy is, I think, a sensible one.
00:23:45.548 - 00:23:45.996, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:23:46.060 - 00:23:54.304, Speaker B: Not just in this environment. Just in any environment you want to, like, have multiple, like, layers of redundancy and diversification.
00:23:54.924 - 00:24:16.374, Speaker A: I agree. Can I ask you a. You can skip this question if you don't want to answer it. What percentage of your capital is on centralized platforms? So I'm talking the finance or coinbase or whoever it may be. Like, that. Gemini versus gnosis metamask in crypto wallets.
00:24:16.534 - 00:24:18.454, Speaker B: Of my crypto portfolio.
00:24:18.614 - 00:24:24.334, Speaker A: Of your crypto portfolio, yeah. And then the third bucket would be self custody, like a ledger or treasure.
00:24:25.434 - 00:24:35.602, Speaker B: Like, 1% of my assets are with, like, counter. Like, well, maybe no more than 5% are with, like, centralized institutions that control my keys. I'm comfortable with that.
00:24:35.738 - 00:24:36.530, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:24:36.722 - 00:24:37.454, Speaker B: Cool.
00:24:37.834 - 00:25:02.402, Speaker A: Moving on. Blockfi announced their deal with FTX. While the rumor was a buyout at a measly $25 million valuation, the real deal involved $680 million of total potential capital. Uh, there's a $400 million credit facility, and then the option for FTF to acquire the firm at up to 240 million. I think if they hit, maybe. I think it's honestly, like. I think it's like an earn out, basically.
00:25:02.402 - 00:25:12.394, Speaker A: Like, Zach and Flory have to probably stay on and, uh, hit different milestones. So, uh, much better than the original deal, but still values blockfight. Uh, much less than the.
00:25:12.514 - 00:25:18.774, Speaker B: Is it? Because better than 5 million. It may be 25, though.
00:25:19.594 - 00:25:22.802, Speaker A: This is. Well, no, no, I know, I know, I know. The key, it's a better.
00:25:22.898 - 00:25:25.218, Speaker B: Is up to 240 million.
00:25:25.266 - 00:25:26.994, Speaker A: I know, Miles. Right.
00:25:27.034 - 00:25:34.058, Speaker B: Okay. What if you don't hit any milestones? You still have the option to acquire them. Maybe at 25, maybe at 10 million. Who knows? Like, I don't have details of this.
00:25:34.186 - 00:25:37.026, Speaker A: You're an investor. You should know. Why don't they email you these things?
00:25:37.210 - 00:25:42.922, Speaker B: Well, yes, in process, but nonetheless, I.
00:25:42.938 - 00:25:44.378, Speaker A: Saw you on Twitter. Like, I was like.
00:25:44.426 - 00:25:45.250, Speaker B: I'm like, wait a minute.
00:25:45.322 - 00:25:47.894, Speaker A: You're like, what the hell's the deal? You're like, let me know.
00:25:48.234 - 00:25:54.394, Speaker B: Up to 240 million, which is a massive discount. That was the latest valuation. 3 billion or billion? I forget. Was it three?
00:25:54.434 - 00:25:58.914, Speaker A: I think. I think three. They were gonna raise it five that got yanked. Yeah, yeah.
00:25:58.994 - 00:26:01.174, Speaker B: You're left wondering, like, I think at some point.
00:26:02.994 - 00:26:03.386, Speaker A: It was.
00:26:03.410 - 00:26:08.586, Speaker B: There's a speculation of them going public. Like, what would have happened in, like, blockfi was public company, I guess, like Voyager.
00:26:08.650 - 00:26:13.018, Speaker A: But Voyager is public, just not in the US, but.
00:26:13.146 - 00:26:22.332, Speaker B: Correct. Yeah, but, yeah. Anyways, I would be really curious to see what those earn outs and milestones. Like, those milestones are to get to 240.
00:26:22.508 - 00:26:38.868, Speaker A: I agree. I agree. Does this change how you view private market investing? Because a company like Blockfi. Like, blockfi is one of the golden childs, right? Like, if you got into the seed round or series a, what is it? Pop.
00:26:38.916 - 00:26:40.804, Speaker B: Like, you know, get on the rocket.
00:26:40.844 - 00:26:47.144, Speaker A: Ship, shout out, pop. I love pop. So I don't. I can't. I can't hate on Paul.
00:26:47.564 - 00:26:49.464, Speaker B: I don't hate him, but I just don't love him.
00:26:49.764 - 00:26:51.184, Speaker A: You don't watch the.
00:26:51.844 - 00:26:56.984, Speaker B: It's too much, man. It's like. It's a clown. Like. Like, get off. Like, tone it down. Okay.
00:26:56.984 - 00:27:13.524, Speaker B: This is a problem that I have with crypto. It's like a bunch of, like, charlatans out there and, like, guys, like, let's stop using superlative. Like, stop using extreme. Like, you know, like, sometimes it's excited about. We're excited about this. Technology, but, you know, that kind of stuff just, I don't know, it's cringe.
00:27:13.864 - 00:27:29.776, Speaker A: I got nothing for love for Pop. You know, Pop is a. Pop is the reason I post on Twitter. On Twitter. Mike and I, when we met pomp, we each had like 100 followers and pomps and we did a race to 2000 followers and pomp taught us how to. How to tweet. And actually, I think Mike beat me to 2000 followers.
00:27:29.800 - 00:27:34.480, Speaker B: Wait, he taught you to follow and then unfollow and use bots and buy followers? No, I'm just kidding.
00:27:34.552 - 00:27:55.764, Speaker A: Shouldn't have brought this up. God, I'm going to get an angry text from someone in the next couple of days. So, anyways, moving past that, that, does this change your mindset on early stage private investing? Because even the best private investments, like Blockfi, seemed to be the golden child of the last market that.
00:27:58.304 - 00:28:48.456, Speaker B: Even in a bull market, I think if you're a series C and above for Coinbase, at the peak of its public market valuation, once it ipo'd, you would have still underperformed bitcoin or Ethereum. And so, like, I had the ability to invest in Coinbase after the series C and I didn't. And for a while, like, I was, I was kicking myself for that. And then, and then obviously, you know, as it turns out, you know, it became clear that, you know, you're better off holding a liquid acid that you control. Like, I mean, I think, like, people ask me this a lot. It's like, you know, as fund man, like, a lot of fund managers, I think, out there are trying to, like, get too sophisticated. And I've always told people, look, sometimes, like, it's okay to charge people, like, to manage a position.
00:28:48.456 - 00:29:43.576, Speaker B: And just owning bitcoin Ethereum might be the cleanest bet that you can make in this space. Or take a basket of, like, an index of. Of the top crypto assets, however you want to slice that, cut that thematically or by market cap or whatever. But, yeah, increasingly, like, I've sort of come to that conclusion that sometimes the best bet and the cleanest bet is just honestly, just owning bitcoin Ethereum. Pick your other flavors, you know? But like, I've said this before in the episode with Travis, it's like, you know, I would surmise that, like, if you construct a portfolio today, one, which is, say, just like Eric did it, like, you know, some sort of ratio, 60 40, 50. Bitcoin ETH, that's one. Another one is an index of, like, the top ten by market cap that rebalances constantly.
00:29:43.576 - 00:30:16.128, Speaker B: Like, kind of like an s and P for crypto. And then the other one is like, you invest in a fund. I think the first two portfolios outperform the third one. Yeah, for the most part, unless you're, like, the best font out there. But for the most part, I think you're gonna outperform. And the nice thing is that the first two strategies anyone can access, literally. And so that's like, the last thing I'll say is, like, there's a great interview of a lot of really good hedge fund managers, including, like, or venture guys like Andreessen Horizon, like Mark Andreessen.
00:30:16.128 - 00:30:51.252, Speaker B: You can ask this question, like, hey, if you had like, $10 million, $100 million today, a million dollars today, like, where would you invest it coming from? One of the best investors of all time. Honestly, I would just put an s and P index and let it ride. And, you know, like, we talk a lot about the catalyst for next cycle and what really is going to take crypto mainstream. I think it's hard to predict these things, but a rebalancing index is going to capture that. And from a time management perspective, it will do that for you. And so, like, as simple as it may sound, I think those strategies will outperform most. Like, not like 99% of other strategies out there.
00:30:51.338 - 00:30:53.484, Speaker A: Yep, I agree. I agree.
00:30:54.104 - 00:31:18.924, Speaker B: Especially on the private side. It's tough to say because I like it a lot for a number of reasons. There is sort of this power law dynamic that one, two, three investments on the private side super early can make for a lot of your losses. It's difficult. It's not very scalable strategy either, I would say, and requires a lot of time.
00:31:19.584 - 00:31:21.776, Speaker A: I'm moving on. We got a clock.
00:31:21.920 - 00:31:22.644, Speaker B: Yes.
00:31:23.264 - 00:31:54.724, Speaker A: Bitcoin miners capitulating. If you guys have been listening to the roundup, you would know this was coming. We've been talking about it. Last week, we talked about how many bitcoin miners are, how bitcoin miners are struggling to remain solvent due to high leverage bitcoin prices, falling liabilities from pre ordered mining rigs. On Tuesday, we saw this thesis play out with core scientific. They sold 7202 bitcoin last month at an average price of $23,000. For anyone doing the mental math on that, that is about $167 million.
00:31:54.724 - 00:32:31.164, Speaker A: Why did they do this? They have to cover the cost of their servers, increase data capacity, payoff debts. This represents over 75% of their bitcoin holdings. Man, what a dagger to have to sell 75% of your holdings. Their CEO noted that they will continue to sell mined bitcoin to strengthen their balance sheet and enhance liquidity, but noted that they will take advantage of other distressed opportunities as they arrive. That sounds like a nice piece. Message. Despite the market conditions, core scientific says they still expect to deploy another 70,000 new self mining ASIC servers over the next six months.
00:32:31.164 - 00:32:41.060, Speaker A: And that they've already paid off 90% of the cost for these new additions. All right, it's happening. Minor capitulation. It's coming.
00:32:41.212 - 00:32:52.490, Speaker B: Yeah, that's something. A lot of folks, like, monitor how much of reserves that miners haven't sold are in their balance sheet or their wallets. As, as that, again, talks about the sell pressure.
00:32:52.602 - 00:32:52.826, Speaker A: Right.
00:32:52.850 - 00:33:13.354, Speaker B: And so if you monitor that and as soon as they kind of exhaust that, um, then, then you start bottoming out or at least forming a range or a view that, okay, that selling pressure is gone. Um, I was thinking about this as an aside. Is it must be one of the hardest jobs in crypto, running a fund. Yes. Like being an operator. Even more so. Cause it's.
00:33:13.354 - 00:33:24.846, Speaker B: The community just shouts at you when things go marginally wrong. But a miner is a very tough business. Not only so hard, so hard. You need to constantly replace ASIC. Miners is ASIC.
00:33:24.910 - 00:33:27.014, Speaker A: You have to buy inventory 18 months in advance.
00:33:27.094 - 00:34:22.838, Speaker B: And like, yeah, it depreciates very quickly, it's more competitive, there's geopolitical risk. And not only that, you need to kind of also like have a view on the price of the underlying and like hedge it and, or, and I think a lot of people, a lot of miners get into trouble when they try to be too greedy and like run a Fonda, meaning have a directional view on the asset. Like, of course you're mining it because you think it's profitable. But yeah, it's like managing the capex, the opex, and also taking a directional view on where the asset's going to go. It's really tough in a space that you can't, like, if you're an oil, like, like extract, like if you're an oil and gas company or whatever, like, there are very, like, the market is more sophisticated in terms of instruments to hedge your exposure and all this stuff, they even get into trouble too. So in crypto, obviously, you don't even have these instruments or the markets that, like, not as sophisticated to hedge. This sort of stuff is possible, but it's like difficult, more difficult.
00:34:22.838 - 00:34:25.590, Speaker B: So I sympathize with a lot of miners out there.
00:34:25.742 - 00:34:40.966, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, you have lower bitcoin price right now. Higher hash difficulty, higher energy costs. It's put serious pressure on the miners margins. Right. Hash price is now the lowest it's been since I think, like October of 2020. I need to look back at the data that was from a week or two when I was looking at who had that glass node.
00:34:40.966 - 00:35:09.970, Speaker A: Glass node's really good for this kind of stuff. But we have a really good mining episode coming up that you guys should. If you guys aren't subscribed to Empire already, you should subscribe foundry, which is DCGs mining arm. We've got Galaxy Digital's bitcoin mining team coming on and maybe one other person who we'd be lucky to get as well. So that'll be a really good mining episode. We're recording it next week, so we'll try to do a rush edit, get it out next week as well. I think the things to be looking at in mining right now that we'll be sure to talk about on that next episode.
00:35:09.970 - 00:35:35.644, Speaker A: Distressed debt is definitely coming to mining. Opportunities are going to exist for those with dry powder. I would not be surprised to see FTX make a play in the mining space as well. M and a acquisition of hardware, acquisition of sites. All these things are going to be at a steep discount. I think rigs are going to go on sale at a steep discount as miners start defaulting on their prior. Like you were talking about, Santi, you buy these things 18 months in advance.
00:35:35.644 - 00:35:47.830, Speaker A: I have a feeling you start to see some defaults on some of those contracts for selling of existing and ordered rigs. This is going to give miners with dry powder the ability to expand operations at a much lower cost. Ever.
00:35:47.862 - 00:35:51.774, Speaker B: Let me ask you one simple question. Would you rather own mining stock or bitcoin or like Ethereum?
00:35:51.854 - 00:36:09.438, Speaker A: Bitcoin. Bitcoin. All right, folks, this episode is brought to you by our friends at Avalanche and Ava Labs. They have just dropped a new crypto wallet called Core. You're going to be hearing a lot about it over the coming months. You can now be one of the first to try it out. Here's the reason I'm excited to partner with them on empire right now.
00:36:09.438 - 00:36:36.870, Speaker A: Crypto wallets and browser extensions, they feel clunky. They feel non intuitive. That's why Ava Labs built core. It's a free, non custodial browser extension that gives avalanche users a seamless and secure web three experience across the entire avalanche ecosystem. Here are a few reasons to try core. Here's what I'm experimenting with. Number one, core has intuitive dashboards with a unified display for all of your NFT collections, all your crypto assets.
00:36:36.870 - 00:37:07.392, Speaker A: You can execute asset swaps directly inside the wallet. It's a really nice experience. Maybe you want to earn yield or borrow against your bitcoin, but you don't want to do it on one of those c five platforms right now. Core's native bridging functionality makes it really easy to bridge your bitcoin to Avalanche's robust defi ecosystem. Last but not least, core makes on ramping super easy. You can convert dollars to crypto right now using the moonpay integration. Just takes a few clicks.
00:37:07.392 - 00:37:41.494, Speaker A: Download Core today using the link in the show notes it's really, really nice. If you are interested in the avalanche ecosystem at all, you have to be using core. Download core using the link below. Now let's get back to the show. Anyways, moving on. Makerdao is serious about bringing real world assets into DeFi. Have you been following this with Maker? The maker community has mostly aligned on the need to onboard real world assets and other off chain collateral to help die scale and meet user demand.
00:37:41.494 - 00:37:59.014, Speaker A: Correct me if I'm wrong, but the reliance on off chain assets was almost forced into the protocol in the aftermath of March of 2020 when USDC was onboarded via an emergency vote to help stem a liquidity crisis. I know you were very deep into maker back then.
00:37:59.634 - 00:38:12.308, Speaker B: During that time, I think we didn't. We were running very low on sleep to try to felt like maker was in a very precarious situation and we made the decision. I'll be controversial to onboard USDC.
00:38:12.436 - 00:38:14.132, Speaker A: Is that when you got addicted to coffee?
00:38:14.268 - 00:38:20.544, Speaker B: Oh no, no. I've been addicted to coffee like since I was twelve or something. Can't you tell? Can't you tell? Scars?
00:38:20.844 - 00:38:29.828, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. Wait, wait. Can you, can you tell us about that time? Is that a. Is there anything that happened behind the scenes that was just like. Honestly, I'd love to hear about that time.
00:38:29.956 - 00:39:10.400, Speaker B: It just felt like today people like take for granted how powerful and beautiful defi is, the extent of these orderly liquidations. I always am shocked and surprised in a good way of how good the system works back then. There's a couple of things that went wrong, including the most important one, which is maker didn't have a very good keeper ecosystem, meaning people that liquidate the collateral when the price, when the price falls and needs to be liquidated. And it was some things that have been solved. I think it was just too difficult. There was not a lot of documentation. It wasn't easy.
00:39:10.400 - 00:39:51.738, Speaker B: Now it's become easier. But, yeah, for a while there, you were just looking at the screens, like, if ETH goes down another $20, I don't know what's going to happen to maker. Like, I don't know if we're going to be able to absorb all these liquidations. And so it was just a very, it was a very difficult time. And historically, the community has been, there was a subset of the maker community that was, been very vocal against keeping it pure, pristine collateral, like single collateral die, backed purely by ETH. But I think in that moment in time, it was just like, all right, let's just kind of survive and introduce other forms of collateral, because ETH just felt like it was. You didn't know when it was going to stop.
00:39:51.738 - 00:40:04.860, Speaker B: Eric talked about this in the episode yesterday. It's like, there's no bailouts here, guys. Like, there's no. No halting markets. You know, these are 24/7 markets. It's pure, like laissez faire. It's just, it's just, it could be savage out there.
00:40:04.972 - 00:40:05.332, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:40:05.388 - 00:40:14.996, Speaker B: And you didn't know where it was gonna bottom. And so introducing another form of collateral just felt like it would, it was the right thing to do to ensure that, you know, the survivability of the protocol.
00:40:15.140 - 00:40:53.158, Speaker A: Yeah. So here's what happened. Basically, onboarded USDC that helped ensure dais liquidity, helped prevent deviation from the peg. The downside of that is you don't earn any revenues to counterbalance some of the increased credit and centralization risk that maybe you have when you bring on USDC. So TLDR USDC has been great for maker to maintain the dollar peg, but maker misses out on this massive amount of revenue that they could be receiving from the interest on these stables. And so the community passed MIP 65 last Friday. This dictates where $500 million of USD C should go.
00:40:53.158 - 00:41:26.520, Speaker A: The winning choice was a combination of 80% us short term treasuries and 20% investment grade corporate bonds purchased by our friends over at Blackrock. The Dow also approved this morning a $100 million DAi debt facility proposed by HBB Huntington Valley bank. That is a bank that is 151 years old. This would be the largest real world asset maker vault to date and the first collateral integration from a us based bank into the DeFi ecosystem. This is a big freaking deal. I think this is not being talked about enough. It's 100.
00:41:26.552 - 00:41:33.284, Speaker B: I mean, this might be the most important, like, news that coming out of a long time DeFi and no one agrees.
00:41:33.784 - 00:41:35.744, Speaker A: I think all of crypto actually all.
00:41:35.784 - 00:42:06.538, Speaker B: Crypto, because in bear markets, these things go unnoticed. Right. But if you're paying attention, you look at this and you're like. And we talked about it with Eric yesterday, what needed to happen for DeFi, in whatever shape form it's going to be to become the operating standard. This introducing real world assets is messy, is complicated, it's tricky. But the fact that this is happening is very moment. It could set us up for the next bull run whenever that happens, and DeFi leading the charge, you know what I mean?
00:42:06.586 - 00:42:07.010, Speaker A: Yep.
00:42:07.122 - 00:42:07.490, Speaker B: Yep.
00:42:07.562 - 00:42:28.666, Speaker A: Agreed. I mean, this is Huntington Valley bank is not a big bank, but I think the number to look at here, HBB has about, I think, 500 million in assets. They're putting 100 million into a maker vault. That is, 20% of the bank's assets are going into a maker vault, if I understand this correctly. So pretty damn big deal. Also, some big governance decisions are being made over at maker. It feels like there are kind of two camps.
00:42:28.666 - 00:42:52.530, Speaker A: You've got the, like the roon camp and you've got the Hasu camp. Big shout out to Hasoo, who is doing a lot to, I think, move governance forward. Really, really think deeply about daos. Why are they valuable? Why are they necessary? What is the best way to organize them? So I would recommend folks pay attention to that. Hasoo is going to come on the podcast. We're doing a big episode on Maker. We've got Monet supply coming on Sam from over at Maker.
00:42:52.530 - 00:43:12.096, Speaker A: So I'm really excited about some of those episodes that are coming up. Also on the defi side of things, Aave, our friends. Your friends, Donnie. Our lads over at Aave launched their own stablecoin today. No. Or they're announcing they're voting on a proposal to build a stable coin. I have a feeling it'll get passed.
00:43:12.096 - 00:43:13.484, Speaker A: It feels like a no brainer.
00:43:14.144 - 00:43:29.024, Speaker B: Yeah. It's been in the works for a while and it'd be very interesting to see how the community responds to that. But, yeah, this is something we should definitely talk about. I know we're running short on time, but this is something that, again, it's very momentous and we should be paying attention and covering it.
00:43:29.184 - 00:43:35.016, Speaker A: Yeah. You think compound regret. Do you remember back in 2020? Do you remember compound chain?
00:43:35.160 - 00:43:35.744, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:43:35.864 - 00:43:37.764, Speaker A: Just didn't really make it to market.
00:43:39.134 - 00:43:42.990, Speaker B: Is that. I don't know, has it been totally shelved or is that just.
00:43:43.062 - 00:43:51.394, Speaker A: I'm not sure, but I think compound was close, actually, to releasing a stable coin in 2020 when they announced compound chain, but it just didn't really make it to market.
00:43:51.854 - 00:43:53.638, Speaker B: Or has not yet made it to market.
00:43:53.726 - 00:44:08.660, Speaker A: It has not. Yeah. Which is funny. I remember 2020 looking at comp, like hearing that compound was thinking about a stable coin. I was like, ah, so late. Too late to the market with a stable. And just like, I think there's this feeling.
00:44:08.660 - 00:44:10.384, Speaker A: You always feel like you're late in crypto.
00:44:10.764 - 00:44:11.220, Speaker B: Oh yeah.
00:44:11.252 - 00:44:29.276, Speaker A: But still so early. So we do have to wrap it. I have a. We're recording with Matthew Ball, an amazing metaverse episode in a couple minutes. I think that's solo episode from me. So unfortunately we have to wrap this. Some other things I would recommend folks pay attention to.
00:44:29.276 - 00:44:54.946, Speaker A: We can drop these in the show notes. Mika or Micah, I forget how to pronounce his name. Honka Salo, who's been on the show before, has an idea for Uniswap, a roadmap for uni holders to take control of the Uniswap protocol. It's got a fee switch, experimentation, recognized delegation program, a public development roadmap, forming teams outside of Uniswap Labs. I'd really recommend people read that proposal from Micah or Mika. Ave proposed that. Yeah, Mika, thank you.
00:44:54.946 - 00:45:24.754, Speaker A: Ave proposed a native, decentralized, collateral backed stablecoin gho that is pegged to USD. We will put some notes in the show, notes like we just talked about. And then I would recommend folks look at the data from OpenSea. Opensea users are absolutely dropping off a cliff. Research analyst at Blockworks, Ryan Westy on Twitter showed that OpenSea users have dropped or fallen from 50,000 to 4000, which is just a colossal drop.
00:45:24.914 - 00:45:27.882, Speaker B: It's really the tail end of users. Yeah, it's really the small.
00:45:27.938 - 00:45:36.950, Speaker A: Yeah. Volume. Volume per user has skyrocketed. Right. So it's gone from half an ETH per user to three ETH. But so it's really just the power users, which we know would happen. We knew this would happen.
00:45:36.950 - 00:45:46.862, Speaker A: It's the power users in crypto. And then the last, last but not least, Reddit is launching a new NFT marketplace on polygon. So interesting development. Yeah.
00:45:46.918 - 00:45:57.554, Speaker B: The last thing is obviously bored ape the Metaverse. It was, I think it was a beta dry run, which a lot of people really psyched about. I think 2500 people showed up and pretty interesting.
00:45:58.374 - 00:46:26.300, Speaker A: Here's why. That news is actually way more interesting than people realize is I have buddies at like Epic Games and Fortnite Roblox and things like that. There's a big issue in gaming, which is it's really hard to get a lot of people in these like, metaverse worlds together. So like Fortnite, for example, caps each server at a couple hundred people. I think it's actually only 100 per game. Bored ape had 2500 people in their world yesterday, which is really impressive.
00:46:26.372 - 00:46:30.524, Speaker B: The clips, it looked like total, like burning man chaos. People were jumping.
00:46:30.644 - 00:46:33.308, Speaker A: I mean, it didn't look amazing, I.
00:46:33.316 - 00:46:46.940, Speaker B: Will say, but it looked like a New York place playground, like where people bring their dogs and everyone, as if everyone like, let their dogs like, unleash their dogs and they were just running around like crazy. It was just like total chaos, but somehow awesome to see.
00:46:47.012 - 00:47:00.492, Speaker A: So just really awesome. Yeah. It's a tough to bet against human ingenuity as Eric Peters talks about dropping that episode next week. Really excited for it. Santi, this has been a pleasure. I know I said I'd ask you some insider questions. Come prepared next week for the hard hitting cues.
00:47:00.548 - 00:47:08.162, Speaker B: We got. We gotta, we gotta leave some breadcrumbs for people to come back next week. So we'll see you next week, guys, and stay safe out there and, you know, have fun.
00:47:08.338 - 00:47:09.770, Speaker A: All right, be well, folks.
00:47:09.922 - 00:47:10.314, Speaker B: Thank you.
