Empire all right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Empire. We've got the roundup this week, but we have a special guest, which is, who's Ben Foreman? Ben, uh, long time friend of blockworks. Also, are. Are we calling you Santiago's ex boss or colleague? Uh, Santi, can we use the word boss here?
00:00:37.144 - 00:00:42.752, Speaker B: No. Like, uh, no, no. I used to work for Santiago back in the day. Um, no, we're.
00:00:42.808 - 00:00:44.360, Speaker C: We are, um, former.
00:00:44.472 - 00:00:46.124, Speaker B: Former, uh, teammates.
00:00:46.464 - 00:00:56.848, Speaker C: Former teammates. Still friends. Uh, Ben is a repeat guest, probably. You know, we've had a few people come on the pod, but, Ben, you've. This is your third time now in the podcast?
00:00:56.848 - 00:01:03.204, Speaker B: I think so. I think it was. I was on Belgrave once and then on Empire once. This is my. This is my third time.
00:01:03.584 - 00:01:13.192, Speaker C: Yeah. So great to have you on again, Ben. You have unique perspective in everything that's going on in crypto. And so, anyways, this should be a great episode.
00:01:13.368 - 00:01:13.864, Speaker B: Ben.
00:01:13.944 - 00:01:59.004, Speaker A: Ben and Santi, I have a kickoff question for both of you all. So, just for listeners, we're going to start off with a couple. We usually do the roundup on Friday, so we're going to talk about a couple of the big news stories of the week, specifically binance and maker moving kind of towards the end game. And then we'll do a much deeper dive with Ben into, like, state of Defi, state of venture that I think will be really interesting. But Ben Ansanti, question for both of you all to kick this off, basically, we saw Binance, who has, like, depending on what metrics you look at, somewhere between 70% to 90% market share of all trading volume in crypto. Their founder, CZ, was charged with evasion of federal law operating in illegal crypto derivatives exchanged by the CFTC. It also just came out like a day or two later that binance was kind of hiding these substantial links to China for the last several years.
00:01:59.004 - 00:02:20.544, Speaker A: Would be curious to get your take on. Just like, there's the, I think Adam Cochran take, which is that this is CFTC going for the jugular and that, like, this is the dagger that brings down binance. And there's other takes being like, this is just fud. This is way overblown. So what is your take on, like, signal to noise of this binance lawsuit?
00:02:24.804 - 00:02:27.104, Speaker B: Santiago, why don't you go first?
00:02:27.964 - 00:03:00.470, Speaker C: This is where the former boss kicks in. Yes, sir. Well, I think it's too early to tell, and I don't mean that as a cop out answer. It does feel, I think the CFTC, historically, their win rate has been higher. It's a very, it's a, it's like a 47 page doc, well documented. Uh, amongst the more interesting things are how did they get access to his phone records and or signal. And so I think it's, it's a fairly meaty case.
00:03:00.470 - 00:03:35.942, Speaker C: I think the precedent here is also bitmex, um, you know, they were charged with, I think, not having proper KyC, anti money laundering policies in place that allowed for fraudulent activity to take place. There's some records here as well, in terms of, you know, some chats there with, like, there's some, some links to, you know, bad actors, I guess. So I don't know what the outcome of this will be. I'm not sure. It's like a fatal blow. I think binance continues to operate in some capacity. Maybe binance us has to shut down.
00:03:35.942 - 00:04:05.114, Speaker C: Probably a huge fine. As far as how Adam's point was, it's going to be such a big find that, you know, basically CZ goes, you know, bankrupt and finance as well. I'm not sure that's all correct, but it's too early to tell. I just, I'm not an expert into how these cases get settled. Um, and like for. I guess the last point I'll make is, in the Bitmex case, initially, it felt like this huge blow, Bitmex is going to go out of business. Bitmex certainly had a reputational hit.
00:04:05.114 - 00:04:35.426, Speaker C: I guess the more important question is, if you're a fund, if you're an institutional player in crypto, are you going to be able to operate with binance and transact with them? I would argue a lot of more established funds weren't even interacting with Binance in the first place. And so the question then becomes, from a retail perspective, does that actually hinder their business going forward, where the power and influence of binance has the dominance that it has just goes down? And candidly, maybe that's a good thing, right?
00:04:35.530 - 00:05:10.098, Speaker A: I think that's the main point, Santi. There was this, the winner, mute founder, I'm blank. Yevgeny tweeted out. He said, what I genuinely didn't know in this whole binance thing was that it's not just retail, that's not allowed to trade derivatives on binance, but any us based entity, however, sophisticated they may be. And then he kind of subtweeted it and said all the largest us algo trading firms have stopped trading derivatives on not just binance, but all exchanges. That's a fairly big development for the whole ecosystem, not just for binance. So, Ben, I'm curious to get your, how do you contextualize something like this?
00:05:10.266 - 00:05:55.384, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that there are a few, like kind of second derivative spillover effects of something like this. Like one is, I just think it pulls even more activity on chain. You know, following FTX, like liquidity was kind of deleted, a big chunk of liquidity was deleted out of spot markets. Market makers pulled off many centralized exchanges. And so if to the extent binance has to kind of curtail its trading activities, thats a further blow. But youve seen recently metamask users really pick up. The past few months, I think they had the single largest day of swap volume gnosis safe deposits have picked up a lot.
00:05:55.384 - 00:06:23.254, Speaker B: Uniswap of had one of its highest months of volume on record. So I think this kind of pulls more volume and activity back on chain, or could. But look, I think for a while we're not going to really know the outcome of this. This is probably going to be a multi year lawsuit. And I think for the time being, it's a bit more noise than signal until we really understand more facts.
00:06:23.404 - 00:06:24.174, Speaker A: Hmm.
00:06:25.194 - 00:07:03.488, Speaker C: I'll go back to just emphasizing one point here, because I have been getting pinged more and more so by traditional players and be like, it's hard to be, to your question, on signal and noise, there's a lot of noise on this. I think a lot of people, their interpretation of these lawsuits and enforcement actions is very kind of knee jerk. I think you always need to peel it back and say, you have to wait until this goes to court. A lot of times it just gets settled, like Kraken settled, but like cobious will go to court. And it's been, I think that's the more interesting thing that we should be paying attention to. Like, you need to believe that the US has a very good judicial system that will interpret this. And by the way, that's the interpretation that we need because we need policy.
00:07:03.488 - 00:07:28.684, Speaker C: And that's probably going to come in 2024. And so in many ways, I think this is very net positive for the space. I mean, Ben, you and I used to talk about this. We just, so many people just say, I love crypto. I believe in it. In spite of FTX, in spite of Terra, we go back to the episode of Morgan Stanley, those guys are still going to continue to cover this space. It's just like this lingering regulation and lack of clarity that is really the most hurtful thing to the space.
00:07:28.684 - 00:07:36.252, Speaker C: And so all of these cases, I think, are going to push us closer to the direction of. We're going to finally, I think, get some greater clarity, finance included.
00:07:36.388 - 00:07:57.994, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a good point, Santa. I mean, Ben, what's your overall framework for this? Like, I think at this point it feels pretty clear. I don't know what we want to call it, Operation Choke .2.0 or crackdown on crypto, cutting off the onboarding exchanges and venues and things like that. What is your framework for how you're viewing just this big regulatory crackdown in the states right now?
00:07:58.494 - 00:08:36.114, Speaker B: Yeah, look, I think it's a short and medium term headwind in the US. I think Gensler's term officially ends in April 2026. It was a five year term. So we're kind of two years in, three years to go, and maybe it ends earlier, but I think this has a shelf life because whoever replaced him will, I think odds are they'll be more constructive and friendly towards crypto. But look, the way I kind of look at this is crypto is a global asset class. I think that's sometimes lost. The US has 4% of the global population.
00:08:36.114 - 00:09:15.414, Speaker B: 10% of crypto users are in the US. 10% of crypto trading volume, by our estimate, is in the US. So 90% is kind of overseas. I think only 30% of crypto developers are in the US. So I think underwrite, you can underwrite a thesis around crypto ex us and still believe in just a massive tam. But I mean, look, it's been a very uncertain regulatory environment. It's very difficult to convince someone to build in crypto in the US without that regulatory certainty.
00:09:15.414 - 00:09:53.770, Speaker B: And so, look, like long term, my general view is good technology wins, period. It's kind of like holding a balloon underwater. It eventually comes to the surface. That's the kind of natural gravity of things. And I don't think we're going to have perfect regulatory clarity for a while. But I've always viewed kind of regulation as more of opportunity than a risk. And there's a question of, like, what's the market pricing in right now? And I'm not sure it can get, you know, materially, you know, I'm not sure how much worse it can get.
00:09:53.770 - 00:09:58.174, Speaker B: Unless we go back to 1933 and there's executive order.
00:09:58.994 - 00:10:04.410, Speaker A: Yeah, I was going to say don't. Don't say those things, Ben. I feel like anytime that Asante and I say it can't get worse, it usually gets worse.
00:10:04.442 - 00:10:26.594, Speaker B: But, yeah, maybe. I mean, look, like I also, you know, was. Was. I was at TPG in 2011, 2012, and we were. We were looking at the Uber series B round. And at the time, literally everyone said, hey, this business model will ride sharing will never work. The taxi union will never allow it to happen.
00:10:26.594 - 00:10:55.414, Speaker B: I think, like, in Paris, like, the taxi unions were blocking the major highway and they shut it down in Austin. And then people just realized it is a ten x improvement to use Uber over taxis. And it won. And it was, like, jurisdiction by jurisdiction, and it took time and there wasn't clarity, but it ended up. It ended up proliferating. And same with Airbnb and the hotel union. So crypto is no different.
00:10:55.414 - 00:11:19.074, Speaker B: It's going up against finance and money, which are controlled by government. This is, like, not unexpected. And once there is regulatory clarity in crypto, the kind of. The investable opportunity set at that point will probably be diminished. We should all pack up and go home. The reason there's an opportunity here is because of the current uncertainty, to some respect.
00:11:21.054 - 00:11:43.740, Speaker A: How do you. Maybe, Ben, we can start with you. But, Santiago, I want to get your take on this, too. How do you both view price action today? Because I'm looking at these prices, and it almost does feel like a bit of a narrative violation, seeing. I mean, these are kind of rough numbers. Like, bitcoins up, like, 70% on the year. ETH is up 50%, Solana is up two x, Lido is up, like 150%.
00:11:43.740 - 00:12:02.790, Speaker A: Avax up 60%. Cosmos is up, like, 20%. So we're in the. In the light of, like, we've nuked every company. Half the reputations are dead, the whole industry. If you don't work in the industry, it's a laughing stock. But prices right now are two times off the lows.
00:12:02.790 - 00:12:05.754, Speaker A: So I'm curious how you view this price action.
00:12:06.974 - 00:12:51.994, Speaker B: Yeah, well, look, I think that tech has rallied this year overall. If you look at the biggest five companies in the US, they're up 19% year to date. The S and P is roughly up kind of flat year to date. So if you think about crypto as kind of being tech beta plus plus, it kind of makes sense. But look, I think that this year in liquid markets, I think there's going to be a fair amount of return dispersion between different names and in more of a token pickers market. What I'm kind of. This doesn't directly answer your question, but what I'm a little bit.
00:12:51.994 - 00:13:34.534, Speaker B: Makes me a bit more bearish overall is on the 1.1 trillion of crypto market cap, there's roughly, like five to 6% just inflation per year. So $55 to $65 billion of supply structurally coming online through token unlocks and staking rewards. And I'm just not sure who's going to buy all that. And so I don't think retail can absorb all that. I think institutions maybe come in and buy bitcoin or ethereum, but I don't think they're going to. They're going further down the list than that.
00:13:34.534 - 00:14:11.612, Speaker B: And I also think that crypto VC does not have a super strong bid right now. And so that makes me. I do think there is an element of a relief rally that we've seen this quarter on some of those names. But I think, again, this year will be very narrative driven. And if you own the top quartile, you could deliver significant alpha versus being in the bottom quartile will have a very correlated, uh, you know, market environment. You.
00:14:11.628 - 00:14:38.640, Speaker A: You still think it'll be narrative driven. So, we had Kane on the podcast, and, uh, one thing Santi and him were getting into, and that episode drops on Monday for anyone who's listening. But, um, one thing we got into is, is, uh, like, narrative driven rallies for some, and, like, narrative driven cycles, and when that could end and when maybe cycles will be driven by, or, like, winners will be picked by things like cash flows instead of just narratives. Um, and I kind of hear you pushing back on that a little bit.
00:14:38.792 - 00:15:42.330, Speaker B: So maybe I use the wrong term in narrative, I think there'll be dispersion in performance, and that performance will be driven by fundamentals and narratives. So, just as an example, we were looking at some interesting data. So, I mean, last year, if you look at in 2022, kind of the top 250 tokens on Coinmarketcap, and look at performance from January 1 through December 31, the median name was down 85%, and the median name in the top quartile was down 64%. So there was nowhere really to hide. But if you go back to 2019, 2020, there was a lot more variance in the market, and you had DeFi break out during certain time periods where the majors were basically flat, so there was significantly more dispersion. I do think fundamentals matter. I think long term fundamentals.
00:15:42.330 - 00:16:18.234, Speaker B: The market is a weighing machine, not a voting machine. But the reality is, the market is in crypto. Dows are still in price discovery. They're brand new asset class. So we could have a debate around should maker Dow be valued that ten times earnings or 100 times earnings? And that probably matters more than whether earnings are 50 million or 70 million, right. That's like a 40% difference versus a ten x different on multiples. So I think multiples matter more.
00:16:18.234 - 00:16:27.106, Speaker B: Multiples are dictated more by narrative than fundamentals, like perceived growth really is what.
00:16:27.130 - 00:17:04.514, Speaker C: Drives it, I guess, on this point, Ben, I'm really curious to get your thoughts generally, overall on the crypto VC market. I mean, where you guys sit, you traffic in both public and private markets. You have a growth fund, you have a liquid fund, you have a credit fund. So you're doing a bunch of strategies, but overall, walk us through how, for a founder or a project out there, how much capital is actually there to invest to absorb a lot of this supply that comes online. I'm just curious, some of the trends and things that you're observing in the market.
00:17:05.414 - 00:18:01.124, Speaker B: Yeah, I think this is a major challenge right now. So if you kind of look at crypto VC, there's been, we were looking back since inception, there's been roughly like $85 billion invested in crypto VC for the past like 1314 years. About like 60 billion. Of that 85 billion was invested in the past two years. And just rough math. If you assume that 60 billion bought 10% of these companies, that's $600 billion of private company market cap that's been created in crypto over the past two years. And my sense is just, if we draw proxies to public tech and liquid tokens, those names, there's probably 400 billion, say, two thirds of unrealized mark to market impact on the privates that have been deployed.
00:18:01.124 - 00:18:57.364, Speaker B: And we haven't really realized a lot of it. FTX was 32 billion, blockfi was five. If you kind of add up the names where the pain has been experienced, it's maybe like 50 billion. But what we're seeing is, I mean, there are just a lot of companies that are kind of zombies, for lack of a better term. They may have Runway, but they have no real product market fit. They're burning cash, or maybe they're making some revenue, but they have negative unit economics, like their activity is incentivized. And they're kind of fast approaching the moment of reckoning where maybe, I think the majority of these teams are going to see Runway depleted by, say, q four of this year or early next year.
00:18:57.364 - 00:20:05.564, Speaker B: And so right now, look, we've looked at deals where teams have a couple months of Runway left and are trying to raise a bridge round. We've looked at teams that, where there's no hope of ever clearing the pref stack, or we've looked at teams that have kind of been returning capital or trying to be aqua hired, but it does feel like we're going to see a lot of down rounds, a lot of pay to play, and I think this is kind of the mess that the excess of the last few years that we're going to have to clean up as an industry. And, look, I don't want to be overly negative, because on the other hand, I think there's a great deployment opportunity right now. I think there are incredible founders that are building in really interesting verticals, but also think it's important to be intellectually honest just about this deferred pain deferred mark to market that is coming over the next couple of years.
00:20:06.344 - 00:20:56.594, Speaker C: I was having this conversation today with a fund funds, probably the largest one in crypto, and they're like, you know, it felt like they're very impatient now. I was like, well, wait a minute, guys, like, impatient in the sense, like, tell me. I think the specific question was like, tell me an application that has real traction and like, killer use case. I was like, okay, good point. You got me cornered. And I guess the question for you is, are you experiencing, do you feel like there's a lot of fatigue in this? Like there's folks that increasingly are skeptical, critical of crypto? Look at it when you talk to potential LP's, and they're like, we just don't believe that the use case is there. This is just a casino, and people speculate, maybe that's a use case and we should just be more honest about it.
00:20:56.594 - 00:21:08.344, Speaker C: But I'm curious if you feel that the bar is much higher for someone coming in, for them to invest in the space, they'd rather just maybe go to AI or whatever.
00:21:08.684 - 00:22:04.664, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think particularly after chat GPT, which got to, I think, 100 million users in two months, was like a very. People tangibly could understand the impact that that technology has. Whereas with crypto, there are maybe six, 7 million users on Ethereum, and it's been close to eight years. So I do think it's difficult for people to grasp what the real use cases are, and I think that's spot on. People don't really care about zero knowledge proofs or L2, scaling the institutions that are allocating to the space. What they're more focused on is, why does this technology matter? And I think for use cases, Santiago, we obviously talked about this a ton. I think stable coins are probably the most real of any crypto use.
00:22:04.664 - 00:22:28.438, Speaker B: Case clearing $7.2 trillion on Ethereum last year. It's like 60 70% of Visa's settlement volume. It is real and it's gotten there in just a few years. And it's used in things like b two b payments. And I think that people can kind of grasp that. But I do think that is like the key.
00:22:28.438 - 00:23:15.784, Speaker B: The next unlock is people really being able to point their finger at a way that crypto is actually making a difference in their lives. And maybe honestly, a lot of the applications on blockchain within the Defi space are really more b two b. So people just start interacting with fintech companies and banks and don't actually. Complexity of DeFi is abstracted away. So they never really realize that their remittance to family members in another country is being settled via bitso or being settled in stablecoins. But I think right now that is like the major, that is the major challenges. Nothing's really captured allocators attention.
00:23:16.284 - 00:23:26.904, Speaker C: How big of an impact do you think base has and what are your general thoughts on this is Coinbase l two coin base, no pun intended.
00:23:28.604 - 00:24:19.584, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, look, I think it's a big opportunity to bring people on chain. Like Coinbase has 110 million registered users. And I mean, the challenge has always been that flow from like depositing fiat onto an exchange, buying crypto, but then from buying crypto, like getting it onto your metamask wallet or your Coinbase wallet or your rainbow wallet, that step is more difficult. And so if they can kind of hold users hands and bring them in, I mean, I think it could be, we could see double or triple the amount of users on chain without too many kind of underlying assumptions, is my take.
00:24:19.964 - 00:24:58.140, Speaker C: Yeah, because it feels to me like you need a handholding experience. It's almost like in the early days of the smartphone, you just had, maybe email, Internet was really slow, and then Apple really pushed it forward with the App Store. And there were certainly, there's a lot of apps right now in crypto. There will be more and better ones, but you need a trusted App Store that is base in this case, to hold you through that flow. And it's almost like you blur the lines between what is on chain and off chain. You just think, okay, I'm entering this crypto journey and Coinbase will hold you, will walk you through it. And I think that's super important for 99% of users.
00:24:58.252 - 00:25:36.226, Speaker A: But do you guys think that this will almost be like building a website in no code. Like when we started blockworks, we built our website on squarespace. And then it was like, okay, we need to graduate from Squarespace. So we went to something called Webflow, which was like a little more advanced, and then we're like, okay, now we're building like a real, like, media company here. We're going to graduate and from that and build like our own full stack infrastructure. Could you make a comparable thing to, like, okay, we'll start by using like Arbitrum's, like l three builder or like Coinbase base. But then like, once you want to actually, like, build this performant thing, maybe you do like the dy DX move and like, try to own the whole stack.
00:25:36.226 - 00:25:38.522, Speaker A: Do you think there's an analogy to, to be made there or.
00:25:38.538 - 00:26:03.232, Speaker C: No, not with composability, right. Because it's EVM compatible. So, like, just doesn't really, if you're from a builder perspective, not really. From a user perspective, doesn't really matter, right. As long as the website loads fast and you're not getting like your credit card stolen, that's all you really care about. Right. So I think, look, right now it's like we have the smartphone, we have pretty good bandwidth.
00:26:03.232 - 00:26:40.116, Speaker C: Like, transaction fees are negligible now, and people were complaining about those like a year ago. Now you have a infrastructure surplus. You probably need really good apps. So we don't. We're working on that, I'd say. But I want to get your take on just generally how you think about this opportunity between early stage where that market is, because valuations, have they adjusted, have they come down, are they picking back up how much activity you're seeing there versus the opportunity in the liquid market, and how you think about the opportunities in both sectors.
00:26:40.220 - 00:27:29.890, Speaker B: Look, I think the valuation environments, like orders of magnitude different than it was 18 months ago. Pre seed seed rounds are down to kind of the seven to $15 million range. And we were tracking this data internally back at the beginning of 2022, which was kind of close to the market peak. The average early stage token deal we looked at in say, January of last year was 72 million, fully diluted. So you've almost, you've seen a material kind of compression and look like. I think this is kind of back to where we were in 2015, 2016. Just broadly, if you look at teams coming out of Y combinator, you know, the median seed round was maybe at 8910 million posts.
00:27:29.890 - 00:28:26.764, Speaker B: If there was a killer team, second time founder, or someone building in a, in a really hot kind of category, maybe 20, maybe 25, but that would be on the absolute highest end. So we're kind of back to where I think we're back to more rational kind of valuation environment on these pre seed and seed deals. I think similar like Series A's are back to 40 to 60 million, B's are maybe 100 to 250 million. Everything is really reset. I would say anything later than Series B, you're not seeing deals get done because those companies want to avoid down round. So there is still activity in the very early stage market, which I think it's the best investment environment. It reminds me of 2019 and early 2020 from just a valuation standpoint.
00:28:26.764 - 00:29:33.214, Speaker B: And the other thing that's super interesting right now is just the secondary opportunities that have never existed in crypto before. So the biggest bankruptcy estates, FTX, Celsius, Voyager, they all ran big venture portfolios. I think FTX has 552 line items in their portfolio, like venture investments they've made in crypto companies. So that estate is divesting those names at very material discounts to know prior rounds. And then there's also kind of just secondary selling from investors who put capital into companies in 2021, 2022 more, I would say touristy capital. So generalist venture funds, crossover funds, corporate venture funds, and now maybe don't have conviction in crypto. So I think the fact that you can buy high quality growth names, a big, big discounts to prior round, is kind of cannibalizing any demand for primaries.
00:29:33.214 - 00:29:41.214, Speaker B: So I think it's a pretty interesting investing environment relative to what we've seen anytime recently.
00:29:41.634 - 00:30:19.162, Speaker C: How does the on the FTX specifically, I don't know if you've looked into this detail, but, like, people started complaining, wait a minute, SBF is paying all these fees from presumably depositor money were bankrolling his lawyers? Is that the case where there could be a clawback? So say that you were to buy bank like part of the FTX Ventures portfolio. You buy the position, then three years down the road the court says, no, no, wait a minute. That, like, that was used with misappropriated capital in the first place, so you got to give it back. Is that like a scenario that you like? Does that, does that make sense?
00:30:19.298 - 00:31:10.412, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think typically. So most of these asset sales that are being made from these estates require court approval to begin with. So if there's any kind of concern around, like avoidable preference payment or fraudulent conveyance, like that would, I think be considered prior to approving any of these asset sales. And then also there's, there's sometimes, like, this de minimis asset level exemption, where if there's an asset that's being sold that's less than 25 million cost or 5 million at market, then sometimes those have a more expedited approval process to get sold, and they don't require as much credit or approval. They can get approved much more quickly. So there's quite a bit.
00:31:10.412 - 00:31:25.024, Speaker B: I mean, there's maybe, like, five to $10 billion of, or probably closer to $10 billion of cost basis of crypto venture assets that are sitting across these bankruptcy states at the moment.
00:31:25.324 - 00:31:34.988, Speaker C: Out of curiosity, what kind of discount is there not just for the FTX stuff, but just generally in the market? Is this back to 60, 70, 80%, 90% discount? I'm curious.
00:31:35.076 - 00:31:36.624, Speaker A: Santa's ears are perking up.
00:31:36.924 - 00:31:37.704, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:31:40.474 - 00:31:42.426, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:31:42.610 - 00:31:44.090, Speaker C: This is on the dollar.
00:31:44.242 - 00:32:12.200, Speaker B: Yeah. The short answer is yes. Like, the discounts are. Are that material? In some cases, I think this was announced, like, Sui bought back a large, bought back their own position in that FTX had acquired, I believe, like a five or 10% discount. So I think first look and, like, a lot of these. These positions will have right of first refusals or transfer restrictions. So it's not like anyone can just show up and buy.
00:32:12.200 - 00:32:22.404, Speaker B: And if you do agree to buy, the company can kind of preempt you and buy back their own. Their own stock. But generally, like, yes, those discounts are.
00:32:23.104 - 00:32:55.484, Speaker A: Very real because there's this other market that we haven't talked about much on just this podcast in general, and Empire, but in this episode, which is buying directly from treasuries. So, Ben, we're talking about the private market deals that are these down rounds. Then there's these public markets that might be undervalued. Like, if you're a blue chip, then there's this third bucket, which is like, these deals that kind of look like private deals because you're getting discounts, you're getting lockups, but you're going directly and buying a token. Can one of you guys just kind of give me an insight into what that market looks like today?
00:32:55.644 - 00:33:00.440, Speaker C: God, I think we invented that market, didn't we, Ben? Yeah, no, no, no, we did.
00:33:00.472 - 00:33:13.696, Speaker B: Yeah, no, we. I think. I think we did. We, like, we called them, like, pipe teas. So private. Yeah, like a pipe in public equity land, but in crypto, but, yeah, no. Santiago, go ahead.
00:33:13.696 - 00:33:15.016, Speaker B: And this is the paraphy.
00:33:15.120 - 00:33:18.044, Speaker A: What was the. What was the first deal? What was the first pipe? T.
00:33:19.944 - 00:33:23.044, Speaker C: Ave probably returned our fund.
00:33:23.704 - 00:33:24.360, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:33:24.432 - 00:33:57.582, Speaker C: Shout out to Stani and all the team. They're doing great work. Listen, we, yeah, it was, uh, we went to them and look, people say, oh, you got a great deal. It's like, there was a lot of work that goes into convincing a team to open up and then sell you tokens. Even back in the bear market, it was like. And so we, we just, we had so many meetings with them of like, saying we got to restructure the token. This was a time where like, the token model was like, pretty broken, whereas, like, distributing like, fees to everyone and not just active stakers.
00:33:57.582 - 00:34:34.798, Speaker C: So we did a lot of work. At least paraphy is fun. We would go to the team, do so much work, show value upfront, and then to say, hey, listen, we're willing to be a long term partner for you. And would you, I guess you could sell in the open market, what's going to be the signaling of that versus. I would consider it. This is like a fundraiser of itself because you're parking tokens to a good custodian that is going to commit it to, like, there's some clauses in there that was like, we're going to help you in XYZ in a very concrete manner. And so we did that with so many other projects after that, and then others started copying the market.
00:34:34.798 - 00:35:15.613, Speaker C: Like, we, we were one of the largest investors in Lido. And then, like, there was like a few funds, I think it was dragonfly and like paradigm, that paradigm did execute it on, but it had to be on chain. Like, it was like they formally wrote a proposal in the governance form and said, hey, we want to buy x percent. And the token holders would vote and sometimes it would pass, other times it didn't. Like when FTX ventures, funny enough, or it was lightspeed, wanted to buy sushi, got denied by the community and. But yeah, I think for a team, it's, you know, you almost, you always want to find a good partner, right? And this happens like that, as Ben said, like, pipes are fairly common. Like, like Warren Buffett does this exceptionally well.
00:35:15.613 - 00:35:27.460, Speaker C: I think he probably is going to do more of these in this current environment. He did that in the global financial crisis. And for a team, it's great insofar as you find a really good partner, right. By the way, it locks it up for multiple years.
00:35:27.492 - 00:35:27.660, Speaker B: Right.
00:35:27.692 - 00:35:28.620, Speaker C: When you sell the open market.
00:35:28.692 - 00:35:36.108, Speaker A: So it is like a private deal, right. And that you're locked. Like, let's say you buy from the Lido treasury today, you might get. So Lido's trading at 2.2, fully diluted today.
00:35:36.156 - 00:35:36.972, Speaker C: Get some discount.
00:35:37.068 - 00:35:42.244, Speaker A: You might get it at like a 30% discount, but you're locked for a year or two, basically. Structure.
00:35:42.404 - 00:35:57.876, Speaker C: Yeah. You factor in an illiquidity discount. If there's an options market, then you can also reference that as just, or just generally look at the volatility of the token and say, hey, if the ball of the token is like 20% or so in the last, like, x percent, well, we should be getting probably that plus a liquidity discount, right?
00:35:57.980 - 00:35:58.268, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:35:58.316 - 00:36:08.068, Speaker C: Hopefully not to give them too much of the secret sauce here. But anyways, teams can try to do it. Not all of them actually can do it because at the end of the day, you really need a hustle to prove your worth.
00:36:08.196 - 00:36:10.540, Speaker A: So, Ben, what does this market look like today? Right now?
00:36:10.652 - 00:36:50.138, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think it's. I think there's a little bit of adverse selection in the market today because token prices are down so much. So teams to then sell at like, an additional discount of 30, 40, 50% is, I think, a lot for teams to kind of swallow. So the teams that are doing it are the ones that actually, like, need to extend their Runway or have, like, a very firm use case, use of proceeds for that. That capital back in 2021, early 2022. I think there were, like, you know, massive deals like this that were getting done. I think today it's a bit.
00:36:50.138 - 00:36:52.214, Speaker B: A bit less. Less common.
00:36:53.954 - 00:36:57.506, Speaker A: That's interesting. I didn't realize you guys started that with Aave. That's cool.
00:36:57.690 - 00:37:06.730, Speaker C: I mean, if anyone wants to contest that, feel free to comment. Yeah, it was a big part of our strategy.
00:37:06.842 - 00:37:12.988, Speaker A: Yeah. Ben, any other hidden stories from. From the early parafy deal days that you. That you.
00:37:13.036 - 00:37:14.824, Speaker B: Too many. Too many.
00:37:15.724 - 00:37:42.088, Speaker C: The best one for me is. Was. And it's relevant in the sense of when people ask you, like, how big do you think this space is going to be? Sort of like this idea that you underestimate, like, what can happen. The timing is really difficult, but, like, I think we were having discussions around how big DeFi could get, how much capital could be locked in some of these protocols. And, like, we were modeling out. Like, Ave had, like, it was like four or 5 million in deposits, maybe. Maybe a million.
00:37:42.088 - 00:38:00.320, Speaker C: It was like less than a million when we were looking at it. And then all of a sudden that went to, like 200 billion. I don't know if it. No, actually not 200 billion. It was like, it was like, in the billions. Right? Like that, to me was always like, yeah, you can think that you're smart. You think, like, it's.
00:38:00.320 - 00:38:08.694, Speaker C: We're using these things. And all of a sudden it was like, yeah, how? Like, you just go from less than a million to a couple billion and you're like, okay, well, that happened.
00:38:09.114 - 00:38:50.732, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, I think in, like, in every model that we built, we were thinking linearly or more linearly in terms of growth. And like, the, just the pace of, like, acceleration after Defi summer for that, like, next twelve to 18 months was like a far right tail. Like, you know, the upside case, it far exceeded any kind of bull case that we, I think, could have put together. No, I think the story, the one story that always sticks in my mind from it kind of also reminds me a bit of today's environment was just black Thursday with makerdao. I mean, that was in my, like. Whereas I think back to like, a watershed moment for the space.
00:38:50.732 - 00:39:03.878, Speaker B: I mean, everything, everything could have changed. Uh, I think ETH was hugging like $80 at the time. And if it would have broken $80, Makerdao would have. Basically, there's no defi.
00:39:03.926 - 00:39:07.622, Speaker A: You could argue there's like, no, no def. Yeah, sets defi back five years.
00:39:07.758 - 00:39:08.846, Speaker C: That was existential.
00:39:08.990 - 00:39:13.834, Speaker A: That was actually for people who don't know that story, can, can one of you maybe actually share that a little bit?
00:39:14.574 - 00:39:14.910, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:39:14.942 - 00:39:15.954, Speaker C: Then go for it.
00:39:16.494 - 00:40:08.852, Speaker B: Uh, so, yeah, so that was. So this was in, uh, I think the second week of March, uh, in 2020. And this was kind of like right at the beginning of the pandemic when lockdowns were starting and, you know, equity markets were really trailing off. And there was a, you know, one, one night, I think it was a Thursday night or Wednesday night into Thursday, where everything was down, like bitcoin and ETH were down 50% in like 12 hours. And alts were down, some of them were down like 60, 70%. And it actually happened in two phases. So it was like six hour phase where bitcoin went down 25, 30%, and then people bought that dip, and then it went down again and just crushed.
00:40:08.852 - 00:40:55.050, Speaker B: It crushed a number of funds, a number of. There was just a lot of stress in the system. But specifically on Makerdao, what happened is the collateralized debt positions, which were. People had posted ETH and borrowed, Dai were getting liquidated. The issue was that the way the liquidations worked is people bid on the ETH collateral, and because gas prices were so high on the ethereum network, people could, people were bidding far below, like, the value of those assets. This was back when gas prices were like, when the network got congested gas price, because we didn't have like, l two s back then. So the, like, no one could really bid on this collateral.
00:40:55.050 - 00:41:27.764, Speaker B: There was also only maybe, like one or two people bidding because there weren't as many market makers in Defi at the time. So basically, like, the collateral that was getting bid on was getting bid at a meaningful haircut that was below the amount of debt that maker Dow had issued. And so there was impairment to the system. And there were a few other dynamics. And Sandy, you probably remember these more, but basically, Dai was also breaking. The other dynamic, which was interesting is yet dai was daisy stablecoins. People know it was breaking above the peg.
00:41:27.764 - 00:41:40.334, Speaker B: It was trading at like $1.20 because there was just no liquidity. Everyone wanted to buy Dai to delever, and there was no liquidity on Coinbase. No one could find it.
00:41:40.454 - 00:41:44.166, Speaker C: There's no curve or curve was just not even.
00:41:44.350 - 00:42:01.062, Speaker B: Not around at the time. Yeah. So people had to. There were maker calls all day. Eventually, USDC was added as collateral, so you could put one USDC in and borrow one Dai. And that alleviated the pressure on Daisy create.
00:42:01.118 - 00:42:36.864, Speaker C: And by the way, had that not happened. That's very contentious, by the way. And we were advocating for it because, like, guys, if we don't do this, it's gonna, like, maker goes like, that was the watershed moment where, like, people rallied behind USDC because it was like, this is one of the more important things for this viability of maker and stability of maker. And, yeah, now we're in a world where USDC is a big part of the collateral base, but there was a lot of really anti USDC folks at the time. And it came a moment of, like, come to Jesus moments. Like, guys, we don't do this. We don't know if we're gonna be here in 24 hours.
00:42:37.364 - 00:42:37.772, Speaker B: Right?
00:42:37.828 - 00:42:46.424, Speaker A: And was there someone on the other end of this, too? Like, I don't want to use the word exploiting the protocol, but, like. Like, shorting the hell out of the. Shorting the hell out of maker or.
00:42:47.244 - 00:42:50.564, Speaker B: I'm not sure. I'm not sure. There was maybe. Um.
00:42:50.644 - 00:42:56.066, Speaker C: Yeah, there's always rumors of minors coordinating and, you know, I've heard some of those.
00:42:56.140 - 00:42:56.806, Speaker B: The.
00:42:56.990 - 00:43:16.614, Speaker C: It's hard to say, but I think. Yeah, I remember calling Ben. This was the night before, because I had to wake up super early that morning because I was giving a class at NYU. And so we were in the San Francisco. I woke up at, like, four or five in the morning, and this was all happening. And I thought it was like, I didn't have. I wouldn't grab coffee.
00:43:16.614 - 00:43:50.364, Speaker C: Because I thought, like, my addiction to caffeine was to a point where I, like, was not reading prices correctly. But I remember calling in the night before, and it was like, this is where the. The big catalyst there was. I think the World Health Organization came out that morning saying, COVID is a global pandemic. But more so, I remember seeing a headline that was, like, super stupid. Like, Mel Gibson and some other celebrity had gotten COVID, and I called Ben and said, hey, man, I feel like. I feel like this is the moment where people say, like, oh, shit, eve royalty and celebrities can't, like, protect themselves from this stuff.
00:43:50.364 - 00:43:52.584, Speaker C: Then that's where, like, it. It hits home.
00:43:53.244 - 00:43:57.716, Speaker A: And the NBA lockdown the day before Black Thursday. I remember the NBA.
00:43:57.820 - 00:44:26.558, Speaker C: There's, like, a few, like, subtle things like that, and I think that's something that I've come to appreciate. Just like in crypto, like, these very subtle. Like, you can then extrapolate and say, okay, this is why, like, when you think about the Wall street bets phenomenon, Silicon Valley bank, like, feel like we're in the state of the world where, like, the information propagation, like, coordination, and then the coordination of that, and, like, how actionable things. It's just these things escalate super quickly. Um, it was. It was a fun 72 hours, I'd say.
00:44:26.646 - 00:44:35.974, Speaker B: It's kind of amazing to think that, you know, like, makerdao has kind of survived as long as it has, despite all these challenges, and Defi survived as long as it has.
00:44:36.014 - 00:44:36.518, Speaker C: Absolutely.
00:44:36.606 - 00:44:36.830, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:44:36.862 - 00:45:08.096, Speaker C: I mean, and then the thing, like, people, like, we obviously think that was a very scary moment, because the. You see something go down 80%, you're like, holy. Holy shit. But, like, the sheer number. The absolute number of liquidations that have happened since Black Thursday, there's been events where, like, there's been far greater, you know, sheer amount of dollar amount of liquidations that have happened and been absorbed by Defi in a fairly seamless, flawless manner. And so all the more impressive that, you know, crypto sort of built all this resiliency.
00:45:08.240 - 00:45:50.706, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think at the time, there was maybe a $5 million shortfall that I think think was absorbed by VC's, which was actually a huge amount of VC capital at the time to buy MKR at auction to cover the shortfall. But I think that it was almost like a blessing in a way, because, if you can, because that it stressed the system. So we were able to identify these vulnerabilities and then patch them and build up kind of this Lindy effect. So it's almost so. To some degree it was like a blessing that the system was stress tested then, because if it wasn't stress tested then and only experienced a small loss, it perhaps would have been bigger at one of the subsequent crashes when there was far more dai outstanding.

00:46:50.244 - 00:47:44.144, Speaker C: I think parafy really made its name as kind of defi and being super active in defi markets and it becoming a huge category. We had Kain on and we had the same, I'll ask you the same question that I did him. Degen Spartan, a very well known personality in Twitter, always likes to post the chart of DeFi versus ETH. And Defi has been in this down market well before Terra, well before three arrows. It was just, it was coming off six months before rates were even hiked. And so what's the state of Defi? Walk us through what your thesis has been, how it has evolved, and what do you see going forward as you are as excited DeFi today, or do you see opportunities elsewhere? How do you think about all that?
00:47:45.484 - 00:49:15.484, Speaker B: Yeah, I think I remain very excited about DeFi, but the areas in which I'm excited specifically of maybe shifted a bit. So I think big picture, maybe there have been three to 4000 DeFi projects that have launched since DeFi summer Dex we've seen in other universes we monitor, and maybe there are 30 to 40 of those that are even relevant today, and maybe only five to ten that actually truly matters, and maybe a subset of those will actually kind of survive long term. So I think the vast majority of activity has been, you know, there's been a lot of experiments and many of them have died by, you know, death by governance death by lack of originality or lack of community or some sort of smart contract bug. So I think this, like first vintage of Defi names was, was really interesting. I think we learned a lot, but basically we really only have, as I think about it, product market fit in two areas in Defi today. Spot trading mostly on amms and then borrowing and lending on compound and aave. And maybe there's a little bit on insurance and perps and things like that, but there's not really much else outside of that.
00:49:15.484 - 00:50:15.314, Speaker B: And where we've been more focused recently has been on this theme of more permissioned Defi and tokenization of real world assets. And it's not mutually exclusive with the permissionless defi world that we've all come to know and love. But it's interesting because I think it accesses a very, very large tam and solves some very. Solves problems that are really interesting and create a lot of value. So that's been a big area of focus for us. So it's a more regulated DeFi where institutions that have gone through KYC, AML are trading, lending, borrowing, buying insurance, issuing securities, but all in a permissioned, regulatory compliant, you know, environment. And so that's really where we've.
00:50:15.314 - 00:50:21.054, Speaker B: And we can double click on this more. But that's been, I would say, our kind of major area of focus as of late.
00:50:21.754 - 00:51:05.554, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm curious to dive just a little bit deeper on that. And obviously it sounds like liquidity is really dried up. Like you have. A lot of the centralized players have gone out of business because of terrible risk management. And it's pretty hard. There's like a few pieces of infrastructure that have really been gone away or just severely handicapped now in the centralized manner, do you think that that shifts on chain at some point, or are you excited and also looking at building a better genesis with a better team and risk management in place, or a better blockfi? I mean, I'm curious how you think this. There's been a lot of ashes currently that avoids in the market, particularly liquidity, that needs to be kind of.
00:51:05.554 - 00:51:08.866, Speaker C: Where do you think that infrastructure gets built and by who?
00:51:09.010 - 00:51:58.018, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think that. And maybe this is a contrarian take, you guys tell me, but I think there's this narrative that C five is dead and like, not coming back. And I think kind of the blockfis of the world, or different iterations of Blockfi's with better risk management are going to, are going to come back and they're going to be important in the space. But I think they'll look different. So some sort of hybrid of CFI and DeFi where you get the benefits of DeFi like the transparency and the global nature and the programmability and the instant settlement. But you'll have the front end of a CFI platform which is more user friendly. You can pick up the phone and do, you can get tax forms.
00:51:58.018 - 00:53:04.546, Speaker B: It's Kyc AML kind of customer support and you kind of get like the best of both worlds. So I think that that is, you know, that's going to be a major theme. I mean, we have to ask ourselves like what's interesting right now is, you know, on Makerdao, back to Makerdao or even compound or Aave, people can borrow stables at a much, much lower rate than you can borrow in OTC markets but people aren't doing it. And despite the fact that it's maybe 6700 basis points cheaper. And so the question is why? And I can tell you why. My thesis for it is just that people don't want the stress of interacting with smart contracts. The infrastructure isn't totally there to get alerts in the middle of the night if the market's trading down, you know, if, if the market's trading down, um, and you have a position with um, you know, Galaxy or, you know, Cumberland, you know, they give you time to post margin.
00:53:04.546 - 00:53:18.134, Speaker B: It's, it's a bit more white glove experience and so people are willing to pay more for that, that experience. And so I think there's a way to really bridge the two worlds, uh, that, you know, would benefit both.
00:53:18.474 - 00:54:00.056, Speaker C: For anyone listening, we, I was to telling this to one team that I invested in JPEG for nfts as collateral. I said, guys, why can't someone build like a smart contract that has a time lock where if you get liquidated it goes into this escrow account that has a time lock where you can refill collateral for 48 hours or some and you pay like an annual like insurance fee that you pay the prime broker, like, and it's a fee for the protocol. I'm like, hey, can Ave. Hey, Stan, are you listening? Like, why don't you just build this? Because I know for a fact a lot of funds for this reason don't use defi because. Yeah, you're right. Like black Thursday happens. You get three calls to refill the collateral during those 24 hours and it's appreciated, right? You don't want to lose that collateral.
00:54:00.056 - 00:54:36.814, Speaker C: And I think there's a way to like work the this way in a programmable manner right. And there's some logic in a flow that can work. Speaking of, like, state, like you reference, like, you know, borrowing stables and whatnot, what, um, what's going through your mind when USDC de pegs, uh, or de peg, like a couple weeks back, you and I were talking about that. But I'm just kind of curious, like, as a, as a first question into generally what you think about stable coins central, like CBDCs, Tether, USDC and whatnot.
00:54:36.934 - 00:55:32.940, Speaker B: Yeah, I think my first, like, reaction was know, like any, like, fiat backed stable coin is only as strong as the banking system that's, that's behind it. And so when it first traded off, I mean, like, when they gave disclosure around what their, what their kind of banking exposure was, and they circle mentioned, hey, we have $3.3 billion with Silicon Valley bank. Of the 40 billion of USDC outstanding, I think that allowed kind of everyone to kind of size, kind of the exact 8% of the exact kind of shortfall that would be if the money on SBB got a zero recovery, which I think would be a pretty aggressive assumption. I think the average, in an average bank failure, uninsured depositors have recouped like $0.77 on the dollar. We were looking at some data, so we, so I was quite surprised to see USDC trade all the way down.
00:55:32.940 - 00:56:27.590, Speaker B: To think there were some weird dynamics over that weekend where banking rails weren't live Coinbase. You couldn't convert, you know, you couldn't convert USD into USDC one to one. So there's very limited liquidity on centralized exchanges. You also saw tether break, break above the peg. I mean, it was a really fascinating environment. My thought in the aftermath of it, the question I've been asking myself, I'm curious to your guys take on this is like, what are people going to think about USDC after this event? Will people have a more positive view on it? Like, hey, it was able to actually survive, or will people not want to touch it anymore? And that's been, and I used, I think you've seen since this event, USDC supply come down from 40 billion to 33, 34 billion, and then tether supply grow. So maybe that says the market is.
00:56:27.702 - 00:57:10.524, Speaker A: I think it depends who you are, Ben. Like, I think, I think if you're crypto native, this is a supportive event for us. DC. This makes you almost instills more confidence in USDC. You're like, this was really battle tested. And it gives me a bit of confidence that they'll kind of do what it takes to make sure that the peg maintains there is a cohort of people who work at traditional financial institutions, who work in compliance departments that were completely spooked by this. And we've had a couple of calls with these folks at the major payment processors and some of the bulge brackets who had considered touching USDC in one way or another that won't touch it with a ten foot pole now, and that's because of their compliance departments.
00:57:13.864 - 00:58:03.054, Speaker C: How much of your business you reference? Like, it's still fairly kind of difficult. Certain parts of what you're used to in traditional finance, your prime brokerage, like your on ramps, like the way you cross margin, and some of these things, like the infrastructure to like, operate as a fund manager in crypto is still very nascent. And like, when you come from traditional finance, you're like, wow, like we're in diapers here. We had the Morgan Stanley team on. They, they kind of were of the same, um, uh, belief. How much has your life changed in terms of how more difficult is it for you, given everything that's going on in the banking crisis? Obviously, we don't know. You talk about like the deep egg in large part being because banks like you didn't have the send network, which was a huge part of how market make, like how you'd settle trades, especially on the weekend.
00:58:03.054 - 00:58:23.766, Speaker C: You have signature and Silvergate basically gone out of the equation. What does that mean for the stability of something like USDC? What does that mean for generally the OTC market? Like liquidity in the market and then maybe tying that into kind of this whole banking crisis and macro. But we'll get to that in a bit.
00:58:23.930 - 00:59:24.882, Speaker B: Yeah, there's a lot there. I mean, look, like, I think I was listening to another Empire episode and someone brought up the point that it's like, actually it's very complex to operate a crypto fund. All the infrastructure required that it doesn't really make sense to do unless you're at scale. And look, I think things have gotten a little bit easier, but it's, you need to onboard with like ten to 15 different counterparties, OTC desks, custodians, exchanges on chain infrastructure like fire blocks and copper. And you need to set up a number of complex, like, internal policies around how value is moved. And it does make me jealous of friends who start, you know, long short equity hedge funds and literally just have one account they log into and can do everything from one, one interface. So the short answer is, it actually hasn't gotten.
00:59:24.882 - 00:59:59.294, Speaker B: It's gotten a little easier, but not nearly where it needs to be. The. I think the. I guess the second part of your question is, or the other part of your question is kind of around what's happened to the infrastructure recently. And I think that right now you've seen you have a lot less OTC borrowing and lending. That market is a shell of its former self. A couple of.
00:59:59.294 - 01:00:53.370, Speaker B: I mean, maybe down 90%. If you look at loans outstanding, there's no real market for borrowing OTC. And then the spreads on even major tokens have widened out a lot. There's a lot less spot liquidity than there was previously. There's actually on chain is actually kind of oftentimes the best place to find liquidity, to find good execution. But this has caused a structural reset to the space. I think on the banking side, we, in the aftermath of SBB signature and Silvergate, we've seen crypto companies able to open accounts elsewhere, at least what we've seen.
01:00:53.370 - 01:01:43.774, Speaker B: So I think that's positive, but who knows how long term that is and where things will go next. And I think the last thing just broadly in the banking crisis is it is interesting because we have seen just a resurgence in a lot of stuff happening on chain. All the metrics are up. I think Q one of 2023 is going to be a lot better than Q four of 2022. And some of the certain months of Q one are going to be actually very, very good. As you look at everything like monthly actives, trading volumes, fees, originations across defi, it's actually been. It's picked up a lot.
01:01:43.774 - 01:02:04.394, Speaker B: So my sense is kind of the bank account of last resort for a lot of companies in crypto will be just USDC in a nosa safe wallet. And so I think that's. That's been another kind of interesting, uh, interesting dynamic.
01:02:06.694 - 01:02:36.584, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. And there's been, obviously, some folks that, you know, I want to tie this into just a bit on the regulatory side of things that you kind of referenced. I think this act where at some point they made holding gold illegal in the US in the thirties. Um, what probability do you ascribe to that event happening for crypto where the US government says, hey, you can't. You can't hold crypto. Like, how regulation has always been a thing in crypto. Like, there's always these walls of worry that we need to climb.
01:02:36.584 - 01:02:49.484, Speaker C: But I'm curious generally what you think different scenarios for the regulatory environment. What are the things that you're mostly interested in and maybe hopeful that can happen over the next 1218 months?
01:02:50.664 - 01:03:51.454, Speaker B: I think if I had to, like, peg a probability of, like, confiscation of property, like, of digital assets, like, maybe this is naive or optimistic, but I would say, like, low single digit percentage, I mean, I think it's non zero, but I just don't know that it's certainly not like, the base case. There's also a question of if that happens, what happens to the. What happens to market prices? And I don't think it's necessarily the answer is that there's a massive shock to the downside. I think gold actually performed fairly well in the couple decades following the confiscations as it was traded globally. But look, I think regulation is just the biggest challenge. It's both the biggest challenge and the biggest opportunity in the space right now. You know, that's why, and that's why I think it just has to be a focus of everyone in the industry.
01:03:51.454 - 01:04:35.168, Speaker B: And I think as the technology gets better and as we prove, like, real use cases that actually provide people with value, I think the regulation will actually kind of follow and catch up to them. You're seeing this with a bit with chat GPT in the AI space right now where some people are saying, hey, we need to slow down. Like, we're not aware of all the risks that this could inflict on humanity. And other people are like, well, look, this is other people that are pushing it forward saying, hey, look, we need to come. We don't want to slow this down because this technology is incredibly useful. It's not abstract anymore. It's useful, and we should figure out some guardrails, but we should push it forward.
01:04:35.168 - 01:04:46.524, Speaker B: And so I think in crypto right now, people just want to regulate it because it's providing for most people very little value. And so that, to me, is big is going to be critical.
01:04:46.944 - 01:05:16.694, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't think anyone at this point disagrees that there some regulation is good. We just got to figure out a sensible regulation that kind of meets this new technology. Can't regulate new technology with necessarily old playbooks. It needs to be somewhat adapted. We've covered a lot in this episode. One of the things that I think we always appreciate is just getting your thoughts on generally. What are the things that you're mostly focused on in terms of what are you paying attention to? What are you reading, what's interesting to you in the market? Anything else you think is interesting?
01:05:18.474 - 01:05:48.252, Speaker B: So one of the areas I mentioned it earlier is if you look at tokenization of real world assets, it's had a bit of a renaissance recently. So we track an index of non stablecoin rwas because stablecoins are the biggest RWA tokenized dollars. But non stablecoin rwas are up like five x in the past six, seven months in terms of on chain volumes. And some of that's interesting.
01:05:48.308 - 01:05:50.996, Speaker C: What are these things? Yeah, I was gonna say, yeah, it's.
01:05:51.020 - 01:06:48.374, Speaker B: Like things like treasuries, tokenized credit, they're tokenized carbon credit markets. A lot of the categories that are getting tackled first are more kind of some longer tail markets, but there's some in the physical commodity space projects there that have traction. But we're seeing real, there's been actual progress recently, which is encouraging because, I mean, this is obviously something people have talked about since 2017, like, let's tokenize real estate and then trade it on chain. And it hasn't worked. And so part of the question was like, well, why didn't it work? People have been trying these experiments for a long time, and I think it was lack of infrastructure. Fire blocks and Anchorage were founded in 2018. Coinbase custody was found in 20.
01:06:48.374 - 01:07:46.174, Speaker B: These products didn't exist until recently. I think there was a scalability issue. I think there was perceived smart contract risk premium, but there were all these issues. And a lot of those things have been kind of solved at this point. And so I'm paying very close attention to those markets because I think that if we have tokenized real world assets that are trading on permissioned smart contracts, that is a very real use case that regulators are going to, I think, take a lot less issue with because it's basically using blockchain as rails to facilitate normal capital markets activity. So you kind of have seen this KKR tokenized an LP stake in one of their private equity funds on avalanche. You have some big institutions doing something similar on a permissioned lending protocol called CredX.
01:07:46.174 - 01:08:05.214, Speaker B: And I think a lot of these things are kind of gradually, then suddenly in terms of their kind of adoption profile. And so that is, to me, is a big area of lift off that we're probably one of the biggest areas that we're focused on.
01:08:05.674 - 01:08:46.973, Speaker C: Yeah, I want to kind of close this great episode on just historical perspectives because you've been around for space. I want to do a quick fire round questions. But before there may be the more important question. What has been, like, the biggest learnings for you over the last, you know, twelve months of crazy timeline that, you know, every. Jason, I used to joke, because every time we'd say couldn't get worse, it just got worse. And I'm curious, like you've been through many cycles, not just in crypto and. Yeah, what is the things that you look back on and say, yeah, I think this is like the biggest, like takeaways or lessons or you know, things that you've learned over the last twelve months.
01:08:48.444 - 01:08:51.904, Speaker B: Yeah, I think there's. How long do we have?
01:08:54.724 - 01:08:59.744, Speaker C: This is an hour therapy session transitioning to more wellness episode guys. So yeah.
01:09:02.844 - 01:10:24.774, Speaker B: We know it's, we did this like very long kind of internal reflection on all the mistakes we've made over the past years and kind of tried to like group them into themes or buckets. The I'll kind of rattle off just a couple. I think one is partnering with, you want to partner with good, really good people, good founders, and there's no idea can be, is too great if the person leading it is not like ethical or is not really fundamentally aligned with what they're building. I think there's a lot of mercenary, there were a lot of mercenary founders that raised capital in this prior cycle that launched a token, launched a network, didn't really care about the blockchain space and have dumped their tokens or quiet quit. And we want to generally the lesson has been like partner with missionaries, not mercenaries and people that are aligned with really building valuable products in the space and thinking long term. Yeah, that's a huge thing. I think the other is incentive alignment.
01:10:24.774 - 01:10:46.574, Speaker B: A lot of teams had very short vesting schedules. The token price went up. They maybe didn't need a token. They launched it too early. They got distracted by their paper wealth. They maybe monetize some of that. Maybe they're not incentivized to continue to work on building.
01:10:46.574 - 01:12:04.144, Speaker B: And that's why there is something, if you think about capitalism and a lot of the biggest companies, a lot of the value that's been created in the world today, it's early stage venture capitalists partnering with founders and both groups are kind of illiquid, locked in for 1015 years. And then there's an IPO and then that, you know, the founders can maybe take a little bit of chips off the table in an IPO, but there's also regulation around how much they can sell. So there's just this like very long term incentive alignment and there's too much short termism in crypto. And so, you know, again, like these are things that, you know, maybe we, we learn the hard way. The only, the third one I would mention, I mean there are probably like 1520 things I could mention, but the third one I would say is the certainly like great ideas without killer execution are just completely worthless. And there were some amazing technology that just never got monetized or was never really, I think, explored to its full potential in this past cycle. So maybe 2nd, 3rd movers in this next cycle will be able to pick up where those other teams left off.
01:12:04.144 - 01:12:14.584, Speaker B: I don't know. Those are three. I know we have a shelf life on this podcast, but there are a lot of others. Those are my probably three top of mind ones.
01:12:15.884 - 01:12:47.660, Speaker C: Those are really good ones. I would definitely agree. The last point you make is a really good one, which is sometimes I think my best investments have been second or third iterations of a particular idea. And I think we're in that environment where a lot of people, it's like we'll be non consensus to invest in another exchange or another trading desk. Like Genesis. These businesses were cash generative, super profitable, viable businesses with real traction. But people confuse and conflate two things.
01:12:47.660 - 01:13:26.736, Speaker C: It's like, don't confuse terrible management with. It's not like banks are not a viable business model because Silicon Valley went out of business. It was just like they just, there was a specific human error there on the execution side. And I generally think there's going to be really good opportunities. And the same is true, like the. I don't think people properly are equipped on this nonlinearity concept of understanding how quickly the infrastructure is developing in crypto. It took forever for Ethereum to transition to proof of stake, but the progress that has happened since then, beacon chain, the merge and then account abstraction, all of those changes have vast and deep implications for how apps are developed.
01:13:26.736 - 01:14:15.860, Speaker C: The user experience that I think people, if you're not really close to the metal, it's hard to appreciate. But I think a lot of we're in that state of the market where even investors and people generally are very skeptical of this technology yet again, but don't have a definer appreciation for how, how a good idea can work because the infrastructure has changed. And I think that's very much true in an l two context with account abstraction, like these things plug together. Ethereum is working very well and I think just people don't give it enough credit because in six months it has changed in a very meaningful, concrete manner. And so, but you're always going to have the skeptics of like, this is bullshit technology, like, just honestly go invest in AI and like, you know, call it a day and, you know, just. But, you know, nonetheless.
01:14:15.932 - 01:14:36.344, Speaker B: Um, yeah, no, I think that's right. I mean, I think that's spot on. Like people don't always diagnose like the why. Like why did an idea fail? Sometimes due to timing it was too early, the infrastructure wasn't there and, and sometimes it's lack of execution. But oftentimes the idea itself is like has a lot of merit. So I think that's, you know, I think that's spot on.
01:14:36.924 - 01:14:46.660, Speaker C: You read my mind because I want to go in a quick fire round. And the first question is do you think that will an algorithmic stablecoin will come to market and be successful over.
01:14:46.692 - 01:14:48.584, Speaker B: A long enough time scale? Yes.
01:14:50.004 - 01:14:54.572, Speaker C: Interesting. How many hours? Okay, you want to say some more?
01:14:54.668 - 01:15:09.344, Speaker B: I want to, I want to ask a clarification question. So when we say algorithmic stable, I think also how do we define algorithmic stablecoins with something like Dai or LUsd or fracs I guess be considered algorithmic or kind of over collateralized.
01:15:10.304 - 01:15:24.604, Speaker C: Good question. I guess Frax is like, I would say hybrid, like collateral, like it's so collateralized but it's like less collateral over time I guess. Senior rich model. Yeah there's, but like some of like, I guess more concretely like a terra, like fully algorithmic like game theory.
01:15:25.984 - 01:15:27.240, Speaker B: I think that's tough.
01:15:27.392 - 01:15:29.184, Speaker C: Yeah, some collateral is what you're saying.
01:15:29.224 - 01:15:43.594, Speaker B: But some, some collateral or certainly over collateralized stable coins I think are, you know, that are not backed by dollars in a bank account. I see those working. I mean Dai is a great case studies.
01:15:44.054 - 01:16:00.274, Speaker C: Good point. Second point, do you think the US loses its reserve status in a week where you've seen trades and commodity markets being now settled in different other types of currencies, China trading with Saudi Arabia and whatnot, and if it happens in what timescale.
01:16:03.594 - 01:17:08.268, Speaker B: I do think that. Well look, I think it will eventually happen on what timescale, it's tough to say. But I mean if you look at the budget deficits our country is running, if you look at our national debt and debt to GDP, which is kind of 110 120% and growing every year. If you look at our Social Security and Medicare liabilities and the demographic trends in the US, it is mathematically very difficult to grow or tax your way out of this hole. And so then Im off wondering well if there is a shift to another global reserve currency, what does that look like? How quickly does it happen? The US is still probably better than then the euro, the yen, the renminbi. So what like you know, could it be gold, could it be bitcoin? I don't, you know, I think those are probably the, I mean I think those are the best. Best.
01:17:08.268 - 01:17:19.224, Speaker B: I think bitcoin is probably the best option. But how, what that looks like is not clear. I would say, yeah, in the next 20 years, I could see it, could see that. Could see it happening.
01:17:20.144 - 01:17:26.564, Speaker C: Yeah, you have a blank slate. $100, how much you allocate the bitcoin and ETH and what ratio.
01:17:30.424 - 01:17:30.856, Speaker B: I need.
01:17:30.880 - 01:17:32.768, Speaker C: To hold for, like, okay, if you.
01:17:32.776 - 01:18:15.290, Speaker B: Have to hold for. Yeah, holding for constant for ten years. I think it has to be something that looks close to an equal weighting between bitcoin and ETH. I think they're very different and they can both be successful independent of one another. But whether it's 40 60 or 60 40, I think from, in my mind, they're equal weighting and they're both, I think, incredibly attractive right now relative to the underlying kind of fundamentals behind both of them. I mean, especially if I can stake my ETH over the next ten years, because staked ETH is trading at a 20 times earnings ratio roughly as I'm looking at it. Yeah, look, probably 50 50.
01:18:15.290 - 01:18:22.934, Speaker B: I think it's tough to say one's definitively better or worse than the other in today's market.
01:18:23.834 - 01:18:36.534, Speaker C: Yeah. What do you think we see first crypto is sitting at 1.221.2 trillion market cap with this five 6% inflation. What do you think we see 1st 500 billion or 10 trillion?
01:18:37.114 - 01:18:40.254, Speaker B: 10 trillion. Nice.
01:18:40.334 - 01:18:45.834, Speaker C: And what's the ratio of the market cap, the bitcoin dominance in that scenario?
01:18:50.094 - 01:19:01.654, Speaker B: I think it's probably in the 30% to 40% range. I also think a big chunk of that will, a big chunk of the market, if we get to that point, will just be tokenized real world assets.
01:19:01.694 - 01:19:04.314, Speaker C: Real world assets, including perhaps a centralized.
01:19:04.914 - 01:19:15.734, Speaker B: Like a CBDC, maybe a CBDC, I think, or just expansion of existing fiat backed stable coins or decentralized stable coins.
01:19:16.594 - 01:19:24.414, Speaker C: Nice. Last two questions. Jason, if you want to ask more, jump in, please. How many hours of sleep do you get? And that's less or more than in the last twelve months?
01:19:26.034 - 01:19:42.710, Speaker B: I've been trying to improve my sleep hygiene a lot. So it's been a major 2023 focus I aim for for 8 hours a night. But I still have a bad habit of like, checking my, checking crypto prices right when I wake up, right before I go to bed.
01:19:42.742 - 01:19:52.278, Speaker C: Yeah. So you know what I started to do? As you know, I'm a terrible sleeper. I started to put my phone in a different room. Thank you, Jason. I think I got this from you. It's.
01:19:52.326 - 01:19:53.554, Speaker A: I've been doing that for years.
01:19:54.174 - 01:20:08.830, Speaker C: Honestly, the best small thing like that, like, when I do this, like, I've a b test. Not a b test, but I don't. Simulation parallel universe. But nights that I put my phone another room, I'll just sleep better. This is not advice. Legal.
01:20:08.862 - 01:20:11.894, Speaker B: What about. What about your alarm? Do you have, like, a man?
01:20:11.934 - 01:20:18.502, Speaker A: I don't. I also suck with snoozing. I'll just, like, hit my phone so when it's in the other room, it forces me to get out of bed and go.
01:20:18.558 - 01:20:18.966, Speaker C: Right?
01:20:19.070 - 01:20:22.990, Speaker A: And go. Then I just turn my alarm off, get in the shower, and get started with the day.
01:20:23.022 - 01:20:23.190, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:20:23.222 - 01:20:23.526, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:20:23.590 - 01:20:33.484, Speaker C: This is a hack. This is the heck. And then perhaps last question for me is, what would you tell a younger Ben that is getting started in crypto?
01:20:36.624 - 01:21:28.892, Speaker B: I would say that as you think about investing in the space, be very cognizant of what you know and what you don't know, and don't convince yourself you know something that you don't actually know. So, in other words, I think being aware of blind spots in the space is important. So even when you have very high conviction on. On an opportunity, I think kind of position sizing is important because it shows humility that, hey, you could be wrong on this. So, specifically, I think there are some things. I've been very confident in investment theses over the years that maybe turned out okay, but not nearly where I thought they would be. And so I think it kind of comes down to, like, sizing positions in a more humble manner, where you have more diversity, because you're going to get a lot of things wrong in this space.
01:21:28.892 - 01:21:32.988, Speaker B: That's one of many pieces of advice I would have for my.
01:21:33.036 - 01:22:01.664, Speaker C: Used to always say internally a paraphy, that thesis is half the battle. Position sizing is equally important. People don't spend nearly enough time thinking about position sizing and calibrating that over time. I'll cheat. I said the last one, but I'll follow up because this is a great answer. Is what is something that you've changed your mind recently? You or as a team, as a firm, but maybe specifically just you. Because, by the way, to listeners, none of the stuff that Ben says actually represents the views of parafy.
01:22:01.664 - 01:22:09.984, Speaker C: And I will say this because, Mike, when I was there, I used to have to say this all the time, so I'll just spare Ben of saying this, but nonetheless, go for it.
01:22:10.024 - 01:23:27.674, Speaker B: Yeah, I. So I think one of the things that's changed kind of gradually over the past year, this is maybe not a totally popular viewpoint, but I think a lot of the just permissionless defi infrastructure or a lot of the best projects and protocols that have had amazing runs over the past few years, like, may struggle just to scale and fit into a world that are regulated. And so I love the idea. Like, I think that space will be around for a long time and will probably net grow. But as I think about what's best for the industry and how important regulation is, I'd love to see. And you're kind of seeing it with some of these teams, like, building out ways for institutions to actually use their products is important. I guess, to be concrete, what's changed is maybe my estimate of the tam, of the permissionless defi market.
01:23:27.674 - 01:23:36.194, Speaker B: I still think it's a lot bigger than it is today, but I think we need to go after the permission side as well.
01:23:36.774 - 01:23:48.994, Speaker C: Yeah. Yeah, definitely. Well, it's been awesome, man. Always a pleasure having you on, and I don't know if there's anything else you want to cover, but this is all I had, so it's been a great discussion and all things that we wanted to cover.
01:23:49.414 - 01:23:55.950, Speaker B: No, thanks so much for. For having me on. It's always humbling to be here, so really, really appreciate it, even.
01:23:55.982 - 01:24:02.234, Speaker C: All the better when you. When you don't share stories that embarrass me. You know, last time you shared one of my Harry Potter Lego collections, so this time we've been spared.
01:24:03.524 - 01:24:05.676, Speaker A: Been coming to a blockworks events for Ben.
01:24:05.700 - 01:24:05.908, Speaker B: How?
01:24:05.956 - 01:24:07.596, Speaker A: I think you're at one of the first ones.
01:24:07.700 - 01:24:16.508, Speaker B: Yeah, one of the first das events in like 2018. 2019. When it was like 40 or when it was like 100 people. Now it's whatever. Thousand.
01:24:16.596 - 01:24:22.868, Speaker C: So this is a rhetorical question because this is where Jason plugs get your tickets for permissionless buy.
01:24:22.916 - 01:24:26.304, Speaker A: Now. Are you speaking this year?
01:24:27.724 - 01:24:28.804, Speaker B: What was that?
01:24:28.924 - 01:24:30.224, Speaker A: Are you speaking this year?
01:24:30.874 - 01:24:31.858, Speaker B: Yeah, I think I am.
01:24:31.906 - 01:24:32.602, Speaker A: I think.
01:24:32.778 - 01:24:33.090, Speaker B: Good.
01:24:33.122 - 01:24:34.294, Speaker A: So we got to speak.
01:24:36.034 - 01:24:45.626, Speaker C: By the way, bet Jason tried me to ask me to buy tickets. I'm like, since when do speakers get to buy tickets for conferences? Jesus Christ. We're definitely buying.
01:24:45.650 - 01:24:51.346, Speaker A: You know. You know what speakers have to buy tickets for conferences is speakers who say they're going to speak one year and then. And then bail last minute.
01:24:51.370 - 01:24:53.454, Speaker C: So rob by airlines. But.
01:24:55.234 - 01:25:03.706, Speaker A: This is awesome. And you're. You're always welcome to come on the show, and it's been a great chat and fun to see you in Santi banter as well. And, yeah, man, this is great.
01:25:03.810 - 01:25:05.574, Speaker B: Awesome. Thanks. Thanks a lot.
01:25:06.434 - 01:25:18.654, Speaker C: I would tell people. I would tell people to go follow Ben on Twitter. But Ben doesn't have a formal. He's probably the only person in crypto that doesn't have a Twitter account that we know of. Maybe one day he'll tell us what his alt account is. Maybe Deeton Spartan. Who knows? Maybe.
01:25:19.234 - 01:25:20.074, Speaker A: Cheers, guys.
01:25:20.194 - 01:25:22.234, Speaker B: You can email me or send me snail mail.
