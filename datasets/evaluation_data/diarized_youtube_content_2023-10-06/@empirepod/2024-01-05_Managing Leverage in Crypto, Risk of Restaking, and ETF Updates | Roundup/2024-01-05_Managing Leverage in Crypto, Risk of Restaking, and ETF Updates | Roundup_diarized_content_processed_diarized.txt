00:00:00.160 - 00:00:22.554, Speaker A: All right, everyone, so on Empire, you obviously know that we talk a lot about the institutions coming into crypto, and that is why we are super excited to share that we are hosting the digital asset summit. We posted this since 2019. It's coming up in London, March 18 to 20th. Don't miss your chance to get ahead of the curve. You can get 20% off with code. Empire 20. We'll see you in London.
00:00:22.554 - 00:00:32.934, Speaker A: All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Empire, first roundup of the year. What are we talking about today? Santi, how we doing?
00:00:33.394 - 00:00:40.282, Speaker B: Doing great. You know, we had our first reminder that crypto is not up. Only so good.
00:00:40.298 - 00:00:41.306, Speaker A: Little reminder.
00:00:41.490 - 00:00:53.650, Speaker B: Yeah, you know, I'd rather start the year that way. You know, letting people say, like, yes, it sounds starting to look like good year, but, you know, you know, it will keep the DJ spirits in check, I think.
00:00:53.682 - 00:00:55.734, Speaker A: So how's the new year's?
00:00:56.584 - 00:01:02.484, Speaker B: Uneventful. I went to bed at like, eleven or so. I was wiped. I had run so much because I'm training for Tokyo, so.
00:01:03.344 - 00:01:04.844, Speaker A: When's Tokyo?
00:01:05.184 - 00:01:06.328, Speaker B: First week of March.
00:01:06.496 - 00:01:07.248, Speaker A: Nice.
00:01:07.416 - 00:01:11.204, Speaker B: Yes. So just running a lot these days and years.
00:01:11.664 - 00:01:20.964, Speaker A: It was good. You know, I had to cancel my. I was supposed to go on this two week trip to Patagonia, but had some. Some health stuff, so had to. Had to cancel that, so went upstairs.
00:01:21.714 - 00:01:25.330, Speaker B: I'm not. I've got barely any sleep. But you're looking fresh.
00:01:25.442 - 00:01:39.018, Speaker A: Got a meeting with a. With a big trad. This is about as nice as I will allow myself to dress up. You know, they're all gonna be in suit and tie today. Like, walk into this room. I'm sure it's gonna be like ten guys, suit and tie. Like, oh, yeah, this is about as nice as I will dress.
00:01:39.066 - 00:01:58.338, Speaker B: You walk around Berkeley in a suit and tie, people look at you like, you know, my first crypto conference, I was coming, like, straight from work, and I was at JP Morgan at the time. Of course I took off the tie, but I still had the suit, you know, and people looked at me in the bitcoin center in New York and so, yeah, and they're like, you must have gone the wrong door, like, deep.
00:01:58.426 - 00:02:06.894, Speaker A: Yeah, I had the same thing in 2017, going to these bitcoin meetups straight from work, like, yeah, you know, rocking the tie, rocking the suit.
00:02:07.874 - 00:02:13.098, Speaker B: Well, you're gonna have to wear that in Das. So I'm just saying, I don't think this setup is gonna fly.
00:02:13.186 - 00:02:23.940, Speaker A: No, I look. I look nice at Das. Get a good dapper for Das. Exactly. So you buying some nikes? The new Nike drop?
00:02:24.092 - 00:02:43.186, Speaker B: Yeah, the new alpha fly running shoes came out literally today in Europe. They came at two in the morning, so I stay up late. That's why I didn't sleep. 201 comes sold out. Then they came out right before we started this pot in the US. So I'm vp, you know, I'm trying to get it in the US too. Sold out as well, you know.
00:02:43.186 - 00:03:00.090, Speaker B: You think an NFT mint is hard? Buying hot Nike sneakers is much harder. Folks, I've been dealing with this prom for a while, so I've become better at. For me, you know, minting NFTs is not hard. What is hard is trying to find these shoes. So I didn't get it.
00:03:00.282 - 00:03:05.258, Speaker A: You didn't get them? So now you what, now you'll just five x them on Stockx?
00:03:05.426 - 00:03:12.870, Speaker B: Probably. I'll be the idiot. I was the first listed. Plus my size is also like the one that they know. They rip you off. So.
00:03:12.982 - 00:03:23.854, Speaker A: Yeah. All right, man. So let's. A couple things I want to talk about today. ETF week. We got the ETF ahead of us. Jan 8910.
00:03:23.854 - 00:04:21.034, Speaker A: I think Jan Ten is the official deadline for both Ark and 21 shares. So let's talk UTF. Maybe we can kick it off with market nuking, just get your take on that, and then we can talk about this tax thing that went into effect January 1 and then maybe we can cover. Visa had a cool little crypto announcement that I think went under the radar, but was pretty cool to see them follow up on something that they shared that they would do two years ago. So first things first, market nuking. So basically a matrix port report claiming that the SEC would reject a spot bitcoin ETF causation correlation, whatever it is, but it kind of proceeded in an eight to ten, I think it was 8%, maybe 10% drop in bitcoin. So bitcoin fell from, think it was sitting around 45, fell down to what? It was sitting at 45 three, and fell all the way down to 40.
00:04:21.034 - 00:04:56.706, Speaker A: What is that? 40? 40 and a half. So you know what, what does that drop? 8%? 10%? Um. Uh, if you haven't been following it, Bloomberg analysts and a lot of different folks put the chance of approval in the coming week around 90%. And that is one of the reasons this, you know, bitcoins kind of run up in the past few months. But this guy, Marcus Thielen, the head of research for Matrixport, said that he believes all applications are going to fall short of a critical requirement. And he added that SEC chairman Gary Gensler still sees the industry in need of more stringent compliance. He also doubled down.
00:04:56.706 - 00:05:31.426, Speaker A: He said, from a political perspective, there's no reason to approve a bitcoin spot ETF that would legitimize bitcoin as an alternative store of value. Um, and uh, this guy Eric Balconis over, over at Bloomberg said without any sourcing, this report does not line up with the Bloomberg intelligence, uh, reporting that we've done. He said, I'm not saying it's impossible, but it would overturn a lot. Um, however, if Marcus has done a lot, a lot of sourcing to back up the report, that's a whole different ballgame. So uh, markets already rebounded. Bitcoins up to four, almost 44. ETH is climbing today.
00:05:31.426 - 00:05:36.506, Speaker A: ETH fell from 2023 8380 down to what?
00:05:36.650 - 00:05:38.810, Speaker B: 21 95?
00:05:38.962 - 00:05:49.674, Speaker A: Yeah, 2100 rebounding already to 22 70, the time of recording. So things came back up, but a good amount of wiped out.
00:05:49.834 - 00:06:00.262, Speaker B: Solana dropped from Solana was the most dramatic one. I think it dropped from like 107, 109 to 85. That was a 27% drop to now up to 102.
00:06:00.398 - 00:06:31.422, Speaker A: So here's an interesting one, let me read the biggest seven day losers. It's bitcoin cash ETH classic pancake swap, terra Classic FTT, the FTX token. Right. So no surprises there. Then there's matic. Matic is this group like it's flow token, litecoin, ETH, Cc, all these things that like don't really matter and then there's matic in there. So anyways we can, we can, I thought that was a little side interesting point.
00:06:31.478 - 00:06:38.246, Speaker B: But yeah, there's ones that actually didn't really fall much like arbitrum hit all time high.
00:06:38.430 - 00:06:40.750, Speaker A: Yeah the l two s are having a nice little run.
00:06:40.862 - 00:07:43.294, Speaker B: Yeah, we can talk about things that are performing well, but not really surprised. Well, I guess we can talk about why a seemingly irrelevant analyst interned report had this cascading effect in the market speculation. Bot, I think a lot of it is bot driven. Theres a lot of, I would gather that and I saw some commentary around this. So I think that over the last couple of years, like the market, like traditional markets, has become more bot driven. I wouldnt say its certainly not to the extent like equities, but there is a certain amount of bot activity in crypto and so that could have led to the start of some selling component and then in and of itself it shouldn't have this dramatic effect. Of course, when you pair that with everyone's lever to the tits, then yes, you're going to have.
00:07:43.294 - 00:08:14.674, Speaker B: Going to have a cascading effect of liquidations, and then you clean all that leverage off. Funding rates are getting pretty out of hand. And so there's. I always like to monitor funding rates just to understand and open interest to understand how much leverage is in the system. And kind of systematically, even if you go back to prior cycles, like every time funding rates get really hot, it's sort of a ticking time bomb. It's at some point in days you're going to have a cleanse.
00:08:17.014 - 00:08:22.278, Speaker A: Can you explain that, Santi, why funding rates are so important? And what is the funding rate, basically?
00:08:22.366 - 00:09:31.986, Speaker B: Well, everyone calculates it differently, which is a bit hard, right. When you're looking at funding rates across centralized exchanges and decentralized perps, they all kind of have their own methodology, but basically, and we had an episode about this, but the funding rate means how much longs, or how much, like, if you're going long a particular coin on perp, it's how much you're paying the other side. And so when, think about in a market, in a very balanced market, where there's a 50% short, 50% long, this funding rates are very neutral, but when there's a. A skew towards, like, a disproportionate share of the market is either long or short, that's when funding rates start getting out of whack. And so, on an annualized basis. Yeah, you're looking at the chart here now, which is a good visual kind of heat map representation. So, for instance, when you saw the run up of soul all the way to one, like, 23 on Christmas, there's a fair amount of, you know.
00:09:31.986 - 00:09:46.594, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. Or bonk, for instance, or, you know, I'm picking on two. But you could look at objective, like, some of these hot, like, I guess, narratives and coins basically means, like, you know, you're.
00:09:46.634 - 00:09:47.294, Speaker A: You're.
00:09:48.874 - 00:10:06.670, Speaker B: You're paying an enormous amount of money to express that view. And so at some point, that is. That corrects itself. It's like, it's no different than you're farming at a 10,000% apy that ultimately corrects itself. Right. I don't know if that makes sense.
00:10:06.782 - 00:10:10.914, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. It's the price you're paying to.
00:10:11.294 - 00:10:38.340, Speaker B: It's from an exchange perspective, it is the mechanism that they use to keep these books balanced. Right. And the more people want to. In a scenario where 99 people, like, are going long and only 1% is going short, the funding rate gets so out of hand to compensate that imbalance and to bring it back to normalcy. And so that's the mechanism by which you keep it in check.
00:10:38.452 - 00:10:58.004, Speaker A: Yeah, it's the difference between the. I think I have this right. It's the difference between the perps, the futures. The perps futures price and the index price. Right. Yeah, exactly. Which equates to how much you are willing to go to, basically not borrow in a sense, but pay to be long.
00:10:58.424 - 00:11:13.484, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. Like contango, which factors in, like, storage costs and whatnot. But because these are digital assets, like, it's really just the cost of holding the contract and the set spread between the contract and the underlying price.
00:11:14.744 - 00:11:30.694, Speaker A: Let me ask you about leverage, Santi. So do you. It's always crazy to me that people are so levered up and get completely wiped on these moves. Like, when a day like this happens, click the buy button a little harder than I do in the past. Right. Like, it's a. It's always a good buying opportunity.
00:11:30.694 - 00:11:56.084, Speaker A: Uh, but you see on twitter, so many folks get wiped out. They're like, oh, man, I lost my stack, or whatever it may be. So it's always shocking to me that people are still so levered up to the nines. And, uh, in crypto, what. What is your take on leverage? And how. When do you use leverage? When do you not. Do you use leverage in the traditional way of just, like, you know, being five x levered or ten x levered? Or do you lever long and you maybe buying nfts instead of the spot or whatever it is? Like, how do you think about leverage?
00:11:58.104 - 00:12:23.732, Speaker B: I've used it in the past. I don't have any leverage today. I haven't used it in the last. Basically, since 2021, I have not put on leverage. I'm just very comfortable sitting on spot. And it's just more of a lifestyle, less lifestyle. It's just more of when you're sleeping at night.
00:12:23.732 - 00:12:56.596, Speaker B: And unless you have someone or you have an algo that is going to be monitoring these things, it is very stressful. Like, you just should be prepared for any asset, including bitcoin, to go down 10% on moments notice. And these are violent moves, and so you're sleeping at during that time. You can't adjust your position. So, like, funny story in March. What is it? During COVID I was still at paraphy, and, you know, it was percolating. The code was a thing.
00:12:56.596 - 00:13:22.122, Speaker B: And it was that Thursday where it was an actor. I think it was Mel Gibson that got COVID that night, and a few athletes had gotten it. I called Ben. I said, ben, I think this is going to be real. I think it's going to be a pandemic and think, go get ugly. I wake up before in the morning because I was giving a class at NYU and I was in San Francisco, so it was like super early. I go walk to buy coffee, or I think there was a Starbucks open at five in the morning or something.
00:13:22.122 - 00:14:07.844, Speaker B: I look at the prices and everything's down and I'm like, my caffeine situation is getting out of hand. I can't even read a screen. And it took me a while to process it, but I had some leverage on DyDX and had some positions on levered ETH just going long, all wiped. And the issue, there was a lot of times during these violent movements, you stress test the system. So the oracle start maybe failing and the liquidation engines start failing. In the case of March 2020, maker didn't have a good keeper liquidator system and so that added more fuel to the fire. I think this is why you see these violent movements.
00:14:07.844 - 00:14:23.884, Speaker B: You could argue we're going to continue to see, even in every cycle in a bull market, you're going to see 1020 percent drawdowns of these assets. Why play with fire? And why you can't even be lucky if you're dead.
00:14:25.944 - 00:14:51.236, Speaker A: Look, the difference between c five and Defi and traditional capital markets is when there's a. You know, the best thing about Defi is it's all automatic. Right? It all. It's all automated and you can see everything on chain. The downside is if you get a margin call in traditional capital markets, your banker, your broker will call you up and be like, Santi, look, you're below the limit. And you can say, look, this is happening, but I got to give me 24 hours.
00:14:51.300 - 00:14:54.348, Speaker B: I'll add it back 24 hours to refill.
00:14:54.436 - 00:15:01.064, Speaker A: Yeah. In Defi, you wake up and it's been liquidated. There's no call happening. There's no email even. Right?
00:15:01.974 - 00:16:21.350, Speaker B: It's funny you say that, because I've been talking, like, after that incident, I talked to a lot of Defi founders and I said, why don't you build that type of system where imagine you have an open position in maker or AavE, you have the option to pay a slight premium, an ongoing premium as an insurance policy, whereby if there's a liquidation event happening. This is especially important for NFTs where you don't want to lose the NFT. You have more of an attachment where you have, like, if it gets put in escrow and there's a time block to that liquidation. And you have that ability, like 6 hours, 12 hours, but you can pay how much. And I think that type of system would be very useful because in my conversations with funds, a lot of times they don't want to use DeFi because of this, because they don't get call. And so I think you can build something on chain that would mimic this type of mechanism and the keepers would be happy and the protocol would be happy because that increases the fees of the protocol, right. Because in a normal situation, you're just accruing more fees, and in volatile moments, someone's getting paid to, you're paying to have that optionality.
00:16:21.350 - 00:16:22.958, Speaker B: And so I don't know. I don't know why someone hasn't.
00:16:23.006 - 00:16:59.152, Speaker A: I like that idea. I think the other thing that'll happen this year, I think it's infinix is doing this, and some other places are going to start doing it as tying, if you want, if you opt into it, tying emails into your wallet so that you sign up with your wallet, obviously, but then you can put in your email, and then what that does is it gives you the ability to, if there's a margin call or something, maybe they'll email you and say, hey, look, you're at 50%. At 40%, we're going to start calling some assets. So 50%, maybe you'll get a notice email or something like that. Right now there's no way to get notified.
00:16:59.328 - 00:17:01.324, Speaker B: Let me ask you a question. Do you use leverage?
00:17:01.784 - 00:17:40.580, Speaker A: I don't. Because first off, what we're talking about here is just zoom out for a second. Traditional investors are excited about in the market right now. In treasuries, you can get what, five or six or 7% maybe if you're pushing out into some, you know, corporate credit or something, equities, you're excited about what, 8% a year, 9%, 10%? You're doing awesome. Maybe, yeah, 15 if you're in some good funds or something. What we're talking about is, like, my belief is that bitcoin neath go up two to three x this year. And my belief is that things like sol go up, you know, five, five x or even more than that.
00:17:40.580 - 00:18:06.894, Speaker A: So I think when you zoom out and you're like, okay, I'm talking about something going up 400% versus traditional markets, they get excited about going up 8%. Like, I don't need to get greedy. I don't, I don't need to get greedy about that. I also had, I levered up. I, I was a really early user of what? Uh, of coinbases. Um, you could borrow on your assets on Coinbase and, uh, played with that. And, like, it was, it was very, I mean, it was very addicting.
00:18:06.894 - 00:18:25.824, Speaker A: Like, you, it's, it's kind of like having a bad credit card habit or something. It was like, I was like, oh, I'm like, and this was 2021, so, like, all the numbers were going up and I would just, like, continue borrowing and then when and to go long and, like, it worked very well. Then in 2022, numbers start going down.
00:18:26.844 - 00:18:29.740, Speaker B: Yeah, it quickly.
00:18:29.772 - 00:18:34.844, Speaker A: I was like, and thankfully I paid it all off and it was fine. But, like, I was like, oh, man, like, this could quickly get out of hand.
00:18:34.924 - 00:19:10.934, Speaker B: So it's a great point. I did that too, as well in the bottom. Like, I borrowed from, like, American Express, took like a 20K loan to buy ETH, and then I borrowed in tradfi from, actually from my parents. And I said, look, I was like, I want to go long. And I paid them like 10% interest, like loan docs, like everything, and I gave them interest rate zero. And I said, look, I'll pay 10% collateralized by a bunch of other assets that I had. But again, on chain is quite tricky.
00:19:10.934 - 00:19:23.998, Speaker B: You're absolutely right. I mean, it's a matter of preference. I don't think a lot of people should be using leverage. You can use leverage to hedge, but the reason why most people are using leverage is because they were caught upsides. They didn't catch the first uptrend and they want to do a ten x. Yeah.
00:19:24.086 - 00:19:35.450, Speaker A: Oh, that's not true, actually. Do you want to know when I got really offsides with leverage? I just. It was 2017. Do you remember you could use credit cards to buy crypto on Coinbase? Why?
00:19:35.482 - 00:19:37.530, Speaker B: Remember, I got in normal amount of points.
00:19:37.722 - 00:19:55.146, Speaker A: I mean, I would get new cards. Oh, my God, I forgot about this. I blocked this memory off my mind. I would get new cards and basically max out the card and buy crypto. And bitcoin was running up from a 1000 to 20,000. And I was, you know, it was like the most money I'd ever. I was right out of college.
00:19:55.146 - 00:20:21.144, Speaker A: I'd never really had any money in my life. And, like, to then have money, was it insane? And I just kept doing it. And then the market turned and I got really offsides and it took me a little bit of time to pay that off. Um, I completely blanked that out of my memory. But thankfully, I actually think it's a good thing that you can't buy crypto on Coinbase or Gemini or any of these. Remember blockfi and Celsius? You could buy. You could buy crypto with credit cards on, on all of those, I think.
00:20:21.264 - 00:20:21.872, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:20:21.968 - 00:20:22.584, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:20:22.704 - 00:20:59.652, Speaker B: The only other time that it ran some leverage was when I bought some nfts and I borrowed against the base asset, thinking that is a levered bet. And so I borrowed like, say you have 100 ETH, you borrow 50 ETH or 100 ETH, or you borrow some fraction like 60 ETH or 50 ETH or whatever, and then you, you know, the tricky there is that a lot of times when the base asset runs up, so if ETH goes from 2000 to 4000, the floor might not actually move in the same manner. So you can get caught off sides. But just generally. At the time, I thought NFTs were a levered bet.
00:20:59.788 - 00:21:01.464, Speaker A: Are you still thinking about doing that?
00:21:02.644 - 00:21:40.504, Speaker B: No, I didn't. I thought it was already pretty priced in. So I was thinking of doing this trade where I would borrow against my soul and buy a bunch of tensorians as a proxy of getting exposure to growing NFT activity in the Solana ecosystem in the absence of not having equity exposure to tensorflow. I said, okay, well, maybe I can just borrow with a healthy margin. So 20% of my stack or whatever, go buy like thousands of tensorians or whatever and then just play that. But the math was such that I didn't feel that I was getting. It was a.
00:21:40.504 - 00:21:47.236, Speaker B: I think the price of tensorians kind of already reflected that trade, so I was a bit late to that. So I did not.
00:21:47.300 - 00:21:48.148, Speaker A: You didn't do that?
00:21:48.276 - 00:21:48.564, Speaker B: No.
00:21:48.604 - 00:21:50.184, Speaker A: What do you think about punks right now.
00:21:51.994 - 00:21:54.122, Speaker B: Generally about the price or just punks?
00:21:54.218 - 00:21:56.894, Speaker A: I was looking at the punks floor last night and they.
00:21:57.194 - 00:21:58.010, Speaker B: What is it?
00:21:58.122 - 00:22:06.898, Speaker A: I think they were at. They peaked at us dollar value of 400,000, I think it was. And now they're sitting around, let's call it 55.69 ETH.
00:22:06.986 - 00:22:11.254, Speaker B: So that's 125k. Yeah, yeah.
00:22:14.914 - 00:22:15.266, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:22:15.290 - 00:22:18.854, Speaker B: I mean, I don't know. It's a lot of money.
00:22:22.154 - 00:22:30.574, Speaker A: You know. All right, they peaked at 440, no, 420 in us dollars. Now they're at 123.
00:22:31.154 - 00:22:52.042, Speaker B: I believe it was on ETH terms. If you price that in ETH, I think it was 125 was the top. Yeah, there we go. I remember I literally bought one at 100. I bought like a base 115. Yeah, I bought a low trade punk, 125. At the time, ETH was, you know, it was like a hundred.
00:22:52.042 - 00:23:13.274, Speaker B: It was like 500K USD. And now I'm still holding that. So again, I didn't. And I have these punks, like, hanging in my wall. And so every time I wake up and walk, I'm like, okay, God. I remind myself of what so far been a pretty bad trade. But again, it wasn't a trade for me.
00:23:13.274 - 00:23:16.018, Speaker B: So I collect without the intent of selling.
00:23:16.146 - 00:23:20.754, Speaker A: How many punks do you have? Is that a undisclosed publicly?
00:23:20.794 - 00:23:36.964, Speaker B: Two publicly. Two undisclosed, actually. The other one, the one with a bandana, I bought for 125, and that was the top. That was, like, the top. So I have it. Maybe it's a good punk to remind myself of, like, yeah, you buy the top.
00:23:37.114 - 00:23:42.944, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. No matter how smart you are, you will top tick. I think you always will.
00:23:42.984 - 00:23:46.800, Speaker B: Top tip, you'll round trip, you'll do all these things. And welcome to crypto, Mike.
00:23:46.832 - 00:23:59.364, Speaker A: Mike's gonna get mad at me for sharing this, but I think Mike bought Coinbase stock at, like, it's not even on the chart because it's like, it was like the high of. It was like the absolute high. Not even of the day, but, like, of that minute.
00:24:00.064 - 00:24:02.520, Speaker B: Yeah, it was a satellite candle or whatever.
00:24:02.552 - 00:24:03.720, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly.
00:24:03.872 - 00:24:35.368, Speaker B: That's great. Leverage is something that is for very sophisticated people, and even sophisticated people blow up. They blow up in traditional markets, and crypto are less efficient, less robust from an infrastructure perspective. And so even though it's more battle tested, you have to just be aware that these mechanisms, funding rates may not work properly during stressful times. Yeah, don't play cute, play long game.
00:24:35.496 - 00:25:07.780, Speaker A: Yeah. There's this book, market. I think it's market wizards, where this guy Jack Schwager interviews top ten to 20 best hedge fund managers. I think it's market wizards. It might be a different one I'm thinking of. But anyways, if you read that book, they all sound super smart, brilliant investors. If you look at who's still around of these hedge fund managers, I think only one of ten or one of 15 or something is still around because every single one of their funds has blown up by getting offsides and getting too confident and too cocky.
00:25:07.892 - 00:25:23.704, Speaker B: So here's my, you know, that's such a good observation. I'll just say one last thing, and I want to, first, I want to ask you one thing. Do you get more stress, anxiety? Maybe you don't at all during a bull market or a bear market?
00:25:24.014 - 00:25:25.550, Speaker A: Bull market, for sure.
00:25:25.742 - 00:25:27.194, Speaker B: 100%. Right.
00:25:27.734 - 00:25:51.670, Speaker A: I mean, bear markets are very low stress. The only reason a bear market is stressful is a. If you don't believe in the long term price of crypto, so you're worried about the dollar value going down, which I, which I like. I have zero stress about. What was stressful was, like, I mean, blockworks got ten times harder. Like, for blockworks is going to be very hard in a bull market. It's going to be really hard to hire people.
00:25:51.670 - 00:26:19.506, Speaker A: It's a compensation is going to get completely out of whack. There's money everywhere. So we're going to start trying to chasing money. Even if you say that you won't, there's going to be a lot of money all over the place, and that's going to be tough. But block works out a lot harder in the bear just because the ad market dried up and stuff like that. But the bull market is more anxiety inducing and stressful because, um. Yeah, for.
00:26:19.506 - 00:26:23.214, Speaker A: For many different reasons. Yeah, same for you, I'm assuming.
00:26:23.634 - 00:26:44.818, Speaker B: Yeah, same, yeah. The only thing I want to say is, on this point around market wizards is, um, like, the. Some of the advice that these people are giving. If you read the book, it's like. And, uh, it's like, don't lose money. Um, rule number one. And it's like, you really can if you die.
00:26:44.818 - 00:27:00.208, Speaker B: And so I think it's just, it's funny that at some point, greed gets into the equation, and these people just. It's easy to put on leverage. And at the time, you think that you're going to structure it better than most, but it's not.
00:27:00.256 - 00:27:14.534, Speaker A: Yeah. I feel similarly about leverage, as I do with trading, by the way, too. There's all these people that were trying to trade through the bear market. You want to know who made more money? People who just, like, held bitcoin. Ethan Solana.
00:27:15.394 - 00:27:17.458, Speaker B: Yeah, right. Yeah.
00:27:17.546 - 00:27:33.914, Speaker A: That's why I think it's foolish to try to trade in and out of all this stuff. Like, yeah, you're going to, like, trade this arbitrum run up. Like, I just sit on Arb for the whole bull market and, like, you'll probably do better if you're. Then if you're trying to, like, flip from Arv into Celestia back into, you know, Jito, like, just sit.
00:27:34.074 - 00:27:45.604, Speaker B: At some point, people have asked for it, but I'm happy to do an episode of all the mistakes I've done documenting, because I've documented most of all the mistakes I've done in crypto.
00:27:47.344 - 00:28:13.380, Speaker A: Yeah, let's do it. All right, everyone. So we talk a lot about the institutions coming into crypto on empire. Santi and I are both headed out to London March 18 to 20th for blockworks. 8th Ever Digital Asset Summit Das this is an institutional buttoned up conference that we've hosted since 2019. I like to joke that it is probably the last remaining kind of suit and tie event in crypto. People are still wearing suit and tie.
00:28:13.380 - 00:28:48.096, Speaker A: It's pretty funny, but you'll actually hear from a lot of the largest institutions in the world coming from Standard, Charter, FIS, JPMorgan framework folks coming out. Wintermute Vanek Goldman Sachs there are a couple big themes of this conference. One, bitcoin catalysts, the halving and the spot ETF. Two, a view from the buy side. Three, RWA tokenization and stable coins for global regulatory frameworks. Five, institutional infrastructure, including banking and payments and six, the macro case for crypto. If you have anything to do with the institutional side of crypto, you have to be there.
00:28:48.096 - 00:29:06.884, Speaker A: Santi and I got your back. We hooked you up with a 20% off code. It is Empire 20. There is a little competition running internally at blockworks to see who can drive the most number of tickets. So help Santi and I out register with our code and you get 20% off. That is Empire 20. All right, let's give a little update on the ETF.
00:29:06.884 - 00:30:08.208, Speaker A: So here's, here's what's going on. So basically, January 10 is the Ark deadline, and I think the 21 shares deadline. Last week, this guy Eric Balconis at Bloomberg said that the SEC is ready to approve spot bitcoin ETF's, but only if they have clear language around cash only creations and have a signed agreement with an authorized participant. There is this scenario where if Ark were to withdraw at the SEC's request, and Ark is the first one in this long list of folks who have filed, if Ark were to withdraw the SEC's request, then the next deadline is March. However, Balconis, who's speaking at das and has been on some of the other blockworks pods recently, he thinks that this delay situation is a long shot. I think the idea here is that if you, aka the SEC, if the SEC intends to deny, they would have just denied at this point instead of just kind of like floating around. So there are two, there are two things that I thought were interesting with the ETF.
00:30:08.208 - 00:30:48.374, Speaker A: One is authorized participants and the other is fees. So the first was a lot of people are talking about who is the issuer of the ETF. Is it a Blackrock ETF? Is it a fidelity ETF? Is it a bitwise ETF? I think the authorized participants are also really interesting to look at. So AP's are the entities that create and redeem shares of an ETF. And typically shares can be exchanged for a similar basket of securities that reflect the holdings of the ETF or obviously for cash. Goldman is the big Goldman just got into the game. Goldman's in talks to become an authorized participant for both the grayscale and the Blackrock ETF's.
00:30:48.374 - 00:31:36.344, Speaker A: What that means is they would be responsible for the creation and the redemption of of ETF shares. Some other ones are fidelity named Jane street and JPMorgan as its AP's blackrock named also Jane street and Jane street and JPMorgan as AP's Valkyrie Tap Jane street and Kenner Fitzgerald Wisdom tree also named Jane street. Who else invesco is using JPMorgan and Virtu? Grayscale hasn't been announced, but I think the AP's are going to be Jane street and Virtuoso. So there's kind of this, like there's the issuers of the ETF and the creators of the ETF. Then there's this group of like five to six folks, right? Goldman, Jane Street, JPMorgan, Canner, Virtu, who are emerging as like the go to AP's for these ETF's. And I thought it's an interesting list to look at.
00:31:36.464 - 00:32:30.584, Speaker B: I mean, it's like everyone, right? Andrew Kang had a good post about this, actually, and I certainly believe it, which is when you think of it like this is every so many years, Wall street gets an opportunity to sell an entirely novel new thing. And to assume that, like, like, it's just, I'm not sure people realize that the, the way kind of the Wall street machine works, right, and go watch like boiler room or, you know, there is a very big incentive for, I mean, these people get paid on commission. Like, I'm not saying this is not a product that they should sell. I mean, obviously we believe in it and whatnot, but it is. The fees are likely higher for these ETF's. It's like a new product. And so probably relative to your traditional vanilla ETF.
00:32:30.584 - 00:33:19.436, Speaker B: So Wall street is a very commoditized business, especially selling securities. And so at the end of the day, this is another fee stream for them and it will be an important one. So it almost becomes, I think if you understand that, then you kind of see how you believe in a world where one, everyone, every bank is going to be a participant, everyone that has an ETF type of line of business, whether it was an AP or just like wealth management kind of division, because probably the commissions are going to be higher and you're going off of a base of zero. And so it's a new product you're selling. And so I think that Andrew has a good post. We should link to it. But understanding kind of that mechanism is, no pun intended, I guess, as fund is mechanism capital.
00:33:19.436 - 00:33:21.300, Speaker B: But it's interesting.
00:33:21.412 - 00:33:25.704, Speaker A: Yeah, we should have Andrew on the pod. That'd be a fun one. Yeah, I agree with that.
00:33:27.324 - 00:33:36.108, Speaker B: The few products that exist today have a pretty high fee, right? Like higher than your typical.
00:33:36.156 - 00:34:04.258, Speaker A: Yeah, they have high fees. But if you look at what the fees are going to be, it's actually lower than I thought it was going to be. So if you look at the invest go one, which I think that's a galaxy partnership. So Investco Galaxy, that's no fees until 5 billion aum. And then fidelity, who oftentimes sets the, sets the price of ETF's, they'll tend to come in lower. They're coming in at 39 bits. It's high for an ETF.
00:34:04.258 - 00:34:07.666, Speaker A: Not as high as I thought it was going to be. Yeah.
00:34:07.770 - 00:34:17.960, Speaker B: Because for context, your traditional SMP ETF, tacky, like just your plain vanilla ETF's are relative to 39 bits. It's what?
00:34:17.992 - 00:34:50.684, Speaker A: Like, yeah, 2025 bips. And then if you have just like, yeah, if you have like the, you know, just the vanguard or the fidelity, like whatever the mate, like, you know, tracking QQQ or something like that's ten bits, I want to say. Or eleven or something like that. So, you know, who's missing from this list that I think is going to be a colossal regret for them is Vanguard. Vanguard has just said we're not playing in the bitcoin ETF market. And man, what a swing and a miss. Because they have, I mean, Vanguard's the largest ETF business in the world.
00:34:50.684 - 00:34:54.996, Speaker A: Like, what a colossal miss for them, in my opinion.
00:34:55.180 - 00:35:10.362, Speaker B: I would love to see a prediction market of when, when Vanguard gets into the game, whether it's, you know, within less than a year or 2025 or just never. Yeah, it's, I don't think it's ever. I think it's just at some point they get in the game.
00:35:10.498 - 00:35:26.058, Speaker A: Yeah. You know what? I've been thinking about this idea around prediction markets that we talked about on our predictions pod. I really want to, we should have an empire, like little account on polymarket. And then when these things come up, we just create the predictions and I don't know, we could get something going there.
00:35:26.186 - 00:35:33.244, Speaker B: All right, chain, if you're listening with an idea, uh, it's basically what you're saying is to help keep us accountable.
00:35:34.624 - 00:35:37.656, Speaker A: Yeah. Just. Just to show us how really wrong that we are.
00:35:37.760 - 00:35:38.832, Speaker B: Oh, we're terribly wrong.
00:35:38.888 - 00:36:17.256, Speaker A: Yeah. Um, all right, so there's a, uh. There's a new crypto tax reporting obligation that took effect on New Year's day. So I want to fill you guys in on this. Basically, uh, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs act, if you guys remember that, Congress passed it in November 2021. It included a provision that amended the tax code to require anyone who receives $10,000 or more in crypto in the course of their trade or business to make a report to the IR's about that transaction. And that report has to include, among other things, the name, the address, and the Social Security number of the person whom the funds were received, the amount received, and the date and the nature of the transaction.
00:36:17.256 - 00:36:49.444, Speaker A: And if you don't. This is the kicker. If you don't file a report within 15 days of receiving the transaction, you. You could be found guilty of a felony offense. So that provision, tax code amendment, that was passed November 2021. This law just became effective on January 1 a couple days ago, and all Americans are now subject to it. It is a self executing law, meaning there is no requirement for any additional regulatory action or implementation by a government, by a government agency for it to be enforced.
00:36:49.444 - 00:37:27.686, Speaker A: Once it is passed and signed into law, aka January 1, it was immediately operational and enforceable on its effective date. And shout out to coin center, who. I basically just read their post on this, but they actually filed a suit against the Treasury Department challenge in June of 2022 that challenged the constitutionality of the new law. But that case is still in the courts. So, as of today, if you receive more than $10,000 in crypto, uh, via either trading or your business, you have to file a report within 15 days under penalty of law. And, uh. Yeah, well, uh.
00:37:27.686 - 00:37:31.446, Speaker A: So that's the update. What did you say?
00:37:31.590 - 00:37:33.714, Speaker B: Us tax person? It's only. Right.
00:37:34.334 - 00:37:35.222, Speaker A: What'd you say?
00:37:35.358 - 00:37:36.622, Speaker B: That's for us people.
00:37:36.758 - 00:37:42.434, Speaker A: For us people, yeah. So, uh, not relevant for you.
00:37:42.874 - 00:37:47.266, Speaker B: No, but, I mean, I sympathize. It's. It's. It's a. It's a huge pain.
00:37:47.450 - 00:37:54.298, Speaker A: I mean, 15 days is like, reporting anything in 15 days is a pain in the ass. Like, I. It's had to. That's a quick turnaround.
00:37:54.386 - 00:38:18.574, Speaker B: Um, I mean, I. I still file in the US because I have nexus there. And, like, you like, the amount of. The amount of fees that have paid cpas, I've, like, at some point, hired four five when like, defi summer was crazy and so you had to, like, that first year was just preparing. Texas was just.
00:38:19.314 - 00:39:13.256, Speaker A: But like, I just don't get it shows that they don't. I mean, it's, it's not straightforward, right? Like, it's, first off, it's coin center makes the argument it's not constitutional, but at the very least it's not straightforward. Like if you're a, if you're a miner or validator and you receive block rewards of, let's say, 10,000 plus dollars, whose name and address and Social Security number are you reporting there? Or if you trade on a Dex and it's a crypto, let's say an ETH for Avax, or crypto for crypto swap, you receive $10,000 in, let's say you swap ETH for Avax or something. Who are you reporting there on the other side of that? And what standard should you measure whether an amount of a particular crypto is equivalent to more than $10,000? Like, if you buy, I don't know what pudgies are at right now. Let's. When pudgies were at ten, like, is a pudgy worth 10,000? Is it not? Because it's illiquid. Like, what do you.
00:39:13.256 - 00:39:15.288, Speaker A: So it's, it's very, it's, uh, I.
00:39:15.296 - 00:39:31.512, Speaker B: Mean, I get it located. It's an information game, and they want to understand who the participants are in this whole economy. I think there are better ways to do that. Uh, less taxing from a time perspective. Like, there's a great blog, marginal, um. What is it? Marginal revolution.
00:39:31.568 - 00:39:32.964, Speaker A: Marginal revolution, yeah.
00:39:33.104 - 00:40:25.434, Speaker B: And there is a great piece over the years that he talks about, like the GP, like the economic impact of the filing taxes in the US, which is relative to other countries, is like, the amount of time that people have to dedicate to filing their taxes is very unproductive for the economy. And if we were to simplify that countries like in Scandinavia and Singapore, it is a very much more streamlined process versus you having to extend in every quarter, or like, you know, it's just crazy, right? It is not like trivial. Like, it would have a massive economic impact if we were streamlined. But the fact that the tax code is very complex is a feature, not a bug. You know, it's. Anyway, so why is it a feature, not a bug? Because the more complex the people that can pay for the complexity of the taxi would understand, it cannot find certain.
00:40:25.554 - 00:40:27.854, Speaker A: Oh, it's a feature. It's a feature for the rich.
00:40:28.154 - 00:40:45.938, Speaker B: Exactly. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Look, I mean, like, this is the whole criticism of like folks like Trump and whatnot. Like not ever paying, like, their effective tax rate is like not your typical 30 50% for normal people. You know, there's strategies and the more the anyways around, but. Yes, exactly.
00:40:45.986 - 00:41:08.534, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, it applies to businesses too. Like blockworks gets paid in crypto. A lot of our deals are not like, is USDC crypto, right. And we get more than $10,000 in USDC, like every day or every other day or something. Like, are we reporting just every day sending a new transaction to the IRA? Like, maybe. I guess we will.
00:41:08.614 - 00:41:10.594, Speaker B: It's like a normal form.
00:41:11.294 - 00:41:20.434, Speaker A: It's like, I mean, I don't even get, if you sent, do you send it to Fincen or do you send it to, or the IR's or both of them, right?
00:41:20.854 - 00:41:39.246, Speaker B: Certain things, like they're still mailing out this stuff with incredible amount of p, like, sensitive information to outdated addresses. Updating your information with the IR's is like a super complicated process. It's not like their website is very streamlined and modernized. It is the most, among the most antiquated them in the DMV are the most.
00:41:39.310 - 00:41:43.794, Speaker A: I pay my New York taxes for like four days. The site was down and I was like, I'm.
00:41:45.974 - 00:42:05.466, Speaker B: Still waiting on taxes that I paid as an intern at JP Morgan. And 22,009, oh, you're not getting those back. They may mail it to you within the next one or five years. The address that I put on that file, I don't live there anymore. I can't update that address.
00:42:05.530 - 00:42:21.754, Speaker A: So it's like, yeah, good luck with that. Good luck with that. Yeah, I didn't cash a tax refund in time. And so I called, I called them, first off, it took like 8 hours to wait on the phone. And then they're like, yeah, we'll send you a new check within the next 1212 months. I was like, months? What?
00:42:22.984 - 00:42:23.724, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:42:24.264 - 00:43:12.174, Speaker A: The very last thing I wanted to call out is actually Visa announced that they are piloting a crypto customer loyalty platform, like basically an NFT loyalty platform. I just thought this was cool. In 2021, if you remember, they launched a crypto advisory unit to help their clients and their partners navigate crypto. At the time, they cited a crypto rewards program as a possible offering for which they could build. And, yeah, two and a half years later, it's cool to see them follow up on this. So basically the platform, it's a customer engagement platform called the Visa Web three loyalty engagement solution. And what it does is it helps brands create wallets where they can store reward points and experiences on behalf of consumers.
00:43:12.174 - 00:43:28.302, Speaker A: And it's called an NFT led platform. That's, I think they'll basically sell this or help their clients build it or something like that. And then it's kind of b, two b, two c, and then their clients will figure out what kind of rewards they want to have for their customers.
00:43:28.478 - 00:43:49.854, Speaker B: That's great. It's good to see continue on this adoption and I think they appreciate the opportunity better than most. I wanted to. We don't have to go deep into this because I think there are people that are better at talking about it. But you had it as a prediction. I did too. Restaking as a risk, the rehypothecation of security.
00:43:49.854 - 00:44:15.438, Speaker B: I think we should be on top of this. There was a most recent thread that I saw you commenting on David from a bank list. He was like, eigen layer, unquotes will cause 2008 like, like global financial crisis on Ethereum. He says, it's some of the biggest cope I've ever seen on this app. I've seen words. But anyways, we'll take that. And you say well.
00:44:15.438 - 00:44:32.782, Speaker B: And you respond, that is big cope and fud. But also restaking is about to get insane. Probably starts yield farming 2.0 that rivals Defi's summer restaker restakers layers, several layers of tokens on top of each other. That's a lot of chains on the same underlying asset. Feels scary. Question mark.
00:44:32.782 - 00:44:52.166, Speaker B: And David responds, I think it's pattern. I think pattern match. I think it pattern matches with a lot of scary things we've seen before. And he says, like euthanasia, roller coaster TM. But slashing prevention and risk mitigation strategies are also numerous. And this is where I think we should double click on. And this is the side.
00:44:52.166 - 00:45:39.566, Speaker B: And this is aside from how Eigen layer contagion risk is overblown. Look, I think there are numerous restaking providers out there not to pick just an eigen layer, but if I were to just. I want to end the episode with maybe something that we should follow up in a future pot. And it's this restaking component because we had the Eigen layer, guys. I think it was about a year ago, it was like January of last year. And I was going back and listening to that episode because look, a lot I think they've done, they've continued to develop. There were certain things in that episode where I didn't come fully satisfied with certain responses of how they were collecting this trusted group of people to act as the Security Council, if you will.
00:45:39.566 - 00:46:12.654, Speaker B: There's certain mechanisms that I think are worth updating. Maybe we should have the Eigen layers again and maybe a panel of other people that are doing deep research on this, because it certainly feels like you're stacking more risk. It's certainly not making the chain more secure. But the question is, how much more risk? And what are these, quote, quote, slashing prevention risk mitigation strategies? Well, are they sound? And how do you really know if you haven't battle tested them? So anyways, I would love to really do a deep dive.
00:46:12.774 - 00:46:38.054, Speaker A: I mean, let me just finish, just to respond to that last David thing that I said. I said. So I think what I said to him is, I think Eigen Lair Fudd is dumb. But what I think is going to happen is that 50, maybe 100 liquid restaking token platforms launched this year, it's going to be insane. And I think most will be launched by good, well intentioned builders. But some are going to take these crazy risks, pull in a lot of capital, and they inevitably blow up. And that's where my concern lies.
00:46:38.054 - 00:46:59.750, Speaker A: And I think actually, mike also partner in crime over here at blockworks, he had a good take. He said, I think there's a middle ground between these views. I bet we have a big blow up in restaking. Feels inevitable, actually. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't do it or won't be successful blow ups have been happening at banks since time, and we still have those. So, I mean, just like, it's. We're not just taking risks, though.
00:46:59.750 - 00:47:30.614, Speaker A: Like, I do think restaking is good. Like, restaking provides a service that the market needs, right? So, like, Eigen layer is a protocol. As a reminder to folks, like, Eigen layer is a protocol. If you guys missed that episode that we did with Sriram, you should just search for it and listen to it, or we can have them on again. But Eigenlayer is a protocol that facilitates restaking of liquid tokens. That's lsts, such as steeth. And they do that to secure these things called avss, actively validated services.
00:47:30.614 - 00:48:07.126, Speaker A: And people call it like, if you see this word, like programmable trust, that's what they're talking about. So avss use Eigenlayer to bootstrap their security model with restaked ETH. And AVSS can be chains, it can be networks, middleware applications. And the problem that they're solving in the market is that prior to Eigen layer securing and properly distributing a decentralized system like an l one was a really big undertaking. It took a lot of money and a lot of time. So if you take, for instance, like bitcoin and ETH, like those took years to reach critical mass. The concern that I have is it's just a lot of layers.
00:48:07.126 - 00:48:40.756, Speaker A: Um, there's now, like four layers of risk that you have. You have, first you have the risk of staking your ETH. Then you have the risk of liquid staking ETH. Then you have the risk of restaking ETH. Then you have the risk of liquid restaking ETH. You're exposed to both slashing and smart contract bug risk at each layer. So the more layers you stack on top of these things, like, uh, the riskier and riskier it gets in my mind, and the more claims on a single underlying piece of ETH, and then what's going to happen is more claims on underlying pieces of random tokens.
00:48:40.756 - 00:48:43.264, Speaker A: Like the riskier it gets, I think.
00:48:44.244 - 00:49:01.184, Speaker B: So is it typical summation or exponential risk? Because when you stack these type of things, sometimes the risk is not one plus one, it's actually one, you know, whatever probability, like the risk just blows out of proportion. I don't really know. I think.
00:49:02.004 - 00:49:28.156, Speaker A: And then what's about to happen, I don't know. If you've seen some of these deal, like these companies getting built is there's going to be liquid restaking defi that launches. Okay, so, like, here's the four, four layers of risk. It's staking ETH, then liquid staking ETH, then restaking ETH, and liquid restaking ETH. But then there's, there's even more layers. There's like you're going to be able to deposit your liquid restaking token, let's say, into an AMM Dex. You'll get an LP token back in return.
00:49:28.156 - 00:49:45.764, Speaker A: Then you can deposit that LP token into a, let's say, a money market as collateral. So then you can borrow even more ETH to liquid restake. Now you've got like seven layers of risk in the process. I actually think Chainlink God has laid out some of these risks better than most. So maybe we could do an app with him or something.
00:49:45.804 - 00:50:13.820, Speaker B: But yeah, hefam fishy and maybe other people. Does it feel like I want to maybe challenge one thing you said there is, what is the end game? Like when you say it is providing a useful service continuum? What is the actual use other than artificially, like, creating yield opportunities? Like what is the, it's like, I.
00:50:13.852 - 00:50:38.990, Speaker A: See this in a way of every. Okay, I have two responses here. One is every time you make it cheaper to go build something new, things come to market. So if you take like AWS or something like AWS and these cloud providers, it makes it much easier and cheaper to launch. To go launch a company. To go launch a SaaS company. If you take like squarespace and webflow, like, it makes it easier to build a website.
00:50:38.990 - 00:50:50.366, Speaker A: Eigen layer is making it easier to build distributed systems. Now, the problem with this is every time you launch, go launch a new thing. Like, let's say every time you go.
00:50:50.390 - 00:51:40.414, Speaker B: Launch an double click on that before you go further. It's this idea of shared security of using, when you have a validation of a distributed system, somehow their thesis is that is a very kind of, that process can be utilized in a more efficient manner. And in a way, like, because the way theorem is architected, you apply the same sort of validation for everything. And maybe there are different security assumptions or the amount of energy that you apply to a certain validation can be different. Like, you're creating like more, more like consumer preference, if you will. Like the ability to like distribute and redistribute security by rehypothecating it, or like.
00:51:41.194 - 00:52:03.986, Speaker A: Okay, so this really. Yeah, your quite your, well, I think what you're getting at is like, how useful really is economic security to Ethereum. Exactly. And I mean, right now it's deemed in the market to be useful. Like I think, say, or some, you know, some, some other folks are like renting or bar. I don't know what the right word is. Like renting security from Ethereum using eigen layer.
00:52:03.986 - 00:52:29.826, Speaker A: Folks like that. Like it is a product that the market is, is using right now, like as a, like a SaaS product. If it was a SaaS product, they would have customers long term. I could make the argument that economic security is a bit of a meme. Like, let's play this out. Consider your new protocol. Like you, Santi, the founder, and you want to bootstrap security so you could go get validators and all that kind of stuff.
00:52:29.826 - 00:53:20.900, Speaker A: But, but it's, you know, it's, it's kind of expensive and stuff like that. So you, so you, what you do is you borrow economic security from, from eigen layer. The problem with that argument, though, is if you want to attack the network, there are so many other ways to do it that are more efficient than a 51% attack. If you had a chain that was worth $10 and you needed to attack what you're, I think, preventing against here is someone buying $5 worth of stuff because then they can corrupt the chain, right? A 51% attack. In reality, I don't really think any chains get attacked by 51% attacks. They get attacked by human problems and people problems and multisigs and smart contract bugs. And that's really what you need to prevent against.
00:53:20.900 - 00:53:43.624, Speaker A: So what ends up happening if you take pre Eigen layer world is you go create some hype, you get some validators, you hope the number goes up enough so that the 51% attack is too expensive to do. You're not, you weren't really raising money to then go buy economic security. Yeah, I mean, look, that's the counterargument, I think, to economic security.
00:53:45.724 - 00:53:51.252, Speaker B: I just feel like that this is a way, a mechanism right now, it's.
00:53:51.268 - 00:53:52.540, Speaker A: A way to attract users.
00:53:52.652 - 00:54:58.958, Speaker B: It would be the benefits outweighing the risks of introducing way more fragility to security, because you should never compromise on that. But I understand why they are doing it in the way the ethereum is architected, that I don't necessarily think you have that problem in a chain like cosmos or Solana, for instance. And that's what I want to focus on. Because at what point do you really put in at risk the core tenets of a decentralized distributed system to focus on what is, I think, like, for scalability reasons? Like it's a fine, I think it's a fine line we're treading here is all I'm saying. I'm not smart enough and I need to do more work to have a more informed opinion. But my intuition when I was talking with Algonayers publicly in this pod, and it doesn't feel like it's going to end well. I don't want to be that like cannery in the coal mine that just says it's not going to end well and just stop there.
00:54:58.958 - 00:55:09.222, Speaker B: I want to have a more nuanced and informed view, and so I want to have smarter people come in and comment on that because I think it's the right time to focus on it. As these things gain. It's going to be a top.
00:55:09.318 - 00:55:33.876, Speaker A: I think it doesn't end. If you had to predict something now, do you think it doesn't end well because everyone ends up building on top of Eigen layer and there's risk of like centralized risk of Eigen layer. Do you think it's because one of these liquid restaking token platforms blows up? Do you think it's a mass restaking related slashing event that occurs again, my.
00:55:33.900 - 00:56:06.034, Speaker B: Understanding back then was, I think you're transitioning now to more human judgment as it relates to the allocation of certain resources, meaning security. Because when we interviewed Calvin or what's his, it was. It was this council initially that was like, when you. I think when you determine, like, how security gets, like, different use cases require different sets of security, and so it becomes a bit more efficient. That that was, like, my impression of it. And it may be wrong. There is a human element in judgment there.
00:56:06.034 - 00:56:35.234, Speaker B: And I just think humans are never good at this stuff. Yeah, they're never good. Like, they will make mistakes. And this is why we build on crypto, because we don't rely on humans. We rely on a set of smart contracts that, okay, are built by humans, but you can have formal verification and other things, too, battle test and get more Lindy. And unfortunately, in crypto, when things break, they really can break. And so building Lindy, Ethereum has built a lot of Lindy and security as a base layer.
00:56:35.234 - 00:57:28.046, Speaker B: There's been parts of the stack built on top of Ethereum, like Defi, that are broken at times, smart contracts that have had bugs, and even Ethereum has had certain things that needed to be patched. But, yeah, that's my only. Not my only. That's what I worry where we are somehow of the mind that we can take a lot of this very important resource that through validation or mining, we get security, and then we somehow are now of the mind that we can further optimize that resource by, like, allocating it to different use cases and renting it out. And I think in that process, I want to question that assumption. I want to have smarter people come in here and talk about the merits of that, but also the risks of that. And look, I don't.
00:57:28.046 - 00:58:05.038, Speaker B: To your point, I sort of agree. I don't think all restaking providers are going to be created equal. And as we know, people chase high yield. And so, you know, as there can be blow ups, you know, there can be blow ups in any smart contract, not just a restaking provider. The implications of one are vastly different than the other, I think, you know, in defi, you also have these, like, the money Lego concept is very sexy, and composability is a beautiful thing. The fragility of that is, you know, it's sort of like you're only as strong as your weakest link. So if there's a.
00:58:05.038 - 00:58:57.216, Speaker B: It's like a Jenga tower, there's a particular lego in that tower that falls apart. Well, it's very, you know, like, if Ave were to have a terrible situation, then it has cascading effects across this financial system that is very interconnected. So yeah, it's sort of more of a, I want to talk more about the guardrails. I want to talk more about the, like, the slashing mechanisms, the contagion mechanisms. I feel like a lot of people are just saying, borrowing these type of concepts that we understand in normal validation, in a normal proof of stake system. Oh, you know, you have slashing and you have like, this is the mechanism by which, you know, if a validator like, goes offline or, you know, is acting maliciously, then there is a roundabout around that to, for the chain to continue to operate or whatever. I just don't think it's, that same logic applies to restaking one.
00:58:57.216 - 00:59:28.194, Speaker B: We haven't seen it too. I think there's a lot of people that don't really truly understand how these mechanisms work. I want to bring on people that actually understand how that works to then make that distinction. Because I think the Eigen layer guys in the pod were saying, look, there are some things that we still need to build and we don't know all the answers to these things. But then you see people commenting on Twitter that they fucking know everything. And it's like, no, no, it's just important to call this out and say we don't know. And before you ape into Eigen layer or whatever other restaking provider, just understand that these are very little lending to them.
00:59:28.194 - 00:59:37.214, Speaker B: I'm not saying they're not going to work. I'm also accepting the fact that they're going to get built because you can't stop this trend.
00:59:37.334 - 00:59:56.226, Speaker A: We will. Why don't we do this? Let's wrap this part about liquid restaking and the risks of it. We will invite a couple of founders building these liquid restaking platforms. They're going to be pretty early. Some of them might even be pre launch or something. But they are some of the smartest people. I think anyone building in this is thinking about this twenty four seven.
00:59:56.226 - 01:00:08.546, Speaker A: I think people understand that it's risky, so we will. I invested in one called Rio because of this reason. They're kind of like the adults in the room of liquid restaking. I thought. So we can invite them on or some other folks as well.
01:00:08.570 - 01:00:13.146, Speaker B: So yeah, let's do it. Let's make that a priority.
01:00:13.290 - 01:00:20.680, Speaker A: All right. You're getting nervous. I see the sweat beads dripping. I have a content recommendation for you.
01:00:20.792 - 01:00:21.444, Speaker B: Nice.
01:00:25.864 - 01:01:08.194, Speaker A: It is. I was going to make a book recommendation, but I'll make a podcast episode recommendation. It's the femarket episode that Mike did on Bell Curve with Sam Hart from Skip protocol from Cosmos. And, oh, my God, I'm sorry, to the a 16 z guy, really smart guy, who's great from Andreessen. He's a researcher over there. But they did a whole episode on fee markets. They basically started with bitcoin fees, the bitcoin fee market, then moved over to ETH fee market, then talked about 1559, then talked about Solana fee markets and maybe what the Solana folks are going to run into with the problems with their fee markets in maybe six to twelve months.
01:01:08.194 - 01:01:37.470, Speaker A: And then talked about potential ideas for different fee markets, maybe unbundling gas or different things that, you know, maybe it's credit markets where, you know, you get actually paid to transact on chain, or it's zero fees to transact on chain because of some different credits. So. Or maybe it's ave says to uniswap, like, hey, your users can trade here for free. I'll pay for your, you know, and vice versa. So, really interesting episode on fee markets on the bell curve feed. So that's my. I would recommend folks listen to that.
01:01:37.622 - 01:01:46.318, Speaker B: Nice. Yeah, it feels like the fee market's another area where I've been doing more research. I think it's one of the areas where Solana can be further optimized. Yeah, yeah.
01:01:46.446 - 01:01:50.774, Speaker A: We have. Well, we have Anatoly and Ben coming on the pod, so we'll dig into fees with them.
01:01:50.814 - 01:01:59.394, Speaker B: Your anniversary of the pod that we did when everything was kind of the worst moment. So that should be really good. Who else do we have on just to give people?
01:02:00.014 - 01:02:04.994, Speaker A: We have some. We have some good apps. We have. Here's some good apps on campus.
01:02:05.644 - 01:02:06.668, Speaker B: A deep in discussion.
01:02:06.716 - 01:02:22.144, Speaker A: Oh, we have a deep in debate with, uh, Kyle and. And Dmitri. We have a Logan Jasremski from, uh, from frictionless coming on. We got the. The guys at Kinto coming on. That's Nell, too. Got.
01:02:22.144 - 01:02:33.348, Speaker A: Yeah, we've got Ilya from Nier coming on. Talk about Nir's new DA stuff. We've got Haseeb and vitro coming back to the table, so. Yeah, a lot of good apps lined up.
01:02:33.516 - 01:02:34.276, Speaker B: That's awesome.
01:02:34.380 - 01:02:36.260, Speaker A: Yeah, good stuff. I'm a friend.
01:02:36.292 - 01:02:54.744, Speaker B: We're just above the hour mark, so get some sleep, sir, to end it. Go have your drat by meetings, and you know I will. That's great. All right, folks, well, thanks so much for listening. And stay safe. Don't play with leverage. We'll see you next week.
01:02:55.564 - 01:03:13.098, Speaker A: Hey, everyone. Thank you so much for watching today's episode. Really hope you enjoyed it. We wanted to take a second to just remind you about about our upcoming digital asset summit in London, March 18 to 20th. Santi and I got your back. Seats are limited, and we hooked you up with a 20% off discount code. It is Empire 20.
01:03:13.098 - 01:03:24.634, Speaker A: If you heard it earlier in the podcast, there's a little competition running at blockworks to see who can drive the most number of tickets. So when you register for the digital asset summit, make sure you use our code. Empire 20. See you in London.
