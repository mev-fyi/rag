00:00:00.240 - 00:00:13.974, Speaker A: My, like, big bet in crypto right now is Defi. Like, I just. I'm so convicted that if nothing else, like, get. Take everything out of crypto. I just think that Defi is a better product than tradfi. I just think it's a better product. And products will always.
00:00:13.974 - 00:00:35.460, Speaker A: Good products will always win out. This episode is brought to you by Core, the brand new non custodial wallet that offers a seamless and secure experience on avalanche. You'll hear more about core later in the show. All right, what's going on, everyone? We are back with another roundup. We got Santi joining us. Santi, looking. Looking sharp today, my friend.
00:00:35.460 - 00:00:36.316, Speaker A: Looking sharp.
00:00:36.460 - 00:00:41.020, Speaker B: Thank you. Just trying to be more like you, sir. Got a rise to the occasion.
00:00:41.092 - 00:00:48.412, Speaker A: I think it's really that the YouTube comments were piling up on you these last couple of weeks, and I think you're trying to put on a face for the YouTube folks.
00:00:48.508 - 00:00:57.516, Speaker B: Shout out to everyone that's commenting on YouTube. I do read them. They're always appreciated, and so, yeah, keep. Keep them coming.
00:00:57.660 - 00:01:01.344, Speaker A: Yeah. Nice. You see my new background? I changed my desk around.
00:01:01.684 - 00:01:05.724, Speaker B: Yeah, that's pretty cool. I like the color, and, yeah, it's pretty awesome.
00:01:05.764 - 00:01:07.748, Speaker A: To the walls. We got it all set up now.
00:01:07.836 - 00:01:12.904, Speaker B: Is this you, like, transitioning now into married life? Oh, I guess. Did I disclose that, or.
00:01:13.884 - 00:01:17.108, Speaker A: We can talk about it. Yeah, I mean, I've got get married in three weeks.
00:01:17.196 - 00:01:18.284, Speaker B: Who cares about the merge?
00:01:18.324 - 00:01:19.964, Speaker A: Like, that's the real merge.
00:01:20.004 - 00:01:22.228, Speaker B: I know he's getting married.
00:01:22.356 - 00:01:26.188, Speaker A: I am merging one week after the merge. I really.
00:01:26.316 - 00:01:27.664, Speaker B: No one's talking about.
00:01:27.964 - 00:01:44.308, Speaker A: It's a good thing. My fiance would never listen to this podcast, or she would just be wildly embarrassed that I said that, so. Yeah, no, I mean, this background, though, is actually, you know what's cool is digital asset summit, our conference. Shout out das. If you want to come. You can get a plug, a discount. Yano 250.
00:01:44.308 - 00:02:01.292, Speaker A: I'm competing with Mike on that discount code right now, but the merge is happening the day of Das, so that'll be interesting. Which our events actually coincide nicely. Like, we had a permissionless was right after Doe and Tara stuff unfolded. So, high drama around blockworks events.
00:02:01.468 - 00:02:16.010, Speaker B: Yeah, seriously. I think most conferences in and around most conferences is when crazy, funky stuff goes down and happens. Not all negative, not all positive is just. It's usually when a lot of news comes out.
00:02:16.132 - 00:02:21.718, Speaker A: Yeah, it's true. It's true. All right. You tweeted out I am recording the roundup in 30 minutes. What should we cover?
00:02:21.846 - 00:02:22.318, Speaker B: Mm hmm.
00:02:22.366 - 00:02:24.554, Speaker A: And there's a lot of good stuff. So where do you want to start?
00:02:25.414 - 00:02:35.534, Speaker B: Let's see. I mean, there's. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know if you have an opinion. I'm of the mind that I'm going to let you do a more talking and be guide more of the discussion. So we.
00:02:35.574 - 00:03:07.694, Speaker A: I mean, let's get the, let's get the fun one out of the way, which I just think is the most absurd one. Michael Saylor was accused of tax fraud on Wednesday. Um, yeah. It was announced that the district attorney general, uh, that DC's AG, claimed that Saylor had basically been personally illegally avoided, uh, more than $25 million of DC taxes by prevent. Uh, he was pretending to be a resident of other jurisdictions that had lower personal income taxes. So basically he had said that he was in, um, Florida most of the time. I think it was Florida.
00:03:07.734 - 00:03:47.564, Speaker B: Said he was in Florida most of the time. And then they would attract, like, exactly like, like private, plain logs of where he had actually been. And, I mean, I think a lot of this. You posted a great video of him, you know, really just saying, like, bitcoin is a vehicle to do tax evasion. And then just like a big f you to tax man. It's like, you know, like, I don't know, you poke a bear and they're gonna come after you. Like, it was just his comments kind of like, if you compare his rhetoric at the very beginning when he came out saying, look, I believe in bitcoin, to now, it's just like he's sort of become a madman of just being very.
00:03:47.564 - 00:04:31.538, Speaker B: I don't know, I feel like. Like increasingly becoming very aggressive, and I think this type of tone never kind of bodes well because it's very polarizing. Whereas, I don't know, I think we try to be pretty objective here. And, yeah, everyone should go see the tweet and we can link it of what he was saying publicly on air. And if you read the report, the feds, like the IR's, and I think it was the DC general, prosecutor or attorney general, they quoted that excerpt from the video that you posted, which was that he sort of said that bitcoin could be a vehicle for tax evasion. You're like, well, not really.
00:04:31.626 - 00:04:51.418, Speaker A: I'm just a fucking idiot. I'm like, you, what are you doing? You're a CEO of a public company and you're saying, you. If you push me too far, then I'll tell you that I've lost my bitcoin in a boating accident. I'm like, buddy, you are the ce, you are the one of the most prominent faces of bitcoin right now. And you're just such an idiot. Also, good luck paying. Good luck paying those taxes.
00:04:51.418 - 00:04:57.490, Speaker A: Like, the, when the market's down, it gets tough to pay those taxes. I think he, what do they say.
00:04:57.522 - 00:04:59.916, Speaker B: He owes a tune of 25 million or something?
00:05:00.050 - 00:05:00.724, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:05:01.304 - 00:05:26.320, Speaker B: Here's the thing. There's sort of this idea that crypto is, like, headless marketing. It doesn't have a head of marketing. It doesn't have, like, a one figure head. Like some protocols, like, have, like Vitalik, you could see as a very prominent figure within the Ethereum community. But, you know, everyone has different narratives and memes and, like, you know, things about ETH. ETH as money, ultrasound money, and then there's other components and so bitcoins as well.
00:05:26.320 - 00:06:15.368, Speaker B: And so almost makes you wonder, like, what is better? Like, in many ways, like, having, like, some madmans just, like, larping about, like, I don't know, like, what they think. Like, you know what I mean? If Saylor perhaps was, like, recognized as the figurehead, the champion of bitcoin amongst many in, like, traditional markets, and, like, they look at that and you, as you said, you know, you're really scared. I'm like, not. The problem is not everyone in the bitcoin camp is like, sailor, right? Not everyone in the bit, in the Ethereum camp is like, x or y. Pick your influencer of choice. And so, yeah, it's pretty difficult to navigate like that because this is why I think most people on the outside are kind of afraid. I'm like, wow, this space is, I.
00:06:15.376 - 00:06:37.680, Speaker A: Mean, it's a good reminder that, like, the most ridiculous people on social media usually rise to the top and become almost like, the heroes of the industry. So let's, like, let's look at the past heroes who have fallen. This year. Three arrows, right? Kyle and sue, those are heroes of the industry. Doe was a hero of the industry. Michael Saylor, hero of the industry. It reminds me of that, of that saying, right? Never meet your heroes.
00:06:37.680 - 00:06:44.608, Speaker A: It's like, I don't know. I'm kind of waiting for who's the next hero to fall? Who do you think is the next hero to fall? Who's the next one?
00:06:44.776 - 00:07:02.096, Speaker B: No, I never want to make a prediction about someone falling, but I will say, like, as a general matter, anytime you glorify someone, it's usually like, a bad sign, right? Like, we tend to, like, success is not driven by one particular person.
00:07:02.200 - 00:07:03.944, Speaker A: Then we can glorify them.
00:07:04.024 - 00:07:37.662, Speaker B: You should always kind of correct. But yeah, you know what I mean? Like, I think we tend to attribute success and failure to one specific person, especially success. And it's really the case. It's sort of a combination of factors. And so I think it's always important to understand why people were successful, but, like, never glorify them because there's always a component of, like, what about the team behind Facebook, for instance? It was not all Zuckerberg. Like, there's so many things that went into the success of Facebook as an example. And so I think just to glorify or vilify one particular individual, I think it's just sort of misses the point.
00:07:37.662 - 00:07:39.046, Speaker B: So anyway, I think it's a good.
00:07:39.070 - 00:08:05.002, Speaker A: Reminder that, I mean, here, I'll read you this headline. New York Times microstrategy chairman Michael Saylor accused of fraud by the SEC. The date on that is December 2000. So 20 years later, I mean, here's the story. Michael Saylor settled the civil charges that were filed in federal court. SEC contended that Saylor and two other microstrategy execs had committed fraud in reporting profits when the company was actually losing money. So I don't know.
00:08:05.002 - 00:08:09.858, Speaker A: It's like if you are going to choose a hero, just make sure your hero hasn't been publicly committing fraud.
00:08:09.906 - 00:08:31.510, Speaker B: It is. The last thing I'll say is it is crazy. Like how, like, short term, it's like goldfish memory that investors have, not just in crypto, but in general, like, you know, very short term, and people overlook and don't due diligence on, like, you know, you know, unfortunately, like, yeah, yeah, let's talk maker.
00:08:31.582 - 00:08:32.750, Speaker A: You want to talk maker?
00:08:32.942 - 00:08:45.358, Speaker B: Yeah, let's definitely talk about that. First of all, I know you've been digging. This is where I get to ask you most of the questions because you become very deep in the maker ecosystem to the point that you become that voted in delegate. Right.
00:08:45.486 - 00:08:47.102, Speaker A: I just became a recognized delegate.
00:08:47.198 - 00:08:55.054, Speaker B: Recognized delegate, yeah. So maybe tell us what that means and what have you been looking at that excites you about all the different DeFi protocols you could be spending time on?
00:08:55.174 - 00:09:25.978, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, so here's what happened over the last, like, several months. I've just gotten very, I've gone very deep into maker. I've done read everything I can possibly read, talked to everyone I can talk to, learned a lot. We had that episode with Monet supply and Hexanot, who's an engineer over maker. I've just tried to go really, really deep reason being you're very deep into gaming. My big bet in crypto right now is Defi. I'm so convicted that if nothing else, take everything out of crypto.
00:09:25.978 - 00:09:55.742, Speaker A: I just think that Defi is a better product than tradfi. I just think it's a better product. And products will always, good products will always win out. I have a very strong conviction that Defi will grow exponentially in the coming decades by orders of magnitude. And I think that if maker plays their cards right, they have the opportunity to become the backbone of Defi. And if that happens, right, two big things. Two big ifs, right? If DeFi grows exponentially, eventually gets bigger than CFI, and then gets bigger than tradfi, I think that will happen.
00:09:55.742 - 00:10:33.264, Speaker A: I also think Maker will become the most, will become the backbone of Defi. And if those two things happen, I think Maker will go down in history, like, could become one of the most impactful initiatives in the history of global finance. And that's just an insane opportunity. I think that to achieve that, though, maker needs to evolve, right? It needs a better growth strategy, it needs improved governance, it needs more scalable operations. And I think I can take what I've learned at blockworks over the last four and a half years, building it and launching it and scaling it, and apply some of those things to maker. So, yeah, I don't know. I was encouraged to do this by a lot of folks.
00:10:33.264 - 00:10:47.092, Speaker A: Big shout out to Hasoo and mark over at Maker, Monet supply. Like, they, yeah, they were very helpful in encouraging me to do this and, yeah, I just went for it and got voted in. There's a big thing happening at Maker today, which is.
00:10:47.188 - 00:10:47.892, Speaker B: Please tell us.
00:10:47.948 - 00:11:43.628, Speaker A: Yeah, there's a big thing happening at maker today, which is just a big conversation around what is the end, like, the end state of maker and what should happen. So someone like Hasu is looking to basically create, like, almost what looks more like a board of directors, I would say of, there's a lot more in it. And actually Husu is going to come on the podcast and talk about this, but so I won't get too into it. And then there's Rune wants to basically create what he calls the endgame plan. And it's, I would say, and I would say a very comprehensive plan to try to eventually, um, the, the new update is potentially free float die. Um, and that, and that would be the big, like, end goal. Uh, and with the, with the, like, north star of saying we are a self supporting, uh, self sustaining, censorship resistant protocol.
00:11:43.628 - 00:12:05.242, Speaker A: Big, really, really really tough goal. Right. And so he just came out with this week, um, like, more details on what that looks like. And I actually. So I've been kind of skeptical of Rune's endgame plan, to be honest. But I thought his strategy makes a lot of sense. And so what it is, is, like, for the next three years, he's basically saying, for the next three years, have unlimited real world asset exposure.
00:12:05.242 - 00:13:00.224, Speaker A: And the pushback on real world assets has been, okay, well, since we saw tornado cash, doesn't it mean if real world assets become the collateral of DAi, doesn't that mean that we're, like, more open to kind of authoritarian threats, and they could basically seize some of the collateral of daisy, which makes us more at the whim of the regulators. So basically, Roon's thing is, for the next three years, just go all in on real world assets, unlimited real world asset exposure, with the goal of accumulating Max ETH. And then after three years, you would cap the real world assets at 25%. The next is you would keep the peg for three years. So the USD to die peg, you keep that for three years, and you could even go longer if there's no authoritarian threat. And then the next is you would delay the free float if collateral becomes 75% decentralized. So if 75% of the collateral is crypto native, like bitcoin and ETH, you would delay the free float.
00:13:00.224 - 00:13:18.400, Speaker A: And the reason you don't go all crypto collateral right now is because there's just not enough crypto, basically, to increase the total addressable market. And to scale die, you kind of need to be able to scale die proportionally with the demand. And for that, you probably need real.
00:13:18.432 - 00:14:03.834, Speaker B: World assets for folks listening, because the reason why that's true is because Dai is collateralized. And so you think about the upper bound of DAI supply is tied directly to its only crypto collateral by the size of the crypto market. Whereas if you onboard non crypto assets as collateral types, then it really increases the upper bound. What is the kind of, why is this relevant now in terms of this free float? And maybe for context, it's not free flowing today. Free floating today. And so maybe explain a little bit of those mechanics and why is it kind of being discussed now?
00:14:04.694 - 00:14:51.264, Speaker A: I think that so in maybe what Roon would say, and honestly, we should just invite Roon on, but I think he believes that maker only has two options, which I would agree with him on, actually. I think there's probably only two options, completely compliant path, and you end up operating almost like a neo bank, like a monzo or N 26, or like a fintech platform, and you're completely regulated, and you're a good product, right? It'd be a really good product. It'd be hyper efficient. But you do have to fit into the regulatory boundaries. The other path that you can go down is complete decentralization. And the way that you do that is you really minimize the degrees that regulatory crackdowns can damage a protocol. And one of those things would be free floating dye, essentially.
00:14:52.124 - 00:15:08.780, Speaker B: And when you see the price of dye fluctuate, it's never fixed. It does fluctuate today. You've seen the peg, if you will, gravitate and oscillate around the range of a dollar. But at times, it has lost.
00:15:08.892 - 00:15:10.860, Speaker A: You were deep in it, right? March 12, 2020.
00:15:10.932 - 00:15:12.624, Speaker B: Noticeably like March.
00:15:13.574 - 00:15:21.114, Speaker A: As someone who was very hands on with Maker a couple of years ago, like, what do you, what are your thoughts on maker right now?
00:15:21.694 - 00:16:11.874, Speaker B: I've continued to believe the maker is sort of the backbone of defi. It is perhaps the most important protocol. And for context, historically, Maker really opened up the possibility of having decentralized finance on ethereum, because in the absence of maker, the smart contract that allows anyone to mint this stable unit called dai with some collateral. And this initially, and for a long time, it was only ethereum. ETH is collateral, which is sort of pristine and you could say censorship resistant. So when you think about, like, in the prior cycle, you had the value of that collateral drop, kind of what you're seeing now is 70, 80%. And Dai really maintained its peg.
00:16:11.874 - 00:17:33.976, Speaker B: And so I think that really opened up people's imaginations internally. Did mine to say, wow, okay, you have won this, like, this, like, very well functioning system that, you know, while you have a very volatile collateral type, it has maintained its peg, and if it can survive in this very adversarial market condition, which was 2018 and post crash, like, you saw a path towards saying, okay, well, okay, there's something here. And a lot of people historically use maker to not have to sell ETH and borrow against their stack to pay for, you know, other stuff, you know, pay for real world stuff. You know, Dai would be converted to and sold in an exchange for to go buy a house or whatever or pay for food or what have you. And so that was like that to me, feels and has been a killer use case like money markets. And the ability to have a stable unit of account across Defi was, it's a prerequisite for having decentralized finance. And so to me that, and I still think that maker is a leader in the space, has a very robust, it's not a very intuitive, straightforward protocol to understand, but it has done a lot of things over the years.
00:17:33.976 - 00:18:00.794, Speaker B: It's been resilient, and I think it now would characterize it as moving slower than other protocols, rightfully so, because like the central, it's almost like when you hear Jay Powell and central banks never, are never very explicit, are never very rash, and they're, you would think, in their decision making, they're very measured and guarded. And I think in many ways that's the role that maker plays in this ecosystem.
00:18:02.414 - 00:18:36.488, Speaker A: Well, if that, and that's why in my mind, like, if I have some friends who have recently come into crypto in the last, in the last cycle, and they're like, well, why is everyone talking about maker now? I didn't hear anyone talking about maker in a bull. And maker is one of those uniquely, like, almost inversely correlated with the market type of projects where, like in bear markets, I think maker thrives because they don't get ahead of their skis in the bull. They build slowly. They have real checks and balances on governance. And so that causes maybe them to build a little slower than other folks. But what happens is they're going to be around longer than 99.9% of projects.
00:18:36.488 - 00:19:02.266, Speaker A: And that's why in the bear market, I think maker ends up doing really, really well. There's a lot of focus on them in the bull. Will their price of their token go up more than the hottest projects? Probably not, but I think that's totally fine. You mentioned it's a complicated protocol to understand. My God, it is. I think it's a barrier to entry, to folks to come in to maker's governance. I've spent so much time trying to understand maker.
00:19:02.266 - 00:19:23.604, Speaker A: You've got the PSM, you've got how DAI works, you've got real world assets, you've got the d three M providing liquidity to other protocols. You've got the DSR, the DAI savings rate, you've got now meta dies, you've got protocol owned vaults, you've got how liquidations work, you've got like the surplus reserve. It is very complicated, I must say.
00:19:24.064 - 00:20:02.374, Speaker B: No, it definitely is. I will say it's. Although I said earlier that it is a protocol that has moved slower than others, it's also charting new territory and onboarding real world assets as collateral. And I remember talking to the team almost two years ago about this, particularly accounts receivable and like working with a project called centrifuge. And now, you know, obviously they've come a long way in that, which is a controversial move. Honest. It is hard and it does pose the question of, well, what happens if that collateral is frozen? And it's really like where atoms meet bits.
00:20:02.374 - 00:21:05.346, Speaker B: And I think that, look, if they're successful, I think it will be interesting precedent on a number of fronts. One, what happens in a situation of bankruptcy and like if putting of that collateral like is not honored and where do you settle at? And you know that in and of itself. And the other one is this whole again, given the tornado situation of censorship, resistance or lack thereof. And what that really means for a quote unquote decentralized protocol. But that is perhaps moving a direction where some feel that in a version where I think governance will, will vote in and monitor what percentage and introduce a cap of what percentage of the total kind of collateral base backing Dai is these real world assets which it would never get to a point where it's like 100% or even close to that. But nonetheless, it is pretty interesting. A lot of things going on in maker recently are pretty groundbreaking, I would say.
00:21:05.530 - 00:21:24.106, Speaker A: Alright folks, this episode is brought to you by our friends at Avalanche and Ava Labs. They have just dropped a new crypto wallet called Core. You're gonna be hearing a lot about it over the coming months. You can now be one of the first to try it out. Here's the reason I'm excited to partner with them on Empire right now. Crypto wallets and browser extensions. They feel clunky.
00:21:24.106 - 00:21:52.300, Speaker A: They feel non intuitive. That's why Ava Labs built core. It's a free, non custodial browser extension that gives avalanche users a seamless and secure web3 experience across the entire avalanche ecosystem. Here are a few reasons to try core. Here's what I'm experimenting with. Number one, core has intuitive dashboards with a unified display for all of your NFT collections, all your crypto assets. You can execute asset swaps directly inside the wallet.
00:21:52.300 - 00:22:23.300, Speaker A: It's a really nice experience. Maybe you want to earn, yield or borrow against your bitcoin, but you don't want to do it on one of those c five platforms. Right now, core's native bridging functionality makes it really easy to bridge your bitcoin to avalanche's robust defi ecosystem. Last but not least, core makes unwrapping super easy. You can convert dollars to crypto right now using the moonpay integration. Just takes a few clicks. Download core today using the link in the show notes it's really, really nice.
00:22:23.300 - 00:22:41.724, Speaker A: If you are interested in the avalanche ecosystem at all, you have to be using core, download core using the link below. Now let's get back to the show. The real world asset conversation is one of the most, I think, important conversations and like biggest decisions that any protocol has ever had to make in my mind.
00:22:42.104 - 00:24:08.136, Speaker B: Yeah, it's sort of, I think there's just like two camps in crypto. One which goes back to like, the purists of maker, which have always said, and we're very critical of onboarding USCC as collateral because obviously USCC can be frozen, as it has been recently and over time. And so it's like, wait a minute, the purists have always said, let's just keep it to a collateral that is censorship resistant like Ethereum. And there's another camp that is perhaps more practical that says, how can we actually make dai really the de facto, the more popular kind of stablecoin out there? Which is what you're saying, which is you're not necessarily as focused on censorship resistance, but more so the practicality of the protocol. And I think that type of camp is always, and I sort of fall more in that camp, actually, more strictly in that camp, it says, I think Defi needs to be and will be compliant and it will be permissioned in some capacity. Like, not to say that, like, if you want to play in this really fun, really transparent, really frictionless, decentralized system, you're going to have to KYC, AML and do certain things that are important for law enforcement and regulators. But that doesn't mean like, but in order, but doing that.
00:24:08.136 - 00:24:16.824, Speaker B: First of all, you're already doing that when you go through an exchange, so nothing's really different. Of course, the criticism to all that, and my last point here is.
00:24:18.844 - 00:24:19.252, Speaker A: Open.
00:24:19.308 - 00:25:18.964, Speaker B: Question time and time again. There are some, I would say politicians, not necessarily policymakers, that have been more critical of Defi and crypto generally. And there's always that question mark of if crypto becomes really big, will people want to squash it all together? And while it remains a possibility, I continue to think that the longer that this system exists and crypto as a whole exists, the more that I think it's going to survive and exist and coexist in a world where, yeah, you could argue that bitcoin and some crypto assets are undermining the power of nation states as an alternative, non sovereign kind of store of value, if you will. I sort of think that the longer this exists, like governments would just sort of assume that it's like, just have no choice but to understand it, adopt it and work with it, and it can coexist.
00:25:20.504 - 00:26:22.338, Speaker A: I think the maybe thought for listeners to think about this weekend and just to explore is like, is that question right? Which, because I do think they're mutually exclusive. I do think they're at odds with each other, those two camps. And I think it's important to know almost really just think about, like, what camp do you fall in? Right? Like, should you. And maybe using maker as an example, like, do you basically just try to get maker to be as big as humanly possible and become, like, in the game with, like, in the c five game, right on the same level, like, onboard create vaults for, like, these big real world asset vaults. Like, work. If, you know, a big fund, a billion dollar fund wants to create a RWA vault, like, do you do it? And knowing that that maybe ends up making you more like a compliant eventually, potentially KYC AML like, platform. Do you want to go in that route, or do you want to go in the complete decentralization, completely decentralized governance at the trade off of decreasing your total addressable market?
00:26:22.506 - 00:27:33.104, Speaker B: Yeah, it is a very philosophical question. Some, maybe old timers would say, like, then what does this all matter? Like, what are we working towards? Like, what's the end goal for crypto? And, I mean, I I would be happy with a compromise where, like, you make finance more efficient and you remove friction, and there's always trade offs. You're never at a perfect decentralization. You're never at a perfect, like, are we going to be in a world where, like, you disintegrate nation states and you create network states? Well, you know, biology, I think, makes a good point around that. Like, fine. But I also think that my version of the world is one where you continue to have, like, certain governments to provide and fund certain public goods and enforce certain things. And look, you know, credit has always been enforced with the perceived, you know, threat of violence and law enforcement and, you know, but I think that my version of this is kind of like Montesquieu, which is there are currently three legs of the stool that create checks and balances within a political organization, which is a legislative, executive, and judicial.
00:27:33.104 - 00:28:53.588, Speaker B: And I think crypto, in many ways is that third one, which is, I think, what ascribe to what Balaji is saying and others are, which is ultimately, it is this idea that people can exit a system more easily and have an alternative, which is called bitcoin or ethereum or something else that creates more accountability because it's transparent, it creates more, I think, pressure on politicians and the political system to kind of honor and serve their constituents in the best manner possible. Because governments end up becoming more like corporations, it becomes a more competitive geopolitical sphere where people can migrate more easily because it can move money faster, they can move money cross border. They don't have to have and hold a local shitcoin like the turkish lira. They can actually hold something called ethereum or bitcoin, which for all intents and purposes might be more stable than 90% of all other currencies. And I think that's the, like, I would be happy with that. And like that scenario where governments kind of feel a little bit more pressure to honor their constituents and serve them to the best possible way, as opposed to trying to like, you know, be very rigid and like, exert violence and threats to control a population. And I think ultimately that would be a better world.
00:28:53.588 - 00:28:58.676, Speaker B: Not perfect, nothing ever is. But I think it would be a better world in that scenario. And I think crypto enables that.
00:28:58.780 - 00:29:31.052, Speaker A: Moving on, let's talk about another lending borrow platform in defi compound. Yes. I don't know if you followed this, but. So compound this past week executed a governance proposal that updated its chain link price feeds that contained a code error. The code error has frozen the CE. So the compound ETH borrowing and lending markets, this is how I haven't dug into it too deep, but this is how I understand it. So the code error froze the C ETH bar and lend markets users can still repay debt and add collateral to avoid liquidation.
00:29:31.052 - 00:30:05.472, Speaker A: No funds are at risk, I'm pretty sure. So there's a new governance proposal that's been put forward to revert to the formerly use price feeds. Obviously this is the obvious thing to do. You introduce a bug and then you revert the bug. But compound has what they refer to as a seven day time lock, meaning it takes seven days for a new update to be implemented. This is the second time that compound has been hurt because their governance has a seven day time lock. I don't really care about the compound thing as much.
00:30:05.472 - 00:30:13.854, Speaker A: I'm just curious to get your take on time locks and I don't know if you have any thoughts there on like if they're preferable or there's too high of a downside. What do you think there?
00:30:14.154 - 00:30:48.786, Speaker B: Yep. Yeah. I think the interesting thing here is when compound makes upgrades, anyone can submit a proposal and the code to upgrade a particular component mechanism of the protocol. In this case, the oracle price feed. And while it's pretty interesting, anyone can submit it, that proposal, and it could be passed through governance. Like there can be mistakes and bugs found. And so it is a little bit more, I think, rigid in that sense where like once the proposal passes, like, the code goes into effect.
00:30:48.786 - 00:32:04.486, Speaker B: And so, you know, yeah, it sure has a time lock. So you have seven days, but still, like, to revert, that is not as easy as perhaps like other protocols where the team can like pause stuff and like quickly patch it. And so like for context, like in October of last year, compound had another bug that made like over $100 million of comp claimable by protocol users. And it was sort of like a big, like, once that happened, like, of course some, a lot of people claimed and some sold and the team was like trying to, like, at some point even threaten, like certain users was like, hey, give back comp. And it's like, who's right and wrong in that situation? So anyways, I think this goes back to, I think, one discussion that we're having on the regulatory side, which is the immutability of the code and who can actually upgrade a particular contract. And I think where I settled with all this is, I think in this stage where there's still a lot of issues, there's still a lot of bugs in Defi. I think you can still assume that over the next five years where this is chaotic innovation, there's still going to be a lot of bugs as people try to push boundaries of innovation.
00:32:04.486 - 00:32:52.374, Speaker B: And so I think it's really important. One, yes, code should be immutable on like touching user funds. Like a team should never have the ability to upgrade a contract. Like all of a sudden be able to like migrate and drain a particular, like, in touch user funds. But I think on the periphery, I think you could argue that the team should have like at least like certain, like, you know, big red, big red eject buttons if things go wrong, like, you can pause it. And I think this is what happened here. So, yeah, this is just a reminder that, you know, this was, to be fair, this particular governance proposal and code that was implemented was audited, I think three times by three different providers and somehow like, it still malfunctioned, it still had a bug.
00:32:52.374 - 00:33:07.918, Speaker B: And so this is just a state of random. I'm happy that they were able to pause it and it sounds like no user funds were lost, but still, it's unfortunate. Just a reminder that even for a big protocol that's been around for a long time, like compound.
00:33:08.006 - 00:33:18.674, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think all these things are good when things are going well. A time lock is inherently useful except in emergencies in which it's a bug, not a feature.
00:33:19.494 - 00:33:39.974, Speaker B: Maybe it would be interesting to. The question is, how do you define a time lock if it's good or bad? You can have a time lock for new proposals, but they be deemed good upgrades and then no time block for when you need to pause and make sure that people are not hurt. It's weird because code doesn't make that distinction, you know what I mean?
00:33:40.914 - 00:34:22.394, Speaker A: Let's play this out. If you have a token, if your voting power can be bought in the open market, upgrading like security functions using voting power with that token is inherently an attack vector. If you can use that token, if you can buy that token in the open market. So maybe the takeaway is that you design emergency actions that can react to things but can't proactively rug, but that still feels like you're reacting. Yeah, yeah, maybe it's, maybe the solutions, like multi sigs with trusted signers with like limited pause and emergency action. I really don't know, actually. I really don't know.
00:34:22.394 - 00:34:31.709, Speaker A: I would love to. We should have some security experts on here to talk about like maybe folks from Openzeppelin.
00:34:31.901 - 00:35:34.426, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think the governance attack vectors are going to continue to be a thing, especially as the value in these protocols continues to go up. Say like, yeah, of course, like maybe you can't upgrade the ability to touch user funds, but maybe you introduce code that has like a malicious kind of price feed that is able to manipulate it and then you're able to drain and get away with like, you know, a lot of, a lot of the hacks and deep, a lot of the, a lot of the bugs and defi have been, and like hacks or user funds have been lost. Like cream for instance. Like this happened multiple times is when there's a faulty oracle price feed and all of a sudden like you're able to manipulate that through flash loans and you get away with like, you know, getting more of the collateral versus what, you know. So anyways, what I'm trying to say is Def has always been a very adversarial environment and so you just got to assume that like, and build multiple safe mechanisms in place to be able to react very quickly if there's an attack that's going on.
00:35:34.530 - 00:35:47.742, Speaker A: Let's, this is a maybe call to the audience if you know any good security firms. I mean the ones I would probably invite on are like trail of bits, I think does good job chain security, open zeppelin. But if there are other folks who think that they're building it, like the.
00:35:47.758 - 00:35:54.374, Speaker B: Cutting edge of even independent guys like Sam Son and a few others out there that are really good.
00:35:54.454 - 00:36:07.358, Speaker A: Yeah. Cool. What's next? What are we talking about? Arbitrum? Sure. I don't even know too much about. So here's. Arbitrum is launching nitro. I think they launched it today or yesterday.
00:36:07.358 - 00:36:19.736, Speaker A: Today. Basically, nitro is an upgrade to arbitrum that allows for exponentially higher throughput and efficiency. It went live today or yesterday. You say today. So I'll trust you on this.
00:36:19.920 - 00:36:21.416, Speaker B: Today. Today, yeah.
00:36:21.520 - 00:36:39.424, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, my understanding of. I don't know too much about this, except that it makes things cheaper and it makes, increases the throughput. That's like. And it seems I met Steven, the founder of off chain Labs, which runs Arbitrum. I met him actually at a urinal at permissionless and asked him some questions.
00:36:39.464 - 00:36:47.816, Speaker B: And he was, while on the urinal, I was like, hey, can you talk to me about optimistic roll ups? And I was like, are you Steven from Arbitrum?
00:36:47.840 - 00:37:06.488, Speaker A: He's like, yeah, what's up? I was like, I had, like, some two questions about arbitrum. It's like the smartest sounding answers I've ever heard. And I was like, okay, you seem like a big brain. I trust you here. So, I mean, hopefully, hopefully you know more about this one than I do. But I do. I do know that, yeah, it is.
00:37:06.496 - 00:37:36.524, Speaker B: I mean, arbitrum has been live for, like, a little under a year, and I think along with optimism is the two most widely. Well, I guess if you consider Polygon, but from an or optimistic roll up, l two s, arbitrum and optimism are the game, like, two names in town. And, yeah, this is a pretty big deal for them. I think they've always really liked how they've kind of methodically rolled out the protocol, and I think Nitro is a big upgrade.
00:37:37.124 - 00:37:59.532, Speaker A: Yeah. This is a good chart by Blockworks research. Sam Martin, this is arbitrum versus optimism daily transactions. And you can see optimism has been in dark purple, has been slightly higher. What is 531 for optimism? This is probably like the op token launching or something like that. But now you can see for the first time that arbitrum.
00:37:59.668 - 00:38:00.180, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
00:38:00.212 - 00:38:23.644, Speaker A: Or maybe for the second or third time, but arbitrum daily transactions are now higher. Anything else on nitro? L two season is coming. I feel like l two season came and went in the narrative, but, I mean, if you just look at the data, l two s are just month over month continuing to grow. So I think it's just like slow and steady wins the race. Long term value accrual. These tokens is going to be really interesting to watch.
00:38:24.704 - 00:39:28.516, Speaker B: Yeah, some of the more interesting questions are again, time, time again, people are like, well, doesn't this attract from the value prop of ETH? Like a lot of fees going on l two, but it's like there's still sediment happening on the l one, so you're still using the l one. So I think I've always been of the opinion that l two s are net positive and win win for the l one as well. In this case, ethereum is a base settlement layer, because everything that happens in the l two at some point needs to be reconciled and settled in the l one. And so you're just freeing up a lot of capacity at the l one, which is in this case, ethereum. And so while today people may not see it, but l two s really are going to enable kind of mainstream use cases that, if you think about all the different kind of verticals that seem to be emerging in crypto today, and it's like nfts are big, gaming will be big. Starting to see early indications of that. You know, Defi has continued to be a thing, and a lot of defi protocols have deployed on these l two s.
00:39:28.516 - 00:40:09.908, Speaker B: And so, you know, not to mention a lot of the different use cases that weren't kind of practically feasible in an l one and become much more economical. And their value prop really shines in an l two. Particularly, like, very intensive, both at the smart contract, but also in terms of frequency. Like, these are options and perpet like perps, stuff like that hasn't really been feasible in an l one like Ethereum, but there will be. If you look at what synthetics and the efficiency gains that they've had in l two optimism, it's pretty cool what's happening, and I think people may or may not be paying too much attention to that.
00:40:09.956 - 00:40:49.628, Speaker A: But yeah, yeah, here's the magic number in my mind is 2.9%, right? That's the fee that credit cards usually take is 2.9%. So if we can get gas fees plus borrow fees plus app fees, or l one settlement fees plus l one data fees plus l two fees, lower than that. Those three numbers combined, lower than 2.9%, which is credit card fees, I mean, that becomes really interesting, right? That goes back to the payment narrative of 2016 and 2015. That just kind of was probably five years too early. Seven years too early, and then we have EIP 4844 coming, which will further improve this.
00:40:49.628 - 00:40:58.584, Speaker A: Right. Which will take, you know, the meR. The merge does not lower transaction fees. L two s and EIP 4844 take care of that. So it's really exciting.
00:40:59.004 - 00:40:59.804, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:40:59.924 - 00:41:15.362, Speaker A: By the way, if folks haven't used arbitrum, I would. I would recommend bridging some assets over to Arbitrum and actually playing around with arbitrum, because it's. It's real. It's. Once you play around with Defi, with these really, really low fees, it's. You can see. You can see how it almost becomes addicting, actually.
00:41:15.362 - 00:41:38.534, Speaker A: It's like, wow, you can just cruise money. It's like you can just cruise money around in a way that you've never been able to do it before. It's really, really cool. So. All right, another borrow and lend protocol. In Defi, we've got Aave talking about Aave for the second week in a row, Aave has a new proposal to pause ETH borrowing for the period leading up to the ETH merge. It just went live on Aave's governance portal.
00:41:38.534 - 00:42:00.210, Speaker A: The upcoming merge creates new risks for the protocol is what the proposal says, and the proposal aims to ensure that Aave remains solvent by temporarily pausing ETH borrowing. I don't know if you have thoughts on this one. I know you're close to the Aave team. I don't know if you have thoughts on this proposal here, but curious to get your take.
00:42:00.402 - 00:42:59.024, Speaker B: Yeah, it's interesting. I think it raises attention to a particular vector here where, like, if two versions of ETH exist, like Ethereum and Ethereum classic, for instance, and you both. And, like, there is a possibility where, like, you know, some tokens, excluding ETH, like, whatever the other token is called, like, the proof of work chain ETH, if that's used as collateral, then that probably loses value relative to the ETH that we know, like, the proof of stake ethnic. And so some of those loans may be underwater and have to be liquidated. And so it's more of, like, even if that happens, there should be orderly liquidations, but given the magnitude of ETH, and potentially it could place some stress in the system. And I think the proposal is trying to address that to some extent. And so you never want the situation where you can't, like, liquidate these loans.
00:42:59.024 - 00:43:21.610, Speaker B: Aave solvency could be put into question, or, like, they're in the hole for that. It's like, bad debt. So I think the. I don't. It's hard to make these simulations. Like, I don't have a perfect answer to that. I haven't really thought much about it other than it's going to be pretty interesting blocks leading up to the merge and after the merge of what happens across Defi, especially these money markets.
00:43:21.610 - 00:43:34.954, Speaker B: And I think it'll be a lot of frenzied activity happening and people trying to arb this out. And so, yeah, I think it's pretty.
00:43:35.774 - 00:43:40.982, Speaker A: This is going to pass, by the way. It's 90. It's got one day left, and we've got 96% saying yes.
00:43:41.158 - 00:43:46.874, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's the right thing to just be cautious and try to head ahead of potential.
00:43:47.414 - 00:44:02.244, Speaker A: I think it's a good reminder that, like, the mer, even if the merge goes well, there's so much dependent on. There's basically all these second order implications for things that are impacted by the merge, that if protocols don't handle this right, there could. There could be some messiness around the merge. What else, my friend?
00:44:03.664 - 00:44:12.040, Speaker B: I don't know if you want to talk about macro or what's happened on that front. It's always. Macro has always been kind of a thing that I want to.
00:44:12.072 - 00:44:23.336, Speaker A: It's like, end of summer, I want to break from the macro. I'm like, don't we get one week off from macro? You know, I feel like this is the week when everyone, all the Wall street folks, we're all supposed to go out to the hamptons.
00:44:23.440 - 00:44:30.616, Speaker B: Everyone becomes like a shipping, shipping container expert. Given what's happening in the suicanna. It's like crate. It's funny to see crypto, Twitter.
00:44:30.640 - 00:44:39.164, Speaker A: Just how dependent can we get a bull run in this market, in this macro market? Or do you still think we're entirely influenced by macro right now?
00:44:39.544 - 00:44:45.144, Speaker B: No, I still think macro is at the helm here again, near term, medium term.
00:44:45.264 - 00:45:09.224, Speaker A: I do, too. I mean, I sent this tweet out, and I really strongly believe it, but I'm seeing more innovation in Defi right now than I've seen in over two years. You know that feeling in, like, late 2019 where you're seeing everything in Defi but you, you're like, man, like, why doesn't the market see what I'm seeing? Like, I just. Yeah, I think give it six more months, maybe nine more months, and the. The product momentum in DeFi is just gonna be too strong for the market to ignore.
00:45:09.644 - 00:45:24.114, Speaker B: Yeah, I did see that tweet of yours. It says, I really bullish on, on Defi. And I'm curious, do you think that Defi outperforms ethan and does it outperform other categories, like nfts and games as a category?
00:45:24.154 - 00:45:37.330, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it strongly outperforms nfts. Nfts haven't had their big bear market. They're having it right now. I think we're going in. I think we're going in it. But, like, I think it'll take longer for nfts to emerge from that than. Than Defi.
00:45:37.330 - 00:45:42.074, Speaker A: I think Defi will lead the way in the next bowl. Yeah.
00:45:42.234 - 00:45:49.234, Speaker B: Would you say that, like, nfts are, like, like, certain, like, things like collectibles and fine art and wine, which tend to be recession proof.
00:45:49.354 - 00:45:51.454, Speaker A: Are they recession proof? I don't think they're.
00:45:51.554 - 00:45:59.558, Speaker B: I know some, like, people, like, make the argument of, like, investing in, like, some of these, like, alternatives, so, no, it's wrong.
00:45:59.606 - 00:46:02.198, Speaker A: No, nfts are not recession proof. Nfts are at the farthest.
00:46:02.286 - 00:46:15.174, Speaker B: Absolutely not. Because it's like, like, most of the people that are buying these things are, like, heavily exposed to other, like, our crypto users and, like, just recycling a lot of capital. And so, yeah, it's. They feel pain in their traditional portfolio. They're going to chop nfts.
00:46:15.254 - 00:46:38.564, Speaker A: Like, you've got the risk spectrum, right? You've got, like, cash, then bonds, then high yield and hybrid securities, then property, then, like, developed market stocks, then emerging market stocks. And then, like, crypto comes in at the end of that, probably. And then, like, defi is even past ETH and bitcoin. And then nfts are, like, way, way, way out. Like, defi, like, nfts are, like, the edge of Montauk. And, like, I think people want to invest in, like, long island right now.
00:46:38.604 - 00:46:47.104, Speaker B: So, not that you're biased or anything, but sure. How big is your bag of Long island, like, apartments?
00:46:47.404 - 00:47:01.594, Speaker A: Long Island City? I mean, I feel like Long Island City is a good investment. I've gone to two weddings. Then last year. It's booming. That's all I. When we're talking about Long island, uh, Long island real estate on Empire, I think that's how, you know, uh, it's the end of the episode, I think.
00:47:01.634 - 00:47:12.018, Speaker B: So. I mean, we could. We could talk about. Well, I guess before we go, um, any interesting book recommendations or movies or documentaries or something else that's caught your eye?
00:47:12.146 - 00:47:14.610, Speaker A: No, no. I'm. I'm like.
00:47:14.762 - 00:47:17.610, Speaker B: I'm like, no, it's just too busy on my content.
00:47:17.682 - 00:47:24.472, Speaker A: Consumption is at a. At a minimum right now, I would say. I haven't watched many movies. I mean, I'm watching I'm watching the.
00:47:24.488 - 00:47:46.604, Speaker B: Wire, but, well, I will say one. I just recently read and also watched the podcast on the Knowledge podcast, I think, of Balaji on the network state, and I think it's a three hour episode podcast. I think it's worth listening to. And we're reading the book network state.
00:47:47.624 - 00:48:11.752, Speaker A: Oh, I've got one for you, Santi. I've got how to change your mind by Michael Pollan. It's a book. Michael Pollan's a great author, and he writes about the impact of caffeine. He wrote one book on the impact of caffeine and the impact of plants on your body, but he wrote one called how to change your mind about psychedelics. And for folks who don't want to read the book, they should watch. It just came out on Netflix.
00:48:11.752 - 00:48:14.164, Speaker A: It's like a four part series or six part series.
00:48:16.904 - 00:48:21.044, Speaker B: This is sort of like the idea that, like, some psychedelics increase neuroplasticity.
00:48:21.384 - 00:48:39.488, Speaker A: Yeah, you should watch it. I mean, I'm an episode and a half in. I also read the book. It's like, what psychedelics teach us. It's not just about neuroplasticity and health. It's like, what psychedelics can teach us about, like, depression and addiction and consciousness and. Yeah, yeah.
00:48:39.616 - 00:48:45.092, Speaker B: It's crazy to think that, like, psychedelics, nuclear energy and crypto, what is the common denominator?
00:48:45.248 - 00:48:48.664, Speaker A: All three, I believe in all three of them. I don't know.
00:48:49.684 - 00:48:55.052, Speaker B: Misunderstood, stigmatized, and probably warned further research at minimum.
00:48:55.148 - 00:49:06.932, Speaker A: I mean, the tweet of the week, by the way, too, was. That was the nuclear meme. It was a guy, you know, the. There's two buttons meme. Yeah. And there was a guy, and it was like, you know, the guy sweating at the bottom. And it's.
00:49:06.932 - 00:49:32.338, Speaker A: It was Europe. It was like, Europe is sweating, and he's, like, debating. Europe is debating which button to press, and one button says, turn on the nuclear power plants, and the other button says, starve, but stay woke. And I feel like Europe is really, like, do I stay woke? Appeal to the, like, you know, the woke crowd, or, like, do I turn on the nuclear power plants and, like, save our country? And you're up sweating right now trying to figure that out.
00:49:32.466 - 00:49:39.410, Speaker B: Everyone go and check out the great episode that we recorded with Josh Wolf from Lux Capital.
00:49:39.562 - 00:49:43.840, Speaker A: Josh Wolfe. Well, we'll throw that in the show notes. It's so good. Yeah.
00:49:43.992 - 00:50:04.016, Speaker B: Fantastic. Talks about nuclear energy, a topic that we feel strongly about in this episode, in this crowd. And, yeah, I mean, unfortunately, crises are moments where hopefully people, like, unravel themselves from, like, old hell dogmas and stigmas and realize, like, there's a way forward, then it doesn't have to be as dependent and hard.
00:50:04.040 - 00:50:13.484, Speaker A: I feel like we're fitting into a stereotype right now, talking about nuclear psychedelics and crypto. We have to throw in longevity, and then we'll just just. We'll have the. We'll be on, like.
00:50:15.384 - 00:50:28.844, Speaker B: Don'T get me started on that. I think this is the queue to end the episode. Everyone out there, have fun out there and enjoy if you're in the northern hemisphere, whatever that means.
00:50:30.264 - 00:50:35.924, Speaker A: All right, everyone, have a good. Have a good September, have a good rest of the week. Good weekend. We'll see you. See you next week.
00:50:35.984 - 00:50:36.204, Speaker B: Thanks, everyone.
