00:00:00.320 - 00:00:07.302, Speaker A: This episode is brought to you by BitMex, the OG crypto exchange that is back and better than ever. You'll hear more about Bitmex later in the show.
00:00:07.438 - 00:00:19.526, Speaker B: I thought after this last bull market that we brought more people over that had fully gone. But I think many people who dipped their toes and got in in this cycle just kind of were like, yeah, I believe in it.
00:00:19.630 - 00:00:22.342, Speaker A: Here's my money. Please go up. Please go up.
00:00:22.398 - 00:00:45.630, Speaker B: And now that it's gone down, they're like, I knew this was a freaking scam, you know, like, I like all the people that I talked to in my life, you know, for the last 18 months. I got used to this. I was like, oh, you work in crypto? Oh, that's very cool. And now they're like, crypto. Well, you knew it was going to come down, didn't you? Like, wink, wink, nudge, nudge. And it's like, all right, man. All right, well, and my, and ultimately, like, for folks who do have, this is why you can't borrow someone else's conviction.
00:00:45.630 - 00:00:49.342, Speaker B: So what I'll say is, thanks for two more years of head start.
00:00:49.438 - 00:00:49.774, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:00:49.814 - 00:00:51.992, Speaker B: You know, before everyone else comes back in.
00:00:52.078 - 00:01:22.462, Speaker A: So happy Friday, everybody. I am here joined by my co founder, Mister Mike Polito. Santiago is on a big vacation, actually, right now. He is doing what we should all be doing in the bear market, which is taking a step back, taking a quick breather. So last week we were joined by Byron, and today we are joined by Mister Mike Ibalido, my co founder of four years and one of my long time good buddies. So, Mike, welcome to Empire.
00:01:22.598 - 00:01:24.838, Speaker B: That was a very touching, that was very touching.
00:01:24.966 - 00:01:28.390, Speaker A: I appreciate that, buddies. You know, I was going to make a joke.
00:01:28.422 - 00:01:32.366, Speaker B: I was going to say, give Mark Usko a nice adjective every week, and here I am. I'm touched by that.
00:01:32.390 - 00:01:33.966, Speaker A: There's your adjective, good buddy.
00:01:33.990 - 00:01:34.246, Speaker B: Here.
00:01:34.310 - 00:01:40.030, Speaker A: I don't have what Mark, I don't have what Mark has, which is, does Mark still do the socks? At the beginning of every episode, I.
00:01:40.062 - 00:01:50.928, Speaker B: Told Mark that we will know the show has made it when the market moves, depending on what socks he shows. So if he shows bullish socks and the market goes up, that's the sign that the podcast has made it. We can quit right now.
00:01:50.936 - 00:01:56.328, Speaker A: See, I don't have socks. I have hats. People send me a lot of hats because I used to wear that blockworks hat. Here, check it out.
00:01:56.416 - 00:02:00.688, Speaker B: Yeah, I wish I could be a hack. I just don't look good on my head. I got a weird shaped head look.
00:02:00.696 - 00:02:12.080, Speaker A: At how many hats I have. Just like that people send me. I've got, I've got meow. Sent me a hat. I've got, look at this. I've got the one that pomp was pushing. 2020 sucks hat.
00:02:12.080 - 00:02:19.786, Speaker A: I've got this, like, superhuman. Send me a hat. I've got a, oh, this is a maple finance has a very good swagger. Maple finance is a hat I like.
00:02:19.930 - 00:02:25.514, Speaker B: So I didn't know that I should be offended by not getting these hats, but now that I know I'm not getting hats, I'm offended.
00:02:25.674 - 00:02:30.818, Speaker A: We get swagged, like every week. Dana is very unhappy about it. I can imagine.
00:02:30.866 - 00:02:35.722, Speaker B: Yeah, I can imagine. She's not swagged. But don't worry, I'm inside. Then she'll be, yeah, exactly.
00:02:35.778 - 00:02:57.808, Speaker A: Exactly. All right, man, this will be a fun episode. Here's what I would like to talk about, but as usual, I'm sure this will divulge into a bunch of, we'll end up spiraling into a bunch of random topics. But here's what I'd like to cover. Down rounds, hiring freezes, layoffs. That's, I think, where we should start. Optimism like quote unquote, lost 20 million op tokens over kind of a wallet mishap with wintermute.
00:02:57.808 - 00:03:27.654, Speaker A: We should talk about that. We'll touch briefly on the ETH testnet merge success. I'd like to talk about the salesforce NFT marketplace that they launched. And then there's one other topic that I think is interesting if you want to chat about, which is Dow treasuries and just how dows are starting to respond to this bear market. So bunch of big topics, I think. Let's start with down rounds, layoffs, hiring freezes, hiring freezes at Coinbase and Gemini. Coinbase was rescinding offers.
00:03:27.654 - 00:04:08.476, Speaker A: Blockfi. It got announced that Blockfi recently raised at a $3 billion valuation. At one point they were talking about getting raising at a $5 billion valuation led by Dan Loeb before some regulatory stuff came out. And now it has come out that they are. I don't think this is final, but that they're raising at a billion dollar valuation, which would be an 80% discount to the $5 billion round that was considering that they considered raising, and then the $3 billion 67% haircut to the $3 billion round. So I would like your take on just what are your thoughts on these down rounds, hiring freezes, rescinding offers. What's your take?
00:04:08.620 - 00:04:45.754, Speaker B: Yeah, well, maybe it would be helpful for listeners who we can put you in almost what the, uh, exec team at blockworks as the discussions that we're having internally. And then like, you can just extrapolate this across what I would say responsible companies, right. I don't think it takes a genius to look out at the market and say the environment, the business environment that we're going to be operating in over the next twelve to 18 months is going to look very differently from the last twelve to 18 months. So the way business planning typically works is you do forecasting. You know, I have a big problem with that phrase. It's actually target setting, right? So we say we want to be at this revenue by the end of the year. We know it's going to cost x amount to get to this revenue.
00:04:45.754 - 00:05:20.766, Speaker B: So you start to kind of reverse engineer from that forecast or that target. So say you want to be, you know, do 40 million in revenue by the end of the year. You say, okay, I'm going to get it this way, this way and this way through all these different product lines. I need to hire this amount of people, I need to budget this amount of GNA, and I'm going to make this much money. What companies are doing right now is they're saying, shoot, I don't know if that target that I thought I was going to get to at the end of the year is going to be 40 million, maybe it's actually only going to be 30 million. Okay, now I got to reverse engineer my entire cost structure into fewer people. Uh, you know, like less spending on GNA, all of that kind of stuff.
00:05:20.766 - 00:05:57.510, Speaker B: So that's basically what's happening across the industry right now. And that's why you're starting to see things like hiring freezes happen. Uh, and what that's what that's greek for is that we just don't know what the end of this year and the end of next year is going to look like. So what we want to do is we want to wait for our revenue baseline to reset to something where it's like, okay, I'm not generating four or $5 million a month. I'm generating $3 million a month, and then I can start to reverse engineer everything in place. So that's why everything feels so uncertain right now. That's why you keep seeing this phrase like hiring freeze, and companies are going to cut, um, what variable costs they have, right? So it's like fixed and variable costs in companies.
00:05:57.510 - 00:06:25.716, Speaker B: Fixed cost is like infrastructure that you have. If you're a software company, you can't not build your software right. That's, like, pretty important. Uh, if you have an office that's like fixed costs, depending. And so then there's all these fixed costs and then there are variable costs like marketing, honestly, certain lines of personnel and basically any extraneous spent. So they're going to start cutting that down. Rounds are very painful because down runs are probably going to continue to happen.
00:06:25.716 - 00:06:37.148, Speaker B: It's almost, you know how I feel about blockfi. I'm a huge fan of this company. I feel like they've gotten a lot of negative press for pretty unjustified reasons recently. And so, unfortunately, I feel like they're the poster child of this right now. But they're not the only ones.
00:06:37.196 - 00:06:37.404, Speaker A: Right?
00:06:37.444 - 00:06:55.140, Speaker B: I don't want to call it any specific companies, but basically, just look at any company that Tiger poured money into over the last year in crypto and take a look at their valuations and how quick it took to get there. And pretty quickly you're going to come up with a list of very richly valued companies. And I think this is not going to be isolated to blockfi in general.
00:06:55.252 - 00:07:13.524, Speaker A: I think it's important to remember it's not just isolated to crypto. Right. If you just zoom out the bigger market, let's look at maybe the October prices of some of these companies compared to today. Instacart, $39 billion. Now they're at 22. It's almost a 50% haircut. Epic Games, 46 to 31.
00:07:13.524 - 00:07:27.364, Speaker A: Chime down from 25 billion valuation to 15 billion. Go puff. 17 to eight. Right. Klarna, 45 to 30. These are all 33 to 50, sometimes 75% haircuts. Canva.
00:07:27.364 - 00:07:53.838, Speaker A: Right, 40 to 27. These are all massive, massive haircuts. And I think what you're starting to see is it all starts in the public markets, right? And then it just starts pulling back to the late stage, the series D, the series C. And eventually that trickles down, uh, to the, you know, series B and series A. And then eventually I think the seed rounds will be fine. Those will still get raised. Uh, you'll just see big haircuts on, like, the initial raises instead of the 60, $70 million pre product seed round.
00:07:53.838 - 00:08:14.178, Speaker A: You'll see, you know, kind of what's normal, 10, 15, 20. Um, but I think one of the important parts here is it puts the leverage back in the. In the VC's hands, right, instead of in the founders hands. You were seeing these insane deals go through where, uh, no VC's in the entire round. Nobody gets a board seat, right. The. The liquidation preferences were all screwy.
00:08:14.178 - 00:08:22.906, Speaker A: Basically, founders just had their pick of the litter of what VC's they wanted to invest to allocate into their round. And now those dynamics completely shift completely.
00:08:23.010 - 00:08:49.802, Speaker B: And I think that's what's one of the most like. There are two very painful things about. So think about what has to happen in terms of down rounds for down runs actually take place. It's really violating everyone's incentives, right? Because unlike public markets, price gets set. Price discovery happens in private markets just by different rounds of VC investors. And everyone wants, because they want to point to, for their next fundraise, they want to point to the unicorns that they had in their previous fundraise. They really want that valuation to keep going up.
00:08:49.802 - 00:09:33.364, Speaker B: The founders really want that valuation to keep going up. The employees who are getting compensated in rsus or whatever, they're getting compensated, they all want that to go up. So for there to be a down round, the business really has to change pretty materially. And the other thing too is you were starting to talk about just different layers of the capital stack. Most investors, most good VC's will insist on liquidation preferences or non dilutive covenants. So when there is a down round, their equity essentially gets protected and founders and employees get diluted when they have to raise at a lower valuation, to the effect that many employees actually have their options completely wiped out or very close to it. That's why it's painful.
00:09:33.364 - 00:09:50.624, Speaker B: And it's also painful from a psychological standpoint. Like, you go to work at a startup because you feel like you're moving towards a goal and part of a team, and even though it's kind of hectic and all over the place, you're still like moving up to go through all of that at a startup and then only to have it go down psychologically painful.
00:09:50.664 - 00:10:24.664, Speaker A: Right. No, I think you make two good points there. There's the capital stack, which is founders and employees will inevitably give up more ownership. And these anti dilution clauses that the VC's have put in mean that previous investors with preferred shares are given these increased conversion rates to avoid dilution, which ends up meaning that the owners and the employees get diluted even more. And then on the confidence side and the psychology side, lower confidence, lower employee morale, lower, maybe even founder morale. Yeah. These liquidation preferences continued to make it kind of just much harder to get to this.
00:10:24.664 - 00:10:49.424, Speaker A: Like, to see the promised land per se. Right. So I think it's quite tough. Yeah, no, but I think a lot of this actually happens. I don't know. Like, I do wonder how if maybe it's on some of the founders to blame for this, actually. And here's where I'd go with this, is you were just seeing some of these rounds get raised six to twelve months ago.
00:10:49.424 - 00:11:14.486, Speaker A: You just knew these were overvalued. It's like these $10 billion. I'm not going to call anyone out, but like 510 billion dollars. These companies launched products like a year or two ago. Right. And I think you kind of have two options when you're raising capital. Uh, in a really, like, bull market, you can either do what is effectively a down round preemptively, when you don't have to, by just underpricing what the current round in the market is.
00:11:14.486 - 00:11:28.678, Speaker A: Um, so, so let's use an example like we company raises at a billion dollars. Then in November of 2021, the market's raging bull market. They get an offer to raise at 10 billion. They know that that's overvalued. Right. They know that that's crazy. Overvalued.
00:11:28.678 - 00:11:49.694, Speaker A: They could preemptively, it's not technically a down run, but like, they could raise. They could say, we don't want to raise it ten. We think that's overvalued. We want to actually raise it five or 6 billion. Right. That's like preemptively a down round kind of. Maybe it shouldn't be called a down run, but like, they are setting the prices lower than the highest possible price they can get to set themselves up better in the future.
00:11:49.694 - 00:12:20.316, Speaker A: I don't think folks did that. I think instead, folks basically just accepted the market price and said, let's shoot for as high of a price as we can possibly get, which then risks, if, you know, if you don't hit your milestones or the market turns, which it did, then a lot of them are risking a down round. So I think I'd throw turn this into a question and say, how many companies do you think will need to raise a down round here, if you have a bucket of 100 crypto companies, ten raise a down round. 20, raise a down round. Do you have any data points to back this up?
00:12:20.460 - 00:12:47.760, Speaker B: Yeah. Let me just address the first thing you said about it being there are three. There are three stakeholders, right? There are investors, there are founders, and they're employees. I think everyone was kind of behaving a little irresponsibly, if not just maybe naively. Right? So like to walk it down, right? Like that founder example you used. I totally agree. I also think that's kind of a move that more experienced founders, or at least second time founders would have to do, having the discipline to not take that money at not the highest valuation.
00:12:47.760 - 00:13:07.554, Speaker B: Like, we're sitting here saying that, oh, obviously they shouldn't have done that. I think maybe nine months ago would have been a very different conversation. So I think you're totally right. But I think that's more of a reflection of the lack of mature founders in crypto, despite how far we've come in terms of attracting talent. Um, I think there's also something to be said for investors that we're throwing. Throwing money at these valuations. Right.
00:13:07.554 - 00:13:09.930, Speaker B: Like, they are the ones who are supposed to be disciplined.
00:13:10.002 - 00:13:10.370, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:13:10.442 - 00:13:15.234, Speaker B: Also. Right. But it kind of takes two to tango. Right. Takes two parties to set a valuation, a buyer and a seller.
00:13:15.274 - 00:13:15.498, Speaker A: Right.
00:13:15.546 - 00:13:34.996, Speaker B: So there's that, and then there's the. The employees who. Who took equity at those valuations. And you kind of can't have it both ways. Right. Like, a lot of the mantra in crypto is, like, let people assume their own financial responsibility. If you want to assume the financial responsibility and you're taking money from, like, you just watch the equity of this company or these tokens.
00:13:34.996 - 00:14:20.948, Speaker B: Like, how many times did you and I have this conversation where we lost people because they just got some, like, three or $4 million token equity package and we were like, that could go down 90% less often times. And it has. And they knew the risks, too. So I think everyone is kind of complicit here in terms of target setting. How many people are vulnerable to this? I think it's really hard to benchmark because the counter to what we're saying is that still a lot of money has come into this ecosystem. I think it will be more about dispersion, and the good companies that raised at fair valuations will be fine and attract most of that capital. And then I think you could also do a down round, or I think most founders will just try to push it off and kind of give themselves time.
00:14:20.948 - 00:14:29.540, Speaker B: They'll try to grow into their valuation over time, and if they can not raise for that, then I think they'll prefer to do that. But what that will mean is that they're going to fire people.
00:14:29.612 - 00:14:48.876, Speaker A: I mean, the goal for everyone right now is do not raise a down round. That is the biggest goal and just survive. Everyone's in survival mode right now. And I agree there'll be a dispersion between good and great. Maybe less focused on the valuation to determine good versus great, but the amount of, basically, it comes down to your margins. And how much cash do you have? Right. Like someone like Opensea, insanely high margins.
00:14:48.876 - 00:15:09.470, Speaker A: They were printing hundreds of million. Like, I think they did 350 or 400 million in revenue in January of this year alone with super high margins. So, like, someone like that will be just fine. Even though they did raise at a ridiculously high valuation, they'll be just fine. Um, and it's a good opportunity for someone like that who has a bunch of cash on hand to maybe do some acquisitions or. Or scoop up really good talent.
00:15:09.582 - 00:15:14.430, Speaker B: So with you on that, I like, because just think about it from the perspective of someone who's making that decision. You've got to.
00:15:14.462 - 00:15:14.646, Speaker A: Let's.
00:15:14.670 - 00:15:42.076, Speaker B: Let's say you are not, because the. I think the ones that are really in trouble are these businesses that were, like 10 million in ARR or whatever and raised at $100 billion valuations. Doesn't matter how much you cut. Like, you're so far off sides, it's just there's nothing you can really do. But let's say you're an opensea, a blockfi, one of these exchanges that generates actually a lot of revenue, and you actually do have the ability to cut costs. So you could say, all right, we know this is not going to be a permanent state of affairs. Right.
00:15:42.076 - 00:16:08.364, Speaker B: We just need to get to the next twelve months, 18 months, 24 months, however long this winter lasts. So you've got two decisions. I could either keep operating like I'm doing now and risk a down round where I have to wipe out my employees equity, destroy morale, do all this stuff, or I could just take a cut right now, trim the fat, be more disciplined, and try to get there and grow into this valuation. That was probably high, but I could probably grow into it in two years. You're choosing that every single time.
00:16:08.864 - 00:16:29.020, Speaker A: One important thing to remember is that when companies raise up rounds, there is a good round. It's a healthy market. They want to get their pr out, they want to do marketing around it. Right? We raised it 100 million. Now we just raised it a billion. Things are going well. I think there's going to be a lot of companies that raise down rounds, but they will do it incredibly quietly.
00:16:29.020 - 00:16:47.962, Speaker A: And it's just important to remember, you don't have to announce your round, and when you raise a down round, you're doing everything possible not to make that known. So just important to remember that. Yep. We talked about the founders raising. We talked about employees. Right. I think a lot of employees, their rsus might be way underwater, but there are hiring freezes across.
00:16:47.962 - 00:17:09.330, Speaker A: Across the industry, so maybe they actually can't leave, even though their rsus are way underwater. We didn't talk as much about the investors. Um, there was a recent Bloomberg article. Mike Novogratz was quoted saying, there are literally 1900 crypto hedge funds. My guess is two thirds will go out of business. Uh, seems a little exaggerated to me in terms of. I mean, I mean, I guess he'd have the numbers.
00:17:09.330 - 00:17:17.344, Speaker A: They have. They acquired Vision Hill. They would know the numbers. But 1900 crypto hedge funds and 66 going out of business. What are your thoughts around this?
00:17:17.884 - 00:17:40.254, Speaker B: I think crypto is a very loose definition of what a hedge fund is. That's what I think. It's just crazy how similar this is to 2018. It was like, remember, there were so many people that, like, put ten grand in, they wound up with, like, 5 million. They're like, I'm going to start a fund. You know, and then they just signed up for a crypto hedge fund. I think probably the level of professionalism in funds is.
00:17:40.254 - 00:18:00.142, Speaker B: Has gone way up. But again, I think this will be a culling of the herd. I don't have enough insight to be like, is it two thirds? Is it one third? Whatever. They're going to be way less, let's put it like that. But I think the ones that are fine or that are good will continue to do extremely well. Like the multi coins, the paradigms, the panteras, the paraphies, whatever, and they'll continue to excel, I think.
00:18:00.278 - 00:18:19.992, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. I think there's some everyone was talking about when terra happened. Like, these funds are going to blow up, right? It. It takes a lot for a fun to blow up. I think what actually just happens is that they're so underwater, um, and so below their watermark, that it just is going to take so much to get back there that it's better to close shop and do it. Do it over again.
00:18:20.128 - 00:18:55.294, Speaker B: I agree. Oh, one other thing, though, that I've got a prediction for you, um, that I think will play out over time. Is that right now, like, all the rage this last cycle was liquid venture, and, like, that's the right thing to be. And you had these funds, like, the three arrows of the world, uh, or whatever, that I was kind of trying to play, like, the hedge fund game and the venture investing game at the same time. I think those are very separate skill sets, and I think those eventually will segment out and be different things over a period of time. And the reason that I think that is because, like, remember that example? Remember the scuff that Suzu and Kane got into?
00:18:55.414 - 00:18:56.174, Speaker A: Oh, this is a good example.
00:18:56.214 - 00:19:32.674, Speaker B: And it was. That was weird looking at that as a founder, because I actually agreed with Suzuki that to rehash this, this was the argument about Ethereum abandoning its users. And then that kind of led to some ad hominem attacks and Suzu kind of implied like they were, you know, glorifying founders in the space and blah, blah, blah. And I remember actually agreeing with Suzu, but also decide at the same time, if we ever had to raise money, I would not raise it from Suzu because I think it's a very different mentality, um, a trader versus an investor. They're just super different things. And we all make fun of the VC's, all this touchy feely bullshit. But building a company is full of touchy feely bullshit.
00:19:32.674 - 00:19:53.570, Speaker B: And sometimes what you really need more than anything is to someone to be like, I'm on your side. I'm in it for the long haul. I'm going to hold your hand. And traders are not like that. They're just not like that. So I just think these, like, liquid venture funds that try to do the hedge fund thing and the VC thing, they're either going to need to create a really strong firewall internally in the organization, or they're just going to split. Because I think good founders would rather take money from VC's than hedge funds.
00:19:53.602 - 00:19:57.494, Speaker A: Completely agree. Yeah. Suzu's like, what did I ever do to you, Mike?
00:19:57.994 - 00:19:59.170, Speaker B: What did I do to you?
00:19:59.242 - 00:20:00.134, Speaker A: Sorry, man.
00:20:00.994 - 00:20:01.906, Speaker B: I'm a stan, dude.
00:20:01.930 - 00:20:02.778, Speaker A: I listen to the opinions.
00:20:02.826 - 00:20:07.082, Speaker B: I agree with many of them, but I also. So it's like, you know, I don't know.
00:20:07.218 - 00:20:53.590, Speaker A: Well, there's another interesting thing on just public versus privates, which is just the mass overweight, just like the amount of capital that's flowed in and just the amount of interest that's flowed into the private markets over the last two years has basically made it so that the public markets have been ignored, I think, and that the opportunities is pretty hard to lose money in 2020 or 2021. If you allocated into like a seed or a series a or even a series B company, like, you probably weren't going to be underwater on your investment. And so, so much capital flowed into the private side of things. Now you're. I'm just looking at these private prices like layer zero. I really like the layer Zero team. They don't have much.
00:20:53.590 - 00:21:24.922, Speaker A: Like they're pretty early stage. They raised a $3 billion valuation. I'm looking at Aave, right? Aave is like one of the best products in all of crypto. They're sitting at a 1.5 billion fully diluted. So, like, would I rather invest in something that's illiquid at 3 billion, that, like, doesn't really have many users or market share or something? That, like, is pretty, uh. It has almost become like a utility in crypto because of how much it's used at a billion and a half, taking the billion and a half all day long.
00:21:24.922 - 00:21:27.866, Speaker A: So I think a lot of the interest flips back to the public side soon.
00:21:28.050 - 00:22:06.066, Speaker B: Me too. I think what happened there is twofold, which is one, everyone wanted exposure to this asset class, and the way that the more institutional side of the market could get exposure, they couldn't put liquid tokens on their balance sheet, the most of them. So they got it through venture. They can buy equity in a startup that happens to be in crypto. That's just a much safer way for them to do it. At the same time that was happening, the way that the public side of crypto, the liquid token side, was growing its user base was by issuing equity to the public. And now that's completely flipped because that's essentially continuous sell pressure on each one of those networks, because the way that they grow is by bringing more supply of their equity online.
00:22:06.066 - 00:22:23.442, Speaker B: So they're basically just, there's a continuous sell bid. So at the same time, there's that dynamic going on in public crypto markets. There was this bottleneck effect going on in private markets, and eventually someone will try to close that spread, or somehow those things will move together. But now I agree, it's huge dislocation.
00:22:23.498 - 00:22:45.582, Speaker A: I mean, end of the day, it's market, and we'll find the equilibrium. There's one other thing that people don't talk about with private versus public. There is one of the reasons people love to do privates is the ego. It's just the ego play of saying, I gotten that deal. You get your, oh, we just raised a series a, we just raised a seed, you know, blah, blah, blah. Like you're in it and your name's on twitter. It's.
00:22:45.582 - 00:23:12.516, Speaker A: I can tell you from just being in all these group chats with all these angels, ego move there. And even on the venture side, these big professional venture funds talking to some of the gps there, it's like when they aren't in a deal, even if it's a bad deal, they're getting texts from their lp saying, why weren't we in that deal? What's up with that? When you buy something on the public markets, like, it's not sexy. No, one knows. Like, I'm not. No one's. If I buy Aave, like, I guess it's on chain, but. But nobody knows.
00:23:12.516 - 00:23:13.932, Speaker A: So you could tweet it.
00:23:13.948 - 00:23:14.864, Speaker B: I'd like it.
00:23:15.724 - 00:23:22.540, Speaker A: My tweets are hurting these days. Your tweets are hurting? Tweets are hurting right now.
00:23:22.612 - 00:23:23.556, Speaker B: I've been here.
00:23:23.660 - 00:23:37.900, Speaker A: This is where I feel like living right now. This is where I've been living. Like you. All right, let's get past some of this. Let's talk about. So we talked about founders, investors, and employees and the kind of response to the bear market. There's a fourth bucket, which is daos.
00:23:37.900 - 00:24:21.114, Speaker A: Right now, there are a bunch of proposals from different daos like Lido and Fay and frax that talk about their response to the bear market. And so let me just run through a couple of these. Lido has a proposal for the Dow to sell $17 million of ethnic to, quote, prepare for the bear market. The fay dao has a proposal to sell off a little over 2 million in curve convex, tokamak, Aave and compound in exchange for stablecoins. And then there's a frax proposal by Sam, who started Frax to buy. I think it's to buy up to $20 million worth of Frax. Kind of a show of confidence, but this is just dow starting to prep for the bear market.
00:24:21.114 - 00:24:23.414, Speaker A: What's your thoughts on this?
00:24:23.534 - 00:25:01.530, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that dows were just behind here, and many companies were behind. Actually, a lot of companies did a pretty good job with this. So in general, like, when valuations are high, that's when you want to raise capital, and then when valuations are low, that should get you through the less good phases. Right, of the business cycle. So, actually, do you remember, like, we actually talked about this when Coinbase, you know, for all the flack that they're getting recently, remember, like, six months before, sometime last year, they raised a billion and a half dollars in debt. And you and I at that time were like, damn, that's like signposts, right, that we may be near at the top because good companies, like well run companies that understand financing, will, like, sell at the top. I think what's happening with.
00:25:01.530 - 00:25:24.514, Speaker B: With DAos is that they're just newer organizations. I mean, Daos are. You and I are both very bullish on it, but they've got a lot to figure out, right? They're, like, not only trying to build and ship products, but they're literally reinventing the wheel of how companies and governance should work. I personally think they're trying to reinvent it too much. But, uh, so they've just, you know, as a result, uh, because they're kind of immature organizations. They probably don't think as much about like, financing.
00:25:24.594 - 00:25:24.978, Speaker A: Right.
00:25:25.066 - 00:25:43.252, Speaker B: Um, so I just think they're kind of late to the boat here and they'll eventually, they'll realizing like, oh shit, we can't have all of our treasuries either in our native token or things that are correlated 95% to our native token. Yeah, you know, so I think you're going to continue to do this. What do you think about the fracs? The frac spy?
00:25:43.308 - 00:26:23.094, Speaker A: Well, just one, one comment there. I just got such flashbacks to 2017 or actually really early 2018 when all the ICos were selling off their ETH saying we might be going into a down market. ETH isn't up only and we need to pay for things. It's going to have pretty, I think it'll have a pretty negative impact on the market, actually. Just because a lot of these Daos have their treasuries are primarily like USDC ETH and then their native token. So if you're selling off a bunch of your native token and they're like, maybe isn't that much liquidity in the market for it, this will have a pretty negative pressure downwards. So that's something to just keep in mind there.
00:26:23.094 - 00:26:45.886, Speaker A: I think this is a call. We have an episode coming out. I had a really interesting episode with Tom and Haseeb from Dragonfly, and it comes out this Monday. So in a couple of days they talked about just one of the things that they're most excited about in the bear market is better capital market tools for daos, like convertible bonds, for example. And that's one thing. Like you mentioned Coinbase. Coinbase, yeah.
00:26:45.886 - 00:27:08.374, Speaker A: They raised, I think they raised $2 billion, actually. They announced like a billion and a half debt round, and then they increased it to just a debt offering of 2 billion. And this was back in September of 2021 that you can't do that if you're like a protocol. You can't raise debt if you're a protocol. Right now, there's just no real way, I would say. But I think that's something that really gets built out in this bear market.
00:27:08.794 - 00:27:27.426, Speaker B: I completely agree with you, especially because some of these organizations will have been around now for like a couple years. Right in the beginning, it makes a lot of sense to take venture, or, sorry, like equity type funding, right. That's why venture is done in equity. But then after they get big enough and solid, like it probably makes sense to do some debt financing like that should be available to them.
00:27:27.530 - 00:27:52.300, Speaker A: Yeah. And, oh, man. I mean, you'll have to listen to the episode on Monday. But Tom was talking about, Tom Schmidt at Dragonfly was talking about how it's actually a really, really efficient debt system. Because if you're, uh, if you're a Dow and you've got, you're basically spitting off fees, you can use those fees to directly go back and pay back the, the debt issuance. So there's really no, like, debt middleman here. Um, and it just creates a very efficient debt system.
00:27:52.492 - 00:27:53.580, Speaker B: Yeah, I agree.
00:27:53.692 - 00:27:54.420, Speaker A: The fracs that.
00:27:54.452 - 00:28:13.772, Speaker B: So at the same time that. Right. You've got Lido and Faye talking about diversifying their treasuries. I think. What was it that Sam, they just did a $20 million buy of the native Frax token. Here's what. I'll caveat this by saying Sam knows his business much better than I do.
00:28:13.772 - 00:28:47.604, Speaker B: I'm not an expert on fracs. There are probably dynamics of running a stable coin like that, where confidence is a much more important thing that I'm giving credence. There might be some reserve aspect here that I'm saying, but I think the framework to be looking at buys of tokens by their own protocol should be the same framework that shareholder buybacks are looked at in public markets. And that is, it's a capital allocation decision. So companies have three decisions when it comes to capital allocation. Invest in your own organic growth, like build products and services internally. Buy it m and a.
00:28:47.604 - 00:29:10.132, Speaker B: Buy a company or something that can do that thing for you. Or C. Door number three, return capital to shareholders. And the way they do that is by share buybacks. So buybacks and their shares, they'll jack up the price, in theory, of the existing shares. And it's a tax efficient way to return capital in general. When you are buying shares of a company, what you're saying is, I don't have a better use.
00:29:10.132 - 00:29:48.728, Speaker B: I can't put this capital to work in my own organization and generate returns above what I think I can get in the market for my own shares. So when I see whatever protocols that are doing this again, it might be different again, because Frax is a stable coin, and there are like, reserve and confidence things that might come into play that I'm not understanding. What you're saying to investors is I'm giving you some money back because I can't otherwise better spend this on products and services. I think it's pretty early in the crypto ecosystem for any companies to be saying that?
00:29:48.776 - 00:29:48.984, Speaker A: Right?
00:29:49.024 - 00:29:59.894, Speaker B: I think most of these protocols should be like, okay, could I take that x million dollars and hire developers and like, ship X many more features this year? Like, that's how I'd be thinking about it.
00:30:00.834 - 00:30:24.740, Speaker A: I don't know as much about fracks, like just this specific $20 million buyback. I'll be honest, I don't want to talk about that too much. But I completely agree with you. When I see companies in crypto buying back their own token, there's so many other things that you should be spending that on. Stop worrying about the price of your token. And I think maybe one of the triggers, like psychologically for fracs is FX. FXS just fell out of the top 100 on coingecko, right.
00:30:24.740 - 00:30:31.956, Speaker A: So now it's no longer a top 100 coin. Like, if I'm running fracks, that's a psychologically, that would kind of suck to see, you know.
00:30:32.140 - 00:30:33.540, Speaker B: I know, I know.
00:30:33.612 - 00:30:49.736, Speaker A: It's just. No, no, I'm agreeing with you. I don't think that I'm saying that should not be a reason that you buy back your shouldn't be, dude. Yeah. It's like if Amazon Price falls like 30%, like, I don't think Bezos is stepping in and buying the token, the Amazon stock back up. He's investing in AWS, you know, so.
00:30:49.820 - 00:31:07.848, Speaker B: No, maybe personally, right? Sometimes you see this with executives or CEO's or founders at times when their company is struggling, they're like, I'm personally buying more equity or whatever, or I'm increasing my stake or taking more stock based compensation or whatever, but I do not think it should happen at the company or the protocol.
00:31:07.896 - 00:31:21.204, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, Fred Ursham, like Fred just did this. He purchased a million dollars of Coinbase. The Coinbase co founder purchased a million shares of Coinbase a couple of weeks ago when he saw it. Saw it going down in the open market, right? Quite.
00:31:21.244 - 00:31:32.900, Speaker B: Should have bought that, saw it go down. It went to $42 at one point. I was also sitting there being like, I should buy this, but I bought the dip too early on some other stuff and I was feeling not good about that. Classic.
00:31:32.932 - 00:31:34.504, Speaker A: Classic you. Classic you.
00:31:35.524 - 00:32:00.182, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think, I mean, I'm not sure. I do think, like, dow treasury management was an area that you and I were talking about is being pretty obviously immature in crypto. I don't know how this translates to. I'm not sure if it translates because, like, the dynamic in 2018 was ETH. The icos all raised in ETH, some in bitcoin but mostly in ETH. And then they had to sell that to fund their operations.
00:32:00.182 - 00:32:29.026, Speaker B: I don't really think that's the case here. I know most of these tokens, these protocols have treasuries in their native tokens, ETH and USDC. I think the overwhelming majority, it's in their native token, right. Or other tokens. Like, I don't think it. So I don't think it's like people are exclusively fire selling ETH like they were back then. So I'm less, I'm less confident that it leads to decrease in, like, price, negative price movement for ETH, but it definitely will for the native tokens as they diversify their treasuries.
00:32:29.090 - 00:32:56.754, Speaker A: Yeah. Empire is brought to you by Bitmex with the launch of their spot exchange. Bitmex is running an insane promo right now. We wanted to give you the inside scoop. Here's the deal. For the next two months, users who trade $250 worth of crypto on Bitmex's spot exchange will be entered into their million dollar giveaway. Prizes range from thousands of dollars all the way up to $500,000.
00:32:56.754 - 00:33:25.308, Speaker A: That's right. Trade $250 on Bitmex for a chance to personally win $500,000. Beyond the million dollar giveaway, new users can also get up to 200 bmEx. BMex. That's Bitmex's new token coming soon just by creating an account and going through KYC and trading. So you can actually get Bitmex tokens just by creating an account and trading. The more you trade, the higher your chances of winning.
00:33:25.308 - 00:33:47.496, Speaker A: What are you waiting for? Go to bitmex.com dot today. Sign up for an account bit dash M Dash x.com dot don't know if there's much to talk about here, but one interesting data point that I saw was just May was the first month ever where FTX passed Coinbase in terms of their spot volume. FTX had higher spot volume for BTC and ETH and Coinbase in May. I don't know. It's really interesting.
00:33:47.496 - 00:33:55.444, Speaker A: I don't know if you want to talk about that. I also, I know you sent me SPF's tweet about hiring. I don't know if you want to talk about that. Or we can move past this one.
00:33:55.824 - 00:34:29.028, Speaker B: No, I mean, if you want to run down the numbers here, I guess because they are interesting, right? And everyone talks about Coinbase versus FTX and really the gorilla in the room, that 800 pound gorilla is still binance, which is just quietly dominating it might. It might actually be worth. I haven't heard anyone talk about this, but, you know, Sam has become, like, practically the face of crypto over the last year. Have you heard CZ do, like, any public appearances or talks or anything like that? I don't know if that's significant or not, but, like, there's an enormous difference in the pr that's going on between.
00:34:29.076 - 00:34:53.669, Speaker A: Well, it's got to be because of the SEC, because they're. I mean, finance is facing two different things right now, right? The SEC launched a probe like this investigation against the BNB token, examining whether the sale of their token in the. They did an ICO, right? People forget binance did an ICO of BnB five years ago. Five years ago. Five years ago, a measly 15 million. Right. Which back then seemed like a lot and today seems like nothing, but.
00:34:53.669 - 00:35:05.330, Speaker A: Yeah. So the SEC is looking into BNB, and on Monday, a Reuters investigation. Oh, no, that was Reuters. That's not sec. What's this note here? Reuters investigation. Positive. Binance has.
00:35:05.330 - 00:35:06.986, Speaker A: Oh, no, that's fluff. That's nothing.
00:35:07.050 - 00:35:10.066, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah, I mean, I think they're.
00:35:10.090 - 00:35:11.058, Speaker A: Probably worried about that.
00:35:11.106 - 00:35:51.730, Speaker B: I think FTX is an example of really just a super fast up and comer that's taken some big swings and risks, but also executed pretty well. I think Coinbase. I mean, so the actual numbers here. So the story, right, is that for the first time, FTX did more volume than Coinbase in May. I think it was for higher spot volume for bitcoin and ETH. So it was like 30 versus 28 billion for bitcoin, 21 versus 18 for ETH at one point. I'm pretty sure FTX, at their last private market valuation round, again, we're talking about huge dislocations there between private and public markets at the moment.
00:35:51.730 - 00:36:14.528, Speaker B: So take it with a grain of salt. Actually surpassed coinbases as well. I don't know if you had to do some kind of swot or breakdown analysis for the two businesses. I think FTX, they would define themselves as they want to be. They almost view themselves more as like a payment company. They just want to sit in the middle of transactions, like, all over the world. And they also ftx us, I think, rolled out stock trading.
00:36:14.528 - 00:36:15.984, Speaker B: I don't know if you saw that this week, too.
00:36:16.064 - 00:36:43.924, Speaker A: I disagree with that take on what FTX wants to be. I know they have those business lines. I know they have all the business lines and stuff like that. FTX, I think, is just going after the institutional crypto market and they want to win the institutional crypto market and they want to win the trader market. That's what I think. And I think Coinbase will own the retail market. Like, look at all the stuff that FTX is doing with the CFTC.
00:36:43.924 - 00:36:57.796, Speaker A: They spent $1.1 billion acquiring just licenses last year. And they're really, really, really trying to, um, push that forward with the regulators. I mean, I'm sure, obviously Coinbase is trying to do the same thing, but.
00:36:57.860 - 00:37:19.612, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess, yeah, that for, so for me, FTX, when I think about them, I guess I will stay in my, like I, what I, how I view the business is like Sam's background, right? He was at Jane street. That guy thinks in terms of markets. By the way, if you haven't heard Sam talk about markets, like, it's literally like listening to, I don't know, Beethoven talk about music. I've never heard him talk about that.
00:37:19.628 - 00:37:20.340, Speaker A: As a weird example.
00:37:20.372 - 00:37:24.308, Speaker B: But like, the guy just knows it, you know, like he listened to someone in their element, you know, it's the.
00:37:24.316 - 00:37:35.396, Speaker A: Best episode on that. That is Sam talking on. Well, he did call an empire, so you should listen to that. But a really good one was, that's the best it was with Patrick O'Shaughnessy of Invest. Like the best, which we can throw in the show notes.
00:37:35.420 - 00:37:35.948, Speaker B: I agree.
00:37:36.076 - 00:37:39.076, Speaker A: Plug another good podcast in here. But that was a really good episode.
00:37:39.180 - 00:37:57.236, Speaker B: Yeah, it was phenomenal. But he's a markets focused guy. So I would imagine him, like Jane street, makes their money by providing liquidity in markets, right. And fixing inefficiencies. I would guess that that's kind of the lens through which Sam views the world in general. Right? So he wants to solve that for crypto markets. He obviously wants to move into stock market.
00:37:57.236 - 00:38:17.708, Speaker B: The stock market. He wants to do that for derivatives. He probably got to move into payments. Right? And he probably sees like this push into gaming and nfts is like, there's going to be native, like, Defi is going to interact with those, those digital assets, right. There are going to be transactions that need to take place there. I bet FTX sees an enormous market for transactions there. Whereas I would say for Coinbase.
00:38:17.708 - 00:38:58.134, Speaker B: I think the way that they look at the world is that they actually want to be more than just an exchange. They want to be the gateway through which people come into crypto, right? So there's a, there's a legacy exchange business, but they, you know, they, they want to get involved with, um, you know, the, like, be a wallet, basically. Uh, they want you know, they're moving into nfts. I think they want to be. The way they described is like facilitating people's journey into open finance. So I almost view them as like a conduit for capital to come into crypto, whereas I almost see FTX wanting to burst out of crypto and actually stand in the middle of all these different transactions. I don't think it has to be mutually exclusive, but I do see them as like different.
00:38:58.134 - 00:39:02.442, Speaker B: Different businesses. The number of employees is very different at each of those companies, too.
00:39:02.498 - 00:39:04.250, Speaker A: What are the numbers these days? Do we know?
00:39:04.402 - 00:39:14.736, Speaker B: I think I heard Coinbase got up to 5000 somewhere around there. And then, let's see, I don't know.
00:39:14.800 - 00:39:26.044, Speaker A: 200 and 3250 is the last number I heard for FTX. 300. I would bet they're around 300 now. I would bet Coinbase is. I think that this number is actually public. Like four or 5000 very roughly. Ballpark.
00:39:26.044 - 00:39:36.240, Speaker A: Yeah. I think binance is more like six or 7000. Crypto.com is like 3000. And then FTX is around 300. I could be. Those are ballpark numbers.
00:39:36.240 - 00:39:36.680, Speaker A: But.
00:39:36.792 - 00:39:52.294, Speaker B: Yeah, the other thing I'll just add on the Coinbase thing is they folks probably know they rescinded a bunch of job offers recently. I would check out the. There's actually a. They set up a resource for basically everyone whose job offer they rescinded. Maybe we can link that in the show notes. In the show notes?
00:39:52.334 - 00:39:53.198, Speaker A: Yeah, I have that, actually.
00:39:53.286 - 00:40:12.440, Speaker B: Yeah. So obviously we talk about this in a pretty dispassionate way, but, like, these are real humans. And people that lost their jobs in some case gave up great other opportunities to sign with a company that they were really excited about and then kind of had the rug pulled from under them. Many are like young people in their career. So if anyone's listening to this and hiring, I'd highly recommend you check it out. There's some great talent there.
00:40:12.472 - 00:40:13.736, Speaker A: Yeah, we'll link that in the show notes.
00:40:13.840 - 00:40:14.408, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:40:14.536 - 00:40:18.472, Speaker A: Awesome. Cynthia Lummis, you wanna talk about this bill?
00:40:18.648 - 00:40:22.368, Speaker B: Yeah. I feel like, you know, the ins and outs a little bit better than me. You wanna lead it?
00:40:22.496 - 00:40:37.694, Speaker A: Good luck to me. Yeah, good luck to me. Yeah. Basically, Senator Lummis and Senator Gillibrand announced the Responsible Financial Innovation act. This was a basically 69 page bill. Is that a meme? I don't know. I don't know if that was on purpose.
00:40:37.694 - 00:41:22.912, Speaker A: Little 69 page bill creating a. Basically trying to create a regulatory framework for crypto. And overall, I think this has been viewed as a very positive piece of legislation. I took some notes on it. Let me just pull up some of these notes here. The first is that it clears up a lot of the securities laws, and I think puts a lot of crypto assets as commodities under the CFTC. And this has been a big, just a big topic of conversation, is like, should crypto get regulated by the CFTC or the SEC, or should something new get created? And generally, the SEC is seen as much more, just a much stricter place that comes down on securities, where the CFTC is what regulates commodities, and they're seen as a little more relaxed.
00:41:22.912 - 00:41:39.388, Speaker A: And so I think this bill would put crypto assets under, categorize them as commodities under the CFTC. Um, there are also new disclosure requirements that would make, uh, anonymously run projects almost impossible to comply under this law.
00:41:39.516 - 00:42:02.100, Speaker B: So I can run through some of what I like. What I think is it. So it basically, I mean, one of the interesting things about it is that it lets taxpayers, in many circumstances, they're exempt, uh, right. From, like, capital gains type income tax when a crypto is used to buy a good or a service. I have, I view this as, like, largely a symbolic victory, just because my, my, I think bitcoin is. I know ETH is ultrasound money. I'm not sure.
00:42:02.100 - 00:42:45.862, Speaker B: For me, it feels more like a commodity. Bitcoin is really the money that we're creating here. And I don't think it's the type of money that you spend on small purchases. I think this is maybe a more symbolic victory and like a foot in the door potentially, um, for something larger later, because I like, I don't know how many people are buying stuff worth less than $200 in bitcoin, but, um, it puts most crypto under the purview of the CFTC. But it does leave broad oversight for an array for SEC oversight, including tokens that provide a kind of a financial interest. And it gives courts this procedure to rebut the assumption that tokens are commodities, which I think is almost like, I think about it almost as innocent until proven guilty. The presumption is that it's a commodity, but you can always challenge that as well.
00:42:45.862 - 00:43:06.110, Speaker B: And to be honest, that makes complete sense, because in my view, many of these tokens are equity. They're actually having to bend over backwards and behave in weird ways to not fit the definition of a Howie test. And I think that which we can get into a little bit, but I do think it makes sense for the SEC to be involved. I don't think it makes sense to. But the CFTC has been largely, much more favorable.
00:43:06.182 - 00:43:38.970, Speaker A: Yeah. There's something else that was, I think, a misinterpretation by some folks, which is, I think a lot of people thought that it requires daos to be registered entities in the United States. I think my understanding and what I saw from folks like Adam Cochran and, and Jake Trevinsky, who have good insights into this, is that there are tax incentives for daos if you register in the United States, but you're not required to actually register in the United States. So that was one thing that I saw also, just bipartisan bill. Feels like it's pretty rare to see those these days. So that's a. I agree.
00:43:38.970 - 00:44:15.834, Speaker A: I think that's a win. There's some increased reporting and compliance on exchanges which would increase their cost, but in general, I don't think that's too bad of a thing. Oh, there's one issue that I saw, which was it tries to make amms. It kind of restricts specific, it tells amms that they might have to restrict specific tokens from trading, which is kind of what, like what we saw with Uniswap, if you remember. Right, the Uniswap front end delisted a bunch of tokens maybe six months ago, but the protocol didn't delist anything. Right. So they're trying to require something that maybe isn't possible and that isn't really defi.
00:44:15.834 - 00:44:23.054, Speaker A: Right. So that's one thing from this. But I think the general sentiment is, like, this bill is overwhelmingly positive.
00:44:24.074 - 00:44:42.002, Speaker B: Yeah, I'd agree with you. I think what we've been suffering from for a long time in crypto is just too many regulators and regulatory bodies trying to. It's like that elephant thing, right? Like five blind guys touch an elephant, one touches the trunk, one touches the tail, and everyone says it's a different thing. I think the most encouraging part did.
00:44:42.018 - 00:44:46.290, Speaker A: I love that, right? Yeah, you did. You just love. You like that one? I know you like that one.
00:44:46.362 - 00:45:07.264, Speaker B: I like that. I use that one a lot. Just like my muffin joke. But, you know, I think the best part about it is that it's pretty holistic, right? I mean, there's a whole, there's now there's a process to apply for, like, digital asset exchanges and actually tries to give some definition as to what that is. There are safeguards for consumers, crypto, in the event that those exchanges go bankrupt. Like, these are good, necessary things.
00:45:07.304 - 00:45:07.456, Speaker A: Right.
00:45:07.480 - 00:45:33.724, Speaker B: I feel like sometimes in crypto, we're like, we don't like the regulators, but, like, some amount of regulation is, is good. And I'd be curious. This is one that I don't have an enormous amount of conviction in. So I almost want listeners to tell me why I might be wrong about this, but I think one of the biggest things we're getting hamstrung up about is that we just don't call many of these tokens securities. I almost wish we could just call them securities because it makes you behave in really weird. Yeah, I'm about to get roasted, but. But so tell me why I'm wrong.
00:45:33.724 - 00:46:00.478, Speaker B: So here. Here's my thinking behind this. Right? People are like, daos are very dysfunctional. A lot of the reasons why dows are dysfunctional is because the founder, the founders of the protocols, can't be seen to have undue influence on what's going on in the protocol. Otherwise, you're making an investment with someone else doing the work with an expectation of return. So that means founders have to step out of the arena way too early. Like, way, way, way too early, and rely on this community of people.
00:46:00.478 - 00:46:36.924, Speaker B: I think there should be a road to decentralization. But, like, I think you and I both agree, in the beginning of a small thing, you need someone with a freaking vision, you know, and you need someone to push it forward. And accountability, the buck has to stop with one or two people, I think. And then there's also this weird stuff about, you know, now that there are actually somewhat mature protocols out there, right? Like a uniswap or something like that. You know, the. The criticism of defy is that it's very circular because all the rewards are generated in their native tokens, when in reality they could just convert that to USDC and literally start dividending. But if they did that, then it would be for an expectation of profit or whatever to fit the Howey test.
00:46:37.224 - 00:47:03.274, Speaker A: So let me show you, and maybe for listeners, sorry, because this is. I'm going to share my screen about something. Let me show you the application to basically have your tokens in the right get reggae exemption. And I think I'll show you why everything can't be a security. Let me just show you this. The current framework just doesn't make sense. This guy, Jeremy Hogan posted this.
00:47:03.274 - 00:47:26.114, Speaker A: Even just the form that you fill in to become a security, it doesn't apply to these tokens. It doesn't actually make sense for these tokens. I think that's the big pushback on why they shouldn't be tokens or why these tokens shouldn't be securities is because, like, the securities test was built in, what, 1934 with Howie or something like that.
00:47:26.154 - 00:47:35.858, Speaker B: Like 1946. And you know what it was for oranges or something. Orange farms, large tracts of Florida land that he built. He planted oranges on.
00:47:35.906 - 00:47:36.458, Speaker A: There you go.
00:47:36.546 - 00:48:12.994, Speaker B: So I think, I agree with, I think what ultimately needs to happen, the best case scenario for crypto, our version of a soft landing for this, is that eventually we say, look, this is a really old understanding of what constitutes a security. Crypto is big enough and it's not this dirty thing anymore. It's a big enough new industry that we want a piece of it. We will literally reconsider how we think about securities laws in the United States because in other countries it's different. By the way, it's not like the Howey test is the universally accepted way to classify security. Like in the UK it's done very differently, in China it's done very differently. It's not like we have the only answer here.
00:48:12.994 - 00:48:20.584, Speaker B: I think the best case scenario is it would make us reconsider our securities laws and accredited investor rules, which are ridiculous in my opinion.
00:48:22.004 - 00:49:00.280, Speaker A: I know this probably isn't that big of news. I just want to talk about or anything else on Lummis I want to get into. Okay. Salesforce launched an NFT platform called NFT, basically a new minting and sales platform called NFT. Cloud pilots start this week and it's expected to be widely available by October 2022, 2022 this year. There's a quote from it that I found pretty funny, which is NFT cloud does not support energy wasting proof of work blockchains resulting in 99% fewer emissions. I could not find anywhere in a single press release, anywhere on their website what blockchain this is built on.
00:49:00.280 - 00:49:49.436, Speaker A: And I saw some speculation that this is built on like Vechain. I can't find a single place where, where Salesforce mentions what blockchain that they support. And you got to imagine every single web two partnership with a crypto company, the crypto company publicizes the hell out of it. If Avalanche does a partnership with someone or Solana or Polygon, you see that thing plastered all over Twitter. If Salesforce had partnered with someone like Polygon or Avalanche or Solana on this, that would be a huge splash. Polygon would be pushing the hell out of that news because they're not. I just wonder if like they're even storing these NFTs on a blockchain or if like the NFTs, the NFTs are basically stored in that, in some database run by Salesforce, aka they're not nfTs.
00:49:49.436 - 00:49:55.428, Speaker A: So I don't know. I'm skeptical of this one. I have more positive views on it, but I'm very skeptical on this one.
00:49:55.596 - 00:49:58.984, Speaker B: Give me the positive views before I give you my also negative views.
00:49:59.384 - 00:50:30.464, Speaker A: Salesforce is the largest CRM platform. If you're a Fortune 500 CMO and you see this news, you pay closer attention to nfts. It brings more credibility. Like, I just really try to remove yourself from crypto. Put yourself in the shoes of like, someone who's been a CMO for 20 years and like, you see this news dropping, you're like, oh, shit, maybe I got to take these NFT things more seriously. I don't know. That's my positive view.
00:50:30.924 - 00:50:35.924, Speaker B: I just like, you know, how many times have we seen this before? How many times have you seen this?
00:50:35.964 - 00:50:36.544, Speaker A: Like.
00:50:39.204 - 00:50:45.220, Speaker B: Oh, bank of America is doing a proof of concept. This company is doing. Remember the strawberries on the blockchain from Walmart?
00:50:45.252 - 00:50:49.584, Speaker A: No, no, no. It was mangoes. It was mangoes. It was IBM and Walmart. I remember that. Of course.
00:50:50.324 - 00:50:57.480, Speaker B: Yeah, I, you know, I don't have anything constructive to add to this and I don't have anything constructive to add to the.
00:50:57.552 - 00:51:00.928, Speaker A: If you don't have anything nice to say, michael, don't say it at all.
00:51:01.056 - 00:51:03.248, Speaker B: You sound like my nana. My nana said that to me.
00:51:03.296 - 00:51:04.296, Speaker A: That's what my mother would tell me.
00:51:04.320 - 00:51:32.764, Speaker B: You're channeling her energy right now. Rip Nana. But like, I think just on the energy debate, I mean, people should follow the work of Nick Carter on this, who's done a lot of good, I think, standing up to if, if the expectation for a new industry is that it doesn't consume energy, we're just not going to create any new industries. I don't know. It's a completely arbitrary way to meet out which industry should be allowed to use energy and which one should not be.
00:51:33.664 - 00:51:53.458, Speaker A: I've stopped talking to folks about the energy debate because it's such a ridiculous debate in my mind. It's such a ridiculous conversation in my mind. You need energy to verify the blockchain, just like you need energy to run Google services or it's a completely ridiculous debate in my mind. So I don't think we need to even. Yeah, well, I think it gets at.
00:51:53.466 - 00:52:04.506, Speaker B: The heart of the, if you view crypto as this speculative thing with no value, then any amount of energy spent on it is a waste. And I think that's the unsaid thing.
00:52:04.650 - 00:52:20.584, Speaker A: Right? That's what it comes down to. There's no energy debate. It's whether or not you believe this stuff is valuable. If you don't think it's valuable, then of course it's wasting too much energy. If you think it's incredibly valuable, there's no amount of energy that it could use that that wouldn't be worth it, right? So it all just comes down to, do you think this stuff is valuable or not?
00:52:20.704 - 00:52:41.684, Speaker B: Exactly. And I have been surprised. I will admit. I feel like I'm usually on the more pessimistic side of this thing, but I thought after this last bull market that we brought more people over that had fully gone. But I think many people who dipped their toes and got in in this cycle just kind of were like, yeah, I believe in it. Here's my money.
00:52:42.044 - 00:52:43.452, Speaker A: Please go up. Please go up.
00:52:43.508 - 00:53:01.524, Speaker B: And now that it's gone down, they're like, I knew this was a freaking scam, you know? Like, I like all the people that I talked to in my life, you know, for the last 18 months. I got used to this. I was like, oh, you work in crypto. Oh, that's very cool. And now they're like, crypto. Well, you knew it was going to come down, didn't you? Like, wink, wink, nudge, nudge. It's like, all right, man.
00:53:01.524 - 00:53:13.314, Speaker B: All right, well, and my. And ultimately, like, for folks who do have, this is why you can't borrow someone else's conviction. So what I'll say is, thanks for two more years of head start before everyone else comes back in.
00:53:14.534 - 00:53:31.598, Speaker A: I forget if it was Olaf or Vance from framework who said this to me. We will know. One of them said, we will know. We are in a bear market when people start talking about enterprise blockchain again. And this is the enterprise blockchain we were waiting for. This is. Yeah, it is.
00:53:31.726 - 00:53:47.338, Speaker B: I saw someone tweeting, like, someone from IBM being like, finally, we can get rid of this web3. Now it's time for the adults in the room to build like, IBM. Come on. So I don't know. I think enterprise blockchain will make a comeback as well.
00:53:47.426 - 00:53:55.002, Speaker A: Oh, you tweeted this. There are three eventualities in this world. Death, taxes, bear markets. Renewing interest in enterprise blockchain. We are back, baby.
00:53:55.138 - 00:53:55.794, Speaker B: We're back.
00:53:55.874 - 00:53:57.254, Speaker A: I'll hit you with a retweet.
00:53:57.674 - 00:54:16.652, Speaker B: You know what is one that really gets me, too? It's just the. The NFT medical records one. It's like, I just don't understand why we can't view NFTs for what they are right now. I actually. What I would say, because I know it's a. And you disagree with me a little on this, is that the NFT profile picture projects are, like, overvalued. And I agree.
00:54:16.652 - 00:54:47.282, Speaker B: Most of them are. But what I would say is, like, a thought experiment. To those of you who are listening to this, let's say you had $10,000 to spend. Would you rather do it in a totally hypothetical scenario? Say you could buy a suit with that money, or say you had to spend that money on a suit, or you had to spend it on, like, a sick profile picture that everyone thought was really cool and it was across, like, your Twitter and Instagram and all your socials. For me, it's actually a pretty easy decision. I would spend the $10,000 on a profile picture that made me look cool and because what am I going to do? I'm going to wear a suit, like, two times a year. I don't need a $10,000 suit.
00:54:47.378 - 00:54:54.792, Speaker A: How many times you'll wear it. It's more about who the people that you want to see you as being cool. Like, what do they value? Right, right.
00:54:54.888 - 00:54:58.224, Speaker B: And how many people see you? Yeah, right. Like, how many times does your.
00:54:58.264 - 00:55:14.720, Speaker A: Well, like, I could wear a Rolex. I don't own a Rolex. Cause I have no. I don't have interest in a Rolex. But if I wore a Rolex around New York, like, thousands of people will see me on the streets. But I don't care what any of those people think. And even, like, if I went and hung out with all my friends and I wore a Rolex, my friends would be like, why the hell are you wearing a Rolex?
00:55:14.832 - 00:55:15.536, Speaker B: Like, you douche?
00:55:15.560 - 00:55:18.420, Speaker A: Like, take that thing off. You know?
00:55:18.512 - 00:55:19.148, Speaker B: I agree.
00:55:19.276 - 00:55:20.380, Speaker A: It would make me look less cool.
00:55:20.412 - 00:55:25.348, Speaker B: I'd be embarrassed. I would be embarrassed to wear a Rolex. I would be, like, super embarrassed about it.
00:55:25.436 - 00:55:26.516, Speaker A: Yeah. So maybe.
00:55:26.580 - 00:55:38.188, Speaker B: Maybe the framework is just that younger generations don't like doing what older generations thought was cool, but everyone needs, like, something to spend money on when they have too much money. And maybe that'll, like, maybe that'll be a big part of profile picture nfts.
00:55:38.236 - 00:55:43.264, Speaker A: Exactly right for us, you know? Yeah, maybe we'll do an. I don't know.
00:55:44.084 - 00:55:44.836, Speaker B: I saw Malta.
00:55:44.860 - 00:56:02.250, Speaker A: I was going to talk about healthcare on the blockchain. Maltem also tweeted something about it. Like, if anyone else pitches me healthcare data on the blockchain this week, I will lose it. Please stop doing this shit. I saw a couple companies this month got funded healthcare data on the blockchain. So we are back.
00:56:02.322 - 00:56:07.730, Speaker B: They did last. Yeah, yeah, we're back. One day that'll work. And you and I will just be wrong about it because it's been wrong.
00:56:07.802 - 00:56:11.626, Speaker A: Yeah. Like decentralized social, you know? Totally.
00:56:11.810 - 00:56:12.338, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:56:12.426 - 00:56:13.694, Speaker A: But I'm okay with that.
00:56:14.114 - 00:56:15.234, Speaker B: I'll take the under.
00:56:15.394 - 00:56:28.904, Speaker A: Anything else to talk about here? Optimism. Yeah, optimism partnered. So optimism did this big airdrop. We've talked about a bunch on the podcast. They lost 20 million op tokens. Here's kind of what happened. And I wasn't.
00:56:28.904 - 00:56:55.552, Speaker A: I didn't actually participate in it. So this is secondhand, obviously. Basically, optimism partnered with Wintermute. Wintermute is one of the biggest market makers in the space. Market makers provide liquidity. So optimism partnered with Wintermute to provide liquidity services, like, basically buy, sell, creating a market for the op token. And it basically turned out that Wintermute couldn't access the multisig wallet where the tokens were sent.
00:56:55.552 - 00:57:16.984, Speaker A: The wallet was on an l one, as I understand it, but it needed to be deployed on an l two. And I'm not fully sure the specifics here. Obviously, I don't work at Wintermut. I'm not an optimism. But this just shows me that one of the most. You've got optimism, like, one of the best tech teams in the industry. You've got Wintermute, one of the best trading firms in the industry.
00:57:16.984 - 00:57:51.424, Speaker A: They're still having. This stuff is still so complicated that they're still having issues with it. Oh, and there's a second part here, which is that Wintermute started a recovery operation to kind of gain access to the wallet. But before they could do that, an attacker was able to recover the wallet. First, they gained access to the 20 million op tokens. Now Wintermute has committed to buying these, like, quote, unquote, stolen tokens as they're sold by the attacker's wallet. And I think optimism made another short term grant of 20 million op tokens to wintermute.
00:57:51.424 - 00:58:13.098, Speaker A: But, man, still, like, how long have we been doing this? Five, six years? However long it's been, I still feel cautious when I'm sending a crypto transaction. Like, I still send my, like, little $10, $100 test transaction first. If winter mutant optimism are still doing this. Yeah, we need some improvements around UI ux, I'll say that.
00:58:13.266 - 00:58:47.372, Speaker B: Yep. Someone made this analogy a long time ago. I think it's pretty apt if you think about manufacturing and shipping hardware products versus software products. There's a lot that you could learn for crypto. So in a software product, you're. That's the Reid Hoffman if you aren't horribly embarrassed about your product when you ship it, you've waited too long because the incentive is you can ship something out, get users using it, collect bugs and then just pass, update the code and pass out an update and it will fix it with hardware or something that you're selling. That's a good, out.
00:58:47.372 - 00:59:23.758, Speaker B: In the real world, it's the exact opposite incentive. Let's say you manufacture $6 million cars or 6 million cars. You want to make sure that those cars, when they arrive at their owners, when people buy them, there's not a deficiency with the brake. Otherwise you're going to have to recall and fix 6 million individual cars. That's going to be enormously costly. Crypto is very interesting in that it actually, even though it is software, it behaves more like hardware in terms of how you need to think about shipping stuff because you need to go and battle test and make sure that there are bugs so people don't lose all the money voltage. Right.
00:59:23.758 - 00:59:43.902, Speaker B: And we didn't talk about the Robson testnet merge, but you know, that's why Ethereum is taking so much time in its, in the merge, in its transition from proof of work to proof of stake. That's why multiple testnets are being used. They could actually ship this basically today, but they don't want to put hundreds of billions of dollars at risk and risk the trust of the network.
00:59:44.038 - 01:00:14.992, Speaker A: So ooh, this is interesting. This just happened live while we were recording the ape. Dow just voted against yugalabs wishes ape to remain on ethereum for now. This is interesting actually. I think because Yuga Labs wanted to move, from my understanding, Yuga Labs wants to move onto their own blockchain or l two or whatever it may be. Like create their own l two or l one or whatever it might be. The community basically over willed the creators corporate, like cell.
01:00:14.992 - 01:00:23.252, Speaker A: Ooh, this is really interesting. I need to think this one through, but this is just interesting to see the community. Yeah. Overrule. What like the, the execs want to.
01:00:23.268 - 01:00:50.648, Speaker B: Do, you know, so that, that interview that you did with Vance I thought was really interesting here. Cause there are kind of like two things that I think the, the prevailing framework for l one s is that people won't interact on the l one s. It's too expensive. So the natural customers of l one s are other blockchains that could be L2 blockchains. If you went through like the, the kind of vision of like, by the way, Ben Jones, founder of optimism, I didn't mean that to sound negative about optimism at all like that. The team that's building that in that community is amazing. They're great.
01:00:50.648 - 01:01:25.340, Speaker B: But one vision of the future is that there's l one s. There are l two s that interact and borrow the security from l one s and buy block space, essentially, from those l one s, and that applications will launch on each individual l two. There's another kind of vision of the future, actually, where you don't necessarily need that, where each project has its own app specific chain. That's where you're getting app chains from. And then they kind of plug into and borrow security from the same thing. That's like the Cosmos SDK model. So I just, you know, I think a lot of people viewed it as heresy.
01:01:25.340 - 01:02:17.544, Speaker B: I think Yuga Labs has come under a bunch of criticism for being too money grabby, which there might be some legitimacy to that, or they're just really good about financing. They knew they needed to grab as much money as they could to get through the next bear market. Those are the two interpretations. I think a lot of people viewed it through an ideological lens of, like, do they support ethereum or do they not? And I actually don't know what the best technical way to do it is because, dude, can you imagine if you and I were building one of these chains and it was like, oh, yeah, I know you want to do this and you have the motivation and you got the team, but due to technical problems with Ethereum, you're just going to have to wait a year to do what you want to do. Yeah, I mean, come on, there's some legitimacy to that viewpoint, too. That would suck. So ideologically, these guys might be very on the same page as the Ethereum community, but I don't know, I feel like I understand people's point of view.
01:02:17.584 - 01:02:37.818, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I do too. I mean, Hugo wants to do it for a couple of reasons, right? One is it actually then provides a use case for ape. It becomes a staking and a gas token. Now, instead of almost just like kind of worthless token that doesn't have utility, it also creates. I mean, they raised 450 million at a $4 billion valuation. There's nothing in the world more valuable. If.
01:02:37.818 - 01:02:47.034, Speaker A: If all this stuff works, there's going to be nothing more valuable than a layer one, than owning the l one. So got to do something to fill into that valuation.
01:02:48.134 - 01:03:35.342, Speaker B: Okay, another benchmark for you here. Yugalab's valuation is the valuation that Disney acquired Lucasfilm for. So at the end of the day, I know there are some differences or whatever. They have different revenue model, Internet, whatever. They're both in the game of building ip in communities, right? That's what Lucasfilm is in the game of. That's what Yuga Labs is in the game of Yuga Labs. To justify that $4 billion, you can either say that Star wars valuation was wrong, or the Lucasfilm, which included Star Wars, Indiana Jones, all of that, like monumental ip that got built, or Yugalabs is just like, like theoretically Yuga labs would have to create the same amount of intellectual property that, that, that Lucasfilm had, you know, do you see what I'm saying? Like, yeah, so I don't want to pick on new glabs here, but like, they have a lot of biddling to do.
01:03:35.342 - 01:03:36.806, Speaker B: They got a lot of biddling ahead.
01:03:36.830 - 01:04:00.408, Speaker A: Of them a little bit that they do. Last thing is just an update on the merge. I would really recommend people go listen to the bankless episode with Tim Baco that David and Ryan did. I think it came out this a day ago, or maybe even today, but it was really, really good. But we'll just give a quick summary. But if you want to get into it, I'd recommend listening to that episode. I'll give a little bit of context.
01:04:00.408 - 01:04:24.728, Speaker A: Basically, we're leading up to the Ethereum main net merge, right? But before that there are a couple of different testnets that we have to go through. There's the. This is the Rothstein testnet. So the Rothstein testnet is what we just had. After this, there's the sepolia testnet merge, and then there's the Worley testnet merge. Why these names are so complicated, I do not know. This is what happens when developers create the names of the things.
01:04:24.728 - 01:04:47.312, Speaker A: So basically the rob scene, I'm sure there's actually a reference to something, but the rob scene test net merge was a success. Here's the quick overview. It was a success. There were some minor bugs, a little bit of configuration issues. Those issues were quickly resolved. Participation reached 99%. There was one known issue of a client timeout when building a block with zero transactions.
01:04:47.312 - 01:05:23.926, Speaker A: I don't fully understand what that means, but it was good news across the board. One step closer to the merge. The. I think the most interesting thing here is just like when merge, right? That's what everyone wants to know. Here are the current odds for the merge on poly market. 28% chance that the merge happens by September 1, 65% chance that the merge happens by October 1, and a 90% chance that it happens by end of year. So by September 1 28%, October 1 65%, and a 90% chance this happens by the end of the year.
01:05:24.100 - 01:05:53.194, Speaker B: Yeah. What I would just say is this is where you kind of have two prevailing schools of thought here, and I think they're both right. But there's the market school of thought, and then there's the fundamentals. Long term investors school of thought. I think if you zoom out and look at this from a long term perspective, you can only look at this as bullish. Assuming that Ethereum doesn't completely break, which is a risk, probably a small risk, but the merge is going to. First, it's shifting from proof of work to proof of stake, which just makes it more scalable.
01:05:53.194 - 01:06:24.564, Speaker B: All this, it's very bullish in terms of what's actually going to happen fundamentally with the merge makes a more deflationary asset. All that good stuff. But then there's the market view, which is in the short term, this is uncertainty. And in general, markets tend to hate uncertainty and investors will hedge. I think there are probably pretty good arguments that, and also our macro environment just sucks so badly. I think that's overriding everything. So I think, I don't know, I'd be cautious about people who are.
01:06:24.564 - 01:06:45.268, Speaker B: I think there's a way to interpret comments that they're very bullish on the long term future of Ethereum, but I wouldn't read those from those people as like, you should be buying ETH at that particular moment in time. Not that I'm, not that I have any special insight, but I think I just want to point out, I think people talk about the merge from two very different viewpoints, a market standpoint and a fundamental standpoint.
01:06:45.316 - 01:06:46.024, Speaker A: Good call.
01:06:46.734 - 01:06:47.474, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:06:48.454 - 01:06:49.422, Speaker A: How'd we do?
01:06:49.558 - 01:06:52.806, Speaker B: Cool, man. I thought we did all right. I thought we did all right.
01:06:52.870 - 01:06:53.254, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:06:53.334 - 01:07:06.262, Speaker B: Not bad. It'll be better than, you know. We should do this after your bachelor party in two weeks and see how much worse we do. Pray for Jason, guys. He's got his bachelor party coming up in two weeks in Cabo. Pray for.
01:07:06.278 - 01:07:15.600, Speaker A: Yeah, pray for me. Please pray for me. We need it. Awesome, buddy. Well, enjoy the rest of your week, I guess. I'm sure we're on several calls. I'm sure the rest of this week, but I will talk to you.
01:07:15.600 - 01:07:26.504, Speaker A: This has been, yeah, this has been a joy. Thanks, everyone, for listening. If you enjoyed it, toss us a five star review, subscribe, follow whatever you got to do, and we will see you next week. Cheers.
01:07:26.624 - 01:07:27.064, Speaker B: Cheers, guys.
