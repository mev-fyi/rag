00:00:16.894 - 00:00:27.214, Speaker B: Doing great. You know, a lot to digest this week. It's been one of those weeks where there's a lot going on every day, so there's a lot to cover. How are you doing?
00:00:27.374 - 00:00:39.182, Speaker A: I'm doing great. We got these new Lacroix in the office, Paul, skinny can instead of the smaller, thicker can. Big news for blockworks. It's very smoky in New York. Yeah, probably saw.
00:00:39.278 - 00:00:43.514, Speaker B: Does it inside, does it feel smoky or do you have filters or is it.
00:00:44.094 - 00:00:53.638, Speaker A: It does feel smoky. Yeah, it's a little smoky. It's actually, I think, the worst recorded air quality in the history of the US, because I really. Yeah, I was in San Francisco.
00:00:53.726 - 00:00:55.234, Speaker B: I was in San Francisco, too.
00:00:56.694 - 00:01:02.422, Speaker A: Totally blacked out. Like, remember that day? It's twice as bad in New York as that day in San Francisco.
00:01:02.518 - 00:01:15.958, Speaker B: Wow. I did see the, probably the best advertising in the world, which is a Diablo. Like New York, welcome to hell. And then the incredible, like, you just cannot time. That was impeccable. But, yeah, looks. Looks pretty.
00:01:15.958 - 00:01:25.012, Speaker B: So the air quality is going to last, I heard, for the next two, three days. We're recording, obviously, on Thursday, June 8. It seems like it's going to last for a few days. Has it gone better or worse?
00:01:25.198 - 00:01:36.512, Speaker A: Um, it's gotten a little bit better since yesterday, but, um, it's, I mean, still pretty bad. We. We just. We were supposed to host blockworks beers today, so. Yeah. And we just canceled it.
00:01:36.648 - 00:01:45.204, Speaker B: Okay. Well, they say if it's. It, wouldn't they say that, uh, spending a day out breathing this air was equivalent to smoking six cigarettes or something like that?
00:01:45.504 - 00:01:57.752, Speaker A: Yeah. Wow. Well, it's funny, I was walking on the street, so I was walking, coming into the office today, and. And there's a guy who's all. He was masked up because everyone's wearing masks in New York. Again, for the smoke. He was masked up.
00:01:57.752 - 00:02:14.684, Speaker A: And then I saw him light up a cigarette, and he pulled his mask down, starts, rips the cigarette, puts the mask back up. I was like, oh, buddy, you're missing the point here. Yeah, yeah, you've lost the plot, my friend. So anyways, you want to know, are we starting with finance or Coinbase.
00:02:16.504 - 00:02:21.398, Speaker B: In sequential order. Finance, chronological. Right. Because Binance was first.
00:02:21.526 - 00:02:45.078, Speaker A: Let's do binance. And I mean Coinbase. We can talk about this, but Coinbase was basically just a copy pasta of the Binance case without all the spicy stuff. So on Monday, I mean, it's been a. I don't know what the title of this podcast will be. Probably something about the SEC, because this week, the two big things were Binance and Coinbase had suits against them by the SEC. So on Monday, we can start with Binance.
00:02:45.078 - 00:03:28.534, Speaker A: Monday, Binance was sued by the SEC for a bunch of stuff, including commingling customer funds with the trading arm, operating an unregistered securities broker and exchange, and then facilitating the exchange of assets that are securities. Also importantly inside of that suit is really big thing. I read the whole thing of Binance and Coinbase. I feel prepped to talk about this. They also listed a bunch of tokens, such as BNB and BUSD and Matic and Solana, and a bunch of other tokens as securities. It was pretty bad, I would say pretty bad thing from the SEC. The really bad thing were these internal chat logs.
00:03:28.534 - 00:04:00.410, Speaker A: So I actually just want to read some of these because there's, like, the claims by the SEC in the Binance and Coinbase case were kind of similar, but Binance was. Had all these, like, really damning things inside of it. And I'm just going to read some of these. So this is, uh, evidence. This is a chat log between Samuel Lin, who was the former head of compliance at Binance, and, um, and this guy Alvin, who was their head of BD. Samuel. These are just some quotes.
00:04:00.410 - 00:04:21.536, Speaker A: Samuel Lin, we are. He messages him, he goes, we are operating as a fucking unlicensed securities exchange in the USA, bro. Alvin doesn't respond. He goes. Later, goes. Tells Alvin to take his BnB bonus and dump it into USDT, as it would just be dumb to hold BnB. I won't read the whole chat log, but we can link to it.
00:04:21.720 - 00:04:26.884, Speaker B: This was. All of these chats were dated, I think, 2018.
00:04:27.184 - 00:05:09.990, Speaker A: Yeah, 2018. 2018 talks about how the compliance side of binance is a sinking ship, just like the Titanic. This was another one. This was when they were hiring the CCO. Chief commercial officer Sam noted that he feels the risk reward isn't balanced and that he wouldn't feel comfortable signing off on the OFAC compliance stuff if he was CCO. This is when. So the binance strategy was basically to get these american people with connections either into finance or really into government, like Brian Brooks and like Kathryn Coley, to come on board, um, and to, like, be kind of the face, right? So Samuel goes, that's why I feel the risk reward of this company is not balanced.
00:05:09.990 - 00:05:35.268, Speaker A: There's no fucking way in hell I'm signing off as the CCO for all the OFAC shit. But you know what? Nobody wants to take up the role as we are to meow, which I don't know what that word means. Um, yeah, the CFO of Binance asked him to take the CCO role, do the sign off, and he would double his pay. He wouldn't do it. Um, yeah, I mean, list goes on. I will link to all this stuff, but what do you think of the. What do you think of this finance case? What do you make of it?
00:05:35.356 - 00:05:50.748, Speaker B: I want to zoom out. I think this week is momentous because we. I think, as an industry saw that there was. There was going to be some action coming against the two major exchanges. Like, I think a lot of people are sort of expecting the SEC to come after Binance. Mind you, they got out and Coinbase. Coinbase got a.
00:05:50.748 - 00:06:27.408, Speaker B: Well noticed a month or so ago. And, you know, it seems like every other exchange as well has gotten notified. I mean, Kraken obviously, like, had an issue with staking. So I think that a lot of this was. The industry was somehow feeling that it was coming, so it came all at once. As things tend to happen in crypto, the binance, speaking specifically about binance, you know, fact of the matter is, I'm not a lawyer. I read a lot of the reports and a lot of the interpretations by other people that are way smarter than me.
00:06:27.408 - 00:07:03.540, Speaker B: I think there are a couple of things. I do think that it is quite different. The binance and the allegations made in the binance kind of suit from the SEC is much heavier. Much more has. Feels to me like more meat on the bone and more serious allegations than the coinbase. One, particularly because it involves a lot of commingling of funds, it feels closer to the FTX is the bottom line. Why? Because they sort of make allegations that there are a number of entities, much of which CZ controls, and this is all what I think the SEC is claiming.
00:07:03.540 - 00:07:27.974, Speaker B: Correct me here, I'm wrong. And that a lot of. A lot of kind of. There were a couple of things at fault. One, that binance, us was kind of not ring fence, really. A lot of people and customers, a lot of institutions that were trading in finance, us had this sort of avenue to go trade them in binance. Of course, the number of products that you were able to access in Binance, you know, were much.
00:07:27.974 - 00:07:50.054, Speaker B: There's more products you could access in finance. Right. And so they make that claim. They also make the claim that they're a lot of funds, like CZ, kind of controlled, really. And there was sort of this puppet show, if you will, of pretending that they had binance, us as a independent entity. This is why Brian Brooks stepped down. This is why Cath, like Cooley, stepped down down.
00:07:50.054 - 00:08:42.952, Speaker B: So it's a lot of, I think it feels more serious on the misappropriation of funds. Then, of course, the SEC, I think, filed a motion to. What is it? Freeze finance us assets. Yep, that was the day, late the following day. And now Binance has retaliated to put up a public response, and then they retaliate it by saying, most recently, that apparently chairman Gensler had applied or to be an advisor, Binance, at one point while he was at MIT as a professor and one of the directors of the media lab, and that he has a conflict of interest and therefore he should kind of remove himself from all of this because there's conflict of interest. And so, yeah, a lot going on. I mean, I don't know how you want to parse all of this.
00:08:43.008 - 00:08:46.872, Speaker A: Well, I think you make an important point. I think let's, let's talk about the differences in the cases, because I think.
00:08:46.888 - 00:08:48.104, Speaker B: That'S the most important thing to focus on.
00:08:48.144 - 00:09:22.610, Speaker A: I think that actually, here's my bias coming in. But I think the best breakdown of this, actually, Catherine Ross, who's a blockworks reporter, just published an article saying the fundamental differences between SEC's finance and Coinbase suits. So I just want to read that with you live. And we talked to a couple lawyers for this piece. So I'm just going to walk, I'm sharing my screen, if anyone's watching, on YouTube. And we can kind of walk through this. Basically the, the SEC hit Coinbase with a, quote, straight registration violations case.
00:09:22.610 - 00:09:50.144, Speaker A: However, the binance suit, in addition to registration violations, includes allegations of fraud, market manipulation, commingling of investor funds, and diversion of investment funds. And Brian Armstrong tweeted this out, too. He said, in case it's not obvious, the coinbase suit is very different from others out there, obviously, referring to binance. The complaint filed against us is exclusively focused on what is or what is not a security. We're confident in our facts and the law.
00:09:50.924 - 00:09:51.676, Speaker B: That's right.
00:09:51.780 - 00:09:55.744, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think there's. I think these are very, very, very different cases. Yeah.
00:09:56.604 - 00:10:43.186, Speaker B: I think per. Has been a precedent. Now, the SEC doesn't go directly after some of these projects. It sort of submits them through these motions of what they think is a security and so the market reacted pretty aggressively. I think there was a big disconnect between how some of the majors, like particularly ETH, ETH was not named as security in both filings, which the market seemed to pick up on that, I mean, ETH and bitcoin resisted and traded fairly well relative to alts and some of the other names in there. And so again, I think it further solidifies his notion that ETH is not a security. Um, and, I mean, there's just a lot to talk about.
00:10:43.250 - 00:11:09.824, Speaker A: But I, let me, let me ask you this. Why? So here's a, so blockworks research tweeted this out. Finance has experienced $1.4 billion of outflows over the past three days in light of the SEC's lawsuit. If you look at this chart from our research team, you can actually see that this, I mean, 1.4 billion sounds like a lot. This is relatively normal funds for binance, which implies, as we tweeted out, that a majority of users are really not concerned by the recent action with the SEC.
00:11:09.824 - 00:11:33.052, Speaker A: So I'd like you to just, I'd love to hear your take on, obviously, what Gensler and the SEC was trying to do here is imply that with commingling of funds and those very clear messaging is that Binance is FTX 2.0. But the reaction from both the markets and from users and from the flow of funds shows that users don't actually really care about this. So I'm curious what, what, like, what you make of this?
00:11:33.148 - 00:12:05.854, Speaker B: That's a great point, because I was looking at particularly the outflows and. Right, because a lot of people were without data saying, this is a bank run and you're going to see the bank run. And we haven't seen that so far. And if you look at the data, I mean, this is normal kind of outflows. So, you know, of course, CZ tweeted and said, if we're going to see a back run, we'll, we'll, we'll fully understand. You know, binance has all the collateral, all the assets to honor these withdrawals and whatnot. So far, it's been fairly interesting.
00:12:05.854 - 00:12:38.124, Speaker B: I do think, I don't want to call it early, but it seems so far that the market has shrugged it off. A lot of them were saying, look, this happened in 2018. Was there some wrongdoing here? There, it's like with Bitmex kind of also kind of went through this motion as well. I think Bitrec was it. Bitrex did get hit fairly, like after they settled the DOJ and whatnot, I think it wasn't the same. Right. Yeah, it just.
00:12:38.124 - 00:12:51.212, Speaker B: If you look at their market share, you look at their position in the market, it was different. The question now is, is a DOJ going to move? And it seems like there. I mean, I would be shocked if there isn't.
00:12:51.308 - 00:12:51.708, Speaker A: Right.
00:12:51.796 - 00:13:23.130, Speaker B: The DOJ has probably something cooking as well for binance at least. So we'll see how. How the market reacts to that. But, yeah, I mean, there's a fair amount of scenarios here that you could think of. Like, so what is the outcome here? Like, I think finance us then delisted a bunch of assets, so move fairly quickly. You know, my working assumption is that this is going to be a fairly drawn out process. Both binance and Coinbase seem to be willing to fight it and have the resources to do so.
00:13:23.130 - 00:14:13.636, Speaker B: I think at the end of the day, I'm just looking at prior kind of precedent, and there probably is a fine for both. There probably is binance us may just shut down altogether. But I do want to emphasize, I think the, the allegations in the case against binance is much different, much more aggressive, has more substance, I think, than what it has for Coinbase. So the interesting thing about Coinbase, I think, is the market obviously reacted really. The stock itself, Coinbase opened down 20% on the day and then rallied subsequently. Last, it closed higher that day and then is up another. You know, I think it, like, opened a 48 and now it's up like $53 or so.
00:14:13.636 - 00:14:36.020, Speaker B: So Cathie Wood from, from Ark, like, bought like, over $20 million of it. And so there's a fair amount of support there. Coinbase retaliated with a good ad campaign. And, yeah, it's just really interesting that I think we're going to. I mean, we're at this sort of. I think the. Not.
00:14:36.020 - 00:15:10.784, Speaker B: I don't want to see the last innings, but we've been wanting regulatory clarity because a lot of people said, listen, guys, we've been wanting regulatory clarity for last, like, ten plus years. And this is what it looks like. I think we're finally, you know, coming closer to that event. What has been interesting is, and I've. We recorded a podcast yesterday with Avicul and Haseeb, and Avico says something that I actually believe in, have been saying for a while, which is you have to sort of have faith in rule of law in the court system. And what was it? I think there was a. The court responded the day after and said something to the nature of.
00:15:10.784 - 00:15:58.092, Speaker B: Because Coinbase and the SEC have been going at it for a while. And what was it that the circuit court said that by nature of this complaint or this suit, did it mean that the SEC was not going to respond to this, like, producing clarity or whatnot? Right. There's something there that I found super interesting. You probably know more about it, but basically my interpretation was, I think the court is kind of calling it and saying, yeah, we understand you're making a lot of noise, but you still need to respond to Coinbase. Coinbase has been asking you, has been trying to meet with you. You know, Brian alleged that when Gensler came to office, he tried to meet with him a number of times and he just kind of was not very receptive. Maybe it would have been COVID, but he didn't want to take a meeting.
00:15:58.092 - 00:16:13.624, Speaker B: When they finally met over video, he was like, very what seemed, quote unquote, cold. And Brian was like, hey, listen, we want to come and register. We want to, like, have a broker dealer license. He's like, I'm not here to give you guidance. Go talk to your lawyer.
00:16:14.644 - 00:16:21.796, Speaker A: Right. It's very frustrating because when Coinbase says, great how, like, help us register, the SEC sends them, you know, yeah, there's.
00:16:21.820 - 00:17:14.002, Speaker B: A great clip going around by one of the Robin Hood, um, council or in the team of Robin Hood that, you know, because Robin Hood also has and supports, like, trading a lot of these assets. Right. And, and he was like, he was against, I think he was, like, testifying and said, listen, we been trying to, like, register. We engage the SEC for months, nine months process, trying to understand how to do this in a, you know, in how they say, come in and like, register. We try to do that and then we got shut down nine months later. We just kind of didn't get really good clarity. And so, you know, it's, those things are really important because it's really, I think, you know, important to understand that, like, the court, I think, is going to see that and say, hey, listen, like, you can't just say that.
00:17:14.002 - 00:17:46.383, Speaker B: There's a process to do so. And there's these securities laws that have been, like, around for such a long time. There's actually not a clear way to go in and register and to claim to do this in a compliant way. Oh, and by the way, what is interesting now, some of the strategies lawyers were suggesting is if you take that same thing, well, then everything becomes a security. Like luxury goods become a security. And then if you take that same kind of strict stance that the SEC is taking on tokens, then you can extend that to practically a lot of other things. And so.
00:17:46.383 - 00:18:17.420, Speaker B: And so, yeah, it's just interesting. As an industry, I think I'm optimistic because people are rallying behind Coinbase and seeing that there's a solid effort here to fight it and to see it through. And genuinely people want to do the right thing. And there's a whole precedent and track record of, like, you know, Coinbase and other folks trying to do the right thing. And it's a us based business. It employs a bunch of people. You could argue, fine, binance, you know, it's been.
00:18:17.420 - 00:18:34.660, Speaker B: It doesn't have a jurisdiction. It kind of operates in this limbo and arbitrage, kind of like ft. You could argue that. I get it, but I am, and I think the industry is being rightfully so, more sympathetic to coinbase, which is just try to do the right thing and you got shut down and then slapped in the face for no, like, you know, it's like. It's bullying.
00:18:34.812 - 00:19:11.770, Speaker A: Yeah, I think there's a bunch of takeaways here. So, like, just to close the loop on the binance side of things, because I do want to share a little more info about Coinbase and maybe compare it to. I just want to talk about what they're actually being accused of here because I think it's pretty ridiculous. But to close the loop on binance, I think the lack of outflows that we were talking about earlier, that just shows me that the Middle east and Asia don't care at all about the SEC, and that's primarily where their user bases are, Middle east and Asia, and they don't care what Gensler is doing right now. I also think that it's just like they're going after the big bosses here and there's nowhere else to go. Right. Where.
00:19:11.770 - 00:19:32.650, Speaker A: Where else, like, users aren't moving off of binance and going to MexC or something, or like, there's really nowhere else to go. So I don't know, I just. It's been interesting. I'm curious to see what happens specifically with their US brand. I'm very curious if they just shut it down or there's this, like, other kind of long tail thing that could happen, which is CZ launches a new brand. Right. And.
00:19:32.650 - 00:19:40.444, Speaker A: Or like someone. Not CZ, but really CZ launches some totally different brand and it's called something else, or. Yeah.
00:19:40.524 - 00:19:42.116, Speaker B: And then users kind of migrate and.
00:19:42.140 - 00:19:56.820, Speaker A: Whatnot in the US. And so I also had a genius comm strategy. They announced that this guy, Richard Tang, who's one of like, the stars inside of Binance. I think he was a head regulator in Abu Dhabi or in Singapore. Singapore. Yeah, he was. He would be.
00:19:56.820 - 00:20:08.742, Speaker A: They were like, he's next in line after Cz. Phenomenal.com strategy. They released that the morning of the. Of the, of the lawsuit. They also. One of the big differences between Binance and Coinbase on Tuesday.
00:20:08.742 - 00:20:18.254, Speaker A: So the, the SEC sued Coinbase, but they also issued a restraining order to Binance to. To freeze all of Binance's assets to, quote, prevent destroying which.
00:20:18.294 - 00:20:19.942, Speaker B: Which has not been approved, by the way.
00:20:19.958 - 00:20:23.990, Speaker A: Which has not been approved. Yeah, but they did not issue the restraining order to Coinbase. Yeah.
00:20:24.022 - 00:20:52.538, Speaker B: So, so look, I think the most important thing here during this process is to fundamentally understand is, is this an FTX situation or not for Coinbase, not concerned. Candidly, binance, you observe withdrawals and any activity there is abnormal. Pay attention. You know, again, the best assumption is always be skeptical and curious in this space, no matter what. And in this situation, if you're a customer of Coinbase, you're a customer of some of this, like, custodian that apparently is going under. As always, just be vigilant. If.
00:20:52.538 - 00:21:33.780, Speaker B: If you're not holding your keys, you're not self custodying, if you're relying on Coinbase or binance, just understand there's risks and pay attention to what's going on. Don't freak out necessarily, but pay attention. And, yeah, I mean, I think for binance, it's very clear, you know, if they can honor withdrawals and they can continue to operate business as usual, then I'm less concerned. You know, the worst case scenario here is that there's this sort of bank run and there are, like, FTX was just don't have, are insolvent and have an issue with honoring withdrawals, not just in binance, us, but just finance regularly. Generally, that would be a big impact as a big, big blow to the space.
00:21:33.892 - 00:21:34.252, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:21:34.308 - 00:22:08.524, Speaker B: Otherwise you can argue facts and you can go back to 2018 and maybe there's some wrongdoing, maybe there's not enough policies, procedures in place or some sort of violation, if you will, of, you know, I'm not registered. Whatever it is, it's a fine, but it's. But customers don't get impacted. That's what I care about. And that's what I think as an industry, we should be highly vigilant and paying attention to, uh, because that's where things get really, um, you know, messy is when, when funds get locked and, or not even there. And so you want to avoid. Avoid your Celsius blockfi situation, you know?
00:22:08.564 - 00:22:30.824, Speaker A: Yeah. Um, to give shed a little more light into the Coinbase case, what they, um. I want to almost compare it to capital markets and show how capital markets works for a sec. So the TLDR for Coinbases, they charged them with being an unregistered broker dealer. They said that the assets on the platform are securities. They said that staking as a service is an unregistered service. And I think they also insinuated some things going on with the Coinbase wallet.
00:22:30.824 - 00:22:42.904, Speaker A: This is pretty interesting strategy. It was a coordinated attack with ten other states who issued cease and desist. I think several of the states issued cease and desist or warned them that cease and desist would be coming.
00:22:43.244 - 00:22:53.008, Speaker B: Yeah. And they have like 20 something days to respond. It was a fairly coordinated action from a number of states, Alabama and a bunch of others, to, like, go after them.
00:22:53.096 - 00:23:08.992, Speaker A: Right. Here's why this is a funny charge against Coinbase. There are three groups. If you try to simplify capital markets to like its bare bones, there are three groups that perform different actions. There are the exchanges, the broker dealers and the clearinghouses. Right. Crypto set up very differently.
00:23:08.992 - 00:23:43.816, Speaker A: And in capital markets, so the exchange brings together the buyers and the sellers is really the marketplace for the buyers and the sellers. The broker dealers represent the customer and bring the trades from the customer to the exchange. And then the clearinghouse settles the trades and is oftentimes the custodian. Right. In defi, you don't need, like, in defi, the analogy would be like uniswap is the exchange, metamask is the broker. ETH is the clearinghouse. In CFI, the SEC is very confused, I think, because market structure is different.
00:23:43.816 - 00:24:13.492, Speaker A: There's no broker dealer, first of all, because customers and consumers, customers and users basically just park their money with Coinbase. So there's no broker dealer, and then the clearing happens on the blockchain on ETH. So it's very frustrating when I see a case like this, because it just shows me that the SEC does not understand the market structure here, the market structure at play. So I don't know, there is an.
00:24:13.508 - 00:25:08.614, Speaker B: Argument to be made, like, and this was already kind of intimated a week before where binance was saying, hey, we're going to allow some of our institutional clients to custody their assets with an independent provider. And that for any trading that happens on the binance platform, you're calling sort of on that custodial to make sure there's proof of funds, and then you settle. Look, there is an argument to be made that, sure, you can probably disintermediate this and move closer to how traditional markets work, which is there's a segregation of where customer, like, the custodian, like, you know, being why melons of the world, and where you in, like, the prime broker and, like, make sure that there's a separation there for sake of, like, consumer protection, if you will. Like, I understand that argument. I think the infrastructure in crypto has been nascent and kind of, like, not very robust. Like, Coinbase has a Coinbase custody, of course. Could you custody that somewhere else and trade and settle with Coinbase? Sure.
00:25:08.614 - 00:25:41.054, Speaker B: Yeah, you can. And so, yeah, I mean, I don't know. I think that the thing that I was like, I think it was the head of policy at Bain Capital, um, I think it's tuong Veli. Uh, she heads regulatory and policy at bank capital Crypto. And she says, let's be clear, the SEC complaint doesn't mention this. This particularly about the Coinbase case. There is currently no way for a platform like Coinbase to register as a securities exchange broker or clearing agent.
00:25:41.054 - 00:26:21.644, Speaker B: That's why they've been begging the SEC for years to give them path to compliance. They haven't gotten it. Robin Hood, same thing. And so, you know, the Coinbase general counsel and Brian and the team just are really of the opinion that they deny, like, 90% of the assets that they review. They are the opinion that all these assets are not securities for a number of reasons. And so they kind of hold true to that and are holding a firm ground to that. There's also, like, an interesting observation by a few folks on Twitter that said all the assets that were listed on the complaint are, like, literally the front page of what you are, the landing page of Coinbase.
00:26:21.644 - 00:26:26.400, Speaker B: And so it sort of begs the question, did they just kind of look at that and take them or.
00:26:26.432 - 00:27:03.226, Speaker A: Well, I think this is really, like, if I'm in the. Like, if I'm. If I'm trying to give the SEC some advice here, it's like, don't go after every token, because, I don't know. I think it was. Haseeb said this, and this episode with Haseeb and eventual will come out in a couple days on Tuesday. But the Haseeb was like, if you put one or two people in timeout, then, like, it sucks for those people. If you go to a group of people and you're like, every single one of you are in timeout and you move, you move that whole group into timeout, well, then it doesn't have any effect because those people are all still together and they're kind of just like, well, this doesn't make sense if we're all in time out, or I think he used, he said jail.
00:27:03.226 - 00:27:14.866, Speaker A: So if the SEC is trying to enforce something, don't go after 100% of things because you're basically just forcing an industry to not be compliant. Go after one or two things that you really think of breaking the law here.
00:27:14.890 - 00:27:40.290, Speaker B: You know, that's a really frustrating thing, to be honest, which is, look, there is wrongdoing in crypto as there is in every other industry out there. You know, banks are fined constantly for violating KYC, ML and Ofac and all this stuff. It's just human behavior. There's just nature. There's fraud everywhere. And I really object when people say, well, this is the problem. Crypto facilitates crime, and it's a space that is, like, riddled with fraud.
00:27:40.290 - 00:28:11.730, Speaker B: I'm like, hold on a minute, look at. Show me. The data chain analysis produces great reports that indicate that less than 1%, less than 0.5% of transactions are nefarious and related to fraud and whatever. That's much lower than fiat. And so to say that crypto facilitates nefarious activity is actually wrong. Like Katie Hahn from Han consistently says time and time again, the only reason they were actually able to catch the people at Silk Road, because it was, everything was on the public blockchain.
00:28:11.730 - 00:28:55.008, Speaker B: Like, smart people will not use a block. Now, of course, there's a Lazarus group and some of these entities that, like, have hacked protocols and have been able to finance themselves because, like, I understand that that's a separate issue of, like, security and smart contracts and whatnot. But, you know, I think I always go back to, and I think this is one of the first episodes that I had with Rebecca. And, and even in private conversations, I ask people, it's like, the point of the SEC is to stimulate a few things, one capital formation. And you could argue that their behavior has really hindered, that it has moved capital and innovation away from the US. And this is. Go back to the hearing, right? We had against her like a month ago.
00:28:55.008 - 00:29:16.390, Speaker B: And this is a huge point that, like, in the, in the testimony, they were really pressing him on that. It's like you fail on capital formation. People are really scared to build in the US. And this is a growing, thriving industry. It's going elsewhere. It's going to Hong Kong, it's going to Dubai, it's going to Europe. So capital formation has been really impacted because of these bullying behavior and lack of clarity.
00:29:16.390 - 00:29:54.830, Speaker B: And the second one is consumer protection. Who's actually getting harmed? I understand. My point here is because we don't have clarity and we're in this limbo, it opens a vector for some of the fraudsters to actually take advantage of that. FTX, prime example, it operated offshore in this gray area. Coinbase, on the other hand, has been trying to do the right thing in the US. And you could, you, you could argue, well, wait a minute, but they've listed all these assets and they're down 90%. I'm like, an equity markets are not, and pink sheets are not like, let's talk about consumer education and accreditation laws.
00:29:54.862 - 00:29:55.110, Speaker A: Fine.
00:29:55.142 - 00:30:20.554, Speaker B: Maybe there's a better way to understand that people should be trading these things, but you can't necessarily take an opinion. It's not the role of the SEC is my understanding, to take an opinion on whether the companies that they approve to go public, whether it's a SPAC, which is worthless now, or, you know, true. Like, you know what I mean? Like, it is not their opinion. It is not their role to take an opinion on the assets and the securities that they kind of approve or not.
00:30:20.594 - 00:30:20.866, Speaker A: Right.
00:30:20.930 - 00:30:22.866, Speaker B: They oversee. They're not curious.
00:30:22.930 - 00:30:43.008, Speaker A: We're so beyond trying to be reasonable. Like we have gone, you know what I mean? Like regulation by the last couple of years were regulation by enforcement. And we were all really frustrated. It's like you can't regulate something. Just enlisting the world. No, I, this is a clear signal that we have shifted from regulation by enforcement to trying to ban an industry by enforcement. Market difference.
00:30:43.008 - 00:30:44.864, Speaker A: In my mind, that's where I was going.
00:30:44.904 - 00:31:24.136, Speaker B: Because Ganser really was, I think in his interview, he was interviewed at both CNBC and Bloomberg the day of. And he, he said, you know, he said something really interesting, which is what I was just saying. It's not our role to take an opinion on the particular things that we like, supervise and oversee. And then he said some. And then he proceeded to saying, but I actually think that basically this industry is worthless and should cease to exist. And the, that's the only role here is that's why we have a dollar and the digital, that likes central bank digital currency. And he said, so he's very opinionated and he's not like that with securities.
00:31:24.136 - 00:31:58.340, Speaker B: Right. You don't see him talking about some of the companies that have gone bankrupt and public stocks that have gone to zero in here. It's actually, it's quite telling. Right. Because then he's basically telling you he wants this industry to cease to exist. And the natural question is, we've talked about what is the probability of crypto being banned in the US? Like, gold was banned in the thirties. I think that probability is shifted dramatically after the events that have transpired this week.
00:31:58.532 - 00:32:10.064, Speaker A: It's something interesting. I mean, you know, Mike asked me this week, he's like, if crypto got banned, would you, would you leave? Would you leave the US? It's an interesting. Yeah.
00:32:10.424 - 00:32:11.324, Speaker B: Would you.
00:32:13.624 - 00:32:21.404, Speaker A: If crypto got banned in the US? If it was illegal to hold crypto in the US? Yeah, yeah, I would, I would leave. I would leave.
00:32:23.304 - 00:32:54.984, Speaker B: What does that look like, though? Like, if people, like, I forget what happened when gold was banned, but basically he said, if you don't, what happens if you, like, don't surrender it? You hold private keys. How do they enforce that? Uh, I think, mind you, they hold a bunch of bitcoin that has been seized over the years. Like, what? They're. Well, that's also the irony. They've been trading on a, what they claim to be an unregistered exchange or whatnot, broker dealer. They're selling their bitcoin through Coinbase. The government is.
00:32:54.984 - 00:33:13.924, Speaker B: So what happens in that point? Like, what happens to the bitcoin? The US government holds? Like, they could just. You have to surrender it. You have to send it to their wallet. You have to. You get a stable coin. Like, what happens? Like, I'm just kind of really curious, practically, like, what would happen in that scenario?
00:33:15.664 - 00:33:28.704, Speaker A: You got to go hand in. You got to go. There's a. There's a price that someone sets and you have to go hand it in for that price, right? Yeah, I guess, you know, um. Yeah, yeah, I think this, uh.
00:33:28.744 - 00:33:35.144, Speaker B: What's your. I mean, I. This seems to be, like. I would assume that it's going to be a fairly drawn out process.
00:33:36.124 - 00:33:58.870, Speaker A: I just looked it up. Americans who did. Not all Americans were. Were required to turn in their gold before May 1, 1933, to the fed in return for $20.67 of paper money. Americans who did not turn in their gold were subject to arrest on criminal charges and faced up to ten years in federal prisons. An exception was made for dentists who could own up to 100oz.
00:33:58.932 - 00:34:00.934, Speaker B: Right, because cavities or whatnot.
00:34:01.794 - 00:34:05.294, Speaker A: Huh? Yeah, yeah.
00:34:05.594 - 00:34:06.986, Speaker B: So here's.
00:34:07.010 - 00:34:32.230, Speaker A: But here's. Here's the difference onto, um. Well, I guess this isn't a difference with gold, but, uh, the beauty of crypto is you can't kill. You can't kill crypto. And the reason is the aspect is, is the aspect of self custody. So with equities, if you want to go create a new, let's say they shut down the custodians for equity equities. Equities are dead because you can't, you can't just go create a new custodian for equities with crypto.
00:34:32.230 - 00:34:52.800, Speaker A: You can't. If you, if you kill exchanges, you can just, you can't kill, you can just go pop up a new self custody exchange. Right? You can go pop up another Dex or pop up another metamask or something like that. You can go buy some ledgers like that is the beauty of this. So, I mean, you can make it really annoying, but like, you can't kill, you can't kill self custody assets.
00:34:52.982 - 00:34:56.544, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, look at, I mean, China's been trying to bank crypto for a while.
00:34:56.964 - 00:35:23.328, Speaker A: I do think it. So here's the, here's the SEC playbook that I think they're running. They started small, got some wins, ether deltas of the world. Then they went bigger bitrixes of the world. Now they're going for the biggest exchanges, Coinbase and Binance. What comes next after this? They either stop and focus on Coinbase and finance in these and these suits, which will take years, by the way, or, I mean, we, seems like we know Gary Gensler at this point. I don't think he's slowing down anytime soon.
00:35:23.328 - 00:35:42.592, Speaker A: I think this is when they now come for the protocols. And what that looks like is you send a subpoena to a protocol, you say you've got two to three weeks to hand over every single internal slack message you've ever sent, any email the founders have ever sent, any emails. The teams, the exec team has ever sent anything you've ever posted on social, everything.
00:35:42.648 - 00:35:50.530, Speaker B: But they're, they're doing that already. Right? I mean, they, we've known that for particularly, like some, like Terra, they've been in tornado, like, they've been like.
00:35:50.722 - 00:35:53.826, Speaker A: I think it comes for all the, for all the Defi protocols.
00:35:53.890 - 00:35:56.186, Speaker B: My understanding is it's been going on for a while now.
00:35:56.370 - 00:36:22.944, Speaker A: It, it has been, but I think it, it's about to start getting more and more public. And also it's been happening for a little, little while now. So if you give someone three weeks to hand it over, that maybe that was two months ago, then they need a month or two to review it, and then they, I think, unfortunately for some of these protocols, you have folks who maybe when they were three people, they weren't thinking about an SEC subpoena. So they probably said some pretty things that will seem very damning on slack messages. Right?
00:36:23.524 - 00:36:35.484, Speaker B: Yeah, well, you know, look, I mean, I think I am of still of the mind that some regulation, some policy will be constructive and be helpful for the industry.
00:36:35.644 - 00:36:37.746, Speaker A: Yeah. I also think this will speed that up. Right.
00:36:37.770 - 00:36:42.250, Speaker B: I think, I mean, I'm hopeful and I think if, if we align on the things that really matter, which is.
00:36:42.282 - 00:36:44.882, Speaker A: I think this will accelerate legislation, hopefully.
00:36:45.018 - 00:37:15.158, Speaker B: Consumer protection. Yeah, like there's a bill that we want to discuss in the next regulatory pod that I think is super interesting in the US. What is it, the McHenry bill or something. And I think that's a great step forward. So ultimately, I think. But we have to make sure that we're constantly thinking about what's the North Star here? And it's always for regulations, consumer protection. So what are the things that we can do as an industry to make sure that it's a fair playing ground, that is fair.
00:37:15.158 - 00:37:39.724, Speaker B: Capital markets. Right. That information disclosures are there. I'm still thinking of that department that the SEC created to allow for issuers, token issuers, if you will, to provide information. Now, if you have a central repository where you submit the token vesting, the token smart contract information, like everything. A lot of this stuff is on chain. Like crypto protocols are.
00:37:39.724 - 00:38:26.504, Speaker B: I mean, I don't want to say contrary to popular belief, but I just want to make sure that people appreciate crypto protocols are fairly transparent in the amount of stuff that is available on chain to inspect the contracts and the wallets and the move of funds and all this stuff. I mean, you can make the argument, well, not everyone's technical enough to read these smart contracts. Point taken. Well, let's. Let's do something about that, right? Let's create a someone, an agency or whatnot, a group that interprets that and gives a credit rating. Like there's a DeFi score. That, you know, there is, I think a consortium that the DeFi Safety alliance or something, that I think Coinbase and a bunch of others like, created to self police and like to rate these protocols, DeFi protocols in particular.
00:38:26.504 - 00:39:41.824, Speaker B: So, I mean, those are the things that we should be talking about and focused on. It's like, okay, how do we make sure that Ben eats of the world? Like, I mean, if people want to send money to him, like, that's like charity, but make sure that people understand what they're doing. Make this a more friendly, safe environment, whether it's interacting through Coinbase base, and making sure people understand the difference between self custody and not managing their own private key. These are the things that we should be really focusing on because those are the things where consumers have been hurt, not, you know, it's clear that, like, people want access. Financial inclusion is a big point that I will make over and over again the amount of wealth that has been created since the nineties because people, very select few, very select group of people been able to invest in private enterprises because they're accredited on this random, arbitrary rule that is outdated. And it's so bad that it's just like, if you have a certain amount of money, then you can invest. Whereas maybe you should be focusing on are they knowledgeable enough? And can you make some things simple things like a test that they should take on? I mean, look, binance, call it what it is, yeah, it has like, perps and products.
00:39:41.824 - 00:40:11.096, Speaker B: They allow you to go on margin and all this stuff, but at least they, like, you have to go through a test to, like, you know, an investor suitability thing that a lot of banks also make. You know, are you sophisticated enough to trade these products? What's your level of experience? And there's a rubric, you know, that you could argue we could improve her and make it more specific for crypto, but nonetheless, you know, I think those are the things that really matter. But unfortunately, we're like, a lot of this is just a distraction.
00:40:11.220 - 00:40:11.976, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:40:12.160 - 00:40:40.804, Speaker B: You don't have an opinion. Is doge a good asset or not? And people think it's worthless. Well, sorry, folks, but, like, that's for the market to determine. But all you can do is make sure that people have the resources at their disposal and everyone's in an equal playing field, where if there's any information but the devs, if there's any information about the protocol and the people behind it, it is readily available to everyone on an equal basis. That is what matters the most.
00:40:40.844 - 00:40:41.044, Speaker A: Then.
00:40:41.084 - 00:41:08.116, Speaker B: Then people can make a determination whether we want to buy or sell the token or the stock or whatever. You know, I mean, that's it. That's all you can do. You can't tell people what they're going to spend their money on or where they want to invest if you want to buy meme coin, everything is a social construct. So that's it. Like, at least arm people with the right resources and avenues to educate themselves. You can only lead the horse to the water.
00:41:08.116 - 00:41:08.756, Speaker B: That's it.
00:41:08.820 - 00:41:09.044, Speaker A: Right.
00:41:09.084 - 00:41:33.758, Speaker B: And that's a role of regulators. And here they're clearly overstepping. They're having an opinion on whether these things are value or not, I'm sorry, but that's not the role of a regulator. It's really not. It never has been. And I think that's where the courts are really going to clamp down on. And I think that's if they fail to do that, then we have a bigger problem on our hands because it sets a really bad precedent on other things.
00:41:33.758 - 00:42:16.046, Speaker B: The state should only protect people, but there's, there's, there's, you know, there's a great meme that said, like, a wallpoint, like the US, like, it started because they tried to tax their tea way back in the day. And now, you know, we have these agencies that are really, I think, overstepping in telling people where they can and protecting them from crypto. Well, folks like, people are going to do this and going to find a way to, because young generations want to do this. Like, there's an interest in the public sphere to get access to these things. All you can do is, it's really dumb to say, no, you're not going to do this. It's like, it's like if your kid wants candy and you tell him he's.
00:42:16.070 - 00:42:52.672, Speaker A: Going to find, here's why they're doing it now, is because it's easy to do all this stuff when everyone's losing money and prices are going down. Once prices like bull market, very tough to do this stuff. This is, I think this is so egregious, uh, such an egregious overstep that this will actually be good for crypto. I think politicians will see this and think that they went too far. I think users and consumers all are on the same page already. So Valora is the ultimate wallet for exploring the celo ecosystem.

00:43:41.144 - 00:43:45.152, Speaker B: I don't think I've ever bought anything from there. Although maybe you will now.
00:43:45.248 - 00:43:49.730, Speaker A: Louis Vuitton. $39,000. Not dollar. Euro.
00:43:49.882 - 00:43:51.026, Speaker B: $41,000.
00:43:51.130 - 00:43:52.170, Speaker A: Yeah, $41,000.
00:43:52.202 - 00:43:56.162, Speaker B: NFT 100 and 693. Now the collection.
00:43:56.218 - 00:44:13.666, Speaker A: I'm just going to read this. Vogue actually published it. The collection of phigital. Oh, God, I hate that word so much. The collection of phigital treasure trunks marks the first time that the luxury brand will sell nfts, which will act as an access pass to future products and more. Thirty nine k. And it actually seems to be.
00:44:13.666 - 00:44:33.244, Speaker A: Let me read the fine print. Louis Vuitton is guarding access to via in other ways as holders cannot sell or give it to another person, which is a contrast to many of the original high value communities. The brand refers to it as a soul bound collectible, which is a new concept in the past year to facilitate loyalty and discourage flipping.
00:44:33.944 - 00:44:36.736, Speaker B: I like that. Non transferable, right?
00:44:36.840 - 00:44:40.404, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I like, I like the soul bound concept here. I think this is cool.
00:44:41.244 - 00:44:50.684, Speaker B: Yeah, it's really impressive. You know, a lot of people ask me, I'm based in Europe and I've noticed that people here are just more positive on the space generally.
00:44:50.804 - 00:44:51.268, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:44:51.356 - 00:45:42.456, Speaker B: Even old timers, like, you know, which has not been the case for a long time. But now, like, you see, like, these are the catalysts that I'm looking at that I think these headlines go unobserved and, like, just in this kind of market. But mind you, this is the largest luxury conglomerate in the world. And, you know, Tiffany did the pendants for the punks. And, you know, I think, again, Tiffany's also owned by LVMH and, and Louis Vuitton now doing this, it's, it's a huge milestone. I think, like, to push a space forward. Like, anyone that says that NFTs are dead, like, you, you know, like, what is what comes next, right? Because when you have a brand like that start doing this, it makes a big splash and then all other luxury brands are gonna then pay attention.
00:45:42.456 - 00:46:23.656, Speaker B: Like Gucci, I think, did a collaboration with Adidas then, and also with g money, I believe. Like, was it adidas with g money? And then gucci, I think, is also experimented with NFT. So, like, these things are percolating. I think, you know, marketers are appreciating how important this is, both from a new type of segment of the market that they're willing to capture the price point that they're willing, like, they're able to capture from a consumer intelligence and retention standpoint, makes a lot of sense. Like, yeah, I mean, it's a, it's a big deal, I think. And basically that this NFT, like, if you were to buy it, the, the whole, the value prop here is you're gonna get access to things that, before.
00:46:23.720 - 00:46:32.830, Speaker A: Others do your first asset and you get exclusive access to things. I love this strategy. You're paying forty k to be able to spend more money.
00:46:32.982 - 00:46:37.394, Speaker B: I mean, like, mind you, a lot of people, like, they do.
00:46:38.574 - 00:46:48.634, Speaker A: I don't know if this is public. Well, I guess it'll be public now that I'm sure. The first one is being shown at fashion week, at pharrell's fashion week next week. This is. Yeah, this is cool.
00:46:49.094 - 00:47:02.976, Speaker B: And is it just like, get invited to, like, special events and products? Like, by holding this access card, you basically get access to the first drop, if you will, of like, limited items, physical items.
00:47:03.040 - 00:47:15.644, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess. So let me ask you this. Why. So I know you think it's cool. Why did this have to be an NFT if it's not transferable? Why, why do you, why does, why should Louis Vuitton do this as an NFT?
00:47:19.264 - 00:47:23.792, Speaker B: And what you're saying is, could they have just experiment? Yeah, they have just done this with.
00:47:23.808 - 00:47:29.120, Speaker A: Like, membership, club membership, names on an excel spreadsheet with some macros and called it a.
00:47:29.232 - 00:47:32.184, Speaker B: Sure. They could. They very well could.
00:47:32.304 - 00:47:32.704, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:47:32.784 - 00:48:32.150, Speaker B: Um, I think it's the appreciation from the management team there that NFTs the, whether you want to believe it or not, and whether the customer today appreciates this idea that it is recorded in a public blockchain, you could argue is a little farfetched today, but over time, it become more and more important. There is a consortium of luxury brands that have come together. I don't know if Louis Vuitton is part of this, but I think caring group and a few others have come together to create this kind of consortium of blah, a standard for NFTs. And so you kind of want to have a succeed sometimes creates really great metaphors. And I'm going to borrow this term from him. A Switzerland in the sky is what NFTs ultimately, or blockchains ultimately are. Right.
00:48:32.150 - 00:48:56.710, Speaker B: You have this, like, think about airline points and how fragmented those are, and credit card points. There's partnerships between certain airlines and you can use those points. But, like, I think it was this week where, like, united or some airline really, like, demoted the value of your points on whim. There's no freely traded market for that. The options again, it's all about consumer preference and expanding that.
00:48:56.742 - 00:48:56.910, Speaker A: Right?
00:48:56.942 - 00:49:50.418, Speaker B: And so you have to create Switzerland in the sky, meaning a neutral standard where these things can, maybe it's not transferable today, but having it in a credibly neutral kind of in environment and public blockchain allows you to do other things down the road. Right. You know, think about the entire portfolio of brands that LVMH has. Well, if you have maybe this NFT, then maybe you can port it over to other things. And I just think from an ease of use and like, the ability that you have from having all this in a, in, in an NFT format just makes more sense to allow you to do other things in the future that the customer will probably appreciate. But it certainly comes out like there is this friction. User is going to have to create a wallet.
00:49:50.418 - 00:50:04.500, Speaker B: And on the back and the security component, sure, it's not transferable, but you can lose your private keys and all this stuff. And how can you do it? I think the front ends are there where you can abstract away a lot of this complexity today. Right. With wallets, I think they're trying to.
00:50:04.532 - 00:50:45.270, Speaker A: Reach a crowd that maybe is already semi crypto friendly. Like, I think this is, maybe the comparison you might be able to make is 20 years ago, someone, or 15 years ago, someone saying, why should our brand go create an Instagram account or a Facebook account? We can go reach our users via email. Like, we can send them the message on email. And there's probably some young person on the marketing team that was like, no, no, no, we need to create an Instagram account because there are these new, a new group of users and we need to meet them where they are and we need to put our stuff in the context of what they enjoy doing. Um, so we need to get on Instagram. And the brands that got on Instagram early, you know, obviously crushed it. And so I think this is like, lvmh, this is what, so a thousand NFT.
00:50:45.270 - 00:50:53.550, Speaker A: How many nFts are they selling here? Let's say they sold a thousand of these things at 39. Yeah, that's $39 million for a company that made.
00:50:53.742 - 00:50:55.822, Speaker B: They made it doesn't.
00:50:55.878 - 00:51:15.822, Speaker A: $79.2 billion doesn't not compete in, but not just Louie, this is lVmh, $79.2 billion. It's not about the money for them right now. I think this is them trying to meet this new cohort of very wealthy, younger, digital native folks where they are.
00:51:15.918 - 00:51:28.894, Speaker B: Let me tell you one thing. What's the whole point about luxury? Luxury goods bevellum goods flexing. Exactly. Is there a better way to flex than having it in a public register where everyone can see it?
00:51:29.014 - 00:51:29.714, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:51:30.654 - 00:51:46.270, Speaker B: Right. You could claim you can upload a picture that you were at the Runway show or whatever, but if you have this NFT, it's a flex, it's free marketing for them. You mean like that's really it, right? I mean, I think it's cool.
00:51:46.302 - 00:51:59.430, Speaker A: I think it's cool to see, I mean, another one of their portfolio companies, Tiffany's, right? Tiffany sold out. So. Yeah, sold out. Those NFTs sold out in 20 minutes. They made twelve and a half million bucks. So I think you'll continue to see this from LMA.
00:51:59.502 - 00:52:09.734, Speaker B: The price point. The price point historically of nfts relative to other luxury goods is fairly high. Like board apes, punks like, these are 100,000 purchases. You're buying a car as a picture.
00:52:09.854 - 00:52:10.554, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:52:10.974 - 00:52:18.284, Speaker B: It's not trivial. Like, not everyone spends it, but even a mint of 25 e, that's a lot of capital. Like that's, that's a lot.
00:52:18.334 - 00:52:22.204, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah, I think it's cool.
00:52:23.864 - 00:52:24.644, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:52:25.424 - 00:52:59.856, Speaker A: Last thing to talk about, actually, I said I didn't want to talk about this, but I do think it's just for the arbitrum bug, I think it's important to kind of dispel some of the fuD. So let me just explain it really quickly to folks. Um, on, uh, there's some, like if you were on Twitter this week, you probably saw some, some fud, uh, from other ecosystems out arbitrum, like canceling transactions or the sequencer going down. That is not what happened. Basically, arbitrum stopped sending transactions to mainnet for about 2 hours on Wednesday. And the reason was a software bug that affected the roll up sequencer. But if you actually look at it, everything's fine with arbitrum.
00:52:59.856 - 00:53:27.240, Speaker A: Basically what happened is. So things happen on arbitrum, right? They're an l two, so things happen. And every so often they have to send those transactions to Ethereum, back to the l one. This basically just left. There was $2.2 billion that was in the lurch, basically like sitting on the l two that wasn't confirmed and sent back to the, back to the l one. And let me just, they posted this good thread about it.
00:53:27.240 - 00:53:57.392, Speaker A: Hold on, I'm going to read. There's one point that I wanted to read from it in order. Okay. In order for the nodes to send, this is my understanding of it, in order for the nodes to send transactions to Ethereum, there are one of the, the wallet that's associated with the node needs enough ETH to pay for the transaction fees. And the sequencer spent the five ETH that it had. But the gas refunder, which had, I think, 250 ETH, like plenty of ETH in it, didn't refill it until it posted the successful batch. That's just a software bug.
00:53:57.392 - 00:54:01.324, Speaker A: So I think this is, I think this is nothing to worry about.
00:54:01.824 - 00:54:04.964, Speaker B: Yeah, it's back operational for what it's worth.
00:54:06.444 - 00:54:10.344, Speaker A: Cool. What else?
00:54:10.644 - 00:54:33.428, Speaker B: Well, just briefly touching on two things. One, there's a great episode coming up next week we've alluded to during this podcast with Avico and Haseeb. These are great thinkers. They don't agree on everything, but we talked about the state of the market. They're both dragonfly and electric, both well respected venture funds. Different strategies, different geographies, but they're great thinkers. I think you'll enjoy that discussion, so tune into that.
00:54:33.428 - 00:55:18.232, Speaker B: I really enjoyed that, but it's always good to bring them on. And, you know, I think they, a lot of times people complain that you and I agree on a lot of things, although we've tried to, we don't coordinate or anything. We just kind of come on here and talk about stuff. But these guys really have a fresh take on a number of things and including regulation, including how they're investing, macro and a number of things. So I just felt like we could go on and on in that episode and some things that we didn't even touch on, like, uh, you know, blockchain architecture and is it a multi chain world and monolithic versus, you know, other types of design constructs and, um, secondary market activity. There's so much that we could talk about and so we're going to bring them on again. But I think that was a very neat episode, at least from my perspective.
00:55:18.288 - 00:55:25.284, Speaker A: Yeah, last thing I wanted to talk about that, I forgot to ask you, what did you think of Apple, Apple's vision Pro? You have thoughts on this?
00:55:25.824 - 00:55:49.060, Speaker B: Well, I, I tweeted about this and said, like, apple is the most valuable company in the world because it has turned skeptics into lovers. Like, so many people are skeptical. Skeptical of the smartphone. And I was skeptical of the iPad. I said, why do I need this? Like, I already have a smartphone. And I ended up buying an iPad. Airpods too.
00:55:49.060 - 00:55:57.780, Speaker B: Like, I remember I was, I was able to get my hands on an AirPod super early and I was walking on the street and people were like thinking I was like mentally insane. I was like, I thought the AirPods.
00:55:57.812 - 00:56:01.054, Speaker A: Were so dumb when I first saw them. I was like, those horrible.
00:56:01.204 - 00:56:04.626, Speaker B: My parents were like, why are you buying this? People work. Like, you look dumb.
00:56:04.690 - 00:56:10.254, Speaker A: Like, remember the Apple Watch? The Apple Watch got shredded. People were like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:56:11.114 - 00:56:45.212, Speaker B: And so I'm reminded of that. I think it's, um. So I've looked at, like, a number back when I was at save you, like, we looked at way back, like, we were looking at, like, the, the chips for these, for these devices, and they were just not there. This is like seven years ago. Um, and a big issue with these things is that if there's any lag between what, what is being rendered and what you're like and your. How you're moving it create, it's super nauseating. Like any sort of lag in your occipital system, which is a bound.
00:56:45.212 - 00:57:08.404, Speaker B: Like, the little, like, things in your ear that, like, make sure that you don't, like, totally fall off a cliff. There's any lag with that. You immediately get dizzy. And so in the initial tests of, like, oculus, early versions and HTC and all these devices, like, the people were puking because it was just super not. You couldn't, like, you couldn't do this for more than five minutes. But it's come a long way. Like, I think the, the.
00:57:08.404 - 00:57:34.598, Speaker B: I'm really excited about it. I think I'll buy it and it's, it's pretty cool. Like, I think at least in many ways. Like, the question is, does it replace, like, your laptop or does it replace your smartphone? I don't know, but it's kind of like this. They are also exceptionally good, and they are the most valuable company in the world because they create markets. So I think in this case, I don't think it replaces anything. It just is a complimentary.
00:57:34.598 - 00:57:46.494, Speaker B: But I'm more excited about, like, at least standing more vertically upright and seeing things and interacting with my world and, like, looking down on my screen, you know, at a minimum, I think we're gonna have less, like, posture problems.
00:57:46.654 - 00:58:07.284, Speaker A: Yeah. There's also pretty remarkable to think about this. So I have the oculus and I really rarely use it. Pretty interesting to see, like, I mean, this technology has been out for a while. Interesting to see the response to this, which is very excited, I would say, compared to the oculus. Um, one takeaway is, uh, man, like, the marketing is so different. It, it.
00:58:07.284 - 00:58:32.812, Speaker A: This showed me how good Apple is at marketing. Right? Like, I mean, you already know that Apple doesn't. Facebook released a product, and Facebook talks about the Oculus, like a product with things you can do on it. Apple only talks about the vision around something, right? They, like, they're just so freaking good at painting the picture. And I think Apple also just has this amazing ability to take old technology. Like, smartphones were around. They made it happen.
00:58:32.812 - 00:58:49.854, Speaker A: Or even like, they can take old technology and make it work. And a really good example of this is actually, is Apple Pay. Right? Like, that was Android tech that had been around, but, like, you could only use it in, like, 1% of places. Apple Pay. I really rarely use credit cards anymore. It's all apple. Yeah.
00:58:50.794 - 00:58:54.146, Speaker B: They just have a dominant ecosystem of things.
00:58:54.330 - 00:59:12.496, Speaker A: Yeah, well, it showed the differences on consumer preferences around privacy, too. Right. And how people perceive Facebook and Apple. Like, when people think about the Oculus, they're like, ooh, Facebook can now see inside my living room with, like, 4k clarity. When people see the like. And I don't know, people are scared.
00:59:12.520 - 00:59:13.604, Speaker B: Of such a good point.
00:59:14.064 - 00:59:18.324, Speaker A: And then people think about Apple and they're like, oh, they're like a privacy forward company.
00:59:18.824 - 01:00:03.380, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, I think the other thing to note is the price point is fairly high. But I do think that, like, the. Any estimate of how, like, people saying, oh, they're gonna not sell bunch, I think they'll quickly recoup all they've invested in R and D, like, first year alone. And, yeah, it's just going to be incredibly exciting how people use this and how that, you know, the entire, like, you know, the iPhone created an entire App Store and all these different companies, and I'm just really excited to see what's going to be that next evolution of games and companies and how they create different experiences, because it's. You correct me here, but it's sort of like I was debating whether to call it VR or Ar, like, virtual reality. Augmented reality.
01:00:03.380 - 01:00:29.192, Speaker B: It feels like it is augmented reality because at least in the demos, like, you see your surroundings and it blends really nicely, kind of your living room, if you will, with kind of the things that you're seeing. But it also is kind of virtual reality. I don't know, it's kind of like a hybrid. And I think that's the elegance of this product. But I haven't seen it. But everyone that has gotten their hands on it is raving about it, or at least most people.
01:00:29.388 - 01:00:35.064, Speaker A: Yeah. Ar, VR, it's mister. It's mixed reality.
01:00:35.104 - 01:00:48.808, Speaker B: It's all. That's right. Maybe that's the best way to call it. What is it? What do they call it? Spatial? What is it. I think there's a specific term that they came out with. Spatial computing.
01:00:48.856 - 01:00:51.152, Speaker A: Spatial computing processing. Yeah.
01:00:51.248 - 01:00:59.004, Speaker B: Someone was saying control f. Every venture fund, every venture fund in the space is now updating their, uh, criteria of things that are investing in spatial.
01:00:59.384 - 01:01:02.032, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah.
01:01:02.088 - 01:01:08.128, Speaker B: So anyone that's, like, migrated from investing in crypto to AI now consider maybe also going into, uh.
01:01:08.176 - 01:01:09.848, Speaker A: Yeah, going to spatial domain. Go.
01:01:09.896 - 01:01:20.004, Speaker B: Definitely going to spatial. Uh, funny enough, Apple now is a three flirting, $3 trillion market cap, which, uh, is tied with France.
01:01:21.384 - 01:01:24.694, Speaker A: With France. You said, who brings more value to the world.
01:01:26.194 - 01:01:30.694, Speaker B: It's. Now. I think Apple alone is, like, the 7th or 8th largest economy in the world.
01:01:31.074 - 01:01:32.174, Speaker A: Tied with friends.
01:01:32.634 - 01:01:47.850, Speaker B: I was. I was in Iceland earlier this year, and I was reminded of, like, the populations, like, shy of was looking at these stats. I'm like. And I was comparing it. So Amazon employs, like, five icelands. It's crazy. Like, 1.6
01:01:47.850 - 01:01:49.652, Speaker B: million people just.
01:01:49.708 - 01:01:49.940, Speaker A: It's.
01:01:49.972 - 01:01:51.700, Speaker B: It's wild. It. It's, uh.
01:01:51.732 - 01:01:52.740, Speaker A: It's crazy.
01:01:52.932 - 01:02:14.284, Speaker B: This, uh, we always come out with, uh, books and documentaries or movies that found interesting. This reminds me of the network state when we talk about, like, companies being this large and protocols potentially being this large. Like, it's not too far fetched. I mean, these countries will. These companies eventually. Protocols can wield a lot of influence. I mean, they do.
01:02:14.324 - 01:02:14.620, Speaker A: Right.
01:02:14.692 - 01:02:33.370, Speaker B: Um, but, you know, they have cults, they have values. They have systems in place. Like, I'm constantly reminded that, like, the construct of a nation state is. Is fairly new, and a lot of these countries are fairly new, and they're etched by, like, diplomacy and things like, just that may or may not withstand the test of time.
01:02:33.562 - 01:02:34.334, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:02:34.834 - 01:02:45.646, Speaker B: And so, like, do you have a greater affiliation to apple than to your team, like, your national team? I don't know. Like, it's just, like, blurred lines now.
01:02:45.830 - 01:02:48.454, Speaker A: Pretty damn affiliated with Apple. I'll say. I'm pretty locked.
01:02:48.534 - 01:02:54.422, Speaker B: I say, like, you definitely stand by apple, but right now, like, you know, there's, like, apple shipping.
01:02:54.438 - 01:02:57.622, Speaker A: There's, like, 40 years ago. I'm like, why? Like, that thing actually makes sense.
01:02:57.678 - 01:03:14.044, Speaker B: You know, you're a loyalist to apple, but, you know, who knows? Like, you're more like the people that buy apple than perhaps, like, someone in middle America because you live in New York, you know? I mean, it's like, it's different now. Anyways, I saw the movie air.
01:03:14.824 - 01:03:15.296, Speaker A: Mmm.
01:03:15.360 - 01:03:17.936, Speaker B: That. Is that the Nike one with, like, Michael Jordan and.
01:03:18.000 - 01:03:19.888, Speaker A: I don't know. You. You saw it. You tell me.
01:03:20.056 - 01:03:22.768, Speaker B: No, no, I'm black. I was not sure that was.
01:03:22.816 - 01:03:25.112, Speaker A: Yeah, the mike. That's the story of the Michael Jordan. Yeah, right.
01:03:25.248 - 01:03:29.264, Speaker B: Amazing. I'm just a nike. Like, I love running. I love nike. I've always.
01:03:29.304 - 01:03:36.764, Speaker A: I mean, next time, next time. We're recording this. I'm in the office right now, but I'll record it from home. I'll turn the camera. I have a photo of Phil Knight on my wall, actually.
01:03:37.224 - 01:03:40.084, Speaker B: Shoe dog fantastic book. I'm just gonna analyze.
01:03:40.984 - 01:03:45.680, Speaker A: Best entrepreneur book of all time. Hands down. Book is insane.
01:03:45.872 - 01:03:57.216, Speaker B: Yeah, it's. It's. It's just amazing. So either go out, watch the movie air, or read the book. It's great companion. Shoe dog fantastic. Like, those two make for a great weekend, I think.
01:03:57.400 - 01:03:58.164, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:03:59.224 - 01:04:00.924, Speaker B: Anything else you found interesting?
01:04:02.004 - 01:04:05.064, Speaker A: Still read this book on poverty. It's pretty depressing.
01:04:07.324 - 01:04:10.184, Speaker B: Guys. Ignore that and go watch.
01:04:10.884 - 01:04:24.956, Speaker A: I mean, people should read this book. It's pretty, pretty eye opening, but also pretty depressing. So it's bear market. I probably wouldn't recommend that go read shoe dog perseverance story. Definitely. Yeah.
01:04:25.140 - 01:04:40.644, Speaker B: All right, folks, well, thanks for tuning in. A lot to discuss and digest. Hopefully, we've done some. We haven't covered everything, but, you know, it's impossible to cover everything on these, but we'll be reporting and paying close attention to these things as these things transpire. So, yeah, have a great weekend, everyone.
01:04:41.264 - 01:04:42.384, Speaker A: Enjoy the weekend. See you guys.
