00:00:02.880 - 00:00:26.016, Speaker A: Welcome back, everyone, to another weekly roundup of Empire. Yet again, we're joined by our main man, Garrett, who is the brains behind this operation. Jason is nowhere to be found, which is okay, because, you know, anyways, Garrett is, as I said, he puts these incredibly detailed notes. He has his eye and pulse on the market and all developments in crypto. So, Garrett, welcome back.
00:00:26.150 - 00:00:42.144, Speaker B: Yeah, thank you. Glad to be back on the show. I think I'm hanging up the cleats, at least for a little bit after today, but, yeah, excited to be here. You know, one thing, Sonny, I wanted to tell you, because you always comment on this or you have a few times in the last few shows, I realize I'm not the guy that goes through YouTube comments. I'm not ready for it.
00:00:43.204 - 00:00:59.714, Speaker A: Yeah, no, sometimes when I first read YouTube comments, I was like, okay, well, tough crowd. But then you realize just certain people have a tendency to just post and they skew negative. So anyways, we'll keep doing this, and if you have comments, please post them on YouTube. We are listening and reading them.
00:00:59.794 - 00:01:04.482, Speaker B: Yeah, we want them. Just the first show. Maybe not that time, but I will look at your comments, so please do.
00:01:04.658 - 00:01:30.190, Speaker A: You're doing great, Garak. It comes from me. And if anyone disagrees, then you know you're wrong. And I don't say that often. So, a lot to cover this week. There's been some interesting developments, a lot in NFT land, some rumblings about an FTX stable coin, just the interesting developments in the market. We try to shy away from talking too much about the markets, but interesting to pay attention.
00:01:30.190 - 00:02:04.154, Speaker A: This brief rally that we are seeing across crypto that started yesterday, a lot of liquidations happening on FTX. It was, I think, the number one record day in terms of liquidations. Most of these people had short positions. And then there was this particular entity that accumulated like 500 million of ETH perp in like a matter of a span of an hour or two, which is absolutely crazy. And so we talked about this before. Is crypto going to. Is a leading indicator in terms of risk in the market? And it was definitely interesting.
00:02:04.154 - 00:02:14.530, Speaker A: Obviously hard to extrapolate from one data point. We'll see if this is just another bear market brief rally or sustained. But anyways, a lot to cover. Garrett, you want to kick it off?
00:02:14.682 - 00:02:33.746, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. I think ETH went up about 15% the other day, and it's funny, I'm with some of the analysts in the office, and the energy really comes alive when you see it ripping. So it's been fun, but what I do want to talk on is just the tech stocks. And one I'm interested, Santi, do you mess around with tech stocks like meta snap, et cetera? Do you get involved?
00:02:33.930 - 00:03:06.886, Speaker A: Not individually, as of late. And first, I mean, since forever, I didn't play in the market. It was purely private liquids, and just, that was my game. Now, I'm recently kind of dipped into certain strategies of like going long the S and P and Nasdaq. I'm trying to, like, cover my entry point there. But, you know, obviously a lot of these companies make up big components of the underlying indices. So, yeah, it's been pretty interesting to observe Twitter.
00:03:06.886 - 00:03:34.850, Speaker A: Talk about, hey, you thought, like, you know, your shitcoins down 80, 90%. Well, no different from a lot of the tech stocks out there. Forget it. I mean, the Nasdaq has been getting crushed. A lot of these names have been getting crushed below their IPO levels, like Facebook is now to single digits, or was briefly today. And I mean, obviously, tech earnings season really kicked off this week, I believe. And so a lot of eyes were on that.
00:03:35.022 - 00:04:05.344, Speaker B: Um, and, yeah, Facebook's down 20%, I think, over the last 24 hours. I mean, a 49% decrease in revenue year over year. And I think a lot of that was expected. They still missed their earnings, but, um, it's a pretty big shock. And we talked about Facebook a little bit last week when we were talking about, I think we went to one like their Libra play, and then also touched on VR and oculus. And it's interesting because I, you see a lot of pushback. One, it's like Zuckerberg, you need to cut down your staff, and you also probably need to cut back on this meta, metaverse spin, which a lot of people thought was a little bit too early and just like buying into it.
00:04:05.344 - 00:04:34.740, Speaker B: I was listening to a podcast the other day with Lucky Palmer, who is the creator of Oculus, which was bought by Facebook. I'm not sure which year that was, but it's pretty interesting. He said, really? This is a bet by Facebook saying today when you have Google, Microsoft and Apple, they're in position to win with the mobile and also just the computing platform that we have today. But Facebook wants to make a play there, but they don't really have an entry point. But they're making a bet that you're going to have immersive computing, which is just ar and VR. It's going to take center stage in the future. And that's why they made this bet, knowing it's going to be long term.
00:04:34.740 - 00:05:00.344, Speaker B: And I thought one more interesting point from that is that Lucky said, a lot of people say this was not a successful investment and one, it's long term, right. But he said his payout was based over four years and then to hit certain goals and milestones on sales. And he said instead of four, it only took two. So Facebook actually did better, I should say meta than they even predicted at that time. So anyways, they're taking a big beating. But I'm still really, I'm a fan of Facebook, not with all their decisions, but I think they're pushing this face forward. So I'm excited to watch.
00:05:00.854 - 00:05:25.014, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm not as much of a fan because I stopped using the product. I can't remember last time I. It's absolute garbage. It's worse than Times Square. Like, I'd rather be in Times Square surrounded by all the tourists and like hot dog stands and all the chaos, then open my face. It's like, I don't know what went wrong, but I think it's nonetheless Facebook. I will give credence to and credit, because they've been early in predicting a lot of trends.
00:05:25.014 - 00:05:50.846, Speaker A: We talked about some last episode. They were early in acquiring Instagram. Everyone, mostly everyone, was shitting on them. How can they pay a billion dollars for like a photo filter app? And lo and behold, here we are. In many ways, Instagram is really what's driving a lot of the ad like marketing dollars. And, you know, I will there in many ways been sort of like overcoming this innovative dilemma. Now, it's too early to tell.
00:05:50.846 - 00:06:31.912, Speaker A: I mean, I think a lot of people are very critical, especially in bear markets, right? People lose patience and they're overly critical. And in bull markets, they are very laissez faire. And so again, I think it must be really hard as a company, public company CEO, and I've talked to a number of them, because you're being pulled in a million directions. In many ways, this is like a crypto founder managing discord, right, where the community wants to pun a number of things. To be fair, Ar VR. I mean, it's, it's all an attention economy, and it's increasingly hard to get users attention. TikTok has done a phenomenal job with younger cohorts, Instagram Stories as well.
00:06:31.912 - 00:07:02.074, Speaker A: Just the constant reel of short content keeps you engaged. But it's very hard. I think it's becoming incrementally hard for these companies to stay relevant and capture that attention because people are just jumping everywhere, at least in the western world. It's not like you have a ten cent of app, the WeChat kind of app. Sorry. But, yeah, obviously, they're spending a lot of capital. They're really what seems to be betting the farm on it.
00:07:02.074 - 00:07:05.914, Speaker A: And we'll see. I mean, they definitely have.
00:07:06.974 - 00:07:33.914, Speaker B: Definitely, and you probably saw this from the all time highs. I mean, meta is down 72%, which is quite the hit. It's down before, like, even past where they hit the crash and during COVID and then snaps down 88%, which is even lower. I want to jump to Twitter really quick, and then we'll get on to crypto. But a lot of CT, crypto, crypto, Twitter kind of dominates the space. It's very relevant, and it does look like, at least what I've seen, Elon might be taking over. And I'm curious, do you find that bullish or bearish for Twitter as a company?
00:07:36.974 - 00:08:07.658, Speaker A: I'm cautiously optimistic. I think there's going to be a lot of changes. I think it's, one of our opinion in crypto is different, because to me, Twitter is my lifeblood. It's a place where I spend most of my time on. It's so important from an information standpoint, from a community standpoint, as. And I do kind of ascribe to Elon's Musk's view, which is it is kind of the town square, town hall. And again, so, like, I agree with that.
00:08:07.658 - 00:08:51.044, Speaker A: Do I agree that one, you know, is he gonna have, like, an outside influence on information and all that? I don't know. I mean, a lot of people are critical of, like, when Jeff Bezos bought, like, the Washington Post Post, and, like, a lot of these, like, you know, tech moguls or just moguls in general trying to, like, buy their way into and control the narrative. I kind of don't believe that as much. I think it's just, that's coming from a bit of a skeptical camp. But, look, there's immediate changes. I saw a great video of him walking into Twitter's headquarters yesterday or the day before with, like, a sink in. He's been very vocal around the working from home and cutting staff, and I have a lot of folks and friends over the years that have worked and gone through Twitter at some point.
00:08:51.044 - 00:09:28.524, Speaker A: And I think it's a well known fact in the valley that it's a pretty bloated organization. And so, look, I'm just really excited. For a while, it's felt like Twitter has been underappreciated. The potential it has to really kind of be more relevant for other cohorts other than crypto. Like, if you can establish the level of attention and retention and engagement that you see in crypto Twitter for other pockets, like, that's, I think the potential of Twitter being worth way more than the current value paid, 44 billion or so. And hopefully you get some of the changes we've been advocating for, like, really addressing the bot problem. It's become.
00:09:28.524 - 00:09:52.864, Speaker A: It's become very bad as of late. It's funny because I didn't really see it happening in the last, like, six months ago. And all of a sudden, I think what it kind of coincided when Elon was, like, during the acquisition that he brought attention to this, and then all of a sudden, I think someone was just like, bots became a thing, like, very, very visible, 100%. So, yeah. What are your thoughts on that?
00:09:53.024 - 00:10:22.342, Speaker B: Um, I mean, I think it's interesting, at least. I mean, I think the more entertainment we have in society, the better, obviously, if it comes out to be good for everyone at the end of the day. But I gotta say it's entertaining. I, you know, I think Elon at one point said he was gonna cut 75% of jobs, which I think he's always gonna exaggerate things and then pull it back. Right? Like, you kind of set the anchor, bring it back, stir up some dust, and see what happens. And I saw this tweet that I personally thought was funny, but it says, elon tells Twitter employees they can work from home, just not for Twitter. And that is something that Elon would say.
00:10:22.342 - 00:10:39.718, Speaker B: And he just makes a lot of news. And, I mean, look, I like work from home. I see the benefits being the office. But anyways, I just think it's fascinating. I think that Elon is a media company himself, and got on your comment of monetizing Twitter and what they can do better as a company. I also heard this person talking about how people build businesses on YouTube. You don't see that so much on Twitter.
00:10:39.718 - 00:10:57.982, Speaker B: And maybe part of that is that it's not as visual based. So maybe it's harder to grow an audience. And some of the biggest accounts are, like, 500,000, but it is a spot where you could see people maybe dedicate, like, their life to building a business on Twitter, which you see to some degree, but even to greater from there. And I thought that was pretty interesting. So, anyways, we don't need to talk about tech stocks anymore.
00:10:58.038 - 00:12:04.228, Speaker A: But the last thing I'll say is it's somewhat relevant, because I think crypto is kind of, it's the town square for crypto. Right. He put out a very interesting post today, Elon did, addressing kind of marketers and how he wanted to approach Twitter and how they manage kind of marketing and, like, brands advertise, like, advertisement in general. And it wasn't to say that, like, all ads are going to be gone, but it said, look, ads can be relevant, but we need to be careful, like, more mindful. The criteria needs to be higher of, you know, the kind of ads that are being served. And, you know, it's, in many ways, it's kind of refreshing to see that because I think, like, historically, I, I don't agree with everything that Elon has done or said, particularly around his comments, around, like, doge and just, like, felt to me that it was just, I don't know, it was, he has a, he carries so much weight, and it's important to, like, if you carry that amount of weight, to be really mindful of what you say and, but to be fair, I do think that he's someone who has pushed humanity forward in a very meaningful way across a number of companies. And he's, he's not afraid to make bold bets.
00:12:04.228 - 00:13:09.458, Speaker A: And in this case, it would be really interesting to see how he manages a social network because he's the richest guy in the world, and he could tell, he could, for all intents and purposes, do this as a social experiment and do things differently than other companies that have the pressure of earnings next quarter and really trying to maximize profit. A lot of times I think you have to compromise near term profitability for long term payout. And that goes back to exactly what you were talking about of Facebook and their bet on the metaverse and, and VR. And so it really takes that kind of, like, leadership that you see probably in Zuckerberg and Musk and a few other personalities to just, you know, do what they want and tell everyone else to, well, all due respect, the fuck off. And, you know, sometimes it works out, other times it doesn't. But I think the biggest innovations have come out when, when that happens. And so I'm excited to see whatever the outcome of that is.
00:13:09.606 - 00:13:27.170, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, definitely. And I probably shouldn't talk about my personal life on here, but real story, I did have a date last night. Believe it or not, I'm single. And I bring about talking about dogecoin. I somehow, crypto came up. She asked what I do, and it always takes a second. I try to say I work in media, work in finance and entrepreneurialism, and then eventually I get to work around.
00:13:27.242 - 00:13:34.666, Speaker A: Answer and be like, no, I work in crypto. Did she immediately leave or did she, like, tap you on the. Tap you on the show? And she's like, are you doing okay, Gary?
00:13:34.770 - 00:13:53.194, Speaker B: That's what I thought was going to happen. But no, she actually was like, you know what? I think crypto is going to be here to stay. This is very, very smart girl, works at Google. And her first point was, I think the Elon and Twitter thing and doge, and Elon being with doge, I think, has a chance to really stay around. I'm like, please don't associate with me with Doge. But I was like, it is fine.
00:13:53.814 - 00:13:59.654, Speaker A: That's wife material right there. That's wife material. Are you going on another date with her?
00:13:59.814 - 00:14:03.434, Speaker B: You know what, I did text her this morning and haven't heard back, so I will keep going.
00:14:05.774 - 00:14:09.742, Speaker A: I guess you were the 24 hours rule. Or, you know what? What are we supposed to wait?
00:14:09.838 - 00:14:12.406, Speaker B: I don't know what the role is, Santi. I just tried to go for it.
00:14:12.430 - 00:14:14.274, Speaker A: But, I mean, you're talking to the wrong person.
00:14:15.054 - 00:14:42.330, Speaker B: Okay. Apple nfts. Apple nFTs done with Garrett stating life. So we actually talked about this on the podcast. About a month ago, Apple officially announced that NFTs can be sold through the apps or list in their App Store. I think they were already doing this, but they just made an official announcement they're going to be subject to the same in app purchase fee, which is 30% if the app or the developer is making more than a million, and it's 50% if you're making less than million. But essentially, for somebody like OpenSea, if you have an app, you're going to get charged 30% on all of your sales, which essentially is just going to come out of the seller's pocket.
00:14:42.330 - 00:15:07.666, Speaker B: So they're going to make less money. But then I think it was this last week, they updated their roles again, essentially saying that another role that they have in nfts is that these nfts cannot be used to unlock new or like featured content or like, level up. And essentially it's like, hey, you have an NFT. If you buy it, then you can level up and unlock a better part of this app. They're trying to say like, no, if you want to do that, you need to make another sell so they can get their 30%. Um, this is. There's a lot of controversy here.
00:15:07.666 - 00:15:29.106, Speaker B: You see it on both sides. I think part of it is, look, at least nfts are going to be on the App Store because it is probably the best way to get an NFT into somebody's hands? Um, we're all, we're on mobile apps, right? The 30% fee is, is pretty steep. I mean, this happens to SaaS startups all the time. It's interesting. With Kindle, for example, you probably, I have a Kindle app that I use all the time. If you go to the Kindle app and try to find a book and you want to buy it, you can't actually buy it. Exactly.
00:15:29.106 - 00:15:47.398, Speaker B: And you can't even have links to where you can go buy it. And that is the same with nfts. So it's not like a game because this is really probably going to hurt some of the game developers. I mean, it does allow them to sell nfts there, but they can't even put, like, click this button, go to my website, and you can buy the NFT. Like, that's completely illegal. So kind of interesting. One more point that maybe isn't, but it did confuse me.
00:15:47.398 - 00:16:12.824, Speaker B: I'm like, okay, so if this is the case, Coinbase has an app, but, like, you don't see 30% fees on their transactions. They came out with a clarification saying, if we approve you as an exchange for crypto transfers, you do not get charged that fee. But NFTs in this case are not considered for that. So I'm just curious, what do you think about this? Do you find it? I mean, one, do you think this 30% fee crypto is maybe the best way to get that down? I mean, that's a big question. But two, I'm just curious what you think about this in general.
00:16:14.604 - 00:17:31.924, Speaker A: Well, before we get there, I'm curious if, you know, if you want to buy an NFT, like, what does it actually mean to unlock? Well, one, like, who's setting up the wallet? Like, so if you're natively gonna buy an NFT through the App Store, Apple Store, or the app within your phone, like, I guess, like, how's that flow gonna work? So that, like, say you open the opensea app in your phone or whatever FTX or whatever app you're using, metamask, and you're buying an NFT, then, like, if it's like, will that be possible? Then they just charge 30% on whatever happens on mobile? Or are they going to actually help you set up a wallet and create the wallet for you and use face id to, like, you know, retrieve your wallet? Like, social recovery. Like, are they actually going to. The reason I'm asking is I would be really curious to understand if they're going to really venture into the wallet game because you remember the time when, like, Solana was announcing that the Solana phone, a lot of it was because of the pains that you're seeing now and trying to, like, you know, a lot of the ring fencing that happens with Apple and some of these platforms, like, not making it easy for developers.
00:17:32.084 - 00:17:38.788, Speaker B: Yeah. And it totally tweeted. He was like, this is just a Solana mobile ad campaign. Thanks for promoting. So, yeah, there we go.
00:17:38.836 - 00:18:01.468, Speaker A: Yeah. But I'd be really curious, like, look, if Apple is going to venture into the wallet game, I mean, there have been, I think it's fairly positive for the space to bring on, you know, the next, you know, couple million users almost immediately. Right. It's positive because it legitimizes the category. As soon as you're talking about something and you're allowing it, then it's. It's very positive. Right.
00:18:01.468 - 00:18:33.406, Speaker A: If they weren't even acknowledging it, then, like, they're just clamping down on it, then you probably would have wondered, what are they, what do they know about the regulatory side of things around NFTs that we don't? But the fact that they're entertaining this, I think, is, I read it as, read between tea leaves. It's fairly positive. NFTs is a category. It's a huge moneymaker. I mean, Opensea has printed a ton of fees on volume. And so, yeah, it's 30% is just, it's sort of like, it's very high.
00:18:33.470 - 00:18:34.254, Speaker B: Kind of stealing.
00:18:34.334 - 00:18:43.004, Speaker A: It's very high. And so anyways, the core ethos of crypto is like trying to remove the middleman. And in many ways, we are here yet again.
00:18:43.344 - 00:19:03.520, Speaker B: But, well, you know what? Maybe Facebook's VR, their field will play out and then we'll have a little bit more competition in this space because right now you have Android, but their App Store, and they just have adopted all these same rules. So you have two competitors going back and forth. And, like, I would have to think over time, those fees go down. Just like we think in crypto, when you have these liquidity protocols like Uniswap, et cetera, like, those fees might go to zero, but you're going to have other ways to monetize.
00:19:03.592 - 00:19:40.812, Speaker A: So I think that's the hope generally. Like, yeah, we can complain about 30% and, yeah, Apple's very difficult. Maybe they're going to get into antitrust issues because they are just really making it very hard from a competitive standpoint for a lot of these businesses. And 30% seems very high. But, you know, I do think that it's very positive because now you have at least a way to sell nfts. This is important for games, it's important for NFT artists and creators and curators. And it is just crypto is becoming, you know, more seamless to use and interact and enter this world.
00:19:40.812 - 00:20:27.042, Speaker A: And that's positive. As soon as we remove friction, it's positive. So many people haven't really even tried or ventured into the space. And sure, not your keys, not your money, not your nfts, I get it, folks. But it's still very, very positive for the vast majority of users that have no interest or capability or sophistication to manage their own keys. If you have apple officer and create a wallet for you and secure that for you, then most likely it's for a lot of users out there, especially the ones that haven't even ventured into crypto, that's still positive because they get to experience the benefits of this technology, of this, of gaming and everything. And sure, you're relying on a custodian in many ways to manage your keys or social recovery system.
00:20:27.042 - 00:20:56.424, Speaker A: So it's like being your own custodian and managing your own keys. I think we can all agree that it's fairly unrealistic, given the current solutions out there, that it's going to be suitable for mainstream adoption. We're going to need better solutions like Argent Wallet, which has social recovery systems and all that natively secured keys, and the secure enclave with your phone or whatever, I'm not sophisticated enough. That to me, feels like a win.
00:20:56.584 - 00:21:32.690, Speaker B: Yeah, 100%. I use Arjun myself and like you said, I don't know the actual tech details enough to say this is as secure as something else. But I do love the experience and like social recovery. For anybody that doesn't know, it's like instead of having to write down your private key or some phrase you can actually assign, say three different friends, or maybe you have three different hardware devices or another metamask, et cetera, and it's just a way to get like two out of three or three out of four. And if you get those parties to approve your transaction, you can recover your wallet, set limits on like, let's say you have a limit. You say, I don't want to spend more than $10,000 a day, or 1500, whatever it might be, unless I get permission from three out of four friends, which is pretty important.
00:21:32.842 - 00:21:44.050, Speaker A: Here's a hack. If you're a game, then you most definitely want to go acquire users on mobile, but keep most of the activity to browser desktops, right?
00:21:44.242 - 00:21:44.610, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:21:44.642 - 00:21:57.710, Speaker A: Which I think is where a lot of the games that I'm an investor, this is the flow that they're envisioning. But mobile serves as a good customer acquisition. Now, if you take, what's the name of the guy who did the, like, free to own concept?
00:21:57.742 - 00:21:59.190, Speaker B: Gabriel Laden. Yeah.
00:21:59.302 - 00:22:06.222, Speaker A: Or Gabriel, take, borrow elements from that. And so, okay, you want to charge us 30%? Fine. Give the user a free NFT.
00:22:06.358 - 00:22:06.998, Speaker B: Yep.
00:22:07.126 - 00:22:41.582, Speaker A: As a hook and then have him claim it using and navigating and using his browser. Right. And so 30% on zero is zero, folks. So anyways, there's a workaround around this, which is use nfts as customer acquisition. Anytime you get a free thing, souvenir or whatever, it like, it, it lights up your brain, your heart, or whatever, and then it makes you incentivize. It incentivizes you to go check out whatever the game is or whatever the thing you know is. And so if you're a game, give a free NFT to drop it to the user.
00:22:41.582 - 00:23:09.750, Speaker A: He claims it on mobile, and then he goes to the browser to, you know, this is in the same way. Right. Does, is this a Kindle flow, too, where you can buy a sample? You can, right. You can, you can click on your mobile to get a sample of the book or the audiobook. You can't buy it. You have to go, and there's no link, but you have to then go to the browser and, you know, buy the actual thing. That is, you just listen to the sample.
00:23:09.750 - 00:23:17.118, Speaker A: No different folks. Get a sample, nft, a teaser, and then go on browser and then do everything that you want to do is not the flow.
00:23:17.246 - 00:23:32.006, Speaker B: That's the flow. That's the flow. 100%, yeah. It's all about reducing friction and talking about reducing friction. I want to just touch on the Reddit NFT kind of phenomenon that we've had this week. I think it was back in this July, Reddit announced a collection of nfts that they were going to launch. I think it was around 86,000.
00:23:32.006 - 00:23:48.952, Speaker B: That's like an avatar collection, which they don't actually call nfts. It's digital collectibles, which I have nothing wrong with. Nifty could work. NFT. No non fungible token? No, just like that. That's never going to work in the mainstream. So anyways, they minted these on Polygon Pos, which is cool.
00:23:48.952 - 00:24:12.756, Speaker B: It's an EVM chain. They did not try to create their own or have something centralized. And then last week they actually revealed that they have onboarded over what they say is 3 million wallets and minted over 86,000 nfts. Now, do you want to caveat? 3 million wallets. Amazing. It's probably a little bit misleading. I think it's actually like, so what happens is I think when you have this flow, it pops up on your Reddit and you click on it and you're like, claim my avatar, NFT.
00:24:12.756 - 00:24:40.854, Speaker B: And if you do that, it mints you a wallet. But you actually have no idea that you actually have a wallet unless you want to interact with the wallet, which they allow you to, which is really cool. And I think they have a couple of thousand of those. But this Sunday, there was a lot of buzz around that after this announcement and daily volume on trading, these surged from below 1 million to 2 million overnight. This was a huge spike in the chart in just 24 hours. And this was one, a huge spike for Polygon. It got nfts on Reddit to have over $100 million market cap, which is to me, absurd.
00:24:40.854 - 00:24:49.958, Speaker B: I mean, one, we're in a bear market. Two, this is just a company that's experimenting with NFTs and their founder, I don't know his name, but I know he's been embracing web3, I think this is really interesting.
00:24:50.086 - 00:24:50.878, Speaker A: Ohanian.
00:24:51.006 - 00:25:02.046, Speaker B: That's right. Yeah. And this is kind of like Starbucks is now trying to get into the NFT game. They're not calling it nfts either. But this is two big companies. Actually, I have a few stats at the top. Reddit is the fifth most visited website in the US.
00:25:02.046 - 00:25:20.514, Speaker B: It's more popular than Instagram, Twitter, and even the hub actually don't know what that is, has 430 million monthly active users and more than 1.5 billion registered users. I had no idea. I always, when I need an answer to the question, especially around crypto, I type it in, then I put red at the end. And I've learned to be a big Reddit user, but I had no idea it was that big. So this is really cool.
00:25:21.014 - 00:25:52.160, Speaker A: Is especially a platform that's like, from a discovery standpoint. I mean, that's where I discovered bitcoin back in 2012. Wow, they are bitcoin channel. That's where a lot of the conversation was happening. And so, yeah, like we touched on this on the episode with Stephen and Raul from Arbitrum comes out Monday. Yeah, folks should tune into that. And because they, we talked about the Reddit social point system and how that really folds into their strategy and why they need it.
00:25:52.160 - 00:26:59.024, Speaker A: It's not that they need it, it's just supplemental. It's enhancing. And now that people have, like, it helps engagement. If you want to claim, you can claim, you don't have to claim. And so it's, I think that view, and the key takeaway from the comment that these guys were saying was Reddit really has embraced nfts and a strategy in Web three because it is complementary, it is enhancing what they're doing in a way that can improve a lot of the core metrics and particularly engagement in the platform. And then invite, once you have, like, these nfTs, then, you know, a Reddit user that has a lot of reputation and a lot of credibility and social score or whatever, then other brands can come in and invite those users to then say, oh, wow, Garrett, we see that you're like posting a ton on the health biohacking channel. Well, you know, we can validate that with your points and your badges and all your avatar that is changing based on your activity.
00:26:59.024 - 00:28:02.530, Speaker A: Then we're gonna invite you to, like, a retreat and we're gonna send you a care package from, I don't know, you're like some sort of new protein bar company. Well, like, you know what I mean? Like, yeah, you start seeing the benefits of that. So, yeah, it's gonna be really interesting. I think we, it is going to show us a way of how a big company in web two can embrace certain web3 elements, maybe reinvent itself, maybe Twitter is also going in this direction now that Elon's at the helm. But two really interesting companies that I'm probably following, three, actually, Facebook with the Metaverse, Reddit and Twitter, they're all moving in different ways and different strategies. But, yeah, this is huge. I think the last thing I'll say on this is it's pretty interesting, the rebranding digital collectibles and also the, I was just on the phone with this portfolio company of mine and we were talking about the potential to do stuff in the NFT space.
00:28:02.530 - 00:28:45.274, Speaker A: And I said, well, why just stop with a profile picture like PFP? If you're a particular app and it attracts certain enthusiasts, why not just build out the rest of the avatar, right? Not just the face, but, like, you know, the clothes and, you know, all the different gear and all this stuff, and you don't have to, like, sell it all. It could be based on certain earned stuff in the way of, like, not bought stuff, which I think is really powerful. I think if users can have a very clear way of earning things based on certain activity that is, like, non monetary. It really incentivizes people. It gamma fies it in a very interesting way. So I think we're going to start seeing a lot of other brands, like Reddit, really embrace that strategy.
00:28:45.604 - 00:29:08.956, Speaker B: Yeah, me too. I definitely agree with that. It reminded me, I think it was Sergei from Google, and you talked about gamification and getting access over time and not that you have to pay for it. And, yeah, I think it was Sergey. He said, if I wasn't working at Google, what would I want to do that could help society? And one of it was help people get fit and stay in shape and be healthy. And part of that, he's like, I would start a gym and gamify it. Where when you basically come in, I don't know how this would work, but they essentially give you some clothes.
00:29:08.956 - 00:29:29.332, Speaker B: Whatever it is, it doesn't look that great. You only have access to a part of the gym. And then essentially, as you come in, they quickly iterate you up where you get, like, cooler gear, you get access to bigger parts of the gym, you get, like, protein shakes for free. And the whole point is, like, people want things to be gamified, and they do. A lot of people actually would rather, like, work for something because you feel like you earned it instead of just right. So I think that's huge with nfts.
00:29:29.468 - 00:29:30.476, Speaker A: Sweat equity, you know?
00:29:30.500 - 00:29:31.344, Speaker B: Sweat equity.
00:29:31.844 - 00:30:13.454, Speaker A: Absolutely. I mean, that's, that's the bigger picture here. I'm not asking you to believe in bitcoin. Fine. I'm not asking you to believe in Ethereum or Solana or anything like remove all of that, all the project names. And fundamentally from kind of like a mechanism standpoint, evaluate that there are systems that are being created that are better for a coordination standpoint that have proven to, the most challenging thing is to coordinate a certain activity, especially when you don't have a top down authority. Reaching social consensus and coordinating that in a decentralized way, like, is extremely powerful.
00:30:13.454 - 00:30:46.114, Speaker A: It is one of the more important developments of our generation because that unlocks so much potential to then do other really cool stuff. And of course, bitcoins try to do this for coordination of a consensus, to then agree on a certain state. And then that has sound properties of. Of a hard asset because it has a finite supply. We're applying that to money. Ethereum is abstracting that and saying, and saying, we're applying that to just general consensus. And that can take on many different meanings.
00:30:46.114 - 00:31:23.694, Speaker A: Nfts, social, gaming, whatever, defi. But even beyond that, there have been like, ten years of this experiment that has proven to be fairly successful. What else can we apply it to? System that relies on programmed incentives to reach coordination and consensus in a more fluid way, without. Without, like, trusting anyone. And I'll say that again, like, what else can you apply that to? Well, I don't know. Maybe you can incentivize people to lead a better life. Well, how do you do that? We talk about education, and it's just like I was in model Un.
00:31:23.694 - 00:31:53.984, Speaker A: It's so tiring. People say, we need to have a better educational system. Well, yeah, no shit, Sherlock. Well, how do you go about doing that? Well, we should tax people more. No, the solution to that is always kind of, I think, a private enterprise, because markets are more efficient than any top down, centralized organization. Just look at what's happening in San Francisco. The management of public funds is a disgrace, not only in the US, pretty much everywhere, except, like, some scandinavian countries and small countries like the Singapore.
00:31:53.984 - 00:32:05.032, Speaker A: But scaling that is proven to be very difficult for modern day nation states. It is very hard, like the US. New York is very different than Arkansas or Mississippi.
00:32:05.048 - 00:32:06.312, Speaker B: It's a tiny bit different. I agree.
00:32:06.408 - 00:33:37.320, Speaker A: You know what I mean? Coordinating that and reaching a consensus that appeases is very difficult. I'm not bashing on democracy, it's just really hard. But as soon as you have these, and again, this is what these systems can really be applied towards, you could create a system that has very predictable set of program rules that no one can change easily, and that gives you the certainty, the trust, the confidence to operate in that system that has rule of law governed by code, enforced by social consensus, that could be modified, as we've seen with Ethereum, with the merge, and upgrading, which is a huge development, purely because you can prove that such a distributed and decentralized system can morph and adapt, which is so powerful, and then take all of that as a case study and then say, okay, well, let's actually reinvent healthcare. And we had a great episode on vibe. Dow a log who's talking about trying to do this for clinical trials and research, which is another neglected area that has been historically, you know, governed by pharma and drug development, is very difficult. And there's so many incentives that are out of whack, because it's better to invest in another dick pill than it is to invest in research for a rare disease, even though you get some incentives from the FDA and health organizations to go after emergency status and priority status for rare diseases. But the money is in dick pills, and people will.
00:33:37.320 - 00:34:04.378, Speaker A: As long as the money is there, most people continue to invest in the next dick pill, which is a marginal improvement. And so anyways, what I'm, this doing whole ramble, and I'm, I get pretty excited because I love it. That's what I tell people now. It's like, I'm not asking you to believe in, like, bitcoin replacing the dollar, probably. Dollar is going to continue to be the dollar for as long as we're probably alive. But. But this is what led me to invest in stepn, for instance, because I talked to those guys and I said, God, yes.
00:34:04.378 - 00:34:50.362, Speaker A: The first time I learned about crypto, I was looking at, I'm a runner and a cyclist. And so I was, I used Strava a lot. I'm like, well, I mean, why can't you just give me like some sort of, like, I have all these points, I have all this activity. It felt to me like they're, they are leaving a lot of value on the table. So anyways, I think a lot of the world's problems can truly, and I say this meaningfully, not like pie in the sky stuff, like, will be the way we operate, the way we interact, the way we change our habits is going to meaningfully, radically change that. We will interact with insurance and the healthcare system and education is going to meaningfully change because now we have systems that will make it easier for us and incentivize us to just do the right thing, the better thing. I think everyone wants this improve.
00:34:50.362 - 00:35:00.574, Speaker A: It's just difficult. Sometimes you need a little nudge here and there. Quote Richard Thaler, nudge, great book. I always do a book recommendation. This is, and I'm doing it early, nudge by Richard Thaler. One of my favorite books of all time.
00:35:01.354 - 00:35:19.482, Speaker B: It is. I've read that book, too, book as well. It's amazing. And that wasn't a rant, son, to you. That was really, really good. And I think a big part of this is education. That's one reason that we have this show and there are other podcasts out there, because you have to look beyond crypto as just speculation or just meme coins, et cetera, and really get people to think about it in the way you just talked about.
00:35:19.482 - 00:35:33.694, Speaker B: And I actually haven't read the piece yet, except probably the first three pages, but Matt Levine from Bloomberg came out, I think it was this week, with a maybe 60,000 word essay about crypto. And it's like a manifesto. Yeah, it's huge. Have you seen that?
00:35:34.274 - 00:35:38.728, Speaker A: I got a few of the groups that I'm about to center around this book.
00:35:38.826 - 00:35:54.332, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, it's really cool because Matt Levine is a great, he's from tradfi, essentially. I think he was an FX trader back in the day. He's one of the most well known writers in the tradfi space at Bloomberg. And he usually just has an article or a newsletter that comes out every day. And he does talk about crypto. And I think he's actually kind of a fan.
00:35:54.332 - 00:36:15.346, Speaker B: But he's also pretty skeptical at the same time. But he's been on podcasts with SPF, et cetera. Anyways, just the beginning that I read from it. It's really, really well thought out and I think it would connect with people really well. And it's a huge educational piece that is on Bloomberg, which is ginormous. When you go back to the last bear market in 20, 1819, going into 20, nothing was talked about. You didn't see anything about crypto on the news.
00:36:15.346 - 00:36:37.064, Speaker B: If it was, it was just like, the industry's dead, and I don't know where this industry is going to end up. But it is so different this time when you see firms like Reddit and Starbucks and all these announcements, and then you also see just all these developments in the space that are happening. Anyways, I think it's really exciting, and it's completely different than it was two years ago. Again, I don't know where it's going to go or how long a bear market's going to last, but I think people are getting more educated on the space, and that's a really big deal.
00:36:37.724 - 00:36:47.664, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. And should we, what else is there to talk about? I guess we have the FTX, stablecoin. We have a few other developments.
00:36:48.164 - 00:37:11.624, Speaker B: We can go quick through this. I don't think there's a time we have to touch on, but we'll just do it. We'll do it for the audience. FTX, SBF announced, we didn't officially announce, but supposedly he was in the interview that FTX is working on stablecoin, and he hinted that announcement will come out soon. There's already a lot of exchanges that do this. Coinbase with USDC, with circle, you have finance, BUSD, Gemini GUSD. One comment, GUSD had 8.5%
00:37:11.624 - 00:37:33.814, Speaker B: yield. If you just staked your Gemini GUSD, which made no sense, and now it's 5.9%. So I'm really curious how these firms are like, subsidizing their stable coins. But yeah, one thing is like, SBF has made a ton of moves during this bear market. They acquired Blockfi, which I don't know the price, up to 240 million. But who knows? It's based on a payout system. Sam has now 7.6%
00:37:33.814 - 00:37:58.106, Speaker B: of Robinhood, even though FTX is supposedly not interested in actually trying to acquire Robinhood, even if they could. But, yeah, I'm curious. The stable coin market is just kind of crazy. And what I'm curious to you, you see this proliferation of stable coins, and what do you think the future state is? And we don't have to drill on this for long, but I had a friend ask me yesterday, he's like, if we have a stable coin, it's guaranteed to be fed coin. And I'm just curious, from what you know and what you think, was this.
00:37:58.130 - 00:37:59.890, Speaker A: Your date or was this not my date?
00:37:59.962 - 00:38:00.578, Speaker B: We didn't get that.
00:38:00.586 - 00:38:06.018, Speaker A: I was gonna say that that was a fairly deep date. If you like, talk about that's date number two.
00:38:06.146 - 00:38:25.690, Speaker B: That's date number two, but will be fed coins. Or do you see something like aggregating at a bank level where you have something more like USDC, that because, you know, today, like, money is essentially printed, aka printed, not really printed in quotes, printed at banks. And do you see that being the future? If a, like, stablecoin is adopted, where do you see this going? The market?
00:38:25.762 - 00:38:54.064, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't really have a precise answer here. I mean, there's a great. There's a good interview by recently, I think it was this week that came out Augustine Cartes, which is at the IMF, I think, talking about central bank digital currencies. And he was like, wow, these are great. Because we can now program how people can spend the money or not spend the money. And of course, you can see a good way and a benefit of that with universal basic income. And then you also see a bad way, like in China's social credit scoring system.
00:38:54.064 - 00:38:56.272, Speaker A: Scoring system, like black mirror.
00:38:56.408 - 00:38:56.720, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:38:56.752 - 00:39:08.528, Speaker A: If you're like, all of a sudden, piss off the state. And you're like, okay, well, you can't shop in any supermarket. Good luck getting food. Like, no, no. I mean, it sounds. Yeah, it's real. It's real.
00:39:08.528 - 00:39:37.104, Speaker A: Right. And so I hope, I think, look back to my prior rant, I believe very much on private enterprise and that being more efficient. If you're like the, like, I guess if. Does it really matter? Because, like, okay, you can have a fedcoin, a central bank digital currency, but at the end of the day, if you're a USDC, fully backed, collateralized stablecoin 101. So there's like a dollar there that like represents it. It's just a digital receipt. Then that's.
00:39:37.104 - 00:40:05.058, Speaker A: You can still do monetary policy no problem, right? I mean it's, it's, it's like, it's just like whatever. It's just like a digital receipt that's in circulation right at the end of the day that dollar exists. And so a central bank or the Fed would still like it because it increases the demand for dollars. Imagine today, now you see inflation and all these. The FX market is in whack this year. You look at the yen at an all time low. It's at 100, 5160.
00:40:05.058 - 00:40:49.984, Speaker A: You look at the pound recently, it went all the way to 107, historical level low. You look at the euro, went all the way to year lows for some of these currencies. If you're a company or you're a normal consumer, you have liabilities and dollar denominated debt or whatever, or you just want to store your wealth. Stable coins are like us denominated stable coins, which is by the way, the most pervasive one, is a fantastic vehicle and instrument. It's great you want to hold dollars. Now, none of this financial advice or any advice for that matter, but you know, you feel pretty comfortable still holding a dollar. Like now all of a sudden with stable coins, whether it's a USDC or fed coin, like, you know, it makes it all of a sudden like very easy for people.
00:40:49.984 - 00:41:17.034, Speaker A: Now I think that like the Fed coin is probably going to be used more for like the internal domestic economy. Like if you're, if you're getting like, you know, during COVID you got a relief check, well maybe you're going to get that. Not in USDC, but you're going to get a fed coin, right? You're going to pay your taxes. Maybe you're going to pay through the fed coin or whatever, like tax withholding, all these things domestic, like domestic. It's probably going to be a fed coin international and for a lot of other things, USDC.
00:41:17.734 - 00:41:43.810, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, I agree with that for the most part. It's going to be really interesting. I think you're seeing like protocol specific stable coins popping up too between, like you have Aave, you have fracs. I think there's other, there's plenty others working on as well. And it's, it's hard for me to see that working long term because it just is a terrible ux for any user unless a wallet can, can completely abstract that which we know going forward. Just like Reddit's doing. It's abstracting the NFT wallet like creation process completely, but that's something that works and it's going to be brought there.
00:41:43.810 - 00:42:01.258, Speaker B: But that's, I think it's probably going to aggregate around a few. And I do think you want choice. We talked about this last week. I think the biggest thing crypto is switching costs and just having the choice if you want to opt out of something, which we talked about Twitter a little bit ago, too, and I said you could build a business there, like a multi hundred million dollar business, but you could get rugged off the platform.
00:42:01.306 - 00:42:01.490, Speaker A: Right.
00:42:01.522 - 00:42:04.358, Speaker B: And that's something where crypto can come in and actually try to help solve that.
00:42:04.466 - 00:43:16.162, Speaker A: Yeah, well, it's this idea of legal tender. Like, I think, like USCC might be deemed a legal tender if it's like approved within a approved list of stable coins. But if you have a, like, not a dollar denominator or like fully backed coin, then you may not be a legal tender. And so at the end of the day, I always think stable coins, and I've dabbled in a lot of these for better or for worse, including, you know, the early days of like base coin basis, which got shut down and then all the other ESD dsds of the world, that was an investment fracs early and obviously Noavi quite well. And so, look, at the end of the day, I didn't touch terra, but I will say, look, I think my conclusion, early conclusion in stablecoins is that usability drives stability. Again, usability will drive stability. And I think we're long past this idea that, like incentives and some sort of financial engineering can work your way through building confidence in a system without getting meaningful usage other than financial speculation and yield farm leverage, recursive yield farming, like.
00:43:16.162 - 00:43:46.118, Speaker A: And so again, if you're within an approved list of stable coins and it's a legal tender, what does that mean? Well, you're going to be able to pay for your flight, you're going to be able to pay for your pizza. You're going to be able to do everything that you do today with your Apple Pay or your credit cards and debit. Debit cards, I should say with USDC. Right. And you kind of already see that, right? You have like the FTX cards coming out. You have, you know, a few other cards out there that Coinbase does. Coinbase have a card, don't you?
00:43:46.166 - 00:43:48.406, Speaker B: Coinbase has a card promoting it.
00:43:48.430 - 00:43:49.622, Speaker A: For a long time they've been promoting it.
00:43:49.638 - 00:43:49.766, Speaker B: Right.
00:43:49.790 - 00:44:11.366, Speaker A: And so at the end of the day, like, if you have, if your card issuer and the network of banks supports USDC, then that drives usability and that inherently builds stability and adoption for a stable coin. And so I do agree with your point. It's going to be a fairly concentrated, maybe two or three coins out there that take the lion share of the market. And you already see that anyways today, right?
00:44:11.510 - 00:44:11.910, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:44:11.982 - 00:44:17.958, Speaker A: Tether USDC and like. Yeah, busd to some extent. And then what's the other?
00:44:18.006 - 00:44:43.764, Speaker B: Paxos is Paxos might be up there somewhere as well. Yeah. When I talk to people, when they ask about, you know, a use case in crypto and there's, there's quite a few, but I think a lot of them are hard to make tangible for people. And it is, it's a, you know, it's a new field and there's a lot of innovation. But when I always go to is stable coins and like a very quick story is I was living in Australia for a while. I went over there and $1 or one australian dollar was $0.80 in the states and by the time I left, one australian dollar was $0.60.
00:44:43.764 - 00:45:03.036, Speaker B: Yeah, so I. Sorry, I said that backwards, but essentially it went from 0.8 to 0.6 against me. So I lost that huge spread on my income that I made that was in an australian bank. And I wasn't trying to take on like the risk of FX, risk of australian currency, and I did. But if I would have had USCC, there's no way.
00:45:03.036 - 00:45:21.408, Speaker B: I just wouldn't have put some of that into like my coinbase account. And then when I left the country to come to the United States, I needed to empty that bank account and get the US. Well, what happens is you get quoted and an exchange rate, you got absolutely wrecked. Ran over. Ran over because you look it up on Google and it says one thing. Yeah. And then they charge, they charged me, I think, $25.
00:45:21.408 - 00:45:34.728, Speaker B: And then on top of that, look, I get this is some regulation that probably will enter crypto for five days. My money was out of my australian bank account, not my us bank account, and no idea where it went. So it's just a bad user experience and I could have done that within 13 seconds on Ethereum.
00:45:34.776 - 00:46:05.556, Speaker A: So it is a way more competitive quote. Yeah, look, I think the simulate curve is amazing. Being able to trade like for like stable coins and like being able to trade against FX, the FX market just pisses me the fuck off. I'm sorry, but every time I go to a country and they're asking me to you always, you always forget, right? You always at the airport and be like, oh, shit, I should probably get some currency for the taxi or whatever. And that's when they get you. They always get you. And you're like, to me, I kid you not, this is.
00:46:05.556 - 00:46:29.606, Speaker A: I was thinking about building a better remittance system where you can send money cross border using SMS and, like, ATM's. Local ATM network. And then I discover bitcoin. I'm like, this is what I need. This is it, right? But to this day, every time I travel, I always, every time I pass by the FX, currency converter stalls. Look at that. It's cringe.
00:46:29.606 - 00:46:47.120, Speaker A: And I remind myself, I'm like, you will go away in five years or ten years. But that would be a success for this industry. All those operators would go away. To me, that would be amazing because they, they charge you an arm and a leg and it's such a, it's such a ripoff.
00:46:47.192 - 00:46:58.864, Speaker B: And, and there's no competition. Like, you only go there because you walk by it and you're like, this is the only place I can do my fx. And you, like, you, if you're in Mexico, you need pesos and, you know, if you leave that airport without it, you're done. But if you, like, if this was.
00:46:58.904 - 00:47:23.958, Speaker A: Everyone has a smartphone, you know, I think also, you know, like, this is gonna be like, sound ridiculous, but the idea of actually holding paper, currencies, whatever. But, like, everyone has a smartphone, you can use your app, convert from dollars to pesos while you're in the airplane. While you land, you convert it, you have Internet. Boom, you convert it, then you pay, you tap your phone. Done. That's the flow. Like, there should be no cash in New York City.
00:47:24.006 - 00:47:34.086, Speaker B: I've only been here for two months now, but it's really big. You go a lot of places and they only accept cash. It's interesting. I mean, we kind of know why, but you know what? Yeah, okay, I'm just gonna.
00:47:34.230 - 00:47:55.284, Speaker A: We only take cash at, at block or blockbusters. If you want to pay for your block or subscription research, by the way, next week you're going to get an inner look at a new podcast that is launching. And from the research guys, I won't be here most likely. And so you can only pay in cash?
00:47:56.144 - 00:47:57.232, Speaker B: Yeah, some of those, some of those.
00:47:57.248 - 00:48:02.056, Speaker A: Guys have send us cash, waza cash to your office in Manhattan or my address.
00:48:02.120 - 00:48:11.718, Speaker B: Either way, I'm pretty, I'm pretty good with money. I can handle it. But, yeah, you got to tune in next week. We'll drop it on the Twitter feed and everything. But we do have our research guys are dropping new podcasts. I've already heard the first episode. It's awesome.
00:48:11.718 - 00:48:28.862, Speaker B: So you'll have to tune in. I'm going to drop one little piece of alpha that may not be true Alpha, but last week we were talking about modular blockchains and celestia. Chris Berniske, who used to work at Ark, and he's been in the crypto space. He's at, I think, placeholder. He started. Placeholder and he's written a few books. I think he's one of the first guys I started reading about when I got into crypto.
00:48:28.862 - 00:49:24.694, Speaker B: He just had this tweet yesterday about the SVM, which is the Solana virtual machine, and then you have the EVM, the Ethereum virtual machine. He's saying, watch this space, because you're seeing a lot of different protocols raise money that are just execution layers using the SVM, which I don't know all the technical details, but is more performant, in some ways at least, than the EVM. It allows parallelization, so it's multithreaded instead of single threaded. But the big point of it is they're able to innovate very quickly because when you saw the EVM Ethereum, then you had avalanche and all these EVM chains pop up like Phantom. They were building monolithic chains that did the execution, the data availability and the consensus, and also had to build up the security. But you're seeing a lot of these SVM new chains launch, but they're just doing the execution, and that allows you to spin up and innovate faster. So, one, I just think it's interesting to watch the SVM, and it's really cool to see by breaking these down into modular pieces, you can innovate faster.
00:49:24.694 - 00:49:26.854, Speaker B: Is that Alpha?
00:49:27.354 - 00:49:28.234, Speaker A: That was Alpha.
00:49:28.314 - 00:49:45.116, Speaker B: Maybe. We'll find out. We'll find out in a few years. Santi, anything else you want to talk about before we close? Think Santi froze on me. If Santi comes back, we may continue, but we pretty much need to wrap this up anyways. So Jason will be back next week. He's going to be back from his vacation and also his wedding.
00:49:45.116 - 00:49:49.924, Speaker B: So excited to have him back on. Maybe I'll join from time to time. And everybody, thanks for joining. See you next time.
