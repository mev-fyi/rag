00:00:00.560 - 00:00:00.824, Speaker A: No, no.
00:00:00.824 - 00:00:25.030, Speaker B: That's what caused Lehman brothers and the entire fucking financial system to blow up. Yeah, these things happen. We're not in here crypto. But my biggest point, and I'll say time and time again, is whenever people are critical of something like Avi and maker and defund, like, at least you know where that money's going. And you have full transparency into that process. Whether you want to look, that's your problem, and that's on you. It's always on you.
00:00:25.030 - 00:00:36.816, Speaker B: You always bear the responsibility. It's, at the end of the day, your money, but that's. It's your money. When you deposit in these protocols, it's not your money. It's not your money when you deposit in a bank. There's very big difference.
00:00:36.960 - 00:00:37.576, Speaker A: All right, everyone.
00:00:37.640 - 00:00:58.400, Speaker C: So on empire, you obviously know that we talk a lot about the institutions coming into crypto, and that is why we are super excited to share that. We are hosting the digital asset summit. We've hosted this since 2019. It's coming up in London, March 18 to 20th. Don't miss your chance to get ahead of the curve. You can get 20% off with code Empire 20.
00:00:58.472 - 00:00:59.512, Speaker A: We'll see you in London.
00:00:59.648 - 00:01:13.304, Speaker C: Episode is brought to you by north stake, the secure and compliant staking platform for institutional investors. Northstake's ETH staking service lets institutions earn staking rewards while maintaining maximum flexibility on.
00:01:13.344 - 00:01:14.216, Speaker A: All of their capital.
00:01:14.320 - 00:01:25.244, Speaker C: You can learn more about Northstake's institutional staking services by clicking the link in the show notes or that QR code that is on your screen right now. If you're on YouTube now, let's get into the show.
00:01:27.264 - 00:01:34.504, Speaker A: All right, bro. Welcome back to another episode of Empire. We got the roundup Santi is coming from. Can you. Can you say where you are now?
00:01:34.664 - 00:01:43.044, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, I tweeted about how great coffee was in New Zealand. It is a beautiful country. I've been in. I've been down under for a while now.
00:01:43.944 - 00:01:44.816, Speaker B: I love it.
00:01:44.920 - 00:02:00.840, Speaker D: Coffee. Good trip so far? It's been great. Yeah, I mean, I met with. With a lot of the founders that are there. Like, Kane, you know, Karen's there, Robbie at immutable. We recorded an episode, met with a couple of funds there. It's just like a very vibrant ecosystem.
00:02:00.840 - 00:02:17.364, Speaker D: I didn't go to Melbourne, which also has, like, other folks there, but really nice. Such an amazing country, which most people don't appreciate. Like, Australia is really big because, you know, fun fact, you know, that Australia is almost the size of the United States.
00:02:17.704 - 00:02:19.616, Speaker A: I don't I don't believe that for a second.
00:02:19.720 - 00:02:20.224, Speaker D: You don't?
00:02:20.304 - 00:02:20.928, Speaker A: I don't believe.
00:02:20.976 - 00:02:39.462, Speaker D: That's why I don't believe it. If you look at Antarctica, basically, the way cartography and the map, the way maps are drawn to fit in this kind of. When you look at a globe, when you flatten it out, what is closer to the equator is, is true in size. As you go farther.
00:02:39.518 - 00:02:40.954, Speaker A: Yeah. It gets stretched out.
00:02:41.414 - 00:02:45.030, Speaker D: No, the size is disproportionately smaller. So when you look.
00:02:45.062 - 00:02:47.102, Speaker A: Oh, as you get away from it, then it gets smaller.
00:02:47.118 - 00:03:02.556, Speaker D: Yeah. As you get away for it, the item, the, basically it looks smaller than what it actually is. So Australia being quite south, you know, look smaller than the United States, but actually it's very, very similar in size.
00:03:02.620 - 00:03:02.972, Speaker A: Now you.
00:03:02.988 - 00:03:17.748, Speaker D: You're googling this right now. Just verify this. But I'm pretty sure back checking you. Yeah, yeah. It's like, it's not. It's smaller, but it is not that. Like, it's not like size has you.
00:03:17.748 - 00:03:19.624, Speaker D: Okay, I'll put a different.
00:03:20.164 - 00:03:22.024, Speaker A: Yeah, you're not. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:03:23.344 - 00:03:25.824, Speaker D: I'm not like, I, when I say.
00:03:25.864 - 00:03:30.696, Speaker A: Stuff I like, 80, it's 83% as big. All right, all right, all right.
00:03:30.760 - 00:03:38.240, Speaker D: It's a Pareto 80 flying from Perth, which is on the west coast to Sydney, 6 hours. How long does it take to fly from championship to New York?
00:03:38.312 - 00:03:39.272, Speaker A: Yeah, 6 hours.
00:03:39.408 - 00:03:41.584, Speaker D: Depends. Depends on which way you go. Right.
00:03:41.624 - 00:03:42.328, Speaker A: Because the Gulf stream.
00:03:42.376 - 00:03:46.504, Speaker D: Yeah, but, yes, five half to six and 56 out of 50, but.
00:03:46.584 - 00:04:03.216, Speaker A: All right, so do you want to start with the good news or the bad news? We want to start with ledger or FASB. In my mind, those were the two biggest things that happened this week. We can also talk about Solana fee market. We can also talk about points. We can talk about eclipse, testnet, manta L. Two Solana NFTs. People hated that.
00:04:03.216 - 00:04:16.844, Speaker A: We talked about that too much the other day so we could continue talking about it. Yeah, I got a lot of messages saying, you guys are just trying to shill Solana NFTs. And I was like, my front, these things are up like ten x. That's why we're talking about them.
00:04:18.144 - 00:04:25.420, Speaker D: I mean, we're going to talk about stuff that we find interesting because, I'm sorry, folks, I'm sitting on a chair here and I could be doing other stuff.
00:04:25.452 - 00:04:36.024, Speaker A: And I got so many salty messages that we were talking about bonk. And I was like, I mean, you can hate it or like, go look. You should go. Yeah, go look at chaos posts. I think Chao's been nailing.
00:04:38.244 - 00:05:03.494, Speaker D: We can talk about that at some point because I think he's. Chao is one of those guys that is not afraid to look stupid and actually speaks the truth. And I think, you know, it also speaks to this idea. It's very liberating. It has been for me. Like, at some point you just say, I'm just here to talk about stuff because you're in the pursuit of truth. And Chao is one of those guys that he's come on the pod so many times.
00:05:03.494 - 00:05:18.064, Speaker D: People love hearing from it because he speaks the truth. Like, he doesn't care what other people think. He's just gonna. I'm just gonna he the best, and I'll stop here. The best. One of the best things I've heard him say is, you know, you build community, make everyone rich. And that was true for Ethereum.
00:05:18.064 - 00:05:28.272, Speaker D: We tried to over intellectualize how community was built and Ethereum alignment. Well, guess what, folks, there's a lot of Solana line now because the devs made very.
00:05:28.408 - 00:05:52.470, Speaker A: It's the same reason why VC chains like a VC chain, all that really means is that you launched it too high of an FTV so nobody could make money. So then they didn't get, you know, they didn't have bag bias, basically. That's what a VC chain really means. Not that everyone raised capital at some point. Like, everyone's technically a VC chain. A VC chain is, you just made the mistake of launching it way too high of an FTP. So nobody got rich.
00:05:52.470 - 00:06:22.134, Speaker A: Let's talk about FASB. Um, okay, so fast. Actually, this was, um, big news, but didn't get covered like it was big news. Obviously, blockworks covered it pretty closely, but I don't think the industry was talking about it too much. So, uh, yesterday, on Wednesday, FASB officially adopted fair value accounting for bitcoin for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. And let me just give a primer on why this is so important. So, actually, if you looked at some of the folks in the industry.
00:06:22.134 - 00:06:54.542, Speaker A: So Hong, the president of OKX, said, this is big news, even comparable to having one more pro bitcoin president in a sovereign country. This removes a system hurdle for companies to hold bitcoin long term in treasury reserves. Bill Barhit, CEO of Abras, said, this is way bigger news than the bitcoin ETF. This is huge. David Marcus, I think he was head of payments at Facebook, said, you may think this is a small accounting change that doesn't mean much. It's actually a really big deal. This removes a large obstacle standing in the way of corporations holding bitcoin on their balance sheet.
00:06:54.542 - 00:07:34.132, Speaker A: 2024 will be a landmark year for bitcoin. So, um, the reason that this is just like a two sentence primer here, why this is such a big deal, is right now. The way that bitcoin is treated on balance sheets is it's technically, I think, treated as an intangible or something like an intangible. So the way that that works is when the price of bitcoin goes down, you can mark the asset. You can mark to market on the way down, but you can't mark it on the way up. And maybe you can give, like, another example of this or kind of what this really means. But, like, if you buy, if blockworks were to hold bitcoin on our balance sheet and we got it at 40,000, it fell to 30,000.
00:07:34.132 - 00:07:55.850, Speaker A: We market at 30,000, it comes back up to 40,000 or 50,000. We can't market back up at 40 or 50,000. So it's been a pretty insane kind of archaic rule. But they are, the big update is that they are changing that. So that crypto is going to be measured at fair value on corporate balance sheets. Yeah.
00:07:55.922 - 00:08:17.304, Speaker D: As you said, it is a long term intangible asset. So it is like, treated like a, think of it like a patent. And it's crazy to actually think about that one. It's actually liquid, very liquid. So it should be not long term, should probably be current asset. Like a, kind of like a marketable, like a short term. Like so, so.
00:08:17.304 - 00:09:18.016, Speaker D: And the other one is like, I think if you think about, you know, like microstrategy, for instance, has a ton of bitcoin in their balance sheet, right? Like, as price has come down, because a lot of their, you know, they've been buying at different levels, then when you look at their balance sheet, it's, it's a, it's not an accurate representation of the, of the current value of those holdings. Now, of course, people can do the math, right? You can go in there and say, okay, they're either holding 100 bitcoin, that translates into x, and then their loan docs, right, their covenants, they also obviously are marking them at what is the fair value of that, which is what they could sell it for. So they're not like, tripping covenants, but nonetheless, I mean, I think it's still important when analysts look at a company, right, and you're just looking at the financial health of a company. And if this thing is not being accurately reflected in the balance sheet. I think it's difficult. Right. I think it may be another.
00:09:18.016 - 00:09:42.410, Speaker D: Yet another reason why, if you're on the fence about holding bitcoin on your balance sheet, this treatment hasn't helped. And the fact that it's going now to a more accurate treatment, not a patent, but something that is liquid and marketable, and you can actually market to market, then I think it's. I guess the real question is how many people.
00:09:42.522 - 00:09:58.326, Speaker A: I mean, this happened to microstrategy, right? So Saylor bought billions of dollars of bitcoin. Price increased. He had to hold the bitcoin on microstrategy's balance sheet at the purchase price. Then bitcoin fell in value. Microstrategy had to recognize the. What is. What's that called? It's.
00:09:58.326 - 00:10:10.686, Speaker A: Oh, an impairment list. Impairment listed as a loss. Then bitcoin recovered in price. Microstrategy couldn't recognize the recovery. They had to. Yeah. They had to keep the value on its books at the impaired level.
00:10:10.870 - 00:10:39.054, Speaker D: Even though you're looking at all the metrics, right, and think about, like, how. How, like, automated the stock market is. If you just look at these current ratios and solvency ratios, the asset tests, all these financial metrics, if you were to compare it, it just is out of whack. It's not an accurate representation. I think it's important. The real question in my mind is the impact. I don't know if it's as impactful, actually, as an ETF or sovereign announcing.
00:10:39.054 - 00:11:02.984, Speaker D: The interesting about ETF is that it wouldn't actually matter. Right. Because the ETF would be. If you're holding an ETF on your books, it's got to be mark to market. But I think the real question is, like, how many companies have actually been on the defense or have disposed of their bitcoin holdings, like Tesla, because of this unfair accounting treatment? I would argue very little.
00:11:03.324 - 00:11:04.100, Speaker A: But it's.
00:11:04.172 - 00:11:38.956, Speaker D: It's more of a sentiment, I think, like, you read, or you're. The lines, like, the ETF is coming a more accurate accountant treatment. I think everyone is just sort of realizing this industry is real. Not only that, but it could also bring in meaningful economic stimulus, jobs, capital formation, and fees for all the different kind of constituents that matter. And so I think that's the more, in my mind, that's the more relevant thing. It's like it just brings more legitimacy and in a fair treatment to this house.
00:11:39.140 - 00:11:39.716, Speaker B: That's good.
00:11:39.780 - 00:11:53.236, Speaker A: Yeah. I've always thought it was this, like, bitcoin on corporate balance sheets. Was a bit of a meme and like, not something that was actually going to play out that much. I mean, microstrategy has obviously performed. I mean, it's looking really, really good for them.
00:11:53.420 - 00:11:55.988, Speaker B: 40, 50% premium.
00:11:56.156 - 00:12:06.208, Speaker A: Yeah. So it's looking great for them. But like, I don't know, you don't have corporates going out and buying like stocks and putting it on their balance sheet.
00:12:06.256 - 00:12:49.252, Speaker D: Let me put it this way. I think if you think about payments and stable coins, as that likely won't matter because the question I think if you're holding a stable coin in your balance sheet, I not actually sure if the treatment would be like a long term intangible. I guess it's sort of TBD because we don't really, but presumably with the state coin bill, like it would be treated like cash, cash equivalent. But you know, if you're accepting payments in other currencies or whatever and you're getting Sol and ETH in your balance sheet, then I think this more favorable treatment. Now I'm making an assumption also, I.
00:12:49.268 - 00:12:52.944, Speaker A: Say if you're accepting payment in Sol. Yeah.
00:12:53.064 - 00:13:17.896, Speaker D: Now this makes the assumption that, I'm not actually sure if this applies to things other than bitcoin, but let's just assume that it does. I think it matters more longer term for commerce where there may be less of an incentive to dispose of what you're getting and swapping for cash if you have this type of treatment, which sort of makes sense if you're getting payments in east and Seoul, if you're.
00:13:17.920 - 00:13:23.668, Speaker A: Selling it like block works. Does. Block works, gets payment in crypto all the time. Yeah, yeah.
00:13:23.836 - 00:13:39.444, Speaker D: So, yeah, I don't know. It's on the margin. It's more of like accounting. And I think for what it's worth, an ETF and a sovereign coming out saying that it's going to buy these things is way more impactful. But, you know, agree to disagree with these folks.
00:13:39.604 - 00:13:42.436, Speaker A: Yeah. One step forward though, in the right direction. It's cool.
00:13:42.500 - 00:13:44.128, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely.
00:13:44.316 - 00:13:54.684, Speaker A: Um, okay, less good news. Uh, we've got Ledger, so maybe I can take a step.
00:13:55.904 - 00:13:58.524, Speaker D: Ledger incidents in this pod in the last year.
00:13:58.864 - 00:14:05.024, Speaker A: Yeah, but where like, and how much money do you have on your ledger, like still?
00:14:05.104 - 00:14:10.644, Speaker D: Well, no, yeah, I mean, like let's, let's talk about what happened and then like dissect it a bit.
00:14:11.054 - 00:14:38.274, Speaker A: Okay. So Ledger launched. I'm going to do my best here. Ledger launched something. Yeah, Ledger launched something called the Ledger Connect Kit, which is basically a JavaScript library that implements a button that allows users to connect their ledger device to third party apps like Uniswap or Aave or any DAp. Basically there's an exploit at some point this week. I've got the timeline pulled up here so I can get into the details.
00:14:38.274 - 00:14:46.952, Speaker A: Hours this morning? Yeah, it was this morning. It was this. So we're recording this on Thursday. It was this morning.
00:14:47.008 - 00:14:48.592, Speaker B: It was 09:00 a.m.. UTC.
00:14:48.688 - 00:15:03.528, Speaker D: I told that from the CTO Polygon, which is moody, I think he's pretty on top of this stuff. 09:00 a.m.. UTC. That was like 09:00 p.m. My time. It would have been really your morning, I guess, yeah.
00:15:03.616 - 00:15:46.626, Speaker A: So what happened is there was a formal former employee that fell victim to a phishing attack, which then allowed a bad actor to upload a malicious file to Ledger's NPM J's, which is this package manager for JavaScript code that's shared between apps. And basically any app that you connected to that used Connectkit now had this, I think a drainer basically inserted into it. So you had the potential to basically have your wallet get drained if you interacted with any of those apps that used the Ledgers connect kit. That's my high level.
00:15:46.770 - 00:15:51.514, Speaker D: And by interaction, it's not just connecting, it's signing a transaction.
00:15:51.554 - 00:16:07.314, Speaker A: Signing. Yeah. So I think the TLDR is this malicious version of the Ledger Connect SDK that was pushed to basically pushed into the live code.
00:16:07.654 - 00:16:16.478, Speaker D: And what's important is as soon as this happened, my understanding is it sort of gets rolled out to pretty much most apps by default, like automatically.
00:16:16.646 - 00:16:18.314, Speaker A: I think there's any app that used.
00:16:18.614 - 00:17:01.058, Speaker D: Wallet connect, any app use this would have approved now. Yeah. So the affected chains, there were a lot, basically, most EVM, like, like, it was obviously ethel one, all the different base arbitrum, like Polygon, basically nothing. It was just like, I think it was containing most of those apps. There were some chatter about Solana, but I think it was largely unaffected because most teams haven't even used them. I pinged the soul flare guys as soon as I woke up and saw this, and I was like, guys, are you affected? And they're like, no. We actually have very strict policy of how when you connect to the app, like there's like a second layer here, so they're not affected.
00:17:01.058 - 00:17:09.654, Speaker D: A lot of projects have come out saying, so I guess. I guess the patches, the vulnerability has been patched, right?
00:17:10.714 - 00:17:29.714, Speaker A: It's been patched, yeah. It's fixed. You have to. You should though, update your. I think even though it's fixed on Ledger's end. There is still a way, don't quote me on this, that the malicious code is still cached on browsers that have visited. If you have visited a compromised front end and hadn't made a transaction yet, it's still cached on your browser.
00:17:29.714 - 00:17:37.894, Speaker A: So for me, like I just, I just cleared my, my browser caching. I was like, did I do something on chain? I was like, I don't really remember. Cleared my cache.
00:17:38.554 - 00:18:05.012, Speaker D: I guess the important thing is if you haven't used your sign within your used anything on chain for the last like day, call it that for conservatism. I think you're fine. Everything, see, everyone seems to say that, but just for caution, and you can never be too cautious in the space is just clear. Capture your browser to whichever one you use for, uh, you know, interacting on the chain. Yeah, and then, and then wait, like, like, just don't do anything.
00:18:05.148 - 00:18:05.468, Speaker A: Right.
00:18:05.516 - 00:18:13.404, Speaker D: I know the jerk reaction is, oh, I'm gonna go and revoke everything and move, like just for again, yeah, I.
00:18:13.404 - 00:18:26.356, Speaker A: Was gonna send, I was gonna send USD, I was gonna send us DC today, um, for a, for like an angel check. And I was like, you know what, I'm, I was like, I just told him, I was like, I'm going to send this on Monday. Like, I'm just not interacting on chain for a day or two. Like I said, guys.
00:18:26.380 - 00:18:32.572, Speaker D: Yeah, it's, you're going to be listening to this on Friday. Just like, just don't do anything and take some time.
00:18:32.708 - 00:19:24.454, Speaker A: Okay, so I have, I have a couple questions here. So the way that I understand the origins of the ledger, the way, like the way I understand the origin of this exploit is that there's this ex developer Junichi suguer. I'm sure I'm botching that name that still had access, even though he was an ex employee, still had access to the GitHub repo. He clicked a link in a phishing email targeted at GitHub users. His GitHub account got compromised and then bad actors pushed that malicious code into the library via his account. Why? Twofold, why did this ex employee still have access to a GitHub rep, to the ledger's GitHub repo? And two, why don't they have two party like verification for code updates or something? Like why do they have it so that a single person can deploy code without review by any other party? That's crazy to me. That's crazy.
00:19:25.354 - 00:19:26.774, Speaker D: You shouldn't surprise.
00:19:27.834 - 00:19:33.922, Speaker A: No, but actually, like you should have access controls, internal reviews, multisig codes when.
00:19:33.938 - 00:19:41.186, Speaker D: It comes to, like, it is stupid. I don't know, dude. I literally, it's the third strike or more that we know.
00:19:41.330 - 00:19:58.378, Speaker A: I don't know. Pascal, Pascal, speaking of Das in March. So. Well, I mean, I'm sure they'll be past this by then, but it's like, I don't know, you got, you got a company that's fundamentally built around security, and I'm sure 99% of the times this happens, but, like, you can't, you can't have a 1% moment.
00:19:58.466 - 00:20:33.950, Speaker D: You know, this, this is like a class. This is like, there's a couple of things that are very on edge when they happen. I think the good thing is the entire crypto, Twitter, everyone was on top of it fairly quickly and alerting people. My latest check is that the drainer has gotten like five hundred k of funds, maybe 600. I've also seen that it only included, it only included, like, gas tokens could be drained. So not ERc 20s, only gas. So that would be, you know, ETH or soul.
00:20:33.950 - 00:20:57.548, Speaker D: I mean, the units that you pay for. For gas. Now, I haven't verified that. I just saw one tweet around that. And, and then there's a revoke. I tweet, retweeted this. There's a revoke app site where you can go and enter your address if you have any doubts, and it could actually tell you the approvals that you have.
00:20:57.636 - 00:20:58.904, Speaker A: What's it, what's it called?
00:20:59.204 - 00:21:14.804, Speaker D: The Revoke cash app? I think it's. I read they have a specific site where you. A specific part of their site where it, it will check your wallet and the approvals, interactions you've done and, and tell you if you're safe or not.
00:21:14.844 - 00:21:17.636, Speaker A: Now, revoke cash. That's what it is.
00:21:17.820 - 00:21:22.976, Speaker D: Yeah, revoke cash. But anyways, it's on my Twitter profile. We'll link it here in the show notes if you have any doubts.
00:21:23.080 - 00:21:29.104, Speaker A: There's also, there's all two others I'd give a shout out to, which is wallet guard and pocket universe. So there's some, there's.
00:21:29.144 - 00:21:30.336, Speaker C: I haven't used either of those.
00:21:30.360 - 00:21:37.844, Speaker A: I have no affiliation with them. But I saw some people tweeting out saying, like, Wally guard flagged this immediately. Like that big. Very.
00:21:38.304 - 00:22:19.034, Speaker D: I guess the, the important thing here is like, so let's unpack this a bit. Like, what is the issue here? I guess the supply chain attack is real and it's a real threat to the industry. This came out also in May of earlier this year, when Ledger came out with the social recovery feature, everyone's like, now I'm packing. Well, no one's actually been able to verify. It's like closed source. And is there a backdoor? That's always a risk. And so you're trusting these people when you do these upgrades, there's no malicious code, right? You go ledger live, you update your ledger.
00:22:19.034 - 00:23:16.688, Speaker D: You know, inherently there's always trust for all these wallets, the key, some sort of risk. And so, yeah, when the supply chain attack happens, it's pretty bad. Now, this good thing is it's finally contained. And then like zero day exploits, right, chrome and all that stuff that just affects people. But nonetheless, I think it raises a couple of things that I would love to get your take and just talk about. One is this, as an industry, when these things happen, you appreciate how, like, the dependencies, right, and certain areas of vulnerability. And I think this is just like, how do we overcome that? What can we do to make this like, I guess like, blind signing is something that I know has been talked about, is removing it and just creating a better flow.
00:23:16.688 - 00:24:23.282, Speaker D: The other is just like, you sort of assume that people are just going to click their ledger and not really, or their hardware wallet, and when they're signing a transaction, they're probably going to be careless or not really understand the full details of it. It does happen to not only less sophisticated user, it has happened to so many sophisticated people. The Nexus mutual founder, for instance. You get a compromised version of Metamask, and it was my flow. And I know you wanted to talk about like, having tay and other people that, to have a very dedicated plot on security. But like, my advice is, when you see this stuff, don't overreact, understand what's happened, follow a couple people, and we can link in the show notes, folks that I might like, but also take time to like. So if you're using metamask and you're signing, right, you can always, like, I always inspect where it's going, right? So when you're actually proving you have that page shows up to fees on the top, right.
00:24:23.282 - 00:24:58.622, Speaker D: You can actually see the destination address. And so whatever contract you're going to be interacting with. So what do you do? I check that address. I go in an etherscan or whatever, scan to see that address. And just by critically inspecting that address and all the transactions that are happening, it may be tagged as safe, but even then, just click into a couple transactions, look at the history of the contract, understand what the contract kind of does. You don't have to be extremely technical. If you just click into that, say, what is this contract doing? Like, what are the last 20 transactions? So click randomly on five and understand what those transactions are doing.
00:24:58.758 - 00:25:18.086, Speaker A: I know, but listen to what you're saying. That's so insane that you have to do that. Like, you're sending something on chain and then have to go look at the address on ether scan. Look at five transactions. Like, my dad was just in town in New York, and I got him set up on. He's been set up on Metamask, but he's set up on Solana. He's got a phantom wall.
00:25:18.086 - 00:25:38.390, Speaker A: He's trading on Jupiter. He's got a metamask wallet. He's trading on uniswap. He wanted to buy some, like, weird long tail things that he read about in a newsletter that he subscribes to. And so I helped him buy them. But then this morning, and he's not on crypto Twitter, right? He doesn't have a Twitter account this morning. I had to text him, do not open metamask or uniswap or any of that today.
00:25:38.390 - 00:25:51.694, Speaker A: And I didn't know how to describe it to him. So I just said, big industry wide bug. Like, he's think of the. Hopefully, as crypto grows, like, he will be in the 99% of users who aren't, like, spending all their days on crypto Twitter.
00:25:52.594 - 00:26:43.626, Speaker D: That's just my second advice, which is probably the best one, you gotta assume in this chaotic phase of innovation, ever expanding surface area, there's gonna be exploits, continue to be exploits. So approach. My approach is do the Horcrux model separate. It doesn't cost anything to spin up new wallets, break it down, have a hot wallet for doing nfts trading, and then send those to a vault that is never interacting with anything. Just, I think it's just proper hygiene where the same, whether you have a checking account in a savings account, or you have a, you know, you have different bank accounts, same here. Guys use. You use hundreds of wallets.
00:26:43.626 - 00:26:59.254, Speaker D: I know it. You want the convenience of aggregating and seeing how much you're worth on a tick by tick basis. But guys like, you can aggregate that. You can. You can track that easily. What you don't want is to have one wallet with all your assets. You do a rock like, and drains it.
00:26:59.254 - 00:27:30.008, Speaker D: And so, you know, I think I was, for instance, active during this period. I was doing some Degen stuff on chain, and it actually happened during this time. And so I immediately knew which wallets I had interacted with, I checked, I looked at what had happened after, and so I was, what I'm trying to say, it was contained to, like, less than 0.05% of all my assets. So it's like, you know, a worst.
00:27:30.056 - 00:27:32.832, Speaker B: Case scenario where I, you know, where.
00:27:32.848 - 00:27:50.560, Speaker D: I just, you know, got to get affected by this. It doesn't destabilize me. Just sort of like, you live. And so I think that's, um, that's my best approach. Right. If you don't trust ledger, well, maybe get other wallets or maybe get three of them. Have a multisig where you're using different hardware wallet.
00:27:50.560 - 00:27:52.888, Speaker D: It's like, there's a lot of things you can do.
00:27:52.936 - 00:27:53.816, Speaker A: I definitely agree with you.
00:27:53.840 - 00:27:56.464, Speaker D: Like, it's not up.
00:27:57.244 - 00:28:12.100, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, it makes you zoom out and just think about things. It's like, yeah, you know, there's. Ledger's had a bunch of fuck ups recently, but I'm like, okay, like, what am I. What else am I going to go use? Like, I'm using Ledger still. And then it makes you think. Think about, like, wallets too.
00:28:12.100 - 00:28:27.968, Speaker A: Like, everyone in the industry uses metamask, which is run by the same company that also runs the largest RPC provider. And it's like, you know, there's a. Anyways, moments like these are always when.
00:28:28.016 - 00:28:33.724, Speaker D: People start digging in and understanding. There are a lot still a lot. A lot of dependencies.
00:28:34.224 - 00:28:34.888, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:28:35.016 - 00:28:49.756, Speaker D: You know, people talk about nfts and, like, where the data is actually stored. Yeah. You think how many people care about that? No, they just want to look at, like, nice pictures on the phone. Yeah. Well, are you certain that that metadata is stored in a, like, immutable, like, way, or is it distorted and look, like.
00:28:49.780 - 00:28:50.172, Speaker A: You know what I mean?
00:28:50.188 - 00:29:10.212, Speaker D: Like, it's important to dissect all of this, but you go down this rabbit hole from a. As you know, security is an area that I've been mostly focused on for. For a long time, and there's many ways to attack security, like, improve security. I would say there's a lot of people focused on that.
00:29:10.308 - 00:29:10.532, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:29:10.548 - 00:29:12.568, Speaker D: But it's still challenging.
00:29:12.756 - 00:29:17.444, Speaker A: Yeah. All right. Anything else on this topic?
00:29:18.904 - 00:30:32.434, Speaker D: Well, as an aside, like, I had this idea of, like, a wallet flow, and then. And then Tay was, like, pretty vocal around it. She didn't like the proposal. But I'm like, why don't we, by the default, like, if we assume that most users are going to come for and, like, in some of these mobile wallets, argent, phantom, whatever, soulflare, pick your flavor then I think there's a big opportunity to embed certain security features by default for your users. And sure, it may compromise user experience on the margin, but I think that's easier to overcome with, like training, right? And the user with some guides, like setting them up with a couple of wallets, a vault wallet, a hot wallet, and different wallets for NFTs and Defi and just core holdings. And for any approval, like if your wallet, you know, for any approval of a new contract, it simulates a transaction for you, you know, and warns you and I, there are features like this, it would warn you, hey, are you sure you want to send all your 25 orients to some brand wallet? Well, probably not. And so I think we're getting better at this.
00:30:32.434 - 00:31:05.526, Speaker D: But alerting and simulation of transactions is probably the easiest and lift for a lot of, a lot of users, which are still, they're not going to understand what the contract does, they're not going to understand anything, and they're just going to click immediately. But anytime you're interacting with a new contract, there's a delay, you know, stuff like this. I think there's a couple of ways that we can probably improve this for at the wallet level. That's, I think, where a lot of these changes by default, and it can have a huge, huge improvement in protecting the vast majority of users.
00:31:05.590 - 00:31:41.446, Speaker C: All right, everyone, so we talk a lot about the institutions coming into crypto on empire. Santi and I are both headed out to London March 18 to 20th for Blockworks 8th ever Digital Asset Summit. Das this is an institutional buttoned up conference that we've hosted since 2019. I like to joke that it is probably the last remaining kind of suit and tie event in crypto. People are still wearing suit and tie. It's pretty funny, but you'll actually hear from a lot of the largest institutions in the world coming from standard, Charter, FIS, JPMorgan framework folks coming out. Wintermute, Vanek, Goldman Sachs there are a couple big themes of this conference.
00:31:41.446 - 00:32:03.446, Speaker C: One, bitcoin catalysts, the halving and the spot ETF. Two, a view from the buy side. Three, Rwas tokenization and stable coins. Four, global regulatory frameworks. Five, institutional infrastructure, including banking and payments. And six, macro case for crypto. If you have anything to do with the institutional side of crypto, you have to be there.
00:32:03.446 - 00:32:19.094, Speaker C: Santi and I got your back. We hooked you up with a 20% off code. It is empire 20. There is a little competition running internally at blockworks to see who can drive the most number of tickets. So help Santi and I out register with our code and you get 20% off. That is empire 20.
00:32:19.254 - 00:32:21.754, Speaker A: All right, what do you want to talk about next? To talk about these points?
00:32:24.074 - 00:32:24.814, Speaker B: Sure.
00:32:26.274 - 00:32:50.194, Speaker A: I mean, I don't get that. I don't get the hate on the points that I like. I don't understand why everyone's so up in arms about points. So rain. So Rainbow launched points on so Rainbow tweeted out on Tuesday, saying, welcome to rainbow points, the first step towards including our community in the future success of Rainbow. Every Ethereum user has been dropped points today. Claim your points and start earning more by doing the things you already do on chain.
00:32:50.194 - 00:33:12.078, Speaker A: So use Ethereum, earn rewards. Do things get rewards? Like play on chain, get rewards. What is a. So the pushback here? I don't, I don't hate it. Like, I don't get why. Like, I don't know. My wife shops at Sephora and, like, she gets points for doing that.
00:33:12.078 - 00:33:18.440, Speaker A: You know, like, Ikea gives you points, Microsoft gives you points. Like, Starbucks gives you points if you're already using it.
00:33:18.472 - 00:33:50.346, Speaker D: Like, you don't mind it. And if, you know, like, yeah, I don't get it. People are just in this state of, why do we need another l two? And I hate the strategy. And look, I don't know. I'm all for experimentation, and I don't think, you know, time and time again, people get frustrated, like, why do we need another l one? It's a copycat and yada, yada, yada. It's like, instead of, like, bitching about.
00:33:50.370 - 00:33:51.706, Speaker B: It, like, it's gonna happen.
00:33:51.770 - 00:33:56.506, Speaker A: Yeah, let the innovations play out. Like, let people do points. I don't know. Like, I have no issue with these.
00:33:56.530 - 00:34:04.734, Speaker D: Points or call it whatever. Like, fine by me. Like, ultimately, like, I don't see a problem that.
00:34:05.434 - 00:34:21.394, Speaker A: So were you on the Tushar podcast that we did when he was talking about every cycle has its own novel token distribution? So you had ICOs in 2017. I think it was iOS in 2019.
00:34:21.694 - 00:34:23.142, Speaker B: Finance really kicked off.
00:34:23.198 - 00:34:43.033, Speaker A: Remember the Binance ieos in 2019? And then you had Defi summer and airdrops and things like that. You had nfts. There's always these new novel token distribution things. Now. The new novel token distribution is points. And I think points are basically becoming this systems mechanism of token distribution.
00:34:43.653 - 00:34:44.629, Speaker D: Yeah, of course.
00:34:44.741 - 00:34:50.205, Speaker A: Yeah. By the way, I have a startup idea for you, which is whether I want to get your take on it.
00:34:50.269 - 00:34:51.981, Speaker D: I'm a builder or an investor or.
00:34:51.997 - 00:34:57.549, Speaker A: Both from probably from the. I know you're a bad builder.
00:34:57.581 - 00:34:59.793, Speaker D: So we'll approach it from investors perspective.
00:35:04.534 - 00:35:43.018, Speaker A: Okay, so I was talking to some of the teams on Solana that are launching, that have recently launched tokens and done these airdrops and are launching tokens. And I was listening to the Xerox research podcast with Lucas from Jitto, and he's just talking about how hard, like, a lot of these founders are. Just like, it's so hard to prevent Sybil attacks, recycle, however you pronounce it. Um, and it's really, really hard to prevent the gaming of airdrops there. Why isn't there a company that shouldn't be on the founder to figure out how to build a system to prevent that? Why isn't there a company?
00:35:43.186 - 00:35:44.258, Speaker D: There is one.
00:35:44.426 - 00:35:45.890, Speaker A: What's it called? I'm sure you're invested.
00:35:45.962 - 00:35:48.066, Speaker B: I've looked at two and I passed.
00:35:48.130 - 00:36:01.110, Speaker D: But CK Captcha, like, you know, ZK Captcha. CK Captcha. Yeah, that's what I looked at. Well, hey, you know, can't get everything right in crypto.
00:36:01.222 - 00:36:01.622, Speaker A: That's right.
00:36:01.638 - 00:36:05.006, Speaker D: I think names a cloud flare for.
00:36:05.030 - 00:36:13.302, Speaker A: Web three capture service that verifies challenges on smart contract level. I guess that is how it's done in web two, is you have to do captchas and verifies.
00:36:13.398 - 00:36:52.134, Speaker D: Look, we're getting better and better and more sophisticated at like, what is for unsuspecting? Just to level set the conversation. What happens in crypto is you can have multiple wallets and so tied to one person, and so it's not like you can claim a free pizza in, you know, your student council by showing up and showing your id here, no one's asking for your id. So you can have 50 versions and clones of you showing up to get same pizza. So all of a sudden you get all the pizza, and that's not good. And there have been instances where that has been an issue. It has. Like, there's always, there's always some farmers out there.
00:36:52.134 - 00:37:40.974, Speaker D: You hear that picture like that, that guy, like, riding a scooter. Like 50 phones in China. That's basically what you're trying to prevent. You're trying to distribute these tokens to as many people as possible, not just one, but yeah, with it, with AI, like, you can, you can. I think we've gotten better at understanding bot behavior and like, preventing just them getting a disproportionate share of airdrops. I think what I get more, I've also thought a lot about and discussed this in teams about how do you, how do you think about airdrops? Um, and the programs of airdrops, like Jupiter, for instance, announced that they're doing one of many airdrop campaigns. Blur has done multiple, uh, rounds, right? Not just one.
00:37:40.974 - 00:38:15.402, Speaker D: Simple things like that, I think are pretty good. Ultimately, what you dont want to do is blow your entire load in one airdrop and its like, well then up to governance, you can distribute. But I think its better to have a lot of flexibility and have multiple campaigns because youre going to also get a better sense of retention user behavior. You don't want to be in a position where you totally gave all the airdrops and then you don't even have anything. And more firepower for marketing and acquisition.
00:38:15.578 - 00:39:06.844, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think a lot of companies basically took, there's a lot of examples in crypto of basing things off the first time something happened. For example, what I'm talking about here is out of every NFT collection is like 10,000 pfps. Why? Because first big one was basically. Yeah, but to tie this together with this conversation, I think a lot of companies or protocols in crypto, whatever you want to call them, have fixed supply of tokens because bitcoins 21 million hard cap. But if you think about how a company should be built, that fundamentally does not make any sense. You should have more and more shares that get issued as the company grows and needs to do more things with their equity.
00:39:06.844 - 00:39:18.736, Speaker A: And so I think when I see these pie charts where it's like 20% to investors, 20% to the team, I'm like, what a stupid, stupid model that we're even focusing on this thing, it's.
00:39:18.760 - 00:39:28.266, Speaker D: Like, you should have, I don't hear a point. Look, at static point in time, you have to kind of charge. This is the distribution of.
00:39:28.400 - 00:39:30.038, Speaker A: No, I give, I get what you need to do.
00:39:30.086 - 00:39:45.390, Speaker D: Yeah, but, but, but I mean, look, I mean, I went through the exercise of making the proposal for yarn to mint an incremental, what was it, 4000 Wi Fi, because of course they needed to fund the developers.
00:39:45.542 - 00:39:45.878, Speaker A: Right.
00:39:45.926 - 00:40:32.096, Speaker D: And new, you know, ongoing development of the protocol and they, you know, they don't like all the Wi Fi had been for. But I agree with you. I think ultimately the response to that is, yeah, maybe you fix the supply, you have some inflation, because that's what the market, that's just, I think, still good to do. But then say, look, I know we're going to have a discussion tomorrow with Kyle and Dmitry. I think on deepen, I think certain use cases, to your point, gaming deepen require like more thoughtful approach to token emissions. And inflation on a dynamic manner based on user activity, based on, like, it's very different. If you have, like, if you're a game and you said, oh, we're gonna have 10,000 pfps.
00:40:32.096 - 00:40:56.898, Speaker D: Well, good luck. This being a mainstream game, guys, like, basically are capping your users to 10,000. That's, like, going to fly. Okay, maybe you can launch derivative PFPs, which is where most other teams have gone in this direction. Right? Like, Asuki's did, like, to a clone of the original sukis, but that. Yeah, but that never other teams have done it more successfully. So I think, like, yeah, to your point, my.
00:40:56.898 - 00:41:24.820, Speaker D: You're absolutely right. We've been operating under this assumption in crypto around scarcity driving value. Whereas for gaming, for nfts, for social, it is a, like, utility, and that is abundant. And so you. You want to have. You want to have billions of users when you want to have, like, all these different collections and maybe tokens. Now, maybe the counter argument to that is even if you have a fixed supply, well, you can divide these units up to, like, companies go through this motion, too.
00:41:24.820 - 00:42:00.310, Speaker D: Right? Once the stock price goes up over 100, $200, they do a stock split because unit. But unit buy, like, unit. What do you call it? Their unit bias, right? Oh, you can buy 40,000 bitcoin. Oh, you can be a billion, a sheep out billionaire or a bond billionaire. Psychologically, companies, even in the public markets, have realized this. Once their stock price reaches a certain level, 100, 200, 300, psychologically, because you can only buy one share, it boxes out so many people, so they do these splits so that the stock is $2, $5, $10, right. Apple's done this.
00:42:00.310 - 00:42:01.606, Speaker D: Like, the best companies have done this.
00:42:01.630 - 00:42:01.766, Speaker A: Right?
00:42:01.790 - 00:42:29.426, Speaker D: It's not, like, only inherent to crypto behavior, but I guess, like, you can divide Etherium and Solana and all these different tokens into, you know, 18 zeros are basically infinite. Well, not even say, but, like, near, you know, me, but still. Yeah, I don't know. There was a one thing I want to talk about. I watched the L2 video, late layer zero.
00:42:29.530 - 00:42:30.018, Speaker A: Layer zero.
00:42:30.066 - 00:42:50.598, Speaker D: So launch is sort of the authentication protocol. Focus closer. I think the team is extremely talented. And Steve, launch v two. There's a great video with primordial, the founder, Brian. People should go watch that because I think he, like, why I think this is Rollins is because he talks about, like, the importance of security. Live news.
00:42:50.598 - 00:43:16.624, Speaker D: He talks about in decoupling that. He talks about the importance of communication and the core principles of crypto. Like immutability, censorship, resistance. I think it was just like a really put together a very good video. Even if you don't care about layer Zero does, I think it's still a good video because it talks about the kind of the core ethos of crypto. So it's really nice. The point I wanted to make is a lot of times you can change these things up to governance.
00:43:16.624 - 00:43:41.164, Speaker D: So obviously the idea of how many tokens are emitted, like some of these parameters, not immutable, it's not like bitcoin sends some, but like you can in theory upgrade a lot of these parameters for many protocols. And I go back and forth on that. If these are things that can or can be upgraded at the smart contract.
00:43:41.244 - 00:43:41.864, Speaker A: Level.
00:43:44.764 - 00:43:59.426, Speaker D: I think you can make arguments for both and certainty of not having it ever be upgraded. But I think certain features maybe like token supply may, if there's a quorum, but I don't know, I'm not wait.
00:43:59.450 - 00:44:15.874, Speaker A: So just to make sure I understand it correctly, layer zero's the v two, basically upgrades the architecture and the main change is that it decouples the security and the execution is that the, it's really liveness.
00:44:15.914 - 00:44:22.188, Speaker D: So like I'm going to butcher explain it. I'd rather not. But think what is live?
00:44:22.276 - 00:44:23.948, Speaker A: What does liveness even mean?
00:44:24.076 - 00:45:16.308, Speaker D: Well like, like, basically like what layer zero allows you to do is like for instance say you want to swap a token, you're in a theorem I'll Juan and you want to swap a token arbitra, but you don't have any tokens in arbitrary right, or you don't have any tokens in base and you want to go across these chains. What they've done is they would just make that extremely easy, abstract all the complexity. They will swap your, your tokens in one chain from that in the other and then execute whatever transaction you want to do. And so I think that's, that's like super important. It can also be for voting and other components. So a lot of it is when you think about the communication between chains is my appreciation is well, how quickly that happens. With what certainty? One chain is more secure than the other, so you have to deal with like different mechanisms and sense validation.
00:45:16.308 - 00:45:33.904, Speaker D: Like basically one chain is more secure than the other. It's just like it is fairly complex thing to do when you think about all that. And Layer Zero is just doing it in a. I think it's a big improvement in what they've done in making that just far easier for people to interact across.
00:45:34.204 - 00:45:39.600, Speaker A: That's cool. Taking a bit of a different approach from like Axelr and CCIP and wormhole. And that's cool.
00:45:39.732 - 00:45:40.264, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:45:40.384 - 00:45:51.800, Speaker A: Is live. Is live this basically like what, what? Like the ability of a distributed system to process transactions. Like what, what is.
00:45:51.992 - 00:45:57.024, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that's, I think that's a good way of putting it.
00:45:57.184 - 00:46:08.258, Speaker A: I gotta ask our analysts. By the way, we published it, we just published a report on, on layer zero on I just saw on our research platform. I haven't read that, so we'll link that in the show notes.
00:46:08.426 - 00:47:01.832, Speaker C: Today's episode is brought to you by Northstake, the secure and compliant staking platform for institutional investors. Northstake is purpose built for institutions that want to enable the ability to move in and out of staked ETH seamlessly while controlling all aspects of their fund management nor stakes. Tokenized ETH staking service offers institutions easy, low risk crypto yield opportunities complies with both AML and Mika regulations, making it possible for institutions to tap into Ethereum's growth and earn staking rewards even through these pretty turbulent regulatory times. In crypto, if you are an institutional investor seeking compliant crypto exposure and yield, Northstake streamlines that all for you. To get started, head over to Norstake DK tokenized e staking. I know you're probably not going to go to that long URL, so just click the link in the description of the episode. That'll take you right to Norsteak site.
00:47:01.832 - 00:47:07.084, Speaker C: Or if you're on YouTube, scan the QR code on your screen right now. Now let's get back to the episode.
00:47:07.584 - 00:47:32.344, Speaker A: My prediction for 20, we're going to do a predictions episode next week, which I'm pumped on. But one of my predictions that I've talked about in here before is that blast. Uh, blast is fine, but what blast is going to cause is all these l two s starting to create l two s with yield. And we saw that for the first time this, this week with, uh, Manta. Is that right, Manta? What is Manta?
00:47:33.524 - 00:47:44.188, Speaker D: Well, well, I, full disclosure also investor, seed investor way back. So they, their privacy, their whole thing was privacy since day one. It's like we need better.
00:47:44.356 - 00:47:45.644, Speaker A: I remember these guys.
00:47:45.764 - 00:48:06.488, Speaker D: Yeah, it guys. And so they're very focused on again, like a privacy chain. So that to me was the most common thing. They're still in that direction. They're launching now their l two, like a privacy focused l two. And of course they dubbed it the new paradigm. And so a lot of it is native yield.
00:48:06.656 - 00:48:10.884, Speaker A: Is that a jab is that a jab at paradigm for funding blast?
00:48:11.624 - 00:49:18.402, Speaker D: Well, I mean, I don't think it's coincidence and they're using, I think the different mechanism that they're doing and I had a call with Kenny, the founder, not too long ago, two days ago, about like they're using mountain protocol, which I think Newcastle like Nick Fund is an investor in, which is basically, I think we talked about this in the pod when he was on, but basically it's a basically like a treasury yield bearing stable coin and they're using that to capture yield and the same way that blast is using maker and lido to capture megagor to capture yield from treasuries, lido to capture yield from native ETH staking Monta's taken a similar approach by using mountain on the stable coin side to capture the treasury yield. But yeah, you're right. I mean, I think once someone does it, then everyone else will do it. If it works, everyone else will do it and that's the nature of the space.
00:49:18.458 - 00:49:28.894, Speaker A: Yeah, and something like Manta is going to be fine and then someone else has 5% yield and then someone's got 10% yield and then someone offers 20% yield. Now we've recreated, it's this cycles version of Celsius and blockfi.
00:49:29.594 - 00:49:43.914, Speaker D: No, see this is where I struggle with that because I know you're going there, Mike. I saw a tweet from Mike, your co founder, that he said this. Right, so this is going to be a problem because it's ponzunami and yield going. People going to chase high yield.
00:49:44.294 - 00:49:44.934, Speaker A: But it's.
00:49:45.014 - 00:50:34.274, Speaker D: I agree. Look, this happened in DeFi summer. New protocols launched. They advertised yield in the thousands of AP wise and then that very quickly compressed for a variety of reasons, primarily the token price collapses as like, you know, cell pressures start farming. Like there's a lot of mercenary capital, but it's a very different thing. It's not like, so if you're a Celsius user and you were advertised above average yields on your bitcoiner ETH, then you're like, okay, great, I'm going to trust Celsius to do whatever it is that they're doing on the backend to give me 2% higher yields or even more, well, terms. What? That was not the right thing because they were taking a lot of risk, they were not doing proper due diligence and underwriting for a lot of their counterparties.
00:50:34.274 - 00:50:39.722, Speaker D: The difference between all this happening on chain is that you can see where.
00:50:39.738 - 00:50:42.530, Speaker A: That money goes exactly like the counterparty.
00:50:42.562 - 00:51:16.110, Speaker D: Risk is, yeah, you're, you're taking, no matter what the yield is, you're taking smart contract risk always like, and no one should ever use the term risk free, ever, ever, for anything. There's always risk in even treasuries. There may be a benchmark rate, but there's always risk. Whether you want to see it or understand it, that's your problem. So there's always going to be a risk of interacting with any contract, whether it has yield or not. Yield is an incentive. Whether you understand where the yield comes, comes from is a different thing.
00:51:16.110 - 00:52:20.578, Speaker D: But safe to say is that the higher the yield, the higher the risk and dependencies and interactions of a smart contract. So I don't think it's a, an issue, actually. Now they could, they monta or blast or protocol XYZ may offer points, and they may say that their tokens worth a billion and a gazillion FTV. Well, we all know what happens, right? Yields compressed very quickly and capital is very mercenary. The other thing that you have now is you have this sort of like natural rebalancing of, you have eat staking, which is the benchmark rate. Think about like that as buying treasuries on chain, right? I'll say it is kind of like if you hold ETH staking it and whatever yield you get, that's like the benchmark rate. So say you're earning 4% staking your ETH, and then all of a sudden that goes, you know, that goes a lot of, a lot of ETH state people staking eat, say, oh, wait a minute, I can earn five times more with this other protocol.
00:52:20.578 - 00:52:45.742, Speaker D: Let me unstake and go there. Well, what happens? Right? They go and chase that yield by virtue of more demand, that yield goes down, and that in the, in the ETH, yield goes up. So what does that do? That's a natural rebalancing, right? Some people say, oh, well, yield is now like 10% here, and ETH went up to six. Well, 4% incremental is not worth the risk. I'm going to go back. And so there's a natural, like, yeah.
00:52:45.758 - 00:52:52.350, Speaker A: Like defi summer where you'd, you'd, you'd run into a pool. The pool yield would go down, you'd chase into another one. It would rebalance.
00:52:52.422 - 00:53:37.760, Speaker D: The nice thing here, though, is that you have, like this kind of nate, that you have this benchmark, which is going back to, like, the base asset, like Ethereum, right, or Solana, to stake it, and so just changes the dynamic a bit. On the margin. So capital should be more efficient. Because before it was like, if you held ETH, you could deposit an aviary compound and clip, like, whatever you yield, when there was, like, a lot of Degen leverage on chain, you could be earning a pretty penny on the borrowed assets that were in high demand. But now you can just do it without, without even interacting with a money market and taking that risk of that idle call, incurring bad debt. You're like, depositing your money in a bank here. You're just keeping your money by staking it.
00:53:37.760 - 00:53:46.124, Speaker D: So anyways, I don't think, I don't think it's. I think it's an unfair characterization, is what I'm trying to say. If you say it's gonna, it's a saying. It's no different than Celsius.
00:53:46.164 - 00:54:22.664, Speaker A: And, yeah, I don't think this is no different than Celsius. I think what this causes is people launching products that are basically marketing what will eventually be yield that is not real yield there. You know, like, today. Today, like, blast, like, blast is great. Like, or I don't know if it's great or not, but blast puts your money in, what, Lido and maker treasuries. That's totally fine. But then some l two is going to come along and put it in a, you know, something riskier, and then someone's going to basically take your capital and do, like, a hedge fund like strategy with it.
00:54:23.044 - 00:54:30.784, Speaker D: How's that any different from you putting your money in the back, by the way? Do you know where that money's being invested?
00:54:33.194 - 00:54:38.866, Speaker A: I mean, no, no, obviously. Obviously of no idea.
00:54:38.890 - 00:54:40.810, Speaker D: But with, like, yeah, bank of America.
00:54:40.842 - 00:54:41.962, Speaker B: JP Morgan, at that.
00:54:42.018 - 00:54:45.214, Speaker A: Yeah. And that's what caused things like Celsius to blow up.
00:54:45.794 - 00:55:10.540, Speaker D: No, no. That's what caused Lehman brothers and the entire fucking financial system to blow up. Yeah, these things happen. They're not in here crypto. But my biggest point, and I'll say time and time again, is whenever people are critical of something like Avi and maker and Defi, I'm like, at least you know where that money's going. And you have full transparency into that process, whether you want to look, that's your problem, and that's on you. It's always on you.
00:55:10.540 - 00:55:23.302, Speaker D: You always bear the responsibility. It's, at the end of the day, your money. But that's, it's your money. When you deposit in these protocols, it's not your money. It's not your money when you deposit in a bank, there's very big difference. And trying to regulate.
00:55:23.428 - 00:55:26.074, Speaker A: All right. All right. That's a good, that's good. Pushback. That's good.
00:55:26.114 - 00:55:48.694, Speaker D: Like that. If I were to end this discussion all time, I always bring it back to that. In Defi, you're the bank. You control where that money goes and what these smart contracts can do with that. Sometimes you can approve certain things that these smart contracts can be just like a bank. They can move your money around. They can do these strategies.
00:55:48.694 - 00:56:02.598, Speaker D: You have to understand that. But you have that lease. You always, always, always have transparency of where that money is flowing and going in real time. 24 7365.
00:56:02.686 - 00:56:03.030, Speaker A: Always.
00:56:03.102 - 00:56:18.010, Speaker D: You can inspect and look and revoke access and bring it back. Can't do that with in your back. That's why people have 20 bank accounts for quick money. Treasury. Seriously. I mean, that's why, that's why Defi works.
00:56:18.042 - 00:56:18.570, Speaker A: I mean, that.
00:56:18.642 - 00:56:20.378, Speaker D: I'd rather put contract.
00:56:20.466 - 00:56:28.250, Speaker A: Yeah. I was a preview of the predictions episode. It's gonna be a little spicy next week. It seems like.
00:56:28.362 - 00:56:38.974, Speaker D: Define gaming are back. Well, we're also gonna hopefully we spend some time looking at how dumb some predictions were because I always like to go back.
00:56:39.474 - 00:56:57.564, Speaker A: I have a price. I have a price question for you. So do you think there's any money to be made on like buying like Aave and uni and these kind of like OG defi things or that? That's a, that's a fool's game.
00:57:01.744 - 00:57:06.844, Speaker D: I tweeted about this, too, and I keep saying this because that's what I do for a living now. I should post.
00:57:08.864 - 00:57:15.444, Speaker A: Santa. You're basically an influencer now. How do you feel about that? You're a content creator.
00:57:18.024 - 00:57:20.444, Speaker D: I don't know what I answer, to be honest.
00:57:23.744 - 00:57:24.484, Speaker A: Look.
00:57:26.184 - 00:57:27.284, Speaker D: I think you.
00:57:29.064 - 00:57:29.376, Speaker A: Do.
00:57:29.400 - 00:57:33.700, Speaker D: Fundamentals matter. It's okay.
00:57:33.732 - 00:57:34.556, Speaker A: Not yet.
00:57:34.740 - 00:57:42.264, Speaker D: I think makes more fees in a day than Solana, but it's not. It's valued at, you know, 130 5th.
00:57:44.564 - 00:57:45.344, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:57:46.164 - 00:58:15.186, Speaker D: What's the right way to look at these things? I think, I think one way certainly is to look at profitability. Synthetix is having its moment because it can't. Yeah. It stopped inflation and, you know, it's getting a lot of on chain like activity through Quinta and all these other products. Lyra and the whole ecosystem of apps, you know, per activity, they're making a million bucks like this week alone in up and down environments. Basically. You look at that and you say, well, that's pretty compelling.
00:58:15.186 - 00:59:02.380, Speaker D: And then you look at, okay, what's the supply? What do I like? If, if basically a protocol is got, earn more fees in a year than the entire fully diluted market cap. Well, I would argue that's a disconnect in value. Right. You, what happens when these buybacks happen? People look at rollbit like it's trading at a decent discount. There's robots I think is priced the way it is because it's fundamentally quite risky on, because you don't know it's non founders. But like these protocols, like I mean maker has been, you can look at the buybacks on chain and you could think of it. So my argument is, over the last two years, if you look at ETH, Defi to ETH charts, they've been terrible.
00:59:02.380 - 00:59:35.354, Speaker D: Like absolute dog shit. Are they due for rebound? I think there are arguments to be made that Defi is back. It's working. It always has worked. You looked at also the stress test that we had earlier this week when there's a drawdown down 520, 30 like percent day, 20% 1020 depending on the tokens. But like Solana, Defi was stress tested and that was very good to see. And Defi just continues to work.
00:59:35.354 - 00:59:50.874, Speaker D: And so it's always a relative game. I think people also understand and like better infrastructure investments. Like l one's like very generalized. Like look at Cardano, the less you ship, the more it spurs people's imaginations of what can be.
00:59:52.574 - 01:00:01.154, Speaker A: Yeah, look at, look at nfts with utility. It's like the more, the more you attach utility to an NFT, the more that someone can put a value on it which drives the price down.
01:00:01.574 - 01:00:12.808, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean maybe the more intellectual question, fun question is the top ten, how's that going to change over the next year? Because I've always been wrong about that, consistently been wrong of what I think the top ten should look like.
01:00:12.926 - 01:00:38.024, Speaker A: Yeah, and what these number five cardano is number eight, that dosh dogecoin is top ten right now. And by the way, it will stay there this whole cycle grow. I mean, look at that, look at, actually the more interesting is eleven through 20, polka dot tron chain link polygon ton coin, which I think is telegrams. Maybe shiba inu litecoin is still top 20.
01:00:38.464 - 01:00:52.144, Speaker D: Yeah, like exactly, I mean, but like you can make the argument tron is actually fundamentally like what are you like Justin or not? Putting that aside, like, like stable coin. It's actually like the tron. Stable coins like problems is like the most widely popular and place.
01:00:52.184 - 01:01:01.884, Speaker A: Oh, yes. Yeah, yeah, so that's heather on Tron is, I mean, also iMX going parabolic since our, your podcast with Robbie it's crazy.
01:01:03.464 - 01:01:08.798, Speaker D: I mean, to say that it was because of my podcast is. Is a unfair character. Not even got.
01:01:08.966 - 01:01:10.550, Speaker A: Causes causation.
01:01:10.622 - 01:01:14.270, Speaker D: Full causation, zero causation there.
01:01:14.302 - 01:01:15.074, Speaker A: Causation.
01:01:15.974 - 01:01:44.368, Speaker D: But gaming and defi, probably two areas that I think are being underappreciated for sure. But yeah, my top 10% have always been wrong and probably will continue to be wrong. So a part of my brain is entertaining. Well, if it's going to be wrong, then counter trade that and then do what? A lizard brain or take the left curve approach. I'll leave you with this, I think. And you and I were talking about this before starting this episode again, going back to Xiao. He's a great thinker.
01:01:44.368 - 01:02:05.636, Speaker D: He's not afraid to be called out and being controversial. Not because he wants to be controversial, because I think he says things that a lot of people may think but are not, are too afraid to say publicly. And I think he has a great post and we'll end it there. Not a video or podcast. Not a video or another podcast recommendation. But I will encourage people to go and read shows. Post on.
01:02:05.636 - 01:02:14.388, Speaker D: On t gents. Right. Forget the name of it, but we'll link it. I think it's a very honest, like, expose.
01:02:14.436 - 01:02:14.820, Speaker A: I don't.
01:02:14.892 - 01:02:15.620, Speaker D: Maybe not explicit.
01:02:15.652 - 01:02:28.824, Speaker A: You know, as a cat. It was a counter post to, I think Ollie at Andreessen posted something being like, what are we all doing here? For all just de jetting? And chow's like, you're missing the point, my friend. All right, let's call it a day.
01:02:28.864 - 01:02:36.312, Speaker D: Yeah, absolutely, sir. Anyways, great, great chatting. We'll be. There's an interesting lineup.
01:02:36.368 - 01:02:36.560, Speaker A: Right.
01:02:36.592 - 01:02:37.176, Speaker D: Of new pots.
01:02:37.200 - 01:02:53.344, Speaker A: Just. We have. We have empire coming out next week. We have. We have avalanche coming out next week. We got avalanche coming out next week. We are recording a really interesting debate tomorrow with Dimitri, who used to be at one kx or fund.
01:02:53.344 - 01:03:07.540, Speaker A: Yeah, one kx. And then Kyle Simone from Multicoin. Kyle is taking the pro deepin corner, and Dimitri is taking the anti deep in corner. We'll release that soon as well. So a lot of good pods. Yeah.
01:03:07.572 - 01:03:38.714, Speaker D: And I'm recording one with the founder of Modulus and Casey, who was at Google and studied AI before. It was cool. And one of the best investors in the space, I think, on AI and crypto and kind of parsing through the narratives. And so, yeah, a lot of stuff we try to be relevant and touch on things that we care about and I think are important and in the limelight. So if you want to hear anything in particular, let us know. And if we're doing everything wrong, also let us know.
01:03:38.754 - 01:03:39.634, Speaker B: We read the comments.
01:03:39.754 - 01:03:47.326, Speaker A: What do you think is more. What do you think is more of, like, a neg influencer or content creator? What should I call you? God?
01:03:47.350 - 01:04:07.358, Speaker D: I think content creator is, like, a soft influencer. I'd rather just rip the Band aid off, you know, be like, come the Lord Jesus all accepted. If a content creator just feels like you're kind of like a. You're still an influencer, but you're shining. You haven't made it.
01:04:07.526 - 01:04:14.510, Speaker A: Yeah, you haven't made it yet. You're creating content but not getting paid for it. I guess what is worth, like, this.
01:04:14.542 - 01:04:34.350, Speaker D: Ain'T making living, but I do it because it's fun. And so you can call me whatever you want, man, by the way. Okay, next episode, I will look very different, and I will do something that you haven't been. You haven't. You haven't actually lived up to this bed.
01:04:34.542 - 01:04:35.714, Speaker A: Shave your beard.
01:04:38.114 - 01:04:44.494, Speaker D: I don't know. We'll leave it at that. That is the perfect place to. This is the perfect place to end.
01:04:44.834 - 01:04:45.934, Speaker A: Why are you doing.
01:04:47.274 - 01:04:49.134, Speaker D: Because I haven't done it in ten years.
