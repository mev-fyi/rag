00:00:00.560 - 00:00:06.474, Speaker A: The whole industry is just starved for action in such a way that they're like, as soon as anything gets a little momentum, it's just flying.
00:00:07.774 - 00:00:13.754, Speaker B: All right, everyone, welcome back to another app of Empire. We have Dan from CMS joining today. Dan, what's going on, man?
00:00:14.214 - 00:00:24.310, Speaker A: Nothing. I'm like, we were talking a little bit before. This market's still up, so everybody's pretty happy about that. Hopefully, it'll be spring soon, so I'm happy about that.
00:00:24.422 - 00:00:27.900, Speaker B: No complaints, huh? For a Bostonian who's freezing his ass off over there.
00:00:28.022 - 00:00:35.928, Speaker A: I know it was, like, 65 degrees, like, a week ago, and then it went to, like, I don't know, like, ten or something like that, so it was a real emotional swing.
00:00:36.056 - 00:00:43.936, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, before we jump into the pod, man, I feel like congrats is in order. You survived when a lot of your comrades did not, so.
00:00:44.120 - 00:00:52.112, Speaker A: I know. Yeah. Pretty happy so far. I saw that. I was actually saying that Abby, who was on. I was on this recently with you. Word? I don't know.
00:00:52.112 - 00:01:25.258, Speaker A: That's probably six months now. I think, really, the only reason we made it out the other side is I lived. Started trading bitcoin forever ago now. But in the beginning, exchanges didn't rob you, but they would just get hacked catastrophically, sort of every six months. Like Gox, everybody remembers, but even before that, the floor was really big. They got crushed. Before that, it was the one that Bitfinex turned into, and then Bitfinex got hyped as well.
00:01:25.258 - 00:02:00.128, Speaker A: Excitingly, the whole point was you sort of had to mitigate your counterpart exposure on exchanges because you could never trust that your capital would be preserved there. And it was, like, a very high risk. You sort of made the assumption that one exchange would rob you if you were using five in any given year, and you had to expect a catastrophic loss of funds for something like you were parking at. So while we used FCX, and we were very involved, um, like, we were investors in them, and, like, we had capital park there at the time. Like, when it went down, like, we. We had an amount of, like, balance that we were able to, like, eat right. So, like, we.
00:02:00.128 - 00:02:36.390, Speaker A: It was never in our thought that that was completely safe. Uh, we didn't think it would end up being a case of, like, fraud, but we. We did think that there was, like, a potential, like, security risk, right? Like, the cold wallets get compromised from some random thing. You'd be like, well, there's supposed to be cold, but, like, shit happens, right? So, like, there's always the possibility that like the funds are lost because of seizure hack, but most likely hack anyway. So that was like why we were able to sort of come out the other side of it even though we got ding, sort of just like everybody else did. So we self custody a lot when we can maybe use some of the custodians. But that was the big learning lesson I think a lot of people got from this, though.
00:02:36.390 - 00:02:40.246, Speaker A: People from the past sort of had just like archaically kept around.
00:02:40.390 - 00:02:44.114, Speaker B: Yeah. How badly did you guys get dinked? If you can. If you can talk about that.
00:02:44.654 - 00:03:14.070, Speaker A: I think it was about 15% of our aum. Um, it's hard, right? Because like what do you mark everything to? And actually to be fair, like we're not even entirely sure how the claim is going to work. Um, because like we had, it was weird the last 48 hours. Um, you kind of had like this weird period where you knew you weren't getting your money out. Like withdrawals were not happening but you could still trade. So like you had this odd incentive where you were trying to lose as much money on FTX and like make it away. Right.
00:03:14.070 - 00:03:40.194, Speaker A: So like the one that like, I really like popular Twitter at the time was like he was like buy Solana on FTX and sell it on binance and try to get it. And we were doing all sort of weird parachutes wherever we could get borrow that. We could do delta neutral. So we ended up with a really weird grab bag of stuff on there and we don't know how that's going to be marked or going to be on all that. So I don't know, 15% sort of our best guess where it falls.
00:03:40.354 - 00:03:43.734, Speaker C: I'm curious, Dan, we learned that gallows.
00:03:44.314 - 00:03:46.274, Speaker A: Galois, I think. Yeah, Galois.
00:03:46.394 - 00:03:56.394, Speaker C: Yeah, weird name. French. You know, my friend's terrible. Even though anyways, he sold his stake for sixteen cents of the dollar. He said, look, they're smarter people, might take forever.
00:03:56.554 - 00:03:57.266, Speaker A: What do you think of that?
00:03:57.290 - 00:03:59.614, Speaker C: Do you think that's fair? Would you take it?
00:04:00.154 - 00:04:48.398, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a good question. So you got to remember that there's a time value of money, right? So let's assume like you're looking at five years for like the process, which is probably ballpark sort of estimate. I mean, docs, for instance, is still going, right? Like we're ten years on that. What I've heard from people that do this sort of for a living on the bankruptcy side is like the fastest scenario you'd ever be looking at is two years. So anyway, let's say, let's say five, just for like, simplicity sake, if you think you could make 10% a year in the market sort of on your money, right? Like, that's sort of a 50% return that you have to like, bake into taking the cash today versus whatever you potentially get if you bring it to the end. So I don't know, in terms of a trade in what I think Kevin can sort of make on the money. Otherwise it's probably a coin flip.
00:04:48.398 - 00:05:29.704, Speaker A: I do actually tend to be the assumption that money is probably mostly going to come back. So if you were to make a market on where it's going to land in five years, I'd probably get in the 75 cent to 80 cent mark if I had to make something. But, like, you can use the money for stuff differently today than compound and you don't know how, like, the treatment of stuff's going to be. I think what we've sort of, like, found since like, the dust is settled on this stuff is there was more money than they thought and some of the assets, like, aren't as terrible as they thought, so. And that, that seems to be like, good factors in front of it. Like, this is like, a colossal amount of, like, venture bets that are made net. So you sort of just have this broad basket exposure for the stuff, like, as it plays out over time.
00:05:29.704 - 00:05:50.398, Speaker A: But it's just going to be a long time. I think Kevin, like, wants to move on, which I totally understand. Right? Like, I don't think he wants to be managing a bankruptcy claim for, I don't know, however many LP's he's got for five years. Like, I don't think that's like, a great use of anybody's time. And I'm not even, like, entirely sure. I don't know because I haven't spoken to the LP's. But I guess, like, they're okay with the idea.
00:05:50.398 - 00:06:58.944, Speaker A: Like, look, like we're just going to like, rip the band aid on this and like, move off. So I think, like, it's like, less an economic sort of deceiving, um, than it was just like this, like the rational sort of way to do it. But I've heard they traded up to like twenty two cents. I actually don't know how people are trading the claims, um, because we don't, like, we don't even know how the treatment. I mean, I guess if you have dollars, it's easy because you have a dollar claim. But, like, if you have any other basket of stuff, like, it's like, I've heard, like, weird scenarios from like, people that are legitimate, like, players outside of crypto that do, like, ancy stuff, but, like, the composition of the assets. So here's an example of, like, a scenario we've heard, which we don't know if it's going to be true, but it came from a very reputable, like, person who was saying that because of the way that the agreement was struck and effectively, like, you owned your assets, like, on FTX, the way, like, your user agreement was written, that there's a world that, like, let's say you had 100,000 Solana on FTX, and, like, the bankruptcy goes through, like, all their stuff, and they go, oh, like, we have 5 million Solana, but you may get all your Solana back because they just pay out all the Solana pro rata to all the depositories, and then the rest of the stuff gets handled.
00:06:58.944 - 00:07:31.716, Speaker A: So we don't know if that scenario would play out. Netflix seem to be a little more, like, of a weirder attack that it might take. But anyway, there's just open risks on this stuff, which is also why these claims are trading cheaper than necessarily what the implied value of them would be if you held them to expiry, because there's a lot of unknown stuff that can come up in the bankruptcy scenarios. Like that. Or, like. Yeah, look, I mean, there's still, like, there's been chalk of club x on, like, withdrawals that went out over, like, I mean, like, the 90 day period seems crazy time for customer activity on the thing, but who knows? Like, maybe they're, like, the last 48 hours. Like, we're gonna change stuff.
00:07:31.716 - 00:07:50.436, Speaker A: So I. There's a lot of unknowns in this stuff that's, like, just beyond, like, will they have x axis? They could have x dollars of, like, stuff, and they have, like, y liabilities. Like, how does, like, the claim work? There's, like, weirder things that have to be thought through. So I'm, like, very curious how people are actually trading these, unless they're just, like, pricing them so cheap. They're like, we can eat.
00:07:50.500 - 00:08:04.652, Speaker C: Yeah, for a bacon. So, if I heard you correctly there. So there could be a scenario where they might recoup, like, 90% of the Solana, but 20% of another coin. And so if you add Solana, then you're going to recoup a higher amount versus the other person that has the.
00:08:04.668 - 00:08:05.676, Speaker A: Other bitcoin or something.
00:08:05.740 - 00:08:11.744, Speaker C: Yeah, ethereum. And, you know, it could be a weird waterfall that each investor gets a different amount.
00:08:12.344 - 00:08:49.106, Speaker A: That scenario that floated to us is, like, a potential that being said the person who stated it was like this would. We have no idea. But this is like a, like a viable legal strategy that could, like, be sort of like run out there. So, because, like, we have, like, talked to people about the potential of, like, selling our claim, but again, like, because of the unknowns and like, the haircut on it and like, we also just, like, because we're managing our own capital, we'll just like, sort of sit on it. Like, we don't, we don't have as much of a necessity, I think, to, like, get a bit on it. We were looking, though, to see if there was anything interesting, but it just gotten haircut too much that we're taking the tech now. In the beginning, I think we were more likely to have it a bit, but I don't know.
00:08:49.106 - 00:08:51.138, Speaker A: As they subscribe, we're like, might as well wait.
00:08:51.266 - 00:09:24.732, Speaker C: Yeah. So I was in a Twitter space with you earlier this year where I think you had mentioned that you had gone up a lot to stable coins, or actually you went to stable coins and you went to fiat when there was this whole situation with Silvergate thing. And then you said, no, we actually are now fully deployed into the market. So I'm curious, maybe transitioning a little bit into just what your general take is. On the market. We rallied quite a bit, I think 100%. E sort of bottomed at 800, now it's at 1600.
00:09:24.732 - 00:09:37.514, Speaker C: All other assets have performed similarly. So I'm curious, what's your current thinking on the market narratives or themes you're excited about? Just general open ended question.
00:09:38.294 - 00:10:14.676, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think if I had to say with you to summarize, just aggregate price action for the last three months, you had a lot of four sellers and you had basically 100% the margin a of the ecosystem. If you had any leverage on, you had to take it off. And I mean leverage, um, on the way down, like, we just, like, we touched every potential, like liquidation for sort of everybody. Um, so all that for selling had to go through and, like, that abated. That pretty much abated, like, when FTX blew up. Like, that was sort of like, all right, like, everything's gotten licked.
00:10:14.676 - 00:10:50.674, Speaker A: That could get licked. Um, so that, like, put, like, sort of the floor in it and then absent that, like, you saw, like, steady state of demand. And, like, people who are looking for sort of like lower levels, like step in and we baselined higher, and then we recovered some assets, doubled, bitcoin put in. I don't know, what is it from the lows, 40%. Are you ever taking anyway. And now you're at a point where there's this rebalance of spline demand. But I think the bigger thing of why you can be cautious about this being a whole new bull market is there doesn't really seem to be a ton of new participation in the ecosystem.
00:10:50.674 - 00:11:36.546, Speaker A: You're definitely not seeing, like, a ton of retail participation. Like, you're not seeing sort of that behavior, like, flowing through, and you're not, I think, seeing much, like, institutional interest sort of in, like, moving things going forward. If anything, you've seen, like, an abatement of the crypto became a little toxic for anybody to sort of, like, optically be involved in, especially, like, on the institutional side, especially right now with, like, all the regulatory stuff sort of, like, swirling and landing every other day. So that's, like, definitely slowed. So I think you've got really, the end of foreselling, but no real new demand that's moved in. So I don't think we're going to go test the lows and move materially lower. But I think it's the same pool of capital largely swirling around different things.
00:11:36.546 - 00:12:16.154, Speaker A: Now, I don't know if you had to make me put a price target on bitcoin eat during the summer wager, it stays, like, pretty close to where it is, and then you'll just, like, keep playing this, like, merry go round with, like, other assets that, like, people just get excited about randomly. Like, I don't know, like. Like, stuff. Like, people are doing. Like, there's very much activity, right? Like, there's. There's assets, like, flying around and, like, doubling over the period of, like, a couple weeks and, like, stuff like that. So, like, people are here and they're interested, like, and this is, like, sort of the people that survived the, sort of last six months to a year, they're, like, very much, like, in it and sort of playing the game, but I don't see, like, material, new money moving the needle anywhere.
00:12:16.154 - 00:12:23.414, Speaker A: Anything. Do a good inflation still. Right? Like, there's still, like, assets that, like, these things do, like, throw off emissions. Mm hmm.
00:12:23.534 - 00:12:25.414, Speaker C: Do you think the forest telling is over?
00:12:25.574 - 00:12:39.466, Speaker A: I do. I think there's. I think Voyager is still working out of some stuff. There's the world that, like, the. Some would be. Here's the thing. So the bankruptcy has, like, a weird caveat to it, right? Locks up a lot of assets effectively.
00:12:39.466 - 00:13:11.704, Speaker A: Right? Like, a lot of this stuff just gets stuck in these, like, core things. But, like, it doesn't mean it's stuck there forever, but it will be, like, sort of broadcast and, like, slowed down. So I do think, like, I don't know how the bankruptcies will play out for all these guys, but, like, some of these assets are slowly going to be, like, worked out over the next years and, like, that will happen. And there's a bunch of stuff, like, randomly still held by, like, the government that's got to get sold, but anyway, like, those. So those will be, like, big slugs of supply that sort of come out there. But I think the idea that, like, people are, like, me, Margaret call, and, like, they're all getting licked and, like, they owe capital elsewhere. Like, I think that's, like, done.
00:13:11.704 - 00:13:24.544, Speaker A: I mean, yes, people have gotten themselves into, like, hot water again, potentially, but, like, I don't know. But if you. If you made it out of that sort of shakeout, you should be okay now. You're definitely better than wherever you were three months ago.
00:13:24.964 - 00:13:34.562, Speaker C: Yeah. What do you think? What catalysts are you looking for as an investor? Like, when you, like, we've seen some, like, pockets of the market and narratives.
00:13:34.618 - 00:13:35.666, Speaker A: Really be very hot.
00:13:35.690 - 00:13:55.894, Speaker C: Like, with staking derivatives like Lido and whatnot, was just pretty hot. And then part of NFT infrastructure, like, the whole lido, sorry, the whole blur situation. I'm curious, as an investor, what catalyst do you get excited about? Are you looking for to maybe put on more size or kind of trade around that?
00:13:56.354 - 00:14:46.300, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess I think of it pretty simple still, where if you've got a sustained repricing of risk assets outside of crypto, higher and then retail participating, or even just the existing people in the ecosystem getting wealthier and participating, I think that's the big catalyst you're looking for. If the stock market says maybe new highs are getting close to them, I think it'll be game on for risk assets and specifically crypto on the back of that. Or if there's suddenly, like, here's the thing, it's always something. You never know, right? Like, defi summer kind of, like, sort of just was born out of nothing, and then people went berserk over it. Then it sort of brought us into this whole new wave. Like, halogens, I guess, are like, sort of like, known broadcast events that, like, do stuff, but then even, like, NFTs kind of just like. It's very hard.
00:14:46.300 - 00:15:00.360, Speaker A: It's not unknown, but it's very hard to know what will be, like, that thing in six to eight months that suddenly, like, drives a whole new wave of people sort of interested. And my gut would be like, there's not a ton of reason like guessing what it is. It's more just knowing that there will be at some point.
00:15:00.472 - 00:15:12.244, Speaker B: Preston well, you could argue Defi Summer didn't come out of nowhere. It came out of, I mean, it was just macro, right. It was like COVID money pumping bitcoin starts to rip and then that turns over into defi.
00:15:14.344 - 00:15:42.218, Speaker A: Right. But I don't think it ordered a time. Like, it ended up, like, in hindsight, it looks like very simple, but, like, I don't think when you're in it, you're like, oh, like, this is like compound launches and you're like, wow, this is going to be like, wild. You kind of like, at first they were stupid, right? Remember they launched and they're like, this is the dumbest thing ever. And like, right. And then suddenly three months later, like, everybody in their grandma is talking about yield farming, and you've got, like, people putting dedicated $100 million funds into, like, I don't know, it can happen very quickly. Yeah.
00:15:42.218 - 00:15:42.578, Speaker A: Where.
00:15:42.626 - 00:15:45.214, Speaker B: So where are you looking for value right now?
00:15:45.994 - 00:16:28.530, Speaker A: Yeah, so I think a lot of it is just like this capital rotation game that's like, being played. Um, I don't know, like, you, you see it somewhat like, I don't want to, like, look at anything too in particular, but, like, right in this exact moment. Like, stx is like the thing, right? Like block saxon suddenly, like the rage again, and it's like semi related to ordinals or whatever, but it kind of doesn't even matter. So, like, the whole industry is just starved for action in such a way that they're like, as soon as anything gets a little momentum, it's just flying. Um, like, we saw you showed apt those before that, right? Like, like, and a lot of it isn't necessarily driven by any underlying economic sort of activity. It's more just like, people want to speculate and they haven't, like, a great thing to do it on. And, like, as soon as they get the opportunity, they're just, like, in it.
00:16:28.530 - 00:16:37.562, Speaker A: So it's, like, happening very quickly. It's like rotating through. So just figuring out where that is, like, going next is like, and not even necessarily, like, being first, but just like catching it as it starts to happen.
00:16:37.738 - 00:16:42.662, Speaker B: I feel like we've gone from this, like, hot ball of money to, like, this nice lukewarm.
00:16:42.778 - 00:16:46.554, Speaker A: It's tepid. It's like, yeah, it's like black.
00:16:46.974 - 00:17:02.478, Speaker C: Is that from it? Like, you know, there's obviously this, like, call it a cognitive bias or like this phenomenon where if you've lost and, you know, you're more inclined to take outsize kind of stupid risk to make it back. Like revenge trading or whatever.
00:17:02.526 - 00:17:04.062, Speaker A: Make it all the meme, make it.
00:17:04.078 - 00:17:17.644, Speaker C: All back in one trade. Is this the phenomenon we're seeing like if there are no new market participants, are these folks just like willing to rotate money much faster to make sure they're catching these narratives?
00:17:19.344 - 00:17:39.604, Speaker A: There's probably some of that. There's probably some people that are looking to revenge trade. So they're bad. I also just do because it's the default of the industry is if you just let the participants sit there long enough they'll find something. I think they were buying test native. They're just real fine. The thing is I dont know, theres definitely a demand for it.
00:17:40.824 - 00:18:02.844, Speaker C: Preston, for context, to my understanding CMS, you guys invest both in the public and private markets. Talk to us a little bit about the relative value youre seeing in both of those markets. How are you deploying the incremental dollar? Do you see more opportunities in the liquid stuff or on private opportunities?
00:18:03.144 - 00:18:53.448, Speaker A: Yeah, the liquid stuff still cheaper, especially given the liquidity you get with it and just the base sort of nominal value that this stuff is traded to historically, if you look at it from peak to trough, yeah. The highs are not what you should benchmark everything too. But the relative cheapness to, I don't know, some trailing crypto total market cap in the public side of things seems much more still drawn down than like privates, at least from what we've seen. Private valuations never like, they never really have like this like crash, like they've come down and like, I think you see less people raising like opportunistically, but like stuff's still not like sort of arguably cheap relative to where it trades on a comp in the public market. That would be my guess. So I still think public stuff's like much cheaper relative. Yeah.
00:18:53.536 - 00:18:59.808, Speaker C: What about secondary market? Like a lot of going back to this idea of for selling, you know, people that need to, like FTX ventures for instance.
00:18:59.936 - 00:19:32.238, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know. I just haven't heard about too much of it trading. Um, like we, we've actually reached out to a couple things and like either isn't like sellable, it's like not structurally easy, or like the foundation doesn't want to do it. Um, so I don't know. I, I think there's probably opportunity there. It's just you probably are going to like if you wanted to deploy like $100 million into like buying cheap stuff and secondary and you probably need, like, a really good lawyer and, like, sort of a lot of ties to, like, make it sort of. So I don't know.
00:19:32.238 - 00:19:44.474, Speaker A: Like, we've just seen, like, it structurally doesn't, like, trade enough. Um, I don't know. Either the projects don't want it, don't endorse it, or, like, the sellers, like, have so much tape that they don't do it. I mean, that being said, like, it does happen sometimes.
00:19:45.094 - 00:20:00.118, Speaker B: Like, I think of you guys as a liquid fund, like, more of a hedge fund trading around things that then got into venture as the market was pumping in 2021. Like, are you, do you rethink your venture strategy at all, or are you going to just do the same strategy going into the next cycle?
00:20:00.246 - 00:20:01.614, Speaker A: We'll probably just do the same thing.
00:20:01.694 - 00:20:02.310, Speaker B: Same thing?
00:20:02.422 - 00:20:36.076, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, like, we, like, we fell the same trap that a lot of people did. Where. Especially if you like. So, like, for our situation in particular, which, like, I think a lot of, like, individuals sort of have, like, a good corollary to, is, like, if, like, as you make money, right? Like, let's say the market's, like, going up and, like, you have, like, assets and, like, sort of, like, you're, like, making, like, in general, like, most people's, like, p and l is pretty tied to just, like, the aggregate price. And you're, like, investing in venture. At the same time. If you run into, like, a situation where, like, let's say you make a million dollars and you put $500,000 in a venture, you still, like, owe $500,000 in taxes at the end of the year.
00:20:36.076 - 00:21:08.154, Speaker A: So you, like, effectively have, like, made nothing that's, like, liquid by the end of it. So you gotta, like, and, like, especially if the market pulls around, right? Like, when, like, suddenly you're, like, losing money and, like, you have less liquid. Like, you. You gotta, like, you very much have to be cautious of how much you're sort of shipping out the door as the market is going. I think a lot of people fell into this trap and ended up entirely illiquid by the end of it just because they had burned. They thought those good times would keep rolling, and we all did. And they did roll for a lot, but you end up very much with an illiquid asset composition of what you own.
00:21:08.154 - 00:21:34.272, Speaker A: By the time it's all done, the dust settles. So you got to watch it. That doesn't happen. Yeah, because, like, a lot of the problems that you do see, right, like, alameda's, like, problems are ignoring, like, what they did on the customer side and, like, the sort of, like, issues there. But, like, they're, they ended up with a basket of assets that were illiquid against, like, liquid liabilities. And, like, that was the story of sort of everybody, like DCG, Genesis had the same problem. Three arrows had the same problem.
00:21:34.272 - 00:21:49.954, Speaker A: It was like a lot of this, like, really bad bucketing of, like, what you needed liquid. The last crash was as much like a credit problem as it was a market problem, like price. Yeah.
00:21:50.734 - 00:22:08.238, Speaker B: Let's talk macro for a sec. Six months ago, or whenever you were on Empire last, I don't remember the exact, let's call it six months ago, you said that the midterms were a really interesting factor to watch. What are you watching right now in macro? Is it more inflation? Are you thinking about the midterms? Like, what are you thinking about right now?
00:22:08.406 - 00:22:11.262, Speaker A: Well, we're on the back. Right of the election cycle, so, like.
00:22:11.358 - 00:22:16.670, Speaker B: Excuse me, not, sorry, not midterms. Are you starting to think about, like, the next presidential cycle?
00:22:16.782 - 00:22:42.404, Speaker A: No, it's too far too early. Yeah, yeah. And, like, they're really, like, that's like, this time next year probably. Like that conversation I think you started doing. I mean, I think the bigger thing is just like, what are, like, the larger risk assets? Like, what do you, what are equities doing, like, in the states? Like, what are sort of like, rate expectations going through? That being said, like, we do not tend to, like, have any edge there or know, like, what's going on. Like, those are like, driving a lot of, like. Yeah.
00:22:42.404 - 00:23:02.304, Speaker A: Risk decisions, like, of what crypto's beta is to just like, equities, like every given point. So, I mean, like, there's, there's like, random one off stuff coming, right? Like, you've got this, like, get ceiling fight coming at the end of the summer. Like, that's like a thing that, like, will probably, like, cause other risk assets to, like, move. So it's like, good to know it's on the horizon. But do you guys trade like something.
00:23:02.344 - 00:23:06.484, Speaker B: Like the debt ceiling fight? Are you guys going to trade around that? Or like, how do you position yourself going into that?
00:23:07.664 - 00:23:37.518, Speaker A: We, like, won't probably. If anything, we'll just take some risk off into it just in case we want optionality into it. But I don't know. Like I said, we don't think we have any edge in any of this stuff. So we just know it's there and we can sort of take, we can aggregately cut back our risk or add to it if we think maybe we have some upside on it. But in general, like, we're not doing a ton. Yeah, but, like, also it dominates the conversation, right? So, like, if that's, like, everything that's going on in the market per month, like, it doesn't matter.
00:23:37.518 - 00:23:42.994, Speaker A: Like, what's going on in some, like, random, obscure part of crypto, you know, like, you very quickly lose focus.
00:23:43.374 - 00:24:04.344, Speaker B: What about just the, like, the landscape for and Santa? You probably know this much better than I do as well. But, like, the lands, the, like, investing or, like, the trading landscape? Like, where, who. Where's the flow of money right now? Like, who's still lending? Like, who. Who are the big OTC desks? Is it the exact same as it was a year ago? Or it's like it's flipped on its head or it's just like, same thing. But some players have. Have removed themselves.
00:24:05.564 - 00:24:22.712, Speaker A: So I mean, like, I'd say the larger OTC sort of, like, market is like, kind of the same except for, like, the people we lost. Like, galaxy still, like, running, like, cumberland still running. Like, jump is still running. Wintermute still up there. Like. Yeah, like, you lost. You lost players for sure.
00:24:22.712 - 00:24:33.240, Speaker A: But, like, in general, I think, like, actually, like, the spot. Like falcon, it's still there too, right? Like that. It's kind of the same. Amber made it out the other side. Like, the. That seems to be. There's nobody lending, though.
00:24:33.240 - 00:24:46.672, Speaker A: Like, the lending market's dead. Like, I don't. That's going to be a bit. It's just like, everybody's got a bad taste in their mouth for a good reason. Like, it was. I don't. I don't think you could have run a lending book through the last 18 months and, like, not lost a considerable amount of money.
00:24:46.672 - 00:25:01.316, Speaker A: And. And if you didn't go bankrupt, like, you're just, like, happy. Um, so, like, that's not great. And, like, a lot of the problem there is, like, so much of that is tied up in cords now for, like, a very long time. Like, there's just. There's probably a very good opportunity for somebody. Right? Like, there.
00:25:01.316 - 00:25:25.850, Speaker A: There is clearly, like, you think of all these things that had product market bid in crypto on the trading side. Well, like, the market side, it's like, like, trading, obviously, and then, like, lending and, like, staking. Like, those are the three things that, like, make money that are, like, clear businesses and, like, one of them just has an insatiable demand for it and, like, nobody's doing it right now. Like, I get you still have the defi stuff, but, like, the bilateral sort of, like, model. Yeah.
00:25:25.882 - 00:25:53.684, Speaker C: Like, I've been thinking a lot about this. Like, if you're a founder out there, some of the best opportunities are, like, you pick up some of these ashes and build. It's not to say that, like, the business wasn't bad. It was just that they had terrible, like, risk management practices and it was just the founder. The team was not the right one. But these businesses actually, like, work and can work extremely well. There's, like, void voids in the market from liquidity standpoint that need to be filled and addressed.
00:25:53.684 - 00:26:04.544, Speaker C: And I think the common denominator of block five voyager, like, so, like, a lot of these players just went down not because the business there wasn't product market fit, to your point. It was just like, they didn't have risk management.
00:26:04.964 - 00:26:32.254, Speaker A: Yeah, they died. They died by the wrong reasons. They didn't die from, like, apathy of the market, for sure. Right. Yeah, look, I mean, FTX, like, obviously massive issues, but, like, still, they raised $2 billion of venture capital. Like, and they were throwing off hundreds of millions of dollars a quarter in, like, fee, you know, from, like, so the exchange like that, that was a business. And, like, the lending ones, you could, like, argue where, I guess, from every, like, less sustainable.
00:26:32.254 - 00:26:42.662, Speaker A: But there. There definitely is, like, a nugget of, like, a real sort of business there. Yeah, to your point. So, like, all right. Somebody will. Somebody will get it right. And I hope they do, because, like, it was.
00:26:42.662 - 00:26:47.354, Speaker A: These were. These were businesses that we leaned on a lot. Like, it's, like, made our lives, like, a lot harder.
00:26:48.414 - 00:26:49.634, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely.
00:26:51.174 - 00:27:02.286, Speaker A: Yeah. And, like, the concentration risk is pretty bad right now in terms of, like, service providers for this stuff. Like, you kind of have to use binance and coinbase. Like, that's it. Like, that's not great. Yeah.
00:27:02.390 - 00:27:08.040, Speaker C: Speaking of Coinbase, like, what do you think about their base launch? And I don't know if you have an opinion there.
00:27:08.182 - 00:27:17.540, Speaker A: I think it's great. I'm probably. I mean, I don't know where it's gonna go. I think everybody's like. I think people are drawing too far out of the future on the whole thing. I think it's a cool project. I think it's smart.
00:27:17.540 - 00:27:35.388, Speaker A: And, like, worst case scenario, they burnt a bunch of time. Like, I don't know. I'm super pro it. I like, like, I don't know where it's gonna go. I'm very curious. So here's the thing that I'm very curious about is, like, what? Like, what is the thing they say they want to, like, eventually drive it to, like, community ownership sort of thing. Right.
00:27:35.388 - 00:27:51.314, Speaker A: So, like, I want to see how they do that as a public company under massive scrutiny, how they, like, actually move something towards, like, decentralization with, like, everybody's eyeballs on them. Right. I think that would be like, a very good tell and I think it'd be great if they can set some precedent for it.
00:27:51.614 - 00:28:19.894, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. It's almost crazy that the day they announced this, like, the stock was down and, like, there's obviously noise, but for, seems like there was a big, like, disconnect here where everyone in crypto was like, okay, this could meaningfully bring a lot of an entirely new line, revenue line for them. And the way they could monetize their user base and being this gateway to web three and then Wall street kind of just didn't appreciate it was like, meh.
00:28:20.234 - 00:28:38.384, Speaker A: Yeah. I think they just look for, like, Coinbase is just so driven by its short term ability to, like, generate revenue right now. Like, I don't think anybody that's, like, serious, like, trading that stock in any, like, size, like you gives a shit about anything years out right now. Like, I think they're just like, very much like a solvency concern for, like, the 18 to 24 months, like, sort of thing.
00:28:38.544 - 00:28:40.688, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess you look at the bonds, you look at. It's very.
00:28:40.736 - 00:28:44.624, Speaker A: Right. Like, look at it from like, this. People aren't giving them a ton of rope.
00:28:44.744 - 00:28:45.760, Speaker C: No, not at all.
00:28:45.832 - 00:28:46.184, Speaker A: Sure.
00:28:46.264 - 00:29:19.184, Speaker C: I am curious if there is a trade there. Like, I've always asked, like, over time, when I look at a new investment opportunity, it's always like, you know, you look, you go to, you look at miners or you look at exchanges like coinbases. Does it outperform ethics? You look at a private company, like, does it outperform the underlying, which is bitcoin or ethereum? And then I'm curious, like, um, if you had, like, a new pool of capital, would you buy Coinbase stock? Would you buy ethereum or bitcoin? Or, like, maybe just like, let's start there.
00:29:19.564 - 00:29:45.634, Speaker A: Yeah. Like, what do you think outperformed? That's a good question. I. I would wager that coinbase would outperform you in bitcoin in a reality at this point. Um, I mean, I also, by the way, I own Coinbase. Just like, it's full disclosure, it's been terrible, but I would wager that would sort of, because if you think about how stuff performs in a rally, right. It's like, we don't have a ton of data points to this, but it's like bitcoin does well and it does a little bit better.
00:29:45.634 - 00:30:08.970, Speaker A: And then the long tail of the assets just goes berserk and stuff goes up 100,000 x, sort of stuff like that. Right. The further you brought the risk curve, more stuff sort of moves out and Coinbase is further out the risk curve. So that would just be my guess. It has positive beta over one to bitcoin and ETH, which is the index at this point. Definitely my guess on it.
00:30:09.122 - 00:30:14.050, Speaker C: Not to mention, if you're a us based investor, you can do much more with Coinbase stock.
00:30:14.242 - 00:30:14.974, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:30:16.794 - 00:30:25.956, Speaker C: It's more useful. You can borrow against it. You could do more stuff that presumably has less counterparty risk than if you want to do some exotic stuff with.
00:30:25.980 - 00:30:27.396, Speaker A: Your ETH or bitcoin.
00:30:27.540 - 00:30:32.188, Speaker B: You think Coinbase is stops using Coinbase stock is further out on the respect from than ETH.
00:30:32.316 - 00:30:34.268, Speaker A: Yeah. What is that?
00:30:34.316 - 00:30:37.144, Speaker C: Your crypto nativeness wouldn't be illusoft.
00:30:37.844 - 00:30:48.736, Speaker A: Oh, that's like a foul. I'm not even, like, I think that should. I mean, like, what is can go bankrupt. You can, like, I mean, like, that's like the difference, Dan, I think.
00:30:48.800 - 00:30:53.480, Speaker C: Is this the, is this your, your the correct answer? Is this the family feud answer?
00:30:53.672 - 00:31:01.000, Speaker A: I. This is the correct answer. I'm. This is like a very few things I don't think I get, like, definitively saying, but, like, factual part of the.
00:31:01.032 - 00:31:01.888, Speaker B: Of the episode.
00:31:01.976 - 00:31:05.184, Speaker A: No, it's. It's like, when you're like, I think.
00:31:05.224 - 00:31:07.564, Speaker B: Traditional investors would disagree with that.
00:31:08.064 - 00:31:18.794, Speaker A: That's fine. I mean, that probably would look, when Coinbase was forex, that probably wasn't a realistic argument. But, like, where it's trading now, I think so, yeah. I don't know.
00:31:18.834 - 00:31:20.334, Speaker C: Would you buy the stock or the bond?
00:31:20.794 - 00:31:23.562, Speaker A: I'd buy the stock, yeah.
00:31:23.658 - 00:31:26.410, Speaker C: Like, sell puts or whatever, and then clip a coupon.
00:31:26.602 - 00:31:29.694, Speaker A: I seem to have a better. If I'm in it, I'm in it to win it.
00:31:30.314 - 00:31:53.924, Speaker B: Dan does this basically all the l two announcements, like, so you like arbitrum's ripping, like, optimism stuff is interesting. Like, Coinbase's base announcement and then, like, you know, dy, like all the. Basically, like, the l two s. Uh, change your view on whether or not people will just, like, pun gigalong on l one s in the next cycle or you think that's just something that happens in cycle.
00:31:54.264 - 00:32:24.734, Speaker A: Um, that's a good question. So this has been like, the. The big one on the hangover is like, will, when demand for, like, smart contracts base heats up. Right. Like, if the base chain fees are $200 for a swap, again, people fall over to optimism and arbitram. Or do they fall over to, like, Solanax? I am still of the opinion that it will flow to the other l one s as people sort of move out the risk curve. But I do think that the other l two s will eat a good chunk of what that volume would have been historically.
00:32:24.734 - 00:32:44.402, Speaker A: That's just how I feel right now. I will see how this actually plays out, but I sort of view the other l two s as l one s. As far as a trade, I don't know. I just kind of treat them very similar. That's my thought on it. I don't know. I feel less strongly about that than I did historically.
00:32:44.578 - 00:32:53.250, Speaker B: Yeah. Do you have a take on an ecosystem that you really like outside of ETH? Do you really like what's happening in Solana or Cosmos or arbitrum?
00:32:53.402 - 00:33:15.712, Speaker A: Yeah, we have a lot of bets in Solana and Avax. That's definitely where we parked, and we do a good amount of work. So those are where we've got the most vested interest and where we spent the most time. That being said, we done a lot in arbitrary man optimism. Now, as a function of our time, it's more. That's probably why I feel less strongly about it.
00:33:15.848 - 00:33:16.564, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:33:18.264 - 00:33:22.320, Speaker C: So from a portfolio construction standpoint, are you sitting on any cash, or are you fully deployed?
00:33:22.432 - 00:33:30.324, Speaker A: We do. We've got probably, I'd say about 15% in cash deployment. Yeah, 15.
00:33:30.964 - 00:33:35.124, Speaker C: Are you holding? Are you comfortable holding on stable coins or in a bank?
00:33:35.164 - 00:33:54.644, Speaker A: No, we haven't. Like, we're in the bank bank right now. Yeah. Like, I check every day to make sure we're still on it, but, yeah. Like, that's, like, everywhere we have it, we do keep something, like stables. Like, we just. Like, I don't know if we don't have to have it at risk, we just, like, don't have it.
00:33:54.644 - 00:33:55.252, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:33:55.388 - 00:34:06.050, Speaker C: Especially because, to me, it's still fascinating, the yields on defi. Like, if you wanted to clip a yield on your stablecoin, you're getting treasuries. Like, it's crazy.
00:34:06.082 - 00:34:10.014, Speaker A: You're absolutely not being paid for the risk. Definitely not. It's not.
00:34:11.074 - 00:34:24.874, Speaker C: So when we talk about risks, one of the things that has been percolating much is this idea of a regulatory clamp down and more pressure. And so I am curious what you think about that. What is kind of your different scenarios and kind.
00:34:24.874 - 00:34:25.198, Speaker A: Kind of.
00:34:25.198 - 00:34:27.674, Speaker C: Of timelines of how this evolves?
00:34:28.814 - 00:34:55.830, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't think we're done. I think there's probably still some in the works. There's probably some, like, I hope it does it, but I'd be, like, shocked if, like, Coinbase comes out this whole thing and, like, didn't get an action of some sort. Right? Like, that seems a little strange. Like. Like, they're doing a lot of the same activity that a lot of the other people are being sort of criticized for. And, like, I don't know the specifics of, like, the legal and, like, all their setups and all that jazz, but, like, I don't know, like, Kraken has a staking program and they're getting hit about it.
00:34:55.830 - 00:35:19.774, Speaker A: And, like Coinbase said, a saving program. And it's not like, I just. I'm like, let's clear that, like, everybody, I don't think the dust is settled. And, like, all right, like, we're on the back half of this. Like, I think this is still an ongoing conversation with a lot of different sort of parties and, like, government agencies. That being said, I think what you're seeing right now is there is. There's a lot of weakness in crypto, right? Like, he's lost a lot of balance sheet.
00:35:19.774 - 00:36:05.294, Speaker A: Like, everybody's, like, doing much worse, like, financially, and regulators are not happy about what's going on, which is fair. Like, there's been a lot of outright, like, criminal activity and, like, if not criminal activity, like, a lot of losses for, like, a lot of people in their jurisdictions. And they're coming in and they're, like, taking off everybody where they can with things that they know. Like, they either can't fight or, like, won't fight. And it's not a terrible strategy from their point of view. I don't like it, but, like, I understand sort of, like, how they're using this to, like, establish precedent and to, like, get their hooks into everybody and make it seem like they're policing what they're supposed to be policing. So, yeah, it's probably going to be in bed for a bit.
00:36:05.294 - 00:36:23.048, Speaker A: I just, like, I don't. It's tough. Like, it gets very hard to operate in the United States. Like, I don't. I don't think it's going to get any easier for the foreseeable future. I mean, there's, like, rumors of, like, a massive finance settlement sort of keep hearing about that's, like, sort of out there. Like, there's clearly a lot of smoke going on with, like, a lot of these, like, different things.
00:36:23.048 - 00:36:53.632, Speaker A: But, um, the stable coin stuff is probably the most egregious, like, overreach I think, that you're seeing out there. Um, but, um, like, that'll hopefully go to court. I do hope that, like, some of the well capitalized players fight this stuff. Right? Like, that's like the only way, like, you can, like, slow it down and like, make your case. Because if you just keep like, rolling over and paying the fines as an industry, like, you just then you're beholden to whatever they like, sort of like, thing, right? Yeah, yeah, exactly. So I do think. I do hope a lot of this stuff, like, which is why I think you do.
00:36:53.632 - 00:37:07.560, Speaker A: It's good to see coinbase in particular has like, the, likes to fight a lot of this stuff. So, like, I do hope that they will serve us are. Right. Correct. Yeah, yeah. Well, like, like, what is circle? If they have a stable coin, that's like a security. Like, it's nothing.
00:37:07.560 - 00:37:20.588, Speaker A: Right? Like, they have to, like, their, their entire, like, their existence like, rests on the concept that that's not true. So they're going to have to take that score. That tells you well, yeah, definitely. Yeah.
00:37:20.636 - 00:38:12.114, Speaker C: It feels to me like I've heard multiple takes here. One of them is like, the SEC really doesn't want to deem all these things securities as much as like, Gensler was out saying that, you know, only bitcoin is kind of not a security because, you know, if you force someone to be a token, like a security issuer, I guess every token issuer register has security. Like, it's a massive like, operational headache overhead that they have to then embark on. And they probably are just better off clipping on, off these, like, operating under this. Not providing guidance tends to be a good strategy because then you're, you just go to pick a player, you go to them and then you get like 20 million, and then you fund like the operating budget for an entire division then and there. And you keep doing that over and over and it's, you know, it's like, oh, I think you want an incentive standpoint. Like, it's not a bad strategy.
00:38:12.114 - 00:38:32.662, Speaker C: Like, is, would it be, the question is, would it be terrible if everything was deemed a security? But if you do that, then, and then do you provide like very clear guidance and procedures for these token issuers to register as securities? Would that be so terrible?
00:38:32.838 - 00:38:55.638, Speaker A: Yes, and here's why. Because I think the knock on effects are like the problem. Right. It's like you can't just like be moving them around like, as like bearer instruments then, right. Like that. It kind of like, fundamentally, like, destroys, like, the value prop, in my opinion. Like, unless they, like, carve out and they're like, all right, like, this is the thing, right? Like, if you force them into the existing box of, like, what securities are, it doesn't, like, work.
00:38:55.638 - 00:39:13.374, Speaker A: But if you, like, make a carve out and you're like, all right, like, these are securities, but they're crypto securities. And we're going to let, like, this sort, like, these, like, things not apply to it. That would be potentially a good outcome. But I think if you try to shoehorn him into the existing box, I think that's actually a real problem.
00:39:14.074 - 00:39:52.324, Speaker C: I definitely agree with you, and there are great threads about token issuers that have gone through this path, and it's like, when you try to shoehorn it, it just doesn't work and it becomes entirely problematic. But, yeah, in a hybrid approach, where you do some modifications. Yeah, in my mind, wouldn't be that bad of an outcome. Just to get clarity, like, how many lp potential lp conversations have you been on over the years? Like, how much capital do you think is sidelined? Because they're like, we at this point, probably a vast majority of players believe in this technology, in the asset class, but are on the sidelines for this particular reason.
00:39:53.224 - 00:40:15.972, Speaker A: I think it's. I think it's a good amount of money, for sure, and I think that leads us into so many open compliance holes. I mean, realistically, I think we're at a point where, like, I think you kind of need Congress to, like, weigh in. Like, it's kind of gotta, like, be their decision. There's just, like, not a lot of appetite to do that. And there's, like, it's not an issue, frankly. Well, you were talking about how important.
00:40:16.028 - 00:40:32.890, Speaker C: Midterms would be, like, in the next election cycle. Like, if your constituent base is really, like, young folks that really, like this stuff, it becomes, like, very good political currency to go out and be, like, pro crypto. When does that happen? Like, how far away are we from.
00:40:32.922 - 00:41:18.938, Speaker A: That, I think, scenario? Yeah, it's just not. But it's just like, it's just, like, not an issue for, like, enough people. You know, it's like, it's definitely like, you could come in, just be like, I'm pro crypto, and then, like, it's okay. That doesn't mean anything, right? You know, like, act on anything else because they conversated their fake. This is just like, tiered ranking order of things that they care about. That is the general public wants to see action on it's so low, and it's even lower now because now it's just like, why are we going to wade into this thing that's just a tire fire, right? It's worse now than it was six months ago. I think that's the drawdown to, like, the aggregate price mean now.
00:41:18.938 - 00:41:25.898, Speaker A: But, like, also just, like, the industry, like, sort of, like, cannibalizing itself is, like, there's less, like, political will to get something done. Yeah.
00:41:25.986 - 00:41:32.762, Speaker C: Perhaps shifting gears, more of a personal question, but if you were to, like, start a font today, would you do it?
00:41:32.898 - 00:41:33.730, Speaker A: No. Given up.
00:41:33.762 - 00:41:36.722, Speaker C: Given all the complexity, even all, like, most people think crypto is easy.
00:41:36.778 - 00:41:37.450, Speaker A: You're like, oh, God.
00:41:37.482 - 00:41:49.510, Speaker C: Like, you know, it's really not. It's very hard. You have to think about and learn about a lot of things, and we don't learn quick enough. You get slapped in the face over and over. And so, yeah, you just answer the question. Like, you wouldn't.
00:41:49.702 - 00:42:32.512, Speaker A: What would you do? Oh, I think I would do it, like, the same way I do it now, but, like, I mean, like, I enjoy what I do. Like, there's no, like, doubt about that, right? Like, I very much. Like, this is, like, the most fun thing you can do in your life. But if you're going to, like, get in a situation where, like, you're raising external capital like these, it is a different thing that I think most people sort of take, and that gives the tack why we haven't, like, gone that way. It's like, if you're managing other people's money and, like, not only, like, the sort of. How do you say this? Like, you obviously have, like, a dedication to, like, doing that, and you, like, have, like, a compliance burden, and you, like, have, like, rules that you have to follow and, like. But girls are just, like, you're taking on all the emotional, like, issues that come with, like, managing sort of external, like, people's money, so.
00:42:32.512 - 00:42:46.650, Speaker A: And it also, like, only makes scale sense of, like, scale. Like, you need to raise a lot. I think, like, people like, this idea of, like, oh, I'm gonna go raise, like, a $15 million fund is like, I do. I think that's, like, the most misguided thing in the world where it's like, no, you're gonna need to at least.
00:42:46.722 - 00:42:49.562, Speaker C: For at least 100 to 150 million.
00:42:49.698 - 00:43:11.830, Speaker A: It's such a bad trade. And people, like, continually go out and, like, try and do it. I don't want to, like, knock anybody, but I want. I want to, like, have them just sit there and, like, do the math. Well, the problem is because they go like, well, they're like, yeah, well, like how it's this thing at night, then there's nothing that can't be a basis. Like, oh, this is gotta look great, but people do it continuously. So you guys explain that.
00:43:11.902 - 00:43:14.454, Speaker B: I didn't fully follow that. Can you explain why that's such a bad idea?
00:43:14.534 - 00:43:25.574, Speaker C: Well, because the overhead of it's just like, it's not like a traditional venture fund. The amount of complexity and fees that you're gonna have to pay service provider to lawyers is much. It's like a multiple.
00:43:25.654 - 00:43:27.566, Speaker A: And you just have employees. You're gonna.
00:43:27.670 - 00:43:31.968, Speaker B: What's that threshold of when it becomes a good idea to have a fundamental.
00:43:32.086 - 00:44:02.216, Speaker A: I can say anything less than 50 doesn't make sense. And even then, you're probably, look, you get, like, if you're like, it tends to be like, if you, like, have a $50 million fund and, like, you're, like, you make no money. Like, sort of like, you pay yourself. Like, you made, like, a wage, but, like, it's a job, and like, that's fine, but, like, it's not like this. Like, and like, yeah, you've got, like, upside on the whole thing, but I don't know, like, I'm less convinced that. And it's only if, like, things, like, go well, right? Like, it may. You can have a situation where you got a $10 million sit on FTX, and now you got a bankruptcy.
00:44:02.216 - 00:44:10.684, Speaker A: You gotta manage five years, right? Like, that's just like a situation. Like, people sort of, there's, there's a lot of unknown unknowns that are all headaches for you. And, like, your light just becomes managing headaches.
00:44:11.104 - 00:44:45.290, Speaker B: Hey, everyone, quick break from empire to tell you about another blockworks channel that I know you're gonna love. I've been in crypto full time for five years and have always struggled with one thing, which is keeping up with the next big trend. As soon as I wrap my head around Mev Ron to appreciate. As soon as I wrap my head around app genes Ron to liquid staking derivatives. I'm sure you've been there. Blockworks Research has solved that problem for me. Our team puts research, data governance proposal, updates, models and more into one really easy to use platform.
00:44:45.290 - 00:45:00.864, Speaker B: So I can always stay ahead of the curve if I don't understand something. For example, I just built the platform. I can search for an L one. I can search for protocol. Pull up the platform of blockhostresearch.com dot I search the term. There's always an amazing amount of insight in a really consumable way.
00:45:00.864 - 00:45:25.216, Speaker B: Right now you can subscribe to the platform. It's $2,500 a year or $900 a quarter. Hopefully you can make more than $208 a month by using the platform. And you can't, you're probably in the wrong business. But if you're not ready to subscribe to the platform today, you can subscribe to the research teams free newsletter. You can follow their twitter handles today, links in the show notes. Trust me, once you do that, you're going to want to subscribe to the platform.
00:45:25.216 - 00:45:39.764, Speaker B: If you are ready to subscribe right now, I got you guys with a little hookup. Empire listeners get a 10% discount for the first 50 people who use the code. Empire Ten got you back. Check out the links in the description to find out more.
00:45:40.144 - 00:45:42.244, Speaker A: Now let's get back to the show.
00:45:45.484 - 00:46:09.984, Speaker C: What about you talked about this. So historically, I think a lot of folks from traditional finance, racial funds have said, oh, wow, I can do a ten x if you're a venture fund, if you look at MVCA data, National Venture Capital association data, if you perform, you would have been in the top quartile of a venture fund if you returned three x to your investors. Something like this.
00:46:10.104 - 00:46:10.704, Speaker B: Yeah, it does.
00:46:10.784 - 00:46:53.224, Speaker C: Obviously, like, as an asset class matures, like, it gets more competitive and returns come down. If you were the first private equity fund, you did a ten x plus. Where do you think crypto is in that trajectory? Like, for the new cohort of funds it raised, like, last year? Huge funds like these are billion dollar funds. Han vent. Like, Katie Han's fund, a 16 z. A lot of these funds are sitting on billions of dollars. You talk about scale and size, but if you've been in the space for such a long time, you're sort of been preconditioned that anything less than a ten x is a mediocre return, which is crazy.
00:46:53.224 - 00:47:02.704, Speaker C: Do you ever adjust your mental frameworks? Where do you think the next 510 years? What is the actual return potential of this asset class?
00:47:03.754 - 00:47:25.586, Speaker A: If you're just indexing it, like, I don't know, probably like four to five x? Like, I'd have that. Probably. Like, I mean, if you're putting in, like, free coin ETH, it's probably then, like two to three x. Like, I think you just, like, keep, like, chopping it. Like, I don't know, I don't like baseline assumptions of, like, the major assets anymore. Sort of on ten x. Like, if you're out there, like, firing into, like, the cutting edge or stuff, and like, you're willing to, like, take massive drawdowns.
00:47:25.586 - 00:47:40.054, Speaker A: Like, yeah, you can definitely, like, get there, but, like, I don't know. Just, like, it's an index, like, sort of product of, like, I don't know. Because it's kind of, like, what, a 16 z.com, right? Like, they're. Yeah, they're getting crypto exposure to everything in anything. I don't know, they sort of. My.
00:47:40.394 - 00:47:50.010, Speaker C: Like, if they were an ETF, like, you're better off putting ETF than just paying 220 on a $2 billion fund. You're gonna index the market.
00:47:50.162 - 00:47:53.026, Speaker A: There's just. No, just my percent. Yeah. Right. That's the thing.
00:47:53.130 - 00:47:58.300, Speaker C: Correct, correct. Which is there's scarcity value in those. So people get pushed to these vehicles.
00:47:58.452 - 00:47:58.740, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:47:58.772 - 00:48:23.028, Speaker C: So basically what you're saying. So crypto, a lot of what we talk about on the podcast is, like, the aggregate market cap as an asset class. You know, you're at a trillion. You've been hovering around that level for a bit, chopping around that. You know, you're fundamentally saying that, like, you're getting to, like, maybe 5 trillion over the next three to five years. You know, assuming, like, the bitcoin e two, like two and a half, three x. And then.
00:48:23.028 - 00:48:37.028, Speaker C: And then the ratio of altcoins at some point grows over time. Maybe new verticals, nfts, whatever. Nft. The next thing that is not nfts encompasses some share. So is that. Is that a fair kind of mental model that you have, like, 5 trillion?
00:48:37.196 - 00:48:45.252, Speaker A: Yeah, I think you go higher than the previous hide, but, like, less hide each time in percentage terms, which, by.
00:48:45.268 - 00:48:47.308, Speaker C: The way, would still be a huge fuck.
00:48:47.356 - 00:48:49.284, Speaker A: It's a ton. It's funny.
00:48:49.324 - 00:48:57.694, Speaker C: It's funny you say that, because, like, when I tell people, like, the bullish cases, like, 5 trillion is a speck of dust for an asset class.
00:48:58.514 - 00:48:59.746, Speaker A: Like the Internet.
00:48:59.810 - 00:49:01.306, Speaker C: Like, I get it.
00:49:01.330 - 00:49:01.562, Speaker A: Right?
00:49:01.618 - 00:49:03.174, Speaker C: Like, I know you're laughing.
00:49:06.434 - 00:49:06.842, Speaker A: But it's.
00:49:06.858 - 00:49:07.794, Speaker C: Still a lot of money.
00:49:07.914 - 00:49:14.850, Speaker A: The global M two GDP figure that, like, people put in, like, yeah, it's a pretty big. It's like.
00:49:15.002 - 00:49:34.574, Speaker C: It's like, don't get me wrong. It's a massive number, but I guess it forces you to invert and say, like, which is where a lot of people are really questioning it, especially in bear markets, is what's the whole point of this movement? What's the killer use case? What's the enduring, lasting value here that you're delivering?
00:49:35.154 - 00:49:38.974, Speaker A: I mean, the picture's always been, are you building a financial system outside the financial system?
00:49:39.754 - 00:49:52.214, Speaker C: Yeah, that's programmable money, minimizing counterparty risk, transferring value on the Internet without counterparty. It seems like a killer use case to me. And it seems like a far bigger market than 5 trillion.
00:49:53.394 - 00:50:20.800, Speaker A: All right, so here I just looked up because I was like, the current. So NYSE has 23 trillion of assets as the end of the year. Like, that's the market cap of it. Would you rather own crypto or quarter of all the stocks? Not all the stocks, but all the NYSE stocks. I don't know. That's like, there's a lot of companies making a lot of banks. I would, I would take the stocks.
00:50:20.832 - 00:50:30.080, Speaker C: Because of the correlation risk. Why attack, you know, but, yeah, 50.
00:50:30.152 - 00:50:32.644, Speaker A: Years, like, anybody, anybody's game.
00:50:34.144 - 00:51:01.974, Speaker C: The other argument you could make is, so a lot of you have a lot of tokens now. So, like, I was having this discussion with another person, like, it was like. And a lot of the best investors would tell you, like, the best strategy is just buy the index. Like, buy the S P, because, like, the s and P, the composition of the S P is constantly rebalancing. And so you didn't have to be right about AI, you don't have to be right about technology, software as a service, none of this stuff. But if you just had, like, a broad based exposure, you would have captured that growth.
00:51:02.094 - 00:51:03.598, Speaker A: Right. Because it moves in.
00:51:03.726 - 00:51:27.074, Speaker C: The question is, are you going to get that crypto, the same phenomenon that have tech becoming a much larger slice of the index? Is that going to happen for crypto, or is crypto going to continue to operate outside of. Because right now, the only kind of exposure you can get to crypto on the public side is coinbase and a few other names. But that's not a lot.
00:51:28.014 - 00:51:35.082, Speaker A: Yeah, no, it's. There it is outside of it a lot more. No. Do you think it ever, like, how.
00:51:35.098 - 00:51:38.746, Speaker C: Many public crypto companies do you think we're going to see in the next five years?
00:51:38.890 - 00:51:39.666, Speaker A: We've.
00:51:39.850 - 00:51:40.834, Speaker C: Anchorage.
00:51:40.994 - 00:51:51.894, Speaker A: Yeah, there. I mean, realistically, there should be like a dozen now, but like that. That's a whole other conversation. But, yeah, I think you're looking like, I don't know, for $5 trillion, there should be 25 public companies that have value.
00:51:53.474 - 00:51:54.214, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:51:54.714 - 00:51:59.798, Speaker A: But it's kind of wild if you think about how few there are and how big some of these businesses are.
00:51:59.926 - 00:52:05.834, Speaker C: It almost seems to me like if that scenario doesn't play out, then crypto is not going anywhere.
00:52:06.254 - 00:52:11.994, Speaker A: Probably not. Yeah, it definitely makes it slower, for sure.
00:52:13.814 - 00:52:23.314, Speaker C: Yeah. I guess I'm not as familiar, but so you're just managing your own prop capital or do you have outside investors?
00:52:23.754 - 00:52:29.602, Speaker A: Right. We're just managing our own. So it's like, I mean, it's a partnership effectively, like, in which manage the partners sort of funds.
00:52:29.738 - 00:52:35.134, Speaker C: Yeah, that makes sense. I'm curious if you like talking to other managers, like, what's the sentiment out there?
00:52:35.914 - 00:53:03.204, Speaker A: It depends how you've done. That's right. It depends how tied in any of these, like, bankruptcies you are. I think a lot, there's a lot of guys that you're in a situation where, like, I think they're the, so look, there's two worlds. There's some people that launched and, like, just didn't deploy a ton and, like, earn a really good spot where they have, like, a lot of, like, effectively, like, capital that they can still deploy over the next year. They feel great about things, right. Because they can, like, average in much lower and just sort of everything.
00:53:03.204 - 00:53:25.324, Speaker A: And that's either venture or liquid. But, like, that's, that's the conversation mostly for, like, more the venture guys. Um, so the pace of, like, how they deployed, like, very much so. The people that have money to deploy feel great. They're like, this is awesome. Like, we're getting in arguably, like, evaluations, third or half of what we were thinking we would be getting them in at. So these people feel great about certain stuff.
00:53:25.324 - 00:54:10.904, Speaker A: People that are too deployed and they're down a pretty good drawdown are in a weird spot where I think they have to start thinking about whether or not the econ makes sense to continue doing it. So I think those people are in a rough spot. I would say that's probably a quarter of all the funds that are out there right now, where you definitely get to a point where you look and you're like, all right, if you just for easy myth, you raise 100 million, you're down 75%. You're at 25, you've got a forex that thing to get flat. You're not making any money until you forex it. And if you're a rational person, you're like, is this really what I should be doing? So I think some of those probably those funds are kind of dead, whether or not they know it or not. And they're figuring out what they do sort of on that side.
00:54:10.904 - 00:54:20.716, Speaker A: But a lot of people with, like, dry powder that can and are, like, doing things over time, like, they feel great about, so to speak. So it really is a conversation. It's the whole span of stuff.
00:54:20.860 - 00:54:42.304, Speaker C: Cause what you said, I think, is really important. That I, perhaps some people don't appreciate. But, like, this high watermark concept, like, if you're down and like, if you're like a new allocator into the space, so say you want to put on risk. We're in this environment again, and you have two managers. One is a new fundamental. The other one is a fund that has a huge high water mark. Who are you going to give money to?
00:54:43.044 - 00:54:44.900, Speaker A: Of course, there's other variables, but a.
00:54:44.932 - 00:55:15.844, Speaker C: Big part of me, if I'm, if I'm in that seat, I'm just thinking through the psychology and the pressure of that manager that has a huge high water mark and other capital that needs to clear the bar on, he's probably going to be more inclined to take stupid, outsized risk versus the other manager that has like, a clean slate. And so it becomes like this death spiral of a fund that is in a tight spot. And you saw in traditional markets, it's fairly common. What was that guy that was bet against the meme stocks?
00:55:17.144 - 00:55:17.664, Speaker A: Maverick?
00:55:17.704 - 00:55:18.884, Speaker C: Was it Maverick Capital?
00:55:19.344 - 00:55:19.848, Speaker A: Melvin.
00:55:19.896 - 00:55:20.288, Speaker B: Melvin.
00:55:20.336 - 00:55:21.568, Speaker A: Melvin. Melvin. Melvin.
00:55:21.616 - 00:55:32.938, Speaker C: So the guy closed shop because the incentive, you just kind of realized, to your point, it's really hard, and somehow the market has a short term memory and the guy's probably going to raise capital at some other point.
00:55:33.026 - 00:55:50.574, Speaker A: But I think he did a long only fund and then got banged on meta. I actually think that is like a one, two. But no, you're right. The math, it starts at mix and especially in crypto, because the funds are so small. You're working on razor thin sort of margins as it is.
00:55:51.234 - 00:56:06.644, Speaker C: And tack on top of that, that if you actually don't believe that we're going to have another of, you know, ten x plus outcome for something like ethereum, then it becomes extremely hard to clear the high watermark for many funds out there.
00:56:07.184 - 00:56:13.496, Speaker A: Right? Yeah, I mean, 75 you, ten x, the fund you like, effectively made like 2.5 extra money or something like that, right?
00:56:13.520 - 00:56:25.672, Speaker C: Yeah, because in the last. Yeah, because in the last cycle, there were a few funds that kind of were able to survive this, this, like water, high water mark, despair. Like things like block tower, they're all.
00:56:25.808 - 00:56:26.672, Speaker A: Came out of it.
00:56:26.768 - 00:56:37.800, Speaker C: Multicoin, you know, and like for multicombs, like Solana was a huge, like, kind of like saving grace, helium, a few other bets, but the graph, but nonetheless. Yeah, it's interesting dynamic.
00:56:37.832 - 00:56:39.176, Speaker A: Do you have you.
00:56:39.360 - 00:56:40.720, Speaker C: Yeah, it's hard.
00:56:40.872 - 00:56:56.944, Speaker A: It's just, it's harder now because the numbers have to get actually so big. Right. Like, you're not going from like 100 billion to a trillion to market cap. You're going from 1 trillion to 10 trillion like this. I don't know. It's just the law of large numbers, right?
00:56:57.924 - 00:57:24.824, Speaker C: Yeah. What do you think is the, just on this point, what do you think is the sweet spot for a fund in traditional venture like benchmark? In my estimation, probably has been the best performing venture fund out there, but they've always kept their font size the same. 250 million. I think they've never raised more than that. And then you have an Andreessen who's become more of a, you know, asset aggregator, raising billions and billions of dollars. You're wondering if they're playing a 2% game or a 20% game at that point.
00:57:24.984 - 00:57:40.320, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, the 50 to 100 range seems kind of if you keep the team small. If you're going to do stuff in liquid though, I'd raise a ton because I don't know, you can just like, you can scale a lot of it. Yeah, yeah.
00:57:40.352 - 00:57:45.606, Speaker C: You could buy like easily a couple hundred million dollars. ETH and bitcoin just. Yeah, top ten.
00:57:45.630 - 00:57:46.674, Speaker A: He proves on it.
00:57:49.694 - 00:57:55.074, Speaker B: Being on the liquid side of things. How are, how are you guys thinking about the LSD trade right now? And like Shanghai and March?
00:57:55.454 - 00:58:34.856, Speaker A: Yeah, so actually there's a guy who works here at Quonec, but he's Twitter, CMS Perry, who wrote like a really long thing up about CMS Perry. Yeah, he's got a substac where he wrote a really good thing about like a whole thesis that I would say here. I'll say like, CMS's thesis on it is like what he wrote. So I would like deferring and sort of hints them on it. But I mean, he's, he's been very build up on Lido and racquetball. I think that artifacts about racquetball for a certain bit now. I mean, it's like one of the few things where you can like, see like the clear, like, product market fit and like the real, like, in the generation of actual, like, revenue or p and l or whatever how you want to call it.
00:58:34.856 - 00:58:46.270, Speaker A: Right? Like there's actual, like, economic, like, activity occurring back. So I think it's a very easy one to get to logically. So my answer is. I don't know enough about what our answer is.
00:58:46.462 - 00:58:54.966, Speaker B: Yeah, fair. We'll link to this article. Do you have any take on how you expect withdrawals or price action to play out around Shanghai?
00:58:55.150 - 00:59:11.340, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm of the opinion that supply is probably not good to try. So I don't know. There's probably some jump on it. Yeah, I think it'd be all right. It's not going to be the end of the world. They come out and you're like, boyish and just like, I love how Dan.
00:59:11.372 - 00:59:19.980, Speaker C: Just, I love Dan. Just make it, like, super simple. Like, responses to a lot of, like, things that people over intellectualize. Guys.
00:59:20.052 - 00:59:21.036, Speaker A: It's more supply.
00:59:21.100 - 00:59:22.484, Speaker C: Like, I mean, like, the fair.
00:59:22.524 - 00:59:22.780, Speaker A: The fair.
00:59:22.812 - 00:59:25.372, Speaker C: Even though that's, like, how much of that's actually priced in already, but fair.
00:59:25.428 - 00:59:30.156, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, like, fair, but still, like, I don't know. Like, do you, do you generally think.
00:59:30.180 - 00:59:37.054, Speaker C: That crypto markets are becoming more efficient or, like, things, like, are just not. Like, they're just not priced in or they're fully priced in.
00:59:37.094 - 00:59:39.350, Speaker A: Like, I don't think this keeps coming.
00:59:39.382 - 00:59:44.470, Speaker C: Up in, like, the bitcoin happening events. Like, it's always, like. No, like, it's never priced in, like, right.
00:59:44.542 - 00:59:57.430, Speaker A: Three months later, it doubles. Yeah, I. The assumption that, like, it's the least efficient market still on the planet. Like, I mean, life is why you're here. Yeah. Part of the big thing. Like, I don't know what I mean.
00:59:57.430 - 01:00:24.978, Speaker A: Like, you generally have a primarily retail driven worldwide market that treats a lot of this like a casino. And, like, you get sort of irrational activity to that. I think. Like, one of the big things that, like, people who come from chadfi, that, like, come into this, like, market, like, make the mistake of is like, they're overly rational, sort of in their expectations of what things do, and they leave, like, a lot of money on the table. I don't know.
01:00:25.106 - 01:00:40.884, Speaker C: You think you have a great. I'll always attribute. Yeah, I'll always attribute with one of the greatest quotes I've heard. I mean, you guys produce some of the best memes out there, but some, perhaps the best quote is, do you want to be right or do you want to make money and. Yeah, well, so true.
01:00:41.004 - 01:00:51.916, Speaker A: It's supposed to be. That's. Yeah, and the whole idea is like, don't, don't. Like, I don't know, the market sending something. Like, don't fight it. Like, it. You probably even, you don't understand what's going on.
01:00:51.916 - 01:00:54.660, Speaker A: Like, your, it is what momentum trading.
01:00:54.732 - 01:00:58.632, Speaker C: Or reflexivity or whatever you want to call it. It's worked well for you in crypto.
01:00:58.748 - 01:01:01.184, Speaker A: This is also why we don't go short anything for the most part.
01:01:01.264 - 01:01:02.000, Speaker C: I was gonna ask.
01:01:02.072 - 01:01:19.192, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. It's just because. It's just because, plus, there's no borrow. Well, now it's now it's like, super hard. Yeah. Now, like, you can't actually even, like, structurally do it if you want to, but just, like, also just because, like, things will act with, like, such a rationality to the upside and just, like, you can't have that tail wrist sitting around forever, like. Yeah.
01:01:19.192 - 01:01:30.748, Speaker A: I don't know. Like, how many people blow themselves up because they're, like, short something they're considered has no value. And it's like. Like, why even take the bed? I don't. Maybe some people do. Some people are much better at it and I leave it up to them. I don't.
01:01:30.748 - 01:01:32.024, Speaker A: I don't parlay in it.
01:01:33.244 - 01:01:46.524, Speaker C: Well, it's been a fascinating discussion. I don't know if there's anything else you want to cover that there's on your mind or that your team is kind of actively looking at and share. Want to share some alpha with their listeners?
01:01:46.644 - 01:01:51.244, Speaker A: No. Well, I'll plug the plug in sub stack one a lot of time into it.
01:01:51.284 - 01:01:52.968, Speaker B: Yeah, we'll link to that sub stack article.
01:01:53.116 - 01:01:53.844, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:01:54.784 - 01:01:58.364, Speaker B: Dan, who makes your end of year meme video?
01:01:59.224 - 01:02:02.584, Speaker A: Oh, Kevin does. The end legend. Yeah, he's great.
01:02:02.624 - 01:02:06.224, Speaker B: How you, like, must take him a month to put that thing together.
01:02:06.384 - 01:02:18.684, Speaker A: I think he starts around, like, early December, like, sort of, but he leaves it open in case, like, stuff happened. This one was tough because a lot of the activity was, like, crammed in over. Yeah. So you had to, like, get it in.
01:02:19.384 - 01:02:33.544, Speaker C: If you ever, like, go. This individual, please tell him to open a gatecoin grant because we as an industry should never lose the prowess that your organization produces, which is fundamentally important for this industry.
01:02:33.704 - 01:02:40.764, Speaker A: He's never had a real job. He won't. There's no way. Don't worry. Yeah.
01:02:41.224 - 01:02:49.454, Speaker B: Nice. Well, appreciate you sharing your thoughts on the market and funds and all that kind of good stuff with us, Ma.
