00:00:02.880 - 00:00:21.462, Speaker A: Welcome back, everyone. Really excited. We have a repeat guest. Jesse. Welcome back. We ended the first episode that we recorded on bass. We said we're probably going to have you really soon, because I had the feeling that things were going to move really quickly, and here we are.
00:00:21.462 - 00:00:29.292, Speaker A: So much has happened in bass, but there's also so many questions that I have based on what has happened. So, anyways, welcome back. Really great to have you.
00:00:29.468 - 00:00:31.516, Speaker B: Thanks for having me. Super excited to be here.
00:00:31.700 - 00:00:42.420, Speaker A: Just for anyone that's listening for the first time, could you just give a little bit of background on yourself, what you've been doing at Coinbase and just base, like a one two minute intro for everyone's background?
00:00:42.572 - 00:01:12.818, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. So base is an Ethereum L2 blockchain. It's built to bring the next million builders, the next billion users on chain. It's incubating inside of Coinbase and then gradually decentralizing over the next few years. In terms of my background, I've been in the Coinbase orbit for the last almost seven years. I came in through an acquisition of a company I founded in early 2013 and then joined Coinbase. Like 2017, I led all of our consumer facing products on the engineering side for four and a half years.
00:01:12.818 - 00:02:23.578, Speaker B: So Coinbase, Coinbase Pro, Coinbase Wallet. And then starting in mid late 2021, I took a step back from that role and took on a new challenge, which was figure out how to bring the business chain. Coinbase was started in 2012, before smart contracts existed, before Ethereum existed, and much of our business has been centralized custodial for the longest time, even as we provided that gateway for people to buy their first crypto. But then just in the last few years, with products like USDC and Cbeth and Coinbase Wallet, we've started to build more, what I would call natively on chain products that use smart contracts, that are global by default, that are running on this incredibly powerful next generation platform for the Internet. And we said, hey, how do we move from having 10% of our product portfolio beyond chain to having 100% of our product portfolio beyond chain over the next decade? And that became my challenge. We iterated through a bunch of different approaches for that and ultimately realized that in order to make that transformation, we needed a platform. We need a developer platform where we could build those use cases, where we could reimplement some of the products that we had in this new kind of infrastructure.
00:02:23.578 - 00:02:42.722, Speaker B: And we felt like if we needed that, then likely the rest of the world needed it too. And so thus began base. We launched the testnet in February we opened the mainnet up for developers in kind of early mid July, we just opened up bridging, which basically means folks can start bringing in their funds. I think we've already seen something like.
00:02:42.818 - 00:02:44.706, Speaker A: 120, over 100 million, right?
00:02:44.810 - 00:02:51.846, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. I was just looking this morning, it was like 120 million of Ethereum bridged in, tons of activity, tons of excitement.
00:02:51.910 - 00:02:54.926, Speaker A: Uniswap deployed, sushi deployed, so many apps deployed.
00:02:54.990 - 00:03:17.860, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, we got some. It's going to come together on Wednesday. And so Wednesday is the public launcher today, if you're listening, today is the public launch on the 9th and we're kicking off on chain summer. Although on chain summer has really been going for a long time, we're just joining the party and we're excited to kind of help bring the next billion people on chain. That's really our goal.
00:03:18.012 - 00:04:05.726, Speaker A: What's really exciting is of course, over so many years since Ethereum really existed and since DeFi started, there's been a whole suite of applications, whether it's DeFi, whether it's NFT platforms that have existed on chain, but when you look at across a number of parameters and KPI's, the users are just not there. There's just still a lot of friction to join these. Your mom and pop can't really just go on chain. And so how do you think about your existing user base that is very familiar with. I mean, Coinbase is synonymous, at least in my mind, with crypto in the US and maybe other places. If you're a normal user, what is the experience for that user to then interact on chain through base?
00:04:05.870 - 00:04:48.814, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Well, I think historically for the last few years, what it's been is it's been a pretty complicated process where you say, hey, I want to use this on chain product application. Then you need to get a wallet, you need to fund that wallet, you need get ethereum to the right place. You need to pick what the right place is. Do you want to use this on XYZ chain or another one? That whole process can take minutes. It can take hours if you're relatively unsophisticated. As we've been starting to build base and thinking about how do we get that next wave of adoption, I think our goal has been to make it so anyone can go from zero to doing something meaningful in less than 60 seconds on chain.
00:04:48.814 - 00:05:24.672, Speaker B: And so that's going from having no wallet and scanning a QR code to having a funded wallet that can transact to buy your favorite on chain song or sign up for an on chain restaurant pass or participate in on chain community. And all of that can happen in less than 60 seconds, in a few taps. And I think with the launch of base, we're going to be. We're going to be there, we're going to be at that. From a starting point perspective, there's obviously a ton more work that we need to do in order to get that even lower to make the experience even better, even smoother. Inevitably there's going to be bugs. But I think that's really the North Star.
00:05:24.672 - 00:05:37.806, Speaker B: It's how do we take away all of the complex decisions that one needs to make, and one has to make about where they use these apps and how they get funding in their wallet, and instead just make it dead simple so that billions of people come on chain?
00:05:37.910 - 00:05:59.686, Speaker A: Is it fair to say that, will the user realize that he's going on chain? Or will it just be such a seamless experience where it almost feels like you're still part of the Coinbase like UI Ux, and it's so familiar, but there's a whole set of security kind of things that need to happen in the background. So how will that flow look like?
00:05:59.830 - 00:07:08.334, Speaker B: I think that it's going to end up being a mix of managed experiences that are incredibly simple and then more diverse, kind of rich browser base. It's not really possible to just curate and create first party experiences for every product. And that was really one of our insights with base was historically, Coinbase is really focused on building first party experiences. We have a first party debit card, we have a first party borrow product, we have a first party centralized trading experience. But I think as we looked at what was required to bring the next billion people on chain, what we saw was, well, that's going to require millions of apps, it's going to require tons of things that maybe we can't even predict. And if we want those things to thrive, we need to figure out how do we actually create a platform for those things to be built, but then how do we also integrate that platform into our consumer experiences so people can use them? And so I think it's going to end up being kind of that mix where we do have some of those kind of highly integrated first party experiences, but a lot, a lot of our focus is on empowering developers and letting everyday people use these incredible products that are starting to be built on chain.
00:07:09.514 - 00:07:44.978, Speaker A: And this is where I want to go, actually, as a continuation to that statement, how opinionated will you be around the type of applications and the type of services that deploy on base, I mean, obviously, the extreme of this is like the App Store and Apple, which is super controlled, and they extract a lot of rent and they just are very restrictive at times, and it's a monopoly. And so where in that continuum will you be and how opinionated will you be on the type of things that the user can and the type of apps that the user can interact with?
00:07:45.146 - 00:08:27.860, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. When we look at the next generation of the Internet, which we think is being built on chain, I think we believe that it should be open and that it should be permissionless and that it should be a place where there's no kind of like single party that's curating or controlling or dictating what can and can't be done. And so base is open and permissionless people will be able to put anything on there. You'll be able to build dapps of all kinds. I think there's a balance that we're going to need to strike between base and Coinbase. Right. I think base is going to be kind of this open, permissionless experimentation ground that supports creativity, that supports innovation, that enables kind of a thousand flowers to bloom.
00:08:27.860 - 00:09:20.314, Speaker B: I think that's going to be the role of Coinbase and other folks who are building interfaces for everyday folks on top of base to help build tools and services that allow folks to distinguish which of those flowers do we want to smell versus not. We already have been building this on Coinbase. If you go to Coinbase product, you'll see dapps, you'll see ratings and reviews, you'll see kind of warnings if you try and interact with something that's high risk. And so I think that balance is really how we think about it. It's like base, open and permissionless, because that's what enables the global on chain economy. That's what enables kind of the most innovation, Coinbase, more curatorial, more kind of focused on providing a trusted experience and ensuring that the products and apps that we show to our customers are really ones that they know they can interact with with confidence.
00:09:20.474 - 00:09:44.122, Speaker A: Would it, would it be fair to say, like, you can use Google search and you can enable, like, safe browsing and some permissions? Would that be a good analogy in terms of if you're going through Coinbase itself and interacting and entering base, you may just see kind of like a curated, validated review, kind of peer reviewed apps that are deemed safe to interact and certain extent.
00:09:44.298 - 00:10:10.844, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that that's a great. I think that's a great analogy. I may not say like, it's going to be all the way to safe browsing. You can use Google with safe browsing and not safe browsing. You can be able to use Coinbase with safe browsing and not safe browsing. I'd say the analogy is like the Internet and Google, where it's like the Internet and Google safe browsing, where base is going to be like the Internet. Whether you find in Google or not, the Internet is chaotic and diverse and uncontrollable.
00:10:10.844 - 00:10:23.422, Speaker B: And then folks like Google or Facebook or Twitter, whoever it is, do really try and build experiences that, you know, do not direct users intentionally to kind of the more risky parts of that.
00:10:23.518 - 00:10:37.246, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, let's talk about a little bit about the bridge. Obviously, that's opening up. We're recording on the 7th, it's opening on the 9th. So let's talk a little bit about that. Like what do you. What are the ways to bridge? Why don't we start there?
00:10:37.390 - 00:11:11.314, Speaker B: Yep. And we actually opened the bridge last week. So we opened the bridge on the third and then the main kind of opens for everything and everyone on the 9th. The reason why we did this two phased approach, and really it's been a three phased approach, is we're trying to just be incredibly deliberate in how we rolled out this network. This is the first time you've ever had a large public company build a decentralized open blockchain. And it's the first time that many of our users are going to be exposed to this. And so ensuring that we move in a really thoughtful, measured approach felt really important to us.
00:11:11.314 - 00:11:34.782, Speaker B: Like I mentioned on July 13, we opened it up for developers. That meant that folks could start building apps on base, they could start deploying smart contracts, infrastructure providers could start getting stood up. We then gave them kind of a few weeks, basically to get going, to get the first wave of application started. Then we opened it up for bridging last Thursday. There's a bunch of different ways you can bridge. You can go to bridge dot base.org, comma.
00:11:34.782 - 00:12:08.510, Speaker B: That'll let you bridge ethereum, it'll let you bridge USDC, it'll let you bridge other assets. You can also go to onchainsummer XYZ. That's kind of the landing page for on chain summer, which is all this incredible activity that's happening on chain this summer. We're doing a little curating there to give people one thing every day that they can do on chain that's going to make their life better, bring them joy, make them laugh, and there's a bridge experience there that enables you to just quickly bring ETH over to get ready for that. That's a really cool one. That's probably my favorite one. Very interactive.
00:12:08.510 - 00:12:46.462, Speaker B: You get to feel like you're teleporting to the next generation of the Internet. Then we've also seen a bunch of third party folks build bridging interfaces. There's a product called Mint Fun. You can mint an NFT on Ethereum there and it will automatically give you some Ethereum on base. I think that's really cool. That's a really fun user experience where you both get a new on chain piece of art and you bridge funds to this new world. Then we've seen folks like Galaxy and layer three also build more, more hands on guided tours, where it's like, here are these steps that you take to bridge your first ethereum to base.
00:12:46.462 - 00:13:21.288, Speaker B: And so the reason why we went broad in enabling bridging experience is we want to reach as many people as possible. Well, again, our goal is to bring a billion people on chain. And so some folks are going to be really interested in doing that through the consumer experience that feels like on chain summer. Some are going to be more interested in doing it through like a dedicated NFT experience, like mint fun. Some want the like, maximally powerful bridge interface that lets you kind of configure everything and feel like you're really in control. And so making sure that we're widening that aperture and bringing as many people in as possible felt really important to us.
00:13:21.456 - 00:14:06.864, Speaker A: And for, like, the perhaps uninitiated listener, it's important to talk about bridges, because one part of the equation is moving a lot of the apps that already exist, Ethereum and various l two s. I mean, you're built on the op optimism stack. So. But not only that, but just if you're interacting in Ethereum l one or any other l two, or perhaps other l one s, then you can bridge your assets to interact and base. Talk a little bit about the developer experience. There's a whole host of apps that already exist out there. How easy is it for them? Or how easy has it been based on what you've observed the last month for them to deploy on base?
00:14:07.204 - 00:14:48.720, Speaker B: Yeah, incredibly easy. Base is EVM equivalent, which means that you can literally run the same apps you're running on Ethereum on base. And so as we've gone out to folks, for most folks, it's been, oh, this is really straightforward. I was just talking to someone last night. I was like, hey, we've been seeing a lot of demand for the piece of the infrastructure that you guys are building and they're like, oh, we'll just deploy it tonight, deploy it tonight. And now it's available on base. I think that this is superpower of what's happening in Ethereum right now and happening with the op stack and happening with the EVM, which is that when you have standardized technology, you can move more quickly to build out these ecosystems base.
00:14:48.720 - 00:15:39.842, Speaker B: We will go from zero, nothing on the blockchain to more than 100 dapps, which is, that's what we're going to get to announce on Wednesday. More than 100 apps that are live with more coming. And this incredible on chain summer experience where every day there's going to be something. And if you think about that speed, that's incredibly fast to do all of that in a month, to get all these pieces of social infrastructure and financial infrastructure and media infrastructure and have experiences that people can actually interact with right at the beginning of the birth of this new ecosystem, I think that that is a testament to EVM. It's a testament to Ethereum. It feels a little bit like a magic trick, but it is really over. The result, almost seven years of hard work building this infrastructure and getting it ready for this next phase.
00:15:39.978 - 00:16:19.882, Speaker A: What do you think about the next 612 months look like? You can certainly have a lot of existing users and apps bridge into base, but I think the more skeptical person would say, well, that's not a lot in terms of users. What do you think the composition looks like for really the new users that have never interacted on chain? And where do you think they're going to gravitate to, which kind of apps and kind of the retention and the engagement that you're going to see on base versus maybe other l one s or l two s that just haven't seen that continued engagement, you know what I mean? It sort of drops off pretty dramatically.
00:16:20.078 - 00:17:23.684, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, well, I hear that. Although also say if you look at the number of transactions and number of transacting users on l two s over the last year, it's basically just like up into the right, like looking at l two beat, look at TVL, you look at activity, you look at unique transaction users. We're consistently growing pretty much month over month across the whole l two ecosystem. And so like, my general feeling is we've started the growth curve for adoption that will not stop until the entire world is on chain. And so the next two years are going to be that growth curve accelerating and that acceleration being driven by more real use cases that aren't just speculation, aren't just financial, but that actually provide kind of real value to folks every day. And so, you know, when it comes to base, I think a lot of what we're interested and focused on is kind of like consumer products and consumer use cases. So ones that come top mind to me is we have parallel, which is, you know, really an incredible gaming studio that's built a trading card game that's fully on chain.
00:17:23.684 - 00:17:59.470, Speaker B: They're also building a full AI powered MMO RPG called Colony, and they're building it all on base. And so that's going to be this kind of entry point for folks who are really into gaming to come on chain and then do a ton of exploring from there. We have Blackbird building on base that is founded by Ben Leventhal, who created iter and Resi. And he's back for a third one, building a fully on chain restaurant kind of subscription and loyalty platform. The experience is crazy. You know, you like walk in, you tap your phone at the restaurant, they instantly know who you are, they handle your bill. It's all handled through the app.
00:17:59.470 - 00:18:43.434, Speaker B: You can sit down, walk away whenever you want. They bring you special things. I think these kinds of experiences that are uniquely enabled by this new on chain platform, but are, again, not just speculation, they're actually real world utility. I think that's what's going to bring this next wave of users over the next couple of years that will be more sticky, that will show the world, whoa, this is this incredibly powerful platform, kind of like the dawn of the Internet that's starting to take shape, that is going to onboard billions of people over the next decade. And so that's what we're excited about. Obviously, the financial stuff will come too. USDC is a huge part of our strategy.
00:18:43.434 - 00:18:53.294, Speaker B: Those pieces are coming, but I think we think we need it all. We think we need all those pieces to bring in the diversity of ecosystem that's going to really enable us to grow.
00:18:53.834 - 00:19:16.846, Speaker A: That's really interesting. The restaurant reservation, for instance, is really cool because everything, it's very integrated. You have seamless checkout with USDC, which user would already have. You get the points. Maybe you have an NFT tied to that loyalty for that particular restaurant. Every time you go, you get a different NFT. So all that seems great.
00:19:16.846 - 00:19:39.518, Speaker A: What about the privacy of that? If you're a user and you end up going to say one restaurant, but then you go to other restaurants, that restaurant might be able to see your entire purchasing behavior and interactions, and that poses some sort of interesting privacy questions. So I'm curious to get kind of your thoughts around that.
00:19:39.686 - 00:20:29.038, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that, absolutely. And if you look at, like, kind of the history of, you know, restaurant in general, this kind of engagement, I think you'll see that many people are comfortable with having kind of a lot of that information public, like your Yelp reviews and your check in history on Foursquare. But there's a lot of people who also aren't. And I think generally, privacy is kind of one of the next big problem spaces that we need to take on as an industry. When I look at what kind of we've been building towards, the three ones that we've been most focused on, I've been most focused on are driving down the costs. And that's really what we're doing with L2 is like base reducing costs from, you know, $1 or $5 or $10 to do something to sub ten cents and then eventually sub cent. The second is building better wallet experiences so people can actually use these technologies.
00:20:29.038 - 00:20:49.186, Speaker B: I think you're starting to see that kind of finally get to a reusable place with products like Coinbase Wallet and Rainbow and the Coinbase app. The third is identity, where I think we really need real sense of identity on Jane. And that's again starting to emerge with things like WorldCoin. Coinbase is also working on some products here that we're rolling out natively on.
00:20:49.210 - 00:20:50.654, Speaker A: Base over the next couple of months.
00:20:51.314 - 00:21:27.354, Speaker B: And I think now that we've gotten a grip on those, which I really felt were core building blocks, in order to enable this next wave of applications, I think we now need to turn our attention to privacy. It's been cool to see a lot of research happening there. You've seen Vitalik kind of leading the way, talking about stealth addresses and what we can do kind of without having to do massive protocol changes to Ethereum, I think there's a ton of really, really interesting opportunity there, and I expect that over the next one to two years, we'll be able to, if not fully solve, mitigate just kind of privacy concerns and have paths to fully solving them.
00:21:28.694 - 00:22:01.148, Speaker C: Hey, everyone, we'll get back to empire in just a minute, but before we do that, I want to let you know that we have permissionless coming up. Permissionless is big conference that blockworks and bankless put on together. It is the biggest, the best DeFi conference in crypto this year. It is in Austin, Texas, September 11 through 13th. If you've been in crypto for a while, you know that bear market conferences are the best kind of conferences. We have a phenomenal lineup of speakers. A lot of the guests that you hear on Empire are both going to be speaking there.
00:22:01.148 - 00:22:19.964, Speaker C: You will have the opportunity to meet them there. And a lot of the topics that we cover on Empire, ZK tech roll ups, account abstraction, Mev app chain, thesis, lot of that kind of stuff that will all be discussed at permissionless this year. So because you are a listener of Empire, you get a special discount.
00:22:20.044 - 00:22:20.460, Speaker B: That's right.
00:22:20.492 - 00:22:39.090, Speaker C: Santi and I negotiated with our marketing team. You get 30% off. If you go to blockworks.com forward slash permissionless empire 30 is going to get you 30% off your ticket. Today, when I'm recording this, that's about $300 off your ticket. So type in Empire 30. When buying your permissionless ticket, you get about $300 off.
00:22:39.090 - 00:22:48.130, Speaker C: Click the link at the bottom of this episode. It's in the show notes. Do it quickly because prices go up all the time. And if you are going to permissionless, hit me up.
00:22:48.162 - 00:22:48.778, Speaker B: Let me know.
00:22:48.866 - 00:22:50.002, Speaker C: Shoot me a DM on Twitter.
00:22:50.058 - 00:22:51.654, Speaker B: I would love to meet up with you there.
00:22:54.544 - 00:23:33.952, Speaker A: One of the things that I want to touch on is how do you see the monetization model and how impactful base can be or will be in your mind to the general business model of Coinbase, which has historically been an exchange that relies on a number of fee streams, but predominantly had been trading fees, then some custody, and then now a bit of subscription. But base can be fairly profitable. You look at just the profitability of l two s by themselves. So im curious how you think about the overall modernization of base and how impactful it can be for Coinbase's overall business model.
00:23:34.128 - 00:24:49.948, Speaker B: Yeah, I think when we look at base, the primary, and think about monetization, the primary lens that we look through is not base itself. But how does base enable the next wave of use cases that grow Coinbase and grow Coinbase's ability to monetize? And where that comes from is if you look at what Coinbase has done historically and you kind of take through a few of the monetization streams, trading custody savings today with USDC staking, all of those are kind of like crypto economic verbs that Coinbase has made really easy to do. And in exchange for making it really easy, in exchange for doing that in a fully trusted way, we've seen that folks are willing to pay because they value that trust, they value that ease of use. And I think that our general perspective is those are still a really small number of use cases we're talking two to three things that people do right now with crypto and with what we're doing with base is we're basically going to widen that aperture. And so there's going to be hundreds of things for people to do with crypto. And in that world where there are hundreds of things that people can do with crypto, Coinbase is going to continue being able to provide that trusted interface on top of it. And they're going to benefit from having more things to do that can have more interfaces built for.
00:24:49.948 - 00:25:08.548, Speaker B: They can take more fees by basically doing a trusted way. And so I think it's really about kind of growing the pie of what people do on chain and then finding ways to monetize that and trusting that if we grow the pie, if people are transacting and living more of their lives on chain, that's going to end up being a kind of lucrative, really lucrative thing for coins.
00:25:08.596 - 00:25:17.610, Speaker A: Nice. Because ultimately they're still going to have to use Coinbase itself, the exchange for on and off ramp and maybe staking or whatnot.
00:25:17.722 - 00:25:56.634, Speaker B: Yeah, and they're going to use Coinbase and Coinbase wallet to actually access these dapps and use these products. Right. Like if you look at Coinbase Wallet today and Coinbase, you can trade via uniswap, and that's us providing a trusted interface. Folks maybe don't even know that uniswap stand behind the scenes, but it gives customers access to way more kind of opportunities. And so I think it's going to be that Coinbase kind of becomes this gateway or interface for this new on chain economy and that owning that relationship with the kind of everyday person the user is going to be a really good place to be.
00:25:58.774 - 00:26:09.964, Speaker A: At the top of your head. Now that you mentioned Coinbase wallet, what percentage of the overall user base of Coinbase? Maybe Coinbase retail uses Coinbase wallet?
00:26:10.584 - 00:26:25.764, Speaker B: I don't have the numbers off the top of my head, but I will say that I think Coinbase wallet is where a lot of our on chain native on chain forward customers are transacting because it's really built first and foremost for that on chain product suite.
00:26:26.104 - 00:27:01.314, Speaker A: Yeah, I was just trying to think of what the conversion rate is going to be of the total Coinbase users really retail in a base. And how different will that be relative to just purely Coinbase wallet? Which Coinbase wallet was just like, hey, here's a wallet, you can use it and then just go and venture, which still feels like it's pretty daunting for the normal user, whereas Base just feels more of a here's an App Store, an ecosystem, kind of like how the iPhone was preloaded with some apps just to give users some ability to just start using stuff and they get more familiar.
00:27:01.684 - 00:28:07.418, Speaker B: So I'm just trying to. Well, I think similar to the way that we thought about having many bridging interfaces, I think we also believe that it's going to require many user interfaces to base for people to get comfortable using this next wave of application. Obviously, Coinbase wallet, that's going to be more sophisticated users, although I think it's getting easier and easier every day. As part of this base effort and the on chain summer effort, we have taken an onboarding experience that used to take a few minutes, five minutes, and have more than ten steps, and we've condensed it down to literally one step. So you set up your phone, you face id, you download the app, you face id, you open and it opens up with a configured wallet that you can start transacting with. I think that Coinbase wallet is going to get easier and easier, but it's also still kind of on the more sophisticated side. The other side in Coinbase, we have the web3 wallet, which is a fully powered crypto wallet that can transact on base, that can use all these dapps, that can do Dexbops, can do literally anything that Coinbase wallet can do.
00:28:07.418 - 00:28:45.902, Speaker B: But the key management model is slightly different. So Coinbase does it in a semi custodial way where the shards through MPC are split across your device and Coinbase servers. And there's a recovery process. If you lose your device, that is an entry point where it's just alongside the Coinbase app, it's in the Coinbase app. So if you're just someone who's only ever traded before using the centralized exchange, but you see, hey, oh, here's this asset that I can't access on a centralized exchange, but I want to trade. You can just jump into that and it's super easy. Or if you see, hey, here's this on chain summer experience I want to do, but I've never transacted on chain, you can just jump into that wallet again.
00:28:45.902 - 00:29:23.752, Speaker B: And so I think those are two experiences that Coinbase provides. Base is even bigger than Coinbase, right? Rainbow. And we have Ravi and we have trustwallet, and we have all these folks who are building interfaces that enable people to access this economy that's starting to grow. And so as the next year kind of happens, and as these use cases mature, I expect we're going to have a whole spectrum of like, this is fully handled for you to like, you are deep in it. One other experience which I didn't mention, which I think we've talked about. Yeah, never mind. We were building a ton of institutional experiences as well to make this really, really easy.
00:29:23.752 - 00:29:33.520, Speaker B: Because it's not just everyday consumers who are trying to figure this out. It's also institutions who are like, how do we transact on chain and make that really easy?
00:29:33.672 - 00:29:44.564, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I remember using fireblocks, but it was, I mean, I think it's fairly clunky. Or was. I mean, it's not perfect. So really excited at the right time. You can talk about that.
00:29:45.654 - 00:30:01.874, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I mean, we've been using them internally for base. We've been kind of dog fooding and demoing and it's epic. It feels like if you just really powerful crypto wallet, but then it has all of the institutional security trust, everything behind the scenes. So we've loved it.
00:30:02.174 - 00:30:48.784, Speaker A: Really exciting. I want to talk a little bit about, like, I remember in the early days using Coinbase, way back in the day, like, you would be getting like, for every referral, you got like some very, like $10 a bitcoin. Back in the day, $10 bitcoin. And that ended up being, you know, like over 100 or more, depending on when you got in. Will there be some? I know there's a whole host of grants that you guys have disclosed, but also other organizations like ETH Global has like 125K prize pool and hackathons. Will there be incentive for users to start interacting on base? So if you have a Coinbase account, say, hey, we'll give you x depending on certain activity and different apps. Like, is there like some sort of incentive or will be?
00:30:48.944 - 00:31:14.456, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And they already are. Today we started experimenting with these, with opening up bridging. So in the Coinbase app and in Coinbase wallet, there's quests. If you bridge Ethereum to base, you get a little ETH on top, enough for 1015 transactions or one to two NFT mints. And so that's a first experiment. We're not just experimenting with that with Coinbase products.
00:31:14.456 - 00:32:11.994, Speaker B: We have similar kind of incentives that we've done with layer three and Galaxy, where if you go through their flows, you can earn a little bit of ETH, not for ten to 20 transactions. Same with mint. Fun. Where if you mint this bridge NFT, you get a little ETH at the end. And so I think we're kind of in the early stages of experimenting with these incentives as kind of the summer gets going, and as we start entering the fall, we also have a bunch of folks who are really excited about accessing querulous customers through base. And so it's not just going to be kind of base that's running incentives to get people onto base, it's also apps on base that are going to run incentives to get users to transact in their apps on base. I think this is the really powerful thing about this flywheel, is we are building an ecosystem where you're going to have a thriving economy of apps who are looking to grow, are willing to spend for that growth, and that's going to bring in more users.
00:32:11.994 - 00:32:27.134, Speaker B: Coinbase has this incredible pipeline of users who are ready to get activated, ready to come on chain, and that's going to bring in more apps and we're going to gradually grow the number of builders and number of users until we have a million builders, a billion people on chain.
00:32:27.534 - 00:32:49.910, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, it's really exciting when you think about it. You guys have over, last time I checked, over 100 million users and over 10 million actives. And so that's huge if you're any app out there. I mean, it's so enticing to be able to tap into that consumer base and also institutional base. So there's really no reason why you wouldn't want to deploy on base.
00:32:50.062 - 00:33:41.650, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's kind of what we've seen pretty consistently. Of course, it's going to take time. This is our first time figuring out how to build these systems to plug through users and make it work. And I think importantly, it's going to take work on the app side to make really high quality apps that people actually want to use and to integrate those experiences. I don't think we're going to snap our fingers and have 10 million people or 100 million people on chain overnight. But I do think that we have this incredible foundation that is going to allow us to, over the next couple of years, bring in not just those folks, but literally the whole world to start to experience these incredible new use cases, but also just the incredibly powerful, the reality of what on chain means. This weekend, we were opening up base for bridging.
00:33:41.650 - 00:34:30.034, Speaker B: We decided to do that in Idlewild, California, at FWB Fest, which was a really intentional decision. We brought our whole team into the woods to launch base. And we did that because we felt like it was important to be surrounded by something bigger than just the base team at Coinbase, surrounded by culture, surrounded by people who were thinking about this space in ways that were really different than we might have been thinking about at Coinbase. One of the most inspiring conversations I had is I was talking to Chris, a musician, and she was telling me, she said, since I came on chain and started putting my music on chain, my life has changed. Like, I earn more money, I have more economic freedom, I'm able to have more reach. And it's not just me. Like, as I brought my collaborators and friends on chain, their lives have changed.
00:34:30.034 - 00:35:19.664, Speaker B: And that's not an anomaly. That is the result of people moving from a system where the kind of economics and the controls and everything is. Is managed and controlled by a small number of players who, for the most part, are extracting value from the folks who are creating the incredible brilliance of the Internet to a system where when you build something on chain, or you create something on chain, it's yours, and the value flows to you, and you maintain your autonomy, you maintain your sovereignty. And so I think that over the next few years, what we're going to see is we're going to see people start to make that switch, and we're going to see their lives start to change. And that's going to be this incredible feedback loop where it's like, oh, if I move on chain, I live a third. Let me tell my friends, let me tell my family, let me show the world that this is a better way to live.
00:35:20.084 - 00:36:39.240, Speaker A: I absolutely agree with that. I mean, I think the common criticism is this is just pure financialization and speculation, which inherently is not bad. I mean, like, every technological revolution relied underneath all of that underpinning, that was, like, speculation, right? But, like, when you look at the stories of creators and nfts are always a great example that it's so relatable to people because you then touch on how powerful it is, this idea of having digital scarcity and be able to provably create digital work and content, claim it as yours, and then monetize it without having to go through a gallery or, you know, because it's been super challenging for so many artists that if you're not in New York, if you're not in these hubs, and it's increasingly hard to get discovered and interact with your core audience. Right? So I think that, I mean, a lot of, like, we have a regulatory pod here, and time and time again, the question, the criticism is always, we need to show more actual, like, use cases, right? And the prime example of that, like, Uber faced a lot of regulatory pushback, but it just became such a great product that you just, like, it just overpowered. Right. And so I think we'll get there, and I'm really excited to see these kind of use cases in base. I want to go back to one thing around identity, because I think it's such an important thing.
00:36:39.240 - 00:37:23.490, Speaker A: We have world coin coming out, and there's a whole, you could argue if it's good or bad, but one of the things that you do have is you have already KYC'd and every user that you've onboarded on coinbase when they interact on chain, the biggest issue on chain is this idea of civil resistance. One user can have hundreds of wallets. When you think about rewards, it's really hard, or has been, to create a cohesive identity fabric for on chain. How will you guys play a role in that, given all the data that you have already from your existing users?
00:37:23.602 - 00:38:00.178, Speaker B: Yep. I think it's not just civil resistance. I think that civil resistance and being able to do incentives is a really important kind of gap that identity can help fill. But another one, from my perspective, is just expanding what we can build from a product perspective on chain requires identity. If you look at the primary kind of lending product that is used in the United States, it's under collateralized credit card loans. And the only way people are able to get that is because of identity systems. And are those identity systems perfect, like a credit score?
00:38:00.226 - 00:38:00.602, Speaker A: Right.
00:38:00.698 - 00:39:23.192, Speaker B: You have a credit score that allows you to get extended line of credit. Those identity systems are not perfect, but in order to even have the concept of, like, a line of credit that's extended to an under collateralized way, you have to have some identity system, because you have to know, are you a trustworthy person? Like, can you be relied upon to pay back that bill? And so I think that that gap of identity is actually, like, holding back in a really significant way this next wave of use cases, even if it's just kind of similar use cases that exist off chain, coming on chain and benefiting from the efficiency, benefiting from the low costs. And so I think identity is super, super important in terms of kind of, your question of kind of, how is Coinbase going to play in this? You're exactly right. We have probably one of the largest verified identity databases and users in the world from a kind of crypto perspective. And so what we want to do is unlock those people to be themselves on chain. And that means building products that allow them to bring their identity on chain in a private way, allow developers to access that identity on chain so they can build new experiences like the products we were just talking about and build better incentive systems so that they know they're kind of rewarding and attracting real human beings. And we're doing that really quickly.
00:39:23.192 - 00:40:01.492, Speaker B: We have efforts in flight already. Base is obviously launching on Wednesday, but I think you can expect that we'll fast follow over the next couple months with what we believe is infrastructure that will enable that next wave of use cases by building and bringing better identity primitives. One thought on that, though, is that I don't think that these identity primitives will be, like, monolithic. It's not like going to be, oh, Coinbase is going to identify everyone in crypto and that's going to be the way to do it. Instead, what you're going to end up having is kind of these pieces composed together. So you can have your Coinbase identity on chain. You can have your world coin world id on chain.
00:40:01.492 - 00:40:44.032, Speaker B: There's going to be a bunch of other stations that you can get. Maybe all these things are going to live in open protocols, like the Ethereum attestation service, which we're really excited about. And those are going to kind of combine together to create the fabric of who you are as an individual. And that's going to be. It's going to be better for the world because it means that there's not going to be one single point of failure, one single point of control. The equifax of the web, three web, two world who you have to get on the phone with and call instead, there's going to be a bunch of different levers that you can pull to identify who you are on chain in a way that aligns with your values, that aligns with what you want to show the world. I think that's going to be a huge positive.
00:40:44.218 - 00:41:16.432, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. I mean, when you think about your credit score is really static and doesn't, I mean, there's so many different parameters that you can incorporate to build a better identity model and then feed that into defi and do a whole host of, like, set the interest rate and just think about, like, how riskiness you are as a borrower. I mean, there's. I mean, at the end of the day, blockchains are data rich, and so you can train models based on that data that are way far and beyond more efficient than, like, you know, your Social Security or credit score, if you will. Yep, it's gonna be cool.
00:41:16.488 - 00:41:17.232, Speaker B: It's gonna be really cool.
00:41:17.288 - 00:41:35.416, Speaker A: Yeah, no, it's fat. And you attach an NFT to that or like a zero knowledge proof. And so all of this, like, finally can come together. Right. I wanna talk about, you know, in this vein. Like, obviously we saw bald, which was like this meme coin that existed for like a few days. It was pretty crazy.
00:41:35.416 - 00:42:42.910, Speaker A: It reached like 100 million market cap somewhat, deployed it with over 25 million of liquidity in the pool, and then poof, like the deployer, like rugged and like took away like probably 5 million. There was speculation that it was SBF from his parents basement, all kinds of stuff. And then the obvious question was like, and this goes back to my initial question around how opinionated you will be in controlling this experience. Because at the end of the day, like, it attracted a lot of attention and it's maybe not the right kind of attention that you want, but these things happen, right? Because you can't control these things, or at least so far you guys haven't clamped down on it. Is there a point in time where you do have an opinion on that? And you create a permissioned environment, if you will, for only users that have identified themselves. And you have that ecosystem of apps and you kind of ring fence it to create a safer experience, or do you not do that and you just let it rip? You know, just if people wanted to play the ball 2.0, then that's it.
00:42:42.910 - 00:42:44.114, Speaker A: Like it's a wild west.
00:42:44.534 - 00:43:02.446, Speaker B: Yeah. You know, I think we've been. I think we've been pretty consistent on this from the beginning when we announced base and as we brought it through Testnet and as we brought through developer preview and even opening for bridging. Base is an open informationless blockchain. It's like the Internet. It is like the Internet. It is an extension of Ethereum.
00:43:02.446 - 00:44:02.286, Speaker B: And we believe that open permissionless nature, the open permissionless nature of the Internet is the thing that, of course, always has some more, but enables incredible creativity. And it has enabled so much growth over the last 20 years and will enable so much growth over the next 20 years, because we're going to have this open global economy that puts everyone everywhere on a level playing field. And without that open permissionless nature, we don't believe that we can get to that open global economy and think that that would be a real loss. And so base is going to remain open and permissionless. I think this goes back to the conversation we were having earlier about kind of what's the distinction between base and Coinbase, and how can those things interplay off each other? I think, again, Coinbase is going to continue providing trusted, easy to use experiences on top of base that help users interact with the things that make sense. For them are going to give them real value. I think that's where curation, that's where filtering, that's where those things are going to fit in.
00:44:02.286 - 00:44:21.938, Speaker B: I think that balance not just between base and Coinbase, but between base and anyone who's building experiences on top of base for everyday people, that's what's going to let us, like the Internet, have the unbridled creativity and also have the kind of trusted experiences that everyday people can rely on.
00:44:22.026 - 00:45:06.262, Speaker A: Yeah, because candidly, I mean, curation in my mind is not a bad thing. Like if you, if you have partnerships with, for instance, apps that you've independently you or some, some trusted party or consortium has reviewed both at the code base level, right said, by the way, it's audited. It has these checks like similar to defi safety score, which I think you guys were a part of back. We still are where like you may have partnerships with Uniswap as the preferred Dex, if you will, because hey, you know, you feel comfortable with that. And the last thing you want is for your users, Coinbase users, to have a bad experience on base. Because then that has a whole list of implications back to your main core business model. That at least is today, right?
00:45:06.398 - 00:45:57.982, Speaker B: 100%. And I expect that coinbase will do that and that base will continue to remain kind of open, permissionless, incredibly neutral, kind of supporting the full ecosystem and helping it thrive. So I think we're at the very beginning of what's going to be a really exciting next decade where there is so much creativity that comes on chain. And I think there will inevitably be moments where folks like, oh, this is scary, or oh, this is risky. But I think it's really important that we all kind of see beyond that and see, oh, this is a part of the creativity, this is a part of how innovation happens. It's messy. And we need to see that whole spectrum and then we need to figure out how do we build and enable folks to build trusted experience that give the right kind of sections of that spectrum to the right users.
00:45:58.118 - 00:46:29.804, Speaker A: Right. I guess I also want to get your thoughts on there's so much happening in the Ethereum ecosystem and you're very plugged into that, like account abstraction and on chain messaging and host of things. But before we get there, maybe as a last question on base, and if you want to touch on other things, we can do that. But what kind of projects are you most excited about to see either deployed that exists already somewhere else, or new kind of projects that you all feel particularly excited to deploy on base.
00:46:29.964 - 00:47:29.166, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that the things that I'm most excited about are real consumer experiences, like apps that folks actually want to use. I think Blackbird, parallel on chain restaurants and food, on chain gaming, on chain media, those are things that I think have the potential to bring a billion people on chain. If you look at the rise of different consumer applications over the last decade, whether it's TikTok or even chat GPT you see that once they have product market fit, they grow very quickly. They can go from having no users to having hundreds of millions of users, billions of users, short span of time. And so I think that we're kind of at the point where we think the infrastructure is ready for folks to start building those products, and that those products are going to be kind of new and different and powerful in ways that people don't really understand. And we want folks to be building them on base. And so if you're out there and you're building a cool consumer product, a social product, kind of anything that you think has the potential to reach a billion people, come build with us on base.
00:47:29.166 - 00:48:14.934, Speaker B: So I'd say that's one audience, of course, also really excited about the financial use cases. We've been thinking a lot about tokenized assets or real world assets and how we bring in that next wave of institutions. I think that that will kind of be complementary as well. But definitely this summer really focused on those summary consumer use cases. I guess the last thing I'd say before we pivot a little bit to Ethereum is if you're just getting started on chain or you're looking to dive in, join us this summer with on chain summer. You can go to on chainsummer XYZ every day there'll be something interesting and cool to do. Starting on Wednesday, base day one, we have some cool content to drop that's coming directly from the base team that you want to participate with.
00:48:14.934 - 00:48:30.352, Speaker B: And then every day, literally including weekends all the way through the end of August, there'll be one thing that we kind of curate, and then there's going to be many things already just organically popping up across the base ecosystem, and we'll be showing it all off at on Chainsummer XYZ.
00:48:30.528 - 00:49:01.340, Speaker A: That's awesome. I want to get your thoughts on a lot of the what's happening in the Ethereum ecosystem. And then maybe as a segue into this, a lot of the talk about l two s has been yeah, they've been super powerful to your point, like, you know, it's been hugely impactful in terms of engagement. But one of the open questions is the sequencer and the decentralization of that set sequencer. At the moment, it's not right across any l two out there. How do you think about running the sequencer for base? I've heard you talk about in the first episode. People should go back to listen to that.
00:49:01.340 - 00:49:10.620, Speaker A: If I remember correctly, at the moment, there's no plans it's going to be run by Coinbase and then TBD. What happens next? But I'm curious.
00:49:10.772 - 00:50:16.376, Speaker B: I'd say it's more fleshed out than that. Today, Coinbase is running the sequencer in parallel. We've committed to this open neutrality framework that we helped develop with optimism, called the law of chains, which kind of lays out how do we run the sequencer? What are the neutrality commitments that we need to make in order to continue being able to run the sequencer? And then also kind of puts us on a path to moving towards a world where we have decentralized sequencing and likely shared sequencing, where you have one sequencer, that sequencing many op stack chains, including base, including op mainnet, Zora Network, etcetera. And so we're just getting started on that journey. The most recent milestone is six weeks ago. We opened up a request for proposals via the Optimism foundation, where we gave out a grant to kind of do a first prototype of a shared sequencer set that would enable the next stage towards decentralized sequencing. That prototype or that RFP was granted to an organization called Espresso Labs that's been building a decentralized sequencer set.
00:50:16.376 - 00:50:46.006, Speaker B: They're working on that now. We're really excited to be collaborating with them. And so I think we're actually making really solid progress. It's the same thing on the ZK side. A lot of folks are like, hey, is base an optimistic roll up? What's going on here? And I'm like, no, we're a roll up. We're going to have an optimistic prover. But we also just gave RFP to two teams, the zero one labs team who built Mina, as well as the risk zero team who's building a risk five ZkebM.
00:50:46.006 - 00:51:38.604, Speaker B: And both of them are building ZK provers for the op stack that will enable us to fully zk prove the op stack, get all the benefits from a finality perspective, from a security perspective, and do it in a way where we have actually multiple clients, which is going to increase decentralization. And so the way we think about base, the way we think about the super chain, and this kind of technology stack that we're building is it's going to be built open source, it's going to be a public good. It's going to be contributed to by a large number of teams. Coinbase and base are the second core developer, but there's many core developers joining. And that kind of team effort, the super team effort, is going to lead to an incredibly powerful technology stack that anyone can use to either run an l two or to run an app chain. And all of those things are going to come together to provide the bandwidth and the capacity that actually enables us to run applications of the scale that can onboard billions of people.
00:51:38.684 - 00:52:04.562, Speaker A: Right, right. And people should go listen to because we recorded a great episode with Espresso and Celestia teams to talk. If you want to learn more about sequencers, because some of this might be technical jargon, you should go listen to that. I want to touch a little on, on chain messaging. I heard you talk about how important that is and you've done an integration with XMTP. Can you just touch on why you think that and kind of the relevance of that?
00:52:04.758 - 00:52:44.036, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. I think this also goes back to just the idea of everything moving on chain. That we can move a lot of the products that have been off chain on chain, and in doing that, get better experiences and better outcomes for everyday people. I think a great example of this is on chain messaging. If you think about the messaging that most of us do, whether it's iMessage or Facebook message or Instagram message, today that messaging is silent. Luckily, we've moved to a point where most of it is encrypted, which is great, but it's still controlled by one organization. It generally doesn't have interoperability.
00:52:44.036 - 00:53:10.184, Speaker B: So, for instance, you can't imessage someone on an Android phone. You get the green dot blob, and everyone hates the green dots. I'm biased. I want my message bubbles to be blue. But with on chain messaging, all that goes away. You have encrypted messaging, but it's not controlled by any one organization. It's not locked into any one UI.
00:53:10.184 - 00:53:50.288, Speaker B: So the messaging that you're doing via Coinbase wallet and XMTP is also accessible in other apps like Converse, or the XMTP web client, or Leinster. And I think over time, you're gonna have more and more folks who kind of support that, that standard. And that means that users are going to be able to move their identities to different products. They're going to be able to eject if they want to, and they're going to be able to benefit from having messaging on the same platform using the same identity as all the other things that are happening in crypto. You can just send USDC alongside the message on base. All of that just works and composes together. I think this is a great example of where we're upgrading the system.
00:53:50.288 - 00:54:08.064, Speaker B: We're saying, hey, here's a bunch of legacy systems that have shown us what's possible, but they don't work that well together. Now let's take those concepts and build them on this new on chain platform and do it right and upgrade folks to that experience and deliver a bunch of value to everyday life.
00:54:08.684 - 00:54:10.260, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely.
00:54:10.292 - 00:54:10.412, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:54:10.428 - 00:54:43.608, Speaker A: It really, in my mind, just takes one killer use case to really prove how beneficial it is to interact on chain. I think some throughout this journey, a lot of people just lost because either fees were really high at one point and they're no longer, but they haven't really cared to come and revisit, or they had a bad experience or it was bad on and off ramping. But I think people just touching on the development of Ethereum, a lot of people have like dropped the ball, not dropped the ball, but just lost interest at different points in time, but they don't realize how far the infrastructure has come.
00:54:43.746 - 00:54:44.324, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:54:44.444 - 00:55:17.744, Speaker A: So the merge was something that's super impactful. And I've heard you talk about that as kind of like something that is, quote, unquote, like likely top five most complex technical, organizational and incentive migrations in human history. Yeah, I mean, this was like, yeah, that was your quote, which, which I very much agree with. Like, people like don't recognize how hard it was to agree on something and then, and then upgrade an entire decentralized system. I mean, it's huge from a coordination standpoint, huge.
00:55:18.204 - 00:56:06.074, Speaker B: I think that Ethereum will end up being, is becoming one of the most important pieces of technology in human history. And the fact that we were able to even do that migration and land, the impact of that migration, the increased security, the massive reductions in energy usage, which is so much better for the environment, the platform that we now have to develop further on. And so, yeah, really an incredible achievement. And I think the even maybe more mind blowing thing for me about that is we're just getting started with Ethereum. We've been working on this thing called EIP 4844 for the last year and a half with Ethereum core developers and Coinbase and op labs. And that's going to ship this fall, hopefully. And it'll lower fees on roll ups, the l two is based by five to ten x.
00:56:06.074 - 00:56:37.118, Speaker B: That's a year and a half of work that we've been putting in to make that happen. And there's a bunch of other upgrades that are happening to Ethereum and the op stack that will similarly take time because this is a really complex piece of technology. But will, when they land, deliver massive, massive, massive impact that's going to enable developers to build more cool products and enable everyday people to come on chain at lower costs with more interesting things to do until we have literally everyone on chain.
00:56:37.166 - 00:56:49.118, Speaker A: Yeah. What are your thoughts on account abstraction? And just for general listeners, how impactful will that be for ease of onboarding and just creating these experiences for users?
00:56:49.286 - 00:58:00.524, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's super, super important. I think that we're right on the precipice of flipping to a world where most users first wallets are smart wallets that are enabled via abstraction, that give them much more flexibility, much more control, and enable them to progressively increase the security, the power of their wallet over time. A simple mental model of this is you can set up a smart wallet. The first security on it is you can just have a phone number so you verify with a six digit code that's maybe a little bit more centralized, but if you don't have that much balance in there, that's fine. And then as you get $100 or $500, you can say, hey, do you want to add another signer to it for large transactions? So now you don't just need the phone number, you also need an approval on your computer or whatever it is, there's going to be this way of us progressively upgrading the security model of these wallets, which I think is going to be really powerful. And then there's also going to be so much that we can do from a just abstracting complexity perspective in terms of using those smart wallets. So whether it's bundling a bunch of transactions together, so you can actually just do what the user wants, rather than having to have them approve every single step.
00:58:00.524 - 00:58:30.830, Speaker B: Or it's letting people pay gas in whatever currency they want. So you can just pay with USDC if that's what's easy for you, or if it's just subsidizing gas entirely. Because you can kind of look and say, hey, this is a smart wallet that is a real human being, that's a station. And we want to encourage them to use our products. And the developers willing to take on that cost, just like they've always been willing to take on the cost of running compute elsewhere. So I think that it's going to be huge. I think Coinbase and base are going to be kind of at the cutting edge of pushing it forward.
00:58:30.830 - 00:58:34.686, Speaker B: And I think it's going to be a key lever for bringing the next billion people on chain.
00:58:34.830 - 00:59:16.170, Speaker A: Yeah, I think so. And just as I was hearing you talk about that, I mean, one of the things that we haven't touched on much in this episode has been just the importance of USDC as a kind of a fluid to like, power so many different applications and just commerce and people forget. But like, if you're in the US, like, it's not as tough, but if you're in other places, it's not as easy to, like, to do payments or to do cross border payments and whatnot. And like, USDC is huge in that. And you guys play a huge part in that, obviously. And so, I mean, you can envision the growth of USDC as being one of the primary benefactors of just base and just increased activity going back to like, you know, how it impacts your business model. Right.
00:59:16.170 - 00:59:19.834, Speaker A: So beyond just financial, like, speculation, use cases.
00:59:19.914 - 00:59:23.242, Speaker B: Right. But more people to do on chain.
00:59:23.378 - 00:59:56.018, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, just the ease of convenience with account abstraction and just the logic of like subscriptions, for instance. Like a huge problem of SaaS companies is the drop off in renewals just purely because the credit card didn't work. Does that problem goes away with USDC? You know, I mean, like, and logic attached to that. Um, well, this is fascinating. I mean, I don't know if there's anything else you want to touch. I know we're nearing the top of the hour here, but, um, maybe to recap for listeners here, uh, just action items this Wednesday. Maybe just go through them.
00:59:56.106 - 01:00:27.058, Speaker B: Yeah, this Wednesday, uh, base opens for everyone and everything. Uh, you can get started in the Coinbase app or Coinbase wallet or rainbow or trust wallet or any wallet. Um. Come on, Chainsummer XYz. If you're looking for something to do every day from August 9 through August 31, we'll have one thing that's really fun, really cool to do on chain, and then a bunch of other things that folks have built all across the ecosystem that you can go explore. If you want to go deeper, if you want to use USDC, go for it. If you want to swap, go for it.
01:00:27.058 - 01:01:01.344, Speaker B: Everything will be there. Come experience what's happening on chain this summer. Really, really excited. That's the primary call to action, I'd say the secondary call to action is it's going to take all of us to bring the world on chain. This isn't a thing that base can do alone or Coinbase can do alone or the folks we've been collaborating with can do alone. It's really going to take everyone who's in this industry working together to figure out how do we build that next wave of use cases. How do we convince our friends, our family to give them a shot and to see the transformative power of this new platform.
01:01:01.344 - 01:01:26.790, Speaker B: I guess my ask to everyone who's listening is go build something. Go mint something. Go create something. Go drop it on base or on Ethereum or on op main or wherever you want. But contribute, contribute to bringing the world on chain starting this summer. Because if all of us put our minds to that, it's going to happen faster. We're going to pull up the timeline, and when we pull up the timeline, that's going to have a massive positive impact on the world.
01:01:26.790 - 01:01:29.394, Speaker B: So join us. Get on chain this summer.
01:01:29.734 - 01:01:41.384, Speaker A: That's awesome. Jesse. As I said last time in the first episode, it seems like there's so much happening in base, we ought to have you again sometime soon. Recap and I'm sure you'll be back.
01:01:42.444 - 01:01:45.068, Speaker B: I'm excited to also see you guys at permissionless.
01:01:45.196 - 01:01:45.932, Speaker A: Yeah, of course.
01:01:46.028 - 01:01:57.380, Speaker B: In September. So that's going to be awesome event. You're speaking, speaking there. Really grateful for the opportunity and grateful to be continuing to build with y'all as we kind of bring the world on. Shane?
01:01:57.532 - 01:02:33.776, Speaker A: Yeah. Incredibly exciting. I think this is, I've said it before, but I think base is, you always kind of think about catalyst to reignite interest. And in my mind, this is perhaps the most impactful thing in my mind to really onboard users because there's so much, the infrastructure I think is ready and I think there's a whole host of applications that people just haven't taken the time or interest because it's been hard to interact on chain. And so you guys are really playing a central part in that and bringing millions of people on chain. And so incredibly exciting. Jesse, thanks so much for coming on and sharing more insights and really excited for, you know, base.
01:02:33.776 - 01:02:35.288, Speaker A: Summer, awesome.
01:02:35.416 - 01:02:37.464, Speaker B: Thank you, everyone.
