00:00:00.200 - 00:00:25.094, Speaker A: All right, everyone, I want to introduce you to bumper, a new DeFi protocol that is here to redefine how you protect your crypto assets. Obviously, market volatility can be big concern for us crypto holders. Go check out bumper. It's bumper five. Take a step towards smarter crypto asset risk management. Welcome back to the roundup, folks. Couple days out from permissionless.
00:00:25.094 - 00:00:26.994, Speaker A: Super excited. How you feeling, santee?
00:00:27.324 - 00:00:46.224, Speaker B: I'm feeling excited. I'm, you know, I'm going to Austin. I love Austin. It's been a while since. Since I've been on crypto conference, actually. And so I'm really excited to meet up with a bunch of folks out there, you know, teams I'm invested in, first and foremost, you, Mike, the rest of the team. Yeah, it's great time.
00:00:46.224 - 00:01:03.470, Speaker B: We'll see. I'm also really curious. I think, as I said before, I think the mix of people that are going to be permissionless is going to be interesting. Just the gauge sentiment. Right. You had a tweet yesterday, I think, which was like, the timeline. The sentiment on the timeline, and I'm talking about crypto.
00:01:03.470 - 00:01:25.336, Speaker B: Twitter seems to be very negative. You know, everyone's fighting, everyone's bitter and hallmarks of bear markets. But you talk to builders, just one on one. Very different. I just had a great call with someone who closed down a prior project and is building again. And I get so excited when I see that because he's not leaving. He's like, yo, you just got it wrong.
00:01:25.336 - 00:01:43.764, Speaker B: Bad timing. Whatever. I'm going to build again. So the one on one conversations are really positive now, which don't get appreciated on the timeline, but there's also going to be an interesting mix of people. Right. If you look at ECC, that's like pure Eve camp. I feel like there's always techno optimism in that type of conference.
00:01:43.764 - 00:02:22.404, Speaker B: But at permissionless, you have a whole host of folks, right? You have JP Morgan there. You have, you know, industry, crypto, non crypto people. And I think it just gives you a better flavor. At least that's what I'm going to be looking out for, of what people are interested in, what are the narratives, you know, what is the skepticism in the room? What are the things, you know, learning? And so that's something that I'm really curious. So, yeah. Long winded answer of how I'm feeling, but I'm feeling excited because I'm going to be out in Austin. How about you? I know you're critically redlining and not sleeping.
00:02:22.984 - 00:02:23.416, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:02:23.480 - 00:02:23.888, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:02:23.976 - 00:02:53.628, Speaker A: Not looking my best these days, definitely needs more sleep. No, it's always just a crazy time. Like, hosting conferences is. It's one of the best things we do and one of the worst things we do, because there is so much work that goes, like, the day that permissionless ended last year. We started planning permissionless this year, and I think that people don't see the amount of work that goes in. I mean, for this year's permissionless, like, this is many. It costs us many, many, many millions of dollars to host.
00:02:53.628 - 00:03:14.650, Speaker A: And you have to start. You have to think about everything, right? You have to think about, like, you have to print the badges. You have to print, like, you have to print so much stuff. You have to do so much stuff. You have to time it all. You know, a sponsor wants, like, a new thing at their booth, but that already went into production two weeks ago, but they paid. Like, there's so many little things across the board, and, you know, we're ho.
00:03:14.650 - 00:03:30.814, Speaker A: There's like 40 or 50 different side events already planned. Um, we, we. We rented out, like, a dozen or two dozen. Just block works alone, like, bars in Austin, so just a lot of stuff that goes into it. You know, we have 65 people at the company now, and there's a lot of people are hands on with this event. So I'm excited.
00:03:31.634 - 00:03:38.854, Speaker B: Is this, like, a Taylor swift economic stimulus for the city kind of situation? I mean, how many people are going to permissions?
00:03:39.444 - 00:04:04.232, Speaker A: It is actually. It is. I mean, Austin less so because there's so much that happens in Austin. But when we hosted, actually, fun story. When we hosted permissionless, the first permissionless last year in Palm beach, the mayor of Palm beach came to us. He actually came to the conference the third day, and he heard that we were moving to Austin the next year, and he said, we're building a new hotel. We will, like, we want to incorporate you guys into this hotel somehow.
00:04:04.232 - 00:04:21.648, Speaker A: I think it was like, we'll give you upside in the hotel or something like that if you just stay and host this thing in Palm beach again. And, I mean, we couldn't do it because we grew. We outgrew the city. We outgrew the size of the city. It was too small of a city for us. But it was crazy. Like, we had local news at the, you know, at the event.
00:04:21.736 - 00:04:26.724, Speaker B: Yeah, it was nuts. Oh, how many people are going this year?
00:04:28.744 - 00:04:51.628, Speaker A: We'll have somewhere between, like, I don't know, like a couple thousand. Like, probably 35, I bet. I bet. Like, who comes on site to permissionless, like, walks through the booth hall. Probably 3500 of them. How many people come down to Austin? Probably like 6000 or 7605.
00:04:51.796 - 00:04:55.344, Speaker B: 6000? Yeah. I mean, that's, that's good.
00:04:55.984 - 00:04:56.764, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:04:57.584 - 00:04:59.336, Speaker B: Excellent. Yeah.
00:04:59.360 - 00:05:02.680, Speaker A: Okay, so we're excited, man. We're excited.
00:05:02.752 - 00:05:04.484, Speaker B: So this week I am too.
00:05:05.344 - 00:05:21.360, Speaker A: Oh, by the way, if people are still on the fence. Yeah, this week, if people are still on the fence for permissionless, there's a code, Yano 50 that marketing gave me. It works for the next 48 hours. So if you're listening to this, you're on the fence. You can sign up for Yano 50, I think. I'm assuming it gets you 50% off.
00:05:21.392 - 00:05:21.964, Speaker B: So.
00:05:22.364 - 00:05:39.544, Speaker A: Yeah, no, 50 this week. Here's what I'm thinking. So, maker. So Roon had this interesting post about kind of moving maker not to Solana, but on kind of this fork of Solana. So I think we should talk about that. Metamask introduced the cell feature, like, not that interesting, but kind of just funny.
00:05:40.004 - 00:05:43.156, Speaker B: And 9% fees. 9% fees.
00:05:43.220 - 00:05:44.904, Speaker A: Yeah, that's future, baby.
00:05:46.044 - 00:05:47.860, Speaker B: Visa. This is cool.
00:05:47.892 - 00:06:06.542, Speaker A: Like, visa stablecoin settlement, expanding to Solana. We can talk about that. And then there's also, like, Lido. Lido's actually so light, has obviously been dominating on a theory and. But kind of struggling on Solana. We could go there. And then there's this fund, Nima Capital, that, you know, kind of, their firm website went offline.
00:06:06.542 - 00:06:16.594, Speaker A: The account on Twitter got locked, and they kind of, it looked like they kind of reneged on this synapse. Synapse like agreement that they had. So we could talk about that. But you want to start with maker stuff?
00:06:17.834 - 00:06:20.814, Speaker B: Yeah, let's do it. I know you're super close, so lead the way, sir.
00:06:21.714 - 00:06:25.334, Speaker A: I'm actually maker now. Did I tell you my maker story?
00:06:26.594 - 00:06:31.218, Speaker B: Well, I knew you were a delegate, or you were supposed to be a delegate, so I was.
00:06:31.306 - 00:06:39.186, Speaker A: I was a delegate. I am a delegate. I was a delegate. I am a delegate. And I was. I had been get. I had been getting every week I'd like get more and more delegated tokens.
00:06:39.186 - 00:07:07.754, Speaker A: Basically. I was becoming one of the bigger delegates maker. And at one point, I voted against. There was this proposal, like, maybe four or five months ago, where I vote where they wanted to pay a bunch of people a ridiculous amount. And I actually have a pretty good insight into how much to pay employees. I'd say how much to pay people, because we employ 65 people and we've hired and a bunch of people over. We've probably employed roughly 100 people over the last couple of years.
00:07:07.754 - 00:07:32.078, Speaker A: Pretty good insight into fair compensation, I'd say. Maker was like just exorbitantly overpaying these people, and everyone had voted yes on this, and I took a kind of hard stance and voted no. And it was kind of like, hey, you're supposed to vote yes on this. You're not allowed to vote no. And the next week I woke up, pulled up my maker portal, all of my delegated tokens were gone.
00:07:32.206 - 00:07:44.906, Speaker B: So I voted the wrong way. Let's dive a little bit more into that, actually. What was the compensation relative to, like, a senior engineer makes a web two company?
00:07:45.010 - 00:08:05.232, Speaker A: I think they were paying a BD. I'm going to botch these exact numbers and who it was because it was maybe, I don't know, four or five or six months ago or something, but I think they were paying a BD person, I don't know, like three or 400k base. And then commission on top of that, they were paying engineers like half a.
00:08:05.248 - 00:08:21.564, Speaker B: Million that's in you in stable coins like Dai or make, or a mix of stable coins and tokens that's in stables. That's a lot. That's a go, yeah. For a BD role.
00:08:21.984 - 00:08:28.576, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, it's a lot. I mean, BD, like, salespeople are oftentimes the highest paid people at companies, but they're.
00:08:28.680 - 00:08:41.112, Speaker B: But the commission is 89 commission. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You eat what you kill, not, you know, when you get paid 400k, like, the incentive to really go out and hunt is not much. Yeah, candidly.
00:08:41.288 - 00:09:07.396, Speaker A: So I don't know. I was very into maker. I was following maker super closely, was like, really into everything that was going on. And then this happened, and I just got kind of discouraged not only by maker, but like, I don't know, like, it made me a little more bearish on just governance, because at the end of the day, like you, I don't know, it's supposed to be this fair and open system, and you vote against how the power people want you to vote, and, I don't know, kicked out.
00:09:07.420 - 00:09:43.584, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. You know, I've experienced that, actually. Well, I was a big part of the. Involved in the Wi Fi proposal to actually mint 3333 Wi Fi, which is, there's a hard cap on Wi Fi of 10,000, this whole bitcoin analogy meme and whatnot. But, you know, all that was farmed away very quickly, and that was a big fault of the protocol. So I'm a big believer in incentivizing people and giving employees that contribute upside. But I do think that there is a worth and revising in a lot of these daos.
00:09:43.584 - 00:10:39.914, Speaker B: There is not a lot of really good transparency a on treasury funds. The people that are voting, this is the turnouts really low. People are not paying attention to stuff to the degree where there's been protocols that have actually rugged because they make a proposal, no one is looking, no one's noticing, and then they just kind of like, you know, distribute funds in a way that I think if you were to ask people if they were aware of that, they'd say most definitely not. And if you were to ask them, they would have voted to approve that they would say, yeah, most definitely not. And so it's sort of like this, this weird. And I agree with you, it is crypto in many ways, sometimes can be advocating for transparency, advocating for inclusion, you know, and, and yes, it is open source, but in, in other ways it's a contradiction because it can be very clicky and not transparent in many ways. And, and then sometimes in the things that matter most right in getting the incentives right.
00:10:39.914 - 00:11:08.288, Speaker B: And I think daos have been largely a failure primarily because people don't recognize the. That humans don't like in any democracy. Like people just don't really show up and vote. Like, don't really pay much attention. Yes, they have skin in the game and you would think theoretically that they would be paying more attention and on the margin they are. But sometimes the token distribution is very skewed. Right.
00:11:08.288 - 00:11:49.126, Speaker B: And makers struggle with this quite a bit, actually. Like there was very strong contributors that I remember in the maker camp, in the maker forum and discord that didn't have many much tokens, weren't compensated, were putting out very interesting proposals. And then you had a lot of the A 16 zs that held a large share of the tokens that were not voting, were not delegating. And so it was like very hard to pass proposals. And that was always, I struggled with makers and I'm singling out maker. I think this is also something that happens in other protocols.
00:11:49.190 - 00:12:15.398, Speaker A: But yes, we're talking about, I mean, even in, even in, I guess we shouldn't say the name, but there's another Dao that you and I are both in. I don't know if you've been checking telegram and like these messages, but like, the DAO is definitely struggling right now. You know, there's like. So I think a lot of folks are struggling, definitely. So here's what happened with Maker. So maker. So Roon launched this basically five phase endgame back in, back in May.
00:12:15.398 - 00:12:50.156, Speaker A: Phase one was kind of the beta launch. First phase of Endgame would be establishing this new unified brand with its own stablecoin and governance token, separate from Dai and maker MKR. Phase two was the subdao launch. So following the beta launch, they were going to create six maker subdaos, each one with its own governance token. And the subdaos are designed to function independently from maker, but are tied to the protocol through its mission, as rune would say. Phase three, which is where it kind of gets a little wonky, was the governance AI tools, if you remember that. So they wanted to, or they want to still want to design tools using AI for governance.
00:12:50.156 - 00:13:32.336, Speaker A: And that's the third phase of Makerdao's endgame. Phase four governance participation incentive launch. So the launch of, what was it called? Sagittarius lockstake engine SLE, I think where you had this engine that was designed to ensure that the token holders of the new governance token would be actively incentivized to participate in governance. And then phase five is, this is the important thing because this will tie into the news is launching a rebranded new chain. It was like capitalize n, capitalize chain, new chain. That would be the final stage of the end game. And the new chain is designed to be the hub of all the tools operating Makerdao.
00:13:32.336 - 00:14:08.834, Speaker A: And that's this super important, probably the most important phase of phase five. So this past week, a couple days ago, Roon made this post titled explore a fork of the Solana code base for new chain, where he says the fifth and final phase of Endgame is the complete reimplementation of the entire maker protocol built natively on a new standalone blockchain, codename new chain. The fifth phase is a major long term project. It'll take at least three years, if not longer, before it's realized, et cetera, et cetera. Some more things. And then he goes on. The important thing is Solana obviously says Solana is the most promising code base.
00:14:08.834 - 00:14:52.356, Speaker A: After having researched all the different options available to act as the foundation for new chain, I believe that the Solana stack is the most promising code base. To explore further, he lists out three reasons for that. I can basically summarize them is first is that there's this highly optimized Solana is highly optimized for the purpose of operating a singular, highly efficient blockchain. Second is that Solana ecosystem has proven to be really resilient post FTX. And the third is that there already exists examples of the Solana code base being forked and adapted to act as an app chain. So I have a lot of thoughts on this, but would love to hear your ideas around. Good idea, bad idea, don't really know yet.
00:14:52.540 - 00:15:00.280, Speaker B: What are your thoughts around this, particularly on Maker Gonzaleano? Explain this for me and the anything.
00:15:00.312 - 00:15:06.564, Speaker A: Related to this news and maybe if there's any context and backstory to maker that like would be helpful to tee up here too.
00:15:08.144 - 00:15:34.544, Speaker B: Well, I. The thing that I've been paying most amount of attention is the reaction of room just exploring going to another chain. And I think, look, a lot of you got a lot of criticism and I don't think it's. I'm more of the mind that you should be exploring. I think any Defi founder that is deployed in Ethereum should be exploring constantly. Like you're never in a binary state. You should constantly be exploring other chains.
00:15:34.544 - 00:15:53.424, Speaker B: Right. There's like there's no benefit in being super loyal to just one particular chain. You might have preferences. I get it. I understand that ultimately I think you care most about providing the most amount of benefit and having an edge versus other protocols. Like Antonio from Dydx. Right.
00:15:53.424 - 00:16:40.296, Speaker B: He got an inordinate amount of criticism when he did that. I think he was one of the first and it was big splash, you know, and he's one of those that I actually respect and have respected more because he is vocal, extremely vocal on a number of things. And I think that's a hallmark of good founders. Candidly, going back to just the general stuff, I've been of the mind that, and I've been vocal about it, which is there's not enough, there's not enough critique within the Ethereum community. There's certainly a lot of critique outside of things in other experiments that are happening outside. And that's the sort of maximum that in my mind just led me away from bitcoin. This unwillingness to entertain other points of view and other design choices and whatnot.
00:16:40.296 - 00:17:09.409, Speaker B: I think Ethereum is not on that end. I think theorem generally is. What has made Ethereum great is this idea of experimentation and willingness to adapt because you don't have it. It's so early to assume that we've got it nailed. Perfectly designed is unrealistic. But I did see some pretty heavy criticism towards ruin from a number of Defi founders and other folks saying, hey, look, this is a betrayal. You owe a lot to the urm, and I get it.
00:17:09.409 - 00:17:36.784, Speaker B: But still, you know, I think perhaps the broader question is, are we going to see more protocols do that? Compound, people forget, but compound put out a white paper or was it two years ago saying that they're going to explore polkadot parachains? Kind of didn't. I don't know if it's. I don't think it's gone anywhere or haven't heard much.
00:17:36.944 - 00:17:45.136, Speaker A: They didn't like. They didn't like polka dot. But I do wonder if the world, I do wonder if it would be different if they, you know, explored cosmos, for example, instead of Pokemon.
00:17:45.280 - 00:18:13.836, Speaker B: Right. What is interesting, though, is I have been noticing the sentiment shift in Solana, particularly. More interest, much more optimism. And, you know, I think, you know, the pendulum, as Howard Marks likes to say, the pendulum swings to extremes, right, of sentiment. But the reality, the reality, the economic reality is that things never gravitate to such extremes. And I think Solana is one of prime example where people totally given it up, right. Highly, highly critical, think Solana is dead.
00:18:13.836 - 00:18:42.584, Speaker B: Look at all the projects that are leaving, some projects coming back, some price, actually looking at the merits and exploring, hey, there's actually pretty interesting, there's. There's some good stuff happening here. So it's good to see that, you know, I take it as a very positive towards the end game and all the like. We had a, should refer to the episode of rune coming on, and he explained this in like an hour and a half. I still don't understand it. You know, it's highly confusing. Maker is one of those protocols that is, it is hard to fully understand.
00:18:42.584 - 00:18:56.964, Speaker B: And I'm not close enough to it, to alpine on these things, other than the fact that I take it as a positive that he's exploring Solana and maybe he explore cosmos and something else. Aptos. Well, all of them, you know, uh, is my point.
00:18:57.384 - 00:19:09.164, Speaker A: Yeah. Um. All right, I have two questions for you. Why do you think they, like, why do you think they're not exploring? Why aren't they just building smart contracts on Solana? Do you think, like, why do you, why do they need their own chain?
00:19:09.904 - 00:19:41.748, Speaker B: That's a good question. I do not know. Maybe they want to own, like, my immediate reaction is we. We've talked about, like, this sort of like, vertical integration. If you can build your own l one, why not you have more design choice. You owned, like, you know, if you can do that, then it's worth exploring, perhaps. Now the question is always, how do you bootstrap a validator set? How do you, you know, it's a bit of a go to market, right? Like building your own.
00:19:41.748 - 00:19:53.892, Speaker B: We also talk about, like, building your own l two. Right. There's an explosion of l two s. Why would you do that? Well, yeah, you get some benefit of controlling the supply and the sequencer, maybe. And there's some economic upside. Certainly a lot of economic upside. We do it.
00:19:53.892 - 00:20:13.892, Speaker B: Right. But it's a challenge. Right. To bootstrap it, right. To get a validator set, to recruit, you know, harness economic security or, you know, if you're a proof of work protocol, to say, you know, even more hard, even harder. But, yeah, I don't know. I mean, I do not know.
00:20:14.068 - 00:20:25.450, Speaker A: Yeah, it makes me think. So Roon is so focused on governance. If you read his end game a couple times, it's like, very, very. Always brings up governance. And it does make me think that the. Because it's a pain in the ass to build your own l one. Right.
00:20:25.450 - 00:20:40.374, Speaker A: It's like you don't do it if you don't need to do it. And it makes me think that. I think governance is probably a play here. Right. If you. The best way for to do governor, the best way to do governance in Defi right now is coin weighted voting. And that's a shit way to do governance.
00:20:40.374 - 00:20:45.774, Speaker A: But if you actually look at l one s, they have a different way to do governance. You can just fork the chain.
00:20:46.194 - 00:21:02.006, Speaker B: Even if you have zero, you can always detract. It's like you emigrate. Right. If you don't like your country, you can go somewhere else. Yeah, but you have to go build that island, which is a challenge. And. Yeah, I don't.
00:21:02.006 - 00:21:12.514, Speaker B: I mean, you could have got. I mean, the thing that I don't understand. Yeah. He's so focused on governance, but what can't you have? If you build on top of Solana, you can build a layer of governance right at the app. Layer.
00:21:14.614 - 00:21:21.062, Speaker A: Yeah, but it'd be coin. Yeah. It'd be very, like. It'd just be the same, like, coin weighted voting. You could probably implement a different schema.
00:21:21.118 - 00:21:25.674, Speaker B: So maybe he doesn't like the validators, like, group and the. Doesn't think it's officially, like.
00:21:26.134 - 00:21:28.510, Speaker A: I don't know. I really don't know. I'm not sure.
00:21:28.702 - 00:21:30.374, Speaker B: I'm not smart. But I actually.
00:21:30.414 - 00:21:47.150, Speaker A: I mean, it sounds like there are other folks who have done this, but it's cool to see this new iteration of, like, this is an SVM app chain. Right. TBd on if it gets passed or not. I don't know if you listen. So, Mike, my co founder. Yeah. Went on bankless and had this really good episode.
00:21:47.150 - 00:21:50.134, Speaker A: Hate to, you know, promote bankless on a blockworks pod.
00:21:50.174 - 00:21:50.326, Speaker B: Here.
00:21:50.350 - 00:22:08.974, Speaker A: But I got to give him credit. It was a really good episode. Yeah. And he basically talked about how, like, the lines between different blockchains are blurring in real time. Right. And I think one thing that you start to see at the depths of a bear market is, like, ideologies about where you should build. Like, that all gets wiped away.
00:22:08.974 - 00:22:13.474, Speaker A: Because, you know, what matters? Getting users, keeping your costs low, and scaling.
00:22:13.614 - 00:22:32.002, Speaker B: And, look, security. And security. If you don't value security, then go. Then don't even consider a blockchain. This is just a database that just stick to web two. And so go to the most secure chain. If you don't think there's a chain and you think you can build a more secure chain.
00:22:32.002 - 00:22:57.354, Speaker B: Okay, go for it. I do think that security is pretty, like, there's this idea of Lindy effect, the thing. You can never be fully certain that things are 100% secure. You just have the. The longer something exists, the more certainty you have that it's secure. So bitcoin is very secure, for that matter. And you look at hash power, ethereum is very battle tested.
00:22:57.354 - 00:23:36.734, Speaker B: So are, you know, Solana, you could argue, but less so than ethereum, so marginally more risk deploying there. But you could look at the Nakamoto coefficient, you could look at the validator set, how distributed decentralized, two different concepts, right? So there's a number of things that you can kind of hone in on the security of stuff, which I believe is the most important thing. But this. This I'm just in mind, like, governance is one of those things that come back to the opening statement here of the podcast is the more and more I see stuff is try to, like, trust. Minimization of governance should be the goal here. Like, if you can get rid of governance, like, I just. I'm still not convinced.
00:23:36.734 - 00:24:00.250, Speaker B: It's like, chopping, right? You simplify stuff. Get rid of everything that if you can. You know, I think this is what makes, like, l one's beautiful. Because there's no, like, actual governance, as you say. You just, you know, detract and go somewhere else. There's no, like, actual voting of how the blocks can be ordered. It would be total chaos, 100%.
00:24:00.362 - 00:24:04.314, Speaker A: So, um, do you think this should happen or. No.
00:24:08.254 - 00:24:25.606, Speaker B: Like, let me ask you a question. This is very lore, me. I mean, like, you ask your question from my response, does that mean that they're gonna leave Ethereum? Like, there's gonna be a maker in theorem? No. Right? So gonna, like the implementation so it can be there. Like, actually don't know.
00:24:25.630 - 00:24:27.286, Speaker A: I actually don't know that I don't know.
00:24:27.350 - 00:24:35.564, Speaker B: I don't know. So I can't answer. If that's the case you're trying to do that feels like a huge overhaul. If it's more of, like, a cross chain deployment.
00:24:36.024 - 00:24:36.804, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:24:37.104 - 00:24:42.696, Speaker B: Feels like. I don't see much risk or downside. I should say.
00:24:42.720 - 00:24:42.904, Speaker A: Risk.
00:24:42.944 - 00:24:56.680, Speaker B: I should say. I see limited downside, more upside. Right. You get more users. You get more. But. And we've seen other protocols deploying other chains, but I don't know if the center of gravity is moving to splana, what does that mean for Ethereum? Does that mean that it just no longer exists? Like.
00:24:56.680 - 00:25:19.104, Speaker B: No. Right. Because there's somebody uses an ethereum that want to use maker if you're vault or not. Like, you're not gonna. I'm just really struggling to understand. I don't know because I haven't looked closely enough. What is it? At the end of the day, as you said, what does that mean for someone that has a vault open on maker? What is he gonna have to do? If nothing really changes from that front, then I don't really care.
00:25:19.104 - 00:25:21.364, Speaker B: You know what happens on the back end.
00:25:21.824 - 00:25:38.182, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. So it's funny, you're starting to see this app chain thesis really play out, but it's not happening on Cosmos, right. And that's like, I don't know. You gotta feel for the cosmos guys. Like, they, like, that was. That was the app chain thesis was the cosmos thesis.
00:25:38.182 - 00:25:40.438, Speaker A: And it's. And it's happening, right? It's really happening.
00:25:40.486 - 00:26:20.766, Speaker B: Listening on Cosmos, we had Jack and Zaki here. One of the last questions I asked him is, how do you feel about BD? Now, you're not supposed to pay 400k for your BD folks, but how do you feel about BD? Because Cosmos, I've always felt tendermint, as a consensus engine for Cosmos, is pretty battle tested. But I think that they've all been on one of those protocols that super smart guys, they've had some drama with founders and whatnot, and, you know, IBC was delayed and whatnot. Nonetheless, I think the tech is pretty cool, but I don't think they're killers. I don't think they're BD. I don't think they get their name out there, and you need to have that. I appreciate we're early, and.
00:26:20.766 - 00:26:44.754, Speaker B: But the best tech doesn't always win. And I know there's really vocal folks out there. Some of the guys that work in blockworks, we had on, but you just don't compete. Right. It's a number of things. Right. And it's, again, we might be revisiting and come back six months saying, wow, we're so wrong.
00:26:44.754 - 00:27:02.622, Speaker B: And they were at the cusp of this huge growth, but it doesn't feel like it. Right. Um, you know, I may remind listeners, Libra at Facebook, forked cosmos. I mean, tendermint. Use tendermint. Or were you gonna use it? Finance merchant uses tendermint.
00:27:02.678 - 00:27:03.726, Speaker A: Are you sure about Sony other?
00:27:03.790 - 00:27:08.274, Speaker B: Is that true? Yeah, yeah, they were gonna use tendermint. Absolutely.
00:27:08.654 - 00:27:09.438, Speaker A: I didn't know that.
00:27:09.486 - 00:27:42.742, Speaker B: And then they started developing what ended up morphing into aptos and suit in a number of things. Right? Yeah. But initially, yeah, it was a fork version of tendermind. So, yeah, I don't know. I think it's, I don't want to call it too early, but they need a bd overhaul. They need to get more out there. And maybe part of the problem is the incentives, right? They don't have enough tokens, like as an organization, to dole out or whatnot, attract teams when you're competing against Aptos or some of the other new l ones or even l two s, like, they have way more muscle.
00:27:42.742 - 00:27:47.238, Speaker B: Right. To convince people games, NFT projects and whatnot.
00:27:47.286 - 00:27:47.566, Speaker A: Right?
00:27:47.630 - 00:27:49.794, Speaker B: So it matters.
00:27:51.854 - 00:28:47.064, Speaker A: All right, everyone, I want to introduce you to bumper, a new DeFi protocol that is here to redefine how you protect your crypto assets. Obviously, market volatility can be a big concern for us crypto holders. Bumper alleviates this by allowing you, the user, to lock your tokens into the protocol and set a price. No matter how much the market fluctuates, your investment in your token won't fall below the predetermined value. When you compare this to traditional options platforms, Bumper offers a non custodial and actually cheaper, on average alternative that protects the value of your crypto from market price drops. If you are looking to earn a yield on your crypto, bumper has you covered. By depositing USDC into the bumper protocol, you can earn a return which is derived from the premiums paid by protection buyers, early adopters, and empire listeners have a chance to claim a part of the $250,000 early adopter bump rewards.
00:28:47.064 - 00:29:14.268, Speaker A: Go check out bumper. It's bumper five. Take a step towards smarter crypto asset risk management, everyone. We'll get back to Empire in just a minute, but before we do that, I want to let you know that we have permissionless coming up. Permissionless is big conference that blockworks and bankless put on together. It is the biggest, the best DeFi conference in crypto this year. It is in Austin, Texas, September 11 through 13th.
00:29:14.268 - 00:29:45.690, Speaker A: If you've been in crypto for a while, you know that bear market conferences are the best kind of conferences. We have a phenomenal lineup of speakers. A lot of the guests that you hear on Empire are both going to be speaking there. You will have the opportunity to meet them there. And a lot of the topics that we cover on Empire, ZK tech rollups, account abstraction, Mev app chain, thesis, lot of that kind of stuff that will all be discussed at permissionless this year. So because you are a listener of Empire, you get a special discount. That's right.
00:29:45.690 - 00:30:07.512, Speaker A: Santi and I negotiated with our marketing team. You get 30% off if you go to blockworks.com forward slash permissionless, Empire 30 is going to get you 30% off your ticket. Today, when I'm recording this, that's about $300 off your ticket. So type in Empire 30 when buying your permissionless ticket, you get about $300 off. Click the link at the bottom of this episode. It's in the show notes.
00:30:07.512 - 00:30:23.504, Speaker A: Do it quickly because prices go up all the time. And if you are going to permissionless, hit me up. Let me know. Shoot me a DM on Twitter. I would love to meet up with you there. Should we, should we stick with Solana, talk about Visa?
00:30:24.644 - 00:30:28.024, Speaker B: Sure. Yeah. I think that was a great announcement. That was one that really caught my eye.
00:30:28.524 - 00:30:57.526, Speaker A: Yeah. So Kai Sheffield, who is just an awesome person, but also head of Crypto Visa, Big tweeted out this big announcement on Tuesday. I'm just going to read it. We are excited to announce that Visa has expanded our stablecoin settlement capabilities to merchant acquirers, launching pilots with Worldpay Nuwe. The important part here utilizing the Solana blockchain. And he goes on to explain it. When a consumer uses a Visa card to make a purchase at a merchant, they experience the convenience of instant payment authorizations.
00:30:57.526 - 00:31:56.928, Speaker A: What they don't see is that the value for their purchase needs to move between their bank, the issuer, and the merchant bank, the acquirer. Visa's treasury and settlement systems enable the clearing, settlement and movement of billions of dollars a day, making sure the preferred currency is received in the correct amount from the issuer and sent to the acquirer in 2021. Visa began testing how we could use USDC inside our treasury operations, leading to a live pilot where we now accept settlement payments for crypto.com quote s credit card in Australia over the Ethereum blockchain to a Visa managed circle accounts goes on to kind of explain that pilot, and now he gets into Visa, can now settle these payments to Worldpay and USDC, enabling Worldpay to more flexibly manage their own treasury infrastructure and route the USDC directly to their merchants with less worry about wire cutoff times and bank holidays. Super cool. It's still early days, but visa has already settled millions of dollars of USDC over both the Ethereum and Solana blockchains. Between our clients.
00:31:56.928 - 00:32:12.054, Speaker A: We're committed, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So really cool announcement from Visa. Very excited about this and very interesting that they chose. There's like two stories here, right? There's awesome to see visa the largest, one of the largest payment networks in the world.
00:32:12.134 - 00:32:12.798, Speaker B: Largest.
00:32:12.926 - 00:32:21.154, Speaker A: The largest, yeah, yeah. And like, just pushing forward with, like, on chain stuff. And then also very interesting that they chose Solana.
00:32:21.774 - 00:32:59.390, Speaker B: Absolutely. I mean, I'll just comment, like, you know, there is so many parallels when Visa started, like, there were so many skeptics of how you could use, not traveler checks, not cash, and use this thing, a plastic thing could be used to, like, pay for stuff, and you didn't have to carry these traveler checks when you travel. And what, like, that's the thing in the past, and Visa really pioneered that. There's a great. There's a great ad on the newspaper, like circa 19, I don't know, sixties or whatever, black and white. So it's like this thing, visa, like, revolutionary. And so many people are critical.
00:32:59.390 - 00:33:27.054, Speaker B: And you could, you see the same, you know, level of skepticism around stable coins. But we were talking about this, I think, in a prior episode of the Coinbase one. Right. With the Coinbase ventures kind of ideas. Right, which is what, guys, so. Right, like, the amount of fees that happen behind the scenes to enable you to swipe your card anywhere in the world that accepts visa. And it's part of the visa network is like.
00:33:27.054 - 00:33:46.874, Speaker B: Is pretty large. There's an interchange fee. There's settlement times that are harder. Merchants don't get money in time. We're talking about the instant settlement of these things is huge. It benefits visa because they can earn some fees elsewhere, I believe. Actually, we'll get that in a second.
00:33:46.874 - 00:34:26.584, Speaker B: But it certainly benefits merchants, I think, because they get instant settlement and they have those funds working capital. It benefits the consumer, I think, as well. These are probably benefits because it's like, there's no, like, fraud. There's no reversal of these transactions. They probably cut a whole host of operations on the back end that are people that are checking this stuff to enable, you know, the, you know, the accountants that are making sure that everything is balancing out right. That doesn't happen when you have, like, a smart contract that, you know, verifies movement of funds in an instant manner. And so it's pretty awesome to see, you know, this is, this is one of those where lot of people that are skeptical of show me.
00:34:26.584 - 00:35:01.250, Speaker B: You know, it's really just a bunch of, like, you know, people that are speculating, gambling, and or like, crypto punks that are really interested in this technology. I'm like, no, no, no. From my vantage point, banks are really excited and interested in deploying this technology for real visa as well. Like, they. Because there's a meaningful cost save on the back end, and that is enough to, like, get people really interested in this. You know, you've seen the likes of Santa there a few other banks, like, explore bond issuance and settlement, and just the record keeping itself on an open distributed ledger. It's so obvious, right, that this needs to happen like, that.
00:35:01.250 - 00:35:29.044, Speaker B: You can measure risk easier, you can understand the composition of the ownership of these instruments, and the trading of these instruments can happen faster. There's no settlement t plus three or two or 30 or whatever, and that has a whole cost saving benefit to that. So, look, it is very impressive that visa is the largest, is exploring this, and that tells you everything you need to know about where stablecoins are going. I mean, it's just unequivocally going to be how e commerce is going to be run, full stop.
00:35:31.624 - 00:35:59.300, Speaker A: May of 2020. You remember Paul Tudor Jones called bitcoin the fastest horse in the race. And what that did is it unlocked institutional capital. And the reason it unlocked institutional capital is not because, you know, obviously some people said, Paul Taylor Jones is doing it, we should do it, too. That's one of the reasons. But the real reason is it took away the career risk for portfolio managers to allocate to bitcoin. Previously, if they thought bitcoin was a good idea to allocate to, they wouldn't bring it up because of the career risk.
00:35:59.300 - 00:36:23.582, Speaker A: But now you can't get fired for allocating to bitcoin because folks like Paul Tudor Jones do it. This moment is huge for stable coins. I think it's a similar type of moment for stable coins. It is a massive validation. Right. Not every merchant wants to accept USDC. And let's say you're the head of infrastructure for a huge merchant, and you say USDC before this.
00:36:23.582 - 00:36:41.354, Speaker A: I mean, that's career risk in the same way. But every merchant wants instant settlement. And now that visa has brought this up, right, lower cost, lower risk, cross border us dollar delivery to merchants. This is a huge unlocking system.
00:36:42.294 - 00:37:13.066, Speaker B: What's most exciting here, Jason, is on the investing standpoint. You have to go to committee to convince your pm to allocate this SasA class. When visa rolls this out as a feature and gives you all the benefits, it's a click of a button, like it's a turning on kind of feature or might even just be enabled. And this is what I tell people. You know, a lot of people ask me, hey, how do you see this technology evolving? I'm like, look, most people don't really care or know how technology works in the back end, not the Internet. Don't even go further. They don't even.
00:37:13.066 - 00:37:53.126, Speaker B: Can't. Can't even draw a bike, yeah, don't even on airplane. Don't care about these things. The apps that you have in your phone, probably not gonna change, you know, and most people might even not even know they're gonna be using crypto rails, but they're gonna get a loan faster, their rates gonna be lower, they're gonna be approved much faster, won't have to fill forms over and over again. All this jazz, right, where you're a merchant, you know, the reason why most people don't accept when you go a merchant, they decline your American Express, is because american express charges are more fees. And so I think it's. It's one of those things where people just might go in and more.
00:37:53.126 - 00:38:36.320, Speaker B: You could see American Express get into the game, right. Very quickly. Visa go serious here, because they're going to be, you know, they're going to feel at a disadvantage, and so Mastercard and so on, so forth. And that really goes to stable coin, the percentage of stable coins. Not only the sheer argument, stablecoin transactions just goes up orders of magnitude, but also the percentage that is on payments encompasses a much larger share, which is diminimous right now. That's really, really exciting. I think if you were to survey thousands of businesses and you would tell them, hey, what if I told you that you could get your money not t plus, something that is heavily negotiated, you're a small business versus medium versus large, right? And it's really a small to medium.
00:38:36.320 - 00:39:02.682, Speaker B: They get crushed. They get their money not in three days. They get their money in 20 days. If you compress that like it is, the. Probably one of the biggest pain points of merchants is how quickly they get the money. And so even particularly in e commerce, the number of transactions that get rejected like false positives is fairly high. Right.
00:39:02.682 - 00:39:22.684, Speaker B: And it's billions of dollars that get lost and subscriptions, they'll get renewed because they're swiping credit cards don't work anymore. That doesn't happen with stable coins. And that's. That's huge. So. But I do think that it takes your payments is one of those categories that people get really excited when you first learn about crypto. Right.
00:39:22.684 - 00:39:37.184, Speaker B: But it doesn't happen because people don't like to spend their bitcoin. It's a volatile asset, but a stable coin is not. And I think it's due for a huge, huge renaissance here of payments as the largest category in crypto in the immediate term.
00:39:37.524 - 00:39:58.048, Speaker A: Yeah, it's funny. So I found a shirt from the bitcoin event bitcoin conference 2013, and the subtitle of the conference was revolutionizing the. Revolutionizing the payments industry or something. I'll find. I'll send it to you, or maybe I'll post on Twitter or something. Yeah, yeah.
00:39:58.136 - 00:40:22.474, Speaker B: I think it's one of those things. You think. Think about the second order effects of this, right? You start with payments, and then people could become conditioned to then investing and then, and then gaming, right? But when you're transacting so easily, digital currency, like, it just becomes so habitual. Like every, every day, every day. Like, you're just stable. You're used to seeing us, you see, or whatever flavor packs is whatever flavor of coin you have. And it's going to be a thing.
00:40:22.474 - 00:40:56.512, Speaker B: And people get very quickly, will adapt to this new normal. And at that point, I think it solves so many things, so many issues where people have been so critical of this industry. We had Rebecca and the regulatory pot talk about, hey, the biggest problem right now is most people just think that they don't take this industry seriously because they don't see a really good use case. It's super small. It doesn't compute. It's all, you know, 24 7365 casino. But the reality is, no, and this is, I think, going to be the thing that people wake up to and say, I get it because you feel it and it's real.
00:40:56.512 - 00:42:01.696, Speaker B: And as a catalyst, I think, and as a narrative, I think it would be the most important thing. And I'm so glad guys, I mean, guys probably been one of those industry guys that has been around forever, right? And he's been, he's been doing God's work in visa. You know, there's been so much turnover in cycles of folks at different organizations that when crypto is popular, they hire a bunch of team and then they come out with a bunch of announcements that don't amount to much. But guy's been at it for such a long time, and I think it's super, super impressive that an organization as big and serious as visa is truly doing good work and getting serious about utilizing this technology. Perhaps the second organization that I can think of just to round up this thing is LVMH as a luxury conglomerate, appreciating the benefits that this whole new generation and category like nfts enabled. So two different big narratives. And I mentioned this because we always talk about narratives, right? And I think these two things are the biggest things that I'm seeing right now.
00:42:01.880 - 00:42:19.576, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Let me zoom out from this a little bit and just talk about Solana for a second. So you've got visa building on Solana. You've got roon and maker thinking about building. You know, they're kind of app chain on the SVM, or fork of the SVM, I guess that's what you'd call it. What are your kind of updated thoughts.
00:42:19.600 - 00:42:22.008, Speaker B: Around Solana here from.
00:42:22.056 - 00:42:24.084, Speaker A: From, like, an allocation perspective?
00:42:26.624 - 00:43:16.636, Speaker B: Um, well, from an allocation perspective, like, I haven't deployed new dollars, I guess. Um, but that's not to say, but I am curious and actively looking to invest in projects that are building in Solana. I mean, I have a portfolio that is built on top of Solana. But, yeah, I mean, I've been close with the team Solana. We've had Ben on, we've had Toli, and so they're super active on Twitter, too, and so have good conversations. And I could just tell that I like to see they're active and, you know, actually like they are. I respect them so much because I think they're the team, the number one team out there that really embraces criticism and uses that to their advantage.
00:43:16.636 - 00:43:58.594, Speaker B: And they've really gone through fire, and it's been hardened. And it was good to see Vitalik and some other folks in the Ethereum camp say, hey, look, when FTX kind of went down, they said, hey, this is kind of the Dow hack moment of this community, and I think they're going to hopefully come out stronger. And I think you're seeing that now. Are they out of the woodwork? You know, I don't think any community really is right. A bear market is always. That's kind of conviction, but I'm increasingly super positive on it. And I think I really like, I really? Like how they've taken criticism and implemented upgrades, like on the fee model, dynamic fee model, for instance, makes total sense.
00:43:58.594 - 00:44:33.214, Speaker B: And I always point people to that and saying, tell me how that, from being highly criticized to implementation and deployment like that, that whole kind of loop was really nice to see. And I think it really embodies the kind of thing that I like to see in teams that are building. So to cut it short, my allocation, I guess, has gone up on a percentage basis because Solana has rallied. Right. It went down away eight. And then it's now what's sitting at what, forget now.
00:44:33.344 - 00:44:34.762, Speaker A: 20 ish. 19, maybe.
00:44:34.858 - 00:44:52.522, Speaker B: 20 ish. Yeah, 20 ish. Low twenties. So, so that has increased the percentage. But I have deployed new dollars. But anyone listening out there, you know, built, thinking of building on Solana or not just Solana, but, you know, if that's your home, then reach out to.
00:44:52.538 - 00:44:57.834, Speaker A: You know, what always happens here. You say reach out. You know, people do. They reach out to me and say, can you?
00:44:57.874 - 00:45:09.714, Speaker B: Oh, really? Lovely. Well, then you can also invest. I don't know. Is that good? You know, then I get your deal. Yeah. How's that bad all of a sudden?
00:45:09.794 - 00:45:10.394, Speaker A: No, I'm down.
00:45:10.434 - 00:46:03.230, Speaker B: You know what, folks? Yeah, yeah. Have you, have you, what's your, what's your kind of allocation stance on it? Well, the meme would be like, where are you finding any money, man? Like, you know, there's nothing. No, no one has money to deploy, man. What are you talking about? Where, where are you finding these things? Out of the couch, on the mattress? Like what? Oh, your grandmother, like, all of a sudden gave you some, like, change? Because I heard a terrible stat on venture. Just funds. Like, the deployment in crypto is not only, not only crypto, just as a whole, like, my nose topic in and of itself, but it is, it is, it is tough out there. You know, a lot of founders are really starting to get funding, and it's always like this, but, you know, it's, it's real now.
00:46:03.230 - 00:46:07.654, Speaker B: And interest rates are going to persist and stick at 5% for a long time.
00:46:07.814 - 00:46:08.222, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:46:08.278 - 00:46:48.988, Speaker B: And, you know, yeah, it's tough. And lP's are not getting distributions from, you know, old data, vintage funds, like, yeah, it's tough. Even the best teams, even the best projects not just in Solana, are really struggling to put two and two and, you know, raise small rounds. I'm not talking even 5 million, I'm talking 2 million rounds now. And that even that is 3 million rounds is. It's tough even for the best founders even for the best of teams. So there's, there's a very, I think there's, I don't know, there's a very cautious outlook.
00:46:48.988 - 00:46:58.534, Speaker B: And really people are just hunkering down and saying, look, I don't know how things are gonna shape out. There's an election, there's so much uncertainty and not a lot of deployment happening.
00:46:59.154 - 00:46:59.914, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:47:00.074 - 00:47:06.094, Speaker B: So, yeah, I'm too shameful. Plug.
00:47:06.394 - 00:47:26.952, Speaker A: Yeah. Let me ask you about Nima Capital. So it's less about Nima here. What I'm wondering is more just about like, well, let me, let me, let me share the story. So Nima Capital is this single family office with a bunch of private and public equity investing platforms. They have a mandate to invest across a bunch of different things. We've actually known them for many, many, many years.
00:47:26.952 - 00:47:57.910, Speaker A: Blockworks used to have fun story. We used to host family office dinners in New York. That's like an unsung or an untold story of blockworks is one of the first real way that we figured out what sponsorships were where we had this big family office network that we would build by like cold emailing and cold calling people. And then we'd bring the family offices there. And then companies like a bitgo or a, do you remember harbor? They did like tokenizing real estate. They would spend like twenty five k to sponsor the dinner. Anyways, Nima Capital would come to those dinners.
00:47:57.910 - 00:48:43.230, Speaker A: So they got a grant from syn. They got a syn grant, syn synapse from the DAO via the foundation to basically build this new liquidity model. I think it was to increase quote efficiency by 2030, 40 50%. They received this grant in return for locking $40 million of liquidity of syn. So they were this long term capital partner of the Dow. But what happened, I'm just pulling up my notes here, is they did not keep it locked. They allegedly sold more than 9 million synapse tokens and synapse labs just posted on Twitter.
00:48:43.230 - 00:48:55.584, Speaker A: They acknowledged the sale and the liquidity removal in a post, saying that they're just investigating unusual activity on their wallets. They didn't disclose the liquidity provider, but I think it's become pretty clear things.
00:48:55.624 - 00:48:57.524, Speaker B: Were done from a wallet. Eye control.
00:48:59.104 - 00:49:00.584, Speaker A: Exactly, exactly.
00:49:00.744 - 00:49:06.328, Speaker B: Okay, guys, we can all see what's going on on chain. You send it to an exchange or liquidity.
00:49:06.496 - 00:49:31.142, Speaker A: We see. So anyway, since then, Nima Capital's website has gone offline and they did not immediately respond to a request for comment for. And their, their account on x is locked, so yikes. I would guess one of two things here. Not to spread fud, but, like, I would assume so. I've heard going around that there's, if a fund is. So maybe you can explain this to me.
00:49:31.142 - 00:49:51.166, Speaker A: If a fund has been around for five years, you have to go through all these, you have to jump, you have to, like, file all these things. Maybe with the SEC or something. And a lot of funds, they'll like 20. The funds who were started in 2017, 2018, they're now at their five year mark. And when, when they come to investigate you or just like, look into your. I truly don't understand how this works. So you can educate me.
00:49:51.190 - 00:49:52.914, Speaker B: Like a register investment advisor.
00:49:53.334 - 00:49:57.038, Speaker A: Yeah, something. Yeah. Once you hit a certain au, I.
00:49:57.046 - 00:50:15.934, Speaker B: Think it's more of an Aum thing, less so of a, like, vintage. But I may be wrong. Yeah. But it's a pretty big overhaul to convert to a registered investment advisor. And, and what you're saying is that they somehow wanted to avoid that process.
00:50:16.474 - 00:50:24.778, Speaker A: Getting, like, look, either they're getting looked at or they're, or they just ran out or they messed up a bunch of trades and they're, you always get.
00:50:24.826 - 00:50:39.216, Speaker B: You, you always get looked at. Not descriptive funds, hedge funds, you know. Yeah, they do periodic inspections. You know, if you, if you have, if you're managing outside people, outside money, especially the bars higher, and they're going to be, you know, oh, you know.
00:50:39.240 - 00:50:51.776, Speaker A: This was the other things on the, this, the Wall Street Journal reported last month that a condo linked to Nima Capital was sold for $80 million. So actually, I don't think this is probably not like some investigation. It's probably just, they have a huge liquidity crunch.
00:50:51.880 - 00:51:25.296, Speaker B: But maybe, I mean, probably, I don't know. I don't know enough or anything, actually. But it does beg the question of how are these deals even being structured? I mean, what a handshake lockup. You could, like, there's a thing called the smart contract that, you know, it really enforces this without trust. Yeah. You know, like, you know, this is the thing also with the curve sales. Right.
00:51:25.296 - 00:52:18.088, Speaker B: I mean, were those actually in smart contract or were they just like, verbal agreements? Like, you know, we, this is, again, this is what I struggle with this industry, man. Like, there are ways to deploy things that minimize trust, to avoid situations where trust is breached. You can do that in a cost effective manner. And by the way, it is so you can deploy smart contracts fairly easy standard. Why not do it like, like, what is the, the benefit of not doing that at this point and time, time again, we just learned it happens, right. So anyways, just a healthy reminder, right? If you're doing a, some sort of transaction involves investing in lockup, just do it like it's on chain. Like, there's no ambiguity, there's, there's no risk.
00:52:18.088 - 00:52:20.684, Speaker B: Like, what am I missing?
00:52:21.024 - 00:52:21.976, Speaker A: What is the.
00:52:22.120 - 00:52:22.496, Speaker B: What?
00:52:22.560 - 00:52:28.244, Speaker A: Yeah, what is the kickback for. For, for basically breaking lockup rules? Is it basically just reputation risk?
00:52:28.584 - 00:52:50.896, Speaker B: I mean, like, I don't know. Like, the contract. You have to look at the contract. Yeah, but it's a breach of contract. I'm not an expert in tort law, but you just breach the contract and you can argue. But a whole bunch of things. Like, okay, like, in a worst case, you can argue damages, right? I mean, like, if they all of a sudden, like, hold two, three, 5% of the log and they sell, like, the protocol, probably go back and say, hey, wait a minute.
00:52:50.896 - 00:53:26.008, Speaker B: Like, you sold. That had a material impact on the price. Not only that, but the signaling, right? Because people can track your wallet. It's like, what's going on? Like, you know, all kinds of things, right? There was, there was a good post from believe it was Ari Paul a while back that talked about these things where, like, the supplies locked, but there's like, mark, like, OTC desks that are allowing you to, like, trade that. Like, there's a whole. He really doesn't expose a. Some of the inner dealings of these transactions.
00:53:26.008 - 00:53:39.152, Speaker B: And I'll surface it. But Ari Paul's great job. People should go look at his tweet. He does a way better job. Like, really just exposing, like, hey, sometimes, like, you got to look at this stuff. And a lot of it was going on in FTX, like Alameda FTX. And, like, they would, like.
00:53:39.152 - 00:54:21.820, Speaker B: So anyways, like, it happens, right? And again, you know, it's one of those things where the industry advocates transparency from first. Like, your blockchains are transparent, this industry's open source, and so many other things. Like, I'm not making broad characterization because I think this happens everywhere, right? Like, to not even go into finance and how obscure these things are and, like, global financial crisis. Yeah, I don't even go there. But we're talking about crypto, and we always want to be super critical about crypto because we can do better. We could sell police and we could, like, push people to do the right thing. And it's one of those where, you know, you could just structure things with a smart contract.
00:54:21.820 - 00:54:48.276, Speaker B: That's why you got a log. Smart contracts. That's it. People can whatever you're doing, you could look at what's happening, not just sending your tokens to a market maker and pray to God that they're not sending it to an exchange just to cleanse wallets. And you don't mean, like, come on, like, we know at this point, if you haven't learned the lesson, it's like, you know, fool me once. You know, shame on you, filming twice. Shame.
00:54:48.276 - 00:55:00.756, Speaker B: Yeah. What is it? Shame on me? Yeah. Because, you know, I. So anyways, it will be interesting to see what happens more. More. So. I really love to understand what was the.
00:55:00.756 - 00:55:12.484, Speaker B: What was the intuition from the syn team who voted on that proposal? Who decided on that? How was that structured? These are all kind of open questions that I have.
00:55:12.864 - 00:55:13.624, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:55:13.784 - 00:55:16.112, Speaker B: Anything else you would say?
00:55:16.168 - 00:55:35.784, Speaker A: No, I think the last thing. I think the last thing from this week was, you know, now that there's excitement around this bitcoin ETF, the spot ether ETF is kind of off. Right. There's this bid with, I think it was Ark invest in 21 shares. So. And 21 shares, I think, used to be amoon Hani's thing. Hani's awesome.
00:55:35.784 - 00:55:37.372, Speaker A: And.
00:55:37.548 - 00:55:37.852, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:55:37.868 - 00:55:54.104, Speaker A: And Cathie Wood, you know, ark invest, there have obviously been futures ETH ETF filings. I'm not sure if there have been spot ETF filings before, you know, where they hold ether directly, but this is. It's cool to see.
00:55:55.164 - 00:56:05.560, Speaker B: Definitely. So what do you think? How does this play out? Bitcoin ETF gets proof first. Imagine, imagine, imagine, imagine an ETF gets approved.
00:56:05.632 - 00:56:07.844, Speaker A: I've never seen smiles so wild.
00:56:09.464 - 00:56:37.624, Speaker B: I would just really go on timeline and just, just see all the laser eyes feel like, whoa, what's going on? You know, like, what happens? What happens to the remaining laser eyes? And I know I will remind folks, I'll remind folks that Jason's claim to fame is that he convinced Tom Brady or he gave Tom Brady his laser eyes and he sent him a picture on Twitter and he post, allegedly, he changed his profile picture.
00:56:37.784 - 00:56:41.424, Speaker A: What do you mean allegedly? He did change it. I tweeted at him and said, you won't.
00:56:41.464 - 00:56:50.212, Speaker B: You won't change it. I'm not objecting the fact that he did change his profile. I think we all saw it. You.
00:56:50.228 - 00:56:53.584, Speaker A: I know the real story behind that, that. That. Of how that happened.
00:56:53.884 - 00:56:59.544, Speaker B: I think you've said the real story before, but you somehow failed to disclose certain things. So let's hear.
00:57:01.324 - 00:57:17.576, Speaker A: It got changed. So I tweeted it. Like, I think he tweeted, like, exploring bitcoin or something, because he had this deal with FTX, and he was starting to tweet about crypto more. And so I was like, you won't. I just tweeted. And, like, you won't change your eyes to laser eyes or something? This is like height of the market. Yeah, 2021.
00:57:17.576 - 00:57:22.952, Speaker A: I challenged him and actually made the photo for him, so I made the. I made his laser eyes for him.
00:57:23.088 - 00:57:24.164, Speaker B: And you tweeted.
00:57:24.464 - 00:57:34.896, Speaker A: And I tweeted it and was like, you won't. Yeah. And. And he. And he changed it, and I was losing my mind. You know, I'm a Boston sports fan, Patriots fan.
00:57:35.000 - 00:57:38.584, Speaker B: Oh, you're patriots fan of God. Folks, I'm leaving Empire.
00:57:38.704 - 00:57:41.480, Speaker A: Red Sox, Celtics, patriot, losing my money.
00:57:41.552 - 00:57:46.724, Speaker B: Do my proper deal. Someone who went to school in Boston and, God, Jason, how did I not know this?
00:57:46.884 - 00:57:48.024, Speaker A: Where'd you go to school?
00:57:48.444 - 00:57:49.184, Speaker B: Bu.
00:57:50.324 - 00:57:58.204, Speaker A: I like bu. Anyways, I get it. I get a text from a friend, a couple. So I'm losing. Tell my whole family. Tom Brady. I'm getting text.
00:57:58.204 - 00:58:14.176, Speaker A: Anyways, a couple days later, I get this. I get this text from a college friend. I haven't. I haven't talked to her, and I haven't talked to her in years. And she's also Boston sports fan. Turns out she was running the. She was working.
00:58:14.176 - 00:58:21.084, Speaker A: She was working at, like, I don't know, WME at the time or something, I forget, or endeavor. And she was running the social for Tom Brady at the time.
00:58:21.784 - 00:58:32.768, Speaker B: So she knew you and hooked it up. So it was confirmed. All right, folks, we'll give Jason credit here. Not allegedly. That was as close as we get to the truth here.
00:58:32.816 - 00:58:38.824, Speaker A: So anyways, there's your, there's your. There's your social alpha. All right, man. I'll see you next week, huh?
00:58:39.444 - 00:58:45.548, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Hopefully. Hopefully our lines don't rug us, but, yeah, be smooth sailing and really excited to go out there.
00:58:45.636 - 00:58:53.660, Speaker A: Actually, it's like 50 50. Make it. You see, United Central database shut down earlier this week, and they halted all flights.
00:58:53.732 - 00:59:15.668, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. And there was also an issue in the, in, in the UK. And anyways, I buffered in a few days, so I'll be out there if you are, you know, come out. I'm going to be speaking there about Defi long Kyle and a few other folks think framework.
00:59:15.836 - 00:59:17.124, Speaker A: Are you on that panel, chow?
00:59:17.204 - 00:59:32.624, Speaker B: Yeah, about just defi in general, which actually, before we go, I just need to tell folks, metamask the 9% really ticked me off. Really, really ticked me off, because that's not something we're working towards I know the convenience, but charging folks 9%, we forgot being unfair.
00:59:32.744 - 00:59:34.656, Speaker A: So Metamask launched a sell feature.
00:59:34.760 - 00:59:35.560, Speaker B: Yes, yes.
00:59:35.632 - 00:59:40.688, Speaker A: Where you can sell, not into USDC, but you can sell directly into PayPal or your bank account.
00:59:40.736 - 00:59:50.776, Speaker B: Apparently, it's almost immediate. Right? Like, you sell a token and they'll send you your funds to your PayPal account, whatever. But they charge you 9%, which. Is that true?
00:59:50.800 - 00:59:53.248, Speaker A: They charge 9%. Did you test it? Because I don't know if that's a.
00:59:53.296 - 01:00:00.664, Speaker B: I didn't test it. I just saw someone. I mean, I saw this guy tweet about it. If it's true or not. I don't know. Maybe I should be checking. But, you know, it was.
01:00:00.664 - 01:00:24.064, Speaker B: I had a very visceral reaction to that 9%. Look, I get it. It's. Is it all metamask fault? No, because they have to jump through hoops and it's a big part of the problem, right, that you going through these traditional rails and meshing both crypto and traditional rails has a cost. Coinbase charges a lot of fees, too. There's a cost associated. But, boy, 9%, it's not how we're going to scale this industry.
01:00:24.064 - 01:00:40.216, Speaker B: This is not. And there needs to be a better solution. So after that. After that tweet, a bunch of teams beam a few others, like reach or, you know, I'm being introduced to a few teams for trying to solve this kind of pain point. Right, this bottleneck where crypto meets traditional rails. But hopefully you can figure that out. Right?
01:00:40.360 - 01:00:44.360, Speaker A: So, yeah, Coleman, good pod.
01:00:44.472 - 01:00:46.720, Speaker B: See you in great pod. Yeah, we'll see you, sir.
01:00:46.792 - 01:00:47.024, Speaker A: Great.
01:00:47.064 - 01:00:59.364, Speaker B: Great chatting, as always. Thanks, everyone, for listening. And we'll be next pod. If you're not going to permissionless, things are going to be, at some point being made available and. Right, the panels, the videos on YouTube.
01:00:59.404 - 01:01:01.356, Speaker A: Don't. Don't tell people that. I want people to buy.
01:01:01.380 - 01:01:22.274, Speaker B: Yes. No, the one. No, I'm just pirated films. Right. Come out. You have a guy, like, dude in.
01:01:22.274 - 01:01:23.506, Speaker A: The movie theater with the camera.
01:01:23.570 - 01:01:32.738, Speaker B: I'll be that dude. I'll be that dude. Yeah, no, but we'll. We'll be reporting. So we got to come out some good content. What's going on there. And so, yeah, stay tuned for that.
01:01:32.906 - 01:01:33.754, Speaker A: Cool. Cheers.
