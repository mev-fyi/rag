00:00:00.360 - 00:00:07.270, Speaker A: This episode is brought to you by Bitmex, the OG crypto exchange that is back and better than ever. You'll hear more about Bitmex later in the show.
00:00:07.382 - 00:00:30.224, Speaker B: By the way, speaking of inflation, just as an aside, can you believe coffee? The inflation on coffee is off the rails. I mean, we always know that if you live in New York, you get totally ripped off by a cup of joe anywhere you go. But the coffee bean itself has been on this massive rant, a massive rally, you know, so I'm feeling the pain, sir, because I drink more coffee than I care to admit.
00:00:37.764 - 00:00:58.650, Speaker A: All right. All right, everyone. Welcome back to another episode of Empire. Today's roundup, we are talking about the market puking, and Santiago was nearly in tears. I couldn't tell if it was, like, happy tears, crying tears, or what was going on. So, Santi, how you feeling today, man? The Dow is down, like 4%. Nasdaq is puking down 5%.
00:00:58.650 - 00:01:07.254, Speaker A: I know one of your investments step in is down, like, 15%. Salon is down 15%. Bitcoin's down 8%. How you feeling today, my friend?
00:01:07.794 - 00:01:13.722, Speaker B: Well, unbothered. What is it? In my lane? Moisturized.
00:01:13.818 - 00:01:15.298, Speaker A: Moisturized. Yeah.
00:01:15.466 - 00:01:48.510, Speaker B: Just speaking of stepping, what's also down is probably a lot of folks are also losing weight as a result. So, you know, there's always positive to this. No, honestly, I'm un. I mean, I don't think about near term movements as much these days. It is interesting to observe, but, you know, it's like, we all know this to be true. The more you check your portfolio, the more you're going to do dumb stuff. And so I know I'm very prone to doing dumb stuff, and so I'd rather just not check my portfolio constantly.
00:01:48.510 - 00:02:17.488, Speaker B: And so, on the flip side, had really good last couple days. I spoke with. It's always nice when you. I spoke with a founder who's been on stealth for five months, has a team of 40 unity developers, self funded. He was a surgeon, left, started his own company, and, like, I'm, like, fired up about investing behind this guy and this team. And so, to me, like, as long as I keep seeing that, that's the only thing that matters, really, like, really good talent building in the space and excited.
00:02:17.586 - 00:02:51.504, Speaker A: All right, so you've been saying this for six months, right? So the market tops out in November. You've been saying this for six months. Like, I don't pay attention to short term price movements, and I completely agree. I'm also not waking up and checking the prices of crypto every single day. But here's where I'd push back on you, is you're a very prominent angel, right? I'm assuming you've got a lot of portfolio companies who are now coming to you saying, oh, shit, we might actually be sliding for quite a while. What is the kind of advice that you're giving to founders today? Is it button down the hatches? Is it stop hiring? Is it extend your Runway? Is it raise at any terms possible? What is the kind of advice that you're giving right now?
00:02:51.804 - 00:03:36.660, Speaker B: I always tell founders, you want to raise when you can, not when you must. And sometimes, like, I was very critical of these massive rounds in 2017, but at the end of the day, like, my key learning was, I mean, it served them well to have that war chest to weather through a what felt like a brutal bear market. You know, folks like, you know, companies like Filecoin, even like, hashgraph definities of the world, you know, like, these are like eye catching raises and they, they're well capitalized. And, you know, in this increasingly competitive environment, you want to have resources to be able to hire the best talent and to pay them well. And so I actually, my, my advice to founders is, don't do anything stupid. Keep your burn rate low, hire really good talent. Like, one engineer.
00:03:36.660 - 00:04:27.944, Speaker B: One really good engineer can make up for 17 crappy ones. And so in order to find that really good engineer, sometimes they're risk averse. And so it helps to be well capitalized. It helps to have HR currency, meaning raising a round from notable investors. Like, these are things that crypto Twitter sometimes takes object to and saying, oh, you know, it's a VC coin, but it matters, right? Psychologically. Like, consciously or subconsciously, if you are someone that is working at a prominent web, two comfortable job, you have kids, you're married, or you have, like, a high opportunity cost, let's be honest, it's going to help when he sees, oh, wow, protocol x or y raised from an Andreessen Horowitz or a paradigm or a tiger, or, like, these things do matter. And so that's kind of like I always tell founders, like, if you can get away with it, raise it and not have to think about it, assuming the terms are okay and the dilution is okay.
00:04:27.944 - 00:04:41.508, Speaker B: And so, you know, you don't know if we're going to be in two, three, five years of pretty brutal conditions or not. And so it's always good to have enough Runway. At least two years of Runway is kind of my barometer.
00:04:41.676 - 00:05:33.014, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, it feels like these just low interest rates flood of like fast, you could maybe say dumb late stage capital. Really, what happened is it just jacked up these artificial paper venture returns, right? And this has had a bunch of like secondary effects, right? One is it kind of convinced LP's to just flood into the market with capital in search of kind of UnSA sustainable returns. And I think it convinced GPS that, like, they maybe were better than they actually thought they might have been at investing, or just that returns can be compressed into a shorter time horizon than is actually possible. So where do you see, you've got a lot of companies, I don't want to call anyone out by name, but who have raised on 100 X revenue, who have raised at a $7 billion valuation when maybe it should have been a $1 billion valuation. Some companies have raised at a $13 billion valuation when their revenue is like $40 million. Right.
00:05:33.014 - 00:05:41.190, Speaker A: So what are your for these kind of later stage already unicorn companies? What happens to these folks in the next twelve months?
00:05:41.342 - 00:06:18.166, Speaker B: That's a really good question. Look, the problem that you have in crypto is that you have liquid venture in true price discovery. So you have a really low float on some of these tokens, that if you look at the circulating supply and the fully diluted supply, it's a huge, like, you have less than 510 percent of the entire token supply in circulation. And so it creates this weird dynamic where the price of the unit price of the token is such that it has this massive fully diluted valuation in the billions. Look, at one point, like, Filecoin was worth like 0.5% of all the world's gdp. You're like, there's no fucking way that this coin should be worth this much.
00:06:18.166 - 00:07:07.070, Speaker B: And so as tokens are minted and come into circulation, it creates this downward pressure on the token. What I'm trying to say a lot where I'm going with all this is it is very difficult. And I've had these conversations with founders and say, wow, they're both anxious when the price of the token is such, where this fully diluted valuation is like, it's not sustainable, but it's also not nice when the token collapses 90% because it's demoralizing. It's really demoralizing for new hires, for the community. And so anytime you see something go up to 100 and then down to two, it really, it's difficult. And unfortunately, there's no perfect answer or solution to this. You're always going to have long inflation curves, some longer than others, and it is what it is.
00:07:07.070 - 00:07:51.484, Speaker B: The best you can do as a founder is keep building and prove out and walk your way up to that valuation. Perhaps the only sound advice. I don't like to give advice, but I think strategically, I think some more sensible founders and saying, look, I don't feel the need to launch a token. I mean, in a true raging bull market, everyone wants to launch a token. Most founders, except the really exceptional ones, I think, hold off and want to just truly build a great product. Look at uniswap, right? They kind of didn't want to raise, didn't want to launch a token and kind of sushi, put it under their heads, and so it just became level stakes. But I think now, what's nice about this market condition, which is really choppy, feels like kind of bearish.
00:07:51.484 - 00:08:10.784, Speaker B: And so founders and the community is less eager to launch a token, and so it puts more focus on building a really solid product before launching a token, which is kind of nice, to be honest. I think most token launches are really premature in nature, and I get it. Sometimes you have to do it for competitive reasons.
00:08:10.864 - 00:08:42.870, Speaker A: But, yeah, yeah, yeah, I think so. There's an interesting dynamic in crypto where the token, uh, is live. Like, is the company's equity is live much earlier than in traditional markets. Right. Because you have a token instead of just waiting to go public. One thing that's happened is, um, there are these, like, red hot valuations in private markets, and private market valuations are running so far ahead of the public markets that I do wonder if this makes sense for, like, some of these new funds. Like, shout out to, um, who is it? Ryan Watkins, ex Masari analyst who just launched Pangea.
00:08:42.870 - 00:09:28.524, Speaker A: And. And they're taking very concentrated bets on, like, three to seven, high conviction, maybe even leveraged, like, liquid token investments, with the thought that private market valuations have run so far ahead of public that maybe some of these new funds will start investing exclusively in public market opportunities. And just the second point there is that Jeff Dorman, I think Jeff Dorman a couple weeks ago had a really good point, which is that a lot of venture funds don't actually buy the publicly traded coins, even if it tokens, even if it's actually cheaper than where they bought privately, because they don't want to mark to market. Right. So if you're buying, if you're investing in the. In the equity round or just in the private rounds, you don't have to mark anything to market if you're buying liquid tokens. Well, now you have a business where you have to mark to market.
00:09:28.524 - 00:09:30.720, Speaker A: And so I'd love to get your take on that.
00:09:30.872 - 00:10:24.658, Speaker B: Jeff is partially correct, because as you unlock these tokens, you apply some sort of discount. So you have to, I'm not sure if all funds do this, depending on how they're structured, but for the most part, as you start unlocking these tokens, you have to mark them at some sort of. Once you have an equity investment that has a token, you have a position that I think most funds apply some sort of discount, but don't hold it at cost. Now, I may be wrong here, but the accounting on this is very difficult. And sometimes you just have to apply some sort of rubric by which you say, there's a token that say you invest in uniswap and you have this, this massive bag, but it's locked because investors typically are locked for at least a year. And so some funds might hold at a cost until the tokens are fully unlocked, or they're just marking the position in some sort of big discount. It's not perfect science.
00:10:24.658 - 00:11:02.156, Speaker B: And then, but still, I mean, I think the point is correct, which is traditional venture, and some traditional venture funds investing in crypto would much rather invest in equity because it's great to not have to mark to market. And I've always felt that back going to Ryan's strategy, there's a few other funds, x ultimate or guys also launching a fund that I'm excited about. I felt that, like, it is a neglected part of the market. Everyone is chasing private deals. The valuations are not as cheap as back in the day. I mean, I love investing in sub 20 million. Anything above that is like, hmm, I don't know, like, unless it's an exceptional team, they can get away with 50 million.
00:11:02.156 - 00:11:30.452, Speaker B: Um, but those hundred $200 million private runs, you're like, it makes me really uneasy. I'd rather go and, like, wait for them to launch. And a lot of these, I tweeted about this to two weeks ago. A lot of the projects that I saw in the private rounds, their token is trading below. And so that's when I scoop it up. Uh, has less execution risk. You have liquidity, you can stake these tokens, you can use them as collateral, like, and, and it just becomes earn a yield, it just becomes a better strategy.
00:11:30.452 - 00:11:53.012, Speaker B: And if you're a fund, it's a much more scalable strategy. It's a much more scalable. Like, you can deploy billions of dollars in the public markets, not just in Ethereum, but like, you know, like Defi and some sort of other stuff like top 20, top 50 tokens, you could probably deploy billion dollars. It's really hard to do that in the private, private, private, private side.
00:11:53.188 - 00:12:17.492, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. I know you've loved investing in the private markets, right? And that's been your kind of mo. It's like, oh, pretty very exposed on the venture side of things. It's starting to feel like, I mean, I know you always push back when I bring up bear market vibes or like crypto winter, right. But, you know, we're six months into kind of down sliding prices, I would say. And you're starting to see just like these takes on Twitter. Here, here's, here are two, for example.
00:12:17.492 - 00:12:47.440, Speaker A: I love melt them. I love melting to death. She said controversial take Ethereum should stay proof of work. Right? You've got Sandeep from Polygon also. Love Sandeep, love Polygon. But he's like, really coming at the Avalanche team on Twitter and like, these are things that I've just seen in 2018. And 2019 is like when you start to slide into this bear market, people start to get kind of upset with how things are going and like people start to get a little angry and people start to get just kind of frustrated with how things are working.
00:12:47.440 - 00:13:20.144, Speaker A: And I, you know, Cooper Turley, shout out to Cooper. One of the biggest enthusiasts for dows tweeted out, I think it was yesterday or the day before, saying like, all right, it feels like Daos. We've kind of maxed out our capacity for Daos right now. And so kind of you start to feel the narrative shifting a little bit, tying it back to the beginning of this question. You love investing in the privates and venture. How does that shift? How does that strategy shift for you? Do you start saying, all right, I'm going to slow down the private investing and maybe start to scoop up some of these tokens that are cheap or what's your strategy look like?
00:13:20.664 - 00:13:35.944, Speaker B: Some of my best strategies has been like investing in. So I will probably not slow down my pace of private unless I see valuations. It have some flows. I will continue to always do privates. I felt to that episode. Bill Ty, I totally agree with him. I felt, I feel just really comfortable.
00:13:35.944 - 00:14:01.400, Speaker B: That's my edge. Investing in teams that are teams of two or three at a really sensible valuation with huge upside in markets that have huge upside. I want to wait 510 years. I've done it before and that's it. And so in order to do that, you have to have other sources of cash flow. And so I have a public portfolio that I earn yield on. And I'm, you know, I love yield farming and I love earning yield on chain.
00:14:01.400 - 00:14:33.152, Speaker B: It could be stable. We spoke with Travis from ikigai. You could have a portfolio of 80%, like bitcoin ETH, pick your, whatever, other l, two of choice, stake that earn 8%, whatever, have 20% on stables, earn 1015 percent yield on stables, and then deploy that into privates. You can outperform 99%. Well, funds doing that. Now, assuming the privates takes two or three to really have an outsized return. Uh, paradigm has done that.
00:14:33.152 - 00:15:17.856, Speaker B: Well, I think, you know, in the bear market, they, they were mostly invested in bitcoin, and then they selectively funded a few deals like Uniswap, that kind of like, return their fund. And so, you know, I think they're in the top quartile of funds out there. Return wise, I think is my sense. And so, I mean, back to my, my thesis is I don't feel, I always like to remind myself, like, whenever I feel that the market is, is ran away from me, I always kind of say to myself, there's probably going to be a state in the future where I'm going to be able to pick up this coin at this price. Again, just be patient. Like, don't, don't chase the market. Let the market come to you.
00:15:17.856 - 00:15:41.210, Speaker B: For the last six months, since November, I felt I haven't deployed new capital into my portfolio, meaning I have only recycled within crypto. And I just felt that I wanted to hold cash to buy pain. I haven't seen true, true pain.
00:15:41.322 - 00:15:43.578, Speaker A: What, what is true? What is true pain?
00:15:43.706 - 00:16:37.364, Speaker B: I want to see a forced seller. I want to see the bull, a perma bull, be chopped and just have to sell because he's being liquidated or he has redemptions or something. And when I see that and I track wallets and I looking at this stuff, and when I see someone sell forcefully, that's when, that's when I'll hit the bit, I'll lift that. And I haven't seen that. Yeah, you know, it just has felt that we're still, it's probably the early, if we are truly in like a bear market, meaning macro wise inflation is not transitory, we might, geopolitical conflicts might continue to, you know, like my long term thesis in crypto is very much unchanged. It solidifies every day. And so I'm not gonna rush and I'm not eager to deploy.
00:16:37.364 - 00:17:05.820, Speaker B: I wanna, I wanna just be on the sidelines a little. And, you know, it's, think about it. This way, unlike traditional investing that you made this point earlier, if you're a softbank, you're doing dumb deals because you know you have to beat the, you know, you have pension money and pension funds need to be, you know they need to beat their hurdle. And when record, when it's record low rates, like you're, you're farther out in the risk spectrum. But in crypto, you have not. Okay. Crypto as a whole is far out in the risk spectrum.
00:17:05.820 - 00:17:38.504, Speaker B: But you have a stable coin like USCC, and you can earn like 1213 percent on that. Okay? There are risks, smart contract risk and a number of things. You can buy insurance if you really wanted to. Like you're getting paid like above inflation rates to, to have the market come to you and buy these dips. Like why not just do that? Like why not rotate 20? Like I think Berkshire Hathaway is like having, I was reading about this has record high as a percentage of their book. Like they have cash is at an all time high. I think it's like 2020, 5%.
00:17:38.504 - 00:17:54.438, Speaker B: There's some truth into that. I mean, like why not whole 20, 30% of your portfolio in stables, farm buy these dips when the market pukes in, the things that you believe in 510 years down the road are going to be multiples of where they are today. And that's what I've been doing for the last six months.
00:17:54.566 - 00:18:17.114, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. Let's talk about the last part of the market that has not started peaking, which is nfts. So there was this big article, article in the Wall Street Journal. NFt sales are flatlining from the Wall Street Journal. And this article and the charts and data used in the article showed that NFT sales are theoretically crashing. And they appear.
00:18:17.114 - 00:18:34.950, Speaker A: So our team looked into the data. It appears to be based on kind of this incorrect data from non fungible.com dot. And I don't really know non fungible.com. And I'm sure it's a great team over there, but it wrongly shows that NFT sales are plunging. Started plunging in November 2020, 2021 and never recovered. Right.
00:18:34.950 - 00:19:09.282, Speaker A: This chart shows somewhere around 200,000 nfts sold daily in November, down to, what is this? Around 15,020, 30,000 today. Right. But when I pull, pull up dune, right? If you look at dune, which is just fully open sourced on chain data, you can actually see that NFT sold are hitting these monthly all time highs. And every metric, active traders total volume, et cetera, seems to be actually at an all time high. So here's this chart of OpenSea is pretty wild. You can see Opensea volume per day.
00:19:09.338 - 00:19:22.776, Speaker B: And that's the key. Right. Because the chart in the Wall Street Journal is referencing n, meaning number of a perhaps unit of nfts, whereas volume just talks about, obviously, the notional value of nfts traded per day.
00:19:22.880 - 00:19:34.536, Speaker A: Right, right, exactly. Exactly. So what's your take on this? What are your thoughts on this Wall Street Journal article and maybe expanding out? What are your thoughts on just the NFT market in general right now?
00:19:34.680 - 00:19:40.144, Speaker B: It's just a reminder of, like, listen, folks, you need to make independent analysis, and it's just, they skew the data.
00:19:40.184 - 00:19:40.312, Speaker A: Right.
00:19:40.328 - 00:20:13.154, Speaker B: I mean, the chart is terrible. Like, who cares about number of the units? It's just like, to extrapolate based on that is like, really dumb. You have to look at the volume. What I've observed is, like, you have these collections like Azuki's and moonbirds, that their floor is pretty high out of the gate. Like you're talking about 2030 ETH. You know, that's 50, 60,000 per and per JPEG. And so I think there's been a consolidation in the market, meaning the blue chip, there are more blue chip collections and people willing to pay for that.
00:20:13.154 - 00:21:06.084, Speaker B: And so, and that, that, to me, is pretty healthy barometer of, of people that, you know, are perhaps are trying to replicate what bored apes has done and seeing what's going to be. I think today there was going to be an un, like an unveiling of beans, which is related to Azuki. And like, we talked about this in prior episodes, I think bored apes is sort of charting the path of, you have a land sale, you have a token that has some, confers, some governance rights to determine how this community is harnessed. And I think obviously, there's a lot of speculation on this land sale, for instance, we can talk about later. No one really knows how the game's going to look. And yada, yada, yada. But still, I think the dune dashboard is more representative of what is going on in the market.
00:21:06.084 - 00:21:40.486, Speaker B: But I do think that perhaps a number of mints and projects has slowed down and there's been a consolidation in higher quality projects, which I think, candidly is probably a better thing. Right. I felt that there was just a supply influx last year that you and I were talking about. It just felt like two or three a day. You're like, that doesn't feel sustainable. But it's nice to see that there's higher quality projects with some sort of a compelling roadmap to get people excited and have these floors pretty high. You're talking about.
00:21:40.486 - 00:21:48.310, Speaker B: Okay, a moonbird or an Azuki is worth the same as a pretty high end car. Let's just frame it like that. That's pretty wild.
00:21:48.422 - 00:22:11.914, Speaker A: Yeah. There was a gaming acquisition I saw go through, I think it was this week or last or pretty recently. It was I think $300 million deal. $300 million deal to buy. I think it was like 1200 gaming developers came over in the acquisition or 1400 gaming developers and some aaa rated games. $300 million. That's like around how much yugalabs made in this other side deal.
00:22:11.914 - 00:22:48.098, Speaker A: The capital that's in the space right now is just completely ridiculous. But yeah, we'll talk about Yuga labs in a second. There's this, just want to shout out this guy Martin, actually, data journalist over at Nansen and I thought he had three great points that we can talk about. One is volume is still higher right now than almost any other week in 2021. Right? So volume of NFTs is still higher than almost any other week in 2021. That's one piece of the data. The next is that users and transactions, users per week is still higher than any week in 2021.
00:22:48.098 - 00:23:09.774, Speaker A: Transactions per week don't look as strong, but they're still in a lot, in pretty good health. And then projects with at least ten sales per week is showing the strongest growth. Right. Growing from 1.8k projects at the start of the year to over 2.4 thousand today. So yeah, if you really look at any of the data, it still shows that the NFT space is going really strong right now.
00:23:10.194 - 00:24:00.962, Speaker B: Where do you think we go from here? Like what the Ape token has done is pretty remarkable and it feels like there's a lot of strength and excitement. And you also look at the land sale that they did recently and it wasn't executed very, it was executed pretty poorly, I think just how the dutch auction and this is leading to these crazy gas prices. But I'm curious, like before we get into that, like you keep saying that you and Mike talk about NFT market a lot and you keep getting proven wrong that the music has to stop. And a lot of people have been calling that and myself included. Like for folks out there skeptical, um, like what do you think sustains the NFT market? What do you think is in store for the rest of the year? Um, I'm going to preface all of.
00:24:00.978 - 00:24:52.136, Speaker A: This by saying I really like what the Yuga Labs team is doing and it's just remarkable what they've done. I will say, uh, it's getting a little, it feels like it's getting a little out of hand with Yuga Labs. And it feels like someone who's trying to basically, absolutely race to scale and just like blitzscale maybe, without finding perfect product market fit. And, uh, actually I'm going to give a shout out to our podcast producer, Garrett, who said this to me in a slack yesterday. He said bored apes feel like the last great hope of retail in the bear market. And I just think that's a really interesting line because when you think about what has happened with bored apes, like why is, why has the floor gone up so much? And like, why do they have this die hard community? Well, it's because board apes are the best investment in crypto since bitcoin. Better than ethereum, better than anything else, better than your step in investment.
00:24:52.136 - 00:25:17.892, Speaker A: It's the best investment since bitcoin, really. And I'll say this because what did they mint at? Like $200, right, you. So you minted at $200. That $200 has turned into basically a million dollars. So you've got your board ape, you've got your mutant ape, you've got your kennel, you've got your like other side land, you've got your ape coin. All of that combined, it's around a million. It's probably maybe a little less 800, 900k.
00:25:17.892 - 00:25:45.488, Speaker A: There hasn't been another investment outside of just buying bitcoin in the last 1015 years where you could turn $200 into a million dollars. And so that's why I think it's going to take a lot to pull this market down. What might pull it down is this summer there's a lot of projects launching that are working on the financialization of nfts, using nfts as collateral. And that could, I think that could be pretty dangerous for the market. Yeah.
00:25:45.656 - 00:26:07.714, Speaker B: So just put in perspective. So assuming that's correct, bored ape investment, if you minted an ape, would have been a 5000 x return. If you'd have bought the Ethereum ICO and ethos trading, that would have been slightly below that. Because ETH, if you're an ethic ICO investor, you would have made 6000 x, probably a little bit more with the forks. Right. Like Ethereum classic, but nonetheless, you know, it's pretty impressive. You're right.
00:26:07.714 - 00:26:24.582, Speaker B: And so, yeah, we'll see. I don't have a good answer for this other than I think NFTs are bringing. You know, just, I think it's still net positive. I hope people don't get hurt. But it's fun. It's collecting. That idea doesn't go away.
00:26:24.582 - 00:27:12.806, Speaker B: We're seeing music nfts. We're gonna see other type of nfts that brings in more users. And so, you know, we spoke about this in the episode with the variant guys. You know, I think they're very much believers in this webinar three creator economy underpinning that a lot of that is nfts. And so, you know, I think traditional classic jpegs, I think that's where I would probably concede the Wall Street Journal article, which is, probably feels like that is slowing down quite considerably. I think where the most of the excitement in the NFT market today is around something like what Uclabs is doing, which is a game and other projects attached to that and or music nfTs, which seem to be all the rage these days. And I candidly don't own any, but I can see why people are excited about them.
00:27:12.950 - 00:27:41.712, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, it feels like we're entering the second phase of nfts. So the first phase of nfts was really profile pictures. And these are just like collecting, uh, collecting something almost to show it off. Right. You want to. And also maybe access to a community that was like really just the first phase of NFTs was these PFPs. Now, you've got a lot of the projects coming with utility, which pros and cons to that, but you've got, what is it, Moonbirds? You've got Chris Cantino did his thing with club CPG.
00:27:41.712 - 00:28:15.308, Speaker A: The permes community, obviously very biased, but I think it's a really interesting community that has a lot of potential. And then it feels like maybe a year or two years until we enter phase three, which is starting to actually financialize some assets that don't have tokens usually associated with them and putting a non fungible token around them. We interrupt your programming with a special announcement. Empire has a new sponsor. Santi and I are very excited to welcome Bitmex. That is right, Bitmex is back. The exchange we all know and love is back and better than ever.
00:28:15.308 - 00:28:41.208, Speaker A: We're going to be dropping a couple updates on BitMex over the next couple of months. This first one is a big one coming soon. Bitmex is rolling out their spot exchange and they're giving away $500,000 in bitcoin to new users. That's right. Listening to Empire has got the Alpha Santia and I got you $500,000 in bitcoin going to new users for the ogs. I don't think I need to tell you why you need to use Bitmax. It's a love of the game kind of thing.
00:28:41.208 - 00:29:11.022, Speaker A: You respect crypto, you use Bitmex. For those newer to the industry, Bitmex has a long and great history of innovation. Since their launch in 2014, they created perps and a whole lot more. Now they're back, they're better than ever. They're making waves. So what do you need to do? Go sign up for the Bitmex spot, exchange for a chance to win some of the $500,000 in bitcoin that Bitmex is giving away. Bit mexbitmex.com.
00:29:11.022 - 00:29:40.600, Speaker A: That's bitmex.com. Go make it happen. Now let's get back to the show. So that's, yeah, that's kind of where I think we're at. But let's pivot into talking about Yugalabs and the land sale. So basically last week, last Saturday, Yugalabs, via their, basically Yugalabs, did this, like, land sale for otherside, and they ended up raising $320 million from land sales. So $320 million in one day from land sales, which, by the way, just.
00:29:40.632 - 00:29:57.180, Speaker B: To put that in perspective, that would have been probably the largest round of financing done two years ago in crypto. Well, yeah, maybe not like with l ones, but like with like. But still, it would have been one of the largest rounds. So it's crazy. And this was done in like minutes.
00:29:57.332 - 00:30:45.084, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, I think it's becoming abundantly clear that NFTs are just a new funding mechanism for startups, right? This is no different than a decentraland or another metaverse raising a massive round right to go build their thing out. Here are the two interesting things about Yuga labs and otherside a. They did a KYC offering, right? So you had to, you had to KYC, go through KYC to actually purchase this land. And it created this secondary market that was kind of underground to be able to purchase other people's KYC addresses. So you had people, just like, you had people promoting that they were buying up like 50, 60, 7100 KYC addresses to be able to buy this. So that created that kind of interesting secondary market around that, um, which, you know, that didn't really feel like a good thing.
00:30:45.084 - 00:31:28.202, Speaker A: Obviously, what Yuga Labs was trying to do with their KYC addresses is like, make it so that one user can get one plot of land, but that kind of fell through with the secondary market. And the second thing is they completely crashed Ethereum. So this was the craziest thing that's happened to Ethereum since probably cryptokitties broke down the blockchain in 2017. Gas prices were at like, what, 8000 GwEi or something like that. It was, I don't know, three, four, $5,000. And that has a lot of secondary impacts. Not only is that bad for kind of the smaller folks who can't pay $5,000 for a fee, which obviously is like most people, but it also really negatively impacts all the other, every single other company who's ever built something on Ethereum.
00:31:28.202 - 00:31:39.054, Speaker A: Well, now users can actually use your project, right, because, yeah, your database is completely clogged up. So what were your thoughts on the Yuga Labs land sale?
00:31:40.634 - 00:31:50.374, Speaker B: Terribly executed. I think they could have done certain things at the smart contract architecture that would have, like, severely reduced gas consumption.
00:31:52.914 - 00:32:03.210, Speaker A: I think it was 180 million was paid in ETH fees to the other side contract. Right. That's a 56% transaction fee based on what the 320 million raised.
00:32:03.402 - 00:32:16.654, Speaker B: No, it's crazy. And then they went down and said, oh, it's abundantly clear that Ethereum doesn't scale. We're gonna go on, like, launch our own. I'm like, guys, what are you talking about? Like, first, like, at least take a shot at, like, you know, designing something correctly.
00:32:16.994 - 00:32:17.514, Speaker A: It's.
00:32:17.594 - 00:32:43.540, Speaker B: I still concede partially that, like, we're not ready to go truly, truly mainstream. I mean, an l two environment. Yeah, but, but look, whatever. I don't know. We also constantly see these projects be pretty mercenary. They use Ethereum as a way to harness community and then they extract value by leaving. And, you know, anyone can do that in open source, it's fine.
00:32:43.540 - 00:32:58.676, Speaker B: But it's just from an. I don't know, it's like, sits well with me from an ethical perspective, loyalty perspective. So anyways, I understand they need to build a business and want to build a game, but they want to launch your own coin and l one, like, you know, ape chain go at it, you know?
00:32:58.780 - 00:33:13.776, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. So we, we have an episode dropping with framework with Vance and Michael from framework this coming Monday. And their thesis is that Yugalab should actually go fork their own l two. Well, I'd be curious to get your take on this. Is that the best strategy?
00:33:13.880 - 00:33:25.364, Speaker B: I think so, yeah. I mean, like, or, you know, I think there's still a lot to be done here, but, like, immutable x kind of did this. They forks. They were an implementation of software. So we can just go and do that.
00:33:25.784 - 00:33:30.928, Speaker A: Why do you have to fork an l two why not just go do this on optimism or arbitrum or something like that?
00:33:31.016 - 00:33:46.144, Speaker B: I guess you could. I'm not very sophisticated to understand perhaps some trade offs on the margin that they may want to just tinker on it and create their own. But theoretically, I mean, I think you can use arbitrum or optimism.
00:33:46.304 - 00:33:55.684, Speaker A: Yeah. Does this make you question whether or not Ethereum has long term, has staying power as like the long term settlement layer of crypto?
00:33:56.114 - 00:34:34.157, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I still have doubts about that. Like, to me it's not like abundantly clear, like 100% certainty. You know, I never think this way. Episodes like these do kind of like make you wonder, can we truly scale? And maybe, maybe it's just gonna take another five years of actual true deep, you know, research to get there. Um, because, okay, ethereum, back to your point around meltem saying that ethereum should continue to stay pravoric. Like the merge doesn't solve any of this. This is a reminder to people the moving of proof of stake doesn't solve any of this.
00:34:34.157 - 00:35:39.886, Speaker B: Meaning that the demand for blocks base keeps increasing and it creates this dynamic where, yeah, it's a free market of pricing gas and block space, but it creates, it's sort of like imposing New York style rent to all of America. Like, that's crazy. And l two s just are like creating suburbs to create different populations to, you know, not pay $3,000 a month on rent. So I think there was a really interesting episode with Olaf from, from Polychain. He, much like me, I believe in a multi chain world, I think we're going to probably see way more l two s in the next five years that we have seen today. And I think that's a good thing to allow for all these different projects to deploy, but at the same time use a settlement layer like Ethereum. I mean, I think Ethereum continues to be that leader relative to all the other l one s out there.
00:35:39.886 - 00:36:16.250, Speaker B: I mean, Solana is a few years behind. I mean, it has its own issues. It's still, and the team would concede it's still in beta, very much beta. And so, you know, again, these are, it's just a reminder for people like, these things take a lot of time. The Internet took really like 1520 years more than that to get to a place where you can stream video on your phone. And the problem now is that, you know, you always have these moments where the expectation is such that people want it and they want it now. They get a taste of nfts, they get a taste of what you could do in a decentralized context.
00:36:16.250 - 00:36:43.354, Speaker B: And it's really cool to be in these open source communities. The vision is there. They sell it as such. A lot of times, you know, knowingly or not, I mean, teams are promising this grand vision, but it's just like you gotta just constantly be a skeptic and say, yes, I probably believe that this is possible, but it's gonna take way longer than what we're probably allowing ourselves to do. And so you invert and you say, yeah, you probably should raise a bunch of capital to be able to get there.
00:36:43.514 - 00:37:10.174, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. I mean, it's an interesting notion, what you said at the beginning of this around you're basically applying New York rent to everywhere and that you'll end up having these suburbs created, which is kind of like, what, who is it, Haseeb who came on the show. Yeah. His thesis for different, different blockchains or different cities. I'd ask you, does minting an NFT on Ethereum kind of afford this additional value to the NFT? Right. Like if you minted an NFT on, on polygon, does it carry the same value?
00:37:11.044 - 00:38:06.718, Speaker B: No, not today. I mean, I think there's a big discrimination. I bought some NFTs in Polygon and said differently, you haven't seen, I think, floor prices on Polygon are on the aggregate much lower than in Ethereum. What it will be interesting to observe is that there are a few of these projects that are launching like blur, for instance, that is just an NFT aggregator, maybe that places emphasis around the actual collection itself and less on. Was it minted on Ethereum or avalanche or cosmos or Solana? No one cares. And if you're a creator, then yeah, you probably want to mint in the cheapest kind of environment in an l two, so that it's not as expensive for you to deploy the collection. And so who knows? Maybe in the next six months we won't even think about where that NFT is being minted today.
00:38:06.718 - 00:38:36.142, Speaker B: It very much matters because a lot of times punks were minted years ago and it was in Ethereum. That was the only game in town. And I think a lot of projects historically have tried to emulate that and say, okay, if all the artists are in Paris, in this salon, when I probably want to move to Paris and be there, because that's where, funny enough, that's where all the galleries are. We're in that state. But I think over time that probably fades.
00:38:36.278 - 00:39:09.234, Speaker A: Yeah, I think last thing on board apes before we move on is just there was actually an interesting proposal. Today, the Apecoin Dao approved a proposal to allocate 17.5% of the total apecoin supply to be distributed over the next three years via this ecosystem staking program. And so apecoin has a max supply of a billion tokens. And the rationale was like as a first step to apecoin becoming the preferred token of web three. This is a quote, early NFT adopters and existing and potential ecosystem participants should be incentivized. And I got to give Kobe credit here.
00:39:09.234 - 00:40:00.692, Speaker A: You know, Kobe said, quote, apecoin is legit voting to give away 20% of supply, or really 17 and a half percent of supply in, quote, fake staking program. Merely days after Yuga floated the idea of an ape led l one or l two, there's no discussion on whether that supply might be useful for actual staking if an l one or l two was built. We're just in the stage of more coins. Vote yes. And I think he makes a good point here, which is people don't realize how much thought went into creating bitcoin or creating ethereum or even some of these other competitor l one s where you really have to think about the economics. It feels like something like yuga labs with bored apes might just be kind of racing to make a lot of these decisions because they've got someone like Andreessen as an investor who's just like, build, build, build, let's blitz scale. Let's do this as quickly as possible.
00:40:00.692 - 00:40:10.052, Speaker A: In web two, that works because you're just trying to get more users. You're not creating economic systems in Web three, you're creating economies where you need to actually put a little more thought into it.
00:40:10.108 - 00:41:07.528, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a good point. I think it will be really interesting over the next five years, ten years, to understand which chains actually came out ahead the most. Because there is this camp of Ethereum purity, which it is decentralized decision making. Vitalik still wields a lot of power in the community, but there's different clusters like consensys and the Ethereum foundation, and I guess to some extent large ETH holders. But it feels very different than a project like Solana that is much more centralized at the decision product level, or even perhaps all the others like Avalanche and Polkadot. To some extent these are much more centralized organizations. And so, yeah, I think from a case study perspective, in the next 1020 years, it'd probably be something that we were going to look back and say what was the optimal place in that continuum of decentralization.
00:41:07.528 - 00:41:24.300, Speaker B: And what are the things that you should be decentralizing? Certainly governance, but not necessarily product development. And I think sometimes people lose sight of that and say, let's decentralize everything. You're like, wait a minute. No, like, absolutely not. But we know I have a view. But again, it's too early to tell.
00:41:24.372 - 00:41:53.618, Speaker A: Yeah. All right, so we recorded this episode with the head of Coinbase Cloud, Joe Laloos, who previously ran bison trails, before bison trails got acquired by Coinbase. I know you weren't able to make that episode, but it comes out next week. And one interesting thing that we talked about is Lido and just liquid staking. So right now, Lido has a 31.6% market share over staking and about a 90% market share over liquid staking. They basically have a monopoly on liquid staking right now.
00:41:53.618 - 00:41:56.410, Speaker A: Does this concern you folks?
00:41:56.442 - 00:42:41.124, Speaker B: Go? As a first investor in Lido, I was a parapy, so I have bias here. I think the team is actively trying to address this. What you have to remember, though, is that it is a consortium of a council that determines. It's not just one validator, it is a group of validators that come to Lido. And the lido kind of governance determines which validators are part of this kind of. I would almost call it like a safe whitelist of validators. So it's not to say that it's just one validator, like chorus one or staked, or staked later, but one validator entity that is getting all of that 31% of staked ETH.
00:42:41.124 - 00:43:59.164, Speaker B: So it's important, when people hear these figures, to appreciate that there is a whole set of underpinning. I think the role of Lido is to be like that router that determines that everyone that has been kind of approved whitelisted in the lido system is a credible validator that has a good track record, and the community assessed that. I'll point that out. And so, yeah, I mean, this goes back to one of the interesting discussions that I had. I was in the bankless podcast at the time where they were getting some criticism just being too ethereum centric, and it was Constantine, who was one of the founders of Lido, myself and the bankless team, Ryan and David, talking about Solana and Ethereum. And I'll just go on this quick rant, which is the criticisms that we hear from Solana is that the hardware requirements are really hard and onerous, and it creates this implicit idea, it creates this dynamic where only rich folks can be validators. And so therefore, it's difficult that not everyone can run a node with a raspberry PI in their house, which is what Ethereum allows.
00:43:59.164 - 00:45:06.224, Speaker B: Naturally, you might look at that and say, oh, Ethereum is one of, the Ethereum is just more egalitarian, sort of like a flat structure that anyone can be a validator. But the reality is, like, no one actually runs these things, and it's still very centralized. And so the point that I'm trying to make here is, from an architecture standpoint, it might be easy to run a validator, but that doesn't necessarily mean that you're gonna do it. And I think human structures, governance, if you look at, like, political participation in systems, even like corporate voting and activism, and certainly in political systems of elections, like, the turnover is really low for the most part. Like, humans don't like, not very active. And so when you, you ought to sort of, like, think that this is going to be how humans behave at the end of the day, like, everything is a social construct, and to reach consensus, like there are, there will always be, I think, a natural pull towards centralization, because participation will be low. Most people will not want to participate, will not take the time and the effort to be a validator, and they might, they would much rather outsource this to someone else.
00:45:06.224 - 00:45:32.394, Speaker B: And so then you say, well, how can we create this, this idea? How can we design systems that assume that there will be a race, there will be a natural gravitational pull towards centralization and then create wrappers and layers that that can mitigate an attack? And I think that's kind of like, I think the Lido team is acutely aware of that. And so, you know, yeah.
00:45:32.474 - 00:46:00.258, Speaker A: Does this centralize risk, though? Because, okay, so right now, Lido has 31.6 or 7% of the market share. At 33% of market share, they have a. They passed that 33% threshold. Right? So if something ever happened to Lido, Lido, like, this is the way I understand how Ethereum works, is that if more than 33% of the validators go offline, blocks stop finalizing. Right? And so let's say something happens with. So if they get 1.3%
00:46:00.258 - 00:46:08.066, Speaker A: more market share, and then something happens to lido, their validators, for some reason, go offline, blocks won't get produced.
00:46:08.250 - 00:46:35.538, Speaker B: If Lido goes down, that doesn't necessarily mean the validators go down. Like, there are multiple different validator companies, operators within the lido ecosystem. So the probability of all of them going down at the same time is not necessarily a smart contract bug. That affects Lido, that all of a sudden, everyone goes down. I'm pretty sure of that. But anyone listening that would want to contest that, please comment and we'll talk about it. And maybe we'll have the lido team on.
00:46:35.666 - 00:46:52.566, Speaker A: We'll have the lido team on. That'll fix this. Let's pivot away from talking about ETH. Let's talk about the terra ecosystem. For those who didn't see it, the new anchor semi dynamic earn rate when is now at 18%. Uh, it went from 19 and a half to 18%. Not, not that big of a deal.
00:46:52.566 - 00:47:30.732, Speaker A: Um, but I think the big announcement here is people have been questioning, like, is the anchor yield sustainable? What's going to happen with anchor? Um, here's, here's the update, is that rates are now going to be adjusted monthly based on the yield reserve performance. There's going to be a max monthly movement of one and a half percent, uh, with a floor of 15% apy and a 20% apy ceiling. Uh, on this note, deposits also just hit an all time high of $20 billion. Um, uh, and I mean, it's becoming pretty clear that, like, even at a lower rate, although I guess 18% is still high anchor still attracting a massive amount of capital.
00:47:30.828 - 00:47:33.268, Speaker B: So you're still beating inflation.
00:47:33.436 - 00:47:35.664, Speaker A: You're still. Yeah, yeah, slightly, slightly.
00:47:36.284 - 00:48:00.186, Speaker B: Um, by the way, speaking of inflation, just as an aside, like, can you believe coffee? Like, the inflation on coffee is off the rails. I mean, we always know that if you live in New York, you get totally ripped off by a cup of joe anywhere you go. But the coffee bean itself has been on this massive rant, a massive rally. So I'm feeling the pain, sir, because I drink more coffee than I care to admit.
00:48:00.290 - 00:48:02.890, Speaker A: Anything else you want to cover on this roundup?
00:48:03.002 - 00:48:34.702, Speaker B: The only thing I want to raise attention to is there is permissionless. Well, you always. I always save that for you at the end. But there are now a few kind of litigations that have ongoing towards defi protocols, and one of which came out recently that is pretty relevant for the DAO space, which says that. I think it was BZX got sued by the same people that are assuming pull together this law firm that is.
00:48:34.718 - 00:48:37.094, Speaker A: Like, are those the same people that are suing uniswap?
00:48:37.254 - 00:49:49.494, Speaker B: I'm not sure, actually, but basically what says is BZX was compromised, one of the keys were compromised, and so it led to, like, loss of funds, which BZX said that they were going to return to make whole affected users, but they still kind of went and sued them and they were suing everyone in the DAO, meaning the operators, which included the investors, and I think one of them was hashed and a few other VC's and the employees obviously of BZX. And their claim was, which is going to be, I think, a very interesting legal precedent here, which is that the veil, like the corporate veil under an LLC in a corporation, like the person liability kind of goes, is protected. And that's the whole point of why you'd want to. These structures are so important because it protects the operator, like personal liability. But now their claim was that because it's a Dao, that that no longer applies. And so anyone, everyone here is liable. And so I'm watching this very very closely to see how it is interpreted in the court of law because it might have pretty big implications on the Dao space as a whole.
00:49:49.954 - 00:49:54.464, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. One of our reporters, Ben Strak, had a really nice piece on it. If you guys want to learn more.
00:49:54.554 - 00:50:16.864, Speaker B: That, that's the one I was actually looking at. So we'll link that to the show notes. This is something to definitely watch. Um, these are the kind of things that I, I pay most attention to because it could imagine. Imagine if a court rules that, yeah, everyone's liable. Like, there's no like, like this personal liability. I mean if you're involved in a dow, like you sure, so should be paying attention to this if you're an investor, if you're not.
00:50:17.284 - 00:50:37.636, Speaker A: Right. And here's, here, here's the key line from uh, from their lawyer. Right. From the attorney is that means each of the partners is jointly and liable to the plaintiffs and must make good on the full amount of its debts. Right. So you've got the defendants here, BZX protocol, co founders Kyle and Tom. Investors hashed age crypto b zero x.
00:50:37.636 - 00:50:41.988, Speaker A: They created the Dow. Right. And now the, they're saying that they're liable for it. So.
00:50:42.116 - 00:51:23.334, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, definitely. I know there's a lot of really good consortiums within crypto that are putting up a good fight and making sure that this gets. Treat it correctly. But I think. Look, going back to the original question, I think this is nonstanding, important for the space where it's gone sufficiently large that it is attracting this attention, which obviously is not fun, but I think it's just a symbol of this industry, cedar stay. And we need to create these precedents around daos, around treatment of tokens and a whole number of things. But I think that is just in my back of my mind this is just telling you, it's almost really the way these asset classes get created.
00:51:23.334 - 00:51:46.622, Speaker B: Right. There's new standards and legal rulings and things that need to be created to address at the same. Innovation needs to be met also with legal innovation. And I think that's what we're seeing here. So it's encouraging, but also super important. And also, I know it can be really stressful in the space where we constantly climb these walls of worry, but, you know.
00:51:46.758 - 00:52:04.030, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm going to one last piece of news, and then we'll talk about permissionless for a second. Is the Fairfax pension. Shout out to the Fairfax pension. They. I remember being in the room. Yeah, in the room with pomp when he said, holy shit, I think we just closed a pension. And it was him and Mark Usko.
00:52:04.030 - 00:52:14.956, Speaker A: Um, and they were one of the first, I might've been the first pension to actually publicly allocate to, uh, to crypto. They got them to put half a percent of their portfolio into crypto, into the Morgan Creek fund.
00:52:15.150 - 00:52:19.792, Speaker B: These are firefighters. Right in Pennsylvania, police, police in Virginia.
00:52:19.848 - 00:52:53.212, Speaker A: Yeah, I see. Yeah. They then got them to double it, so then it was 1% of their portfolio. This is back in 2019. And now here we are, 2022, and it just got announced that crypto is now 8% of the pensions portfolio and they're considering allocating to. The title of the article is a little clickbait baity because it said pensions starting to think about yield farming, but if you read the fine print, they're thinking about allocating to two different funds that deploy yield farming strategies. But, man, it just, I think, goes to show, like, once you.
00:52:53.212 - 00:53:03.308, Speaker A: It's kind of like moving your dollars into stable coins. Like, once you enter into crypto, it's really hard to go back. So big shout out to Fairfax pension for pulling the trigger on that.
00:53:03.476 - 00:53:04.420, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:53:04.572 - 00:53:14.694, Speaker A: Yeah. All right, quick shout out to permissionless. But before we do that, I just want to tell you, this is actually the four year anniversary of blockworks.
00:53:14.814 - 00:53:15.534, Speaker B: Oh, wow.
00:53:15.654 - 00:53:27.902, Speaker A: Yeah, so that was. I just got. I just got a ping about that for my calendar. So, four year anniversary. I'm realizing that this might have been the day I actually quit my job at a company called sisense to go full time with blockworks. So, yeah.
00:53:27.958 - 00:53:28.454, Speaker B: Wow.
00:53:28.574 - 00:53:28.830, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:53:28.862 - 00:53:32.046, Speaker B: It probably has felt like 20 years, but, you know, it's a combination of.
00:53:32.070 - 00:53:47.128, Speaker A: 20 years and, like, six days. So it's like, either time is flying or, like, time is going really, really long. So, yeah, man. Um, really excited. Permissionless, if you guys aren't attending. Uh, we are almost actually sold out on tickets, so. Almost sold out on tickets.
00:53:47.128 - 00:54:16.264, Speaker A: Um, you guys should really go. We hear some of the speakers. Chris Dixon, do quan, kathryn rue Wu, vlad tenev, uh, is leaking a bunch of alpha on stage at a keynote. Uh, him and Mike are talking, I think it's on the first day, about some of Robin Hood's strategies and damn, that's going to be a good panel. Jiho from axie uniswap Labs, Justin drake, haseeb, Nick Carter, legion of variant polygons coming out. Eric Peters at one river, stani from ave. This guy named santiago.
00:54:16.264 - 00:54:26.892, Speaker A: We've got you x paraphy. We got to change that to institutional angel. We got Kyle samani for multicoin. Yeah, I guess you are. You are. Yeah. Christine moy, big shout out.
00:54:26.892 - 00:54:48.520, Speaker A: Just became head of crypto at Apollo. Vance from framework, head of CBDCs at Visa, Kane from Synthetix, avichal at electric, the chief product officer of coinbase. The list goes on and on. So if you are not attending, you should definitely attend. If you don't like the content, come for the parties. We've got Blau, please and thank you. Some really amazing DJ's.
00:54:48.520 - 00:55:02.390, Speaker A: And if you hate DJ's, you hate content, come for the NFT gallery. We got Des Bryant coming out giving a really amazing talk about what he's doing. Life after football. We've got trippie Labs coming out and big shout out to opensea for sponsoring the NFT gallery.
00:55:02.552 - 00:55:06.402, Speaker B: The content, is that going to be made available like weeks later, months later?
00:55:06.538 - 00:55:07.554, Speaker A: It will be. Yeah.
00:55:07.634 - 00:55:12.134, Speaker B: Okay, great, great. Yeah, you should all come. I'll be there and I'm excited.
00:55:12.554 - 00:55:27.786, Speaker A: It will selectively. So we'll probably release maybe the best five panels, but for anyone who wants to get access to all of it, no, you're gonna have to attend. I think we'll maybe live stream it behind. Like, if you hit our website, you might have to put in your email and we'll give you a call if.
00:55:27.810 - 00:55:46.960, Speaker B: You have some sort of NFT tier that you could just unlock that content using live here or something. I don't know. Like, you just like connect your metamask and like, to stream and like. Or maybe like drape with super fluid. Like, you'll pay on you go as you go. Like, I don't think it'd be. That's kind of the useful utility around NFTs that I get excited about.
00:55:47.032 - 00:55:56.814, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah, very much so. So speaking of NFTs, the only way to get a vip pass is to snag a permy. So jump into the permy community, join Santi and me, and we will see you there.
00:55:56.894 - 00:56:02.926, Speaker B: Awesome, my friend. It's good to be. Good to be back. Hopefully we'll live to see another day in crypto. Up, down. We'll still be here. We'll still be here next week.
00:56:02.926 - 00:56:08.038, Speaker B: And we're going to permissionless, so hope everyone's doing all right out there. Don't get liquidated, and we'll see you next week.
00:56:08.086 - 00:56:08.614, Speaker A: See you next week.
