00:00:00.120 - 00:00:06.998, Speaker A: Like, I'm not trading around the merge or anything like that, but I am kind of setting myself up to maximize profit around the merge.
00:00:07.006 - 00:00:07.958, Speaker B: That's your distinction.
00:00:08.086 - 00:00:28.644, Speaker A: Yeah. And here's kind of what I'm doing. This episode is brought to you by core, the brand new non custodial wallet that offers a seamless and secure experience on avalanche. You'll hear more about core later in the show. What's going on, everyone? Welcome back to another episode of Empire. We got the roundup. We got Santi.
00:00:28.644 - 00:00:37.876, Speaker A: Hope you guys all had a really good week. We are one week out from the merge, so we're going to spend a lot of time talking about the merge, talking about how Santi and I have positioned ourselves. But before we do that, Santi, how we feel, my friend.
00:00:37.980 - 00:00:40.164, Speaker B: Doing great. Good to be here. How are you?
00:00:40.244 - 00:00:45.996, Speaker A: Good. Good. What. What's, uh. I feel like you're in, like, a chipper mood today. I feel like you're in a really good mood.
00:00:46.140 - 00:00:58.662, Speaker B: No, you know, just, uh. There's a lot of. I mean, it's kind of surreal that the merger is going to happen next week, and, uh, there's some good stuff happening today on the crypto side of things, and so, yeah, it's always.
00:00:58.838 - 00:00:59.554, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:01:00.934 - 00:01:03.902, Speaker B: What's not to be, you know, like, yeah, I'm gonna get a good way.
00:01:03.918 - 00:01:05.702, Speaker A: To end the week, you know, recording this thing.
00:01:05.838 - 00:01:14.630, Speaker B: I like recording the days that we record. We always typically record on Thursday. Thursdays are one of the best days of the week because you're closer to Friday. It just feels. It's a nice day.
00:01:14.782 - 00:01:25.188, Speaker A: What is, like, your ideal week or ideal day? Like, are you in meetings? Are you investing? Are you, like, how much time you spending working? Do you, like, work out? What's, like, a day in the life of Santi?
00:01:25.236 - 00:02:08.304, Speaker B: Oh, boy. Well, is this a gonna be an episode about that? Well, I don't want to make an episode about that, but I typically like to reserve and carve out. The morning is just alone time, me time. I love to read multiple newspapers and then also what's going on in crypto and check, you know, across a variety of sources, crypto, Twitter, and Telegram, and, yeah, I keep the morning to just exercise and just reading and try not to have any meetings. And then I stack meetings most of the time just talking to existing teams and new teams, and I've had a really good set of over the last three weeks. I've been telling, you know, a number of times, but I've had really interesting discussions of teams building, things that I've like haven't thought about or just new use cases and I'm like, oh, this is pretty interesting. Like pretty crazy, pretty out there.
00:02:08.304 - 00:02:22.532, Speaker B: But like I'm always getting really excited about teams that are think crypto founders or people coming into the space are not shy in their ambitions and it's always really exciting to kind of see that even everything that's going on. So.
00:02:22.588 - 00:02:53.426, Speaker A: Yeah, by the way, so speaking of teams that we're excited about, I remember like three episodes ago or two episodes ago we talked about a web3 CRM. You remember that? We kind of put out this like call to action. I was like, this should exist. So I got like probably ten 1112 DM's looked at a bunch of twelve teams building this, end up getting on calls with five different teams. I'm going to write one check. There's one team that was just amazing. I'll have to introduce you to them.
00:02:53.426 - 00:03:18.142, Speaker A: But what you can do with is a combination of, if you know, looker or tableau, these business intelligence tools. It's a looker meets a zoom info for contact Discovery. So it's like Zoom info meets looker meets a CRM, like Salesforce HubSpot. It's really interesting. They're already working with a couple protocols. Yeah, it's really, really interesting.
00:03:18.198 - 00:04:04.722, Speaker B: So that's fascinating. Yeah. When you think about it, like if you're a marketer, if you're someone that's not really deep into crypto, just think about it this way. Blockchains are super data rich and the amount of information that you can extract from that and then take it and glean a lot of insights is going to be super explosive. I think that a lot of people are kind of not realizing that. And from a marketing standpoint, if you're a consumer brand and you can mint nfts to your user base and then see everything else that they're doing is, and we talk about privacy here too, which is important. But as things stand, it's pretty crazy what you could do just by mining, just by looking and gathering insights from like etherscan or some of the block explorers.
00:04:04.722 - 00:04:05.654, Speaker B: It's awesome.
00:04:05.954 - 00:04:14.706, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, exactly. We'll put a link in the show notes. There's this guy, Tomas Tungus. I don't actually know really what he does, but laid out he's a vc.
00:04:14.730 - 00:04:15.810, Speaker B: At Redpoint, I think.
00:04:15.962 - 00:04:44.774, Speaker A: Got it. Okay. He laid out, he has this good blog post on the web3 marketing stack, the next big wave in crypto. And he diagrams it all out from the advertiser flows into the analytics flows into segmentations, CRM flows into the segmentation. You've got the blockchain data infrastructure. I don't think that these, like, building the crypto native web3. I don't think they're going to be directly analogous to like, I don't think the next CRM for crypto is going to look like a salesforce or HubSpot.
00:04:44.774 - 00:04:48.070, Speaker A: Um, but I'm. But I'm starting to get really excited about it, so. Yeah.
00:04:48.102 - 00:04:48.470, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely.
00:04:48.502 - 00:04:59.478, Speaker A: All right, so we got the merge coming up. We got. The merge is predicted to occur between the 13th and the 15th. Are you taking any bets? Are you like, how are you positioning yourself? Are you just holding Ethan and riding it?
00:04:59.566 - 00:05:44.942, Speaker B: Yeah, business as usual. I think I'm going to leave the arbitrage and acrobatics and to more sophisticated players, which I'm not one of. And this reminds me a lot of, there have been prior instances. And look, Robert from compound has a great tweet thread that says, guys, beware, don't try to get cute or creative. There's going to be probably a lot of volatility, a lot of maybe actors out there that are going to try to scam you. Just, just my best advice, and I don't like giving advice, but in this case I will because I feel like the right thing to do for, like, 99.9% of everyone out there is just like, sit tight, don't act on impulse when things get out of control.
00:05:44.942 - 00:06:22.388, Speaker B: And look, things might can be, I don't think they'll be, like, super orderly. Even though certain protocols like Abby have taken, I think, the right measures and steps and we'll talk about what those are. But if you're just a normal user, just kind of like, sit tight because I feel like, and you've, you've done some things, Jason, that you should talk about just for the normal user that you can do today. But in and around that event, I wouldn't try to get cute or creative around, like, trying to maximize and squeeze profit and try to, like, get the most amount of, like, ETH Pow. And then swap them for, like, ETH or USDC. It's just. Yeah, yeah.
00:06:22.476 - 00:06:50.460, Speaker A: All right. I know you're not getting cute with it, but if you were to get cute with it, here, here are a couple of things. No, no. Here are a couple of things that I'm. That I'm doing and that I think folks should probably be thinking about with their ETH and spend some time this weekend, like, kind of setting themselves up well, I actually don't think you really necessarily, like, I'm not trading around the merge or anything like that, but I am kind of setting myself up to maximize profit around me. Yeah, and here's kind of what I'm doing. So, like, the first thing is like, figure out where you hold your crypto.
00:06:50.460 - 00:07:21.944, Speaker A: So if you hold your crypto on an exchange, if you hold your ETH on an exchange, the first thing to do would probably be to check to figure out whether or not the exchange supports the fork. So again, as a reminder, ETH is going through this upgrade. It transitions from proof of work to proof of stake. After the transition, ETH miners can no longer mine. So what the miners are doing is they're forking ETH, keeping this proof of work version so they can continue mining. There are a couple of things you can do to get the ETH proof of work token. The first thing is you have to hold ETH on a wallet that supports the fork.
00:07:21.944 - 00:08:01.900, Speaker A: The easiest thing would probably be to have full custody of your ETH on a hardware wallet, like a ledger. If you're holding ETH on an exchange, you may or may not get the fork token. The first thing is if you are holding your ETH on an exchange. I think some exchanges are either already putting out policies or will put out policies whether or not you'll get the fork tokens. For anyone who remembers the bitcoin forks of like 2017, 2018, you usually do. Like some exchanges, like I remember Coinbase supported a lot of those forks in that they would give you the, they would airdrop you the tokens, but it would usually take like three or four or five or sometimes six months. So keep that in mind, is even if an exchange you would have was.
00:08:01.932 - 00:08:24.946, Speaker B: Lost out on pretty, the time value money there was high in that current, very high. There are some exchanges already have IOU's, and like the implied market cap of ETH Pow is like one to 2% of the Ethereum market cap. So that if you back into that, it's kind of like 13, $15. Yeah, but, yeah, yeah, so, okay, so.
00:08:24.970 - 00:08:55.928, Speaker A: That'S the first thing to do is like figure out where you're holding your ETH. Hopefully you know that already, and then figure out what the policy is if you're holding it on an exchange. Like are they going to give you that, the proof of work tokens? The second thing is bridge all your tokens back to the ETH main net. So this is important. You are not going to get any ETH proof of work for your ETH that's held on like optimism. Arbitrum, polygon, any other L2 scaling solutions. It's probably a good idea to move back to the main net before the merge to get those ETH proof of work tokens.
00:08:55.928 - 00:09:25.762, Speaker A: That's the second thing. The third thing is probably unwrap all your weth or we, I still don't know how to pronounce it wrapped ETH w ETH to ETH. There's like, there's probably going to be a dex on the new ETH proof of work chain that will help you unwrap your wrapped e proof of work token. But like it's going to be probably a pretty unstable ecosystem. I would just unwrap it before the merge. I would unwrap it before the merge. So that's the third thing.
00:09:25.762 - 00:09:49.116, Speaker A: The fourth thing is remove liquidity from protocols. You are not going to get any ETH proof of work tokens for ETH that's being used to provide liquidity. So probably a good idea to with, unless you're getting crazy rates somewhere, you should probably withdraw now and provide liquidity again after the merge. And you have to assume there's going to be a big liquidity crunch on protocols in the coming week as more.
00:09:49.140 - 00:10:11.478, Speaker B: Folks do this again, that might have some tax implications. Folks, if you're using AAvE is different than if you're using maker and some other protocols. So anytime you're yanking liquidity out of a protocol, you know, this is not tax advice, but just bear in mind that sometimes it has tax implications depending on your jurisdiction. So yeah, it's important to talk to the tax man.
00:10:11.526 - 00:10:12.354, Speaker A: Coming through.
00:10:13.134 - 00:10:16.886, Speaker B: I feel like a lot of times. No, no, it's a, like if you're, if you're converting.
00:10:16.950 - 00:10:19.904, Speaker A: I just finished, I finished my crypto taxes and it was not.
00:10:20.014 - 00:10:20.892, Speaker B: There you go.
00:10:21.068 - 00:10:22.236, Speaker A: Not a pretty sight.
00:10:22.420 - 00:10:50.688, Speaker B: It's important, my understanding is, and we'll have to have the token tax guys here to sag, who does great work there, and I've used them and this is not a paid endorsement or anything. They've just helped me a lot, is when you deposit your ETH and aave, it gets converted into a ETH. Right. And that is a token conversion event that is taxable, which is different than wrapping, um, your token, which is not. So, uh, just bear that in mind.
00:10:50.856 - 00:10:53.176, Speaker A: Is that what you use Santi for taxes is token?
00:10:53.240 - 00:11:06.764, Speaker B: Well, I mean, I've used like the three different providers at once. Um, but one of them was token tax because again, like you want to compare and make sure. That, like, uh, it's very comprehensive. Yeah. But, yeah, token tax is pretty good.
00:11:07.064 - 00:11:31.262, Speaker A: Okay, so those are the steps that I would do to set yourself up for success. It's pretty easy things if you want to get cute with it. As Sandy was saying, uh, you could borrow ETH from aven compound. So you're going to get any. There's going to be basically like a snapshot, I think. So you're going to get ETH proof of work for any ETH that's held during the snapshot. This what some, what actually a lot of folks are doing is they're saying, okay, there's going to be this snapshot that looks at how much ETH I have held at the merge.
00:11:31.262 - 00:11:58.140, Speaker A: This means it probably makes sense to borrow as much ETH as humanly possible, uh, which is now starting to happen. Uh, you're seeing rates on aave and compound go up to, like 30, 35, 40%. Uh, um, you can get cuter. You can, like, monitor the steeth to ETH market. You could buy or sell steeth as we get closer to the merge, um, depending on what the kind of so called peg is doing. Um, but that, that, now that's getting cute with it.
00:11:58.292 - 00:12:01.996, Speaker B: Yeah, well, that, that's unique thing that, uh, is worth noting. I mean, we'll just jump to it.
00:12:02.020 - 00:12:02.252, Speaker A: The.
00:12:02.308 - 00:12:39.950, Speaker B: What's been happening in the steth ETH lending market is pretty interesting. Um, this week there was a big sell off and spike in the aave ETH borrow rates. And that puts pressure on the steady ETH peg, because there's been, I guess a number of market participants have been playing kind of this recursive leverage trade, which you deposit steth on aave, you borrow more ETH, and you buy Steth, and you kind of rinse, repeat. But as, as rates go up, you know, that puts pressure. Right. And so it's. I would just, it's just an interesting tidbit, like the peg went down to, or the rate, I shouldn't call it just went down because it shouldn't be pegged ever.
00:12:40.022 - 00:12:41.102, Speaker A: Yeah, it's not, it's not.
00:12:41.158 - 00:13:16.334, Speaker B: It's not a peg, but the rate st ETH fell off the way to 0.95, and that's been its lowest level since, kind of the fallout of three arrows. And after Terra was putting pressure on Ste, and it fell all the way down to 0.93. So that was, this is the second lowest level since then. And it's hovering currently around 0.96, which I actually think is pretty decent rate if you think about kind of the, the duration and kind of the liquidity discount that these things should have.
00:13:16.994 - 00:13:28.322, Speaker A: But, yeah, so you got to expect folks are selling steeth to get back into ETH right now. Right. So that means the, so that will drive it lower. That'll drive steeth lower, which there's probably a nice arbitrage play there.
00:13:28.418 - 00:13:30.498, Speaker B: Yeah, there's some selling pressure.
00:13:30.546 - 00:13:30.706, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:13:30.730 - 00:14:10.070, Speaker B: On Steve and, yeah, I mean, I think it's just interesting to monitor ETH borrow rates around this time. I mean, they went all the way, as you said, up to 35%. Yeah. So, you know, monitor during this time, we should link to Robert Leshner's thread on Twitter, which is you probably should be really cautious around the new ETH proof of work chain. Most market, most kind of big players have come out. This is like most exchanges from like, Coinbase to circles like center circle, crack and even opensea. Like most folks have come out saying, we're not going to support the ETH proof of work chain.
00:14:10.070 - 00:14:37.928, Speaker B: And so what is important is anytime, if you are interacting with, say, and you can correct me here, but, for instance, a lot of people might see this, okay, you. You have 100 x amount of ETH. You get ETH proof of work. You go on to that chain and you say, oh, wow, look, I have this. I want. I want to, you know, profit and sell these tokens. You're interacting in that chain.
00:14:37.928 - 00:15:05.114, Speaker B: If you sign a transaction there, just be cautious what you're interacting with because a miner there might be able or wanting to replicate that transaction in the, like, ETH proof of stake chain. And so I don't know the exact kind of vector here that they could exploit it. But it's just important to, like, be really cautious and probably, probably like, sit tight and not too much.
00:15:06.054 - 00:15:26.590, Speaker A: That's a, that's a good flag, Santi, because, okay, so you remember, you remember the bitcoin fork. So you had bitcoin cash, obviously. Then you get like, all these other ones. You got like, bitcoin gold, bitcoin diamond, bitcoin, bitcoin hot. You had oil, bitcoin, bitcoin smart united bitcoin, bit b, two x, segwit, bitcoin cash. Plus you had lightning. You had all these heart.
00:15:26.590 - 00:15:55.706, Speaker A: You had all these forks, right? So if you like, okay, so if you hold ETH on a non custodial wallet, you're going to be eligible for every fork token, which is good. You think that's good. What is not good and where it gets risky is, and this might have been what Leshner was referring to is you shouldn't just go. A lot of people will be like, ooh, new fork. Things have just fallen into my wallet. There's going to be a lot of scams that people are basically just dropping into wallets. Don't just don't go.
00:15:55.706 - 00:16:01.454, Speaker A: Just like claiming all the airdrops. There's probably gonna be a lot of scams trying to get at signatures and keys.
00:16:02.074 - 00:16:02.458, Speaker B: Correct.
00:16:02.506 - 00:16:11.610, Speaker A: And I know that happened in 2017 and 2018 with the bitcoin forks, and it's four years later now. So I can only imagine how sophisticated some of these forks, some of these scammers are gonna be.
00:16:11.682 - 00:16:54.924, Speaker B: I mean, probably the best course of action is hold out of it, see what other people are doing. Don't be the guinea pig, don't, don't be in the front line. And if you want to, if you're holding it in a, in your, in your own kind of wallet, not in exchange, then be careful when you're like transferring these tokens. But yeah, look, it's going to be a very interesting time. The more I don't want to lose sight of the big picture here, which is, look, guys, finally Ethereum is migrating to purpose stake. Yeah, there's a big upgrade. What is the Bellatrix update that happened this week of a lot of the clients? It was the last step before the merge.
00:16:54.924 - 00:17:38.643, Speaker B: And so all in all, really exciting. And we shouldn't lose the forest for the trees. The most important thing is, I think this is a really good setup for Ethereum, price aside, speculation aside, just fundamentally, this has been in the works for years, for years. And I think it is a very positive transition to Ethereum and lends a lot of credibility, as we've talked about in prior episodes on the narrative shifting. A lot of really, institutions kind of taking now perhaps more actionable from the ESG standpoint. It's just, I think, really a positive step in the Ethereum camp, which, whether it's correlation or causation. But it is pretty interesting that we are like 90% plus upside in Ethereum for the full flipping.
00:17:38.643 - 00:18:12.712, Speaker B: The ETH BTC ratio has been on a tear and it is traded to the highest level since 2018. And so, yeah, it's pretty interesting that we are closer to the flippening than ever. And the momentum, I think, is very much on Ethereum side. Now, a lot of things could be derailed, there could be a lot of momentum traders out there, but nonetheless, I mean, I think it's difficult to understand all the factors that go into this kind of rally. But I think a big part of it is Ethereum is finally migrating and a lot of people are observing that.
00:18:12.868 - 00:18:27.760, Speaker A: Yeah, it's interesting that the. That the ETH BTC ratio. I've just got this pulled up on trading view. Let's see if I can share right here. It's interesting that this ratio is so high. Here you go. It's so high in the bear market.
00:18:27.760 - 00:18:35.640, Speaker A: Right. So if you look at when this. When it got so high the last time, so it was up to, you know, it did. Did it flip? No. What am I looking at here?
00:18:35.752 - 00:18:46.462, Speaker B: No, no. When. Well, it went on the market cap basis. Like, it should never go. Like, the flipping doesn't occur at one. The flipping occurs on market cap basis. And so that is.
00:18:46.558 - 00:19:02.094, Speaker A: Yeah, so the highest it got was in 2017, in July, and then again in like January of 2018. Right. So, like, right after the peak of the bull. So it's interesting now that this is happening, like 910 eleven months into the bear market.
00:19:02.254 - 00:19:20.974, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, definitely. So, I mean, look, I think Ethereum's market cap, fully diluted. Well, market cap, current market cap right now is like 196,000,000,000 and bitcoins is 368 billion. So Ethereum is like at 53%. And so. Yeah, yeah.
00:19:21.354 - 00:19:22.734, Speaker A: Moving on from the merge.
00:19:23.074 - 00:19:27.418, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't think there's anything else to discuss here other than, you know, obviously we'll be covering a lot next.
00:19:27.466 - 00:19:57.648, Speaker A: Week, but, yeah, let's talk about. I don't want to turn this into the maker show, but I do feel like there's a lot of interesting stuff happening on maker right now. So I will continue talking about maker, and if it gets to be too much, too much, folks should just tweet at us or dm us and let us know. But I do think there's really interesting things. Um. Uh, there is a maker Coinbase prime proposal. So Coinbase basically made a proposal for Maker to transfer 33%, uh, of Maker's PSM into Coinbase prime's custody, uh, to earn 1.5%
00:19:57.648 - 00:20:16.524, Speaker A: API on USDC rewards. That's 33% of the PSM, would be a. About $1.6 billion. Why that's interesting for Maker and why that probably makes a lot of sense for Maker is because they've got all this USDC that they're not actually earning anything on. So if you look at 1.5% of 1.6
00:20:16.524 - 00:21:02.836, Speaker A: billion, that's an additional 24 million in revenue that Maker could be earning every year. Maker's governance would be able to freely mint burn, withdraw, settle almost instantaneously. In USDC, it's like five or six minutes, which is consistent with Coinbase prime standard offering. And, um, yeah, I mean, I think so. So like, like, this is what we talked about. This is what we've been talking about, right? There's this huge dichotomy, I think, in crypto right now between, uh, what I'd call focusing on decentralization maximization to avoid sense, to become censorship resistant with the downside of losing out on maybe some total addressable market that you could capture. The other side of the argument is just race to acquire users capital.
00:21:02.836 - 00:21:22.372, Speaker A: Um, and just try to get as big as possible and maybe sacrifice some of the decentralization. And this propos. And we've been talking about this and last week we said this is the biggest dichotomy in crypto right now. And this is such a good example of it. Right? You've got some folks at maker, like, of course we should do this. This is an extra $24 million a year. It basically costs us nothing.
00:21:22.372 - 00:21:32.162, Speaker A: Uh, and then other folks like Chris Blacker, saying, there's no way we should do this. We are getting away from Defi. So I'm curious to hear your take on what you think of this.
00:21:32.298 - 00:21:52.562, Speaker B: Well, you're deeper in a maker, so maybe I'll just ask a few questions and then I'll, like, you'll see where I'm going with this is like, what is. So I get it, 1.5% of APy, fine. But what is like a, does maker have. Okay, fine. It's nice to get 1.5% on this size, 24 million.
00:21:52.562 - 00:22:09.714, Speaker B: It could go to a bunch of things. But are there alternatives? Like what is being done with the PSM today? And could you be doing it and depositing in a way that is not using kind of, you know, not going to Coinbase, if you will.
00:22:09.874 - 00:22:42.760, Speaker A: I mean, you could buy, you could buy treasuries, but, and get like higher than 1.5%. But your, but that's like less crypto native, that's more off chain. But also keep in mind, like USDC. USDC is an IOU backed by off chain assets that is managed by circle. So you're already like, I think, okay, so you look at Maker, you've got like, look at the balance sheet of Maker, you've got like assets and liabilities. The assets of the liabilities of Maker are die. The assets are the PSM and the user vaults.
00:22:42.760 - 00:23:15.114, Speaker A: The user vaults are users own those assets. Maker can't touch them. The PSM is maker owns those assets, maker can invest them, and they should probably only invest them in, like, really, really, really safe instruments like treasuries and bonds and things like that. Right. And that's what USDC is in, is in the PSM right now. I think the argument for doing this is that this is no riskier than just holding USDC. The current structure of the DAI that is generated from the USDC PSM looks like kind of.
00:23:15.114 - 00:23:27.902, Speaker A: I mean, you're already using USDC, which is an iou backed by all assets managed by. Managed by circle. Right. I guess you are saying you're taking on the risk of. Well, you're adding one more layer, which is Coinbase. Yeah.
00:23:27.918 - 00:24:11.286, Speaker B: The custodian risk, custodial risk, which, by the way, the keys could still be compromised in the ps. Like, there is risks of being. Holding your own kind of assets and being your own custodian. There is a risk of Coinbase, Coinbase custody. I am curious because this came out in surface a few months back, which is, and I'm not sure if depositors in the custody accounts are like. Like subprime like, meaning, like, they are not creditors of Coinbase. So if Coinbase were to default or like, go bankrupt, you, as a client like maker, could stand to lose that if they're right, because they're technically, like, not a creditor.
00:24:11.286 - 00:24:49.794, Speaker B: It's just like a client. And so I think, like, Armstrong came out saying, like, yeah, our customers, like, in a scenario where Coinbase were to go to bankrupt, like, you are taking counterparty risk. And so, well, you know, you. You are adding on that layer. But yeah, you're right. I mean, I think, like, you have USDC today that could be frozen if you like, in an extreme scenario, whether it's in your own wallet or in Coinbase's custody wallet, it doesn't really matter. The only risk incremental here is some marginal kind of, well, some incremental counterparty risk, which is you have to trust Coinbase and their custody.
00:24:49.794 - 00:25:14.162, Speaker B: Now, a third of the PSM is. I mean, it's not all of it, at least. So you're diversifying a bit. And so I do wonder how much you're getting in those short term t bills that they bought not too long ago. But it's probably comparable, right? It's like, not too dissimilar from this rate. Even the rates are getting all over the place.
00:25:14.298 - 00:25:29.234, Speaker A: Probably higher. Yeah, I think it's probably two and a half, or I think it's probably three sub three over two somewhere. Between two and a half and 3% AP would have. Yeah, yeah. Interest rates are going up, my friend.
00:25:29.694 - 00:25:48.074, Speaker B: Noted. Yeah, fully noted. The european kind of central bank just hiked 75 basis points, which is why. But yeah, no, I. This is going to be interesting. Do you think it passes?
00:25:49.194 - 00:25:53.854, Speaker A: I think this passes, yes, I definitely think this passes, yeah.
00:25:54.434 - 00:26:00.374, Speaker B: Do you think they're getting the best rate here? And could they negotiate with Coinbase to get a higher APY?
00:26:00.674 - 00:26:13.654, Speaker A: That's what I said. I posted on the forum. I said, I like all this. This is great work from the growth team and from Coinbase. Really like it. Chris Black would probably tear me apart here and probably disagree with me on this one, but I was like, I like it. It's providing a bunch of revenue.
00:26:13.654 - 00:26:29.062, Speaker A: I think the 1.5% is. What I post on the forum is that 1.5% seems low. I think what someone might say to me is that maybe two responses. Who was it in the discord? I said, it's low too. And Luca Prosperi, who's great.
00:26:29.062 - 00:26:48.774, Speaker A: Really, really like the guy, he's like, look, it's better than 0%. He's like, we got to do something. This is a good short term solution till we figure out a better solution. And then some other folks said, look, where else can you get 1.5%? Still being crypto, kind of like crypto native, keeping it in the ecosystem.
00:26:50.594 - 00:26:54.954, Speaker B: And my question here is, I'm unfamiliar.
00:26:54.994 - 00:26:55.574, Speaker A: But.
00:26:57.514 - 00:27:21.194, Speaker B: When you invest in t bills, they're fairly, I guess, fairly safe or the safest in the risk spectrum, in the centralized risk spectrum, I should say. But do we have an insight into what Coinbase prime and how, what they're going to be doing? Like are they buying, what kind of assets are they going to be buying? And is it further out on the risk curve?
00:27:21.614 - 00:27:43.898, Speaker A: Alright, folks, this episode is brought to you by our friends at Avalanche and Ava Labs. They have just dropped a new crypto wallet called core. You're going to be hearing a lot about it over the coming months. You can now be one of the first to try it out. Here's the reason I'm excited to partner with them on empire right now. Crypto wallets and browser extensions, they feel clunky, they feel non intuitive. That's why Ava labs built core.
00:27:43.898 - 00:28:17.730, Speaker A: It's a free, non custodial browser extension that gives Avalanche users a seamless and secure web3 experience across the entire avalanche ecosystem. Here are a few reasons to try core. Here's what I'm experimenting with. Number one, Core has intuitive dashboards with a unified display for all of your NFT collections, all your crypto assets. You can execute asset swaps directly inside the wallet. It's a really nice experience. Maybe you want to earn yield or borrow against your bitcoin, but you don't want to do it on one of those c five platforms right now.
00:28:17.730 - 00:28:46.868, Speaker A: Core's native bridging functionality makes it really easy to bridge your bitcoin to Avalanche's robust defi ecosystem. Last but not least, core makes on ramping super easy. You can convert dollars to crypto right now using the moonpay integration. Just takes a few clicks. Download core today using the link in the show notes it's really, really nice. If you are interested in the avalanche ecosystem at all, you have to be using core. Download core using the link below.
00:28:46.868 - 00:29:21.976, Speaker A: Now let's get back to the show. Ooh, thats the best question. Thats the question that hasnt been answered in my mind, which is the most important question. So I would assume that the Coinbase, this deal is very close to some sort of safe t bill investment like maker did. But if its more unsecured lending to crypto market makers then I would change my entire mindset on this and I would not support it. I think thats the, the, this might have been answered overnight because I haven't checked the forum yet today. But that is, I think that's the most important question really.
00:29:22.040 - 00:31:05.854, Speaker B: That's what would be interesting though is like, so okay, fine, if this goes through and you're really worried about it, then you could probably hedge some of this exposure by buying like CDs or like shorting Coinbase stock or something on like Synthetix or some other platform or like, you know what I mean? Like you could use synthetix. I don't know if they support Coinbase, but like if you're really worried about counterparty risk, then you could probably do some sort of interesting strategy where you hedge out some of the exposure, assuming it's not wildly expensive to do so, which I haven't run through this exercise. But theoretically, yeah, you minimize kind of counterparty risk. But I think we're coming into a, if you zoom out, I think it's more and more apparent that we are coming to some sort of big, I don't want to call it a fork in the road, but just kind of more towards this kind of like philosophical standpoint meets like practical implementation and regulatory kind of policy, like regulatory compliance, if you will, which is, I think, you know, the, I think a lot of, and this goes back to the episode that we recorded with Jake and Rebecca, that there will be a lot of more regulatory clarity. And even today. Right. Gensler just kind of came out saying that my understanding was that the CFDC would be overseeing kind of bitcoin and ethereum, but he's also hinting or just further emphasizing the point that he's been making all along, which is a lot of other tokens look and feel like securities and a lot of like service providers, exchanges and all that need to register with the SEC and all this stuff.
00:31:05.854 - 00:31:54.248, Speaker B: And so ultimately, yeah, like this is, again, we asked, I asked you this question a prior, so like, what are the odds of like a regulator freezing USDC not just in maker but like across Defi and what their motivation would be to do so. And I think there's two camps. One of them says, look at what happened with tornado. They can do that at their own kind of whim if they wanted to, and kind of shut down Defi. But I think I sort of feel that the tornado situation was pretty unique and specific and it probably doesn't happen unless there's a very clear kind of bad actor interacting in these protocols, which.
00:31:54.336 - 00:32:25.446, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't feel, I mean, I feel really, we've, I've been, we've been close with circle since they've, since very early days. Like we've known Jeremy and their team since the very early days. I, what, what happened to Tornado is not just going to happen to circle. Like, they've got a huge regulatory team, a huge policy team. They meet with the regulators. I would probably, I would assume every day someone on their team is talking to some sort of regulator or policymaker. It's not just going to, it's, it wouldn't, what happened to Tornado would never happen to circle.
00:32:25.446 - 00:32:58.824, Speaker A: And that was just like, you kind of wake up one day and like, boom, action's been taken. There would be, I mean, look, I could end up looking like a fool in a couple of years if that ever happens. But like, I just really don't see that happening. It's not to mean that we shouldn't try to get more censorship resistant and like, you've got this obvious dichotomy between like decentralization and creating censorship resistant systems verse KYC, AML apply like, work with regulators and basically try to capture as big of a market as possible. But I don't see like, them just freezing USDC.
00:32:58.944 - 00:33:06.200, Speaker B: So, yeah, I remember meeting Jeremy number of times and every time we met, he was like, yeah, I was just in DC and this, he spends so.
00:33:06.232 - 00:33:23.204, Speaker A: Much time there and like when the, when, when there's a hearing and they need someone to come talk about it, like, he's usually someone they tap, they tap chad cascarilla from Paxos. Like there are a couple of these companies that are just very deeply embedded in. Into the DC scene. Yeah.
00:33:23.284 - 00:34:08.164, Speaker B: So, yeah, I mean, I think just around this topic, I think the. In my mind it is. Look, in the extreme scenario where if the regulators want to, you know, freeze USDC, they're going to do it and circle is going to do it. No matter if it's held in makers kind of self custody wallets, multisig or on Coinbase, it doesn't matter, folks. The heart of the problem is, if you believe it's a problem, is why are they holding that much USDC, which this has been in the works since we first introduced the proposal back in March of 2020 to onboard USDCs collateral to bring more stability and scalability to protocol. Now, if you don't like maker, go somewhere else.
00:34:08.234 - 00:34:09.124, Speaker A: You have options.
00:34:10.624 - 00:34:31.320, Speaker B: But it is, as you, to quote you, it is one of, if not the primary backbone of DeFi. So everyone that isn't DeFi should be paying attention to this because sure, you can use another protocol, but even FrACs has USDC, like other protocols have, and use USCC. It is the most kind of fluid used stable coin out there.
00:34:31.392 - 00:34:31.928, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:34:32.056 - 00:34:33.924, Speaker B: And it does pose a systemic risk.
00:34:34.563 - 00:34:57.303, Speaker A: Let me just one more thing on why I think this makes sense. There are $5.6 billion in the stable coin like backing in the PSM right now. You don't need all $5.6 billion to be fully liquid. I'm sure I'll get some pushback on that. But a lot of the other stable coin issuers run this fraction.
00:34:57.303 - 00:35:12.024, Speaker A: I guess what I was walking into saying is, like, makers should create a fractional reserve system, which is like the. One of the biggest points of pushback about the traditional banking system. But like, I don't know, like that's. Anyways, that's.
00:35:12.144 - 00:35:35.830, Speaker B: No, you should at least, look, there have been some protocols that have been really hurt by doing poor treasury management and others that have been, in this case, maker and a fairly conservative do something in the middle. But I think, you know, earning some yield on your, on your idle assets, like cash, stable coins is probably a good thing to subsidize and finance Mongo.
00:35:35.902 - 00:36:05.846, Speaker A: I just think that, like, if you look at the balance sheet of maker, you've got the assets and liabilities. Liabilities are DAI assets or the PSM and the user vaults, you can open up at least a small chunk of the assets to become to have a third bucket, which is like safe investments. So. And by the way, the. On the custody risk, you're really just switching custodians because if you already have a bunch of USDC, USDC is custody, like center via. USDC is the current custodian of the PSM's underlying assets, I think. So you're really switching to Coinbase.
00:36:05.846 - 00:36:07.142, Speaker A: Prime is effectively just.
00:36:07.198 - 00:36:14.854, Speaker B: I mean, yeah, USC is an IOU and it's center circle that like maintains that ledger and can freeze and update balances.
00:36:14.934 - 00:36:38.244, Speaker A: So, yeah, you're right on the Coinbase side of things. Coinbase. I just got a alert. Coinbase is funding a lawsuit. Actually, um, Coinbase is funding a lawsuit brought by six people challenging the US Treasury Department sanctions of the tornado cash smart contracts and asking the court to remove them from the US sanctions list. This is really interesting. This is written by Brian Armstrong.
00:36:38.244 - 00:36:45.984, Speaker A: I'm reading this in real time. I'll ping it over to you. Um, why I think this is interesting is, um.
00:36:46.444 - 00:36:47.156, Speaker B: Hmm.
00:36:47.300 - 00:37:20.346, Speaker A: Is because Coinbase is a public company and it's very rare, I would say, that you see newly listed public companies that are already pushing the boundaries of maybe what folks would say the company should be doing. There's probably some regulators who say that Coinbase lists unregistered securities and so they're probably under the watch the eye of the regulators already. In fact, I know they are. So it's really interesting that they're coming down and just saying, look, this is what we believe in. I'm still reading this blog post.
00:37:20.370 - 00:38:13.284, Speaker B: Yeah, I was gonna say, like, it touches on a lot of when people should go back to the episode we recorded when the tornado thing happened, which is my observation was it felt like they were using like a sledgehammer where they should be using more of like a finer knife and tool. And in this case, the point that they're making is one treasure is using a hammer instead of a scalpel, you know, and there are. Second of all, it acted outside of its authority, meaning treasury is allowed to sanction people and their property. But Congress has never given treasury the power to sanction open source software. And I think that is the primary, strongest argument here, that it is probably unconstitutional to do so. It goes back to the First Amendment, which is, if you're a developer in Europe, like, this is open source code. And a more finer argument that they're making is more kind of, this is stifling innovation.
00:38:13.284 - 00:38:42.232, Speaker B: You know, it's, you know, I think it has made a big impact on a lot of developers in the space and how they could be treated, because obviously one of the tornado cast developers was arrested in the Netherlands and is still held, to my knowledge, by the authorities. And so, yeah, it, you know, historically, open source developers, just developers at large, have been, you know, it's pretty important to have the freedom to kind of write code.
00:38:42.368 - 00:38:45.960, Speaker A: Yeah. Love this move. A lot of respect.
00:38:46.072 - 00:38:53.912, Speaker B: Good job. Right now there's another good mirror post by Katie Hahn, who used to be the prosecutor.
00:38:54.008 - 00:38:56.320, Speaker A: Yeah. Do you know Katie? Can we have Katie on empire?
00:38:56.472 - 00:39:07.664, Speaker B: Okay, if you're listening, we'd love to have you on. I have met her. I have interacted with her. I think she's very smart on these type of topics. Now runs Han Ventures. But, yeah, she, she has a good. I haven't read it.
00:39:07.664 - 00:40:26.330, Speaker B: She argued more that it was like, most people are focusing on the first amendment. There's also another argument to be done on the fourth amendment, which I'm not an expert on law, but we should link it up in the show notes and then discuss it and perhaps even have her on to talk about it. But this is going to be a really big precedent. I feel like the more I've thought about everything that has transpired on tornado cash and talking to a lot of developers out there, it sort of reminds me of in the nineties where the department, what is it? The DOJ or even the Department of Defense was pretty, at some point, I think, overacted in the sense that it wouldn't even allow, like, certain people to leave with, like, computers. Like, if you're traveling outside the United States, I think you were not allowed to, like, at some point, like, take, like, pieces of hardware and computer and because they would feel like it would, like, yeah, they were pretty paranoid about it. And, yeah, I think there have been these instances where, like, the regulators or like, the different departments have tried to block this sort of stuff, and then it ultimately kind of goes away. But, but, yeah, it's not like the first, like, everything.
00:40:26.330 - 00:40:43.932, Speaker B: Like, we try to put it in a historical perspective, and this is not the first time or the last, candidly, where, like, I feel like regulators might, like, clamp down temporarily or try to on, you know, pretty fundamental, like, freedoms, like freedom of privacy and freedom of speech and whatnot.
00:40:44.068 - 00:41:06.920, Speaker A: Yeah. Let's move past. Unless there's anything else I want to talk about. Binance, actually, another company that's usually in the regulatory eyes is Binance. Starting September 29, Binance will automatically convert all USDC. USDP. What is that? Paxos, USD, Paxos and TUSD.
00:41:06.920 - 00:41:35.724, Speaker A: Anyways, Binance is converting their stablecoin balances basically into B USD, which is Binance's stablecoin, which is really just a white labeled Paxos coin at a one to one ratio in order to enhance liquidity and capital efficiency for users. Users will still be able to withdraw their chosen centralized stablecoin. The amount will simply be deducted from their BUSD balance. Finance added that USDT is not one of the stable coins involved in the auto conversion initiative, but they didn't provide a reason as to why.
00:41:36.224 - 00:42:15.998, Speaker B: Yeah, I think there's some really good takes by the founder of Winter Mute, which is a big market maker. Yeah. F Jenny and even Jeremy from Circle, they all seem to suggest it's a positive thing, and I tend to agree, which is you're leaving essentially the role of arbitraging to a market maker, but improving liquidity of BUSD. If there's a discrepancy between the peg, then a market maker is going to step up and capture that r fairly quickly. And so there's kind of no reason. This is a point that Evgeny made, which is like, if when you have too many pairs, it fragments liquidity. And so it's probably, it's a more inefficient kind of market.
00:42:15.998 - 00:42:33.932, Speaker B: And so by removing a lot of these pairs, you consolidate liquidity. And then it just makes a market maker's job easier to make, to make, you know, to arb that perhaps discrepancy in the peg and make the markets more liquid. And so, yeah, I think FTX does something similar.
00:42:33.988 - 00:42:34.156, Speaker A: Right.
00:42:34.180 - 00:43:11.180, Speaker B: When you deposit a stable into FTX, you're basically depositing like, if you deposit USDC and FTX, it has like, it is a basket of different stable coins except USDT tether. But for the most part, it's just, yeah, it's like consolidated. And then depending on what you want to redeem, like withdraw or trade on, like you which pair, then I think that's when, you know, just consolidates the liquidity and it's probably net positive or it is net positive.
00:43:11.252 - 00:43:13.224, Speaker A: Is binance taking a swing at tether here?
00:43:14.204 - 00:43:19.924, Speaker B: No, I think this is also consistent with how FTX does it. Right. Which is tether has always been in a category of its own.
00:43:19.964 - 00:43:22.878, Speaker A: Yeah, but FTX doesn't have their own stable. Finance has.
00:43:22.926 - 00:43:40.114, Speaker B: Yeah, at least. But yes. Yeah, I, I'm not reading too much into tether, other than tether. I think it's just a stable coin. That is, you know, just treated differently. Certainly, like us regulators have always had it in. It's not the same as USCC, let's put it that way.
00:43:40.114 - 00:43:43.910, Speaker B: And so, yeah, this is, this is.
00:43:43.942 - 00:44:07.018, Speaker A: Total tether Fud, but it's not. No, no. What I'm going to say. What I'm going to say is what you. What you could make the argument that binance is like, taking a swing at tether and that they'll try to, like, hurt tether with this. Um, but because eventually, if tether gets hurt enough, binance has enough capital to come in and basically bail out tether. This is total tether fud, by the way.
00:44:07.018 - 00:44:12.194, Speaker A: I don't think this is going to happen. And then, and then if Binance was behind tether, like, that is just so powerful.
00:44:12.314 - 00:44:34.704, Speaker B: Um, well, that's tethered. That's tether Fud, which is, you know, there's always tether fud. I mean, Jeremy said something similar, which, I mean, not fud per se, but just his opinion, which obviously he's biased. Finance is trying to consolidate dollar liquidity with cash equivalent stables. That's good for liquidity and market depth. USDT is not cash equivalent. Not even close.
00:44:34.704 - 00:44:54.122, Speaker B: Full stop, period. So, anyways, time and time again, tether has come out with, you know, reports of what is backing tether and what have you. So I'm not going to comment or make an opinion. People can go read and inform themselves on the matter and if you do want to talk about it or have an opinion, just comment on YouTube, as a lot of people do.
00:44:54.178 - 00:45:02.374, Speaker A: Who's your favorite data provider? Santi? Did you guys use everyone or did you use, like, Keiko Amber data, coinmetrics? Like, do you have any favorites?
00:45:04.034 - 00:45:31.594, Speaker B: Good question. I like, in no particular order, but Coinmetrix has a really good newsletter and just provides really nice charts in network data visualization. I'm a big fan of what they do. Masari has good charts. I haven't looked closely at yours, but I assume you guys have as well. Fairly new. Don't kill me for saying this, but the block has good defi charts.
00:45:31.594 - 00:45:44.584, Speaker B: Um, who else? Nansen. You know, paid, but. Yeah, the first ones that I said are, with the exception of maybe you guys and others are, they have different tiers, but a lot of these are free, so.
00:45:44.624 - 00:45:51.288, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Um, how about you? You'll see what we roll out in.
00:45:51.456 - 00:45:54.712, Speaker B: Like, here we go. So, there we go.
00:45:54.848 - 00:45:57.736, Speaker A: That's my plug. Yeah, we've been building a bunch of data stuff in the background.
00:45:57.800 - 00:45:59.008, Speaker B: So nice.
00:45:59.176 - 00:46:18.400, Speaker A: There's my plug. Our man. I want to bring this guy Doug Kolkat on. Doug, he keeps having these. I don't know if you read Garrett's notes that he wrote for us, but Doug keeps showing up in the notes and we keep not talking about it because. But Garrett is right. Doug keeps making these interesting arguments.
00:46:18.400 - 00:46:34.412, Speaker A: And the argument this week was that he argues that today's completely free floating gas means that prices keep falling until supplies clear. I think he's basically saying that there should be a floor price, a fee. Floor price on l one s. I.
00:46:34.428 - 00:47:05.832, Speaker B: Mean, the question just now, the first jumped at me was, well, it is possible that at this early stage of a lot of these l one s that some might be even subsidizing block space to attract to make it artificially drop fees and then convert users, and then over time, let it be more of a free floating market and stop subsidizing block space. But, yeah, that may be a totally inaccurate and incorrect statement, but.
00:47:06.008 - 00:47:44.030, Speaker A: Well, I think it comes down to the big question of value accrual. Right? Like which the. One of the bit we were talking about, one of the big dichotomies or questions in crypto right now is like, decentralization and building censorship, resistance and sacrificing, maybe addressable market. On the other side of it is address like basically racing to acquire users, make as much money as possible. Another big question in crypto right now is basically just what part of the stack is value going to accrue? Is it going to accrue to the settlement layer? If it accrues to the settlement layer, does it accrue to l one s or does it accrue to l two s? Or will it accrue to apps, or does it accrue to aggregators, which I don't think many people think aggregators. It's really between apps for settlement layer. And if you.
00:47:44.030 - 00:47:49.980, Speaker A: I think it's really between like l one s versus apps, I would say. But I think that's one of the big questions.
00:47:50.132 - 00:47:59.252, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. Well, let's add to future episodes where we bring on Doug and potentially Katie and or Jeremy would be great to.
00:47:59.268 - 00:48:05.300, Speaker A: Have, actually, Santi, where do you think value will occur in the next cycle? Settlement layer or app layer?
00:48:05.372 - 00:49:04.750, Speaker B: I tweeted about this. I put a poll yesterday, and we can link it here, which is I asked what part of the stack will accrue the most value in the next crypto cycle? And the different options were settlement layer, which includes l one and l two, apps which would be like defi games, etcetera, aggregators mostly I'm thinking like wallets and or other. And there are 25 minutes left in the poll. For now, it's an overwhelming 46% say that it will accrue the most on, on apps, whereas historically it's been mostly the sediment layer, meaning the l one. Now my, I'm sort of split, I think apps more so than an l two because it's really exciting what's happening in l two land. Optimism. Arbitrum I think l two s are going to over the next, like eight, like I was gonna say eight years.
00:49:04.750 - 00:49:56.434, Speaker B: But for the next cycle, l two s are really going to shine because I think it's going to coincide nicely with really good apps that are coming out and support a lot of users. But my overarching thesis is that there, and what I look to invest the most at this point is investing in one application that is going to capture and probably build out other parts of the stack. So look at Stepn, for instance, and people that want to learn more about it should go to our episode. And full disclosure, I'm an investor in Stepn and I'm an advisor. So take this, all this with a grain of salt. But nonetheless, the point stands. They have created a really nice application which allows people to earn nfts by walking and exercising.
00:49:56.434 - 00:50:23.890, Speaker B: And they've onboarded a lot of users, and they've first were deployed in Solana and then they migrated to other chains because they were hitting, like, they were just kind of breaking Solana. They just had a lot of traction since then. They've become. So they captured all this attention and all these users, they've now rolled out their own marketplace, and they're now the most popular Dex in Solana. And so what's to stop them from continuing to build out other products? Meaning they already have a wallet.
00:50:23.922 - 00:50:25.250, Speaker A: Like, they build their own wallet.
00:50:25.402 - 00:50:26.378, Speaker B: They already have a wallet.
00:50:26.426 - 00:50:27.282, Speaker A: They do have their own wallet, yeah.
00:50:27.298 - 00:50:56.492, Speaker B: I mean, they have their application. So, like, essentially it's a wallet and the marketplace. And what's to stop them from building their own chain? Like dydx ish type? Also doing this. So I'm, the way I characterizes these is the Wechat of Web three, which is like, Wechat. There was going to be someone that probably just kind of captured all these users and attention and then can build all these different parts of the stack. Everything's open source. You can just fork it.
00:50:56.588 - 00:50:57.172, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:50:57.308 - 00:51:06.596, Speaker B: So I think so that leads me to invest in an app that captures a lot of users and attention, probably a game. And then that allows you to do so many other things.
00:51:06.780 - 00:51:09.024, Speaker A: Yeah, that's all I got today.
00:51:09.404 - 00:51:11.144, Speaker B: You. What do you think.
00:51:13.284 - 00:51:30.414, Speaker A: I could make the. I think. I think that in the next cycle, it's still going to be the settlement layer. I think, you know, I need to think about this more. Last week, I told someone it was going to be the app layer, and this week I'm saying the settlement layer. So there's my minimal conviction.
00:51:30.954 - 00:51:33.034, Speaker B: Well, it's okay to change your mind. That's fine. Yeah.
00:51:33.114 - 00:51:40.654, Speaker A: Yeah. I don't think I have conviction yet on anything. The fun contrarian bet say thing would be to say the wallets, because.
00:51:42.354 - 00:51:45.698, Speaker B: Historically, user aggregation theory and look, read well.
00:51:45.706 - 00:51:59.506, Speaker A: They're the only one who owns the. They're the only one, like, no one owns, really. It's very tough to own the user. Right. In crypto, but they're the only one who really owns the user. Like, once you start using metamask, you're gonna. You could flip between compound and Aave really quickly.
00:51:59.506 - 00:52:06.418, Speaker A: But, like, you're still staying in metamask, you know, they just make no money. Yeah, they make very minimal. Very minimal money.
00:52:06.586 - 00:52:08.534, Speaker B: Metamask makes good amount of money.
00:52:09.594 - 00:52:10.282, Speaker A: That's true.
00:52:10.378 - 00:52:11.690, Speaker B: Metamask swap fees.
00:52:11.802 - 00:52:15.322, Speaker A: Yes, they. They do. But those fees will trend towards zero ish. Yeah.
00:52:15.378 - 00:52:19.138, Speaker B: I guess what you're seeing in exchanges is, like, a lot of fees are just gonna go zero.
00:52:19.226 - 00:52:25.556, Speaker A: Well, this was our argument about Uniswap, like, a month ago. I think most fees end up trending towards zero in financial markets.
00:52:25.700 - 00:52:27.784, Speaker B: Yes or no? Yes or no?
00:52:28.084 - 00:52:35.044, Speaker A: I know what you're going to say, which is there's always a fee, but it's either on the front end and the user knows it, or it's on the back end. And payments for order flow. Yeah, exactly.
00:52:35.084 - 00:52:37.860, Speaker B: Yes. Fees. There's no such thing as a free lunch.
00:52:38.012 - 00:52:40.424, Speaker A: Have you looked before finance, by the way, Santi?
00:52:41.884 - 00:52:44.572, Speaker B: Yeah, but it's been a while. Long for a while, right?
00:52:44.708 - 00:52:56.518, Speaker A: Yeah, it's been. I had no idea that they were even still around. They are. I talked to their team last week. They are really interesting stuff. When I think about Mev, I think flashbots immediately. But the rook team is doing interesting stuff.
00:52:56.518 - 00:52:59.718, Speaker A: I have no affiliate. I don't even know if they have a token. I have no affiliation.
00:52:59.766 - 00:53:07.834, Speaker B: Yeah, they do. This is the team that was the ren team, I think, also spun out and then ended up being acquired by someone else.
00:53:08.494 - 00:53:16.338, Speaker A: Pretty interesting what they're doing. The reason I bring them up is because it's like the payment forwarder flow model. Um, yeah, before we go, there have.
00:53:16.346 - 00:53:31.994, Speaker B: Been some pretty interesting rounds lately, which suggests that the market, at least on the private side of rounds of, is pretty healthy and strong, and a lot of the private capital is being deployed. I'll just point out a few here. That, um, the first one, uh, well.
00:53:32.034 - 00:53:36.522, Speaker A: That while you're pulling. While you're pulling it up. Santa, did you do the. Did you invest in chaos labs?
00:53:36.658 - 00:53:37.654, Speaker B: Yes, I did.
00:53:38.434 - 00:53:41.142, Speaker A: They are on an absolute tear right now.
00:53:41.298 - 00:54:21.712, Speaker B: I was fascinated. Look, thematically, they're like a gauntlet. Yeah, kind of like a gauntlet. Super smart x, israeli intelligence unit folks, founders. And they are building tools like gauntlet to do real time simulation and stress testing Defi. And when you think about it, like, there should be more sophisticated tools like Defi and blockchains just generally are like, really data rich and transparent environments that should allow you to do really interesting data modeling and simulations and, yeah, I was an early investor in chaos. Shout out to Omar and the team there, and they just put out a proposal to.
00:54:21.712 - 00:55:08.220, Speaker B: They've done some really interesting work on creating a dashboard for money markets like AAVE, to monitor in real time the different collateral positions and what's at risk, and allows you to do simulations. And I played around the tool. What happens if the price of SD drops below 0.96? What does that do? The cascading and do simulations of cascading, liquidations and whatnot. And, yeah, it's pretty cool tooling that they've developed. And these are the type of projects that I think are going to push us towards more mainstream adoption. Because if you're a more sophisticated financial player, as the market matures, becomes more competitive, and these protocols are transacting more value at risk, then it's pretty awesome to be able to, like, in real time, do these simulations.
00:55:08.220 - 00:55:43.840, Speaker B: And it's the type of tools that, a, I think teams, defi teams want, b, investors and users want. And also regulators, you know, like regulators track, like, capital efficiency ratios and, like, solvency ratios, like Basel rules one, two, three, or whatever, to basically, like, if you're. If you're like a depositor in some of these banks, you want to understand, like, water, that the bank is like, not doing crazy stuff as they were doing, like, in the financial, before the financial crisis. So, again, I think these are the type of tools that make DeFi a better, safer or work towards making it a better, safer environment.
00:55:43.912 - 00:55:46.728, Speaker A: Yeah. Tell me about the rounds, then we can wrap with that.
00:55:46.816 - 00:56:04.048, Speaker B: Yeah, well, the biggest one is this mistin labs. So the creator of the sui blockchain, they close a $300 million raise led by FTXV Ventures. That value the.
00:56:04.136 - 00:56:04.704, Speaker A: I missed that.
00:56:04.744 - 00:56:18.184, Speaker B: Oh, that was today 2 billion. That was today, yeah. So these are like, again, competing l ones. So it's Aptos and sui, I think, are the ones that are mostly kind of talked about now, but, yeah. Valuing the company at 2 billion.
00:56:18.264 - 00:56:21.304, Speaker A: So they're the, they're the, they're out of Facebook. Right.
00:56:21.384 - 00:56:59.578, Speaker B: This is former executives. Yeah, Facebook executives. So Aptos is probably the most kind of direct competitor here, if you will. Also x meta employees like Novi financial, what was called. So, yeah, pretty interesting. And I think the valuations are fairly comparable, if I'm not mistaken, because Aptos raised for another $150 million round, bringing it to total of 350 million raised this year. So again, you know, people might.
00:56:59.578 - 00:57:20.746, Speaker B: These are not small numbers. Yeah. And for anyone listening, it's like, you know, it was pretty, the dilution is not much. And the question is, why would you raise that amount of money? And I think if you could do it, you know, you probably need a big warches to compete against existing l one s. And it's from a BD standpoint, attracting developers, that's not cheap. Right. And so I think, yeah, we'll see.
00:57:20.746 - 00:57:49.028, Speaker B: But it's fairly interesting. There have been other rounds, not at this scale, but I feel like the private markets have held up nicely and are back. There have been a number of funds, I think the amount of dry powder, I don't forget the figure exactly, but there's a decent amount of dry powder of funds in crypto that have raised recently that are deploying, backing the next startups.
00:57:49.156 - 00:58:01.916, Speaker A: Yeah. So what about. I have a couple others, 21, co immune honey. Honey's great. Known him since the early days. They just raised now a unicorn Credx, which is bringing real world assets.
00:58:02.020 - 00:58:02.664, Speaker B: Those.
00:58:03.604 - 00:58:11.144, Speaker A: Yeah, focused on Latin America. They, they just raised eleven fuel labs. Raised like 80. Yeah, a lot of raises.
00:58:11.444 - 00:58:13.664, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely.
00:58:14.244 - 00:58:16.380, Speaker A: What is this Hubble protocol like censorship.
00:58:16.412 - 00:58:22.236, Speaker B: Resistance, stable coin that multicoin invested in. Find just multicore, multicorn, a few other folks. Yeah.
00:58:22.340 - 00:58:23.092, Speaker A: Interesting.
00:58:23.228 - 00:58:31.100, Speaker B: Yeah. Oh, Animoca raised another, actually today Animoca raised another hundred million or so.
00:58:31.252 - 00:58:31.984, Speaker A: Wow.
00:58:33.044 - 00:58:35.404, Speaker B: And it was like GGV, GVC.
00:58:35.484 - 00:58:43.228, Speaker A: I don't get Animoca. I feel like every three months they just raised another hundred million and then they use that money to go invest in all these early.
00:58:43.316 - 00:58:46.064, Speaker B: 110. Yeah, they've invested in 150 companies.
00:58:46.374 - 00:58:47.446, Speaker A: They're a holding company now.
00:58:47.470 - 00:59:19.262, Speaker B: They're a holding company. Yeah. So it's around $110 million round led by Temasek and a few other investors, which I like, like VC firm GGV Capital. These are pretty smart guys, I think, in the consumer land. But yeah, I think it's sort of like to give them more capital to invest and continue to. I mean they're. I think their sub is like sandbox and like they've invested in early and a few kind of notable projects like Axie and a few others.
00:59:19.262 - 00:59:21.134, Speaker B: So they're everywhere, really.
00:59:21.294 - 00:59:23.246, Speaker A: Anything else you want to wrap, sir?
00:59:23.430 - 00:59:29.078, Speaker B: No. Any, before we go, any book or movie recommendations?
00:59:29.246 - 00:59:54.990, Speaker A: I have a podcast recommendation actually, which can't be empire. It's not empire, it's a non. Well, I have two, actually two podcast recommendations I have to plug. Bell Curve, which Mike and the guys at framework just launched. Vance and Michael at Framework. Really good show. The other one is a non crypto show which I've been trying to read some non crypto stuff, which is tape notes.
00:59:54.990 - 01:00:23.726, Speaker A: Really interesting. This guy in the UK, he basically sits down with a bunch of artists who I like, like flume and imagine dragons and Fred again, and like all. And chain smokers. Like he'll basically sit down with all these like DJ's and musicians and bands and basically just like dig deep into their recording process and like how they came built albums and how they came up with the album. Like where their inspiration came from. Like gets really nitty gritty and he'll like play songs on the podcast and then you dig into the songs. It's really good.
01:00:23.726 - 01:00:26.486, Speaker A: So I would recommend tape notes. That's my content of the week.
01:00:26.590 - 01:00:49.770, Speaker B: Interesting. I will play a guess for the sake of diversity, a book I think I mentioned, the network state by Balaji. It's really good. If you don't want to read the book, just go listen to his podcast. The other one that I'm reading and almost finishing now is Matthews Ball. The Metaverse. Matthew Ball's book, a recent book called the Metaverse.
01:00:49.770 - 01:00:55.282, Speaker B: It's pretty good. It says the metaverse how. The metaverse and how it will revolutionize everything.
01:00:55.338 - 01:01:00.518, Speaker A: Oh yeah, we had. Oh no, you weren't on that. Matthew came on the show. Actually. You weren't. You weren't on that episode.
01:01:00.606 - 01:01:13.270, Speaker B: Yeah, but it's, it's. It's fairly good. It also reminds me one of my favorite books, which is how the Internet happened, which lends a lot of really good perspective on the evolution of the Internet. And so, yeah, go check that out. The metaverse is pretty cool.
01:01:13.422 - 01:01:13.870, Speaker A: Cool.
01:01:13.942 - 01:01:14.886, Speaker B: I'm enjoying it.
01:01:15.030 - 01:01:19.074, Speaker A: Nice. Did you watch the psychedelics thing? How to change your mind on Netflix.
01:01:19.694 - 01:01:24.890, Speaker B: Partially. I haven't. I haven't had much time for tv because I'm starting something new, I think.
01:01:24.982 - 01:01:29.210, Speaker A: Oh, there's the alpha. I've been waiting for you to release that.
01:01:29.362 - 01:01:33.242, Speaker B: I got a sprinkle some, but, yeah, I will. Tbd, but, uh, in the works.
01:01:33.338 - 01:01:34.666, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm excited. Works.
01:01:34.770 - 01:01:36.066, Speaker B: This has been me frustrating.
01:01:36.090 - 01:01:38.146, Speaker A: You want to say more? You want to say more or next time?
01:01:38.250 - 01:02:19.654, Speaker B: Uh, it is related to one of the things that I think we can do better as industry, which is better security. And until we have more hardened security to protect consumers, it think is. Is the most critical piece. A lot of people talk about more regulation in the space, and it concerns them and worries them. And I am channeling that energy to building something that I think will be net positive to push the space forward. And it is around bringing more risk management solutions for crypto. I've actually been tired of, like, telling this idea to so many people that at some point I'm like, all right, you know what? Time for me to just maybe just do it.
01:02:20.594 - 01:02:31.194, Speaker A: We'll do an ep on it someday. Once you're ready to talk about it. Enjoy the weekend. Enjoy the rest of the week. Hope everyone has a great weekend. We'll see you next week for another episode.
