00:00:04.080 - 00:00:19.814, Speaker A: All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Empire. Today I'm joined by my co host, Santiago Santos, and two very special guests. Jonah van Berg, the head of trading at Cumberland. Jonah, I have to put that emphasis on, like, the van Berg. I feel like it makes you sound very professional here.
00:00:19.854 - 00:00:20.854, Speaker B: Let it rip. Let it rip.
00:00:20.894 - 00:00:38.144, Speaker A: Yeah, let it rip. And so the head of trading at Cumberland, and, man, I should not have put the emphasis on the last name, because I can't do this on Zhenya. Michal Chenkel, the VP of spot exchange. The VP of the exchange of Bitmax. Two really, really special trading guests. Zhenya, how did I do with the last name there?
00:00:38.304 - 00:00:39.680, Speaker C: Nine out of ten. He did. Okay.
00:00:39.712 - 00:01:13.124, Speaker A: Nine out of ten, we'll take it. With a last name like Yanowitz, I feel like I'm allowed to butcher last name. So, anyways, guys, today there have been a lot of episodes, both on our podcast, on other podcasts, exploring what is going on with the markets. Everyone wants to know, have we hit bottom? Uh, what's going on with things like Celsius and three arrows and, like, how does the macro impact crypto? I obviously think that's a really interesting conversation. We've had that conversation several times. What I want to actually do with this is a little bit different. Uh, we have two folks here who know the depths of crypto markets better than, really, anyone.
00:01:13.124 - 00:01:41.838, Speaker A: Better than most, I would say. One runs a spot exchange, one runs a trading desk. I'm really excited to have them, uh, for this conversation. What I want to do here is actually talk very, very micro about trades. What is the detail of a trade? What happens when you create a trade? What happens when you execute a trade? And only once we understand the real micro of these trades, then I think we can zoom back out and get their big perspective on it. So, Jonah, maybe I could pick on you. Actually, there are two ways to make money in finance.
00:01:41.838 - 00:02:05.998, Speaker A: One is taking directional bets. You go long bitcoin, you go short bitcoin. The other way is sitting in between those trades, providing liquidity, earning revenue by capturing a spread. You sit on the bid and the offer of each side of that. Can you just talk about a day in the life of a market maker during times of crisis, during times of what is the. What does a market maker do in the last 30 days? What is the day in the life there?
00:02:06.166 - 00:02:43.590, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. I mean, it's a great question. So, I guess, basically, the way to think about it is, you know, you describe these two types of trading, right? You have making and taking market making, and then sort of when you're just taking bidder and offer from, from a market maker and, you know, warehousing that risk and taking a directional bet. So I guess when I started my career at Goldman as an oil trader, as a market maker, really, you didn't really have to take much risk. You could just kind of sit there making markets all day and get in and out of stuff, and it wasn't really that hard. People would come in and trade with you and then you would get out of it on screen or on an exchange at a much better price. And it was kind of a, it wasn't really the most complicated game.
00:02:43.590 - 00:03:28.686, Speaker B: And then I switched to, you know, let's call it taking. I was a prop trader for seven years. And, you know, the better the liquidity you get, the more money you make because you don't pay as many transactions fees on each trend sort of trade that you're doing, it adds up over time. So now, crypto, the market has matured so quickly that you can't really be a market maker like what we do at Cumberland without taking risk. Because if you're trying to do that sort of game of making wide markets and then hoping to get out at a better price, it's already too mature for that. So pretty much every time somebody comes in to do an OTC over the counter trade with us, we're taking on one form of risk or another. And we're also constantly streaming two way markets to exchanges all over the world in a sort of a rapid, kind of latency sensitive way.
00:03:28.686 - 00:03:55.276, Speaker B: So let's say somebody comes in to give us a big block of bitcoin, we go and buy a bunch of it. There's going to be sort of an idea of what bitcoin is worth right now, an idea of what bitcoin is going to be worth in one, two, 3510 seconds. And we're going to sort of consider how we hedge that based on where we expect prices to go. And you're not trying to win every single time like what used to work back in the day. You're trying to win more often than not.
00:03:55.460 - 00:04:13.996, Speaker A: Get it? Maybe. Tell me more details about this. I want to know exactly what this looks like. So Santi wants to buy 1000 bitcoin. In typical Santee fashion, he comes to you guys and what does he do? He messages you on Telegram. You guys have a desktop app. He pings you on Skype, on slack.
00:04:13.996 - 00:04:27.910, Speaker A: What does he do? And when he sends that to you, what are you guys saying? Are you saying you have to take that? You basically have to give the other side of that trade, or you're basically doing some calculations on your side saying, is this a good trade for us to execute upon?
00:04:28.062 - 00:05:02.834, Speaker B: We're not going to last very long as a business if we don't take the other side of santees trade. So if Santi wants to buy 1000 bitcoin, he can come to us over telegram. We call that voice, even though it's really chat. There's another way you can do it. He could click trade on our API, or we have a product called Marea that basically is more of a. More of a visual tile that you can interact with and buy bitcoin or sell bitcoin on it, basically. Then what happens? Whatever price we show, and a lot of times it's systematically driven, but for really large trades, we're going to have people looking at it and making sure that it looks okay.
00:05:02.834 - 00:05:35.684, Speaker B: Once that trade goes through, then we're short 1000 bitcoin. What are we going to do with that? Well, if we happen to be long 1000 bitcoin at the time that Santee came in to lift us, then we're flat. Happy days. If our position was flat when Santee came in, we're going to have to think about how to go and buy that back. There are all these different instruments, and maybe Zhenya can talk us through some of them. But one of the big things that BitMex innovated was this thing called a perpetual future. There's a ton of liquidity in those, and there's also liquidity in spot exchanges all over the world.
00:05:35.684 - 00:06:09.474, Speaker B: Basically what you have to do when Santee comes in to buy either direct from you via your API, or whether Santee is just lifting the exchange, and we're seeing that flow indirectly. We're going to have to decide how quickly we want to get out of it while we minimize our market impact, because that's the name of the game. And we're also going to have to try and figure out exactly what risk position we want anyway. We're not necessarily going to be getting out of all of it. We might be keeping some of it, or we might be internalizing some of that versus another strategy we have that wanted to sell anyway.
00:06:09.614 - 00:06:41.776, Speaker A: Yeah, that's helpful. I'll pick on you for one more question then, Jenny. I'll flip it over to you to talk about this on the exchange side of things. But what happens? So this makes sense for something like bitcoin or ETH, right? You can pretty easily get out of something like bitcoin or ETH, you don't have to take much directional risk. What about something like Luna or UST or Celsius token? I'm assuming a bunch of large funds are coming to you guys saying pretty quickly, look, I've got a massive bag of UST, I've got a massive bag of Luna back in May or maybe more recently, something like Celsius token. I need to dump this quickly. You're saying, all right, we want to stay in business.
00:06:41.776 - 00:06:49.616, Speaker A: If we don't take this trade, we're going to lose your business. But in the short term, we might get absolutely hosed on that. So what do you do there?
00:06:49.760 - 00:07:57.186, Speaker B: Well, it's a great question. It goes back to what we were talking about earlier about taking risk, right? If you're just going to sit there saying, wow, look, Luna is so volatile, it's selling off rapidly and Santee wants to sell us some, we're just going to make it as defensive as possible so that we ensure that we don't lose money on the trade. We're probably just going to lose the trade. So it's our job to price things tight and right and quickly and take risk when we quote. So what does taking risk mean in the context of one of those volatile tokens that you just mentioned? Well, we're going to have to have some sort of way of running correlations between the prices of those tokens and the prices of things that are a little bit more liquid that we can use to lay off some of the risk. So in doing so, that involves a lot of technology and work on the backend and research to make sure that in real time, you don't have to sit there and go and kick the analysis off from scratch when things are really going crazy, because if that's what you're doing, you're already kind of too late and you're behind the curve. So you sort of have to have these systems that you've designed in advance to watch the price action of the tokens that you're being expected to quote, no matter how volatile or bespoke or liquid they may be.
00:07:57.186 - 00:08:36.402, Speaker B: And you have to have already thought through exactly what you're going to do in any type of situation, in any type of sort of size that you're being expected to quote so that you can run through that. You know, it's like, like military training, basically. So that when you're out there on the battlefield and things are blowing up, you're not just wondering what to do next. You have a plan, and all of these plans involve risk taking, they involve risk management. And I think that's something that we try to, and it's scenario where we try to differentiate ourselves. We really try to understand the types of risks that we're going to be expected to take in order to make the tightest price. Because if you're not making the tightest price, you're out of the trade.
00:08:36.402 - 00:08:42.652, Speaker B: Eventually you're out of the business. We're always trying to think through these risks and how to manage them appropriately.
00:08:42.788 - 00:09:14.386, Speaker A: Zhenya, maybe throwing it over to you, what is a similar to market makers and trading desks over the last two years when things are going really well? Obviously it's a nice business to be in. When things are hurting, users are maybe leaving the platform, people stop trading, all the liquidity dries up. What does the exchange business look like over the last, maybe, let's call it 60 to 90 days, when things do start blowing up in crypto, what are the maybe the things that happen behind the scenes that we, the users and the traders aren't actually seeing?
00:09:14.570 - 00:10:12.454, Speaker C: Yeah, good question. So, you know, I think the, the number one thing, you know, that keeps exchanges alive, of course, is, you know, is the liquidity on the platform. So the, I mean, aside from the fact that, you know, you have to keep your platform up and running to begin with. Right. If you have, you know, the first base covered, the second most important thing is to make sure there's enough liquidity on the platform and people are able to execute trades and, you know, directionally, both sides, people are able to buy and sell. So I think the most challenging thing, and we've seen this over the last two market cycles, is in bear markets, the toughest thing is to be able to maintain proper liquidity on platforms. So the way that most exchanges do this is they have all sorts of market making programs with large liquidity providers, such as Cumberland being one of them, aside from several dozen other probably major popular ones globally.
00:10:12.454 - 00:11:09.790, Speaker C: So the number one thing is for sure, maintaining liquidity, making sure uptime on the exchange is fine. And I'd say the third one, which I think people are starting to probably take a little bit more seriously, given the last couple of months, is the trustworthiness and solvency of exchange. So we've seen this with a lot of platforms recently where we've had withdrawals suspended. We've had certain additional trading limitations put on retail clients and major clients. And so you want to make sure that the platform that you're trading on certainly is trustworthy and solvent and can actually execute the thing that you need for it to execute. So I'd say those are the three main things that everyone is really contending with right now. But certainly, if I were to rank them, liquidity absolutely is king.
00:11:09.862 - 00:11:34.798, Speaker A: Yeah. Santi, can I actually pick on you for this? I was joking about thousand BTC trade earlier, but if you want to put on a trade in size, how do you think about doing it through one of three options? I think option a is you go through an exchange, you go through someone like a bitmex, b as you go through an OTC desk, and c is you go through maybe a prime broker. So how do you think about what avenue you choose for your trading?
00:11:34.886 - 00:12:17.732, Speaker D: I guess it really depends on the type of asset that you're trading and where you see the type of liquidity. Oftentimes it's on chain. And so, but one of the things that. Not now, but in the early days, I was quite sensitive and still am in terms of, you know, when I go out there and ping one of the, one of these desks, I just sometimes have observed that the market kind of moves pretty quickly. And so you sort of, I mean, of course, like Jonah and Janet, like you guys would probably take a long term view in terms of, if you start doing that often, then. Then I have realized some desks are having their own prop capital and are trading against me and trying to front run me. And so it's kind of very disappointing.
00:12:17.732 - 00:12:55.550, Speaker D: It does happen a lot more often than you would think. Like, it's just, I think by virtue of certain desks are a little bit less sophisticated and professional. But I definitely always, I never use just one provider. I always go out to multiple folks to get, obviously, the best type of quote and then, and then execute. I mean, I think that, not to give too much away, but I don't ever want to work just with one unless the terms are very compelling. But, yeah, a lot goes on into it. Not to bore you to details, but the front running element and just is important.
00:12:55.550 - 00:13:05.622, Speaker D: And also the signaling, which is, especially for some not so much bitcoin ETH, but some of the other more kind of long tail of assets, it becomes much more important.
00:13:05.798 - 00:13:20.702, Speaker A: Jonah, can you get into that? Just talk more about what Santi is talking about, front running. Like, what are the mechanisms there? What, how do you guys make sure that that's not happening on your end? But maybe more importantly for the folks that do do it, what does that look like? It feels like a very short term game exactly.
00:13:20.758 - 00:14:28.374, Speaker B: So it's the type of thing where you can ask yourself, how do you make money off of a certain type of flow in a way that people are going to continue coming back to your desk and asking for more? Or how do you do stuff where people, over time, just say, enough of these guys, like, we're going to stop trading here because we keep noticing adverse outcomes. So what is front running? Front running is when, let's say, Santee comes in and says, I want to buy 1000 BTC, and then waits a minute or two before saying done. Desks that aren't necessarily professional or, you know, forthcoming will be buying that thousand BTC before they give Santee the price. So the price will just tick up and then they'll say, done. And I think that's a fairly unprofessional practice that we wouldn't do here. However, like Santi said, it goes on, right? And the people that do it, they lose their counterparties, and before long, they're out of business. I think in terms of ways that OTC desks sort of earn their stripes.
00:14:28.374 - 00:14:51.810, Speaker B: Let's say that Sante came in and wanted to buy $10 million worth of something that's a little bit less liquid, a little bit further out the risk curve, say, aave, for example. If we can say done on a price that looks interesting to Santi, and then obviously we're going to go and hedge with something correlated, maybe ETH, maybe not. Maybe some other token that we've done the analysis.
00:14:51.842 - 00:14:53.766, Speaker D: Maybe like a DeFi perpendicular.
00:14:53.766 - 00:15:46.414, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. Some index. Right? And Santee's going to notice that the price of Aave doesn't really move during the quote, and then for a few days or maybe even longer, we're sort of in this call it basis trade where we're short Aave to Santi and we're long something that we've hedged against it, and then we work out of it intelligently over a long period of time and minimize our market impact that way. That's work that Santee doesn't want to have to do himself to buy the aave, right? He's not going to want to go and buy that index and then slowly bleed it into Aave over time. And that's where OTC desks really differentiate themselves. And during crazy markets, like what you were asking about earlier, you'll notice that the people who haven't done this work, they just vanish, right. And screens go blank and things that you just have this sort of air pocket where liquidity disappears and it's you know, during times like that, it feels pretty good to be a well capitalized liquidity provider both on exchange and OTC.
00:15:46.534 - 00:16:27.162, Speaker D: Can we talk about that liquidity positioning? Because one of the things I didn't mention is increasingly now you want to make sure that the counterparty at the moment where you get the quote, like the delivery is going to be sound. And can you talk about the type of different provider or service providers that are in desk that are in the market? And what is something that you can observe by, like, what is, like, what is the worst case scenario and the counterparty risk that exists? Because I think a lot of people are now thinking, hey, if I use x desk, are they going to be able to follow through? And if there's so much volatility in the market, are they going to explode? Can they explode? Just talking a little bit more about those kinds of risks would be great.
00:16:27.298 - 00:16:56.304, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, absolutely. So I guess earlier Jason was talking a little bit about the different types of trading. Right. Trading is so vast. What does the word trading even mean? You have prop trading positioning, basically, and then you have market making. Within the world of market making, which is what we're talking about, there's a vast array of types of market making trades. And to get into some of those OTC over the counter, where you're sort of chatting us up and trading directly with us, that's just one type.
00:16:56.304 - 00:17:41.160, Speaker B: Another type is on exchange liquidity provisions. So no matter where you're trading, whether it's on BitMex or over the phone with us, you're probably finding your way into our liquidity systems one way or another. And in terms of the risks that can actually sort of materialize as a result of these trades, counterparty risk. I think one thing that a lot of participants in the market worry about is that if they're trading with somebody, like, we're pretty well capitalized, we're backed by a traditional finance company. We prioritize risk management. So maybe it's less of an issue with us. But for certain fly by night shops out there, if you were to say, done with one of them, you go and let's say you're buying bitcoin.
00:17:41.160 - 00:18:09.266, Speaker B: So you send your dollars off to bucket shop x. And this is the same in any market. It has nothing to do with crypto specifically. You send your dollars to this company, and then you're expecting some coin and it never shows up. That's a problem for you in any market. Trust is particularly paramount and in market making and trading in general, crypto, because it's so volatile. It matters so much more.
00:18:09.266 - 00:18:49.146, Speaker B: So I think you'll find that the better the risk management and risk taking capabilities of the person you're trading with, you can gauge that however you like. You're going to find you're going to get your liquidity faster, your tokens are going to show up in your wallet more quickly, they're going to, you're going to get more reliable, tighter pricing. And if you trade with exchanges instead of direct via OTC, that's just a layer in between. An exchange is just a layer in between. The end user, who's ultimately taking risk, and the liquidity provider, who's streaming that liquidity out to a variety of venues. Does that kind of make sense?
00:18:49.330 - 00:19:15.006, Speaker A: It's really interesting. Jenia, can I pick on you for this? There's this saying in exchanges are really just trading liquidity, but gets liquidity. So more trading volume equals higher. I think I'm going to get this right. More trading volume equals high at market maker profits, which means more liquidity provided, which means less slippage and tighter spreads, which means better pricing for traders, which means more trading volume. And that feedback loop continues. I guess I maybe a two part question.
00:19:15.006 - 00:19:49.884, Speaker A: Like, what is the hardest part? Like, there are different feedback loop, uh, feedback loops that drive blockworks business. Right. And I have an internal mental model of what are the almost easy parts of that feedback loop to increase leverage on? And what are the hard parts that I'm always trying to kind of push that boulder up the hill when you're sitting in your seat running the spot exchange at Bitmex? What are the, like, the easy parts of that feedback loop that you're like, all right, I know how to do that. I know how to amplify that. And what are the parts right now where you're like, damn, this keeps me up at night? Like, I'm not the feedback loops, not, I need to connect it closer. You know what I'm saying?
00:19:50.044 - 00:20:46.748, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. It's a really good question. And, you know, I get asked this a lot about kind of the internal mechanics and dynamics within the exchange. So I think, you know, just speaking in broad strokes, the most delicate and oftentimes the most challenging part with managing, quote unquote, liquidity on a centralized exchange is having an equal balance of participants. Right? And so what I mean by this is oftentimes, most market participants get bucketed into one of two categories. So you have, generally speaking, institutional traders. So, you know, hedge funds, you know, macro firms, trading shops, prop shops, independent crypto firms, whatever, anyone that's like a professional trading firm or let's say a corporation that gets those, those folks usually get bucketed into that, into that category.
00:20:46.748 - 00:21:57.304, Speaker C: And the second category, of course, is retail. So, you know, your average basic user may not necessarily, you know, be the most well versed in trading or is just starting out or is just, you know, small independent trade. So you have these two camps, and a lot of the market dynamics have to do with the interplay of these two camps in managing liquidity on an exchange, be it the spot exchange, which I'm responsible for, or the proper derivatives exchange. You want to make sure you have a pretty decent balance of both of these types of actors, especially in bear markets and these market downturns where things are uncertain and particularly volatile, you have a pullback of retail. So retail is not as excited. Maybe they got liquidated, they got washed out, and they're hurting. You have a dislocation of more institutional guys mostly trading against each other versus institutional guys sniping off retail in more hot market conditions.
00:21:57.304 - 00:22:36.700, Speaker C: Again, just to land the plane here, for me personally, it's really just understanding and figuring out how to balance those two. And of course, there's different, you know, there's different ways to incentivize both of those camps, right? They have, they work on different incentives and so really understanding, you know, the, how to reach both of those, how to speak to them. They speak different languages. They care about different things. Right. Most, most of retail doesn't give a shit about, you know, about what they're paying in terms of fees or at least, you know, the, you know, the basic retail traders, they don't they, or they care less, rather, I should say market makers and institutional traders are a lot more sensitive to fees. They care about these things.
00:22:36.700 - 00:22:53.188, Speaker C: They care about rebates. They care about discounts and all this sort of stuff. So it's a fine balance between those two things. And like I said, especially during kind of market downturns, you want to really think these things through and kind of review them a little bit more often.
00:22:53.316 - 00:23:04.496, Speaker A: Yeah, Jonah, when you have in these down markets, Zhenya said, retail leaves the market. So now youve just got smart money against smart money. What are the dynamics that shake out there?
00:23:04.680 - 00:23:56.740, Speaker B: Actually, I think theres a bit more retail activity than youd think in these markets, and it ends up getting packaged. And we see it in various ways, either through exchanges or through other pipelines. But I think whats going on in this bear market right now is youre having this massive risk transfer from the hands of sort of balance sheets, really, of companies that are forced to liquidate. They don't necessarily want to, but they have to onto the balance sheets of the people who've been sitting on the sidelines kind of waiting for their chance to get it. And so some of that is pretty orderly. Some of that can be disorderly. Ultimately, I think usually the way that you see these things play out right is, um, the market will sort of be trading in a certain range, then liquidity volumes will just kind of vaporize.
00:23:56.740 - 00:24:46.630, Speaker B: Trading just stops. And what that tells you is, uh oh, like, this isn't the right price for, you know, this. This price set is an incentivizing trading between the types of institutions that need to get stuff done, the people who need to sell and the people who have the ability to buy, but maybe don't want to buy at these prices. So when, when you get these sort of air pockets in liquidity and volume, usually that tells you there's a big price move coming. And we saw that about a month and a half ago, immediately preceding the collapse, and then boom. Now, when the market is in the midst of this slide, you want to know what's going on under the hood of the liquidity engine that is crypto micro structure. Ultimately, what's going on is nobody wants to catch the falling knife, not even the most well capitalized institutions in the world.
00:24:46.630 - 00:25:15.394, Speaker B: And there are other people that just have to sell. So they're just blasting through bids. Those bids might be your dentist, mom and pop, it might be the occasional act of bravery going on from some institution. But ultimately, there's not a lot trading and a lot of price movement. And then you end up finding this equilibrium where people say, hey, this is a really attractive price set. These could potentially be generational levels to get long crypto. And then you see institution versus institution trading.
00:25:15.394 - 00:25:49.036, Speaker B: Usually retail isn't as involved in those sorts of immediate stabilization events. And then ultimately, like when you talk about institutions, at the end of the day, institutions are run by people. So there's not a whole big difference between institutions and people when it comes to the psychology of these moves, because everybody would rather buy a nice little bounce off the lows than try to pick the bottom. Even big companies that are run by, you know, people whose incentives are kind of the same as the guys trading on some platform at home.
00:25:49.100 - 00:26:19.968, Speaker A: Jonah, you had this tweet, this quote, this is my first crypto winter, but I've traded through plenty of savage tradfi winters in oil and fx and in credit starting my career at Lehman Brothers, the worst of it is always triggered by the disappearance of credit. That is precisely what's happening in crypto right now. I would love to get your take on, and then, Jenny, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this, too, just, like, how much leverage is left in the system. Have we wiped out all of the leverage? There's still a little bit to go. I'd love to get your take on that, Jonah.
00:26:20.056 - 00:26:57.854, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, thanks for bringing that up. I think it's pretty relevant, honestly. People are very, very focused on this particular crypto bear market, but it doesn't feel that different from when oil went negative in 2020 or when I was just starting out at Lehman Brothers and the whole thing went bankrupt. The world was wondering, hey, are we going to have a, you know, financial system tomorrow? So ultimately, it's. These cycles are just kind of driven by the availability of credit and the ability of participants in the market to do what they want to do when they want to do it. When there's no credit, people are forced to sell stuff when they don't want to. And that's.
00:26:57.854 - 00:27:06.904, Speaker B: That's kind of what we're seeing at the moment. It's. Or what we were seeing, I guess I should say. And part of this stabilization that's been going on in crypto has been.
00:27:09.404 - 00:27:09.740, Speaker D: More.
00:27:09.772 - 00:28:01.442, Speaker B: Broadly indicative of the fact that there's not a lot of liquidation left to do at these levels. Now, let's say that you can visualize this on chain in various ways. Off chain, it's a bit harder. But if the price of bitcoin were to sell off another 50%, and I'm absolutely not saying that's what's going to happen, you would probably see some more liquidations, but at current levels, you just don't need to liquidate much more in the digital asset space. And I think that's a sign that there are a bunch of different cycles. We could talk about macro crypto, the relationship between the two, but as far as the crypto specific credit and liquidity cycle is concerned, unless something hits us out of left field, which I don't think will happen at this point, I think we're. We're in the 8th, 8th inning, maybe 9th inning of the crypto specific liquidations.
00:28:01.578 - 00:28:42.662, Speaker C: I think Jonah's correct in terms of where we're at in the context of innings, for sure. It feels like we're getting to the end of flushing out most of the leverage. I mean, we just had the biggest capitulation for selling event probably in the history of crypto ever over the last two months. And so a lot of the fraud and the off balance sheet leverage has exited. And so, you know, are there going to be other, you know, quote unquote bodies that wash up onshore and, you know, some maybe mid tier smaller companies that eventually surface? And, you know, and it's, you know, it's discovered that they had exposure to, you know, Celsius or three ac or whatever, but maybe there might be a few others.
00:28:42.718 - 00:28:42.910, Speaker A: Right.
00:28:42.942 - 00:29:37.110, Speaker C: But I think the, the big fish have, for the most part, already been discovered. You know, it's, and they, they were pretty big. Right. We had, we had Voyager, right, CelsIus, where the two big ones, blockFi, was affected, Babel finance, and there's a ton of other kind of more centralized exchanges that were affected as well and that needed all sorts of bailouts. And so I think we're definitely almost at the finish line in terms of uncovering where most of the leverage was. But I think another important thing to take note of, which I think a lot of people are underestimating, and this is, I'll give credit to you mentioned you had Dan on from CMS yesterday. He actually pointed this out and several others have recently that, you know, we went through a, you know, pretty massive credit crisis over the last, like 60 to 90 days, and no one stepped in for the most part.
00:29:37.110 - 00:30:06.180, Speaker C: No one stepped in and everything is still working right. Things are okay? You know, yes, we had a couple, you know, a couple serious, a couple serious deaths in the industry in terms of, you know, big companies and, you know, big personalities that got wiped out and are no longer with us or are going to be with us in a different form. But for the most part, everything's still functioning. And I think that speaks volumes in terms of kind of the macro and microstructure of the industry.
00:30:06.372 - 00:30:41.998, Speaker D: Can we, is there a way for you to understand your counterparty and are you surprised the folks have gone out of business? I assume you all kind of interact with them in some capacity at some point. Do you get a feeling for the type of counterparty and how much risk they have in their balance sheet and do you rank them? I guess just generally. Are you surprised that a lot of folks got wiped out? It happens every cycle, but I think for a while there are a lot of folks that did get wiped out this time around. I think a lot of people are caught pretty surprised.
00:30:42.176 - 00:31:56.664, Speaker C: Yeah. So I think, you know, I think for me personally, and I'm sure we all probably share some version of this sentiment but for me personally, I think it's the most shocking and, like, gut wrenching thing that was uncovered over the last 60, 90 days is like, how many, you know, how many of the biggest and smartest players in the industry accepted, trust me, bro, as collateral? And, like, that, to me, is just. It's crazy. Like, you look at how much uncollateralized lending went out from publicly traded companies that didn't actually do any of these risk assessments, and the fallout from that is pretty nuts. So, to answer your question, we obviously have a pretty rigorous process in terms of determining creditworthiness internally for anyone that we do business with. So for us personally, there's none of this uncollateralized lending going out and any of this kind of more wildish, outlandish behavior that's speaking for us.
00:31:57.164 - 00:32:40.016, Speaker B: Yeah, we do a lot of the same here. You just sort of have to know who you're trading with in order to assess whether you're going to get what you expect out of each trade. And that's the same for an exchange, a counterparty, an individual. You always want to know. So whatever your process is, we try to be as rigorous as possible about it and as mathematical as we can, just so that ultimately, when somebody comes and trades with us, they can rely on us to be there and not busy covering up some hole that one of our other counterparties has created and causing distractions. So we're pretty careful about it.
00:32:40.120 - 00:33:24.536, Speaker D: Yeah, you guys come from traditional markets, and I am curious. In crypto, you have this universe pocket called Defi and a lot of very transparent information that is happening on chain. There's also a whole host of things that are happening off chain OTC trades for our listeners. It would be great to get your perspective on how you think about this market crypto writ large, but with this component of Defi and how Defi fits into your flow. And do you see that as a threat to your business? Is it actually amplifying what you can do from a risk management perspective? Would be great to get your thoughts on that.
00:33:24.720 - 00:33:46.044, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. I mean, we're big Defi bulls at Cumberland. We love it. We don't really see it as a threat. We see it as an opportunity. I don't know if you guys saw the headline hint, we recently had Cumberland lab go out of stealth to focus specifically on certain types of Defi and other sort of project incubation. Ultimately, Defi is.
00:33:46.044 - 00:34:40.468, Speaker B: It's sort of what finance should be, right? It's this kind of algorithmic, trustworthy source of liquidity for now, it's primarily borrowed lending, but it is what you expect it to be. It behaves algorithmically. You sort of know what it's going to do. Even Luna and Ust did what they were expected to do, right, if you read the white paper. So the beauty of DeFi is that if you just understand where the yields are coming from, and you look into how the protocols work, you can kind of trust it, right, to behave however it was designed to behave. And for us, at least on the market making side, in addition to providing liquidity there and taking liquidity, there's all sorts of interesting stuff going on. Even minting and redeeming stable coins.
00:34:40.468 - 00:35:23.984, Speaker B: Like one leg of that transaction is. Is kind of on chain, right? So ultimately, when you interact with these defi systems, you're augmenting the liquidity that you can provide to people who don't necessarily have access to what you're accessing, or don't know how to access it, or don't know how to do the analysis. So it basically helps us as a company. We want people coming into crypto, we want people to understand crypto and use crypto. And whether you're a user, an institution, a retail trader, a prop trader, another trading house. Like, if we're able to connect more dots, and one of those big dots as Defi, the better. And certain things, there's just no better liquidity than on chain.
00:35:23.984 - 00:35:57.010, Speaker B: Amms are an amazing source of liquidity for some of the riskier tokens out the curve. Maybe not bitcoin and ETH, but if you're going to trade coin number 371 by market cap, why not Uniswap and curve? Insane liquidity for stables? So we're all about it, we love it, and we think that it's at some point, there will be more liquidity on chain than off chain. And that's the direction we're like. We don't want to be surprised by that outcome. We want to be there helping out.
00:35:57.162 - 00:36:38.364, Speaker C: I'll give a quick perspective from our side. There's no question that DeFi platforms have certainly cannibalize some of the, some of the trading volume from centralized exchanges. I'm sure we've all kind of seen the headlines comparing Uniswap and Coinbase volumes over the years. Uniswap has overtaken Coinbase several times and in the last couple of years. So I think just from a numbers perspective, the picture is pretty clear. But I think also Defi users are also a little bit more sophisticated than the average retail trader. These are different types of users for the most part.
00:36:38.364 - 00:37:12.866, Speaker C: Obviously there's some overlap, but they're certainly more sophisticated. They're more comfortable managing their own keys and taking on all sorts of on chain risks that the average retail user is just not going to be able or comfortable to take on. So from that perspective, they are somewhat catering to different markets. As far as the upside of the existence of defi in the exchange world, additional coins for us to list, you know, whether it's perps or on. On the spot exchange. Right. These, ultimately, these two are.
00:37:12.866 - 00:37:28.354, Speaker C: They're complementary. And, you know, there's. There's definitely a. There's definitely like a healthy coexistence between the two. So, you know, while a lot of people try and, you know, frame this as like, oh, one is going to cannibalize the other. Yeah, maybe, maybe a little bit. But I think there's.
00:37:28.354 - 00:37:31.014, Speaker C: There's a healthy balance with the existence of both of them.
00:37:32.334 - 00:38:14.928, Speaker D: I am curious, from your perspective, jonah, you mentioned this lab component that you guys have. I've actually co invested with a few of your folks, and I'm curious, where do you see the most amount of inefficiencies or opportunities to build services, either in your kind of like in off chain land and also in Defi, and especially maybe informed by kind of recent market activity. I think every bear cycle kind of just teaches us, okay, we really need to focus on X or Y. And so I'm curious if you have a particular take on that.
00:38:15.096 - 00:38:56.032, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. Thank you for asking. I think on chain, the most exciting areas to build in DeFi are probably going to be transferring some of the value that's currently being extracted by mev type arbitrageurs and delivering that sort of value to end users. And there are a couple of really interesting protocols that are kind of leveraging the thinking behind Mev and passing it on to the average person who transacts in these worlds. That's very nascent. But personally, I think that's the most exciting opportunity in Defi. I'm not speaking on behalf of Cumberland lab on that one.
00:38:56.032 - 00:39:18.712, Speaker B: That's just the one that, as a trader, I'm most interested in geeking out about off chain. I think a lot of trading companies and a lot of crypto companies in general. There's a lot of shiny objects in this space. It's very easy to get distracted by this or that. Oh, this fortune is getting made over here. Oh, look at that. Let's jump on that.
00:39:18.712 - 00:40:36.278, Speaker B: We're really trying to stick to our core competency. And what we do at Cumberland is we are a trading company, and trading crypto is an extremely technology intensive effort. So as markets mature and crypto is just a market, right, like it's tradable technology, and there are users of that technology. But if you're providing liquidity so that those users can trade this technology like you have to, you have to keep up with the rate at which the market matures, otherwise you get cut out of the trade. So what I think the biggest opportunities to build off chain for a trading company, which is sort of what we're focused on, are ways that allow us to interact with markets faster and ways that allow us to sort of anticipate where the market's going to be. And this is a super interesting systematic problem that we like to spend a lot of time and effort researching, because if you have an idea of directionality, then you're effectively taking risk on every quote in a way that's possibly a little bit smarter than the people who are focused on where crypto was one or 2 seconds ago, and quoting based on that. So any way that we can to make the market tighter and more efficient and more liquid is going to bring more people into crypto, more users, more investors, more hedgers, all of it.
00:40:36.278 - 00:40:40.074, Speaker B: So that's the off chain building thing we're doing.
00:40:40.414 - 00:41:23.324, Speaker A: Hey, Jen, Dan from CMS said one thing on the podcast yesterday that I thought was interesting, which was one of the second order impacts of this market and this bear market right now is massive consolidation with exchange. Specifically, I think he called out for Kraken, FTX, Coinbase and Gemini, saying that these kind of more like retail lenders should not be operating individually. Rather they should probably be part of a bigger exchange with a bigger balance sheet. How are you? I'm assuming you can't talk to Bitmex, M and A, but can you talk to more broadly, a, if you can't talk to Bitmex, M and A, do that, but B, if you can't do that, talk more generally about how you see consolidation going with exchanges over the next several months.
00:41:23.824 - 00:42:33.924, Speaker C: Yeah, for sure. So I think in general, it's pretty obvious that in these sorts of market conditions, you're going to have distressed assets, distressed teams, distressed IP, all of which is very interesting for some of the bigger players, especially ones that have kind of glaring holes in their, let's say, in their wider business plans and product offerings. I can't speak too much about what we're doing, but I would say as a general observation, and many people have pointed this out over the last few months. We're going to have a pretty dramatic m and a buying spree over the next, I would guess probably six to twelve months. We've already seen a little bit of a preview of this over the last little bit, but I really expect this to ramp up. I think the big one to watch right now, of course, is Voyager. I think they rejected FTX's offer like yesterday or the day before that, calling it a low ball offer and all this stuff.
00:42:33.924 - 00:43:03.724, Speaker C: And people can read about this online, but I think that's going to be the big one. They have a ton of users, ton of IP. It's obviously a lot of assets. It'll be interesting to watch that. And I think there's going to be a lot of, you know, downstream effects from that. You know, it's, it'll be, I think it'll be a hot summer for acquisitions. So, you know, probably like between now and like end of September, I think we're going to see a couple high profile ones take place.
00:43:03.884 - 00:43:40.362, Speaker D: Yeah, that's great, guys. Well, I want to go to a fire round before we wrap it up. Before, before we do that, I want to ask you guys question, which is how much of a threat do you see existing financial institutions, fidelities of the world come into the space? Are you seeing them and behind the scenes, do you think that it will be very easy for them to replicate what you're doing? Or is there a lot of know how related to crypto that would require, you know, that you think that you guys have built kind of a moat around. Curious to think about, curious to get your perspective on that.
00:43:40.548 - 00:44:16.076, Speaker B: I would say a lot of the crypto trading stack looks very similar to a traditional market. I worked at Goldman and then VTOL, big fossil fuel company. A lot of it looks pretty familiar, to be honest. It's the last mile of crypto that gets super weird. And I think it's going to take a lot of effort for some. You mentioned fidelity, right? A company like that, I don't think they're going to be interested in trying to compete with Cumberland. I think they're going to be more interested, hopefully in partnering with Cumberland.
00:44:16.076 - 00:44:37.414, Speaker B: And we are seeing institutions like those come in and either attempt to partner with us or just use the liquidity services that we offer or other types of things on the trading side to help them accomplish their goals. I think there's always going to be competition. We're just doing our best to stay ahead of it, you know?
00:44:37.754 - 00:45:54.214, Speaker C: Yeah, I think, you know, just in terms of, let's say, traditional players coming in and, you know, for example, competing in the exchange space, I think that'll be, you know, quite difficult at this point. You know, certainly not impossible and, you know, let's never say never, but, you know, from the exchange perspective, you know, we already have a pretty mature ecosystem globally, not just offshore, onshore. If you look at the tapestry of the exchange ecosystem, it's pretty remarkable and very impressive with how things have developed and matured, especially over the last two, three years. The suite of offerings, the sophistication, the liquidity. It's pretty impressive to think about bigger, more traditional players coming in and, you know, trying to spin up an exchange and, you know, try and compete on those grounds. I'm finding it very hard to, you know, to see it play out that way. And, you know, and we've seen this over the years with some, you know, some traditional finance guys try and do this, like with Bakkt and with Aerosex, and, you know, just these things just never really took off.
00:45:54.214 - 00:46:12.414, Speaker C: And there's, you know, there's a whole number of reasons why. Yeah. In those two examples, particularly not to pick on them, but just those are the ones that stick out. There's. There's reasons why they didn't work out. Right. And, you know, it's just, I find it hard to see others try and kind of cannibalize the existing ecosystem, but, you know, crazier things have happened.
00:46:12.414 - 00:46:13.834, Speaker C: So we'll see.
00:46:14.174 - 00:46:30.542, Speaker B: Exchanges do have pretty nice moats. Trading companies swallow each other whole regularly. So I think the fact that we've been around since 2014 shows you that we. We paddle pretty hard. But, yeah, it's. There's always a threat out there, no?
00:46:30.678 - 00:46:31.394, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:46:31.814 - 00:46:48.832, Speaker D: All right, guys, well, this has been great discussion. I do want to end it with a fire round of questions. So, you know, I guess the format is. I'll just ask you a question, and both of you, you know, try to respond fairly quickly. Sure. Not to put you on the spot, but I will. So, first off, how many hours of sleep, like, do you get? Crypto's 24 hours.
00:46:48.832 - 00:46:52.124, Speaker D: 24. 7365 market. How much sleep do you guys get?
00:46:52.824 - 00:46:53.936, Speaker B: 7 hours.
00:46:54.120 - 00:46:57.144, Speaker C: Yeah, same. Six to seven is a. Is a pretty good night.
00:46:57.224 - 00:46:57.624, Speaker A: Wow.
00:46:57.704 - 00:47:01.464, Speaker C: And then a couple, you know, 20 minutes naps in between the day. Great.
00:47:01.544 - 00:47:05.884, Speaker D: Favorite metric, KPI that you have on your screen?
00:47:06.344 - 00:47:07.400, Speaker B: Volumes.
00:47:07.592 - 00:47:11.164, Speaker C: Yeah, I would say open interest and volumes as well.
00:47:11.664 - 00:47:21.076, Speaker D: Price target for bitcoin and ethanol over the next year. This time around. Next year. None of this financial advice meaningfully higher.
00:47:21.140 - 00:47:22.344, Speaker B: Thank you for saying that.
00:47:24.724 - 00:47:25.156, Speaker A: Jenny.
00:47:25.180 - 00:47:26.188, Speaker D: You can't say that.
00:47:26.356 - 00:47:37.508, Speaker C: Yeah, no, no, I'm not going to say that. I'll give you actual numbers. I'll say 55 bitcoin and 2300.
00:47:37.636 - 00:47:39.744, Speaker D: Biggest risk in the industry.
00:47:40.474 - 00:47:59.094, Speaker C: Oh, my God. Call to personality Ponzi schemes. You know, I'd say those are the big ones. And sorry not to riff on this too much, but we need a mass depositification within the ecosystem and, you know, there's a lot of, like, self policing that needs to improve. But, yeah, those are the two big things for me.
00:47:59.474 - 00:48:03.254, Speaker A: Jenny, what are the remaining. What are the remaining ponzi's that need to get worked out?
00:48:03.834 - 00:48:09.848, Speaker C: Oh, man. I don't want to pick on anyone in particular.
00:48:09.896 - 00:48:13.164, Speaker A: You were bold enough to give the price points. You'd be bold enough.
00:48:13.944 - 00:48:48.874, Speaker C: Yeah. Look, I think, just speaking in broad strokes again, I don't want to pick on anyone in particular. And I love NFTs have had a pretty decent run in the last year, and it's been really interesting to explore that space. But God damn it, there are so many scams and ponzis in that space. It makes the ICO era look like child's play and. And like, they're so sophisticated and people are just, they're just, people are so brazen with NFT scams. It's just, it makes your head spin.
00:48:48.874 - 00:49:06.886, Speaker C: But, yeah, that. That would be kind of, that'd be my big one because. Sorry. And the reason I say that is because it's also. NFTs have become a big retail gateway into the. Into the industry. Right? So, like, you don't want to have the top of the funnel users being picked off by scams as they're trying to get into the industry.
00:49:06.886 - 00:49:14.502, Speaker C: Right. So it just, it hurts everyone. And I think there's more self policing that needs to be, you know, needs to be present while we're on this.
00:49:14.518 - 00:49:38.970, Speaker D: Tangent, and I will betray our rules, but if price were never to go down, is it a scam or a ponzi? Because a lot of times we call a ponzi, we call a scam a ponzi when price goes down. And I'm curious, of course, if the price of the NFT never goes down, it could be a ponzi. But people may never call it a ponzi, terra, might you? I mean, like, we use these terms interchangeably, or flip that.
00:49:39.002 - 00:49:50.154, Speaker A: It's like, if I'm. I think a lot of people call some NFT projects a Ponzi might not be a Ponzi. It's just a really shitty project with like. Yeah, shitty project never looks cute on anything.
00:49:50.274 - 00:50:28.334, Speaker C: Yeah. So there's different versions of this. So in my mind, there's like the. The two worst versions of this is teams over promising. Here's a roadmap of ten things that we're going to do in the next year and either immediately rugging or slow rugging and they're just gone. Or the other version of this is they'll release one collection or one set of items and then immediately go out and release a second one and a third one and totally ignore, you know, the first one and don't build anything. And it just exists and there's no additional value brought to these projects.
00:50:28.334 - 00:50:56.802, Speaker C: That's where I feel like a lot. Let's perhaps put it more in the scam category rather than sponsor category. There's a lot of that. And then you have more complicated dynamics with projects, adding tokens and staking and all sorts of stuff that it can really be gamified and can really be played, uh, over, over the mid to long term. So I don't know. Uh, I mean, I'm also just. I'm biased because I spent a lot of time in that space, but.
00:50:56.802 - 00:50:57.494, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:50:58.354 - 00:51:01.250, Speaker D: Okay, well, jonah, over to you. Biggest risk.
00:51:01.442 - 00:51:16.814, Speaker B: Biggest risk, I think is just more bad risk management. Right? Like, you just, you don't need any more blow ups. I think if people just say, hey, what, what am I actually doing with all this money? And think about it for 10 seconds, then we're good.
00:51:17.194 - 00:51:18.538, Speaker D: No more long term capital management.
00:51:18.586 - 00:51:24.250, Speaker B: Or hopefully, hopefully this rinse has cleaned out the people that aren't really focused.
00:51:24.322 - 00:51:32.054, Speaker D: Like that great thing that excites you the most. It could be a project. It could be not a project, just a theme.
00:51:32.514 - 00:51:57.388, Speaker B: Oh. I mean, honestly, maybe I'm too deep into the weeds of commodities, but I think tokenizing pretty much anything is the most exciting reason to be in crypto. Like, I think this is. Yeah, crypto rails are just better. And they're not like 3% better, they're 300% better than a lot of traditional financial rails, particularly some of the things that I saw in the commodities industry. So that's what gets me excited. I want to trade digital commodities.
00:51:57.556 - 00:52:02.260, Speaker D: So you're long tokenizing real world assets with all the complexities of that.
00:52:02.372 - 00:52:06.740, Speaker B: Yeah. And minting and redeeming them into the tokenized world.
00:52:06.932 - 00:52:07.468, Speaker D: Got it.
00:52:07.516 - 00:52:52.984, Speaker C: Yeah. I mean, I think we've already kind of established the importance and dominance of stable coins over the last two to three years, but I still think we have a long way to go with stables. There's a lot more that can be done. There's, you know, there's a lot more other currencies that could be turned into stables and not just, you know, the market is obviously dominated by us dollar stable coins, but I still think there's that long tail of other currencies that could be tokenized. Is definitely something interesting to watch, uh, over the next few years. Um, and then the other thing I'll say, uh, which is a little bit more of a left field thing, is, uh, I'm a big fan of what, uh, what tether and Bitfinex launched, uh, this, this week. It's a p two p video chat app called Keat.
00:52:52.984 - 00:53:05.178, Speaker C: I encourage everyone to check that out. Super cool. Definitely didn't expect those guys to put that out. Um, and really speaks to the, you know, to Paula Arduino's, you know, technical prowess. So, big fan of what those guys are doing.
00:53:05.316 - 00:53:23.942, Speaker D: I'm going to ding you if you ever do another more than ten second response, but I'll slap you. There's charge of five USDT question. Do you think the US dollar loses its status as the world reserve currency in the next five or ten years?
00:53:24.078 - 00:53:34.528, Speaker B: I don't think so, but I think that you can have more than one global reserve currency and all you need is a few basis points of global commerce to be denominated in BTC. Before I was going to ask you.
00:53:34.536 - 00:53:38.696, Speaker D: Is it BTC or is it like the renminbi or some other sovereign currency?
00:53:38.760 - 00:53:46.124, Speaker B: I think way, way more likely to be bitcoin or ETH than renminbi or anything else.
00:53:46.424 - 00:54:03.456, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't think it'll lose its status. I think the loss of status has been greatly over exaggerated and the Fed is the driving seat right now. Nothing's going to change, at least in the short term, in my opinion, is inflationary.
00:54:03.560 - 00:54:05.440, Speaker D: Have we peaked inflation, yes or no?
00:54:05.512 - 00:54:06.164, Speaker B: Yes.
00:54:07.024 - 00:54:08.444, Speaker C: Yeah, I think pretty close.
00:54:09.024 - 00:54:12.684, Speaker B: Inflation is going to continue, but I don't think it'll keep running this hot.
00:54:14.624 - 00:54:23.072, Speaker D: Favorite book ever? Oh, recent or ever? We'd like to give book recommendations or movies, but let's start with books.
00:54:23.208 - 00:54:25.284, Speaker B: Just read snow crash. It's pretty awesome.
00:54:27.144 - 00:54:29.440, Speaker C: Man. Search for a meeting by Viktor Frankl.
00:54:29.472 - 00:54:30.124, Speaker D: Viktor.
00:54:30.584 - 00:54:31.232, Speaker C: Nice.
00:54:31.368 - 00:54:46.736, Speaker D: Yeah, both great, great books. This might require more than 5 seconds, which is okay, I'll make an exception and I promise we're coming to an end here. You guys think, well, what is it that you wish you knew when you got started in crypto that you know now?
00:54:46.920 - 00:55:31.752, Speaker B: I would say I wish I realized just how easy it is to lose an enormous amount of money given. Like, when you trade oil, right? You think it's volatile because for every dollar you put in, you could lose $0.30 in crypto. For every dollar you put in, you can lose 100 cents. Right. So I'm not saying that's going to happen to bitcoin or ETH, but this topic of risk management and providing liquidity and all these things that we've been discussing, this whole podcast is sort of like, you have to adapt your risk management thinking when the volatility of what you're trading is just this high. So I'd say I wish I had.
00:55:31.752 - 00:55:34.632, Speaker B: You can't really know it coming in. You just have to feel it.
00:55:34.728 - 00:56:01.600, Speaker C: Yeah, I would say the ability to just be patient and just wait and not do anything. And the reason for that is, I think some of the folks in my orbit, at least, that have been the most successful and the most profitable over the last, you know, five to seven years, have just been patient. They just. They make their bets, you know, they don't. They're not monitoring and checking prices every 10 seconds. Right. They're just.
00:56:01.600 - 00:56:18.340, Speaker C: They're just comfortable with. With kind of the long term view, and it's obviously not for everybody, and people have different straight trading strategies and all that jazz, but I'd say, you know, just. Just having that ability to just sit still and not do anything, especially when there's all this, like, chaotic noise around you, I think that's a very underrated skill.
00:56:18.472 - 00:56:23.500, Speaker D: Sound advice from some of the mixers. Business off of volume, but I do agree with that. I appreciate it.
00:56:23.692 - 00:56:24.684, Speaker C: Jason, any other.
00:56:24.764 - 00:56:25.904, Speaker D: More questions?
00:56:26.724 - 00:56:33.132, Speaker A: No, I don't. This is great, guys. I learned a ton. I really appreciate you guys coming on.
00:56:33.308 - 00:56:41.692, Speaker D: This is great. Any parting thoughts or anything else that you want to impress on your listeners? This has been a great discussion, but I don't know if there's anything else that you guys want to. Parting thoughts?
00:56:41.788 - 00:57:02.170, Speaker C: Yeah, I'll go first. I'll plug. One of the cool new things we're launching very shortly is FX perpetual. So these are the world's first crypto margin perpetual FX swaps. We're going to have a whole ton of currencies available, up to 50 x leverage, and that's coming out next week. So super exciting. We just launched a new app.
00:57:02.170 - 00:57:07.538, Speaker C: The token's coming, so I'll just use an opportunity to plug those things. And obviously very, very excited for that.
00:57:07.626 - 00:57:11.410, Speaker A: Zhenya, I know that was a plug but can I actually just ask you a question on perps here?
00:57:11.562 - 00:57:12.058, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:57:12.146 - 00:57:18.568, Speaker A: Which is why. What is the why behind that? What is that allow that doesn't exist in the market today.
00:57:18.696 - 00:57:34.764, Speaker C: Yeah. So basically, it allows people to speculate on some of the most popular foreign currencies using crypto as margin. In short, that's the big use case.
00:57:35.064 - 00:57:37.344, Speaker A: Cool. Jonah, last thoughts?
00:57:37.504 - 00:57:53.254, Speaker B: Yeah, I would say I don't really have a plug other than just trade with us. We're here for you and read our commentaries on Twitter and debate and, you know, always eager to learn what other people are thinking and be part of the conversation.
00:57:53.594 - 00:57:53.970, Speaker D: Cool.
00:57:54.002 - 00:58:10.134, Speaker A: We'll plug you guys in the show notes, put your twitters. Yeah, we'll put your guys twitters in the show notes and. Yeah, this was awesome, Santi, the joy that these, the rapid fire questions brought you at the end, the childish smile. I have a feeling I'm getting a telegram message after this from you saying, we're doing that every time.
00:58:10.194 - 00:58:20.754, Speaker D: So we're definitely doing this again, guys. This is the first time we interacted with this format. I appreciate you being on the spot, and we won't thank you too much for giving long responses, but, you know, it's fine. It's okay.
00:58:21.334 - 00:58:22.838, Speaker C: I only got dinged once.
00:58:23.006 - 00:58:29.470, Speaker D: Yeah, well, actually twice, but that's okay. Next time we have you, we'll have to have you both guys on and we'll make sure to police that rule more.
00:58:29.502 - 00:58:29.694, Speaker C: So.
00:58:29.734 - 00:58:42.824, Speaker D: So, really appreciate guys coming on. Very interesting discussion, especially everything is going on in crypto. So appreciate, obviously, you guys are experts in the field and. And you should come back sometime soon to continue the discussion, but otherwise, really appreciate the time.
00:58:43.164 - 00:58:44.684, Speaker C: Thanks, guys. Really appreciate it.
00:58:44.764 - 00:58:45.404, Speaker B: Yeah, likewise.
