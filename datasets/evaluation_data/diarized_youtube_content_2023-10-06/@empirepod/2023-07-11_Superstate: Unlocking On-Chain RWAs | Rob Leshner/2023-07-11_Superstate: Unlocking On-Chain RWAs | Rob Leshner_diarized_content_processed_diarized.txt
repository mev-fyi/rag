We are joined again by Robert Leshner, who has been on the show before, but for a different thing that he was working on now. Uh, Robert, you recently announced super state. So super excited to chat with you about this. Uh, welcome back to Empire.
00:01:05.468 - 00:01:09.180, Speaker B: Thanks for having me back. Super excited about talking about super state.
00:01:09.292 - 00:01:13.676, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. It's a nice name. It's like, you know, super state. It's exciting, you know?
00:01:13.780 - 00:01:18.284, Speaker B: Yeah. Like, in, like, you know, 50 years, we'll have, like, the super state arena, you know, for some sports team.
00:01:18.404 - 00:01:25.184, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, you've been thinking about that. I know you have 50 year planned. What, uh, what, what sports team would you, uh, would you sponsor?
00:01:25.304 - 00:01:32.208, Speaker B: Um, you know, probably in 50 years, the most popular sport will be pickleball or an esport. So, you know, something like that.
00:01:32.296 - 00:01:39.336, Speaker A: Yeah, you're probably right. You're probably right. Are you sad that you have to give up? Uh, are you not playing as much chess now? And I saw you were getting pretty good out there.
00:01:39.440 - 00:01:52.460, Speaker B: You know, there was a while where I was spending, like, a lot of time on chess. Um, my ratings are going stale and a little bit down because I have not been taking as much time. But, you know, there was a one year period where I was definitely learning how to play chess.
00:01:52.572 - 00:02:05.116, Speaker A: Nice. I was complaining to my wife the other day. I was like, yeah, I'm spending way too much time on my phone. She's like, all right, well, let's look into. Let's look at your phone. Like, you can see where you're spending time on the apps. It was like 1 hour texting, like 1 hour on email or whatever.
00:02:05.116 - 00:02:09.340, Speaker A: It's like 6 hours on chess.com. She's like, well, this is where it's going.
00:02:09.452 - 00:02:12.344, Speaker B: Well, personal question. What's your rating on chess.com?
00:02:13.004 - 00:02:17.344, Speaker A: Not good enough to be spending 6 hours. I'm a 1200.
00:02:17.484 - 00:02:19.952, Speaker B: So do you play bullet, blitz, or rapid?
00:02:20.088 - 00:02:34.192, Speaker A: So this is one of my problems. I was just playing a bunch of, like, bullet and blitz games. And so I actually just got a chess coach, and he's like, you got to go to the, you know, 1015 2020 minutes games to really, to really start to, like, learn how to play. Right?
00:02:34.208 - 00:02:39.416, Speaker B: That's how you learn how to play. That's great. You'll. I look forward to watching your rating, you know, march up over time.
00:02:39.480 - 00:02:54.224, Speaker A: We'll see. We'll see. Austin. Well, let's. Let's chat super state. So my TLDR high level understanding is superstate is going to buy short term government debt, tokenize it on blockchains. But would love to hear your, I think, like, two things.
00:02:54.224 - 00:03:02.080, Speaker A: The vision for the company, but also, like, the why behind why this is the most exciting and biggest and best opportunity that you can go pursue right now.
00:03:02.192 - 00:04:14.506, Speaker B: Absolutely. So I'll start with what we're doing, and then I'll explain why I think it's so exciting. So, to clarify a little bit, what we are is we are an investment management business, um, that we've created, and we're in the business of advising mutual funds. Um, a few days ago, last week, there was a registration filed with the SEC. It's a preliminary registration statement for a fund called the super state short term government, um, bond fund. And this fund is, in a lot of ways very similar to most mutual funds out there in that it has a very simple investment mandate, and it will purchase a number of securities, and it's planning to be a registered and investable mutual fund. What's different about it from other mutual funds is that, as filed in the preliminary prospectus, there will be a component where shareholders of the fund can request to have a record of their ownership sent to a blockchain address that they control either self custody or at a qualified custodian that they might be working with.
00:04:14.506 - 00:05:27.474, Speaker B: The advantage of this is that it gives an extra layer of transparency to shareholders in a format that they're already used to. So if you're a crypto venture fund or a crypto hedge fund, you might not want to create parallel infrastructure between crypto investments and tradfi investments. And you might want to just keep everything at the same crypto custodian as an investor. This would give you a tool to be an investor in a very specific mutual fund, but also see it alongside your other investments at a custodian, or be able to track it in a single portfolio management approach, and just be able to have a unified technical architecture for how you sort of store, manage and monitor your investments. And so this is a distinct advantage. It's not a massive advantage, but we think that it's really the first step on the tokenization or digitization, whatever you want to call it, for what many people call real world assets. I just call them traditional assets in a lot of ways.
00:05:27.474 - 00:06:12.178, Speaker B: But bringing a traditional asset or traditional investment on chain and some capacity, and this is chapter one of as a whole society and a whole industry. This shift of bringing assets on chain, and the advantages long term of having assets on chain are numerous. There's a composability with other on chain systems. There's a massive increase in transparency, in automation, in the speed and permanence of settlement. All of the reasons that people love DeFi are eventually going to exist for traditional assets. Traditional assets like mutual funds, stocks, bonds, currencies. That is the end state.
00:06:12.178 - 00:06:38.310, Speaker B: And what we're doing is we're doing our piece, a very specific, narrow piece to usher in this future. When I look at why are we doing this? When I got into crypto in 2017, at the time, I was like, oh, real world assets and tokenization of things is just around the corner. I said to everyone who would listen.
00:06:38.342 - 00:06:42.038, Speaker A: To me, security token, summer of 2018.
00:06:42.206 - 00:07:42.124, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. Of 2018. I was like, oh, man, we're just one step away from all of the bonds and all of the equities and all of the currencies and commodities and real estate being tokens on a blockchain one day, six years later, weve seen very little demonstrable traction improve of assets coming from traditional markets onto the blockchain. And I view this as one of the single largest opportunities for the blockchain ecosystem as a whole, for investors, for developers, for builders, is to just assist in the process of bringing assets on chain in whatever way is feasible and possible. And thats the why I just view this as a massive migration that I thought would have happened by now. I thought if you asked me in 2017, how long is this going to take, I would have said five years. Everythings going to be on chain.
00:07:42.124 - 00:08:07.482, Speaker B: A protocol like compound or uniswap or makerdao or whatever is going to be able to interact with commercial real estate. But none of this has occurred yet. That's the why I just see this massive migration that really hasn't started, that's been lagging for the builders and developers in the crypto ecosystem. I thought other people would have made more progress by now and more traction by now.
00:08:07.558 - 00:08:27.546, Speaker A: Well, why do you think that hasn't happened? Because actually there are a lot of folks who have tried to take this on. Right. Do you remember harbor? There's like, Josh and Harbor, and I think Bitco might have acquired them back in the day. There's obviously folks like securitize. Like, there have been people who have been working on this and kind of attacking it from different angles. Like a lot of folks trying to tokenize real estate. That obviously hasn't, hasn't worked out so well.
00:08:27.546 - 00:08:33.534, Speaker A: Like, why do you think the kind of securitization platforms of the last five years haven't worked out that well?
00:08:34.094 - 00:09:18.734, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a great question. I think a couple of reasons. One is it's been relatively early in the growth of demand. It's a chicken and an egg problem, but there has to be demand from end users to have things brought on chain or a giant economic invisible hand that's pushing them on chain or pulling them on chain. There has to be some massive driving force that wants it really badly. And that's, I think, the most important piece. And I think the invisible hand of wanting securitization and tokenization over the past few years has not been that strong in comparison to assets that are issued native to crypto.
00:09:18.734 - 00:10:18.528, Speaker B: So assets that only exist on a blockchain. So I look at the world very simply as a black and white thing of like, is the asset originally created on a blockchain, and is that the only place where it lives, or does the asset exist in the traditional financial market and it needs to be brought onto a blockchain. All the most popular crypto assets for traders in crypto, for hedge funds, for venture funds, for whatever crypto native assets. It's the assets associated with a layer one blockchain, the assets issued on top of a layer one blockchain, and all of these things. And it's just so much easier and closer for these crypto native assets. And so, you know, there's been enough of a market for crypto native assets that's been where all the excitement is that you haven't really seen, you know, a huge amount of demand for, like, okay, we need to get, you know, stocks onto the blockchain, or we need to get real estate onto the blockchain. There's a huge amount of interest, you know, in crypto native assets.
00:10:18.528 - 00:10:59.560, Speaker B: Like you look at anyone, you ask them what they're excited about. Theyre excited about crypto because its different than real estate or equities, which they already have access to. They like the thing they dont yet have access to. Thats new. But I think over time, that pull or that gravity is going to increase, especially as the amount of things you can do on chain increase. When I look at this, I think the invisible hand is biggest right now and probably for the next few years with short term interest rates. I think the biggest hole is going to be people who are on chain, who are native to blockchain, saying, well, we really want the yield from treadfy.
00:10:59.560 - 00:11:22.500, Speaker B: I mean, t bills are 5% plus. Who doesn't want that? It's one of the greatest assets of all time. It's an incredibly safe short term investment. And so everybody wants that. And it doesn't really, really exist on chain right now. There's a lot of teams out there that are developing solutions. We're not alone at.
00:11:22.500 - 00:12:15.092, Speaker B: We're not going to stay alone. There's going to be 100 phenomenal teams that are all trying to facilitate what I think the invisible hand wants, which is, how do you get this great investment from the traditional market and bring it on chain, where I can use it in interesting ways, but thats where I see the invisible hand being strongest, is around rates, mostly because the interest rate differential between tradfi and Defi right now favors tradfi coming on chain. Rates that are scalable into the trillions right now are like 5%. Zone rates in DeFi across the board are not. Theyre like two, three, maybe at best, 4%. It's the time for there to be a giant magnet pulling assets from off chain, on chain. The opposite existed three years ago, where rates in DeFi were like 8%.
00:12:15.148 - 00:12:16.676, Speaker A: The inverse of Defi summer. Yeah, exactly.
00:12:16.700 - 00:12:18.828, Speaker B: It's the inverse of Defi summer zero.
00:12:18.916 - 00:12:29.516, Speaker A: Yeah. It does feel like there's this huge market space right now to smooth out the proverbial interest rate gap between web two and web3, or traditional capital markets and Defi.
00:12:29.660 - 00:12:30.284, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:12:30.364 - 00:13:08.674, Speaker A: Before we get there, because that's actually really interesting. Before we get there, I interned at. Oh, my God, what was the name of this mutual capital group? American funds, which I guess is one of the biggest mutual funds out there, competitor to the vanguards and fidelities of the world. There are two angles I feel like you could have taken here. One is basically trying to recreate Vanguard's business, or maybe Franklin Templeton's business and do it more on chain. Another angle that you could have gone here is to build a platform to help the VanGuards and fidelities and FraNklin TempletOns of the world. Come on, chain.
00:13:08.674 - 00:13:11.974, Speaker A: Which direction did you go and why?
00:13:12.134 - 00:14:20.234, Speaker B: Yeah, that's actually a really interesting question. So there's definitely technology companies that are trying to enable investment managers to come on chain. We're in bucket one, or the first approach that you described, which is we're creating an investment management business that will be technologically savvy. I have a lot of experience in on chain markets, but that's an investment management business first. So it actually looks a lot more like a Vanguard that's going to make more high tech financial products, not a technology company trying to level up. Vanguard BlackRock, I view, Superstate the business that we recently launched as something that eventually, over time, will slowly compete with Vanguard BlackRock and investment management businesses with a tech focus to create just huge amounts of funds that people prefer because theyre slightly more functional and higher tech and more transparent and better. You know, all of these advantages.
00:14:20.394 - 00:14:47.294, Speaker A: Huh. It's interesting. I never really thought about, like, that business as being a business as being, like, a business to go into. But I guess if you think about it, a lot of these are kind of like legacy family run businesses. Like, I think capital Group is still private, started a long time ago, still private run. Like family owned business, I think is Fidelity is the Johnson family, right? He's been running it for a long time. Franklin Templeton.
00:14:47.294 - 00:14:53.274, Speaker A: I'm pretty sure family run business. I'd never really thought about going after these businesses, but that's interesting.
00:14:53.814 - 00:14:56.358, Speaker B: Yeah. There's not many people trying to.
00:14:56.446 - 00:15:03.274, Speaker A: It's the less sexy thing, because you could have raised a bunch of money for a tech platform at a really high multiple, even in this market, I'm sure.
00:15:03.974 - 00:15:06.350, Speaker B: Yeah, I think boring is sometimes good.
00:15:06.502 - 00:15:07.194, Speaker A: Boring.
00:15:07.734 - 00:15:09.790, Speaker B: We're basically trying to fill the shoes.
00:15:09.902 - 00:15:41.454, Speaker A: Someone who did not start a Defi protocol and had some fomo in the Defi summer, I bought boring. Boring ended up being pretty good. Tell me more about, like, the types of assets that you, that you envision tokenizing. Because I think, like, when people talk, by the way, I like that you called them traditional assets, not real world assets. Cause I think real world kind of implies that, I mean, things digitally is not the real world, but obviously that's not true. So I like this word, traditional assets. Tell me what you are starting with, and then maybe like, how you expand to other traditional assets and, like, which ones you kind of take on first.
00:15:41.604 - 00:16:24.914, Speaker B: Yeah, for me its relatively obvious, which is I think the biggest pull and the biggest demand is going to be around a safe short term interest rate. Theres trillions of dollars that are looking for short term yield that arent trying to chase risk or duration. A short term government bond fund is the lowest fruit. Its the juiciest apple thats closest on the tree and its the most obvious candidate. Um, mostly because I think the market for it is massive. I think there's you know, potentially trillions of dollars of, you know, incremental interest in short term government debt. And so that one's obvious down the road.
00:16:24.914 - 00:17:06.992, Speaker B: You know, we're going to explore a diff additional asset classes but not until we've proven out what works, what doesn't work, and iterated with a single asset because I think it's like the most important asset, it's the most obvious and its too early to be like, all right, well if a short term government bond fund works, what about an equity index fund or a commodities fund or a real estate fund or a currency fund? You can create a fund for any asset, any strategy. I mean theres a trillion different funds you could create but were just going to start with the most obvious before spending the time and focus and bandwidth on, you know, what else is potential.
00:17:07.168 - 00:17:36.872, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I guess there's, I remember actually pomp always saying his like the pomp ism back in like 2018 or 2019 was like tokenize the world. And he was like, I remember him always saying like, you know, stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities, it'll all be tokenized. What, uh, what in terms of like difficulty? I'm maybe on more of like a micro scale. I'm actually very curious like how this kind of works, like what you have to build to maybe tokenize something like equities or commodities. How does that actually work?
00:17:37.008 - 00:18:12.002, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a great question. Fundamentally, it's actually not very different from having a bond fund where the shares can exist in a digital record on chain. If you can have a fund and the shares exist on chain as a digital record, it doesn't really matter what's in the fund. It could be bonds and cash, it could be stocks, theoretically it could be real estate, it could be anything. It's really not incrementally different. I think the most important thing, and I'll keep going back to this phrase, just what does the invisible hand want?
00:18:12.138 - 00:18:13.294, Speaker A: The interest rates?
00:18:14.914 - 00:18:27.194, Speaker B: I think that's what's fundamentally different. I don't know how many people really care about having stocks on chain right now, because they can get stocks off chain, and they may as well.
00:18:27.614 - 00:18:43.074, Speaker A: Hmm. What does this, what's kind of like the second order impact of having, um, traditional yield, like, you know, five, 6% yield or whatever in Defi? What, what does that do for Defi? And what does that do for crypto?
00:18:43.694 - 00:19:46.402, Speaker B: Yeah, it's really interesting thought experiment. I mean, if you have, like, a huge amount of yield opportunity, you know, coming from traditional assets, but on chain, and the switching costs are low, I think eventually what that does is just crowds out defi up to that interest rate. If its incredibly easy to get t bills on chain and theyre 5%, I dont think people are going to be comfortable with an on chain return less than that. The equivalent risk free rate in Defi will go up, and the available interest rates in Defi will go up beyond that. It's just that right now, there's so much friction between off chain markets and on chain markets. There's back and forth costs, there's switching costs, there's opportunity costs. If you actually have at scale and without too much friction, the risk free rate on chain, everything else is going to have to match it in its equilibrium.
00:19:46.402 - 00:20:09.874, Speaker B: No one's going to take incremental risk there when they're like, oh, well, I can instantly get 5%, and I know it's just t bills. That's awesome. How could any protocol or any system offer less than that? The only reason they can right now is because there isn't some scalable on chain access to a low risk liquid investment.
00:20:10.534 - 00:20:45.300, Speaker A: Okay, so then I've been thinking about, like, the. I've been reading about Libor recently, trying to understand Libor, and just think about, like, what the risk free rate in DeFi will look like in a couple of years. On one hand, you could think of it as, like, almost the yield that staking spits off could be the risk free rate. But on, on the, on, like, on the other side, you could think of it as, like, the, you know, the tre. Like, ten year treasuries, right. Are about as risk free as you can get. So, like, how do you think about the yield that you get from something like ten year treasury being tokenized versus the yield that you get from staking?
00:20:45.452 - 00:21:33.904, Speaker B: Yeah, it's really interesting. Okay, so, you know, for a given currency, there's going to be some essentially risk free rate. Okay, the word currency and commodity are kind of squishy, but, like, you know, for ether, there's a risk free rate. But ether is different than dollars. Dollars have their own equivalent risk free rate for ether it's staking and that might be 5% but the exchange rate between ether and dollars might be incredibly volatile. There might be a risk free rate for euros which matches the ECB rates on chain, but ether is its own currency or base level asset. 5% at ether is not comparable to 5% on dollars.
00:21:33.904 - 00:22:25.790, Speaker B: Because dollars are flat they dont really do anything. Theyre sort of like a straight line whereas ether goes up and down in dollar terms 3% a day. But if youre completely like I am an ether maximalist and I only think in terms of ether, ethers risk free rate is all that matters to you. And a rate on dollars is the risky one because that ones going up and down in ether terms all day. Its subjective. In the same way that like the interest rates on any currency are subjective to the people, you know, exposed to the local currency versus being a foreign currency. And you know there's preferences but you know there's not one risk free rate, there's a risk free rate per currency and for each one it's going to come from staking yield and for dollars it's going to come from t bills as all of these things reach scale and parity.
00:22:25.942 - 00:23:01.766, Speaker A: Huh. That's really interesting. Did your, I imagine some of your like, how do your learnings from compound apply to what you're building right now? Because like the radon compound varies widely, right? Which leads to like interest rate volatility and which comes from like just kind of full free market, full decentralized free market. And I'm just, which has some, which has some problems, right. It limits some things that can happen. And you know, we don't have a fully baked out, like interest rate swaps market in defi yet and people are working on that. But how does your learnings from compound specifically applied to interest rates apply to this?
00:23:01.910 - 00:24:01.570, Speaker B: Yeah it's a great question. So the first lesson that I learned probably around like 2018, 2019, after the first version or two of compound was released, was that for the most part, almost all of the demand to borrow was in stable coins. When I originally envisioned compound and wrote the first white paper in 2017, I was like, oh, people are going to want to borrow every crypto native asset that exists. People want to borrow ether and people want to borrow chain link tokens. And the reality is that people really just want to borrow stable coins or a stable asset because they prefer that their debt isn't uncertain, they don't like it going up and down wildly. They want to borrow something where they know exactly how much they're going to owe. Borrowing and stablecoins has been the overwhelming preference for a lot of users that I've been able to observe.
00:24:01.570 - 00:25:19.362, Speaker B: And that was the first major lesson. And that actually informed a lot of the decisions that went into the design of compound version three, which was, what if we just remove half of protocol and you can only borrow a stablecoin? And what happens if you just rip out half the code? And it led to a real reinvention of just thinking about what do people want? Whether it's a crypto hedge fund or high net worth speculator, what do they actually want? And can you rip out all the things that they don't want from an interest rate perspective? One of the things that surprised me is that fixed rate instruments haven't taken off in defi yet. I was expecting from the earliest days that fixed rate markets would have taken off. As an investor at robot ventures, invested in ten different protocols that do fixed rates. We still haven't really seen any markets or any products that do fixed rates really scale in crypto yet. There have been a lot of incredible experiments. I'm really excited about a lot of teams working on this.
00:25:19.362 - 00:26:08.144, Speaker B: But to your point, the rates that actually are there, like compound aave curve, whatever, these are rates to change block by block. These are not terms rates, really, for any structure. It doesn't allow users to take a lot of rate predictability. And so this has been a surprise to me, and thats a lesson, is that this is a surprise that it hasnt developed and hasnt grown at all. And so I think it lends more credence to the idea that things will just exist in their most scalable equilibrium format, and there hasnt yet been a large amount of demand for a fixed rate on the borrowing side or interest earnings side.
00:26:11.044 - 00:27:02.478, Speaker A: Robert, I think it kind of just clicked to me that the opportunity here is not with actually individuals, but it's with companies, right, because people are flexible when they get their mortgage right. Some people want fixed rates, some people want variable, whatever, different pricing, et cetera. But if you were a company taking out a loan, if you got a variable loan, that could crush your business there. Companies don't basically borrow on chain right now because of the. I think one of the many reasons is because of the unpredictability of the interest rates, which can completely crush a business. But actually thinking about it with treasuries, blockworks right now is looking into, you get 5% if you just put it in ten year right now. So what do we do with some of the money in the bank account? And it feels like the huge opportunity right now, which is the trillion dollar opportunity, is actually with, with treasuries.
00:27:02.478 - 00:27:09.702, Speaker A: And I'm curious to hear just how you think about like treasuries being the opportunity, yay or nay?
00:27:09.878 - 00:27:19.238, Speaker B: I think yay. I mean, clearly I'm making the bet on Yay, you know what I'm spending my time on. Right. And I think to go back to our earlier moment in the conversation, but.
00:27:19.246 - 00:27:29.618, Speaker A: I guess, like, is that the end customer? Like is the end customer here? When you think about your customer for the business, is it a company tokenize or allocating some of their treasuries to.
00:27:29.626 - 00:28:29.312, Speaker B: Get this yield in 50 years, potentially in 20 years, in ten years? Right. I think most companies, if theyre looking for a stable investment and theyre not already crypto native themselves, they can go out and buy a ten year or five year treasury bill or note. Today, they just go out and buy treasuries. They dont need any product existing crypto. The question is, do they want to do that on chain or not? And the answer is on chain. Increasingly over time, the answer is going to be yes, because more and more businesses and more and more institutions and more and more users and investors, et cetera, will be capable of interacting with blockchains and accessing blockchain based markets, services. And so as people come on chain, they're going to want that 5% note on chain.
00:28:29.312 - 00:28:52.524, Speaker B: They're not going to want it through a traditional web two or web one stack. They're going to want it a web3 stack. But today it's just about the investment return and the liquidity profile and all of this. They don't have to buy an asset on chain. They can buy an asset. There's a million ways that you can go out and get those treasuries right now.
00:28:54.064 - 00:29:25.466, Speaker A: All right, quick break from the show. There is this kind of overused cliche saying in crypto, but it's true. Bear markets are building and everyone tells you that never knows it. What people don't know is that if you're building apps in crypto and building apps in web3 without using quick node, you are building on hard mode. So Quicknode is this amazing blockchain development platform. It reduces costs, streamlines the time to market for your app, and it offers consistent performance at scale. For folks that have built apps, you will know that there are a couple key points here.
00:29:25.466 - 00:30:15.746, Speaker A: One Quicknode offers unlimited endpoints across 18 different chains and 35 different networks, they have response times that are two and a half times faster than any of their competitors, 99.99% uptime and a dedicated 24/7 customer support team. If you've been listening to Empire for a while, you might know that I am no gigabrain developer, but I do know a lot of devs and a lot of great product teams at other places. So when I see Coinbase and Twitter and Adobe and OpenSea and doing analytics, all leveraging and trusting Quicknode to power their business, that's when we get excited and that's when we want to partner with them. They're the best solution for any leading crypto and web3 company that is seeking an end to end blockchain development platform right out of the box. So my message to you, get off hard mode. Let Quicknode handle the blockchain infrastructure.
00:30:15.746 - 00:30:38.624, Speaker A: Let Quicknode handle the security. Let Quicknode handle the performance while you focus on building beautiful products for your users, visit quicknode.com comma super easy. You can use code empire. You'll get a free month on their build plan, so forget to use code Empire. Santi and I got to get credit for this one so they know that we sent you and you will get a first month free. Hope you guys enjoy it.
00:30:38.624 - 00:31:32.636, Speaker A: Let's face it, concentrated liquidity is hard and that's why I'm super excited to partner with Carbon for Empire. Carbon is a new Dex on Ethereum that makes concentrated liquidity easy. With carbon, LP's can now automate your liquidity strategy with custom on chain limit mid orders and range orders. Want to buy a token when it dips and sell it when it spikes? With carbon, you can now set a strategy that buys in on one price range and sells in a higher range on repeat. Using a single source of automated rotating liquidity strategies can be created for any standard ERC 20 token. I recently checked out the carbon beta that just dropped pretty blown away by the liquidity strategies that carbon enables on chain. It has these rich trading features that you'd expect from a centralized exchange, except carbon is fully on chain, decentralized and non custodial.
00:31:32.636 - 00:31:56.280, Speaker A: Just connect your wallet. It's carbon defi XYZ. That's carbon defi XYZ. Choose a trading pair, set your buy and sell ranges and amounts. Hit create and you're done. Carbon automatically moves your liquidity into your selected ranges as the market moves. Last but not least, I am excited to announce that Carbon is running a ROI trading competition until July 11.
00:31:56.280 - 00:32:14.274, Speaker A: Here's how to play super easy. Two steps. One, click the carbon link in the show notes. Two, create a new carbon trading strategy and voila. You are now eligible to win USDC rewards based on the performance of your strategies. LP's it is time to take back control of your liquidity with carbon. Check out the link and get started today.
00:32:14.274 - 00:32:34.134, Speaker A: Now let's get back to empire pivoting a little bit. I'm actually curious on the fundraise, I noticed that you guys only raised from. I think it was six or five or six folks. I think it was paraphy one KX Cumberland coin fund and distributed. I'm pretty sure it was. Yep. Those five basically.
00:32:34.134 - 00:32:45.094, Speaker A: Like what I mean, you were also run your own fund at robot. Like, why not? There's a different strategy here, which is you go get every crypto fund. I'm sure they all would allocated you go raise. How much did you raise?
00:32:45.134 - 00:32:46.718, Speaker B: Four, 4 million? Yeah.
00:32:46.806 - 00:32:49.766, Speaker A: You could have raised probably, you could have ten x that. I bet you could have raised 40 million.
00:32:49.830 - 00:32:51.366, Speaker B: I probably could have, right?
00:32:51.390 - 00:32:58.742, Speaker A: You could have raised 40 million. You could have got like 50 of the best crypto funds. You probably could have gotten some traditional funds on board. Why didn't you do that?
00:32:58.918 - 00:33:52.010, Speaker B: Well, I think, you know, it's a really interesting question. I mean, we really wanted to optimize for getting firms that we already knew and who we think would be ideal users and customers and participants. Over time. I think at some point we will go out and talk to all of the rest of the crypto funds and do something larger. But early on, we just wanted to optimize for making sure that we had exactly as much capital that was needed to get this off the ground. And we really just optimized for something simple and straightforward where we didn't have to have a lot of conversations. You know, it's likely that maybe we will go out in a year or whenever and try to build a really close relationship with a lot larger of an audience, but it's just something we didn't do at this.
00:33:52.010 - 00:33:52.898, Speaker B: Appreciate.
00:33:53.066 - 00:34:05.188, Speaker A: Nice. Cool. If Franklin Templeton or Vanguard or fidelity wanted to put in a big chunk, would you let them? Or is that a competitor now on your cap table?
00:34:05.386 - 00:34:48.784, Speaker B: Yeah, that's an interesting question. I mean, I haven't thought about it over time. I think the lines of what's competitive and what's cooperative evolve considerably. One of the things I've seen not just from crypto, but many different industries, is that things that look like competitors are eventually collaborators and cooperative and things that look cooperative are eventually competitive. I actually think its generally okay to take strategic investments as long as theres no separate terms. One of the things ive seen actually harm a lot of companies are when strategic investments come with incredibly restrictive covenants or side letters. And Im saying this as an investor and as a founder with lots of friends who are founders.
00:34:48.784 - 00:35:50.656, Speaker B: If its just capital, then its actually great to have, whether its cooperative or competitive, the industry on your cap table. But the problems really arise when it's coming with all these extra terms. Terms like, oh, we get a first look at any m and a activity, or we have a rate of first refusal on m and A, or we need additional management rights or information rights versus all of your other investors, or, oh, we need to be able to see your products before they launch. All of these things that are not purely capital based can only harm a company and make it less successful. And so my advice to any founder out there is, if theres a strategic investment from someone in the industry, its actually probably a benefit to both firms. If its just capital based. But if it comes with lots of weird clauses that limit your own business, its going to be a negative, which.
00:35:50.680 - 00:35:53.536, Speaker A: If it comes from a corporate vc, it usually does, Jeff.
00:35:53.560 - 00:36:15.128, Speaker B: Usually does. If you can do it without the complexity, you should. And so I would say if down the road we were able to take investment from someone like Blackrock or a vanguard or a fidelity, and it didn't come with restrictive behaviors, then it's beneficial to both firms.
00:36:15.216 - 00:36:51.710, Speaker A: Yeah. All right. Going back to what you're building for a second, just kind of, I have one more question that came up on the interest rate stuff, the yield curve. So the yield curve in economics is central to the transmission of monetary policy. And we don't really have a yield curve in DeFi, I'm assuming what happens is you push into treasuries and then Munis and then investment grade stuff and then maybe high yield stuff, and this, combined with interest rate swaps creates this yield curve. Is that the vision here? And maybe. Tell me about your vision and how it relates to, to kind of building this defi native yield curve.
00:36:51.902 - 00:37:16.652, Speaker B: Yeah. So, you know, my vision really starts with just like doing what I think is, like, truly the biggest opportunity, which is short term government debt, because short term government debt, there's so much demand for it. And fundamentally, it's an incredibly healthy product. Right. The investors in a short term government fund are not going to lose money. Like, unless there's like some, like one in, you know, you know, black swan black swan situation.
00:37:16.828 - 00:37:18.772, Speaker A: Ask the bitcoin maxis. They might disagree with you.
00:37:18.788 - 00:37:58.858, Speaker B: Robert okay, that's true to the bitcoin Maxis out there. We can debate this on Twitter, but it's an incredibly healthy product and in general, you're not going to lose out really against inflation. And it's long term a great product and it's the perfect product to sit at the base of the product cycle and the yield curve. As you talk about all these other things, it's just investment decisions on what you want instead of the risk free rate. And there is risk in all of them and theres a market for all of them. In fact, theres a huge market for every single one of them, massive. But theyre not as simple.
00:37:58.858 - 00:38:07.534, Speaker B: Its very simple to think about short term government debt because short term government debt is just one of the healthiest possible products and it never hurts to put people into it.
00:38:09.214 - 00:38:23.154, Speaker A: What about the regulatory side of all this? I think I read that you guys are going to have to whitelist anyone who holds it. That's almost like a moral trade off, maybe potentially. How did you think about this?
00:38:23.614 - 00:39:32.650, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a really fascinating set of trade offs, I'm sure. Ways to make products like stablecoins like USDC and tether, where they're not whitelisted or permission in any way. Anyone can hold tether and there's no checks, there's no KYC, AML, OFaC, there's none of this stuff. There's ways to make those products. And I think there's a lot of people that are going to benefit by making those products. I see a world in which, you know, ten years from now, what does defi look like? Its an amalgamation of assets that are permissionless and permissioned and that they coexist in the same protocols, in the same markets and the same entities. You could have a protocol where aave or compound where you have assets that a billion people can access and 8 billion people can access, and its just like theyre under the same roof, but you have ways of sectioning off certain assets.
00:39:32.650 - 00:40:14.648, Speaker B: The reality is were taking a path which by filing a prospectus and creating a product, it means its going to be available to us investors and investors with us addresses, which is awesome. But it also means that you have to verify in some fashion that someone is a us investor. This is necessary for so many different reasons. It's for AML, it's for tax, it's for compliance, it's for just market integrity. You do have to know who the shareholders of a registered mutual funder. And that's not a bad thing. There's a huge number of people that can hold that asset.
00:40:14.648 - 00:40:50.958, Speaker B: There's a huge number of people that can hold that asset. It's possible over time. There's products that are only for offshore investors, and then you have a product that's for us investors and you have a product that's for non us investors. And they both exist. These are just the choices that get made. And from where I sit, I think it's actually really exciting to go down the path of building a product that us investors can purchase that has been registered in the US. It's not easy, but I definitely think it's something that, you know, opens it up to a really cool market.
00:40:50.958 - 00:41:25.184, Speaker B: And, you know, we're going to be able to have a system where, you know, yes, people will have to onboard in order to hold it, but there's going to be a lot of reasons to onboard. And that you're going to be able to have something that at the end of the day will eventually be, you know, a really healthy investment that you can hold on chain that is useful and you're incentivized to have it over. Let's say a stable coin that just gives you 0% and burns a hole in your wallet until you say, hey, how do I exit this thing?
00:41:25.764 - 00:41:50.564, Speaker A: I think one of the last things I'm curious about here, Robert, is on the stable coin front. I'm curious how you. I think I saw somewhere that you were either saying that this will compete with stable coins, or maybe I saw someone else posting about that. But how do you think about stablecoin competition? And maybe the better question is like five years from now, super state versus USDC, like competitors, enemies, frenemies, what does that look like?
00:41:50.944 - 00:42:42.564, Speaker B: Yeah, it's interesting to think about, because I think that between products, over time, stable coins and investments are going to run into each other for users, for capital, for use cases in general. I think the reason why stable coins are so dominant right now is because there's very few alternatives on chain. Stable coins are a really positive product. I mean, they are the first product besides crypto native assets like bitcoin and ether that have like absolute product market fit. It's why we've seen stable coins go from $0 to 130 billion plus dollars in a short amount of time. Stable coins are crazy useful because they settle instantly. They're super portable, they're programmable, and you're able to self custody them.
00:42:42.564 - 00:43:09.832, Speaker B: And so as an asset, that asset is just better than cash in so many ways. And so there's huge amounts of product market fit there. But the environment behind stable coins is getting worse and worse. So when rates were zero, stable coins were the greatest thing imaginable. When rates are 5%, stablecoins are not a healthy product. They burn a hole in the wallet of anyone holding them. They burn a hole in any corporate treasury.
00:43:09.832 - 00:43:47.740, Speaker B: They burn a hole on any balance sheet that theyre held. Because right now, the sponsors of stablecoins are earning 5% plus, keeping 5% plus, and giving the holders of the stablecoin zero. And this was fine when rates were half a percent. Who cares? But when rates are 5%, the sponsors are getting incredibly wealthy at the expense of the holders. And that's going to change. And the reason why that's tolerable right now is because there's very few alternatives. It's very hard to convert the stable coins back into dollars and then go out and do something with them.
00:43:47.740 - 00:44:42.772, Speaker B: That's why stable coin balances have stayed shockingly high, even as rates have gone up. But when theres alternatives that are easily accessible to crypto native investors, then I think theres going to be a war between traditional investments and stable coins. And right now that war is incredibly lopsided. Theres almost no traditional investments available to crypto native investors. Its slim pickets. But when theyre readily available, I think thats going to be one of the primary battlegrounds is looking for where does capital choose between a stable coin and an investment product that they can use on chain? And when they both exist, I think there's going to be a competition between the two. The other competition that's going to exist, for better or for worse, between stable coins and investment products is that stable coins still are on a no KYC AML bearer model.
00:44:42.772 - 00:45:16.324, Speaker B: Anyone can hold them, whereas investment products are going to have a narrower, yeah. Ownership base. And so I wouldn't be surprised if in like ten years there's $400 billion of stable coins and like $200 billion of on chain investment products. Like that wouldn't surprise me either if like they both continue to grow. And it's just like, hey, if you're not within this, you know, you know, known perimeter, the returns suck. And if you're within this known perimeter, the returns are what they are supposed to be. That wouldn't surprise me either.
00:45:16.444 - 00:45:24.660, Speaker A: Yeah. And will you be able. So there's gonna be a, you know, a token like, what's the token like, you know, SSTF or what's it gonna be called?
00:45:24.772 - 00:45:25.524, Speaker B: Oh, I don't know yet.
00:45:25.564 - 00:45:34.164, Speaker A: You don't know? Okay, well, I'll make it up. So. All right, so the superstate token, will you be able to put that. Will you be able to trade it in things like uniswap?
00:45:34.204 - 00:45:35.924, Speaker B: Not at launch. No, no, not at launch.
00:45:36.004 - 00:45:39.532, Speaker A: But eventually you want to basically create these, like, white, labeled pools, I'm assuming.
00:45:39.588 - 00:46:14.030, Speaker B: Inside of the compounds, and Uniswap, well, it's a really hard problem because for a fund, a fund has to actually know who all the shareholders are. And when assets go into a pool like Uniswap, you start to lose context on who the actual owners are. Right. If there's ten Lp's in a Uniswap pool, right. It's hard for the fund itself to even know how many shares each person has. Right. Especially, like, look at, you just want b.
00:46:14.030 - 00:47:17.304, Speaker B: Three people have different liquidity ranges. Like, when the price has moved $1, how much do each of the underlying LP's even have anymore? It's an incredibly hard problem, and the reason it's necessary to understand this, besides the first piece of, okay, can we make sure that North Korea isn't one of the holders of it? That part's honestly quite easy, to make sure North Korea is not a holder. The harder part is just saying, hey, we have to issue ten, ninety nine s and essentially, P and L. You really have to know when each shareholder has acquired and disposed of an asset. And if you can't do that, then it's just mechanically impossible to operate. I think what's going to happen is, over time, the development cycle is actually going to go in a different circle. You're going to get investment products, and then DeFi platforms are going to have to reinvent themselves to accommodate them.
00:47:17.304 - 00:47:58.124, Speaker B: It might require small changes to protocols, it might require medium changes to protocols, but I actually think the opposite happens. It's not like, hey, we're doing this asset, it's going to go in uniswap, and we're going to figure out how to make it work. It's going to be, here's how. We have a compliant product that's able to handle taxes correctly, and it's able to handle KYC, AML, OFAC correctly, and all of these things. And then what does a protocol need to do to actually make those assets able to be used in the protocol? Because right now, frankly, interesting, I don't think Uniswap V three actually would work with, you know, a fund.
00:47:59.424 - 00:48:33.638, Speaker A: I have a product idea on this fund. Tell me if it, uh. Tell me why this is a bad idea. One. Um, what if you could create like a, basically a KYC AML protocol? And once you go through the, once you go through KYC AML, you just get a, um, what are the non tradable soul bound token or whatever you want to call it, a non tradable NFT that just sits in your wallet. And then when I go on uniswap, it also sees that I have this soul bound token that's like the KYC token, and only for people who have that, they can trade the super state funds. Good idea, bad idea.
00:48:33.766 - 00:49:23.298, Speaker B: Yeah, so it's actually really interesting. The idea of having like a global, sort of like, KYC system that like, many different issuers or protocols could hook into the approach that we're taking is that, you know, the fund admin and transfer agent and investment advisor, which is like us and service providers, that's who you're actually providing the information to. You're really providing it to the fund admin at the end of the day, which is going to be a very traditional Wall street entity. Um, you know, they're the only ones who are going to have the information of the shareholders. It's not going to like, live on a blockchain being like zero, x, one, two, three, f two is, you know, yano, you know, like, that's not gonna, like, live on the blockchain. Um, you know, Jason's information isn't gonna be on chain. It's gonna be with the fund admin.
00:49:23.298 - 00:50:08.846, Speaker B: And the fund admin is like, okay, well, like one, two, three, f, you know, fours, you know, Jason, you know, whatever. Um, yeah, the, the other sort of difficult piece with that product idea is, you know, you don't want to expose the information, but each of the people that are like, using the whitelist kind of have to know who it is. They can't just be like, oh, superstate signed off on their Kyc. Therefore, like, you know, people can, like, use our platform. It's like. Cause if like, a regulator goes to them and says, okay, well, who's user 123 FD? They'll be like, I don't know, like, go as super state. But it's not like our product, right? It's not like our thing that you're using.
00:50:08.846 - 00:50:44.994, Speaker B: So it just creates this information imbalance that makes it hard to have one global whitelist because it's like, where's the information even live? And so I think the best approach in the short term is just like, hey, you can onboard with this fund admin. The fund admin knows you and can say, one, two, three. FD is approved to be able to hold this asset, but no one knows on chain who one, two, three. FT is. Besides the fund admin, the information is not exposed. You can hold the asset. You can transfer it to another shareholder.
00:50:44.994 - 00:51:24.506, Speaker B: Hi five. Everything just works. Getting into systems where many different projects or products or systems share the same whitelisting system just starts to get really complex, and I think someone's going to do it. Honestly, in ten years, there's so many smart people out there, in ten years, someone's going to figure out how to have a zero knowledge proof based system where you can prove that you're not North Korea, and the whole thing just works, and it's interoperable, and every DeFi protocol can have it for investment assets and crypto native assets without a whitelisting. Just continue to work like that, and the whole thing just goes together and it's perfect and users love it. But that's like chef kissed.
00:51:24.530 - 00:51:25.098, Speaker A: Voila.
00:51:25.186 - 00:51:31.414, Speaker B: Just kissed. That's a mile away. If you see those projects, like, let me know. I'd love to.
00:51:31.574 - 00:51:38.934, Speaker A: I got you. Business model here is just fee model. Right? Like, it's fees. Yeah. 25 bps on. Okay.
00:51:39.054 - 00:51:52.134, Speaker B: Yeah. It's gonna be 33 bits on the fund that we filed a preliminary prospectus for. It'd be great if, like, over time, that comes down to be more competitive with vanguard and things like that. But it seems like a pretty competitive fee to start.
00:51:52.214 - 00:52:05.166, Speaker A: It's actually a beautifully simple business. I wish block works had just one rev. Like, one simple pricing. Like, that's. That's, that's a beautiful business, but, um. But it's also a tough business because it's a very small amount of money. Right.
00:52:05.166 - 00:52:19.878, Speaker A: Like, if you get a billion dollars, I think this mental math is. Right. A billion dollars on 33 bits, that's $3,300,000. So I guess you're just betting that, like, you will have 200 million. 200 billion, right.
00:52:19.926 - 00:52:27.552, Speaker B: Not, that's the goal. The goal is, over time, to be competitive with Blackrock. Right.
00:52:27.608 - 00:52:33.416, Speaker A: And to 100 billion on 33 bits. What is, what is that? That's 660 million. All right.
00:52:33.480 - 00:52:39.044, Speaker B: That's a nice billion per year is, like, cash flow. Yeah, that's a nice, that's a great business. Yeah.
00:52:40.064 - 00:52:45.056, Speaker A: Fair enough. Awesome, man. Anything we missed on superstate, I think.
00:52:45.080 - 00:52:46.464, Speaker B: We'Ve covered pretty much everything.
00:52:46.624 - 00:52:52.234, Speaker A: Cool. Decided to be back in the early stage, like, day one days.
00:52:52.894 - 00:53:22.992, Speaker B: I'm like a zero to one guy, and I'm also, like, a one to ten guy. I'm not like a ten to 100 guy or like 100 to 1000. Like, I actually really like the early stages a lot because it's like bringing something to life that hasn't existed before for me is like, really fun. And, like, beyond that, I love growing something. I love, like, taking it from, like, hey, there's usage. To like, hey, there's a lot of usage, but I think there's people who are better at like, hey, there's a lot of usage. How do we get it to crazy usage than me? And so I love the early stage.
00:53:22.992 - 00:53:46.074, Speaker B: It's what I love as an investor. It's what I love as a founder. Just like, what do you have to do to bring something new to the world that should exist that users want, that regulators want, that composable businesses and protocols want? It's, how do you just usher it into being? That's so fun. And that's what I'm really happy to be doing again.
00:53:46.194 - 00:53:58.570, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm excited for you, man. What, what did you find to be the toughest thing about running a company that had gone into what I'd call, like, that third stage? Like the, I don't know how many employees you guys had, but, like, it was definitely past the, you know, ten employees, like 30 or 50. I don't know how big it was.
00:53:58.602 - 00:54:06.466, Speaker B: But, yeah, well, it's, it's interesting. Cause, like, my focus for the last, like, couple years at compound was on a product called compound treasury, which you can start to see the parallels between.
00:54:06.570 - 00:54:12.444, Speaker A: Cause when I saw this, I was like, oh, he's been trying to do this. But it didn't. It was like square peg, round hole inside a compound.
00:54:12.514 - 00:54:25.048, Speaker B: So, yeah, square peg, round hole. So, like, my focus was on compound treasury, which was a product for institutions that the idea was like, you know, you could have a DeFi protocol and then you would have a layer on top of a DeFi protocol.
00:54:25.096 - 00:54:25.832, Speaker A: Right, right.
00:54:25.888 - 00:54:52.738, Speaker B: And the institutions could interact with this layer on top of DeFi protocol that was like, you know, had a regulatory framework and, like, they could get the benefits of DeFi without using it themselves. And it was a really cool idea. Like, be honest. I actually thought it would work. And we actually got 33 really cool institutional users and customers for the product. And it was starting to scale and growth was great. And then Cefi blew up.
00:54:52.738 - 00:56:07.752, Speaker B: I mean, three AC, Genesis, Celsius, FTX, all these blockfi, a bunch of other ones. It was like everybody who was in the business of like, give us your money, trust us, we'll make it work correctly and safely proved that that model was not going to work. And it was really frustrating because we spent two years or so building up a really cool product, and it was the first product in crypto with credit rating. We literally were, like, trying to model and allow others to even see the risks and see how it works and be incredibly transparent about building a product that people could get comfortable with. What are you doing and how does it work? And then when everybody blew up, just the idea of give us your money and we will give you more back, even if it was based on a Defi protocol under the hood, using a smart contract, they can't steal your money. Like, the whole concept of, like, give us your money, like, seemed ridiculous. And so, like, if you're gonna do it, you need, like, a really sort.
00:56:07.768 - 00:56:12.760, Speaker A: Of give us your money. Whether you're raising for a fund, a company, a product, not a great time.
00:56:12.872 - 00:57:26.984, Speaker B: Not a great time for, like, give us your money. And so, like, that's really, like, the kernel of the idea that's evolved into superstate, which is, hey, if you're gonna say, give us your money, you need a really well trod path and, like, a really clean structure for that. And in my mind, the cleanest structure possible is you have a registered investment product with auditors and service providers, and it's like, give your money to a mutual fund does not sound scary. Give your money to a mutual fund with cool on chain components that evolve is really actually quite sound. It's not give it to a business to do what they want with. And so I think it's the path that institutions, unfortunately, are going to have to go down. I think it's like, the only thing, like, tolerable to acquire the next billions of dollars of assets in the crypto ecosystem is, hey, here's an incredibly straightforward product that you can understand, that's regulated, that there's a lot of professional service providers built around, and that, you know, that the assets are being invested in something straight, simple, and transparent.
00:57:26.984 - 00:57:41.664, Speaker B: But it's also composable over time with the crypto ecosystem and why you're here in the first place. It's an evolution. It was really sad for combat, treasuring, not to work, but it's really exciting.
00:57:42.244 - 00:57:50.910, Speaker A: There's no tougher thing, I think, than shutting down something, whether it's a company or product or anything that you've been working super hard on for the last couple of years on.
00:57:50.910 - 00:57:58.864, Speaker B: I know it was, it was difficult, but I think, like, this new direction is really exciting. Compound labs has, you know, new management.
00:57:59.604 - 00:58:27.152, Speaker A: I want to commend you, by the way. I I actually, I don't know, Jason. I've been dming with Jason a little bit just on Twitter. I think he's going to come on the podcast. We'll have him on soon at some point. But I commend you for putting a product designer in charge of compound because if you. Of all of the things, the skills basically that are undervalued in crypto today, people value engineers, people value BD people, people value marketers.
00:58:27.152 - 00:58:40.720, Speaker A: Product design, I think, is the most undervalued skillset in all of crypto today. And it's something that we need a lot more product designers and a lot better product designers. So I thought it was awesome that you put a product designer in charge.
00:58:40.832 - 00:59:10.174, Speaker B: I completely agree. You know, Jason's, you know, not just a product designer, but just like a great product thinker. And, you know, I think user experience has so far to go in crypto generally that the more people you can empower who are just like, you know, really focused on the user, the better. And, you know, for the last couple of years, he was, you know, really, you know, leading pretty much all of the products at compound. And so, you know, having him there, I think, like, they're going to do really cool things.
00:59:10.714 - 00:59:13.334, Speaker A: Awesome. Robert, anything else, man?
00:59:14.074 - 00:59:15.186, Speaker B: I think that's it.
00:59:15.330 - 00:59:21.482, Speaker A: Cool. Always a pleasure, my friend. Hope you enjoy the rest of your day and best of luck to you in super state.
00:59:21.578 - 00:59:22.954, Speaker B: Yeah, thank you. Thanks for having me on the show.
