00:00:00.360 - 00:00:22.606, Speaker A: This episode is brought to you by Bitmex, the OG crypto exchange that is back and better than ever. You'll hear more about Bitmex later in the show. I was talking to a very large institution, actually, yesterday, talking to them about our new research product that we launched last week, and I was asking them where the market goes. They said, it depends on where Coinbase goes. I go, no, Coinbase depends. I go. Coinbase is dependent on where crypto goes.
00:00:22.606 - 00:00:50.674, Speaker A: He goes, no, no, no. You fundamentally misunderstand how these markets work now. Now that crypto is an institutional market, crypto is going to move wherever Coinbase moves. So he said crypto stays in a bear as long as Coinbase stock is down. All right, everyone, the long awaited post permissionless weekly roundup. We're coming at you. Santiago is here with us.
00:00:50.674 - 00:01:06.830, Speaker A: He has a little background noise. He is in Monaco. Santiago, I know you hate it when I tell people you your location, but I have to do it for this one because you've got all this background noise and it's the f one cars racing in the background. So excuse the noise. Welcome to the show.
00:01:06.862 - 00:01:53.400, Speaker B: It's a little bit like, it's like a fly here, but, yeah, nonetheless, which is interesting, right? Because a lot of these cars, speaking of Formula One, a lot of cars are sponsored by, like, FTX, binance, tezos, like, pretty much every major team from Mercedes to McLaren and a bunch of other teams are sponsored by crypto. And so even, like, the race itself is, like, crypto.com. Like, if you see any of the races and, like, so many people, I can't tell you just come up to me like, oh, so that's crypto. I'm like, yeah, like, yes, like last couple years. Like, because some of the sponsorships, like, when you see the driver in the little, like, protective kind of frame, there's like, FDX or binance or tazos. And then crypto.com is like, you know, very front and center and, like, tunnels and bridges and all that stuff.
00:01:53.432 - 00:02:18.008, Speaker A: So, yeah, it's been wild seeing the sport. Yeah, just the last six months. I mean, I remember I tweeted something out. I think it was December of 2021. I was like, I just got off because we were doing a kind of end of year talking to clients, and I'd just spoken with a lot of cmos of different companies, and they're like, I was like, what are you guys spending on? And they said, we're spending a ridiculous amount, amount of money on sports marketing. And sure enough, and I think they made a good call with Formula one. It'll be interesting.
00:02:18.008 - 00:02:33.024, Speaker A: One thing I saw yesterday is that PEPC, who, I don't know if you're a big football guy, but PEPC just pulled out of the Super bowl and PEPC's been like the title sponsor of the Super bowl. And you got to imagine someone like an FTX, crypto.com comes in and scoops that spot.
00:02:33.184 - 00:03:02.916, Speaker B: Yeah. Like, obviously a lot of people like the Super bowl where Coinbase did an advertisement. Like, there's mixed, there's sort of mixed, like, analysis of, like, how powerful that was. Like, how many users, like, like, the roas return on ad spend, I guess, which is a very nebulous thing. But, like, at the end of the day, like, crypto is still very much, you know, people know about crypto, but they don't know about it, you know what I mean? And so I think, like, it's just entering mainstream and, you know, being part of these major events pushes the needle forward, I guess.
00:03:02.980 - 00:03:32.310, Speaker A: I think you'll end up seeing a lot of, and I think about this a lot because blockworks itself is a very sponsorship and ad race. Part of our business at least is very sponsorship and ad based. Like this podcast. Right? It's free for everyone, but there's, there's sponsors and stuff on it. And so I think a lot about what crypto ad spend looks like, and I think you'll end up seeing a big pullback in sponsorships and ads over the next maybe twelve to 18 months. When you think about the number of new people who come into crypto, it always happens in a bull market. Right? Everyone comes in, in a bull market.
00:03:32.310 - 00:03:48.816, Speaker A: So because of that, companies really ramp up their spending. And then in a bear market, as people, you don't really have many new people coming to the industry in a bear market, it's really just people inside of crypto kind of cycling between products and things like that and testing out different things. And so because of that, most companies end up pulling back their ad spend.
00:03:48.990 - 00:04:02.652, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it's interesting that you talk about the market because. Yeah, well, there's a lot to unpack. Obviously, a lot has happened, I guess, since we last did a roundup the market. I mean, I don't know if you want to cover, like, the market.
00:04:02.788 - 00:04:18.454, Speaker A: I do want to cover the market. Before that, I just want to say we missed you. From me and everyone who listens to this show, and literally, like, I was gonna say dozens, I think it might have been over 100 people who came up being like, is Santiago here? Is Santiago here? Speakers, sponsors, and listeners.
00:04:18.494 - 00:04:42.454, Speaker B: And it's very humbling to hear that. Obviously, I would have loved to have been there. I was actually on my way, got rugged by airlines, like, you know, to the point that I was going to miss the panel. And then it was unclear if I was going to be able to come back home and my parents are going to be here. And so it just ended up being one of those things where I had to. I was rugged by the airlines, and I think a lot of other people did, too. Just erratic, like, weather and all this stuff.
00:04:42.454 - 00:04:53.398, Speaker B: But maybe the world is just not prepared for people to go back to, like, normal travel, I think so. I'm really sorry, everyone. I couldn't be there. But we'll do it again next year.
00:04:53.566 - 00:05:10.210, Speaker A: We got rugs. Auntie, you got to go bigger and better than next year. So, dude, it was crazy. I was on the plane. So we just did this rebrand. You guys should all go check out the COVID photo of Empire, and if you like it, go share it or something like that. Before the rebrand, it was like just my face.
00:05:10.210 - 00:05:30.634, Speaker A: It was like the top half of my face on the thing, which, obviously neither you nor me really liked it that much. And I was on the airline. I was on the airplane flying down, and I'm looking at this guy, like, three seats in front, and he's across the aisle, so I can see his phone, and he pulls it up in my face is on this guy's iPhone. Yeah, exactly. So it was pretty funny. It was pretty funny.
00:05:30.674 - 00:05:43.838, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, I mean, it sounds like, as always, we always invite listeners to give us their feedback. Feedback. And sounds like a couple of folks gave you some good feedback and things that we should talk more about in the episode, which we'll try to cover this time and going forward, of course.
00:05:43.966 - 00:05:55.342, Speaker A: Yeah. So let's get into it. Nasdaq's down like 30%. S and P down 20%. Crypto is down, I think. What was the high? Maybe 3 trillion in November. It's down to what? Like 1.2
00:05:55.342 - 00:06:12.280, Speaker A: trillion today. Global debt to GDP is 350%. Snapchat just got hammered. Fell like 40% in a day. Inflation still sitting at above 8%. UK just printed a 40 year high of 9%. Amazon just announced they're going to sublet $30 million.
00:06:12.280 - 00:06:34.612, Speaker A: Excuse me, 30 million warehousing space. You're starting to see these layoffs like buy now, pay later. COVID darlings like klarna just laid off 10% of its workforce. Bolt just laid off, like 25%. To 33% of their workforce. I don't think this is really announced yet, but I think you're going to start seeing more crypto companies doing hiring freezes. And I think Travis Kling put it well in one sentence.
00:06:34.612 - 00:06:43.404, Speaker A: He said, the US economy is legit, wind sprinting towards a recession right now. What is your framework for how you're viewing the markets today? Santa?
00:06:43.524 - 00:07:21.752, Speaker B: Yeah, I've been thinking a lot about this. Like, in the episode with Travis, I said, well, like, it is possible that crypto continues to go down very severely and very correlated to the Nasdaq, which is exactly what you've seen. My kind of, my estimation, like, I know people like price targets, so I'm just gonna offer them up. I would have thought like 1500 for ETH and 25K for bitcoin was kind of a really. Kind of the bottom ish or a range where you feel comfortable, like, similar to, like, last cycle. I've sort of revisited my operating assumption a couple of weeks ago on the basis of, like, a couple of things. One was obviously Terra, which is idiosyncratic to crypto.
00:07:21.752 - 00:07:47.198, Speaker B: I think that hurt us. I mean, it was like 40 billion, meaning more value got destroyed there than, like, Lehman, which is remarkable, is wild. And looking further into, like, where people got hurt, like, I think 20% to 26% of users were from the US, a lot from Asia, especially Korea. So it's like. And a lot of it was retail. And so that invariably sets us back. I've always said it, the biggest risk this industry is self sabotage.
00:07:47.198 - 00:08:04.020, Speaker B: Like, we can talk about, like, terra. Was it a ponzi? Was not a Ponzi. I tweeted about this. I don't think it was a Ponzi. Was just, like, sort of caught up to not building enough utility in any ways. Like, bear markets really test the resiliency of protocols. And I don't think it ends with Terra, by the way, but nonetheless, just going back to.
00:08:04.020 - 00:08:23.958, Speaker B: Because of that, I revisited my assumption and I think we'll probably kind of bottom. I think of two frameworks. One is what's, like, the aggregate market cap of crypto as a whole. Like, where do we kind of bottom? And I think to me it feels like 800. 750 to 800 feels kind of about right, which, you know, 750 to 800.
00:08:24.006 - 00:08:25.494, Speaker A: Total market cap for crypto?
00:08:25.614 - 00:08:52.154, Speaker B: Yeah, like 800 billion. We're at 1.2 today, 1.25. Yesterday was like 1.3, but the market's now today. So that means you have probably, I'm thinking 20% to 30% more downside from here going into the second half of the year, which would probably place again, Ethan, in thousand ish range and bitcoin in the 20,000 range, obviously. Like, I'm not a.
00:08:52.154 - 00:09:15.122, Speaker B: Look, it's anyone's best guess. But what I am encouraged about is a couple of things. One, I think if you have a longer than one year time horizon, you can start seeing good entry points, because for me, my view is that crypto is going to be at least a $10 trillion asset class. Now, it might take longer. It usually always takes longer. I think we just been impatient. Right.
00:09:15.122 - 00:09:36.842, Speaker B: Um. Anyone that has been in crypto for the last two, three years has made a lot of money, and that's not because you were necessarily smart. It's just because the markets and QE and easy printing, like, the same as venture. Right. Um, but I do think that, like, I didn't think. I haven't seen, like, true pain. The same kind of pain that I saw in 2018, 2019.
00:09:36.842 - 00:09:56.874, Speaker B: Yeah. And for that reason, I feel like they're a couple of things. Take a couple of quarters to play out, meaning redemptions for funds. Take a couple of quarters to see. And so that's for selling. I think inflation is probably going to continue to persist. Like, food prices are up 30% on the year.
00:09:56.874 - 00:10:36.948, Speaker B: You basically invaded the bread basket of Europe. Russia and Ukraine supply a lot of fertilizers for the world. A lot of countries, like, 10% of the world's calories come from these two countries. What I'm starting to worry at is there's nothing transitory about this inflation. And I think it's going to put a lot of strain. And so for that reason, I'm not a macro expert, but I do think that it's sort of like, I don't feel like the immediate need to come out and start buying just yet, because I do think there's still negative skew, like, negative asymmetry in the market, where I'm just kind of waiting. I'm nibbing, but I'm waiting.
00:10:36.948 - 00:10:51.724, Speaker B: I'm not. I don't feel compelled to, like, really enter the market. Obviously, I'm super long crypto. I'm not shorting, but I'm having cash right now and just cash, really. I'm not trying to do anything. I'm not trying to be a hero in these moments. I just remind myself that the name of the game is to survive.
00:10:51.724 - 00:11:36.054, Speaker B: Because, you know, I think you and I can agree, like, it feels to me, to put it in perspective, Ethereum is worth, like, 280. Well, no, sorry, 200 billion ish. Yesterday when snap kind of announced earnings and the basket of social media companies like wiped roughly 100 billion of market cap, that means half of Ethereum. Now, put that into perspective, of course, critics might say, well, these applications actually have a lot of users and traction and I get it. But one to dying industry, the other one's not. And so I think for that reason, like, you know, the Nasdaq, like wipes out a trillion on a week, that's just the entire crypto market cap gone. Like, we're so early.
00:11:36.054 - 00:12:05.880, Speaker B: And so again, I'm trying to like present two frames. I'm not a short term trader, obviously. I pay attention to what's happening in the market because I want to survive. I want to be there to catch the bid when people are just really capitulating. I don't think that's full, like the full extent of that. I don't think it's kind of, we've seen, I think we started to see that we're starting to get some levels that are pretty painful for people. Um, but you know, I'm looking at, um, you know, second half of the year as, I don't know, probably weak ish.
00:12:05.880 - 00:12:11.520, Speaker B: And uh, I'm, I'm just going to be there to catch that bit. Yeah, ramble. I'm sorry. What do you think?
00:12:11.552 - 00:12:28.606, Speaker A: No, no, no. I mean, I think it's um, there are a couple of interesting points there. One is that maybe you thought we hit, hit the lows, but then this whole USD terror thing happened. And I think one thing that's really important there is, uh, just a learning there is that it's important to readjust your expectations based on what happens. Right. You should never just have one price in mind. Okay? I'm a buyer at 30k.
00:12:28.606 - 00:12:50.110, Speaker A: I'm a buyer. You have to adjust to the environment. Another interesting point there is that there's gonna be more contagion. There's gonna be more contagion in the markets and this is gonna spill out. And we haven't actually seen the ripple effects. One thing that comes to mind is like the NFT markets, there haven't been many for sellers in the NFT markets, really. And I still think the NFT markets are insanely overvalued.
00:12:50.110 - 00:13:31.940, Speaker A: And I think when you actually see some of this, like Max Payne, is when some of the new folks who came into NFTs start selling, selling their NFTs into ETH and then selling the ETH into US dollars fund redemptions, you make a really good point. Company insolvencies. I'm not saying the big companies, but if you remember back in 2018, 2019, there are a lot of these, like maybe 510 15 person companies that kind of just. It wasn't a big deal. They kind of just closed shop, and founders went and took jobs at Coinbase, and maybe they went back to their web two jobs, but that's what kind of Max Payne looks like. A lot of the Terra UST stuff was just really hyper focused so far, at least in that terra ecosystem.
00:13:32.092 - 00:14:11.974, Speaker B: Listen, I like what you said, thinking probabilities, and there's a couple of scenarios. Again, crypto is not going to go away. Increasingly less. The probability of crypto dying off is low, lower, and increasingly so. You have really positive stuff that goes unnoticed in these type of market environments, meaning like Shopify, Instagram, a lot of really big merchants are supporting nfts and accepting bitcoin as a payment. Like the Central African Republic now accepted bitcoin. And there was an interesting meeting in El Salvador with, I think it was 38 or 40 central bankers.
00:14:11.974 - 00:14:28.934, Speaker B: Again, we've seen this movie before in 2017. There was a lot of hype. There was a lot of companies announcing that they were going to support crypto because it's a nice thing to do and you want to be a relevant company, you know, be cool for millennials or whatever, but it feels real now for the reason that you're getting a lot of utility.
00:14:29.354 - 00:14:29.778, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:14:29.826 - 00:14:47.210, Speaker B: Now, okay. A lot of protocols were just like. Like, yield farming is sort of. What's that saying? Like, like really powerful technology, like, feels like magic, or feels like is indiscernible from magic. And I feel like. Like yield farming is not magic. Like, let's put that aside.
00:14:47.282 - 00:14:47.786, Speaker A: Right, right.
00:14:47.810 - 00:15:13.824, Speaker B: But there is actual real utility in some parts of crypto. Not. Not all. Like the idea of collecting, the idea that people now want to collect a thing called an NFT, and then they open up their imagination to being. Having ownership of digital content is pretty powerful. NfTs, whatever the. Regardless of the floor of some of these, like, blue chip projects or just writ large market, I think you're gonna.
00:15:13.824 - 00:15:45.616, Speaker B: I sort of see the continuation of that trend. Now. You might argue that people might, you know, not to the raging, euphoric kind of. Kind of activity that you saw, but it's not gonna go away. And it acts as an onboarding funnel, and you get a lot of utility. What I'm trying to say with all this is I'm actually calmer now than what I was, like, six, nine months ago. I get really nervous and on the edge when I, when it's sort of a raging bull market and valuations are like a hundred million for pre product stuff.
00:15:45.760 - 00:16:17.356, Speaker A: You know who said this exact thing is Bill Gurley. And I don't know if you listen to all in and Chamath and David Sachs and those guys, but they just had their all in summit and they had this panel with Bill Gurley, and Bill Gurley. At one point goes the calmness that I feel is right after the site, right after the hype cycle blows up, because things make sense again. And really what you're talking about is, oh, okay, this makes sense, right? Salaries kind of go back to normal. Funding goes back to normal. Yeah. Just valuations go back to normal, expectations go back.
00:16:17.356 - 00:16:49.244, Speaker A: I feel the same way, which is. And Mike and I are talking about this. I've been talking about this a lot, is things are just going back to how we believe the world works. Right? And it got really hard to operate and run a business in the second half of 2021 because nothing made sense. It got really, really tough. And you're like, are we doing the right thing? We were still cautious with hiring, and we're always optimistic, but also kind of cautious. And we're like, are we being too cautious? And now we're, now we're kind of patting ourselves on the back saying, okay, I think we did a good job here.
00:16:49.324 - 00:17:36.706, Speaker B: Listen, in crypto, you always have to assume that in a four time in the cycle, no matter what you're holding, you should be prepared for an 80% drawdown, at least for something like bitcoin. Right? And so, like, if you invert and you say, okay, whatever I'm holding, then I should kind of prepare for that eventuality. And I should not think about this artificially propped up number of low float coins and, like, adjust your spending or your plans on that. Now, I think if, like, you know, I get really excited now because, like, seed rounds are now properly priced not at 50 million or 60 or 100, but actually at 20, which is a value. Human capital. There's a lot of. I still see kind of a disconnect between public markets and private markets.
00:17:36.706 - 00:17:42.074, Speaker B: Now you have a 16 z that just raised a $4.3 billion fund.
00:17:42.154 - 00:17:46.586, Speaker A: Which one, four, five, 1.5 for the seed. That's crazy.
00:17:46.770 - 00:17:52.562, Speaker B: Well, I'm like, well, what does that mean? Does that mean that, like, a seed is now a growth deal or.
00:17:52.698 - 00:17:58.578, Speaker A: So let's actually do the math on this, because that was, that was crazy fun to me. So, by the way, shout out to.
00:17:58.586 - 00:18:02.066, Speaker B: The 16 C team, like, I think. Like, they have done wonders to think.
00:18:02.130 - 00:18:15.850, Speaker A: No, I agree. I agree. And Chris gave one of the keynotes at permissionless, and it was amazing. And, well, by the way, you can watch that video on YouTube. I think we're putting it up tomorrow or the next day. But, um, four point. Let's do the math on this, actually.
00:18:15.850 - 00:18:29.810, Speaker A: So, $4.5 billion fund, 3 billion for venture, 1.5 billion for seed. Um. So scary, trying to do, uh, public mental math here. But how much. How much does a 16 z put into, on average, into a deal for, uh, a seed?
00:18:29.962 - 00:18:42.794, Speaker B: I mean, a seed round is no more than two to 3 million, I would argue, like, like, not stretching it, because I think that's series eight. Like, well, series eight is probably 10 million, but, like, okay, in crypto, historically, it's been lower. But assume. Okay, so let's say one and a half.
00:18:42.834 - 00:18:47.166, Speaker A: Let's say 2 million. Okay, so let's. Let's call it two. Let's be optimistic here. 1.5, then you.
00:18:47.230 - 00:18:49.958, Speaker B: 500 deals, 500 seeds.
00:18:50.006 - 00:18:54.422, Speaker A: 750. Yeah. I mean, no, it's. I think it's 750. Right. Whatever the matter is.
00:18:54.438 - 00:19:03.430, Speaker B: Yeah. I'm assuming, like, I think they have a billion for seed. And if you're assuming, like, on average, they're gonna deploy two to three, you know, that's 400. Call it between five.
00:19:03.582 - 00:19:11.628, Speaker A: An average of five. Let's call 500. 500 companies. They need to get in that seed round. The math there is crazy. I mean, they're basically just trying to own the space.
00:19:11.766 - 00:19:13.384, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, yeah, but that.
00:19:13.424 - 00:19:26.424, Speaker A: So that's basically the Tiger model specifically for crypto. Right. Which is, if you are allocated to Tiger's venture fund, you are indexing venture. And Tiger just created a system where they could spit out term sheets on the hour. Right.
00:19:26.464 - 00:19:26.968, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:19:27.096 - 00:19:42.176, Speaker A: And by allocating to that fund, you weren't getting their, like, portfolio managers. You were getting access to venture, and you were indexing venture. And it feels like by investing in Andreessen, by the way, I could be totally wrong here. The Andreessen guy should come on the podcast, but it feels like you're indexing crypto venture.
00:19:42.280 - 00:20:03.184, Speaker B: I think so. Like, I mean, no matter what, it's encouraging to see that. That there is capital that is looking to get deployed, which. Which brings me to another point that I want to raise, which is, look, there's a lot of allocators that increasingly have done the work on crypto. We talked about in the episode with icky Guy guy. Travis. Travis.
00:20:03.224 - 00:20:03.400, Speaker A: Sorry.
00:20:03.432 - 00:20:44.642, Speaker B: That crypto is a more investible asset class because it's bigger. Ethereum is transitioning to a more ESG friendly narrative, which is important. And so you sort of think, and like the tier one venture funds, the latest cohort vintage that was raised like a couple years ago, two, three, four years ago, and are harvesting now, I think the tier one, like top quartile funds did like two x 2.25 x, that would have placed you, like, in the best, like, benchmark, for instance, is probably top. They probably outperform because they've done some phenomenal investments. One of the few funds that has been disciplined, actually in fun size, they've never raised more. Right there, 250 million.
00:20:44.642 - 00:21:43.554, Speaker B: Exactly, which is exactly incredible, and I respect that a lot. Nonetheless, the best tier one crypto funds probably done at least a ten x. Now, that's not necessarily going to be the case, but what I'm trying to say is, okay, so if you're a pension fund, if you're a major allocator of capital, as soon as this dust settles, whenever that may be, whether it's the second half of this year, the Fed decides to kind of slow down, tapering and whatever, and inflation is under control, and assume that all kind of that plays out at some point. Allocators, like in 2008, like in March 2020, after these huge shocks, they say, okay, I need to allocate. If I was in cash, I survived. I need to go back and make up. And I think that's the bull case for crypto here, which is whenever that happens, would they allocate to venture, or are they going to allocate to the next ark of innovation of the Internet, like the highest growth area, which is crypto.
00:21:43.554 - 00:22:19.778, Speaker B: And I believe that, and I think more people increasingly believe that. And so you almost have to think how many those dollars are going to go to your traditional fund investing in enterprise software or in crypto. And I think more people are. More funds are going to start allocating to the house of class at some point. Yeah, but the name of the game today, as I sit in my chair, is just survive. I've seen so many funds do dumb shit over the years, they blow up. And the name of the game now, every fund, it's now in fashion to, like, put out your letters and saying, here's what we sent the founders.
00:22:19.778 - 00:22:28.570, Speaker B: Hey, guys, don't spend all the money that we gave you. Actually. Just bunker down, survive. I'm like, well, no shit. That's all. That should always be the operating assumption, to your point. Jeez.
00:22:28.570 - 00:22:29.978, Speaker B: Yeah, you guys have never.
00:22:30.066 - 00:22:33.202, Speaker A: But I will say, I disagree with some of these notes that are going out.
00:22:33.298 - 00:22:53.302, Speaker B: Yeah, it's all horseshit. If you have capital. Now, the biggest problem that crypto companies have faced over the years in this raging bull market has been hiring. Now, if you raise around and you have a war chest, tell me why you shouldn't go out there and hire the best talent and snatch that up and build. Find out.
00:22:53.438 - 00:23:18.210, Speaker A: Here are the three things that I'm just. I haven't invested in as many companies as obviously you have, but here are the things that I'm thinking about for blockworks. Right. One, and the ways that I'm advising some of the other companies I've invested in is first things first. Get to a sustainable business model. And I'm actually curious if you agree or disagree with that, because in traditional venture, you actually don't really have to get to sustainable for a long time. Or at least that's been the last.
00:23:18.282 - 00:23:20.690, Speaker B: For the last ten years, since QE started.
00:23:20.842 - 00:23:40.514, Speaker A: So I'm saying try to get to a sustainable business model. And by the way, token go up is not a sustainable business model. We're really lucky at blockworks that we've, outside of a very small check on day one of the business, we've actually never raised capital. And so we were forced to create a sustainable business model. But that's the first thing. Token go up is not a sustainable business model. Try to build a sustainable business.
00:23:40.514 - 00:24:04.196, Speaker A: Number two, keep your foot on the gas when it comes to R and D. Don't trim. Trim down everywhere else. Trim down your sales budget, your marketing budget. Trim down on just your operating expenses. Keep your foot on the gas for R and D and your product, because at some point, this bear market ends and you should try to emerge much stronger than everyone else on the product side. Once you have a good product, you can ramp up the sales and marketing pretty quickly.
00:24:04.196 - 00:24:47.054, Speaker A: Um, and the last thing is just scoop up good talent. Uh, anyone who was hiring in 2018, 2019 knows that you got. It's kind of a weird way to put it when it comes to people. But, like, insane deals on talent, there are some amazing, amazing people that might get laid off or might realize that their companies don't have sustainable business models and will hit the market for the first time in two to three years. You should be, if you've already raised and you have the capital, you should be on the hunt for those people. And I think Sequoia actually had one good piece of feedback, which is crypto companies are very adverse to hiring CFO's or director of finance or vp of finance. I think because a lot of people think that a good CFO sits around and tells you not to spend money.
00:24:47.054 - 00:25:07.978, Speaker A: That's not what a CFO does. They sit around and tell you how to invest your capital. They're like the capital allocator within the company. They tell you how to allocate that capital wisely. So I think a lot of companies would be in a good place to actually hire a director of finance or a VP of finance or a CFO right now. And we're doing the same blockworks. I mean, we're hiring a director of finance right now for the first time.
00:25:08.026 - 00:25:44.944, Speaker B: So yeah, yeah, really good points. And the thing that I'll add is, you know, it's okay if you're starting a business and you don't necessarily kind of know your monetization model. And sometimes like social media at the very, very beginning was like this. Even when Facebook was doing the IPO, I remember like a lot of people didn't understand how you monetize attention. And of course, now you see Google, which attracts 80. Every marketing, digital marketing dollar spent goes to Google, total monopoly. And Facebook has a lion.
00:25:44.944 - 00:26:19.024, Speaker B: The rest of the slice is Facebook and a few other platforms. But what I'm trying to say is, it's okay. I don't expect when I invest a founder to exactly know what the viable business model is going to be. Sometimes, like you understand that you're creating something, that there's going to be a lot of demand. And, and when you're investing in a network, I think if you have a lot of demand, then it becomes easier to, I think to some extent monetize and build a business around that. So you want to kind of loosen some restraints of saying, okay, fine, it's a killer product. I'm going to take a fly on a really good founder.
00:26:19.024 - 00:27:13.010, Speaker B: But at some point, like you need to understand, like how are these networks going to make money? Now? Thinking of something like Ethereum is easier. I think in many ways easier and harder because you say back to my initial opening statement, which is let's think about for a second how much you think Ethereum should be worth. It is powering multiple verticals and applications. The demand for block space goes up as there's more activity on the network. L two's net net allow for more throughput and activity in Ethereum and supporting more users, including nfts, defi, gaming, you name it. It's almost like to explain it to someone normal. I was on the road the other day and someone said, wow, it would be great.
00:27:13.010 - 00:27:30.150, Speaker B: There was a huge traffic and everyone was paying on the toll road. It would be great to own this business. I'm like, yeah, absolutely. It's a cash cow. That's kind of like owning ETH, except your distribution is not tied to the infrastructure of a particular road and geography. You're basically monetized. You're creating a monetization layer on the Internet.
00:27:30.150 - 00:28:02.464, Speaker B: The entire services provided by the Internet. Not one application like Facebook or Google might be the closest analogy here, which is Google kind of like, again, captures most search, is something that is very pervasive and opens up what you do in the Internet. Like there's an open canvas of you querying information and retrieving that. In Ethereum, similarly, you own it. Then you understand that, like, the value accrual layer is pretty clear. There's more demand in the network than it's tied back to Ethereum ETH, the substrate that powers all this. Right.
00:28:02.464 - 00:28:06.480, Speaker B: We've heard these analogies, right. I'm just trying to put it in perspective because sometimes people come new to.
00:28:06.592 - 00:28:10.280, Speaker A: Yeah, like iOS, right? It's like, yeah, but all these apps.
00:28:10.312 - 00:29:00.694, Speaker B: Sort of oil, the oil of the web3 economy, if you will. And so, yeah, the last thing this is like, yeah, it is impossible to time markets. Like, like don't for a second. I'm not like, I always assume that I'm never going to be able to do that. But in many ways, like you're able to imagine this, you're today you're reaching levels where you can start investing in companies that have been battle tested, that have real utility and usage. And you can monitor this on chain and see how in this environment, like the number of users that are going to opensea or going to some like maker and opening CDP's, or you can assess this in real time and make your own conclusions. Yeah, but you're able to pick up these names three years now of more progress than last cycle at the same or lower valuation.
00:29:00.694 - 00:29:08.362, Speaker B: That to me feels like a pretty interesting environment to allocate capital. Yeah, more de risked.
00:29:08.498 - 00:29:43.214, Speaker A: Yeah. Before you're talking about it, I do want to do this. I do want to talk about when you're buying, what you're buying, how you think about buying private versus public disconnect. The private markets are still really running away from Publix in crypto with starkware and layer zero and things like that, which I find pretty interesting. But before we do that, one more question on just how you're advising your portfolio companies and the companies you've invested in, I think a lot of people, when they hear the word leverage, think about investing. They think, okay, I levered up in an industry where the prices can fall 80%, any sort of leverage is going to wipe you out. Right.
00:29:43.214 - 00:30:27.820, Speaker A: Retail and institutional invest in the same assets. Institutional just manages risk better. And because oftentimes they actually don't lever up like retail does. I think that some people don't think about building companies in the same way, but maybe they should. And I think a lot of companies levered up in 2021, um, by maybe over hiring, uh, and just having costs get way ahead of their skis for those companies that quote, unquote levered up, um, their company, and maybe way over hired now that the asset prices are down 60, 70, 80%, uh, maybe their company growth rate has fallen 80%, maybe the revenue has fallen 80%. How are you advising those companies? Is it one fell swoop, swift action layoffs? Is it hiring freezes? Is it, how do you, how do you think about advising those port?
00:30:27.852 - 00:30:59.164, Speaker B: Cos it's a really good question. I actually haven't been in a situation where, like, that's, it's, it's been kind of recent, but I have been in instances where this comes up and look, I mean, I think, I think you trimmed the fat. Like, it's never, it's where you rip the band aid off. It's never fun. It's never. But, but survive, like, survival is the primary key here. And whenever a company is raising capital, I would say you have to assume that, like, you have to at least survive for, for 1824 months.
00:30:59.164 - 00:31:20.536, Speaker B: Well, there's one thing that, like. So, so I like one of the more interesting observations I got recently from one of really good founders said, look, one engineer does like, 80, like, literally 60, 70% of all the work here. Like, we could not live as a company without this engineer. And I have 20 others I could live without.
00:31:20.640 - 00:31:22.894, Speaker A: 80 20. Right? It's across sales, not even.
00:31:22.934 - 00:32:02.054, Speaker B: It's like a power lie, right? It's like one, one or two really good engineers go find that one person and retain him and pay him well. And I think sometimes, like, in these bull markets, it becomes like, let's just fill roles and bodies and community manage and all this crap. It's like, listen, stop going conferences, cut the crap, go home, build a fucking good product. That's it. You don't need to go on any, like, no disrespect to permissionless, like, I think conferences are important. We haven't seen social, like, we've been kind of in COVID, and it's difficult. Sometimes it's great to go to conferences, but if you're a team, I go to conferences because for me, it's great to meet all teams and it's a good, like, environment.
00:32:02.054 - 00:32:20.096, Speaker B: But I am wary of teams that constantly go hop around a conference circuit, go to one conference a year. One of my best investments was meeting Stani at Devcon in Osaka. That's it. I saw the booth. I'm like, wait, wait a minute, Ethan, like, and I met Stani, and that was one of the best investments I've ever made, full stop. But it hadn't. I been there.
00:32:20.096 - 00:32:35.528, Speaker B: It was difficult, but, like, no amount of financial engineering is going to fix a crappy product. You need to build a great product. Go find the right engineer. I think you're going to be able to find that. Of course, like, really good talent might be dissuade from entering crypto right now.
00:32:35.576 - 00:32:41.008, Speaker A: No, but on the other side there a lot of the web, two folks, their rsus are underwater so much, it's insane.
00:32:41.096 - 00:32:42.264, Speaker B: You read my mind. Exactly.
00:32:42.304 - 00:32:42.856, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:32:43.000 - 00:33:08.170, Speaker B: And so I think it's. Look, the name of the game is surviving. And I think this cycle will be testing the resiliency of protocols. If you're just some sort of nice yield farm that's not providing much value, you're going to be wiped. Like people going to like, that's it. But now is the time to deliver on your promise and deliver on your roadmap. One thing that.
00:33:08.170 - 00:33:25.380, Speaker B: That I find interesting from a lot of these venture folks is we'll see how much of this capital actually gets deployed. Because I guess what's important is I think we're, like, on record. Record number of commitments to funds, but not actual capital calls.
00:33:25.492 - 00:33:25.964, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:33:26.044 - 00:33:35.572, Speaker B: Because when you hear. It's important when you hear a headline like, hey, this venture fund raised Sandree cent, like, four and a half billion. It's not like they haven't called the capital. They haven't called the capital.
00:33:35.668 - 00:33:44.852, Speaker A: So tell us how that works. Okay, let's say someone raises $1 billion. How long does it take to call the capital? How many capital calls do you do? When do you decide when to call the capital? How does that actually work?
00:33:44.988 - 00:34:08.956, Speaker B: It depends on the fund. It depends on, like, their deal flow, right. Sometimes they might call, and a lot of times when it's a. Like, in this case, they might call depends on the, like, the quantum, but they might call, like, 10% of the fund. So they probably called 150 million or so, which if they're deploying, you know, that might last them six months or three months. Depends on the market environment. In bull market, you did Opensea.
00:34:08.956 - 00:34:24.893, Speaker B: You deployed what was 100 million in Opensea? Like, okay, well, yeah, like, you can see a path towards calling capital pretty quickly. Like a 16 c raised up fund, like, not too long ago. Was it a year ago? Yeah. The 2.2 billion and a half fund. Yeah, something like this. So, like, how much of that's been deployed? Probably a decent chunk.
00:34:24.893 - 00:34:54.054, Speaker B: Not all of it. How much of that's been called? Probably over 50%. But. But, yeah, you know, I think, like, you, you should reasonably assume that most of these funds have a ten year horizon of which five years is, like, their investment period. So capital probably gets called over that period. I would say, like, asymptotic, like, you probably call 50% in the first two years, but it kind of depends on the market environment, depends on the fund, depends on the manager and their strategy.
00:34:54.714 - 00:35:33.676, Speaker A: Speaking of funds, by the way, I think this, in the bear market, you're going to see a separation between crypto funds and non crypto funds. In the bull, you had, like, Tiger, and you had all these, uh, non, I would call them non crypto funds who are allocating to crypto, and they're actually doing quite well. What ends up happening in the bear as we go into, like, the depths of the bear. Um, and even I've just noticed this anecdotally on calls, a lot of the ones who developed this, like, quote, unquote, really deep interest in crypto, in the prior bull, they're going to lose their conviction in the depths of the bear. And you're going to have funds that have these, like, considerable vesting token positions from years past. And it's important to remember fund managers are just people, too. They get scared, they get jittery.
00:35:33.676 - 00:35:49.428, Speaker A: They are worried about their career. And if they start profit taking. Right. And I actually think that sends the markets down even further. But it actually kind of separates the real crypto investors from kind of the. I don't know. I don't know a better word for it, but, like, the fluffy ones.
00:35:49.556 - 00:35:53.860, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, I think it's a really good point, because Tiger is down 40% this year.
00:35:54.012 - 00:35:54.820, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:35:55.012 - 00:36:09.174, Speaker B: Well, from its peak, I think this year, 40%, probably now. Bit more. Now. 40, 45%. Yeah. Now, let me ask you a question. How much do you think crypto is a percentage of their portfolio? Five to 5%.
00:36:09.174 - 00:36:11.214, Speaker B: Seven.
00:36:11.714 - 00:36:12.458, Speaker A: Yeah. Five.
00:36:12.546 - 00:36:13.394, Speaker B: Less than five.
00:36:13.554 - 00:36:13.986, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:36:14.050 - 00:36:15.250, Speaker B: Can we agree? Probably less than ten.
00:36:15.282 - 00:36:16.226, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:36:16.290 - 00:36:18.618, Speaker B: Like, I don't think they have more than a billion dollars in ETH.
00:36:18.746 - 00:36:19.034, Speaker A: No.
00:36:19.074 - 00:36:24.106, Speaker B: Now it's liquid. What do you think they're gonna chop ETH?
00:36:24.250 - 00:36:24.602, Speaker A: Got it.
00:36:24.618 - 00:36:25.122, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:36:25.218 - 00:36:26.094, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:36:26.274 - 00:36:31.382, Speaker B: I think. And so that's why. Have we seen that? Maybe. I think a lot of, well, you.
00:36:31.398 - 00:36:35.198, Speaker A: I mean, it's not just you. You cut the longest tail of, you cut the risk.
00:36:35.246 - 00:36:35.834, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:36:36.134 - 00:36:39.246, Speaker A: For them, as they view it, that ETH is farthest on the risk factor.
00:36:39.270 - 00:36:43.990, Speaker B: Yeah. Like, how many portfolio managers are covering crypto in Tiger? How many of them are covering enterprise software?
00:36:44.142 - 00:36:44.950, Speaker A: Right. Exactly.
00:36:44.982 - 00:36:52.474, Speaker B: Who's gonna pile table when Chase says, hey, guys, we're getting redemptions, we need a chop. What are you gonna chop? Yeah, all crypto gone. Done?
00:36:52.554 - 00:36:53.090, Speaker A: Yeah, done.
00:36:53.122 - 00:36:57.614, Speaker B: That's probably going to happen second half of this year, and I want to be there. I want to be there to buy.
00:36:59.274 - 00:37:25.224, Speaker A: Empire is brought to you by Bitmex. With the launch of their spot exchange. Bitmex is running an insane promo right now. We wanted to give you the inside scoop. Here's the deal. For the next two months, users who trade dollar 250 worth of crypto on Bitmex's spot exchange will be entered into their million dollar giveaway. Prizes range from thousands of dollars all the way up to $500,000.
00:37:25.224 - 00:37:50.772, Speaker A: That's right. Trade $250 on Bitmex for a chance to personally win $500,000. Beyond the million dollar giveaway, new users can also get up to 200. BMex. BMex. That's Bitmex's new token coming soon just by creating an account and going through KYC and trading. So you can actually get BitMex tokens just by creating an account and trading.
00:37:50.772 - 00:38:03.224, Speaker A: The more you trade, the higher your chances of winning. What are you waiting for? Go to bitmex.com today. Sign up for an account bitmex.com dot. Exactly. So good pivot into.
00:38:03.224 - 00:38:20.256, Speaker A: I'm assuming you're still not buying. I think you actually mentioned that. I'm also not buying yet. But if I think if I was smart, I probably would be buying. Right. Because those who try to time the absolute bottom, it usually doesn't work well for me.
00:38:20.360 - 00:38:23.704, Speaker B: Let's put it in perspective. Okay. Like, I'm very long crypto. A lot of it.
00:38:23.744 - 00:38:29.344, Speaker A: No, let me just say I'm not selling any crypto. I'm very, I don't think we need to preface that.
00:38:29.384 - 00:38:34.032, Speaker B: I want the cash. I want the cash. Like Q three, Q four last year. Q four last year.
00:38:34.208 - 00:38:35.448, Speaker A: Way to give me the hint.
00:38:35.616 - 00:38:58.992, Speaker B: 2020. Tell me when you're my friend. 25% of my book was in cash. November, December of last year. I just wanted to end the year in a well capitalized position, and that ended up being a good call. I guess I've deployed a decent chunk of that into privates over the course of last two quarters. And so.
00:38:58.992 - 00:39:10.828, Speaker B: But now I'm not like, as compelled yet. But as I said, you know, I think I will start nibbing. I don't know, like, it's starting to feel like actual pain.
00:39:10.876 - 00:39:48.028, Speaker A: Like, I think it feels like you're fighting the Fed. And that's the difference here, is that every single crypto cycle has been with the momentum of the Fed behind you. Even if there's a crypto bear market, you're still, you're still riding the waves of this colossal global macro bull market. And this time is different for the first time ever in crypto's history, because you're fighting the Fed and you're going into what feels like a global macro bear right for the first time since 2009. When does that change? I have no clue. No one has any idea. But it does feel like you're fighting the Fed until maybe into late Q three, Q four, maybe early 2023.
00:39:48.028 - 00:39:52.424, Speaker A: And so that, for me, is the reason I'm not doing anything. It's like, I just.
00:39:54.284 - 00:39:57.184, Speaker B: Do you think we're going to see triple digit ETH? Like sub thousand?
00:39:58.524 - 00:40:01.740, Speaker A: Do I think we see triple? Yes, I think we see triple digit ETH.
00:40:01.812 - 00:40:05.104, Speaker B: I think 900, 800, 600, 400.
00:40:06.364 - 00:40:08.284, Speaker A: I don't know. I don't know.
00:40:08.324 - 00:40:09.412, Speaker B: Zero. It's going to zero, guys.
00:40:09.508 - 00:40:26.524, Speaker A: So here. Yeah, I mean, what I think ends up happening is like, I think the ETH merge. I'm incredibly optimistic about the ETH merge, but not on price in the short term. In a bear market, if you remember, like, in a bull market, everyone loves the fundamentals. They're like, look how much cash flow Zack axie is spitting off. Look how much cash they love. The fundamentals.
00:40:26.524 - 00:40:51.962, Speaker A: In a bear market, there is no fundament. There is nothing that can turn a price, a downward price back around. It's, it's almost like, I think Kane said this, it's like any, any news or anything about your project is bad news because it reminds people. It reminds people that they're holding that asset and. Yeah, I think. I don't know. I want to believe folks like Travis and the framework guys who say the ETH merge is going to be really, really exciting.
00:40:51.962 - 00:41:04.064, Speaker A: I think the framework guys said that, but feels like there's too many cards against us. So, yeah. What do you think about. What do you think about the ETH merge? Do you think that moves the price, or do you think it kind of just, we cruise right past it?
00:41:04.144 - 00:41:09.564, Speaker B: No, I think you said it very well, which is, on the long term, hugely important.
00:41:09.864 - 00:41:10.644, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:41:11.304 - 00:41:38.538, Speaker B: And it sets us up really nicely. But I'm not gonna. I mean, historically, a lot of these events have been not. Well, price. The IP 1559, every single block like bitcoin happening event is not priced in. But you're right again, these are changing times. I am not old enough to be investing in my professional investing career, which started right after the financial crisis.
00:41:38.538 - 00:41:41.418, Speaker B: I've never been in an environment that doesn't have QE and cheap money.
00:41:41.546 - 00:41:42.114, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:41:42.234 - 00:42:12.780, Speaker B: And I like to remind myself of that. Like, I was talking about with my. My parents yesterday said, look, I consider myself being extremely lucky to have caught this bitcoin bug early on. And also. But I need to also remind myself that even if I were investing in other things other than crypto would have made a lot, like, it would have been a very favorable environment if you're in stocks, if you were in a basically long innovation and farther end of the risk spectrum, if you're willing to take risk for the last ten years, you were handsomely rewarded. Does that make you a great investor? Not necessarily.
00:42:12.852 - 00:42:13.532, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:42:13.708 - 00:42:29.856, Speaker B: And so, like, I don't know. Like, I feel like the average. Most people come to crypto. It's exciting. You understand the potential, but narratives always get ahead of fundamentals. And I am. Maybe I'm over correcting or being overly cautious here, because I don't.
00:42:29.856 - 00:43:07.166, Speaker B: I think we're entering kind of. There are a lot of things that I don't understand and influx and look, some of the best investments you make, and they feel really, really uncomfortable. I remember when I first bought ETH, the ICO, it felt extremely uncomfortable. I listened to Vitalik speak, but I never saw it. And then I bought a bunch of ETH, and then I looked at him like I saw a video, and I'm like, what have I done here? Like, this is an 18 year old kid who came working from, like, Bitcoin magazine. And, like, I love Vitalik, but, like, you're like, wait a minute. I just invested in, like, this guy's trying to build a world supercomputer.
00:43:07.166 - 00:43:46.598, Speaker B: And you could feel that he's really smart. But it felt, candidly, a lot of people don't like to go back. And, like, you know, it felt to me very uncomfortable. I didn't necessarily do it because I believed in, like, I loved open source, but there were a lot of other protocols at the time that were trying to do what Ethereum is trying to do, like, made safe and like a few others. And it's important to, like, understand that, I think, because, and I like to remind myself of that because there will come a time where I will start buying. And, you know, near term I might just feel like an idiot. But, you know, if you, again, if you have a longer than one or two year horizon, I think you'll be okay.
00:43:46.766 - 00:44:10.020, Speaker A: Yeah, I think, yeah. Keep in mind it's only been six months since the top. And usually if you look at past cycles, you've got the first couple months, or, like, you unwind. I think it was Ian from syndicate had this nice thing. It was like, the first couple months, you unwind and stabilize. The next, like, five months, you restructure, you refocus, you start collaborating with others. By the end of the first year, you start to get these kind of breakthrough discoveries.
00:44:10.020 - 00:44:43.530, Speaker A: Then into year two, you start building and you've got growth. And then after maybe 18 months, two years, you get the new bull market, which ends up being bigger than the last one. And keep in mind, we've only been six months into this bear market. Depending on how you want to define it, I think we can close the price conversation and buying conversation with two things. One is, uh, you're saying, how, how low does ETH go? Let's look at the numbers from the last cycle at $20,000 bitcoin. Bitcoin is down 70% from the all time high. In pretty much every other bear market, it fell like 85% to 90%.
00:44:43.530 - 00:45:18.964, Speaker A: So down 70% from the highs would be the best bear market we've ever had. And that's at 20k bitcoin. When that happens, or if that happens, I should say expect pretty much all of the other long tail of assets in crypto to be down 85% to 95% from their highs. If they're quality. If they're not quality, they go to zero and they never bounce back up. But if they're quality, and the last thing I would just say on price is know that selling here and losing, not about selling, know that losing interest in crypto here will likely cause a lot of future regret.
00:45:19.124 - 00:45:36.232, Speaker B: Yeah. Like, guys, we are entering. Like, I, again, my long term thesis is unchanged. I was advising a bunch of founders in the Alliance Dao. I said, guys, like, you got to remember why you did that. Like, it is important to write down shit and say, this is my thesis. It's important.
00:45:36.232 - 00:45:52.074, Speaker B: It's okay to change your thesis and update your assumptions, like, absolutely. These are all operating, working hypotheses that need to be updated with new information and probabilities. But again, crypto, there's more regulation coming, which I think is going to be positive.
00:45:52.374 - 00:45:53.158, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:45:53.326 - 00:46:09.854, Speaker B: Long term. My thesis is unchanged now. Yeah, of course, this is a healthy cleansing of a lot of garbage out there. A lot of garbage. And that's fine. Like, look, in these moments, there's. I mean, this could be a huge wealth transfer from people that believe in this.
00:46:09.854 - 00:46:32.826, Speaker B: And I'm not. I'm not like, I'm not a hodler. Like, a die hard hodler, everyone. The last thing I'll say is, you can't listen to a lot of these people give you advice. I don't like to give advice on this stuff. I don't like to give price targets because I might. I might change my mind 2 seconds after I said something and I made this mistake in the last cycle, I didn't have.
00:46:32.826 - 00:46:59.708, Speaker B: Look, I've sold ETH at $0.75. I've sold ETH at 6718, 24, 100, 154,000. And everywhere along the way, not a lot. I've sold more stuff than ETH. ETH has been probably the thing that I hold on to the most over time. But what I'm trying to say is, like, I look back and the mistakes that I made is, are because I didn't have, like, a good understanding of why I was doing something.
00:46:59.836 - 00:47:25.706, Speaker A: You didn't have conviction that you created yourself. You listen to other folks. I've made that mistake so many times in crypto, too. I listened to someone say, they're buying XYZ token, but not realizing that they don't tell me when they're selling XYZ token or just the full scope of that. So, no, I agree. I want to move into a couple of predictions with you, Santi, and one, so you tweeted on May 15, that's your bottom. You had some nice tweets recently.
00:47:25.706 - 00:47:45.246, Speaker A: That's your bottom signals. Tweet. I've got a list. Yeah, exactly. No, you had predictions for, I think, the second half of this year tweet. And the first one was that Coinbase would be acquired by large tradfi. Coinbase has fallen from, I think they ipo to around like 80 or 90 billion or maybe that was like their high third at what? Like, let's pull it up.
00:47:45.246 - 00:47:47.494, Speaker A: 15 billion today. 15 billion Coinbase stock.
00:47:47.534 - 00:47:48.110, Speaker B: Yep.
00:47:48.262 - 00:47:49.954, Speaker A: Yeah. 15 and a half billion.
00:47:52.214 - 00:47:58.430, Speaker B: I tweeted that, by the way, like, when it hit 50, I tweeted that when it hit 53 and it announced earnings and it was trading at, like, close to.
00:47:58.542 - 00:47:58.950, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:47:58.982 - 00:48:00.424, Speaker B: I want to say, like, yeah, nine.
00:48:00.504 - 00:48:18.936, Speaker A: Well, I usually agree with you on most of your predictions. I strongly disagree with you on this one. So I want to get your take on why you have, like, what is the probability of this happens and, like, what is your conviction around bitcoin basically acquired? Yeah, well, let's say, what's the thesis here? Yeah.
00:48:19.120 - 00:49:01.868, Speaker B: If you're a large financial institution, look at what Coinbase and look at what JP Morgan's now doing. And Goldman and these banks are like, increasingly servicing and trying to catch up to service their customers that want the ability to buy crypto. And I think they're going to. When you've been neglecting an industry for so long, you want to catch up to that. And a very easy way to do that is by acquiring someone. Coinbase, we look at their business taking a hit, custody and trading has gone down and there's increasing competition for folks that get, like, I get it. I understand how and why the market has reacted the way it has, given their p and l and their margins and history behind that.
00:49:01.868 - 00:49:35.356, Speaker B: But if you're a JP Morgan, why wouldn't you acquire something for $15 billion? It's a drop in the bucket and it puts you immediately on the map of being able to service customers. Coinbase has regulatory modes, they have people internally that know how to operate. I think it's one of the few two or three exchanges that has never been hacked. So there's a lot of ip there that I think is worth something. And Coinbase is still synonymous amongst a lot of institutions and especially in the US, with buying crypto. Like you think of crypto, you think of Coinbase. No, no, I agree.
00:49:35.356 - 00:49:43.204, Speaker B: And that's worth, I think, at least 15 billion that think. I think that's worth 2020, 5 billion. If you're JP Morgan or someone, this is probably on your radar.
00:49:43.364 - 00:49:58.282, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay, so I agree with that. How much cash does JPMorgan have on hand? Cash and cash equivalents, like a lot? Yeah. Okay. 750 million. That sounds low. All right.
00:49:58.282 - 00:50:17.052, Speaker A: We can pull this number up later. 44 billion. That sounds more. Okay, so anyways, so JP Morgan's got a bunch of cash. Obviously they go to Coinbase. Why would Coinbase, why would Brian Armstrong, who's been through the 2015 bear, the 2018 and 2019 bear, why is he dumping at the bottom? Why is he selling coin? Or you're saying it's not up to you.
00:50:17.068 - 00:50:24.264, Speaker B: No, he's a fiduciary responsibility to deliver the most amount of value to investors. Now, I don't, I'm like, he can get.
00:50:24.564 - 00:50:29.636, Speaker A: I got to feel bad for it. Like, if that happens, I just feel shitty for Brian Armstrong because, well, it's.
00:50:29.660 - 00:51:02.084, Speaker B: Not a private company, right? So like, they have public shareholders. There might be an activist there. It says you have to sell. And I think that you bring a committee that does an independent appraisal and is it a fair deal? It's a fair deal. Now maybe he can block it by virtue of voting shares and super, like, I guess he can veto it if he wanted to. I think it was paradigm through the other founder who bought a bunch of Coinbase at the bottom, like at 55, $60. I think they bought like a couple hundred million, like 100 million or so.
00:51:02.084 - 00:51:46.526, Speaker B: And so what I'm trying to say is when you're a public company, you have more pressure from independent shareholders to unlock value. And so if some, if JP one comes in and bids, I don't know, 100 and 2100 bucks, like, you know, you kind of have fiduciary responsibility to at least entertain that bid. Now, sometimes people have structures that prevent from a hostile takeover, if you will, but it still might create like a bidding contest to buy and scoop Coinbase. Like, you can always have a shareholder knock on your door and say, we want to take you down. Like you, like, that's it. Like, I mean, it gets like, they're called hostile takeovers for a reason.
00:51:46.590 - 00:51:53.434, Speaker A: Yeah. God, I hope that doesn't happen. I would disagree here, but we will see.
00:51:53.894 - 00:52:12.372, Speaker B: I'm just looking at like, I think I've been thinking increasingly about, like, would you rather own like clean spot bitcoin or Coinbase? Because, I mean, one is pretty capital efficient because you can, like, use that as collateral to buy, like, you can stocks you can use pretty easily as collateral. And crypto, not so much.
00:52:12.428 - 00:52:15.984, Speaker A: You're going to the dark side now, Santi. Let me stop you. I know I'm not going any deeper.
00:52:16.964 - 00:52:25.704, Speaker B: Just think about this. Don't answer it, but just think about like, if you're an institutional player, like, would you rather own like, bitcoin or coin, like, Coinbase stock?
00:52:26.004 - 00:52:43.242, Speaker A: Well, I was, I was talking to a huge, like a very, very large institution actually yesterday, talking to them about our new research product that we launched last week. And I was asking them where the market goes. They said it depends on where Coinbase goes. I go, no, Coinbase depends. I go. Coinbase is dependent on where crypto goes. He goes, no, no, no.
00:52:43.242 - 00:53:05.056, Speaker A: You fundamentally misunderstand how these markets work now. Now that crypto is an institutional market, crypto is going to move wherever Coinbase moves. So he said crypto stays in a bear as long as Coinbase stock is down. I hadn't heard that take, and that's a very tradfi take, but that was his take, and I, and he manages billions of dollars. And so I found that, found that quite interesting.
00:53:05.160 - 00:53:44.444, Speaker B: Three things, just to round this out, three things, you could arguably call them leading indicators or important indicators, KPI's, if you will. One, the price of Coinbase. Two, crypto as a whole is now considered a leading indicator for risk appetite in the market. Like every single me, like CNBC, Bloomberg looks at, crypto, talks about it because it's inherently like a very real time, 24/7 barometer of willingness to take on risk in the market. And so that's interesting for any allocator of capital, whether you like crypto or not, it's just sentiment. It conveys a lot of sentiment in the market. And three is, I would monitor very closely the premiums and or discounts of grayscale shares of ETH, GBTC.
00:53:44.444 - 00:53:49.172, Speaker B: Some of these things, historically, they've traded a premium. Now they're at a pretty nasty premium.
00:53:49.268 - 00:53:51.380, Speaker A: Premium in a bull discount, premonable.
00:53:51.452 - 00:54:06.836, Speaker B: And historically, mind you, a lot of people didn't want to touch, like, the underlying asset. So this was an easy way to pay up for convenience. Now, that's, as custody solutions become more prevalent, that goes away because these are closed end funds, and so you can't really unlock value that easily.
00:54:06.940 - 00:54:30.996, Speaker A: Yeah. Let me ask you about one of these. One last prediction that you made here. You said a few crypto funds close shop, blow up or deeply underwater. When Luna, Ust Terra, the whole debacle went down, a lot of people started pointing at like, jump three arrows, Arca galaxy. And my gut reaction was like, people love to point fingers. Those funds are going to be just all right.
00:54:30.996 - 00:55:03.130, Speaker A: They're going to be totally fine. Like, they're, they're big enough that they're going to be fine. My worry started to look at maybe more, the $50 million funds. And this is because if you remember back in 20, 1820, 1920, March of 2020, the funds that blew up, it wasn't the billion dollar funds, it was the folks who had 20 million, 30 million, 50 million. So just, I mean, what, what is the scale of when you say a few crypto funds are going to close shop and blow up or they're going to be deeply underwater. First off, I think it's important to recognize there's a difference between blowing up and then just being too underwater. Uh, so you'd say you just close shop.
00:55:03.130 - 00:55:07.698, Speaker A: So maybe if you could touch on that and then touch on who you think, uh, maybe closes down.
00:55:07.786 - 00:55:46.200, Speaker B: I think it's a latter, which is uh, like Melvin Capital, for instance. The guys that were like shorting gamestop and got totally blown out by like, you know, that they closed shop recently because they, they returned capital some to investors and they said, listen, we're so deeply underwater that it's hard to retain cap, it's hard to retain employees. It's very difficult. So they're going to start over, which is kind of like a, like if you're an LP, it's pretty like, you know, frustrating, I guess, when like these people just close shop and say, like, it's going to take us three years to like make money, so we're going to start a new fund and like you can do that now again and.
00:55:46.232 - 00:55:48.888, Speaker A: It'S like filing for bankruptcy for, if you're a company.
00:55:48.936 - 00:55:49.904, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
00:55:50.064 - 00:55:50.472, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:55:50.528 - 00:56:01.560, Speaker B: And so I think that a lot of funds are going to be in that situation where like they're so underwater, like they're down 80%, that, you know, it becomes difficult to, to retain talent.
00:56:01.592 - 00:56:04.984, Speaker A: And big funds, small funds, any like tier one.
00:56:05.024 - 00:56:32.784, Speaker B: I don't have anyone, like, I think a lot of people like, got hurt pretty badly by Luna. Obviously. We saw which ones some, some people actually came out alright, whether shorting it or like were able to profit. Pantera came out with a letter saying that they made like 1.7 turned into 100 and 4146 or something million. So, you know, it's not certainly blowing up the funds, lost a lot of money. But, you know, like, I think if you're doing proper risk management, like Luna is never more than 10% of your book, 15% of your book at most.
00:56:32.784 - 00:56:58.610, Speaker B: Hash, I think probably more. I think between Axie and Luna it's a pretty sizable share of their portfolio. The other one is just reputational risk. I mean, the market has amnesia. So I think like, like even if you have a tattoo of luna, like, I think you'll be okay. Um, but, um, but yeah, no, I think it's, it's really that where it's not just Luna that's traded down so, so badly, if you're down 80%, it's kind of hard to recover from that.
00:56:58.802 - 00:56:59.482, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:56:59.618 - 00:57:30.054, Speaker B: Uh, if you're a whale fine. If you're an individual investor, fine. But when you're allocating and have managing people's money and you have redemption schedules and yeah, it's, mind you, redemption schedules that might come from people that want cash because they're chopping crypto because they're still up. If you've been in an LP and a lot of these funds, you have a one or three year lockup schedule, you're still pretty up at least 50%. So you might take the win and leave. And so that's what I worry about, that you have a lot of these redemptions for selling in a q two early next year, and that creates more pain in the market.
00:57:32.474 - 00:58:15.924, Speaker A: So, yeah, yeah, it feels like the, I think this is the last thing we can touch on, then we can close it down for the day is it feels like the discrepancy or maybe the desire to do privates instead of publics. It feels like people are so scared to touch public markets right now, starkware is raising it or just raised to 8 billion layer zero. It got leaked that they're raising at 3 billion. Right. And so keep in mind, these deals we were talking to, the layer zero guys a while ago, that people have been rate a lot of these numbers that you see, those were deals that were closed or nearly closed weeks, sometimes even months ago. So keep that in mind when you see some of these numbers. But it does feel like the desire to do to the privates is still so much higher than Publix and that the opportunity over the last year and a half has shifted to pr, has gone from privates.
00:58:15.924 - 00:58:27.284, Speaker A: Now it feels like it's maybe more in the publics. You are a real, you are really focused on the privates. You've always been early stage seed. Does this change your mindset and how you approach the markets?
00:58:27.364 - 00:58:43.516, Speaker B: Absolutely. Now there will come a time where I buy a lot liquid stuff like ETH. It's. I'm glad you brought this up because it's very hard to outperform ETH in the long term. It's hard, yeah. Most funds don't like, literally, you benchmark their performance against ETH and it's very, very hard.
00:58:43.700 - 00:58:44.276, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:58:44.380 - 00:59:25.432, Speaker B: And so on a risk adjusted basis, if you sitting here today, ETH is pretty compelling to me. Again, none of this financial bias, guys, but, you know, I've, my average entry point into 100 plus deals that I've done over the last like six, seven months has been like 30 million fully diluted. I feel like my margin of safety is pretty high. If I'm investing. This is what bill Ty is saying in really competent founders that are not going to give up and build a product that people use and love and care about. Some of them are going to die. But you need one, pretty good one or ten out of, you know, at least 510 percent of those to be huge outliers.
00:59:25.432 - 00:59:29.794, Speaker B: It's a power law. Distribution in early stage.
00:59:29.984 - 00:59:30.374, Speaker A: Yep.
00:59:30.414 - 00:59:59.764, Speaker B: But I again, like ETH, there's a lot of really positive catalysts. I like bitcoin, you know, as well as a just general hedge on the world going bananas. And so like, yeah, I agree with you. Like, I think it's the thing with public is, and this goes back to the hardest thing. And someone commented when I was making these predictions, like, just tell us when you're selling. And I'm like, give us some advice around that. And honestly, it's the hardest thing to do.
00:59:59.764 - 01:00:08.144, Speaker B: It's super hard. Even, even investing early stage, at some point you need to be faced with a situation where like something becomes 2030, 40% of your book, what do you do?
01:00:08.484 - 01:00:23.156, Speaker A: Yeah, and, oh, I think where it gets really tough in crypto is, oh, not just in crypto but public hedge fund managers is when you're very public facing for that thing. So like Hashed Delphi for them to sell Luna because they're so public facing.
01:00:23.300 - 01:00:24.036, Speaker B: Absolutely.
01:00:24.180 - 01:00:26.700, Speaker A: Their marketing and their brand. Yeah, yeah.
01:00:26.812 - 01:01:03.556, Speaker B: It is really hard. Managing risk is like I like to tell founders, say, listen, I need to manage risk and rotate capital into my strategy, which is private. But once you go public and your worth, it's like, I'm trying to make at least a ten x and I need to believe that I can make a ten to 50 to 100 x on an investment. If something's already trading at a couple billion, it's very difficult for that to deliver more than that. And so statistically speaking, just tell founders, look, I need a harvest. Like at some point you need to take profit, it's okay. Like, you know, Hodling is fine.
01:01:03.556 - 01:01:33.764, Speaker B: And we hear these crazy stories of people like hodling a bunch of bitcoin and Ethan just, you know, become like what they are now. Like, that's great, but every strategy is different. So, like, I think you need to take profits along the way. Generally speaking, you want to be selling when there's a lot of euphoria in the market, which makes me really uneasy. Like, I wake up in the middle of the night, I'm like, it is crazy that something's going up. The market just felt like it was going up and up and I'm, you're like, at some point, it's like an earthquake. This is what I was worrying for a long time.
01:01:33.764 - 01:01:40.644, Speaker B: And one of my worst trades was like, shorting. Was like, shorty.
01:01:40.684 - 01:01:40.932, Speaker A: Oh, no.
01:01:40.948 - 01:01:56.676, Speaker B: I was going long interest rates in, like, 2014. Like, I felt like interest rates are like, it can't go lower than this. And then, of course, it goes negative. I'm like, it was. I went, like, tripled, triple levered, like, ETF. Like, long interest rates. Man, did I get blown out there.
01:01:56.676 - 01:02:31.214, Speaker B: Like, it was a terrible trade. I just didn't realize that this party could keep going for so long. And it's sort of like nature, I think, offers a lot of cues into designing protocols, designing companies. I always like to read, like, biology and, like, understand how nature works, because nature offers a blueprint to designing things that are probably more sustainable, because it's sort of like a very beautiful design that has order. There's chaos, but there's also order. Self ordering systems, I think, are the ones that end up surviving in this kind of adversarial state. Otherwise there's entropy.
01:02:31.214 - 01:02:59.478, Speaker B: And in markets, it's like earthquakes. The longer that an earthquake doesn't, the longer there's that time passes and there's been no earthquake. It's sort of like this idea that, like, there's going to be a stronger magnitude earthquake. You almost want to have, like, tension be released over time, right? As opposed to these tectonic plates, like, not releasing a lot of that tension. No, I'm not a bio, I'm not, like, a genius.
01:02:59.566 - 01:03:19.614, Speaker A: Here's your, here's your nature analogy. I'll throw it at you. If we're sticking on this theme. Bear markets are like forest fires, right? Forest fires rip, rip through. They kill, like, 90% of things in their way, but the 10% of things that are left end up getting built much stronger, and that's, that's what we see in the bear market. So anyways, man, I think that's a good time to call it.
01:03:20.234 - 01:03:23.934, Speaker B: Hopefully you're, hopefully we're all in that 10% and you don't get burned.
01:03:24.354 - 01:03:28.858, Speaker A: Don't get burned. Put on your, put on your fire suit and survive. Survive.
01:03:28.906 - 01:03:44.058, Speaker B: Stay healthy. It's important to, you know, if you need help. It's painful. Everyone that has been long innovation is hurting. Know that and reach out to people. If you're really in a bad spot, reach out to people. There's never, you know, it's never too late.
01:03:44.058 - 01:03:57.094, Speaker B: And listen, we've all been in situations where it's not fun to see your net worth collapse. 80%, 50%. It's not fun. But that's the name of the game. You either learn to love it or you go and invest in bonds and, you know, call it a day.
01:03:57.594 - 01:04:13.696, Speaker A: Don't invest in bonds. Keep, keep. Stay interested in crypto. I do have to make a call out. It feels weird. Call out this right after you make that heartfelt comment there. But we are sitting at 88 reviews on Apple and 85 reviews on Spotify.
01:04:13.696 - 01:04:39.178, Speaker A: So we're twelve away on Apple from 100. We're 15 away from Spotify. If you've made it an hour into the episode, please stop what you're doing before jumping into your next podcast, before going back to the computer. If you're on Spotify, we need 15 reviews. If you're on Apple, we need twelve. Give us a five star review and then we are also releasing a lot of the panels from permissionless on our YouTube, so we'll drop the link in the show notes. Chris Dixon Hasoo did one on Mev that was really, really good.
01:04:39.178 - 01:04:48.042, Speaker A: You can go over to the YouTube channel and subscribe. So anyways, we'll see you next week. We've got some really good episodes coming out. And as always, thanks for listening and santee be well, my friend.
01:04:48.138 - 01:04:50.274, Speaker B: Thank you guys. Stay safe out there. We'll see you next week.
