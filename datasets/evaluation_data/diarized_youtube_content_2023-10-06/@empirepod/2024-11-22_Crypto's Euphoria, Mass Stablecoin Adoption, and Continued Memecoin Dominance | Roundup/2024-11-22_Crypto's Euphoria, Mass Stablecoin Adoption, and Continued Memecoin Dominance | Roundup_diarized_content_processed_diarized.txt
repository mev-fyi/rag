00:00:00.360 - 00:00:25.425, Speaker A: I think that I'm earlier in this industry than I was a decade ago for the simple reason that a decade ago it was let's become digital gold, it's 10 trillion. And what is both daunting, exciting, but also really amazing is that the aperture has opened up in a way that things are working. I don't think that triggers euphoria. That triggers like a, like sort of sits on you, it takes a while and then you're like oh fuck, like.
00:00:25.465 - 00:00:52.585, Speaker B: Legislation comes, banks start holding, banks start issuing, tech companies start issuing US dollar maintains global reserve status as we basically figure out how to export dollars to the entire world. And so that was just biggest takeaway from that from the Multi Coin Summit was like I think people are grossly underestimating. I think people think that there's like oh, stablecoin bubble on Twitter and people are talking about that. We're like inning. We're not. The game hasn't even started for.
00:00:52.745 - 00:00:55.135, Speaker A: Exactly, absolutely. It's a speck of dust.

00:03:03.175 - 00:03:17.871, Speaker B: Ah, man. Yeah, put on, put on your podcast face. All right, what's up everyone? We've. We've got the roundup this week. Been a bit of an odd week. I feel like vibes are, like, vibes are not as high as they should be. With Bitcoin hitting 98k, I don't know.
00:03:17.943 - 00:03:19.355, Speaker C: Trump did some cool stuff.
00:03:19.935 - 00:03:27.311, Speaker B: AI agents options went live. Some stablecoin stuff. I don't know what's up, Santi?
00:03:27.463 - 00:03:33.239, Speaker A: I feel like the vibes are. Well, I tweeted about this yesterday. The market doesn't feel euphoric at all.
00:03:33.407 - 00:03:37.127, Speaker B: Yeah, let's talk about that. Why do you think that is?
00:03:37.231 - 00:04:18.905, Speaker A: Yeah, the way I think about it is when you believe in something and it happens, it doesn't create euphoria. Euphoria happens when something that you don't believe in happens or that you hadn't considered. And I think, you know, if you're still here, like, it's been a difficult couple of years and so whether you've been investing in bitcoin, but like something like Solana is, I think 5% off, its all time high. I was at the multicoin conference. You were there too. I think it's the people that are still here really believe in the technology. You've sort of been hardened by difficult times and so you're not euphoric because if you're still here, you believe it, you fully understand the potential.
00:04:18.905 - 00:04:54.529, Speaker A: From my perspective, I have said this many times. I think that I'm earlier in this industry than I was a decade ago for the simple reason that a decade ago it was, let's become digital gold. It's 10 trillion. And what is both daunting, exciting, but also really amazing is that the aperture has opened up in a way that things are working. And not only that, but a lot of the obstacles and the oppression has been cleared with this incoming administration. And so you're. It's almost like a deep sense of appreciation and excitement, but not euphoria in that.
00:04:54.529 - 00:05:17.783, Speaker A: Okay, now we have a really good shot at scaling this now it's really on us to get this to where we want it to. And that's. I don't think that triggers euphoria. That triggers like a, like sort of sits on you, it takes a while and then you're like, oh, fuck. And. And I've been thinking about that a lot, obviously with what I'm doing, but also just as the industry as a whole.
00:05:17.919 - 00:05:45.841, Speaker B: Yeah, I have a different take, actually. I think you are right. So it's not a but it's an and it's. Meme coins have been great for some reasons because a lot of people have made a lot of money and actually a group of people who usually doesn't get to make a lot of money, I would say has made a lot of money. And that's been a really net positive. The negative is that I think it sucked the air out of a lot of the rest of the industry. Right.
00:05:45.841 - 00:06:26.963, Speaker B: As a, you know, like crypto kind of has worked the same way that tech has worked in that it's a very venture backed industry and it's predicated on the venture deals actually working and making a lot of money. And for the last 10 years they did, right? They were working. You know, you would Invest in an L1 or an L2 or an app like Uniswap and then it would go live at a valuation higher than the last round. And the system was really working. And there was like the majors and then there were the alts, right. There was the defi tokens and things like that. And the downside of having these meme coins going parabolic is that it sucked the air and the energy out of, out of the rest of the industry.
00:06:26.963 - 00:06:42.827, Speaker B: And in crypto, price drives narrative. And so even like as prepping for this podcast for a little bit and I was like, what are we talking about this week? Trump did some cool things like there were some AI agents, but really those are just meme coins right now. Like some microstrategy went up more than.
00:06:42.851 - 00:06:44.055, Speaker C: It did last week.
00:06:44.955 - 00:06:58.905, Speaker B: So there's no narratives right now and there's no things that the industry is kind of holding on to as like, oh, this is what the exciting new thing is. And so I think that's driven some of the vibe not being as high as it could be.
00:06:59.565 - 00:07:45.411, Speaker A: I agree with you with that and I still think, you know, let me ask you a question. Like, I think a lot of we'd like to talk about narratives in this podcast, but do we need. I feel like we're in constant search of narratives when we already know a lot of things. And so like, are we, are we in a place where like, I don't think we have an identity crisis. I don't think we need to find more narratives. I could go back to when I was first investing in Defi, before it was a term and I could have told you we just stopped innovating if we just stayed at stablecoins and Bitcoin. Even today that's a thesis enough for this space to meaningfully grow.
00:07:45.411 - 00:08:10.655, Speaker A: You know what I mean? It's still a speck of dust. Like yeah, we're getting traction with stablecoins. There's 7 trillion being settled on stablecoins. A lot of that is speculative and a lot of the reports that I've seen, businesses are still not using stablecoin. But you have PayPal and Stripe really appreciating how it can, can transform what they're doing. We don't need to boil the ocean. We don't need a hundred narratives to justify the existence of the space.
00:08:10.655 - 00:08:44.743, Speaker A: Like people that are not in crypto are just beginning to appreciate that narrative and how explosive that is. And oh by the way, for them that's massive. And so we like to bring on people here. Talk about at the cutting edge of blockchain and you know, fully homomorphic encryptions. I mean like a lot of really cool use cases will be opened up. The non skeuomorphic, totally new what's, you know. You know, I mean, but we don't need to justify, we don't need to create a hundred narratives.
00:08:44.743 - 00:08:54.035, Speaker A: I think we just need to double down on the, on the things that are working and that alone is enough to push this space an order of magnitude or 2.
00:08:54.335 - 00:09:35.467, Speaker B: Yeah, I would agree with you except that narrative narratives are more important, important than people realize for directing capital, but also human capital. So let's, let's take like a real world example of like a person, right? If you are a founder and you want to go build something, do you think it's more. Let's say there was a massive stablecoin narrative happening today or a massive like DeFi 2.0 DeFi Renaissance narrative happening today. That founder is going to go build in Defi or they're going to go build in stablecoins today. What's happening? I mean I have a really smart friend, he, I'll put quotes around this because he should be building a company on chain. Instead he just decided to launch a Meme Coin fund now.
00:09:35.571 - 00:09:36.695, Speaker A: Meme Coin Fund.
00:09:38.375 - 00:09:40.711, Speaker B: Now that, that's the third really smart.
00:09:40.743 - 00:09:41.959, Speaker C: Person I've seen in the last four.
00:09:42.007 - 00:09:56.159, Speaker B: Weeks launching a Meme Coin fund. Is that better or worse for society? I'm not here to tell you it's not the most productive use of your time. I'm sure he'll make a boatload of money. However, would that. That person's a phenomenal engineer.
00:09:56.327 - 00:09:58.791, Speaker C: Really gets crypto, really gets how capital markets work.
00:09:58.863 - 00:10:08.157, Speaker B: I would love to see that person go to try to build a big business. But because there's no narratives, he's like, I just don't know what I'd go build right now. Like, I don't know. It seems like the money's in the meme Coin.
00:10:08.311 - 00:10:09.805, Speaker A: You think he's a good builder?
00:10:11.145 - 00:10:18.729, Speaker B: Yeah, I think he's a great builder. I think he's a great builder. But he just sees the risk reward right now is like, look, I could go build something.
00:10:18.777 - 00:10:20.201, Speaker C: It's really freaking hard.
00:10:20.393 - 00:10:23.569, Speaker B: But on the other side, I could go launch a Meme Coin fund.
00:10:23.617 - 00:10:25.033, Speaker C: People, he's doing no fee.
00:10:25.089 - 00:10:37.145, Speaker B: No fee. So it's like, I think 0 and 25. So he's like, yeah, I'll just get people to give me money because people know that I'm smart and I'll go make some money, and that's how I'll ride out the cycle. And boom, we just lost a great company.
00:10:38.365 - 00:11:04.161, Speaker A: Well, if I were to meet him, I'd ask him. Smart people don't necessarily make money. I do appreciate narratives drive a lot of interest and speculation, and speculative drive is super important for adoption and capital market formation. I'm not dismissive of the value of narratives. I just think some of the best builders are obsessed with an idea, and they counter sort of the mainstream consensus. Like, you know, you really. You want to build that transformation.
00:11:04.193 - 00:11:06.725, Speaker B: That's a really good point. If he was really a good girl.
00:11:07.545 - 00:11:11.665, Speaker A: Why am I doing this thing that I'm doing? Do I need to do it? Absolutely not. Can I just chill in the horizon?
00:11:11.705 - 00:11:12.537, Speaker B: Just. That's a good point.
00:11:12.601 - 00:11:23.209, Speaker A: All my life. Yeah, but you just. One day, you wake up and you. And you say, I couldn't live with myself not doing this. I don't care if other people don't see it. I see it. And that's enough for me to go one speed, full speed, and that's it.
00:11:23.209 - 00:11:46.897, Speaker A: The people want to. I know that at some point, like, I. The best people that I've come across just are like that. And Will and I on the other side, when I meet them, I. I sense that they're gonna do everything in their power to make it and will it into existence. And they will just literally not stop. And then, of course, they control costs.
00:11:46.897 - 00:12:01.185, Speaker A: They raise enough money to be able to execute. I'm not saying that starting a meme coin fund is not, to your point, going to be successful. Good for him. Great. All the success. But is that really going to drive you?
00:12:01.925 - 00:12:06.461, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a good. That's a. That's a very valid point. Is he really the builder that would have built something big?
00:12:06.493 - 00:12:14.853, Speaker A: If I'm starting to question if he's that good of a. Of a builder or that's okay. Person. I'm not. I would like to break. Maybe he should come on the pod and we can just.
00:12:14.949 - 00:12:23.661, Speaker B: I was gonna say my friend without big on. My friend. Too much, maybe. Let's zoom. Zoom out from that. I'd be curious. You know, right now it's like bitcoin is ripping.
00:12:23.661 - 00:12:32.413, Speaker B: Bitcoin's. I don't know the price. It's like 98k, I think, or 97 or something like that. And the meme coins are going up. Salon is going up. And really, nothing else is going up. And it's.
00:12:32.413 - 00:12:47.165, Speaker B: We're now going on, like, month seven of this dynamic, basically. And so I'd be curious how you're thinking about maybe what 2025 could look like. I know you've, you know, vocally been. Very. Obviously, everyone knows who listens to Empire. Like, Bearish Eth. Bullish Solana.
00:12:47.165 - 00:12:53.565, Speaker B: You're right. Well, you know, pat you on the head for that. No, I know, but. No, I know.
00:12:53.645 - 00:12:57.825, Speaker A: Just look at my portfolio and I'll be fine. I don't say thanks or whatever.
00:12:59.085 - 00:13:06.037, Speaker B: You're like, you know who. You know who you're. You see the naive Bukele Instagram story. Oh, yeah, yeah.
00:13:06.061 - 00:13:08.901, Speaker A: Because he made $100 million in the trade. He's like, we are right.
00:13:09.053 - 00:13:10.773, Speaker B: This is. This is amazing. Hold on. I told you.
00:13:10.789 - 00:13:11.989, Speaker A: So he said, right?
00:13:12.037 - 00:13:23.975, Speaker B: He said, no. He didn't even say that. It's just A screenshot of $573 million in his portfolio. Total profit of 300 million. And he just sent the portfolio chart with two kissy faces.
00:13:26.435 - 00:13:27.251, Speaker A: Love it.
00:13:27.363 - 00:13:56.391, Speaker B: Love it. Okay, so what do you think? About what? So I think the big question on people's mind this week has been, like, you know, a couple weeks ago, people were calling for, like, btc, ETH is at the lows, but it keep. Or eth BTC is at the lows. It keeps going lower. So I'm curious to your current framework on, like, ETH and maybe more importantly less about eth, but more importantly about just the alts and defi tokens and depin tokens and that kind of stuff. I don't know if you have current thoughts on this.
00:13:56.503 - 00:14:21.065, Speaker A: I'll answer the question. Telling you what I did last year. I don't like to adjust my portfolio or thinking just because things reacting to the market necessarily. I do pay attention to it constantly but. And it serves as a. As an impetus to update my thesis. Like hey, what am I missing here on the meme coin stuff? For me it was like, okay, I'm certainly missing something here.
00:14:21.065 - 00:14:46.445, Speaker A: People, you know, and you update your thesis but with something like Solana and how. I. I think I did a very drastic change in my portfolio. I don't known any L1 like eth other than to pay gas to like claim some positions that are vesting. But other than that I don't own any eth. Very little bitcoin and so. But.
00:14:46.445 - 00:15:13.227, Speaker A: But the ETH one is for me, like I was willing to do that drastic of a change in my portfolio because it. I was processing the thesis for Solana and then high throughput chains and it took. Took me a bit. Was I super early on it? No. Did I catch Solana? The absolute peak of bottom? No, but I'm okay with that because I have a. My thesis is that Solana flips Ethereum and then. And then some and then.
00:15:13.227 - 00:15:25.115, Speaker A: So I'm willing to hold that and I'm going to just see that through. So I don't necessarily. Like, I'm not. This calendar year re. Underwriting makes no sense to me. Like what am I. I know.
00:15:25.115 - 00:15:30.155, Speaker A: Allocators. Institutional allocators. Like let's sit. What is that? And we do predictions here for the.
00:15:30.195 - 00:15:31.685, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, it's it.
00:15:31.805 - 00:15:44.305, Speaker A: We gotta do them. I get it. But gotta do them from my standpoint, I'm like, I'm not doing them. I'm. I'm like, okay, I just. I'm holding to the thesis. I don't see anything that will invalidate it.
00:15:44.305 - 00:15:52.541, Speaker A: And that's it. Like if I make. If I make more money on stuff that I've done on the venture side, I'll just rotate into more Solana.
00:15:52.693 - 00:16:03.625, Speaker B: So. So then let me ask you this. Can the alt. Okay, without talking about Solana, can the altcoins move? Like can. Can like Ave and Maker.
00:16:03.785 - 00:16:09.449, Speaker A: I'll give the answer that. Yes, I'll give the answer that the audience wants to hear. Then I'll entertain the exercise.
00:16:09.537 - 00:16:09.777, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:16:09.801 - 00:16:31.363, Speaker A: What's going to Happen. Go listen to the episode of Eric Peters along the way there. He says something that is true. Institutions huddle up at the end of the year and say, where are we going to put our money? We just had the election. Crypto is in flavor now. Every fund that you talk to is getting inbound. The institutions don't move as fast.
00:16:31.363 - 00:16:34.899, Speaker A: It takes one or Eric said it, one or two quarters for them to update.
00:16:34.947 - 00:16:35.107, Speaker B: Right.
00:16:35.131 - 00:17:12.165, Speaker A: They're going to go in there, they're going to say we should allocate more to bitcoin crypto. How can we express that view? They're going to do a couple of things. They might buy the etf, they might also allocate the crypto funds. And then that liquidity takes a couple of cycles to play through. Absent anything major on the geopolitical side of things, you have a very, I think a really good setup for the space. Like liquidity will come in and liquidity flows. And then so it doesn't take much to drive a lot of these assets, which you're right, Solana Bitcoin are hitting all time highs.
00:17:12.165 - 00:17:58.535, Speaker A: Meme coins are just all the rage right now. Most of the other stuff is still well, well below their all time highs. And so the question is, where do you want to allocate your money? How do you want to play that? How many, how far on the risk spectrum? And from a portfolio construction standpoint, what are the funds like you're inviting saying, where are the people going to deploy their money? Are they going to continue to do the trade of Solana Eth and looking at that chart or are they going to punt out? I think the correct assumption is people are going to go farther on the risk spectrum as things bitcoin continues to rally. I could see it go up to 120 before the end of the year. Then all of a sudden it's like, all right, well let's. If that holds, then people are going to punt. At some point ETH is going to come out on favor.
00:17:58.535 - 00:18:32.265, Speaker A: You know, the flows into the ETF are going to be strong and then, you know, like everything catches a bit in a bull market is what I'm trying to say. And I think we are in that situation right now. Just everything you're seeing on bitcoin, Bitcoin historically is led. But so, yeah, like what outperforms is maybe the more interesting question. Like what on a relative basis does well on a year time frame, kind of really impossible. Much, much more impossible in a shorter time frame. On a multiple year time frame.
00:18:32.265 - 00:18:34.817, Speaker A: I'll tell you with a lot of conviction what I'm doing.
00:18:34.881 - 00:19:17.057, Speaker B: But yeah, so will we get. So here, let me pull up this. We did this story with I think it was hash key put this out. It was like outlines the three, like kind of 2013, 2014 alt season, 2017-2018 alt season, 2020, 2021 alt season and like basically where bitcoin dominance was at for those. What were the catalysts? What, what were the key events? We can, we can link in the show notes to, to the story. When. If you just compare the alts to meme coins in this cycle, what do you think? Like in the last cycle, retail pushed farther out on the risk spectrum and started buying things like compound and aave and uni and things like that.
00:19:17.057 - 00:19:38.355, Speaker B: And then they pushed even farther out and bought bought the NFTs. We're skipping steps in this cycle, it feels like. And people are kind of saying, oh, I know how the cycle is going to go. Let me just go straight to meme coins. So one thing I have zero conviction on is will the alts ever get bid or is it just. It's a meme coin cycle because people know how the game plays so they're trying to skip to the end.
00:19:39.695 - 00:19:47.235, Speaker A: That was great question. I don't know. What do you think? It's already happening, right? People have totally skipped the.
00:19:47.815 - 00:19:50.447, Speaker B: It's like, you know that strictly speaking, alt.
00:19:50.471 - 00:19:54.079, Speaker A: Yeah, they've skipped them. They've gone straight to me now. TikTok meta is all the rage.
00:19:54.127 - 00:20:25.471, Speaker B: And yeah, it's like my friend who texted me last week that we were talking about on the. I think we were talking about her texts with me on the podcast last week. She didn't say, hey, you know, I want to buy bitcoin or like one of the majors and I want to buy like one of the real businesses built on chains. She said, give me should I buy Bitcoin, Ether, Solana and should I what Meme coin should I buy? Yeah, right. Yeah, it's like the bell curve that you buy something at the right side, you buy something on the left side, you don't buy something in the middle.
00:20:25.543 - 00:21:03.345, Speaker A: So yeah, I think like the right side part of your brain or the right side would be what are the best assets like bitcoin if you're going to hold Solana Eth while you can come to your conclusion. And then extreme barbell strategies. I think how the market just does operate, not just in crypto but traditional too. It's like I'm going to hold something stable Quality. And then I'm going to go really left curve. Kind of the Family feud style of investing, which is, it doesn't matter what I think, it's what other people are going to do. And then you just kind of operate like that or allocate like that.
00:21:03.345 - 00:21:39.071, Speaker A: The issue though, I don't know, like this meme coin stuff is certainly surpassed my expectations. It's just the meta is so quickly, rapidly evolving. I think Xiao or Darren or someone down Lao said like, wait a minute. Historically it was like institutions dumping on retail. Now retail is dumping on institutions or, or not. And also like newcomers, right? A lot of these people that like, if you're not on TikTok, you're at a material disadvantage, like an asset selection for meme coins, Something like that.
00:21:39.183 - 00:22:04.881, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, I'm pulling up the picture of that kid. Did you see the kid this week who Rugged? He launched. Oh my God, I gotta find the picture of this kid. He, he created a meme coin and then it went to like he made like 30k in Seoul and Rugged. And then people found out who he was and like saw this video of him rugging and being like, he's like 15 year old kid. He's like flipping off the camera and then he, oh my God, you got. I got.
00:22:04.881 - 00:22:32.889, Speaker B: I'm gonna send this to you afterwards. It's freaking hilarious. And then people sent his meme coin skyrocketing and he would have had like 5 million bucks. So I don't know. Funny, funny video. Any takeaways from the multicoin summit, by the way? Shout out to the multicoin folks. I saw a, I saw, I saw a thread on Twitter which was like, whose opinion do you trust or do you, do you trust this person's opinion or something? And it was all these like people and I think it was posted by like a very big eth.
00:22:32.889 - 00:23:05.057, Speaker B: Person like croissant or bread or. Yeah, I forget who posted it, but it was like Kyle, Kyle from multicoin. It was like 80% don't trust. And the thing that I think people nobody realizes on Twitter right now is that multicoin is actually probably one of the only mega funds that has actually outperformed bitcoin when a lot of the other mega funds have honestly just underperformed bitcoin. So I don't know, just wanted to shout out the multicoin folks. I thought it was a really good summit. I don't know if it was like an off the record summit.
00:23:05.057 - 00:23:10.473, Speaker B: So I don't know. Can't share too much from it obviously but any just generalized takeaways I was.
00:23:10.489 - 00:23:19.819, Speaker A: Catching for them because I went to I think their first summit in2017 or 16. 17. 17 or 18.
00:23:19.867 - 00:23:24.855, Speaker B: I forget it was like we hosted do you know Blockworks. We were desperate for money so they hired Blockworks.
00:23:25.555 - 00:23:26.779, Speaker A: Half Moon Bay.
00:23:26.947 - 00:23:35.499, Speaker B: No, the one after that in. Or maybe before in, in at Chipper. I think it was Cipriani in New York. Maybe a 2019 I think.
00:23:35.547 - 00:23:37.555, Speaker A: No, this was their first summit I believe.
00:23:37.715 - 00:23:38.147, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:23:38.211 - 00:24:14.745, Speaker A: And I was going back to that. I, when I first met Kyle I reached out to him because I thought his writing was very clear and compelling and it's not someone that is afraid to voice his opinions and he's a strong idea guy and he follows through and very high conviction. And I think the combination of Tushar and Kyle, if you know them or have met them or you can go listen to their podcast, they're, they're different. They're different in how they operate and think. But I think the combination is. Works very well. So my thesis when I gave them money back way back in the day for their hedge fund was these guys are going to capture something that I don't.
00:24:14.745 - 00:24:53.245, Speaker A: They're going to see thing. It's sort of a hedge against my, myself and it turned out to be very true. So I don't know like I, I really, I don't think they've had it easy after the FTX stuff. The constant question for Solana is very polarizing but he knows that and like I know he plays like Cunningham's Law also like you know this idea of like tweeting like getting a lot of information but like just staking an opinion that you know he really, I think he, he's smart in that way. So I thought, yeah, I mean so.
00:24:53.325 - 00:25:03.213, Speaker B: What is Cunningham's Law? Cunningham's Law is like the best way to get to an answer is to post a statement and people are going to tell you or it's you want to post the wrong answer and that will feed you the right answer.
00:25:03.349 - 00:25:11.337, Speaker A: Exactly like that. Like C's law states the best way to get to the right answer on the Internet is not to ask a question is to post the wr. Wrong answer.
00:25:11.441 - 00:25:12.097, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:25:12.241 - 00:25:38.451, Speaker A: So I think there's an element of that. So yeah like at the end of the day returns are all that matter and how you do like and so if you go talk to their portfolio companies, I think single handedly maybe the better poll is to ask that question last founders that they backed, they're there, they're in the trenches and that's all it really matters. That and, you know, outperforming.
00:25:38.643 - 00:26:01.575, Speaker B: Actually, I did a very informal survey of probably 25 founders. This was like end of last year, beginning of this year, because I was thinking about should we have a database basically of all the VCs and rank them and publicize it and decide not to do that? But yeah, actually multicoin ranked. It was Multicoin and Union Square Ventures were the two most helpful venture firms.
00:26:02.075 - 00:26:36.635, Speaker A: I think it will only become more important as the space has proliferated. A lot of the bigger funds or the biggest funds in the space started at a time where it was very much just ETH and Bitcoin. But eth, you didn't get paid or you didn't raise to allocate. The bitcoin you raised to allocate mostly to Ethereum. And the name implies multicoin. You know, they've gone out and they've, they've, they're very focused, I think. And that becomes, I think, more important as the space continues, as the aperture of the investable universe expands.
00:26:36.635 - 00:27:10.341, Speaker A: And it's equally valuable to understand the things that you want to invest in as much as the things you don't want to invest in. And so I think ultimately, I'm not suggesting that maybe generalized funds are not going to do well. Like you certainly could run a strategy like that, but. And multicoin has different vehicles, right? They have venture fund and liquid fund. That's, I think, more of a structural reason. And I would do it the same way. And I think a lot of other funds do it the same way just purely from a type of allocator perspective.
00:27:10.341 - 00:27:35.755, Speaker A: But at the core, I think they're more focused. Like at Parify, we were very focused on one idea. It was decentralized finance. Before it was a term, it was defi. Ben and I were of the opinion that decentralized finance is a killer use case. And we were seeing it because we're on chain. Looking at it was, I think in order to come up with big bold ideas, you have to focus on like key insights.
00:27:35.755 - 00:28:01.677, Speaker A: The insight that we had was looking at like stablecoin usage on chain and saying, wait a minute, it's actually cheaper to swap stable coins on chain, some like Curve than it is with Coinbase or Binance. And then seeing eth collapse 80% and maker die, which is backed by Ethan hold its peg, those two. I could tell you there's other things that we were observing and well, holding.
00:28:01.701 - 00:28:05.381, Speaker B: The peg almost did. I Think you guys played a good role in holding the peg, but.
00:28:05.533 - 00:28:08.613, Speaker A: Well, there was moments where it was tricky. That's. We, we, we.
00:28:08.709 - 00:28:11.061, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, you. You guys were in the trenches. You guys were in the trenches.
00:28:11.133 - 00:28:38.541, Speaker A: March, Black Thursday. We were non stop. I was on the phone for like 48 hours because there was a. Yeah, there was incredible chance of single at the time, Die was only backed by Eth. And our proposal was we have to expand collateral. And the hardcore Ethereum people were like ideologically saying, oh, you know, it's going to censorship, resistance and adding USDC as collateral is going to be really bad. I'm like, fine, keep you.
00:28:38.541 - 00:28:56.011, Speaker A: Do you want to die or do you want to survive? And it's. I find that people, like, think of risk in really binary terms. Risk is always. Risk is always a matter of probabilities in a spectrum. And very few people, I think, understand that. Anyways. Yeah, like we shout out to them.
00:28:56.011 - 00:29:25.985, Speaker A: I mean, I know they haven't. It's not like I told you so in many ways. Trump also had this tweet, actually maybe transitioning a little conversation a little more. He had something that I thought was really impressive. He said, I'm not out here to go and chase after the people that made my life very difficult. I'm actually willing to give him a second or third chance. I bet a lot of people didn't expect Trump to tweet that.
00:29:28.325 - 00:29:39.425, Speaker B: I mean, he did say that, but he also just sued the news companies for $10 billion. So he is holding a bit of a grudge. Just putting that out there.
00:29:40.405 - 00:29:44.609, Speaker A: I mean, okay, fine, I hear your point, but anyways.
00:29:44.737 - 00:29:46.925, Speaker B: Yeah, all right. I have one takeaway.
00:29:47.705 - 00:30:27.373, Speaker A: I think a more important thing is. Well, I'll be observing is as Solana reaches all time high, how does that community take that all in? And I know there's different factions within the community, but I don't think the right strategy would be to say, I told you so. We're 100%, we're here and we're the best. I actually think that what has made Solana so powerful is that. And in this multicoin conference, there's Raj there and Ivana told you. They've stuck to one really core idea, which is NASDAQ on the blockchain. Increase bandwidth, reduce latency.
00:30:27.373 - 00:30:45.439, Speaker A: Like two very core ideas. That doesn't mean that, by the way, there's other technology in crypto that can address other use cases beyond NASDAQ on the blockchain. Like, stand for something, but be very opinionated and understand the trade offs. That's what I tell every other project that I come across.
00:30:45.607 - 00:31:16.765, Speaker C: Yeah, scale is the blockchain that is simply built different. Let's face it, other L1 networks have costly transaction fees that increase as the network gets busier. Skale has solved this problem with a GAS free scalable infrastructure where users never pay gas fees. Skale was awarded the most active gaming chain in 2023 by CoinGecko and hosts five of the top 25 games on Dapp Radar. You should definitely check out Skale. I was using it the other day. It really is incredible to use.
00:31:16.765 - 00:32:02.133, Speaker C: That's Skale spelt with a K. Hit the link in the show notes or head on over to Scale Space Ecosystem to get started today hey everyone, Jason here. I wanted to quickly talk about Kronos zkevm, a next generation zero knowledge Layer two blockchain network focused on scalability, security and innovation. Secured by Ethereum. It further expands the Kronos ecosystem using ZKsync tech. Kronos ZKEVM has launched its Pioneer Program, offering early users loyalty points for engaging with Kronos ZKEVM and its dapps. Join the First Quest by depositing CRO in the Kronos ZKEVM bridge to receive Z, ZK CRO and Loyalty Points at mainnet launch.
00:32:02.133 - 00:32:11.581, Speaker C: And that's not all. In addition to receiving ZK CRO and loyalty points, you could also win part of a $30,000 ZK CRO giveaway by.
00:32:11.613 - 00:32:12.821, Speaker B: Depositing in the Bridge.
00:32:12.933 - 00:32:45.893, Speaker C: The more you deposit, the better your chances of winning. Visit zkevmdocronos.orgbridge for more info. Now let's get back to today's show. Are you a project founder struggling to pay your team in stables or even just giving them token grants? I've seen this issue firsthand throughout the space. Traditional payroll or EOR providers don't support crypto even if you wanted to do it yourself. It's really complicated to figure out all the tax withholdings, report to the IRS or any government and manage local filings.
00:32:45.893 - 00:33:19.239, Speaker C: Toku simplifies every part of global token compensation, everything from paying full time employees in stablecoins, issuing token grants to your team and investors, all in 100 countries on one platform. You can plug Toku into your existing payroll setup or even choose a fully managed service. No guesswork, no missed deadlines, no complexity. Reach out to their incredible team@toku.com or by hitting the link in the description of today's episode. Hey everyone, Jason here. I wanted to take a second to break down why Magic Eden is getting into token trading.
00:33:19.239 - 00:34:11.457, Speaker C: Their team is extremely concerned that crypto is still consolidated in the hands of a few centralized exchanges who act as gatekeepers, ultimately recreating the tradfi space. They believe that crypto is still missing in on chain binance and their aim is to move trading completely on chain, fully decentralized. They've done $6 billion in NFT volume in the last three years and have had more than 1.4 million users visit their platform in the past year, making them the number one NFT platform in the market today. They are the ones that can do it. Stay up to date with Magic Eden's journey by giving them a follow on X at Magic Eden earlier in today's episode, I mentioned Ledger's latest products, the Stacks and Flex, and I wanted to take a few seconds to tell you more about them. For Black Friday only, Ledger is offering $70 in Bitcoin.
00:34:11.457 - 00:34:41.665, Speaker C: If you upgrade to the Ledger Flex, you can also save up to 40% on selected ledger Nano wallets and accessories. These wallets are virtually impenetrable to online attacks because they store your private key in a secure offline chip. You can manage more than 5,500 tokens and install up to 100 apps. Offer is only valid until December 5 or while supplies last, so be sure to hit the link in the description of today's episode so you don't miss out on this really good deal.
00:34:43.445 - 00:34:49.345, Speaker B: Did you see the Solana roadmap website? I think Merck created it. It's just a just a blank page.
00:34:51.285 - 00:34:52.825, Speaker A: IBRL.
00:34:54.525 - 00:35:38.993, Speaker B: Just says increase bandwidth, reduced latency. All right, so I had one takeaway from the Multicoin summit, so there's that. Kyle had a great chat with Senator Hagerty and without sharing too much of the details, it does sound like a positive stablecoin legislation is going to come. I'm now on your page that the stripe acquisition of Bridge is an Instagram moment. I was like I wasn't as convicted as you were at the time but I now after hearing Hagerty speak so I do so here's what I think will happen in stablecoins is I think we're going to see positive legislation come out in January. I don't know if this means approval or like Bill starting to get really proposed and pushed forward but like Something in early 2025 Good stablecoin legislation will happen. Once that happens, we're going to see the banks get comfortable holding stablecoins.
00:35:38.993 - 00:36:36.665, Speaker B: Once the banks get comfortable holding stablecoins we're going to see the banks start actually issuing stablecoins as they see how much money folks like Tether and Circle are actually making. After that, the tech companies, I think, are going to see how much money the banks are making by issuing stablecoins and they're going to say, whoa, wait, we've got the relationship with the users, not the banks anymore. And so I think you'll start to see one prediction that I'll probably end up having is Twitter, Facebook, you know, WhatsApp, I guess that's one company telegram. They're all going to launch their own stablecoins. And I think there's this domino effect of like legislation comes. Banks start holding, banks start issuing, tech companies start issuing US Dollar maintains global reserve status as we basically figure out how to export dollars to the entire world. And so that was just biggest takeaway from that, from the multicoin summit was like, I think people are grossly underestimating.
00:36:36.665 - 00:36:44.551, Speaker B: I think people think that there's like, oh, stablecoin bubble on Twitter and people are talking about that. We're like, inning. We're not. The game hasn't even started for stablecoin.
00:36:44.623 - 00:37:26.925, Speaker A: Exactly. Absolutely. It's a speck of dust. Yeah. No, it's like, why wouldn't you want to have increased dollar reserves, like status and demand for dollars worldwide? The question that, yeah, it'll be interesting. I'm not like an expert on legislation, how long in the process, but some people, most of the smarter people, like, of what I've heard, like, that takes time, like multiple years. It's more of a question, can you get it through in the next four years? But yeah, maybe we love to have someone come on and really kind of lay out different scenarios of the most aggressive case.
00:37:26.925 - 00:37:35.469, Speaker A: The more like had how it has historically been done. And then, yeah, you know, because I.
00:37:35.477 - 00:37:50.745, Speaker B: Think there's, I think there's two main bills right now, which is one is the Lummis Gillibrand Payment stablecoin Act. This was, this was introduced in April. So it's bipartisan. Right. Gillibrand is Democrat. Lummis is obviously Republican. And then there's the.
00:37:50.745 - 00:38:22.161, Speaker B: Who's the guy who's retiring. McHenry and Hagerty proposed the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act a couple months ago. And then I think you had the House Financial services. It was McHenry and Maxine Waters are also working on a bipartisan stablecoin bill. So I don't know whose bills it's going to be. I don't know the process, but I think there's three, two to three bills and I think something will get, we'll go through, right? Yeah, hopefully.
00:38:22.193 - 00:38:28.085, Speaker A: Yeah. Like when you say go through in the, like you're saying the next four years or the next year or like what's the timeline?
00:38:28.605 - 00:39:16.025, Speaker B: Well, I guess you could, the most optimistic is that a stablecoin legislation passes during the lame duck period of Congress coming up. But I think the, yeah, the, I mean the, the timing and likelihood of that are pretty low, I would say. I think, you know, there's regulatory pressure from folks like the, you know, Yellen, the Treasury secretary and then federal banking regulators and that's obviously going to flip come, come January. Once, once Trump is running the country then you've got, but I think you'll just have like real strong global competition that ends up forcing this through and people will realize. I also think governments have historically underestimated the power of crypto in keeping them, what's the right word here? Solvent. No. Yeah.
00:39:16.025 - 00:39:25.585, Speaker B: Honestly, I don't know. I think stablecoin providers are going to become the buyer of last resort for these, for these bonds. Yeah.
00:39:27.445 - 00:39:58.047, Speaker A: We talked about in the episode with Eric. Historically you had to dance around from a policy standpoint with China because they were such an important buyer treasuries. But when tether imagine a world where collectively the stablecoin issuers like tether become surpassed China, well, you're going to have to negotiate with or at least take care of that contingent. And I would argue it'd be easier to negotiate with that type of contingent than it has been with China.
00:39:58.191 - 00:40:11.903, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I'm way out of my depth in talking about this but like if the treasure, the, if the treasury market, you stop having demand in that market, the yields start to go exponential. And who's keeping these yields from going exponential? I mean, could be the stable coins.
00:40:11.999 - 00:40:18.443, Speaker A: So yeah, depends on the paper you buy and the shape of the curve and all this like short term blocking. But yes.
00:40:18.599 - 00:40:19.363, Speaker B: I don't know.
00:40:19.499 - 00:40:22.495, Speaker A: Jordy from Salini, if you're listening, you.
00:40:23.035 - 00:41:08.461, Speaker B: What I, what I do know is that bullish week for, for Trump and crypto. So maybe just to give a highlight of some of the things that happened. And the reason, by the way, that I think these things are actually important is because there are a lot of people saying, hey look, if Trump gets elected, will he actually hold his promise of like being pro crypto? And a lot of people said, look, he won't actually be pro crypto. He's just telling you idiots this so you'll give him money and then he's going to rug you. And I think this week was actually a pretty clear indication that he will be pro crypto. So a few things happen. One is he met with Brian Armstrong and you could say this is just a meeting, but I think this is important because the last administration, I mean you could give him, you give them 50 million bucks in donations and they wouldn't, they wouldn't schedule a 30 minute meeting with you.
00:41:08.461 - 00:41:47.751, Speaker B: It was impossible to get a meeting with with Biden, impossible to get a meeting with Warren, impossible to get a meeting even by the end with Gensler. So this Ryan meeting I think was pretty important. Two was he announced that he is appointing a crypto czar within the White House. This person's quote, going to be armed with a small staff and tasked with serving as a liaison between financial regulators, Congress and the White House on crypto policy. And then third is Howard Lutnick is getting a key role. We already kind of knew that. And the fourth, which is the craziest one obviously is Truth Social, which Trump obviously has a huge stake in is entertaining or late stages to buy Bakkt.
00:41:47.751 - 00:41:56.583, Speaker B: And new crypto people might not know what Bakkt is, but Bakkt was like the exchange, the darling of zero volume.
00:41:56.719 - 00:41:57.823, Speaker C: Yeah, the darling.
00:41:57.919 - 00:42:34.089, Speaker B: So there's this company called International, International Continental Exchange, ice, they own the New York Stock Exchange and a myriad of other exchanges and market infrastructure companies. They launched this company called Bakkt originally as a custodian, institutional custodian. And then they layered on an exchange and it, it, I mean it just has done absolutely nothing. They went, basically they went public, but the stock is trading at next to nothing. They, I think I thought they went bankrupt, honestly, I thought they were out of business. I think they've been trying to sell this thing for years. But yeah.
00:42:34.217 - 00:42:45.257, Speaker A: Has volume not done anything really? I mean I know the first week was like Even the shittiest AMM in Tier 4 chain was doing more volume than back.
00:42:45.321 - 00:42:59.545, Speaker B: But I mean, here you go, I'll show you the. Here's the chart. So yeah, I'm not talking about the stock price, I'm talking about the volume of back.
00:42:59.585 - 00:43:04.333, Speaker A: Yeah, like the actual volume back and comparing it against, you know, other, other players.
00:43:04.429 - 00:43:11.613, Speaker B: I don't even know if they're big enough to get. Can you get volumes? Oh yeah, I guess they're public. So yeah, yeah, but I think you.
00:43:11.629 - 00:43:12.381, Speaker A: Might be able to see it.
00:43:12.413 - 00:43:22.957, Speaker B: But. All right, this is a week, this is a week ago, 200 yeah, I mean, 165 million.
00:43:23.021 - 00:43:27.365, Speaker A: 165 million in 12 days. That's just November alone.
00:43:27.525 - 00:43:30.411, Speaker B: No, no, this is 165 million in October.
00:43:30.573 - 00:43:37.111, Speaker A: That's what Binance does with a. You know, in hours. Right. With a shitty asset.
00:43:37.223 - 00:43:37.915, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:43:39.735 - 00:43:54.315, Speaker A: So, anywho, like, you know, let's look at here. I'm looking at Coingecko Markets. Solana. Just solana alone does 2 billion in volume on Binance.
00:43:55.895 - 00:43:57.105, Speaker B: A month?
00:43:57.295 - 00:43:58.093, Speaker A: No, a day.
00:43:58.149 - 00:43:59.181, Speaker B: A day, right. Yeah.
00:43:59.253 - 00:43:59.985, Speaker A: Of course.
00:44:00.965 - 00:44:02.745, Speaker B: These back numbers were a month.
00:44:03.205 - 00:44:16.701, Speaker A: Let's pick Goat, which is. Talk about AI and all the rage there. So, okay, markets. Gate.IO has done $68 million in volume in the last 24 hours.
00:44:16.773 - 00:44:17.925, Speaker B: Don't sleep on gate.
00:44:18.085 - 00:44:31.085, Speaker A: Don't sleep on gate. Yeah. Well, I must say, some of this volume is a bit. But you can feel good about, like, I guess, radium. Yeah. Well, yeah, okay.
00:44:31.865 - 00:44:35.273, Speaker B: Radium's volume. You see radium's volumes past Uniswap's volumes.
00:44:35.449 - 00:44:47.113, Speaker A: Radium, Yeah. I was looking at radium last couple of days. I'm like, that could have been a. I missed it. I'm like, out of curiosity. I was like, well, most of the volume. Because when you go and trade on Jupiter, like, a lot of you see where it's being routed.
00:44:47.113 - 00:44:52.419, Speaker A: I'm like, oh. Like, I was seeing, like, radium. And I'm like, I'm an idiot. I could have, like, traded radium when I was buying all these memes.
00:44:52.467 - 00:45:03.883, Speaker B: So radium. Talk about a partnership deal. Radium. Pumped off fund, deciding to integrate with radium. I mean, that's so. So radium. Radium did 5 billion in weekly volume last week.
00:45:03.883 - 00:45:23.025, Speaker B: Compare that to Uniswap 3.5 billion. I actually think there's an interesting takeaway here of. So Uniswap is deployed on 23 different chains. Radium is only on Solana. There's an interesting strategy of, like, does it really make sense to go super multichain? I guess this is more just Solana. Mutant coins are ripping.
00:45:23.025 - 00:45:52.349, Speaker B: Don't look too. Don't look into it too much. All right, pivoting topics here. Let's talk about the one narrative that is happening, which is AI agents. So it seems like the timeline is basically dominated by, like, AI agent stuff. So we talked about Goat a little while ago, and I think you had said you're like, Goat could be the lightning bolt for AI agents starting to happen. And I think that was a good call.
00:45:52.349 - 00:46:12.685, Speaker B: So you're seeing social media influencers that are AI agents. Luna Venture Funds. AI16Z. There are launch pads, virtuals Spectral for trading. There's actually a ETH Global Hackathon. After Devcon there were 700 plus projects submitted. AI agents just dominated those.
00:46:12.685 - 00:46:38.811, Speaker B: Yeah, there's like industry AI which is creating like a gamified interface for multiple agents to work together to complete tasks. I'm just reading our research newsletter where they were talking about these. But anyways, there's a bunch of Coinbase. Oh this. This is a big kicker. Coinbase is a developer platform, has agent kit SDK where they're running LLMs under the hood that let you launch an AI agent super quickly. So I think a lot of this is happening on base.
00:46:38.811 - 00:46:44.711, Speaker B: It sounds like. So I don't know. That is a. I guess that is the real. That is a narrative that's happening right now.
00:46:44.903 - 00:46:47.475, Speaker A: That was my. Yeah, that was my thesis going into goat.
00:46:48.575 - 00:46:57.675, Speaker B: What do you think of the. I mean I've. I've. I'm. This is the wrong podcast to listen to if you want to get super deep into these because I haven't been paying super close attention unless. Unless you have.
00:46:58.375 - 00:47:01.927, Speaker A: I have because goat. But like there's so much that has.
00:47:01.991 - 00:47:06.423, Speaker B: Proliferated in terms of like tell me about Luna. Like tell me about AI16Z or like Luna.
00:47:06.479 - 00:47:24.461, Speaker A: I got pitched. Luna. Luna is this platform that's like allows you, if you're a creator or a kol or an influencer, to create this AI Persona that like is your bot basically. Right. It's an AI Persona that resembles like. No, I believe so. Yeah.
00:47:24.461 - 00:47:34.741, Speaker A: There's like different platforms that are allowing you to do this. But so like if you're a recognizable figure, you have like your own AI here.
00:47:34.813 - 00:48:07.715, Speaker B: This was. This is Sandra, the I think founder of Kaido. She said in the AI agent space, we've seen the first viral AI agent trained on 4chan data goat AI agent launchpads, virtual creator bid fifu AI influencers Luna on TikTok autonomous VC agents, AI16Z general agent infrastructure, spectral AI agents creating tokens anonymously. Luminous agent creating an entire soundtrack. 0 Bro, I actually listened to that song. Kind of slapped AI agent that gives you market alpha AI XBT and an AI agent that trades for you. Spectral.
00:48:07.715 - 00:48:14.119, Speaker B: Yeah, Pretty cool. This feels like go spend the weekend playing with some of these things.
00:48:14.247 - 00:48:15.215, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree.
00:48:15.335 - 00:48:20.155, Speaker B: Yeah. Anything else here?
00:48:20.615 - 00:48:28.115, Speaker A: No. I should mention that I have a position in goat and it's not small and this is not financial advice and I'm biased when I talk about these things.
00:48:29.405 - 00:48:41.385, Speaker B: Barry Silver, Big, big boss. He's back. He launched, he launched Yuma, which is a startup in the Bit Tensor ecosystem under the DCG umbrella.
00:48:42.565 - 00:48:42.973, Speaker A: Wow.
00:48:43.029 - 00:48:44.625, Speaker B: Interesting. Big week.
00:48:44.925 - 00:48:46.705, Speaker A: Big week. I guess.
00:48:49.005 - 00:49:18.915, Speaker B: Okay. Other things that I'm thinking about are micro strategy. MicroStrategy is basically just trading as a. Here let me pull up this chart of, of the old sailor pump here. I thought this was a pretty good chart from David Canales at Blockworks. So the orange shading in the background is the supply of Bitcoin that MicroStrategy owns. The orange is bitcoin and then the purple is MicroStrategy.
00:49:18.915 - 00:49:42.981, Speaker B: So you can see it tracking it for a very long time right here. And then it. In the last couple of months, I guess this year it's really just ran away. So yeah, MicroStrategy is on absolute tear. Stock is up about 600 year to date. It's hitting just daily 10 jumps. It now has better returns than Nvidia on an all time on, on the, these all time time frames.
00:49:42.981 - 00:49:44.997, Speaker B: I think that's the time frame that we're looking at.
00:49:45.181 - 00:49:48.905, Speaker A: No, but it is still higher. But close.
00:49:52.605 - 00:49:53.785, Speaker B: Oh, it's right here.
00:49:54.125 - 00:49:57.197, Speaker A: It may have changed but close. Okay, it's coming very close.
00:49:57.261 - 00:50:09.533, Speaker B: It's coming close. But yeah, the. What else happened? They. Oh so they announced this. Their latest convertible debt offering is increasing to 2.6 billion. They announced.
00:50:09.533 - 00:50:18.845, Speaker B: Yeah, the 40 billion or 42 billion dollar buy. They bought 4.6 billion worth of bitcoin last week at an average price of like 88,000.
00:50:20.185 - 00:50:27.045, Speaker A: Collectively their entire holdings are. I think the average price before maybe this latest purchase was like 50 or so sub. 50.
00:50:27.625 - 00:50:55.917, Speaker B: Yeah, but 50 price. Well now they hold, I think they hold like 330,000 Bitcoin which is like 1 and a half to 2% of the entire circulating supply of bitcoin. Yeah, yeah, I guess the bear. So I mean, just very interesting. I don't fully understand this. Honestly, it's, it's trading at like three to four times their, their net asset value against the value of their bitcoin. I don't.
00:50:55.941 - 00:50:58.397, Speaker A: This is like a grayscale all over again.
00:50:58.541 - 00:51:32.131, Speaker B: Yeah, this, this doesn't. I don't. I'm like why would you be buying this if there's a Bitcoin etf? What does make sense to me is what this guy Dylan Leclair is doing in Japan with I think it's called MetaPlanet, where there's no Bitcoin ETF in Japan. So they just did a. I think that. I'm pretty sure he just did Like a pipe, like a private investment in a public entity, and just kind of flipped it into this shell company where they've been buying up bitcoin. So I think what you'll end up seeing is in all these markets where there's no bitcoin etf, you'll see a random company just start, like a shell company, start buying bitcoin.
00:51:32.131 - 00:51:34.075, Speaker B: And that makes actually sense to me.
00:51:34.415 - 00:51:38.279, Speaker A: What doesn't make sense is why Microsoft, you would trade at a premium where you have the etf.
00:51:38.407 - 00:51:50.063, Speaker B: I see. That doesn't make sense to me. My other prediction for these. For the. For these markets is you saw Rumble. So Rumble is like an alternative video streaming platform. They teased a bitcoin treasury allocation.
00:51:50.063 - 00:52:10.185, Speaker B: Their CEO Chris posted a poll on Twitter about should they add bitcoin to the balance sheet. 336,000 people voted. 90% said yes. And the market actually on rumble pumped like 11%. So what that. And you saw a bunch of other people. Genius Group, Cosmos Health, Semler Scientific Marathon.
00:52:10.485 - 00:52:13.445, Speaker A: It is now popular. Yet again.
00:52:13.525 - 00:52:15.789, Speaker C: They're announcing bitcoin purchases and the price.
00:52:15.837 - 00:52:20.477, Speaker B: Of the stock is going up. And do you know what this reminds me of? Long Island Iced Tea.
00:52:20.621 - 00:52:21.293, Speaker A: Yes, sir.
00:52:21.389 - 00:52:25.213, Speaker B: Long Island Iced Tea. And the reason I say Long Island Iced Tea is because, I mean, was.
00:52:25.229 - 00:52:27.505, Speaker C: It the last market or was it two markets ago?
00:52:28.925 - 00:52:33.557, Speaker B: I think maybe two markets ago. I forget honestly, when. But if you put blockchain in your.
00:52:33.581 - 00:52:42.957, Speaker A: Name control f. And then. Yeah, people been doing this for the AI over the last, like two years now.
00:52:42.981 - 00:52:44.581, Speaker B: It's like, that's what's going to happen.
00:52:44.653 - 00:52:46.545, Speaker A: All right. That pumps over.
00:52:47.605 - 00:53:07.799, Speaker B: If I'm a CFO, I'm like, wait, I could move 1% of my treasury into bitcoin and I could get the market to jump 10%. I'm doing that all day long. So I think next year you're going to see all these. All these purchases. I'm actually now not because it makes sense, but because of the incentives.
00:53:07.847 - 00:53:09.595, Speaker A: What phase of the cycle is that?
00:53:10.175 - 00:53:13.075, Speaker B: It's euphoria. Phase three. Don't you read my Twitter threads?
00:53:13.575 - 00:53:33.947, Speaker A: I do. I'm asking the question. I got a jump soon, ladies and gentlemen, before Yano convinces me to sell and mortgage my house. And with all this bullishness, stay. I don't think a lot of you guys are euphoric. I guess housekeeping we are thinking of as. There's no surprise I've been spending more time in New York.
00:53:33.947 - 00:53:45.855, Speaker A: We're going to be maybe doing an event in the first, like, early December. And I think the best way to. Are we, are we talking about stop.
00:53:46.635 - 00:53:48.307, Speaker B: Operations team, just shed a tear?
00:53:48.371 - 00:53:51.625, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. But yeah, no, no, no, like a small, small scale event.
00:53:52.605 - 00:53:54.189, Speaker B: You have to be in the Telegram.
00:53:54.357 - 00:54:09.845, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Join the Telegraph if it happens, if it's gonna happen, you're gonna listen, learn about it first there. But it'd be nice to see folks before the end of the year. It's been, it's been a good year and you know, great community we have going there. There's how many people going strong there? A thousand.
00:54:09.925 - 00:54:30.965, Speaker B: We've got 670. 670. So you got pump the numbers. Last but not least, we have a code for you guys for DAs. We just announced Novogratz is joining us. Eric Peters, who came on the podcast, is now in. We haven't publicly shared that yet, but yeah, Empire 10 Santi is fighting for a spot.
00:54:31.625 - 00:54:40.385, Speaker A: See how I get treated here, ladies and gentlemen. I've been sitting in this chair for four years, but it's close to 30 years in crypto.
00:54:40.425 - 00:54:45.325, Speaker B: I think I'm going to get inversion cap swag before you get blockwork swag. That's the best thing.
00:54:46.925 - 00:55:03.301, Speaker A: I mean, that's an I'll. That's an. That's a no brainer. The designers who I am working with, which are fantastic, send us like the creative stuff, the logo and website and of course they put swag. I'm like, when they, when they slap it on a sweatshirt, I'm like, I want to see, I want to see how it looks like on T shirt.
00:55:03.333 - 00:55:06.101, Speaker B: You gotta do it. You got. Yeah, it looks good.
00:55:06.133 - 00:55:21.375, Speaker A: It looks like I'll. Maybe I'll do the unveil of the logo next week or I don't know if we're recording next week because of Thanksgiving, but anyways, maybe I'll just do the first unveil here in the pod for people to. Not that it's super like, you know, interesting or whatever, but.
00:55:21.795 - 00:55:38.613, Speaker B: All right, guys, thanks. Thanks for listening. Enjoy the weekend. We have a great podcast coming out on Tuesday with Santi's alma mater, Parify, Ben and Kevin. It is a banger 2 hour episode on their 10 predictions for the year 2030. I would highly recommend it. So.
00:55:38.669 - 00:55:45.445, Speaker A: And then we're not going to see. We're not going to see folks like a roundup next week because of Thanksgiving right now.
00:55:45.525 - 00:55:47.741, Speaker B: We're. We're cooking over Thanksgiving. We don't stop.
00:55:47.853 - 00:55:49.797, Speaker A: Oh, I love it. Let's go.
00:55:49.941 - 00:55:52.625, Speaker B: Or I don't. Or we might cancel it last minute.
00:55:52.925 - 00:56:01.165, Speaker A: Not, not a man. It's my favorite holiday of the year, but I'm down to cook here because I can't cook in the real kitchen.
00:56:01.285 - 00:56:01.773, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:56:01.869 - 00:56:07.179, Speaker A: So let's. Yeah, let's do it. I was going to wish people Happy Thanksgiving, but I guess we'll save that for next week.
00:56:07.267 - 00:56:09.603, Speaker B: Save it for next time. All right. Enjoy the weekend. See you, folks.
00:56:09.699 - 00:56:11.015, Speaker A: Thanks, folks. Take care.
00:56:12.115 - 00:56:31.815, Speaker C: Hey, everyone. Thanks for watching today's episode. Just wanted to quickly thank today's title sponsor, Skale. Skale really is one of the best chain experiences out there today, and I've used so many different chains. There's a reason they are gaining so much adoption in both gaming and AI Use cases. Hit the link in the show notes to explore the scale ecosystem.
00:56:32.385 - 00:56:32.625, Speaker B: Sa.
