00:00:00.400 - 00:00:09.806, Speaker A: This episode is brought to you by core, the brand new non custodial wallet that offers a seamless and secure experience on Avalanche. You'll hear more about core later in the show.
00:00:09.910 - 00:00:40.560, Speaker B: The capitulation is only just now, like the tip of the iceberg. So this time around, what was different was not only was it the leverage and the debt, it was access to capital markets. So everyone, their mom was spacing and they raised all this money, but this is completely dried up now. So the capital markets have all the liquidity is gone, and now they've got all this leverage on their books. They need to unwind. And that does take a little bit of time. And I think in the next month or so, I think people are still hoping that holding on to hope that bitcoin bounces and recovers.
00:00:40.560 - 00:00:48.484, Speaker B: If bitcoin doesn't bounce, there will be massive capitulations all across the board for different types of miners. Big inspo.
00:00:52.304 - 00:01:14.444, Speaker A: All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Empire. This is one of the most requested shows of the last couple. Couple of months. We've been talking about bitcoin mining, kind of capitulation in the markets across all of crypto. Obviously, we had Terra and Luna a couple of months ago. We've had capitulation in c five. We've seen some funds really struggling, and just recently we've started to see some.
00:01:14.444 - 00:01:35.580, Speaker A: Maybe capitulation is the wrong word, but some maybe for selling and just pain overall in the bitcoin mining market brought on two of the best people in the mining space. We have Cassie Clifton, VP of Biz Dev at Galaxy Digital, and Kevin Zhang, the SVP of mining strategy at Foundry. Cassie, Kevin, welcome to the show.
00:01:35.652 - 00:01:37.428, Speaker C: Thanks for having us. We appreciate it.
00:01:37.556 - 00:01:38.572, Speaker B: Thanks for having us on.
00:01:38.708 - 00:01:59.732, Speaker A: Yeah, of course. All right, guys, so here's, here's. Here's what's going on. 2021 Bitcoin hits this high of 64k. Interest rates near all time lows. Bitcoin miners were reportedly making close to 90% margins. At the peak, miners start signing all these hosting contracts, power purchasing agreements, other operational agreements that were kind of based on these bull market profitability models.
00:01:59.732 - 00:02:12.164, Speaker A: Right, from 2020 and 2021. Fast forward to. We're recording this mid July, 2022. Bitcoin's down 70%. Miners are starting to liquidate their balance sheets. Margins are compressing. Asics on fire sale.
00:02:12.164 - 00:02:49.366, Speaker A: Are on fire sale. I think a good place to go with this. I want to almost, with this episode, like, tell the story of what's been happening. So instead of talking about the now and trying to predict the future by starting at today. Let's go back to the beginning of this cycle. So maybe, Cassie, if I could pick on you, can you take us back to the start of this bull market going back to March, April, May, June, July of 2020, the market starts to heat up. What goes into the mind of someone running a mining company as we start to lead up into a bull market?
00:02:49.470 - 00:03:30.298, Speaker C: Yeah, I think there's a lot of things going on. I think people are getting excited that things are starting to finally defrost after a long winter. They realize that at this point, they've made it to the other side. You hear time and time again throughout these cycles that the number one thing that you can do is just to stay alive. And oftentimes your company has to change pretty dramatically for you to be able to do so. And so these companies are starting to think about what growth looks like again, it's not just survival mode. So they're starting to think about, okay, well, how do I leverage the assets that I have? What does the next phase of mining look like for a company? You know, we have x amount of time left until the next halving, like, the name of the game is time.
00:03:30.298 - 00:04:10.562, Speaker C: Like, time is money right now. So how do I get as much hash rate online as quickly as possible? And so you see people, you know, whether they're going out and they're raising debt, equity facilities, or, you know, whatever. Whatever their mode of acquiring capital is, they're going out there and they're trying to get online as quickly as possible. You know, at the same time, over the last couple of years, we've really seen debt come into this market in a way that it wasn't here prior. This is relatively new. And so this access to debt, people kind of went crazy. They just got, like, levered to the nines, and now they're kind of facing the ramifications of that, of like, you know, they were long bitcoin mining bitcoin.
00:04:10.562 - 00:04:26.974, Speaker C: They were long bitcoin hodling bitcoin, and they were like ultra long bitcoin taking out loans against their operations that they could only pay if number went up. And so we're still seeing a lot of people anticipate number go up or hoping number go up to be able to continue to fund their operations right now.
00:04:28.004 - 00:05:00.542, Speaker A: Companies got drunk on debt. I think that's a good almost framework to look at it. If you look back at like, 20, 17, 20, 16, 20, 17, 20, 18. The mining markets didn't have so much debt involved in them. Now you basically have a lot of facilities that will lend out to these miners. So sticking with 2020 here, the start of the cycle, you had the halving in 2020, excuse me, in May of 2020, if I remember correctly. So what's happening at this period of time? It's like summer of 2020 are miners rushing to find financing by.
00:05:00.542 - 00:05:10.994, Speaker A: Okay, so you've got debt, they're going public and they want to find financing. To do what? To order asics to find mining sites. Kevin, what do you do with this capital?
00:05:11.414 - 00:06:01.584, Speaker B: Yeah, so I love this question because it's kind of timing is everything in our industry. And unfortunately, a lot of miners, a lot of actors, they kind of mistimed things or they're a little either too early or too late. When we kind of made a big bet early in 2020 that the market's going to recover, we ordered a lot of machines, especially from micro vt, and this was actually around March. So this is back during the COVID crash. Across all markets, but especially in the crypto and bitcoin markets, we were able to actually time and buy the bottom. We sat down with Mike Collier, CEO, and Barry, and we made a big decision to order, I think at the time was like 28,000 m 30 ss because we knew that if we wanted to launch a financing business, we had to have machines coming in. Back then, Asics were also scarce and hard to source.
00:06:01.584 - 00:06:53.330, Speaker B: The issue was from March all the way through May, the having money economics only got worse. So no one wanted these miners. So we actually had to rethink and restrategize our business where we had these miners that if no one's going to be purchasing from us, whether it's just with cash or with financing, we had to mine with these ourselves. So we started deploying these miners at various different sites in anticipation that some of these sites and some of these kind of hosting providers, they'll have customers and they themselves may be interested in buying the miners from us. So it really wasn't until towards the end of summer when people were finally convinced that, oh, mining economics are turning around and bitcoin, it always baffles me. People always feel worried around having like, will bitcoin survive? Like, come on, guys, it's been already been a couple havings, right? So yes, it will survive, but the fear is still in a lot of the investors at that time. So people usually wait two to three months.
00:06:53.330 - 00:07:04.254, Speaker B: And as the economics BTC price recovers, only then are people looking to actually procure miners. And like Cassie said, the difference this time around was people really took advantage of leverage.
00:07:04.594 - 00:07:26.580, Speaker A: Hmm. You guys are going to have to bear with me as I ask some potentially fifth grade level questions here. What are the. Cassie, what are the. Kevin. Kevin's saying that it wasn't profitable, it wasn't economical to get these miners. To get these miners online in, like, maybe March or April or May of 2020, and it wasn't maybe until the end of the summer that it became economical.
00:07:26.580 - 00:07:40.222, Speaker A: What are the. Here's the fifth grade level question. Like, what are the inputs for a bitcoin miner that make it economical? What are the hash rate, price of asics, price of bitcoin? Like, what are the inputs here, and how do you make that calculation?
00:07:40.398 - 00:08:03.910, Speaker C: Yeah, and, Kevin, you chime in here, too. I would say that the number one differentiator, at least that we see kind of when we're modeling things out for ourselves and other companies that we're looking at extending credit to, is the cost of power. And unfortunately, in 2020, we were at historical all time low power costs, and now we're, like, verging on all time high power costs. So the coin has really flipped. And the other thing is.
00:08:03.942 - 00:08:06.702, Speaker A: And these are power costs of electricity.
00:08:06.758 - 00:08:34.078, Speaker C: Exactly. Yeah. So that's really the number one differentiator between, you know, not whether or not you're gonna make it. Like, obviously, there's a little bit more nuance there. But, like, the number one differentiator to, like, can you build a sustainable mining model is your input cost of power. And so thinking about it, like, you know, maybe you can get a contract, but in order to get a contract, typically you need a deposit, sometimes of around 20% of, like, the overall cost over the term. So that's, like, difficult to come up with.
00:08:34.078 - 00:09:07.054, Speaker C: And then you have the massive, like, capex expenditure of, you know, the miners themselves, and then that hasn't even gotten to the infrastructure part of the site, if that's not already provided, or you're not just using a quick container solution, but then you still have to think about the step down and the wiring, and so there are just a lot of different components, and then you need the qualified people, so there's barriers to entry and capex, and you're in a situation where you've just defrosted, and now you're starting to think about those things, so you need someone else's help to get off the ground.
00:09:08.204 - 00:09:33.656, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think Cassie hit the nail on the head. It's obviously the one component that everyone harps on is electrical rates. Right. What is your cost of power? But the one thing that most people underestimate is the cost to actually bring that power online into pluggable, energized slots for the AsiCs. It's the site development, it's the procurements, the permitting, and then it's the timing too. Just because you find a cheap, affordable project with reasonable capex.
00:09:33.656 - 00:09:52.456, Speaker B: And these can be anywhere from 250,000 to half a million. And sometimes you're pushing seven hundred fifty k per megawatt in Capex. And that's only for infrastructure. If it takes you six to nine months to bring online, that's six to nine months where your acs can't plug in and none of your capital that you borrowed is working for you.
00:09:52.640 - 00:10:02.680, Speaker A: Sticking with the question of just inputs on costs for a second, electricity costs, these are what, driven by weather conditions and regulations and the transmission systems and the cost of running a power plant.
00:10:02.712 - 00:10:37.134, Speaker B: Is that so? It's a variety of different things. I think it all comes down to where your physical location is. Across the US, you have many different grids, you have different states and jurisdictions, some with regulated and some with others with deregulated markets. Bitcoin miners tend to go to deregulated markets because they can choose where they purchase power from go to the lowest cost competitor. But what we're seeing nowadays especially is that there are geopolitical macro risks to electrical rates, the input cost of natural gas and oil and everything else that eventually translates into what the electrical rates that miners are paying for.
00:10:37.514 - 00:11:03.736, Speaker A: That's really interesting. Okay, so let's go back to the timeline. We've got like summer of 2020, these things start getting. Starts to become profitable again to mine, right, the price of bitcoin, March 12 of 2020, what I think the price hit like $3,500 that day, or 4000 ends up starting to climb by summer we're at like 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15k. Price starts climbing. What, so people are, people are basically what, racing to buy these Asics. And then once you.
00:11:03.736 - 00:11:21.178, Speaker A: And that takes how long? It takes six months to get Asics. It takes twelve months to get asics. What do you do here, Cassie? You just basically, you call up a, you call up a. There's what, a couple vendors that sell ASics. You call them up and you say, I want to put in an order for like 50 million Asics. How does this actually, how does this go down?
00:11:21.296 - 00:11:54.398, Speaker C: Yeah, I think. And Kevin, you guys can, you guys actually have a business around this, so you're probably better suited to speak to this than I am. But there's really a couple of different ways that it can go down. I would say at that point, like, we didn't have the secondary asic market, like as strong as it is today, like, there weren't quite as many secondary purchase orders floating around. And so, yeah, for the most part, you were either going to a handful of secondary procurement providers or you were going straight to manufacturers. And lead times really vary just depending on the machines that you were trying to get your hands on. And then obviously, like, there were some, some real supply chain constraints during COVID time.
00:11:54.398 - 00:12:08.854, Speaker C: So, you know, you could have been looking at anywhere from, from six to twelve months. And obviously you have to come up with some sort of deposit there, so you're looking at putting money down. That's not going to be going to work to you, for you for, you know, six to twelve months.
00:12:08.894 - 00:12:59.186, Speaker B: So, yeah, so if we take a step back and kind of address why foundries even formed and what our kind of mission was, it's to proliferate and help institutional adoption of bitcoin mining, especially here in the states. Right at the time this was early 2020 and summer 2021. Of the key risks for getting people interested in mining at an institutional level here in North America was one that it's controlled by China or it's bad for the environment. So we'll ignore the ESG environment piece of it. But at that time, much of the mining hash rate was located in China, both physically and virtually on the software layer. I would say 67% of the global network was physically based in facilities across China. And then upwards of 90% of the hash rate was being collected and aggregated on pools based out of China.
00:12:59.186 - 00:13:39.124, Speaker B: So when Cassie says there wasn't a vibrant market, and she's referring to outside of China, so the secondary markets, everything was very fluid in China, but we wanted to decentralize the ecosystem and help build things elsewhere, especially in our backyard here in North America. So back then really was, it was a fight and a scramble to procure Asics because a lot of it was being gobbled up by resellers or by miners within China. So we had a large part in kind of scooping up our allocation. And a lot of that came back to the big bet we made back in March when we had confidence and we wanted to be contrarian, thinking that the market will recover and there needed to be Asics coming into North America.
00:13:39.244 - 00:14:05.024, Speaker A: It strikes me that one of the biggest differences from maybe 18 months ago versus today is that in the bull market, the ability to get your hands on Asics and mining rigs was this massive bottleneck, perhaps. Now you fast forward 18 months, there's this, what I think is a big Asic surplus from just talking to a few folks in the market. And prices of Asics are starting to fall 50% to 70% from their 2021 highs. Is that a fair categorization?
00:14:05.324 - 00:14:28.864, Speaker C: I would say so, yeah, I definitely think that this is a surplus and it's one to the extent that I don't believe we've seen one quite like this. And this is like, leverage plays a large role in this. We're kind of unwinding all of that leverage. And people use money that they didn't really have and they definitely don't have now to buy these machines. And so that's coming full circle. So the secondary market's stronger than ever.
00:14:29.564 - 00:14:40.124, Speaker A: So, folks, when you're buying Asics, how much of that can get bought with debt? Or I guess, how much do you have to. Yeah, how much do you have to prepay? And what does that contract look like? Maybe, Kevin, if I could throw this to you. Sure.
00:14:40.164 - 00:15:22.366, Speaker B: So it's constantly changing, both on the manufacturer's purchase orders. Right. So back in 2020, these were still spot orders or future orders where people were depositing x amount of dollars, usually 30 to 40, sometimes even 50%, to get units purchased in the future. Or they pay 100% and they get units right away. Now, bitmain and microbt, they learn from past mistakes where they have massive upfront costs and capex in having to make their deposits and payments towards the foundries or the chip manufacturers. So they started debuting their annual contracts. This was a whole new thing this cycle where people were paying anywhere from 25% to 30% upfront six months in advance.
00:15:22.366 - 00:16:18.004, Speaker B: And then a couple months before delivery, they pay another third of the entire purchase order. And then right before delivery, they pay that remaining piece of 25 or 30%. And for us financing providers, based off of kind of mining economics at the time and how close we were towards the next halving, we were obviously offering different tenors, but our rates and our ltvs were changing. So when mining, well, when the entire ecosystem started defrosting and mining economics started turning around, we were very aggressive with our LTV, right? We were only looking for 20% collateral, so it was 80% LTV. But nowadays, like, for one, we actually stopped financing towards the end of last year because we got really worried with where mining economics were heading, how much leverage was in the system, and the fact that we're only two years away from the next halving. But towards the end, our ltvs got down to 50%, and that's a big change from the 80% they were previously.
00:16:19.464 - 00:17:21.902, Speaker C: I think we took a bit of a different approach there, at least on the LTV front. And obviously, like, you know, everyone had this in mind where, like, the vis is really fluctuates a lot in the loan to value calculation, right? Because, like, first of all, you had lenders who were looking at it, you know, as the purchase price of the machines, and they were describing that as the value. And then you had lenders like us and foundry who were looking at it as the fair market value. But then how do you really calculate the fair market value? Is it what it's trading for on the secondary market? Is it. What if you bought it new? Is it what the liquidation value is? And how do you, like, how do you define the liquidation value of, let's say you're underwriting a loan for 40,000 against 40,000 asics? That's really difficult because putting an additional 40,000 asics onto the secondary market, that's going to further suppress it. So those are all things that you have to consider, and it's very nuanced, and there's not really any one size fits all for miners. And so it really is just dependent on the overall view of each individual miner, which is why it's tough for that product to be one where you can do it in a week.
00:17:21.902 - 00:17:28.194, Speaker C: It takes probably six weeks. And then by that time, sometimes mining conditions have changed and you have to go back to the drawing board.
00:17:29.034 - 00:17:47.866, Speaker A: Let's fast forward the timeline. We're telling the story of all of this unfolding. Right, let's. Let's maybe fast forward a year into the cycle. So now it's maybe March of 2021, bitcoin has ripped higher, it's gone up 20 x. We hit that first top, remember, we had the two tops up at 60k. We hit the first top of 60k around, if I remember correctly.
00:17:47.866 - 00:18:23.126, Speaker A: It was like March of 2021. Miners are, I'm sure at this point, absolutely scrambling to just get more supply. They want more asics, they want more mining sites, they're racing, they're taking out as much debt as possible. They're loading up the balance sheet, loading up the truck. Are they also selling bitcoin when they get bitcoin? Or is this when the psychology of just being a bitcoin hodler kind of comes into play? And you're like, all right, well, like, I know my treasury management solution. I know I should technically be selling here. I know that's probably the wise thing, but, like, I'm also a bitcoiner.
00:18:23.126 - 00:18:45.996, Speaker A: I also like to hodl bitcoin. So it's really tough for me to sell here because super cycle bitcoin going to the moon, we're going to rip past 100k. Like what? Not sure who to throw this question to. Yeah, exactly. Stock to flow model plan. Plan B is boasting on Twitter that this thing's going to go to a million dollars. You'd have to be an idiot to sell your bitcoin here.
00:18:45.996 - 00:18:58.328, Speaker A: So, cassie, what were. All right, so March of 2021, what are the miners doing with their bitcoin? And maybe the second question there is, like, what should they have been doing with their bitcoin?
00:18:58.376 - 00:19:39.306, Speaker C: Yeah, well, I think a lot of the public press releases and statements that have been made today really give us a pretty good view into what they were doing a couple of years ago, or last year, rather, at the height of the cycle. It's very clear that they were hodling their stack. And I think that the reason for this is that they're bitcoiners through and through. So this becomes an emotional journey for them. And when you invest and you're emotional about your investments, you just don't tend to make very good rational decisions. And the ramifications can be really, really important, especially when you're taking on leverage. So, Kevin, I'd be curious to hear your thoughts there, too.
00:19:39.490 - 00:20:13.826, Speaker B: I agree with everything you said. The one piece I'll add into that was also different about this cycle was the public markets were much more welcoming to the bitcoin miners, too. And I also think there was a lot of inefficiency and ignorance from the retail investor when it came to bitcoin miners. A lot of bitcoin miners. And these companies, these firms, not only do they get greedy thinking, an emotional thinking, we need to hold bitcoin on our balance sheet. They were really swayed by the sailor approach, where not only are we mining bitcoin at cheaper costs, we're now have to hold it on our balance sheet. They were rewarded for it in the short term.
00:20:13.826 - 00:20:38.754, Speaker B: A lot of these valuations for mining companies, if you compare with how much hash rate they had online and what their actual cash flow was against, their actual market cap, was ludicrous. These were insane multiples, but they weren't punished for it at the time. So to raise more capital and really pump their valuation to public markets, they were incentivized to hold more bitcoin on their balance sheet. That was something that was very unique during this cycle.
00:20:42.734 - 00:20:53.024, Speaker A: What percentage of the bitcoin inflow into a company were they selling? And what percentage of bitcoin inflow into a miner should they have been selling? Does that question make sense?
00:20:53.324 - 00:21:18.440, Speaker B: Yeah. So with the benefit of hindsight, right, one of the easiest strategies to kind of bitcoin mine is look at it as a cash flow business. Don't get attached to the fact that you're mining bitcoin and you got to be a hodler and you're going to be a mini microstrategy. Right. It's actually pretty responsible to kind of sell bitcoin as your money. Now, you can take some short term kind of derivatives and strategies, like cover calls. They're going to be selling anyways.
00:21:18.440 - 00:21:53.026, Speaker B: May as well sell it at a small premium, like you can get fancier with some structured products there. But for the most part, this business is so cash flow intensive, you got to make sure that you have enough to cover your ongoing costs as well as your future costs, right. Because it's very volatile and it can be very fickle, as we've seen in kind of more recent months. But at the time, what happened was when people were holding on their balance sheets, they were only just selling enough to make their opex, which is their electrical costs, and there's tiny overhead, right. They were hodling most of their coins and they were bragging about it publicly because once again, they were rewarded for it.
00:21:53.170 - 00:22:23.544, Speaker A: Prices at 60k. It's March of 2021. Let's continue fast forwarding this timeline we start getting into. Where we're sitting at is people are loading up the dump truck with debt, they're buying asics like crazy. They're trying to expand their mining sites and they're getting all this bitcoin. But instead of selling the bitcoin to maybe predict out cash flows in the future and predict out expenses, they're kind of just selling the minimum amount of bitcoin necessary. Take me forward to maybe the start of the bear market.
00:22:23.544 - 00:22:47.514, Speaker A: Cassie, this market peaked out in November of 2021. December happens, January happens. Market starts to turn a little bit, inflation is coming. We start to see that interest rates are going to start rising. What do these miners start doing? Do they correct course, or is what we're seeing today the result of these miners not correcting course quickly enough?
00:22:48.574 - 00:23:35.470, Speaker C: I think it's really difficult because if you were to look back in 2020 and you were to think about what's the logical thing to happen in this market, given the amount of money printing going on, you would have thought rampant inflation. And there was a bit of a lag there with the delay. People probably kept thinking the same thing, like, oh, inflation isn't coming at the same rate. We're going to continue to delay. Rates are going to continue to be as low as they are. But then rates started going up and inflation starts to kick in and the economy starts to turn around, a major war breaks out. There are all these different factors that are macro backlays that are affecting the traditional and bitcoin and crypto markets that start to play out that really people just didn't think were going to happen reasonably so because they had been several years and they hadn't started happening yet.
00:23:35.470 - 00:24:03.498, Speaker C: And so you have that happen, and you have this spike right before the ETF announcement in October. And so people think that that's like a short term high, but that we're still on the up and up. Like, stock to flow is still going to happen. And so they're still thinking that prices are going up. And like, no one is really realizing that we're in a bear market until probably like the last 60 days or so. Has it really started to sink in for everyone? Like, oh, it's actually here. Like, I have to start preparing for winter.
00:24:03.498 - 00:24:21.094, Speaker C: And by that time, if you wait until you're in the bear market to prepare for most people, it's too late, unless you have a massive treasury where you've left some cash on your balance sheet. So now this is kind of the luck that you're stuck with trying to figure out, how do you make it work in this market?
00:24:21.394 - 00:24:39.982, Speaker A: All right, folks, this episode is brought to you by our friends at Avalanche and Ava Labs. They have just dropped a new crypto wallet called Core. You're going to be hearing a lot about it over the coming months. You can now be one of the first to try it out. Here's the reason I'm excited to partner with them on Empire right now. Crypto wallets and browser extensions. They feel clunky.
00:24:39.982 - 00:25:08.190, Speaker A: They feel non intuitive. That's why Ava Labs built core. It's a free, non custodial browser extension that gives Avalanche users a seamless and secure web3 experience across the entire avalanche ecosystem. Here are a few reasons to try core. Here's what I'm experimenting with. Number one, Core has intuitive dashboards with a unified display for all of your NFT collections, all your crypto assets. You can execute asset swaps directly inside the wallet.
00:25:08.190 - 00:25:39.194, Speaker A: It's a really nice experience. Maybe you want to earn, yield or borrow against your bitcoin, but you don't want to do it on one of those c five platforms right now. Core's native bridging functionality makes it really easy to bridge your bitcoin to avalanche's robust defi ecosystem. Last but not least, core makes unwrapping super easy. You can convert dollars to crypto right now using the moonpay integration. Just takes a few clicks. Download core today using the link in the show notes, it's really, really nice.
00:25:39.194 - 00:25:48.574, Speaker A: If you are interested in the avalanche ecosystem at all, you have to be using core. Download core using the link below. Now let's get back to the show.
00:25:49.814 - 00:26:56.084, Speaker B: So I think the one big thing we kind of glossed over too quickly was during April and May of 2021. This is when the China bans were coming around. And at the time, there was a lot of confusion, skepticism over will they actually go through it. This time is different, or it's another threat, and they're not going to actually ban it out, et cetera. But I think when the bans actually came through at the end of June 2021, this is when mining economics in the mining ecosystem really decoupled and became very inefficient compared to the rest of the crypto markets, in the sense that even though bitcoin, I think during that summer, had dropped from the highs of 60k down to, like, 30 or so, you had over 50% of the network turn off overnight. So from your mining economic standpoint, you're actually making just as much bitcoin USD value and cash flow as you were back when bitcoin was at 60k back in April. And what that did was that gave, I think, a certain.
00:26:56.124 - 00:27:00.624, Speaker A: Sorry, Kevin, fifth grade question coming here again. Explain that.
00:27:00.924 - 00:27:52.166, Speaker B: Right, so we covered the cost inputs of what miners are looking at with kind of the capex and electrical rates. The inputs for their revenue are one BTC price. And then what is the global hash rate or difficulty? So, difficulty is set roughly every two weeks, 2016 blocks, based off of how fast or how slow blocks are solved. So when we say global hash rate difficulty, we're kind of talking about the same thing. So the more difficult it is to solve a block, the more hash rates on the network. Well, when 50% to 60% of the network was based in China and the bands came through and they were enforced very strictly, you had essentially 50% or more of the network or competition fall off. So the people that remained on, namely in North America and other countries outside China, we got to make 50% more revenue.
00:27:52.166 - 00:27:55.942, Speaker B: And actually, that went directly to our bottom line, because our costs didn't change either.
00:27:56.038 - 00:28:09.708, Speaker A: So for a layman like me, everyone unplugs that. A lot of the folks in China unplug the hash rate tanks. It becomes easier to mine bitcoin or less expensive to mine bitcoin. Takes less energy to mine bitcoin.
00:28:09.756 - 00:28:15.772, Speaker B: So my output actually, no, your costs are the same, but your revenue gets essentially doubled.
00:28:15.948 - 00:28:22.704, Speaker C: It becomes 50% less difficult to mine. So statistically, you're finding blocks 50% more frequently.
00:28:23.044 - 00:28:27.004, Speaker A: Got you. Okay, carry on. I interrupted the story before. No.
00:28:27.044 - 00:29:04.948, Speaker B: So what happened was miners are given this much bigger cushion that never existed before. Right? It never existed before in the sense that 50% of the competition in China, the reason why mining gravitated towards China, and this is going back to this time, is different. Right. And this goes back to the original China bans that happened back in 2012 and 2013, when they mentioned that they were going to ban bitcoin, ban bitcoin mining, then they didn't really follow through with it. Right. And what happened was, the reason why western manufacturers failed in 2013, 2014 was no one could be as cost competitive at producing Asics and miners as China, namely Shenzhen. Right.
00:29:04.948 - 00:29:44.816, Speaker B: Which is a massive electronics manufacturing hub for the world. So from that 2014 era, China has dominated bitcoin and bitcoin mining economics, or the industry and ecosystem, because they're so efficient and they're the lowest cost competitor. And when this ban actually came through, all their advantages were kind of plucked away. Right. And not only do you have sites coming online now slower, in China, you could build a mining facility in two to three months. In the US, it takes two to three months just to get your permitting in order before you even start construction, which takes another six months or so. So you actually have hashrate.
00:29:44.816 - 00:30:13.086, Speaker B: Not only does it drop 50%, the growth of hashrate becomes really stagnant. So once again, the competition has dropped tremendously. And miners are then given this extended lifeline where their economics are much more competitive than the rest of the crypto markets. And I think that's why the reality hasn't really set into miners until more recent months when, oh, actually, we are to the point where we're actually starting to capitulate, whereas the rest of the markets were kind of hit towards maybe spring and earlier, three, four months ago.
00:30:13.190 - 00:30:30.684, Speaker C: That's a really good point. And to some extent, I still think that a lot of people are kind of waiting for hashrate to fall offline so that they can be that much more profitable. And I've been personally very surprised by the lack of hash rate falling off. I thought that we would see a lot more coming offline than we have already, but it seems that people are really holding on.
00:30:31.384 - 00:30:37.600, Speaker A: So the hash rate, ok, so China ban, what? This was maybe mid May of 2021.
00:30:37.712 - 00:30:39.768, Speaker B: This was June 1, 2021.
00:30:39.896 - 00:31:01.642, Speaker A: Okay, hash rate tanks. Miners are like, holy shit, this is amazing. We're going to make more money. But don't you expect in your models, if you're a miner, that the hashrate eventually recovers, because it's an open market and the miners didn't think that the hashrate was just going to stay low forever. And if I remember correctly, the hashrate did recover. It just took about maybe six or seven months.
00:31:01.778 - 00:31:39.598, Speaker B: Yeah. Here's the really fascinating part that I think isn't shared enough about Hashrate and what's happened since the ban. Actually, I think it was actually at the end of June 2021 when that ban took place, 50% of the network came offline, which can also say 50% of the miners came offline. Bitmain and Microbt and the manufacturers didn't stop producing units, and the units only got more efficient. So what that's led to is for the market to recover to where it was. All the units that were unplugged eventually were plugged in, as well as new miners coming in. Today, we still have 30% to 40% of total manufactured hash rate unplugged sitting on the floor.
00:31:39.598 - 00:32:18.016, Speaker B: So hash rate could be significantly higher, if only there was less bottlenecking when it comes to the infrastructure and the hosting capacity available for these miners. Now, I could also argue less hash rate be online because the economics aren't there. But once again, it was the fact that miners were given this kind of very soft cushion and landing because so much of the competition had fallen off. The bottleneck switched from it was no longer procuring. Asics. The fire sales of Asics actually took place last summer when China banned mining. A lot of miners gave up, capitulated, and they needed cash, or they wanted to cash out and they sold their miners for the cheap.
00:32:18.016 - 00:32:44.426, Speaker B: This time around, the constraints were now on hosting capacity, because not only was so much of a shutdown in China, everywhere else in the world is slower to build. So that took a very long time. You mentioned it was like six to seven months. Yeah, it was about that long for hash just to return to the previous highs a year ago. And now we have so many miners offline, both newer generation units coming in, as well as miners that never got plugged back in since Spain.
00:32:44.490 - 00:32:55.962, Speaker C: I still talk to people like, you know, every week, maybe every couple of weeks that have like a significant amount of miners offline from China that like, are planning to place them in the States. And that was, you know, over a year ago at this point.
00:32:56.018 - 00:33:00.634, Speaker A: So what are they doing with the miner? Why? What are they doing with that?
00:33:00.674 - 00:33:40.194, Speaker C: So the thing that you have to think about is like the logistical, there's a logistical nightmare, first of all, of like transporting the machines. And if you do so and you don't yet have a place to put them, then it's kind of just like an additional cost that you're incurring for no real reason. Right. And so if you think about like fuel prices skyrocketing and the costs to transport machines, it's like if you're like, you're going to assume some losses of machines as well. So you may lose like 10% of your hardware and move over there only to find another storage venue, you know, where you can place them until you then find hosting. So then you have to ship them again. And so people are just holding off, like waiting until they find rack space that's affordable for them somewhere based on like the efficiency of the machine that they have.
00:33:40.574 - 00:34:04.382, Speaker A: Let me just repeat it back to you to make sure I understand it. So basically, for the first year of the bull market, the Asics, there's a shortage of Asics, and getting Asics might have been the constraint on the market. China shuts down mining, all these Asics flood into the market, it becomes much easier to acquire Asics. Now the constraint in the market becomes finding a place to actually plug those Asics into. Is that.
00:34:04.558 - 00:34:06.812, Speaker B: Exactly, that's absolutely. Yep.
00:34:06.908 - 00:34:27.864, Speaker C: The real constraint that people are pushing up on right now goes back to the inputs that are important, and that's the cost of power. So finding a site where you can lock down cheap power and it makes sense for you and you can do so over a long period of time versus just having it fluctuate with the market where, you know, like, oh, I'm going to be profitable for x number of years. That's very tough to do right now.
00:34:28.164 - 00:35:22.824, Speaker B: Yeah. So every site's got its nuances, it's got its own specific timeline it works off of. But if we're going from a very high level, we're generalizing in the US, it does take anywhere from nine to twelve months to get a site off the ground from nothing to a fully functioning bitcoin mine. I think one of the fascinating components of what happened when the China bans took place was obviously miners had to look for other previously deprioritized regions or other regions that have the attributes of a competitive bitcoin mining environment, namely cheap power and availability to scale and geopolitical friendliness, I guess. But some miners took the risk in the quote unquote easy way out of going to Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan during that summer was very welcoming of miners. They loved seeing this burgeoning new industry lifting up the economics and giving them that injection of economic growth.
00:35:22.824 - 00:36:19.986, Speaker B: The reason why a lot of chinese miners went over to Kazakhstan versus North America is because in Kazakhstan, it's very similar to China, where they can build a site also in two to three months. And a lot of that comes to lack of permitting, lack of process, where things don't have to be ul listed or CE certified. They can use cheaper aluminum instead of copper for a lot of electrical equipment. So they were able to build up very quickly overnight. The issue was Kazakhstan's infrastructure couldn't take that scale, so the entire country was very imbalanced on power. Where so much of the mining was happening in the southern part of Kazakhstan, it was unbalancing their total national grid. So you have Kazakhstan in the matter of, like, seven to eight months from welcoming miners with open arms, with tax incentives to then shutting down miners and then charging them additional taxation for being a bitcoin mine that didn't properly register or is consuming too much power without going through the right permitting processes.
00:36:19.986 - 00:36:24.890, Speaker B: So a lot of Kazakhstan miners were then kicked out, and now everyone's gravitated, namely to North America.
00:36:25.002 - 00:36:40.858, Speaker A: Got it? If I'm kind of summarizing what you guys have told me, miners just had massive expansion. You had facility expansion. You had, like, ASIC expansion. You had, honestly, company expansion. You had access to capital expansion. Like, these companies were going public. Right.
00:36:40.858 - 00:37:06.970, Speaker A: There is new access to debt. And so just expansion across the board now. Who was it? Amanda. Cassie on your team at Galaxy was speaking at consensus. She said out of a sample size of 18 public miners, there are now 1.9 billion in Po liabilities outstanding. There was a Bloomberg report that there are $4 billion in bitcoin miner loans coming under stress right now.
00:37:06.970 - 00:37:27.804, Speaker A: What is the maybe walk us through now. It's July, June, July. What is the state of bitcoin mining today? Because it feels like all of that capital expansion, human capital expansion, facility expansion is now coming due at a time when prices are down 70%. So, Cassie, what is the state of bitcoin mining today?
00:37:27.924 - 00:38:19.284, Speaker C: Yeah, you could probably price adjust that $1.9 billion number based on some of the manufacturer downward price adjustments for the purchase orders down to 1.55 or 1.53 billion. That's still a massive number, though, for people to have to come up with in this market. You know, I think for a lot of people, the unfortunate reality is that a lot of the financing was used for purchase orders, obviously. And so what will happen, essentially, is that if they're unable to pay the remainder on the purchase order, they either have to try really hard to sell the purchase order to someone and try to break even, which is they're just not going to break even on the purchase order, or they are going to just lose the purchase order because they're going to go down holding their bag and then they're going to lose their deposit to the manufacturer, and then they will also burn their relationship with the manufacturer.
00:38:19.284 - 00:38:39.404, Speaker C: And that will probably be the reality for a lot of people. I thought that I would see, you know, we obviously see a lot of distressed debt deals come across our desk. Can't speak to any of them in particular, but I did think I would see a lot more than I've seen, which kind of tells me that, like, people are still holding on to some of those, those pos, that are out there.
00:38:39.564 - 00:39:11.716, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think this is another symptom of the China ban and miners having a little bit more margin and cushioning than the rest of. Of the larger, not just crypto, but macroeconomics. The capitulation is only just now like the tip of the iceberg. So this time around, what was different was not only was it the leverage and the debt, it was access to capital markets. So everyone, their mom was spacing and they raised all this money, but this is completely dried up now. So the capital markets have all the liquidity is gone, and now they've got all this leverage on their books.
00:39:11.716 - 00:39:27.800, Speaker B: They need to unwind. And that does take a little bit of time. And I think in the next month or so, I think people are still hoping, holding on to hope that bitcoin bounces and recovers. If bitcoin doesn't bounce, there will be massive capitulations all across the board for different types of miners, big and small.
00:39:27.952 - 00:39:48.420, Speaker A: Tell me more about that. Kevin. I know you guys can't comment on specific companies, but I'm allowed to comment on specific companies. We saw core scientific sold, I think it was 75% of their bitcoin. Bit farm sold about 3000 bitcoin. I think that was about 50% of their stake. You're saying this is just the tip of the iceberg? Kevin, how bad does.
00:39:48.420 - 00:39:59.428, Speaker A: I'm not talking about those two specific companies, but as an industry and across the board, how bad does minor capitulation get over these next couple of months if bitcoin prices remain depressed at around 20k?
00:39:59.556 - 00:40:37.776, Speaker B: Right. So if they remain depressed and hash rate doesn't readjust, I don't think it will, because it's kind of holding steady where it's at. The only reason the hash rate difficulty isn't growing this next cycle is because so much of it's shutting off in Texas for curtailment. So what real pain looks like is not only is it right now, bitcoin miners, especially, a lot of the public listed miners, they still had bitcoin on their balance sheet that they could sell. They're not going to have that lifeline a month or two from now. They're not going to have bitcoin to sell for the cash flow needs. What you're going to have is you're going to have to look at a competitive cost stack for what their operating costs or what their electrical rates are.
00:40:37.776 - 00:41:07.408, Speaker B: So anyone that's running at these are going to be the people that capitulate first. They're going to be the ones that are unplugging their miners. This is why it's so important. When you're going in to build a bitcoin mining project, you have to have a site where it's got access to cheap electricity because you're not going to be rolling in profit, but you're going to be one of the groups, the last man standing. Right? So you're going to look at the groups that don't have the most competitive power rates. They're going to be the ones capitulating first because they just can't generate the cash flow to stay in business.
00:41:07.576 - 00:41:34.904, Speaker C: I still give hashrate another couple of months. I think that based on the terms that people might be paying their power agreements on, they could be on net 30 terms. And so maybe they're holding out 30 days and they don't have to pay for their electricity until the end of the month. And so they're waiting to see if number goes up and then they can mine some coins or sell it on their treasury then, rather than having to shut off if it doesn't make sense. But we're very close.
00:41:35.964 - 00:42:18.446, Speaker B: This is the part where it's really tricky, right. Because historically, the bitcoin mining network or the price really doesn't care what your hosting rates are. If we go back to the bare bottom of the last cycle, November and December of 2018, mining economics at the time were generating about 55 or even $50 a megawatt hour. So if you had a miner plugged in, you were only making five cents per kilowatt hour. There are a lot of facilities, a lot of players out there that have costs are above that threshold, right? They're operating at five or $0.06 or 50 or $60 a megawatt hour. It's really strange too, because what's different from the last cycles, you do have a lot of inflation.
00:42:18.446 - 00:42:49.724, Speaker B: You have this massive macroeconomic change on the new baseline of power costs. So we really don't know where the new bottom is. But once again, I think one thing we can agree on is the people that are less competitive, that have higher electrical rates, they're going to be the first ones capitulating and unplugging. What you'll start seeing here in the next few months or at least in the next half year is the people that are unplugging. I don't even know someone's going to come in and bail them out. But there will be some very aggressive, hostile takeovers, acquisitions, etcetera. And I think thats going to be really exciting.
00:42:49.884 - 00:43:04.668, Speaker A: Are there any bitcoin miners right now who are running profitably? So lets take a sample size of ten bitcoin miners. Eight of them are profitable, half of them are profitable. Maybe one or two out of the ten are profitable. What do the numbers look like right now?
00:43:04.756 - 00:43:44.812, Speaker C: I think it really depends on first how you define profitability. Are you looking at it just as margin? Are you looking at also depreciation? Are you also including SG and a expenses? Theres a lot of different ways that you could of look at like defining profitability. So it's not really like that straightforward. And then, you know, you really have to look at each individual operation because every miner is built so differently. Like depending on what their model is, do they own infrastructure? Do they have outstanding liabilities on that infrastructure? Like how much debt do they have? What are their monthly operational expenses? Like, how big is their team, et cetera? So there's just a lot of inputs. I would say. I would rather look at it like on a cost basis.
00:43:44.812 - 00:44:15.026, Speaker C: And I think, Kevin, you would probably have a little bit more insight into this as well. But like 22.5 is like the price that we've modeled is where the majority of miners are feeling a lot of pain and, or having to look at shutting down operations. But then again, like, you know, the data set that we're working with is definitely not perfect. So there's definitely a long way to go towards transparency and costs. And, you know, the data set that we're being. That we've received is also like, you know, people maybe are looking at margins.
00:44:15.026 - 00:44:19.058, Speaker C: Some people are including depreciation. So it's definitely not perfect.
00:44:19.226 - 00:44:35.506, Speaker B: Yeah, it's really tough to give like a kind of a high level haircut of what the. How many miners are, quote unquote cash flow positive? But I would say maybe it's like eight out of eight or nine out of those ten miners. And the nuance is going to be how over levered are they? What is, what is their debt obligations?
00:44:35.650 - 00:44:37.162, Speaker A: Eight or nine are losing money or.
00:44:37.178 - 00:44:38.954, Speaker B: Eight or nine are still profitable.
00:44:39.034 - 00:44:40.098, Speaker A: Still profitable. Okay.
00:44:40.186 - 00:44:56.102, Speaker B: But they're barely hanging on. They're just not, they're not. They're not making fistful money. They're certainly not adding bitcoin into their balance sheet to hold long term. Where it gets trickier then is okay. These miners, they're dependent on the price staying at where they are. And a lot of them actually have a very mixed fleet.
00:44:56.102 - 00:45:25.142, Speaker B: So the profitable miners are not only those that have cheaper electricity, they're those that actually have the newer generation machines. So you have miners out there that haven't refreshed their fleet or they're just running older generation equipment. Right. So those will start capitulating quicker than some of the newer gen equipment as well. And then the other last piece is how much debt they have on the books. So in addition to just having to pay the electrical bills, how much they have to pay for their liabilities, I.
00:45:25.158 - 00:45:55.134, Speaker A: Would not want to be running. I would not want to run a bitcoin miner. This sounds very, this sounds very tricky to forecast all this stuff out. Let's play this out a little further. So I have a couple maybe, like second order implication questions that come out of this. The first is if you're basically defaulting on a lot of your purchase orders to the manufacturers, does that mean the, the manufacturers, like maybe a micro bt or a bit main become in trouble? In trouble? Or they're so well capitalized and have so much money that they'll be completely fine.
00:45:55.254 - 00:45:59.982, Speaker C: Their margins are so wide that I have absolutely no fear at all. Like, if you look at where they.
00:45:59.998 - 00:46:02.390, Speaker A: I mean, obviously, like a technology just fine.
00:46:02.462 - 00:46:37.068, Speaker C: Like, difference. Yeah, they. Maybe they have to source, like, different component parts at different manufacturers. Like, you know, they're using resistors from a few different places and maybe like one resistor is more expensive than the other or whatever, but like, overall if you look at the levels that they sold machines at, like, they used to sell them at $1,000 a machine, less than $1,000 a machine. And if you look at where they're selling them, like, I feel very confident that they're doing fine and they're going to, like most people, like, when you order machines, you have to put a deposit down. My bet is that they've already covered their margin with a deposit, if I had to guess.
00:46:37.236 - 00:46:50.274, Speaker B: Yeah. So I love that you brought this up, because I think one of the true signs of, like, actual capitulation across the market is when the manufacturers are feeling the pain. And right now they certainly aren't right. They're still selling at very frothy margins.
00:46:51.414 - 00:47:13.246, Speaker A: Wasn't bitmain feeling the pain back in, like, 2019? Oh, maybe that wasn't actually financial pain. I think that was more like they had human in house fighting. Yeah, in house, in house pain. Yeah, got it. What about the price of bitcoin? What are the second order implications if all these miners. Okay, so you've got all these purchase orders that you have to pay for. You've got billions of dollars worth of debt.
00:47:13.246 - 00:47:26.038, Speaker A: You say, holy shit, let's start selling more bitcoin. More and more bitcoin starts getting sold off into the market. The Twitter narrative is that, okay, this really hurts the price of bitcoin. What is the maybe actual impact on the price of bitcoin here?
00:47:26.206 - 00:47:57.702, Speaker B: I also really like this question, too, because I think the irony is the impact of bitcoin miners selling is very tiny. So the new amount of bitcoins issued to the miners every day is about 900 bitcoins a day. And that number is only dropping every halving. So the amount of sell pressure from miners is very tiny. But what happens is when you have these narratives, it's the sentiment and the narratives that really drive the price action. It's like, oh, the miners are selling, then we should be selling, too. And I think that is actually what causes the real sell pressure and kind of the market sentiment.
00:47:57.838 - 00:48:07.414, Speaker A: I was trying to do some mental math on what small percentage of the market and the volume that actually is, but I wasn't able to do the mental math in time.
00:48:07.454 - 00:48:19.094, Speaker B: Yeah, it's 144 blocks a day, and you only get 6.25 bitcoins a block. So you get 900 bitcoins a day. That's what miners make. So they're selling 100% of what they're making. That's a very small volume.
00:48:19.254 - 00:48:34.846, Speaker A: Yeah. Is this the end of, do you think this is largely the end of, like, ASIC backed loans, right? Asics have such a high beta to a highly volatile asset. And I'm assuming you guys are both shaking your head, but I'm going to finish the question, which is the end.
00:48:34.870 - 00:48:36.782, Speaker B: Of investment greediness, of course.
00:48:36.878 - 00:49:08.130, Speaker A: No, I'm just. No, I guess I'm just like, like, what is the process, the liquidation process for an ASIC? Look, like if I, if I capitalize alone, maybe I don't fully understand how this works actually, but, like, if I capitalize alone and my, my collateral is like a bunch of asics, and then I, like, can't pay that back, and then Cassidy's like, all right, well, give me your asics. I imagine it's actually a total pain in the ass to go collect a bunch of asics and go, like, find a site. So, like, what just seems like a tricky process.
00:49:08.242 - 00:49:18.282, Speaker C: It's definitely a tricky process, which is why you try not to write underwrite loans that you think might default so that you don't have to go and repo the machines. It's like really the first step in what a concept.
00:49:18.458 - 00:49:19.734, Speaker A: What a concept.
00:49:21.034 - 00:49:22.298, Speaker B: Although I will say that there are.
00:49:22.306 - 00:49:48.332, Speaker C: A number of folks in the states who offer Mifi Sigback loans, that they actually structure it as a bankruptcy deal from the get go. Not like, I mean, it is. They do hope that the person defaults. Right. And that's definitely something that we'll pick up, I imagine kind of like, as we get into this, the capitulation and we start to see the iceberg tip. But, yeah, at a high level. I don't think that this is the end of ASIC backed loans.
00:49:48.332 - 00:50:33.244, Speaker C: I think that this is the first step of mini in the learning curve. And like, this was a huge, huge lesson in terms of, like, how to analyze risk and how quickly things can change and how volatile the space still is and like to throw your models out the window and prepare for a doomsday event and then underwrite your loan as if you are prepared for that doomsday event and your loan will be fine. And said Doomsday event. That's really the only way for this product to work. And it's going to take iterations. I think, like for foundry and for Galaxy, it has been a bit easier for us than some of the other players in the industry because we mine and have a very good understanding of the economics ourselves and have seen and been around the block a time or two. So we've seen how quickly things have changed.
00:50:33.244 - 00:50:41.644, Speaker C: But, you know, not everyone had that experience, and there's definitely some. Some learning there. Learning by learning by doing is what I would say.
00:50:41.944 - 00:50:42.464, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:50:42.544 - 00:51:01.170, Speaker B: Yeah. I think experience is a key word. I don't think Asic backed loans are gonna disappear. I think it's gonna be. The underwriting's gonna be very different. And to Cassie's point, I think we had the benefit of experience on our side, where at least I can speak from our group. Where we stopped financing last November, like we saw the warning signs, doesn't mean we came out completely unscathed.
00:51:01.170 - 00:51:24.282, Speaker B: There are some pains right across our loan book, but it's much lighter than some of the other groups out there. And we had the benefit of minor financing has been around a long time, actually, it's been around in China. So this isn't the first time Babel finance really pushed. You're infamous for doing this. So having made these mistakes in the past, we kind of learned from them and it's part of being a minor.
00:51:24.458 - 00:51:41.294, Speaker A: Let's talk about M and A. Where to take this? While I'm thinking of the question, I'll toss the easy question at you, Cassie. Does Sam Bankman Fried and FTX acquire more or less than two minors?
00:51:43.594 - 00:52:25.068, Speaker C: I like the question. I wonder if he'll break into the space. I'm actually pretty bearish on M and A, to be honest. I think that, like, most of the miners worth like, acquiring and buying outright are actually doing quite fine. The miners that you want to be acquiring, that you want to like, you know, merge with, are the ones that have a low cost power contract in place over a long term. They have new gen machines, like, they don't have tons of liabilities and, or they have a strong and healthy balance sheet, and if they have those things and they're probably going to come out of this okay. In terms of, like, acquisitions, people will acquire what, you know, is essentially liquidated, but I don't think companies themselves will be like, bought out.
00:52:25.068 - 00:52:26.492, Speaker C: There may be like, I'm sure that there's.
00:52:26.548 - 00:52:26.836, Speaker B: So you'll.
00:52:26.860 - 00:52:47.534, Speaker A: You'll have a fire sale on like, on asics or something like that, but you're not just gonna have like, et cetera. Okay, got it. Got it. I guess, like, yeah, when you, when you put it like that, I think that makes a lot of sense. It's like, why consolidate? Maybe. And it's like, the only reason to consolidate is maybe. Maybe if you have a super valuable mining site or you have a really, really, really nice long term ten year contract on electricity.
00:52:47.534 - 00:52:54.118, Speaker A: I don't really know how electricity contracts work. But, like, if you have those in place, but aside from that, like, you don't really.
00:52:54.206 - 00:52:54.886, Speaker C: Right.
00:52:55.070 - 00:52:59.038, Speaker A: There's not. Yeah. Okay. Kevin, would you agree with that?
00:52:59.206 - 00:53:12.730, Speaker B: Yeah, I think my prediction beats zero. So I think Sam's already made his bet. I think this is public. He's already invested in mining groups. I think they're going to be the ones that kind of. He's made his bets in money already.
00:53:12.842 - 00:53:19.386, Speaker A: And he's excited for the frantic text from Kevin being like, edit that out. I'm kidding. Names.
00:53:19.410 - 00:53:31.362, Speaker B: So, you know. But, yeah, FTX has dabbled with money in the past, or Alameda has. It wasn't fun for them. They were part of the trying to ban casualties. So, yeah.
00:53:31.458 - 00:53:42.530, Speaker A: Let me ask just a bigger question, Kevin. Do you think there's going to be. Would you agree with Cassie that there probably actually won't be that much consolidation in m and A? Or you think there's. You're maybe more pro m and a pro consolidation?
00:53:42.722 - 00:54:23.662, Speaker B: I think a lot of it depends on the market. If money economics improve and then the capital markets, once again, are very frothy and healthy, again, people are rewarded, sometimes not in a healthy manner, to acquire as much as possible to boost their hash rate figures and their bitcoin production numbers, so to speak. So there may be some deals there in that scenario, but I think the more likely one is, like, certain distressed assets. So not necessarily buying the facility and operations outright, because you don't want to inherit all the issues of a site that just failed, like Cassie was saying. But the miners, right. They still work at any other site, assuming they're in good condition. Transformers and a lot of electrical equipment that can be repurposed and reused at other sites.
00:54:23.662 - 00:54:27.526, Speaker B: So I think the equipment is actually the really interesting aspect to it, thinking.
00:54:27.550 - 00:54:52.664, Speaker A: Through something in real time here. So this might be a bad question, but could you guys ever see. All right, so you guys ever see an OPEC for bitcoin? The goal of OPEC is to coordinate and unify the price of petroleum and basically ensure the stabilization of oil markets to secure this efficient economic system of petroleum. Could you ever see something like that in bitcoin mining?
00:54:53.084 - 00:55:25.408, Speaker B: I would go the opposite end. I would say bitcoin mining has failed if it's gone that direction, because it's supposed to be ultra competitive, decentralized network, where if you aren't cost competitive or you aren't running efficiently or competitively, you are supposed to get wiped out. So the protocol and the. This is what I love about the space, the protocol is actually working exactly as intended. We actually experienced multiple doomsday type scenarios. One thing I think isn't addressed enough was bitcoin, and especially the mining network survived the nation state attack. China banned over 50%.
00:55:25.408 - 00:55:50.238, Speaker B: It was actually like 60% of the network. And the difficulty adjustment took that in stride. And after two adjustments were situation all normal again. I think when I hear OPEC and when I hear if there's going to be something like time for bitcoin, that just sounds to me like collusion. It sounds to me like you're removing a lot of the natural market incentives that make bitcoin so competitive. So I hope it doesn't go in that direction.
00:55:50.286 - 00:56:27.114, Speaker C: I also would add in the people who are around and know that they're going to be have been around for a while, know that they're going to continue to be around, to have built their operations in a way that's very sustainable. They are very pro this cleansing. They're excited for some of the froth to get wiped out and for the people who came in and were a little bit in over their skis to get wiped out, because that makes it that much more competitive for them. For a larger governing body to come in and try to shake things up, you'd have the majority of bitcoin miners, the majority of the hash rate that would be against that because it's ultimately net bad for them.
00:56:27.494 - 00:56:53.246, Speaker A: Yeah, Kevin, I was smiling as you were just saying that because when you came, I think we had dinner in September of 2021 and you were like, you expressed the same thing. You're like, yeah, I was like, china, like, what do you think? You're like, the system is working. It is working. Like, China shut down bitcoin and is actually. And it's all going as it should. The protocol is working. So I'm glad that a year later you still feel the same way.
00:56:53.430 - 00:56:55.154, Speaker C: Bitcoin takes no prisoners.
00:56:56.254 - 00:57:18.846, Speaker A: Takes no prisoners. That is true. Let's start to wrap it up with just maybe a couple final outcomes and changing industry thoughts. And I'd just be curious to get all of your takes on this. Actually, I have a couple of just hot topic issues that I want to hear your guys response to. One is, Cassie, if I could throw this to you, renewable bitcoin mining. I feel like the narrative around bitcoin is bad for the environment.
00:57:18.846 - 00:57:31.808, Speaker A: Was maybe a 2021 thing that caught a lot of the kind of normie mainstream media attention and now it's kind of died down. But like renewable bitcoin, miner interest and expansion is that growing.
00:57:31.896 - 00:58:14.496, Speaker C: It's funny how you mentioned that, like, the cycle of the new cycle, that was essentially the same cycle of, like, the capital markets, right? Like, that was a narrative that was really strong when the capital markets were really strong. And now that they've dried up, that narrative has kind of died. And occasionally it still gets picked up, but by and large, it's just very uneducated opinions that don't really understand how energy at large works or how the grid works. And so that's just a frustrating piece of that whole narrative. But that narrative will come back. We have groups that are focused on preparing for that, but I expect that that will come back full swing when the capital markets open back up.
00:58:14.660 - 00:58:35.984, Speaker A: Yeah, I think I'm hopeful that maybe one thing that happens from, I don't know if I actually want to go down this rabbit hole. Like I was going to talk about dutch farmers and ammonia and nitrogen oxide and people, it comes down to what people value and people realizing that there are some. But maybe we don't go down with.
00:58:36.064 - 00:58:55.510, Speaker C: Renewable generation is that there are just not enough renewables for everyone to be using renewable energy. And that is something that a lot of people fail to realize. So you're then offsetting with Rex or carbon credits. And to me, that's just fake. Like, you know, whatever. Like, you want to play the optics game for capital markets, for your investors, that's fine. I get it.
00:58:55.510 - 00:59:14.554, Speaker C: I understand that. But at the end of the day, you're not really solving the problem. And so to me, like, it's just like, frustrating that it gets shoved down our throat, and most of the people shoving that narrative down our throats are the ones that don't actually understand what Rex or carbon credits are and, like, what generation mix actually looks like.
00:59:15.254 - 00:59:48.834, Speaker A: Yeah, it's funny, I don't see much news around how Germany moving back into opting for coal over nuclear is so bad for the environment. Right? I don't see any of that going on right now. Let's move past before I get into too much trouble from things that I say here. Russia, electricity, energy, what's going on in Russia? And rising energy costs. How does that impact how bitcoin miners basically plan for their business and the contracts that they do? How do you guys think about just rising energy costs in general?
00:59:48.994 - 01:00:29.298, Speaker B: So I think the big change this time around is, I love when miners give us their pitch decks or talk about their projects and they're like, oh, historically, energy rates have always been at this level. It's never gone this high. And anytime someone says that it's like they've automatically jinxed it, that we're going to set a new high for electrical rates. But the main takeaway from this new, and it could be a new paradigm shift for energy rates are high for the next two years, is people are now starting to hedge out all their power. And I think bitcoin miners are also getting more sophisticated with how they can approach their ppas or power purchase agreements. They're not just buying off a grid. Open day spot market, next day spot market for power rates.
01:00:29.298 - 01:01:04.454, Speaker B: They're looking to lock in their power rates even if they have to pay a little bit of a premium that removes that upside risk. The other rabbit hole that we can briefly touch on would not go down is this is where it's really fascinating, where a lot of more of the original crypto anarchists, og bitcoiners, they'll say no, we have to control our own power. We have to go behind the meter. We're not going to take whatever the grid offers us. We're going to generate our own power. And maybe that is going to have a lot of value down the road. Maybe not this cycle, but the next or the following one, where it's going to be the energy producers that are the most competitive bitcoin miners because they control their own costs.
01:01:05.354 - 01:01:24.730, Speaker A: Does that. Maybe I should ask this in the m and a part, but I'll ask it here, which is, do you guys see that? Do you guys see the traditional oil and gas players and energy folks getting into bitcoin mining and maybe making some either through acquisitions or just their own strategies?
01:01:24.762 - 01:01:51.562, Speaker C: I think we've already seen a lot of traditional energy players who have left that industry and come in. And this one, you know, we've started to see that. I definitely think that energy players will be a part of this next wave, and that's something that they're starting to explore. And I also think that, like, rising power costs are going to be kind of like an expediter for that, right? Like, they're also feeling pain, so they're looking for additional ways to generate revenue, additional clients as well.
01:01:51.738 - 01:02:16.016, Speaker B: So I was very fortunate to have worked on a Greenwich project. For me, I got to kind of live it firsthand, see it firsthand. Just all the incredible synergies are naturally there for an energy producer that's behind the meter to be bitcoin mining. So when it sucks to be selling power, you want to be bitcoin mining and vice versa. When power is great, you're incentivized to shut down your miners. So I think it's a very natural progression. The industry is headed that way just very quietly.
01:02:16.016 - 01:02:32.432, Speaker B: You've seen some headlines and some pr slip out here and there with conocoPhillips, with their pilot programs and et cetera. I'm sure more of the big names are going to kind of come out publicly in the coming years and cycles that they themselves are going to be looking to do bitcoin mining.
01:02:32.568 - 01:02:40.364, Speaker A: Will this be like, small things? Like they've got, like, gas flaring and they put some of that excess energy into mining? Or, like, you think big mining initiatives?
01:02:41.104 - 01:02:42.408, Speaker B: I think bigger mining, really.
01:02:42.456 - 01:02:55.806, Speaker C: I think people will take small steps first. I think the newsworthy articles will probably be like, you know, they've already been mining and they feel like they haven't figured out enough to, like, have a large operation, and that's what they're announcing publicly, but I think they'll take small steps before they take big ones.
01:02:55.990 - 01:03:13.434, Speaker B: Yeah. And I think bigger is where we're headed. And I guess another key theme we can kind of very quickly point out is it's the gigawatt projects that always kind of scare me off. Like, it's actually funny. There are sizes and projects that are too big for bitcoin mining initially. Right. We talked about how expensive the capex was.
01:03:13.434 - 01:03:49.212, Speaker B: The capex is very expensive on the infrastructure side, but it's that much more expensive for the ASICs. So if you're telling me that you have a half gigawatt project or a gigawatt project you want to bring online right away and you need ASICs to fill all that, I'm like, this is nonsense. So a lot of, like, the large nuclear projects, people talk about this massive gigawatt, multi gigawatt nuclear site, they should be doing bitcoin mining. It's actually too big for bitcoin, at least for now. I think it's smaller scale projects. The pilot projects in the medium sized peaker plants, like a Greenwich, like, 100, 200 mw site, those are the ones I think you should be keeping an eye on.
01:03:49.388 - 01:04:17.878, Speaker A: I think maybe last question. Second to last question here is just like, pool distribution. I want to get your guys take on Kevin. Do you? I think foundry, I know much more maybe, about what's going on with Lido and ETH staking. Actually, right now, not as much about bitcoin mining. So this, honestly might be another fifth grade level question coming at you, but I think my understanding of the pool distributions, like foundry has 20%, amp pool has 15%, f two has like, 15%. Finance has, like, ten or 15%.
01:04:17.878 - 01:04:31.062, Speaker A: Is that consolidating? So, like, maybe. What's the state of, like, pool distribution in, let's say, three to five years from now? A couple big players, more distribution. What does that look like?
01:04:31.158 - 01:04:38.514, Speaker B: All right, so the first thing is the pool business sucks. So there's, like, little to no money to be made in the pool business. So I don't see that many new players coming in.
01:04:39.864 - 01:04:45.320, Speaker A: What is the pool business? This might be a whole nother topic for another episode, but what is the pool business?
01:04:45.432 - 01:05:23.164, Speaker B: In a paragraph, the pool business is every day praying that our pool has good luck, that we mine enough bitcoins to pay our customers. Otherwise, we're paying out of our own balance sheet. But jokes aside, we treated it as an ecosystem plan, and essentially, it's our donation to the space. We knew that it was really important for to address the narrative that China controlled mining. We didn't think China was going to ban mining, so we set out to build a pool two years ago because 90% of the global hashrate was concentrated in China. And you did see that China tried shutting down these pools, and for a while, miners couldn't connect to the front end of these pools. And some of these pools did go down.
01:05:23.164 - 01:05:46.862, Speaker B: There was a centralization risk there. Now, bitcoin did work itself around that, but part of that also was our pool coming online and having a reputable pool where people can trust, but their payouts are what they expect, and it's reliable. I do think there may be a couple more western players that pop up over time, but I don't think there's going to be too many players. I think there may be some more consolidation here and there. It's just a really, really tough business.
01:05:46.918 - 01:06:31.482, Speaker C: It's a relationship business, so you have to have money to get that started and then maintain the relationships. But it's been a really good relationship business for all the pools who've been around and are doing it. They've been able to expand and have tons of business of science. Foundry is a great example of that. They're doing tons of things in the space right now, which is really cool to see. Kevin, I actually had a question for you kind of on online hash rate, as we started to see some kind of come offline in looking at some of the smaller pools, have you had customers who are at smaller pools that are now coming to you saying it was just getting a little bit riskier for us at the size of the pool, and they're redirecting their hash rate towards you guys, you know, have you guys seen, have you had customers come to you that new customers in the last couple of months?
01:06:31.618 - 01:06:56.310, Speaker B: Yeah, that's actually a really fascinating question. And I think, yes, we have seen that. I think there's a very wide range of bitcoin miners. There are some that love going towards smaller pools because they're rooting for more distribution at the pool level. And once again, this is all optics, right? In the past, Bitmain has had over 50% of the global hashrate. From a pool standpoint. They just had it in two different pool brands.
01:06:56.310 - 01:07:19.234, Speaker B: They had ampoolandbtc.com dot. No one really cared. And we don't actually own the hashrate. If we're ever up to anything nefarious, people can just move their hashrate off instantly. So with that kind of disclaimer there, we've noticed that some miners out there, and this is actually very common with chinese miners, they couldn't care less about centralization. I mean, given that most of them from CCP and whatnot, right.
01:07:19.234 - 01:07:49.468, Speaker B: They actually prefer whoever's the top pool because they view it as, oh, they're at least going to be solvent to make sure I have my payouts the next day. But what we have seen changes because so much hash rate has gravitated toward North America. It's less so about who's the biggest size, it's who's the most reliable, who's the most professional, as far as we have our SoC audits. Right. We also have a reputable brand in being a DCG subsidiary. And I like to go to different parties and go eat free food along with you. Right.
01:07:49.468 - 01:08:02.164, Speaker B: So I think it is relationship business and kind of the perks of knowing who you're working with and having someone you can trust, that's the first thing people look at. And I don't think the miners really care so much about this pool. Is x size or x percentage of the network?
01:08:02.324 - 01:08:23.494, Speaker A: I'm going to. Cassie, great question there. Last question for both of you is what are the signs that you're looking for? Kevin, you said we're at the tip of the iceberg in terms of capitulation. Cassie, I'd throw this question to you first. Like, what are the signs of max capitulation in your mind in the bitcoin mining space? When will you know that we've hit rock bottom?
01:08:23.654 - 01:08:26.582, Speaker C: Yeah, it's hard to say how you.
01:08:26.598 - 01:08:36.514, Speaker A: Define rock bottom, but like, basically, Cassie, try to time. Tell me when the market is going to bottle. Yeah, tell me when the bottom is coming.
01:08:37.694 - 01:09:19.323, Speaker C: I'm hodling all the way up and down with all the other minors, so feeling the pain, too. But, you know, I would say, like, I. You know, the more people that are coming to us, like, desperately asking for money, like, hey, can you get on a call in the next hour and talk to me about, you know, lending against, like, X, Y, and z? Hey, like, can you underwrite my whole site? I think, like, that is going to be very, very telling for us. I would say, like, the more distressed deals that we see that are coming across our desks, the more liquidation, I think. Really, like, when the purchase orders start hitting, like, the luxors and the procurement providers of the world in North America specifically will be a very, very telling sign.
01:09:20.343 - 01:09:56.362, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's impossible to know when, if we will hit the bottom. But the bottoms historically have looked like hash rate and difficulty dropping in a serious manner. This was November and December of 2018. There were, like, five to 10% difficulty drops back then when prices got too low and miners had to shut off. And the next key point we touched on earlier was if the manufacturers start capitulating or if they start feeling the pain, I don't think they're going to capitulate, but if they start having to fire sale their miners at severe discounts, and right now, we're nowhere close to that.
01:09:56.458 - 01:09:59.994, Speaker A: Awesome. Cassie, Kevin, any last thoughts as we wrap this up?
01:10:00.154 - 01:10:19.192, Speaker C: No last thoughts for me. I guess one last thought. You know, some of this was pretty bearish. I think that I just like to reiterate that long term, I'm very bullish and, like, bitcoin's going nowhere. Mining is not going anywhere either. So we have a bright future ahead. Just a couple of roadblocks in the way.
01:10:19.368 - 01:10:21.444, Speaker B: The protocol is working as intended.
01:10:22.024 - 01:10:37.744, Speaker A: I love it. That's a great way to end. Guys, this was cassie. Kevin, we will put links to both your twitters in the show notes and some other resources. This has been an awesome conversation, and thank you, you, for helping us fifth graders understand what is going on in the bitcoin market.
01:10:37.864 - 01:10:39.624, Speaker C: Yeah, thanks so much for having us.
01:10:39.744 - 01:10:40.144, Speaker B: Thanks, guys.
