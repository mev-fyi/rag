00:00:07.800 - 00:01:02.910, Speaker A: All right, everyone, we have a really important episode of Empire today. Today we are sitting down with Jordy from Salini Capital and Mika X parafy, one of the smartest people I've ever met in crypto and also a writer of a very good blog out there that you guys should check out. Today we're talking about UST and Luna and Terra, obviously, probably the most important thing going on in crypto today. This is not an episode to dance on anyone's grave. This is not an episode of pointing blame at anyone. I think we're really just here to revisit, like, how the hell did this happen? What happened? And really, more importantly, some lessons learned. And really, where do we go from here? So just to kick it off, maybe, Mika, if I could pick on you for this really broad general question, what did happen here this week aside, not talking about this specific week, but what happened here? How did we get here? How did this thing, UsT and Luna, get so big?
00:01:03.022 - 00:01:49.392, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, if we look at the sort of current problem, stable coins have been growing very a lot over the past couple of years. It's the use case that tends to go only to the right and up. And there's a few different models of doing this. And the Luna and terra model is perhaps like one that's the sketchiest or like the most complex in terms of how you justify how it's able to maintain its peg, particularly in adverse situations. The market we've been in has been sort of very positive and very forgiving on sort of the downside risk before the last couple of months. And I think the way we got here is that now we're in a different type of market than we've been before. And Luna is in like a really different type of market than it's ever been before at scale.
00:01:49.392 - 00:02:37.716, Speaker B: And what we saw, essentially was the first time that it's really being tested and sort of having to end failing that process a lot. But it starts with very simple things, I think, where they're just more sellers than buyers. Right. And that happens every now and then to stablecoins, and the stable coin goes off its peg. But really, when that happens, the arbitrage mechanisms kick in. And I think it's quite obvious that here the Luna arbitrage, that how it's supposed to maintain its peg, it sort of didn't kick in. And immediately we went into this process where we fall back on trying to find these big buyers who are able to keep the market price now good, but not really like the algorithmic side of the Luna system didn't really, like, ever really take over here.
00:02:37.716 - 00:02:41.236, Speaker B: And I think that's sort of how we ended up where we are right now.
00:02:41.380 - 00:03:16.854, Speaker C: Yeah, definitely. There is this concept of getting too big to be able to manage. And as this thing grew and grew and, like, a lot more money came in, that was not necessarily, you know, convinced about the ecosystem. They were just maybe trying to get some anchor yield. The size of the door to get to exit was not changing. And at some point, what happened over the weekend is people were withdrawing, causing other people to get scared, wanting to withdraw. And then the mechanism, like Mika said, there's like a mechanism in place supposed to hold the peg.
00:03:16.854 - 00:04:09.370, Speaker C: There's some constraints around the mechanism. We can get into the details later, but there's a daily cap on how much can be absorbed. There is also just a cap on how much liquidity there is for Luna, which is the other side of the equation, because the arb to get out is through Luna that causes this cascade. And of course, the bitcoin reserves was supposed to be one of the defense mechanisms in place. That takes time, and I think we just didn't get to this, like, long term state that could have possibly provided a bit more stability. So, yeah, I mean, ultimately it grew at a pace that was very rapid and, you know, we really were not able to get to the long term state, I think.
00:04:09.562 - 00:04:39.780, Speaker D: So. I want to ask both of you there. I mean, how did it get this big? There was a number of criticisms around, obviously this. People use the word ponzi liberally in crypto. Sometimes it is unfounded because the word ponzi is very, you know, I think people use that liberally. And I want to ask you guys, like, one, do you believe it was a ponzi? And two, how did. I mean, there's a lot of institutional capital behind this project using USD and farming it on anchor.
00:04:39.780 - 00:05:08.342, Speaker D: And I understand the yield is pretty enticing. And so we're all yield farmers in crypto, but when you see a ponzi, it's sort of like you don't want to be a taleb turkey. I played algorithmic stable coins before. ESD, DST basis, coin. You understand that at some point these things can collapse pretty rapidly. So I want to maybe start there. A, do you think this epancy? If so, why? And then what did other people believe that wasn't a ponzi? To put so much capital risk, I.
00:05:08.358 - 00:05:58.824, Speaker B: Don'T necessarily view it as a ponzi, although there are elements of that in it. I would say that the biggest misconception is just an optimism around the previous stablecoins. You always have someone absorb the downside risk, and here you have Luna holders who do that. But you have something a bit more than what EsdNO, these other algorithmic stablecoins had, which is you have this blockchain with like a lot of things apparently happening on it, a lot of economic activity that you can extract rent from. And that economic activity is the one that really backs it. And I think there was like too much positivity around. Is that economics activity sort of real? And is that something that actually makes people really excited to hold Luna when there is a situation like this where you're going to have to like, mint more and you're going to struggle with the peg?
00:06:00.204 - 00:06:46.292, Speaker C: I've been accused of using the word ponzi very liberally. I'm definitely one of those on that side. I did use the word Ponzi to describe UsT. I don't mean it as a scam, like someone is trying to rug pull. There are actual scams out there, and I talk about there being a spectrum, and you have bitconnect on one side and things like hex that are kind of close to that side, and then on the other side you kind of have more sustainable ecosystems. I think it was a Ponzi trying to not become a ponzi. Basically, when you're in the game of creating money, you want this incredibly difficult end state to be reached, where people view your coin or your token as money, as the end state.
00:06:46.292 - 00:07:35.530, Speaker C: UST. I can get paid in ust and I can just spend ust. And I don't need to think about converting it into something. There's nothing to convert it into. It's just UST. And I think people also have the same view about bitcoin or ethereum, and those are also on that path of trying to get into this end state where people just view it as base money, and they both have large communities viewing it that way. I think UST was trying to become another one of those, and they were executing well enough that they managed to really escape the usual constraints of one $2 billion, and they got to tens of billions of dollars because of just how well they were executing on that path.
00:07:35.530 - 00:07:47.876, Speaker C: But ultimately, if you don't manage to convince people that they don't need to convert out of UST, that UST is the money, then things can collapse is kind of what we saw.
00:07:47.940 - 00:08:29.334, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that's a really good observation. My foregone conclusion after participating in a lot of these, like EST, DST and basecoin was pure game theory. Kind of doesn't work. You need to have like, utility. Usability drives stability. And I think that speaks to your point, Jordy, which is, I think Terra started as a project, said, we're going to have this wallet called Chai to support e commerce, support commerce. And that felt to me like a different approach in a pretty healthy go to market, which is if you can become a usable stablecoin in Korea and other markets, then people want to have ust if you get discounts, if you have a number of perks across like a merchant network.
00:08:29.334 - 00:08:56.564, Speaker D: And then I think that worked reasonably well up to a point. And then it felt like, kind of like over the last twelve months, it just went from being with anchor in particular and mirror, it just became way more speculative. Speculative than a lot of large players. Like just using UST to farm and get that sweet 20% APY on anchor, which is not sustainable.
00:08:56.904 - 00:09:20.638, Speaker A: But I think it's not just about it being speculative, because there's a lot in crypto that's speculative, obviously. So UST took the approach that a decent, decentralized, stable needed utility. Right. And a lot of the other decentralized stables that you mentioned, Santee, haven't taken that approach. And the utility they thought was going to be chai, but I don't think anyone's really spending that much ust. So, yeah, it turned into. So anchor was this, like, was the, was the best app for that, for that.
00:09:20.638 - 00:09:34.654, Speaker A: And I turned Santi's comment into a question of like, did anchor cause this flood of capital into anchor? Did that cause UST supply to get too far over its skis? And did that have any sort of impact on what we're seeing today?
00:09:35.474 - 00:10:31.308, Speaker C: Absolutely. I mean, that was the main, I think, look, I don't think it was orchestrated. I think it was by accident. If you kind of look at the history of this thing, what happened is they had this during the whole defi bull run and nobody cared because 20% yields were not attractive. And so for a lot of last year, anchor was not necessarily some focus of the ecosystem at all. And then as defi yields went down and you have this stable yield that just stays put at some point, I think unexpectedly, the use case of Anker became so large and the senior age that they were making by being able to print ust for real money became so sizable that they just let it keep going. So in terms of the yield itself being unsustainable, I'm not sure that that's what caused this current issue.
00:10:31.308 - 00:10:39.484, Speaker C: I think it might be more what you said, that basically it just got very large and uncontrollable and unable to take off supply.
00:10:39.644 - 00:11:34.540, Speaker B: I would say that utility is, there's sort of maybe a mix here, which is that utility brings some sort of stability to the stablecoin. But I think what we've seen actually is sort of the opposite. Utility brings demand, but when we're talking about a stable coin, it seems to be like the stable coin is only as good as the thing that backs it. And what is that? Like collateral? And here, where then it's the sort of economic activity on Luna and the willingness of people to hold Luna through, like these minting periods especially, and versus something like dai, where it's so straightforward, where it's always backed by collateral. So you never have the issue of really going off of the peg, at least on the downside. Like, there are nuances there that need to be thought of both ways, actually. But you don't see that problem on the upside at all, because when you go up and the demand is too high for the $1 price to be $1, you can just always mint more and put the price down.
00:11:34.540 - 00:11:50.654, Speaker B: So it's a very easy problem to have. You can react to that volatility, but you can't really react to the downside one in the same way. So I would say that utility is actually the wrong way to think about it in terms of stability. Utility is just something that creates demand, but it doesn't guarantee anything about stability.
00:11:51.434 - 00:12:26.684, Speaker D: So let's talk about the collateral for a second here. Initially, it was just Luna backing this. And maybe just why would people believe that Luna has any value in the first place, is question number one. And then question number two is obviously most recently, LFG decided to buy all this bitcoin to as collateral. Of course, the criticism there as well, you're using even bitcoin as a very volatile asset that can swing 80% through cycles. So it puts into question the actual soundness of that collateral.
00:12:26.984 - 00:13:30.110, Speaker C: In terms of collateral, I think when you have the chain backing it, it's this nebulous concept, because who knows how much a chain is worth and it's fine when it's small. I think at some point, because of all the anchor money coming in, they were able to raise a lot of money through their reserves and through open market operations. And they were just deciding, do we buy stablecoin here? Which is this concept that some people like, some people don't like Dai, for example, is obviously backed by USDC. And then what's the point of Dai? There was this question to be asked. They took the approach that we can just use bitcoin as the most decentralized form of money to back things. In a way, you can see it as like they started being long bitcoin in a leveraged fashion that can get liquidated if bitcoin price drops, for example. That's not exactly the case because it's not like they're fully collateralized by bitcoin.
00:13:30.110 - 00:14:02.804, Speaker C: It was just a small portion of the UST, but there is that element. So the upside was there. I think it was a bit of a gamble. I mentioned that word gamble, and I got a lot of heat for it. But when you're looking at end states and you say, well, if it three xs, then we're over collateralized and everything's fine. No one's ever going to try to attack us because we're going to have this war chest of tens of thousands of bitcoin. And in the year 2023, 2024, that bitcoin could be so valuable that our stable coin is really backed.
00:14:02.804 - 00:14:14.124, Speaker C: But yeah, we never really got to see that long distance upside because the macro environment is so tough right now that we just got the downside.
00:14:15.144 - 00:14:25.264, Speaker D: This is kind of a reminder everything is kind of a social construct. So you look at a us dollar and says it's backed by the faith of the US government, which has.
00:14:25.844 - 00:14:35.144, Speaker A: This does remind you, awful lot of fiat, right print and debase to remain solvent, bring more people in until it breaks again, and then continue to bring more people in and more capital.
00:14:35.764 - 00:15:10.554, Speaker D: That's my point. I think theoretically, these things are pretty fascinating experiments. But time and time again we see that they haven't really worked in crypto because we are still in a very early, fragile state of this market, which we can talk about. Like there are rumors of market manipulation, there are rumors of folks seeing an attack vector and exploiting that. DeFi is a very adversarial environment. So maybe if we can transition a little bit to that and understanding. Mika, you mentioned earlier that kind of the mechanism didn't work.
00:15:10.554 - 00:15:22.654, Speaker D: So let's dive deeper into that, because there are kind of rumors out there circulating that there was someone out there, out there, came out pretty well and profited a ton from this fallout.
00:15:22.814 - 00:16:04.260, Speaker B: Yeah. Having thought about this a little bit, just who the attacker was and what they really did and how horrible that was, I sort of come to a conclusion that ultimately, if you think about the big picture of Luna and this system sort of going forward in the future. This was ultimately like relatively a tame attack. You're starting with, when you were looking at the on chain data, you start with this 85 million swap that starts to put the curve pool into imbalance, and then slowly the curve pool starts to get more and more into imbalance. And then you start seeing that, okay, there will be like a pretty big war here. I think that's where people underestimated. They thought that if it just went off a peg a little bit, we've seen that before, that's fine.
00:16:04.260 - 00:16:53.228, Speaker B: I don't think they really realized that the market started to be very, very imbalanced there and that the amounts to protect this will have to be very large and that it would be like a real, real issue. So, yeah, I think it was. Ultimately, the way I think about the attack is just that it wasn't that serious. You would expect something much worse to happen in the future. At scale, the market conditions could be much more adversarial against you. We could be in a much longer bear market with much longer draw or harder drawdowns. So the fact that it couldn't sort of really survive this in its current state wasn't really, to me, like a vote of confidence on algorithmic stablecoins, because whether or not someone made a lot of money, but it's still a very small attack by someone compared to the things you could imagine in the future, these systems haven't been able to take.
00:16:53.356 - 00:17:41.154, Speaker A: So does this feel like, I mean, there are a lot of conspiracies floating around, so there's everything from, like, there's a good chance that some very large tradfi fund put on a massive BTC short, used it to break the UST peg as a way to realize the gain. There's, there's. I think Charles Hoskinson just shared something on Twitter this morning about Blackrock and Citadel borrowing 100k bitcoin from Gemini. They swapped that into that into Ust, and this was like all a lead up to a big attack. Then there's something that's maybe a little more reasonable, like, you know, there's just some liquidity that was kind of pulled from four pool and it wasn't a Citadel, but some maybe just a fun taking advantage of an inefficient market. So what maybe. Jordy, I'd ask you, like, what seems like the likely situation here?
00:17:41.694 - 00:17:45.782, Speaker C: I think it's extremely unlikely that Citadel and Blackrock are getting involved in this.
00:17:45.838 - 00:17:48.354, Speaker A: But it makes a good. It makes a good story, Jordy.
00:17:48.694 - 00:18:43.834, Speaker C: It makes a really good Reddit. Wall street bets. Citadel is kind of like the Darth Vader of the ecosystem, but I am extremely confident that that's not what happened. Now, whether there was some defi native whale that found an opportunity to start profiting and saw weakness, kind of like a George Soros style, it's possible it's kind of 50 50. I can also see the case where there's just this cascade of people being worried because other people are worried, and that just kind of builds on itself, because when this whole thing started over the weekend, I was watching extremely closely the beginning. We just had maybe like, 100 million, 200 million leaving anchor, and around 300 million people that I know started buzzing and just saying, okay, I'm going to take the 30, 40 bips hit at the time, which was like 99.7 on UST.
00:18:43.834 - 00:19:40.494, Speaker C: And I can just imagine that cascading where it's like, well, okay, now it's 1% and it's 2%. I think at some point, just the mechanism between, like, Luna and Ust and what. How that works started to get poked at in ways that were only theoretical before and for the first time became practical. Like, what happens if. And I was, I guess, a bit surprised that there were not contingency plans really in place. And it all kind of felt very haphazard in terms of how do we respond and, like, you know, jump trying to possibly provide some liquidity into the different curve pools or on binance. And then we just had so much fluctuation that I think once the trust got lost, it was hard to put it back in.
00:19:40.914 - 00:21:05.104, Speaker D: This is like a classic bank run, which is. It's sort of like there comes an inflection point that everything cascades dramatically. We saw the peg dropped to, like, I think it was 75 or, like, kind of mid, like, 80, and then it went all the way back up to, like, close to 90. And then obviously after that, it just collapsed to where it is now. Which is, what is it, 30, $0.40 now? But to your point, Jordy, I want to, like, maybe dive deeper into maybe two questions if you're an investor, like, what did you have to believe? Because you always kind of stress test these things and, like, you do simulations, hopefully, like, why do you think so much institutional capital was just kind of playing in this taleb Turkey musical chairs game? Did they just never believe that this type of bank run would have been possible? Like, how concentrated were these pools where if one large, fun, like, yanked, it would have caused this massive degradation of trust that it spiraled out of control, or was it a very small kind of. I'm just kind of curious to understand if you're a fan, like, why would you play in this system in the first place?
00:21:05.264 - 00:21:49.774, Speaker C: I think, you know, there's two approaches that funds take and the type of fund matters. If you're very, very safe, very institutional, you're not even going to touch it. You're just going to say, like, this is not fully backed. Theoretically, there's some way to get out, but I don't want to touch it. And then you have sort of like this gray area where you want to profit if there is like an edge. And I would put a lot of funds in this category, like all the Alameda jumps, different funds, where you basically look at it as an opportunity to get out before other people get out. As long as you understand where the exit is, you can enter the building and know where the fire escape is and still get some yield.
00:21:49.774 - 00:22:46.918, Speaker C: And that's, I guess, to the point of it being an adversarial environment. That's one of the things I like the least about DeFi is it is this sort of, you know, some people have more information than others, some people have more technical expertise than others. And especially with an app that just lets you click a button and deposit your money as a savings account, you don't necessarily have the level of sophistication to understand where the exits are. And I think what we saw was that most of the wallets did not exit, and most of the really large institutions exited because they were the ones really kind of on top of it. So just to answer your question, as a fund, it makes sense to participate if you understand how the structure is, but it is very adversarial. And of course, retail can often be the last to move.
00:22:47.086 - 00:24:08.772, Speaker B: I think as a fund, if you really believe in this, you do have to believe in only really two steps here, which is the first one is that there won't be any short term selling so large that you won't be able to stop it and stop the beginning of a bank run. And the second is once you stop that, the Luna token holders, essentially, you'll be able to sell your ust back to them and create this arbitrage, which now hasn't really existed. People have used the word sort of incorrectly, but you imagine that you're able to play this arbitrage, like, just over and over again, and it's completely fine. But the problem I think there really comes from just the fact that you can look at the numbers and say that, okay, the UST supply, it's over 10,000,000,015 to 18 billion, whatever, and then you look at how much were these big players right now at the liquidity event able to absorb, and it wasn't a big, it wasn't a large percentage of that. So if you, you didn't really have to imagine a lot of the supply really moving until you realized you would be in big trouble. And once you were in big trouble, then you get the cascading effects very quickly. So I think it sort of is a weird underestimation of how much money can move and how much on your confidence to just hold the peg and hold the line and make sure everything's okay and then being able to exit that position down the line again once you've taken that arb for yourself.
00:24:08.948 - 00:24:32.384, Speaker A: Mika, do you think when you look back at something like Bernie Madoff, and I really don't want to, actually, I don't love using the word ponzi here, because something like Bernie Madoff is a Ponzi scheme like, this feels different to me. It's kind of maybe like intentions behind it, good intentions versus bad intentions. But. But Bernie Madoff got. He was running that for like 17 years until it got. And the reason it got uncovered is because the market absolutely shit the bed in 2008. Right.
00:24:32.384 - 00:24:56.884, Speaker A: And so, Mika, I'd throw this back to you of how long could this have gone on? And is there a way this could have been successful if the market wasn't in the condition that it's in right now, where equities are down 60%? The Fed is yanking interest rates up. The CPI print again today exceeded expectations. Could this have gone on longer if all of this stuff wasn't in the condition that it's in?
00:24:57.044 - 00:25:39.094, Speaker B: The answer is yes. And I think when you're thinking about the success of Luna, you really have to separate into short term, midterm, and long term, where short term, it's just, are you able to find buyers to match the sellers at any given moment? And that's the short term game you're playing. You might actually, like, succeed at this right now. Get the peg back. Everything's sort of semi okay, even though the reputational hit is large, but you might win that game. Then in the midterm, the game becomes a lot more like, okay, if the crypto market and the market overall is very negative, it's probably more likely that you would see this kind of bank run at some point down the line. So, yeah, you may save it today, but you're not able to save it for three months consecutively from this moment.
00:25:39.094 - 00:26:27.916, Speaker B: I would imagine if the market is very poor, even if you save it today, you're not going to be just able to save it down the line in the same way anymore. So you need that positive market really, over the midterm to make it successful. Then in the long term, it really is this question of whether or not it's possible to build such a robust economy on a blockchain where that economic activity without significant collateral itself is so useful and so highly valued that any stablecoin based on that activity as collateral really is able to succeed. So I think in all these short term, mid term, long term, you have very, very different scenarios that could play out, and I think they would have played out in each variation, just depending on the global macro environment, basically.
00:26:28.100 - 00:27:27.944, Speaker D: So I'm curious, what does this mean for the future of decentralized stablecoins? I stopped playing in these games after ESt and DST. For me, that was just like the, it just was clear that it was very difficult to pull off these, these things, and particularly because it's very adversarial. But, Mika, you talk about, like, and Jordy, you also mentioned this, like, you were kind of surprised that there were no kind of contingency plans in place by the foundation or just a group of that. I mean, I'm sure that if you're part of the Terra team, like, you would have thought through these simulations, what kind of contingency, like, if you were to build something like terra again, and I'm sure someone will try, because in crypto, people control c, control v all the time. Like, what kind of contingency plans, what kind of different architectural design kind of things would you do differently? Or would you just say, this is not possible, stop doing it?
00:27:28.964 - 00:28:50.646, Speaker C: Well, first of all, we've had the control c, control v, right? We have Trondao. This stuff just came out. We even have something on near, although it seems to be not as aggressive. So maybe they're not trying to create this exact flyable effect that Luna had, but maybe let's take a step back and just talk about what is the vision for decentralized stablecoins? And then we can think about will people keep trying to do it? So just broadly speaking, you have centralized stable coins, USDC and USDT can even possibly be put in that category where you have like, a real world bank that is physically keeping the money, supposedly to be able to exchange back and forth and of course, like, with the ethos of crypto and the cypherpunk ethos, that we don't want to deal with bankers and that kind of, like, institutional side, we just want to have, like, a free, transparent, on chain world. So there's a lot of believers in that. And that's why people keep trying to create something that doesn't rely on an actual bank account to do a conversion. And we can have a stable, I don't know, stable, but like a fiat, kind of pegged value system that we can interact with and use.
00:28:50.646 - 00:29:46.604, Speaker C: So the vision, obviously, is something that's appealing to many people in terms of the types of things that we've seen. We have the fully collateralized and over collateralized, which are the DaI maker type of model, which are more secure, but also very inefficient capital wise, it's very hard to create more dye. It needs so much backing to be able to do that. And even that has a lot of issues with the ways that things can get liquidated. Then we've had these copycats now of Luna that will probably take this as a warning, and I imagine that they're not gonna, you know, play it as fast and loose, given what they've observed. Although, you know, Justin sun might. Might surprise us because he likes to, you know, be creative.
00:29:46.604 - 00:30:13.382, Speaker C: But I think what the future holds is, you know, the next thing we'll probably look at is something like Frax, which is a hybrid model that has more ways and a kind of more complicated design to keep it stability. But we'll have to see if that has the right combination of decentralization, stability, and scalability that the ecosystem looks for.
00:30:13.558 - 00:30:40.740, Speaker A: Jordy, if you're a betting man, which I know you are, what is the likelihood that something like another decentralized stable works in the near term? Like something like fracs. So now, because to me, Santi mentioned a bunch of these decentralized stables, it feels like we're just like, okay, didn't work onto the next, didn't work onto the next. But the scale of these things keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger. And, I mean, Tera just brought this. I'm looking at the market cap right now. It's like two or 3 billion. It was 40 billion.
00:30:40.740 - 00:31:00.474, Speaker A: That's the size of Lehman brothers when they went down. That was 60 billion. Bear Stearns at their height was 25 billion. Right. So the scale of these things is absolutely massive now. So do you worry at all that we're just kind of onto the next? Onto the next? And they get bigger and bigger, and at some point, the scale of these things is like, the ripple effects are going to be too strong.
00:31:01.294 - 00:31:48.076, Speaker C: I'm very confident that that's not the case. I think this was the seminal moment that will go down in the crypto history at the point at which we stopped really believing that something that's not collateralized can work. We might. So frax is semi collateralized. It's collateralized to a certain extent, and then it allows itself to get less collateralized as its value kind of grows, let's say. So it's a very well thought out model that might break, but is not as aggressive, but also has not seen the kind of success that you mentioned, like the huge $20 to $40 billion which UsT has. I will put that down to two things.
00:31:48.076 - 00:32:54.494, Speaker C: One is do Kwan might have possibly failed in this experiment now, but he's clearly an extremely capable operator that has made many friends in powerful places that were able to really support the ecosystem and spread it across different exchanges and create this liquidity that was needed to even get it to this point. And then secondly, this anchor idea, sort of out of nowhere, I think, appeared that drew a lot of people in. Because what we don't realize as crypto natives is if you just walk outside the street, 99.9% of people don't even know what's happened unless you're living in a financial hub in the city of London or something. I don't think people out there even realize the kind of huge ripple wave that is going through the crypto market. And a lot of those people are the types that would use an app that says, you can get 20%. This is a stable coin, and they can buy in.
00:32:54.494 - 00:33:22.166, Speaker C: There's such a large gap between the crypto native world and the more retail world that was bridged by this type of savings account, that it did create this huge flywheel. I don't think we're gonna see like an $80,000,000,000.01 and like 160 billion. I think we're done because this story will always get pointed to, I don't know. Santiago, what do you think about that?
00:33:22.270 - 00:33:54.884, Speaker D: That was a great quote by someone that says, look, est and DSD, it's like there's in gang fighting. It was only DJ's. So, you know, and this was different because you now there's civilian violence, people got hurt, a lot of people got hurt. And I think we'll see how regulators react to that. I think there's going to be some regulatory action or some type of regulator is going to come out and said, hey, we need to stop this because people get hurt. And it's not just gangs against gangs. And I think you're right, Jordy.
00:33:54.884 - 00:34:36.764, Speaker D: I don't think the space is kind of ready for this stuff. It sucks to see all these people not properly understand how risky these experiments are. And it does put into question, like, we are creating better on ramps and wallets and experiences for people to play in this decentralized, what is still a wild world, like, wild west. And we need better guardrails and disclosures and disclaimers around the level of risk. Like, if you gotta ask yourself, like, you don't understand where the yield is coming from, you are the yield. Like, you earning 20% on a stable coin is paradox. Like, it's oxymoronic.
00:34:36.764 - 00:34:41.556, Speaker D: Like, it's just. It's too good to be true in many ways. Yeah.
00:34:41.580 - 00:34:47.612, Speaker A: But so was getting a $5 uber ride in. In New York, right? Today, it's dollar 50. That's just a market.
00:34:47.668 - 00:34:59.162, Speaker D: And none of these businesses would have ever gone off the ground unless you're in this free kind of cheap money. Like, over the last 20, like, over the last ten years, you've been in this qe environment. Like, without VC's subsidizing that free Uber ride, none of this would have happened.
00:34:59.178 - 00:35:07.298, Speaker A: No, I agree with you. I just pushed back. I don't think the 20% on anchor was the problem. 20% on anchor was. Was a marketing spend, and it.
00:35:07.346 - 00:35:22.882, Speaker D: Yeah, but that's a clickbait, and that's what I'm pushing back on. Like. Like, okay, like, I understand that you need to reward people, but, like, people don't rationally think this way. Like, they see 20%, they're like, oh, it's a stable coin. Like, you know, it's what could go wrong. Right?
00:35:23.058 - 00:35:36.282, Speaker A: Yeah. Here, let me. Let me. Let me put myself in a dangerous seat here, which is almost defending some of this. What would. What would you have done? So if I'm putting myself in doe seat, you got to bootstrap the hell out of this new stable coin. You're trying to do everything right.
00:35:36.282 - 00:36:12.174, Speaker A: You're putting a bunch of dollars into, like, the floating rate on anchor should have been, like, probably, I don't know, five or 6% or something like that, maybe even lower. They put it at 20% in the same way that Uber ride cost $50 today, but they're at $5 to bootstrap demand. And, like, obviously, Doe was completely crazy at some points on. On Twitter, like coming at anyone who took him down, but like he was trying to bootstrap money, basically. So the question for you guys is like, I don't know, how do you approach it differently when the vision and the scope of your project is like so grand here, Mika, maybe throw it to you.
00:36:12.524 - 00:37:03.020, Speaker B: Yeah. In a bull market, it's easy for us to, and this is maybe something that industry players, big investors could do better, is really be sophisticated about and rigorous about the mechanics and thinking about and communicating those and not backing things that they know. They essentially know. That may have holes in a way, but it's just because you can get away with those holes during a good market and everyone's sort of having fun and yeah, it's a party. So I think that that's one part that I think, like, just our industry could do a better job if I was in the UST position because, and this is just a fundamental design thing. Like, how does the thing help maintain stability? Well, it's that it has good collateral. I think what I would have done is every bit of growth and every bit of value I would have extracted out of the system, I would convert it into good collateral, which is stable coins.
00:37:03.020 - 00:37:45.380, Speaker B: Or if I don't like stable coins, at least like more and more ETH, more aggressively just all the time get that thing up there is what I did. It's like a frac situation where it covers 80 something percent of the thing and then we don't have any of these issues, then we can fight the battles on the liquidity front as much as we want and we'll be fine. So I think it's a fundamental flaw with the system. Ultimately, I think that brings this down and would have done so later if not now. If you're going to go to this direction where you bootstrap it very aggressively, you have to somehow be able to convert that into that sustainable growth. And I think the only really sustainable thing that you could have done here is to have better and more collateral.
00:37:45.532 - 00:37:49.980, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm only pushing back on this because you just can't have your cake and eat it too.
00:37:50.012 - 00:37:50.180, Speaker B: Right?
00:37:50.212 - 00:38:13.610, Speaker A: Everyone in crypto is like, no accredited investor laws, free markets, free markets rule everything. And then they're like, something like this happens and it's like we needed more information when every time, you know, every time you bought ust, you should have got a disclaimer or something. And I don't know, you just, you can't have it both ways. You can't have completely free markets and no laws around these things, but then also have disclaimers and information every time you buy an asset.
00:38:13.722 - 00:38:30.756, Speaker D: Like, I'm all pro innovation. Like, I still think we need more diversity and diversified state, like, fully, like, decentralized, stable coins. That is the Achilles heel of Defi, and. And we need that. And I totally agree with Mika's point. You needed to have more collateral. Like, I didn't.
00:38:30.756 - 00:39:35.094, Speaker D: We had doe on the episode a couple weeks ago, and a lot of people criticized, kind of saw his move of buying bitcoin as a reserve, as, like, acknowledgement that a pure, kind of, like, trust based algorithmic stablecoin wouldn't have worked, that you needed to have collateral. And I agree with Mika. I think it's a little too, little too late. Now, the question that you posed at the beginning of the episode is a really good one, is how did we get to this point where it was so big? And I think it's what Mika said, which is you were just kind of in a kind of mostly, like, bull market environment where these things, like, in bull markets, these design flaws don't really show up. It's really when you stress test the system where kind of shit hits the fan and things break. Um, and when things break in this environment, people get hurt, and there's no bailouts, there's no 1800 number to call, and I don't know what the answer to that is. Candidly, I just think from a front end user perspective, I think more like.
00:39:35.094 - 00:40:09.248, Speaker D: Like a questionnaire. Like, even when you're going on FTX or, like, finance, you need to take some sort of level of test to assess your understanding of using these products. We can probably maybe beef that up a little bit. I don't have a perfect answer for that, but from a mechanism standpoint, I think for me, it's. Dai continues to be the least sexy, but I think the most resilient and proven stable coin out there. And it's not perfect because a lot of the collateral is USDC and it's centralized. But still, maybe fracs is a good one, too.
00:40:09.248 - 00:40:13.658, Speaker D: And we should have Sam on the episode talk about his kind of the mechanism that they use.
00:40:13.826 - 00:40:46.728, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I wanted to say something about, like, these mechanisms, because I talked to a lot of really, really intelligent people who are crypto native, you know, running big funds. And even for these guys, like, trying to really wrap your head around exactly what the mechanism is doing. You know, it's not enough to just, like, read an explanation or white paper or watch a video. Like, it's so complex. And I study these things. And I still, like, have, like, 99% understanding. And then I've had to recently, over the last few days, try to think and understand where the flaws are.
00:40:46.728 - 00:41:32.774, Speaker C: And I found some of them, and I haven't even heard anybody discuss them before. Obviously, you have some kind of complex mechanism where Luna is supposed to be a store of value for money that goes into UST because you're buying Luna to convert it into UST. But if somebody buys Luna at $10 and sells it $100, they are taking a lot of money out of the system. And then if the liquidity is not there when people want to sell and no one's willing to buy everything at $100, and the price moves, this idea of, you can look at market cap and you can say, well, 40 billion backs 10 billion, that's fine. And then it all hides in illiquidity, is what I like to say. Because you can't sell everything at a $100. There's no buyer that's going to absorb that much.
00:41:32.774 - 00:42:13.594, Speaker C: And as this thing gets to, like, ten, $20 billion, the amount that can get absorbed at a certain price point is a smaller and smaller percentage of the total market cap. Market makers will only quote a certain number of coins at each price level, and pretty soon that money's left the system. You've had a lot of seed stage people that made a thousand x and exited into fiat, and that money's not there. Then when people want to, like, leave, want to exit themselves. So these things are super complex. I do want to say, you know, we're still in the early innings of Defi. This thing is going to go on for many years.
00:42:13.594 - 00:42:40.414, Speaker C: We're doing experiments. It's very sad. And like you said, we're not dancing on anyone's graves. I'm very sad that this is happening for everyone that's losing a lot of money. I didn't want this to happen, or, like, I think it's, in a way, part of the natural evolution of the cycle where we're learning things, okay, this didn't work. Let's not do that again. I don't think we're going to keep trying to do this.
00:42:40.414 - 00:42:49.066, Speaker C: We'll adapt and something new will come about, and in the long run, we'll find what the solutions are, but we have to make those mistakes first.
00:42:49.210 - 00:43:11.158, Speaker A: Jordy, I think you hit on a really important point there, and I did hear you talk about something with Jose from Delphi and the bankless guys on episode a couple of weeks ago, which is kind of related to what you're talking about of this multiplier effect when Luna goes down. So just to make. I want to make sure everyone kind of gets the full lay of the land in this episode. Can you just explain that multiplier effect that you talked about on the bankless episode a few weeks ago?
00:43:11.326 - 00:43:11.630, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:43:11.662 - 00:43:46.258, Speaker C: So basically, Luna does not have a fixed supply. And that's the main difference compared to something like bitcoin, for example. New Luna can get minted from this mechanism from UST exiting. And the amount that gets minted is determined based on the price. There's an oracle price. So the unfortunate feedback loop is as the price of Luna goes down, people exiting UST can get even more coins of Luna. So as the price goes down by half, then you can get twice as much Luna, so that dilutes it even more.
00:43:46.258 - 00:44:21.466, Speaker C: And then there's even more selling pressure because there's more coins. And that's kind of what we've seen over the last few days, where the price just goes literally to a dollar or below a dollar based on all this new supply. Because people exiting UST at some point, I don't think we've yet, as of airing of this episode, have had a case where UST was above Luna in price, but it got very close. So you can imagine exiting a million dollars of UST. You can get close to a million luna coins, which. Yeah, I mean, that's very hard to absorb.
00:44:21.650 - 00:44:49.376, Speaker A: Is this a case of something getting. So a lot of folks brought up George Soros. Right, breaking the bank of England. Is this a case of these markets don't really get tested until they're big enough because it's not worth testing them. Right. If a stable coin had $20 million market cap, 50 million, even $100 million market cap, it's not really worth it for a big fund to come in and try to break that market. But when you get to a $40 billion market cap, there's a lot of incentive to try to break these markets.
00:44:49.376 - 00:45:16.104, Speaker A: And you're right, it's, you know, a lot of these people who are creating these things, there may be startup founders, first time founder. They've never created. What you're doing is you're creating economies here and now when you get these systems that are so large, you're creating an incentive for some of the largest funds in the world to come in and try to break these markets to profit off of them. Is there, do you think that's happening here with Luna? Did this thing get so big that now there were so many eyes on it that it was actually incentivizing people to come break it.
00:45:16.884 - 00:45:46.478, Speaker C: Personally, I think it's not so much that there were more eyes on it. I think it's that it became harder to control, like when it was 100 million. It's not that somebody could have attacked it because jump and three arrows and whoever else was backing it can destroy somebody who's trying to short something. It's 100 million. It's like peanuts. But is JMP willing to put billions and billions of dollars? I mean, people know JMP and they know they're big. They've done the $300 million wormhole that was their own project.
00:45:46.478 - 00:46:37.042, Speaker C: So if they valued that internally at like two, $3 billion, which is what they were trying to raise at, of course they're going to bail it out. But if it's someone else's project, will they, like, back it up with billions and billions of dollars? We are talking about, like, a trading firm that is market neutral for the most part when they're trading, it wasn't clear that they would be willing to take that much of hit, so it might not be the case. I know exactly what you're talking about. Definitely with smart contracts, you have that exact effect where if there's only $5 million, you won't get the best hackers in the world to try to manipulate that smart contract. But then at $500 million, you'll get an army of North Koreans to look into it as much as possible. But I think in this case, it's more of a. It's more of, it got so big that the money is so substantial, people could not back it.
00:46:37.218 - 00:46:56.354, Speaker D: Jody, I think your point is a fantastic one, which talks about the relationship between the market, the value of the aggregate value of Luna and UST is something that people were watching closely. I think what they didn't appreciate is the order book. Kind of like, you can't sell everything at 100.
00:46:56.514 - 00:46:57.080, Speaker A: Right.
00:46:57.202 - 00:47:16.624, Speaker D: Luna, these have cascading effects. Right on that point. So, you know, obviously, Terra is trading out right now, like, went all the way from $100 to $2.28. So, but it still has sort of an aggregate market cap of like 2.3 billion UST.
00:47:17.524 - 00:47:21.940, Speaker A: Forty five cents. Forty eight cents. Yeah, $0.49. Luna's at 423.
00:47:22.052 - 00:47:29.214, Speaker D: Yeah, UST is at $0.52. I'm seeing it has like a circulating supply of like 7 billion. Where do we go from here?
00:47:29.674 - 00:48:27.054, Speaker B: Well, if you look at just what those post was today, essentially, I do think it was a kind of, in a sense, small sense of giving up where now we're just going to have to go through this process with the current mechanism that there is. Which means essentially that maybe to make like a company analogy, you're bailing out the sort of bad stuff on your balance sheet by minting new equity, essentially. And you do have like a very large hyperinflationary problem when you're doing that here. And the precise mechanism and the limits on it, actually, I don't think matter really that much. It's more just the idea that, well, you know, that there's this bad debt coming in that you have to absorb, well, you know, the value of your equity sort of going to go down a lot because of that. And that shows up as hyperinflation in the token and a very low price and the market cap collapsing. So, yeah, I think now it looks like we just have to go through this process.
00:48:27.054 - 00:49:01.036, Speaker B: This thing has been defended with like some billions already. I don't. This is the very difficult question. You never know when the seller is sort of exhausted, really. So if you start trying to prop this up a bit more with like, again, trying to put in like 500 million into a curve pool and do that dance again, you don't know how well that's going to go, but you might want to try that again to get it to peg. But even if you do, like, you still have the fundamental system problem. And in those Twitter message, he did say that, oh yeah, we want to collateralize this.
00:49:01.036 - 00:49:21.638, Speaker B: And then that's a process. You basically have to start from zero with the fact that people already know that this mechanism doesn't really work. And you've admitted that you need to collateralize it. So that makes this, I think, really, really difficult challenge. And unless the market is very forgiving, I do struggle to see how exactly this gets fixed.
00:49:21.806 - 00:49:51.064, Speaker D: Before we go to you, Jordy, I want to ask you, Mika, just a quick follow up, which is what is the collateral level that one should have? And this goes to the Frax model because fracs says we're going to build trust and then it plays around on the curve around how much collateral there is underpinning what is that level. Because in this case, I think the aggregate value of that bitcoin at that time was like no more than like 20% or so much less. Right. It was like a fraction, a very small fraction.
00:49:51.684 - 00:50:21.564, Speaker B: I think we know that. Well, I would say that conceptually, the more the better. If you could have ten x collateral on the money supply, yes, do it. But it's just that that becomes sort of untenable from a scaling perspective. So the more security you have, the more difficult it is to scale. And then when you just put the collateral level down, the maker system, I think, is sort of inefficient. And the margins you want to really work with are like 110, 120% kind of thing on your collateral types going forward, I think fracs is doing, like, okay.
00:50:21.564 - 00:51:05.080, Speaker B: It's shown that the 80 whatever percent type of system, that's okay as well. So it really is like, sort of finger in the air at the moment. But 20 didn't seem to be fine. I think there were good reasons to be skeptical why 20 wouldn't be fine at the larger scale. I think that it just needs to be like a relatively one to one match or like something close to it, because you do always sort of run into this issue where, well, what if they're collateral sort of, and if you spend a collateral, that's horrible, right? Because if you just, like, spend it, it's like a bullet and it's gone and you can never use that again. So having the collateral in this case, that didn't even actually help. It arguably made the thing worse, because after you sell that collateral, well, then you don't have it anymore.
00:51:05.080 - 00:51:30.764, Speaker B: So you start from zero. So you can't, you know, the value of your ust has technically, like, gone to the floor is zero now. It's not the BTC price anymore. So it sort of gets worse. So, yeah, I think, like, a safe assumption right now is that project should, like, start with that sort of 83% area, and then as we get to scale, we can, like, think about whether or not that should be marginally pushed up or marginally down, but otherwise, it doesn't seem to work.
00:51:31.384 - 00:51:36.816, Speaker A: Jordy, is this the end of the terra luna ecosystem here?
00:51:37.000 - 00:52:12.868, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm sure a lot of the viewers are kind of watching just for that question. I think it's a transformation of it. I don't think it's going to be the end. There are certain assets that are both goodwill, intangible assets, and also actual assets. So we are talking a little bit without full information. We don't know exactly how much of the bitcoin, if any, is left. Out of the initially $3 billion of bitcoin that was bought, that has been moved around to different counterparties like JMP and other people and exchanges, and we don't actually know how much is left.
00:52:12.868 - 00:53:07.534, Speaker C: There could still be quite a lot left. We know there's some avalanche tokens that they still own, and we know that there is ultimately the blockchain itself, which has different apps and has intellectual property. And let's not discount that. Although the community of Luna has suffered, I'm sure, huge losses, there is some kind of network value of those people and that attention value. So I think what do is basically saying at this point is we've tried to bridge this asset liability mismatch, which was in the billions of dollars. They tried to raise a round to start to bridge it. It was my understanding that many people were skeptical to put in a lot of money into that round.
00:53:07.534 - 00:53:47.524, Speaker C: And ultimately that approach was expressly kind of admitted to not be the case right now. So they're not going to be getting a huge bailout. I think this price barrel at some point reduces the mismatch because things just get so cheap. Like, let's just take a thought experiment. Let's just say like UST went from a dollar peg to $0.01. Well, suddenly, like, you know, somebody can buy that debt and at $0.01 on the dollar and everything's liquid and the mechanism can start working.
00:53:47.524 - 00:54:26.288, Speaker C: So it shouldn't be worth $0.01. Obviously, the market is trying to figure out where it should be worth. It was a bit surprising to me that Luna was, when I went to sleep yesterday, was still worth 2030, $40. The mechanism for UST is that it can keep redeeming itself for Luna, so it can keep pressuring the Luna price down. And UST is like the senior debt, let's say out of all this they have the seniority. Luna cannot have any value while UST is trying to get out. So should USD even be depend? It's quite an interesting question.
00:54:26.288 - 00:55:22.168, Speaker C: If there's any bid for Luna in the future, then UST should be pegged and we might see it repeg once a lot of the USD gets sold at a low rate and at some point there's not much left to exit the system. So it is possible we see a repegging if there is some bid for Luna at some very low price in the future, where somebody says, well, this is worth something and I will put in some amount of money into it, and maybe there is still some collateral in bitcoin or other coins and the chain survives. Of course, trust is lost and you're not going to see all these institutions getting back into anchor. They're not going to go back in. It's a traumatic event that you can't return from. What's probably going to happen is Doe will completely change the model. He'll go to some fully collateralized model.
00:55:22.168 - 00:55:53.082, Speaker C: They will try to keep the chain and all the apps and all the defi and all the gaming and all the projects that are building on the chain going, but without this senior UsT debt to dump on them constantly. So I think it won't die. That doesn't mean you should, like, long Luna. I don't recommend that. It's like a junior debt in a very precarious situation. So you have to be very careful and, yeah, it'll just transform into something else.
00:55:53.278 - 00:56:48.344, Speaker D: Is there an arb here? Is there a way to play this? Are you playing it? And looking at the relation between Ust and Luna? I mean, the issue, though, is liquidity in my, you know, you could theoretically, like, think about doing this right, but when exchanges are halting withdrawals and the curve pool seems to be, there's a lot of congestion and there's a time delay, and so you're taking a lot of risk. So for anyone listening, like, conceptually, yeah, you can set parameters and think about, oh, yeah, like, I'm just gonna, like, scalp and, like, profit and of the relationship of UsT and Luna, but market participants and the way these things actually execute in practice. One, you probably can't do it at scale, and two, there's some time element and components that make this difficult, at least for now, where things are a lot in, you know, in flux. But. But I'm curious, Jordy or Mika, like, are you guys thinking about playing this at some point? Like, there is a time where these assets trade at such a distress level that can make for a great investment.
00:56:49.044 - 00:57:20.664, Speaker C: There's a lot of trades going on right now. I can tell you just from experience, kind of, there's going to be some huge, huge p and l days that you'll hear about from the trading firms, because when you have such an unwind of billions of dollars of an asset, it happens in such a messy way, no one's prepared for it. And you can see across exchanges, you have, like, crypto.com has $6 and FTX is, like, $1. So you can't move coins around. Everything's broken. But there are arbs out there.
00:57:20.664 - 00:58:05.620, Speaker C: There's a lot of things to be done, and I hope that the tower research and the jumps and all these companies who make all this money today will put it back into the ecosystem in some way or another to support the ecosystem. But for individuals, for retail, there's no clear way to play this. You can think about long ust, short Luna, and think that, well, I can buy it at. If Luna goes to zero, then I'll be fine because I'll make it on kind of like the short. The problem with that is you have to be very careful with short squeezes. You can kind of get like, you know, if Luna suddenly spikes to $1020, you can just get liquidated. And it's very dangerous game to play.
00:58:05.620 - 00:58:15.044, Speaker C: So it's a game for professionals. Those games are being played, but I wouldn't recommend, there's no simple way to do it, so I wouldn't suggest it to anybody.
00:58:15.384 - 00:58:51.052, Speaker B: Yeah, I would say my good time in this place is sort of over in a way where I think you could see it from the on chain data that the situation would be serious and that you would have to have this sort of fight for the pay again and that there was a strong likelihood that it would break. And that fundamental analysis is sort of done. I think another one right now to look at is just sort of still like what's coming out of Anker Luna minting and what that means for just the sort of sale pressure on Luna. So I think those fundamental things still exist a little bit. But the most interesting one sort of.
00:58:51.068 - 00:59:27.688, Speaker D: Went, I want to transition a little bit. That's what I was saying. I've been talking to a lot of market participants. I tweeted earlier. I woke up and I was like, okay, well, some firms may blow up. It has felt like a crazy last 72 hours. And I was thinking, what are the systemic effects of this? And I can think of a few, but I want to first ask both of you, how are you seeing this impact and reverberate across the industry and the appetite for risk in crypto? Putting aside macro for a second, because we always talk about CPI came in at eight handle, which was high.
00:59:27.688 - 00:59:33.778, Speaker D: But those are things that I want to talk about, idiosyncratic things, to crypto specific things. Macro is always macro.
00:59:33.936 - 01:00:22.118, Speaker C: I think I'm on the pleasantly surprised side because given what's happened, you could have seen obliteration. The majors are holding up quite well. Altcoins is a different story. I mean, everything outside of maybe bitcoin ETH has fallen a lot. And so it goes to show that there is this flight to quality aspect, even within crypto natives, where they'll say, well, I'm just going to go into the majors right now, and I'm happy to hold that for ten years and not even think about these short term fluctuations. I was pleasantly surprised that there is a bid, even during this potentially $3 billion sale of bitcoin, we don't know exactly how much was sold, but it got absorbed. It wasn't the end of the world.
01:00:22.118 - 01:00:55.174, Speaker C: I was saying this from before, that this too big to fail narrative. I wasn't really believing it. People still believe in bitcoin and ethereum and some of the other well designed assets. And yeah, we might not see like a blow off top anytime soon, but I think given what we've seen, it's one of those situations where confidence can start to build that. Even in cataclysmic scenarios, this is not going to zero like we are there, like there is a future. So it makes me quite optimistic in the long run.
01:00:55.524 - 01:01:06.932, Speaker A: Mika, what about you? When you look back at March 2020, it felt like Defi was at risk. Right now, it doesn't really feel like that. It feels like the terra ecosystem is at risk. So what are the ripple effects of this?
01:01:07.028 - 01:02:37.094, Speaker B: It felt very much at the time that we also took very clear lessons from why exactly what was the problem with makerdao precisely? And we sort of precisely addressed it. And there were these very engineering, very exact things that we could do to make these systems better. Whereas the Luna one, it's still like a question of what will the system look like going forward and will there be collateral and what's the serve relationship between Luna and UST. So there's a lot more in the air that will sort of be left hanging. And maybe the interesting dynamic to follow that I would like to at least see this play out is that UST gets its peg back and then people are sort of confident about Luna and do we see this sort of thing where people forget about this quickly, surprisingly quickly, even though now it feels like the end of the world and there, whether or not we actually address those risks or do we just like, go forward and have another party? I think that's a dynamic that hasn't played out in the market yet, but that's the one that I would be most interested to follow and would be sort of the most interesting outcome. And a very negative outcome, I think, could be that we just don't really react to it and just continue on the same path and someone saved us and they'll save us again in the future, you know, and that sort of bad, bad logic around this. So, yeah, I think it's very different where Defi really, I think, took very specific lessons and implemented those at the protocol level and made these systems better.
01:02:37.094 - 01:02:48.114, Speaker B: And here, I don't know yet. I don't know yet what the, what the precise thing is. How will the next system be designed? And, yeah, so just looking at that.
01:02:48.414 - 01:03:39.706, Speaker D: I think that's a great point, Mika. And just to add on top of that, I think nothing is wrong with Defi. I think it'd be amiss if we extrapolate here and say one protocol going down on a very risky type of experiment on the risk curve doesn't mean that DeFi has failed us. In fact, I think DeFi is really resilient and has survived many shocks and liquidations. I think what I want to look at is the level of exposure of some of these lending protocols that had Ust as collateral. It'll be interesting to see which projects in the terra ecosystem, including avalanche, also that had ust exposure, how they absorb those losses, or that shock. And I think there are nascent DeFi ecosystems outside of Ethereum that are perhaps a little bit more fragile.
01:03:39.706 - 01:04:20.158, Speaker D: Might not have a keeper liquidator system as robust as an ethereum. Those are the things that I'm looking at. But I think it would be amiss if we look at this in episode and say DeFi can't work. Because I think time and time again, there is more lin date at DeFi, and it has operated in a very adversarial environment. The thing that I do worry is, yeah, I think Luna is a very retail ecosystem. And kind of my conversations with OTC DEs is that a lot of funds had exposure to this. A lot of them are kind of feeling the pain and chopping alts relentlessly at a loss to make up for some of the losses.
01:04:20.158 - 01:05:00.562, Speaker D: And I think they're going back initially to BTC and ETH. That's why I think you're seeing some relative strength in BTC and Es. Although I would that might be phase one, phase two might be then they chop BTC and ETH because they get redemptions. And you layer on top of that macro risk, you lay on top of that, the risk of famine down the road, if things continue and the situation in Ukraine doesn't get resolved, I think it's just a very different environment. 2018 felt just like a crypto bubble popping. Now you have rising rates, many of which crypto investors haven't kind of witnessed. You also have geopolitical risks.
01:05:00.562 - 01:05:17.714, Speaker D: And so all of that, candidly, does make me nervous. I don't think you want to be a hero in this market. I think the name of the game is kind of surviving and, you know, just waiting how all these things play out. And, you know, I think maybe the Degen spirits calm down a little bit for better force.
01:05:17.874 - 01:05:36.184, Speaker A: Sante, I have a question for you, actually, which is, I mean, when you look at the markets, they're absolutely puking, right? Bitcoin and ETH down 18% on the weekend. Solana and some others are down like 30, 35% on the week and, you know, down like 80% off the highs. When are you buying? What is your moment that you look at this market and say, now's the time I'm jumping in.
01:05:36.604 - 01:05:59.664, Speaker D: I haven't seen pain. This is definitely, definitely not, man. If anyone that's been in crypto for the last two, three years is way up, still way up. You want to feel pain. Like, I remember pain. I was thinking about the story when I was met Kane and at the binance conference in 2019, that was literally, that week was the bottom of synthetix. It was trading at 8 million philly dilutive market cap.
01:05:59.664 - 01:06:26.654, Speaker D: He said, every time we post something that token tanks because it reminds people that they have this bag and they sell it. No one was showing up these conferences. And I think that's pain right now. People might. Some funds may blow up for sure that we're way overexposed to Terra and Luna, but I don't think we've seen pain overwhelming part of the market.
01:06:27.034 - 01:06:30.854, Speaker A: Yeah. Mika, what do you think? Have we agree or disagree with Santu?
01:06:32.194 - 01:07:20.594, Speaker B: Maybe to give a slightly different answer. Just the way I think about it is the market cycles and what really drives them is having this baseline of really great innovation and then these moments where come we have this, like, trigger and we really take off and, yeah, I think it's gonna be a while to maybe find that really next trigger. So whether or not we go, like, a lot down from here, I don't know, but I feel like we're, at least from the time component, still a ways away from really, like, the next wave of really bringing on user. Because really, the thing that makes any of this sustainable is, like, building great stuff that people want to use and hopefully actually getting to, like, mass user adoption one day. So that's really the North Star on horizon. And I think to accomplish that, there's still a lot of work and it will take a while.
01:07:21.454 - 01:07:46.604, Speaker C: I'm a bit more optimistic. I think there's two narratives. One is the bitcoin hard money narrative. The other one is the ETH merge narrative. They're both going to be a huge deal. I think the ETH merge narrative will allow big funds that are environmentally conscious to be able to buy a layer, one asset being proof of stake. There's going to be just a huge buzz when this actually happens.
01:07:46.604 - 01:08:08.188, Speaker C: On the bitcoin side, I think there is a need for hard money more than ever that will continue to increase as the year goes on. And I think that narrative picks up. I'm very bullish for those two assets. I'm still long, I'm not selling anything. I'm not worried about it at all. In terms of everything else, I agree. Mika said, I think there's a need for more innovation.
01:08:08.188 - 01:08:40.644, Speaker C: It's time to build. We've had such crazy primary valuations. We've had just absurd numbers of meme coin, billion dollars, things going on. It's a good opportunity for those things to get washed out for the new builders, the new generation of builders. 1.0 defi good stuff. You create all these primitives, all these ideas, aave all these types of things.
01:08:40.644 - 01:09:11.954, Speaker C: I wasn't a big fan of the 2.0, the Olympus Daos and some of these experiments. I was not a fan. And I think now is the time to have all these smart people that have entered the crypto space from all different engineering and development and all these different places just go through the rubble and see what have you learned and what can we actually build that is going to be very sustainable going forward? I'm quite excited and I don't mind that we're going to go through this building cycle now.
01:09:13.094 - 01:09:31.338, Speaker D: Those are both great observation guys. I want to preface I'm still net long. I'm a perma bull. I think the fact that this industry is 1 trillion now is laughable. But you need to take the long view. The problem is I'm just sort of couching this because I don't play much in liquid markets. I don't try to time markets.
01:09:31.338 - 01:10:14.642, Speaker D: My pace of deployment in privates, my average deployment across 100 deals has been 30 35 fully diluted market cap. I look at that and I say to me that feels really comfortable because we are entering in a, not like we are entering in a utility phase of this asset class. It was all speculative for a long time. And I agree with you Jordy. The merge, bitcoin, ossifying as kind of a non sovereign store value nfts, all of that is really powerful. It's not going away, it's just going to take time. And that was my point, which is, I think time and time again, there's always a mismatch between narratives and fundamentals.
01:10:14.642 - 01:10:38.178, Speaker D: I think we were in a period over the last six to twelve months of just overextended narratives and the fundamentals not catching up as much and definitely agree with you. We need more innovation. And episodes like these are never fun, but they do serve as moments to look back upon, reflect, and then kind of improve upon as a space, which we tend to do really well, especially because it's open source.
01:10:38.306 - 01:10:43.534, Speaker A: It's a great point. Satu. Mika Jordy, this has been great. Any last parting thoughts here?
01:10:43.914 - 01:11:21.284, Speaker B: Yeah, just that I'm also always a perma bull and always long this stuff, irrationally so, but. And I would just love to have a market where in the DeFi 2019 ish, maybe early 2020. I can't remember, like when 2020 somewhere it really started, the price appreciation. It felt like, oh, we have all this great stuff. Why isn't anyone, like, reacting? Why doesn't price react like we should be so much higher? No one's getting this. And I would love to be in that point again where, oh, we have all this cool stuff and why isn't this taking off? They'll realize it at any moment and then they do, and then we sort of get to the next place. I'd love to have that experience again.
01:11:21.864 - 01:12:28.384, Speaker C: Yeah. So my final thoughts, I guess I'm mainly focused on the people that lost a lot of money, the lunatics, and other people that tangentially maybe lost money without even really understanding the risks that they were taking. I think it's important to not, like, pile on on the sadness that's out there. I see, like, a lot of dancing on graves and that kind of thing. I really hope that people kind of get their mental health stable and start building optimistically towards the future instead of, you know, view this as a catastrophic thing that can be recovered. I think everybody can recover, and we saw a lot of those stories from the last cycle where people got wiped out and then have done extremely well in this latest cycle. So, yeah, I think let's try to just kind of get through, and above all, just remember the lessons more than anything.
01:12:28.384 - 01:12:41.736, Speaker C: Don't take risks that you don't understand. It is a bit of a casino out there that is one of the use cases of crypto, but when you're in a casino, you need to kind of know what your limits are and be quite careful.
01:12:41.920 - 01:12:52.944, Speaker A: I think that's very well said. I think that's a good place to end on. Mika, Jordy, thanks for coming on. Santiago, as always, thanks for being my great co host on this one. And, yeah, if you're listening, be well and things will get better.
