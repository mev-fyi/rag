00:00:00.440 - 00:00:38.418, Speaker A: You had Germany sell close to 3 billion of bitcoin. So you're telling me that you're selling a hard asset to buy for euros that you can print? And imagine a country like the US says no, right? You're going to print money to buy bitcoin regardless of whether Trump or someone like Jamie Dimon goes out and says that publicly? I think, again, the narrative is intact. We had an ETF that legitimizes assassin class incredibly. And you best believe that this has just become. You couldn't even whisper bitcoin when I was a JP Morgan. The elevator, I mean. And that has been the case for forever.
00:00:38.418 - 00:00:39.706, Speaker A: Until recently.

00:02:26.280 - 00:02:27.408, Speaker A: GM, everyone.
00:02:27.544 - 00:02:28.420, Speaker B: What's that?
00:02:29.000 - 00:02:37.752, Speaker A: Well, stark contrast to last week, I guess there's a lot to talk about, so we just dive right into it. It feels like big turnaround.
00:02:37.936 - 00:02:57.512, Speaker B: I mean, we would have looked much smarter last week if we said this is the calm before the storm, but instead we said, there's nothing to talk about. But yeah, I mean, week over week difference from last week to this week. Last week, it felt like not much news. Germany selling prices are getting hammered. And this week, yeah, it's feeling pretty bullish going into today.
00:02:57.616 - 00:03:31.966, Speaker A: So, yeah, let's talk about, like the. Like, we always talk about narratives here, right? And trying to hopefully get ahead of narratives. And a common theme that I keep going back to is, like, we look at prior cycles and we say, it was so obvious. We overfitted Covid stimulus checks. People inside, they're punting, they're bored, they're punting. And somehow it's just important to recognize that in the moment, the market gives you plenty of reasons to be sidelined, to be really shit in your pants. I think the conclusion is position sizing.
00:03:31.966 - 00:04:02.846, Speaker A: I'm almost certain. I'm never certain of anything that it comes down to position sizing, because in moments of choppiness, moments, you're going to be more predisposed to be shaken out. And it hasn't been comfortable for anyone. Investing is not meant to be easy. Right? But let me ask you a question. What is, as you sit here today, and I texted you this before we went on the pod, for me, this cycle, the narrative is intact. It's not up.
00:04:02.846 - 00:04:32.704, Speaker A: Only narrative. It's not. There is a cycle to things. There is a psychology to things, but the narrative is very much intact. And that is, we just had an ETF approved, we've been waiting for it forever. And all this asset class was hugely legitimized. And all the work that has been going on, on the background for the last decade plus of evangelizing, of convincing people this is actually important, then it could be properly implemented.
00:04:32.704 - 00:05:10.822, Speaker A: Right. And we're not even seeing the full extent of that. But it's that if you fast forward three years from now, where we're back in, down 80%, we're going to look back and say, oh, yeah, it was so obvious we had an ETF. We had all the signs pointing to greater regulatory clarity, and things on the margin obviously make it more in the moment. But I don't know why. Why does the timeline, I guess, go from peak extreme to euphoria from week to week? That's kind of something new I've observed. I'm just kind of curious, like, how could you explain that? I don't really know.
00:05:10.926 - 00:05:25.696, Speaker B: I think the explanation is because in past cycles. So here's my working thesis, is that in past cycles, the. It felt like deep bear. Like the bear market was down. Then we started. It was like smoother cycles there was some like, bad cycles there, like.
00:05:25.888 - 00:05:30.568, Speaker A: Cause you always have these 1020. I mean, my God, in 2014, yeah.
00:05:30.584 - 00:05:58.836, Speaker B: You had your shit, your bull market. You had these sick, what, six drawdowns of 30% that people like to look at. But this one feel, I think this bull market feels a little different than other ones. And so people are kind of like, like, what's going, like, what's going on here? Like, and actually we gave a. So we had the company all hands for blockworks yesterday, and we have. We have 70 people at blockworks now, 24 new people. So 24 people, 23 people started in the last six months.
00:05:58.948 - 00:05:59.412, Speaker A: Wow.
00:05:59.516 - 00:06:33.102, Speaker B: And a lot of those folks know what is happening, know what is happening on their teams, but they wanted to know, like, what's happening at the rest of blockworks and like, get everyone in line. But also they wanted to hear Mike and my thoughts on this cycle. And, you know, Mike kind of led this part of the conversation, but I can do, I can maybe abbreviate what he talked about. He said, look, there's probably like three working theories on what's going on with this cycle. The first working theory is that ETF's have kind of changed the game. Right? The institutions are here. ETF's have changed the game.
00:06:33.102 - 00:06:53.608, Speaker B: Previously the cycles were so violent because it was just retail led and retail buys. And they get very exuberant and then they sell, and they have to sell everything because they use a lot of leverage. And that caused these violent upswings and downswings. First, maybe narrative or like thesis is that the ETF's have arrived. Institutions are just going to keep buying. That kind of leads to a slower grind up. That's theory number one.
00:06:53.608 - 00:07:41.450, Speaker B: Theory number two is that ETF's actually pulled forward a lot of the growth in buying. They probably pulled it forward by like six to nine months. So we actually have a pretty normal, like, normally observed cycle, which is intact right now. The growth that you might see in like a little later just got pulled forward. And then that's why we've been like kind of choppier down for the last couple of months is because the growth that was supposed to come maybe around this time or in the fall got pulled forward with the bitcoin ETF. And then I think the third theory is like, look, maybe it just gets easier to buy these ETF's and you buy it on your Robinhood and Schwab accounts, and you don't actually pivot into like the long tail. And retail ends up staying in these ETF's they don't spill over into on chain products.
00:07:41.450 - 00:08:11.776, Speaker B: And I think the third one, I would agree with Mike on this, the third one is probably pretty unlikely in my mind. I don't think retail just buys ETF's and stays, you know, stays inside of their schwab accounts. I think it's some combo of one and two. But though, that is making it feel, the cycle feel a little weird, because it really is. There haven't been new people. Like, when you hear people bitching about ECC, it's like, why are people bitching about ECC? My theory is it's not about the side events. It's not about overhyped infrastructure or whatever.
00:08:11.776 - 00:08:24.180, Speaker B: It's. There's no new entrants. And a lack of new entrants makes these things really like, it kind of breaks some of what should happen in cycles. So that's my working theory of what's happening.
00:08:24.680 - 00:08:48.542, Speaker A: Yeah, I would agree with some of that. I think it's really painful to observe the Nasdaq and the market rip all time highs and crypto not move directionally in line where it's been high beta. And you would. This is very difficult. And so I would agree with you. A lot of it is. There's just more.
00:08:48.542 - 00:09:13.524, Speaker A: There's still money being made. It's Pvp. Like, a lot of people didn't benefit from, like, the meme supercycle mini cycle that we had a. And then it's all kind of the range of universe of things that you can invest in. This space continues to go up, and there's, like, hot pockets that, like, last months. Right. And then people move on this hot ball of money.
00:09:13.524 - 00:09:29.112, Speaker A: But, yeah, I don't, I've talked to, like, it's funny because, like, I, from time to time get pinged for more macro funds that invest in crypto. This week, two of them ping me, want to talk. They all put back size. They're all flip super bullish, which is, you know, a hallmark of a good investor just being able to flip.
00:09:29.176 - 00:09:32.648, Speaker B: They flip super bullish on the markets or on crypto.
00:09:32.784 - 00:09:44.144, Speaker A: They. On crypto, they invest. They're, they're macro guys, but they invest in crypto. And not just bitcoin. They invest in. They have, like, crypto funds, but their, their background is macro. So I'd like to talk to them.
00:09:44.144 - 00:10:21.950, Speaker A: And they both reached out and they had flipped bearish. They'd gone to stables a couple months ago, primarily because of this construct of, like, there's no money, no money coming in. You look at ETF flows and they're just not there, which is what you're saying. But they are now put all the size back on. They're fully allocated, and they both seem to think that the narrative is intact for the rest of the year. And going into the, you know, going into the next couple of years, my question to them was, what really changed? Because I don't think a, you can really predict why things move. Just sentiment, I guess.
00:10:21.950 - 00:10:51.626, Speaker A: And it's like, well, you know, now we, it's become more and more clear that Trump's gonna win. I'm like, well, prediction markets had him at 70 plus for a while. It's not necessarily new, new now. He's like, you know, in this, solidified himself. But it's like, and yeah, you have Jamie, have JD Vance, we'll talk about this in the pod, but you're more political person. I want to get your take on that. But Howard Marx has put out a good memo today, which is like, what has really changed? And when people talk about certainty and try to predict the markets, it's impossible.
00:10:51.626 - 00:11:08.470, Speaker A: That's my takeaway. It's going to become more and more difficult to predict these markets. They're not going to be smooth. There's going to continue to be volume, but markets do what they're going to do. Now memes are back on the menu, the hats on.
00:11:10.370 - 00:11:22.514, Speaker B: Say, Santi, say more. Say more about what you're looking like. What crypto native metrics you look at. I know we were talking about leverage and stable coins. Can you talk about those two metrics?
00:11:22.682 - 00:11:49.742, Speaker A: Look, Joseph, our producer, was like, we haven't really seen leverage as we did in price likes. I'm like, have we? Pretty sure we have. When the market was going down. I mean, we had one day, whereas, like, the second highest liquidation day in crypto after FTX. So there is open interest, there is leverage in the system. It's moving around, it's getting wiped. I would attribute that.
00:11:49.742 - 00:12:23.334, Speaker A: So it's not leverage. It's just there's not new inflows. And when we talk about new inflows, particularly on chain like alts, right, ex ETF's, you look at stable coins. That to me is the most important metric, like stable coin circulation. So when you have the tether printer coming back on, then there's like a whale alert account on Twitter, which marks a lot of these new prints for USDC and tether. And I think, to me, that's probably the most important metric that I'm following on chain. At least I don't know, just the.
00:12:23.422 - 00:12:24.902, Speaker B: Stable coin volumes, basically.
00:12:24.966 - 00:12:26.510, Speaker A: Yeah. Stablecoin circulation.
00:12:26.670 - 00:12:27.438, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:12:27.614 - 00:12:43.904, Speaker A: Because that really went down after FTX for a number of reasons. People didn't want to. Like, you're going to stables, then rates go down. Rates on chain, on Aave and maker and compound are like, less. Like less in treasury. So stablecoin volume, just like when I. Sorry.
00:12:43.904 - 00:12:55.500, Speaker A: Stablecoin circulation just went down, but now it's coming back up. So I think that, to me, is like, the most important thing, because then that would be telling you people are. Exactly. Stablecoin supply.
00:12:55.850 - 00:13:12.190, Speaker B: Maybe we can look at it here. So stablecoin supply is now. So I'm looking at this visa chart. Yeah, it's starting to trend back up. So, I mean, it ripped up, trended down in the bear market, and starting what is this month, September, October 2020.
00:13:12.570 - 00:13:14.346, Speaker A: Starting the bitcoin ETF.
00:13:14.458 - 00:13:15.162, Speaker B: Right.
00:13:15.346 - 00:13:36.786, Speaker A: You see the meme super psych. If you were to extrapolate here, like, me, market cap, that would have gone off. That's where, like, wif and some of the other things peaked, really. Um, there's a bit of a lag. Right. But generally speaking, yeah. When you see that chart go up that people want to allocate on chain, and most of the time they're probably going to allocate to some of the majors.
00:13:36.786 - 00:13:45.138, Speaker A: But I would say, like, a lot of that's like a really good barometer for people's willingness to put money on chain and punt. Kind of higher risk stuff.
00:13:45.274 - 00:13:55.506, Speaker B: Yeah. What is your. Look at these two charts. So, USDC versus tether. What is your theory on why tether just continues to print higher, whereas USDC is making a pretty slow comeback?
00:13:55.538 - 00:13:58.346, Speaker A: I'd say ex us.
00:13:58.538 - 00:13:59.310, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:14:00.490 - 00:14:22.636, Speaker A: Joe McCann has a really good newsletter. Of course we have him on the pod. He was of the mind, and I think he very accurately predicted inflows were coming in. Central banks were printing, injecting, liquidating the system, end of Q three, Q four last year, but not in the US. And then you. Anecdotally, I've talked to some of the largest funded funds that are investing in crypto funds. I've talked to crypto managers that are open ended.
00:14:22.636 - 00:14:56.762, Speaker A: So they're raising money still. Crickets. It's been a very challenged fundraising environment for crypto funds, so we still haven't seen new institutional allocation to funds. And to me, that's two things. One, we're early in the cycle still, and two, funds are not getting new capital. And so most of the money coming in is retail, probably from central banks printing money ex us so tether is more global.
00:14:56.906 - 00:15:35.842, Speaker B: So let me ask you this Joseph question, which I think to pick on. I love you Joseph. I think Joseph is sometimes a good proxy for what retail can be thinking and thats why I love asking Joseph, what are you thinking about? What do you want us to ask today? And what Joseph wanted us to ask is um, he said, I'd love for someone to play devil's advocate on meme coins, just not continuing to send if there's a next leg up this cycle. It feels like the same market conditions that led to meme coins previously are still around, except prices are higher. Even after the major correction, you've got AI coins still underperforming memes, altcoins not catching bids. Social fi had a start, but fizzled. No mega useful apps.
00:15:35.842 - 00:15:44.600, Speaker B: ETH continuing to focus on infrastructure. Why don't meme coins just continue ripping higher here if you think the market sends higher? So we'd love to hear your thoughts on that.
00:15:46.020 - 00:16:35.024, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I guess it's important to have two simultaneous conflicting theories in your brain. I'm probabilistically think the memes, if the market goes up, memes go up. The case where Joseph is describing is what scenarios does the market go up and meme coins don't go up as much or just go down? I guess certainly anything's possible. It's just a matter of probabilities. I just need to say I would describe a low probability. The event where the market goes up, I guess bitcoin can go up, bitcoin can hit an all time high, and the rest of the market may not move as much, including meme coins, then that's your theory, which is most of the capital just goes to the ETF, and then you extend that further. If we have any ETF, which sounds like we're going to have it pretty soon, then you could see a scenario where bitcoin and eth go up.
00:16:35.024 - 00:17:10.240, Speaker A: The rest of the market does not, including meme coins. And that might be for a variety of reasons, including just macro shits the bed, and it's not a soft landing. And we don't have, for a variety of reasons, I guess savings are down and people, although people tend to punt more and go to the casino during a recession. But you know, I mean, I don't know. Like it's killing. Is there going to be a resurgence in. So, with rate cuts, for instance, imagine a world where you have 50 basis point rate cuts in Q three in September.
00:17:10.240 - 00:17:54.680, Speaker A: Then I think it would make a resurgence for DeFi projects where the yields go higher. So now people are more inclined and interested in farming and capturing that juicy yield. That would be my working assumption. So maybe that on the margin, DeFi just becomes far more interesting and people just move more towards DeFi. But, like, have we had any cycle where memes haven't performed on par or better than everything else in the market? I guess memes as a category, right? I mean, it's going to be, of course, within the meme bucket, there's like a chi square distribution. Like it's a power lot. Like, there's a very few names that, like, actually command most of the market share.
00:17:54.680 - 00:18:23.826, Speaker A: Everything else kind of, like, dies away. The half life is really short. So, like, you have consolidation into, you know, last cycle is doge shib and what else? I'm missing one. This cycle, you have the pepe, you have with, you know, you have popcat and a few of these things that are kind of wanting to hit a billion, but then there's a whole slew of, like, tail end of stuff that just doesn't do well. But if I were to, there's this.
00:18:23.858 - 00:18:27.576, Speaker B: Guy that, sir, what is popcat? I've never heard of pop cat.
00:18:27.608 - 00:18:40.220, Speaker A: Pop cat is like, this cat. Uh, the whole theory is that if dogmas do really well, like cats, cats should like, um, you know, like, be some percentage of that.
00:18:40.520 - 00:18:44.408, Speaker B: Um, I don't like, say that again. Say that again.
00:18:44.464 - 00:18:47.864, Speaker A: The whole, we're doing fundamental analysis.
00:18:47.912 - 00:18:50.820, Speaker B: Slow down, slow down and just say that again and load yourself again.
00:18:52.480 - 00:19:04.728, Speaker A: Listen, listen. The idea is, and I'd love someone to come in here and be more educated on this particular topic. I'm sure I'm going to get it.
00:19:04.784 - 00:19:08.340, Speaker B: Who we should have on is, do you remember, do you know Murad?
00:19:08.880 - 00:19:11.184, Speaker A: Murad, he blew up.
00:19:11.272 - 00:19:22.194, Speaker B: He blew up, but he's like, by the way, one of the greatest podcast episodes of all time was muradous on Pomp's podcast in like, 2018, giving, like.
00:19:22.282 - 00:19:23.706, Speaker A: The market's going up.
00:19:23.738 - 00:19:42.042, Speaker B: Like, the world's most bullish bitcoin episode. That was the most articulate bitcoin episode maybe you'll ever hear in your life. Unfortunately, Murad's fun blew up because he was too bullish and got wiped out on, I think, black Thursday in March of 2020. But very eloquent speaker. He's positioned his whole fund into meme coins.
00:19:42.146 - 00:19:42.950, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:19:43.250 - 00:19:47.306, Speaker B: And he's got all these elaborate theses on how to buy meme coins. So we should bring.
00:19:47.458 - 00:20:10.408, Speaker A: Yeah, the theory, popcat is, yeah, I, if dogs do well, cats should do well as well, maybe on a more relative basis. And it's like that. It's like that spread of, like, bitcoin dominance is like dog dominance for meme coins. Again, this point on Murad, by the way, I think he's a. He's not a dumb individual. I mean, prince, a guy, like, smart, articulate. Position sizing.
00:20:10.408 - 00:20:34.860, Speaker A: Long term capital management. That book I mentioned last podcast, like the forgotten billionaires, it's all about position sizing, by the way. It's written by a guy, Victor, who was at long term capital management, ex Lehman. It's all about position sizing. Every fund that blows up. You might have a right thesis, but if you're using leverage or the position sizing is off, you're gonna blow up or lose money anyways, just as an anecdote. But Marat, you know, no more than welcome.
00:20:34.860 - 00:20:45.396, Speaker A: Come in here and educate us about memes. Because I'm a noob. I'm just very simple. I just literally own one or two.
00:20:45.428 - 00:20:49.570, Speaker B: Maybe in 2016, I was working at this venture firm and would walk into.
00:20:50.230 - 00:20:58.486, Speaker A: By the way, is this the first time on the record that I've heard this? Because I had no idea. I mean, I was a VC, ladies and gentlemen.
00:20:58.638 - 00:21:12.690, Speaker B: I mean, nah, nah. But I'd walk into my boss's office, there are these, like, angry old sterns, like Bear Stearns, Lehman brothers guys. And I would walk into my boss's office, his name was Tim, and I would show him, like, I was trying to get them to do some crypto deals.
00:21:13.470 - 00:21:14.054, Speaker A: I think.
00:21:14.142 - 00:21:40.392, Speaker B: I think they looked at, like, maybe like a bit bitgo series a or b or something, or Coinbase is series b or c or something like that. And I would show them. They're like, all right, fine, send me some information. So I'd send them like, crypto panda on Reddit, or like crypto Bobby doing a big Twitter thread. And they're like, look, I'm not listening to, I'm not listening to cryptopanda about this new asset class. Talk about this new asset class. Like, get out of my room, kid.
00:21:40.392 - 00:22:02.504, Speaker B: And I'm picturing Santi, you talking to these big macro funds, and then they're like, look, guys, you gotta go listen to this Santi guy in Empire. And then they listen and you're like, I don't even know the name of it. Bobcat or Popcat or whatever. You're like, look, the thesis is cats more than dogs. Let's talk about some. Let's talk about some of the other news of the week.
00:22:02.632 - 00:22:11.602, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure. So there's, by the way, we rounded up this discussion on, was this a sufficient, like, I don't know if sufficiently clear answer of, like, in a scenario where memes go down, the market goes up.
00:22:11.736 - 00:22:25.206, Speaker B: Oh, maybe I'd ask you to round out the conversation like you mentioned sizing. How do you then think about sizing of meme coins? Because I know you're very bullish on wif, for example. But is wif 1% of your liquid crypto portfolio or five or ten or 50 or.
00:22:25.238 - 00:22:35.450, Speaker A: No, it's greater than ten. Yeah, it's a top two position. Top five. Not by dollars invested, to be fair.
00:22:35.990 - 00:22:39.420, Speaker B: So the capital, capital that sits in the account.
00:22:39.500 - 00:22:50.124, Speaker A: Pure appreciation of it. Yeah. And so that then requires a whole set of things. We won't go into this podcast of how you manage a position over time.
00:22:50.252 - 00:22:56.060, Speaker B: But do you ever hedge a position? Like, will you do? Will you hedge? Or you're just like, if I don't like it anymore, I'll just sell it.
00:22:56.140 - 00:23:06.510, Speaker A: I don't short. Yeah, I don't short. I'll go to cash. I'll rotate to something else. I don't do pair trades. Like, I tweeted about ondo Maker. Yeah, I'm sure someone's gonna look at that and say that FTB converges.
00:23:06.510 - 00:23:14.510, Speaker A: I am not. Shorting is something that I never want to bet against, I never want to do. Because your loss is uncapped.
00:23:14.630 - 00:23:15.118, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:23:15.214 - 00:23:17.038, Speaker A: And it's a timing game.
00:23:17.174 - 00:23:29.022, Speaker B: I had a neighbor growing up, he was a short only hedge fund manager. And I just thought this man, he was also one of those people who doesn't have to sleep. He would sleep like 2 hours a night. Just thought this man was nuts.
00:23:29.126 - 00:24:02.550, Speaker A: So this is why Peter Thiels probably said it best. The difference between an optimist and a pessimist. I tend to think that short sellers are like, skewed pessimists. It's like, if you're going to test, an optimist is like, you can say, hey, so most of the time when you say, I may get an a, and if you don't, you know, you may land somewhere in the middle. But a pessimist is someone that says, I'm definitely going to get an f, and you most of the time get an f. Right? If you go into an exam saying, I'm gonna get an f, you're most likely gonna get an f. That's a pessimist.
00:24:02.550 - 00:24:21.662, Speaker A: An optimist is like, I don't know. Like, I don't really know. It, but it's not saying you're getting it an f. And so, yeah, like, you're hedging your response. But, yeah, I think Peter Thiel summoned to that effect. And I just think short sellers are, like, incredibly cynical or skeptical, and most of the time, don't make money. There's good ones out there.
00:24:21.726 - 00:24:37.628, Speaker B: Let's. Let's talk about. Let's talk about some of the news from this week. A lot of it was related to what I would call. I'd call it two buckets. One was elites getting behind bitcoin and, uh, Trump and political decisions. So I'd actually love to just talk about JD Vance first.
00:24:37.628 - 00:25:06.584, Speaker B: I think there are two. Uh, there's, like, the headline crypto news, which is, um, Trump picks J. So Trump picked JD Vance as his. As his running mate. Um, and this, like, the. The headline crypto news is that this means, for the first time ever, we have a bitcoin holder on the presidential ballot. So, for context, like, and I think that's very cool, but there's actually, I think, a much more interesting, like, political lens on this.
00:25:06.584 - 00:25:17.656, Speaker B: Why? I think it was just such a smart decision. So I'd love to talk about that. I think it's there. I don't know if. Do you want to talk about that? Is that interesting? It's not even a crypto, of course.
00:25:17.688 - 00:26:04.642, Speaker A: I mean, everyone is asking for context. Everyone's asking, is JD Vance pro crypto? What is his views on that? As soon as that came out, should I get background? I mean, I knew about JD Vance 2016. He put out his book, which is New York Times bestseller. I think it was a Pulitzer Prize nominee. I don't think he won the hillbilly OG, which is this idea. Like, he grew up in a really rural, poor area of Appalachia, where most of his classmates were, like, ended up being, unfortunately, meth heads or didn't go to school, didn't go to college. His point, at a time where inequality in the US has continued to grow, his point was sort of very refreshing, which was, no, the system gives you the opportunity.
00:26:04.642 - 00:26:21.196, Speaker A: I went to public school. Everyone in my class had the opportunity to go. It was free. I went. I applied myself. Then he went to college, then he went to, I think it was Yale. Got his law degree there, and then worked at a venture fund, a pretty good one at that.
00:26:21.196 - 00:26:42.694, Speaker A: And so that was, like, where I stopped, 2016. And then I was like, oh, wow, it's actually this guy. And then he went to politics. He was, like, an Ohio senator, I believe yeah. So that's the TLDR on this. Put politics aside. That's like a self made man, and I respect that a lot.
00:26:42.694 - 00:26:46.190, Speaker A: I think that represents a lot of what America stands for and what makes it great.
00:26:46.350 - 00:26:53.638, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah. He's done so. Right. He was Marine in the. In the Marine. He was in the Marine Corps, deployed to Iraq from 2003 to 20 07.
00:26:53.638 - 00:27:11.680, Speaker B: 20 07, 20 09, went to Ohio state. Yeah. Buckeyes. 2010 to 2013, went to Yale Law School. Then he started. That's when he kind of started writing his book and stuff. He worked as a law clerk in the US.
00:27:11.680 - 00:27:31.098, Speaker B: I think it was in Kentucky. I'm pretty sure he was a law clerk. Then he went to. I think he went to Sidley Austin, practiced law. And then 2016, obviously, he kind of got put on the map, wrote the memoir, hillbilly Elegy, or eulogy, whatever the title is. And then 2016, I think after the book, Peter Thiel hired him to. To work at, um.
00:27:31.098 - 00:27:34.826, Speaker B: What's his venture fund? Mitral. Mithril capital.
00:27:34.898 - 00:27:36.098, Speaker A: Sickest family office.
00:27:36.234 - 00:27:37.430, Speaker B: Yeah. And then.
00:27:37.730 - 00:27:41.154, Speaker A: Which, by the way, that family office was. Has been pretty good in buying bitcoin.
00:27:41.282 - 00:27:41.546, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:27:41.578 - 00:27:42.858, Speaker A: Oh, yeah. Very well.
00:27:42.914 - 00:28:14.190, Speaker B: And then 2017 moves to Ohio, becomes a keep, continues being a VC, but I think leaves Peter Thiel's fund, I'm pretty sure starts focusing on investments in startups, kind of in like, as he called it, the American Heartland, 2022. He does that for like five years. 2022, elected as us senator for Ohio, 2023, obviously sworn in. And then 2024, we get this big announcement. So that's kind of the resume from a political perspective, because, you know, I like to nerd out on this stuff. It's not even related to crypto. People did not think JD Vance was going to get elected.
00:28:14.190 - 00:28:49.490, Speaker B: People thought it was going to be. People thought you kind of had to appeal to. People thought it was maybe going to be Vivek or Nikki Haley or whoever's one of the other. Another candidate, basically. JD Vance, I think, is such an interesting strategic choice because he sits at the intersection of, basically the two groups of the GOP. Right now. On one side of the GOP, you have the middle America, whites in Appalachia, that kind of group, working class Americans.
00:28:49.490 - 00:29:49.114, Speaker B: And then on the other side, you have this new group that's came into the market, came into the party, which is like the new tech oligarch class, like the Peter Thiels of the world and chamath and David Sacks and people like that. And I think his ascent, like JD Vance's pick or like, his ascension kind of speaks to the influence of, like, the new right wing conservative tech elite. But then his policy positions of, like, isolationism, restoring manufacturing, restricting immigration, those are all theoretically beneficial to, like, the, you know, forgotten working class. And I think it's just, I think it's a very, very, very savvy pick, because the Trump, like, how, I think a big question is, like, how will the Trump administration or campaign deliver to both of those groups? I think that remains to be seen. Right. Those two groups have very, very, very different asks. And you can only expend so much political capital to satisfy those two coalitions.
00:29:49.114 - 00:30:08.286, Speaker B: So picking someone who sits at the intersection both satisfies. Satisfies both of those. I think the other interesting thing is it shows how confident Trump is that he's going to win. Right. If you were not as confident, you would have to kind of court the old school conservative campaign beliefs, which is.
00:30:08.318 - 00:30:10.750, Speaker A: Like, you know, he had that in the back.
00:30:10.870 - 00:30:30.284, Speaker B: Well, the old school, the old school go peers, if you were trying to appeal to them, you would have picked Nikki Haley. If you were trying to do. Then there's, like, trying to appeal to the evangelicals. Right? That's why he picked Mike. Mike Pence in 2016. Vance is this, like, new right candidate who despises the institutional GOP. And he either.
00:30:30.284 - 00:30:43.604, Speaker B: So Trump either, this tells me Trump either clearly sees those groups as either already in the bag or now irrelevant, which is just an interesting evolution of the GOP political party. But I just think it marks this turning point.
00:30:43.652 - 00:31:02.378, Speaker A: So, yeah, no, it definitely chose. Look, I'm not political expert. I'm not even gonna go into it, nor is this a political pod. It's relevant for crypto unlike. And we should get into Vitalik's blog post, by the way. Correction. So he actually did not, I believe, worked at Mithril.
00:31:02.378 - 00:31:34.390, Speaker A: He ended up raising money. He started a venture fund, I believe I'm looking at here. So he, he worked initially in Revolution Capital that was founded by Steve Case, who was the co founder of AOL. It was like a pretty hot VC. May still be, but not really. And then in 2019, he co founded a fund called Narya Capital in Cincinnati. And he ended up raising money from Thiel, Eric Schmidt, Mark Andreesse, and a bunch of other people.
00:31:34.390 - 00:31:53.600, Speaker A: And I think he raised 93 million. So, you know, he's investing in, like, the middle, as he pointed out, like kind of industrial middle America kind of thing. So he has a connection with Yale, which is obviously ultra like. Right. But he's, I don't think he worked for Mithril, just FYI.
00:31:54.380 - 00:32:01.596, Speaker B: I think he did. I've got it. And axios says he got connected with Peter teal Veer two year stint at Mithril Capital. But either way. Either way.
00:32:01.628 - 00:32:03.278, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I mean just looking at.
00:32:03.294 - 00:32:28.848, Speaker B: Wikipedia, there's a great, there's a, we won't summarize it because it's a 30 Minutes video, but he, he y combinator asked JD Vance to give a talk on policy on his basically like tech policy I would call it. And there's a, that video is floating around Twitter. Maybe we can find it and put it in the show notes. But for people who want to find out his like JD Vance is broader stances on tech policy. I would recommend watching that video for sure.
00:32:28.944 - 00:33:12.226, Speaker A: Yeah, I think there's also really good videos circling around of like he's talking about crypto and particularly around social media and the role of tokenization and how it's important. And his point is something to the effect of like most of the smartest founders and investors are actively paying attention more and more to crypto and it's like it's going to be more difficult for incumbents to like compete in a world where you have, sorry, for legacy firms to compete against startups that are leveraging this technology. So I think hes pro crypto, although I havent seen more to that or his views particularly.
00:33:12.378 - 00:33:13.070, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:33:13.770 - 00:33:22.602, Speaker A: What is interesting though is if you look at polymarket, which by the way, I was catching Bichain and ECC, they hired uh, Nate, uh, was it Nate.
00:33:22.626 - 00:33:27.322, Speaker B: Tiller from uh, crazy hire? I actually want to. Crazy amazing higher, which we can.
00:33:27.346 - 00:33:27.826, Speaker A: Amazing higher.
00:33:27.898 - 00:33:28.346, Speaker B: I love that.
00:33:28.378 - 00:33:51.760, Speaker A: Yeah. Um, he has a great book too. So the odds of, of Trump, obviously, after the unfortunate incident, um, like jumped from 60% ish to all the way to 70. Was it like 70? I saw up to 77% and then they've sort of subsided. They're now back to kind of close to where they were before all of this happened. So they spiked a bit. They're now still at 66%.
00:33:51.760 - 00:34:15.040, Speaker A: There's like a quarter of a billion dollars betting on this market. So I think it's a pretty high signal. So yeah, I'm curious, I guess, on the, I don't know if you read anything into that, the fact that the odds have kind of come down and are back to where they were before the assassination attempt.
00:34:15.670 - 00:34:26.902, Speaker B: Um, no, I mean, the Biden campaign put out something that said that he, he would consider dropping out if there was a medical condition. And I think that tweeted, I'm sick with no thread.
00:34:26.966 - 00:34:28.134, Speaker A: Like, it was like.
00:34:28.302 - 00:34:47.372, Speaker B: Yeah. And so, you know, maybe that pulled it back down. I think if you look at. If you compare, like, predict it to poly market, to, like, polymarket tends to skew, actually more in Trump's favor if you look at the betting odds, because the people, and I think the theory there is the people betting on polymarket tend to be more crypto native, and therefore more.
00:34:47.436 - 00:34:48.524, Speaker A: They want crypto to win.
00:34:48.612 - 00:34:54.836, Speaker B: Right. Yeah. So anything politically related, like, Trump might be 65%, but then unpredicted, it's 60%.
00:34:54.908 - 00:34:59.600, Speaker A: So can we, um, talk briefly about Vitalik's post?
00:35:00.260 - 00:35:12.774, Speaker B: Yeah. To close the loop on JD, the last thing to add about him is he. I would call him very pro crypto. There's, um. Just. I pulled a couple of different things. Like 2021, he issued a statement opposing an amendment to the infrastructure bill.
00:35:12.774 - 00:35:47.896, Speaker B: And his reason for opposing it, he said it would amount to a backdoor ban of bitcoin and other popular cryptocurrencies. 2022, he disclosed that he held between 100 to bitcoin. And then 2023, he actually introduced a bill that would protect crypto firms and exchanges from being cut off from traditional banks. That was around the time of choke point. So, um, I think there are other things that are not great about JD Vance, but from a purely crypto perspective, I would say he is a very pro crypto vice president.
00:35:48.008 - 00:36:19.620, Speaker A: I want to make a pause here to recap all the crazy timeline that over the last seven days. Right. You had an assassination of Trump, attempt on Trump, dodged by inches. God knows what would happen if he hadn't moved his head. And nomination of a vice president that is very pro crypto, understands industry. You had the Paxos SeC lawsuit dropped. You have Jamie Dimon, which he tweeted about changing his tune on crypto.
00:36:19.620 - 00:36:27.522, Speaker A: Also rumors that he might be the nominee for. What is it, the treasury role?
00:36:27.626 - 00:36:28.266, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:36:28.418 - 00:36:32.750, Speaker A: And what else on the regulatory side of things I'm missing?
00:36:34.250 - 00:36:41.474, Speaker B: Did you say the stable coin Sec dropped their stablecoin investigation with Paxos? Yeah.
00:36:41.602 - 00:36:46.230, Speaker A: Yeah, that. I also saw a headline that State street is looking at getting into the stablecoin business.
00:36:47.050 - 00:36:48.938, Speaker B: Yeah. I don't know that more.
00:36:48.994 - 00:36:49.698, Speaker A: That is.
00:36:49.834 - 00:36:54.594, Speaker B: I think it feels pretty private blockchain. I think that's not as real of a thing.
00:36:54.722 - 00:37:25.620, Speaker A: Yeah. On that point, because people are all texting me like, oh, what are you reading to Jamie Dimon? Jamie Dimon has been vocal about, like, critical of, like, bitcoin, crypto, internally though we've had on the pod the JP Morgan team that has been pursuing like Onyx and there's been internal efforts at JP Morgan, quite substantial, I would say, which is sort of like to me the most important thing. I don't know. People might be saying, how real is that?
00:37:25.740 - 00:37:50.876, Speaker B: I don't know what your, my take on it is. I mean, Jamie Dimon definitely doesn't like bitcoin. So his company has a 300 to three. Like JPMorgan has a 300 plus person blockchain team. And we had an interview actually with Tyron who either runs that team or is like second in command over there. And so you guys can go listen to it if you want. But J, like let me read you these quotes from Jamie Dimon.
00:37:50.876 - 00:38:11.100, Speaker B: He said this, and this is a man who said, quote, satoshi is going to come on there, laugh hysterically, go quiet and then all the bitcoin is going to get replaced. How the hell do you know it's going to stop at 21? It's a hyped up fraud. It's a pet rock. That was earlier this year at Davos. And then another quote, this is from last year. He said, I personally think bitcoin is worthless. I could care less about bitcoin.
00:38:11.100 - 00:38:23.010, Speaker B: If you're stupid enough to buy it, you'll pay the price one day. This is the last time I will ever answer a question about bitcoin. The other day my daughter sent me an email saying she owns two bitcoin. This is my smart daughter. Well, my formerly smart daughter.
00:38:23.470 - 00:38:23.870, Speaker A: Wow.
00:38:23.910 - 00:38:41.822, Speaker B: So he definitely doesn't like bitcoin. However, Larry Fink used to say similar things. Like people can change, change their mind when, like either putting, when someone who is more powerful than them twists their arm or when their capitalist incentives line up.
00:38:41.886 - 00:38:50.774, Speaker A: And like my theory around that is there's a lot of money to be made by selling the CTF product. And Wall street now can make money on crypto.
00:38:50.822 - 00:38:53.982, Speaker B: Also, if you bank with JP Morgan, like they're the, are, they're probably the.
00:38:54.006 - 00:38:56.254, Speaker A: Largest, largest bank in the world, I.
00:38:56.262 - 00:38:56.934, Speaker B: Think in the world.
00:38:56.982 - 00:39:00.950, Speaker A: Like how HSBC may be the largest, but JPMorgan is not far and certainly in the US.
00:39:01.030 - 00:39:28.272, Speaker B: How many people bank with JPMorgan? And this is so the private bank for people who don't know is where. So they'll make a lot of their money from people who have maybe assets of, I think it's what 10 million or more is the, is the minimum to bank with JPMorgan. You have 10 million or more assets. You get a private banker and you can basically do all of your investments and all of your activities through JPMorgan. They make a lot of money that way. The number of people who are saying, wait, I can't hold my bitcoin here. I can't buy bitcoin through you guys.
00:39:28.272 - 00:39:37.120, Speaker B: This is, this is ridiculous. Um, I've got Larry Fink going on CNBC saying we're buying bitcoin and JPMorgan won't let me buy it. So Jamie Dimon, positive.
00:39:37.160 - 00:39:38.448, Speaker A: As soon as you start losing business, right?
00:39:38.464 - 00:39:52.180, Speaker B: It's like. Exactly. So there was a Forbes article where it said Trump, actually, Forbes quoted Trump saying, Jamie Dimon has, quote, suddenly changed his tune on bitcoin. I have mixed thoughts.
00:39:52.680 - 00:40:01.540, Speaker A: That'll be amazing. I mean, of course I have ton of respect. I love JP Morgan. That was my house, my home, starting off my career. I'll do it again. So that would be amazing.
00:40:04.120 - 00:40:30.200, Speaker B: But don't forget Trump. Like, Trump picked the Goldman. Gary Cohn. Gary Cohn was his, I think was treasury secretary for the first year or two before getting fired. This episode is brought to you by. Say believes that the EVM is here to stay.

So I'm going to tell you what it means in my, in my words. There's all these things popping up, l two s and l three s, and it's chaos. Right? If you are building something, you no longer have to worry about bootstrapping liquidity. You can basically just build in the ag layer to tap into the liquidity of the ag layer. And the users of the ag layer, you get the users, you get the liquidity. It's the ag layer.

00:43:48.986 - 00:43:50.738, Speaker A: I mean, every other day he's going out.
00:43:50.794 - 00:44:07.110, Speaker B: Oh, let me, let me, let me read you this. I'm going to read, let me just monitor, quote for a second. So Larry Finko's on CNBC. Jim Cramer asks him about bitcoin. He goes, I'm just going to quote, read this whole thing. He goes, as you know, I was a skeptic. I was a proud skeptic and I studied it.
00:44:07.110 - 00:44:34.486, Speaker B: But then I learned about it and I came away and said, my opinion the last five years has been wrong. So here's what I believe today. This is Larry Fink on Bitcoin said, I believe bitcoin is legitimate. It is now a legitimate financial instrument that allows you to have a uncorrelated type of returns. I believe it's an instrument you invest in when you are frightened. It's an instrument you invest in when you believe that countries are debasing their currencies by excess deficits. I believe we have countries where you are frightened for your everyday existence.
00:44:34.486 - 00:45:07.342, Speaker B: And now you have the ability to invest in something that is outside of your country's control, giving you more financial freedom. I'm a big believer that there's now role for bitcoin in people's financial portfolios. I believe you're going to see that as one of the. I believe you're going to see that as one of the assets we all look at one day. I look at it as digital gold, and I think there's a real need for everyone to look at it as an alternative to optimism in the world if you want to hedge. Bitcoin is not a vehicle for hope. It is a vehicle for people being able to express their fear about something in the world.
00:45:07.342 - 00:45:36.710, Speaker B: There is now a great industrial use for it. So the summary of that is, if you believe that your country is going to experience dollar currency debasement, if you cannot get access to a bank account in your country, if you believe that there's chaos in the world and you need a way to hedge, the way to express that trade used to be maybe by shorting something and buying gold or something, or buying gold. And Larry Fink says, look, there's now a good new way to do that, and it's by buying bitcoin.
00:45:37.010 - 00:46:07.348, Speaker A: Agreed. And the marginal, the ratio of people that are doing that is extremely slow, small. So there's been. There's no surprise, right? The us fiscal situation is untenable. Everyone agrees with that. The question is, at what point will the market one disagree with that and then bring it to its knees and humble a country, if it's not the US, any other country would have already been humbled by the market. Yet people continue to buy treasuries like the demand for that.
00:46:07.348 - 00:46:19.280, Speaker A: These auctions have not subsided. There's. It's simply gonna be a day of reckoning. It's a. Yeah, go listen to Ray Dalio, Sand Dragon Miller. Everyone agrees. It's like it's an unsustainable budget.
00:46:19.280 - 00:47:11.000, Speaker A: What is it now like? I want to say up to 40% of the spending of the government goes to cover interest expense or more so anyways, a bit unsustainable. However, Japan's been this situation for a while, yada yada, yada. The thing that most people seem to think. So what happens in a scenario where macro really takes a shit? What happens in a scenario where the market wakes up to this? And at what point does that happen and what does that mean for bitcoin or other assets? Where do you hide? And I think the conclusion that ive heard from most people that are way smarter than me on macro, again, the same people ive talked to this week was like, I think you just want to be in assets that historically, or you believe going forward are going to beat inflation, whatever that rate may be. So what are those historically? Its been real estate. Its treated you very well. Gold to some extent.
00:47:11.000 - 00:48:01.582, Speaker A: Maybe a basket of other currencies like swiss franchise, maybe you can look at some of the gulf currencies, but they're small, there's not enough. So that's where people like Mark Cuban goes out and says, hey, well, in that scenario where bitcoin catches a real bid, where's the ceiling for that? Now, not only that, the second point I want to make is which we've talked about it here at length, is stable coins. Going back to stable coins, it's mostly us denominated. And they're just increasing the demand for dollars globally. Everyone wants to hold dollars, continues to want to hold dollars. So this is like, if you're Jamie dim going into the position, right, as the secretary of treasury, what is the most important thing that you're monitoring? That the demand for dollars continues to be strong.
00:48:01.766 - 00:48:02.470, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:48:02.630 - 00:48:31.670, Speaker A: And stable coins don't interfere with that. Regulated stablecoins like USDC is a godsend tether, as an organization holds, he's like a top five or top ten holder of treasuries. You have a constant buyer for treasuries and it's coming from this world that historically hasn't had easy access to whole dollars. Right. It's all been black market Argentina. It's not. And so this just immediately increases the ability for people anywhere in the world to hold dollars.
00:48:31.670 - 00:48:33.954, Speaker A: Wouldn't you want, like, why would you be against that?
00:48:34.002 - 00:48:36.994, Speaker B: Yeah, you have an infinite bid for treasuries. Yeah.
00:48:37.162 - 00:49:01.338, Speaker A: You know what I mean? And so I think he's seeing that the other thing that now people are like, of course, putting their super bullish cap on his. Imagine like, what is the probability? And Shane and Nate, if you're here, I'd love to get your thoughts on this, but like, what is the probability of some, like, of Trump going out saying, hey, we're actually going to hold bitcoin in reserve. And you had two.
00:49:01.474 - 00:49:04.250, Speaker B: Well, Trump's got his talk at the bitcoin conference.
00:49:04.330 - 00:49:10.418, Speaker A: People are speculating about it. I mean, imagine that scenario. Let's just be, you know, drink the.
00:49:10.434 - 00:49:12.802, Speaker B: Kool aid for, oh, my God, Santi's putting on a hat.
00:49:12.906 - 00:49:55.912, Speaker A: I know, right? Not that we needed it. We always queue bullish here. You had Germany sell close to 3 billion of bitcoin. So you're telling me that you're selling a hard asset to buy for euros that you can print. And imagine a country like the US says, no, we're actually going to print money to buy bitcoin, if that. I mean, two couldn't be polar opposites, you know, who I'm betting against. But I mean, if you're a central government, like, realistically, if you're in that position, like, whether you want to be public about it or not, but, yeah, I would print, you know, fiat and buy bitcoin, hold it in reserve.
00:49:55.936 - 00:50:04.064, Speaker B: That's what I was talking about last week. Germany is selling and El Salvador is buying. And this is a hard asset and a commodity that is moving from one government to another.
00:50:04.232 - 00:50:40.058, Speaker A: Of course, we've all seen how the president of El Salvador has taken it to the chin when bitcoin went down from 60 to 20 and he was mocked and ridiculed. Now, the impact of what is transpiring now, even regardless of whether Trump or someone like Jamie Dim goes out and says that publicly, I think, again, the narrative is intact. We had an ETF that legitimizes assassin class. Incredibly. And you best believe that this has just become. You couldn't even whisper bitcoin when I was a JP Morgan. The elevator.
00:50:40.058 - 00:50:44.808, Speaker A: I mean, and that has been the case for forever. Until recently.
00:50:44.984 - 00:50:45.856, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:50:46.048 - 00:50:49.048, Speaker A: That can't be overstated. Do you agree or do you disagree?
00:50:49.144 - 00:50:50.984, Speaker B: I agree, I agree. I mean, I think.
00:50:51.032 - 00:50:52.780, Speaker A: Why? Why are people trade?
00:50:53.120 - 00:51:19.062, Speaker B: You mentioned the Mark Cuban thing. The Mark Cuban thing. Let me just read this, this tweet for anyone who missed it. He said, here's a contrary opinion on the. By the way, for context, Mark Cuban does not like Trump and does not want, I think, does not want Trump to win. He's been pretty vocally against Trump, but he said, look, here's a contrary opinion on the emergence of Silicon Valley support for former President Trump, which, like all opinions on here, probably won't be popular. It's a bitcoin play.
00:51:19.062 - 00:51:58.690, Speaker B: Not because the former president is a far stronger proponent of crypto. That's nice, but it doesn't really impact the price of crypto. It makes it easier to operate a crypto business because of the inevitable and required changes at the SEC. What's going to drive the price of bitcoin is lower tax rates and tariffs, which, if history is any guide, and it's not, always will be inflationary. Combine that with the global uncertainty as the geopolitical role of the USA and the impact on the us dollars reserve currency, and you can't align the stars any better for a bitcoin price acceleration. So how high can the price go? And again, this is Mark Cuban continues in part two. How high can the price go? Way higher than you think.
00:51:58.690 - 00:52:36.810, Speaker B: Remember, the market for bitcoin is global, and the supply has a final limit of 21 million with unlimited fractionalization. Keep that in mind as you consider what happens if, because of geopolitical uncertainty and the decline of the dollar as the reserve currency, bitcoin becomes a safe haven globally. Which means that bitcoin could be what countries and all of us look to buy as a means to protect our savings. Crazy. It already happens in countries facing hyperinflation. And if things really go further than we can imagine today, and I'm not saying they will, just that this has a possibility somewhere above zero, then bitcoin becomes exactly what the maxis envisioned, a global currency.
00:52:38.430 - 00:53:43.292, Speaker A: There you have it. I mean, I don't know much bitcoin, but I think it's ultimate meme, right? I mean, of course, once you hit 80, 90, once it clears 100, what's stopping you from 150? And then once it hits 200, I mean, it gets memed into existence. Like, what's stopping from a million, of course, flows. I'm not dumb, but I was having a conversation with the founder today, and I referenced one of my favorite books, which is scale by Jeffrey west. And basically, this point is, the brain doesn't understand exponential phenomena, and that continues to happen in this world as we're becoming more connected and capital is moving freely. Yeah, I think the size of the market, like, imagine, like, bitcoin at a million, would entail a pretty large market cap at that. But if central banks come on board, or even a large institutional place, certainly possible people should go.
00:53:43.292 - 00:53:56.160, Speaker A: Listen to Kathie Wood. Of course, she's not afraid to put out bold predictions. Um, not just on crypto, but also on things like Tesla and. Yeah, what was your prediction? 150,000? 250,000?
00:53:57.380 - 00:53:59.180, Speaker B: No, I think it was 1.5 million.
00:53:59.260 - 00:54:20.590, Speaker A: Oh, 1.5 million. There you go. Yeah. Yeah. In many ways, it's pretty refreshing to have people outside the industry, newcomers, come in and be less cynical, because I think there's a phenomenon where the longer you stay in crypto and you see cycle is like, you can turn cynical. Not, you should always be skeptical, but cynical is just.
00:54:20.590 - 00:54:57.250, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's, like, pollutes the mind in many ways. And you're like, you become, like, incredibly, you know. And I think that probably happened, too, in the Internet and other technological revolutions. I don't know if Carlota Perez talks explicitly about this, but, like, if, say, you lose money, then you become, like, disheartened, and then all of a sudden, you don't believe in this tech and you don't believe in memes. You get burned and, like, you hate it, and then you walk away. And, yeah, in many ways, maybe tradfi is what probably makes the most amount of money in this asset class over the next ten years, then, like, crypto, geez, you know what I mean? Vitalik's post.
00:54:58.310 - 00:54:59.246, Speaker B: Do I. What?
00:54:59.398 - 00:55:21.082, Speaker A: Vitalik's post. Just to round up the political discussion. Crypto is political whether you like it or not. The Vitalik puts out a blog post. We're not gonna go in too much detail. People should go read it if you want. But he says something to the effect of, you shouldn't vote specifically for candidates that are pro crypto.
00:55:21.082 - 00:55:31.274, Speaker A: You should take a longer term view and vote for. Make a decision that is not just purely based on ideologies. Single issue.
00:55:31.442 - 00:55:33.990, Speaker B: Reminds me of an op ed that came out a couple of weeks ago.
00:55:35.570 - 00:55:41.936, Speaker A: Right, exactly. Well, you guys tied into the stick.
00:55:42.088 - 00:55:44.752, Speaker B: I saw that. I saw that pose. Go on.
00:55:44.776 - 00:55:46.312, Speaker A: The response was quite different.
00:55:46.456 - 00:55:53.080, Speaker B: I was like, I was like, a, Vitalik's about to write the same post we just wrote and get away. Get away with it.
00:55:53.120 - 00:55:55.860, Speaker A: And b, well, yeah, the favoritism is.
00:55:56.360 - 00:56:00.392, Speaker B: Be godspeed, Vitalik, because you are also about to get shredded online.
00:56:00.536 - 00:56:37.972, Speaker A: Well, he was shredded on a number of, I mean, vaccination. People, like the mob likes the comments. My point is, look, it's not a practical post. It's like, people need to vote. And so, like, I get it. I get what he's trying to say, which is be long term, have a long term mindset. But let's just ground the discussion, right? We've been in a very hostile environment, and how do you expect people to react to that? I mean, I think the reality of things, and you're far better political expert than I am.
00:56:37.972 - 00:57:00.902, Speaker A: I'm not, but something that I've appreciated, and I love your take on, is this idea that political dynamics across the world have unfortunately become more polarizing. Not just in the US. You have extreme left, extreme right. You're seeing it in Europe, in France, in the UK, in the Netherlands, in Germany, across Latin America. It's just extreme right, extreme left. In large part. I have my reasons.
00:57:00.902 - 00:57:42.380, Speaker A: I think inequality, disenfranchisement, this feeling of, like, no one's serving you, so you need to go to extremes. So, unfortunately, Polis, when you're going to vote, it's like you're cornered into taking a far extreme right, either left or right. And so you just have to put it in that context. And when you do, then you say, okay, you invert and you say, it's not so much as choosing who's pro crypto. It's just more so not voting for someone that's very much against its existence. Right. If your livelihood depends on it, if you truly believe you're here, you believe this technology can have a meaningful impact and be positive for society and really change.
00:57:42.380 - 00:58:00.304, Speaker A: I believe it. Then how would you not vote? I guess. Who in their right mind would vote for someone that is extremely hostile and has been. It's not a. I mean, it's. I don't know. Like, I don't know how other way to say it, but it's like, I take.
00:58:00.304 - 00:58:28.290, Speaker A: I'm thinking long term, as much as Vitalik is here, I'm not thinking in four year terms. I'm thinking, how do I make sure that this industry thrives? Because I believe its potential. I think it fits to solve so many things. It's not perfect, but it's not perfect in large part because it's been handicapped by the. And so when I see a window of opportunity, I don't. It's not to say that I agree with policies. Either let extreme left or extreme right.
00:58:28.290 - 00:58:59.764, Speaker A: I don't necessarily believe in, like, you know, I mean, like, other topics outside of crypto, like abortion or, you know, where foreign aid goes or whatever other policies that you might get know, a politician needs to talk about. Um, but I just think. I don't know. Like, I'm not. First of all, I'm not voting in the US, but, like, if I could, I don't know, like, I'm not going to vote for someone that's hostile to the industry. Simple as that. I'm not going to maybe abstain, but, like, I want to vote.
00:58:59.764 - 00:59:22.292, Speaker A: So what do you do? Yeah, I don't know. I think it's one of those, here's where people are just like, very ideological, is grounded to the fucking ground. And what are, like, you know what I mean? Like, just give a sense of reality. It's so abstract, and it's kind of frustrating to see that, especially coming from him. And I agree. I get his point. I get his message, and maybe in his position, I would do the same.
00:59:22.292 - 00:59:24.880, Speaker A: I'm not in his position to have to speak more freely.
00:59:26.940 - 01:00:03.908, Speaker B: So I thought Molly Jane's piece on blockworks was much better than Vitalik's piece. Vitalik was asked because Vitalik's piece centered her on one question. He said, if a politician is pro crypto, the key question to ask is, are they in it for the right reasons? Do they have a vision of how technology and politics and economy should, should go in the 21st century century, and does that align with yours? And do they have a good, positive vision that goes beyond near term concerns? And if they do, then great, you should support them. And, but if not, like, if not, don't, don't vote for them. What I'd say to Vitalik is, like, that is the most unicorns and, like, fairy tale.
01:00:04.004 - 01:00:05.732, Speaker A: What's a real politic, you know, like.
01:00:05.756 - 01:00:26.400, Speaker B: What'S a benchmark way tale idea of, like, what a politician is? And, like, they're good luck trying to, like, this idea of are they in it for the right reasons? Like, at the highest levels of politics, they're, they're in it for the power of politics and to be at that level. And that is my, like, extremely. I think at the congressional difference between.
01:00:26.740 - 01:00:28.468, Speaker A: Theory and practice, speaker one, I think.
01:00:28.484 - 01:00:50.188, Speaker B: In local politics, people, like, really do get involved for the right reasons. And, like, even at the congressional level, people get involved at the right reasons. But at the presidential level, like, why is Trump going pro crypto? Honestly, I don't think Trump gives a damn about crypto. I think he's, I think he's just realizes that, like, the fair shake pack, the third largest pack, because it's for.
01:00:50.204 - 01:01:53.472, Speaker A: The reasons that we've been advocating for this technology, because you're seeing entrepreneurs leave the US, because, you know, you see that it's, you know, stablecoin is increasing the demand for us dollars because you want to keep the us is at the forefront of innovation because it's becoming a frontier of tech. Like, what more reasons do you want? I mean, it's, it's, it's, again, like, yeah, I don't know what to say. It's other than, like, people have interests and like Jamie Dimon or like, other people, like, everyone has a motive. If you're, it's kind of surprising in many ways because, like blockchain, we, we think that we understand incentives, and then you come out with something like this and it's like, okay, well, the reality is that I think the operating assumption, if you go as back as a white paper bitcoin, is like, people lack in their self best interest. That should always be the operating assumption. That's the reality of things. And, you know, it's hard to understand, like, or even like, taking opinion of, like, the ulterior or the deep motives of why people like tech.
01:01:53.472 - 01:02:46.960, Speaker A: It's like that idea of like, oh, people are just here because they want to make money and is that a bad thing? It's going to drive adoption. It's going to fund projects. I don't see a problem with that. Markets, like, there was a time where I was really interested in politics, but then I came to the conclusion that the real impact happens in, you just got to be pro market because the market is far more efficient to allocate resources and to coordinate, and you just have to be pro market and as governant light as possible, because governments are just not very good coordination to coordinate and delegate resources. They're there to, like, provide security. Tragedy of the commons, protect parks, taxation mostly provide security. But when you have, like, failed states or you have, like, places where, like, what happened in California in two years, three years that I was living there, it just went from being this ideal, best place in the world to like, holy shit, I need to get out of here.
01:02:47.700 - 01:02:48.372, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:02:48.516 - 01:03:03.400, Speaker A: Musk is now endorsing Trump, which is a big impact, is now moving the headquarters of both X and SpaceX away from California to Texas, I believe.
01:03:03.840 - 01:03:04.520, Speaker B: Mm hmm.
01:03:04.600 - 01:03:18.820, Speaker A: And that all just happened last week. Domino's are falling. Why? Because I believe that there was a new law that was enacted in California that, like, they could take some of the effective, like, they could take your kids away for some of this transgender stuff.
01:03:19.440 - 01:03:35.072, Speaker B: But, like, it was that, I think if a kid comes to the school and says, I want to convert or something like that, then there's a now a law that just got signed in or is about to get signed in that says the school doesnt have to tell the parent or cant tell the parent or something like that.
01:03:35.096 - 01:04:05.900, Speaker A: Something like that, yeah, yeah. So when you do that, if youre a politician, putting aside whether thats right or wrong, think about the tax revenue that all of a sudden California lost and has been losing for the last couple of years, and other states, like, and everybodys moving to Miami. Like, Ken Griffin moved from Chicago to Miami. Kevin Griffin was like, single digit percentage of tax revenue for the state. Now he's buying $45 million. Dinosaurs. Kudos to him.
01:04:05.900 - 01:04:32.590, Speaker A: But you know what I mean? That's a practical reality of things, where if you have these policies, that's what I'm thinking. Say you're pro crypto. That's going to bring more tax revenue because it's going to ensure that businesses like Coinbase that have created so much employment continue to be built in America. And I think that is the most important thing, particularly at a time where the budget is like, you know, not particularly sound.
01:04:33.690 - 01:04:34.470, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:04:34.810 - 01:04:59.350, Speaker A: So, anyways, that's a little bit of a rant, but I think. I think it's just we ought to be practical and, you know. Yeah. Like, if you disagree with things, I totally get it. I'm not. But I go back to this idea, like, political dynamics can, to start, have become extreme, right? You need to put one name on the ballot and that you can't choose 50% Trump and 50%. I mean, it's no politics.
01:04:59.350 - 01:05:03.350, Speaker A: You need to make such that unfortunate trade off that you always have had to make.
01:05:03.470 - 01:05:07.930, Speaker B: Yeah. Good pod, sir.
01:05:08.430 - 01:05:09.690, Speaker A: Yeah. Anything else?
01:05:11.110 - 01:05:21.386, Speaker B: No. Block works is hiring. We got some open roles. So if people like the pod, you should come work at blockworks, come work with Santa. We actually have a head of pod. We have a head of podcast ops role.
01:05:21.498 - 01:05:24.154, Speaker A: Oh, really? Oh, yeah. I saw that in your update, by the way.
01:05:24.202 - 01:05:47.260, Speaker B: Yeah. Director of podcast operations. So here are the open worlds. We have a director of podcasts, someone to basically run the p and L of the podcast network and run all the operations. We have a podcast host role for the Lightspeed podcast. We have three engineering roles, open senior backend engineer, senior data engineer, and then another senior backend engineer for more data products. We have an event operations role.
01:05:47.260 - 01:06:02.200, Speaker B: We have a senior research data analyst, and then actually a director of sales role. So someone to lead the media and ad sales team, which is a nine person team, seven sellers, and two account managers today.
01:06:02.580 - 01:06:12.208, Speaker A: Nice. So we tweeted about what other people wanted to listen. I'm just going through the list. I think we covered a lot of it. Meme coins. We covered defi narrative to some extent and why that could go up.
01:06:12.264 - 01:06:47.116, Speaker B: Oh, I have a thing, Santi. So one thing Santi and I have been talking about that I'd love the listeners take on is we both want to cover more companies that are doing interesting things. That haven't been seen before in crypto, because it really does feel like there's this kind of big infrastructure fatigue and just infra exhaustion. And what can crypto really do? So a company like that would be, uh. So we were talking about having Skytrade on. So Santi and I both invested in this air rights company called Skytrade. But they're pre seed, right? Like, so they're pre seed company and they're.
01:06:47.116 - 01:07:22.618, Speaker B: And they're basically creating the. There's an air, like, the air rights marketplace bringing it on chain. So my pro for doing that episode on Empire is, I think it's a really, really, really interesting use case that literally nobody's talking about. Also, I think that, like, just air rights in general crypto side are very interesting, and not many people know about them. The counter is, you bring on that guest, it's like, wait, this is some pre seed company that Jason and Santi just invested in. So I think I'd like to bring on some of those guests. But if people think like, hey, I don't want to listen to these people, I'd love for you guys to dm us or post on Twitter and tag us and let us know if you want to see more of those or.
01:07:22.634 - 01:08:00.914, Speaker A: Less of those, yeah, that'd be great. I mean, historically, we've done some of that. We've tried to skew more to more repeat guests that people tend to enjoy talking about what's kind of most interesting to most people. But it would be useful. The way I've initially, when you and I talked about empire and what direction we wanted to take is there is some element of getting ahead of narratives, bringing on people that are going to talk about things that they're building that proves that crypto is meaningful, that it touches real world and impact, can impact your life more. So telling you things that you haven't seen yet, they're going to become important in six months or in a year. And I think we've done that to some extent.
01:08:00.914 - 01:08:12.110, Speaker A: Of course, we can't cover it all, but, yeah, I tend to think it's super interesting. Something like Skytree is a perfect example, by the way. I can't tell you how many, how many people reach out like, wow, this sounds super.
01:08:13.250 - 01:08:14.314, Speaker B: More people than I ever.
01:08:14.362 - 01:08:19.026, Speaker A: It has been. It has been the company that I've gotten the most amount of imbalance from funds being like, can I get an intro?
01:08:19.058 - 01:08:19.706, Speaker B: Because, same with.
01:08:19.738 - 01:08:20.362, Speaker A: Super interesting.
01:08:20.426 - 01:08:25.562, Speaker B: Same with me. Jonathan was like, oh, my God, a lot of investor intros. I was like, I've never had maybe.
01:08:25.586 - 01:08:27.370, Speaker A: Like, five investor intros to Jonathan.
01:08:27.410 - 01:08:43.390, Speaker B: Yeah, I made one last night, and they said, santi already made this one. So I said, all right, fine. We got huge breaking news to wrap this podcast, which is Trump to announce a USA bitcoin strategic reserve in Nashville.
01:08:45.730 - 01:08:46.470, Speaker A: Really?
01:08:46.930 - 01:08:58.240, Speaker B: No, I'll show you this. I mean, this is from this random guy named Dennis Porter. Huge breaking. Trump announced sources. Sauces.
01:08:58.400 - 01:09:00.944, Speaker A: He should have capitalized sources p. This.
01:09:00.952 - 01:09:03.180, Speaker B: Is not a joke. My sources are credible.
01:09:05.400 - 01:09:11.816, Speaker A: Yeah, it's like that Paul Graham post. Like, some very high people I know cautioned you to hold bitcoin.
01:09:11.928 - 01:09:39.890, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, no, so I actually could see. So I know. So David Bailey. So David Bailey is Trump's main bitcoin advisor, and David Bailey runs Bitcoin magazine, which is how they got Trump as a keynote speaker for the Bitcoin conference. I actually could see Trump saying that they're doing a bitcoin reserve, but then. Which would be, obviously, ridiculously bullish. I don't think they'd probably follow through on it, but I would say non zero chance that he actually says that.
01:09:41.350 - 01:10:05.026, Speaker A: Always thinking probabilities. There's a lot of things that I didn't have in my bingo cardinal, truly. Just to round out the discussion, Howard Marks, which I love, him, and Sandra Camiller, probably my favorite two investors, and Soros. He came out with a good post today, or yesterday, and I listened to it today. Very nice. People should go read it super shorter. Nice.
01:10:05.098 - 01:10:14.732, Speaker B: Yeah, nice. The thing we didn't talk on, talk about Eth. ETF comes next week, so, like, three days we'll have ethnic.
01:10:14.746 - 01:10:24.700, Speaker A: Yeah. Just as a parting thought, ladies, who would have thought that this would just be a brushed over comment at the end of the pod of the eth is coming.
01:10:25.480 - 01:10:26.528, Speaker B: So just.
01:10:26.664 - 01:10:38.080, Speaker A: Just a side note. Footnote. Hope everyone's listening from some beach running, getting some exercise in some sun, and, yeah, enjoying.
01:10:38.200 - 01:10:51.810, Speaker B: To the listener who said, can you stop sipping or drinking chewing ice? Like, what the fuck? You don't know how annoying it is to listeners. I will let you know. I did not chew a single piece of ice and only took three sips of my coffee today. So you are. You are welcome. You are welcome.
01:10:53.110 - 01:11:05.110, Speaker A: Yeah, seriously. I also saw that I'm like, I'm here to serve you no ice. Sorry for the slurping. Anyways, thanks, everyone, for listening. We'll see you next week.
01:11:05.190 - 01:11:06.550, Speaker B: See you next week. Cheers.
01:11:06.710 - 01:11:07.450, Speaker A: Cheers.
