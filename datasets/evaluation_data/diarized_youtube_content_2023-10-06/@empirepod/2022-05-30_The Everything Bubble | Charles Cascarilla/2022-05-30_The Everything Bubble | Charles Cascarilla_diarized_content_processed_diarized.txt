00:00:00.360 - 00:00:08.034, Speaker A: This episode is brought to you by Paraswap, the leading aggregator to find best prices across various Dexs. You'll hear more about them later in the show.
00:00:08.734 - 00:00:10.270, Speaker B: All right, everyone, we're going one on.
00:00:10.302 - 00:00:38.762, Speaker A: One with Charles Cascarilla, the CEO and co founder of Paxos. Charles, hopefully I pronounced your last name right. Paxos is one of the most important companies in crypto that has just been quietly building for the last several years and is actually the backbone of a lot of different products, products maybe that aren't as forward facing, but kind of sit behind a lot of other products in crypto. So we're going to talk markets. We're going to talk stable coins. We're going to talk about what Paxos is doing. But before all that, Charles, welcome to the show, my friend.
00:00:38.898 - 00:00:51.250, Speaker B: Great to be on. I definitely agree with you. We've spent a lot of time building in the background here, and it's really starting to pay off. A lot of people are coming into the ecosystem and we're helping to power them, which is exciting for us and I think for everybody.
00:00:51.322 - 00:01:20.176, Speaker A: Yeah, awesome, man. All right, so here's what I want to get into first is actually just the markets. I remember this March of 2020 interview you did. I think it was March, maybe February, maybe April, with Patrick O'Shaughnessy on invest like the best. And you kind of laid out the macro landscape, and you said the most likely route that was going to be taken by the Fed is that they just couldn't stop printing, is how you put it. And helicopter money would become really, really difficult to control and rein in. And sure enough, you're right, and the market completely ripped.
00:01:20.176 - 00:01:51.404, Speaker A: And now actually, two years later, where we're sitting at is things aren't all fun and games anymore, right? The market kind of peaked out. It was peak kind of just narrative and excitement. And what ended up happening is that inflation print ended up coming in above 8% and it kept coming in above 8%. The Fed started kind of spooking the markets, said they're going to hike interest rates. And now what's happened is things have colossally turned around. Nasdaq's down like 30%, s and p down like 15, 20%. Global debt to GDP is sitting at like 350%.
00:01:51.404 - 00:02:02.324, Speaker A: Snapchat just fell 40% in one day. Inflation still like 8%. So I just wanted to ask you, how the hell did we get here? What has happened over the last couple of years in your mind?
00:02:02.664 - 00:02:50.632, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I wish it was only the last two years that got us here, it would be a lot easier to solve. But really, this kind of goes all the way back to 1998 and the asian financial crisis, believe it or not, because we had, or even maybe 1995, you had this big tech boom that first started and productivity was going up, and we cut interest rates and we kept cutting interest rates into y two k through the asian crisis, and you blew a giant bubble and it popped. And to solve that bubble, we cut interest rates to zero. And then we blew a subprime and housing bubble, and then that blew up. And each time, instead of basically taking the medicine, so to speak, of, let's clear the Dex, we cut interest rates and incentivize debt growth. And so really, since 1995, I think there's only been one or two years where debt has not grown faster than the economy. That is obviously an unsustainable pattern.
00:02:50.632 - 00:03:45.074, Speaker B: You can't have debt grow faster in the economy forever. And it forced us to keep cutting interest rates to incentivize more debt. Because if you think about what debt is, debt is something you consume today and you're going to pay back tomorrow, and you keep incentivizing that and you get to a point where you really have societal wide problems. And I think now we probably have told ourselves the biggest lies, lies almost in the history of the world, at least from a financial perspective. The idea that we're going to be able to pay back whatever the number is now must be $300 trillion or something, a little less of global debt, 350% debt to GDP or something in that range. And all the major economies, the idea that we're going to be able to pay our 60 trillion of unfunded liabilities on Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, when you add all that up, it's completely impossible. So we're just lying to ourselves.
00:03:45.074 - 00:04:42.463, Speaker B: And the way we've avoided having to come to terms with that lie is by having interest rates keep going lower and lower and then eventually keep printing money. And the pandemic was a situation where it allowed us to print a lot of money and have big budget deficits because we all wanted to get through the pandemic together, but it was actually just continuing to cover up this fundamental imbalance. And it's just this pattern of, now what do you do? Because at least before you didn't have inflation, so you cut interest rates and you were printing money. There was no inflation, so there wasn't a hard trade off. And inflation is in some sense the reckoning moment for what is happening. And it really becomes unclear here. We haven't had a situation like this in a very long time, or maybe really ever in some sense, with the size of these unfunded liabilities and debts.
00:04:42.463 - 00:05:18.368, Speaker B: So I wish we had, like a great answer to it. I have always believed that crypto and blockchain would, was the way out of this situation for us, because you're going to need a new financial system. A new financial system that would be able to keep up with the new economy and operate at the speed of the Internet. So that's one reason you need a new financial system. But the second reason you need a new financial system is because the contradictions within the old financial system have become so unbalanced that they're not going to be able to hold. And we don't know exactly how that will unfold. There's a couple scenarios that are possible.
00:05:18.368 - 00:05:58.968, Speaker B: So you have 8.5% inflation right now. Maybe that's just a couple of supply shocks and some just a point in time inflation problem. That's a possibility. In which case what'll happen is the federal hike rates to, I don't know, maybe 2%, or supposedly the market says 3%, and that will slow things down and inflation will come down and the economy will keep growing, and you come back into some kind of goldilocks. That would be the hopeful scenario that's possible. Maybe we'll be able to continue on and that would be great.
00:05:58.968 - 00:07:03.554, Speaker B: The other possibility is that the Fed continues to hike, and asset prices, which have already been coming down now, I guess we're almost at a bear market here, have been coming down, so maybe 20% off their highs in the stock market, private valuations are down more, and real estate maybe should start coming down. Well, then you could have us go into a recession, maybe a pretty deep recession, and then I think the Fed would cut interest rates to zero again and print money, and maybe inflation would come back again. We'll have some hard choices, or we kind of just decide to live with above average inflation for quite a period of time, and it just, we don't actually pull that under control. Those are the really the three scenarios. I don't know which one we really choose, but if you looked at asset prices, and this is pretty interesting, right now, asset prices to disposable income is at 850%. So countrywide for the entire United States, which in the average level is about 450%. So that tells you how much asset prices are above normal.
00:07:03.554 - 00:07:36.040, Speaker B: Now, you could look at ten or 20 different statistics, price to sales, price to earnings, price to book, house prices to income, everything is at epic levels, you're basically a 99th percentile in almost every asset class bonds. So you have a long way to fall in asset prices if the fed really kept hiking rates. And so you could really have some unusual situations that go on here. And that, of course, maybe even affect the crypto market and the blockchain market. But I don't think that's something. I think that's something we should all be aware of. You can't control these things, but you need to be prepared for them.
00:07:36.040 - 00:07:55.104, Speaker B: But there's also this concept of going through these very hard cycles in crypto. But it's all part of what is a very big secular shift that this type of possible discontinuity would actually accelerate. So that's kind of the paradox of the thing.
00:07:56.244 - 00:08:20.568, Speaker A: There are three periods I keep hearing this compared to one is in mid 1970s. So post world War two, you have this absolute boom for 30 years, 19, what, 73 to 75, you get the recession. That kind of was like, marked the end of the expansionary period post world War two. The other period is maybe the.com crash. Exuberance was at an all time high. You had these companies going public that didn't even really have a product, and it was just based on page view clicks and things like that.
00:08:20.568 - 00:08:27.872, Speaker A: And then there's obviously 2008, 2009. Do you think any of those three periods are a fair comparison to what we're seeing right now?
00:08:27.968 - 00:09:08.446, Speaker B: Well, Mark Twain saying history rhymes, it doesn't repeat itself. I think there's analogies to many of those. It might look a little bit more like the seventies, only because I think you're having a real regime change. And I'm not sure that 2000 or 2008 really fully represented a regime change. Each one was like a pretty big shift. But you have something very unusual going on, which is you don't just have a bubble in one asset class, you have almost an everything bubble, and you don't just have it, and you don't have these debt levels just in the US, you have them globally. And so you're really at a very precarious place because of that.
00:09:08.446 - 00:09:52.280, Speaker B: But it doesn't necessarily mean that we can't kick the can for another ten years. It's always surprising how far things can keep going, but it's like a rubber band, and you could pull it maybe longer than you think. Eventually it's going to snap. Is this the time when it's going to snap? It might. And if it does, I think it would represent something that's much more difficult than any one of those prior times, because you have misallocated capital on a scale of the economy far larger than any of those times as a percentage of GDP or however you want to look at it. And you're also doing it in a synchronous way outside the US as well. It's not like China or Japan or Australia or Europe or Canada look better, they actually look worse.
00:09:52.280 - 00:10:05.000, Speaker B: So it's not like, oh, well, it's just the US problem, to be honest with you. Not at all. I think the US is in a fundamentally better position than most of these countries. Of course. It just depends on the exact metric you want to use.
00:10:05.152 - 00:10:29.824, Speaker A: Yeah. How do you think about investing in this period? Right, because for the last two years, since March of 2020, since you had that podcast on invest like the best, anything you touched turned to gold. Trading cards, rare cars, crypto equities, right. It was kind of like the farther you pushed out on the risk spectrum, the better you did. Now the farthest out on the risk spectrum is getting absolutely hammered. Right. But for me at least, it feels like there's nowhere really to turn.
00:10:29.824 - 00:10:33.890, Speaker A: There's no good place in the market. How do you think about investing?
00:10:33.972 - 00:10:54.870, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it's a difficult environment because when you have an everything bubble, that means, you know, really what you're talking about is relative choices between what is going to go up and what's going to go down. And also, you know, to the extent that you now have interest rates up, you know, people can go to cash. Cash isn't trash at the moment. Cash is yielding you 75 basis points risk free.
00:10:54.902 - 00:10:59.286, Speaker A: And it's funny that in inflationary period, cash is actually maybe the best thing to be holding.
00:10:59.390 - 00:11:53.674, Speaker B: Well, because, you know, it's, you know, I know, isn't that weird? Like, you got eight and a half percent interest, sorry, inflation, and you're only earning 75 basis points of interest. But if everything goes down ten or 20%, then your positive 75 basis points is better because it's all about relative prices right now. And so if you thought you're in a period where prices of most assets will go down on an absolute basis, and certainly on even a relative basis, it's just going to be which one is going to go down the least? And in that case, cash will go down the least. But there are certain assets. Like if you looked at gold as an example, it really hasn't moved all that much. And so you could say, oh, maybe that's a place to hide out. You could even make an argument that, oh, well, you should go own the long bond, because if asset prices are going to go down, the Fed will, the economy will go down, and the Fed's going to have to cut rates and bonds will rally.
00:11:53.674 - 00:12:18.774, Speaker B: So you could maybe go find some certain things to go put yourself in. But I think right now, the benefit is optionality. So we don't know what the world's gonna be. So what do you do? You try to stay closer to home. Closer to home is being able to have the ability to take advantage of dislocations. And what can dislocations look like? It can look like asset price falls at different places. So what does that mean? I mean, it means sell some winners.
00:12:18.774 - 00:12:42.848, Speaker B: It means hold some cash. It means potentially hold some bonds, but hold things that are liquid so that you can also reallocate as things move around. So basically, try to have optionality, which means staying liquid and having dry powder. That's the best advice I would give. Now for every single person, that's just going to be different depending on where they're at in their life and what their risk tolerance is.
00:12:42.976 - 00:13:20.616, Speaker A: Right? Right. How do you view bitcoin right now? Because bitcoin's gone through this changing narrative every couple of years in crypto or in bitcoin or whatever you want to say. There's a new narrative, right? It used to be digital payments, and then it was digital gold, and then it was this inflation hedged asset. And then you started having corporates and nation states putting bitcoin on their balance sheet. Right? There's always, every 18 to 24 months, there's this new bitcoin narrative, and it feels like a lot of those narratives might have fizzled out, at least in the short term, right now. So what is your just view on how you're seeing bitcoin? I think both the asset, but bitcoin the network, how do you view both of those today?
00:13:20.720 - 00:14:15.094, Speaker B: Well, I mean, I think there's. I think that is a very insightful point. I think that there could be a couple narratives that could emerge here. One is bitcoin as a reserve asset. So I know there's bitcoin as, say, digital gold or something, but bitcoin is a reserve asset which would underpin the financial system as the kind of settlement that is not controlled by anybody, any sovereign. And the possibility that is starting to happen because you've now seen the dollar be more and more used as a financial weapon. And I think all for good reasons in many cases, but the benefit of having the reserve currency, but also the requirement is that everyone should be able to use it.
00:14:15.094 - 00:14:59.314, Speaker B: And if everyone can't use it, then it's not the reserve currency anymore. And so to the extent that people become afraid that you can't use the dollar, as at any time, that means they're afraid that you're going to be defaulted, basically. Like, if you take somebody's money, that's the default, that they can't have a claim on you. And so that is going to force people to think about other ways to be able to transact. I'm not saying that's good or bad. It's just, I think, a reality. So I think this concept that bitcoin is a reserve asset could gain steam as an unfortunate byproduct of the war in Ukraine, and a lot of the different ways we've exerted pressure using our currency.
00:15:00.894 - 00:15:18.092, Speaker A: Just so I make sure I understand that thesis is that bitcoin as a reserve. So something like petrodollars, something like settling, like nation states settling debts with each other, those debts would get. Are we talking at the nation state level, like, those debts would get settled in bitcoin. Are we talking about people sending money between each other?
00:15:18.148 - 00:15:18.484, Speaker B: Like, what.
00:15:18.524 - 00:15:21.116, Speaker A: What does the settlement layer of the world really mean?
00:15:21.260 - 00:16:00.974, Speaker B: Well, I think that that's definitely what I was talking about here, is that it could be a reserve asset, you know, kind of like IMF drawing rights in some sense. Right. It'd be an ability for nation states to use a non sovereign, universally accepted settlement mechanism. I don't know if that'll happen, but I think that there's. I could see that now coming into focus, whereas maybe before that seemed a little far fetched or far out. I don't think bitcoin's ready for that yet, but that would be one example of a narrative that could begin to emerge. There's another narrative that I think is really starting to gain steam, in the case of bitcoin, at least, is around the L2 access to it.
00:16:00.974 - 00:17:09.362, Speaker B: Lightning labs. A lot of the lightning network layers that have been put into place is creating an ability for bitcoin to be used as a payment mechanism and potentially some of the smart contracting layers, whether it's stacks or others, where you could now be able to even have smart contracting anchored into bitcoin. I think that is a much different narrative than has existed in the past. The reason I think that's very powerful is there is so much uncertainty with the other payment mechanisms, either l one s or l two s, that have been put into place, and either because they're continuing to get clogged up or the technology isn't quite ready yet. And I'm not sure it is necessarily in bitcoin either. In fact, I know it's not, but it could be. But I think those are really powerful stories, because I think there's an elegance to the bitcoin as a layer, one that is very secure, widely used settlement layer, and that you're anchoring that into your financial system that is used for payments and it's used for smart contracting.
00:17:09.362 - 00:17:37.080, Speaker B: Is it there yet? No, but the other ones aren't there yet either. And there's actually a lot of flaws in all of them. And I think that could be the most likely way to go. If you look at an analogy of the current financial system, you it have an l one, which would be, say, the Federal Reserve. You have l two s, which is visa, Mastercard, Ach. L three s are some of the banks. L four s could be exchanges, or however you wanna exactly denote each one of those levels.
00:17:37.080 - 00:18:11.468, Speaker B: But that'd be more or less like bitcoin being an l one, lightning, or maybe some other companies could be l two s. You can then add an l three s and l four s. And it's built on top of what I think is a thermodynamically sound mechanism to be able and a, I think, most widely accepted asset in the world, which is bitcoin. So I could see that also emerging as a narrative. Again, we're not there yet, but so if those are the two narratives that I think could start to come to play in the bitcoin world, certainly over the next twelve to 18 months.
00:18:11.596 - 00:18:46.570, Speaker A: Yeah, it does feel like defi on. Bitcoin is one of the most contrarian investments you could make as a crypto investor. But something that could play out, I think a lot of it depends on how deep into the bear we go, which I think, which maybe is. I turn that into a question for you. Bitcoin, since 2009, since this entire industry was created, has only operated in a global macro bull market. I'd call it, how does bitcoin, and just actually zooming out the entire crypto industry, how do we do in a maybe global macro bear market here?
00:18:46.682 - 00:20:28.114, Speaker B: Well, it's interesting to think about that for a couple of reasons. Well, the first is, I do agree with you, it's very contrarian to imagine that you can end up with a smart contracting layer on bitcoin, partly because it doesn't really exist at the moment, but people are working on it or doesn't exist in a way that has scaled. On the other hand, I think there are fundamental contradictions in all of these systems that have been brought to bear. And I also think that those contradictions, in part, are going to face regulatory issues. And so I think that's an interesting aspect here that we still haven't come to bear with, is that there could be regulatory reasons why this is not effective. Could most institutions today decide to use something aside from bitcoin as a smart contracting layer to move assets around, I wonder, because of the lack of regulatory clarity or potential regulatory issues around being a security in some of these l one s, let's just set all that aside for a second as one reason why bitcoin creates a lot of, let's call it surety from a regulatory standpoint, even though it might not have it necessarily at the moment, from a technology standpoint, on a relative basis, though, nobody really does. And then I think you could look at this bear market that we have started to enter, and we'll see how long it lasts for these crypto winners tend to be pretty deep.
00:20:28.114 - 00:21:31.232, Speaker B: They've generally been down 80% to 90%, and that's on bitcoin ends up being worse for everything else. So you could imagine, I don't know if that's what'll happen here, because we've gotten to such a level of maturity and adoption. That might not be how far down it goes this time, but again, nobody really knows the answer to that. But non bitcoin related activity goes down more, and that tends to be because they're smaller communities, they tend to be more speculative. I think that means that there is just less resilience about how those communities act when they go down. A lot of what's gone on in these different areas has been around building community. But sometimes that community, and I'd say maybe in many cases, that community has been driven by price appreciation, right? Like, hey, we're all like, is everyone's at the craps table together, and there's nothing more fun than you're at the craps table and everybody's winning because you're all winning together.
00:21:31.232 - 00:22:14.684, Speaker B: It's not like blackjack, where you go to the blackjack table and one person wins, the next person loses. Like, it's just kind of like a singular sport. But this has kind of been like a large example of everyone being at the craps table together. Now, that is doing a disservice to a lot of the fundamental community and innovation that's been built in many places. But there is certainly elements of that, and we've seen some examples of that in the last couple weeks, even. And with the terra and USDA, unfortunately. And so I think that it's hard to tell what will happen in this bear market, who will end up not being able to make it, where you have to prove your business through a business cycle.
00:22:14.684 - 00:22:39.666, Speaker B: That's the whole point. Like, it's not a business model if it only works when assets go up and prices go up. The whole point is a business model works through the cycle and has to add value to the cycle. If you can't work in the downside, that's not working. That's just pretending, really, because there's going to be bad case scenarios. There's going to be tough times. There always are.
00:22:39.666 - 00:23:32.898, Speaker B: You can't live like there isn't, even though we've gone long periods of time now without having to have that happen on a broader basis, at least. And I also think that the fundamentals of what crypto and blockchain represent are not going to be invalidated by a bear market. My suspicion is that bear market will actually be validation even more. It will be a winnowing process of bad ideas and business models that don't work. But it's not because the entire concept doesn't work, it's just that some don't. But fundamentally, the shift of the entire financial system needing to change because the current one isn't working, doesn't fit with where the new economy is going, doesn't fit with an Internet based economy. You know, basically the financial system right now moves at the speed of the post office.
00:23:32.898 - 00:23:53.478, Speaker B: It's two day settlement. Maybe it's five days, maybe it's one day, but that's what it is. Why is that the case when all you're moving is electronic information around? More or less, and I could tell you lots of reasons why, but it doesn't make any sense. And so that that is the fundamental problem. And guess what? That isn't going to get solved by anything except for crypto and blockchain.
00:23:53.566 - 00:24:19.358, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I hear you a lot and clear. I do want to talk about that. And I also want to talk about the second order implications of what happens when settlement is more in real time. But one thing before we get into that is let me lay out two scenarios to you, and I want to see which one you think is more likely. Scenario a is we go into this long, prolonged bear market, it feels like 2018, 2019. Maybe it's even worse. The reason being global macro is just in the shitter.
00:24:19.358 - 00:24:39.734, Speaker A: And like everything is falling apart around us. The other option is the bear market's actually not that bad. Reason being a, there's a massive amount of permanent capital in the industry with on the venture side of things. Right. Andreessen just raised a four and a half billion dollar fund for. All right. I think there's $32 billion of crypto vc raised last year.
00:24:39.734 - 00:25:04.874, Speaker A: So there's a massive amount of permanent capital sitting on the sidelines. And there's also, unlike 2017, there are buyers of last resort. Right? There are buyers of. When some of these prices go down, whether it's coinbase in the public markets or Aave or uniswap, some of these tier one Defi protocols are down a lot. Right. There is a buyer in the public markets for them. Unlike in 2017, which one seems more likely to you?
00:25:05.034 - 00:25:45.792, Speaker B: My guess is it's the latter, but. And because I do think that the fundamentals here, the fundamental secular trend, is much more clear and is so positive. So you're just, you continue to compound, basically, is another way to think about it. So say the world goes down -80 or 90%, but you're continuing to grow 20% a year through that. You might go down, too, but you're just not going to be able to go down as much because that compounding is going to overwhelm whatever the decline is. So that's what my assumption is. But it's always hard to tell what the second order and third order are effects will be as you start to get more price declines, because there's leverage in the system.
00:25:45.792 - 00:26:37.244, Speaker B: There are business models that are built on transaction volumes. There's been a lot of over expansion, and so you just can't always tell how it's going to happen. The Warren Buffett saying you can't tell who's naked until the tide goes out, is always going to be true because you get second order and third order effects. And so, for instance, Luna and Terra go down, and that's $40 billion or so that's lost to outside people from the side, from the Luna foundation. So $40 billion is lost. Is that going to create second order and third order effects? That we don't know. Could there be some lending firms that maybe fail? Could there be some trading firms that are overlevered? Maybe? Would that force more liquidations and that would kind of expose more over leveraged business models or inappropriately capitalized business models? Sure, but my.
00:26:37.244 - 00:27:12.130, Speaker B: And certainly if you have just a total decline across all the rest of the economy, that could happen, too. So you always gotta be careful that you don't know when you're in the tail and you're describing a tail event when you're in the tail, a small move in the tail is a large move on the axis, and that's why they're so impossible to. And you don't have a lot of data points, so they're very hard to model. And, you know, they really can create some unusual side effects that you just can't fully understand right now. So you need to be. That's what I was getting into before, which is you got to have optionality. You got to plan for this.
00:27:12.130 - 00:27:41.306, Speaker B: You can see venture funds from Sequoia to y combinator to others putting out a lot of warnings to all their companies saying, look, life's going to go on, but life goes on for those who are prepared for life to go on. You can't just assume it's going to continue to stay the way it was. You know, things change, and you got to react to it. And so, you know, you need to be prepared for a long bear market, but, you know, it doesn't mean that it's what's going to happen.
00:27:41.410 - 00:28:06.770, Speaker A: Yeah. All right, everyone, quick break from the show to share a big update from our friends at Pariswap. The best platform to stake, swap, trade, farm, and more. Paraswap just launched. Gas refunds. Based on how much you stake, you can now get up to 100% of your gas refunded on all of your swaps on Paraswap. This is huge, huge for anyone who has spent a lot of time in Defi.
00:28:06.770 - 00:28:30.410, Speaker A: Or maybe it's just starting out. You know how egregiously expensive the gas transactions can get. The gas fees are ridiculous at some points in time, and now you can get those entirely refunded on Paraswap. To participate, all you need to do is stake a minimum of 500 psp. Big shout out to the paraswap dow for making these refunds possible. Really, it's just. It's tough to be Paraswap right now.
00:28:30.410 - 00:28:48.126, Speaker A: They give you the best prices. They save you money. You've got this gas refund if you stake PSP. They've got a smooth and really user friendly interface. Fast swapping. It's really everything that you'd want from a defi platform if you don't use them already. Check out Paraswap today at paraswap IO.
00:28:48.126 - 00:29:40.966, Speaker A: Now let's get back to the show. Let's talk stablecoins for a second. Because you mentioned Terra, I don't actually want to get into Terra and USD, because I feel like it's actually kind of overplayed at this point. But I do want to get your take on something that Jim Bianco said on the podcast maybe a couple of months ago, which is at a certain point the Fed steps in for stablecoins, or somebody steps in and they don't let this get too big, right? And I think his number, if I remember correctly, was something around 1 trillion, maybe we're at around 100 billion today. So maybe the Fed, or, I don't know, whoever it is, the government, the regulators, could let stable coins grow by another ten x and then really step in. And because of that, his thesis was that you actually need decentralized tokens or decentralized stablecoins to further grow defi. Now, he made that thesis before everything played out with USD and Terra.
00:29:40.966 - 00:29:58.580, Speaker A: But I just want to get your take on that statement. But also just where you see the stablecoin space and cbdcs and centralized stablecoins and you guys have a stable coin and decentralized stable coins. How do you view the landscape now that you've had a couple weeks to maybe reflect on what just happened with the algo stablecoins?
00:29:58.692 - 00:30:31.324, Speaker B: Yeah, so we have $20 billion of stablecoins, a little bit less between our USDP token and BUSD token, both of which we run, and they're regulated tokens. And I'll describe our tokens in a moment. I do think that it's important to define stable coins, because there's so many different ways of creating stable coins. They're not all the same thing. So really, to me, a stable coin is, you took an asset and you tokenized it. It used to be on a central bank database, and now you put it into a decentralized database. It's still the asset.
00:30:31.324 - 00:31:14.486, Speaker B: So is that asset a gold bar? Is that asset an equity? Is that asset a 30 year bond? Is that asset a t bill? Or is it commercial paper? Whatever it is, it's still basically that asset. That's what you've tokenized. Of course, you can do things differently and still call it a stable coin. And I think that's what's happened a lot. So in the case of tether, for instance, they are a bank, right? They have not just t bills, they have long bonds, they have gold, they have loans, they have commercial paper, they have deposits of all kinds. So they're not just totaling t bills. They didn't just tokenize a T bill, they've tokenized a liability of tether, and they hold a bunch of assets that fluctuate in value.
00:31:14.486 - 00:31:33.524, Speaker B: But they said it's always be worth a dollar. That's called a bank. I think that's like, that's a fine business model. Whether it should be unregulated is a different issue, but it's still, essentially, they've tokenized the dollar. Of course, you could also tokenize a 30 year bond and say it's worth $1. A 30 year bond fluctuates in price. It's not always worth $1.
00:31:33.524 - 00:31:53.792, Speaker B: And you have interest rate risk, credit risk, and liquidity risk you may have. In this case, it's a public liability. It's a public liability that fluctuates in price. What Paxos has done is we only tokenize t bills. I think our average maturity is less than 30 days at the moment. So that never fluctuates in price. It's always worth a dollar.
00:31:53.792 - 00:32:18.464, Speaker B: It's like a dollar in your pocket is like a dollar that Paxos is tokenized. And that's really important. We are trying to create a digital dollar, not a digital representation of a dollar or, you know, whatever, you know, some version of it that isn't it. Right. We're not like, there's no liability against Paxos here. We have taken a T bill, we have tokenized it, and or FDIC insured bank deposits.
00:32:18.504 - 00:32:23.192, Speaker A: If I'm reading between the lines, you almost wouldn't call USDC or tether a stable coin.
00:32:23.328 - 00:32:31.088, Speaker B: That's right. Those are not. It's not. It's not a digital dollar. It's not a dollar in your pocket. You can tokenize many things. And by the way, that's what Terra did.
00:32:31.088 - 00:32:47.936, Speaker B: They tokenized their basically unbacked liabilities, right? I mean, that's what it was, you know, and they said it was worth a dollar. By the way, it's not a dollar. It's whatever. Worth whatever someone paid for. And so someone could say it's worth a dollar, they could say it's worth zero. And when they said it was worth zero, it was worth zero, right? Enough people say it worth zero. Zero.
00:32:47.936 - 00:33:15.456, Speaker B: Enough people say Paxos dollar is worth zero. They're wrong, because everyone will buy it up and come to Paxos, and we'll just sell the t bills and give you a dollar. And it's always worth a dollar. And what's more important is we have a primary regulator, the New York Department of Financial Services, and they oversee our token and what can be held in it. Plus they oversee the trust company to make sure. All the assets are held bankruptcy, remote, fully segregated Paxos fails, you have your dollar. And so I just, I don't think it's not meant to be a sexy business.
00:33:15.456 - 00:33:17.776, Speaker B: It's meant to be about financial innovation.
00:33:17.920 - 00:33:40.754, Speaker A: Yeah, but someone like USCC, to push, to try to defend them for a second like they do, they're mostly cash and cash equivalents. I think. They've got some Yankees, they've got some t, I think some treasuries in there, maybe like 5%. I don't actually know these numbers, so someone should actually cite me on this or fact check. But, like, they've got maybe 10%, like corporate bonds, commercial paper, whatever it may be. But they are mostly cash now.
00:33:40.874 - 00:33:58.854, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think it fluctuates around the idea. The point is, they don't have a prime, they don't have a primary regulator, so they can change the reserves as they. When they want. You know what I mean? Like any given month, any given day, they could say, tomorrow, I want to change the reserves. We can't, because we have a primary regulator that tells us this is all we can have, and they oversee it.
00:33:58.974 - 00:34:09.166, Speaker A: Is this a risk to the system? Because I know. So you guys have two of the biggest stable coins out there, but at the end of the day, USDT and USDC are the two largest. Is that a risk to the system?
00:34:09.310 - 00:34:29.666, Speaker B: It is a risk to the system, because you're accepting a dollar as a dollar, but it's not always guaranteed to be a dollar. In the case of Paxos, it will always be a dollar. And I don't think there's anything wrong with tokenizing other things. So I don't want to make that clear. It's just wrong if you say it's something that it's not.
00:34:29.770 - 00:34:30.234, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:34:30.314 - 00:35:09.814, Speaker B: Right. And so when you're not clear about it, when you say this is a dollar stable coin, but it is only backed by another token that also has no value, like Luna did you have a. That is not a stable coin. And so I understand this concept of trying to want to make it as decentralized as possible, but this is actually the story of banking for the last 200 plus years, which is you give a bank money, they give you give you a dollar back, they go put it in all kinds of different stuff. Right. And that's why you have a bank, and that's why you have regulatory rules and you have capital requirements, because, you know, plus the fiat nature of it. But with, you know, but if you only had, you know, $1 and you only invested it in USD bills, and that's all you ever did.
00:35:09.814 - 00:35:31.534, Speaker B: You're not taking any risk at all. All you've done is actually transform it in so that it can now be in a blockchain. And that's the exciting thing to me, is that you now have dollars on a blockchain. Isn't that enough? You have financial innovation, not financial instability, and you can now bring people into the financial system that you couldn't before, because anyone can hold a dollar with their wallet and it's a real dollar. That's what they want.
00:35:31.654 - 00:36:02.006, Speaker A: Yeah, you guys have this amazing white label business, Charles. So the stablecoin, like, finance works with you guys on the, like, stable coin as a service. I'm pretty sure. PayPal, I might be wrong here, but PayPal works with you guys on a lot of their, like, back end crypto. You guys have this like, crypto, um, uh, brokerage as a service, right. So if any fintech platform wants to enable crypto trading, they can go to Paxos and you guys will help them spin that up. Is the holy grail here for you guys? The US government? Us government wants to create a CVTC and Paxos powers.
00:36:02.006 - 00:36:03.306, Speaker A: That. Is that the holy Grail?
00:36:03.470 - 00:36:26.410, Speaker B: Well, first of all, we'd always work with the government to help them be able to bring innovation into the financial system as they thought was appropriate. But for us, that's not necessarily the Holy Grail. If I describe what we're trying to do, it's to replatform all the assets in the financial system. There's $700 trillion of them, or whatever the current market value is now.
00:36:26.442 - 00:36:30.482, Speaker A: Bonds, real estate, gold, everything and everything.
00:36:30.578 - 00:37:00.068, Speaker B: And why was it important to tokenize dollars? Because that's the. Frankly, that's the lifeblood of the entire financial system globally. And if you didn't have a dollar that could move on a blockchain, you can't have other assets move on a blockchain very effectively or at all. And that's what you see right now. I mean, essentially, aside from, I think, nfts trading against ETH, everything basically still trades against, really, dollars. And that's where all the liquidity is. So you need to have dollars done.
00:37:00.068 - 00:37:25.272, Speaker B: Kind of upgraded in this way, is a stable coin that we have today, or anyone else have today in the market capable of running an economy or kind of like a global financial system. Absolutely not. There is not enough privacy in it. There is zero privacy. There's only kind of anonymity. There's no way you could have that much information leakage between different businesses. Like they will be worried what their competitors could see and money movements and money flows.
00:37:25.272 - 00:38:05.058, Speaker B: So I think we're very far from having product market fit for an economy wide stablecoin, and it's going to take a lot of iterations over time. Certainly what we've done here is really interesting, but at whatever it is, 150 or $180 billion, it's basically nothing. There's $60 trillion of money of zero maturity, of just dollars. We're at just the very, very, very beginning of trying to understand this. And so I think that maybe eventually the Fed will want to issue. But my suspicion is that the amount of iteration that needs to happen between now and stabilization of product market fit at a society wide scale, we're very far from that.
00:38:05.186 - 00:38:30.044, Speaker A: Right? Do we ever get there, though? Because if you look at something like, who's a big company? Apple, right? Apple's never going to put their, is going to make their supply chain orders. They're not going to make those purchases on a public blockchain. So do we ever really use, do massive b, two b transactions ever really take place on a blockchain outside of financial services?
00:38:30.464 - 00:39:15.546, Speaker B: Well, certainly big wholesale movements of dollars might be the last thing to move onto a public blockchain, but that was really what I was trying to get at a little bit, that we don't have product market fit for how you run an economy wide stablecoin on a public chain because there's too much information leakage. From a privacy perspective, there are ways to really fix the privacy around. Like say, maybe using zero knowledge proofs or creating certain types of shards on certain chains. There's lots of interesting solutions, by the way. They're going to need to be tried out. And I think you'll get to a certain size and scale. And then the last ones that come on are always the biggest players because they have the most to lose and they have the most amount of volume to put through.
00:39:15.546 - 00:39:51.330, Speaker B: They are going to wait. You always want to start with these early adopter communities. That's the exciting thing about crypto, is this is like, it's an early adopter community. Even though it's this big, it's still very small in the scheme of the whole economy and the whole financial system. So could I imagine a day where all movements are going through a public blockchain? I expect that's what will happen. I would be surprised if now there's many different ways of doing that private public blockchain, including having privacy enhancing aspects to it. So I don't think the way it's done now on a public blockchain will ever involve apple moving money to their suppliers.
00:39:51.330 - 00:39:54.490, Speaker B: But that's a lot different from will they ever do it?
00:39:54.682 - 00:40:15.560, Speaker A: What happens? Okay, so $700 trillion of global assets, gold, stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities, real estate, art. What happens when all of that settles on a blockchain? And it sounds like this future, maybe for you, is 510 15. It's far out in the future, but what are the implications of that happening? What unlocks basically in the economy and in the markets?
00:40:15.672 - 00:41:05.174, Speaker B: Well, I think the interesting thing of kind of peering that far into the future is you don't have to use an imagination that is completely. I don't want to call it Sci-Fi because we've already seen it. It's called Defi. We've seen what the future looks like. The advantage of having an unregulated crypto ecosystem has been that the darwinian nature of ideas and money that are tied to instantaneous movement has been apparent. You've innovated so unbelievably fast now, we've also seen the downsides, like Terra, but you've seen the upsides, which is we're creating new financial products and new ways of doing things that no one even conceived of five years ago. Amazing.
00:41:05.174 - 00:42:12.036, Speaker B: And also, like, you know, there's also been a lot of over exuberance and things have gotten out of hand in certain places. But let's set that aside for a second. The fact is, could you imagine a world where you had every asset that's now moving on, a blockchain that you could have in your wallet that goes with you wherever you want, that you wouldn't be able to have global pools of liquidity for lending, for borrowing, for trading, for staking, for whatever it might be, for sending and receiving for payments, so that everyone can be in the financial system simply because they have the wallet on their phone? So you can basically, the cost of bringing someone to the financial system dramatically falls, the access to products dramatically increases. And it doesn't matter who you are or where you live, you have an asset, say you have a bitcoin, I don't know, you could pick anything. But you create a global market to be able to borrow against it, to lend against it, to do whatever against it. It doesn't matter who you are, it's just code. That is so many positive things about creating financial inclusion, about bringing unbanked, underbanked people, not just in the US, where it's 20 or 25% of adults are unbanked, underbanked.
00:42:12.036 - 00:42:47.988, Speaker B: But globally, maybe there's only a couple billion people who have bank accounts that look anything like what you would say that is in the US. I know the numbers are supposedly higher, but it's really not. It's unbelievable how hard it is for people to be able to get into the financial system and be able to be a participant in it. And the costs are very high. If you're not, it's a huge amount. You pay far more fees as a low income person than you do as someone who has higher balances. There's reasons for that, whatever weights of history, but that can all be shifted.
00:42:47.988 - 00:43:08.224, Speaker B: If everything was sitting in a blockchain, now, that's not a panacea. The blockchain is a tool. Crypto is a tool. It has to be used in the right way, used in the wrong way, you get Terra used in the right way and you can change access and inclusion and availability fundamentally.
00:43:08.384 - 00:43:36.520, Speaker A: Yeah, we've seen some of the best projects and use cases of crypto built in these bear markets. Right? 2013, you had Coinbase. 2015, you had ethanol. 2018, 2019, you had Defi. And NFTs really got created with Opensea and Uniswap and Aaven compound. What feels obvious to you right now, going into this bear market of things or projects or companies that will emerge out of this bear market? What are you excited about? What feels obvious to you that maybe doesn't feel obvious to other folks?
00:43:36.672 - 00:44:13.404, Speaker B: I think that it really is going to be around all the creator economy that's been brought in, into the crypto ecosystem, including from gaming to music to wherever it is. To me, that's actually the sign that this is really making an impact, because it's not just about speculative activities. It's around bringing the end user closer together with whoever is the kind of the issuer. And by the way, that could be a company, it could be a musician, it could be an artist. That's the whole point, is that you now are able to.
00:44:15.344 - 00:44:16.008, Speaker A: Remove a lot.
00:44:16.016 - 00:44:58.564, Speaker B: Of distribution agents that are in the middle. And the more you can show that, that is to me an indication that this is really living up to its promise, which is that you're going to end up having a fundamentally more open system that doesn't require intermediaries. You might use them, but doesn't require them. So if you look at bitcoin today, I think it's 60 or 65% of bitcoin is held in custodial wallets, believe it or not. Maybe that's up from ten or 15%, whatever it was five years ago, more or less. That's the interesting thing, is that people are choosing to use intermediaries. No one's required to because they have to compete in an open system, and they're producing great products that people want, and that's what you want.
00:44:58.564 - 00:45:11.976, Speaker B: You want open systems that can bring people closer together, and you can use an intermediary or not use one, depending on if they produce great products for you, but not because they have some embedded effect, network effect that locks you in like you have in Web 2.0 today.
00:45:12.120 - 00:45:27.564, Speaker A: Yeah, last question here. I have heard you say, I think it was from 2010 or 2011, maybe 2012, that you saw bitcoin as a call option, and that's really what it was in your mind, is there a similar, you know, ten years later, is there a similar call option in crypto today?
00:45:28.904 - 00:45:35.736, Speaker B: By the way, that was kind of the way I thought about it, because when you're at, like, you know, pennies or even just dollars, when was that?
00:45:35.880 - 00:45:36.864, Speaker A: 2011?
00:45:37.024 - 00:45:57.856, Speaker B: Yeah, it's 2010. May of 2010. When you started, like, really getting into it, April or may, it vary. It was $0.03. So, yeah, I mean, kind of a call option, because what's going to go to zero? So I don't know if there's anything that's quite structured like that. That was a truly very unusual situation. And I know people always look for.
00:45:57.856 - 00:46:00.214, Speaker B: What is that next, you know, $0.03 call option.
00:46:00.254 - 00:46:01.958, Speaker A: Everyone's chasing the next. Yeah, exactly.
00:46:02.006 - 00:46:52.438, Speaker B: Yeah, everyone's looking forward. And, you know, what I think is, is really the next call option is people taking advantage of this new ecosystem to build businesses, to, you know, really build the fundamentals that are gonna change things. You know, it's. It's very unusual to find assets that can go up, I don't know, whatever it is, 10,000 or 100,000 times, that's just, to me, like, that's always so hard to wrap your head around that that can exist out there and look for it, because generally the market is not providing those types of opportunities. But what you can do is know whatever you're passionate about. You now have an opportunity to turn that, think about it through a web3 perspective and go build that type of business. That's what I think is the most exciting thing that's coming out now is all these different businesses, all these different ways of bringing people together.
00:46:52.556 - 00:47:06.514, Speaker A: Yeah. Charles, this has been an absolute pleasure. I know you have a client call to jump on. I don't want to make you late, I would encourage folks to go check out paxos.com. I am pretty sure you're one of the only folks in crypto who does not have a twitter. Unless I just couldn't find it.
00:47:06.594 - 00:47:09.554, Speaker B: So I think it's very. It's well hidden.
00:47:09.674 - 00:47:15.554, Speaker A: Okay, good, good. Yeah. Nice and account anyways, my friend. Be well. This was great, and I will talk to you soon.
00:47:15.674 - 00:47:16.874, Speaker B: All right, thanks a lot. Great to be on.
