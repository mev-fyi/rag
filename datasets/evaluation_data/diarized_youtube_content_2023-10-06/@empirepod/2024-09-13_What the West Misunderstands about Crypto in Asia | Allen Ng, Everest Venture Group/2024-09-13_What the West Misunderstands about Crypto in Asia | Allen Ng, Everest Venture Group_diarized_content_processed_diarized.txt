All right everyone, welcome back to Empire. I'm taking this one solo. Santi is already in, I think he's in Korea today.
00:01:46.245 - 00:02:31.647, Speaker A: So we're recording this on September 12th. It's going to go live, I think on September 13th. On Friday, my vision for this episode, we're joined by Alan, who's quickly become a close friend after meeting him about a year ago. And he's taught me a lot about how crypto works in Asia and how to really do business in Asia. I would say something, two topics that I really didn't know much about before meeting, meeting Alan. So my vision for this episode is that you're on a flight, you're headed over to Token and Breakpoint and EVG's party and all that kind of good stuff. And I want you to listen to this to try to learn how, just I think the differences and like what, what it's like to do business in Asia and what the crypto scene really looks like in Asia because it is quite different from, from the States.
00:02:31.647 - 00:02:34.395, Speaker A: So Alan, man, welcome to Empire.
00:02:34.695 - 00:02:44.679, Speaker B: Thank you for having me, man. Yeah, you're, you're absolutely, you know, you flatter me, man. Like, I don't think I know everything about Asia, but I would love to share my experience.
00:02:44.807 - 00:03:15.675, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay, so we usually skip intros on Empire, but I think you might be a new name and a new face for a lot of people listening to this. So the way that I think about EVG is so. So Alan is the CEO and founder of Everest Ventures Group. A lot of people know it as evg, been around for a while in crypto. And the way that I think about it, which is a rough comparison because there's maybe, maybe not a good one to use anymore, is kind of like the people in the US will know DCG and Digital Currency Group and Barry Silbert and folks like that. And they, they had a.
00:03:15.675 - 00:03:37.907, Speaker A: They were a holding company, right? Owned Grayscale and Genesis and CoinDesk and all these different brands. But they also made a lot of investments and they're just a very influential player. And obviously DCG had their hiccups along the way with Genesis. They sold off CoinDesk. But that's like my mental model for how I think about evg. But I would love for you to share the just your. Like who are you and where are you from? And like what.
00:03:37.907 - 00:03:39.395, Speaker A: What is the EVG story?
00:03:39.555 - 00:04:26.557, Speaker B: Yeah, I wouldn't say. You know, you mentioned DCG is wrong. In fact, when we, when I decided to start a company, it was definitely one of the comms at the market we would kind of look at. And my journey is quite simple. I was born and raised between different places, China, Philippines, a little bit of Hong Kong, US and then I started doing startups like Web2Startups like 12, 13 years ago in college and was startup first become a word and then was lucky to so have two small exits early on and. And as any founder who made a little bit of money early on and not knowing what to do, you start a lot of fun approaches to become venture partners or entrepreneur residents and things like that. And I ended up joining one of the private equity firm to help them start their venture practice.
00:04:26.557 - 00:05:04.275, Speaker B: So I was there for about four years, helped them do TMTs, tags, entertainment, everything. And I was not one of those OG who had bitcoin in my computer. I extended again this space during the ICO wave. And then at the time Asia was actually was the center, I would say of ico, of everything. So it's quite easy to get into the scene. And then I kind of off surf in about 18 months in late 2018, decided that there might still be a chance to build a Tencent or ByteDance equivalent in Web3. So I started EVG in my apartment with a couple of my partners.
00:05:04.275 - 00:05:06.627, Speaker B: So that was the backdrop of the story.
00:05:06.771 - 00:05:15.139, Speaker A: So what is EVG today? How do you like even how many employees do you have? How many holding companies, how many investments? Like what are you guys.
00:05:15.307 - 00:05:55.877, Speaker B: Yep. So as of today we have about 300 people across our, I would say three main divisions. Right. So we have the social FI division which quickly has become our largest, you know, practices and we have, you know, OpenShot protocol is the infra and on top of that we got multiple different dapps, you know, composed on top of that. And also we got a gaming culture which is like a, you know, I would say where we had the initial success by because when EVG started we, we took a bet in gaming coming up. So we were the lead advisor and which help also published it like sandbox, Animoca adapter, et cetera. And they kind of make our first credibility in the industry.
00:05:55.877 - 00:06:25.485, Speaker B: And that is due today like a 90, 90 to 100 people operation there. And then the third pillar is the strategic pillar where we have significant stakes in media, in conferencing brands and also in asset management platforms and et cetera, et cetera. So the way I kind of think about it is really just like we're very consumer focused and we simply look at ourselves as like a multiproduct complex or in a simply manner is we build products. Right. That's how usually I like to call ourselves, product builders.
00:06:25.825 - 00:06:31.245, Speaker A: And do you raise, do you have an outside fund? Like have you raised outside capital or is it all internal prop capital?
00:06:31.775 - 00:07:03.345, Speaker B: Yeah, so we raised a little bit of not a lot. We raised probably like $10 million when I started the firm. Most of them are my XLPs, I would say but it's largely just prop cap. And then we were lucky that we took a bet on the right narrative I would say. And we curricula accumulated sizable balance sheets and then ever since then we've been using our balance sheet to kind of continue to do investments and build products. And lucky enough over some of the product they're successful, many of them are cash flow positive. So we're able to continue to grow.
00:07:03.345 - 00:07:21.429, Speaker B: And usually the model is we will build these products and usually, you know, closer after at least we see the product market fit or go to certain scaling phases, then we'll start showing our slates or the productions to maybe some of the VC communities and where, you know, where exchanges and where they will pick up some of the products, continue to fund the Scaling phases.
00:07:21.597 - 00:07:36.255, Speaker A: So let's get in. Let's move past EVG and just talk about maybe this first big question about. I'm curious what you think the west gets right about crypto in Asia and what the west gets wrong about crypto in Asia.
00:07:36.595 - 00:08:04.103, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a really good question. I think most of the. I think there's only very few people that get to Asia. Right. Unfortunately, simply because I think most of them have not spent enough time or really have traveled here. It's really funny. And then I think in people's mind, for example, I think loosely, people know a couple of things.
00:08:04.103 - 00:08:34.939, Speaker B: People think if I'm a project from the western world, Asia maybe have TVL for me, or Asia might have the exchanges and liquidity for me, or Asia would have maybe some chip developer for me, or there's a bunch of farmers out there that's probably, I think, at the high level, what they know. And I wouldn't say like the these brackets are wrong. I would say just like, you know, the understanding of it is. It really depends on whether do you spend time here or not. And it often will surprise you in many ways.
00:08:34.987 - 00:08:54.597, Speaker A: Right? Tell me. I mean, let's go deeper. Like, what is. What is one thing that. Okay, so here, let me. Maybe I'll tee up this question differently. So one thing that I hear a lot in, at least in New York, where I'm located, is, yeah, you know, there aren't users in New York because the users are all, you know, the regulations are too tight for the users.
00:08:54.597 - 00:09:01.589, Speaker A: So there's a lot of money in New York, in San Francisco and in the west, like, there's all these great venture firms, but to get a lot of users, I've got to go to Asia.
00:09:01.757 - 00:09:02.357, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:09:02.461 - 00:09:06.333, Speaker A: True or false that there are just a lot more crypto users in Asia?
00:09:06.469 - 00:09:38.525, Speaker B: That's totally true. Like, even look at, statistically speaking, six of the top six or seven of the top 10 countries in terms of crypto penetrations, they're all in Asia. And I think there's a reason for it, partially because even when Ethereum started, the basis was in Asia. A lot of people embrace it. And also I think a lot of people naturally saw or still see the benefit of crypto like the liberty of money, the liberty of controlling your assets. Because we have to understand most of the Asian countries are fundamentally autocratic country. Right.
00:09:38.525 - 00:10:17.375, Speaker B: Like if you look at most Asian countries, they have even Korea in its forex control. That means you can now move around, you can now swap your Korean one into US dollar Freely there's a budget of quota how many you can actually do it a year. So naturally people see their benefits really directly I would say and owning your data, only your assets and willing to try new things. And yeah, so I would definitely say the penetration rate is very, very high. And even though these users don't speak English, but there's a lot in a lot of them. Right. I mean I think, but I think one thing that people usually get wrong right there is people think about hey, they're just mostly just farmers or they're, they're.
00:10:17.375 - 00:10:26.115, Speaker B: These people are fake, they're here just for the incentive and they're non sophisticated. I think that's largely probably a for statement. Yeah.
00:10:26.775 - 00:10:27.751, Speaker A: How come?
00:10:27.943 - 00:10:43.185, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think, I think yes there is a lot of people here like that would. They're willing to jump on something because there is incentive. But I think also let's not pretend that the western project have not used incentive mechanism and Bitcoin, its core has a billion incentive models.
00:10:44.125 - 00:10:55.885, Speaker A: It's less that the users exactly. Are different. It's more that the projects in the US Maybe bash projects in Asia for using incentives and don't throw stones from glass houses. I see what you're saying.
00:10:55.965 - 00:11:01.989, Speaker B: Okay, yeah, totally, totally. I mean those incentive mechanism exists everywhere in Vampire Attack, Airdrop.
00:11:02.117 - 00:11:31.669, Speaker A: You know what it kind of reminds me of is, is actually the US is like global warming or like climate change, whatever you want to, you know, just the environment. It's like the US Obviously got to where we are from like mass pollution and coal and whatever you want to call it. I'm not going to wade into that whole topic that is feel sensitive these days. These days. But the truth of it is that the US did all these things and now that the US is on top, we're like hey India, hey China. Like you're not allowed to go do all these things. And they're like whoa, hold on.
00:11:31.669 - 00:12:04.669, Speaker A: Take a look in the mirror guys. So um, okay, what about. So one thing that I was, I had dinner with B. From Hashed several months ago and you know, we were just talking about the, the differences of the impact of Terra versus ftx. So I think people in the US don't understand. I'd love to just hear your, your discussion and conversation of like what happened in the last like year or maybe in the last two years. Like so Terra blew up in What, May of 2022?
00:12:04.797 - 00:12:05.205, Speaker B: Yes.
00:12:05.285 - 00:12:33.919, Speaker A: And it was a. There, there's a lot of users in Asia. It's like people especially in Korea. And then FTX blew up in what, November of 2022. And obviously there's a lot of, you know, there's, there, there are a lot of users in Asia as well. But like I feel like FTX really had this horrible impact on the US regulatory market for crypto. I'm curious, did like, did FTX have as big of an impact in Asia? Was the blow up of Terra bigger? Like tell me about how the last like.
00:12:34.007 - 00:12:37.743, Speaker B: Yeah, I personally think it's even bigger, like from a real money or a real flow.
00:12:37.799 - 00:12:39.951, Speaker A: You think Terra was even bigger than ftx?
00:12:40.063 - 00:12:41.215, Speaker B: No, no, FTX is bigger.
00:12:41.255 - 00:12:42.087, Speaker A: Oh, FTX is bigger.
00:12:42.111 - 00:13:24.535, Speaker B: Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. This probably because Big is Korean, so he's a friend. But, but I think, I think obviously both of them impact the many country. I'm not saying which one is worse, but we have to remember actually FTX started in Hong Kong. Their office is right Next probably like 10 minutes away from my walking distance from my office. And then when they first started, how did they pick up the flow and trading flow and users is because they pitch every single major wells and trading funds and at the time also a lot of like wells family office to trade on top of them. And so and for example, like you know, entire like for example look at Taiwan, there's a lot of users that suffer from the losses from FTX and Hong Kong as well.
00:13:24.535 - 00:13:44.775, Speaker B: And honestly at the time they're really good at user experience. Right. You can transfer the money into Silver Gate and you get the money in right away. The on ramp, off ramp was good. So a lot of users account with them. I think it only has a bigger impact in the US is because in the later part after they use Asia for the success for the business, they raise a lot of capital from the U.S. right.
00:13:44.775 - 00:13:56.629, Speaker B: And then they bring in a lot of famous people to get involved so that become much more bigger optic thing where Luna don't have that kind of, I would say success in the uptake, to be honest, during the period of time.
00:13:56.717 - 00:14:26.279, Speaker A: Yeah, that's fair, that's fair. Who, who leads? Okay, thinking about like I'm trying to articulate this question on the go but like when you, when, when you, when it comes to like narratives, for example, do you think that there's like the US leads and then Asia kind of follows? Or does Asia lead and the US follows or is it like two things happen at the exact same time in both locations? Or look, you have two totally different things happening in two totally different areas of the world.
00:14:26.407 - 00:15:00.109, Speaker B: Yeah, I think in terms of narrative wise I would say definitely at this time, if I have to come up with number I was a us has a little bit more power because narrative is largely, I would say influenced by venture capital shops. Right. That's where the money go. That's what captures most media's report. That's what kind of people like this is hot versus that's hot, right? And actually a lot of founders, especially the more garage founders, they would kind of try to gear towards the topics that where you can raise funds. Right. And there's nothing wrong about it.
00:15:00.109 - 00:15:20.487, Speaker B: It happens in Web two as well. AI is hot. Everyone is AI startup, right? And then but I do think, you know, on a lot of narrative you will see very different interpretations or a very different flavor of how do you see that narrative. Right. Or try to build product around the narrative. Right. Like recently if you for example, look at Deepin, right.
00:15:20.487 - 00:15:32.263, Speaker B: Like previously when Hawaii's America launched earlier this year, a lot of Deepin project was about solar panel building on your rooftop and it kind of earns, you know, turns energy into whatever and then you know, mix your tokens and about.
00:15:32.319 - 00:15:36.275, Speaker A: Building a description of Deepen. Yeah, let's put a solar panel.
00:15:38.615 - 00:15:41.693, Speaker B: If you look at Asia, our interpretation is popular, right?
00:15:41.789 - 00:15:44.021, Speaker A: Wait, is what is what if pop, right?
00:15:44.053 - 00:15:47.021, Speaker B: Like basically vape to earn, right? Oh, pop puff.
00:15:47.053 - 00:15:48.421, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, Vape to earn. Yeah. Okay.
00:15:48.453 - 00:16:23.871, Speaker B: So it's like that is the deep end because you know what? This is a product you got to use every day. You have addiction to nicotine, you just, you just have to use them and so you don't force their behavior. Because we consider like Capex is a very high hurdle and friction, so you might as well do something with it. And that's why also we invested in them. So I think if you look at like even like Shou Sho look at many different topics, they tend to be very different in terms of the product because that. That I would say understanding or appetite or determining what is beautiful or not is a little bit different. But I would say largely like both side of the world has understand these narratives, right?
00:16:23.943 - 00:16:51.709, Speaker A: Yeah. What are the. What are the hot projects in Asia like do okay. When it comes to you know, exchanges or like in Defi like is Uniswap and are like Uniswap and AAVE and Eigenlayer like the. The Tier 1 DeFi players in Asia or is it like mantle and other people or like the. Everyone knows the exchanges are different, right. The US is dominated by Coinbase and Kraken and folks like that.
00:16:51.709 - 00:17:01.943, Speaker A: Asia is like okx and I don't know where Huobi's at these days, but obviously Bybits had an amazing last couple of years. Binance as well. Like, tell me about the differences in the companies.
00:17:02.039 - 00:17:39.304, Speaker B: I would say yeah, yeah, I think definitely in Asia the exchange has a lot more power, for sure. It's not necessarily in a bad way, the way I kind of look at it, Asia. Because if you look at, for example, if I try to throw a statistic on, if you look at like the people, the company with the largest number of employees, almost all of them, I guarantee you are exchanges, right? Like they're talking about 1000, 2000, 3000. Right. Some of the exchanges get like 500, 1000 compliance people, right? Yeah. Actually sometimes I argue they have better compliance than TRAFI because TRAPI don't even get that much. Many compliance people.
00:17:39.304 - 00:18:19.127, Speaker B: And so they are the biggest organization. They have the most budget, they have the most complete suite of product. And often they don't just do exchanges. They also often have their structure, product desk. They would have their media arm, they would have their venture capital arm and they have many, many different arms to operate the market. So I would say definitely they're like, I would say, you know, very powerful players. And then the second bucket of company I would say is like, you can think of like there are gangs or mafias or groups of like of companies, right? You can think of them as almost like a little bit like a PayPal mafia, if I have to use like American reference for it.
00:18:19.127 - 00:19:01.801, Speaker B: Like, for example, in Vietnam you will have the Sky Mavis gang, you have the coin 98 gang. And those are all, you know, they're successful builders and that's why they also attract the other team around them. They're also back to other younger guys who coming up. So they have their own, you know, your teams at Mavius and obviously in Hong Kong, like, you know, we and probably Enmoca brands are the two biggest larger building groups headquartered here. And then so in different places there are, I would say teams and groups that builds products. And then I would say the product groups have, you know, largely exists and they work, you know, cohesively together. And then, and then also I would say there is a lot of like individual, like family offices, whales, the new money.
00:19:01.801 - 00:19:18.391, Speaker B: Because we also have to remember in crypto, especially early days, a lot of the biggest whales in Bitcoin and Ethereum, they're all Chinese, right. Back in the day, it's hard to get the miners, right? And then so, so a lot of them are here. So they're, you know, a little bit more distributed across different places as well.
00:19:18.583 - 00:19:22.275, Speaker A: Maybe a really dumb question, but why are all the whales in Asia?
00:19:23.295 - 00:19:55.555, Speaker B: I think it's. Yeah, I had to do with that. Like, you know, for example, when, when, when Vidali, you know, started Ethereum here, those what we call Ethereum angel who bought a 0.29 per Ethereum, they're largely at the time all in Shanghai or Zhong or all near the area. And there's probably like 5, 10 major backer that at the time, just this, you know, at the time, a skinny kid who speak Mandarin and talking about decentralization. Right? And it was like, I don't know, it's like. And that gang just spread, right? And there's encouraged more people to come in.
00:19:55.555 - 00:20:24.535, Speaker B: And then I think for bitcoin mining it was also the same thing is that obviously, except the early days where you can mine bitcoin with a computer or laptop, once you get into the ASIC chip kind of like era, all those chips and mining miner were made in this part of the world. And obviously the pools are all in this part of world. So you can't even get at the time. It's very hard for you to get like NS9. You can't even get one right. So that's why a lot of like mining facility will stack up here. So naturally they have more holdings in terms of all these major coins.
00:20:24.995 - 00:20:41.543, Speaker A: Okay, I want to come back to the Whales in a second. Okay, so the three buckets of power, I would say are the exchanges, the gangs and mafias. Well, we should find a better word to describe them. And then the family offices in the Whales. Okay, so with the gangs and mafias, what.
00:20:41.599 - 00:20:42.223, Speaker B: Who.
00:20:42.399 - 00:21:06.915, Speaker A: Tell me more about this group. Like okay, evg, Animoca, like Sky Mavis, Viet Sky Mavis in Vietnam. Like I've noticed, I've noticed that in Asia this exists and the US it doesn't exist that much. Okay, so in the US you might have like Brian Armstrong starts Coinbase and just turns into like Coinbase. I don't know. They've got obviously Coinbase and Coinbase Ventures and stuff, but I don't know. Jeremy Allaire starts Circle.
00:21:06.915 - 00:21:33.925, Speaker A: It's kind of just like he's got circle, like he's just trying to build that. But in Asia you kind of get these like branching out of these founders. Okay, so take, take Bybit for example. Like Bybit gets so like Ben turns Bybit into a very successful thing that turns into like Nirvana Ventures, like Bitdao and mantle. Like it's kind. And now it's kind of this whole like, I don't know, you got your arms in kind of everything. Why is that dynamic exist?
00:21:34.225 - 00:22:17.999, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it has to do with. I think also it doesn't just exist for Web3, right. If you look at realities, like if you look at Asia, for example, in China, yeah, there is hundreds of publicly listed Internet company, but there's largely like two, three gangs, right? There's Alibaba gang and they have many products and they're major or significant stakeholder of many other platform. And then there's the Tencent gang, if you look at Korea or Japan is similar. There's Naver, there's cacao, and there are many products under them. And look at Southeast Asia is also similar. And I think it fundamentally has to do with a little bit of a culture and how to actually I would say do business here.
00:22:17.999 - 00:23:16.543, Speaker B: I think in Asia, like is much harder for. Because I was a startup and I didn't talk about this because I was, you know, it came up from grassroots as well. I was. When I was first doing startup, it was really difficult, right? Because like you're, you're the whole garage founder or mentality or like, hey, I'm a college guy, I'm really smart, I'm talented, and I'm the chosen one. That kind of story really don't exist because people look a lot about your relevancy. People look a lot about your reputation, your track record, your credibility is almost like you have to earn these things, right? And honestly, it's not something bad. It's just like in Asia, when we look at a business, we don't necessarily just look at, hey, is your idea good or are you talented? We also look at the fact that what have you done in the past? How do you trip people? How do you deal with your highs? How do you deal with your lows? How do you deal with those stress times and how to deal with temptations, right? Can you resist them? Right? So you look at all those things, do you do right by the people? So those things become a really important part of you.
00:23:16.543 - 00:24:15.397, Speaker B: And also, for example, a lot of time people also look at like, who are your mentors? Who are your senses to a certain degree, right? So I think there is a little bit of like that almost a little bit like hip hop, right? Like, you know, when Eminem won that needed to Rock and Roll hall of Fame, he would adjust like, you know Dre, he would just park. He was just many people who was like, they're my teachers, they brought me up. And there is that kind of, I would say, culture in Asia. In Asia. So that kind of also makes, like, it is a little bit, I would say, harder for a very talented individual who has no charter cut, you know, whatsoever to come up because he had to go through this process. But for the people who already go up, obviously they have natural advantage in terms of like, having already the trust, having already the shortcut, and they're much easier to kind of leverage those social capital and everything to branch out into other business and attract better talent, attract more capital, attract better opportunities around it. So I think it's a little bit of that culture, cultural phenomena as well.
00:24:15.397 - 00:24:39.181, Speaker B: And I think that is just getting amplified in crypto because in crypto, obviously, like, we all know, like, there's so many startups, so many founders, so many ideas, but the percentage of, I would say the people who are not capable or not sincere is just even a little bit higher. The market is even a little bit more chaotic. Right. So you leave you a handful of people who are trustworthy and they tend to attract even more. It's just a power law, right?
00:24:39.213 - 00:25:12.201, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, let's. Let's actually like explore that rabbit hole for a second. So, you know, you and I have talked about how it's a little more hierarchical in doing business in Asia, where, okay, in the US it's very, like very bottoms up. Very, you know, a seller can go like, sell to someone and then inside of the company it kind of like, hey, I recommend a junior person's like, I recommend we do this thing. And then it kind of trickles up. In Asia, I feel like it's a lot more top down where you might have a mentor, let's say, or a big brother or something.
00:25:12.201 - 00:25:37.427, Speaker A: And that person, let's say they're the CEO of an exchange or the CEO of an L1 or something. And they launch and they're like, hey, go move your apps onto this L1. And you're like, okay, that's my guy. I do it. Whereas in the US how that would work is like, all right, the L1 is going to go create a BD team. And hey, like, I don't want to use my influence to influence anything. So, like, but in Asia it feels very different.
00:25:37.427 - 00:25:43.979, Speaker A: So agree or disagree with that statement and we'd love to, would love to hear some examples of like, how that maybe works.
00:25:44.147 - 00:26:26.543, Speaker B: I think. Totally agree. I think I have, you know, experienced this for, you know, when things are stuck and, you know, you know, I would similarly, you know, when I call my big brother and ask for help and just say, you know what? I know there's a lot of, you know, things that are fluid currently. You know, we can talk terms all day long and think about all this stuff and your team, your lawyer trying to counter my lawyer and come with all the, you know, exact things, or I'm gonna just tell you that I'll give my best, you know, at this. Right? We're gonna give it a try. And I think a lot of time it's just like, okay, I trust you, I believe you. Right? You're, you're, you're my little brothers or you're my bro and let's go, right? And we take that word almost as a bond.
00:26:26.543 - 00:26:47.947, Speaker B: That was like a very important thing because you kind of value your reputation a lot. What other people say about you. Is he reliable? Does he deliver? Is he sincere? It's not like in Asia. You cannot accept failure. I think people often mistaken that. We understand this is a venture, we understand this is hard. This is a startup.
00:26:47.947 - 00:27:15.583, Speaker B: So we know there's a high value rate. Failure is always okay. But I think it's more like you have this construct so that, you know, people who are not sincere would not be able to get into the, I would say top table so easily because unless they're endorsed by someone, right? So I think the people who endorse is almost as important as whatever the idea who he or she want to say. Because you're relying on that guy's reference as almost like a data point.
00:27:15.719 - 00:27:21.195, Speaker A: Huh? Who? This might be too personal, but who is your, who's your like, quote, like Big Brother?
00:27:21.585 - 00:27:52.287, Speaker B: There's a lot, to be honest, like over my career in Shopify and entrepreneurship and Web three, I tend to think that I learned a lot of different things from different people. Like, for example, like, you know, many people know in the market. I work very closely with Yap from Animoca, right. I know him for way before Web3, probably 10 years now. And we went to Battlefield together many times. And he taught me a lot about, you know, especially over the years, about how to articulate a vision. And he's one of the.
00:27:52.287 - 00:28:10.895, Speaker B: I was the most amazing guy to do it. It's like, you know, you have a vision, you have to. You don't. You can't just trap in your head, like how to articulate for others how to build a culture around you. So I think I learned a lot in that department from him. And he's a guy I Call up, you know, over midnight. Like if I have a problem about managing teams or about certain things.
00:28:10.895 - 00:28:39.035, Speaker B: And there's other people I call for deals, there's other people I call for products. Like, you know, like I was in Australia once and I was hang out with Jerry, the founder of Stepn. And in my mind, Jerry's definitely no doubt one of the best product manager out there or product genius out there. And at the time was brains brainstorming around product. I was like, how would you do it? Right? So I think there's like people good at different things and you go to for different idea and advices. And I think that's all very, very important.
00:28:41.215 - 00:29:03.445, Speaker A: Okay, let's say, let's say you've got like a BD person, a lot of BD people going to go into token this year. So you're a BD person, you're flying out from New York and you're, you're trying to either, I don't know, break into one of the go meet with some whales to get some TVL for your staking thing, or you're trying to strike a deal with someone. What is the difference between how maybe sales and business development works in the US versus how it works in Asia?
00:29:03.905 - 00:29:35.075, Speaker B: Yeah. So first of all, I think unless they are, let's say someone, a project that's like, you know, I would say the five names we all talk about this year, right. I get embarrassed, whatever, you're super hot and everyone just show up and trying to talk to you. Unless that's the case for I think most of the founders, you gotta find local partners. You first gotta map your landscape to be honest. Right. Because sometimes talking to the wrong people would do even more damage than because like, oh my God, that's the people you associate with.
00:29:35.075 - 00:29:42.955, Speaker B: And then you end up breaking about, I just had breakfast with this guy and other people was like, oh, why are you in bed of scammer? Right?
00:29:43.455 - 00:29:55.563, Speaker A: Or even one interesting thing for me is you told me you're like, don't go have breakfast with maybe a lower level salesperson or whatever because people then will associate you with that level. Essentially.
00:29:55.699 - 00:30:17.275, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think there is a hierarchy in a certain way. But this has come off from a good thing and respect as well. It's like in Asia with this culture that if my counterpart is a CEO and he show up, I have to show up. I cannot just send my junior Beatty guy, we completely disrespecting him. Right. And if they send a vp, I gotta send a VP into.
00:30:17.275 - 00:30:36.655, Speaker B: But it's not as strict as, like, Japan, where Japan is like, you've sent three people. I have to send people. Exactly. To match it. In the corporate culture, it's not as strict as that. But in generally speaking, people do tend to think that, like, for example, I curate a lot of dinners over the year. I probably curate, I don't know, 100 dinner over the year for friends who come in town.
00:30:36.655 - 00:31:02.701, Speaker B: I'll match them up. I will host other people. And I'm always very, you know, careful about who brings in and, you know, you know, who would they have more interest, you know, more interesting angles or synergies that they can chat with and et cetera. Right. And I think all these, you know, kind of like, you need to articulate that, you know, social environment as importantly as the idea itself. Right. So, yeah, I think there's a little bit of things that you want to pay attention and also, like, for example, you want to go to a new market.
00:31:02.701 - 00:31:21.015, Speaker B: Let's say you want to go to Vietnam, right? The most effective way for you to do it is like, you're going to map just like, who. Who's the most influential guy there. Right. For example, like, if I. Let's say I want to take a divide product and try to grow in Vietnam, I would try to have knock on, let's say, Coin ID store. And I was like, hey, Tan. Tan is the founder of that.
00:31:21.015 - 00:31:47.485, Speaker B: This is my product. I want to come into your market. This is what I want to do. I would like to collaborate with you, and if you get his blessing, you actually make the rest of your job so much easier because, like, that would go a long way. Like, because, you know, they're, you know, there are 300 people there, like 12th Floor. They have 9 million users. Like, so for you to just get his blessing and that will make your job so much easier talking to other people, right? And other people probably all invested by him, to be honest.
00:31:48.625 - 00:31:57.465, Speaker A: Alan, I feel, I feel so bad for your, for your DMS after this podcast because everyone's going to say, can you make. Hey, Alan, I heard you on Empire. Can you make an introduction for me to.
00:31:57.545 - 00:32:02.101, Speaker B: No, I'm, I'm very, I'm very happy to do all year long, to be honest.
00:32:02.193 - 00:32:48.123, Speaker A: Yeah. Hey, everyone, Jason here. I wanted to talk about something that's been on my mind a lot recently, and that is, where are all of crypto's killer apps? We often ask this question on the show. So I'm excited to tell you about Empire's latest partner, Anoma, the universal intent Machine intents are a new way to build dapps, enabling users to say what they want without needing to specify how it's done. Let's say you have an NFT on one chain, but you want to swap it for a token on another chain. To make things even worse, you also don't know which bridge to trust or how to navigate different dexes on each chain disaster, right? But here's the good news. Thanks to Intense, you can just tell the app what you want to do, and Anoma's Solver network takes care of all the complexity in the background.
00:32:48.123 - 00:33:37.253, Speaker A: We're excited to see what cool DAPPS Anoma's architecture will unlock. To stay up to date with Anoma, you can follow them at X or sign up for the newsletter@anoma.net Special thanks to Anoma for sponsoring today's episode hey everyone, I'm excited to tell you about fbtc, an Omnichain Bitcoin asset being used throughout Defi today. It launched back in July and since then it's accumulated about $157 million in total value. Locked FBTC aims to make Bitcoin more accessible and useful in various Defi applications. Currently, you can use FBTC on both the Ethereum and Mantle networks. FBTC is highly composable, interoperable and secure with over 27 starting partners.
00:33:37.253 - 00:34:21.039, Speaker A: If you're ready to get started, check out the rewards program Sparkle, designed to reward users. Eligible FBTC positions will now accrue sparks. They're also offering additional rewards like like a token airdrop from a project called Babylon and a new token from mantle called co. Get started at fbtc.com ongoing-campaign Huge thanks to Mantle for sponsoring today's episode. This episode is brought to you by Polygon. Polygon Labs is developing the next generation of open source Zero knowledge tech to aggregate crypto liquidity and user bases, empowering developers to grow in a unified web of interoperable chains.
00:34:21.039 - 00:34:48.153, Speaker A: With the AG layer, that was a big mouthful. So I'm going to tell you what it means in my in my words, there's all these things popping up, L2s and L3s and it's chaos, right? If you are building something, you no longer have to worry about bootstrapping liquidity. You can basically just build in the AG layer to tap into the liquidity of the AG layer and the users of the aggressive AG layer. You get the users, you get the liquidity. It's the AG layer. It's hot. It's by Polygon Labs They've got the Polygon Community Grants Program.
00:34:48.153 - 00:35:10.935, Speaker A: It was launched with 1 billion tokens just for Polygon builders. Season one, it's live right now. It features 35 million in Matic to support the next generation of Polygon Builders. Join the aggregated future today by applying at Polygon Technology Forward Slash Grants. That's Polygon Technology Grants. If you talk to anyone, let them know. Blockwork sent you.
00:35:10.935 - 00:35:57.141, Speaker A: Hey everyone. I wanted to take a second to talk about real. A permissionless L2 for tokenized real world assets on Arbitrum Orbit. What's really cool about REAL is that it uses the off chain yields from RWAS as a sustainable solution for native liquidity incentives. Real is also the first L2 where 100% of profits from transaction fees and and fees from protocols accrue back to the L2's governance token. RWA Real has just launched their rewards program where 10% of the RWA supply is being given away to early users of the chain. Users can provide concentrated liquidity, trade, borrow and leverage tokenized real world assets including T bills, real estate and tokenized basis trades.
00:35:57.141 - 00:36:52.411, Speaker A: Just as a quick disclaimer, this is not investment advice or product solicitation and not aimed at US persons. Find out more at Re Al Rewards. Special thanks to REAL for sponsoring today's episode. Okay, tell me about how different. You know, I kind of feel like this like white guy talking about like Asia. But like really Asia is like you know, Taiwan and Hong Kong and different areas of China and Japan and a lot of people are going to Singapore and there's Korea and like I have no idea of the differences between those communities and the influential people there and the influential companies. So maybe you can just give me a like brain dump of okay, Vietnam you mentioned like Sky Mavis, like what is the Vietnam like crypto community like compared to Korea, compared to Japan, compared to Singapore.
00:36:52.411 - 00:36:54.667, Speaker A: Like tell give me the brain dump of these different countries.
00:36:54.771 - 00:37:33.415, Speaker B: Yeah, I can give you the high level of it because each one of them with a lot of uniqueness. And I would say for example you mentioned Vietnam versus Korea. I would tend to say it might be a little bit botan but but I'll say like Vietnam is a lot more on user for sure. And and actually it's really funny. Like you know, in Vietnam you look at it, it's like only 1% of people have stocks and trade stocks because their stock market was not so developed until now and then but actually like over I think 12% of people population own crypto. So crypto in there Has a word called magic Internet money. It's like everyone's calling that.
00:37:33.415 - 00:38:37.613, Speaker B: And in Korea where you know where I see this less on chain users but has lot higher activity in terms of all coin trading and the algo trading often have premiums and it's more speculative in a certain degree but. But on chain user is a little bit less. I would say they're less familiar with like wallets et cetera and defi and different type of things. If you look at like for example like greater China and look at greater China I think if you're wisdom project the thing you're gonna think about is how to leverage the develop pool, right? Like you know, I think people don't understand sometime is like China has two time with engineer or three time engineer that America has and the rate is so much better. The rate car is so much better. Like just to give an example, it's like a fan grade engineer which is the equivalent in Asia will be like Alibaba, Tencent, TikTok et cetera. A three year experience guy from there, if you're able to steal him it will probably cost you about like 60k 70k US dollar a year which I think America will be 3 times of that easily or 4 times of that easily.
00:38:37.613 - 00:39:15.517, Speaker B: An 8 to 10 year experience like you know from those company will be probably about 150. So that will be still like you know, three times more expensive in America. But if you think about them, it's like you know, if you're building a product unless it's something like super world changing or some cryptography stuff that nobody can understand except two scientists in Israel. Other than that most likely if I have three times of your people I can iterate three times faster and I can almost guarantee I can beat you. So it's why TikTok beat Facebook. It's like, you know, it's not nothing about attack. The tech is live streaming, is tipping, it's those type of things.
00:39:15.517 - 00:39:45.955, Speaker B: It's nothing new. But if I iterate three times faster, it's a guaranteed win in three times. So that's why I always put you know like a mental. You know, if you think about a mental framework is a million dollar raise in America. If you spend those a million dollar America for R and D, you're going to get three times the result if you spend them versus you know, China or Asia. So I think that is the advantage you can possibly think about is like there are so many good developers you can tap. If you're L1, you should leverage that you know, if you are building, trying to build a consumer product, you should leverage that.
00:39:45.955 - 00:39:58.579, Speaker B: I think many people should try to leverage that. Right. In general. And Taiwan is actually on the other hand like we have a big operation in town. We have about 50, 40 people there. Taiwan is a very unique market. It's actually a really sizable country.
00:39:58.579 - 00:40:30.005, Speaker B: It's half of the population of Australia and it's very high apru. Right. If you look at like for example the app store spending the opera was like probably you know, top five, top six in the world in terms of gaming and many consumer categories, et cetera. And so it's actually itself a very good market. And Taiwan is you know, adopting a lot of new crypto regulations like you know, by next. By the end of next year you can buy bitcoin from Most of the 711 and the most of the family mart, the convenience store. So they're pushing regulation pretty aggressively versus I think Japan is a little bit different.
00:40:30.005 - 00:40:49.117, Speaker B: Japan is like they're much more into cultural stuff right. NFTs, IPs and et cetera. And then in their construct is very different. They got their own set of regulation for listing which is governed by the consortium of exchange on themselves. So I would say Japan is a little bit. Maybe a little bit more. Slightly more isolated and also because the language barrier to be honest.
00:40:49.117 - 00:41:05.011, Speaker B: But there will be like for example like the biggest Dao in Japan is called McDowell. It's run by this billionaire called MC who went around the orbit. He has like 10 million followers on Twitter. And most. Most of the my friends have never heard of amazing doll and they got.
00:41:05.043 - 00:41:09.683, Speaker A: Like I've never, I've never heard of that. I've never got half a million people in that.
00:41:09.859 - 00:41:13.043, Speaker B: That reads the newsletter you know, follows everything.
00:41:13.219 - 00:41:13.755, Speaker A: It's crazy.
00:41:13.795 - 00:41:34.105, Speaker B: So powerful. Right. But you probably never heard about how many people do so there. I think they got their own isolated community and etc and they. The last part that people like to compare Hong Kong and Singapore a lot and. And I think they're very different. Singapore get a little bit more I would say obviously a couple exchanges a headquartered there.
00:41:34.105 - 00:42:01.475, Speaker B: The owners are there but apart from that it's more like garage teams right. And Hong Kong has always been I would say like a bigger capital hub. So there's a lot more. I was a capital related activity happened in Hong Kong and the bigger groups are usually based in Hong Kong. I think there are many differences. So ultimately I think what I try to bring out is there is different advantage you can tap into for different reasons.
00:42:01.855 - 00:42:42.975, Speaker A: Got it okay, what about the enterprise scene? So in the US the enterprise blockchain was kind of laughed at for a while and I think even at when a lot of these L1s and L2s started trying to get the corporates onto their chains in 2020 and 2021, I mean it all basically was fluffy. But in Asia I see you know, Sony launching Sonium which is, and they're, and they're spending, I mean they're spending, they must be spending like a million bucks at Token this year because they're one of the title sponsors and you know that's probably a seven figure cost right there alone. So what I mean, yeah, tell me about like corporates and enterprises getting into crypto.
00:42:43.135 - 00:42:57.321, Speaker B: Yeah. I think in Asia many of them have tried it. I can't say how successful they are so far. Like I always have like honestly my fair bit of, I'm always like a little bit skeptical about you know, when it comes.
00:42:57.353 - 00:43:00.473, Speaker A: Okay, so maybe it's more similar to the US than. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:43:00.529 - 00:43:08.913, Speaker B: I think the outcome is like is after all, you know, is when you're big you have a lot more things you gotta, you gotta worry about.
00:43:09.049 - 00:43:09.765, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:43:10.105 - 00:44:04.549, Speaker B: One of the product that Bill, I would say that failed but taught me a lesson is at the time I partnered with this really big $20 billion puppet company w product and install wallet across all their things and things were going well, raising money, products finish a six month negotiations, it's finally about to launch and the Luna happens and then ftx. And when that happened even the owner is like he believe in blockchain but the problem is just you know, he has $20 billion market cap to protect. So for him to, to, to do, to take that risk is like, you know, it could be resolved at a 10%, 20% job with the share price. So you know, and it's just not worth it. So I think, I think it's on that pie is probably more similar but I think in Asia it's like they, a lot of them is like making a lot of trials. You saw in Japan, you saw a little bit in Korea. But I would say a lot of activity come from bottom up and actually less institutional.
00:44:04.549 - 00:44:21.865, Speaker B: Like I always tell people, a lot of people obviously ask me about the activity in Hong Kong ever since regulation came out and I'm like to be completely honest, most people care more about what scissors said than what SFC in Hong Kong said. Right. I think that one thing you can.
00:44:21.905 - 00:44:28.953, Speaker A: Change is that you're saying that even in Hong Kong they might care more about what SEC says than their regulator because that drives the whole market.
00:44:29.089 - 00:44:52.227, Speaker B: Of course like, like the center of finance and of institutional finance is in Wall street is in New York city, is in D.C. right. Like these are place who. Who kind of decide whether you have ETF and etc and other people follow suit. Right. And and I think, I think that is probably the most for I think for institutional adoption no doubt. I think America east coast continue will be the most dominant center.
00:44:52.227 - 00:45:04.305, Speaker B: Everyone else will be followers for consumer adoptions. Consumer infra I think is going to come more information developer adoption I think you're going to see a little bit both on both both side of the world.
00:45:07.925 - 00:45:39.309, Speaker A: What about the exchange wars? They're like two big I guess I'll call them wars that I wanted to get your take on. Like there's the these, there's the exchange wars like Bybit okx again I literally don't even know if Huobi is still around Binance just want to get your take on that battle that's going on and like maybe some. I'm curious if there are things that you know about that that people in the west maybe don't have visibility into. And then a very similar question but for like L1 L2 wars and if it's maybe it's the exact same us. So let's start with exchanges.
00:45:39.437 - 00:46:25.265, Speaker B: Yeah, you're about to get me into troubles. I'm just kidding. I think like I wouldn't see you know is complete wall. Like you see them doing events together, you see them sharing panel together and most of this owner actually they are friends and their respect for each other. Like recently in Taiwan I hang out with one exchange owner and he literally told me I asked my team to learn more from OkX. Their product is so crafted in such a good way we should learn more of the user experience and et cetera, et cetera. So I think they have like that respect for each other but obviously I think on some side like maybe they'll compete for certain markets and et cetera they will all try to launch a wallet.
00:46:25.265 - 00:46:43.061, Speaker B: Therefore sure to compete for deals. Right. And I think for founders how to navigate that is kind of important. Right? Obviously. This year we've announced four group level partnership with four different exchanges and for different things. And I think for a founder you just try to stay neutral. Right.
00:46:43.061 - 00:47:27.319, Speaker B: I think ultimately you try to be friend with everybody. You know they are very important. They provide liquidies, they provide access to users and but what I fundamentally believe is if you got a great product in Yourself, other people would like to fight over you, right? So just focus on creating your own value then trying to think about how much time I should spend on certain guys or whatever. But I think there is something that I do observe the differences between, I would say, you know, when it comes to exchanges is that a lot of my West End founders, they would have less clue about how the exchange listing criteria is. And then they would try to also demonize them a little bit, to be honest. Or they're like, yeah, it's all about relationship, right? It's all about getting to know who's who. There's a backdoor.
00:47:27.319 - 00:47:50.623, Speaker B: And in our world, we don't think like that. We think like, it's almost like applying Ivy League school. So when I apply to, let's say Harvard, yeah. There's a certain SAT criteria you got to, you know, you're going to fulfill. And then you gotta, your aisle is gonna exit, let's say 7.5. And then you gotta write article, you may be gonna get a reference check, whatever. But basically, like, if you ask like a lot of founders, the easy test is as a founder is like, hey, okay, you're raising this round.
00:47:50.623 - 00:48:25.929, Speaker B: Do you know what exactly is the listing criteria currently? If he can answer you, that means you don't even know what's SAT score. But I can exactly answer you. It's like, okay, how many website traffic you need to get, how many Twitter following to get, how to rate S quality project versus A quality project versus A plus and B quality projects and what a category they will look for. And honestly, till today is already very standard. It's like exam, right? You could just kind of take this exam. Regardless how many people you know, if your product do not fulfill these qualities, you're not getting into Harvard. So it's actually quite, you know, I would say like a fairer competition to a certain degree, of course.
00:48:25.929 - 00:48:41.999, Speaker B: Like among everyone that check all the boxes of Harvard, the ones that's better relationship and better brand and better reputation. Of course, you might be the one that have, you know, let's say in a good market, you are the one who can go first, but then it's not like you can skip those boxes and still jump through them. Right?
00:48:42.047 - 00:48:50.315, Speaker A: Yeah. What about the L, like the L1 and L2 wars? What's maybe the difference between how that looks like in Asia versus how that looks in the, in the, in the states?
00:48:51.255 - 00:49:20.647, Speaker B: I think L1 and L2, to be honest. Like, you know, there is, there's a lot of L1, L2 from Asia but obviously the most talked about one are still the ones from the West. I have to admit one thing is like Asia had many L1s over the years. Like I can recall from the early days, there's Korea, yeah. Nio qt, there is Celica, there's many of them. They all at one point was bring pretty high in terms of market cap. But I just think it's.
00:49:20.647 - 00:49:59.693, Speaker B: I kind of personally my view is like it's also to do with little bit of culture like why Asian people generally are less good L1 builder and I think have maybe have something to do with religion. Right. So I was actually explaining this to smoking yesterday. I was exactly talking about it was smoking yesterday and I was like we don't go to church when we grow up. We, we don't have like a father figure who's preaching, evangelizing, holding hand, singing prayers and, and it's like you know what, let me save you etc right. Like we, we grew up and when we go to temple is usually when we need something, right? You go to temple. It's like dude, help me land this job please.
00:49:59.693 - 00:50:27.011, Speaker B: Right? Make my BDC goes up. So you're very pragmatic. Asian people are like just super pragmatic, very good at solving problems and then. But we're very bad in terms of like preaching like this is good for you, you should be one of us. Right. That kind of things. And, and so when we think about like what kind of product we should usually we'll go into a very specific scenario of like I'm going to solve this problem better than anyone else.
00:50:27.011 - 00:50:44.355, Speaker B: It's like almost like you're going to math. Right. And so you start with the exact use case versus you're good at really good at preaching. So. So I think maybe it's just cultural thing. I don't know. But so far I haven't seen a lot of you know, I would say like in Asia everyone talk about, you know, Bara Monad.
00:50:44.355 - 00:50:46.281, Speaker B: They talk about the same thing you guys talk about out.
00:50:46.353 - 00:51:20.295, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. I mean the big difference in my mind seems to be that the L1s and L2s that have done quite well over there are also run by the exchanges. And we're, we. We really haven't seen this in the states until obviously Coinbase and Base and I think there'll be a couple other big US crypto exchanges that launch L L2s probably later this year or early next I would assume. But yeah, I mean it's like Bybit Mantle OKX obviously has Done a great job. And then Binance has obviously done a phenomenal job with BSC too.
00:51:20.875 - 00:51:53.333, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, I think. Well, obviously look at like BNB like op. Like we just recently went up a product, just part of opbnb to deploy our social graph on top and build product with them. And I think all of them are really aggressive. And to be honest, what matters to users, I think what matters to developer ultimately is a couple of things, right? And I think for any good developers, money should not be a problem because if you're a good developer you can attract capital. That shouldn't be a problem. And I think if you're a good developer, you should handle tech.
00:51:53.333 - 00:52:24.981, Speaker B: That's no problem at all as well. Especially getting today all the tech stacks are getting I would say more or less similar. But the number of users compare different chains. Indeed has a gaps, right. And obviously exchanges that huge advantage of having the most users. So you'd naturally see a lot more activity. So I don't think it's because like hey, I just want to lick the balls of Binance so that I'm building on top, right? There's some people will kind of see it like that and I think there's a very superficial way to kind of understand it.
00:52:24.981 - 00:52:41.075, Speaker B: Like you know, the way I look at this building on top is because they just can't give my. Give my more user to my product. You can help me test my product market fit better so you know, why not, right? So you're definitely open minded to audit potentials, right?
00:52:41.735 - 00:53:11.121, Speaker A: Okay, I'm going to do a interesting thing maybe where I want you to help me with Blockworks strategy like live on the podcast. So we're a very western based media company and know we have different. We have like three parts of our business, right? We've got, we've got the. The media business. Own the largest podcast network in the industry. Newsletters own the largest newsletter network in the industry. We have big news team, right? So that's media business.
00:53:11.121 - 00:53:44.303, Speaker A: Then we have a conference business, right? We have two conference firms, Permissionless Digital Asset Summit. Permissionless in the US Digital Asset Summit in London and New York and then we have a research and Data platform where 90% of our customers are in. Are in the U.S. okay, if you are sitting in my shoes, there's this whole bucket of people and potential customers and sponsors for the media business and audience for the media business and big conferences to be built in Asia. Is it worth doing something in Asia or not? If you were in my.
00:53:44.479 - 00:54:13.963, Speaker B: I think it's totally worth it like, honestly, I think in terms of media and everything, America definitely has an advantage. The size of business is much bigger and the revenue dollar is bigger. The level, I would say sophistication is higher. And it's not like I'm looking. It's not that I'm saying the Asian player, not great. It's just the industry nature and. But there is a lot of audience here.
00:54:13.963 - 00:54:50.509, Speaker B: And honestly, as a founder, like what I saw even for myself or for other people, like historically I would say, you know, it's very hard for Asian founders or Asia players to get access to Western media or international media. But it is not the case for, let's say web2 or in finance. In finance, like people in Hong Kong who go to work, they read Wall Street Journal, they read Financial Time, Those are the things on the desk. They don't read like local. There's no local version of Wall Street Journal, right. So they still go to WSJ, they still go to ft. So it's largely the same, I would say.
00:54:50.509 - 00:55:22.655, Speaker B: So the way I look at it is like if your quality of content is good, people is going to get naturally attracted to it. It's just like you probably need to have probably, let's say two to three key elements. First of all, you probably need to have localization of language, right? Because, you know, a lot of this, you know, Asia is not one language as well, right? Like, yeah, Chinese probably is the largest, you know, I would say populations or a lot, you have the most speaking populations. But there is, for example, In Vietnam, there's 100 million people there. You know, they speak their local language. In Thailand's different, Korea is different. So you got to pick out a few key markets.
00:55:22.655 - 00:56:04.765, Speaker B: You know, you need to make sure your content got translated because otherwise most people cannot access or understand. So they're missing out on Your great content, MBappe Pod on your website, et cetera. And so localization is important. And you also probably want to have some of the local interviews and exclusives and et cetera and programming. And the second part is, you know, I think conference is definitely, you know, something that's very interesting as well. It's like historically when you see a lot of probably, except 2049, I would say a lot of conferences tend to be more localized there. Less where, less conference where it's truly, truly east meets west, right? It's either a lot more dominant representation from west or it's other way around.
00:56:04.765 - 00:56:47.805, Speaker B: So I think there's a unique market there. So you can potentially, let's say Bring permissionless to Singapore, to Hong Kong, to all these places. And I do think there's enough room for multiple players. And also I think the third part is the union also need local, local partners too in each of the different market need different local partners. And I think that's also a generic rule that applies for other businesses as well is if you decide to come into Asia, you better not be something that's half asked. You better be something that you take it seriously. And if a local partner who can navigate those terrains and navigate who should work with and how to cut through the trays so you save a lot of time, you don't hit a wall as much, you come much better result immediately.
00:56:47.805 - 00:57:16.001, Speaker B: You talk to the right key decision makers. So yeah, but in general, I think in your case it's easy because you got a killer product, you got a killer brand, you get killer content that everyone love. So it's easy. And I think it's very funny. It's like if you come to, I think next week when you come to Singapore, you realize on the street how many people were able to spot you and just say, hey Jason, I'm a big fan of yours. And this is a generic phenomena. So it's very funny.
00:57:16.001 - 00:57:44.525, Speaker B: So last year during the F1 weekend, Post Mal is Post Malone's first trip into Asia and his manager Austin Rosen is a friend. So, so we help organize some after party, we hang out, etc, and it's the first trip and they're like, oh my God, I didn't know I have that many fans in Asia. It was his first Asian tour and there's so much love. It's like, you know, here actually quite international. They actually look at international content. There's actually fan base out here, but you might not just know. So, so I think, I think it's, it's funny.
00:57:44.525 - 00:57:45.941, Speaker B: You, you might see those reactions.
00:57:46.053 - 00:57:50.105, Speaker A: So what you're, what you're saying is I'm a lot like Post Malone basically.
00:57:52.285 - 00:57:53.425, Speaker B: In crypto.
00:57:54.805 - 00:58:24.647, Speaker A: Okay, tell me about how the event scene is different. Like it feels like. Okay, so you were telling me. So I think, can I share the numbers of your event next week? Like you've got this, you've got this event. So Alan and EVG are hosting an event with Bear Chain and there's, it's like, I mean it just came up as like an Illuma event and there are 7,000 people registered to attend. There's going to be over 10,000 people at this thing. And it's, I mean it's this, it's like the massive kickoff party for, for the week obviously.
00:58:24.647 - 00:58:56.799, Speaker A: But like getting 10,000 people to a party in the U.S. i mean that, I mean it just doesn't happen actually. Like it just does. It literally doesn't exist. So why does that dynamic exist? Like it feels like, I mean maybe it's just there's just a sheer number of people, but it does feel like there's a difference in almost economics of events there too. Like people don't really buy as many tickets it looks like, but it's all extremely sponsorship based. So maybe just tell us about and tell and educate me on like how conferences and events are different in Asia versus in the U.S.
00:58:56.799 - 00:58:57.959, Speaker A: yeah, I think.
00:58:58.007 - 00:59:22.857, Speaker B: Here is like for example, next week. Let me give you another figure that's astonishing which is there is already over 700 side events this week. It was absolutely insane. So there's seven days if you deduct the last two day for F1, whatever. It's literally over 100 side events a day. On some of the days I actually got seven overlapping dinners. Yeah, my big brothers.
00:59:22.857 - 00:59:49.729, Speaker B: Right. So I have to literally show off for 10 minutes, shake hands and move on to the next one. It's like next week is complete is going to be a little bit chaotic. But I also think it's a lot of love. I mean, you know, it shows just how many people care about this industry and many people like pre booked at their flight, pre booked at a hotel and everything. Six months, seven months ago like we have to secure. Secured a vanu marquee like seven months ago and it was just like.
00:59:49.729 - 01:00:00.663, Speaker B: And next week it's not just us hosting great things. Right. Like your Arthur is hosting great things. Many other. Justin is hosting great thing on Wednesday, others. I think Arthur is hosting something on Thursday and Friday. Right.
01:00:00.663 - 01:00:23.325, Speaker B: I think it's going to be amazing, amazing week and yeah and I think but you can definitely tell like there is a lot of players and many people hosting multiple events as well. And they're all supporting each other, they're putting logos on each other and I think it's like honestly the market last couple of months, you know what was in the best I would say and this is.
01:00:24.505 - 01:00:41.521, Speaker A: So tell me about the economics of these things. Like is it fair to say that people don't really not, not just the side events but let's say block works. Let's say block works and evg we're hosting a conference and we're like all right, we're going to Hong Kong or Singapore or something right now we make you know, maybe half our money comes from tickets, half comes from sponsorships.
01:00:41.633 - 01:00:42.017, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:00:42.081 - 01:00:44.605, Speaker A: Tell me how you would recommend we set up an event.
01:00:44.985 - 01:01:09.261, Speaker B: I think you have a lot more like dominant percentage from sponsorship from. From other type of things. Yeah, I think ticket will be slightly less like you try not to actually charge people that much for ticket. Obviously you will have ticket like even KBW or Asia Blockchain Summit, they all have tickets. Also when a firm reach out, you have to give them tickets. You don't turn your friends away and say, yo man, go buy yourself. Right.
01:01:09.261 - 01:01:50.065, Speaker B: So ultimately you're going to give out tickets. But, but, but I think if you attract a crowd, there is many other business models you can possibly slap on it and then, and I think there is enough also sponsorship opportunity as well. A lot of people will be looking for exposures. And also I think the good thing is the government is also really keen. For example, Hong Kong government, I can't say for Singapore government. Hong government has multiple funds from tourism boards from other bureaus where they incentivize people to hold great international events in Hong Kong and Web3 because it's an industry that the government encouraged. So they also give out like averaging maybe like $2 million to support great events.
01:01:50.065 - 01:02:07.449, Speaker B: Right. So they will also cover some of the costs. And then the good thing is that you can also negotiate with venues and other to kind of like, you know, make your P and L better. So I think there's great opportunity and the most important thing is you get an impact. You get even for the first year, you don't make that much money. You make the impact.
01:02:07.577 - 01:02:23.415, Speaker A: Yeah. Cool. Alan, what else are we missing? What else is interesting maybe that people don't understand yet and, but I, for, for people listening who don't, who aren't watching on YouTube. It's also midnight for Alan right now, so I do appreciate you joining late.
01:02:25.155 - 01:03:02.575, Speaker B: I think one maybe final look is finder notes is like very funny. It's like recently when a product got launched and some of the Twitter community is saying certain things about it and other people saying something certain thing about it. And I think one thing that definitely come to mind is like, you know, a lot of people talking about like we want to bring a billion user to our industry. And I think in the, you know, sometime I think this not just exists in east and west, but I think it's more obvious in the West. Some of the Western users will be like, hey, this is the way I think adoption should happen. Like the rest of the billion people should be more like me, they should be more crypto native. They should know how to do on chain.
01:03:02.575 - 01:03:39.859, Speaker B: They should be one of our crypto bureaus. But I think you look at Asia, the funny thing is I think the adoption is probably that a billion people, that mass adoption will come in forms that probably is not your way. It's going to come in a different way, form and ship, right? Which is like, maybe we need to dumb it down. Maybe we need to adapt to that as well. Maybe they're going to take the tools and infrastructure that were reinvented into their own hands and give it their own spin, right? And I think that is like a real reality where people are going to compose in their own ways. And I think Asia has a lot of teams and a lot of people willing to experiment. And I think it could be interesting.
01:03:39.859 - 01:03:46.455, Speaker B: Like, I wrote an article recently about the Asia Torah and I think maybe next year we'll have like an Asia Phi season coming.
01:03:47.275 - 01:03:57.107, Speaker A: I like it, man. Great article. We'll link the article, by the way, in the. In the show notes of this episode for people who want to. Who want to read it. Okay, let's wrap with this in. I want to get.
01:03:57.107 - 01:04:14.399, Speaker A: This is going to. This last one will sound weird to you. Apps to download, food to eat and clothes to wear. So if someone, if I have a friend who comes to New York, you know, I say, who's maybe from. From. From Hong Kong or something, I'll be like, okay, everyone. And usually they already know this, but it's like, okay, you gotta get around with.
01:04:14.399 - 01:04:24.235, Speaker A: With Uber, right? We got Doordash if you want to get food. We got Google Maps if you want to get around. What are the apps that you use on a daily basis?
01:04:24.695 - 01:04:29.725, Speaker B: Yeah, you mean Hong Kong or when they go to Singapore next week?
01:04:30.265 - 01:04:31.761, Speaker A: Both, actually. I'm curious about both.
01:04:31.833 - 01:04:40.681, Speaker B: Okay. For Singapore next week, download your grab. You need that for. Because it's F1 weekend. F1 week. So all the roads are going to get blocked. It's kind of messy going around.
01:04:40.681 - 01:05:01.265, Speaker B: So download your grab just like the Uber equivalent, but also in grab. You can also order the food just like Uber too. So when you're hungry at midnight, that's going to help you out. And then definitely go try the spicy crab. Definitely go try the laksa. Definitely go try those. One of the Haka centers, which is like the, you know, very cheap but delicious food that is always opened.
01:05:01.265 - 01:05:06.405, Speaker B: And then so I think, yeah, there's Singapore. And then what was the food you said?
01:05:06.445 - 01:05:11.173, Speaker A: Spicy crab, the chicken. What was the third One the Latza.
01:05:11.309 - 01:05:36.815, Speaker B: So basically they have this construct called Haka center which is a little bit like a food court and then where they have all the delicious like small store within it, there's usually 30, 40 of them and try different things for really, really cheap. Like for $20 you got. Oh my God. Amazing, amazing meals. So as usually try this local stuff out and then just wear a short because it's going to be hot next week.
01:05:37.995 - 01:05:46.655, Speaker A: That's what I was going to ask. So people, so for the, for the, the, the dress code, right? Is it, is it nice? Is it people are wearing shorts, are they wearing pants? Are they wearing jeans?
01:05:47.085 - 01:05:59.021, Speaker B: Yeah, I think in Singapore definitely just, just usually imagine it's hot, right? So, so yeah, whatever. You were in Palm beach probably that's the better idea. And it rings a lot. So cool.
01:05:59.213 - 01:06:29.507, Speaker A: Well, people are gonna be on the flight saying crap, I didn't bring any shorts. But this is now Alan, this is great man. I really appreciate you coming on. And we didn't even talk about OpenSocial at all. But you know, I had a tweet that's you know Santia, I don't know if you caught the Empire episode last week, but Santi and I talked a lot about OpenSocial which you're also building, competing with folks like and not even competing but kind of just learning from what Lens and Farcaster have done and doing it a little bit differently as well. And I would highly recommend people go check out OpenSocial. I'm sure we'll do an episode with you on that at some point in the future.
01:06:29.507 - 01:06:34.627, Speaker A: So yeah, thanks for all the advice for us Westerners going to going to Asia next week.
01:06:34.771 - 01:06:45.511, Speaker B: No, no, no. Thanks for show anyone in town like, you know, like you said, if anything we can help you off. Feel free to DMS and yeah, we'll love to, love to be your host.
01:06:45.623 - 01:07:06.215, Speaker A: Amazing. Amazing. Thanks for watching today's episode. Just wanted to quickly mention that the wait for Crypto's killer app wave is nearly over.
