Empire, we have Santiago, the skier, back with us. Santiago is debating whether or not to be a professional investor, professional, a podcaster, or a recent professional skier. So, Santi, good to have you back with us.
00:00:33.398 - 00:00:56.132, Speaker B: Well, it's like what they say, right? If you're a triathlete, you're never good at any of the three disciplines. You're just kind of meh in all three. So I am having an identity crisis. I know I'm not a good skier. I know I'm a terrible investor. And as far as podcasting goes, well, it really does hang in the balance, and it will depend on the YouTube comments. So, folks, please guide me in the right direction, and I will make a life choice.
00:00:56.188 - 00:00:59.064, Speaker A: Have you, Santa, do you watch the office?
00:00:59.404 - 00:01:00.664, Speaker B: Oh, I love the office.
00:01:00.964 - 00:01:01.468, Speaker A: The office.
00:01:01.516 - 00:01:06.828, Speaker B: And I started watching modern family, which is also much like the office. So, anyways, yeah, I love the office.
00:01:06.996 - 00:01:35.466, Speaker A: Yeah, modern family's good. So I'm watching the office actually, for the first time, because basically, half of the things that Mike says are references from the office. And I'm on season nine, which I think is the last season, and Andy. So they basically just released the. But, like, the trailer for the office show, and all the people in the office are watching it. And Andy is reading the YouTube comments, and he's like, you know, there's one commenter who's like, andy, you're bad at playing the banjo. And I'm like, oh, my God, that's Santi and me.
00:01:35.466 - 00:01:41.314, Speaker A: We get, like, 200 nice comments on YouTube, and then we're like, who is this guy? Yeah, yeah.
00:01:41.354 - 00:01:41.586, Speaker B: Tree.
00:01:41.610 - 00:01:45.334, Speaker A: There is one for seven saying that we don't know what we're talking about.
00:01:46.154 - 00:02:15.294, Speaker B: Shout out to all the people that keep us grounded and honest about this. There are a few that have hit home. And as they say, you know, if it really hits home, then you got to work on it. And someone, I think in the very early days of Empire, saying, God, this guy really rambles. And I think it was a terror episode, actually. It's like something should just let Doe talk a lot. I was like, well, I don't know if this is a terra lunatic or I'm wrong, and I do think that I ramble still, but I made a point not to ramble as much.
00:02:15.294 - 00:02:16.838, Speaker B: So, anyways, thank you.
00:02:16.886 - 00:02:18.394, Speaker A: I remember that. I remember that.
00:02:19.814 - 00:02:22.154, Speaker B: I called you on a Sunday. I got housekeeping.
00:02:24.254 - 00:02:25.534, Speaker A: Exactly. Exactly.
00:02:25.574 - 00:02:26.430, Speaker B: So you know it's real.
00:02:26.542 - 00:02:36.094, Speaker A: I'd be lying if I said I didn't do the same with you at some point. So. Yeah. Yeah. All right. We got to do some housekeeping. One is a big shout out to just everyone who listens.
00:02:36.094 - 00:03:04.000, Speaker A: We had a record quarter in Q, one for listens and for downloads, record march as well. Just biggest month ever for Empire. So big shout out to everyone who listens. We have decided to move the show to Tuesdays instead of Mondays. So the guest episodes are going to come out on Tuesdays now instead of Mondays. Small switch, but if you noticed the last two episodes, guest episodes with Kane and with Rob Leshner both came out on Tuesday. We're going to keep that moving forward.
00:03:04.000 - 00:03:21.330, Speaker A: We found that folks like that. More other updates is we have some new permissionless speakers. Permissionless keeps. Prices go up every two weeks. Your permissionless ticket, if you haven't already. I feel like I'm forgetting some stuff, but I think, I think that's good for this week. So it's nftnyc.
00:03:21.330 - 00:03:29.490, Speaker A: It's booming in New York. It's 80 and sunny this week. Horror ring says I'm the worst sleep I've gotten in like six months, apparently.
00:03:29.562 - 00:03:51.410, Speaker B: So that is because of the crisis and the fighting around Ethereum unlocking. But tell me more about NFt NYC. I heard you post that it was booming. And I was like, and you said, what bear market? And my question to you was, well, if it's booming, you know, is it really a bear market? Have we ever, have we really been in a bear market in the NFT land? So, yeah. Tell us more about how that went.
00:03:51.602 - 00:04:10.046, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's booming in the sense that. So, yeah, I went to a bunch of good events, went to an arbitrum event last night, went to there's like an Andreessen Horowitz hosted a good event. Collab currency did a good event. We did something with open sea and doodles on Tuesday night.
00:04:10.230 - 00:04:17.974, Speaker B: Okay, who's like, attending this conference, would you say? It's like a lot of artists, a lot of NFT, like, are you seeing the board?
00:04:18.014 - 00:04:48.214, Speaker A: A contingency that's the interesting thing is like, no, honestly, Santi, there's no NFT talk. And like, I'm, I got to approach, I got a, I'm a little biased because I'm probably, I'm not that deep in the, like, NFt crowd, but I would say there's no NFT talk. There is, I mean, there are like no nfts on the walls. I haven't seen one nft in all of NFt NYC. There's no nfts on the walls. Haven't seen one person wearing a board, ape, sweatshirt or a hoodie.
00:04:48.514 - 00:04:49.274, Speaker B: Oh, wow.
00:04:49.394 - 00:05:01.274, Speaker A: Honestly, it's just a lot of talk about like, l two s mev scaling. What's going on with Solana and Cosmos? Can they compete with e people are talking about?
00:05:01.434 - 00:05:05.614, Speaker B: Is it chatter around other use cases of nfts?
00:05:06.674 - 00:05:47.838, Speaker A: Or is it just purely, yeah, actually there is. Yeah. I had some really interesting conversations with folks yesterday about, um, like some big fashion houses. Met some folks from, I think they're probably the biggest fashion house in the world. They're really, really excited about nfts and like, digital fashion. They kind of painted this picture of a world where, um, you know, every website where you'll go to everything from like nike to gucci to louie, and you'll go on the website and there'll be a digital section and had like a really interesting conversation with them. And, you know, when you, when you basically hit the website, like, let's, this is the world that they envision is you go to the, you go to the nike website and there's a digital section.
00:05:47.838 - 00:06:25.232, Speaker A: Or there's kind of two versions of this. One is you go to the nike website, there's no digital section. All you have is like the normal nike store. You buy your jordan, you log in with your metamask or, you know, with your crypto wallet, you, but you buy your jordans and then when you check out Nike actually just airdrops you a digital pair of those Jordans. That's like, and then you can take those Jordans and wear them in whatever, like, you know, game that's built on, that's built on crypto rails. You can take them into the game. So that's like version one, version two that they're excited about is you actually, people end up spending more money on their digital self than they do their physical self.
00:06:25.232 - 00:06:54.372, Speaker A: And that's the world I think a lot of them are betting on is that, you know, if you probably talk to you or you, you know, probably, I'm in this bucket too. Like, I'm, I'm probably not someone who's gonna spend more on my digital self than my actually, honestly, I, maybe, I mean, yeah, but anyways, but like, they're, they're betting on a world where you, yeah, you go to Louie's website and there's like, or Gucci's website, and you've got your, like, normal Gucci store, and then you click the digital section and there's like, just digital goods that you can purchase.
00:06:54.468 - 00:07:30.714, Speaker B: So, yeah, I mean, this was my thesis early on. Like, I fundamentally think that, like, when I was a parafy, we obviously were big on Defi. But then my definition of Defi is like, you're transferring value and an NFT is a transfer of value. And so I sort of bucket that. I mean, of course, you could talk about non art use cases for NFTs, insurance contracts, real estate, property, like, being tokenized and represented as an NFT. But I think that's like real world assets, all that stuff. But just that use case that you just described, I think will be probably the biggest that in the next, like two years.
00:07:30.714 - 00:08:15.570, Speaker B: That is probably the use case. That is the killer use case for nfts. And I haven't seen, when you talk about throughout this bear market, we've seen like, Tiffany rollout for, you know, a special kind of edition for punks. You've seen other, like, adidas collaborate with Gee money, which is like a, you know, prominent NFT figure. There's, there's a number of, like, we had, of course, that episode with Camila and one of her coworker or colleagues talk about how brands are thinking about nfts. And the question that we asked them was, hey, is all this, like, implosion of, you know, FTX and Terra and regulatory stuff really holding these brands back? And I think what I heard was, no, not really. I mean, they've been on this journey for a long time.
00:08:15.570 - 00:08:47.752, Speaker B: I think marketers really realize the bullish case for nfts is people are spending more time online and they want to. When you think about, you open your wardrobe, you see a lot of stuff. You open your digital wardrobe, there's not much there. And the reason there's not much there is because you couldn't have digital property. And just to kind of close this loop out is this has been my approach. I spent the last week with, there's a few execs in the beverage industry, especially from coke. I said, guys, envision this world.
00:08:47.752 - 00:09:17.620, Speaker B: And he actually ran marketing for Olive coke for a number of years. And I pitched him on nfts. He, sorry, retired. And I said, do you not see this world? And then I kind of explained flow QR code. I'm in a stadium. You give me a particular image of coke and of the World cup or a particular event, and then you know, everything about that consumer and of course, it's just like, whoa. He's like, well, what about privacy? And I said, yeah, that's, I think, the elephant in the room, privacy.
00:09:17.620 - 00:09:35.104, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. But I think it's going to come much faster than most people appreciate. Like, there's, I'm waiting for that huge marketing convention when all these people all of a sudden say, oh, wow, like Nike's doing it. If you're Adidas, you're at a huge disadvantage all of a sudden. And then it just, yeah, really spirals from there.
00:09:36.484 - 00:10:18.620, Speaker A: Exactly. I mean, the two, I would say the two things that people are talking about with NFTs are this week, or at least the folks I've been meeting, which is probably sample size, very small. Sample size is much less JPEG conversation and much more digital fashion. And then like, loyalty programs, I would say those are the two, like, basically just the ability to have a loyalty program that not just like, kind of tracks you around, like, what your activity is, but actually your financial activity now for the first time. So that's, uh, yeah, I think that's what people are excited about. So, I mean, people aren't talking about jpegs because, you know, the price of doodles is like 2.7 ETH right now.
00:10:18.620 - 00:10:20.988, Speaker A: Um, like they're just not ripping.
00:10:21.076 - 00:11:06.384, Speaker B: So. Yeah, that's the thing that you mentioned just now, which is so true. Um, when we think about the use, we're going to talk about ETH, obviously, this has been kind of, we think about, there's not been a lot of news recently, but ETH is kind of front and center. And I think fundamentally, when you think about nfts, most of them are denominated in ETH terms. And it's interesting from a psychological perspective, from a consumer standpoint, it's very different to tell someone, hey, spend 1002, you know, one ETH on or 0.25 ETH on something versus, you know, I'll just drop, you know, $200, $300. It's like, when you think in ETH terms, it's not as, is not as like it's easier to win the argument.
00:11:06.384 - 00:12:13.414, Speaker B: Right. When you think about like, oh, buy this NFT, that's going to give you access to a game that's going to launch in two years. For that same price of that mint, you could go out and buy a PlayStation four or what is it, PlayStation five? And, but most people don't think, like, the psychology around that is interesting. And so it further reinforces kind of the use case of you holding ETH, using ETH, you remember way back in the day, in like 2017, the arguments around the velocity, what is it? MV equals PQ, kind of like how we think about the sustainability of token prices. And velocity was a huge component around that, underlying that. Is, is there any reason for people, once they earn something, to hold onto it? And ETH, I think just, you know, I understand bitcoin brought, for all the crowd that's listening right now, bitcoin has ripped, what, 100% now, since the bottom Ethereum has lagged, it's up like 65, 70%. A lot of it is macro inflation related, and I believe, but long term, if you kind of like zoom out and say, what really drives value, I think is utility, not scarcity.
00:12:13.414 - 00:12:47.264, Speaker B: And I think that will probably be the biggest thing that some people may have gotten wrong in investing in this asset class where you're so focused on, on scarcity, because thats a meme. Thats what we think about when we think about gold and value and some collectibles and whatnot. But by and large, thats like a small subset of the worlds, I think, economy. Most of the value in the stock market or companies just provide incredible value. And I see that happening more on Ethereum, probabilistically than any other kind of layer, one, if you will, as a settlement layer.
00:12:48.104 - 00:12:56.336, Speaker A: So let's talk, let's talk about ETH. Let's talk about ETH. By the way, MV equals PQ. Haven't heard that. Was that a, was that a Berniske 2017 valuation reference right there?
00:12:56.400 - 00:12:59.984, Speaker B: Him and Chris Pepper from XKKR.
00:13:00.024 - 00:13:01.324, Speaker A: Guys. No, John. John.
00:13:02.264 - 00:13:04.056, Speaker B: Yeah, John. Yeah, yeah.
00:13:04.160 - 00:13:21.374, Speaker A: I remember that. That, like big old PDF. I remember when I was working at the venture firm, I was like, look, guys, crypto is a real thing. There's this guy, and he wrote a PDF about this, and it's the institutional investors take on crypto assets didn't help very much.
00:13:22.754 - 00:13:30.426, Speaker B: I thought it helped a lot. At least I could tell you that was. Most people have read that in Wall street than the bitcoin white paper.
00:13:30.570 - 00:13:33.722, Speaker A: Yeah, that's true. All right, let's talk about, let's talk about Chappelle, huh?
00:13:33.858 - 00:13:35.658, Speaker B: Let's do it. Do you want to walk us through it?
00:13:35.706 - 00:14:10.618, Speaker A: Yeah, let's just start by saying kamikaze. I'm sorry. If you're listening to this, it seems that you are not, not right about this one, my friend, but better luck next time. So the TLDR here is that. Yeah, so Schappella is just kind of collectively mashed together two words, Shanghai and capella. Upgrades basically what it does is it enables unstaking for the first time since ETH staking was introduced in December of 2020. So if you remember, the Ethereum merge from a little bit ago, transitioned the network from proof of work to proof of stake.
00:14:10.618 - 00:14:56.190, Speaker A: And that happened about six months ago, in September 2020. But for the last six months, users still weren't able to unstake their ETH. The validators had been able to do things, but there was really no mechanism by which previously staked ETH could be withdrawn. So this shapella upgrade was what it did is it officially transitioned us to proof of stake and it enabled this end to end unstaking flow. And so, like yesterday, what happened is. Or no, I think a month ago we completed the girly public testnet upgrade. And this was kind of like the last month, like the final trial before enabling unstaking on Mainnet and the big fuD.
00:14:56.190 - 00:15:14.904, Speaker A: And the reason I was giving Comcast some shit there is because the bear case on ETH was that there was going to be this huge unstaking event and it was going to be a big liquidity event and a large portion of people were going to, were going to unstake their ETH. And those people have been.
00:15:16.684 - 00:15:43.918, Speaker B: Just to put numbers on this is like roughly 50% of our ETH is staked, right? And so that translated into if ETH has a market cap to 40 billion right now, that was what? 30,000,000,035, 36 billion, that was potentially up for, you know, to be absorbed in the market somehow. Yep. Yeah. So I mean, assuming. Assuming everyone withdrew super quickly, which was not going to be like the case. Right. But anyways, yeah, well, there's a staking.
00:15:43.966 - 00:16:17.188, Speaker A: Queue and we can talk about that. And I'm giving Comic Con shit, but like, we should actually honestly see how this week, and probably a little bit early into next week plays out. I wouldn't be, I don't want to dance on any graves yet because there, there's still a little time because there's this staking queue. But like, I think, yeah, big summary is like massive success. I remember in 2017, people were talking about how proof of stake was coming maybe that year or maybe in 2018. Obviously it took a little longer than expected, but yeah, just huge. I mean, proof of stake is finally complete on Ethereum.
00:16:17.188 - 00:16:43.366, Speaker A: Massive congrats to everyone who worked on this, if you remember the merge. I mean, I remember sitting on Twitter being like, is this going to work? Is this technically going to go through? And I think it's a huge testament to everyone who works on Ethereum that, I don't know, this kind of just felt like a nothing burger event. Like, it felt. It felt like, I don't know, I wasn't really like sitting on Twitter waiting for it to happen. Not many like threaders posting about it. Like kind of a. It felt like a small news event, even though it's so big.
00:16:43.366 - 00:17:12.364, Speaker A: And I think that's a big testament to the trust that we all have in the Ethereum developer community. And then on the asset side, like, yeah, it turned out to be a big, this whole ETH Chappella dump fudd was just a big nothing burger. And it turns out that now that staking works, people actually want to probably stake more ETH. It doesn't mean that they want to sell all their lockstaking. I don't know, just a huge ten. I would call this a big ten out of ten success for Ethereum.
00:17:13.424 - 00:17:40.493, Speaker B: Definitely de risk from a technical standpoint. Point number one, it really closes the loop on transition to purpose stake when you can easily stake and withdraw. So that's point number one. Point number two, I think the biggest, the biggest validator in the queue right now is Kraken. People should remember that Kraken has to do this for regulatory reasons. They, I believe they settled with the SEC recently under staking program. It may be related to this.
00:17:40.493 - 00:18:15.666, Speaker B: I believe someone from Kraken can correct me here, but I sort of think that that's the case. And so, as it turns out, not everyone, it's a very small percentage of validators that are actually in the queue to withdraw. Kraken being the biggest one. It's like five, 6%, I believe, latest dashboard I saw. And you're absolutely right. I mean, I think there was a huge, people should remember way back, the discounted staked ETH derivatives had relative to the underlying ETH. And this was a big part in the kind of the duration mismatch, right.
00:18:15.666 - 00:19:15.130, Speaker B: The liquidity discounts, as you think about, you had to lock up your ETH, and it was very uncertain when this particular upgrade would happen. And so naturally the stake ETH derivatives would have some sort of discount, right, because you're locking it up. And now it's sort of, I think that you could read in one scenario, which I think is a more likely one, is that you're going to see a higher percentage of ETH being staked. And so I think it will be interesting to observe that number combined with what the staking reward rate is, to become quite interesting. I remember back in the day when people think about how new institutions have started to come into the asset class, this was like before the whole kind of bear market started. I started to notice a very meaningful shift in players coming into space saying, I don't want even. There were causes I wouldn't even talk about bitcoin.
00:19:15.130 - 00:19:37.636, Speaker B: It was just like, tell me about Ethereum. These are tech focused firms, a lot of hedge funds, like the tigers of the world, sovereign wealth funds, saying, it's interesting. Tell me more about this. We believe in this kind of being the Internet. The staking rate is super interesting. And they were spending a lot of time around the usability of ETH as an aspect that could be basically kind of like paying these dividends. Right.
00:19:37.636 - 00:20:12.294, Speaker B: And, like, it's an asset that you can compound. Right. Your staking rewards and do some interesting stuff with your staking rewards. And so, yeah, I think the biggest things that I'm looking at is, of course, as you said, over the next couple weeks, how do the withdrawal queue kind of, you know, happens? Like, how does that evolve? And are people restaking the shift from centralized staking players to perhaps decentralized, uh, options like Lido and rocket pool and some of the other players? Um, and. And what that does to the staking, um, rate, uh, the yield?
00:20:12.334 - 00:20:12.534, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:20:12.574 - 00:20:27.034, Speaker B: Right. And so I think those are kind of the things that I'm looking at. But nonetheless, I mean, huge success from a technical standpoint. And, and we'll see what I guess now the question is, what are people gonna flatten next on ethereum? Because, you know, it's coming, so we'll see.
00:20:30.004 - 00:20:45.140, Speaker A: Agree with all of that. I think one small correction is that I don't think Kraken is actually the biggest depositor right now. I think it's actually Celsius. No, I think it's actually Celsius, by the way. Okay, there's the. I think. I think the zero xeee.
00:20:45.140 - 00:20:51.284, Speaker A: I'm looking at the wallets right now, just in the queue, and there's this 10 xeee. I'm pretty sure that's a Celsius address.
00:20:51.364 - 00:21:00.604, Speaker B: It may be. I was looking at that when I. I went to sleep, and then I woke up and it may have been updated, but Kraken was in the queue. And it's or 400 million.
00:21:01.984 - 00:21:25.420, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, here's the other side of what we're saying is the price not dumping. The price was never going to dump. Right. Immediately after Shanghai, the 1.1 million rewards unlock over, like, five or six days, I think it is. And then the withdrawal queue. And the withdrawal queue is pretty limited right now.
00:21:25.420 - 00:21:31.804, Speaker A: So I think people, before dancing in celebration, I think it's, you know, we should probably give it a couple days.
00:21:31.844 - 00:21:32.236, Speaker B: But.
00:21:32.340 - 00:21:38.812, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean if we've got to like the end of the weekend and there's no dump, then I think it's a pretty successful nothing burger event.
00:21:38.908 - 00:22:11.936, Speaker B: Yeah, it's always, again, it's, it's sort of a interesting point because you always wonder like is your thesis right when you're investing? Is your thesis right? But then is your timing right or what do you know that the market doesn't know? And so I, it's like the, it's fairly interesting. I never try to do anything around these events candidly because it's kind of really, really hard to understand. Maybe, maybe all this kind of, you know, it was already priced in.
00:22:12.040 - 00:22:45.020, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I think, I think a lot of people in crypto who were like early in crypto got used to news like this actually not being priced in. But the more that crypto develops, the more that news like this is priced in. And I think we're seeing that this news was probably priced in. And also maybe my left bell curve take would just be that when in doubt, go to the left bell curve and left side of the bell curve. And the left bell curve take here was that if anyone is staking ETH, you probably really like ETH and you're probably like a big ETH head and you're not going to sell. Why would you sell your ETH right now? So.
00:22:45.132 - 00:23:19.064, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah. And one thing to another KPI, we'll probably should link to a few nice dashboards we've been looking at. But you know, on the unstaking component, you know, it's sort of like it's a skimming process. So it's not, it's sort of determined by the Ethereum network. So they're not all immediately available because you could make the argument if you're a big ETH holder, there are perhaps some strategies here that you're going to just stake your ethnicity, you're, you're going to hold on to the underlying, but you're going to be selling the rewards. So.
00:23:19.064 - 00:23:54.954, Speaker B: Because I think depending on your jurisdiction. But my understanding is there's a recent change in the IR's ruling around staking rewards and how those are going to be treated from a tax perspective. So if you like, you could envision a scenario where, you know, if you're a big institution or whale or even normal retail, you're staking you're not selling your ETH, but you are being. You need to cover a tax liability at some point on the rewards themselves. Right. And so that may, you know, over time, have some selling pressure on the reward itself. Right.
00:23:54.954 - 00:24:20.464, Speaker B: Some people might want to do arbitrage strategies where they're hedging Ethan, just capturing the reward. And, you know, this is no kind of similar between the GBTC kind of arb trade. Right. And so I'm sure there's a whole bunch of strategies that have come around, a whole other set of derivative products around staking rewards that are going to probably crop up. The first one being stake. These is just the first vanilla one. But there's so many others that I think, over the next couple of years will develop.
00:24:21.084 - 00:24:36.580, Speaker A: Yeah. By the way, on the tax side of things, I'm pretty sure the way it works is that the asset in, like, the value, the asset price going up is taxes, capital gains, and then the income that gets spit off from staking is taxes. Is taxes. Income. I think that's how.
00:24:36.612 - 00:25:07.628, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Income. I believe there's. We were actually a big part of this was something that we spent so much time, oh, back in 2018, and then that team ended up going out that the lawyer that I was working with, Evan, ended up going to coin bison trails and Coinbase. But the. That was a formation of the proof of stake alliance, and we hired this great professor from, I think, UVA that was tax authority on the matter to, like, really just kind of craft some tax policy around it. But I think there's been still not very clear.
00:25:07.628 - 00:25:11.544, Speaker B: I don't know. But anyways. Yeah, yeah.
00:25:11.924 - 00:25:32.920, Speaker A: All right, looking ahead. So Chappelle is live on the network. Withdrawals are being processed. Next major feature, I think, is EIP 4844. Right. As part of the Denkan network upgrade, which is hopefully a 2023 thing. And what this does is it increases the scalability of roll ups on ethereum.
00:25:32.920 - 00:25:35.844, Speaker A: So. Excited. Excited for that to come out, too.
00:25:36.384 - 00:25:43.644, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, definitely. Yeah. Anything else ethereum front that we should be covering?
00:25:50.104 - 00:25:51.964, Speaker A: No, I don't think so.
00:25:52.464 - 00:25:57.804, Speaker B: Yeah. We'll keep everyone posted and go ahead.
00:25:58.344 - 00:26:37.356, Speaker A: Yeah, we'll link to. There's, I think, the best dashboard. There's this metrica dashboard. We'll link it in the show notes.

So this was the first time that they spoke publicly about just like, FTX blowing up Solana getting hammered. Their fund got crushed pretty hard. I know you were one of the first investors in the multicoin, I don't know, fund one or fund two back in 2018 or 2019.
00:27:32.354 - 00:27:40.326, Speaker A: You've known those guys for a long time. They're troopers. They're smart, good contrarian investors. Any takeaways from that podcast?
00:27:40.430 - 00:28:15.278, Speaker B: Yeah, you know, I'll tell just a story of my relationship with multicoin. You know, I reached out to Kyle when I started reading his, his blog posts. You know, at the time, I didn't agree with everything. And then I met his partner, Tushar. And look, for me, I was investing, even at the time, heavily in the space. And so there's no real reason for me to kind of invest with a manager, unless I believe. And my thesis for these guys was, these guys are probably going to capture something that I don't as an investor, you don't want to miss major, major trends.
00:28:15.278 - 00:29:30.508, Speaker B: And lo and behold, I think they were very right on Solana. It took a while for that thesis to play out. You could argue that as much as there's been huge price fluctuations in all of crypto and their fund is down, perhaps for some LP's. That's what I liked about them. And look, I think there's always, like this thing that I've wondered, not just multicolored, specifically, we touched on this in the episode is people talk about being a contrarian investor, and I think Tushar said it very well, which is as a contrarian investor, being a contrarian for the sake of being a contrarian makes absolutely no sense because you make no money generally speaking, usually, unless you're right, of course, but you need to be a contrarian and also just fundamentally think, what am I seeing? What do I know that other people don't? It's like sort of the peel Thiel, the Peter Thiel construct, which is, what am I, what, what is non consensus today, which makes you a contrarian. But then you will be consensus over some period of time. And I say some period of time because that really also matters a lot in this space, particularly in this space, because you're structured as a hedge fund and your LP's might not be as patient.
00:29:30.508 - 00:30:08.632, Speaker B: Right? At the end of the day, a fund has some sort of life cycle, right? And if you could be right about a thesis in 200 years, but no one cares, you can be dead. Right? So as Mark, you know, as key said, you know, was it keen that said, you know, you could, you could stay, the market could stay irrational more than you can stay solvent or something like this. So, nonetheless, no, I think it's a great episode. Look, those guys have, like, it's not easy to be a fund manager, especially in crypto with all the volatility, and you could deliver great returns, and then, you know, it's. It's. It's a challenging environment. I mean, you have to.
00:30:08.632 - 00:30:35.726, Speaker B: It's not. We other hat, we had the other episode which was talking about, you know, setting up a fund. It makes really, compared to setting up a hedge fund and a venture fund in crypto, like, there's just so many other hoops and service providers and things that you need to be focused on. So, yeah, look, I mean, I sympathize with the guys to some extent. You know, they've gotten a lot of criticism over the years. You know, obviously, they're not afraid to be outspoken. But I will say, you know, when.
00:30:35.750 - 00:30:36.486, Speaker A: You talk to a lot of their.
00:30:36.510 - 00:31:20.594, Speaker B: Portfolio companies, they will say that they're perhaps one of the most helpful investors that we have on our cap table. So I still remember the last thing I'll say. I still remember one thing that really stuck with me that Kyle said in a prior empire episode was, he said, when we make an investment, one of the criteria that we ask ourselves is, if this guy calls me on a holiday vacation or Friday night or set over the weekend, am I gonna pause everything and kind of work with them? And so, yeah, I think it's. It speaks to kind of their MLM philosophy. And so, yeah, anyways, I thought it was a good episode. There's other. We.
00:31:20.594 - 00:31:59.078, Speaker B: There's an interesting discussion around kind of their thesis. I asked them, hey, what are the kind of major use cases that you envisioned going forward? Because we are in this state where people are kind of questioning the use cases of crypto. And he brought up, obviously, AI and crypto. And, you know, of course, a lot of people going to read into that and say, oh, you know, here we go. You know, but I think he goes through the kind of three use cases around kind of the combination of two that makes, candidly, some sense, and I think it's probably worth digging in deeper into future episodes. So, yeah, that's kind of my long take. I don't know what you think.
00:31:59.206 - 00:32:07.354, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I liked it. I mean, we asked him some tough questions on FTX.
00:32:08.094 - 00:32:08.574, Speaker B: We did.
00:32:08.614 - 00:32:52.692, Speaker A: I don't think they realized, felt that the big chunk of the first part was going to be focused so much on that. But no, that was a good episode. It's got me thinking about l two s. I mean, like, they're. I mean, they're like, really? I think it was Tushar who said, any l two, with its own token and decentralized governance, will eventually vote to become an l one because token holders are greedy and the market shows that l one's get a significant valuation premium. Also that l two s are not viable businesses. I think it's just like in a world where l two s are really hot right now, everyone's talking about arbitrum, optimism, all these kind of ZK roll ups and stuff like that.
00:32:52.692 - 00:32:58.100, Speaker A: It's just nice to. I disagree with Tushar here, but it's good to hear the other point of view.
00:32:58.292 - 00:33:43.210, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I've had really interesting intellectual discussions with these guys. I remember pitching them on Defi, and some of they reached out early on, and they had just a belief that it was not going to accrue much value or default was a thing, but how you invest in it was. We kind of disagreed on that. One of the things that they said about l two, which I think is an interesting kind of thing discussion to further have. Maybe we can invite Steven from Arbitrum and OpenSea guys and just them as well, and others, is this idea that an l two eventually bumps into the same issues of an l one from an architectural standpoint that, you know, particularly around the sequencer and kind of the leadership kind of round robin methodology. Right. Which is your.
00:33:43.210 - 00:33:48.894, Speaker B: Essentially, that was their argument. And which leads them, of course.
00:33:49.674 - 00:33:50.602, Speaker A: Go ahead.
00:33:50.778 - 00:34:07.112, Speaker B: Yeah. Which leads him to say Solana is just a fundamentally better architecture, more scalable, and you kind of. It's just a reference. You know it from first principles. Like, you could see Solana really kind of scaling versus l two s eventually reach this bottleneck.
00:34:07.168 - 00:34:07.496, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:34:07.560 - 00:34:15.844, Speaker B: That is no different than what you're seeing in l one context. Not. That was their take. I don't necessarily agree with that. But you were saying.
00:34:18.184 - 00:34:31.579, Speaker A: I actually do agree with it in a sense. What? Here's the. Here's that my blank. Bearish. Here's my, um. Here's what I think people are missing with l two s, is that just decentralizing the sequencer is a freaking. Like, it's so much harder than everyone realizes.
00:34:31.579 - 00:34:58.126, Speaker A: And like, I mean, let's take it back to the Chappella conversation. You remember these conversations in 2016 and 2017 where, like, proof of stake was coming next year. And lo and behold, proof of stake came, but it took four or five years longer than people realized. And I think that will be the l two version of that, is that decentralizing the sequencer doesn't take one year. That's like a. I don't know, we got to have the Astria or the espresso people on. But that's a four or five year thing, I think.
00:34:58.126 - 00:35:19.424, Speaker A: I think it's a really hard thing to do. That and the thing that could push people to decentralize the sequencer faster and really prioritize it is not efficiency of the network. It's not any actually product related thing. It's probably regulation will force people to decentralize the sequencer faster than they. They realize they need to.
00:35:20.604 - 00:36:00.756, Speaker B: Yeah. On those two points, one, we talked about base to some extent, and I think they were interested in that as much as they are not very particularly bullish on l two s. Pretty much everyone we've talked to at this point is of the mind that base, which is Coinbase l two project, is very bullish with space from an onboarding perspective. So that was point number one. Point number two is I asked him about a fairly controversial take that he's had, which is, and this is Kyle. He tweeted something, which is he doesn't care as much, he doesn't prioritize security as much as other things right now. And I asked him that.
00:36:00.756 - 00:36:36.568, Speaker B: I said, well, because obviously, I fundamentally believe that security is the most important thing. Otherwise, there is no reason why you should be in this space. We can't get security right, then none of this matters. The immutability properties, the censorship kind of resistance properties. I feel like security is the most important thing. Focusing on security, to your point around why it takes so long to ship infrastructure. And crypto is getting security right is a very hard thing, and not compromising on security, which, by the way, security means a lot of things to different people.
00:36:36.568 - 00:37:47.584, Speaker B: But when I think about security is, do you have the properties of immutability, of that the network's fundamentally secure? You can look at the Nakamoto consensus, you could look at the validator set. This idea of can the network be attacked? Why? Because when you have value on chain, you want to make sure that it's secure. When you do transfers, when you're interacting with these protocols, that they're secure. It's a lot of things, right? But fundamentally, I think bitcoin is, when we think about the pecking order, like, bitcoin's the most secure because the most Lindy effect, it's been around for a while, and then ethereum, second of that, and then everything else kind of is still in progress, right? We talked about reorgs, which you could argue that there's a process, and it's like, sometimes reorgs are blown out of proportion. But I fundamentally, this is just my personal opinion. When I see that, it gives me pause to interact in a network that consistently has rehearse, not just Solana, you have polygon, you have others that have this issue. It slowed down, it's a massive restart to the network, and it could cause wreak, really, a lot of havoc across Defi and some other places.
00:37:47.584 - 00:38:23.744, Speaker B: Ethereum just doesn't have that. Ethereum used to have that back in the day. People forget. So all I'm trying to say with this take is, look, I think that it's going to be pretty interesting, because if you look over the last ten years, people can say, look, well, Ethereum also had this problem, right, of real works, and it took so long to ship. But I think the benefit that Ethereum had was there was not really much competition around at that time. And it really kind of solidified the mindshare with the being kind of the primary funding mechanism with icos. And then people just sort of stuck building on Ethereum, for better or for worse.
00:38:23.744 - 00:39:34.278, Speaker B: Now, of course, you have all these competing l one, and you're wondering Tushar, and said, well, over a 510 year horizon, people are going to talk about Solana and some of these other networks, and bitcoin has a head start on Ethereum, and it was like a seven year head start. That gap over time is negligible. It doesn't really matter, right? But I think it's subtle. But I think Ethereum continues to be the dominant mind share. It has continuously shipped, and I believe that perhaps some people are really stuck on this idea that it has been a slow organization, it has been slow to upgrade. The roadmap has been super delayed at times. But I think that this particular upgrade is a new era in the Ethereum development cycle where you're going to see faster cycles, more precise, and just give greater confidence of as an investor, as a user, as a developer, you really pay attention to, which is the execution risk, the infrastructure risk that a network has.
00:39:34.278 - 00:40:23.344, Speaker B: And of course, people may read into this and say I'm biased. Most of my projects that I'm an investor on are based on Ethereum, and I think that needs to be the case. Developers just have greater certainty. That's not to say that Solana is dead, but still, I think that from an infrastructure standpoint, do you agree with partially that there's still so many things that need to be figured out on the scalability front and the attention will be on l two s and the sequencer? I think that's going to be a major trend as we think about narratives in this space. I think that will be really front and center because it ties into so many things, as you said, from a technical standpoint, from a scalability standpoint, and fundamentally also from a regulatory standpoint. So thats, I think, probably something that over the next 612 months is going to be a greater focus point in the industry.
00:40:24.124 - 00:40:55.478, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. I agree. Im much more bullish on Solana than you are. But I really like Solana. I think this new narrative of things that are only possible on Solana, Im excited by that. I think that Solana has this huge advantage of being able to see all the mistakes that Ethereum made and like get ahead of those mistakes, which I mean, I've seen for block works as someone who's like a little later into the media game, seeing the mistakes that a lot of early crypto media players made. Like, I've seen how valuable that can be for a competitor.
00:40:55.478 - 00:41:00.514, Speaker A: And so I don't know. I like Solana more than you do.
00:41:00.894 - 00:41:18.518, Speaker B: But I want to be, I want to be open here. I like Solana for that reason, as you said, because they're not afraid to try new stuff. To me, one of the things that I always point to to folks is look at the Solana phone, fundamentally, that kind of.
00:41:18.686 - 00:41:19.718, Speaker A: I played with it.
00:41:19.846 - 00:41:20.834, Speaker B: Oh, did you?
00:41:21.414 - 00:41:23.194, Speaker A: Well, maybe in a next episode.
00:41:25.774 - 00:41:34.754, Speaker B: Is there anything to do right now? Is or this like a first version of the smartphone that had slow Internet and no App Store. Or, like, the App Store was, like, very limited.
00:41:37.494 - 00:42:00.474, Speaker A: No, I mean, it's basically a Samsung Galaxy with a zero fee dappstore completely built in. So there's like. Yeah, I mean, imagine a Samsung Galaxy with a bunch of crypto native apps completely built in with really easy to use things like marinade and Orca and Phantom and things on Solana.
00:42:00.864 - 00:42:01.536, Speaker B: Okay.
00:42:01.640 - 00:42:02.280, Speaker A: It's pretty smooth.
00:42:02.312 - 00:42:27.724, Speaker B: Yeah. Look, I'm not. I'm not, like, I'm not a maxi. I'm just stating facts here in terms of my allocation historically has been heavily skewed towards ethereum based projects. But I've invested in other things. Like, you know, that I've been public about near Solana and Solana based projects. And, you know, I think I'm not of the mind that everyone's blocking Solana and billing elsewhere.
00:42:27.724 - 00:43:09.364, Speaker B: And this will be a true test of the resiliency of the Solana community and network, I think, you know, I find we've had Anatolian a number of times, and Ben as well, leaks BD and so, you know, I. It's very difficult to be in their position because I think they get disproportionate amount of shit in the industry. Right. Kind of like coinbase, but we need these kind of folks to, like, really push different kind of solutions. Right. Because if you. I believe that we're so early from a infrastructure phase still, this asset class, that you need to try a lot of other, you know, design choices for the space.
00:43:09.364 - 00:43:37.320, Speaker B: Unfortunately, you can't really. What I will disagree with, Kyle, is you can't move fast and break things, because moving fast and breaking things in crypto is not the same as moving fast and breaking things in web two land. Like, it's. The pain is much like the damage is much more real, I guess, when people lose their funds or protocol gets hacked and whatnot. So that's the only thing that I'm cautious around.
00:43:37.432 - 00:43:49.774, Speaker A: Let's talk about. I just want to get your thoughts on bitcoin. So bitcoin's over thirty k, and ETH is over two k. Bitcoins up 9% in the last week. ETH is up 8%.
00:43:51.754 - 00:43:52.066, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:43:52.090 - 00:44:09.634, Speaker A: Bulls are back on parade. Curious how you're thinking about this. Are we coming out? Are we on the other side of the bear here? Are we going to go touch those? Is bitcoin going to hit 20k again? Are we going to see ETH down in the one k range again? How are you feeling about prices right now?
00:44:09.674 - 00:44:56.986, Speaker B: Well, as you know, there's a lot of noise in prices in the short term. I would argue that we probably bought them here and we bought them for a while now. You know, I have noticed that, you know, I started getting really excited about bitcoin, you know, last month and. Yeah, like probabilistically I probably think we see. So gun in my head, are we going to see, what are we going to see? 1st 40k bitcoin or 20k bitcoin? I think we see 40k. Are we going to see three Keith or one Keith? I think we see three Keith. But like probabilistically there's higher odds of seeing that.
00:44:56.986 - 00:45:27.762, Speaker B: There's obviously a number of things it could derail that. Right. And scenarios macro is still important, I think. But you know, there's some inflation data that came out yesterday that's not as, you know, not as bad. I don't know, I'm just kind of speculating here for entertainment purposes, I guess. But look, I feel very. The thing that gives me really conviction is some of the other stuff that we talked about nfts being a huge kind of like entry point for people.
00:45:27.762 - 00:45:57.514, Speaker B: This upgrade for Ethereum is critical. The development that's happening in the bitcoin camp around like exploring with, you know, an l two kind of scenario. There was. What is it? David Marcus, ex Facebook Libra guy, just announced kind of his project right around supporting kind of lightning and payment transfers. And those are the things that get me really fired up about, you know, where we're going. You know, we have another kind of energy crisis or macro blow up or another bank run. Sure.
00:45:57.514 - 00:46:27.668, Speaker B: That's going to impact this asset class for sure. One of the things that I would want to talk about another episode is who's the marginal, who's the incremental buyer, who's coming in? How much of that is just internal rotation? Where is this new kind of pockets of liquidity coming from anyways? The general market's also up a lot, so you're still correlated to that. Anyone's best guess, really. What do you think?
00:46:27.836 - 00:46:43.356, Speaker A: Look, inflation is cooling. Pretty tough for the Fed to raise rates much higher. Stocks are up. Central banks just came out. I was reading some Reuters things. Central banks are buying more gold than they've ever bought at all time. High bitcoins above 30k.
00:46:43.356 - 00:46:56.264, Speaker A: ETH is above two k. Nft NYC right now is bullish ETH. Tokyo coming up. Ethcc coming up in July. ETH withdrawals were successful. Feels pretty tough to be bearish.
00:46:56.384 - 00:47:07.244, Speaker B: I mean, long term for sure, you know, this is legal financial advice. But look, let's just for once, enjoy the weekend. It's been a huge milestone for Ethereum.
00:47:08.384 - 00:47:09.764, Speaker A: I don't know you're talking about.
00:47:10.104 - 00:47:28.692, Speaker B: No, no. Well, but I'm saying is, like, you know, it's been a great week for crypto, I think. And so let's take it all in for sure. From a long term perspective, I think this should be one of the key milestones. So, anyways, great episode. Not a lot of news, but an important milestone nonetheless. And we'll be here next week.
00:47:28.692 - 00:47:29.124, Speaker B: Right, sir?
00:47:29.164 - 00:47:30.804, Speaker A: See you guys Tuesday for the multicoin app.
