00:00:00.320 - 00:00:17.590, Speaker A: Andrew O. Sorkin asked this question. He's like, what do your lawyers think that you should be doing? And Sam's like, oh, obviously the lawyers don't think I should be here. I'm ignoring all of the advice of my lawyers. I'm just going to call bullshit on that. I think Sam has a world class crisis management firm, and I'm going to. Nick Carter tweeted this out.
00:00:17.590 - 00:00:46.454, Speaker A: I completely agree with it. He has a world class crisis management firm and legal team constructing a very specific, very deliberate public narrative right now. And I think he's using mainstream media journalists to promote a specific message here. I think we're recording now. Welcome back to another episode of Empire. Yeah, been another casual week in crypto. Coming off SBF, talking to the New York Times and Sorkin yesterday.
00:00:46.454 - 00:00:49.014, Speaker A: Yeah. Welcome back, Santi. How you doing, man?
00:00:49.994 - 00:01:25.938, Speaker B: Doing great. We were talking about this just before, but seems like it's still a fairly busy week, but not as crazy as the past ones. And. But, yeah, a lot of my days now have been spent talking to founders, and a lot of people reached out. Just, I don't know. I think this is the time where a lot of people just want to talk and reflect with close acquaintances, and it's only been helpful for me. Like, I remember doing this, like, in the past cycles of just talking, staying close to founders and people that, you know, I think are true believers and true builders.
00:01:25.938 - 00:01:39.094, Speaker B: And, you know, this time around, I've. Most of my day has been spent talking to them. It's just a good reminder refresher of, you know, the staying power of the industry and why we're all doing this. How about you?
00:01:39.914 - 00:02:05.942, Speaker A: Good, man. I got really excited seeing the Spotify wrap yesterday. Not because I got to see, we did a funny thing at blockworks. Someone at blockworks posted their Spotify wrapped and then everyone else shared their Spotify wrapped. And I was like, it was really funny seeing everyone else's Spotify wrapped, but actually, it was really cool seeing how many people shared on Twitter that empire is their most listened to podcasts. And that was cool. And actually, I don't know if you clicked that link I sent you.
00:02:05.942 - 00:02:22.664, Speaker A: Spotify gives podcasters a Spotify wrap to show, to talk about the audience and who's listening to your show and stuff like that. And there are thousands of people whose number one podcast is Empire, which was just a trip. It was just crazy to see. So I was, yeah. Just feeling really grateful for. To everyone who listens to the show.
00:02:22.744 - 00:02:34.752, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. We always do this at the end. But it means a lot. Like, it means really, we're like. I think when you and I started doing this, it wasn't. We didn't have like a specific over. Not like, at the top of the league table.
00:02:34.752 - 00:02:55.024, Speaker B: This is going to be deemed a failure. I didn't come into this with a specific goal in mind to be the number one podcast in crypto, you know, I just wanted to do this because education, I think, is super important. And if there's, like one listener, that's fine, but it's obviously nice to see that there are more than one listener.
00:02:55.064 - 00:03:01.224, Speaker A: There's one. There's one listener. I don't know if I'm doing this show for a whole nother year. If we have one listener. I'm kidding.
00:03:01.264 - 00:03:11.632, Speaker B: I know. Yeah, but, you know, I mean, like, I still remember there's a great, great YouTube. Like Andreas Sontanopoulos, I think is one of the best educators in the space, and he's been doing it for such a long time.
00:03:11.648 - 00:03:13.764, Speaker A: I know the video you're talking about where he's.
00:03:14.144 - 00:03:16.044, Speaker B: He's like, he's in the room.
00:03:16.424 - 00:03:20.032, Speaker A: People talking about bitcoin. Yeah. Oh, that's so good. So good.
00:03:20.128 - 00:03:39.456, Speaker B: I always see that. I always think about that when I'm doing this stuff. Not that I compare myself to Andres and there's a whole new league, and he's just. But I think, you know, if we can help one people, one person or two or three or five, that's all it really matters. I mean, it's like, very rewarding to see, you know, people are enjoying the show.
00:03:39.600 - 00:03:50.408, Speaker A: Yeah. Got a big year planned. We're almost done with. Next time you come to New York, you should check it out. We're almost done with our podcast studio. So blockworks got an office, new office in Manhattan. And we're almost done with our podcast studio.
00:03:50.408 - 00:04:06.998, Speaker A: I just demoed it, but it's looking real nice. Yeah. So. All right, here's what's on tap this week. SPF did this interview with Andrew Rossorkin at the New York Times deal book conference. So just want to get your takes on that. Talk about that a bit.
00:04:06.998 - 00:04:29.934, Speaker A: I've some thoughts on it. Block five, bankruptcy. Uniswap rolled out. Uniswap, NFT, their marketplace. HUD eight is pulling out of some of their shut down. I think 20% of their mining their rigs or just turned off 20% of their hash power. Apple would not let Coinbase ship their latest app release, actually, because of some.
00:04:29.934 - 00:04:38.302, Speaker A: Because they want basically coinbase to pay 30% of the apple fee. They want to give Apple their 30% fee on the gas, sir.
00:04:38.398 - 00:04:40.594, Speaker B: That's the gas fee. That's the gas.
00:04:41.894 - 00:04:53.394, Speaker A: There's tech layoffs and then actually Casa, which is probably a lot of people don't know about Casa, but I want to talk about Casa as well. So I don't know. I doubt we'll get to all of that, but where do you want to start?
00:04:55.814 - 00:04:57.954, Speaker B: I think in that order. Sounds about right.
00:04:58.454 - 00:05:14.206, Speaker A: All right. All right. Let's get creative with it. All right. So Sam Bankman Fried did this one on one interview with Andrew Ross Sorkin as part of New York Times dealbook conference late on Wednesday. Pulled out some quotes from, from that conversation, if anyone watched it. First off, he, like, he got on.
00:05:14.206 - 00:05:32.026, Speaker A: I thought he was going to like, look nicer. He got on. He's still looking pretty disheveled. Like, he had this, you know, black t shirt on that, you know when you can tell when someone, like, chews the front of their shirt a lot because it's kind of like hanging down and stuff. Like, he kind of had that look on the t shirt within like ten minutes. His right arm was shaking a lot. His hair was looking kind of messy.
00:05:32.026 - 00:05:50.426, Speaker A: I thought that he would get the memo that, like, he should have probably looked nicer, but pulled out some quotes. Here are a couple. Im just going to read them. The time I really knew there was a problem was November 6. He said I didnt knowingly commingle funds. He said I wasnt running Alameda. I didnt know exactly what was going on.
00:05:50.426 - 00:06:06.218, Speaker A: I didnt know the size of their position. Said I made a lot of mistakes. I never tried to commit fraud. So first off, I think Andrew Rossorkin did a, did like a beep, like a really good job, actually. I would say I would, I will give Andrew Os Orkin credit. I think he did a really good job. He asked some hard hitting questions.
00:06:06.218 - 00:06:38.004, Speaker A: There were times I wanted him to dig in a little more. But that's just, I mean, it's, it's a tough interview and I will give him credit. I think he did a really good job. I mean, Sam, basically, first of, is astonishing that he spoke. First of all, it was like just astonishing that he spoke. I think that the, I was really, by the end of it, I was pretty upset with the interview because he had the audience laughing, actually, which was the most important part of the whole interview that people aren't talking about. He had the audience laughing at two different points.
00:06:38.004 - 00:06:58.146, Speaker A: And so first he like, had them laughing and then he started talking about his charities, and it kind of panned to the audience. And the audience was, like, smiling. Like, not like this guy's a clown, but, like, oh, yeah. Like, this guy is a charity guy. And then he had them laughing again, and, like, man, and then. Who is it? Kevin O'Leary. Okay, so then Bill Ackman tweets out.
00:06:58.146 - 00:07:20.598, Speaker A: He said, call me crazy, but I think SBF is telling the truth. Then Kevin O'Leary tweets out. He goes, I lost millions as an investor in FTX, got sandblasted as a paid spokesman for the firm. But after listening to that interview, I'm in the Bill Ackman camp about the kid, man. It's just really upsetting seeing those takes, and they're just wrong. It's just. It's.
00:07:20.598 - 00:07:22.394, Speaker A: Those are horrible takes in my mind.
00:07:24.654 - 00:07:52.090, Speaker B: Yeah. Like, I consider myself a fairly optimistic, like, an optimist by heart. That's why I love technology. But I think this year has been really tough. Perhaps tougher than, like, other bear markets. Because when you look at this, it's just like, first of all, the behavior of SPF and just FDX is. It's like, you lose a lot of trust in the good naturedness of certain human beings.
00:07:52.090 - 00:08:07.430, Speaker B: But then the fact that he's been so able to just craft a narrative around his Persona, in spite of everything this has transpired, and there's still a certain pocket of people that, I don't know, have him in high regard.
00:08:07.562 - 00:08:07.918, Speaker A: It's.
00:08:07.966 - 00:08:34.374, Speaker B: It's just crazy to see. And it, like, a lot of the conversations I've had recently are with people outside of crypto. Like, you go to Thanksgiving dinner, I'm sure a lot of people had a difficult conversation. You know, you go two years of having great conversations, you're the most popular person in a party because you're in crypto when you're in a bull market. And then you're like, oh, sorry, you're in crypto. Or people just, like, in bear markets. And now I think a lot of people are asking these questions around FDX because there's a lot of retail that got hurt.
00:08:34.374 - 00:09:12.234, Speaker B: But it's just so crazy that, like, there is still some discussion around whether this was, like, fraud or not. He's been, like, anyone that has just read that, he's done, like, the first interview with a friend of his who was supposed to be off the record. Like, you just read that, and how can you just come out of that and, like, still have sympathy for the guy and not think that he's an absolute, like, you know, he committed. He's a sociopath and a criminal. Like, it's really difficult to, like, being a room with people that still don't believe that or have some hope that he was, like, doing the right thing or. I don't know, man. It's very.
00:09:12.234 - 00:09:21.034, Speaker B: You almost wonder, like, this is not inherent to crypto, and it's just like, yeah, it's really sad.
00:09:21.454 - 00:09:40.174, Speaker A: Yeah. So Henry Blodgett, who was CEO of Business Insider for a while, he tweeted out this thing and just pissed me off. He's like, FTX has collapsed. Doesn't mean that someone committed a crime. They were a highly leveraged financial institution. Their assets plummeted in value while their liabilities stayed the same. This happens all the time.
00:09:40.174 - 00:10:42.880, Speaker A: Is it incompetent? Is it reckless? Is it stupid? Yes, it's not necessarily criminal. This is the narrative that is being painted, and this is why I think that SPF probably won't face time in prison or much time in prison, which just kills me. And this is the narrative that's trying to be painted. Like, New York Times, obviously, horrendous coverage. It's also a Wall Street Journal article that bemoaned the loss of charitable donations from FTX. You had Vox co founder Matthew Iglesias just kind of whitewashing his own entanglements by crediting SPF's money with helping Dems in the 2020 elections, kind of sidestepping the fact that the money was probably was likely effectively embezzled. But I think, yeah, there's a lot of outlets right now that are describing, and a lot of people then now starting to believe that what happened to FTX was either a bank run or a run on deposits, or that they were just over leveraged, or that the company was disorganized and that it was a result of mismanagement rather than malfeasance.
00:10:42.880 - 00:11:04.294, Speaker A: And that is just categorically wrong. I think it's abundantly clear now that what happened to FTX and Alameda involved a variety of really conscious, really intentional fraudulent decisions that were intended to steal money from users and from investors. And this should not be seen as anything else.
00:11:05.994 - 00:12:15.574, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. I think it's criminal activity, and I haven't lost hope in the system that at some point, records will come out and the proper investigation is going to be done. So. But I think it's important for everyone to continue to apply pressure and demand that the truth comes out. And so I think, you know, this is where, like, a lot of people come out and say, well, crypto, and just investors have, like, a goldfish memory. And, like, look, it's only been a couple of weeks, and, you know, I don't want to say, like, we should talk about SPF all the time and FTX all the time, but I do think it's important to, like, remember these things because, you know, less than a year ago, or, like, over a year ago, you remember the quadriga example, right? And, like, you know, a lot of times, it's like, when you dig deeper into the history of someone, you're like, well, this person actually committed crime before, and then he was able to somehow come back from the dead and, like, raise money, do another venture, and then rug again. And so it's like, fool me once, like, shame.
00:12:15.574 - 00:12:26.118, Speaker B: What is it? Shame on you. Fool me twice. Shame on me. Or something like this. Like, I don't know. It's. I don't know what we can do as an industry other than, like, of course, keep applying pressure.
00:12:26.118 - 00:12:30.154, Speaker B: We'll continue to do this here and report on it and talk about it.
00:12:30.854 - 00:12:53.850, Speaker A: I don't. I don't know what we can do as an industry. But I will just say it's really frustrating seeing mainstream media push this narrative, um, and, like, lean into this narrative. Like, what. Why did New York Times have him at their. At their event? Well, because, a, the event, there were $2,500 tickets you could buy to the event, but b, to watch the thing, you had to sign up for a New York Times account. So it drove a lot of free accounts.
00:12:53.850 - 00:12:57.094, Speaker A: Not subscriptions, but free accounts. The.
00:12:57.634 - 00:12:58.374, Speaker B: Here.
00:12:58.914 - 00:13:09.554, Speaker A: Sam kept saying you didn't watch it. But Sam kept saying, he's like, I'm ignoring. He's like, Andrew O. Sorkin asked this. This question. He's like, what do you. What do your lawyers think that you should be doing? And Sam's like, oh, obviously the lawyers don't think I should be here.
00:13:09.554 - 00:13:36.854, Speaker A: I'm ignoring all of the advice of my lawyers. I'm just going to call bullshit on that. I think Sam has a world class crisis management firm, and I'm going to. Nick Carter tweeted this out. I completely agree with it. He has a world class crisis management firm and legal team constructing a very specific, very deliberate public narrative right now. And I think he's using mainstream media journalists to promote a specific message here.
00:13:36.854 - 00:13:57.398, Speaker A: And Nick had this good point. He's like, perceived intent matters a lot here. Manslaughter is a lot less worse than first degree premeditated murder. And so Sam is trying to change the narrative from, like, you planned all of this. This was malicious intent from day one to man. I really, really, really did mess up. This is horrible.
00:13:57.398 - 00:14:07.244, Speaker A: I feel so bad, but I didn't plan for it to go this way. It was mismanagement. We were young. It's working. It's working.
00:14:10.024 - 00:15:14.914, Speaker B: For anyone that I guess I'll try to be as objective as possible now as always, but I think just look no further. Just read the transcript of that initial interview you did with Vox, that reporter who is a friend of his, and we should probably link it in the show notes because. Just read it. Go in there. And, and when he gets asked, you know, a couple of times, like, he's, he's very cynical about, like, woke ism and like, certain comments around, you know, why he's doing effective altruism. And basically kind of, in a way, just admits, like, this is just a full facade and is a person that has no regard for other people and has sort of a distorted, delusional view of what the right version of the world should be. And he sort of has taken on a crusade and at all costs, which include, you know, could include criminal activity, he's just someone that is so self absorbed in what he thinks is the right thing and has no regard for institutions, for other people.
00:15:14.914 - 00:15:42.252, Speaker B: And it's just verbatim from his, his own kind of comments. And so read that. And I guess the question is for listeners, is, after you, you read that, is this someone that you would trust? Is this someone that you would kind of believe anything he says after that? And I'll just leave it to listeners to go in and do that on their own account and then reflect on that, because I think that's very telling.
00:15:42.388 - 00:15:46.264, Speaker A: Yeah, move on.
00:15:47.324 - 00:15:48.236, Speaker B: Yeah, I think so.
00:15:48.340 - 00:15:48.556, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:48.580 - 00:16:42.254, Speaker B: I mean, I think the last, the only thing, there's a couple, there will be some hearings that are starting. I think he's called in a Texas court on early next year, around February. I believe several other agencies are probing. I believe it's including the CFTC, Department of Justice. So back to your original comment. I think this is going to take time to do the full kind of forensics and subpoenas and all that stuff and investigations from a number of agencies, a number of jurisdictions. I mean, there's over a million creditors across the world, and so including Blockfi, suing them, or I guess suing SBF or the entity that SBF used to buy a lot of the shares in Robinhood because that's valued at a pretty meaningful account.
00:16:42.254 - 00:17:04.236, Speaker B: I believe Blockfi had all of their assets, or a lot of their assets, up to 350 million stuck or has stuck in FTX. And so they're going after that particular claim to recover some of the funds because blockbust against that. So I guess this is a good transition into blockfi because there's a few events that happen.
00:17:04.420 - 00:17:45.644, Speaker A: Yeah, let's talk about blockfi before that. Just on the hearings. I'm at the office today. You might be able to hear some New York traffic behind me, but I'm at the office and across the table is one of our reporters and she's watching one of the hearings, not an SGF hearing, but just some hearing going on in DC right now. And apparently someone said they're like, we think that we should just stop the crypto industry until we can get a handle on regulation. Let's just pause everything. It reminded me of when Zuckerberg was at that hearing and like someone is like a senator was like, oh, like how do you make money but your product is free, but then how do you make money? It's like there's just like such a level of gross misunderstanding of how things work anyways.
00:17:45.644 - 00:17:46.504, Speaker A: Blockfi.
00:17:47.364 - 00:17:47.892, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:17:47.988 - 00:18:16.346, Speaker A: So here's the update on Blockfi. On Blockfi. On Monday, Blockfi filed its petition for chapter eleven bankruptcy protection. After weeks. There's obviously, there's weeks of speculation that Blockfi was gonna be unable to continue operating in the wake of the FTX filing for bankruptcy on November 11, that people realized that probably Blockfi was next to go. Blockfi has, it's come out that Blockfi has more than 100,000 creditors. They owe their largest, their 50 largest creditors.
00:18:16.346 - 00:18:30.014, Speaker A: I think the number is $1.3 billion. It's estimated that Blockfi has about heads between. These are big number, big range here, but between 1 billion to 10 billion in assets. That doesn't make sense.
00:18:31.674 - 00:18:41.126, Speaker B: That number comes from the chapter eleven normal filing where basically they range. It's just a checklist thing that you have to disclose of like where you fall.
00:18:41.270 - 00:18:46.094, Speaker A: Do you have 1 million to 100 million? 100 million to a billion? Got it.
00:18:46.174 - 00:18:49.134, Speaker B: I don't think they have 10 billion. I think it's closer to a billion for what it's worth.
00:18:49.174 - 00:19:18.234, Speaker A: But yeah, yeah. So, man, there's a who's anchor a trust company. They have a $730 million unsecured client. So just looking at the creditors here, the company's largest creditors include FTX us. They have a $275 million unsecured claim. The SEC, which has a $30 million unsecured claim. And then Blockfi's largest creditor is Ankara trust company who has a $730 million unsecured claim.
00:19:18.234 - 00:19:20.274, Speaker A: Who is Ankara? Do you know?
00:19:20.974 - 00:19:40.866, Speaker B: I believe this is the shell. So it's Ankura trust. It's a Fairfield, Connecticut based firm. But I'm not sure. I don't want to say it's the FTX shell entity, but. No, good question. I actually don't know.
00:19:41.010 - 00:20:10.044, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know either. So we'll figure that out. We'll get back to you guys on that one. They also owe like $50 million to a client. So I think the four biggest creditors are 730 to Ankara, 275 to FTX, 49 million to a client, 30 million to the SEC. Yeah. What do you, what do you add any thoughts on, on blockfi stuff? I mean, I can curious what you find if you find anything interesting here.
00:20:10.744 - 00:20:12.048, Speaker B: On the blockfi stuff.
00:20:12.176 - 00:20:19.764, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, Blockfi is trying to sue FTX right now for Rob, for their share of Robinhood Equity. I think it is, which is a pretty interesting deal.
00:20:20.944 - 00:20:55.460, Speaker B: Yeah. Let me explain this because I tweeted about this earlier, but let me pull this up because it's, I believe here. So Blockfi is a creditor to FTX that lent to Alameda. So Alameda then lent to Emergent, which is a shell company owned by SPF. So emergent actually was the one that bought Robinhood shares. Then they pledged that as collateral to guarantee to blockfi the loan to FTX. So that was used to bail out blockfi.
00:20:55.460 - 00:21:21.224, Speaker B: So it's a very big circular reference and it might be confusing to listeners, but basically, like, you know, for that particular reason, Blockfi is going directly to and have or thinks they have a claim against emergent, which is a shell company that owns the Robinhood stake, which is fairly sizable.
00:21:21.764 - 00:21:22.500, Speaker A: What is it up to?
00:21:22.532 - 00:22:04.940, Speaker B: 400 million or so, particularly because those shares were pledged as collateral. So a little bit of history, right? You remember when Blockfi initially got into trouble earlier this year, right. A lot of it in part because of the GBD three arrows blowing up. Blockfi had a bit of exposure to that. And so, and of course, now, of course they also have a lot of export to GBTCR, which 3 hours was doing. So anyways, they get into trouble, FTX steps in to buy blockfi. The terms are not disclosed, but, you know, they effectively took over Blockfi.
00:22:04.940 - 00:22:18.680, Speaker B: And as part now it has come to light that they used the emergence as collateral. So the Robinhood shares is valued to buy. Blockfight seems to bail out Blockfi.
00:22:18.712 - 00:22:28.444, Speaker A: And so man untangling these claims. Untangling who has a claim to the shares is going to be an absolute disaster.
00:22:29.104 - 00:22:33.364, Speaker B: Yeah, it's pretty crazy. You know, I think.
00:22:34.544 - 00:23:07.184, Speaker A: Wait, is this right? Santi. So block. So Blockfi is a. Blockfi is a creditor to FTX that lent to Alameda, that lent to emergent, which is a shell company owned by Sam that bought Robinhood shares, that those Robinhood shares were pledged as collateral to guarantee to Blockfi the loan to FTX that was then used to bail out Blockfi. So Sam purchased his stake in Robinhood via shell company. Via a loan from Alameda. Via a loan from Blockfi.
00:23:07.924 - 00:23:19.596, Speaker B: Correct. So. So in a nutshell, SBF used, or FTX used funds to bail out blockfi.
00:23:19.660 - 00:23:27.384, Speaker A: Yeah. With the sole goal of just to get, eventually, probably to get, honestly, Robinhood deposits to move on to FTX one day, too.
00:23:27.804 - 00:24:19.822, Speaker B: This is all really. Yeah. What would be really interesting here is to understand how much of the terms of this deal, how much of that did FTX require Blockfi to move over FTX to be the custodian? I mean, it sounds like FTX us was custodying a lot of the assets of Blockbuy. So it'd be really curious to understand how much of that happened as part of this kind of bailout. But, yeah, like, it's no surprise that now it's fairly obvious what the strategy was. It sounds like FTX out and was bidding on these distressed deposit institutions like Voyager, Blockfi, really, to get more deposits in the door and continue to running this machine because they themselves were in trouble. Right.
00:24:19.822 - 00:24:56.088, Speaker B: And so a lot of the. Some of these folks might have had FTT as collateral, and they, you know, in order not to push the price down for FTT, they just wanted to absorb that. Right. And so that this all folks, goes back to two very cataclysmic events that really started this fall of dominoes, if you will. And it was Luna, which was probably the number one cause for a lot of this stuff that went on after that. A lot of people were caught really off guard. Luna lost a lot of money.
00:24:56.088 - 00:25:16.556, Speaker B: And then slowly, over the ensuing months, you know, it just started to come to light, who was really in deep shit. And it started with three arrows and a few other funds, and then a few like Voyager, Blockfi, Genesis, and, you know, and so. And then, of course, you know, ultimately FTX.
00:25:16.620 - 00:25:17.584, Speaker A: Right? Yep.
00:25:18.404 - 00:25:52.500, Speaker B: So, yeah, like, the natural question now is, like, you know, what happens to Blockfi if they can actually recover a lot of funds? FTX Us seems to be SBF. This comes actually directly from SPF. In one of the interviews, he says there's probably one to one backing FTX us deposits there. And there's like $0.25 on the dollar backing FTX International. And then. But of course, once he filed for chapter eleven, you just kind of freeze all of that.
00:25:52.500 - 00:26:07.236, Speaker B: And then he claims that, like, you know, a few moments after he filed for chapter eleven, which he didn't want to do, but as a lawyer were really pressuring him to do, he got like 4 billion in the door. And that would have, like, allowed themselves to continue operating. Business as usual.
00:26:07.300 - 00:26:07.636, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:26:07.700 - 00:26:11.860, Speaker B: Which I really find hard to believe, but, you know.
00:26:11.972 - 00:26:28.024, Speaker A: Yeah. But by the way, I looked up Ankara. They're. It's not a holding company. It's an. It's in an indentured trustee firm that represents a group of unnamed creditors. So I think what this means, like, this is.
00:26:28.024 - 00:26:43.732, Speaker A: Yeah, this is the kind of company that's typically brought in to represent the interests of others. So I would assume the creditor here is not Ankara, it's folks that just bundled together. Bundled together? Yeah. So I don't know. I don't know any more than that, but it's not a holding company.
00:26:43.788 - 00:27:01.904, Speaker B: So, yeah, we've said it before, but it really is quite surprising, the lack of risk management from the risk teams of a lot of these places. It's embarrassing.
00:27:02.764 - 00:27:18.808, Speaker A: All right, pausing. I forgot to do this at the intro. I'm going to get punished by our marketing team. Permissionless ticket sales are on sale. Um, we basically. The way, the way that we do permissionless ticket sales for anyone who remembers this is, uh, we drop them like supreme drops clothing. We drop tickets.
00:27:18.808 - 00:27:41.322, Speaker A: We don't unlit. We basically unlock 250 tickets every two weeks. When the tickets sell out, tickets are closed. So our first batch sold out in 6 hours every two weeks. The, the next batch is always more expensive than the last one. I think we increased the price, like five to 10% every single two, uh, every two weeks. So batch number one was, was two weeks ago.
00:27:41.322 - 00:28:00.050, Speaker A: Sold out in 6 hours. Batch number two unlocked today. We sold 65 tickets in 13 minutes. So we've got like 185 of them left. By the time we release this podcast tomorrow, they might already be sold out. So I'm sorry about that, but you can join a waitlist. So anyways, that's your plug.
00:28:00.050 - 00:28:06.608, Speaker A: If you listen to empire, there's your alpha. Go. Go get your tickets before the price goes up. You gonna join us this year, Santi, or next year?
00:28:06.696 - 00:28:10.224, Speaker B: Yes, I think so. It's in New York. Washington. Right.
00:28:10.304 - 00:28:15.764, Speaker A: It's in Austin. Austin, Texas in September. That's from. Yeah. Permissionless in Austin.
00:28:16.264 - 00:28:18.320, Speaker B: Yeah, I love, Austin's a great city.
00:28:18.392 - 00:28:20.124, Speaker A: We're kicking coin desk out of the city.
00:28:21.424 - 00:28:24.884, Speaker B: Just kidding. Well, speaking of coin desk, are you guys gonna buy it?
00:28:26.744 - 00:28:28.884, Speaker A: Uniswap, nft marketplace.
00:28:31.144 - 00:28:32.888, Speaker B: I'm sorry, is there like an audio?
00:28:32.936 - 00:28:35.324, Speaker A: Yeah, there's a lag. There's a lag, man.
00:28:35.404 - 00:28:39.144, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, definitely uniswap. Nfts.
00:28:40.244 - 00:29:01.948, Speaker A: Uniswap did launch their NFT marketplace Wednesday morning. So here's the background. So Uniswap bought Genie. Genie and Gem were the two biggest NFT aggregators. So basically they aggregate prices across a bunch of different NFT exchanges. Who bought Genie? Someone bought Gem. Someone else bought gem.
00:29:01.948 - 00:29:08.284, Speaker A: Did Opensea buy Gem? I think someone bought Gem. Maybe not. Yeah. Looking this up.
00:29:08.704 - 00:29:10.184, Speaker B: So it was fairly controversial.
00:29:10.224 - 00:29:21.896, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Opensea. Opensea bot gem. Opensea uniswap. Yeah, open C bot gem. Uniswap bought Genie. So basically Uniswap launched their NFT marketplace on Wednesday morning.
00:29:21.896 - 00:29:57.374, Speaker A: So you can now buy nfts directly from Uniswap interface. Like I went to uniswap this morning, you just click the NFT tab, and then once you click the NFT tab, you're going to think that you just hit OpenSea page because it looks identical to Opensea. But really you're trading on Uniswap. They aggregate liquidity from every major NFT exchange. I think there's seven or eight of them. They also really interestingly, open source their front end, which is pretty cool. They open source the actual interface, not just the protocol, by the way, for those, if you want.
00:29:57.374 - 00:30:19.312, Speaker A: The reason that you like aggregators is because you're going to get the best pricing or you're going to get the cheapest prices. You might not have the best execution, but you're going to get the cheapest prices. So, like, Opensea's aggregator pulls prices from OpenSea. Excuse me? Uniswap's aggregator pulls prices from OpenSea. What is it? X two, y two. I've never used that one. Pseudoswap looks rare.
00:30:19.312 - 00:30:22.984, Speaker A: It all pulls into Uniswap from all the different marketplaces.
00:30:23.104 - 00:31:19.864, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. It's going to be fairly interesting. I think over the last couple of years, over the last year, we've observed people, other marketplaces eat into open seas dominance because it used to be where open sea was just incredibly dominant. And now that has come down over time, it will also be interesting to see how many how much activity is increased because of these aggregators making it very easy to keep floors. But you know, and the functionality of can you buy a specific NFT? Because a lot of times I think there are very different types of collectors, you know, whether you want to buy a specific NFT and you just want that and you're like less price sensitive or other people that are just doing it more. So from like, hey, I want to buy a basket long Azuki's or punks. And so anyways, it's going to be fairly interesting, all this to say it's fairly nascent.
00:31:19.864 - 00:32:17.436, Speaker B: And the other thing that, I mean, we had the Salonica this week and we interviewed the episode, it's going to go out next week and it's really interesting. I think we talk a lot about obviously defi being in a bear market for the last two years, all this sort of chaos that has happened because FTX and prices and volatility in the market. But one of the interesting things that has been just observing the NFT space is in large part just been, it's certainly been affected like volume and whatnot, but like new collections launching across different ecosystems. And it seems to me like it's just been a fairly interesting quasi insulated pocket of the crypto market because I don't even think about NFTs as correlated to the rest of the crypto market. I think it's just, it's just adding more diversity and type of users that, you know, it's been fairly interesting to observe, you know, that phenomenon. I don't know if you would agree with that.
00:32:17.540 - 00:32:31.748, Speaker A: No, I would agree. I mean, Solana, NFTs are hitting like all time highs right now, which is bizarre. Or at least maybe volume of NFTs on Solana is all time high and like mints are still selling out. It's kind of wild. Also shout out permies. The floor on permies has gone up from 1.5 to 2.5
00:32:31.748 - 00:32:54.484, Speaker A: in the last 30 days. Like that's. Yeah, it's just nuts to see this. I love the move by uniswap. I think this is genius. I as a retail NFT user, Uniswap is now the best place to go buy nfcs. I think Meltom had this great piece that I have referenced on a couple of shows about the institutions are coming to nfTs.
00:32:54.484 - 00:33:29.674, Speaker A: I think what Uniswap rolled out does not solve that. The execution is probably maybe subpar, but I think they're going to win in NFT. I think they'll do really well in the NFT space, and the same reason they did well in the Dex space. Other Dexs might be more technically efficient at specific things like mev protection or LSD liquidity, or have better token economics, but I think Uni's brand and vertical integration is going to just be really powerful here. And I think folks will end up using unisoftware to buy nfts. I love the move. I think it's a great move.
00:33:29.674 - 00:33:34.234, Speaker A: When are they rolling out their app? Do you know.
00:33:36.274 - 00:33:38.122, Speaker B: Their mobile app, Uniswap?
00:33:38.298 - 00:33:40.894, Speaker A: Yeah, I think they've been public about that.
00:33:42.874 - 00:34:31.606, Speaker B: Yeah, no clue. I mean, it's a great question because you're now coming up to a pretty big, contentious debate around Apple and how guarded and difficult they've made it for certain players, or all players in the industry, including today. You know, we now learned that, you know, they're charging 30% on the Coinbase wallet and, you know, there's been a fair, again, in the Solana episode, we covered this. A lot of the reason of existence to launch a phone is for this reason, right, to like really circumvent and get away from, you know, really the. It's not just crypto firms. I mean, a lot of other developers outside of crypto found it incredibly difficult to work with Apple. And around Apple is like really tough and oftentimes like, just unnecessarily difficult policies, procedures.
00:34:31.606 - 00:34:50.874, Speaker B: And sometimes they don't give you straight answers. And the crypto space has really suffered, I think, on the mobile side of things because Apple has such an important gatekeeper role here. But I don't know when uniswap is launching their app.
00:34:51.254 - 00:34:54.062, Speaker A: Yeah, one of the interesting things, the.
00:34:54.078 - 00:35:32.808, Speaker B: Last thing on this point is that I learned from the Solana episode was obviously they're building the hardware through a normal manufacturer. Their real focus is building this mobile stack. SDK. Initially purposeful for Solana, but Anatoly did say if we wanted to integrate other chains like Ethereum or had EVM support, it's certainly possible. So, yeah, I think this is going to be a huge positive for the space. Apparently it's launching soon. I mean, there's a few out in the wild, but they were saying this time around next year they plan to have anywhere from 50.
00:35:32.808 - 00:35:46.404, Speaker B: You said having 100,000 phones out in the wild would be a huge success, so it would be really interesting how that changes the dynamic and how Apple responds to that pressure.
00:35:47.064 - 00:36:22.316, Speaker A: Yeah, very much so. I thought it was pretty funny that Opensea, excuse me, uniswap kind of blatantly copied Opensea design as well. Have you looked, have you pulled it up? If not, you should pull it up. You go to uniswap and pull up nfts. It literally looks identical to OpenSea. It reminded me of like when Microsoft basically comes, gets into the software game, they're never first, but they basically just copy pasta what others have done. And if you look at when Microsoft launched their version of notion, it was a literal copy pasta of notion.
00:36:22.316 - 00:36:29.202, Speaker A: Same with Slack. When they copied Microsoft Teams, basically one in the same. Just throw the Microsoft logo on there.
00:36:29.258 - 00:36:45.974, Speaker B: Yeah, it comes full circle. Sushi copied. And a lot of other amms have copied the front end of uniswap because people just really familiar with it and now they go out and copy the same. So look, it's the world of open source. Good design gets copied.
00:36:46.914 - 00:37:05.654, Speaker A: There you go. Let's go into the app. The Apple NFT Coinbase NFT. I just want to read the Coinbase tweet. Let's see. Let me pull this up as a Coinbase wallet tweeted out earlier today, we're recording this on Thursday. You might have noticed you cannot send NFTs on Coinbase wallet iOS anymore.
00:37:05.654 - 00:37:46.058, Speaker A: This is because Apple blocked our last release until we disabled the feature. Apple's claim is that the gas fees required to send nfts need to be paid through their in app purchase system so they can collect 30% of the gas fee. I'm laughing because if you understand how nfts work, this is not possible. Apple's proprietary in app purchase system does not support crypto, so also they couldn't even comply if they tried. Right. And as Coinbase points out, this is akin to Apple trying to take a cut of fees for every email that gets sent over open Internet protocols, which actually, yeah, I was going to say that could be a good idea because it would prevent spam emails, but nevermind, not going to go there.
00:37:46.186 - 00:37:47.254, Speaker B: Here's a hack.
00:37:48.214 - 00:37:48.830, Speaker A: What's that?
00:37:48.902 - 00:38:19.456, Speaker B: Yeah, so here's a hack, guys. If you're a team out there, and I've said it before, I'll say it again, give people that are on mobile a free NFT or a free airdrop and gaslit the claim so that you don't have to work around or have even a payment of sorts and then, or have them like, just visualize, like, oh, you've earned a badge, you've earned an NFT. Or you can claim an airdrop in order to claim it. You can only do it on desktop. And this is what Musk is doing with Twitter. Right. The Twitter blue subscription.
00:38:19.456 - 00:38:56.044, Speaker B: He basically disabled that on mobile. I understand. And you can only sign up on desktop purely to circumvent this egregious, like, 30% fee. Right. And so in the same similar manner, if you're a game, if you're an NFT collection, people are mobile, they're going to increasingly just try to do something in mobile and interact with these things. You know, send them out, give them an incentive and design your flow so that you, you have a sufficiently strong hook on mobile for them to go to desktop, claim it, and do the whole metamask experience or whatever, phantom wall, whatever, using hardware, whatever. So.
00:38:56.044 - 00:39:25.454, Speaker B: So then you kind of. Because I don't think it's going to be, as much as we complain about this, I don't think that Apple is going to meaningfully change their stance on crypto. Just, you know, certainly like antitrust chats and, you know, they might get pressure from regulators and yada yada. But as far as I can tell, this debate has been going on for years. And it's not just crypto. A lot of people and developers have complained about Apple just making their life difficult.
00:39:27.074 - 00:39:59.050, Speaker A: Yeah. If Congress wants to do something useful here, they would open up the App Stores. Instead of trying to regulate crypto here, they would unlock the App Store. So it's just funny because this is not, even if they wanted to do this, this is not even technologically possible. No, it just feels funny because Apple is always so advanced with tech. I got the new iPad yesterday, actually, and it was just this amazing tech experience. They've never been able to have a good take on crypto.
00:39:59.050 - 00:40:10.858, Speaker A: They've never been able to understand it or actually, they obviously, never mind, that's a bad take. They do understand that. They just want to control it. So it just feels like they want to be basically an overlord on crypto transactions.
00:40:10.946 - 00:40:13.282, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, too, this is also the innovators dilemma.
00:40:13.298 - 00:40:13.426, Speaker A: Right.
00:40:13.450 - 00:40:18.722, Speaker B: They have no incentive to going first, no incentive to support crypto when they can. You know, they don't want to jeopardize their big business.
00:40:18.778 - 00:40:18.946, Speaker A: Right.
00:40:18.970 - 00:40:25.404, Speaker B: Crypto is still very small drop in the bucket for anyone. Right. So they've. It's a classic innovator's dilemma.
00:40:25.524 - 00:40:53.032, Speaker A: Also, you probably see the same thing, too. There's a lot of companies that are dealing with this in crypto right now, but nobody wants to talk back to. Apple is like big shout out to coinbase for actually posting this thread. Most startups are too small to want to air their grievances against Apple at the risk that it just could be too detrimental to their business to not ever be able to launch. A lot of companies are dealing with this. They just don't air it out in public. So.
00:40:53.128 - 00:40:59.564, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Apple is basically trying to be the ultimate, you know, Mev extractor. Right?
00:40:59.864 - 00:41:00.600, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:41:00.752 - 00:41:07.244, Speaker B: By sending nfts on mobile they're taking a 30% cut. I mean that's. Yeah. Maybe they should run their own validators.
00:41:07.544 - 00:41:25.014, Speaker A: By the way, this is a sign that like, I don't, I don't know. I was really bearish on the Solana phone. Getting more bullish and you'll see. We had this conversation with Anatoly and Ben from Solana drops on Monday. Got to decentralize not just the software stack but the hardware stack too. So.
00:41:26.474 - 00:41:27.562, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:41:27.738 - 00:41:53.664, Speaker A: Yeah. Alrighty, what's next? Hud eight or kraken or casa? Let's do HuD eight for a second and then we can move past it. So Huda is a public bitcoin miner. They were forced to, according to them, they were forced to turn off 20% of its, of their total hash power. About 5800 miners. They had to turn off 5800 miners. What they said is due to a disagreement with an energy provider.
00:41:53.664 - 00:42:22.444, Speaker A: It is total speculation. My take would be that this is not due to a disagreement with an energy provider but rather it's just because mining bitcoin right now is not profitable. With where bitcoin's price is at, I really don't know anything. I could be totally wrong. But in general it's been a rough year for hide. They have I think a $200 million market cap around there. Their stock has dropped more than 85% this year.
00:42:22.444 - 00:42:54.044, Speaker A: They reported a loss of cad23 million compared to a profit of 23 million a year earlier. They have, I don't know, it's like we talked about in that episode a couple of months ago. What really hurts bitcoin miners is when the people running the company have this like Hodl Hodl Hodl mentality. That's not a treasury management solution. HUD Eight has publicly pledged to hold on to all of their bitcoin despite the tough market conditions. It just like feels like a funny thing to do. It's like that.
00:42:54.044 - 00:42:58.132, Speaker A: You don't need to hodl Hodl Hodl. Like just take, take care of your business.
00:42:58.188 - 00:43:51.780, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean it's like a, it's like an energy producer, like storing and holding onto their natural gas or oil. Like I've always found the mining business incredibly difficult and not as attractive as holding the underlying. I think if you were to do run certain returns around investing in miners or spinning up your own mining farm requires a lot of capital, a lot of capex investment into ASICs, the depreciation schedule of ASICs and these specialized hardware to mine bitcoin is fairly short. You never get a sense you have an advantage because the manufacturers bit mains of the world probably are mining bitcoin ahead of you and then selling you the equipment after. You're also exposed to wild fluctuations in energy prices and regulators clamping down on you. Because the narrative is super strong.
00:43:51.780 - 00:44:29.904, Speaker B: Anytime energy prices go up, they blame the miners. This happened in Pennsylvania, this happened in New York, probably Ontario. Teachers pension fund is putting pressure as well. So it's never like people don't really understand how energy gets produced and, like, how energy storage works and how actually miners have played a huge role in, like, taking unused energy in the grid to then mine. Nonetheless, a huge rant. All this to say is, I've never found the mining business really profitable. Like, if you look at the oil and gas sector, back in my days in investment banking, like, the most profitable, like, places to invest along the continuum of, like, from exploration to distribution, it was never like.
00:44:29.904 - 00:44:55.636, Speaker B: It was never like what the miners do think. It's really like a lot of the transportation and refining of the commodities, where a lot of the value gets made. In this case, what does that mean for crypto exchanges? Distribution. Right. They take the raw commodity and then they sell it and then distribute it. Right. And so I think miners just really take a beating.
00:44:55.636 - 00:45:23.614, Speaker B: Right. Because it's very hard to manage treasury. You know, manage that treasury. And it's increasingly competitive. And oftentimes you're competing against jurisdictions like in Mongolia and Siberia, like in Russia, like it's nordic circle. It's like, very, very difficult. So, yeah, we talked a little bit about minor dynamics and also in the Nick Carter episode that aired last week.
00:45:23.614 - 00:45:47.558, Speaker B: So, you know, for anyone that really wants to listen, that they should, they should. Yeah, they should listen to that, because the natural gut reaction is, wait a minute, miners are having a really hard time. Oh, shit. This means that, like, the bitcoin network is going to go down and it's false. It's not. There are certain adjustments in the difficulty rate and whatnot. And we've seen these moments before where miners have a hard time and there's an adjustment.
00:45:47.558 - 00:45:52.242, Speaker B: So. And a relocation miner. So China, too.
00:45:52.358 - 00:45:55.778, Speaker A: Do you see my twitter? You see my tweet about bitcoin security model?
00:45:55.826 - 00:46:06.090, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, I did, by the way. You should. Yeah. Why don't you talk about that? Because we've talked about it a number of times in other episodes.
00:46:06.282 - 00:46:06.890, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:46:07.002 - 00:46:19.874, Speaker B: Who was it when we talked about it with Eric Voorhees. Right. He's. We talked about it and he basically was like, no, like, this is something that is too far. Like, let's just kick the can down the road. And I don't think that's going to be the case.
00:46:22.534 - 00:46:28.102, Speaker A: I actually really want to do a bitcoin security. Yeah, I want to do a bitcoin security episode, actually.
00:46:28.198 - 00:46:29.710, Speaker B: Let's spend two minutes on it now.
00:46:29.822 - 00:46:53.910, Speaker A: I mean, here's the deal. So the. So at the genesis of bitcoin, the block reward was 50 bitcoin every four years. That gets cut, right? So 2012, there's the first halving the block reward got cut to 25. 2016, the having cuts the block reward to twelve point 520. 20, having cuts the block order to 6.25. There's another having coming up in 2024, cuts the block order to 3.125.
00:46:53.910 - 00:47:23.384, Speaker A: Every four years, it gets cut in half again. Right. So 2028, it'll be 1.5625, then 78125, and it just keeps getting cut. Now, the reason that, hypothetically, that that is not an issue is because the price of bitcoin keeps going up, right? So then people are still incentivized to get this bitcoin. So maybe in 20, 16, 12.5, bitcoin was worth $1,000 or, like, $300.
00:47:23.384 - 00:47:58.770, Speaker A: Now, when you mine for bitcoin, you only get, like, 6.25, but that's fine because the price has gone up so much that it still makes it worth it. My question that I asked on crypto Twitter, I said, can someone explain how this security model scales if bitcoin's block space doesn't continue to accrue demand? Maybe that wasn't the right question. I think maybe the best question is just, like, if bitcoin's price doesn't keep going up. And honestly, I was not very impressed by a lot of the answers that I think got, like, hundreds of comments. I was not very impressed. Munib had a really good answer.
00:47:58.770 - 00:48:03.618, Speaker A: I thought Munib from blockstack, but there weren't really that many good answers.
00:48:03.666 - 00:48:05.706, Speaker B: So I don't know what was his answer, though.
00:48:05.810 - 00:48:34.090, Speaker A: He said, settlements from bitcoin layers. Here's. So Munib's whole thing is people are going to build on top of bitcoin, right? So set his, which I don't agree with, but you can't say that's a thesis. Yeah. So what he said is that settlements, settlements from bitcoin layers can and will drive up demand for block space. He's saying that because he's saying Lightning's already doing this, the stacks layer is already doing this. He said bitcoin base layers for settlements and not payments.
00:48:34.090 - 00:48:38.962, Speaker A: Um, the reason. I mean, I disagree with that.
00:48:38.978 - 00:49:50.804, Speaker B: The whole convoluted answer has always been, somehow people are going to believe that bitcoin is super important to secure and continue. And there'll be altruistic players, like exchanges and maybe countries or large whales that, like, subsidize the security of the network, which to me is like a very unsatisfactory answer when you consider that the whole fundamental premise of crypto is to build systems that don't rely on altruism or trust of any kind. And it feels to me like the bitcoin community should just look themselves in the mirror and have an open heart debate and really think about these things today. Not in ten years, not in five years, but simply today. And look, I'll reference again, one of the best things that I heard from Anatoly when we interviewed him this week was he said, we've taken a beating because we asked him, look, you guys have faced a lot of criticism. And he said, you know what? That's open source. And we've taken a lot of the criticisms, and it has actually helped us redesign pieces of the network that were just flawed.
00:49:50.804 - 00:50:38.634, Speaker B: And I'd rather hear that. I'd rather be part of a community, part of an open source network that constantly understands that design is not perfect and constantly wants to patch certain things. And I understand the bitcoin camp has always been, we cannot be as flexible or as fast moving as Ethereum or other networks, because bitcoin is like this hardened thing that we sacrosanct. We cannot touch marginal improvements. It's like the way the central bank communicates, right? The central bank doesn't communicate like an investment, like a, you know, like a public CEO. They need to be really guarded and cautious. And, you know, I understand part of that, but it's also like, I think it's a very existential crisis here.
00:50:38.634 - 00:51:31.012, Speaker B: And if you're holding, if you're a Cathie Wood thinking bitcoin's going to go to a million, I just think cathy doesn't fundamentally understand this conundrum because, again, as an investor, you discount everything to today, and you say, wait a minute. I've increasingly find it very hard that today, 99% of all the security budget of bitcoin relies on block rewards that are just going to go down in an exponential manner. And fees haven't really gone up. Hmm. And I have basically no real strong footing to understand how you're going to bridge that gap other than maybe someone, Cathie Wood of the world, or an exchange or CZ decides to bail us all out. Well, you know what, folks? I don't think crypto is designed to be bailed out or rely on ultra.
00:51:31.068 - 00:51:35.804, Speaker A: Look, look, I don't want to fud bitcoin too much here, because I'm not fighting it.
00:51:35.844 - 00:51:36.324, Speaker B: I'm just.
00:51:36.404 - 00:52:06.014, Speaker A: No, I. No, I know, I know, I know. Here's my frustration with the thing I tweeted. The overwhelming response was, bitcoin is a global, neutral currency with immutable monetary policy. How would you say that that is not worth expending effort to earn forever? I'm like, that is it's really important to keep that going. But what's the monetary incentive to keep that going? Someone's got to be incentivized.
00:52:06.354 - 00:52:45.404, Speaker B: At the end of the day, people are rational economic beings, and if they can transition over to another network and make more money, you're going to do that. Now this is not to say that ethereum is perfect. Look, there are some very valid criticism around proof of stake and censorship and concentration validators. I understand that and I get it. And we will talk. It's not the right kind of episode to talk about it, but I think as we look forward to next year, I think this should be an ongoing discussion around how does your network accrue value and how does your network have a sustainable security budget. I think proof of state networks have certain tendencies towards clustering and centralization.
00:52:45.404 - 00:53:20.724, Speaker B: I think any network in general has these tendencies. But we need to kind of think about at least perfect to me has always felt a more aligned system that actually has a viable security model. But then you also have to focus on, okay, censorship and working around, like, you know, when you have nefarious actors and validation of that and censorship of transactions. Totally get it. And we should talk about that. But from a security budget perspective, I think you're at least working from a solid foundation that the network can be secured.
00:53:23.304 - 00:53:34.600, Speaker A: I'm moving past it. Moving on. We're going to do some episodes on bitcoin security because I'm curious about it. All right, last two things I want to talk about. One is Kraken did some layoffs. Heart goes out to folks at Kraken. They laid off.
00:53:34.600 - 00:53:52.588, Speaker A: I think it was 1100 people, about 30% of the company. Jesse Powell tweeted out, rafdea Kraken headcount rolled back twelve months. Macro was already tough. We held out. But recent industry woe, recent industry woes diminished. Near term optimism about a crypto rebound. We're better positioned now.
00:53:52.588 - 00:54:18.604, Speaker A: Glad we were able to take care of our former colleagues. I think he's referring to, like, severance and benefits and things like that. It's been a privilege to work with you all. David Sachs said this tweet, actually, I won't share that. Basically, David Sachs said this to you. Said, for the last decade, per seat pricing has been a huge tailwind for software companies, as seat expansion was the norm. That trend is going to go in reverse over the next year as seat contraction becomes the baseline.
00:54:18.604 - 00:54:42.062, Speaker A: This other guy, dare Obasanjo, had a tweet. Tech sector layoffs are high relative to other industries because every other industry shrank during COVID while tech companies grew as people use tech products more during lockdown. We're simply seeing a reversion to the mean and an elimination of pandemic hiring spikes. So I think there's just big reversion to the mean going on right now. Everyone's doing layoffs, but, yeah, shout out to Kraken, folks.
00:54:42.158 - 00:54:57.254, Speaker B: People taking a hint at Elon's playbook of coming in, cutting a bunch of workforce, and then saying, okay, how bloated are these organizations now? Yeah, Kraken, I think it's been. I don't intimate that Kraken's bloated. I think the crypto industries has been hit harder.
00:54:57.334 - 00:55:05.504, Speaker A: Yeah, Elon's about to, yeah. Create a playbook for creating a profitable. Creating a profitable tech company. And I think people are going to follow suit.
00:55:06.684 - 00:55:47.040, Speaker B: Yep. Look at Mike Dudis had a great tweet. And Mike can be pretty to the point, and, like, in a very funny way, he said the what is it? Box has been, you know, the CEO Box has been fairly critical of crypto, and he claims to have all the answers, and basically all they all revolve around web3 is a scam. But somehow this company's never been profitable in all its years of existence. So, hey, maybe just. Just focus on your goddamn unity economics instead of, you know, shitting on this industry. Because I'll tell you what name, for what it's worth, uniswap a company.
00:55:47.040 - 00:56:20.176, Speaker B: Uniswap Labs with a handful, and I'm talking like, 2030, less than 100 employees. I think 50. And the scale that they got, and at points in time, having more volume and fee generation, revenue generation, and certainly profitability per headcount than coinbase. And that is a power like anyone that comes out there, any web two CEO listening. Okay, guys, let's have a debate. Pound for pound, a web3 protocol. I don't wanna call it a company, but a protocol is infinitely.
00:56:20.176 - 00:57:04.784, Speaker B: And has web3 protocols have been proven to be highly more scalable, profitable, out of the gate than any other kind of web two company like, period. Yeah, you call you, and then they're gonna take a stab at, oh, this is all speculation and casino money, guys. It's a business model gaming. We sell nfts, we sell games, you sell the people. The ability to swap assets, whatever. But the profitability and the scalability of web3 on a unit economic basis beats 99% of web two companies. And this is the power of permissionless distributed networks that reach the entire world in a very frictionless way.
00:57:04.784 - 00:57:51.734, Speaker B: Now, some people might call our regulatory arbitrage yada, yada, yada, but still, it is a very, like, uniswap is a very viable business model, more so than a traditional exchange and. Yeah, so anyways, we're back to fundamentals of, like, we need to focus on unit economics. And I think all I'm trying to say is web3 businesses have really interesting web, like, unit economics for any fundamental. Everyone now is putting on their fundamental investor hat. Okay, guys, I came into this industry being a fundamental SaaS investor, and I found unity economics to be one of the more interesting things and less talked about things in this industry. But I hope it gets more attention because it's really fascinating. We've observed in all these protocols.
00:57:51.734 - 00:57:55.714, Speaker B: Opensea even too. It's like, you know, hybrid company, last.
00:57:55.754 - 00:58:19.330, Speaker A: Thing, then we'll wrap this up. Jameson, Lopp and the Casa team, big shout out to nick over there too. Announced an expansion in. I'll just read Jameson's thing. Today, CaSA is excited to announce an expansion in our self sovereignty. As a service offering, we're bringing our best in class user experience to cold storage for ETH holders. Why is Kasa adding ETH support? Why now? Due to demand from current and prospective clients, that's why.
00:58:19.330 - 00:58:46.170, Speaker A: There's clearly a gap in the market for folks who have a need to easily and safely self custody significant amounts of value across BTC and ETH via one seamless interface. So for those who don't know. So CaSA is this great platform. I love Casa. Great, great platform to be able to self custody your bitcoin make it really, really easy to create a, to create a multisig to self custody or bitcoin. They never had anything else. They never let you do ETH or any other asset.
00:58:46.170 - 00:59:46.864, Speaker A: And one of the reasons for that, I would assume, not just reading between the lines, I've hung out with Nick and James in a little bit, but just reading between the lines here is they've got their user base. Are these hardcore bitcoin maxis. If you are running the company, you have to make a decision. Do we expand assets, get ETH people on board, and risk really making our core user base angry? Or do we just focus on our core user base? And this is Casa saying we're willing to make our core user base, some of these hardcore bitcoin maxis angry to expand. And this is just one of the cool things about the industry, about bear markets, is that people, I think people do what's right for their business and also, and also protocols come together and the industry comes together. So cost of supporting ETH is, I think, representative of that. And just like, man, I just, these bitcoin maxis are a complete joke in my mind.
00:59:46.864 - 00:59:49.552, Speaker A: I'm just going to say it like I'm reading some of these people were.
00:59:49.608 - 00:59:52.072, Speaker B: Not just bitcoin maxis, just maxis in general.
00:59:52.168 - 01:00:13.254, Speaker A: People are shitting. People are shitting on Casa. I know that team decently well at this point. Amazing people. Like, they're tweeting out, like, I'm just gonna read some of these. Sacrificing your morals is absolutely not acceptable. Like, like, how, you know, jameson, like, you, like, you three years ago was so upset about this.
01:00:13.254 - 01:00:17.278, Speaker A: I'm like, oh, my God. Like, people are like, fuck casa.
01:00:17.366 - 01:00:18.334, Speaker B: Bunch of larps.
01:00:18.414 - 01:00:32.254, Speaker A: Called it since the beginning, like, you. And I'm like, this is absurd. I love casa. Shout out, casa. I used to use casa actually, but I stopped because they didn't support ETH. So maybe I'll, maybe I'll use Casa again.
01:00:32.794 - 01:01:13.898, Speaker B: I hope this is a part of a bigger trend which is de politicizing the industry we've become. So I understand we're all tribal species inherently, and we have affiliations. It's one thing to be tribal, it's another to be just a toxic, maximalist, really rigid in your thinking. And I hope we, like, we move away from that. If we can learn something in this bear market is, let's just go back to fundamentals and the principle, the objective should always be furthering decentralization. And no matter what shape or form, color it comes in and I think the fact that cost assigning support for Ethereum is positive for Ethereum. It's positive for the decentralization of a theory.
01:01:13.898 - 01:01:44.752, Speaker B: And I think that is the most important thing. If you're a bitcoin, you don't necessarily have to believe in Ethereum to believe in why they're doing this is to bring more diversity into an ecosystem that needs it. And I think anyone can be kept behind that. So I would say that if anything, they're distinct, true. Their morals of enabling people to self custody. And hopefully, you know, and that is positive for the space. And so anyways, yeah, hopefully we can be less tribal, less, less max, less like toxic.
01:01:44.752 - 01:02:17.788, Speaker B: Coming out of all this bear market. I think this market has humbled a lot of people. And I think, you know, I'm not saying we have to all experience pain to learn, but you're seeing other people really, you know, experience pain. And so take that and learn from that. And hopefully we can all, you know, I don't want to say kumbaya and band together, but just remind yourself of the morals and why you're doing this. And I mean, I think the Casas mission and what, why they're doing this, you know, is not a betrayal in any way, shape or form.
01:02:17.916 - 01:02:36.846, Speaker A: Yeah. In bull markets, us versus them is protocol versus protocol. And in bull markets, it's protocol versus protocol. In bear markets, it's crypto versus everyone else. So, yeah, up against. What are you watching back there? What's on tv? What am I, what am I enjoying? Is that Biden?
01:02:36.940 - 01:02:40.130, Speaker B: This, Bloomberg? I love Bloomberg.
01:02:40.242 - 01:02:42.322, Speaker A: You have Bloomberg all the time, huh?
01:02:42.458 - 01:03:07.134, Speaker B: All the time. All the time. I love it. In fact, this is why it's been now more interesting in the whole FTX drama. They've, their coverage of crypto has gone up dramatically, and I've been fairly surprised at the commentary. Like, a lot of, they have a crypto, like every day they have a crypto sequence, like a show dedicated to crypto. And I think it do a fairly good, you know, coverage.
01:03:07.134 - 01:03:22.974, Speaker B: And unlike the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, they, they've increasingly, like, really, I think I've been fairly impressed, like, they've been calling FTX, like, and understanding the difference between that and decentralization and why decentralization matters.
01:03:23.014 - 01:04:14.306, Speaker A: Like, Bloomberg's done a really good job at it. Other media companies have not done a good job. I think, I have a feeling we'll see other media brands lay off their crypto teams as well. I think the crypto editorial teams and crypto reporters at mainstream publications are going to face some tough times over the next several months as those teams we saw it in 2018, 2019, it's going to happen again. The way it works, by the way, is if you're, I'm going to make up names here, but like a Vox or Business Insider, and you launch a crypto team, you're going to go to an etoro or an exchange and sponsor the year of ads for, on, like your crypto, on your crypto pages. They're going to struggle to sell those ads to crypto advertisers right now and they're going to not be able to make a business case for having crypto teams. Same thing that happened in 2018, 2019.
01:04:14.306 - 01:04:14.974, Speaker A: So.
01:04:15.394 - 01:04:37.466, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. The other publication that's been fairly, you know, objective or increasingly so is the Financial Times. Basically all non us. Non us. Well, I mean, of course blog works, but, you know, main, like non crypto native news outlets. I think Bloomberg Financial Times, fairly good.
01:04:37.490 - 01:04:40.014, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Coleman, shall we wrap?
01:04:41.274 - 01:05:07.424, Speaker B: Yeah, I think so. By the way, a shout out. Well, one recommendation, not a book. I recently started watching playlist on Netflix, which is the, like a mini series on the founder of Spotify. Fairly good, actually. It's a pretty good history of music, the music industry, Spotify. I think crypto people would love me, would enjoy it.
01:05:07.584 - 01:05:19.244, Speaker A: You know who I met yesterday was Alex Bloomberg. He started Gimlet and they sold to Spotify. He was telling me some interesting stuff about Spotify. It's a tough business model, but.
01:05:20.004 - 01:05:25.436, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Pioneers in the run, right? I think back in the day. Yeah, Spotify.
01:05:25.620 - 01:05:41.464, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm reading, I'm reading river of doubt about Teddy Roosevelt going down the Amazon, exploring the Amazon. Really interesting. You know who inspired me was man, long week. Been bad with names recently. Who's the one river guy? Eric.
01:05:42.644 - 01:05:45.236, Speaker B: Eric Peters. Survival guy. Eric Peters.
01:05:45.380 - 01:05:55.980, Speaker A: Yes. He. Remember at the end, he's like, yeah, my favorite books are survival books. So I read survival. Yeah. I read river of doubt by Teddy Roosevelt. I'm almost done with it.
01:05:55.980 - 01:06:00.788, Speaker A: Really good book. Would definitely recommend it. Teddy Roosevelt, absolute stud. Yeah.
01:06:00.836 - 01:06:17.986, Speaker B: One of my favorite speeches of all time, actually. My favorite's man in the arena by Ted Roosevelt. Fantastic man in the arena. And I guess on survival books, endurance, the story of Shackleton. Oh, yeah, Shackleton, like unbelievable. Probably one of the best. Yeah.
01:06:17.986 - 01:06:22.530, Speaker B: All the like, Antarctic and north pole expeditions are like, I have a. I.
01:06:22.562 - 01:06:24.034, Speaker A: Love these things, but endurance is a.
01:06:24.034 - 01:06:25.054, Speaker B: Really good one, too.
01:06:25.394 - 01:06:41.190, Speaker A: All right, folks, permissionless tickets still available. If not, you can go to the page and get the way. Get on the waitlist. Santi, I hope you got your ticket. No way you're getting in free after you rugged this last year. Um, it's a what?
01:06:41.342 - 01:06:51.174, Speaker B: Okay. All right. Okay. I deserve it, I guess. It's the 1 December, folks. So, uh, you know, we're coming into the end of the year. We're gonna have some really good episodes.
01:06:51.214 - 01:06:52.934, Speaker A: Coming up, including prediction episodes.
01:06:52.974 - 01:07:14.032, Speaker B: And a year, well, end of year reflection to see how bad my predictions, I think worse than probably anyone's been, including Jason beat me to this. And then, look, we'll attempt to do a crystal ball into next year. But look at this space. We can't even predict what's going to happen tomorrow. So anyways, guys, it's going to be a fun episode, but yeah.
01:07:14.128 - 01:07:21.944, Speaker A: Yeah. Hope you all have a good weekend. Good rest of your Friday. If you're listening to this on Friday, good weekend. And we'll see you Monday for the episode with Anatolia and Ben from Solana.
