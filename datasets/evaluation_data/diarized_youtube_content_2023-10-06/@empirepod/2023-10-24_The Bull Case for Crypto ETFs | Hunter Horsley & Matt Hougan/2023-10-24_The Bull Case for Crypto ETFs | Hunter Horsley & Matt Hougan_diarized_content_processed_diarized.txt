00:00:00.200 - 00:00:36.806, Speaker A: This episode is brought to you by Toku. If you are planning to launch a token, already have a live token. Are granting employees or contractors vesting token awards or just trying to figure out how to take care of taxable token events for your team. From easy to use token grant award templates, through tracking vesting to managing tax withholdings, make it simple today with Toku. Alright everyone, welcome back to another episode of Empire. We have a very timely episode today. Today we're recording this on the day that, uh, some bitcoin ETF news kind of spiked the market and then it turned out not to be true.
00:00:36.806 - 00:00:43.594, Speaker A: So we have Matt Hogan, CIO of Bitwise, and Hunter, uh, CEO, co founder of Bitwise Gents. Welcome to the show.
00:00:44.574 - 00:00:46.534, Speaker B: Thanks for having us. So good to be here.
00:00:46.654 - 00:01:02.986, Speaker A: Yeah, of course. Um, so how, I mean, how's, I got to ask, like, how's today been? I feel like, uh, Cointelegraph put out this news, that bitcoin ETF or was it the ETH? Yeah, bitcoin ETF is here and the market pumped and it turned out not to be true. So, yeah, I mean, how was today? What happened?
00:01:03.090 - 00:01:39.348, Speaker B: Man? I'll, I'll answer that and then Hunter can build on. Sometimes you wake up in this industry and you just want to shake your head. This is unfortunate. It's fortunate that I got corrected quickly, right? Got corrected within 30 minutes. But man, you do hate to see this. You know, it's probably some low level newer reporter who misunderstood something and posted something, but you get this massive reaction in the market. I do think this is a pre roll of what we're going to see in the future.
00:01:39.348 - 00:01:52.214, Speaker B: I do think we're on the pathway. I'm optimistic we're on the pathway towards the spot bitcoin ETF, as you guys know. But we really didn't need this this morning. This is not what I wanted to wake up to on Monday morning. I don't know about Hunter.
00:01:54.314 - 00:02:29.274, Speaker C: Yeah, I agree. I think the crypto community rightly is fascinated with the filings and the filing process for ETF's. We run an ETF news bulletin service through our website where we keep people updated. I think there's a lot of enthusiasm for knowing when things will happen, but it's also a very technical and narrow subject matter, the filing process. And I think sometimes people misinterpret things. So I think that was the story today, but glad the loop was closed pretty quickly.
00:02:29.574 - 00:02:31.954, Speaker A: Yeah, a lot of shorts got wiped out, huh?
00:02:33.374 - 00:02:34.434, Speaker B: One or two.
00:02:35.494 - 00:03:00.030, Speaker A: Not great. Matt. I actually wanted to start pre crypto land, one of my favorite things to talk about with you is, and for those who don't know, Matt's been a longtime advisor to blockworks. Matt, one of the things I love to talk about with you is just, you ran ETF's dot dot, right. Pre pre crypto days. And I love to almost hear from you about, like, the mainstreamization of ETF's. Not the bitcoin ETF, but ETF's.
00:03:00.030 - 00:03:27.876, Speaker A: Because I was, when you, when you pull up old news articles, right, some of these headlines, Financial Times called ETF's weapons of mass destruction, I was reading something. You will be able to explain this much better to me. But they folks thought there was going to be this liquidity doom loop and that ETF's could take down the bond market. So can you just maybe talk to us about, like, the early days of ETF's and what similarities you see to just bitcoin ETF's and what's happening today?
00:03:28.020 - 00:04:02.084, Speaker B: Yeah, that's exactly right. Even more than that, there were congressional hearings, literally, about ETF's destroying american entrepreneurialism and ending the american dream. As you mentioned, they were weapons of mass destruction. They were called efTs. No one knew what they were. And yeah, this liquidity doom loop, I mean, to back up what an ETF is, is an evolution of financial technology. So for 100 years, people invested through mutual funds that allowed them to access the market once a day.
00:04:02.084 - 00:04:41.610, Speaker B: And that created a sort of shared collective experience of taxation. If we all own mutual funds and you sold Jason, I would pay the taxes on that at the end of the year. This is a ridiculous idea, but this was the best technology they could develop in 1920, and nothing improved it until the early nineties, when they came up with this idea of ETF. And ETF was threatening to a huge chunk of the financial services industry. There were massive companies built on traditional mutual funds. There were massive companies built on trading bonds which trade over the phone and not on a screen. And an ETF threatened all that.
00:04:41.610 - 00:05:10.110, Speaker B: And then for two reasons, people were very worried about it. One, I think because it was so disruptive, because it was going to slash margins and profits and prices. And then two, because it was new and people didn't know exactly how it would turn out. People were hugely skeptical of it. And they were skeptical of it not just for a year or two years, not just through one stress test or two stress tests. They were skeptical of it for 20 years. I am not joking.
00:05:10.110 - 00:05:56.110, Speaker B: We see the crypto industry hauled before Congress and made to answer questions about the fundamentals of crypto. We see congresspeople asking ridiculous questions and talking about bitcom and mispronouncing names. All of that is a replay to me of what we saw. We saw congresspeople hall, Blackrock in front of of congressional hearings. You and talk about this liquidity doom loop that could end the bond market and throw millions out of work. We saw the head of the CEWs and Invesco and leading lawyers come before and be asked about, isn't this robbing small companies of the ability to come to market? It was absolutely absurd. Then you fast forward today, and it's the mother's milk of investing.
00:05:56.110 - 00:06:10.790, Speaker B: It's how literally almost every american gets access to the market today. It's a $7 trillion industry. No one questions it. Every major company has come on board. And I think we're going to go through the same journey on crypto. Right. Huge amount of skepticism.
00:06:10.790 - 00:06:33.914, Speaker B: We're starting to see that turn. I think we're at that moment. You're starting to see BlackRock wanting to launch a spot bitcoin ETF investo launching a spot bitcoin es UBs tokenizing bonds. We're seeing that change. In two or three years, there'll be no more congressional hearings. People will be just talking about how much more efficient this made the market. So history always repeats and it's repeating with crypto.
00:06:34.074 - 00:06:59.230, Speaker D: Can you give us a little bit of, for folks that are not familiar, I mean, the ETF discussion has been around for multiple years, and it's constantly been dismissed by the SEC for a variety of reasons. But I think there's a common denominator. And maybe it would love for you to go into kind of the reasons why the SEC says, hey, look, the market's pretty premature. There's a whole host of reasons why they deny these applications. So maybe if you could just give us a little bit of context for listeners, it'd be great.
00:06:59.302 - 00:07:36.274, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, it's worth noting that the first spot bitcoin ETF application was filed on July 1, 2013. And if we're being honest, the market was not ready for a spot bitcoin ETF in July of 2013. There were no institutional custodians. There were no trading firms that could make markets in it, and the market was more subject to manipulation than it is today. So for the first, let's say, five or six or seven years, the SEC had reasonable cause to deny a spot bitcoin ETF. They've been focused specifically on this question of market manipulation.
00:07:36.274 - 00:08:33.676, Speaker B: And to be a little bit more precise, in order to approve an ETF, the SEC wants to be able to look at the market and surveil for market manipulation. So if someone tries to monkey with the price, they can figure out who did it and prosecute it, and therefore reduce the likelihood of market manipulation. So in the stock market, if someone tries to manipulate the market, they can ask the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq, who profited from this trade and shut it down. In the crude oil market, if someone tries to manipulate the price of crude oil, they can see who is trading crude oil futures and prosecute that. The idea is that that reduces the likelihood of market manipulation. The challenge in crypto is for a long time, there was no one you could ask who is on the other side of these trades profiting from this issue. The reason the argument in favor of a spot bitcoin ETF is now so strong is you have people to surveil.
00:08:33.676 - 00:09:03.666, Speaker B: You can surveil the CME bitcoin futures market. Firms like BlackRock are looking for surveillance sharing agreements with Coinbase. This market is just much more institutional than it was in 2013. Or, honestly, even when we started pushing for a spot bitcoin ETF, which was back in 2018 and 2019, the market has come a long way, and I think those manipulation concerns are now solved, in my view, and we'll see if the SEC agrees in the coming months.
00:09:03.850 - 00:09:58.804, Speaker D: When you look at a day like today, where there's fake news of an ETF approval, and there's $100 million of long and shorts being liquidated in a span of a couple of minutes, you look at that and say, that's definitely someone, whether it's a stupid intern or actually something more behind that. Time and time again, we do wonder if there is a coordinated action amongst crypto whales, if you will. Now, a lot of that is hard to prove, but I think you have tools at your disposal, like chain analysis and others that can allow you to trace. I mean, at the end of the day, it's transparent ledger. Anyone can inspect. So presumably you'd be able to understand who and how this manipulation is taking place. But the thing that I want to get your take on is this is an international market, whereas an ETF, as we think about it in the US, is just kind of, you know, I guess there are international participants, but everything is settling kind of in a.
00:09:58.804 - 00:10:13.304, Speaker D: In more, I don't know, controlled environment, if you will. Whereas the crypto markets are 24 7365 everywhere. Does that worry the SEC? Is that because or is that not, does that, does that not compute?
00:10:15.204 - 00:10:52.128, Speaker B: It makes sense that they would be worried about it. But it's important to note two things. One is that all markets are subject to this sort of action, right? So you can see in the equity market, people putting out fake press releases about mergers and prices going up. You can see news in the gold or oil market that leads to prices that turns out not to be true. So this happens. And I think that point about the gold or oil market is directly analogous here. The SEC doesn't have perfect purview over the gold market, which trades on 47th street, trades in London, trades in India, and retail settings.
00:10:52.128 - 00:11:33.222, Speaker B: They can't penetrate all of that. But the reason they've allowed a spot bitcoin ETF to approve is even though there may be these micro inefficiencies in the market, the big market is mature enough that you can surveil it. You can look at the Comex gold futures market, you can have confidence in the London spot fixing price. And even if there's things on the edges, the market as a whole is okay. And I think that's true with bitcoin as well. Even if you can't see through to every small startup exchange, the market as a whole now has this, the surface level of institutionalization. The CME bitcoin futures market is large and established.
00:11:33.222 - 00:11:48.994, Speaker B: You mentioned chainalysis lets you penetrate down the market. There's AML KYC at major spot exchanges. And so it doesn't have to be perfect to allow a spot bitcoin ETF to exist. It just needs to meet their requirements. And I think we're at the point where it does.
00:11:51.414 - 00:12:23.166, Speaker A: What does the introduction of Spot ETF's actually do to an industry? And Matt, picking on you a lot here for, for the ETF questions. But Hunter, I want to get to you on some financial advisor questions in a second. But Matt, one more to you is so you were running ETf.com comma just a couple years after the first gold ETF was introduced, right? I think that was 2004. You were running ETf.com and I think 2007 8910 for a couple of years. Then what does it actually do to an industry into a market, and almost to like a market structure to have an ETF introduced 100%.
00:12:23.230 - 00:13:04.714, Speaker B: And I was writing about ETF's even before the spot gold ETF and talking about it giving speeches. It completely transforms the industry. I actually think people understate the long term impact of a spot bitcoin ETF on the market. And I'll give you the gold analogy today, we all think of gold as this deeply institutional asset. Like without peer, it's almost the most institutional asset. Oh, if we can only have gold in the portfolio, there's nothing more solid, nothing more established, established, nothing more suits and ties and bankers than gold. But before the spot bitcoin ETF that really, really deeply wasn't true.
00:13:04.714 - 00:13:40.654, Speaker B: Gold was the land of tinfoil hats and crazy people stockpiling baked beans and guns and putting gold bars underneath their mattress. It was not held by mainstream institutions. You wouldn't have pensions having conversations with gold. There were no mutual funds that allowed you to get exposure to gold. There were almost no gold mining funds. You couldn't bring it up in common conversation. There were tiny gold conferences that were attended mostly by retail investors, where people were excited about krugerrands and different coins.
00:13:40.654 - 00:14:26.580, Speaker B: And then you had a gold etf. And all of a sudden, over a period about three to four years, it transformed into what it is today, which is this institutional asset. The other thing that happened, and this is no guarantee that this will happen in bitcoin. But the price of gold went up eleven years in a row, which it had never done in modern history. You can go back as far as you can in modern pricing, at least in us dollars, and you won't find an eleven year string. And the reason was, over that eleven year span, $100 billion flowed into those gold ETF's, and it didn't disrupt the other demand for gold. People often wonder if a spot bitcoin ETF will disrupt retail demand for bitcoin through other means.
00:14:26.580 - 00:14:52.324, Speaker B: That's not what gold shows us. Investment into gold bars, investment in gold jewelry stayed the same. And you just added this institutional piece on top. So it really can be transformative for an asset class. I think it will be transformative for bitcoin. I think there will be before ETF and a post ETF. And even though it will take a few years, I think people underestimate the impact a few years from now of what this will do to the market.
00:14:53.184 - 00:15:37.324, Speaker A: What about on the demand? All right, so what that gold story tells you, eleven years in a row, is that there was just a gross market mispricing due to a lack of a vehicle, basically, that gave investors. So maybe, Hunter, this is the time to throw it to you. I know you're in a su posting on LinkedIn about all your meetings and stuff with financial advisors and institutions and Rias, I'd love for you to almost take Santi and I into the room with these folks because there are a lot of reasons not to buy crypto right now, or not to buy bitcoin. There's FTX, or maybe there's tether FUD, or there's binance FUD, or there's regulatory reasons. And bitcoin ETF, or lack of an ETF, is probably just another one of those reasons. Can you just take us into those conversations and cover as much as you want to cover here?
00:15:37.624 - 00:16:22.096, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. My pleasure to do that. We love spending time with clients, bit wise, as you know, works to help investment professionals understand and access the opportunities in crypto. So you see my posts on LinkedIn about doing that. Maybe it was the Barron's conference a few weeks ago. The way to imagine the investment professional generally in this moment is that they have 99 problems, and crypto is just one of them. So for all of us in crypto, I think the four of us included, we spend a lot of time, and it's our job to spend time understanding the day to day developments, the trajectory, what each development means for the opportunity set and the thesis.
00:16:22.096 - 00:17:25.617, Speaker C: But for most of our clients, they're overseeing portfolios of every asset class. It could be stocks, bonds, international markets, alternatives, real estate, venture, private equity, et cetera. And those markets are undergoing a lot of change right now, both in the outlook because of macro concerns about inflation and recessions, and also because just year to date, the performance has been confusing to many, and they're not sure if they should go risk on should they be buying the Nasdaq when it's up 30% year to date, or should they be selling it. So they have those questions on the investment side to wrestle with. And then depending on the type of investment professional, if you're an institution, then this may not be the case. If you're a financial advisor wealth manager, you're also thinking about your practice, your conversations with clients, growing your practice. And so between those two things, you have a pretty busy slate day to day.
00:17:25.617 - 00:18:14.874, Speaker C: And I think that's sort of an essential backdrop to imagine. When you imagine the conversation that we have with clients who are thinking about the space, they have it on a to do list is just to think about the fact that the to do list is very long. How do those conversations actually go? So I'll give you a few stories. I was with an advisor who's at a billion dollar plus Ra, which is an independent advisory firm. That's what that term refers to, not associated with a bank or a broker dealer. And they manage about a billion dollars in assets, and that's been growing a lot, and they're really excited about that. They're wrestling with clients wanting to meet over Zoom versus in person if they should be expanding their footprint to different states.
00:18:14.874 - 00:19:10.384, Speaker C: But one of the principals of that firm a few years ago attended a talk that we gave on crypto and saw the unique opportunity for their clients to put a low correlation and high growth potential asset into the portfolios and the unique role that that could play both through an academic lens and through a client lens. And so over time, they built a 2% sleeve across all clients. They use one of our products for that sleeve and then rely on us for research on the space. But they're sort of on one end of the spectrum where they have built things out. They have addressed the crypto opportunity, and now they're trying to stay up to date with what's happening in the market, but have only so much time for that. So they want to know when there's something important that they need to understand. On the other end of the spectrum, we have.
00:19:10.384 - 00:19:36.586, Speaker C: We have thousands of conversations per quarter, and I think for many advisors, the state of play in crypto is. It's interesting, but we don't have time to do something right now, or the way that this is sometimes expressed is we're waiting to see what happens with the spot bitcoin ETF, which is the same as saying, we're waiting a little bit longer to see.
00:19:36.610 - 00:19:49.494, Speaker D: Are you actually hearing from them? We are waiting for an ETF to put money, or is the demand really dried up? Because I'm just curious, how much demand and capital is there chomping just on the sidelines, waiting for the ETF?
00:19:49.884 - 00:20:37.796, Speaker C: Yeah, it's a great question. I think it probably comes up in a fourth to a third of our client conversations. The demand and prospective demand is massive. I think it'll be the most important development the industry has had for traditional investment professionals because of the benefits that the ETF wrapper provides, the regulatory benefits and comfort with compliance and disclosures, as well as the simplicity. Each of these firms is operating on a stack of trading, reporting, accounting compliance, and so on and so forth that is really well suited to the ETF wrapper, for which a lot of other wrappers are a bit harder. So I think it'll be a breakthrough moment. Matt, is there anything you'd add to that?
00:20:37.900 - 00:21:33.716, Speaker B: Yeah, I just wanted to add one important piece of context, which is, if you want to think about wealth in America, you should think about it in three buckets. There's sort of self directed retail people trading on their own. There's financial advisors, people helping other people invest, and there's institutional capital, pensions and endowments. And the breakdown of wealth is about 20% self directed, 40% advisors, and 40% institutions. And if you think about crypto going from zero to a trillion dollars, it's been built almost entirely on that left bucket, the self directed retail investors, the smallest bucket by far, and it maybe isn't fully penetrated there, but it's made some penetration. But these other two buckets are either single digits in terms of their growth. And what an ETF will do is it will allow those two other buckets, 80% of the market, to gravitate up to where self directed retail is.
00:21:33.716 - 00:21:46.512, Speaker B: And that's why it's so important. It's just a scale game. We talk so much about these self directed retail investors. They're loud, there's a lot of media coverage of them, but they're really the smallest segment of the market. Most of the money is in these other two buckets, which is what the.
00:21:46.528 - 00:22:32.356, Speaker D: ETF serves, who are like the biggest winners in the event of an approval of an ETF. I mean, you have, obviously, a custodian like Coinbase, you have multiple different players. You have you guys that have an index. I'm just sort of curious how you think about, obviously, grayscale, which if you look at the premium historically, it traded these products, GBTC, ETH and others traded at a premium. And that was, for me, I just read into that that's just a convenience factor that people just want to kind of, they're willing to trade illiquidity and pay a premium because they don't want to do it themselves, they don't want to self custody, they don't want to set up and spin up a full operation. Now, of course, that's trading at a discount, but compressing. So I'm curious how you think about like, the shifting kind of tectonic plates.
00:22:32.356 - 00:22:39.304, Speaker D: Once you have an approval of an ETF, what does that do to the existing kind of players, including you guys going forward?
00:22:41.924 - 00:23:46.692, Speaker C: I just want to build on something that you just said, Santiago, around the role of a product like GBTC, because I think it reemphasizes a point here that is very helpful to understanding why an ETF is so important for Matt laid out the different constituents. For many constituents in capital markets writ large, there's actually, it's not just convenient, it's that there's no alternative. If you're a financial advisor, you cannot open a Coinbase account for a client. So if you want to support a client getting exposure, if you want to take care of that for them, the same way you're taking care of emerging markets and growth and real estate and munis and their financial plan and their taxes and their reporting, if you want to embrace crypto as part of that, and sometimes clients ask for it or demand it, you don't have a way of buying bitcoin directly. By and large. Of course we have smas and a few other things today that are becoming possible. But historically, these publicly traded products and their ETF's as well now are the only way.
00:23:46.692 - 00:25:00.914, Speaker C: So I think you said the right thing there and I would just even dial it up further from convenience to only option in many cases. So I think that's one of the reasons, and a reason that sometimes people underestimate the size of the breakthrough here, because it's not just going from good to better or good to more convenient, but actually going from, in some cases, not possible to possible. And that's a big deal. As to the question about who the winners are, I think one of the reasons that we've been in the space for six or seven years now and have tried to be good stewards of the space and of course play our role in helping people understand it and its merits, I think that one of the reasons it's so exciting to see the whole industry sort of rally around an effort like a bitcoin ETF, which we've been working on for a very long time, is that I think that almost the entire industry and investor base will benefit from this development. It does a lot to bring credibility and maturation to the space. There you go. You got the thumbs up rearing its head there.
00:25:00.914 - 00:25:06.366, Speaker C: Yeah, let's see it. Let's see it.
00:25:06.510 - 00:25:08.926, Speaker A: This is your trigger to go watch on YouTube, folks.
00:25:09.030 - 00:25:10.054, Speaker B: Oh my gosh.
00:25:10.214 - 00:26:22.994, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it does a lot to build that comfort, that people can participate in a mature and mainstream way which enhances the credibility of the whole industry. I think, of course, all of the parties involved in managing these products, be it the issuers like bitwise custodians, like Coinbase, even administrators like bank of New York Mellon, who will be the administrator on funds, or New York Stock Exchange, which would be our listing venue, all benefit. And then investors benefit. Hugely existing investors who took the harder path of getting access before it unlocked for a broader set of investors. Then of course, new investors who can really benefit from the low correlation, the high growth potential, but haven't had a workable way of incorporating that. So I know it's not the most intriguing answer, but I think it's the reason that there's so much unified enthusiasm for this development is that I think it's a tie that will lift the whole industry. Much like Matt mentioned, the first gold ETF in 2004 really did a lot to lift the maturation of that space as well.
00:26:23.974 - 00:26:26.726, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, of course. Go ahead, Matt. I don't know if you wanted.
00:26:26.830 - 00:27:06.172, Speaker B: I was just going to build on that one, maybe nuance on top of that. There's some people who think the large companies will come in from traditional finance and win the space in this new, more mature market, and I think they'll get their fair share. It is worth noting that historically that's not what tends to happen. To go back to the ETF example, Jason. In the early days of the ETF, it was developed by a company called Barclays Global Investors and they became the dominant player. Eventually got acquired by BlackRock. When we talk about BlackRock leading ETF's today, it's because they bought this small shop that managed really very little money, called Barclays, that came up with this idea and grew it substantially.
00:27:06.172 - 00:27:34.202, Speaker B: The other winners were firms like Powershares or State street Global Advisors, which is part of a big company but not a giant player. And in ETF land, that is true. Often in these niche markets, you see the large companies come in, but it's the specialists that more than hold the ground. So I think Hunter is right. It will benefit everyone. It will benefit the ecosystem, both the existing specialist players and the larger financial firms that are coming in.
00:27:34.338 - 00:27:39.414, Speaker A: Have you guys ever been approached by someone like a JP Morgan or a BlackRock for an acquisition?
00:27:42.974 - 00:28:46.054, Speaker C: We have relationships with lots of large traditional firms and find that to be productive. But my viewpoint is that to play the most productive role for our clients, having a full time focus on crypto is imperative. As you guys know, so much happens in a 24 hours span. Clients have a very limited aperture of time, but need to know the important things that are happening. And so the confidence that comes from having a partner like Bitwise, who's looking at the space twenty four seven and is always week to week there to talk about it, I think is the essential element. A challenge that traditional firms have is, of course, they need to be talking to clients about short duration income this week and how the yield curve is developing. And that is actually in many cases, or most cases, the most important thing that they need to be talking to their clients about.
00:28:46.054 - 00:29:52.122, Speaker C: And there's a prioritization challenge. When you take that, and then, of course, you add to it what's happening in commercial real estate right now? Are there any developments? There is private credit, something that I should be prioritizing. What's the house view on venture? Should I be in value or should I be pushing out and tilting towards growth? All of those questions are imperative for a broader portfolio in which crypto is a 1% to 5% allocation. So if you're an investment professional, how do you surround yourself with a set of relationships that is going to make sure that you have a vector into everything you need to know? And I think a reason that we have been able to lead in this category, and our client base has over doubled in the last 18 months. The information is not public generally, but I suspect we have the broadest client base of investment professionals in America today, is because people value knowing for certain that we will always be monitoring the latest in crypto, and they can tap into that at any moment in time. And we're never going to not talk about something important because we had some other priority.
00:29:52.258 - 00:30:30.356, Speaker D: Yeah, I'm just curious. We have the ETF. The SEC had until yesterday to dismiss, or I guess, what's the right word? Appeal one of the applications, and they didn't. Now, there was a couple of folks that said, whoa, okay. This means that at some point between now and January Q one, like there will be an approval. My understanding is that's not, it's not as straightforward. They can find other reasons not to approve an ETF, although maybe on the margin they're running out of reasons.
00:30:30.356 - 00:30:48.784, Speaker D: But I am curious, as you guys think about that, is it true? How do you see that path unfolding for the approval and any perhaps potential reasons why the SEC may not or continue to reject these applications?
00:30:49.684 - 00:31:26.250, Speaker B: Yeah, sure, I can jump in. We, of course, can't talk about Bitwise's application or any application, but we can talk generally about the space. It is the case that the way to think of this grayscale lawsuit and the focus on market manipulation is that that's necessary but not sufficient to allow an ETF to come to market. So it's a hurdle you have to clear. But there are other hurdles you also have to clear. Some of those hurdles have to do with custody and how you store bitcoin. Some of them have to do with trading and how you acquire bitcoin, and then some have to do with disclosures and other items.
00:31:26.250 - 00:31:58.796, Speaker B: So there are these other hurdles that issuers have to jump over. But it is worth noting that you have a large number of issuers from very reputable firms focused on this space. And so I'm optimistic that we'll get there. Much more optimistic than I've been at any other time during our five year journey. But there's no guarantee. There is no guarantee that we will get there by January 10, which is the date that the Ark fund has to be approved. And many people think they'll line up all the funds.
00:31:58.796 - 00:32:15.460, Speaker B: There's no guarantee we'll get there by March, which is when most of the applications have to be approved. There's no guarantee that we'll get there at all. But I am optimistic. And I think the balance of arguments is on the side of pushing this over the line, which would be great, as Hunter mentioned, for investors.
00:32:15.572 - 00:32:49.374, Speaker D: Yeah, there is a criticism on just generally ETF's. And Matt, you correct me here, but there's this idea that in general markets have become complacent and you have huge firms that just most of the capital that ends up acquiring a substantial ownership in these companies is very passive. You're not voting, you're not paying attention to what's happening. Whereas before ETF's there's more direct relationship with the owner. There was more perhaps oversight of managers. Principal agent problem. Yada, yada, yada.
00:32:49.374 - 00:33:37.614, Speaker D: There is a contingent within the space that says ETF's have actually been damaging to corporate governance and generally how these companies are managed. I am curious, when you apply that lens and argument to crypto in a world where there's a lot of ETF's, you do certainly shift more towards a centralized version of ownership of these things as it relates to proof of stake. Even worse, because then there is even more centralization of a particular token that needs to be staked. So I am curious how you think about that one. Do you actually agree with that argument that ETF's can lead to that complacency in the market? And how does that apply to crypto in a steady state where there's a bunch of ETF's?
00:33:37.774 - 00:34:14.278, Speaker B: Yeah, great question. The first part, the answer is no. It's one of those seductive arguments, because if you take it to its extremes, of course it is true. If 100% of the equity market is passively managed, then there is no governance and no incentive to innovate, and there's potentials for collusion. In fact, when the first index fund launched in the 1970s, there was this huge advertising campaign calling index funds un american. So this argument has been around for 50 years. It fails as long as there is a sufficient portion of the market that is actively engaged in the product.
00:34:14.278 - 00:35:08.093, Speaker B: Right. So while it's true at 100%, it's probably not true at 50%, it's probably not even true at 80 or 90%, because the active sleeve will still have that incentive to profit from being aggressive and managing it on the governance side. Yeah, I just don't, it's again, seductive because at 100% it would be absolutely true. But I just don't think that's the way the market will mature. There's nothing about an ETF that prevents people from owning bitcoin directly, that prevents them from owning their own keys. And it's a little bit like those arguments that the crypto industry is too concentrated today, that assume that a wallet that belongs to Coinbase represents one owner, when in fact it represents millions. And that will be true in the ETF space as well.
00:35:08.093 - 00:35:15.654, Speaker B: A seductive argument, but not one that I think holds water in the real world.
00:35:17.234 - 00:35:58.356, Speaker A: This episode is brought to you by Toku. Toku makes implementing global token compensation and incentive awards simple. With Toku, you get unmatched tax and legal support to grant and administer your global team's tokens. From easy to use token grant award templates. Through token vesting to managing tax withholdings, Toku understands every grant structure. Token purchase agreements, restricted token awards, restricted token units, token options, token appreciation rights, and even phantom tokens. For legal, finance and HR teams, it is a huge, complex task to have to comply with global regulations around compensating people with tokens.
00:35:58.356 - 00:36:28.724, Speaker A: Not to mention the payroll tax obligations, tax reporting in every country that you employ someone, it is difficult, time consuming, manual and costly. And it is drawing more and more attention from regulators and governments. Toku makes this simple for leading teams across the space. Protocol labs, DyDx Foundation, Mina Foundation, Hedera Gnosis, safe Gitcoin, and a lot more. Reach out to toku@toku.com empire or click the link in the description.
00:36:30.464 - 00:37:33.258, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, you have right now in crypto a lot of like delegators, right? People can or validators and people delegate. Most of the people are delegating, right? And if you look at Ethereum, like Lido for instance, has 30 ish, 37 33% of all Ethereum being delegated to their network of validators as it relates to corporate governance. If you could just refresh our memory, if you own a ETF and you want to get involved in, you know, there's a annual shareholder meeting of Walmart and you have a particularly strong opinion on how they should do X or Y or the director that the director that are being, correct me here, but most of the time, or if not all ETF's allow you to submit the vote or do they withhold some of that and then they vote on the behalf of kind of the constituent base and then of course, how does that kind of translate into crypto? Right.
00:37:33.386 - 00:38:10.826, Speaker B: Yeah, the answer is it's changing. In the past it was held exclusively through the asset manager, and now through the application of various sort of fintech technologies and solutions, you're getting more pass through voting and more individualized holding. It's a solvable problem that's being solved actively in the market, and I suspect the same thing would be true in the crypto market. But the overwhelmingly important thing is that people who are frustrated with the position that these centralized entities are taking can simply sell and redeem and then buy it directly themselves. Right.
00:38:10.970 - 00:38:16.274, Speaker D: Some tax implications. So there's on the margin, some disincentive.
00:38:16.314 - 00:38:52.804, Speaker B: If you will, to be sure. Yes, to be sure, it's absolutely true. And if you thought that these ETF's were going to vacuum up 80% of the bitcoin in the world, again, I think you might be worried about this. But in reality what this is going to do is it's going to capture a sleeve of bitcoin from owners who are probably not prepared to take active governance positions. I think it's a theoretical concern, I'll admit that, but it's not one that practically concerns me. The bitcoin community is strong.
00:38:53.344 - 00:40:26.404, Speaker C: I would also just chime in with the perspective that I think it will be a huge boon for this base to have more and more assets with a long only asset manager like bitwise, through vehicles like ETF's. If you think about the very productive role that Coinbase plays as a steward and a tent pole for the industry, advocating and investing in its long term health and in its development. A long only product, so a product that doesn't make active investment decisions, doesn't go short, is structurally aligned with the space's health and progress over time, and has a very long term time horizon, isn't necessarily thinking about three month windows or six month windows or even year long windows. So I think that in a subtle way, one of the real benefits, as long only asset managers or long biased asset managers accumulate larger and larger stakes on behalf of their clients, is our incentive is absolutely to support the development of the ecosystem and the flourishing and maturation of the ecosystem. We do that in a number of ways. But I think that having more tent poles like that for the space will be a very productive thing. In the same way you've seen Coinbase be so productive, even outside of just its day to day business and the role that it plays in advocating for the space.
00:40:27.024 - 00:41:46.594, Speaker D: Can we talk about maybe as someone that is listening to this conversation might be skeptical and say, hey, you've had all these blow ups, you've had exchanges or folks like Blockfi and Voyager and that have, for variety of reasons, blown up, and then the skepticism might be, well, what happens? And how do you prove that whoever's operating said ETF is actually managing keys correctly and setting up a secure infrastructure and using a registered or custodian, if you will, and maybe has insurance and has proof of reserves. Like, I assume all of this is part of the application process. Like you need to kind of show your competency and the service providers that you're using. But there's still like the tail risk as it relates to kind of generating enough entropy and managing your keys. Like there is a risk of, you know, someone being hacked and then, oh, all of a sudden investors are at a loss there and there's very limited insurance in the space still. So maybe it's kind of a wild goose chase where it's not that much of a problem, but I'm curious if you believe kind of what your opinion is on that.
00:41:46.754 - 00:42:34.804, Speaker B: Yeah, I can jump in, Hunter can build on it. It's a reasonable question. It's worth noting that ETF's have existed in crypto around the world for a large number of years. In Scandinavia, in Germany, in Canada, in Brazil, in other markets successfully stewarding investor capital. It is these well regulated, well documented entities that have to go through multiple approval processes that have regulation in place that provides the safety that investors want. And it's actually the case, conversely, that the inability for crypto native entities in the past to access traditional financial services has led to many of the blow ups that we've had in the past. So this is strictly a positive development from my point of view, in terms of the safety of the products that investors can access.
00:42:34.804 - 00:42:45.844, Speaker B: And yes, of course, there's a huge amount of work and discussions to go through in order to set up these investment vehicles that help build that trust and secure and make it very real.
00:42:46.384 - 00:43:19.964, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, I guess you see these blow ups, right? There's like, there are a ton of commodities out there where like, JP Morgan is buying copper or nickel, and it turns out to be like, not, not even real. Like, I mean, it's like an edge case, but, you know, there's always a risk, but to your point's a really good one, which is on the margin. Like, what's better, the existing lack of an ETF or with an ETF? Well, for most. Most of the time, you're going to be better off using an ETF product, because the reality is most people are not sophisticated enough to kind of do it themselves.
00:43:20.984 - 00:43:57.554, Speaker C: I would just. I would just add to it. And Santiago, I also want to say these are fantastic questions, and I'm actually really enjoying. I think a lot of people are familiar with ETF as a concept, but haven't pulled back the layers like you're doing. And Matt knows it better than anyone. So I think, great questions. I think when you think about the benefits from a peace of mind and security perspective with an ETF, there's actually a bunch of layers that stack on top of each other that really results in something that allows an investor to say, I want exposure to crypto.
00:43:57.554 - 00:44:48.618, Speaker C: And I can sigh a bit of relief that I don't have to worry week to week that it's going to disappear or blow up. Just to illustrate some of those layers, on our website we have a page called the professional approach that details some of these. But you have a qualified custodian, which means a custodian with regulatory oversight. You then have an administrator. So a third party, in the case of an ETF, bank of New York Mellon, as an example, who will go in and mark the value of those assets via a published methodology for how they're valuing those assets. That is described in detail in the prospectus. Then you have an auditor who will confirm that the administrator and the assets were described accurately.
00:44:48.618 - 00:46:01.434, Speaker C: Then on top of that, you have an issuer who is overseeing all of this and can actively take action and intervene if there is any development that needs to be addressed. We did that over the course of managing assets for the past six years. We've, I think, have a great track record of navigating these situations, avoiding FTX, Blockfi, Genesis, Luna, BNB, FTT. So then you have the issuer, then a layer up from that. You have the sort of regulatory piece, you have the disclosures, so you have the requirements of an ETF to disclose risks, to disclose financial reporting, and all of those things stack together. And I think that that picture as a whole is really important. When you think about stories like the developments and some of the claims about FTX, it's not just that they necessarily lost the password or something, right? There was potential misrepresentation not enough third party eyes or audits on the information.
00:46:01.434 - 00:46:42.706, Speaker C: I think with an ETF, you not only get the best regulated service providers and solutions, but you also get the benefit of many eyes on the information and what's happening across that whole stack that I just described. And I think that that is in, again, an idiosyncratic and subtle way, a huge benefit to the protection that an investor can have. And it's one of the reasons that matt and I think others say that an ETF would be an amazing benefit to american investors, because it offers that combination of protection layers that can be really useful in a space like crypto.
00:46:42.730 - 00:47:13.726, Speaker D: And in general, yeah, I mean, certainly we know a lot of retail just holds other coins and exchanges. And in traditional finance, that's not the case. There's clearly more divisions of all the different kind of components when you're buying and then you're custodian. And so anyways, yeah, certainly it would be much safer, I think we could all agree, if they held an ETF. Now, the reality is we're likely going to go baby steps here. Maybe I'm curious what you think of the sequence. Bitcoin first, then Ethereum.
00:47:13.726 - 00:48:05.604, Speaker D: Ethereum has a little bit more complications because of the yield and stake and perhaps some liquidity component attached to that. But like in ETF land, I think you saw a similar progression. Now you see all kinds of flavors of ETF's. You know, you go three x long rates and three x long a particular sector, and there's just a very sort of a plethora of products. How do you think this space evolves? What's the sequence and timeline of the type of ETF's that we may see kind of in a year from now, three years from now, 510 years from now. And I kind of want to ask that, because you guys have, if I look at the progression of the type of products you've offered over the years, it's been interesting to observe. You've tried to compose certain indices and.
00:48:05.604 - 00:48:09.364, Speaker D: Yeah, I'm curious how you think about that.
00:48:10.704 - 00:49:07.552, Speaker C: Maybe I could comment on our point of view, and Matt, you could maybe share a little bit about specific products that you mentioned. Santiago, I think it's a great question, just to zoom out for a second on Bitwise's point of view. Our view, as I've sort of described, is that investment professionals have very limited time for the space, not because they're disinterested, but because they have so many responsibilities. And for us to be the best partner to them, we need to work to make sure that whenever there's a useful way of accessing the space, that we are bringing that forth so that they have the opportunity to consider it and benefit from it. So if you look at the history of Bitwise, we got started in 2017 with a private crypto index fund. And since then, every time we've seen an opportunity to benefit clients and investors through a wrapper or a strategy, we've brought that forth. So we launched the first publicly traded crypto index fund.
00:49:07.552 - 00:49:58.004, Speaker C: We launched the first crypto Innovators equity ETF. We launched the first Defi index fund, the first NFT blue chip NFT index fund. Just two or three weeks ago, we brought to market the first Ethereum linked ETF's. So, Matt can comment on the specific products, but I think at this point, we have a six year track record of showing that if there is a useful new aperture, be it an ETF wrapper or a strategy, our point of view on it is that we will be working with the SEC or other relevant parties to make sure that we're bringing that forward for investors to consider. And to your point, there are some interesting things on the table. Recently, the Ethereum linked ETF's that became possible, and then the spot products that we're in dialogue around now.
00:50:00.274 - 00:50:43.484, Speaker B: Yeah, I could just build on that. I think that's right. Towards the specific products. If we are on the pathway to get a spot bitcoin ETF, I think it's reasonable to assume that an Ethereum spot ETF is down that pathway as well, and not that hard to get to beyond that. It gets more difficult because those ETF's approval would hinge in part on the existence of these regulated futures markets, for which they're only regulated futures in the US. For bitcoin and ethereum, eventually I think we'll get to the point of having ETF's provide exposure to multiple different assets in the crypto market. But that's going to take either some legislation or maturing developments of the derivatives market or other things in order for us to get there.
00:50:43.484 - 00:51:28.972, Speaker B: I think if you think about what people will wrap in those ETF's, they will try everything. Just one asset, multiple assets, momentum strategies, hedge strategies, leverage strategies. That's what you see in the ETF world. People use the wrapper to express all these different views. The interesting thing maybe is historically the most successful ETF's, the vast majority of the market are the diversified index products. That goes a little bit against crypto's history, where people own bitcoin or they own ethereum or they own Solana. But in the ETF market where you're dealing with financial professionals, which as Hunter mentioned have one to 5% of their portfolio, maybe in crypto what they want is crypto exposure.
00:51:28.972 - 00:51:41.676, Speaker B: And so I think over time you'll see diversified products win the largest share of the market. That's what we saw in commodities, that's what we certainly see in the equity space. And I suspect that's what we'll see in crypto as well.
00:51:41.860 - 00:52:30.310, Speaker D: I've said this personally, I've been wanting to do this for a while because we're so early. I almost want a constantly rebalancing index of the top ten coins to make sure that I capture whatever is going to be in the, it's sort of like the SMP. It's really hard to outperform the S P. Like you could have like not cared about the Internet, but if you had exposure to the SMP because the composition of the S P has changed dramatically and then, then you would have benefited from that. And in crypto I need a product like that to hedge my bias, to be very focused on a particular ecosystem in my portfolio, but I don't have it. Right. And so if you could have like an, if I could wave a wand on to your point around a diversified index, it would really just be that, just give me that like my ability to express.
00:52:30.310 - 00:53:07.906, Speaker D: I'm long innovation in the space, I just don't know. And I'm pretty sure that the top ten or 20 by market cap is going to look radically different. Like if there's one bet that I can make with high conviction is that the top ten that you see right now in Coingecko is going to be vastly different in three, five and ten years from now. I want to be able to capture that growth in the ecosystem without, you know, obviously I'm actively investing but I also want to hedge my bet by having exposure to this type of product. But it, there isn't one. Right. And so, or it's not as easy to kind of like get access to this unless you're like accredited or institutional, it's tough.
00:53:07.930 - 00:53:11.916, Speaker A: That's on to because so bitwise has the one of your most popular ones.
00:53:11.940 - 00:53:12.052, Speaker B: Right.
00:53:12.068 - 00:53:13.748, Speaker A: It's the bit w. Right.
00:53:13.796 - 00:53:14.116, Speaker D: Yes.
00:53:14.180 - 00:53:39.504, Speaker A: But in there are these coins that I think a lot of people who've been in the industry for a while would agree that there's not much happening in those like, like litecoin, like I don't like bitcoin cash or something. You know, but that has included inherently you're buying, you know, litecoin, but when you get the BT bit w because it's one of the top ones still for some foolish reason. So I don't know.
00:53:39.584 - 00:53:57.008, Speaker D: Yeah, well look, I mean, I'm. That, that's the thing that, that's, that's what I'm saying. You know, like I. Yeah, I obviously have a particular opinion on the top ten. I think some of the top ten are just. It's crazy how they're still there, but they're there and I'm not making money because of that. So that's the best counter argument.
00:53:57.008 - 00:54:00.928, Speaker D: I could be intellectual or I could make or, you know, what is you.
00:54:00.936 - 00:54:02.432, Speaker A: Want to be right or do you want to make money?
00:54:02.568 - 00:54:38.752, Speaker D: That's what I'm saying. Like uh, ultimately anyways, I think there's a lot of innovation and a lot of really interesting products that you can make. Maybe as a. I know Jason wants to throw a question to you to wrap it, but you've been around the ETF industry for so long. What are some of the things that the ETF industry can learn from crypto? Some things that it can adopt from crypto, whether it's blockchain technology, atomic settlement, just the transparency nature of it. I'm curious if you like. The ETF industry is not perfect.
00:54:38.752 - 00:54:53.044, Speaker D: I mean, it's been huge catalyst, it's been hugely beneficial. But is there an opportunity to utilize this technology to revamp the financial industry, particularly within ETF land?
00:54:53.784 - 00:55:16.302, Speaker B: Yes, absolutely. Everyone who rides an innovation wave thinks they're at the end of history and that there can be nothing better. And that's certainly true in ETF land. The people who have operated there think we've solved the problem of how to access the capital markets. But of course that's not true. ETF's trade six and a half hours a day. They don't trade on weekends.
00:55:16.302 - 00:56:01.692, Speaker B: Settlement takes two days. For many international stocks or bonds or some parts of the ETF market, settlement takes 30 days, if you can imagine that. Right. The cost to transact are dramatically high. The ability for individuals to build portfolios in a tax efficient way are still limited. And so I absolutely think the ETF industry is just a stepping stone to a more perfect future. That has atomic settlement, that has 24 7365, that has individuals able to either own collective vehicles or direct index, which means own your assets yourselves with the push of a button, which of course you can do in smas today, but not as efficiently as you should be able to.
00:56:01.692 - 00:56:30.164, Speaker B: So there are a few people who have been in the ETF industry that have moved into the crypto industry because they recognize we're not at the end of history on that one. And I think you're going to see more and more of that. I think crypto is where maybe ETF's were in 95 or 97 before it really hit that mainstream point, which started to occur in the early two thousands. But I think we're going to get there and there's lots of gains still to be made.
00:56:31.744 - 00:56:48.208, Speaker A: Give the thumbs up, Matt. Maybe we could end. I remember an episode you did with our research guys back in December 2022 talking about your Coinbase thesis. We're ten months later. I'd love to just hear your updated thesis around Coinbase as a public company.
00:56:48.256 - 00:56:58.724, Speaker B: Right now, Coinbase is the same valuation as Pinterest, which strikes me as nuts. I love Pinterest. I know a lot of people who use Pinterest.
00:57:00.304 - 00:57:01.884, Speaker A: Have you used Pinterest recently?
00:57:02.424 - 00:57:49.076, Speaker B: I have not used Pinterest, but I do know I have friends. But it's not potentially one of the most important financial services companies in the world, which I think is true of Coinbase. I think if you're looking at a company that's subject $50 billion, that you could imagine one day being a trillion dollar company, I think you'd be hard pressed to find a better candidate than Coinbase. That doesn't mean it will be, but it means that it has a dominant position in an industry that's in an early stage of growth with exponential potential growth ahead of it, and it's executing exceptionally well. The other two things I would point out about Coinbase as an update from that December comment is they dramatically reduce their cost basis. Right. They lowered their burn substantially.
00:57:49.076 - 00:58:40.448, Speaker B: They had significant layoffs, which were painful, but their execution has never been better than it has been over the last nine months of the year. Whether you're talking about a base or the diversification of their income stream, or even their public setting and their lobbying, they're more effective today than they were in 2022 with a third fewer people. That is an exceptional corporate performance, and I think they're a strong leader for the industry. I could not be more excited about Coinbase. I think anyone who has a crypto portfolio that is excluding public equities, and particularly companies like Coinbase, is under allocated. They're making an active bet that those companies won't matter, and I'm not sure I would make that bet. If I wanted to diversify crypto, I would own my bitcoin I would own my ethereum.
00:58:40.448 - 00:59:02.304, Speaker B: I've owned my bitwise ten, to your point, Santiago. But I would make sure I would tick this box, because I think if you look at how well Coinbase is executing now, you look at their revenue versus where we were in 2019, it's many fold higher. I think it is in an exceptional position and it's being extremely well run. So I'm very bullish.
00:59:02.724 - 00:59:22.680, Speaker A: Yeah. The counterargument would be that the last five years with brokerages fees have gone to zero and Coinbase, if you look at Robinhood or TD ameritrade or anything like that, you almost jumped out of your seat. So I feel like you have a thought here, but I'd just be curious. It sounds like you think that they will be able to execute against that downtrend.
00:59:22.832 - 00:59:38.640, Speaker B: Yeah. Again, there's value to having been in the market for a long time. The same thing was true of Charles Schwab. It got launched on commissions trading for $29.95 and then e trade and now Robinhood. Commissions are zero. It's bigger than it's ever been been.
00:59:38.640 - 01:00:25.334, Speaker B: And the reason is, if you control a base of investors with significant assets and you have a strong reputation and a high level of trust, you will find ways to monetize those users. You will find interest income, you will find advised assets, you'll find products development, you'll find things like base. Coinbase is doing that right now in front of your eyes. If you look at the share of non commissioned revenue, it's been going up and up, up. And I don't understand why traditional Wall street analysts haven't taken the lessons from Charles Schwab. The last really disruptive brokerage service, which today charges zero for commissions, and applied it to Coinbase. It's just so obvious to me, and they control a really important market and they're doing a really good job at it.
01:00:25.874 - 01:00:57.634, Speaker D: I think it's one of the most misunderstood public companies out there. And you talk about being early contrarian and then eventually. Right, what do you believe in that others don't and eventually will? Like, if you're excited about crypto, I would love to have a discussion with someone who's really excited about crypto and doesn't think that if crypto continues to grow, in what version of the world probabilistically does Coinbase not do better? Given everything that they've done, there's a lot more probabilistically.
01:00:58.194 - 01:01:01.290, Speaker A: Yeah, I think you'd be surprised. Us on t. I posted something on Twitter.
01:01:01.482 - 01:01:25.902, Speaker D: No base gets more shit amongst crypto natives and doesn't get ability. Like before, base after base, people like, oh, wow, they're doing a lot for the space. Yeah, no shit. But even before that, it was sort of like a vilified, like, oh, you represent everything that's wrong. The world and traditional financial institutions, but they've done a huge service to the space. Incredible. Probably the most important company in crypto.
01:01:26.078 - 01:01:45.794, Speaker B: I would just add. I think that's a really important point. I think one of the reasons it's so contrarian is the stock has a lack of natural buyers because the crypto people don't like it and the non crypto people don't want crypto. So who's going? Who's left to buy Coinbase? But eventually, eventually value will win out, and I suspect that's what we'll see.
01:01:46.694 - 01:01:49.074, Speaker C: I would just double down on.
01:01:49.574 - 01:01:51.422, Speaker D: None of this is legal financial advice.
01:01:51.558 - 01:01:52.660, Speaker B: That is very true.
01:01:52.822 - 01:01:55.284, Speaker D: Go out and Yolo with their coinbase. Okay, guys, please.
01:01:56.104 - 01:02:58.702, Speaker C: I would double down on what you said, santiago. I think Coinbase is the most important company in crypto. It's hard to imagine the space without it. They provide so many services behind the scenes, and I think that'll be more and more of their growth story. But even just setting aside looking at them as an investment or as a corporation, they're also tackling one of the original sins of crypto that continues to plague the crypto space, which is that crypto has the worst communication problem out of any innovation sector I've ever seen. If you think about just as a heuristic, what do people want to know about the developments in AI? They want to know, how can I use it? What are other people using it for? And is it going to be good or bad for the world? Those are the same things that people want to know about crypto, but instead, we tell them about mining rigs powered by volcanoes in countries that they can't even locate on a map. And we talk to them about hash rate and zk proofs.
01:02:58.702 - 01:04:11.832, Speaker C: These are all good things, but we're talking right past them. It's like the physics professor who walks into the 101 class and alienates 80% of the class by sir, this is a wendy's. And so I think that crypto has a really inspiring message to tell about democratizing access, about rebuilding trust in the Internet era, about moving the world forward, and not taking the sort of state of play in 2023 as the final progress that civilization can make. But I think has been relatively poor at recognizing that most audiences who are not in crypto, have a small amount of time and want to answer the same questions they have about AI. And I think that Coinbase has done more than anyone, particularly in this past year. If you think about their campaigns around update the system, such a simple way of conveying what I think everyone in crypto believes in, but is so rarely the subject matter of conversations. The recent campaign in DC about America loves crypto, pointing out that more Americans own crypto than watch the Super bowl.
01:04:11.832 - 01:04:54.644, Speaker C: Again, such a simple point, but somehow gets lost in all of the discussion about the more idiosyncratic and technical aspects of the space. So I think that they do an incredible job. And I would also just say, I've said this a few times, but I think it's so important to sort of having this self awareness about the crypto space. For many of our clients, we work with about 1800 wealth teams, institutions, ras and family offices. Now, for many of them, they schedule a quarterly conversation with us and we produce a quarterly report. It can be found on our website if people are curious. But we produce a quarterly report and they want to know what happened over the last quarter, that's how much sort of time.
01:04:54.644 - 01:05:33.564, Speaker C: And of course they're watching things here and there. And of course we say there's this important development you should know about. But that sort of helps, I think, visualize the aperture that most of the public that is not in crypto has for this space. So when we have those moments, those beautiful moments, where someone offers us some of their attention in time, how do we fill it? And is it productive relative to they want to know? And I think historically, crypto has been squandering that time by filling it with things that they find curious or some technical detail. It's not that those don't matter. We care deeply about those. Our CTO noun, 40, writes comments on improvement proposals and writes some of them himself.
01:05:33.564 - 01:05:59.270, Speaker C: But we have to recognize the audience. And I think that's just one other aperture through which I think Coinbase has been unbelievably important. I think that they see that clearly and have done incredible work over the course of this year to help tell the story of crypto at the same level that the discussion around AI is happening, which is, how do I use it? What are other people using it for? Is it going to be good for the world? That's what the general public wants to know.
01:05:59.382 - 01:06:30.800, Speaker D: Yeah, that's such a good point. I mean, I think where it would end it, because base might be the most important development, because they're going to really, and they're really emphasizing consumer nonspecutive use cases like restaurant rewards programs. And the whole campaign around base, I think, is going to be, is incredibly exciting. It feels like it will deliver on getting builders to. To build actual products. And I think that is my understanding. Talking to people that are close to regulators are like, you just a bunch of people got lucky and then they can't stop talking about this thing.
01:06:30.800 - 01:06:45.128, Speaker D: But show me a really useful application to this. And AI is farther, way farther along. And crypto has really, that's kind of our, has been, I think, our weakest line of defense we've seen.
01:06:45.176 - 01:07:24.480, Speaker C: Seen that as well. I think we put out a report maybe in April or May, Matt's team and the research team here called the twelve real world use cases that millions of people are using today. And it illustrates twelve examples of use cases that actually have traction and put some statistics and narrative behind it. And that has been one of our most popular pieces amongst clients all year. It says nothing about return potential, nothing about sharpe ratios or correlations. And it speaks, I think, Santiago, to what you said, which is people, again, just want to understand these very simple things, which is, how can I use it? How are other people using it? Will it be good for the world? And the way to interpret that is through understanding use cases. I think base is very productive relative to that.
01:07:24.480 - 01:08:01.680, Speaker C: I think conversations around those subject matter will always be very productive and a good heuristic for people in the crypto space. Is this the same type of thing, same type of conversation that would be productive in AI? If you're at a dinner talking about AI, what do you want to know? How many people are using it? What are they using it for? What's it going to be used for in two years? And is that going to be good for the world? Perhaps you want to have a conversation about hardware and transformers and how different transformers will help with the compute necessary to run the models in certain conversations, that is a productive line of discussion.
01:08:01.712 - 01:08:39.304, Speaker D: But most of them, please invite me to those, because most of them, most of the time, you don't even get that far. Well, we'll definitely have to link to that report. I would love to, for people to browse it and double click on it, because it's so important to arm ourselves with just stable coins nfts. There are some really good use cases out there, and I think people oftentimes lose sight of that. But they're there, and you talk to people on the ground, and they're definitely getting a lot of value and really appreciate the core tenants and applications that are there. Yeah, prodiging price aside, there's some really useful applications out there and people just need to be constantly reminded of that.
01:08:39.644 - 01:08:42.504, Speaker A: Yeah. Hunter, Matt, thank you, guys.
01:08:43.244 - 01:08:59.224, Speaker D: This is great. Yeah, thanks for all the work you do. I know you talked about Coinbase doing great work in DC, but I know you guys are also talking out there to a lot of folks in the street. So I really appreciate that. And yeah, keep doing great work and yeah, we'll hope to see some ETF sometime soon.
01:09:00.054 - 01:09:00.630, Speaker B: Thanks, guys.
01:09:00.662 - 01:09:01.394, Speaker D: Or not.
01:09:02.214 - 01:09:14.446, Speaker C: Thank you. This is wonderful and appreciate those comments. We try to be good stewards of the space and feel grateful to be part of this industry with others like you who are thinking about the long term. So thanks for the conversation.
01:09:14.590 - 01:09:14.974, Speaker A: All right. Jones.
