00:00:00.200 - 00:00:58.650, Speaker A: Like inevitable that projects will want to, first of all, control their own block space, and second of all, be able to customize, like how their vm runs gas tokens, like all sorts of stuff that people will want to customize, and so they want to move to l two s. And at that point, you end up with something pretty similar to like, what Ethereum has right now, which is maybe this thing is bad for ETh, the token, but it's good for developers. And if it's good for developers, it's good for users. Nothing said on the Hive mind is a recommendation to buy or sell securities or tokens. This podcast is strictly for informational purposes only, and any views expressed by anyone on the show are solely our own opinions, not financial advice. Hi everyone. My name is Jose Macedou, and welcome to the Hivemind podcast, our first episode on Empire.
00:00:58.650 - 00:01:45.580, Speaker A: Pretty excited to be here. We've actually been doing this for over a year, but excited to make it to the big leagues. So for those who don't know or haven't followed before, the goal of the podcast is to basically provide an inside look into what we like to call the Delphi hive mind, bringing together some of our brightest minds from each of the divisions to share insights, alpha, and shitposts. So today with us we have Ceteris Paribus, who heads up our institutional research arm. We have Jan Lieberman, who is managing partner at Delphi Ventures. And we have venture partner Duncan, also known as Flood Capital, self proclaimed gem Hunter. I split my time between Delphi Ventures and Delphi Labs, our protocol R and D arm focused on incubating and accelerating new web3 primitives.
00:01:45.580 - 00:01:56.474, Speaker A: So to kick it off, we normally like to talk about markets. Just, how's everyone feeling? Maybe ceteris can start since the others are having a laughing fit.
00:01:56.602 - 00:02:25.844, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't know. I feel like this chop for the last four months is just kind of driving everyone insane. Right. And so if you're like a trend trader or something, you're probably just like, pulling your hair out at this point. But I don't know, it's hard to be like, too bearish, I think. So, like, the dispersion has been pretty bad. And that's also another reason this is something like, we've talked about a ton.
00:02:25.844 - 00:02:31.028, Speaker B: And I had that thing on those charts on Twitter the other day that.
00:02:31.044 - 00:02:33.612, Speaker A: Kind of showed, like, your spaghetti chart table thing.
00:02:33.756 - 00:02:36.364, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it just shows how bad it's been.
00:02:36.412 - 00:02:41.300, Speaker C: Like I chopping bitcoin down and mostly everything.
00:02:41.380 - 00:03:04.730, Speaker B: Yeah, it's like, it's like, you have the three, right? Like BTC, ESL, all pretty good. And then you have entire sectors, like, down 50% plus. And it's like, modular. And, like, cosmos eco are really just. It feels like there was, like a big capitulation on Cosmos eco like, a week or two ago.
00:03:04.850 - 00:03:09.390, Speaker C: Modular is just codenamed for low float, high FTV launches.
00:03:09.710 - 00:03:13.854, Speaker B: Yeah, it's true. It's true. All of those. Well, because it's like a new sector, right?
00:03:13.982 - 00:03:17.206, Speaker A: It's a subset for sure, of low float high FDB.
00:03:17.358 - 00:03:29.102, Speaker B: Yeah, that is like, I guess, like an interesting point to make is that it's like they're all in the same sector. They all have the same kind of, like, low float, high fTV stuff. Just because they're all new.
00:03:29.206 - 00:03:41.580, Speaker D: Most sec, like, most new coins are kind of. It's hard to get away from that. Unless you're doing a monstrous airdrop. Like, structurally, you're likely going to be high float or low flow high FTV.
00:03:42.000 - 00:03:52.448, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm just saying modular is like a new sector too, right? Exactly. It's like, what's actually driving that? Is it like bearishness on modularity, or is it just that fact that they're all new? Kind of.
00:03:52.584 - 00:04:44.238, Speaker C: Probably the fact that they're all crazily valued, but I feel like it's. It's actually, like, pretty healthy because we've kind of seen bitcoin bounce between, like 70 to 60k. Like 60 back to. It's done that a few times. So, like, bitcoin's only 1015 percent off all time highs, but you've had a massive drawdown in these other sectors, like memes and these low float, high FTV, which is probably pretty healthy for the market because the market couldn't keep on going up and support all those valuations. It was literally, like, I forget when we counted it during, like March, like January, February, March, April, there's probably hundreds of billions worth of, like, fdvs that had launched with these low floats. So bringing that forward in the future, if bitcoin had kept going up to, like, 100k, that's really heavy for the market to absorb.
00:04:44.238 - 00:05:07.078, Speaker C: So this kind of chop that bitcoins in is a good digestion period for the market to kind of price these things down to where they should be and not have those really heavy unlocks, like, kind of dampen the run later on because it's just not sustainable. Right. You can't have hundreds of billions of FTV on these infra projects that make no money. So I think it's it's healthy.
00:05:07.254 - 00:05:21.358, Speaker B: Yeah. I do think you'll probably see a period, though, where those all probably trend well, just because they are like low circ. Right. And so you could see, talked about.
00:05:21.454 - 00:05:33.472, Speaker A: Kind of to death. Right. Like, I did a thread on it too. It's down probably 50% since then. And it was already like talked about a lot then. At what point is this sort of like priced in?
00:05:33.576 - 00:05:36.232, Speaker B: Well, yeah, that's the point. I was trying to. Yeah.
00:05:36.416 - 00:05:40.300, Speaker A: And just markets generally as well, because I don't think you got to say your piece.
00:05:40.680 - 00:06:32.406, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, think about, I guess on bitcoin, if you think about what kind of puts in the local bottom is just a lot of forced selling. Right. Which we kind of saw in that nuke. You had a confluence of pain between the end trade and soft macro data, and then the jump fears and all of that led to just a lot of selling, a lot of liquidations, and we were in the high sixties and all of a sudden we're touching forties. And so I feel like that was a good place to put in a local bottom on BTC doesn't mean you get a v recovery bounce the same way. We're talking about a lot of supply getting absorbed on the alts. There's been a lot of supply that to get absorbed on BTC from Gox, from germans, german selling, from us moving coins and selling.
00:06:32.406 - 00:06:47.528, Speaker D: And so I do think part of the reason why, despite all the inflows, that BTC isn't higher is because there's been a lot of this absorption. I forgot that the total, it's like a couple hundred thousand BTC between all of them.
00:06:47.694 - 00:06:47.996, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:06:48.028 - 00:06:49.120, Speaker C: And grayscale.
00:06:49.420 - 00:07:43.560, Speaker D: Grayscale, yeah. So I mean, it's good to process this at not all time highs, right. Because it's just eating into dry powder that would otherwise move the price less at higher prices. And so, yeah, I think you kind of expect some bullishness going into year end, into an election year where, you know, the incumbents will try and do whatever is possible to create a favorable environment to convince voters that this is because they're in office. And so I do think there's going to be more pandering to crypto and to broader markets. So I'm bullish going into year end. It's funny, I think as it chops around, and I'm guilty of this too, you over analyze price and you're comparing it to what stocks are doing.
00:07:43.560 - 00:08:02.060, Speaker D: It's like, oh, we're nuking, but stocks are nuking. So that's okay. And then stocks bounce and bitcoin doesn't bounce. What's going on? And so I think it's just the nature of chop and it definitely just eats away at kind of mind sharing and forces people to try and like overly focus on these like day to day moves.
00:08:02.920 - 00:08:28.104, Speaker A: Yeah, people are going crazy out there. To answer my own question on whether it's priced in, I think I agree with all of you that there's dispersions coming. Basically. There's definitely some like majors I think are primed to do well. I think a bunch of alts will, will do well. And I think a lot of people will mid curve and like obsess over unlocks. And I think a bunch of things will pump through their unlocks just like they did before.
00:08:28.104 - 00:08:29.648, Speaker A: Right. Like the Lidos and stuff.
00:08:29.744 - 00:08:44.220, Speaker C: Well, when the market, it's easy. Yeah, everyone just diamond hands. Every like market's going up. Everyone diamond hands. And then the market turns and, and it's just like everything. Nukes and those are the ones that sell off the hardest, but they can go up just as quick.
00:08:45.000 - 00:09:35.582, Speaker A: I do think there's like still a lot of pain in the long tail of alts just because they're still up. There's still like billions of dollars or like tens of billions of dollars of unrealized gains that are gonna unlock and they're unlocking on much. And for a lot of these, the circulating market caps are kind of like fugazi. Like if you actually go look at what the real circulating supply is, it's sometimes like a fifth or a quarter, like definitely a fifth to half of what's reported because they managed to get treasury tokens reported or they get. Yeah, like there's a lot of different ways the teams game this. And so the real market cap is way lower than it seems. And the unlock, in some cases like that first cliff unlock is like a few multiples of current market cap, which is just like an absurd unlock.
00:09:35.582 - 00:10:01.222, Speaker A: And I think you don't really need the narrative to shift for these things to go down just because you have sellers that are up a ton that know that their thing, know better than anyone that their thing has no traction. Right. And will be ready to sell, in my view, for a lot of these, for some of them, I really think unlocks are going to be a buying opportunity and a nothing burger and people are going to want to hold them through. Through them.
00:10:01.326 - 00:10:13.450, Speaker D: We're starting it. We're about to start hitting the first wave of these unlocks. And I definitely agree, you're going to get some bullish ones, particularly ones that had a lot of secondary market turnover. So I think Tia is probably going to be a bullish unlock.
00:10:14.630 - 00:10:17.490, Speaker C: I mean, that's a big 5 billion.
00:10:17.990 - 00:10:23.518, Speaker B: Still, or, I mean, it's probably just going to set the narrative for everything. That's kind of like the poster child.
00:10:23.574 - 00:10:33.250, Speaker A: For, like, there was a lot of secondary volume on tier above, above the current price. So people that are. That bought lock coins above the current price. Well, a lot is. A lot is relative, though. I think it was.
00:10:33.290 - 00:10:49.690, Speaker D: Right, but it's different. The point being that it's changing hands from someone who's got an insane amount of unrealized gain to someone who's now flat. So unrealized gain is naturally a seller flat. Potentially.
00:10:49.730 - 00:11:07.544, Speaker A: It's always bullish, but there's a lot of unrealized gains and secondary volumes are of. It's hard to make a huge dent in that. But you've definitely, it's nice also because you take it from the people that have the highest propensity to sell. Right. And give it to people that are, like, flat. It definitely, definitely dilutes a lot of it. I think Tia will, will be a.
00:11:07.544 - 00:11:10.248, Speaker A: Will set the tone for a lot of what comes after.
00:11:10.344 - 00:11:18.952, Speaker D: It really just depends on what's happening that week, too, which is. Yeah, like, if it's a bullish week, it's going to go off. If it's a shit week, there's no escaping gravity.
00:11:19.096 - 00:11:53.736, Speaker B: I guess I'm still just, like, nothing bullish on DEA tokens in general. And so that's still what makes the Tia thing, I mean, so the other thing I was going to say is you're seeing some of these new projects come to market and they're not even that much higher off their last round, like, avails. Last round was 800 mil and they went public at like 1.4 or something like 1.41.5 now. And that's before any unlocks even hit. Like, that thing is definitely trading secondaries below the last round.
00:11:53.736 - 00:11:59.464, Speaker B: Right. And so I think you're going to start to see that. I think you're going to start to see that, like, a lot.
00:11:59.552 - 00:12:09.456, Speaker C: I think the market's kind of catching on. I hope. I hope the market's catching on because we've seen just so many of these disastrous launches. But anyway, we haven't, though.
00:12:09.608 - 00:12:38.274, Speaker A: We haven't. That's the thing. We haven't seen so many from a price perspective on launch, for sure. But that's just like dynamics of launching for the investors in those rounds we haven't seen. That's why I don't think it's over yet. It's because you can still make money doing these pre launch rounds and then it launches above your valuation and obviously it's going to be tough to get liquidity on it. Yeah.
00:12:38.442 - 00:12:46.070, Speaker D: That's a paper gain, though. I don't think it's that that's really a winning formula to make money because you're.
00:12:46.110 - 00:12:46.694, Speaker A: I mean, if.
00:12:46.742 - 00:12:57.750, Speaker D: Yeah, if you bought it at 800, it's trading at 1.4, you're going to be selling it at a 50, 60% discount. So you're down. If you're trying to sell OTC on a. On a price that's, you know, a little less than two x, what you.
00:12:57.790 - 00:13:15.926, Speaker A: But that's like taking the worst example. Right. Like taking one of the. Or one of the worst examples where investors are kind of up the least. I think for a lot of these, you still have like a big delta. Like there's still somehow people on binance and bybit, like buying these things on launch and holding them and pricing them above previous round. Yeah.
00:13:15.998 - 00:13:24.890, Speaker D: I think their rationale, though is there's no unlock coming anytime soon. Right. So this is just like a game I get to play until there's a new supply hitting the market.
00:13:25.390 - 00:13:49.782, Speaker A: That's the other thing for me. It's like if you want to express bullish view on crypto last cycle, there's only a few coins you can buy now. There's like constantly new coins launching which have reset unlocked schedule. So you can just like dump the old one and that's unlocking and get the new one or get a meme that doesn't even have any of these dynamics. So I just think there's so much more competition for capital plus, like these billions of dollars of unlocks that's going to make. Make it painful for some of these things to find.
00:13:49.886 - 00:13:53.726, Speaker B: Oh, they're definitely some like, kingmaker pair trades, too.
00:13:53.878 - 00:13:55.262, Speaker A: Yeah, 100%.
00:13:55.406 - 00:14:19.250, Speaker C: Yeah. But I think this is how. I think we can all agree that this period, like, even though bitcoin is only 15% off the high, everyone's like, feeling like this is a bear market because all the alts have gone down like 70%. But it is a healthy period of digestion in the market because that couldn't keep going. How? Like, what we saw in March is just like, not sustainable going forward and we've had a lot of digestion. So I think overall it's healthy for the market.
00:14:19.370 - 00:14:43.738, Speaker B: Of course, like, Jose, I mean, Jose made this point on the last pod how it was like, in traditional venture, most things that go to zero never become liquid, right? And this, everything goes public here. And so there's going to be some, like, massive, like, things are going to go from multi billions to zero over the next few years.
00:14:43.834 - 00:15:18.422, Speaker D: Well, I think that's why you get, there's the appetite to invest at these valves because, like, that contributes to why the Val, like, never in traditional venture would something with this level of, you know, revenue and profitability raise at this Val, right? Like series a's with no business model raising at mid nine figs, because, you know, you have a path to liquidity. So I can take a lot more risk on the valuation side because it's, it's not a binary outcome. There's like a spectrum of kind of exits I can get where at least recoup.
00:15:18.486 - 00:15:36.362, Speaker A: Exactly. Yeah, that's a big. I think people still don't realize how good a venture, how good an asset class sort of crypto venture gets a lot of hate. I still think people don't realize how good an asset class it is. And yeah, what you said is true. It's like, in venture, you probably have like, a fraction of a percent of companies that go public. I actually tried to find exact stats, but it's, but it's hard.
00:15:36.362 - 00:15:40.950, Speaker A: And then in crypto, it's probably like a few orders of magnitude higher.
00:15:41.930 - 00:15:44.618, Speaker C: Everyone, everyone will, everyone will launch.
00:15:44.674 - 00:16:05.790, Speaker A: Not everyone. Some things, like founder has regulatory concerns, or, like, there's a lot of things that don't launch a token. Trust, trust, trust us. Yeah. So there's, there's things that don't launch a token, but most things do. And a lot of these things launch a token before they launch a product. And sometimes they have derivatives for the token before they launch a product, too.
00:16:05.790 - 00:16:31.696, Speaker A: So there's just like, these dynamics where people are going to be making a bunch of money on both sides of these trades for things that are super early stage and sometimes don't even launch a product, or launching a product is bullish, is bearish, because now you have something to judge. Whereas before, it's just pure narrative. Um, kind of like Eigen lair doing this. Like, if they do slashing or whatever, like, you know, it just makes the calculus for supply.
00:16:31.728 - 00:17:32.954, Speaker C: Saturn's way worse, I think, like, we haven't really seen, because if you're actually to vest your entire, like, venture position in some of these, it's usually like a year cliff and then two year, four year vest. So I think it's kind of TBD on if you don't sell OTC, if you'll actually be up on some of these projects. But it's definitely like attractive versus regular venture investing. I also think it creates a lot of opportunities in the liquid markets where these projects have launched either a previous cycle and have drawn down a lot, or they didn't take VC capital or they just launched at a reasonable valuation to get in at an early stage. But yeah, you kind of have to remember if you're going outside of BTC, Ethan Sol. You're playing with basically like, venture investment, and you have to be really cognizant of the supply dynamics and also just like, if the product's actually gonna get traction and be around in a few years from now, if you're not just. Just trading, if you actually want to, like, invest in this asset.
00:17:33.002 - 00:17:36.330, Speaker A: Gemcoin Hunter, a man of the people looking out for the common man.
00:17:36.410 - 00:17:49.312, Speaker B: Well, it seems like a lot of people are trying to run with, like, the OG Defi narrative over the last few weeks. I was gonna say, I think that a big part of that just has to do with the fact that they are fully unlocked and, like, even they.
00:17:49.336 - 00:17:50.368, Speaker C: Also have a business.
00:17:50.504 - 00:18:13.220, Speaker B: Like, yeah, but it's like, I don't. I still think they're overvalued, like, personally, but I can still see them doing well because people want something. People are sick of the low float stuff. They're sick of, like, the meme coin stuff. They want something real to bid. And so I could maybe see a bit of that. But, yeah, it's hard for me to get too excited, personally.
00:18:13.620 - 00:18:22.580, Speaker A: I mean, you say that, like, what's Solana's, like, actual earnings? Like, if you take out inflation, like, what's their total economic value minus.
00:18:22.660 - 00:18:26.516, Speaker B: It's a lot. It's like close to ethereum now.
00:18:26.708 - 00:18:32.764, Speaker A: But that's like, that doesn't take a discount inflation, right? That's just their inflation.
00:18:32.852 - 00:18:34.052, Speaker B: I mean, inflation has nothing to do.
00:18:34.076 - 00:18:43.426, Speaker C: With that, but it's a platform, so you can price in a lot more growth versus these, these, like, things that are clearly not platforms.
00:18:43.538 - 00:19:18.002, Speaker B: Inflation is not a cost. Inflation is a cost to the amount. Okay? If you want to say inflation is a cost, you have to. There's like, you need to basically figure out what percent of the inflation is, like a high propensity to be spent. And so, you know, you can kind of come up with like some average tax rate for the network. And so maybe you guess it's like 20%, right? And so you can say, if inflation is like 6% on something, then maybe the real selling pressure you'll get is like 1.2%. Right.
00:19:18.002 - 00:19:36.030, Speaker B: And then the other one is the thing that we talk about all the time is, like, these locked tokens that people are allowed to stake. Those are basically all sold a lot of the time. But, like, in a vacuum, inflation, I think people overanalyze inflation. It doesn't matter. It's just, it's like demurrage for non stakers. Basically.
00:19:36.370 - 00:19:54.710, Speaker D: On the way up, it does. I guess on the way up, there's propensity to hold because you figure the validators or whoever are high conviction and they need to sell a certain amount to fund costs. And then the rest, they kind of want to hold and play for the upside, but eventually it's going to come due. It's basically like a stock based comp.
00:19:55.610 - 00:19:58.144, Speaker A: Exactly. I see. The stock based compensation.
00:19:58.222 - 00:20:08.980, Speaker C: No, I agree with ceteris. It's like, if you're holding Solana and you stake it. Yeah. You're losing. It's like 7% staking rate right now. You get charged a 10% fee. So, like, the dilution is just that, 70 bips or whatever.
00:20:08.980 - 00:20:11.620, Speaker C: Because if every, if you stake it, then you're not getting diluted.
00:20:11.660 - 00:20:18.480, Speaker B: Yeah. Like, sure, the price might go down by, like, the market cap is gonna go. You own the same percentage. It doesn't matter.
00:20:19.460 - 00:20:23.684, Speaker A: I mean, if you're staking. Yeah, you're just, you're just staying the same. Staying. Staying put.
00:20:23.732 - 00:20:44.200, Speaker B: But no, like, I mean, Solana. No, but, like, Solana, validators make a lot of, like, real revenue now that it's, like, worth it for them, even without the inflation. Now, I will say, like, solana, the validator centralization has been getting a bit worse over the past year.
00:20:45.660 - 00:20:47.440, Speaker C: How do we get onto that?
00:20:48.100 - 00:20:50.680, Speaker B: I don't know. Inflation?
00:20:51.060 - 00:20:52.932, Speaker A: Yeah, we don't have to go down this road.
00:20:52.956 - 00:20:55.244, Speaker B: We don't have to go down this road. We don't have to go down this.
00:20:55.292 - 00:21:23.950, Speaker A: I mean, I did want to touch base with something Jan said. Maybe. Maybe we can, maybe don't have to go back here, but just on crypto venture, because it is the reason a lot of, a lot more stuff gets funded in crypto venture, and people fund it a lot. But it's just the fact that it's such an attractive asset class because you have the liquidity, and the liquidity enables you to both, like, take risk off the table much sooner. Right. You don't have to wait for this binary outcome. Like, you can sort of reassess at every incremental, like, time period.
00:21:23.950 - 00:22:12.708, Speaker A: You don't have to just wait for it to go public or something like this and, you know, face like a theranos or something. Or even like, FTX is a really good example, right? Equity holders got torched, but like token holders, like multicoin did, I think they said they sold most of it at $20 or something in their annual report. So, like, if you have the token, you can get out. It's just such a difference, right? And then the second thing is you can back things that can't ipo or get acquired, but are still really good businesses. And there's a huge range of things like that in crypto which would never be able to ipo or get acquired, but are still good businesses. And with the token you're able to. If like in crypto venture, there's like, or like a normal venture, there's this probability distribution, let's say like an expected value distribution, all the different ways that you can generate, like a high expected value.
00:22:12.708 - 00:22:44.084, Speaker A: Like, some of them is like 1% of the time you do really fucking well, and 99% of the time you get torched. And then there's businesses that are way safer, right, where 60% of the time they do good, but not like insanely startup, like Google outcome, but they're way less risky and they succeed way more often. You can actually invest in the entire distribution as crypto venture, whereas as a normal venture investor, you just can't. So I think that's the reason that it's still like one of the most attractive places to be in my mind.
00:22:44.252 - 00:23:08.634, Speaker C: But, uh, for sure. And not only just for like, VC's, even if you're just like a retail investor, if you put in a lot of work, you can find projects that don't have any VC's and like organically launch, like two that come to mind was like GMX last cycle, didn't take any VC money. It did really well. Banana. This cycle, didn't take any VC money, it did really well. They both launched at like, very reasonable valuations on chain. And you can find those.
00:23:08.634 - 00:23:22.310, Speaker C: They definitely exist. So it's not just for, if you're like a VC, like, you can find these as retail investors, you just have to be, you know. Really? Yeah. Or following my twitter.
00:23:24.610 - 00:23:45.628, Speaker A: All right, we want to move on. We want to go into the Solana eth thing. Or like, there was this eth panel that I thought was worth discussing. It was posted in reads. It's like Justin Drake, Vitalik, Sebastian ex flashbots now doing the thing whose name escapes me and a few other people, one balance. And it was just. Who was it?
00:23:45.644 - 00:23:47.980, Speaker B: No, no, no, wait. Are you talking Stefan or.
00:23:48.140 - 00:24:00.650, Speaker A: Yeah, Stefan from x flashbots. And there's someone. There was the guy. There was Chris from Manoma. There. There was a bunch. It was a star studded, like sort of like nerd snipe panel for sure.
00:24:00.650 - 00:24:38.576, Speaker A: And within it, like Vitalik basically says sort of verbatim, in an ideal world, there would be no defi. Like, I think he was referring to the l one. Like an ideal world, there would be no defi on the l one. And then later on, like, Justin Drake says something like, yeah, I thought the use cases would just be like, sending tokens and stuff. But then I spoke to paradigm and they were like, no, we need a, we need token swaps, you know? And to me, it was just, like, shocking. The disconnect between the eth intelli and by the way, I'm bullish eth. I actually hold more Ethan than Sol right now.
00:24:38.576 - 00:25:11.890, Speaker A: I don't quite know why, but I do. And, yeah, but it was shocking to me to see the disconnect where these guys just don't use the chain. And they're sort of dismissive of all the, I mean, to be fair, it's just like buying meme coins and defi and stuff, but they're very dismissive. And I retire. And there's been a trend of this throughout the year, right? Like, Vitalik's post about not being single issue voters. Like, basically an anti Trump post. His thing about how celebrity coins should give money to charity or whatever, rather than doing, like, there's better things to do with the money.
00:25:11.890 - 00:25:43.468, Speaker A: Like, there's just been a trend of a bit of a disconnect. And I'm torn because I love Vitalik. Like, he's one of the ogs. Like, been in the industry for so long, has always has been uncorruptible in terms of, like, in an industry where it's so easy to get corrupted. The dude's been totally, like, uncorruptible, very balanced, etcetera. But also, it kind of sucks that these people are so disconnected from what's actually happening on chain and the degen culture, I guess. And we're curious to get your thoughts.
00:25:43.468 - 00:25:48.548, Speaker A: And I think I'll probably have to do the eth bull case because I think, I think you guys are. Yeah, but we can do that later.
00:25:48.644 - 00:26:41.080, Speaker B: I mean, I think it was fubaR. Had this good post yesterday, and, like, the entirety of the scaling roadmap for Ethereum is based on this idea that, like, sending tokens is the use case. And when it's, like, the. The use case, most people care about our swaps, right? And that's, like, a fundamentally different problem that you're solving. And it is why I like the liquidity fragmentation that people talk to death now was never seen as, like, a massive issue, because if you're just sending tokens, that actually doesn't matter that much. But when the entire use case revolves around, like, having liquidity and trading, then this is why you see integrated monolithic type architectures do well. It's why you're seeing a lot of excitement on these.
00:26:41.080 - 00:27:17.392, Speaker B: You know, these paralyzed evms, the l two s that are coming out. Right? These high performance l two s that are completely centralized, like, one single beefy node. But they can do a ton of transactions. Right? And you're even seeing it with, like, 4844 when Ethereum reduced its da costs a lot. You've seen, like, a big. You've seen, like, the power laws get. Get more extreme where, like, bass and arbitrum have continued to, like, grow and everything else is either, like, flattered down.
00:27:17.392 - 00:27:17.952, Speaker B: Right.
00:27:18.056 - 00:27:23.528, Speaker C: It's like you need some sort of chain or something to connect all of these together.
00:27:23.704 - 00:27:30.800, Speaker B: Well, no, it's almost the opposite. It's like people showing that they really don't want to use multiple things. They want to use one thing. Right?
00:27:30.840 - 00:27:32.520, Speaker C: One unified chain.
00:27:32.680 - 00:27:43.872, Speaker B: Yeah, I saw. I saw chao from alliance yesterday. He was like, it's base versus Solana. And that's like, I don't know, man. Like, I'm not.
00:27:43.936 - 00:28:00.480, Speaker C: Well, let's talk about the stuff that Ethereum has going for it, because I feel like right now it's pretty consensus that Seoul is just the place where marginal buyers are going. Marginal users are going. It's giving you these cheap swaps. All the meme coins are there. So, yeah, maybe we could talk a bit about Eth. I don't know, Jose.
00:28:00.560 - 00:28:14.456, Speaker B: I think it's, like, fixable. I think a lot of their stuff is fixable. I think, like, Max Resnick from consensus and SMG has really been pushing this, like, multiple concurrent proposers thing on the l one. Right. And trying to get more.
00:28:14.608 - 00:28:17.100, Speaker C: Oh, yeah. What does that do? In English, please.
00:28:18.080 - 00:28:25.180, Speaker B: It helps reduce Mev, because most Mev is, like, you have.
00:28:25.680 - 00:28:27.256, Speaker A: That's not the issue with the l one, right?
00:28:27.288 - 00:28:38.114, Speaker B: Yeah, no, no, but. No, but you can the issue. Yeah, yeah, but you also. He's also like, he's very against the whole raspberry PI philosophy. Right? Getting rid of that.
00:28:38.202 - 00:28:42.154, Speaker A: He wants to scale. A lot of people want to scale the l one because people want to.
00:28:42.162 - 00:28:45.914, Speaker B: Use the l one. I mean, I think the benefit of.
00:28:45.922 - 00:29:36.496, Speaker D: The l two s is that you now have. So the question is, like, what you lose in fees, you. You need to make up in moneyness, right? Like the. The appetite to hold ETH and use it increases more than the fundamental value of ETH decreases because all the transactions are now on the l two, which I think is like a decent argument to make. I think in the grand scheme of things, the supply burning thing was more meme than anything, because the degree to which the supply was burning is negligible. So it's more memetic than actual, you know, like supply constraint, supply constraining. So I think, you know, the argument on the l two s is you now have different communities incentivized with their token.
00:29:36.496 - 00:29:48.120, Speaker D: We're not saying those tokens are good investments, but they're going to be used to try and get people to come build and use their platform. And in all those scenarios, you're using ETH as gas, and so, like, you're gaining money. This on that side.
00:29:48.240 - 00:30:03.098, Speaker B: No, but here's the thing. The. So the burn, first of all, yes, it's like memetic, but it's strong memetic. And I listen to these tri fi podcasts, and when they bring them up, they're like, oh, yeah, I like that. It's like a stock buyback. I like that. I'm on board with that.
00:30:03.098 - 00:30:42.998, Speaker B: And the thing is, before ETH had this, if you look at ETH, like, pre 1559 proof of work, it was purely a recycled asset, right. Because miners would get all the fees, and then they just sell it. And that's why eth never did well. And then as soon as 1559 went into play, it pumped from, like, whatever, $100 to, like, four k. And in the l two roadmap, you kind of go back to the same architecture, right? It's like, yes, the l two s are using eth as gas, but the l two s barely have to pay any money back to the l one. And so they're just like, recycling it. And you go back to the same thing that it was in the past, that, like, nobody.
00:30:43.054 - 00:30:49.870, Speaker D: Right, but you have way more holders now, right? That's the trade off. Is it the money in this, like, I don't know.
00:30:50.030 - 00:30:51.210, Speaker B: Why is it better for me?
00:30:51.630 - 00:31:04.518, Speaker A: Yeah, well, my, like, you know, the meme of the guy standing up on his. On his own or whatever. Like, I think is, like, the l two roadmap is actually good. Like, I think. I think it actually makes sense. And I don't know. We published this report recently on the.
00:31:04.518 - 00:31:58.978, Speaker A: On the portal Solana the modular, which is a play on the Solana, the monolith report from a year ago, which I'll give you your shout out. Ceteris, you put out a bull report pretty close to the bottom. It was a good one. And then Solana the modular, it's sort of like, there's an interesting analysis there. It's very back of the envelope, but it just shows how Solana, even a million TPS, which is sort of what firedancer hopes to provide, can sustain maybe 20 million users, especially in this agent world that we're moving towards. And I think it's clear, like, what kind of people realized very early on, is that no amount of scaling on the l one would make it good, would make it able to have everyone on it, and so you would always need to fragment. And the l two s, I think, provide really good ux benefits.
00:31:58.978 - 00:32:56.584, Speaker A: And it's not just, like, scalability in terms of being able to scale horizontally. It's also customization. Like, we're already seeing that on Solana, right? With these five Solana L two s, it's like zeta and code and grass that are all building l two s that are customized in their own ways, suit their own purposes. And because they're realizing that they can't get everything they want from Solana, because when you use an l one, you inherit every design, or a lot of design decisions. You have some obviously, design space with smart contracts, but a lot of stuff you inherit from the l one. To me, it's inevitable that projects will want to, first of all, control their own block space, and second of all, be able to customize, like how their vm runs gas tokens, like, all sorts of stuff that people will want to customize, and so they'll want to move to l two s. And at that point, you end up with something pretty similar to, like, what Ethereum has right now, which is maybe this thing is bad for eth, the token, but it's good for developers.
00:32:56.584 - 00:33:18.440, Speaker A: And if it's good for developers, it's good for users. And I don't think, and the base versus soul thing, I think it's very, like, right now, clearly, it's base versus. So. But this is sort of assuming that the only thing people will ever do on these chains is trade tokens and trade meme coins. And like, these are, these are the. These are the two things that have the most traction right now. And you're assuming these are the only things that will ever have traction.
00:33:18.440 - 00:33:42.610, Speaker A: I think if you wanted. If we assume that more shit will be done on chain, I do think the l two roadmap and like app specific l two s make a lot of sense. And then just last thing, I don't actually think this is bad for Eth, because I don't think any. Well, I agree with what you say, that eth lost out on fee revenue and stuff like this, but I don't think people buy these assets for their cash flow. You know, I don't think people are buying Solana for its cash flow.
00:33:42.690 - 00:33:44.670, Speaker B: Yeah, they are. Yeah, they are, 100%.
00:33:45.330 - 00:33:55.986, Speaker A: And look how much eth, like, every l two. The biggest asset that's bridged to these l two s is eth. Like, eth is money. Bankless are right. Eth is money on these l two.
00:33:56.018 - 00:34:39.259, Speaker B: S. Here's the thing. Your whole l two, the best, the best l one to have for ecosystem of roll ups is a performant l one that has like short block times and a lot of da capacity. And so this is also why you're seeing on Solana, Solana doesn't have these generalized roll ups. They actually do have app specific roll ups, whereas on Ethereum, they're all these generalized ones, because you still can't launch on the l one. So I think, like, the mental decision, if you're building an SVM, is also a lot cleaner, because if you want shared state, you can just launch on the l one. And then if you want to have your own block space, then you just make this app chain thing as an l two.
00:34:39.259 - 00:35:15.070, Speaker B: So I do think that Solana is going to, like, back into having a lot of app roll ups, which is actually kind of like cosmos thesis. And I think if you go back, I think the biggest problem with the cosmos go to market. And what they missed is I still think they're. I actually agree, like, a lot of these things will be app chains at the end of the day. I think that the transition period to get there, though, is what cosmos messed up on. And you need like, some central liquidity hub to get, like, a lot of developers to get a lot of money where everybody just is. And then you make, like, the app chains after.
00:35:15.070 - 00:35:33.930, Speaker B: And cosmos went, like straight app chains from day one. And then you could never build. You could never build liquidity. You can never get, like enough developers. And that's why I think Solana now is, like, ironically going to start crushing the app chain game because they have this good place that they're, like, starting at.
00:35:34.050 - 00:35:40.350, Speaker C: So you think just Solana's better at hosting l two s than ethereum will be? Or, like, app specific chains?
00:35:40.730 - 00:35:49.588, Speaker B: It depends what you want. Like, I do think there's going to be way higher ratio of app chain to generalized. Like, even all the generalized.
00:35:49.644 - 00:36:07.532, Speaker D: So that the argument you're making, though, is, is still one in favor of l two s on eth. It's just, you're just right. Like, you're saying that the path to getting there on Solana is. Is more favorable, but in the end, right. The consensus is that these are necessary.
00:36:07.676 - 00:36:12.604, Speaker B: Yeah, but, like, I know, like, everyone's gonna end up in approximately the same spot, but how you get there matters.
00:36:12.772 - 00:36:48.160, Speaker A: This is where I'm like, uh, shill, one of our portfolio companies, we're on bullish initia and these projects that are actually building for the roll up world, because I think both Solana and ETH are optimized. I mean, ETH is, is obviously like a, you know, very old tech in the crypto space. There's a bunch of things they've inherited that don't make sense. You know, like, Lido and LST's kind of destroyed the whole solo staking thing and made it, made it. And there was so much engineering effort that went into that. And I don't understand this Solana stack as deeply, but I'm sure there's things like that there, too. And so if you accept it, it's a roll up world, then you kind of want things that are.
00:36:48.160 - 00:36:53.664, Speaker A: They're built. Like, what do you actually want from. From an l one? I think that's a really interesting question, because all these roll ups.
00:36:53.712 - 00:36:54.620, Speaker C: Liquidity.
00:36:55.120 - 00:37:21.144, Speaker A: Exactly. I think it's like, liquidity. Canonical assets with, with liquidity, right? You want, like, all the USDC and WBTC, everything to be issued natively on the l one, and then to have an easy bridge to roll up. You want that, you want users, you want, like, a decent wallet, make it very easy to deploy. Like, it's these basic things, and, like, none of that captures much value, right. You can't, like, capture much value for all that. There's definitely network effects to it because.
00:37:21.144 - 00:37:44.302, Speaker A: Yeah, liquidity has network effects, but it's, it's. It's just like, it's. Yeah, it's an interesting, like, the l two world is interesting because it does keep, like, everything ends up like eth right now, right? Like, sol ends up like eth right now, too, the only things that will be on, on mainnet, so are the things that need, like, shared state, which, you know, it doesn't seem like there's that many of them.
00:37:44.486 - 00:38:27.034, Speaker B: The thing is, I was talking to Donno from l two beat just on like, Twitter the other day, and he made the point I talked about with like four four, how base and arbitram have just seen massive increases at the expense of everyone else. And this is kind of the way interoperability will go, too. And he was kind of saying how like, all the liquidity might just go to base over the next couple of years, and then that kind of like, kills the super chain thesis. And now base just like, owns all the liquidity. And so I think, like, in, that's in. In this instance, base is like this l two to ethereum, but now it owns all the liquidity. Sure, it's paying the DA to Ethan.
00:38:27.034 - 00:38:49.090, Speaker B: It's basically an l one at that point. And now it's just like run by Coinbase. I think that's like a. And like this, it kind of kills a lot of these other chains. I think that is like, when people think about the l two future, they're thinking about all these, like, thousands of roll ups that are like, marginally equal in activity and all this. But you could still just come with the same power laws.
00:38:50.070 - 00:39:16.174, Speaker A: I don't know. I think there's a bunch of applications where it makes sense for you to have your own l two. I think one. One example is Athena announced their chain. Still unclear whether that's going to be a chain or an l two or whatever, but to me that makes a lot of sense. You have your own stablecoin. Having a chain that's built around that product, where all the apps are built around that product, you have a uniform user experience, you can use USD as the gas token.
00:39:16.174 - 00:39:43.348, Speaker A: Makes a lot of sense. There's loads of examples like this ronin. It's app specific l two. Like what immutable has done with Polygon. I think there's just endless examples where app specific stuff makes sense. And I agree. Base maybe wins the generalized roll up, or is very well positioned to win the generalized roll up, but I think there's still going to be app specific stuff that kind of makes sense, no?
00:39:43.364 - 00:39:47.120, Speaker B: Yeah, I think there'll be a lot of. I don't want to misspeak. I think there'll be a lot of that.
00:39:47.660 - 00:39:49.708, Speaker C: Yeah, I feel like we talked about this a lot.
00:39:49.884 - 00:39:50.316, Speaker B: Agreed.
00:39:50.348 - 00:40:25.170, Speaker C: So maybe move on. But last thing, just to sum everything up, because I feel like we were getting into some technical stuff, and in case people aren't following, I feel like why you would launch an l two is for ETH liquidity and developer base. But realistically, over time, something like base, if they get enough users on there and have the distribution through Coinbase, you know, why does that necessarily need to be tied to Eth? So that's like something to think about or so. Yeah. Or soul, right? Yeah.
00:40:25.910 - 00:40:35.030, Speaker A: All right, what do you want to hit next? Do you want to do crypto for Harris politics stuff, or do you want to do eigen layer drama that just dropped with their team members getting, I.
00:40:35.030 - 00:40:49.720, Speaker B: Don'T know, a lot of. I mean, so a lot of people are talking about how, like, as camel as odds have increased, prices, like, done worse. I feel like it's probably just random. I don't know how, like, people feel about that.
00:40:50.060 - 00:41:30.838, Speaker C: Well, I think, like, the current administrator, I think if anyone hasn't listened to it, a 16 Z has a really good podcast out. I think it's titled like a 16 z. Little tech Trump, something like that. But basically, yeah. Ben Horowitz and Mark Andreessen, who are like, lifelong Democrats, go through how now, like, they're voting for Trump in this upcoming election because they feel like his policies are much better for innovation. And I think they touch upon crypto, AI, some capital gains tax stuff. But maybe there's one more topic, but it's really good to go listen to, I guess.
00:41:30.838 - 00:41:48.630, Speaker C: Why? Like, kamala, they're talking about this reset, but, you know, she's in office right now, and the Democrats have been pretty negative towards crypto. So I think bitcoin and ETH are going to be fine because they have the ETF, but probably the smaller stuff and, like, the DeFi regulation and that sort of thing is probably.
00:41:49.010 - 00:41:49.298, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:41:49.314 - 00:42:50.082, Speaker D: It's also the people that she's mentioned, she's bringing in have historically been incredibly anti crypto. So it's, you know, follow what they're doing, not what they're saying. And the appointees she's bringing in have not been friendly towards it. So I think it'd be pretty naive to assume that what's happening now is anything other than kind of flimsy pandering after realizing that there's a decent amount of votes and donations from this voter base that they're missing out on. Yeah, it seemed like that crypto for Harris, which. Yeah, calling it crypto for Harris and not Harris for crypto seems like a pretty simple mistake to avoid. But I didn't really listen to it, but just kind of tuning into a bunch of those who felt like getting feedback from a bunch of those who did, who are pretty objective, not really leaning one way or the other.
00:42:50.082 - 00:43:12.010, Speaker D: It seemed like a loose effort and a weak one at that. It was some live, some pre recorded, but all of it was basically just kind of reading pre made statements that were generic and not really saying much. And then at the end asking for donations, of course.
00:43:12.950 - 00:44:11.326, Speaker A: Yeah. And on the other hand, Trump, by the way, obviously, I'm not american and I don't have, like, great political takes, I don't think. But listening to Trump's speech in the, at the Bitcoin conference, that was like an insane, you know, like, everything you could have hoped for, I mean, maybe RFK's was even better, but Trump's just like, everything you could have hoped for from a president, right, in terms of what he said, like, right, self custody, bitcoin in the strategic reserve, it's like insanely bullish crypto. Like, understands it, firing Gensler. And on the other hand, Harris, it's hard to figure out her policies on anything, but definitely on crypto, it's been, there's just been nothing. And I do think it's very bearish if, because it just makes it hard to build crypto projects in the US. And the US has most of the talent and most of the capital in the world.
00:44:11.326 - 00:44:25.272, Speaker A: Like, realistically, most of the dev, talent, most of the capital is there. And so if Gensler keeps going and it's just going to be so bad for the. I think it's very bad for innovation and for the, for the industry. I mean, all this stuff is pretty obvious.
00:44:25.416 - 00:45:07.394, Speaker D: Like, I think you can make the argument that, that Harris is like, bullish bitcoins, bullish memes. Right. Because they're just going to keep spending, which should kind of continue the existing tailwinds for crypto, which is, you know, currency debasement, et cetera, et cetera. And so that that's bullish bitcoin. And then she's obviously going to be very stringent on the regulatory side, which is kind of bearish. Any l one s and a lot of the protocols, but bullish memes that are very clearly not securities and they're just other ways for people to cycle BTC gains or put in fresh powder, whereas I think Trump is kind of ends up being a bit more bullish. Everything.
00:45:07.562 - 00:45:16.874, Speaker A: I mean, maybe just quick comments on the Eigen layer thing and then we can end it. What do you think this Eigen layer, and by the way, small investors in Eigen layer ventures.
00:45:16.922 - 00:45:17.510, Speaker C: So.
00:45:18.770 - 00:45:19.362, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:45:19.466 - 00:45:38.386, Speaker B: Yeah. I don't know. So the thing is, they gave team wallets to a bunch of projects that were building on top of eigen layer so they could give them airdrops. Yeah, I don't. I mean, I don't think it's a good thing. I mean, I know that it happens a lot. I don't know how much there is to say about it.
00:45:38.386 - 00:45:44.860, Speaker B: Like, I don't know.
00:45:45.020 - 00:45:47.604, Speaker C: Bad. Bad. Unethical.
00:45:47.692 - 00:45:49.560, Speaker B: Yeah, I, like, I don't think it's good.
00:45:49.940 - 00:46:23.492, Speaker A: I mean, but, like, you know, Celestia airdrop to contributors to the Cosmos SDK and, like, to GitHub handles. There's a lot of, there's a lot of manual stuff. Like, airdrops always have a bunch of manual stuff. And, like, realistically, these projects would not exist were it not for Eigen layer. I can, I can see why it would be like a gesture to try to airdrop to the Eigen lair team. You built the infrastructure on which my LRT exists. I want to reward you for that in the same way that people do with airdrops, try and reward people who contributed to the space overall.
00:46:23.492 - 00:46:37.920, Speaker A: If there was any, and they mentioned there was some teams felt pressured to do it, that's obviously not cool. But the thing itself, I think, is kind of like an offshoot of what already happens with.
00:46:38.620 - 00:46:59.120, Speaker D: I think you just have to disclose it. To be honest, the fact that it comes out through an article is not great. But if you're, if you're kind of upfront about it, then it's easy to rationalize. Then it doesn't feel like you're doing something sneaky. Because, I mean, you know, same arguments directionally can be made about the whole, why is this NFT community getting this airdrop? It's like insiders doing insider things.
00:46:59.580 - 00:47:03.984, Speaker A: And then, I mean, restaking as a whole. Yeah, maybe we don't have time to get into that.
00:47:04.152 - 00:47:25.816, Speaker B: I mean, we have. I don't know. I think we've yet to see anything truly interesting with restaking. Yeah, I think eigen da mainnet just went live. And so thing is, I think they're, they're starting off with like ten eth of rewards per month, and that's shared across, like, everyone. Right. So it's just like immaterial.
00:47:25.816 - 00:47:27.694, Speaker B: Like it's no money.
00:47:27.792 - 00:48:25.272, Speaker A: So, yeah, I mean, my thing is, I think restaking as a concept makes a lot of sense. Like, you want economic value, securing people, doing things on chain that can't be secured trustlessly so you can slash and stuff like this. I just think no one cares about it right now in crypto. And there's like ample evidence that economic security is just a meme, right? Everything from chainst, like with very low market caps not being attacked to chains being attacked and the price not reacting at all to all these articles that all of Defi relies on that are sort of multisigs or admin keys. There's like, I think a lot of evidence that it doesn't matter right now. Hopefully if the industry matures at some point, it will matter. But even if it does matter, I don't think it warrants the amount of investment and attention and mind share that has gone into the various clones and offshoots of like, restaking for x.
00:48:25.272 - 00:48:34.616, Speaker A: You know, I just think a lot of that has been a huge waste of capital and sort of time.
00:48:34.768 - 00:49:08.070, Speaker B: I would also say the biggest shift in restaking over the past few months is that, like, restaking, when it was pitched was like, oh, this is bullish for ETH, right? It was pitched as like a solution for ETH, the asset. It wasn't pitched as like, people want Avss. It was, this will be good for ETH. And now you can just use any asset you want. Like, you can use Athena stable, you can use like, it's pretty generalizable. You can use most things now because restaking is a primitive. Like, yeah, you can use whatever, you can use a bored ape, right? Like, it doesn't matter.
00:49:08.070 - 00:49:41.410, Speaker B: And so you're seeing that aspect open up a lot. And you're even seeing now, like, AVSs will be able to stake their own tokens. So you've kind of come like for a full circle in a little sense, where it's like now you are reintroducing the native token of the protocol to be used as staking. And like, sure, you can have other assets backing it too. So it's not just based on the protocols token, but like, I think that's the biggest change we've seen in just the overall restaking narrative. Yeah.
00:49:43.150 - 00:50:02.182, Speaker C: Yeah. Kind of overhyped. Like, you're never going to get enough economic value. It seems like they have so much tvl now that are they really going to be able to generate enough, like a natural yield, not through inflation, to make it worth it, taking on the extra risk or just like supporting these valuations? Probably not, but I guess we'll see.
00:50:02.326 - 00:50:07.586, Speaker A: Yeah, the mad size, always a tough thing, especially when for a lot of these projects, you're competing with their native token.
00:50:07.618 - 00:50:07.786, Speaker C: Right.
00:50:07.818 - 00:50:09.994, Speaker A: Which they can use for securing stuff entirely.
00:50:10.042 - 00:50:11.670, Speaker D: It's all subsidized, right?
00:50:12.210 - 00:50:24.830, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. All right, guys. Yeah. Good first episode. We suck at ending these things. Maybe we can all say bye this time, make it a bit less awkward.
00:50:24.830 - 00:50:34.268, Speaker A: Thanks very much for tuning in to our first episode of the high of mind on Empire. I hope you enjoyed. Please subscribe. Is that a thing?
00:50:34.324 - 00:50:34.920, Speaker D: Yes.
00:50:37.220 - 00:50:39.148, Speaker A: Please tweet at us with what?
00:50:39.284 - 00:50:40.520, Speaker D: Get a new laptop.
00:50:41.460 - 00:50:53.436, Speaker A: Yeah, Duncan, please get a new laptop so we don't have storage issues anymore. And, yeah, thanks very much for tuning in. Tweet at us with anything you want us to talk about next time. We love you. There is no time.
00:50:53.468 - 00:50:54.860, Speaker C: All right, goodbye. Thank you.
