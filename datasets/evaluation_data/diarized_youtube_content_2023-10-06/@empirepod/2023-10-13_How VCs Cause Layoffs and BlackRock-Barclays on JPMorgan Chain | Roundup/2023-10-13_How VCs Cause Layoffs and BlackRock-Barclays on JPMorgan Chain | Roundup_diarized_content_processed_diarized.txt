00:00:00.400 - 00:00:43.354, Speaker A: This episode is brought to you by the Chronicle protocol, a cost efficient, transparent, and decentralized Oracle. Chronicle has developed a next generation oracle primitive called Scribe, which reduces oracle gas fees on l one s and l two s by over 60%. You'll hear more about Chronicle later in the show. The product you already know and love just got even better. If you are stressed about managing your on chain portfolio across different wallets and different chains, I'm super excited to tell you about metamask portfolio, which lets you manage all of your crypto across networks and wallets in one place. Do more in web three your way with the metamask portfolio manager. You will hear more about them later in the show.
00:00:43.354 - 00:00:52.754, Speaker A: All right, everyone, welcome back to another roundup recording this Thursday afternoon. Santi, how we doing, man?
00:00:53.254 - 00:00:57.384, Speaker B: Doing great. We miss you. Last week, we had Casey on talk about the, you know, everything.
00:00:57.424 - 00:01:04.416, Speaker A: I didn't know if I was gonna get the look back. I didn't. People were joking. I was not gonna get the invite back, and it seemed kind of real.
00:01:04.480 - 00:01:26.154, Speaker B: So a lot of people seem to like that. You know, for me, it was eye opening because I had, you know, no idea what goes on to these things. And so it was weird, eye opening, really fascinating stuff that's transpired since, of course, we had, like, key witnesses. We're gonna talk about a little bit of that. Hopefully. We have casey on, you know, maybe next week to give us a more of an update. But I'm doing great.
00:01:26.154 - 00:02:13.616, Speaker B: You know, I think, look, a lot of stuff is going on in the world, and it's one of those things where, like, you know, I always tell my parents, I remember once I was like, look, if. If my emotional state was directly impacted by the price of crypto, I'd be a wreck. Like, I would have already died of a heart attack. And so I think one of the things that I've learned in crypto is to kind of shield what happens in. In the crypto world in the volatility and everything. Like, separating, like, your work environment from your house environment is critical. Um, and, like, that sometimes has been challenging for people, especially as you work from home, but nonetheless, like, yeah, like, I think one of the things that is important is just maintaining a level of optimism and just in the cause.
00:02:13.616 - 00:02:57.348, Speaker B: I think, like, Twitter and the news inherently, like, skews negative and portraying a lot of the bad things. And I always like to remind myself and going back to, like, there's this great, like, book and video as well, like, YouTube on Hans Rosling, who is a data scientist, german data scientist, I believe, passed away. But he was like, he has a great book about. Just talking about quantitatively, like, the world has become a better place. It is a better place today than it was, like, 100 years ago, like, in terms of conflict, in terms of poverty, like, across the board. But I think, like, because we're so connected, 24 7365. And these news and the algorithms just want to feed us stuff that skews, like, attention seeking stuff and headline seeking stuff.
00:02:57.348 - 00:03:16.964, Speaker B: We see this a lot in crypto, but we're seeing it a lot in, like, geopolitics and whatnot. But I, you know, it's important, like, zoom out, just like, you know, be grateful, but also just keep your head cool in many ways. So, yeah, so long winded way of saying, I'm doing okay, doing great. You know, a lot of things to talk about. So, uh, yeah. How are you doing?
00:03:17.784 - 00:03:30.632, Speaker A: I'm doing all right. Doing all right. It's been a. It's been a shit show of a week. I was actually debating, and I said I wasn't sure if I wanted to bring up, you know, everything that's going on in Israel. But there's. There is one thing I wanted to call out, which is, um, there's actually.
00:03:30.632 - 00:04:16.744, Speaker A: I'm gonna. I don't really have anything to say that's outside of, you know, what everyone else is saying on Twitter and stuff. But there is actually just one resource I want to call out that's very relevant to a lot of companies actually in crypto. So there's a lot of israeli founders in crypto, and I used to work, before founding blockworks, I worked at an israeli tech startup called Scisense, and a lot of people who work at these companies with oftentimes israeli founders. A lot of the employees are in the reserves, and a lot of folks are getting called up to the reserves right now. So there's actually this resource doc that this couple, Zoe and Michael Burian, put together where if you, let's say there's a company, I think chaos labs might be one of these companies. Like, half their employees are a good chunk of their employees.
00:04:16.744 - 00:04:52.124, Speaker A: I don't know the exact numbers, or I saw the CEO of digital asset Yuval is going to Israel. If you have a lot of employees in the reserves, that means half your staff is gone and not working. So Zoe and Michael put together this resource request form where you can actually put in. I'm a data analyst. I'm a salesperson. I'm willing to allocate 5 hours of my week to stepping in to basically fill the time gap for these folks in the reserves. We'll put a link in the show notes that I know a lot of crypto companies who have been impacted, who have a lot of employees who are going to the reserves right now.
00:04:52.124 - 00:04:58.444, Speaker A: We're getting called up. We'll put a link in the show notes for the volunteer talent forum.
00:04:59.204 - 00:05:23.684, Speaker B: Yes. I mean, needless to say, I was, I'm an investor in chaos labs. I'm going to at least, I think six or seven of my portfolio companies are either directly based in Israel or half the team because the founders are from Israel. It's a thriving ecosystem, cybersecurity wise. Like, a lot of the intelligence, former intelligence unit, like, really, a lot of talent is there. And so, you know, obviously difficult times. So, yeah, that's great research.
00:05:23.684 - 00:05:26.304, Speaker B: Definitely. Check it out if you guys are interested.
00:05:28.204 - 00:05:40.384, Speaker A: All right, a couple things to talk about this week. We had SPF trial. I think we should start there. I actually texted Casey to see if she wanted to come on this week again, but no response because you remember you have to lock your phone up in the courthouse, so.
00:05:40.804 - 00:05:41.508, Speaker B: That's right.
00:05:41.596 - 00:05:55.912, Speaker A: No, Casey. We'll try to do our best summary. But it's funny, right after you guys recorded, we got a bunch of messages. The Empire podcast. This podcast was used as, uh, as a evidence. As a document. Yeah, as Evie.
00:05:55.912 - 00:06:06.764, Speaker A: As evidence. They actually played this clip of our podcast when I think this was before you were a co host, when. When we had Sam on the podcast, as I was like, oh, is that my living room? And, uh.
00:06:08.664 - 00:06:25.774, Speaker B: Yeah, well, it's pretty interesting because Sam was doing a lot of the circuit, right? He was going around, I was with him, and he was very critical of Defi. And of course, I was on the other side and debating with him, um, defi. And so there's. Yeah, that's pretty interesting.
00:06:26.834 - 00:06:54.462, Speaker A: All right, so this, so big, big thing from this week was Caroline Ellison Tuesday and Wednesday. So maybe I'll do a little bit of a recap of Tuesday, get into Wednesday. We can talk through some of this stuff. So Tuesday, some of the highlights. Allison said that she didn't really feel qualified to be Alameda's co CEO, but is no biggie. She reported to SPF, her salary and compensation came out. She was making two hundred k a year, but had this nice $20 million annual bonus that came at least in 2021.
00:06:54.462 - 00:07:31.528, Speaker A: She said that SPF really pushed her and the team to borrow as much money as they could, which led to roughly 10 billion in outstanding third party loans by the middle half of 2022. He also, SBF told Caroline that political donations were a really good use of their money and that relatively small amounts of money could be used for influence. So when we saw things like that, I think it was five or 10 million donated to now President Biden. This is interesting to hear him talking to Caroline about this stuff. Kind of early on, we also learned that SBF believed that he had a 5% chance of becoming president.
00:07:31.616 - 00:07:37.404, Speaker B: So he wanted to buy Snapchat and also wanted to be president. I mean, the man wanted to do it.
00:07:37.804 - 00:07:53.428, Speaker A: So this was. You mentioned Snapchat. So there's this list that was called things SBF, really just things Sam is freaking out about. List. Here were the things that Sam was freaking out about. This is bulleted list. Hedging bad pr in the next six months.
00:07:53.428 - 00:08:18.364, Speaker A: User experience broken down into sub bullets. VIP's API, throughput and click traders front end being laggy. Another bullet. Getting regulators to crack down on binance, raising from mbs, getting capital from blockfi, Alameda, modulo relationship. I don't know what Modulo is. Willy being happy, I don't know who will. He is insto stock onboarding, Reddit, buying snap.
00:08:18.364 - 00:08:43.364, Speaker A: I'm not sure if that's buying the stock snap or buying. He wanted to buy out of snap trading jgbs. What is that? Japanese government bonds, I think the ten years bad english language content and making bonus process better for next semester. So he's got some big things on this list here. Um, if we start to look at. Yeah, go ahead.
00:08:43.704 - 00:08:49.604, Speaker B: No, I was just a first and foremost hedging. Well, hedging. There's not a lot of that going on.
00:08:49.904 - 00:08:52.280, Speaker A: Yeah. Um, raising money.
00:08:52.312 - 00:09:27.244, Speaker B: So interesting here. Nothing. There's nothing in this list that talks about security. And as we've learned, of course, like, they just had terrible opsec. Like, like, they just. And I think there's another tweet that we can look at in the show notes that talks about all the different hiccups that they had. Really just like, negligent in terms of, like, running a secure infrastructure and managing keys that led to losses across, like, they were yield farming aggressively in, like, unvetted, unverified contract protocols.
00:09:27.244 - 00:10:10.744, Speaker B: They lost a ton of money there. They then also had money frozen in China in a chinese exchange, which we'll talk about that later. They also had, I believe, that they were held hostage by this other Defi protocol that didn't want to release their funds, and then they lost a ton of funds there. Then, of course, during the whole insolvency process, I think the famous FTX hacker, which is apparently now linked to Russia, believes, like, you know, hacked a bunch of ETH. Right. It was like, in the order of, like a couple hundred, like 100, 200 million or so. So anyways, a lot of losses in their operations, which is crazy, you know?
00:10:11.964 - 00:10:51.550, Speaker A: Yeah, there was. So the lead prosecutor, Danielle Sassoon, prompted Ellison to kind of elaborate on one of those losses, and she ended up talking about this $800 million loss that FTX sustained in 2021 while trading BTMX, which I don't know what that is. And they said that the massive. She said the massive loss was due to a margin system malfunction. And the kicker is that when this happened, SBF told Alameda, said that Alameda needed to take the loss because he didn't want it on FTX's balance sheet. So even back in 2021, he was kind of kicking these funds over. Other thing that I'm trying to kind of figure out and what? Like, what? Trying to trace this money.
00:10:51.550 - 00:11:37.364, Speaker A: And I know some folks at blockworks are looking into this, is there's this whole thing around thai sex workers and bribes of chinese government officials. Um, so if you actually look at what. So it sounds like SBF sent 100 million, between 100 to 150 million to different crypto addresses that they believe to be tied to chinese officials with the hopes of gaining access to about a billion in Alameda funds that were frozen by chinese government officials as part of this money laundering investigation. And the money was frozen on Huobi and I think OKX. So one of my questions becomes, is there still a billion of customer funds on OkEx and Huobi? Are those still there? I'm not entirely sure.
00:11:38.224 - 00:11:39.444, Speaker B: I'm not sure either.
00:11:39.744 - 00:11:40.524, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:11:42.424 - 00:12:41.814, Speaker B: Yeah. Apparently there was an employee at FTX that had. Her dad was a chinese government official, and she warned them against not doing this. And then she got promptly fired, and they still went ahead and kind of, you know, try to bribe them and send this money to various officials. I don't actually know the outcome of this, but of course, it's pretty damning in terms of not only is this the foreign corrupt practices act, I believe, that is in violation of, and the implications are, you know, people that are within, in this signal chat, they are all implicated. Caroline, Sam, Ryan, Salome, and also Trabuco was on that thread, and so now he is implicated, and everyone is wondering, well, where the hell is Trabuko? And that's like, the. That's the biggest question in all of this is like, where is this guy? And at one point, is he gonna show up?
00:12:42.154 - 00:12:42.674, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:12:42.754 - 00:12:49.790, Speaker B: And I gotta think he's under witness protection or whatnot. But we haven't heard at all from him, and he is obviously a big player in all of this.
00:12:49.982 - 00:13:12.910, Speaker A: Yeah. There's one more key thing that Caroline talked about, which is that at one point in the summer of 2022, the Genesis requested a return of 500 million. Right. Due to starting, like, they started to get really concerned. And let me just read. I'll read the quote from the testimony. Ellison says Genesis was getting recalls from retail lending platforms.
00:13:12.910 - 00:13:44.974, Speaker A: So they asked us for 500 million. Other side says, what did the defendant tell you about his call with Matt Balansweig of Genesis? Ellison says that Genesis might go under, so we should send it to them. Sassoon says, the prosecutor says, when you sent this balance sheet to Genesis, did you consider it to be dishonest? Ellison said yes. So this is interesting. I don't know. There were a lot of people asking FTX back for money, and they said no to a lot of people, but they said yes to Genesis. So it makes me wonder, kind of like, why that happened.
00:13:45.314 - 00:14:20.164, Speaker B: Yeah. Importantly, I think Sam made a statement in there that said he wanted to prioritize repaying Genesis and holding off on repaying blockfi. We'll have to understand why that was and what his thinking was around there. That'd be good to know. And the other thing is, as I'm reading all of this, I got a, like, I was thinking about that scene. There's a great documentary of Madoff, Netflix. There was this particular guy that was a longtime investor in Madoff's funds that knew that Madoff was running a Ponzi.
00:14:20.164 - 00:14:58.284, Speaker B: And instead of sounding the alarm, he tried to extort Madoff and wanted to get his money out before others. And so he went to Madoff and said, hey, I'll call you out. I'll write you out, or unless you just give me back my money and all the returns that are on paper. And then that came out during the whole investigation afterwards. And so in a similar manner, I got to think, obviously, CZ really tripped all of this out because he at some point realized, because FTX was sending a bunch of money to Alameda. Alameda was then doing this arb across exchanges. Right? If there's a price delta between FTX and binance, it would send.
00:14:58.284 - 00:16:10.730, Speaker B: So they were interacting with a lot of exchanges and counterparties. Maybe not a single counterparty was able to understand the entire flow of their operations. But I think from there was a lot of people that were looking on chain these wallets. I think at some point, ZZ realized what was going on, and then he sold all his FTT. But it also raises the question, like, at what point did these counterparties, Genesis, Blockfi, Gemini, kind of knew that they were in a very precarious spot. Of course, they were getting fed these spreadsheets, which is part of the testimony of Caroline, these, like, fabricated spreadsheets that just had erroneous numbers on them, omitted numbers of loans of a number of, like, of positions and whatnot. And so at what point do you just not, like, do you look at that? And at what point did they realize that was the case? So, yeah, I mean, of course, this is something that, if I'm the prosecutor, I would really want to go deep on just understanding all the other different counterparties in their relationship, maybe to salvage themselves.
00:16:10.730 - 00:16:32.634, Speaker B: They didn't want to sound the alarm, and they wanted to get the capital back. But when you have this priority, if, you know, you're insolvent and you prioritize one credit over another, then you have to peel all that back, I think. Because in the Madoff case, you remind Yana, you know this better probably than I do, but a lot of the people that got money ahead of others like this priority, they had to give it back.
00:16:32.754 - 00:16:34.014, Speaker A: Um, right.
00:16:34.874 - 00:17:00.304, Speaker B: So anyways, just exactly. Just, just very interesting. All I mean, is Caroline over? I think she's gonna. Maybe there's another day or two, but she's been very revealing every. I mean, we're just covering, like, probably scratching the surface. I mean, there's a ton of stuff. There's people that have done great threads documenting all the kind of the testimony, but just some really interesting tidbits here and there.
00:17:00.384 - 00:17:41.293, Speaker A: All right, let's move on to another piece of news. So big Blackrock Barclays trade on JPMorgan's blockchain system that they've kind of set up here. If you guys remember the episode we did with Tyron, he started talking about hinting that something big was coming, and I think this might have been it. This was the first ever. The way I understand it is this is the first use of tokenized. So basically, Blackrock tokenized money market fund shares and sent those as collateral to Barclays and basically to be used as derivatives margin. So they posted this tokenized MMF collateral for a live trade using the kind of new onyx digital assets Dapp called TCN.
00:17:41.293 - 00:18:14.250, Speaker A: And so Tyrone sent this to me. He's like, this is actually a really good use of blockchain. Like, more people should talk about this. The kicker here is that something like this, using this kind of collateral to post would usually take at least a day. There's t plus one basically for this collateral to post. This collateral in this case took 1 second to post. So as Tyron put it, he said, we believe that ultra fast collateral will bring huge value to what is a $25 trillion collateral industry.
00:18:14.362 - 00:18:44.844, Speaker B: Oh yeah, yeah. I mean, people complain on chain, right, when there's like high gas that you need to refill your collateral. And look, folks, I mean, yeah, of course. Like the problem is on chain, you can get liquidated without notice. Like if you don't meet, uh, you know that if your health factor drops below one and you don't want to pay the super high gas fees, like as we've seen in these like high volume environments, you get liquidated, right. But in the real world, like you still need to meet margin calls and the settlement is just like super antiquated. Like t plus, as you said, one or two.
00:18:44.844 - 00:19:29.060, Speaker B: And just having the ability to instantaneously meet your margin call by tokenizing this collateral, very liquid collateral and money market fund is hugely valuable. Yeah. Both from like, I mean, a whole point. And I think in the episode, you know, we, we wanted to dive deeper and we're going to have to have him on again. Talking about this is really quantifying the cost saves on just the record keeping of just doing instantaneous atomic settlement. I got to think that that alone involves a pretty significant cost save on the operation side. People might be listening, saying, okay, cool, a test.
00:19:29.060 - 00:19:58.624, Speaker B: What's next? How big can this get? How real is it going to be? Any sense of what's next year? Is this going to now be the norm? Can everyone adopt? This is Goldman and other investment banks that are competitors at JPMorgan. Want to play ball in Onyx or does this move to Ethereum? I'm just curious if you have an opinion on that.
00:19:59.164 - 00:20:21.030, Speaker A: I think the kicker here is that it was Blackrock. That's, that's what I would say is the, is the most important part of this. Uh, without saying too much, I do. So Blackrock has their bitcoin ETF, right? That, that's Blackrock's now in the game, basically. Um, and I think this is the first I would call. There's kind of three elements. When I think of a bank getting into crypto, there's like three elements.
00:20:21.030 - 00:21:08.900, Speaker A: There's, uh. Do you let your private, do you let your private clients hold bitcoin do you, if you're a private client of Goldman or JP Morgan or someone like that, are you able to hold, are you able to hold crypto, bitcoin and ethan, things like that? Second is like, do you partake in the infrastructure play, basically, which is what JP Morgan's leading on here. The third one is, do you do trick? Like, do you trade in it? And do you, do you make markets and things like that right now? So a lot of people used to do the third one. Right now, Goldman is the only bulge bracket that is making markets in crypto. So Goldman is the only one who's doing that. Everyone else backed out. JPMorgan's kind of leading the way on the infrastructure side of things, and a lot of them still are not allowing their customers to hold crypto.
00:21:08.900 - 00:21:15.260, Speaker A: Like, if you're a private client of JPMorgan, you can't hold your bitcoin with them yet, I would say.
00:21:15.372 - 00:21:17.864, Speaker B: So what else we got?
00:21:18.584 - 00:21:19.256, Speaker A: Layoffs.
00:21:19.320 - 00:21:21.004, Speaker B: Well, we have.
00:21:21.544 - 00:21:26.864, Speaker A: I don't really want to talk about layoffs. You'd warrant you'd want. I feel like a lot of this stuff is depressing. You had layoffs at a couple of companies.
00:21:26.904 - 00:21:42.004, Speaker B: I mean, look, we'll talk about it because, you know, putting emotions aside, I mean, we are seeing a bunch of layoffs at Yugalaps ledger chainalysis. What's the other one that I'm blanking on here? Web three foundation.
00:21:43.424 - 00:21:45.378, Speaker A: Polkadot. Polkadot?
00:21:45.466 - 00:22:09.774, Speaker B: Yeah. They fired a bunch of their staff. Yeah. Look, I mean, I think it's one of those things where people are coming to the realization that they need to prioritize Runway and surviving, and it's a tough fundraising environment out there. I do think that the good companies are still getting access to capital. It's very concentrated, very selective. These rounds are still happening.
00:22:09.774 - 00:23:05.486, Speaker B: But, yeah, certainly it's tough, right? I mean, what is still very shocking to me is how some teams were just able to blow through 15, 30 million in one year even more. My guys, like, they're just through body problem, bodies of problems. And the reality is, like, a lot of teams come to me and say, hey, we're gonna raise another 510 million because we want to hire head of marketing and be, I'm like, are you there? Like, why are you gonna, like, you don't even have a product. Like, why don't you just double down on the product? So I think that, here's my rubric. The really good teams are very technical, and it's really lean teams. Founders are very competent and technical, and I was just right before this podcast, I was late because I just got a test, a demo from one of the teams that I was an investor in. And they've just been incredibly lean.
00:23:05.486 - 00:23:53.432, Speaker B: They're very technical and they don't have, it's just a very skeleton organization, like just bare bones, like just building the product and they've identified a niche in the market and they're going after it and it's, you know, those are the teams that are getting funded and they like, on the other hand, there's just the majority, unfortunately, are those teams that just went out and said, I guess we have to bloat an organization because everyone needs to have a chief of staff and head of marketing and going all these conferences. I'm like, wait on, like, hold on here. Build a product, you know, find product, market fit. So, um, yeah, and then the other, of course, is there's probably 80% of the companies that raise money just, you know, you know, return it because they're just milking it at this point.
00:23:53.628 - 00:24:27.966, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think that what's happening with some of these layoffs is there are a lot of the later stage companies, right? Chainalysis Ledger, Yuga Labs, they need big capital. They're raising maybe series B, series C, Series D. And what's happening is they're going to raise capital and the VC's are saying, look, I actually like your company, but your burn is too high. So you need to first cut your burn, then we'll allocate. So I think that's where a lot of, I think that's almost the why behind a lot of these layoffs is. Yeah, and it's funny, I was looking at Defi llamas, like raises tracker shows.
00:24:27.966 - 00:24:49.558, Speaker A: You like, how much venture money has gone into the space every month. The numbers are way off. The numbers are just wrong. And I think the reason for that is because a lot of companies are not announcing their raises right now. So if you were, if you, if you raised at a, you know, 1.5 a year and a half ago, now you need to raise again. You're raising it like a 500.
00:24:49.558 - 00:25:37.400, Speaker A: Now you're down 66%. There's no way you're announcing a big down round. So you try to, you do everything in your power to keep that, that fundraise quiet. This episode is brought to you by Chronicle Protocol, the best on chain source for cost efficient, verifiable data for anyone who listens to empire, a lot, you know that we talk a lot about Makerdao. Well, Chronicle protocol is this novel Oracle solution that has exclusive exclusively secured over 10 billion in assets for maker and its ecosystem since 2017.

Hit the link in the description of today's episode to get started. Um, let's, let's take this into the USDR stable coin. So there's the, there's something called, uh, real USD, which is USDR. It's a stable coin. It depegged this week, price crashed by like 50%. Uh, it is a stable coin that is backed by real estate assets, and it depegged.
00:27:17.192 - 00:27:37.750, Speaker A: Price went down 50%. It was issued by this company, uh, protocol, tangible Dow. It was small. It was a market cap of like 50 million before the price started spiraling. The asset was supposed to be, as they put it. I went to their website, new type of money backed by real estate yields eight to 15% a year. And it looks like they lost their peg due to this big rush of redemptions.
00:27:37.750 - 00:27:46.034, Speaker A: But, I mean, it was fairly small, 45 million, 50 million market cap. I'm honestly surprised stables like this still are still around.
00:27:46.774 - 00:27:55.864, Speaker B: Yeah. Guys, again, the biggest problem here is there's a mismatch of assets and liabilities. Real estate, not very liquid. So.
00:27:57.684 - 00:28:10.824, Speaker A: 62,000 of the US, I was looking at the collateral. There was 62 or 63,000 USDR as the collateral. So they were collateralizing the stable with their own stable. So you start to see the problem there.
00:28:12.284 - 00:28:40.768, Speaker B: Look, this works in the real world because you believe in the. In the faith. I mean, if you look at it, fiat currencies, as you believe in faith of the US government or whatever respective government, doesn't work on chain. Folks like, you know, you can't fabricate trust on chain out of thin air. You need to have real collateral backed by some form demand. Now, you could think demand in block space is real. There's people who want to, there's competition there.
00:28:40.768 - 00:29:02.904, Speaker B: Whether you believe it to be valuable or not, that's your particular opinion. But the market says it's valuable at any given point in time. So it's backed by something. There's compute in a proof of work system, uh, proof of stake. And then, you know, um, there is valuable currency there, but just using your own coin as collateral, folks, please don't do it. It doesn't work. It will fail.
00:29:02.904 - 00:29:35.766, Speaker B: Thank you. That's all I have to say. People should go to the Stablecoin podcast we just recorded last week with, uh, Nick and this other gentleman. What is it, Martin, I'm liking on the name? Yeah, yeah. So anyways, you know, it's. Even though it's crazy, you just said, like, 40 million is not a lot, but like, I still think that's a lot. Like, we as an industry, I think it's not so much the quantum, although some of these hacks are.
00:29:35.766 - 00:29:53.116, Speaker B: And losses are pretty, you know, real. It's more so, like, just from a, like, why do we keep doing this? Yeah, you know, we ought to move on and just like. So anyways, it's a bit. It's a bit discouraging, I think, just to see.
00:29:53.180 - 00:30:06.904, Speaker A: I do think that there are more stable coins coming. I do think we'll see a lot more stable coming in 2024. And I think a lot of people are gonna make the mistake of calling them saying, hey, look, this is just like, know Terra Luna, basically, but they will be.
00:30:06.944 - 00:30:58.334, Speaker B: Yeah. Look, in that episode, I asked Nick, hey, if you were to wave one, how would you design a better stable coin? You know what I mean? Like, algorithmics, I think, are off the table. I think, you know, you could argue all you want, but I think time and time again, and even in the, in the blockchain capital episode we talk about these things that just don't work. And so, yeah, I think I do agree with you. The design space and the category itself, stablecoins is going to be huge. I think there is an opportunity to build better versions of existing stable coins or complementary versions of existing stable coins, just from a diversity standpoint, resiliency standpoint. Like why couldn't there be another consortium backed by major banks or whatever that do a similar USDC version like PayPal is doing it? Well, you know, PAX is whitelists there, stablecoin solutions.
00:30:58.334 - 00:31:29.044, Speaker B: I think we could credibly see multiple flavors of a fully backed stable coin, like whether you like that or not, because it's not censorship resistant, then, well, you might have other options, but you're taking different kind of risks. Right. So. Yeah, yeah, but, but I think it's important to be vigilant around certain experiments and faulty kind of economic or financial assumptions of mechanisms that just don't really work on chain. Yeah, yeah.
00:31:30.464 - 00:31:40.604, Speaker A: Last but not least, then, scroll, scroll. Launch main net this week seemed like kind of a soft launch. I don't know if the mate, if, if the news like leaked or.
00:31:42.704 - 00:31:50.924, Speaker B: They made it around it on Twitter. Yeah, I think. I think they were sensitive around everything that's going on, obviously in the world.
00:31:51.304 - 00:31:51.856, Speaker A: Right.
00:31:51.960 - 00:32:24.744, Speaker B: So I think. But, but yeah, they did kind of launch main net of sorts, which is encouraging. You know, this is a team that we were, I think one of the first, if not the first, to have them on the pod. I mean, of course I'm a seed investor there and I know Sandy and the rest of the team there, so. But we had them on very, very early on. People should go and listen to that podcast. But to me it's really, to be fair, like, it wasn't as obvious back then for me.
00:32:24.744 - 00:32:58.268, Speaker B: And I think I will give credit to Foleyus Jason, who's good friend and I invest in his fund and he was one who was based out there in China. And so my thesis was, I'm not going to be the one to be able to identify these teams. Clearly there is talent statistically. Like there ought to be really high, really, really quality teams that are going to build and continue to build out there. And that was, he brought that deal to me and so that was. Yeah, I'll give him credit for that. I mean, obviously, you know, long way to go still.
00:32:58.268 - 00:33:17.304, Speaker B: I think CK vms are very ambitious proposition, but, and really encouraging but works. And I think these guys are doing really good work. So. Yeah, go listen to the podcast that we recorded with Sandy Way back. I think it was over a year ago, right?
00:33:17.604 - 00:33:25.784, Speaker A: Yeah, early. Cool, man. We can keep it light. Light this week. Quick 30 minutes app. Anything else on your mind?
00:33:27.524 - 00:33:39.084, Speaker B: No, I'm just thinking of. Well, as we always like to wrap episodes of things you're reading or watching. I have. I have recommendations for both reading and watching because, you know.
00:33:39.124 - 00:33:39.962, Speaker A: All right, hit me.
00:33:40.068 - 00:33:41.434, Speaker B: But I want to ask you first.
00:33:43.254 - 00:33:45.954, Speaker A: I'm watching David Beckham documentary on Netflix.
00:33:46.894 - 00:33:48.114, Speaker B: Why are you still my.
00:33:48.534 - 00:33:49.190, Speaker A: Was that yours?
00:33:49.222 - 00:34:01.454, Speaker B: No, I was gonna. I did watch it all. I mean, David Beckham was like a. It was a hero of mine. I would wake up early, early Saturday and Sundays, like, 06:00 a.m. To watch English Premier League games. Specifically.
00:34:01.454 - 00:34:33.854, Speaker B: Man, you like? Oh, God. Like, that team, like, amazing. I have fond memories, but to be fair, I didn't know a lot of the things in the documentary were, like, eye opening to me. The fact that he was, like, vilified when he, like, got a red card during a World cup match, I think that I did not know the level of. He got a lot. A lot of shit from, you know, in months and months at a time. And then, like, the english fans had no mercy.
00:34:33.854 - 00:34:40.024, Speaker B: But fascinating, fascinating. I love these type of documentaries. Really?
00:34:40.064 - 00:34:40.644, Speaker A: Really.
00:34:42.104 - 00:34:43.536, Speaker B: That was mine as well.
00:34:43.600 - 00:35:08.134, Speaker A: So I saw the tiger one maybe a year and a half ago, then Serena and Venus, semi recently, and then David Beckham. I'm convinced now to have an athlete at this level, you need a parent who is an absolute nut. Like, that's been one of my takeaways from this is like, you think David's dad was like. It was dad. He goes. He goes. The interviewer goes, would you.
00:35:08.134 - 00:35:23.786, Speaker A: Would you punch your dad in the face if you had the opportunity? And the end, David goes, no. Cuz he'd punch me back in the face hard. Like, he. That was all he thought about. He didn't have friends as a kid. Like, he was just soccer, and that got drilled. And his dad.
00:35:23.786 - 00:35:28.854, Speaker A: His dad was just a man, you guy. And was like, my kid will play for menu. So I think.
00:35:29.394 - 00:35:36.026, Speaker B: I didn't think it was portrayed as, like, that much of a obsessive parent. I mean, maybe it's not like Tiger's.
00:35:36.050 - 00:35:37.474, Speaker A: Parents or Serena and Venus.
00:35:37.594 - 00:36:21.324, Speaker B: I think there's, like, levels of that, right? Like, I've heard Max Verstappen, that Formula One driver who just won the championship again this year, three, three times in a row, that his dad also a Formula One driver, not a successful, was incredibly, incredibly harsh. There's a story where he left him behind in a gas station after a race because he didn't come first as a, like a twelve year old or whatever. I mean, you got to think that that traumatized the kid. Up to this day, he's probably thinking every race if he doesn't win, you know that. You know that. Anyways, I didn't think it was that. I mean, of course the dad is passionate as a lot of brits are around football, but.
00:36:21.324 - 00:36:25.600, Speaker B: But yeah, it was certainly. Yeah.
00:36:25.632 - 00:36:26.604, Speaker A: So what are you reading?
00:36:28.224 - 00:36:37.004, Speaker B: There's this great book. I have it open here, my kindle. It's by Rick Rubin called the creative act.
00:36:37.384 - 00:36:39.360, Speaker A: Ah, yeah, I've heard of that.
00:36:39.552 - 00:36:58.934, Speaker B: Rick Rubin, the creative act, a way of being. And it's sort of. I think he's a, he's an artist and he, it's really like a contemporary version of meditations by Marcus Aurelius. It's just very short, almost like haiku like poem like. But it just really, really refreshing actually.
00:36:59.014 - 00:37:04.278, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. He's a legend. He's worked with all the greats. Yeah. Big music.
00:37:04.326 - 00:37:05.718, Speaker B: I don't know much about him, but.
00:37:05.886 - 00:37:33.526, Speaker A: Yeah, he's this music producer who's basically figured out a way to like get the best out of all the, the, you know, the Kanye's and the Biebers of the world. So that's his claim to fame. I have a fat, I have a fun fact for you. ACt scores just hit their lowest level in 32 years. And I think we're just starting to. If you see, if you look at the chart of act scores, it's just like, it's kind of flat or up for like last 40 years and then it just falls off a cliff.
00:37:33.630 - 00:37:38.794, Speaker B: Last couple of years, the top score is what, 30, if I remember, his.
00:37:38.834 - 00:37:40.490, Speaker A: Top score is 36.
00:37:40.642 - 00:37:41.574, Speaker B: 36.
00:37:42.394 - 00:37:56.024, Speaker A: The average used to be it was 2020 and a half. It looks like in 1990, then went up to 21 in 2000, then in 2010 it went up to 21 and a half. Now it's down to 19 and a half.
00:37:56.554 - 00:37:57.650, Speaker B: Good lord.
00:37:57.842 - 00:38:06.954, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think you're starting to see the ramifications of COVID on students, which is a real bummer. COVID plus everyone being addicted to TikTok.
00:38:09.054 - 00:39:09.316, Speaker B: I mean, that's just in the US, right? Because I think it's more of a reflection. There's some really interesting studies around the US actually ranks very, very low and has been for a while on these like standardized tests for even younger kids at the elementary level and middle school, like primary level, they score very poorly, I think the lowest among developed countries, OECD countries, the highest are like, I think Finland and Sweden. I think Finland is number one. There's a fascinating documentary by Michael Moore, I think it's word invade next. That he goes deep into this and goes to these schools in Scandinavia to understand how radically different their system is. It begs the question, the US, and again, I don't want to go again in this topic, but across healthcare, if you plot it, number of expenditures, but outcomes are terrible. Like, on the research side, on the innovation side, fantastic, bar none.
00:39:09.316 - 00:39:41.898, Speaker B: Number one in the world, maybe Israel per capita, but the US is still leading in terms of innovation. But in terms of outcomes, the amount of expenditure per life, per capita and the life expectancy has just gone down in the US. That's not true for other countries. Um, this is a huge outlier, negative way in education. And so it's, uh. Clearly, it's like, it's not a spend, uh, question. It's really just rethinking, hey, systemically, clearly, something's going wrong here.
00:39:42.066 - 00:39:42.434, Speaker A: Uh.
00:39:42.474 - 00:40:12.730, Speaker B: Um. So, yeah, and then, of course, you see, uh, you know, I'm not surprised, actually. Act scores gone down. Like, I mean, this is kind of a joke, these standards, like, these, like, the SAt and the act is basically, uh, another great documentary about like, uh, these parents that, like, there's this guy talking about fraudsters like SBF, like this guy that goes around and like, promises kids that they're gonna, you know, they could pay their way into these, like, top schools. But, yeah, I mean, there's. There's my. I went to Harvard summer school when I was, like, in middle school or high school, I guess.
00:40:12.730 - 00:40:38.896, Speaker B: And one of the biggest realizations for me was like, obviously, you go to, like, it's Harvard, right? It's like, oh, God, right? And then you're like. It was just like, really interesting for me because. And then you go to like. I think it's. If you have the chance, it is very, um, kind of like, eye opening to put yourself in the most competitive of environments. Now, I'm not saying Harvard is the most competitive, but, like. Like, you.
00:40:38.896 - 00:41:12.054, Speaker B: You can think it's. It's elite, right? It's like, in your mind, it's like, if you go to, like, JP Morgan or, like, Wall street. Well, the finance environment, if you want to go to the most competitive, we'll go to New York, right? I think it's just like. It's just a different level and category. And I think it's really nice if you have the opportunity to put yourself in, like, your feet in the fire and say, okay, what is the most competitive environment? And it can be daunting. Like, there's all these stories. Like, there's a great book of Malcolm Gladwell of what the dog saw of, like, how these students, like, they're at the top of their class in high school and then they go to Harvard or, like, an Ivy League, and then they're the worst, right? Because you put the.
00:41:12.054 - 00:41:46.250, Speaker B: And so, like, you know, small fish in a big pond or big fish in a small pond. What would you prefer? What I'm trying to say is, like, I think I would always, like, want to be, want to at least understand what does the most competitive environment look like to then say, okay, at least I know what it looks like. But some people deprive themselves of even, like, going there. And then, of course, the last thing I'll say is, you hear stories of Harvard student associations which are just no accountability, and just say, oh, we couldn't read a statement. I'm like, well, yeah, what's your act score? I don't care. I don't care. Was 36.
00:41:46.250 - 00:42:01.254, Speaker B: There's no accountability and ownership. Like, what are you teaching these kids? So the last, last movie I'll recommend. I'm cheating here. Bonus content. Bonus content. The last, probably the best scene of all time. Scent of a woman.
00:42:01.254 - 00:42:31.854, Speaker B: Al Pacino when he's defending Charlie. Fantastic. Fantastic scene. People should go watch that movie because it's so relevant to what I think is happening in today's society. We're just, what are we valuing? What are we teaching our kids? Like, what values? I think that movie is just hits a soft spot to me. It's just one of the best movies of all time. So, anyways, guys, you came here for crypto, and we're giving you, like, half non crypto content.
00:42:31.854 - 00:42:33.970, Speaker B: Don't kill us. Ever.
00:42:34.002 - 00:42:37.294, Speaker A: Getting back to crypto, crypto conversation. No. All right.
00:42:37.734 - 00:42:45.014, Speaker B: We're not. We're just going to stop talking about crypto because it's, like, so boring. No, I'm kidding. We love crypto here. We'll keep talking about crypto.
00:42:45.054 - 00:42:49.794, Speaker A: But everyone's bear market roundup pod, we haven't even.
00:42:50.334 - 00:43:10.024, Speaker B: Can we go an entire pod without saying the word? Hold on. Challenge. Can we go an entire pod without saying bear market? That is the challenge. And whoever says it from now on will be like the swear jar. And if you say bear market every time you say bear market, like, you're going to have to shave your head or something. But you haven't, clearly.
00:43:10.064 - 00:43:14.904, Speaker A: So I told, I told, I told Brian. I said, brian, you come on the pod. I'm shaving my head.
00:43:14.984 - 00:43:22.384, Speaker B: So it's like saying, yeah, I'm going to do this event. The president shows up to the pot. I mean, come on, man. Like, be realistic here. You need to shave. Brian's coming up.
00:43:22.424 - 00:43:24.616, Speaker A: No, Brian said he's going on the pot a bunch, please.
00:43:24.680 - 00:43:26.564, Speaker B: No. Presidente of crypto man.
00:43:26.864 - 00:43:30.600, Speaker A: Presidente. All right, Brian, if you hear this, join us, my friend.
00:43:30.632 - 00:43:32.520, Speaker B: Brian, come on. The pod. We want to hear from you.
00:43:32.592 - 00:43:36.644, Speaker A: I'm too congested to keep going with this pod. I got to get some tea or something.
00:43:37.124 - 00:43:54.524, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's our time. That's our cue. All right, everyone, thanks for listening. Short round up here. If you have anything that we didn't talk about you want us to talk about, drop us a comment, tweet at us, and we'll try to cover it next week. And, of course, hopefully, we'll have Casey back on to talk about more of the stuff that's happening in the sound district of New York.
00:43:54.644 - 00:43:55.220, Speaker A: See you, folks.
00:43:55.292 - 00:43:55.924, Speaker B: Have a good weekend, everyone.
