00:00:00.280 - 00:00:34.890, Speaker A: It's almost like macro. It's so self referential that it becomes impossible to predict, right? Like, because everyone in the world thinks that rates are going to go down, you know, six months from now. Well, that changes the behavior now such that that belief itself is stimulatory. And then that reduces the probability that rates go down six months from now, for example. Now I'm not a macro guy, but just to draw that comparison, like, there are these capital market systems that are inherently chaotic and you can't go and bring a pattern matching approach to an inherently chaotic system.

I'm going to skip the intro for you because I think everybody knows you at this point. And also new guest on the show, Ray Hindi. Ray is the co founder of L1 Digital, one of the biggest fund to funds in crypto as well as they do a lot of, actually, I think in recent years. Ray, you can fill us in on this. Starting to do more and more venture investments as well, direct venture investments.
00:02:55.732 - 00:02:59.400, Speaker C: So, Ray, welcome to Show Tushar, welcome back, my friend.
00:03:00.500 - 00:03:02.680, Speaker A: Thanks for having me. Great to be here.
00:03:03.260 - 00:03:05.680, Speaker D: Thank you. Very happy to be here.
00:03:06.180 - 00:03:49.824, Speaker C: Ray, I'd love to pick on you for this first, actually, we'd love to hear both your guys take on this. There's a topic that Santi and I have been discussing a little bit that we've kind of grazed over it, which is we're at the point in the cycle where funds should be raising. Funds are raising and funds should be announcing. If you look back at the last several years, just based on where we're at in the cycle where funds are at in their lifecycle, we're at the stage where this summer and into the fall, you should be seeing funds announcing, we just raised 300 million. We just raised 500 million. It feels eerily quiet right now. And I think some of the chatter behind the scenes is, look, I know everyone's excited about crypto on crypto Twitter, but behind the scenes talking to the allocators, there's still not as much appetite.
00:03:49.824 - 00:04:11.670, Speaker C: And so funds are still maybe struggling to raise as much as they wanted to. Ray, can you just give us a look inside what is happening in the fund manager raising ecosystem? And what's it like when, what's happening inside the mind of an allocator here, when they're talking to some of these funds, like a multicoin or polychain or paradigm or folks like that?
00:04:12.650 - 00:04:46.076, Speaker D: Yeah, I'd say that generally, I would say that there's a lot of improvement in terms of interest by allocators. And when I say improvement. So in Switzerland, for example, we've never had more interest from pension funds as ever before. So even compared to 2021. So the quality of investor, or investor interest has, is much higher than in the past, but that doesn't translate into flows yet. So they're learning about the space. They're interested.
00:04:46.076 - 00:05:46.460, Speaker D: You get invited to institutional, to present to institutions all the time, more than ever before. And I would say on a global basis, what we see in terms of, you know, funds assets being raised by funds, I would say that VC's are quietly raising because they're unable to reach their targets and they're reducing them over time and they're taking longer to achieve their final closes because the interest is much lower than in the past. And in addition, there's a lot of competition on the VC side. So yes, we're focused on very large measures out there that we'll be able to raise anyway. They'll raise much less than in the past, in my opinion, unless the environment changes significantly. But also you've got a lot of emerging measures that are hitting the market at the same time, and the competition is really fierce within that stack.
00:05:48.280 - 00:06:06.902, Speaker C: To share what's happening with the fund managers. So I think one maybe data point I'd call out is paradigm raised an $850 million, I think it was fund three. They announced it month or two ago. Seems like a big raise, but thats actually down from there. I think it was a $2.5 billion fund two. So theyve went from $2.5
00:06:06.902 - 00:06:16.250, Speaker C: billion fund two in 2021 down to 850 million. Whats happening inside these fundraise conversations for the different funds?
00:06:17.630 - 00:07:18.644, Speaker A: Yeah, I cant comment specifically about paradigm because I dont know the specific details there, but I can say more generally, theres a perception that if a manager goes and raises a much smaller fund for a subsequent fund, that that is a sign of weakness, that something went wrong. And so you dont see managers itching to announce a new smaller fund, because the perception of that is not very positive. However, the market conditions have changed. A lot of managers took advantage of the capital markets opportunity in 2021 to raise really large funds. Also, the capital markets had enough deployment opportunity at the time. There was enough opportunity to deploy money into deals in 21 in order to justify raising those funds. Now, a lot of those deals aren't going to work out because the prices were too high, and we can discuss that separately.
00:07:18.644 - 00:07:59.550, Speaker A: But a manager's job is to try and match the demand for capital with the supply of capital. And at 2021, activity levels were at all time highs, never seen levels anything like that ever before. And now I think you see managers raising funds, but they don't want to go out there and say, well, I raised a fund that's half the size because it makes them maybe not look as strong as they want to look, even if that is the rational thing to do, because that's how much capital you can responsibly deploy. And I think the best managers are aiming to deploy capital responsibly, not just get Aum as big as possible.
00:08:01.530 - 00:08:08.190, Speaker C: What do you think? Like talking about the supply and demand of capital, like where are we in the supply and demand balance right now?
00:08:10.130 - 00:09:07.843, Speaker A: I think it's different for different markets, for venture. I think we have an oversupply of capital and not enough demand for that capital. You can see this by just how competitive the venture landscape is that Ray was just mentioning. We are seeing new emerging managers, usually starting out with smaller funds who are competing for seed deals. And then you're seeing the bigger managers being forced really to go and deploy into higher valuation, later stage deals that they might not really love as much, but they have to do something. And on the public market side, I think we have an undersupply of capital. For the seven years that we've been running multicoin, we are now seeing the greatest dispersion in returns on the public markets that we've ever seen.
00:09:07.843 - 00:09:30.250, Speaker A: We are seeing that high quality names are trading differently than low quality names. Everything is not as correlated as it used to be. And that, to me tells me that there's more opportunity for active management strategies on the liquid side. But there are very few large liquid managers out there.
00:09:31.070 - 00:09:54.446, Speaker C: Greatest dispersion in crypto history. Meaning historically it used to be BTC would move, everything would move the same, and there was just higher beta on some of the long tail of assets. But now, maybe one day BTC goes down, ETH is flat, and, I don't know, pick your other coin goes up. Is that what you're talking about with dispersion? There?
00:09:54.598 - 00:10:39.120, Speaker A: Exactly. An example is the recent sell off in BTC, driven by the german government sales, where if that had happened a few years ago, I would have expected that all of the higher beta assets would be down dramatically more than BTC. However, if you look at what the price action actually was this time around, that was not the case. You didnt see Sol down 50% or something in reaction to BTC being down 15. I think what were seeing is that dispersion that is leading to more of an opportunity for active managers who are picking names.
00:10:40.540 - 00:11:44.814, Speaker D: Maybe I can approach it in a different way. So when we started looking at this space in 2018, your typical, the liquid side wasn't very interesting because of what Tushar is mentioning, as in the universe of assets was more restricted and typically your typical hedge fund portfolio that you had to pay two and 20 for. Look, as you know, your long BTC ETH and privacy coins. That was at the time in 2018, it was very difficult to find a manager that would differentiate from that consensus portfolio. Since 2020, after Defi and after six years, the universe has expanded substantially. And so today, on the liquid side, you can really, when you look through all those measures you have many different risk premiums that you can get exposure to. And so the supply of tradable assets out there, the universe is way richer, more interesting, and enables you to build a portfolio across managers that is way more robust.
00:11:44.814 - 00:11:54.636, Speaker D: So that supply of liquid assets is very interesting. It's nearly the flip side of the vc supply demand. So it makes it really, really interesting.
00:11:54.798 - 00:12:15.056, Speaker C: Hmm. Ray, maybe we can actually just go down that rabbit hole for a sec. Tell me about the evolution of crypto. Can you just say more about the evolution of crypto funds? Because what it sounds like Im hearing from you is, look, theres been venture, venture funds have dominated. And I saw a metric somewhere. I think it was on crypto, Twitter, im sure the other day where its like 90. Im going to make up this number a little bit.
00:12:15.056 - 00:12:44.100, Speaker C: 97% of the capital deployed today in crypto is venture, 3% is liquidity. In traditional capital markets, that number is flipped. It's all liquid and a small amount of venture. So the Andreessens and Union Square ventures of the world, there's actually a very small amount of capital there, and the real capital is in the public markets. Tell me about the evolution of crypto funds and what you think will happen with this, with the liquid funds coming to market.
00:12:44.760 - 00:13:24.760, Speaker D: Yeah, so I'll start, and Tushar, correct me if I'm wrong on some of the items, because Tushar has been in the market longer, but essentially, when we started, I remember well, and we started looking at the space in 2015. Between 2015 and 2017, there wasn't much to do outside of BTC. So it wasn't interesting for us. But things became interesting at the beginning of 2018. And so we launched our first fund, which is the liquid funded funds, in November 2018. And those were the main vehicles that were available. If you looked at the blue chip managers within the space, they had open ended structures.
00:13:24.760 - 00:14:09.154, Speaker D: They did some venture investments that were structured through side pockets that made a lot of sense. Those would become liquid after a few years and re entered into the liquid pocket of the fund. So it all made sense. And in fact, when we started looking at venture at the time and thinking, hey, should we start venturing into venture? The reason why we wanted to do that was because we serve institutional investors. And the first reaction of institutional investors at the time was, hey, we don't get crypto. We like the space, but would like to have exposure to companies that service the space. So service companies.
00:14:09.154 - 00:14:54.132, Speaker D: And at the time, as you know, we needed to deal with security. We needed to build crypto capital markets through robust exchanges, market makers, etcetera. So you needed to invest in service providers within the space. And I still remember that in around 2019, we were struggling to find high quality venture funds out there. There weren't a lot of them. But then you had that wave of institutional investors that had a preference for equity service companies that, you know, companies that service the space because they understand the equity structure. And so a lot of flows came into venture funds, and obviously a lot of managers started launching venture funds.
00:14:54.316 - 00:15:20.996, Speaker C: Ray, just pause you here as like a snapshot into the market. Back in 2018, 2019, the hottest companies were not arbitrum and Solana and Celeste and these protocols. It was bitgo and fire blocks and coinbase and copper, and it was traditional. It was this nice middle ground between, hey, look, it's actually structured as a traditional company. You're getting the equity. There's no token. There's never going to be a token.
00:15:20.996 - 00:15:22.480, Speaker C: But it's in crypto.
00:15:23.460 - 00:15:46.382, Speaker D: Exactly. And it was easier to sell this to an institutional investor. But seriously, at the time, there weren't enough venture funds doing that. You would struggle to build a portfolio. And so that supply demand was. There was an issue in that supply demand, the demand for capital, no venture funds. And that recalibrated itself over the next few years.
00:15:46.382 - 00:16:46.970, Speaker D: So 2020, 2021, and especially 2022 as well, where consultants started pushing for venture funds, because the only way you can raise capital from institutional investors is supposedly, some consultants out there say that you can protect investors by putting them into a venture fund. That way they don't have to sell at the bottom, which I believe is nothing is unfair, to be honest. And this is why you have massive flows of capitals, of capital, and a lot of funds launching as VC funds, because the capital was there to invest in them. Now, the opportunities, and I think we have a lot of companies that provide security to the space. We have a lot of mature exchanges out there. We have a lot of market makers. And there are exceptions where some managers launch their VC funds to fund decentralized networks, so never went down the equity route.
00:16:46.970 - 00:17:10.390, Speaker D: Those exceptions are very scarce, and those were the most attractive ones, to be honest. But today, the opportunity to fund companies that provide specific services to the space is no longer as attractive as it used to be. And so I believe that this whole supply demand dynamic will flip towards the liquid side.
00:17:11.170 - 00:17:31.050, Speaker C: So let me, can I try to categorize it and then touch. Want you to jump in so it feels like, okay, early managers were just allocating to, like, there was the Pantera bitcoin fund. They're taking two and 20 on basically bitcoin. So that's like first evolution of crypto venture. Next evolution is they say, okay, we want to go raise capital. There's no appetite to invest in any tokens. This is like post ico era.
00:17:31.050 - 00:17:41.618, Speaker C: None of these companies seem like reputable. We can never get a pension to invest in them. So were going to do this nice middle ground of what id call CFI. Anchorage and Bitgo and circle and Coinbase and folks like that.
00:17:41.714 - 00:17:42.210, Speaker B: Okay, cool.
00:17:42.250 - 00:18:19.450, Speaker C: That pulls capital into crypto venture then some of the smartest crypto venture folks. And Ray, I know you guys were I think an early investor in Tushar and multicoins fund one funds like Multicoin said, look, weve got the capital for venture, but really the returns are not going to come from these, what id call CFI companies. Theyre going to come from the protocols. So that's maybe stage three is these venture funds investing in the protocols. They make a lot of money. Obviously, Multicoin has done very well and maybe now we're starting to enter the fourth evolution, which is there's too much money in that crypto venture pocket now investing in protocols. Now maybe some of the alpha is in the public tokens.
00:18:19.450 - 00:18:27.030, Speaker C: And so we're going to start to see an influx of liquid fund managers. Is that a fair categorization of the four stages?
00:18:27.380 - 00:19:08.670, Speaker D: Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. So the exceptions always outperform. So you mentioned the exceptions. So whenever you have a lot of capital moving into a specific strategy, performance is average, the exceptions always outperform. And the expectation is this will happen as soon as the difference in performance becomes really apparent, especially as soon as traditional investors realize in bulk that alpha actually exists in liquid crypto, which doesn't exist in liquid markets anymore. That's how they think.
00:19:08.670 - 00:19:38.822, Speaker D: So a traditional investor, whenever he thinks, okay, active passive management on the liquids, liquid, my liquid exposure is going to be passive exposure. And as soon as I'm going to think active, I'm thinking PE and VC. And that's why they thought about the same way for blockchain and crypto. In addition, you have less mark to market. You don't have to discuss with your IC all the time and exit positions. You go in and you don't come out. I mean, that's the feature.
00:19:38.822 - 00:19:53.460, Speaker D: It's interesting for them, but as soon as they realize that alpha exists in liquid crypto and they need that liquidity, and I can describe how a suspension fund thinks about that liquidity, it's going to become really attractive for them.
00:19:55.160 - 00:19:56.488, Speaker C: Tushar, did you want to?
00:19:56.624 - 00:21:11.860, Speaker A: Yeah, I want to chime in here about this market evolution around crypto venture to liquid strategies. I think for a lot of allocators, you have to look at how the allocator is actually structured, and they have a separate team for venture versus liquidity. And the risk profiles of those teams are very different. And so what happens is it's the venture people at the big allocators who are interested in crypto and not necessarily the public markets teams at those big allocators, but those venture allocators at those institutions are looking for closed end funds, and they want you as a manager to fit into the template of what they are authorized to go do, which is going to be a closed end ten year vehicle, minimal recycling, and some of those basic venture terms. But that then creates this distortion in the market. And Ray said something a moment ago that I want to harp on, because I think its really critical when it comes to capital markets. It is not enough to be right.
00:21:11.860 - 00:21:56.008, Speaker A: You need to be right about something everyone else is wrong about. When something is consensus, you are not going to outperform by following consensus. And so today, the consensus amongst the large allocators, due to these structural reasons that I just described, is putting capital into venture funds and not into liquid funds. And I think that has created the supply glut of capital on the venture side, which is going to mean that the liquid side outperforms because it's non consensus and there's more opportunity there. You have less competition. Capital markets are all about competition. It's not just about how great your brand is or how smart you are.
00:21:56.008 - 00:22:12.010, Speaker A: It's also really the primary determinant is how much competition do you have? And then what is your entry price? And that is probably the most important factor for returns more than anything else. And so looking for the non consensus piece, I think is critical.
00:22:12.830 - 00:22:46.710, Speaker C: Do you guys think that there will ever be appetite for the maybe the two part question here, will there be appetite for the CFI companies again? And I think CFI maybe of 2018 and 2019 was, it was all market structure companies, I would guess. I actually kind of hate this word of CFI. It's just like investing in the equity of companies where there's no expectation of a token 2018, 2019. That is the custodians and prime brokers and folks like that. Do you think that there will ever be appetite for that? And will it end up being maybe the consumer companies, or what does that look like?
00:22:48.010 - 00:23:08.846, Speaker A: So I have some thoughts here. Two things that I want to say, the first thing is, I think we need to see the IPO window for crypto companies open up again. And hopefully that happens with a change in regulators and just making the environment a little bit friendlier for these crypto companies, because.
00:23:09.038 - 00:23:31.528, Speaker C: Can you say why that's so important? Because I think that a lot of people don't understand that. And as someone operating who's operated a company with no token for seven years in crypto, it's a point that Mike and I talk about a lot. Why is this IPO window opening up so, so, so important for, for crypto? And how does the IPO market kind of flow back to series D and series c and things like that? Maybe just expand on that?
00:23:31.664 - 00:24:07.594, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. When a company goes public, the investors and founders and employees are now able to access public market liquidity. When the company is private, you just own the shares. They're worth something on paper, but you can't really transact with them easily unless you're SpaceX or something, or OpenAI, one of the really big giants that people do want to transact in. And so because it's illiquid, you can't show any returns to your investors for a venture fund. Like, you're not gonna have any DPI because you can't distribute illiquid private shares. It doesn't work.
00:24:07.594 - 00:24:48.620, Speaker A: And so if you can't show any DPI, it's gonna be harder for you to raise subsequent funds and harder to raise more capital to then go deploy back into that strategy. So if you were a fund that invested in a lot of crypto equity, like companies building in crypto, and you haven't had any real liquidity events, well, it's hard to go back to your LP's and say, hey, this strategy is doing so well. Please give me some more capital to keep on doing this. You need to give them proof that it's doing well, and the proof that LP's really care about is DPi. That's. The proof is in the pudding. There's no paper marks.
00:24:48.620 - 00:24:53.280, Speaker A: Sometimes people look at paper marks, but you really have to look at DPi.
00:24:53.940 - 00:25:32.846, Speaker D: And just to say, by the way, the divergence between venture funds that did equity, let's say 2019 vintages, roughly 2018, 2019 venture funds that did equity, mostly equity, and venture funds that did mostly decentralized networks. I mean, the first one has no DPi, and the second one has, on average, we're talking about minimum six, six x, sorry, three and a half to four X Dpi. So. And the performance is diverse. Divergences is massive. So for them to raise their next fund, it's really difficult to compete with some of those exceptions. Does that make sense?
00:25:32.998 - 00:25:56.912, Speaker C: 100%, yeah. I mean, if you think about some of the big companies you could have invested in circle in their seed round, kraken in their seed round, bitgo in their seed round, you would have zero returns. You would have zero returns. Now, maybe you did some secondaries or whatever, but the gargantuan returns that you should have have been locked up, right?
00:25:56.976 - 00:25:57.272, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:25:57.336 - 00:26:02.060, Speaker D: I mean, there were some that were able to do some secondaries, but those, again, are exceptions.
00:26:03.040 - 00:26:22.016, Speaker C: But it's very difficult, I think, of a fund like blockchain capital, right? They're like the first fund in crypto. They've done a lot of amazing token deals. Right. The eigens of the world and stuff like that. But also they. I think they were the seed investor in. I think they might have led the first ever round in Kraken, like Kraken should be.
00:26:22.016 - 00:26:52.230, Speaker C: There are a couple companies that, like, will probably hit the IPO market if maybe we have a change in administration. There's, like, Kraken Circle, some folks like that. Like, I imagine blockchain capital is sitting there waiting for crack into IPO, and, like, that's a. That could be a bit. I don't know how much equity they have. Maybe that's a billion dollar unlock for them, which then means they can return capital to their original lp's, which means they have more success raising again. It starts this flow of innovation, innovation Capital, I'd say, which is very needed.
00:26:52.230 - 00:27:38.936, Speaker C: Ray, going back to the liquid funds, when you invested in crypto managers like Tushar and Kyle, you looked for very. I would say you looked for very crypto native people, I would assume, and sacrificed on the operational side of things. I'm making an assumption about Tushar and Kyle here. I think the assumption can be made about a lot of the best crypto fund managers. If you looked at their funds in 2018, I bet the back end and operational stuff was a total nightmare, and they ended up figuring that side of things out. But what they had was alpha on the crypto side. Now, does the same thing apply for liquid crypto? Are you looking for people who have traded the crypto market, public crypto markets, for a while, or are you saying, look, there's actually a different skill set you need.
00:27:38.936 - 00:27:46.380, Speaker C: I'm going to go find someone from two Sigma who's just coming in and saying, this is a really inefficient market. Let me build a fund around this.
00:27:47.520 - 00:28:27.182, Speaker D: Okay, I think those are two different questions. But if I refer to the operational side, I would say that the operations of an open ended structure or hedge fund is way, way more complex and more difficult to DD than a venture one. And yes, you're absolutely right. The operational status of most crypto native launches out there are horrific. And that makes sense, right? Because that's not their skill set. They didn't come from a traditional hedge fund, and you don't want them to. But this is where we come in, because we have that experience.
00:28:27.182 - 00:29:08.942, Speaker D: We've been allocating into hedge funds for a long time. We went through the 2008 crisis, and we see all the mistakes that traditional hedge funds have made as well. But this is also why it is really important for allocators and us as well, to invest during bear markets. Because during bear markets, you have the time to essentially restructure the operational setup. And it's a win win because we're able to de risk our investment for our investors. But at the same time, we can prepare those funds to receive institutional investors later on. And this is exactly what happened in 2018 2019.
00:29:08.942 - 00:29:34.950, Speaker D: This is exactly what happened in 2022. And after FTX, we were very aggressive and mostly focusing on operations. So operations is really key. And any tiny optimization on the operational side, which has happened, and they are real life examples from managers that have an edge on the investment side, have led to disastrous results.
00:29:35.290 - 00:29:41.154, Speaker C: So maybe take me into not the operational side, but the skillset. What are you looking for in the skillset of a liquid person?
00:29:41.282 - 00:30:23.352, Speaker D: Okay, so the skill set of liquid person, I think in 2018, back then, your tratfi brain would automatically say, hey, it's liquid. You need a trader, and you need to be active to suppress that volatility. And initially, that's how I started thinking about the space, and it was a big mistake, because everyone tries to do that. All they want to do in crypto is how do we come up with products that actually suppress that volatility? So one way to do it is to launch liquid market neutral funder funds, which is a big mistake, and we never did that. But within our portfolio, initially, we had a market neutral stock.
00:30:23.416 - 00:30:26.100, Speaker C: Why is a market neutral crypto fund such a big mistake?
00:30:26.600 - 00:30:42.232, Speaker D: Because one, from a business perspective, promising an investor a straight line in crypto, for some reason has no appetite. Investors don't have any appetite for that. They're not interested. They're not interested in 15 or 20%.
00:30:42.376 - 00:30:43.248, Speaker B: You can do that in the public.
00:30:43.304 - 00:30:47.100, Speaker C: Markets, or you're investing in crypto. To get outsized returns. It's not.
00:30:47.760 - 00:31:10.586, Speaker D: Absolutely. Absolutely. And in addition to that, if you look through, I mean, you're. I mean, there's no, you know, at the end of the day, what you're underwriting most of the time is counterparty and smart contract risk. And, you know, if you would have been heavy in market neutral, November 2022 would have been bad for you. Essentially, that's why you're underwriting. So there's that.
00:31:10.586 - 00:31:34.538, Speaker D: You're in crypto for the positive asymmetry. You're not in crypto for a capture, for being short volume, essentially in the form of counterparty risk. So it's not really interesting. And those models didn't take off, by the way, so they didn't gather much aum. And, you know, that's probably a good thing. But the other approach that suppresses volatility is on the venture side. Again, either I do equity or I do stuff that are private.
00:31:34.538 - 00:32:06.046, Speaker D: That way, I don't show that volatility in the nav, and that's attractive for investors, but I substitute that for liquidity. So I give up the liquidity for less volatility. Essentially. That's the idea. Now, when you look at crypto, and I think we learned that lesson together, Tushar and I would say, if I'm allowed to say, and Tushar, correct me if I'm wrong, but we learned that lesson. March 2020, I still remember it was 03:00 a.m. in Zurich.
00:32:06.046 - 00:32:49.820, Speaker D: I was chatting with Tushar. And those are moments that are on the 12 march, if I'm not mistaken. Those are moments that I will never forget. But essentially, the lesson was that the best risk reward in crypto is because a third way to suppress that volatility is to be a fundamental measure in crypto, but more active in your trading. So you take your net from zero to 100, and you try to suppress that volatility again. March 2020 showed that those strategies don't work because human beings are unable to deal with the volatility of crypto, and they burn out and they start doing stupid things. Right, and you're incentivized to use leverage to catch up, and you end up blowing up.
00:32:49.820 - 00:33:29.358, Speaker D: So the lesson was, the key in crypto is you expose yourself to fundamental measures. You don't want a trader. You want to underwrite idiosyncratic risk and market risk. And once you accept that, that the catch is to absorb the volatility, to underwrite that volatility, then you're able to invest on a horizon of five to ten years, and you do extremely well. So we've learned that lesson. We've moved away from the more active you are, the more risk you incorporate in your portfolio in the form of you're on exchanges more often. You're underwriting smart contract risk, etcetera.
00:33:29.358 - 00:33:47.870, Speaker D: You're underwriting the fact that you're going to be chopped up. You can't pick bottoms or tops. It doesn't work that way. It's impossible. And so it's ironic, but you de risk your strategy by having a more static portfolio that is longer term, if that makes sense.
00:33:48.210 - 00:34:29.159, Speaker A: Yeah, I want to chime in here. I agree with all of that. I have a core investing belief that I think encapsulates a lot of this, which is you should invest based on strength, not lack of weakness. And I think too many investors think about looking for an all rounded manager that can do well at all of these different things. And I think that is exactly the wrong strategy. I don't think you're looking for a manager, a firm that has the ability to pick fundamentals, also trade data, also do market neutral strategy. You're not going to see all of those things in a single manager.
00:34:29.159 - 00:34:59.616, Speaker A: That's not possible. Really, I haven't ever seen it. I think the key is invest based on strength, not lack of weakness. Then when you apply that philosophy to crypto markets specifically, what you realize is a lot of the desire for managers to suppress that volatility and try and trade beta. They're like, oh, the market's up a lot, maybe I should trim and take my net exposure down to 75. Oh, market's down. Like I'll add.
00:34:59.616 - 00:36:10.350, Speaker A: Right? Like a lot of that is them trying to focus on the lack of weakness because they want to show their lp's that, oh, we don't get huge drawdowns, but what they miss is they miss the big upside. And then what happens is they get whipsawed. And by whipsaw I mean they sell at price x because they think it's pretty high, but then the market goes up to three x or four x and they're like, well, I missed out and my lp's are going to be upset with me. And then they buy in with leverage at three four x and then the market sells off. Right? Like that is the Max Payne scenario for a manager who is actively trying to trade. So that's why I think, especially in a market like crypto, the idea of trying to discretionarily or systematically control your exposure to beta is not the right strategy for a liquid manager. And I think the focus needs to be on your strength, which should be fundamental analysis and trying to predict the future of how these assets will evolve or how these markets will evolve.
00:36:10.350 - 00:36:29.010, Speaker A: Not trying to play the game of market psychology, because that game is, it is an inherently chaotic game that does not repeat. There are not really patterns. You can't draw a bunch of lines and triangles on charts and outperform encrypt.
00:36:29.050 - 00:36:33.546, Speaker C: Look at the Fibonacci numbers on the token. Yeah, yeah.
00:36:33.578 - 00:36:39.578, Speaker A: Humans are pattern seeking machines, right? So humans love to look for these types of resistance.
00:36:39.634 - 00:36:40.570, Speaker C: Why is it not?
00:36:40.690 - 00:37:23.970, Speaker A: Yeah, but like, that's, that's just not how these markets work. They're inherently chaotic. It's almost like macro, right? With macro, it's so self referential that it becomes impossible to predict, right. Because everyone in the world thinks that rates are going to go down six months from now. Well, that changes the behavior now such that belief itself is stimulatory. And then that reduces the probability that rates go down six months from now, for example. Now I'm not a macro guy, but just to draw that comparison, like, there are these capital market systems that are inherently chaotic and you can't go and bring a pattern matching approach to an inherently chaotic system.
00:37:26.190 - 00:38:01.210, Speaker D: So if you actually accept that philosophy and embrace it, the irony is that a result, you know, being exposed to a static manager fundamental that is liquid in 2022, while very painful -85% for that measure, is the risk that you underwrote. So it's within the boundaries of that risk. So you're in a position where you know that it could happen, but you're in a much stronger position. Where you can add to that measure is if fundamentals around crypto have did not change materially. Does that make sense?

00:41:18.760 - 00:41:50.358, Speaker C: In traditional venture and liquid. There's a line in the sand where venture stops and liquid starts, right? And it's the, it's usually the IPO window. So you invest in Twitter early in a private company, no matter how much you love that company, you. You should, and oftentimes do sell it when it goes public. No matter if your best friends with the CEO and you love them, whatever, and you're still bullish, oftentimes you sell it. Now, there was some weird stuff in 2021 with sequoia and the funds lasting forever, as they said. But it seems like that experiment didn't really work out.
00:41:50.358 - 00:42:22.276, Speaker C: In crypto. There's not the line in the sand. So I'm curious how you guys think about where liquid starts and where venture ends. And maybe I'll actually use one example to think about this question. So if you're liquidity, your liquid fund manager, you want to go long a token, you could just buy it in the open markets. That's maybe what a normal fund would do in capital markets is they would just buy the stock. But in crypto, you could actually buy that token from treasury, for example, and you could get it.
00:42:22.276 - 00:42:46.598, Speaker C: Maybe there's a six month lockup. And you're like, six months? That's not really that long. And I get a 50% discount on it. Is that venture or is that liquid? Or in liquid, you're like, I think that I'm going to make up a token here. Bear chain. I think that bear chain is going to launch their token in October, and they're doing this private round right now, and it's July. I'm making these things up.
00:42:46.598 - 00:43:02.780, Speaker C: I don't know anything about bear chain. And I could get it at what I think is going to be a big discount to the liquid market. Is that vent? But I'm expecting it to go to be quote unquote public in three months. Is that venture, is that liquid? So how do you guys think about that? Like, that line in the sand?
00:43:04.040 - 00:43:59.362, Speaker A: I can go first and hand it over to Ray. I would say one thing is looking at discounts to market prices, I think is a completely irrational way to be making investing decisions. You need to be underwriting from the bottom up of, what do I think this thing is worth? I actually think it's laughable. We see all these deals come by, they're like, oh, it's a four year lockup, linear lockup with a 40% discount, or a two year lockup with a 30% discount. Like, this is a hundred volume asset, right? How can you justify being locked up for two or four years on 100 volume asset with that much of a discount? It just mathematically does nothing make sense. So I think you have to take that framework of, oh, the market price is x, and I'm getting offered from the treasury at 0.6 x.
00:43:59.362 - 00:45:01.100, Speaker A: You need to throw it out the window. That is an absolutely horrible framework to use. And I think the right framework is, how much is this worth? In my mind? What do I think this could be? Then figure out what is the best way for me to get exposure to it. And if the best way happens to be I should go and try and negotiate a deal with the treasury or the foundation in order to get that exposure, then great. Or if the best way is I want to go buy it on liquid public markets, because liquidity is there, and actually, I dont want to lock up, because I think the market might come to price this asset appropriately before the lockup actually hits, then go do that. But I think, I think it's putting the cart before the horse when people say, oh, I'm looking at the discount, and like, this is what blew up three ac really famously, is that they were like, oh, we're doing this Arb, where we're buying at a 40% discount with a lockup. And that's an orb, it's like, no, that's not an Arb.
00:45:01.100 - 00:45:08.180, Speaker A: That's not what an ARb is. So, yeah, I just fundamentally absolutely hate that framework.
00:45:09.170 - 00:46:02.960, Speaker D: Yeah, I agree with Tushar, and that the liquid fund should set that valuation, and that's based on the fact that investor segmentation exists in all markets. If you think about credit markets, you've got investment grade, high yield, distressed, and then you've got your emergence from distress post Reorg equity. You've got at least four to five type of investors that have underwrite different risks, have different skill sets. When a bond goes from investment grade to high yield, it's the high yield measure. Who's going to dictate what the spread is going to be on that bond? Not the investment grade that gives a discount. It doesn't work that way. I think what we should see going forward is a much more powerful liquid crypto fund industry that essentially dictates the pricing of tokens at launch.
00:46:02.960 - 00:46:21.300, Speaker D: Where, you know, today things are priced by maybe market makers and founders, they should be priced by, what is that liquid crypto manager, at what price is he willing to hold that token for the next two to three years, if that's their investment horizon?
00:46:25.240 - 00:46:42.060, Speaker C: Ray, switching gears a little bit, how important is it to get GPD? Can you explain GP versus LP shares in a fund and how important it is to get GP shares? I don't even know if the right word is shares or stake. Can you just explain that dynamic.
00:46:43.800 - 00:46:45.456, Speaker D: For an allocator like us?
00:46:45.568 - 00:46:58.300, Speaker C: Yeah, if you're an allocator and a new fund comes to market, oftentimes I think an allocator, if they have enough size, will say, hey, I actually want a GP stake, not just a normal LP stake. Can you explain that? Because I think that's something most folks who haven't been in the room don't actually understand.
00:46:59.040 - 00:47:51.140, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, if you have a large allocator that comes in, they're the biggest check and they've got enough power because the manager is unable to raise enough money, they'll negotiate a GP stake. And we saw that happen in 2023. On the VC side, they're negotiating makes sense. They're working for their investors. But the problem is that you've got massive conflicts that can take place in those situations. If you're able to, you need to place that LP stake and that GP stake within the same structure for your investor, or else you create massive conflicts of interest. And that's not easy because the investment horizon of a GP stake versus an LP stake, especially if it's a liquid fund, those are very different risks that you're underwriting.
00:47:51.140 - 00:48:11.490, Speaker D: I know that a lot of people do that in crypto. We don't do that. We might do it with one manager where we'll put them in the same vehicle. And the reason why we haven't done it in the past is simply it creates a lot of conflicts. And since we're serving pension funds, we don't even want to get close to those deals.
00:48:13.030 - 00:48:43.300, Speaker C: Got it. Got it. Tusharwanah, change gears a little bit. And it's a related topic, but I think it's relevant to this conversation, maybe. Can you say some things about the current token launch meta? It feels like things are shifting in the narrative in the meta and the zeitgeist around launching tokens and points and airdrops and all of that stuff specifically. I'd love to hear your thoughts on that, but also the effect that that will have on venture and liquid investing.
00:48:44.040 - 00:49:54.946, Speaker A: Yeah, I want to go back to what we were talking about before the GP question, because I think it actually ties together really well. Let's look at how companies go public in traditional financial markets. You have a underwriting process that happens. You have some shares that are being sold to institutional investors, and you have a banker go out and build a book and say, this is where I think these shares should be priced. Now there's some error in that process, and we can get into nuances of why IPO pops are a good or bad thing and all this stuff, but that, I think, is still a better process than we have in crypto today. And I think the reason that we don't imitate a similar process is because of regulatory icos actually led to better price discovery in liquid crypto markets than the current token launch process does. Because the current token launch process has this low float, high FTV kind of characteristic that I think is really problematic.
00:49:54.946 - 00:50:40.450, Speaker A: And you're not allowed to go out and market the token launch in the same way that an IPO is marketed. So you're not allowed to give the information needed for investors to be able to decide how much is this thing worth? What should I be willing to pay for this? And so a lot of investors are resorting to really amateur levels of analysis of, oh, let me just compare to a comparable project and let's look at that. Or let me look at the last venture round and then value it based off that. Which, by the way, like, never do that. Like that. That's a truly a horrible way to look at it. That's like kind of pricing off a discount.
00:50:40.450 - 00:51:35.866, Speaker A: Like the price that someone else paid for the thing should not change how much you think the thing is worth. That's a really bad way to look at the world. So I think what happens is that with public companies, when they go IPO, you see some price discovery happen before any shares trade. And that's what you used to see with icos in crypto as well. But since icos have fallen out of favor, now we only see price discovery after the token launches. And that is a huge difference, because sometimes people have this idea of, I want to launch at a high valuation because it's going to give me some more ammunition to be able to use for recruiting for partnerships. It'll give me some more legitimacy in the market.
00:51:35.866 - 00:52:22.410, Speaker A: It will deliver all these intangible benefits. But what happens is price discovery is going to occur. One thing I can guarantee you is that over the longer term, the markets do find price discovery and they do bend towards rationality. This is the fundamental law of capitalism. And what happens is if you launch at a really high price because you're looking for those intangible benefits, then as price discovery occurs, and it turns out actually the valuation should be much lower. Well, now everyone who believed in you in the public markets early on has lost money, and now you've hurt the community. You don't have the sense of positivity around your project.
00:52:22.410 - 00:53:19.370, Speaker A: People aren't as excited, and I think that that creates a lot of longer term problems. So to bring that rant back to your question of, like, what is the current token launch meta? I think the meta for token launches is changing right now. The meta, as it's been for the past six, nine months or so, has been. You give users some points in exchange for doing some actions that you want in the protocol. Then you airdrop tokens to those people that have points using some allocation mechanism, usually nonlinear. So you're rewarding smaller accounts more than their pro rata share, and you're awarding larger accounts less than their pro rata share. And then you hope that those airdrop recipients help you achieve price discovery faster than if you didn't do a large airdrop.
00:53:19.370 - 00:54:04.364, Speaker A: That's the current meta. But like anything in crypto, if it works for a little while, people figure out how to farm it or gain it. And now we have just the airdrop farmers that are going out there using everything. And when they use these protocols, they're farming the tokens in order to immediately sell regardless of the price at launch. So they're not actually assisting the price discovery process, they're just selling the tokens indiscriminately because they're just farming to do that. And it's easy for a founder or a team to lie to themselves and say, man, my KPI's are going up. Look how many active addresses are interacting with my protocol.
00:54:04.364 - 00:54:20.664, Speaker A: Look at how all this stuff is happening. This is fantastic. This is real growth. And they'll lie to themselves, and it's easiest to lie to yourself. It's easier to lie to yourself than to anyone else. And they'll say, everything's going great, but those are just airdrop farmers. That should not count.
00:54:20.664 - 00:54:53.820, Speaker A: And then they're going to instantump the token once it launches. It doesn't help with price discovery, and the market is coming to that realization. Now, I think you saw the really interesting anti civil airdrop farming tactics at layer zero put in, and I think that kind of was one of the shifting points on the meta, because they realized the negative effects of airdrop farming and they wanted to mitigate that. And so I think that's changing how token launches will happen moving forward.
00:54:55.640 - 00:55:06.460, Speaker C: Maybe play it out a little more. What do you think the next six to twelve months looks like for when you, when you say it'll change how token tokens are released in airdrops moving forward, what does that look like?
00:55:07.120 - 00:56:27.830, Speaker A: I don't think we're going to see as many founders or teams able to basically do the same easily Sibyl farming, airdrop mechanisms, I think the market is going to delegitimize that and say, I know that that's not real, and once the market knows that that's not real, then you don't get credit for it anymore, and that is going to change the mechanisms. I think hopefully, what we will see is some better mechanisms for price discovery before the token starts trading. Something that we've thought a lot about is things like using bonding curves to launch a token, or using other mechanisms in order to achieve price discovery before the token is ever transferable and tradable. And I hope to see more experimentation there. I think that for now, we're going to see a lot of that experimentation from offshore founders. But if we see a change in regulatory administration, then I think we can see some more of that experimentation and innovation in the US and globally, because I think that'll lead to more efficient capital markets.
00:56:28.450 - 00:56:56.160, Speaker C: Tushar, there was a podcast that you did on Empire, maybe like two years ago, where you talked about evolutions, and every cycle is dominated by a new evolution in fundraising. I'm going to botch this a little bit, I'm sure, but icos and nfts, these were just new evolutions of raising capital. Would you say the new evolution in this cycle is meme coins, or we haven't seen it yet, or how do you think about that? I don't know if you think that thesis still holds true.
00:56:56.780 - 00:57:39.326, Speaker A: I do still hold that thesis. So, to restate the thesis, if you look back at the history of crypto, every bull market was sparked off by a new method of token distribution, because new methods of token distribution bring in new sets of users with new activities. So if you look at the 2013 kind of bull market, that was proof of work, coin forks, because people were like, oh, this bitcoin thing really works. That's when, like Litecoin and some of this other stuff came into existence. Then you saw icos in 17. In 2019, you had a mini bull market from ieos, which were icos, but slightly different. Then you saw DeFi liquidity mining in 2020, 2021, you saw nfts.
00:57:39.326 - 00:58:19.930, Speaker A: And yes, I do think that meme coins are playing a big part in that role in this cycle. And the reason for that is it's getting engagement with a new set of users who want to go do things on chain. That's the key unlock is getting distribution of tokens to a new set of users. Now, is this going to be as powerful as Defi liquidity mining or some of these other catalysts. Hard to say. These meme coins are inherently memes. There's no cash flow or anything to go and point to.
00:58:19.930 - 00:58:52.826, Speaker A: They're fun. And I think retail investors really like meme coins because there is no alpha to be had. So the sophisticated investors can't make more money than you or take your money, because it isn't about being smart or sophisticated. Like, that's not the game. So I think that's interesting and different. But I am looking forward to the new token distribution mechanism that delivers fundamental value, which I continue to think for this cycle. The next one is going to be DPN.
00:58:52.826 - 00:59:39.650, Speaker A: I think Deepin is going to be one of the major token distribution mechanisms that incentivizes people to do actually useful work and then delivers a method of capital formation to deliver something that wasn't previously possible. I don't think that Deepin has really broken into that mainstream crypto market consciousness just yet. You see a lot of people talking about it, but you see less participation in it than you do in even something like meme coins. So that's what I'm looking forward to, because at the end of the day, I'm here for fundamentals and I'm here for building technology that builds products that are useful. And meme coins can be fun, but they're not really useful. And, like, that's what I'm more excited about.
00:59:40.550 - 01:00:15.660, Speaker C: Ray, how do you think about maybe we can play off of deepen for a second? It got me thinking about something else. How do you think about ecosystem funds that are very focused around one sector and. Or, like, an ecosystem? So, like, when I think deepin, I think like, oh, man, what's the EV three escape velocity guys? Like, they're fund, like, very. I might botch this in too short. Maybe you can correct me, because I think you guys might be investors in them, but they dominate the deep end space. If there's a deep end deal, they know about it. They know every deep end founder.
01:00:15.660 - 01:00:23.250, Speaker C: Ray, from an allocation perspective, how do you think about investing in funds that have a very specific focus like that?
01:00:25.070 - 01:01:25.620, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, it can be really, really interesting if the top down is really attractive. So we wouldn't apply it as a given that managers, because the universe of crypto has expanded so much that we need to invest in specialized managers. I don't think that makes sense. But if, and, you know, we looked at EV three really, really closely, and this is a great team and a very, very good example, I would say that they would be an exception. And so I would say out of maybe 30 fund investments since our lifetime, or 35, there might be one or two exceptions. So it really depends on the top down of that specific sector. You know, how attractive it is from an asymmetry perspective, from a, the ability to actually generate alpha on the liquid side or the fact that it's really, really non consensus on the venture side.
01:01:27.360 - 01:02:27.470, Speaker A: If I can chime in on that, I would say as a general principle, whether it's liquid managers or venture or I think actually in any form of investing whatsoever, in any market whatsoever, you never want to be a forced trader. You don't want to be forced to buy something and you don't want to be forced to sell something. And when you specialize, you could be forced to go and buy something because you are focused on this specific sector and you can't afford to miss a deal in that sector. And then that deal becomes a deal and then your lp's are just, they're never going to want to talk to you again. Right. So you are effectively forced to trade, right. You might do deals that you wouldn't otherwise do if you were not typecast as, you know, this specific sector.
01:02:27.470 - 01:02:56.300, Speaker A: So one thing that at least I think is very important is as a manager, do not be pigeonholed into anything because when you are pigeonholed then you might be forced to trade, right. And in venture that usually means being forced to buy something that you may not otherwise want to buy because of valuation or fundamentals or some other reason, but you are forced to do it. And fundamentally, I think just like you never want to be forced to trade.
01:02:56.460 - 01:03:27.794, Speaker C: Yeah, it feels like the tricky thing comes when you're fundraising, right. Because just talking to other fund managers who are raising, if you go out to the market and you say, im raising $400 million or 500 million for a crypto fund, the LP's are going to say, well, what makes you different? You say, ah, I am a gaming fund, im a deepen fund, right? Im a consumer fund. And they say, oh thats great. Okay, cool. That makes a lot of sense. Were going to invest in you now because youve like carved out this niche for yourself. But then I think, yeah, I think youre spot on Tushar.
01:03:27.794 - 01:03:39.604, Speaker C: Like things change so quickly. You become a force buyer. There's like external pressure and internal pressure to do things that you, if it was a fully free market, you would not do.
01:03:39.692 - 01:04:03.860, Speaker A: So, yeah, if you're a really good manager, you should not be making decisions about what to do based on what LP's will give you money to do that is not a good way to make decisions. LP's are hiring you to make those decisions. So if you're outsourcing that decision making to the LP, I think that's nonsensical. Ray, if you'd like to add anything.
01:04:03.900 - 01:04:30.580, Speaker D: No, I just wanted to say that even outside of crypto, I mean, the biggest driver of performance is being unconstrained. So even if you look at hedge funds out there, the most sustainable drivers of returns were typically the macro funds because they had the freedom to go where the premier is. Right. And I think that's it's the easiest way to perform sustainably over the long run.
01:04:32.120 - 01:04:54.580, Speaker C: So I sent this tweet and I want you guys to tear it apart. It became a bit of a meme format. I said, someone will make a lot of money building a Monad fund. Brand is a Monad only fund. Raise 5 million, put 100k into the top 50 monad deals as early as possible. Run back the frictionless capital playbook. But for Monad instead of Solana, you want to tear that apart? Tushar.
01:04:56.600 - 01:05:10.648, Speaker A: I feel like I might have already torn that apart with my last answer. The problem is now you're a force buyer of every deal, and you're going to end up investing in a bunch of copycat projects just because you're like, I need to do every deal.
01:05:10.704 - 01:05:12.152, Speaker C: You need to do the Monad deals.
01:05:12.216 - 01:05:37.982, Speaker A: Yeah, I need to do every deal. And you should just never feel like you need to do anything. I think that leads to poor returns. Look, maybe that strategy works and, like, one of those things ends up being a big winner. Right? Like, I can't say that it won't perform, but I can say that, you know, without having the benefit of hindsight, I just never want to be forced to do a deal that I otherwise wouldn't want to do.
01:05:38.126 - 01:05:54.546, Speaker C: Yeah. Just thinking about the liquid conversation from the beginning of this episode, I have a few questions about it that have just come into my mind throughout this conversation. When you. So, Tushar, you guys have a. You guys have a venture fund and a liquid fund, right?
01:05:54.698 - 01:05:55.362, Speaker A: Correct.
01:05:55.506 - 01:06:17.766, Speaker C: Okay, so maybe I can pick on you for this question. And, Ray, I'd love to get your thoughts, too. The biggest, like, in the traditional capital markets, public markets, the. If you think that the market is. There's. There's no, like, crypto works on these four year cycles and it. And it always has worked on these four year cycles, and maybe that'll go away one day, but for right now, I think the assumption is still, like, it's working on these cycles.
01:06:17.766 - 01:06:39.878, Speaker C: The biggest driver of returns has not been picking tokens actually. It's just been actually timing cycles, I would call it. I see Ray shaking my head. So maybe, Ray, I'll pick on you first. I guess you're right. If you picked the privacy coins, you were never making money. But if you pick some of the l one s in 2021, you were making all of the money.
01:06:39.878 - 01:07:17.950, Speaker C: So I think that's right. But also, if you could time, you have two people who buy Solana. The person who times the top buys the bottom, I guess that's obvious, is going to make more money. But how do you think about a liquid fund manager going to their basically saying, I'm selling, I'm moving all to cash, I'm not shorting because I'm not shorting in crypto, because that's a scary thing to do. I'm moving to cash, and the LP's are like, but I'm paying you 2% and you're 95% in cash, and you're going to get back into the market when? Oh, you're getting back into the market in a year from now. So I'm paying you 2% to get back into the. To just sit on cash for a whole year.
01:07:17.950 - 01:07:31.730, Speaker C: There's like, speaking of, like, LP pressure, there's this LP pressure to be in the market even when you maybe shouldn't be in the market. So, winding question there. Bit long winded, but how do you, how do you guys think about that dynamic?
01:07:32.710 - 01:08:13.440, Speaker D: Shall I give it a shot? First? So, just looking at history, so since 2018, I think on the liquid side, we invested. Invested in 25 funds from, you know, across that time, and there's only two funds that outperformed everyone. And the divergence in performance is enormous. I mean, we're talking about funds being up on the liquid side, 15 x plus versus, you know, multiples that are, versus, you know, managers that lost everything. And so the divergence is enormous. And that divergence comes from idiosyncratic risk, actual selection. Funnily enough, those two funds are very static in their exposure.
01:08:13.440 - 01:08:50.970, Speaker D: They don't go to cash. That's not their job. Their job is to stay exposed. But they were able to outperform because they had the right projects during that period of time and massive outperformance. And the way, just based on what we said before and the lessons that we've learned is that, yes, an investor through an open ended structure can go to cash themselves. That's the beauty of liquidity. So why should you, as an investor, give up your liquidity to a closed ended structure that, by the way, is doing a lot of liquids anyway? You can take charge of that liquidity and decide when you reduce your position.
01:08:50.970 - 01:09:45.726, Speaker D: And I give you a real example about this. So we have the first us pension fund that came in, put a first tranche in Q 420, 19, a second tranche on the 1 April of 2020. And, you know, a swiss pension fund puts their crypto exposure in the alternative bucket, which is capped at 15%. The alternative bucket, you have pe vc that are illiquid on the tradfi side, and they were lucky enough to put in liquid crypto with us in their alternative bucket. Now, if you put 75 basis points in crypto and you're up ten x by the end of 2021, or a large multiple, you're blowing up through that 15%, captain, where if you reach that cap, you need to talk to the regulator. So liquidity is really important. So that pension fund was able to de risk at the end of 2021 and double down again in 2023.
01:09:45.726 - 01:10:20.460, Speaker D: And that's the beauty of open ended, or being, or possessing the liquidity to act yourself. So I would, today, I would rather have a fund that is fully allocated, or at least those are our core positions within our book, by the way. We have managers that are more active, but our two largest positions are always fully allocated and, you know, generating alpha through picking, which has shown to be much more meaningful and I think will be more meaningful in the future. And we can de risk if we want to and whenever we want to.
01:10:22.840 - 01:10:43.524, Speaker A: Yeah, look, trading beta is just extraordinarily difficult. I have not met a single person who can trade beta in crypto. Well, because, you know, it's easier to say in hindsight. Oh, crypto works on four year cycles. Just buy the bottoms and sell the tops. Right, fantastic. But if you let me trade in hindsight, I'd be the world's first trillionaire.
01:10:43.524 - 01:11:18.868, Speaker A: Right? Like that. That's just not how it works. And the difficulty is managing your own psychology in that process. To go off on a bit of a tangent, I think there are four sources of edge that exist in investing. The first is your information or access edge. Do people pick up the phone when you call? Do people call you with deals? That kind of thing? The second is analytical edge. How smart are you? Are you able to understand what you're doing? The third, and this is the one that I think is relevant to this question, is psychological or behavioral edge.
01:11:18.868 - 01:11:50.648, Speaker A: How do you manage your emotions because when the market, when you sell at, you know, in the middle of 2021, let's say, you know, July, August period, because you think, oh, this market's pretty overheated, like, I want out. But then you see the market rip up through the rest of the year and everyone's saying like, hey, why are you missing out on all these returns? How do you manage that Fomo? How do you manage that emotion? And actually what happens with a lot of managers is they go buy in again at a higher price.
01:11:50.744 - 01:11:54.344, Speaker C: Stanley Druckenmiller, Tech Bubble 2000 like, I.
01:11:54.352 - 01:12:42.410, Speaker A: Mean, he's the greatest of all time, absolutely legendary investor, and even he is prone to this same category error. So to anyone who thinks that, like, oh, I'm going to be able to trade beta, it's like, well, even, you know, someone like druck, who is this legend, like, has had failures on this specific scenario that I'm describing. So that psychological edge is so, so hard to manage. Also, when the market's at a bottom, there's very few investors who are able to hold their nose and buy the bottom, right? Like that's just, that's an extraordinarily difficult thing to do because you think the world is ending, right? Like, oh my God, everything's going to be over, or maybe I'll get to buy in cheaper, right? Like, so like $8 at the end of 2022. People were like, oh, I'll buy it when it's four. All right, like that. That's what people, some people were thinking.
01:12:42.410 - 01:13:11.050, Speaker A: And it's like, well, you know, like, it's just, you can't time this stuff. And just for the sake of completeness, I'll say the fourth edge in investing is structural, right? If you have the ability to do things that other people can't do in your mandate. This kind of fits into the question earlier about being pigeonholed into a specific sector. I think having flexibility is a big structural edge in order to give you optionality to outperform.
01:13:15.150 - 01:13:37.926, Speaker C: Let's talk about consumer for a second. We talked about token zeitgeist ending and airdrops and things like that. Not ending, but narrative shifting. The other thing that feels like it's happening is infrastructure fatigue. Re excitement about apps. The problem with applications, I would say, has not actually been around. People don't want to use them.
01:13:37.926 - 01:14:05.060, Speaker C: It's that people don't want to fund them. There's been too much money to be made in infrastructure in l one s and l two s. There is zero incentive to invest in consumer. One idea I have is if things start going public, they start doing their tokens and it's actually priced below the valuation of the last private round. That's the incentive that will maybe drive a new wave of consumer investments. I'd be curious how you two think about that.
01:14:09.450 - 01:14:51.090, Speaker A: I can go first on this. I do think that there is infrastructure fatigue. I think that is specifically driven by just the incredible complexity of the modular stack, as opposed to the simplicity and elegance of the integrated stack. I think they both accomplish similar outcomes. They want the same endgame. It's just the modular stack has many more tokens involved and many more moving pieces involved in order to accomplish the same endgame. And it's really hard, if you're a retail investor, to go and understand what is an inter subjective work token.
01:14:51.090 - 01:15:39.786, Speaker A: What do those string of words together even mean? There's maybe 50 people on this planet who actually understand that. So I think what you're seeing is fatigue. On that side, you're seeing the emergence of meme coins, which distracts attention away from a lot of these infrastructure tokens. And at the end of the day, we live in an attention economy and everything is driven by attention. So I think you're seeing less interest in infrastructure for sure. But at the same time, on the consumer side, I don't think the lack of consumer products is due to a lack of investor interest. I can tell you multicoin is absolutely interested in investing in consumer facing products or applications.
01:15:39.786 - 01:16:16.810, Speaker A: And we are not alone. There are a number of other large, sophisticated smart investors that we respect who are interested in funding that stuff. Really what we need are more fundamental theses on what consumer products make sense for this industry. I think everyone already understands DeFi, but in my opinion, DeFi is a second horizon thing. You don't use Defi. The ordinary person isn't going to just start using DeFi out of nowhere. They need to get a wallet with some funded assets first, somehow.
01:16:16.810 - 01:16:56.622, Speaker A: Ideally, it's through some consumer application that gives them tokens that they do not have to buy, and then they'll use DeFi as a second horizon thing. I think payments is very similar. The thesis for payments is really clearly to anyone who understands anything about how payments works. This is the future of payments. Blockchains are the future of payments. If you fast forward 30, 40, 50 years to pick a long, long time frame, I would bet you any amount of money that almost all payments are done over blockchains in that period. But that doesn't.
01:16:56.622 - 01:17:38.060, Speaker A: I don't think that starts with payments. I think you have to get something else first. And so that's something that we're really focused on. And I think it's likely going to be deep in that gives people tokens or it's going to be something similar to that. Maybe it's gaming, it's something else where I as a consumer can interact with an application and get tokens without having to put in my credit card information. And now I'm in the on chain economy and I can go do a bunch of other stuff. But right now I only have two ideas for what that can be, and that's gaming, or deep in are the only two things.
01:17:38.060 - 01:17:50.560, Speaker A: Going back to my first sentence, answering this question, it's about a fundamental thesis that investors need in order to be able to justify investing in consumer.
01:17:51.620 - 01:18:28.550, Speaker D: If you think about all the fundamentals that Tushar elaborated on, and you look at the intersection of what is really non consensus, I would say gaming is interesting today because obviously a lot of competition on the infra side. Gaming had a lot of attention a year and a half, two years ago, and today it's becoming, it is non consensus. It's interesting. And so those are areas that overlap with some of Tushar's thoughts that are non consensus and could be very attractive in terms of building positions for a portfolio.
01:18:31.120 - 01:19:15.500, Speaker C: All right, I have three topics left I want to ask here. One is this dreaded question of where are we in the cycle? But I would be curious how you almost just, I'm not asking like, hey, we're 70% of the way done with the cycle. It's more around just having conversations with folks on the podcast. It feels like there's a general consensus that, hey, we're kind of choppiness and too much market uncertainty. So we're going to chop and consolidate until maybe the fall and probably October, and then we've got interest rate stuff happening in the election. So more certainty gets baked into the market as we know who gets elected in November. And then Biden gets elected, number goes down, Trump gets elected, number goes up.
01:19:15.500 - 01:19:40.736, Speaker C: Let's say Trump gets elected, number goes up. We have a good bull market for a year and then cycle over. That feels like what 85% of people say on this podcast. I'd be curious how you two think about both. Just how you think about thinking about the cycle, and specifically, if you think that, if you would agree with that consensus, bet, maybe I start with big.
01:19:40.768 - 01:20:31.886, Speaker D: Picture so very quickly. So you've mentioned many things, many variables that are impossible to predict. So I would say that, you know, we're, the way we're thinking about it is, so it's going to be very difficult to know where you're in the cycle. All we know is today the liquid side is very attractive and still highly investable. And so we're, you know, frankly, we're active on both, both the liquid side with funds and the VC side on the direct side and with funds as well. I can tell you that during, after FTX, we've deployed maybe five x the amount, six x the amounts that we've deployed, we've deployed in liquid funds versus venture funds. So that's a reflection of our view towards our bullishness on the liquid side.
01:20:31.886 - 01:20:58.120, Speaker D: And we believe that that structural imbalance that we described at the beginning, which is going to take years to play out, is the only, is one of the things that you can, has a high probability of taking place and that's how we're positioning ourselves. So I would say active management on the liquid side is very, very interesting. And that's where it stops essentially.
01:21:00.700 - 01:21:26.174, Speaker A: Yeah. Like I said, it's basically impossible to go and trade beta. The problem is it's self referential. All the things you said are true. This is what the market believes. But what that means is that's what is built into expectations and that's what's priced in today. People are pricing in their expectations of what rate cuts or what election results or any of this stuff looks like.
01:21:26.174 - 01:21:48.588, Speaker A: And that's all baked in right now. People are thinking about, oh, there's going to be an ETH ETF and there will be inflows from that. Now there's talks about a Solana ETF. We've seen some filings for that, but all of that stuff is in the expectations. And I think that's what makes crypto such a brutally hard market to try and time cycles.
01:21:48.724 - 01:22:10.612, Speaker C: But is it, but is it big enough for that stuff to be baked in? It reminds me of the question of like, is the havening baked in like, and for years and for many, it actually wasn't necessarily baked in. Or like, is the bitcoin ETF baked in? Everyone said it's baked in, it's baked in, but it really wasn't baked in. So I don't know. That'd be my only counter to that.
01:22:10.716 - 01:23:01.840, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm not saying that markets are perfectly efficient. I do not believe that that is the case. However, I do believe that markets are more efficient when it comes to market beta, and I think they're less efficient when it comes to idiosyncratic picking. I think that there's more opportunity in the idiosyncratic picking than there is in timing beta also because the idiosyncratic picking, I think, fits those sources of edge that I was talking about much better. You have the ability to be better than the market either on an access or informational edge or on an analytical edge, or on a behavioral, psychological edge or a structural edge on idiosyncratic picking. And it's very hard to have an edge on beta. You can think I'm really smart.
01:23:01.840 - 01:23:29.230, Speaker A: I can go look at the last three data points and last three market cycles, and the past is going to look like the future, but that rarely, ever, ever happens. And I think just as a manager, you want to focus on an area where you can have edge. I don't want to play the hardest game possible. I want to actually play the easiest game possible. I want to play the game where I know I'm good and not the game where I'm like, well, yeah, this is just really hard.
01:23:29.930 - 01:23:43.836, Speaker D: I mean, the biggest driver of beta is market liquidity, I would argue. And it's very difficult to predict on a month to month basis where liquidity is going to be for the entire market, not only crypto, but we're talking trout fi, etcetera.
01:23:43.988 - 01:24:13.730, Speaker C: Yeah. Tushar related to the election, I saw that Kyle announced, he said today, Multicoin is proud to announce a special contribution to match all donations of Sol to the Sentinel Action fund. Sentinel Action Fund is a conservative super PAC, said, well, match it up to 1 million for sold donations made over the next ten days. Can you tell me your expectations for what happens to crypto?
01:24:14.310 - 01:24:52.050, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. We've been spending more time being engaged on the politics side because as the old saying goes, you may not be interested in politics, but politics is certainly interested in you. I think you have to engage. You can't just hope that good things happen. And I think that the key thing to understand about political engagement is it's about showing the political parties and the political class that you are an important constituency that can help swing key elections. That's what they care about. They speak the language of power.
01:24:52.050 - 01:25:18.552, Speaker A: They don't speak the language of, oh, this is what's right or wrong. Right. Like, I don't think they think about it that way. I think they speak the language of power. And the way to demonstrate that is you want to put money and votes to work. And very critically, you want the politicians to know that you did that. You want them to know that you were as a community.
01:25:18.552 - 01:25:58.880, Speaker A: What helped swing a critical election. Right. Like, I think worst case scenario for crypto politically right now in the United States is, you know, we see progressives, the Elizabeth Warren wing of the Democratic Party, really take a lot of power. I think that's the worst case scenario because they've just shown that they're anti crypto. They inherently don't believe in the property rights that crypto enables. They want the state to control more. But you know what? What else would be not like, a great scenario would actually be that republicans win, but crypto is not given any credit for that win.
01:25:58.880 - 01:26:47.964, Speaker A: And in that case, crypto is not going to be a priority. There's a bunch of other stuff going on in the world. Like, you know, the world's a big, chaotic, crazy place, and if crypto does not show up and say, hey, we are an important constituency, we will not be a priority in a future administration. So the outcome that we think is the best outcome for crypto is we see the conservatives take power in the US, this administration, because they've shown that they are more pro crypto so far, and very critically, they understand that crypto helped make that happen. Look, multicoin looks for asymmetric opportunities. We try to look for the non consensus thing. We do a lot of diligence to try and understand where can we have the most impact.
01:26:47.964 - 01:27:27.104, Speaker A: And we brought that same rigor and process to our political activism and engagement. And the focus that we have is on the Senate because the Senate confirms all regulatory appointees. So that's absolutely critical for us. We want to have pro crypto senators in there when they're making those decisions. And also, we've seen the fit act pass the House, and now the Senate is rewriting their version of it, and then it's going to go to reconciliation. So the Senate is critical for that component as well. So we think the single highest leveraged place to have Crypto's voice show up is in the US Senate.
01:27:27.104 - 01:27:50.410, Speaker A: And we think the single highest leverage way to do that is by donating to these critical swing races in swing states where crypto as a community, with our money and our votes and our voice, can have a real impact. And I think that's how you can chain together the string of events to get to the best possible regulatory outcome for crypto.
01:27:51.190 - 01:28:10.440, Speaker C: Ray, when you are fundraising or when you're speaking with LP's or allocators, do they have, is it fair to say that? They say, look, I'm waiting for the election to invest, and specifically, maybe I'll invest if Trump is elected, and maybe I won't invest if Biden's elected. Or the first is true, but the latter is not true.
01:28:11.540 - 01:28:39.324, Speaker D: No, I would say that the us regulatory question is important, even for Swiss. And just to be clear, we mostly talk to swiss institutions. Very important for swiss institutions. I mean, the US is really important. Those decisions or that progress drives markets, so that's why they care. But it doesn't go down to Biden versus Trump. It's too short term.
01:28:39.324 - 01:29:01.910, Speaker D: They're thinking long term, if there's progress, they're willing to invest. And by the way, they're paying a lot of attention just based on that product, a progress this year. So it's very important, despite the fact that you've had some clarity or clarity, regulatory clarity, in Switzerland, that's not enough. You need the us side to clarify itself as well.
01:29:02.030 - 01:29:23.730, Speaker C: Yeah. Last question before we wrap here is you guys have just several years of fund management experience in crypto. Would love to just leave this with a piece of advice for emerging fund managers. Could be venture, could be liquidity. Would love to. Yeah, we'd love to leave with one piece of advice for these emerging fund managers as they start on their journey.
01:29:30.870 - 01:30:12.952, Speaker D: Okay, so first, you know, I would. My advice is, I think the biggest business opportunity for a NASA manager, and that's if you're able, you've got edge to manage it that way, is launch a liquid fund. From a supply demand perspective, I think it's a great business opportunity. Of course, you need to find an edge and build the right team. And maybe the last advice that I'll give is transparency is key with your investors. You'll be surprised. But we've been through really, really difficult situations with many of our managers.
01:30:12.952 - 01:30:17.220, Speaker D: But the ones there is a very, very high correlation, and we're talking.
01:30:19.080 - 01:30:19.416, Speaker A: A.
01:30:19.448 - 01:30:29.300, Speaker D: Big chunk of our portfolio is in two managers that we've known for a long time. And it's due to transparency. So I think being transparent to your investors is key.
01:30:32.400 - 01:31:16.962, Speaker A: I agree with both of those. I would add on a few things. The first I would say is, if you are an emerging manager, sit down and be really honest with yourself about your source of edge, and then only do things where you really believe that you have an edge. Markets are really good at taking away money from people who go operate where they do not have an edge, because someone else is going to be better than you at that thing and they're going to take your money. So go sit down. I think that, like I said, there are four sources of edge. And just to repeat them, you have analytical, you have information access, you have behavioral or psychological, and then you have structural.
01:31:16.962 - 01:31:51.220, Speaker A: And so go rate all of those and really think long and hard about where your edge is. And then importantly, you have to stick to it. Don't let yourself get strategy drift. Don't let yourself think, oh, you know, I said that I don't have edge trading beta, but like, man, the market really makes me want to trade beta. And then you start doing it and then you see the strategy drift and like that, that is a way to failure. So I think focus on your strength, not your lack of weakness, and focus on where you have edge. And then the second piece of advice I give is call Ray.
01:31:51.220 - 01:32:10.390, Speaker A: He's the best fund to funds investor out there in crypto. I can say that from experience. He's been with us through thick and thin. He's the only investor who doubled down on us in the periods of the worst periods that we had. So, you know, if you can get Ray on in your corner, I think you'll be way better off.
01:32:10.770 - 01:32:13.530, Speaker C: It's really all you can ask for. Kind words, Ray.
01:32:13.610 - 01:32:14.402, Speaker D: Two kind.
01:32:14.586 - 01:32:16.546, Speaker C: Thank you guys for the time. Appreciate it.
01:32:16.618 - 01:32:17.466, Speaker D: Thank you.
