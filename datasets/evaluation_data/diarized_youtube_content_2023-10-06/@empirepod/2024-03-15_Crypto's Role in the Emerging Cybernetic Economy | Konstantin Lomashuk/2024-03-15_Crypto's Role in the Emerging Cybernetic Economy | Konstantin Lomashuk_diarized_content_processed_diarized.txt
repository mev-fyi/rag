00:00:00.240 - 00:00:40.382, Speaker A: If you are an empire listener, hopefully you've played around on chain. And if you have done that, you know that transferring assets across different chains is a pain. To put it nicely. That is why we are incredibly excited to have the Wormhole foundation as a partner of the Empire podcast, stewards of the wormhole protocol, supporting over 30 different blockchains and six different runtimes. Stay tuned. Later in the show we have a cool thing that you can claim, which is a wormhole NFT just for Empire listeners, this episode is brought to you by Monad, which has not only the highest performance EVM l one architecture ever built, but also the wildest and craziest community in crypto. Monad's internal devnet is live and public.

00:01:41.344 - 00:02:19.110, Speaker B: Welcome everyone. Very excited for this podcast. We have Constantine, who I'll let him give his background, which is incredibly impressive. Not only one of the founders of Lido, but he has been, as I think of people that really understand crypto, like this term crypto native. He is someone that is really deep, close to the metal as a builder, but is also an extraordinary investor. He's been early on so many trends, and so it's a great pleasure to have him on. I think at a moment where there's just so much going on in crypto, we're coming out of what seems to be a startled bull market.
00:02:19.110 - 00:02:48.246, Speaker B: There's been incredible success in the staking market. Now there's restaking. So that is something that we'd love to cover here. And I had the privilege of knowing Constantine because he was really kicking my ass. When I was running validators at P two P, you know, I always thought that they were the smartest guys in the room. They really understood networks extremely well, and proof of that was really, they just got like, they. They were one of the winners, I think, of Game of stakes Cosmos, like incentivized Testnet.
00:02:48.246 - 00:03:05.834, Speaker B: And they. And so when he was building Lido, for me, it was a no brainer as people that would really understand how to build and set up ethereum for this transition of proof of stake. And so, Constantine, welcome to the show. Really excited to have you on and make it a lively discussion.
00:03:05.954 - 00:03:10.106, Speaker C: Hi, Santiago. Hi, Anna. So why don't we start with.
00:03:10.210 - 00:03:24.374, Speaker B: Yeah, but just, you know, generally we try to skip intros because they're just kind of, you know, people can go look you up, but give us a quick summary of your journey in crypto and kind of where you are now.
00:03:25.914 - 00:03:53.940, Speaker C: Yeah, I will try to be short in general. I joined crypto in 2014. The first time heard about bitcoin in 2011. But when I heard about that, because my friend, he said, let's buy some video cards like gpu's and start mining. I said him, you know, like that, I don't want to do it. Why? Because it is a Ponzi scheme. You know, like, that's how I feel about the blockchain.
00:03:53.940 - 00:05:08.662, Speaker C: I didn't get anything, you know, like, I tried to read white paper, but I didn't understand the benefits, you know, like, and then in 2014, you know, like, when I had more time, I had already a business, you know, like, it worked pretty well. I started, you know, like, and back then, you know, like, I want to move in another country, you know, like, because I was born in Russia and Russia economy, you know, like, the trend was going down always, you know, like, and for me, I understand that I want to work in a space that is not connected with any country and doesn't have a country risk and blockchain, was there a place that I choose? And with my friend Dimustra Dubsev, I started to. I mean, I started, like, to make research in blockchain, you know, like. And so I joined Cyberfront. And as a result, you know, like, of our research in 2014, we did a report about blockchain assets. It was one of the first report about new asset class where we took all their, like, our space. So we take all their data from Coinmarketcap, you know, like, all their projects that had public valuation vision with more than $100,000.
00:05:08.662 - 00:05:52.764, Speaker C: It only was 100 of them and analyze them you know, like. And what we found out that it was some other projects like bitcoin. First of all, it was a lot of bitcoin forks, but it was also some applications that were built on top of the blockchains. It was some new blockchains with a new consensus algorithm. It achieved security, for example, it was some first proof of stake experiments. And in general we decided, first of all we had a thesis that this market, because of some open source nature, open markets and so on, you know, like that it will grow faster than anything else, you know, like. And I started to dedicate full time, you know, like to it as a cyber fund co founder.
00:05:52.764 - 00:06:28.562, Speaker C: And in 2016, 2017 I ran a fund, it did more than 7000 percentage, but we close it. And in 2000 because you and give all the money to our like, investors. And in 2018, you know, like I also closed Cyberfund, you know, like. And we distributed like all because we invested in Ethereum, SEO, you know, like we invested in Cosmos, we invested in Dfinity, in Polkadot, in all these early stage projects. So we generated some profit for us and distributed between the founders. In 2018, I started. In 2018, I started like P two P.org.
00:06:28.562 - 00:07:03.180, Speaker C: P two P.org is a staking company. And why? Because, I mean, because I really, I already got some like amount of like money to retire, you know, like. But for me, you know, like I wanted to first of all keep this market decentralized and sensor persistent. That's why I started p two p because somebody need to run validators, you know, like somebody need to run these nodes. And I understood that Ethereum will go into proof of stake and in general proof of stake will be big. And to understand blockchain is better to keep them decentralized and censorship resistant.
00:07:03.180 - 00:07:41.424, Speaker C: I started p two p.org as a solo founder and in 20 2020 vasily joined the team. You know, like in general we did later spin off and contributed to Lido Dao, you know, like, and that is now pretty successful. Back then we also co founded Neil foundation that is now working on GK sharding and on scaling of Ethereum. And yeah, and so, like in the same time, days at night, I continue to invest my capital. So I invested in Solana. Back then we invested in Celestia, lazy ledger seed stage.
00:07:41.424 - 00:08:14.026, Speaker C: We also invested in Aguilera and then hundreds of other projects. And you know, like now where, where I am now, you know, like, so I relaunched Cyberfund. In general, Cyberfund is fully, it's first of all investment company. It doesn't have any external capital, you know, like, only, you know, like, it's. So we don't have any external capital. So I allocated my equities that I have, for example, p two, p.org. It is some Lido tokens.
00:08:14.026 - 00:08:57.538, Speaker C: It is some, like, it's nil equity and other equities in it. I'm not going to have dividends from it. But in general, it's a mission driving organization that going to reinvest capital to achieve its mission. And the mission that we agreed together is to accelerate the economy because we believe in acceleration and we believe that it is a new economy coming. We call it cybernetic economy. And in general, we want to accelerate the cybernetic economy. But during acceleration, we understand that it is a lot of risk and our goal is to accelerate economy in a healthy way.
00:08:57.538 - 00:09:35.754, Speaker C: And for example, I just want to give you a short example here. What we did in 2014, we did, we wrote a first report and we call it cybernetic Economy Report. So this idea is from the beginning. And when we wrote this report, we said that blockchain is only part of this economy, new economy. I mean, we look on blockchains like artificial intelligence networks. We understand that it will be a lot of other piece of technology stacks that bring to us more efficient and more healthy for humanity. Economy and blockchain is just a foundational layer.
00:09:35.754 - 00:10:10.194, Speaker C: 2014 to 2023, we did a lot of work in Ethereum by investing. For example, we invested in Ethereum SEO. Then we participated and contributed to Lida to keep it decentralized and resistant. And we contribute a lot to make it healthy for humanity in general. We want to do the same in the blockchain space by investing our capital and also in other areas, for example, in AI, robotics, maybe IoT and other part of future cybernetic economy.
00:10:11.534 - 00:10:31.828, Speaker A: Awesome. Constantin? I think there's a lot of areas I want to get your take on. The first is staking, right? Because you guys have, you guys have a really unique background as investors. You are early backers of Ethereum, Cosmos, Polkadot, Solana, Celestia, anoma, Eigen layer, all these great things. You're also builders, right? P. Two. P.
00:10:31.828 - 00:11:01.992, Speaker A: Lido, nil. So you have a really interesting view on the, on the space. The first place maybe we can talk about is staking. So Lido has done phenomenally well, I'd say. I think the current market share is somewhere around 35% to 40%. And I think a lot of people in the industry kind of freak out a little bit about that market share right. But if you actually, I saw one of your tweets about, look, if you extend this timeline out long enough, a lot of the, maybe Lido isn't the one to worry about.
00:11:01.992 - 00:11:21.924, Speaker A: It's actually coinbase or one of the centralized exchanges. As all of their ETH becomes staked ETH, that market share could eventually cross 50%. So maybe just give us your overview of how you're looking at the staking market today and then tie in together this idea about market share.
00:11:23.424 - 00:12:14.548, Speaker C: Yeah, thank you for the question. In general, as I understand, as I remember, Lidar market share is about 32%, not 35. The question is, first of all, as I told you, when I start to work on p two P.org, why I started this company was fully private because I really believe that somebody need to run the validation nodes. And in general, it's really hard. You should have a pretty lot of expertise to run it safe, to not get slashing. I also understood that it will be a lot of, how to say, large companies, especially when ETF will come and so on, and it will be a lot of acquisition of staking companies.
00:12:14.548 - 00:12:54.844, Speaker C: It will be a lot of, I mean, more stakes that will run by large institutional companies. And if, for example, one day we will come where it will be all run by states, it will be like a bad story for blockchains and the price and also like their blockchain value will go into zero. Why? Because I mean, this network stop to be sensitive, resistant, they can reward state and so on. And it's just database, it's not a blockchain anymore. And that's why I start to run p two p.org validation knows to first of all, understand the blockchain better. And second, you know, like to keep them decentralized and sensor free system.
00:12:54.844 - 00:13:31.102, Speaker C: And after, when we work on Cosmos and Polkadot, and it was the next phase for the company and also for the market, Ethereum is taking launch. Of course, we follow it from day one. We really understood that. First of all, I mean, we had a lot of competitors in validation markets, but all these competitors are our friends. In general, we have friends with corals. It was those guys that were later acquired by drum. It was some other players, like staking facilities, steak, fish, many others like figment, block, diamond.
00:13:31.102 - 00:14:22.454, Speaker C: In general, we compete with each other for market share. But at the same time, we were friends. And our initial idea, we came to these guys and said, guys, what are your strategy on Ethereum? And all of them like, okay, 50% of them didn't want to, even to join validation node in Ethereum. Why? Because they didn't know how to attract stake in Ethereum. And it's good when your network has how to say like a lot of solo stakers and they are really important. It's really great when you have thousands of different validators in the market. But in reality, I mean it's also important that it should be like professional players who really understand how to run a network to make it stable.
00:14:22.454 - 00:14:50.334, Speaker C: And if for example, I knew everyone and like 50 or 60% didn't want to launch in Ethereum, it's bad for Ethereum. Why? Because I mean it will be like ten professional validators, five big exchanges, and there are some tale of solo stakers and network will be really centralized. Why? Because first of all, for Coinbase, by the for binance, it was really easy to sell staking to their clients.
00:14:50.794 - 00:14:51.154, Speaker B: Why?
00:14:51.194 - 00:15:46.702, Speaker C: Because they already have it, they have a communication channel, the acquisition price is cheap, the LTV of these users is high and they can even give it for free. Why? Because you will have a good retention to the exchange. All the incentives was around centralization. When we come to this validators, we say let's launch Lida together in general. And this was initial idea, we even have this chat still now, but by some reason nobody want to build together. And that's why we start to work on it personally and then engage them in a later stage. But the main objective, and it's written in a mission of Lidar, why Lidar will launch is to keep Ethereum decentralized and sensory presist.
00:15:46.702 - 00:16:50.468, Speaker C: And what we also see is that liquid staking will be successful and it will be a big adoption, the same. You can look on USDT and USDC market, but the issue with USDC and USDC markets that the more secure solution is like a custodial solution. Why? Because you can program, I mean you can build a synthetic stable coin, but if you want to build stable coin baked by real dollars with low risk, it looks like it maybe even more safe what USDT and USDC built because smart contract risk is high. But when you build liquid staking, it can be. I mean, why liquid staking is awesome? Because you can show all how to say all what blockchain can do. You can really build programmable smart contracts that operate all this protocol. And I think liquid staking is really one of the great examples of technology regulation where you regulate rules.
00:16:50.468 - 00:17:31.664, Speaker C: It's a great example of sudaos, it's great examples what blockchain give you like transparency, open participation and what Lida did is to build this MVP or product that first of all try to get share of the market and also try to fight with exchanges and build more decentralized solution where it will be not only binance and Kraken back then, and also coinbase that could have 60% of staking. But Linda tried to give the same simple solution, but in a more secure way.
00:17:33.444 - 00:17:38.984, Speaker A: Is the end game for Ethereum to have. Do you think 100% of ETH will eventually be staked?
00:17:40.584 - 00:18:14.976, Speaker C: This is a really difficult question. In general, I really agree with some researchers around MBI. First of all, I don't believe that 100% will be staked. We can also look on other networks that are, for example in Cosmo network you have 20% APR and about 60% of Cosmo atoms are staked. So it's not 80 or 90. And still all the exchanges trade atom. And I don't think that it is a competition.
00:18:14.976 - 00:19:03.706, Speaker C: And the question is how much should be staked? It's a good question. That's why when you design your protocol, you can have a target like emission in AlEC. So for example, you target the staking ratio of 60% or 50% or how Ethereum foundation set about 25%. And for me I really disagree. Of course I have a conflict of interest, but in case of p two p because I am also one of the validators and their revenue depends from emission of ethereum too. If you run Ethereum nodes, for example, of course in case I lied, the contributor. I also have issues here, but my position is.
00:19:03.706 - 00:19:51.936, Speaker C: But I'm also like, yeah, hold a lot of ease. And for me I think the biggest value of ethereum is decentralization and biggest differentiation. I mean, decentralization contribute to security and that's why everybody want to build and that's what on Ethereum. That's why the cheapest liquidity in Ethereum. And if you will harm decentralization by trying to like target the low staking ratio, for example, Ethereum foundation proposed. I mean it's not. They propose to make NVI in general, they don't say that they target some type of percentage, you know, like some of they say that some of them said that it is a little bit different as economy.
00:19:51.936 - 00:20:19.996, Speaker C: But in general, you know, like they want to target more that 30 million should be staked, you know, like I think it's not a good solution. Why? First of all, because Coinbase on their custody has 17 million of ease. And eventually Coinbase is a corporation. And I really love Coinbase. I'm not hater of Coinbase. I think they build a great company. I mean, in general, Brian Arsenic is a great CEO.
00:20:19.996 - 00:21:23.646, Speaker C: In general, they build a great business and they are really positive for crypto. But they are corporations that are work in some legal space and it's really no risk to Ethereum network. And also as a corporation they have shareholders and they need to maximize the profit as an agent in a network. And they eventually will try to stake all this 17 million ETH, maybe they will have even more. For them, the price to run staking is the cheapest one. Why? Because you can, like you can earn more, you know, on a scale with, if you will stake over 70 million, you know, like you can spend lower in infrastructure. Compare with other, for example, professional validators, one, because you can run a lot of validators on one node, you know, like, and you can optimize your cost and also your R and D, you know, like is cheaper for you, you, you can make it more secure.
00:21:23.646 - 00:22:19.270, Speaker C: And it's what I try to say that even with NVI, they can still try to get, or they will get bigger share of the market and they will eventually try to stake all the ease. And if they will, for example, if you will target 30 million and 70 million will be staked by Coinbase one day. And also with ETF's, because ETF's are going to the market and I think one day it will be staked ETF's. I mean, why not? And a lot of them are holding assets on coin. You know, like that means that, I mean, this can even amount of ease on Coinbase can grow, you know, like, and this is a risk, you know, like if you will make a staking ratio low, you know, like that it may be, first of all, Coinbase will have an issue. Why? Because they have a conflict inside of their company. You know, like how to run, how to from one side, they need to make more money, you know, like from other side.
00:22:19.270 - 00:23:06.360, Speaker C: If they will stake more than 50%, they will harm the network and destroy the value of Ethereum. And I think if you don't get this mess in your research and you don't understand what can happen, and this is a pretty big and important step for all Ethereum community to decide what should be emission of Ethereum and what's taking richer should be. And this mistake can be so huge that will harm decentralization. And that's why, first of all, from Cyberfun, we announced our grant program of $500,000 to researchers who want to make external research not in Ethereum foundation, but external research.
00:23:06.552 - 00:23:54.830, Speaker A: I have a potentially really dumb question that I'm still going to ask anyways, which is if the amount of ETH that's staked ends up actually getting to be this huge number that we're talking about, it's being, there's two things that are going to happen. The yield is going to come down tremendously, I would say so I'm curious if that's right or not. And then the second thing is, as institutions, you mentioned, the ETH ETF's eventually one day they'll be probably staking inside of an ETH ETF. The take rate right now on something like Lido, I think it's 10%. But as institutions come into the market, they're not going to be comfortable with that right there. If it was tradfi, they would say, all right, you're 10%, go to another staker. All right, you make me a competitive offer here.
00:23:54.830 - 00:24:14.784, Speaker A: You make me a competitive offer here. And that's going to basically drive fees. That's fee compression, right? So both of those things are kind of like have negative, will have a negative impact on Lido's business, I would think, which is that, right? Yield comes down and fee compression happens. I'm curious how you think about that as it relates to Lido's long term business model.
00:24:16.764 - 00:25:34.082, Speaker C: I think, you know, like, in case of Lido, any staking provider, you know, like, what I really care is about like decentralization. You know, like. And the question is how it should be, can be achieved, you know, like, and I think that decentralized setups, they have higher price, you know, like why? Because, I mean, you, for example, if you run, as I told you, buy one entity, you know, like, it will be much cheaper. And, you know, like, in case of. And that's why I think that, I mean, first of all, when you speak about ETF's and centralized solutions, you know, like, you should understand that they not only care about their returns, they also like rewards, they also care about, like risk, you know, like, and if, and the risk is also high, for example, risk of counterparty, risk of custody, risk of some other, like, piece of infrastructure. And I think that their lidar vision and the mission is first of all to make the most secure solution and if it will be the most secure. And decentralization is part of that, you know, like, the more decentralized it is and lower the risk, then it can be like, I mean, in a pretty good position, you know, like, and I don't think that it will be an issue.
00:25:34.082 - 00:26:17.404, Speaker C: But the question is so, and I don't know, maybe you read the last blog post of Mike neither. You know, like Vistaru, you know, like where they discuss, you know, like, look on treasury market, you know, like bond market, and they discuss lst, lrT's, you know, like Ethereum is taking. It's like. I mean, a question is, you have different, you know, like return and rewards, but you have a different risk too. For example, LRT's with restaking don't just get rewards. They got a really different risk. The same is with ETF's and so on.
00:26:17.404 - 00:26:26.496, Speaker C: You have a lot of different parameters and there are rewards. Only part of them you need to clear on risk reward ratio.
00:26:26.640 - 00:26:47.624, Speaker A: Maybe we can move into restaking. Constantine, I'd be curious to get your take on just the. I think I saw one of your tweets. You said restaking represents a significant innovation, will need more time to fully grasp. Grasp both its potential, but also the risks in the future. I'd be curious to get your take on, I guess both of those things. The potential of restaking and the risks.
00:26:48.524 - 00:27:45.968, Speaker C: Yeah. First of all, I should disclosure that Cyberfont is a seed investor of Eigen lair. And I think that three ram did a great job, introduces this new primitive of restaking. And I mean, I see a lot of potential for it, you know, and in the same time, I mean, it is a risk, you know, I would look on it like an insurance, you know, like, for example, because people are, for now, you know, like, it's a lot of adopters of restaking. But for now, restaking is not even activated. What we have is Eigen layer that get a lot of assets that eventually farm, you know, like, or do some point, or get some points, you know, but one. But in April or like the next quarter, yes, it will be egging Ga introduced, you know, like, that will be a first example of staking, you know, like, and also you should look that on some other markets.
00:27:45.968 - 00:28:13.742, Speaker C: You know, we also, I think, participated in development of neutron. You know, like restaking is already works. For example, Cosmos hub, you know, like activated neutron. And nitron doesn't have a validator set. You know, like, in general, it's run by Cosmos validator set. And in general, all the security is already provided by Cosmos hub. And neutron is running the virtual machine or cosmos hub.
00:28:13.742 - 00:29:20.264, Speaker C: So it is already, like some examples that in production, in general, angular is not activated yet. And I am looking on it that in risk taking, first of all, you get rewards, but you also get a lot of, I mean, you should have a risk because nobody ready to pay for you for your, for example, I don't know, billions of tl without slashing. Why? Because, I mean, it's not, they will not pay you a lot. Why? Because in general, it means that you don't have any risk. And for me, you know, like, like an insurance market, you know, like, I think that it's really question how to price this risk. Why? Because, and we always see what's happening in insurance, especially new markets, people are underestimate the risk because it's not clear a way how to measure it, but the risks are happening usually. And I think that eigenware doing a lot to launch in the right way to try to mitigate all the risk and try to, I mean, do a lot of research on it and launch by stages.
00:29:20.264 - 00:30:29.390, Speaker C: But still, you know, like we will see some, you know, like I think, yeah, some like risks that will be still happened. You know, like in some networks, for example, it can be some type of flashing, it can be some type of new attacks, you know, like that we underestimate, you know, like and so on. So for me, you know, like risk taking is first of all, you know, like you can look on the market, you know, and when you look on the market, I mean, people already restake, stake this in some way. First of all, they use stake this in a lending. And we also can say that this is some type of utility, you know, like where people get some, you know, assets under, under some type of, for example, you can look on leverage staking. What leverage staking is when you deposit stake, for example, on other, you lend some ease, stake it again and do it again and again and you grow your staking rewards, for example, from 3% to 15. And I mean, in general, what it is, it's some type of rest taking.
00:30:29.390 - 00:31:18.232, Speaker C: Why? Because you get the risk of slashing, but not slashing, but liquidation. If the price of tech teas tweets will go down, you will be liquidated, but in the same time you get rewards. So you got this arbitrage of a lending price and staking. And I think this is already example that a lot of people are using stake teas in this way where they are already doing leverage staking. And it will be a lot of other examples of how people will reuse staked assets, for example, in protocols like angular is building. And I think it will be a lot of new oasis that will, how to say, will accept different type of assets. Some of them will accept bitcoin some of them will accept USDT, maybe some of them, some other.
00:31:18.232 - 00:32:12.904, Speaker C: And finally, you know, like we will have a large hype, you know, like, so a lot of assets will come to this market, but, and also it will generate a lot of tokens that maybe will later lose the price. So I mean, it will be really very speculative market. It will have a lot of risk and eventually, you know, like it's short term, you know, like so middle term. I think that, I mean, we will be not so hyped around that. Why? Because the fees that will be generated will be not so high. I mean, if you look on all the networks, you know, like even salon is not producing a lot of fees and long term restaking will generate fees, you know, like it will be some use cases that will be really profitable, that will really generate, I think, a lot of fees. And yeah, this is my vision on restaking.
00:32:14.004 - 00:32:20.464, Speaker A: Nice. What do you think the Ethereum foundation got right over the last couple of years, Constantine? What do they get wrong?
00:32:22.084 - 00:33:32.378, Speaker C: I think Ethereum foundation has improved a lot in case of delivery. And part of that is towards a competition from other protocols. And also part of that was a strategy where it was funding of initial, like client teams. And in general, I mean, a lot of clients teams, they were underfunded, you know, like, I mean, I remember how I met one of the team, you know, like, and they told when, like when I think Lido did a pretty big grant, about $10 million to protocol guild. And we met the team and they said, thank you for the grant that was given in 2021, in the beginning of 2021 and it was 50k grant. And they said, oh, if you didn't give us this 50k grand together with three another team, this will like, we will not hear. And what I try to say that first of all, now the teams are more funded, they are executing much better.
00:33:32.378 - 00:34:34.232, Speaker C: And I mean, it's continuous development, you know, like, I mean, it's a lot of discussion, a lot of good researchers, new faces like Mike Noether and so on, you know, like, and I think that first of all, 1559 changed Ethereum a lot. You know, like it will build a narrative that is not played yet, you know, like I think this bull run like 1559 will maybe help Ethereum to flip bitcoin even. You know, like I really like a big believer in such type of economy. And also like that, I mean, all the roadmap were designed around data availability. It's also right choose and roll ups. So I see that Ethereum foundation, you know, like improving a lot. I still think that decision is maybe like centralized around.
00:34:34.232 - 00:35:27.073, Speaker C: I mean it is of course, I mean, maybe it's the most decentralized now that we have, but it's still not clear. For example, with all this NVI discussed a lot internally, then it was proposed and how it will go, how the decision will go. I think that NVI is the most controversial proposal that Ethereum have for the long time. And it will be a good check of decentralization and decision making, you know, like how it will go. Why? Because I mean, it is a lot of opinions and I mean, in all core devs, you know, like a lot of people have different opinions and it's really important for Ethereum important decision. And I think that such type of controversial proposals will make Ethereum even more strong. You know, like why? Because immunity start to be activated.
00:35:27.073 - 00:35:44.974, Speaker C: And. And I think that decentralization and Ethereum social layer with immunity is one of the two biggest sync around Ethereum. It's make it, I mean, impossible to compete. And this is eversome.
00:35:46.474 - 00:36:50.344, Speaker A: Hey, everyone wanted to give a big shout out to today's sponsor, wormhole foundation, stewards of the wormhole protocol. If you are like Santi and I, and you play around on chain, you know how bad the cross chain experience is today? Well, wormhole has set out to solve that, powering cross chain transfers for over 200 different multi chain teams, including some of the best like uniswap and circle. So what does that mean for you, the empire listener? This opens up a huge number of multi chain use cases across defi, nfts, governance oracles and more, by supporting over 30 different blockchains and six different runtimes, including sui Solana, different ETH, L two S theorem, and a whole bunch more. That means you have now the most powerful interoperability platform at your fingertips. If you're a developer, you'll be excited to hear that wormhole provides an extensive suite of tools and infrastructure so that you can securely build multi chain applications. But don't just take our word for it. Obviously, wormhole protocol leads the industry in all time.
00:36:50.344 - 00:37:10.954, Speaker A: Messages transferred with over 900 million cross chain messages. 900 million. That is close to a billion. And that's a big number of messages. As a thank you, wormhole foundation is dropping exclusive nfts. That's right, we got some exclusive nfts for empire listeners. Hit the link in the description to claim your unique wormhole NFT today.
00:37:10.954 - 00:37:51.990, Speaker A: This episode is brought to you by Monad. Monad's thesis is simple. The EVM is here to stay, similar to JavaScript and web two, but unfortunately, today's EVM lacks the high performance and the scalability that developers need to make certain applications possible. Monad addresses these concerns in these bottlenecks while preserving seamless EVM composability. For application developers, there's a seamless transition to Monad, as the Ethereum RPC API allows for really easy portability. And for developers, Monad can support 10,000 and real transactions per second with their unique parallel execution environment. And of course, there's full compatibility with EVM bytecode.
00:37:51.990 - 00:38:31.538, Speaker A: Monad's internal devnet is live public. Testnet comes out soon. You can join Monad's journey in two ways. One, go follow them. They're on Twitter at Monad, M o N a D, underscore xYz, and also join the Monad discord it's discord gG Monad Big thanks to Monad for sponsoring this episode is brought to you by Shardium. Shardium is an EVM based, linearly scalable smart contract platform that provides low gas fees while maintaining security through dynamic state sharding. Shardium's auto scaling works by automatically adjusting the resources of the system or the application based on predefined rules and metrics.
00:38:31.538 - 00:39:22.048, Speaker A: What this means is that when an application on Shardium goes viral gets big, right? The network reacts by independently adding more active validator nodes from the standby node pool to increase throughput capacity. This does four things. It lowers energy consumption, lowers cost, improves load management, and protects app failures. You can learn more about shardium or even spin up your node at Shm GG validator that's SHM GG validator big thanks to Shardium for sponsoring Empire.

00:40:02.844 - 00:41:05.874, Speaker B: As someone that has spent a lot of time close to the metal building in crypto and investing, you know, what do you think? I'd like to just spend some time on Ethereum and the scalability roadmap. You're also playing in other ecosystems. What do you think Ethereum has gotten really right over the years? You mentioned EIP 1559, the transition to proof of stake. And also, what do you think Ethereum hasn't gotten right? And perhaps what are the reasons why Ethereum may not live up to the potential that you're talking about? In a scenario, it flips bitcoin and perhaps another ecosystem, whether it be solana suis, these next gen blockchains really surpass Ethereum. So let's start with what do you think are the things Ethereum has gotten right? What are the things that Ethereum hasn't gotten right? And in what scenarios does Ethereum lose its competitive edge that it has today?
00:41:07.214 - 00:42:48.850, Speaker C: Yeah, my opinion, you know, like Ethereum did, you know, like, so it's really difficult question, you know, I mean, to, for me, when you look back, I think the right direction was to choose, I mean, this roll up strategy, you know, like, from one side, of course. I mean, each roll up can compete with Ethereum, you know, like, because they can run on the table ability and eventually be only one of you. From other side. Ethereum is still, I mean, it's decentralized and it looks like a root chain and it's really secure and the liquidity is the cheapest one there. I think that, I mean, for me, you know, like, it was different positioning and different vision. You know, like Ethereum had one vision, you know, like that it should so not scale, you know, like, for example, like Solana, and Solana has, like, another vision that they want to scale l one, you know, like, and make a lot of composability around that, you know, like, and I think that, I mean, so, like, ethereum for me, you know, like, I think that ethereum is doing everything right. And of course we can, we can say, I mean, it was a long transformation to proof of stake.
00:42:48.850 - 00:43:59.650, Speaker C: It was like some really, like, not some years that they couldn't execute, you know, like, and deliver, you know, like, like new upgrades, you know, like, and it was like some type of crisis, you know, like but when you, it's really, I mean, easy to look outside of their, you know, like development. But when you look on other companies, when you look on other blockchains, you know, like, I mean you can have like idiot track, but it's impossible. You still need to build this muscle, you know, like muscle of research, muscle of development, muscle of something, like some other parts, you know, like. And I think in Ethereum it was now built. Now Ethereum has really one of the strongest research and one of the strongest community. Ethereum really has teams who execute well. And so for me I think that, I mean, the current roadmap, the last one was published by Mike, it's the right one.
00:43:59.650 - 00:45:24.132, Speaker C: But what I would focus more is, and will try to deliver faster is I will focus on like main clients of Ethereum, it's roll ups, I mean maybe to some applications and so on and try to like prior to the features for them, you know, like, I mean, because sometimes, I mean it's more about theoretic improvement, you know, like for example, and there's a lot of different logic. For example, why do we need 32 is stake, not 1000 and so on? So we need to do this research better, we need to have more external research, for example, this example of NVI. So Ethereum foundation of course did a lot of great work here. But I mean I don't think that they go deeper in validators economy that they calculated what will be the validator set in current staking ratio. And in general it would be great if it would fund more external teams who will do research and maybe have different opinions around that because this is a pretty important improvement. Also now Ethereum foundation in NXR four will deliver triggerable withdrawals. I think it will make all this liquid staking risk taking much more better.
00:45:24.132 - 00:46:21.344, Speaker C: Why? Because the protocols could mitigate a lot of risk if validators, for example, don't want to unstake and their protocols can be more permissionless. And that is a pretty significant improvement. And yeah, so I think that your priorisation of the features, you know, like should go from main ethereum users. For example, if Uniswap is burning like 20% of the gas, I mean, it should have more voice, you know, like in Ethereum developers. If roll ups the future, it means that this roll ups can have influence on Ethereum roadmap. But I think that we eventually come in to the state where Ethereum foundation listened more. The key players on the market.
00:46:26.144 - 00:46:47.124, Speaker B: Maybe as a segue to that, as a key player, I think Lido being and I know you don't speak on behalf of Lido, but you know, someone that's involved in the ecosystem. How has it gone better or worse trying to engage with the Ethereum foundation core developers to, you know, make some proposals?
00:46:49.724 - 00:47:28.540, Speaker C: I think, you know, like, I mean, it's pretty open. The question is that you need to really like be proactive, you know, like, and I mean, for example, it's more about like resources of each team. For example, is it a roll up or is it like Ledge Dao? You know, like. And the question is, I mean, if you are proactive, if you did a good research, if you're going to awkward devs, I mean, you have voice in general. I mean, you will be hurt. And also it can be implemented. So I think that it's a lot improved.
00:47:28.540 - 00:47:50.644, Speaker C: I mean, the Ethereum development is the most open development, as I know, for example. I mean, it has a systematic goals, it's improved a lot. Everybody, and I mean, I think like everyone, every like, party who really contribute a lot to Ethereum can participate. And this is really important.
00:47:53.504 - 00:48:53.944, Speaker B: I want to double click on restaking. I know you're early investor in Eigen layer. How credible or real do you think are the criticisms of, you know, we constantly hear rehypothecation of security, this being a potentially existential threat to Ethereum if something were to go down. I also think of when people were really focused on Lido and, you know, if something were to go wrong with Lido, you know, there's a big stake there, smart contract bug or whatnot. But maybe help us bring more nuance to that discussion because I don't, I don't think it's like, I haven't heard like a very comprehensive discussion. Eigen layer team put out a great set of like frequently asked questions last month and I think that was a good document. But I'd love if you could share your perspective as how you think of these risks and what would be the potential kind of biggest vectors here.
00:48:56.604 - 00:50:37.752, Speaker C: Yeah, I think, you know, like, first of all, I mean, I really believe in the market power, you know, like, and I think that, I mean, market can solve a lot of issues, you know, like, and the protocol design, of course we can. And also, like, angular is doing a lot of like spending a lot of time to research and also like, understand how to launch this, you know, like liquid stake in a safe mode, you know, like really more careful to not get any risk. I think it's even like sometimes bad. Why? Because it's better when, you know, like the risk will happen on small scale, then it will happen if you will eventually will build everything without slashing, without any risk, you know, like in general, you will generate a lot of tokens, make a lot of adoptions and then risk will happen, you know, like so for me, I think it's even like maybe like it should be even like more open and permissionless where anyone can participate. But for me, again, I think first of all, look, on lending markets, for example, it is a lot of assets in lending markets and it's a lot of staked ethereum. It's a lot of other assets and it was a lot of examples even like like how maker oracles works and so on. And in Defi, I don't think that, I mean it's really like large in current state, you know, like that in next couple years, it is a large risk for ethereum.
00:50:37.752 - 00:52:02.884, Speaker C: Why? Because, I mean, because like if it will be like even like 30% is unstaked by some really like large like flashing, you know, like on angular, I don't think that it's in any way harm ethereum network, you know, like it will work as it should. What really I worry more is manipulating of ethereum state, you know, like by restaking, for example if somebody will try to manipulate it in a bad way, you know, like for example bribe, you know, like validators, you know, like they will try to do something wrong. This worry me much more also, like I think that it can be a lot of risk for the capital, you know, like if all, I mean that this oasis can bring. But I don't think that it is a large risk for ethereum itself. Why? Because, you know, like, I mean, first of all, not all its will be staked in restaking. I mean first of all, it will not generate so much feeds, you know, I think the second is if it will be some, you know, like splashing, you know, like it is some way. First of all, how to make it more like secure for ethereum layer one, for example, you can slash lfts or like you can do some other type of flashing.
00:52:02.884 - 00:53:25.206, Speaker C: And I really like things that for now we are in a like hyper free staking, you know, like where it's a lot of like we really like think have a lot of how to say estimation, you know, like we really believe that it will be a lot of rewards. But I don't think that, I think that it's too much like hype and really like, I mean the reality will be a little bit different, you know, like I mean that you don't get so much rewards and general restaking will be just another market like staking or like for example, like lending, you know, like and so on. And I mean eventually need be proved by FIS that all this application will, you know, like will generate. And also for me it's a question in a lot of examples of restaking. Why do you need restaking and you not launching own token? For example, it was today discussion of Vitalik, you know, like in Twitter. And I think that I agree with Sunny, you know, like that for a lot of use cases, you don't need. For some use cases you really restaking will work really well.
00:53:25.206 - 00:53:49.074, Speaker C: But for a lot of them, you know, like, I mean, own tokenism also work well, you know, like and pretty secure, especially if it created an ethereum layer one. And if you slash, not ethereum but you slash like polygon token for example, what is the difference if you don't try to manipulate the proposals or like validators?
00:53:52.134 - 00:54:53.422, Speaker B: Yeah, not to make this poll segment on restaking, but would you agree on eigen layer in and of itself, like staking doesn't rehypothe more leverage to the system. The, perhaps the biggest risk is on the restaking where there may be less competent operators that may promise higher yield. And if there is a bug, if there is a hack, if there's an issue in some of these restakers, in that loop of leverage, that may be the biggest risk. In this kind of like defi summer craziness yields, people are chasing the highest yield opportunities without appreciating the risk. Would you, the risk may be more contained because it may not be as centralized. Right? Like perhaps there'd be more distributed stake among these restakers. But I don't know if you would agree with that.
00:54:53.422 - 00:55:06.554, Speaker B: And if so, if you've thought of like mechanisms that can mitigate the containment or the, the contagion effects of, you know, an event like that.
00:55:07.334 - 00:56:34.914, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, first of all, you know, like, I mean, if it will be like bad apparatus, you know, like it will flash some amount of is, you know, like really, like, I mean, realtor in any way, title one, you know, like I don't think that l, one will have any issues here, but of course people can lose money, but this is a new, in general, you know, like this, what should happen? You know, like if it is a risk, it means that some risk should happen. You know, like if it is rewards, the question you can get rewards, I mean, for what you're paying. If it's zero risk and that is, I think the biggest question in my opinion here, that eventually we will start with zero risk because ideally I will try to mitigate it in some way and with high rewards because it will be a lot of protocols that will just generate tokens. There's not a lot of value, but with high price because of their market hype. And later the market start to be more equal where it is a risk and it is t. Well, and maybe even we will underestimate the risk one day, then the risk will happen and then we will find the equilibrium. But what we need, we need to understand how to price this risk.
00:56:34.914 - 00:57:27.342, Speaker C: And without that experience, without the launch of these protocols, we don't know. Know. And also, like, I think it's a good comparison with insurance company, you know, like why? Because first of all, I mean, it is a policy, you know, like this defined what is the risk, you know, like you cover by this tol. Second, it is a capital. And the third one, you know, like it's slashing. That should happen, you know, like, or if it's zero slashing, maybe then the price should be low and it will not give me so much fees, you know, and that is what we need to, like really like find by the market. And now market don't know how to estimate how much to pay, you know, like what is the slashing risk and is it a risk for people who deposit, you know, like is there.
00:57:27.342 - 00:58:05.574, Speaker C: Yes, of course. I mean, it is a risk and, but I mean, it's like in defi, you know, like if you will, if you ever, like, deposited in a farm, you know, like during Defi summer, you also got the risk of, of smart contracts. But for example, some smart contracts was autonomous. For example, they use synthetix smart contracts where the risk was low. And that's why a lot of capital use it. But what they did, they just pre mined tokens. And then we all see that this mechanic doesn't work and the market stopped to do it in this way, and the same will happen to restaking.
00:58:05.574 - 00:58:25.010, Speaker C: It will be a lot of tokens that will be generated and maybe even it will be safe or with some risk. And then the market and the protocols will stop. If it is no risk, they will stop to pay so much. Constantino, I'd love to maybe switch gears.
00:58:25.042 - 00:58:53.234, Speaker A: A little bit and get your take on. The first time I ever heard you on a podcast was actually the Bankless podcast with Santi. And it was a Solana podcast, and I think it was Q 420 21. I'd love to get your general take on. I mean, you're about as big of an, I think, ETH bowl as one can get with what you've founded, but also what you've invested in. I'd love to get your take on things like Solana, Celestia, some of these other ecosystems that are starting to get some steam.
00:58:54.494 - 01:00:35.288, Speaker C: Yeah. First of all, you know, like, I think that in general, I'm really, I'm working in 2014, you know, from 2014 in crypto, you know, like, and days and nights, you know, like almost without weekends and vacations, you know, and I really love it, you know, like, I really, I really love people who is working in this space. I really love builders, you know, like, and I really, I mean, I love ethereum, you know, like why? Because they built really, like, the social consensus, this legitimacy, you know, like decentralization, so on. But from other side, we have other ecosystems that did a lot of innovations, too. You know, like, for example, cosmos launching already, you know, like, in some way, it is also like Solana that is like building like a different vision, you know, like, and what I think is important that all these people are pushing our market in just forward, you know, they accelerating, for example, Solana by competition accelerated ethereum development, you know, and this is a super great. And for me, you know, well, I am really, like pro acceleration. I say, I really think that we one day will have more fair economy, like economy run by data that will based on blockchain, like an open data with all this AI and ML stuff, you know, like, we can be more efficient, you know, like, and more equal, you know, like, now people live in the best their time, you know, like, they have more food, they're more healthy, you know, like, it's of course worse, but it's, I mean, not so many like it was before.
01:00:35.288 - 01:01:39.390, Speaker C: And I think that, I mean, like, it's one of the best time for humanity and it will be on only better. And that's why I am pro acceleration. And I think that when you invest, you know, like in cosmos and you invested in celestia, you invested in Solana, you are helping to test the hypothesis, you know, like you are and all, like, the ideas to really, like, build a better, like, piece of technology that will help to build you this decentralized, not only decentralized, but more this digital world, you know, like this supercomputer one day. And there. I think that the market is huge and it will be a lot of players. I think that Ethereum is clear winner from last bull run, but it's really hard to compete with Ethereum and Celestia. Solana, Cosmos and others did a pretty great job by building another vision.
01:01:39.390 - 01:02:39.748, Speaker C: We don't know which vision is right. We can only bet by buying these tokens and selling these tokens. And what are, you know, like, or choose, you know, like, on which side you are, you know, like, by investing in it, you know, like, and contributing to these protocols. And for me, you know, like, I don't think that I changed my mind from 2021, you know, like, I'm still on the same page, you know, like, I really love Ethereum, you know, like, and. But at the same time, I am happy with building tolly, you know, like, I'm happy that he didn't stop after all this stuff that happened, you know, like, it was really hard for him, you know, like, I'm sure it's. But he really, like, keep building days and nights and I really love it, you know, like, why? Because generally, finally, what we want to build is century resistant, like machine, you know, like, for all humanity. And doesn't matter who will win if we will keep it decentralized and censorship resistant.
01:02:39.748 - 01:02:55.228, Speaker C: For me, if it will be even another system that I didn't invest, I didn't know them under, what they will deliver, these values, I will be already winner. And that is my vision constant.
01:02:55.396 - 01:03:23.240, Speaker A: I'm going to zoom way out from some of the niche topics or the topics that we're talking about here. I'd love to. I read this cybernetic post that you posted, or the cyber economy eight years ago. I found it on your blog, actually, and it was talking about capitalism. There's two systems, socialism and capitalism, and now there's this kind of new system, cyber economy. A. I'd love to hear how that thesis has developed and if you still believe that, because that was what was eight years ago, 2016.
01:03:23.240 - 01:03:40.224, Speaker A: Right. So I'd love to hear how that thesis has developed. I'd also be curious how this thesis came out of just your time in Russia and how your views on crypto has been influenced by just, I don't know, your childhood in Russia.
01:03:41.364 - 01:04:13.474, Speaker C: Yeah. Thank you for a great question. I think that we have this idea in 2014, 2015. But what I try to say always that, I mean, people are now saying a lot that AI or like, chat, DPT or LLM, they hallucinate a lot. What I can say, what I want to say is that people are hallucinating even more. So. I mean, back then in 2014, 2015, we didn't know.
01:04:13.474 - 01:05:01.074, Speaker C: We couldn't imagine how this ecosystem will evolve. And we were just believers who really tried to imagine how the smart contracts ethereum network will evolve. What will be the future? And our concept of cybernetic economy in general, that will find equilibrium between capitalism and socialism, where in general it will find this equilibrium. Why? Because we will have more data. Why? Because we will have more efficient economy. What we need, first of all, we need more public layer, and at the same time we need like, AI and other like, things that will help us to generate objective, you know, like information. And I think that, I mean, we had this vision and we had a lot of hallucination back then.
01:05:01.074 - 01:05:44.474, Speaker C: And now, you know, like, I mean, we are, with all this launch, you know, like, with all this, I mean, with all development of AI, with all the development in blockchains, I really see that this future is coming. I mean, we are really closer to it. And I was happy to relaunch cyber fund with the same vision that we need to achieve it in general. I really believe that capital and technology will come together on blockchain and singularity will come maybe one day. We don't have money. And what we can do, we can just build it, we can just accelerate it, can help and make it more healthy for humanity. And that's what we are doing.
01:05:45.014 - 01:05:51.554, Speaker B: I just thought it was money. So in a world where there's no money, then what do we have? No, I'm kidding.
01:05:52.894 - 01:06:20.914, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, it's funny because we don't know what the question, we need to achieve it. We need to achieve another level of society. And the question is how? And I think that capitalists work really well, but can be more efficient. Yes, of course. And we are building these technologies and maybe like one day with singularity, we don't need to work anymore. Or, like, I mean, the society will change a lot. And I think that it's great.
01:06:20.914 - 01:06:45.364, Speaker C: I mean, first of all, it's inevitable, you know, like, so we can't change it. Even if I will do nothing and will retire, it will happen. But what we can do, we can just bet and like, try to make this world better. You know, like, for example, but not by not investing in states, but by investing in ethereum and also try to make it happen faster. And that's what we are doing.
01:06:47.424 - 01:06:57.004, Speaker B: I want to ask you two questions. The first one, what has surprised you the most in your crypto journey?
01:07:00.404 - 01:07:50.744, Speaker C: Yeah, what surprised me most? Good question. I mean, it was so many surprises. First of all, I mean, one of the surprises is because in 2014, I had zero experience in development of it products that it's, first of all, so hard to build this new layer and build adoption around it. For example, ethereum proof of stakeholder took six years. When I listen now, these guys who are building AI and they say, oh, a gi will be in three years or some type of agi. I really understand that as I underestimate a lot of complexity, it will take much, much more time. And I think this was a big surprise, how much time it can take.
01:07:50.744 - 01:08:38.244, Speaker C: Yeah. So another surprises, you know, like, I can't even, I don't have an answer here. You know, like, I mean, it's in general, you know, like, every day I'm like, or I'm reading a lot of Twitter, like, and as everyone, you know, like, maybe now people are even more forecaster, but, you know, like, but. And in general, I really like enjoying my time in crypto, you know, like, and I'm enjoying how the crypto is evolving. You know, of course, we are focused more on infrastructure, so we are focused on 1% of, you know, like, project in crypto. But people who are working in it, you know, like, they are really awesome. And, I mean, I really love it and, yeah.
01:08:38.244 - 01:08:48.524, Speaker C: And what is. Maybe you can answer here, what surprised you more? You know, like, can you tell us?
01:08:54.304 - 01:10:15.924, Speaker B: I think there's not a day that goes by that I don't, like, appreciate, but I'm in constant awe of how crypto is fitting in the kind of the jigsaw puzzle of how the world shaping up both in good and bad ways. Like, crypto, I think, comes at the right time. Unfortunately, the world has become more centralized, has become more polarized. There's more distrust of institutions. And that has always been like, I think immediately what you are drawn to when you discover something like bitcoin, but then you layer on top like AI. And I just think that crypto, the more I think of it, the more I'm surprised of how integral crypto is to solving some of the biggest challenges that we are facing, but also the biggest opportunities of unlocking, like, a step function improvement in how we coordinate the fabric of society. It's really tough when you look at people and they ask you, why crypto? And you say, well, because I I think it's the most social impactful socioeconomic transformation of our, of our time.
01:10:15.924 - 01:10:30.702, Speaker B: And they're like, seriously, like, isn't that a casino? Isn't like, why wouldn't you say something like biotech? Why wouldn't you say something like AI? And I'm like, certainly those two areas, like, have a ton of importance.
01:10:30.888 - 01:10:31.234, Speaker C: Why?
01:10:31.274 - 01:11:03.828, Speaker B: Because they're closer to the real human experience. Unfortunately, crypto struggles because it's a bit farther removed. It's, it's on the back end, right? And it is difficult. No one kind of says like, it's difficult to like, tangibly see crypto as something that really transforms the fabric of society. Whereas if you see a vaccine, it's like, it's a vaccine. But I think crypto will power all of that. It will improve coordination by orders of magnitude.
01:11:03.828 - 01:11:59.634, Speaker B: Therefore, money moves faster, ideas get discovered faster and get funded faster. And that has a downstream effect in biotech, in AI. And I think bringing it all together, the thing that surprised me the most is that I didn't fully appreciate the big picture. And I've said it recently, and I'll say it again here is I think I'm earlier to crypto today than what I was in 2012 because now I have a better and deeper appreciation and understanding of how tangibly transformative this can be. And I'm a bit scared that it is happening all in real time. And I just thought that it would take much longer and it probably will, but it's just fucking crazy. Like, it is a privilege to be here and to be a part of it and like be living and breathing it.
01:11:59.634 - 01:12:13.454, Speaker B: And, you know, that kind of gets you through the bear market can it gets you through the moments where it's difficult to, right. To build in the open and to be in crypto sometimes, but it's incredibly rewarding too.
01:12:14.874 - 01:13:22.020, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, that's definitely amazing, you know, like, and there I really like, that's why also love to invest capital, you know, like not only build because you also can help so people, you know, like to build their ideas, you know, like for example, we just found that metallics, you know, like in their buildings, this cybernetic organizations, cyborgs. And I really understand that. I mean, it's impossible to change. I mean, like the world, you know, like, because I mean, legal is so old, you know, like, and I mean, it's really like adopt innovation. Not so fast from one side we are lucky, let's say not so fast from our other side, you know, like it bring a lot of issues. And also I really, when I built my project, like when I built like this new products, you know, like I really get so much new experience. And I really understand that for web two developers, for people who are outside of crypto to build a dao, to build the decentralized autonomous organization is almost impossible.
01:13:22.020 - 01:14:31.930, Speaker C: Why? Because you need to learn the basic stuff and it takes years. You need to make a lot of mistakes. You need to really do a lot. And if you will try how to say, to build, I mean, like some basic stuff like as infrastructure, as a framework, you know, like for example, these new organizations that really like designed like daos in the right way that are really work with legal frameworks, you know, like they don't generate a lot of risk for founders and so on. This infrastructure that we are building can really like long term, you know, like bring a lot of new founders and really change our landscape a lot. You know, like, and that's why for me I really like try to find these groundbreaking things, you know, like for example, metallics, that is a big building, like from one side, a legal firm from other site, like technology to really launch new type of organizations and make it more simple. And eventually it will come to, as you said, to new economy.
01:14:31.930 - 01:15:56.512, Speaker C: And crypto is one of the foundation of it. And when you come to AI now, it's also interesting why? Because when you speak with investors who invested in AI, usually they are not so technology heavy and a lot of infrastructure in AI, cryptography and so on, they really have a lot of intersection with crypto. And it's really interesting how, you know, investors from cryptor can be really like good investors in AI and also like teach people, founders from AI, how they can use blockchain also, like, I mean, blockchain can use AI in some way. You know, like, for example, we can have a second opinion from assistant on DaO proposals. We can have a lot of other things from AI. AI can have a lot of things from their, like blockchains, build some incentives on tops, have like, accounts for AI agents, you know, like on top and build economy, open economy on it. And also like, yeah, so, I mean, all of this will merge, you know, like, and I think that we are really, like, I mean, in the best place ever, you know, like for humanity, you know, like, and we have this really chance where technology is so fast that it's impossible to, I mean, I think that for people, for humanity, it's really impossible to run so fast.
01:15:56.512 - 01:16:59.172, Speaker C: And one day it will evolve, you know, like in singularity. And we will, I hope that this all will create a better and more fair place for more people on the planet especially. You asked me about, you know, like, my russian experience here. So, I mean, I was born in Russia and, yeah, and for me, you know, like, I mean, all this economy and like, corruption, a lot of other things really, like, pushed me away, you know, like, so I moved from Russia, like, more than five years ago. And I mean, all what's happening, you know, like, I mean, in general, from one side, it was a lot of it companies that were will grow, you know, because nobody touched them, you know, like, in Russia. And it was a lot of clever people. And it is a lot of clever people there from other side, you know, like all this, all these bureaucrats all.
01:16:59.172 - 01:17:45.138, Speaker C: And I mean, like, all these politics guys, you know, like, they. The trend was going down always, you know, like, I mean, they. It was there, and it's really bringing me to where I want to build business outside of Russia. Why? Because I really understand that it's impossible and also outside of any country, so global. Just open a computer and work in a global space. And I think that crypto make it happen because I am a guy from Kalingrad, a small city between Lithuania and Poland. You know, like, invested in Ethereum, Ico, and like, many other projects buy bitcoins, you know, like, and that was, it is awesome, you know, like, it's create.
01:17:45.138 - 01:18:36.954, Speaker C: It's destroyed. Like Silicon Valley, you know, like, funds that, you know, like, only has this opportunity to invest and give it to everyone. And I think that maybe, like, new ICo platform is not so bad idea, you know, maybe because we really need to find a way how to find new talents and give opportunity to everyone. And I mean, now, like, it is a war in Russia that started by Russia, and it's really, like, I mean, the worst time, you know, like, and I don't have any, like, words, you know, like, and I don't know, will I ever back to this country? You know, like, why? Because it's not clear how. I mean, the trend can be changed, you know, like, I mean, it's not clear how. I mean, it's a lot of propaganda. People are listening it.
01:18:36.954 - 01:18:47.182, Speaker C: They had hard opinion, and I don't see any good way. Let me tell you about how in.
01:18:47.198 - 01:19:23.874, Speaker B: The 15th century, tsarist Russia and the roots of Ukraine. I'm kidding. You know, how the interview with Putin started with Carson Tucker. But now what's really, I mean, I think it's very exciting and refreshing to hear your takes as both a builder and an investor. And I think more and more people are realizing how crypto can improve coordination and really facilitate when you're exchanging value. People start caring more. Otherwise, they don't care.
01:19:23.874 - 01:19:59.084, Speaker B: They have attention span and, you know, they lose interest. But crypto, that's why speculation so important and you're transacting value. So with daos with everything, there's skin in the game. So the hope is that, you know, ideas get discovered faster, founders from every background place get funded, and that's really exciting, right? Someone like you, you know, or how many projects have you back that you do care. You don't even look at a resume. You don't care if they have a four year education. It's like, show me your GitHub repo, show me what you built.
01:19:59.084 - 01:21:04.834, Speaker B: And it is a very competitive market. It's open source. And the beauty of that is that, you know, projects like Lido or others can really go on this escape velocity because money's moving at the speed of light from every corner of this world and people are constantly looking at it. Yes, it's adversarial, there's exploits will be exploited, but over time, there's Lindy built in, there's resiliency, and that creates, I think, the backbone and infrastructure for kind of the value layer of the Internet. And I don't know what that's going to look like. No one could predict that Uber would come out of smartphones, but it's so hard to predict how technology is going to impact and the kind of applications. But I feel like more and more you have this fundamental belief and conviction that there's probably no better way to transact in a digital manner than through open, decentralized, distributed blockchains.
01:21:04.834 - 01:21:59.696, Speaker B: And it's going to fit into so many of the things that we're seeing now, and that unlocks not only a lot of efficiencies in the current systems, but so many applications that we haven't even begun to imagine, we can't even imagine. Surmise today. Maybe you can, I can't. But you're just going to be here and hopefully you're going to catch the big ones. Right? So I've said it, and just to round it out, but I've said it time and time again, I felt that the best investors in crypto are founders or are very close, or like, are building, are actively participating in these networks. And I think you're just the hallmark of what that means, because you're doing both. And, you know, I don't think there's luck that you've been able to find and back at the earliest of stages some of the leading projects time and time again over.
01:21:59.696 - 01:22:13.684, Speaker B: Over the many years you've been in the space. So big congrats to you. Any parting thoughts? I think this has been a great discussion, a lot of things we've covered, but I don't know, if there's anything else you want to touch on before we leave.
01:22:16.464 - 01:23:32.004, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I think that I want just to tell you, like, to tell everyone, you know, like, who listens this podcast, you know, like, that they should keep building, you know, like, every day. And I think it's the biggest opportunity in their life, you know, like, I mean, we also continue building. Let's build together, you know, like, we also, like, actively investing, you know, like, in all this intersection, blockchain, AI, other markets, you know, like, and we really happy to support founders, you know, like, who are really doesn't matter where they are, you know, like, the important is that they want to build open source, you know, like healthy for humanity technologies, you know, like, and they're that run by open market, you know, and, yeah, so really excited, you know, like, what's happening. I think that we are, like, in a new, like, in a really good place, you know, like, to drop your, like, if you're a student, drop university, you know, like, if you are, like, employee, you know, like, you can drop your, like, work and start building, you know, like, new ideas that will help us to build this cybernetic economy together.
01:23:35.624 - 01:23:37.120, Speaker A: Guys, great play to end.
