00:00:00.280 - 00:00:03.486, Speaker A: All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Empire. This is a little prelude.
00:00:03.510 - 00:00:05.438, Speaker B: We just had Dan from CMS on.
00:00:05.446 - 00:00:23.302, Speaker A: The show and Avi Feldman from Golden Tree. This episode just leaks Alpha. These guys are so freaking smart. Some of the best traders in crypto. Unfortunately, 45 minutes into the episode, wifi craps out on us. Mike and I do a little bit of an outro afterwards, just a little bit of commentary on the episode. This was such a good app.
00:00:23.302 - 00:00:30.914, Speaker A: I think you guys will really enjoy it. Stay tuned for the. For the director's cut, if we shall say, after the episode. Now let's get on with the show.
00:00:34.494 - 00:01:01.536, Speaker B: All right, everyone, we are back with another episode of Empire today. Santi is sitting this one out. Mike was calendar stalking me. He saw that we were recording with the legends, Avi Feldman, head of crypto trading at Golden Tree, and we got Dan, one of the co founders of CMS, joining today. Mike, I think because you were so excited about this episode, you usually don't join me, but you're subbing in for Santi on this one. I think we're going to throw the first question over to you. You want to do the honors, my friend?
00:01:01.680 - 00:01:27.750, Speaker C: Sure. Avi and Dan, sorry you guys are stuck with the b squad and Santi couldn't be here, but I'll do my best. I want to start with the most talked about thing in crypto, which is just this growing intersection between macro and crypto. I think most of our industry, crypto is behind right. On rising inflation and how the Fed was going to respond and just hiking rates. I think people are very, very aware on it right now, and probably there's a concern that they're actually over indexing. Right.
00:01:27.750 - 00:01:48.224, Speaker C: Like, you got all these people in crypto talking about inflation and Walmart earnings and stuff like that, which has maybe made me think that we're over indexing on it. I'd be curious to get your guys take as kind of people who walk in in both realms, like, how much are central banks, rising rates, how much is that still driving price action in crypto? And kind of, have we seen the worst of the sell off so far?
00:01:50.164 - 00:01:59.396, Speaker D: The second part of the question is a little bit of a sneaky one. Have we seen the worst of the sell off? The answer to that is, I've got absolutely no clue. And that's the one that I tried.
00:01:59.420 - 00:02:00.492, Speaker B: To get you to walk right into.
00:02:00.548 - 00:02:37.424, Speaker D: That one. It's like, I can. Yeah, like, I feel like all of, all of my macro discussions have gone exactly the same way over the last six months, which is, hey, it looks really bad. And no, I don't know how it ends up. You have these two pretty disparate schools of thought right now. You've got one that basically says, yeah, we're going to stick a landing, maybe it'll be painful for a year. I think at this point, basically everybody but the administration is admitting that a recession's on the horizon.
00:02:37.424 - 00:03:30.526, Speaker D: And I think that know we're likely to see probably the recession hit in the next six months or so. But then there's the other school of thought that, hey, this thing's like a fundamental shift in the market, right? That this macro environment's actually complete change from everything that we've seen from the last 40 years, and therefore we have to be braced for a completely new world. And really that's kind of the crux of the issue. And thats actually a very difficult issue to parse out. And so when I look at crypto, what I see actually right now happening is I see bitcoin is tied to macro more than ever. I mean, every single morning I wake up and Joe Nagers, my partner here at Golden Trees, been in tradfire for 30 years at this point. Great macro guy.
00:03:30.526 - 00:04:03.116, Speaker D: We talk macro every morning, even though we run the crypto team together. Right. And the reason we do that is because if you look for it, it's still tick for tick. It's just basically there's no differentiator on the beta component at this point. It's just all the alpha component. And sometimes the alpha is slightly higher and sometimes it's slightly lower. So sometimes crypto acts stronger than the direction of the S and P, sometimes it acts weaker than the direction of the S and P, but it's not necessarily decoupled in any meaningful way.
00:04:03.116 - 00:04:32.814, Speaker D: And I think that's just a function of the amount of uncertainty that's currently out there. I think my six to twelve month outlook on this is that broadly, the crypto markets are going to be correlated with the macro markets, and we're probably not going to be able to extract ourselves anytime soon. But you're going to find pockets of dispersion, and that's where you probably want to be playing. If you're a trader and if you're an investor, you probably just want to close your eyes because this is a transformative tech. But you know, that's, that, that's my, that's my high level view.
00:04:34.314 - 00:04:50.354, Speaker E: Yeah. Look, I mean, like I kind of mirror what Avi's saying. The back, you have that question of like, is it bottom. Like from a macro perspective, like I had no idea. And like I don't think anybody in crypto in particular has like any real idea. Abhi probably has like gray color because at least it's in like a tradfi institute a little bit. Yeah.
00:04:50.354 - 00:05:37.334, Speaker E: But like, I mean, like in general, like I say this a lot where I'm like, if you're like really good at like figuring out like where the macro components are going to go, then like just don't bother with crypto. Like that doesn't really make a ton of sense to me if like that is like really where your edges. And I also just think like nobody really has like a ton of edge on these things. Or if they do, it's like on minuscule sort of amounts. So that sort of gets me to the whole thing of like what do you do in response to this is like really nothing like, or at least like we haven't like fundamentally like looked at any heuristics of like what any larger macro markets are doing and been like, oh, we're going to trade according to this. I mean, like the other thing is Avi alluded to too is like bitcoin in particular being the largest and sort of most hooked into sort of chat buy has like just really traded lockstep with the queues now and then. Like ETH probably secondary.
00:05:37.334 - 00:06:49.990, Speaker E: Maybe it has some like event stuff that like helps it disperse a little bit. But like in general, like the larger assets are just like really trading is like beta components to like equities and then specifically like tech equities. So that sucks because that's like not really like fun being in crypto and just like taking a ride in equities, especially because you're like taking a lot of like other risks being in this industry which are like not necessarily clear if you're just gonna like perform sort of as like the sort of the existing like markets, that's not like really worth it either. So I don't know, do I think this will last forever? Like, no, like, I think this is like a period where like the look, unlike the hierarchy of things that matter, there's real world things that are more important to people at certain times in their life and you're seeing that now. And crypto is just way down on the rank order of things that matter. And that's going to persist until things calm down and chill. But to get to the point of, oh, we're going to a recession or not, the bigger thing is that markets are forward looking so they'll bottom before things are the worst in the real world, which is, I think, why you see a disconnect a lot of times on Twitter where, like, people are feeling peak shitty about the world when, like, that's already sort of behind us in the market side.
00:06:49.990 - 00:07:22.656, Speaker E: You definitely saw this when, like, three arrows was blowing up and, like, the worst fears about contagion were like, sort of like three or four days, like, after, like, the actual fears of contagion had sort of, like, played out. So that's like, my thoughts on raw, which is like a really long winded way of saying, like, I don't know, strap in and just deal with it. Like, it's not gonna last forever. But, like, we are subject crypto to. To a master, like, other than ourselves for a while. And I don't think that'll change very, very quickly, hopefully after the midterms. I think that's a good line in the sand of when we get a regime change, hopefully.
00:07:22.656 - 00:07:24.124, Speaker E: But who knows?
00:07:24.744 - 00:08:06.850, Speaker C: Yeah, I guess that's really my, I know it's really difficult to predict. I mean, there are a lot of folks out there who try to read the tea leaves of the Fed and forecast what's going on with interest rates. I think you can see by the performance of analysts over the last six months, no one's particularly good at that. Very few people actually anticipated this rate hike cycle. I guess my question to you and Dan, you might have started to answer this. Sorry, you cut out a little bit there, but this kind of correlation between, let's say, crypto and the Nasdaq, right, where investors kind of globally view crypto as this, we've kind of slotted neatly on the last kind of part of the risk curve, where bitcoin and the rest of crypto included, is, like, kind of the most risky of risky asset classes. I mean, do you think that that, like, how long does that correlation last? So I guess, let me frame it like this.
00:08:06.850 - 00:08:25.230, Speaker C: Is that the permanent slot for crypto? It's a new frontier technology, and until it becomes more commoditized and less frontier, it's just going to trade basically, like high beta QQQ. Or do we, like, break that kind of correlation at some point? And if so, like, why? Like, what would be the catalyst or some potential catalyst for that correlation breaking?
00:08:25.422 - 00:08:51.008, Speaker E: So I think there's two reasons. Like, crypto or any asset in it is going to become more correlated to, like, the larger, like, sort of markets. Like, one is size. Like, as things just get to a certain size, like they just become. Right, like if you become more of the index, like, you become like the index and like, you are obviously going to like move more in lockstep with it. That's just like, you see that with bitcoin in particular, right. But as these assets get larger, they'll be tied to like other larger markets and the larger economy.
00:08:51.008 - 00:09:38.206, Speaker E: Like, that's just the natural evolution of it. The second thing is like going to be like, you're going to have regimes where what matters in the market is like independent of what's happening in like any individual components of the market, right? So, like in generally, this is on the way down, like where everything, like, becomes beta one. But the idea is that there'll be periods where it doesn't matter, the idiosyncrasies of the risk asset. They're just going to trade all lock in step. And those will come and go as you have shocks or changes in regimes, in larger markets. This won't last forever and it'll change, but there's also just an underlying trend towards it becoming more correlated with larger markets as it gets bigger. We shed two thirds of the market cap, though.
00:09:38.206 - 00:09:51.526, Speaker E: So it's gone a little bit of the other way where like there'll probably be more idiosyncratic moves if we decorrelate from the larger risk side in like the longer tail of assets in particular. So that would be sort of how I see that playing out over time.
00:09:51.670 - 00:10:49.534, Speaker D: Yeah, I think the most important thing for decoration in the markets, and I'm going to talk ex bitcoin right now, but really it's adoption at the end of the day, because if you think about it well, what causes decorrelation? It's the presence of idiosyncratic flows. And for bitcoin, I actually don't necessarily think that there are going to be a tremendous amount of idiosyncratic flows ex the risk markets. I think that people generally tend to buy bitcoin when they're feeling bullish on risk markets or when they think that global liquidity is flush and that tends to correlate with the s and p going up as well. And they bet on bitcoin as sort of the fastest horse to move. I think that's the current mindset of people that are buying bitcoin. But the current mindset of people that are buying stuff like Ethereum or maybe Solana or avalanche or this other stuff is that, hey, we might actually be building an entirely separate financial system right now. And if you start to see a real adoption, then its hard to fade that growth.
00:10:49.534 - 00:11:32.872, Speaker D: You look at tech and you say, well, im not going to bet in 2010. You're not going to bet against the growth of stuff like Facebook. You're not going to bet against the growth of stuff like Uber just because it's truly getting adopted. The day to day of what the stock market did didn't really matter as much. Obviously it mattered, but it just not going to matter for the one, two, three year trend just because the stuff was growing so massively. I think if you want to see decorrelation in the crypto markets, you need to see all of those ideas of what the crypto market should be in a couple of years start to be fulfilled. And you got to see users coming in and you got to see that adoption curve really tick up.
00:11:32.872 - 00:12:10.950, Speaker D: And I think its happening. I actually do think were seeing signs of that right now. I mean, Im seeing it even in all my conversations here. People are really interested in actually going and building stuff in crypto. Golden Tree does a lot of credit, do a lot of debt. I mean, one thing thats always in the back of our mind is, hey, when are we going to find a loan that we can settle through a protocol? Its actually not a matter of if, its just a matter of when this stuff happens from my perspective, because there are so many benefits to it. And then once you start to get that happening, then I think you start to see decoupling in the market.
00:12:10.950 - 00:12:46.112, Speaker D: But basically right now, most people look at crypto and most people look at all the assets that are in existence right now is tools for speculation and tools for speculation. They just generally follow liquidity. I think the answer that youre looking for is really real adoption is going to lead to decoupling. And I think if I were to take a guess where you look for that real adoption. First, based on what I understand about this market and what people are most interested in, its probably either a, in gaming or b, in moving traditional financial products onto crypto.
00:12:46.248 - 00:13:27.506, Speaker C: Yeah, I've got maybe a more immediate question just in terms of idiosyncratic flows around a big catalyst, which is the merge coming up. So I want to ask you about that. But then I also want to get your longer term perspective on gaming versus defi and where you see mass adoption happening. But let me ask you about the merge, because on the one hand, this has been a really interesting topic because obviously there are two schools of thought out there, which is there's this enormous macro overhang. I think most people think that we haven't seen the last leg down in equities, or there's still some pain to be worked out. Maybe it's a recession, maybe whatever it is, it's difficult to forecast, but there's a lot of worry that's out there. But on the other hand, you have this incredibly powerful catalyst in the form of the merge and what that's going to do for Ethereum.
00:13:27.506 - 00:13:44.256, Speaker C: So I guess my question to you is, sitting on both you guys have some insight into flows and what's going on. Do you see, is there any evidence that investors are ignoring the macro, like, taking a bet on Ethereum, the merge, or is that not a powerful enough catalyst to drive those, like, idiosyncratic flows that you were talking about?
00:13:44.360 - 00:14:09.096, Speaker E: I mean, I think you saw it off the bottom, right? Like, ETH bounced a lot harder, like it had lost ground on the way down, but, I mean, it just traded higher beta. But I don't know. I think there's, like, a real argument that there's, like, flows that are looking to, like, just play that event, like, there. I mean, we definitely talk to people that are doing it, like, so, like, there's some anecdotal evidence that people are putting it on. So, I don't know. I think that, like, matters. I think that's, like, a real risk.
00:14:09.096 - 00:14:21.520, Speaker E: The question is, like, whether or not it's just gonna get faded and it's just some, like, sort of, like, shitty market, like, quick trade that everybody puts on. Cause, like, everyone is dying to do something, but, like, the back half of it is, like, it is a material change in, like, supply.
00:14:21.672 - 00:14:30.880, Speaker D: Yeah, I'm actually curious. What do you, like, if you had to. If you had to take a. Take a stab, it's like, hey, this is a move that's gonna get reverted, or this is, like, an actual trade that's gonna. That's gonna keep going.
00:14:30.992 - 00:14:31.216, Speaker E: Like.
00:14:31.240 - 00:14:32.528, Speaker D: Curious what your take is, Dan.
00:14:32.656 - 00:15:07.074, Speaker E: Yeah, I. Look, if you put a gun in my head, like, it trades like, the heavens, right? So, like, it runs up into it, it gets sold back half a bit, but then it just, like, slowly resets higher. Like, so call it, like, into the event higher, then call. It loses maybe a quarter of that, and then it just, like, grinds back up. I mean, this is, like, how we've seen the heavens play out in bitcoin, which is, like, kind of my heuristic for this whole thing. But, like, I think, like, that imbalance, like, supply demand side on the back half of it will be, like, more than enough to take the speculators, like, supply out and then sort of grind it higher. I think it should reset higher.
00:15:07.074 - 00:15:16.702, Speaker E: If not, like there's a lot of other issues then in the supply side, or at least like the demand side for all the cryptos, but that really should be able to keep it higher.
00:15:16.838 - 00:16:14.966, Speaker D: Yeah, that makes sense. One thing that I was struggling with, with ETH BTC was it felt like almost everybody that I talked to, and this was voice in the options markets, people were basically pricing this via options. Like a bunch of people came in and just started lifting topside. Uh, and I think that actually was probably more prevalent than the actual spot buying that went through. Like, if you ask me what led to the ETH BTC move, I'd probably say a ton of short term speculation lifting top side and then a bunch of liquidations, and then, then it leaves the question of, oh, well, like, are there actual spot buyers that are going to, that are going to come through on this thing? And I think the answer is probably yes. So I think we end up in the same spot because I do think that the crypto markets, I mean, just generally are very reflexive and induce fomo like that. But I think on ETH BTC, I'm actually a little bit scared to be long at here.
00:16:14.966 - 00:16:46.276, Speaker D: I'd say that I would definitely be worried over the next month or two being long ETH BTC here just because it feels like it's a super crowded trade. But I do think, like in three, six months, maybe it's higher. Definitely a tough spot, though. I think just more broadly, the markets are in a tough spot. I think people are like, kind of what you said, dan, they're kind of just searching for something to do. Right. It's like, so, like, what's, what's kind of, what's kind of the next trade that they, people can put on because honestly, like, if you look at it at a high level, market's kind of slow right now, not, not much going on.
00:16:46.276 - 00:16:46.780, Speaker D: Right?
00:16:46.812 - 00:16:50.740, Speaker E: Like, oh, it's so slow. There's nothing going on. It's, it's why I got into your summer.
00:16:50.772 - 00:16:54.344, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, look, that's literally why I look well rusted.
00:16:56.604 - 00:17:41.902, Speaker E: There's nothing going on. And I think the bigger problem is nobody wants to put risk on for a month out because you can just get rugged in tradfi any other week and nobody wants, everything's getting pushed forward closer to the events, I think, because nobody really feels comfortable sitting in any risk through all the, you have all these random macro prints that can just body you in the short term and I don't know. Like, people are. They can't handicap it or they. They're bad at handicapping it. And, like, why bother taking that unnecessary risk into it? I mean, like, that was the right trade, too, right? Like, if you, like, the earlier you sort of had put this merge trade on in Q one or even, like, most of Q two, like, you're dead. Like, it just, like, really didn't, like, work out.
00:17:41.902 - 00:17:44.678, Speaker E: So I think people are, like, concerned about that still, like, into it.
00:17:44.766 - 00:17:47.302, Speaker B: So it feels like the bull case right now for something like ETH is.
00:17:47.318 - 00:17:47.550, Speaker E: You got.
00:17:47.582 - 00:18:17.196, Speaker B: You've got the merge. The bear case is something like we haven't. This doesn't feel like other cycles. There's still too much leverage left in the system. Maybe the bigger bear case is just the bigger macro, like, recession impending. Are you guys paying attention to or you trade these almost what I would call sub narratives, the new l ones coming up, like Sui and Apdos. Is that something that you guys pay attention to, that you trade, or you just think that this is the market desperately searching for a narrative, and you're like, I'm not touching that thing with the ten foot pole.
00:18:17.270 - 00:18:34.784, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, I trade it because I'm an addict. I've got nothing better to do. So, like, of course. Of course I'm going to go out there and trade and trade this stuff. I mean, I actually, on the. On the l one thing, I'm not sure what there is to trade there yet, but at least, you know, there are all sorts of, like, micro rotations and. And random things that happen.
00:18:34.784 - 00:19:04.240, Speaker D: There's, like, a tiny little warm ball of capital that's moving around. And so, you know, I try to. I try. I try to follow that and make trades. I mean, like, one example of this, I think that's probably most prevalent is that l two s are looking pretty good recently. And so I'm looking at things that are on arbitrum. I'm looking at things that are on optimism, like, hey, maybe I should be deploying some capital here, short some ETH against it, kind of play that trade, but there's not a ton.
00:19:04.240 - 00:19:07.324, Speaker D: I'll say. But I'm looking at it for sure.
00:19:08.664 - 00:19:35.776, Speaker E: There's nothing to do, right aptos, like, raising a bunch of money. I don't think there's an actionable market trade that you put on, like, in any realtic timeframe, because the trade there is just, like, invest in it if, like, that's, like, really what you want to do. So. And, like, try to play into that but, like, that's obviously, like a different game. So that. But as far as you're saying, like, the leverage in the system, like, I don't know how much leverage there really can be left in this thing. Like, I mean, we've kind of carted out almost everybody.
00:19:35.776 - 00:19:56.688, Speaker E: Like, I get that. Like, yeah, there's always somebody left to liquidate, but I tend to be of the assumption that, like, most of that pain is worked through. I mean, the fact that we haven't gone lower and there hasn't been material liquidation still for a bit now helps that argument, but, yeah, I think we're fairly delevered as far as history goes.
00:19:56.816 - 00:20:21.432, Speaker C: Yeah. Can I ask you guys internally without necessarily commenting on any one counterparty? I mean, how much were you guys paying attention to leverage in CFI, in crypto before this? Was there kind of like an internal, like, yeah, we like some of these firms, but we're not really sure. We don't really understand the risk management, or it doesn't seem like there's enough capital base to support some of the risks that they're taking. Or was this, like, a huge surprise to you guys that kind of caught you off guard?
00:20:21.568 - 00:21:06.362, Speaker E: I mean, we don't lend out like, we're net borrowers, so, like, I guess, like, I'm less concerned. Like, if I, like, looked at, like, I mean, we were investors in blockfi, so, like, we ate money there, but, like, I wouldn't, like. And we borrowed from them, so I never, like, looked at them and I was like, oh, this is a credit concern because, like, the risk was the other way. So, like, that was, like, generally, like, my advantage point on it. As far as, like, counterparties go, though. Like, I didn't think that there was as much leverage being given to people in the market as there was, which kind of, to be honest, leads me to believe that there was some fraud going on in some of the, like, information that was, like, being given, because, like, I just, like, I don't think people were that ridiculous on the lending side. That's my take on the whole thing.
00:21:06.518 - 00:21:09.090, Speaker D: Yeah, I'm with, I'm with. I'm with Dan there.
00:21:09.202 - 00:21:12.154, Speaker B: Wait, Dan, can you explain. Can you expand on that or explain that?
00:21:12.274 - 00:21:13.674, Speaker E: Which. Which part of it?
00:21:13.834 - 00:21:19.602, Speaker B: There was maybe, like, just not enough information in the system or what folks were saying isn't actually what was happening?
00:21:19.658 - 00:21:32.618, Speaker E: No, I think they were. I think they were lying. I think there was information being provided. It was just false. Yeah, I think that was like, I think that was, like, how it got so squirrely but yeah, look, I mean, like, either way, it's two sided. Like, even. Even so with the information, like, maybe not.
00:21:32.618 - 00:22:21.326, Speaker E: Like, it's still, like, there's a diligence that has to be done. And clearly, the amount of leverage that was being extended was too high at periods. To be fair. When we're looking at leverage and market impact and what it matters, we're looking at most of the liquid CFI instruments, the exchanges, that's import perpetuals and futures. That's generally where we're looking for the levels of fraud, because you don't have a ton of visibility into the OTC markets on the lending side, you can get quoted on rates and stuff like that and get an idea. A lot of that's just being armed against what you're seeing on the exchange side anyway. So, like that, we were not surprised, but that was not something we were actively monitoring to get an idea of what the froth was in the market as opposed to what you're seeing happen in perpetuals and sort of fixed tenor futures.
00:22:21.326 - 00:22:23.406, Speaker E: That was more the heuristic we look at.
00:22:23.510 - 00:23:32.754, Speaker D: Yeah, I think it's one of those things that it basically doesn't matter as much until it really matters is what's happening. I do think that the unwind from all these guys is definitely very net detrimental in the sense that a ton of retail just got burned. And so it's very unlikely to see them come back super quickly into the market. When I look at crypto market structure, when I look at DeFi and when I look at CeFi, you look at a Celsius, a voyager, all these guys that doled out these massive, massive loans, basically what they were, what they were doing is because of their relationship with the people that they were lending to and they were loaning to, the person would come in and they'd say, hey, give us a little bit more time to post up collateral, give us an extra two days, give us an extra three days. And I think the vast majority of time, that's actually okay. 85% of the time that happens, that's okay. And then 15% of the time, shit hits the fan and you get something like a, like a three arrow situation, you know, and where stuff just completely, completely unwinds.
00:23:32.754 - 00:23:57.904, Speaker D: And so I think, you know, one. One big, uh, thing here is most people don't pay attention because it doesn't really necessarily matter day to day, but it only matters. It matters, you know, it has an outsized impact in short moments of time. Right. And so when you have. When you have market stress is kind of when you need to be paying attention to that stuff. And I think crypto has a bunch of swords hanging over its head.
00:23:57.904 - 00:24:40.704, Speaker D: That was one of them. I think that a bunch of risk teams, they're probably going to have to be cleaned out, and you're probably going to see a lot stricter limits on what people can take and what people can do. I think net net, the ecosystem comes out fine. But I do think one thing that I want to point out is that Defi did remarkably well during this downturn. You didnt really have bad debt created. And thats the trade off of Defi, in a nutshell, is you basically get slightly larger volatility day to day, and then less crazy volume event happen. You get more day to day liquidations because you cant call up Aave and say, hey, dont liquidate me, please give me another two days.
00:24:40.704 - 00:25:25.514, Speaker D: But you dont get those ridiculous blow ups that leave holes because of that. Theres a trade off there. And I bring it up for one point, and it's, that point has been resonating pretty heavily, I think, with a lot of people in the more traditional circles, at least the ones that I've talked to, they seem to really like that point. And I think it speaks to the robustness of what crypto can build. And then if you can have systems that do that and then also build out systems that look like the stuff that exists in TradfI and you do it all in crypto, suddenly have a pretty cool and robust ecosystem, which I think is dope, but it's definitely, the centralized stuff is definitely one big trade off involved, in my opinion.
00:25:27.814 - 00:26:25.506, Speaker C: Do you think this implosion of CFI, even right now there's an SEC probe being issued to Coinbase? There's a lot of skepticism around CFI, even the biggest, most blue chip participants there. Do you think? And combining that with the fact that we know there's still a lot of capital sitting on the sidelines right now, like Andreessen raised whatever their $4 billion fund or whatever, and I know theyre deploying, but theres no way theyve had time to even do a meaningful dent in that amount of money. So do you kind of see this narrative? Because ive been kind of hearing the same thing, Avi. All right, CFI kind of failed us. Now its important to put some of this important financial infrastructure on chain. So do you see kind of this next wave of investment or next wave of institutional adoption, kind of like investing in that kind of native on chain infrastructure or do you see more limitation with what that can ultimately do? Because at the end of the day, one of the reasons these protocols, like the obvious and compounds perform is it was just over collateralized. Right.
00:26:25.506 - 00:26:41.484, Speaker C: And I still think we do need to solve under collateralized lending here in some sense, even the defi form. So I guess that's my question. You see a big catalyst kind of behind DeFi because it's been, at least from token price standpoint, it's been a poor performer for like, over a year, I mean, even before this bear market started.
00:26:42.384 - 00:27:24.314, Speaker D: It's a good question. I think the way that I would think about it is more that it provides a good base to jump off of, but it's not necessarily a catalyst right now. It's not something that's going to bring in a ton of money right now. But what it does is it basically validates the product so that when the market turns, it probably performs really well off the bottom is the way that I would think about it. But I don't necessarily think that it brings in a ton of capital right now, because the people that are. I'll tell you why. The people that are impressed by that are pretty slow movers and the people that would want to take a look at DeFi protocols because of all this stuff, I think they're moving pretty slowly on the Andreessen point.
00:27:24.314 - 00:27:42.260, Speaker D: I don't know, man. Maybe that's why uni's been outperforming. Maybe that's why Lido's going up. Maybe they're buying their bags. Maybe the next trade is just buy everything that Andreessen has yet to buy and short ETH against it. I don't know. You tell me, Dan.
00:27:42.260 - 00:27:43.784, Speaker D: You're the king of pear trades.
00:27:45.564 - 00:28:13.940, Speaker E: I mean, those things against Eid has been a one way trick. It's a pain. But uni, I did hear was raising around, so I think there's some truth in that leaking into the market. So that could be all that's going on there. But, like, in terms of the defi stuff, like, the problem you have, like, with c five dying and, like, you're performing well is like, you're still just like, looking out. It's like a wasteland and it's like, all right, like, sick. So, like, you're standing, but, like, there's, like, all your customers are effectively, like, dead from, like, other reasons.
00:28:13.940 - 00:29:03.096, Speaker E: So I think, like, the problem is, like, yeah, like, this will matter and it, like, will turn and it'll turn higher, but, like, it's like, all right, you're standing in the best position in a great, I mean, the greatest position to be in for a market that is somewhat obliterated. So I think that's like the bigger problem on it. It'll be fine when it turns and I think it helps. There was a real argument being thrown around of defi is useless because it's over collateralized and this will never catch on. And I think that is getting put to bed a little bit because you're like, no, there's a chunk of the market that wants this, that doesn't want the exposure that we just went through. I think that's where you're seeing the market sort of justifying like its existence and like why this matters and like why this is like going to be a thing first. Just like, oh, this is like a shittier version of like what the bilateral lenders can do.
00:29:03.096 - 00:29:46.454, Speaker E: Like, I think there's like a product market fit there that's like justified on the back of this or that people can like definitely see too. So I think the big thing you're going to see on the c five side is like, I don't think like the bilateral lenders are going anywhere. I think the ones that like remain will be like bigger and stronger and like, yeah, like we'll be at new levels and like call it two years or whatever it takes to like build this back up. I think, like, open term retail lending is dead and like probably should have never been a thing anyway because like you're just too subject to these bank run problems. Like, I think you're going to see only fixed term lending available to retail. Like going forward, people will do it again but it won't work out again. But I think, like, people who are like smart and are like looking to like stick this thing out, like, I think that's the only way you're going to be able to do it.
00:29:46.454 - 00:30:00.588, Speaker E: Like the exchanges can do the open term thing because it's just a book that ends up matching up. But if you're trying to really match a lending book, you can't have the most skittish chunk of the market, the ability to withdraw all their money at any given time. It just doesn't work.
00:30:00.716 - 00:30:12.784, Speaker B: So Dan, you think this just ends up as a consolidation of the big centralized exchanges like Binance and FTX? And I think you tweeted this out, Coinbase and Kraken, they end up just absorbing all of these smaller C five companies.
00:30:13.164 - 00:31:07.658, Speaker E: Yeah, but Coinbase hasn't done anything which I find super surprising. Like, they have a ton. They should be using this as the same opportunity that you're seeing the other centralized venues. I think there's certain people who are really taking advantage of this, FTX being the obvious one. And I think finance is probably doing the same thing just close to Asia and I don't see it as much, but this should really be a time where you're, look, if you have a lot of cash sitting around and you are in a strong position, you should be using this to expand because, like, the people that come out of the backside of this bigger, like, there's been a lack of consolidation in the market amongst the C five participants for the last like two or three years because we had a raging bull market and like, everybody was like doing okay and well. Like, there wasn't like a lot of impetus to like get like mergers and sort of companies sold. Like, that should be happening really quickly now and you have a window and like, I think there's certain exchanges of being very smart about it and like, I think the other ones will like, catch up.
00:31:07.658 - 00:31:33.894, Speaker E: Like, I don't know, I expect there to be more consolidation coming out of the back of this and those players being stronger. Like, I think this idea that like, we just keep launching like, new exchanges every six months and like, they like, go through phases, like, is somewhat game behind us. I gotta. You're gonna see some stickiness in it going forward unless like regulators come in and just like body everybody again or something like that. But like absent, like any, like real regime change there. Like, you should see strength, like consolidating like, the players. That's like, my opinion of it, at least.
00:31:34.354 - 00:32:27.848, Speaker C: Where do you see, okay, so if there's consolidation and let's say increased regulation on like, c five players, like, what does the role of Defi look like in that environment, how does that change? Because one thing that, I mean, I just, like, we kind of started to talk about this with, like, where's adoption going to come from? Is it going to come from like, gaming and nfts or is it going to come from Defi? I feel like at least in my, like, my working theory is that it's not going to be defi. This, like, open, permissionless, like, democratization of finance narrative. Like, doesn't make a lot of sense to me. Like, even if you look at, even if you look at a simple, like, borrow lend protocol, like Aave, I bet like, most of the retail participants, like, didn't really fully understand, um, how it all worked. And then if you looked at a lot of, like, the late stage of this bull cycle, like, a lot of the DeFi products that were getting launched, these are like complicated products, right? Like, even like all the options, vaults and everything. I think they're super cool. But I think, uh, probably a lot of retail, like, doesn't really understand, like, these feel like products that are made for institutions.
00:32:27.848 - 00:32:49.580, Speaker C: So I guess if like, the working theory is that c five is going to consolidate and get more regulated, like, who are the users of Defi in that scenario? And do you see it as this, like this one narrative? Like people are going to adopt it and people are going to learn more about finance, and it's going to be this way to provide access to financial products for people that didn't have it before? Or do you see it as something else? Like another place in the market that feels more institutional?
00:32:49.692 - 00:33:01.024, Speaker E: But that should be an opportunity for somebody, right? Somebody should be able to skin these things and make them better retail products. I mean, they're open protocols. That's the whole point. So if the UI and the experience is terrible, that's an opportunity for somebody to fix.
00:33:01.324 - 00:33:51.520, Speaker D: Yeah. I think one of the most interesting things about DeFi, honestly, is the fact that it is all open source, which I think inevitably means that you get better competitors out there. If you have the ability to copy and fork and push a new company overnight, then what you get is you get better products. That's the beauty of DeFi to me is somebody can go spin up what is essentially competitor to the New York Stock Exchange in 15 minutes by forking the Uniswap code. That's the sick part. I think every day you interact with money, I just think that in the future, that's just going to be on Defi. I do think that you're right that there's probably going to be some sort of bifurcation in system at some point in the future.
00:33:51.520 - 00:34:39.674, Speaker D: Institutions are going to want KYC just because they have to comply with regulation. But that doesn't necessarily mean that everything has to be KYC. You can have a version of Aave that's KyC'd, you can have a version of Aave that isn't Kyc'd. I think that what you're probably going to see is you're probably going to see a little bit of a Trojan horse effect where people come in under the KYC lens, and then what ends up happening is that it actually just normalizes the use of DeFi protocols in general, and then it just blows open. But I think the crux of it is that from my perspective on DeFi, at least. DeFi is just a better version of the traditional financial rails. And so it's more modular, it's easier, it's easier to build, it's easier to compete in.
00:34:39.674 - 00:35:37.394, Speaker D: I think you just end up with better products. And so I think that what's going to end up happening is that you will end up attracting the institution through a bunch of different KYC products. But there's no reason why an individual, if they wanted a loan, wouldn't go to Aave. I think at some point in the future, you're going to be able, if you want to get an under collateralized loan, to sign a legal contract using Aave and get an under collateralized loan instead of going to a SoFi. Maybe you're going to a maple in the future, and maybe that process is a little bit better. I think DeFi is just, the sexy thing was just the yields, and I think that definitely attracted a ton of people. But the reality is that DeFi is a deeply unsexy product.
00:35:37.394 - 00:35:43.454, Speaker D: It's just better financial rails. But that is actually very valuable, in my opinion.
00:35:45.334 - 00:36:57.894, Speaker C: How do you guys think about one of the issues in DeFi? I'm not sure. Just the fact that maybe some of these things, they provide good utility, but they're difficult to invest in. You need the token, for instance, because my understanding is there's a couple of things going that are challenges there. There's a dao that governs. There's some questions, is that really the best way to build and ship a valuable product? But then there's also a regulatory component, and you're kind of seeing this materialize around like the whole fee switch debate, which is if you have this group of people like, let's say, uniswap labs, and they're the sole contributors to, like, building Uniswap, the protocol, and then revenue starts to occur there, then that starts to accrue there. That starts to look a lot like a security, right? So there's this like, funny discussion going on right now around, like, is defi like public goods and we don't really care if the token price appreciates or do we want to find a way to like, have revenue accrued to the, the protocol itself, and then that revenue can get reinvested in better products and services, in which case it starts to look more like a security, right. So I guess that would be, I feel like that's another bare case that the market needs to kind of work through for Defi in general is like, will revenue and cash flows ever accrue to these things? Because right now seems tricky from a regulatory standpoint.
00:36:57.894 - 00:36:59.542, Speaker C: I don't know if you guys have an opinion on that.
00:36:59.638 - 00:37:45.050, Speaker E: I mean, the fact that the tokens have value at all means people think it will inevitably happen. Right. I think that's like the market sort of prediction on it. That being said, like, they're incredibly risky because, like, there's, there's really large unknowns beyond just like, will this work? And people want to use it and, like, there's a second layer of, like, well, even if they do, do you end up actually, like, accruing any value back to the token? I am long term, like, bullish on the idea that they will, but I think we got a while till that becomes, like, okay or clear or, like, somebody's, like, willing to take that risk. So, like, I think you're not going to see it in the short term for sure. Things also, regulatory wise, they haven't gotten any clearer in a while. And I don't think you'll see that until there's a regime change with the current administration.
00:37:45.242 - 00:38:13.628, Speaker D: Yeah, I think to clarify, we're not going to get that anytime soon in the US, but it's so obviously, clearly happening elsewhere. There are protocols that currently give you access to revenues. They exist. They're out there and you're getting paid for it. It just so happens that in the US, you can't really access them. I think at some point, regulators get boxed into a corner if it gets big enough. So I think basically they have two choices.
00:38:13.628 - 00:38:52.324, Speaker D: One is they stop it now, which is possible, or two is in two years, it's so big and so prevalent that they can't really do anything other than to create a regulatory sandbox for it, and to then take that sandbox and turn it into a real law that kind of protects these things because otherwise it'd be just probably harming a tremendous amount of consumers. So I think that's kind of like, it's almost like a now or never, in my opinion. And every day that they wait makes it easier for crypto to survive, which is, I guess, good for us. Right? I mean, as long as. I mean, as long as it doesn't nuke another 70% in the next year, then maybe it's easier. I don't know.
00:38:52.484 - 00:39:15.684, Speaker B: Avi, do you think these protocols that spit off cash flow, it's actually a detriment to them because, like, basically everything in crypto, obviously, actually, every asset anywhere trades on narrative. But when you don't have cash flows, it's really just trading on a narrative. When you do have cash flows, you start trying to create models that value it. It's almost like nfts with utility, right? Like the nfts with utility are worse.
00:39:16.384 - 00:39:22.564, Speaker D: It's my favorite left curve argument. I think it's probably correct. Exactly.
00:39:23.704 - 00:39:29.784, Speaker B: So things with cash flows will do worse because they have no, because you're trying. You can put them on.
00:39:30.484 - 00:40:15.682, Speaker D: I'll tell you guys a funny story. Golden tree, obviously, a lot of the stuff that they do centers around value and fundamental value. And so that lens has kind of creeped in to some of the stuff that we're looking at at crypto, where it's like, okay, can we model this on cash flows, or can we model this on values? On value or revenues or like, anything else, active users, all that kind of stuff. And we had a funny discussion the other day where I kind of both to myself and to the team, reminded everybody that sometimes it just has absolutely nothing to do with price. Like zero. In fact, it can often go the opposite direction. So you kind of just need to remember what market you're trading and that.
00:40:15.682 - 00:40:20.704, Speaker D: I mean, have any of you guys looked at the market cap of Celsius recently? The cell token?
00:40:20.874 - 00:40:22.584, Speaker B: It's probably higher than it should be.
00:40:22.884 - 00:40:24.344, Speaker D: It's 400 million.
00:40:26.284 - 00:40:29.224, Speaker E: That's crazy. Well, because it's all locked.
00:40:30.004 - 00:40:47.636, Speaker D: You know how many people went bankrupt shorting that thing? Too many. Like, way too many. It's like, absurd. You're paying like 10% a day to be short this thing. It goes bankrupt and then it doubles. Like, in what world? In this one. In the crypto one.
00:40:47.636 - 00:40:50.100, Speaker D: Right. That's actually a great trade, by the way.
00:40:50.132 - 00:40:51.798, Speaker E: You got the bad news behind you.
00:40:51.956 - 00:40:55.454, Speaker D: Yeah. It's like buying, buying. That was a great trade.
00:40:56.154 - 00:40:58.442, Speaker E: Yeah. And you got paid the whole way through it to hold it.
00:40:58.578 - 00:41:00.362, Speaker D: It's totally absurd.
00:41:00.498 - 00:41:00.698, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:41:00.706 - 00:41:21.434, Speaker B: I feel like these traditional models might actually, they might bring in more institutions. Like the golden trees, obviously. Like golden tree. You know, the managers of the managers love to put models around these things, but in a funny way, that kind of limits the reflexive upside of the assets that have the models on them. So it actually hurts the assets that the institutions are investing in.
00:41:22.094 - 00:41:23.046, Speaker E: We'll see.
00:41:23.230 - 00:41:49.628, Speaker C: How do you guys think about, like, um, do you ever see anything that looks like a good product but bad token? So maybe like an optimism or something like that, where maybe you believe in, like you were saying, obviously, like there's some potential in L2s, but it's just super low float, really high you know, fully diluted value, and it just makes it more difficult to invest. Like, take a long term view on it. Uh, do you guys have thoughts on, like, you know, any situations that kind of look like maybe like some of the Solana ecosystem tokens as well? Like, there was that kind of same problem.
00:41:49.796 - 00:41:52.028, Speaker D: Yeah, Dan, you're actually talking about this in some.
00:41:52.156 - 00:41:52.868, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:41:53.036 - 00:41:58.300, Speaker D: Chat that we were in about the short hunting. I think that was you, right?
00:41:58.412 - 00:42:25.022, Speaker E: Yeah. So there's two problems that come up with these, like, situations for most people. One is, like, look, like, it's hard to, like, put them in for, like, long term positions, right? Because you're like, this supply is just going to come online. Like, this thing should, like, reset lower. Like, it's like, it's neutral rate of, like, if the supplier out there is, like, materially lower. But the counter to that is like, all right, because there's so low float of it. Like, it's super subject to, like, quick shocks to the upside.
00:42:25.022 - 00:42:51.394, Speaker E: Right. There's just, like, not a lot of supply that's, like, out there. So, like, people find themselves a lot of times, like, caught in these things where, like, they go short them. There's no supply. And, like, people will just run it up for, like, whatever reason. Either it's organic or they're purposely just trying to, like, squeeze it. And you just get bodied because they move so quickly because there's so little supply and there's nothing to tether it back down to reality with any supply in any short timeframe that you end up getting caught.
00:42:51.394 - 00:43:12.552, Speaker E: So it's one of these situations where I feel like people look at this and they're like, I have to do something. And the reality is you should just do nothing. You shouldn't sit there and be like, oh, it has to go down. I'm going to be a hero here and sell it short. Or you shouldn't look at it and be like, well, somebody might, like, run it up for a squeeze. Like, you really should just leave it alone. And you should just be like, I'm gonna put a pin in this thing for the future.
00:43:12.552 - 00:43:47.002, Speaker E: Like, where the supply is much more, like, higher and like, it's at a much more steady state. And then I can make a decision, like, from there. But, like, these really, really low float tokens out there are super subject to these, like, shocks to the upside. And you gotta, like, really, I don't know. It's a way to get bodied very quickly that you probably don't even think about a lot of times or at least some people don't. And you see a lot of times also when like, new coins will get issued and like, either the supply is very hard to access or it's like on like a fairly, like, quickly scheduled, but like, it's not like, sort of like out there for day one. Like selling assets.
00:43:47.002 - 00:44:16.686, Speaker E: Like when, like the perp just lists is like, super dangerous. Like, there's just like, not as much of like this. Even if the supply is, like, out there, it's like not in the hands of people who could like, readily, like, move it or act on it or anything like that. So I don't know. I think this is like, also why you see such crazy fireworks, like on new listings and stuff like that too, where people are like, this is irrational. And it's like, who could possibly be buying this? And it's like, well, like, the bigger issue is that, like, nobody can sell it. So I think people forget that, like, on the very, very low float stuff at times.
00:44:16.686 - 00:44:26.870, Speaker E: But yeah, I don't know, that's like, sort of. I think in general though, like, you just like, don't want to do anything. I think, like, there's enough like other stuff in the world that you don't have to like, take a shot at that.
00:44:26.982 - 00:44:40.932, Speaker B: When you stop having these, when you stop when, when there's no retail to dump the low flow tokens on. What happens to the low flow tokens? Like, do VC's end up just scooping these up at massive discounts in the heart of the bear or what happens with them?
00:44:41.108 - 00:45:35.538, Speaker D: I actually think VC's are kind of like the ones that are getting f'ed in this transaction in a way, like at this point in the cycle because the private market valuations haven't actually caught up with the public market valuations. And so I think that I'm seeing a lot, I'm personally seeing a lot of rounds go through that I would price like at a 50% discount when they actually start trading just because nobody wants to buy this stuff. I mean, you look at all the recent listings other than this tiny little shitcoin that people have been talking about that's on arbitrum. I guess it's up two x in the last day and everybody's really excited about it. But that's the only thing that I've seen in the last three months. It's up on listing. It's kind of, it's like such a shitty environment, I think right now because you've got these mega funds that have a mandate to deploy and they're just going to, they're just going to keep deploying but then there's, there's nobody to sell it to, right.
00:45:35.538 - 00:46:30.138, Speaker D: And nobody wants to buy it because you've kind of overpaid for something that, I mean, it's funny, I was, um, I was talking to a buddy who just does like normal VC investing, not crypto VC investing. And pre product stuff generally goes for like three to 5 million and pre product stuff in crypto goes for like 40. And so its actually people like me and Dan who have cash and are liquid and are hunting in the liquid markets that I think make out like a bandit where I can buy stuff on binance after it lists at half the price at a VC. I mean if you look at a ton of tokens out there, they traded at VC price like VC rounds. So its actually great and theres no lockup on it. So you get to just go out there and buy it, which is kind of fun. One thing that you generally see just in terms of investing in general is that you get a lot of different types of products at the absolute worst time.
00:46:30.138 - 00:47:03.034, Speaker D: And what do I mean by that? Well, in 2019, 2020, everybody launched a market neutral fund because that's what worked in 2018. That was the worst time to do that because then crypto went up massively. Now I think everybody's launching a VC fund because that's what worked in the previous cycle. And so the private markets are getting crowded out. And so I actually think now is like the right time for liquid funds finally. So I think, yes, I am talking my book massively, but I also think it's true.
00:47:04.054 - 00:48:04.900, Speaker E: So I'll say it's like the people who made it the most money in the last bear market, whatever, like 2019 period were like people who put really large liquid positions on for things that they like had some thesis on and just like sat on it, right? Like there were a lot of people that did this like Multicore, probably the most, like famously, right? Like they just like bought all the Solana because they just like decided that they were like and helium too. And like they were buying other people's saps, they were buying all the liquid stuff. Like if the bear markets give you the opportunity to basically put like a tremendous amount of size on something that you might not have, would have otherwise, that you like probably have a thesis on or like you should if you're going to do it. But like there, so there is, you do get like this like pocket to like do activity that you like might not have otherwise. The thing is like, you just got to like, accept that you're going to be like in pain for a while, like on this, especially if you're going to like, warehouse that risk. So, yeah, like there, there definitely is like that upside to it is like you get the ability to buy things in size, like discounted and wait on it. So that does, like, that is the good thing.
00:48:04.900 - 00:48:15.494, Speaker E: But hopefully when it turns, like, it turns materially for you. But I think that was like the people who really like, made all the real money in the last cycle where people would put the stuff on earlier, I thought.
00:48:15.534 - 00:48:56.572, Speaker C: Did you guys see, I mean, we were kind of chatting about this before we got on, but the Lido sale, right? This was dragonfly reading, dragonfly leading. Like it was like a $20 million sale or something like that. They were going to take ten of it down. I mean, one thing that like, you know, the downside, right, of these, these liquid markets for even like pretty large cap tokens, relatively, is that there's just a really low amount of liquidity for these things. So even a relatively small buy can move the price pretty materially. And then if you combine that with dow treasuries, they didnt move fast enough to move into stables and its like 83% of assets in Dow treasuries are still in their native token or they have one asset. There are these crazy statistics.
00:48:56.572 - 00:49:18.904, Speaker C: Do you guys see that? Its a big opportunity for VC going forward, because on the one hand, these daos, they need to diversify their treasury. They want to get out of their native token. And to your point, they're pretty attractive liquid valuations out there for the lido's or DyDX's or maples or whatever it is. Do you guys see that as a big opportunity for VC's going forward?
00:49:19.484 - 00:49:20.772, Speaker D: Hey, can you hear me?
00:49:20.948 - 00:49:22.064, Speaker E: I can hear you.
00:49:22.404 - 00:49:24.548, Speaker D: It's just us now, I think it's.
00:49:24.556 - 00:49:25.904, Speaker E: Just you and me. We love them.
00:49:26.604 - 00:49:32.772, Speaker D: Yeah, just the psychos now. Inmates are running the place now.
00:49:32.788 - 00:49:36.948, Speaker E: We can talk about whatever we want. I think they have to. They won't even know he said it. Yeah.
00:49:37.036 - 00:49:38.704, Speaker D: All right. What are we punting?
00:49:39.284 - 00:49:41.220, Speaker E: You see that helium hit piece this morning?
00:49:41.372 - 00:49:43.384, Speaker D: No, I didn't. What was it?
00:49:44.764 - 00:49:58.644, Speaker E: This guy who like, just hates crypto and writes threads, but the odd lots guys, like, we're talking about it. He like, basically was like, helium collected $6,000 in fees last year. Like, why is it worth anything? And like, went on this whole, like, it's really a very long thread.
00:49:58.764 - 00:50:10.506, Speaker D: Oh, wow. Yeah, I got, I got to read that. I mean, if it actually only collected $6,000 in fees, I mean, that's, like, kind of. Kind of bad. You'd expect it to do more, I guess. I haven't actually looked at it in a while. It's like.
00:50:10.506 - 00:50:17.314, Speaker D: It's funny. Helium is kind of that thing that's like catnip. It's like catnip for, like, people.
00:50:17.434 - 00:50:17.970, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:50:18.082 - 00:50:18.626, Speaker D: Like, there.
00:50:18.690 - 00:50:31.606, Speaker E: People love that you get a physical thing. Like, seriously, everyone that I know that's, like, a normal person that I, like, talk to them about it. They're like, oh, I got to get one of those. Like. And they, like, set it up in the house. They're like, I'm telling you, like, people love that idea.
00:50:31.730 - 00:50:35.334, Speaker D: That's probably. I mean, that's honestly probably why Solana came out with their phone, right?
00:50:35.454 - 00:50:37.758, Speaker E: Yeah. People, I got.
00:50:37.846 - 00:50:39.470, Speaker B: We both. Yeah, I told Dan.
00:50:39.502 - 00:50:39.862, Speaker E: I told you.
00:50:39.878 - 00:50:46.714, Speaker B: We just moved into this office. We got completely rugged by our Wi Fi both. It's still shit in the bed, so we can. We can wrap this one up.
00:50:47.054 - 00:50:50.134, Speaker D: No worries. We were just jamming it.
00:50:50.294 - 00:50:50.646, Speaker E: You can.
00:50:50.670 - 00:50:52.238, Speaker D: You can take this. You can take this recording.
00:50:52.286 - 00:50:52.678, Speaker E: Exactly.
00:50:52.726 - 00:51:01.254, Speaker B: Perfect. Perfect. This is the highlight. It's probably you guys talking. Anyways, guys, we'll wrap it because my Wi Fi is totally shit. But Dan and Avi, this is great. Appreciate the time, guys.
00:51:01.254 - 00:51:03.494, Speaker B: And, yeah, we'll have you guys on soon again.
00:51:03.654 - 00:51:06.502, Speaker D: All right, take care. All right.
00:51:06.598 - 00:51:10.114, Speaker A: The outtakes, the outro here, man, we got rugged.
00:51:10.414 - 00:51:12.558, Speaker C: Well, director's cut edition here. Yeah, we did.
00:51:12.606 - 00:51:13.674, Speaker A: We got really hard.
00:51:14.054 - 00:51:15.446, Speaker C: I know. What are you gonna do?
00:51:15.510 - 00:51:15.774, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:51:15.814 - 00:51:18.846, Speaker C: All right, well, the people are just gonna have to make do with the two of us, I guess, then.
00:51:18.990 - 00:51:23.742, Speaker A: Real unfortunate for the people, then. So, anyways, what'd you think any. What stood out to you in the episode?
00:51:23.838 - 00:51:24.782, Speaker D: Yeah, I thought it was great.
00:51:24.838 - 00:51:35.070, Speaker C: I love talking to those guys. They're so measured. I almost wish they'd come out and been like, this is what's happening. But they're too smart to do that. They didn't fall for my trick in the beginning. I haven't seen the worst of it yet. Neither one of them answered.
00:51:35.102 - 00:51:35.710, Speaker E: Where's the bottom?
00:51:35.782 - 00:51:36.494, Speaker A: Where's the bottom?
00:51:36.534 - 00:51:37.366, Speaker E: Where's the bottom?
00:51:37.430 - 00:51:37.678, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:51:37.726 - 00:52:04.788, Speaker C: Like, yeah, yeah, no, I know, but, like, where is it? Like, come on. No, I really like both their frameworks. I think to call out two things in the beginning, I thought Avi's point, where the large caps were extremely correlated with, basically the Nasdaq. So it's bitcoin, especially, just trades in lockstep with QQQ. That was well taken. So basically, I thought his advice was really good. If you're a long term investor, just kind of sit on your hands and close your eyes.
00:52:04.788 - 00:52:35.626, Speaker C: If you're a trader, you're going to have to move out into some of the further out reaches of crypto where there's some dispersion. I think that was good advice for both folks. I really like Dan's framework for the merge in general. And the reason that I like and the heuristic that he's using is how bitcoin trades around happenings. And the reason I like it is because I think a lot of people will lose money on it, and that's what markets like to do. Right. It's like it kind of runs up, right? Everyone says, buy the rumor, sell the news, but it runs up.
00:52:35.626 - 00:53:01.074, Speaker C: People lose their conviction. They buy the top, then it sells off, then they're like, shit, and then it will finally, steadily churn up, and people won't believe it. So if the, if your framework is markets will do the thing that causes the most people to lose the most money, then I'd say dance pretty spot on, and that's probably what's going to happen with the merge. Um, what did you think about that point that he made, too, where it's like, markets are for more forward looking and they'll, they react before you see pain in the real economy?
00:53:01.194 - 00:53:26.406, Speaker A: Because I love that. Yeah, that was one of my favorite points that he said. It's, um, it's, it's really interesting because when you go on, on Twitter, not just crypto Twitter, you go on Twitter, there's, like, doom and gloom. It feels like the last, like, two months, there's been so much pain. But then you look out into the real world, you hang out with non crypto friends, you, like, look out into the, into just different companies. What's going on? You're, like, just starting to see pain. Like, you're just starting to see layoffs.
00:53:26.406 - 00:53:47.558, Speaker A: You're starting to see, like, people maybe take a couple days less on their vacation because they don't want to spend as much, like, the, you don't spend as much money on, like, birthday gifts. Like, you're, like, just starting to see that. And people are just, I think, waking up to the fact that a recession is coming, whereas on a crypto twitter and just, like, stock twitter, uh, and, like, fintwit, I feel like people have been talking about that for, for months.
00:53:47.606 - 00:53:47.766, Speaker B: Right.
00:53:47.790 - 00:54:02.806, Speaker A: And so dan's point about, like, there's this three to six month lag between the bottom of markets and then, like, when it hits the real world. I like that. That was a really good way to, to, just to put a framework around that. I like that. What'd you think?
00:54:02.910 - 00:54:27.536, Speaker C: Yeah, I had the exact same thought. Because, yeah, if you just tuned in and paid attention to media or looked at crypto, Twitter in general, you would see that there was a lot of, a lot of pain and prices have responded to that. But I haven't really seen that in my real life, you know, so to speak. Like, there hasn't been an enormous amount of pain. And obviously, at the end of the day, no one has a macro crystal ball. Right. I would say we talked about this at the off site.
00:54:27.536 - 00:54:48.456, Speaker C: Like, a lot of people talk with a lot of authority. Like, either this is all going to be fine or we're headed to the next Great Depression. I just, just, plus one, the idea that nobody knows for sure, despite how authoritatively people talk about it, but I haven't really seen any kind of response about that out in the real world. So I like the framework that they laid out there, but, which is interesting.
00:54:48.640 - 00:55:09.916, Speaker A: So what's happening right now is like the, you know, we've been at this like, the market's been tanking for months. You're just starting to see it in the real world. What if you like, extend this out maybe four or five months from now? What you're going to have is like, maybe the market's coming back, but the, but, but you're in like Max pain in the real world. It's an interesting, like lag time, I think. I haven't thought about it like that.
00:55:10.060 - 00:55:24.624, Speaker C: Here's another one that I, I probably should just do more homework in. And it's, it's, it's hard to figure out how to get involved. Here, play this. Like, if you think about. Because I'm not a trader, right. I love listening to traders, but I don't trade because I get my face ripped off. Don't say, don't say it.
00:55:24.624 - 00:56:05.766, Speaker C: Don't have the disposition for it. I don't have the disposition, you know, I prefer to lose money the old fashioned way, just holding it all the way to zero. But I thought the emphasis that they had on the l two s as an ecosystem I thought was cool because there is a lot of work being done there. I haven't worked out my own mental framework with. Do I think apps are going to launch on l two s in general or do I think they're going to launch their own app specific chains. I don't know if you have thoughts about that, but probably both, I guess, would be the answer. And it seems like there's a lot of, there are some games being played, maybe at the, I don't know if y'all follow Sisyphus, the account, but he's, he's pretty good.
00:56:05.766 - 00:56:12.614, Speaker C: And he's, he's called out some, some funny games or shenanigans that are happening in those l two ecosystems. But, um, I don't know. What do you think?
00:56:12.654 - 00:57:11.104, Speaker A: Well, I mean, speaking, speaking of Sisyphus, I think Sisyphus has some points that also Dan and Avi made similar points about, like if people previously, like, let's say a year ago, were under indexed on the macro, now they're probably over indexed on the macro. Like everybody cares about the macro right now. And if you read and you're probably like a little too over indexed on it, actually, like every crypto podcast you get on there, it's like, first couple of questions, like, all right, like, how does the macro tie into crypto? I think probably people are probably a little too over indexed on it, and also probably a little too, like, short term, short term thinking. And like, Howard Marks just had this piece, and in the roundup we talked about it with Santiago, but Marx basically says there's really no point thinking about the short term because even if you can nail the short term, you can't adjust your portfolio fast enough to actually make an impact. So he's like, there's no point thinking about three months from now. You really need to think about like six to twelve months from now. So, yeah, there was something else in there that I thought was interesting, which was open.
00:57:11.104 - 00:57:45.344, Speaker A: Like, I think it was Dan who said open term retail lending is dead and should be dead. And I thought that was a really interesting point. And I think what he said is only fixed term lending, only fixed term retail lending will exist. And that it'll kind of get gobbled up by the big exchanges like the Coinbases, FTXs. And so it's like, I don't know, it's an interesting way to think about it. Like the blockfi's and Celsius of the world, there's not going to be another blockfi, really. It's just going to be like, because that model was broken, because as Dan said it, it causes these bank runs.
00:57:45.344 - 00:57:46.568, Speaker A: That was a good point.
00:57:46.616 - 00:58:25.348, Speaker C: I would agree with you. I think overall, one of the biggest things that doesn't exist yet, and this is actually happening. So maybe there is the c five component to this and the coinbase or the FTX is offer this. This is also being worked on, on the defi side of things with fixed interest rate protocols like volts, if you've heard of them, they, you know, if you look at in tradfi, one of the largest markets that exists is interest rate swaps. And those are, those are fixed interest rate swaps typically. And it's a. I mean, depending on where you look at the size of the market, it's like a $400 billion to a one quid quadrillion dollar a year market is OTC derivatives.
00:58:25.396 - 00:58:26.628, Speaker A: What is a quadrillion?
00:58:26.756 - 00:58:27.044, Speaker E: It's.
00:58:27.084 - 00:58:29.100, Speaker C: It's enormous. It's, it's really, it's really.
00:58:29.172 - 00:58:29.700, Speaker A: It's very.
00:58:29.772 - 00:58:30.756, Speaker C: I mean, institutional.
00:58:30.780 - 00:58:31.076, Speaker E: It's.
00:58:31.140 - 00:58:52.792, Speaker C: It's basically. I mean, you can think about it as there's like a couple of different things that happen there, which is one, there's risk management. And I would assume that's largely like corporates, not like trying to hedge out FX risk. There's speculators and then there's. And this is the, this is the point that builds on what Dan was saying is there's like structured retail products that get built on the, the underlying.
00:58:52.888 - 00:58:53.096, Speaker E: Right.
00:58:53.120 - 00:59:24.480, Speaker C: So if you think about a, like, if you ask the average, uh, person who walks on the street like, oh, what's a 30 year swap? They, they have no idea what that means, but everyone knows what a 30 year mortgage is, right? So there are these kind of like base building blocks that get, that get built and then that, that ladders up to these more structured retail products. So I agree with you. I mean, I think, like, you and I talked about this, too. I think one of the way that c five versus defi ends up going is there's consolidation in the CFI space and they end up getting more regulated and they kind of end up looking something like banks, probably, I think.
00:59:24.552 - 01:00:04.056, Speaker A: I mean, just the last closing thought and then we can wrap this up is, I forget if this was actually during the recording or before we hit record. But Dan, we're like, how are you doing? What are you doing these days, Dan? It's like, uh, we're, we're building better tech. We're like fixing things internally. And I just like empathize with that so much. And people, people always say it's like, when we're going into this bear market, it's like, oh, you, you know, you, you buy in the bull. You like build in the bear or whatever it is. And like, the best things get built in these bear markets, these like, one liners that it's like, okay, but like, what does that really mean? And through some of these conversations, and again, I forget if this was on the recording or before if we hit record, but it's like, that's literally what people do in these markets.
01:00:04.056 - 01:00:17.960, Speaker A: It's like, all right, we finally have time to slow down. Dan's like, we're not as active right now. We're slowing things down and we're, and we're actually getting our systems right so that we can spend twelve months prepping, getting our systems right for the next bull market, which will be colossally bigger than the last one.
01:00:17.992 - 01:00:58.086, Speaker C: So, yeah, if folks haven't, you know, if you're listening to this, maybe if you're not actually in crypto, but you're just kind of watching. I mean, it's really difficult to lay the good foundation of good business practices when you're hiring as quickly as you, as you do when you're growing. Right? Like when revenue is growing, you know, ten x and you're trying to hire, you know, for more people than you currently have. No one's, like, really kind of laser focused on those things, like building good business processes, like talking to your customers and understanding value propositions, and like, actually shipping good products and services, because everything's just kind of working. You need to grow so fast. Then we've all just like, hit a wall. And now this is when, um, this is when most of the innovation happens, I think across all industries, I'd venture, but certainly in crypto, so I agree with that.
01:00:58.180 - 01:00:59.138, Speaker A: I agree with that takeaway.
01:00:59.186 - 01:00:59.722, Speaker D: Yeah.
01:00:59.858 - 01:01:00.330, Speaker E: Very good.
01:01:00.362 - 01:01:03.378, Speaker A: Should we wrap it? I think this director's cut has been a.
01:01:03.506 - 01:01:06.178, Speaker C: Let's wrap it. Yeah, I think that was good.
01:01:06.266 - 01:01:06.698, Speaker E: Yeah.
01:01:06.786 - 01:01:11.450, Speaker C: All right, we'll see. We'll see what the audience thinks. That was a good summation.
01:01:11.522 - 01:01:12.122, Speaker A: All right, buddy.
01:01:12.178 - 01:01:12.690, Speaker E: All right, buddy.
01:01:12.722 - 01:01:21.138, Speaker A: Well, enjoy. Enjoy the rest of your day. And we will. We'll see you on Friday for the next weekly roundup. Thanks for listening to empire. See you on the other side.
01:01:21.226 - 01:01:34.274, Speaker C: Cheers. Subscribe.
