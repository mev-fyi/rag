00:00:00.320 - 00:00:11.097, Speaker A: For me, this is just an inevitable thing, that the biggest brand in crypto was going to make their own chain. The industry doesn't make sense if you can't build an app and keep the value. Like, yeah, right.
00:00:11.201 - 00:00:52.155, Speaker B: I think they're going to try and position this as like the Solana on eth, right, where most of the liquidity sits for meme coins for assets. Like a bunch of the probably OG uni LPs will move over. It's definitely an app chain. Nothing set on the Hive Mind is a recommendation to buy or sell securities or tokens. This podcast is strictly for informational purposes only and any views expressed by anyone on the show are solely our own opinions, not financial advice. All right. Hi everyone, and welcome to another episode of the Hive Mind podcast.
00:00:52.155 - 00:01:52.623, Speaker B: Today with us, we have the usual gang, Myself, Jose Marie Macedou, Jan Lieberman, Duncan AKA Flood Capital, and Ceteris. So news just dropped Unichain, probably the hottest thing on the docket for us to talk about. So, yeah, for a bit of background, Uniswap just announced Unichain. It was built in partnership with Flashbots and the Optimism team. It features these flash blocks, which are like 250 millisecond partial blocks. Based on that, they've taken some stuff from Solana architecture and it's also going to have the ability for apps to have custom logic which allows them to internalize MEV and a bunch of other stuff. So pretty big news goes into the thesis that I've been harping on for a while that every single successful app will eventually have its own execution environment.
00:01:52.623 - 00:02:08.023, Speaker B: And I think it's basically now all of them. Right? Like, I mean, Compound never launched their chain, but pretty much every successful app in crypto has, has moved to this model. And USWAP's just, just the latest one to do that. Curious. Yeah. What are you guys takes on this?
00:02:08.079 - 00:02:50.945, Speaker A: Yeah, so first of all, I think there's a lot of nuance in this because Unichain is not making the Uniswap ammo an app chain, right? This is like Uniswap taking their brand and wanting to become. And this is something that like I've kind of talked about for a while, how like, I think the end game of Uniswap is just to be this complete like consumer finance platform. Right? And that's why they've done the Wallet and now they're doing this chain too. And they can kind of just own the entire part of the stack. It's not like Uni Chain, it's just going to be their amm, right? And that's it. It's like they're using ref. It's like EVM chain.
00:02:50.945 - 00:03:19.027, Speaker A: They're going to get a bunch of applications built on top of them. This is just them, I think like using their brand to kind of just own the entire stack. Right. And I don't think every application can just do this. You have to be extremely successful like Uniswap. And like I do think this chain will probably be pretty successful. I think it's.
00:03:19.027 - 00:04:00.589, Speaker A: My first take is like it's bearish for a lot of the other L2s. Like base already took. Base already took like most of the activity on L2s. I feel like this one is going to do the same thing and just take more of that. Especially because it's going to be way more performant than the other ones. And that seems to be like what people kind of care about. Right? So yeah, what's interesting though is like obviously there was a lot of front writing in this efficient market hypothesis vindicated because like it's.
00:04:00.589 - 00:04:24.075, Speaker A: It didn't really move from the announcement, but it was up like 10% or so over the last day. But if this came out, I feel like if this announcement came out in 2021 or something, Unitoken would be flying. Right. And so it seems like people don't. I don't know if they don't care, maybe they got to read through it more.
00:04:26.175 - 00:04:50.545, Speaker C: But yeah, they mentioned they're passing through sequencers revenue to the Uni token. So I don't know if AMM fees will be passed on. I don't think they're using this as a kind of Trojan horse to turn on a fee switch. But they're creating a new source of fees, but they're passing those fees along to the Uni token, which is finally some form of value accrual there.
00:04:51.445 - 00:05:30.573, Speaker B: Yeah, they have this native interoperability solution, right. It's like leveraging the. The super chain stack, but you basically get sub one block ERC 20 transfers. And then they're trying to push this initiative called ERC7683 which is basically trying to extend that super chain interoperability to all other chains. And I'm guessing they're going to try and funnel a lot of users to just keep their assets here and then do all their swaps through Uniswap X. Right. Where they can just get you the best liquidity wherever it is and then.
00:05:30.573 - 00:05:38.065, Speaker B: And then like funnel the asset back here. Pretty, pretty interested to see how that how that plays out actually.
00:05:39.845 - 00:05:49.225, Speaker C: Outside of other L2s? I was joking around. One of the other big losers is Jared. What share of his MEV comes from Uniswap? It's gotta be.
00:05:49.565 - 00:05:55.775, Speaker A: Yeah, but do you think that people. Do you think this actually impacts Uniswap, like trading activity on L1?
00:05:56.435 - 00:05:59.971, Speaker C: I mean, I guess how much liquidity you think moves over it seems like.
00:06:00.003 - 00:06:22.031, Speaker B: The applications will want to move over, right. Because they have this ability to internalize some of the mev. And so there will be. It'll probably be the place that applications themselves want to encourage people to trade, which in turn will probably move a lot of. A lot of the volume and liquidity over there or a lot of the liquidity and volume over there.
00:06:22.163 - 00:06:26.119, Speaker A: Applications launching on Unichain have the ability to internalize their mev.
00:06:26.287 - 00:06:30.207, Speaker B: That's what I understood. Obviously this has just come out like an hour ago.
00:06:30.311 - 00:06:42.955, Speaker A: So doesn't that go against the white paper? Doesn't that kind of go against the app chain thesis then? If the application on a chain can just internalize the mev, then you don't need to create your own chain?
00:06:43.735 - 00:07:10.757, Speaker B: Well, it's through this stack they've created with the trusted execution environments and stuff where you can basically have applications put in logic that enforces certain ordering that allows them to capture some of the mev. I just read it on the blog post announcement. I'm like 25% of the way through the white paper, but I think that's the idea is that you can enforce any kind of sequencing through the trusted execution environment.
00:07:10.901 - 00:07:45.825, Speaker A: Yeah. So that to me is like against the app chain hypothesis. If a lot of reason why people think you need app change is because you can internalize all this and if you can just as like get like app specific sequencing as a contract, then you don't need to create an app chain. Right. So for me this is just like, for me this is just an inevitable thing that the biggest brand in crypto was going to make their own chain. Right. But obviously other applications are going to launch on this chain now.
00:07:45.825 - 00:08:14.775, Speaker A: And if they can internalize their own mev, then it's something like those applications will need to make their own chain. Right. And so that's why I don't see this as an app chain because it's like, it's just Uniswap brand creating a new performant chain for people to use. Right. It's just like another. It's like competing with Mega Eth. I would probably say if I had to pick like the main L2, right?
00:08:15.115 - 00:08:35.179, Speaker D: Ceteris, you got an interesting comment on one of your tweets. I think this guy listens to our shows pretty frequently from 8 my bags. Ceteris, am I taking crazy pills or is Eth becoming the cosmos Hub, like with kind of like announcements like this, you know, do you feel like it's moving more towards that?
00:08:35.267 - 00:08:59.067, Speaker A: I don't know. Because. No, because etha1 still is like general purpose contracts, right? It still has like all the restaking stuff. I mean, Uniswap stakers are still going to be. They're actually staking on L1. I mean there's some of that though for sure, but it's kind of just an inevitability, I guess. The Cosmos Hub literally does nothing.
00:08:59.067 - 00:09:11.607, Speaker A: So I don't think that the comparison is totally fair. And ETH actually like cemented itself as. I mean it's got like 300 bill market cap or something, right? And it's like the role of settle.
00:09:11.631 - 00:09:16.991, Speaker B: To eat like that. That doesn't happen. Adam secures like two. Two chains, right?
00:09:17.143 - 00:09:46.879, Speaker A: Yeah. As far as I get the analogy, I get it like a little bit. It's not completely accurate though. I think this is just like neutral for eat though. Like, you know, it's. Unless you think, I mean, you can say it's because I don't think uniswap on L1 is really going to lose too much activity because it kind of is just like base infrastructure on Ethereum L1, right. It just facilitates like a spot.
00:09:46.879 - 00:10:01.155, Speaker A: AMM has to be on a general purpose chain. Right? That's why I think calling this an app chain is not really correct because it's not an app chain. It's just Uniswap is creating this performant chain with their brand.
00:10:02.015 - 00:10:46.825, Speaker B: There is an app chain though, that's like. And they couldn't do this anywhere else, right? Because this module that they've written, they'd have to get integrated by whatever chain they wanted to deploy on in addition to the other stuff that they've put into the chain that we don't even know about. I mean, one of the points of app chains is sovereignty, right? You can implement whatever changes you want to the execution environment to the transaction ordering without having to go through an EIP or convince, you know, the Optimism team or whatever to. To implement it. And I assume, I mean, yeah, I don't know where, where this is going to go, how they're going to like attract liquidity to, to trade here instead. But yeah, I agree. Mega Eth is the is like the biggest competitor.
00:10:46.825 - 00:11:14.939, Speaker B: Although all other L2s are, I think two base chain, probably like Athena chain two to some extent. But I think they're going to try and position this as like the Solana on eth. Right. Where most of the liquidity sits for meme coins for assets. Like a bunch of the probably OG uni lps will move over. There's probably going to be some incentives to do so as well. Not sure if the MEV will be enough or if they'll use actual incentives, but yeah, yeah, like I do.
00:11:14.939 - 00:11:16.355, Speaker B: It's definitely an app chain.
00:11:16.475 - 00:11:45.313, Speaker A: Okay. So we can call it, we can, hey, we can call that app chain, whatever. What I think is really happening is a successful app gets to create their own kind of like customized, specialized chain because they have this strong app that they can integrate in. But then the chain itself is not necessarily an app chain. That's like what Athena is doing too. Right. It's like they've got this stable that is everywhere and now they can use that product to just create their own chain.
00:11:45.313 - 00:12:18.911, Speaker A: And I think you'll see the successful ones are able to do that where they have a successful app. But then when they move to their own chain, it's not like the chain is just their own app, it's using that as like the pillar. But then you're bringing in all these other applications as well. Right. And I think, yeah, you could kind of see this being like maybe it shifts away from just having these purely general purpose L2s in it. And it's like you create these chains around, you know, custom whatever.
00:12:19.023 - 00:12:21.575, Speaker D: Right, yeah, that's. That.
00:12:21.615 - 00:13:02.373, Speaker B: That's always been my, like our modular thesis, I guess, of why we think everything ends up as an app chain and why there will be thousands of them. And I do think it also, I mean, this definitely doesn't validate. There will be thousands of them because as you said, you have to be a successful application to really pull this off. But it does, I feel like, affect the L1, the monolith thesis if you just end up being a test net for successful apps, basically because as soon as you succeed, you migrate off to your own chain to capture the MEV and whatever else users and stuff like this. Yeah, I don't know. This is why I'm. I mean, Solana has its own modular stack that's developing now and stuff.
00:13:02.373 - 00:13:17.805, Speaker B: But yeah, this is kind of where I think most successful apps will end up, honestly, and why I'm so bullish on stuff like Anisha that's trying to build with this in mind from the get go. And Super Chan, I mean, I think Super Chan is doing a really good job too. Probably the leaders.
00:13:18.385 - 00:13:45.421, Speaker A: Yeah. So it's interesting, like OP vs ARB, like Arbitrom has way more activity than optimism. Right. Optimism is kind of like ghost town now, but optimism seems to be getting all of these big wins on the BD side. Right. And it's like what is more. I mean, what token is more like the OP token has nothing to do with this uni chain.
00:13:45.421 - 00:14:07.825, Speaker A: Right. And the OP token has really nothing to do with base. Whereas. So I don't know, it's like an interesting to see how the OP and the ARB token will diverge over time. If Arbitrom, you know they have these orbit chains. Sure. But the most of the activity within Arbitrum Eco is on Arbitrum and then like I guess hyper Liquid.
00:14:07.825 - 00:14:22.225, Speaker A: Right. But for optimism it's like it's really these other chains now, these other chains that are going to start taking over all the activity. And so what does OP like mean? What is op? What's the point of that token? Right?
00:14:22.345 - 00:15:05.945, Speaker B: Yeah. The bear case is that it just becomes like the Cosmos SDK has been hugely successful, but Atom hasn't really benefited from that. I think the OP stack could be somewhat similar where you have Base and Unichain and a bunch of others that end up using your stack. But how do you benefit from that? I do think owning this interoperability standard, basically having an inbuilt bridge and then offering these value add services at the super chain level will end up being pretty valuable because you will. They're just best positioned to coordinate across all the projects using their stack. But it's definitely like a lot of execution risk in doing that. But I do think that will be like pretty valuable.
00:15:06.325 - 00:15:41.713, Speaker A: I don't agree though that with the thesis that applications will keep all the MEV in the long run. Because there's a lot of benefits to launching on a shared layer. And again the uni chain is kind of goes in with that. Applications launching on Uni, we'll take some of the mev, Uni chain will take some of it. There's kind of like this bargaining. Like if you launch on a general purpose L1, it's kind of like this bargaining you do with the validators because there's a lot of benefit to sharing state with other applications. And so right now validators are taking like all the MEV and stuff.
00:15:41.809 - 00:15:54.177, Speaker B: What are the benefits? Because like when we did the analysis on, we haven't redone it, but when we did it like two and a bit years ago, there was very little of the state that actually touched each other on both Solana and Ethereum.
00:15:54.361 - 00:15:56.921, Speaker A: Well, it's the users and the liquidity, basically.
00:15:57.033 - 00:16:05.657, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, but that's more ux, right? Like theoretically that would. That could be solved with you with like chain abstraction or like UX abstraction.
00:16:05.761 - 00:16:07.193, Speaker A: Sure. Like theoretically.
00:16:07.289 - 00:16:12.485, Speaker B: It's been theoretical for a few years. I'm not, I'm not like. But, but still that there's nothing fundamental about.
00:16:12.795 - 00:16:26.095, Speaker D: Did you guys see synapse? Do you guys see SYNAPSE launching Cortex Seems like it's solving exactly what you're referring to, Jose. It's been in the works for years.
00:16:26.995 - 00:16:39.163, Speaker A: So we've heard chain abstraction is one of these things where it's like, sure, yeah, everybody knows we need it. It's like a solution and everything. But it's like unclear how good you can actually make that and how long that's going to take.
00:16:39.219 - 00:16:51.765, Speaker D: I just love how all these conversations come back and then the answer is, is the Synapse chain now called Cortex, if it launches, if it can execute on the vision. That's what I've been invested in for two years.
00:16:52.945 - 00:17:29.905, Speaker B: Wasn't it going to look anyway, I'm not going to give you more rope on this show. So segue to this. Do we want to talk about the applications versus Infra? Ryan Watkins had a great post just pointing out how applications are now like pretty strongly flipping Infra in terms of, in terms of revenue, but not so for, for valuations. And yeah, his, his conclusion was that like Infra would probably still command higher valuations, but only a few, only a few L1s will be able to do that because they're basically competing for money.
00:17:31.165 - 00:17:31.477, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:17:31.501 - 00:17:35.225, Speaker B: I'm curious what you guys thought of the post and what your. Where you guys sit on this.
00:17:36.115 - 00:18:21.829, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean it's, it's a sum of the parts thing. Right. So it's not, I mean you have some that are outpacing like less used chains, but you know, there's no one really competing directly with Ethan Sol. But if you do some of the parts on all of them, that makes sense, I guess. Like it seems pretty inevitable that more of the dollar spend of users will shift towards apps because you know, to some extent you assume that they would move to a cheaper chain. Right. If like every dollar of spend on an app was, was sending more towards the L1, then there's an opportunity for that activity to shift to a cheaper chain.
00:18:21.829 - 00:19:05.891, Speaker C: There's you know, realistically it shouldn't be that prohibitively expensive to transact on chain relative to what you're spending on the app. I guess it really depends as well on if you're thinking about the type of app too, right. If it's an exchange, the fee is pretty fixed in the form of gas, but the amount you spend is based on volume. Right. So if it's a lot of small transactions you'll have the makeup will shift more towards the L1. If it's a lot of large transactions, then the fee shift will go towards the app. So I think you kind of break it out app by app and do some of the parts.
00:19:05.891 - 00:19:21.663, Speaker C: But it seems inevitable that over time as scaling improves, the amount that's spent on the L1 or just the on chain fees should decline. Whereas the app fees are pretty standard.
00:19:21.859 - 00:19:52.939, Speaker A: I think there's two main. So the easiest example I guess look at like a money market. So money market has its internal fees which is just like interest spread, basically net interest margin that they make and that's like something application just accrues, right. But then there's where the real value is and that's in the liquidations and those are like execution and sequencing fees. Right. And those go to validators now. And so yeah, this just goes back to my earlier point.
00:19:52.939 - 00:20:35.361, Speaker A: Like as, as a money market you want to be on a chain with a lot of liquidity in it. And so you benefit from being on a shared state layer with a bunch of activity. And so right now, yes, validators of the L1 are taking all that MEV. They'll probably need to give some back to the money market, right? Like just competitively. But again, I don't think like money markets, a money market on like a shared out one will just take all that MEV because validators still need to get paid at the end of the day. Right. So I don't think, I think people like to take extreme views on the two sides of this and I think that, yes, I think that both apps will yes, start to accrue a higher portion of MEV and execution fees in the long run.
00:20:35.361 - 00:20:43.155, Speaker A: But if you just think that overall activity on these L1s just grows even more then. Right. It kind of like balances out.
00:20:43.615 - 00:20:48.075, Speaker B: But his point is that they're way overvalued if you're just looking at activity, right?
00:20:48.415 - 00:20:50.519, Speaker A: Oh, they probably always will be, right.
00:20:50.647 - 00:21:19.685, Speaker B: Like L1s or they're never valued. His comparison is like to which is one people have made many times before, just telecoms in the late 90s, right. There was like, there was no model to value them. People were extrapolating out absurd numbers. And then like 20 years later they're like very uninteresting businesses that are, that are valued on a multiple and like L1s could be the same. Right. This cycle where it's just like the only way to bet.
00:21:19.685 - 00:21:49.011, Speaker B: It's like the best proxy to bet on crypto and it's all like a relative value trade to Bitcoin. It's like all these things might be money. Like I'm bullish on crypto, I'm going to ape like Ethan. So whatever. But over time, as you get applications that win and like generate more fees emerge as the clear winners. Like a lot of that capital could shift away and L1s could just become boring infrared that's valued on a multiple. I agree they have some pricing power based on the value of the state on there that you want to access.
00:21:49.011 - 00:22:16.739, Speaker B: But I just think that's way less than. Money markets is pretty much the only example I can think of. And even there it's the stuff that like there's not that many people using LP shares as collateral in money markets or anything like that anymore. It's just really like you just need it for liquidations, right. To be able to liquidate the collateral quickly like within a block or whatever. I don't know that there's that much. Yeah.
00:22:16.739 - 00:22:33.515, Speaker B: The composability thesis I feel like, just hasn't. I think if you think about why people want to launch on a monolith or on an L1, much more of it is the UX and user base versus benefits from, from composability compared to what we initially posited in like 2020, 2021.
00:22:33.555 - 00:22:39.115, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, for sure. Everything you do is basically async. Like, you know.
00:22:39.275 - 00:22:40.027, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
00:22:40.091 - 00:23:17.795, Speaker A: Borrow something, you then swap it for something, you then deposit it into a pool. Like those are all async. Right. But like the UX and liquidity is a big, is kind of like a big deal. And I don't think it's as easy to solve as people will kind of pitch and make it out to be. And if you can just Keep scaling the L1 more and more like how like Solana and some of these other high throughput chains are trying to do. I think these, I think these chains will continue to see more like relative activity share go up over the next like couple of years.
00:23:18.415 - 00:23:25.387, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean I think like the value path they're certainly pegged to BTC as is everything in the space.
00:23:25.491 - 00:23:25.707, Speaker A: Right.
00:23:25.731 - 00:24:21.531, Speaker C: And so that there's that element and then there's also kind of front running their path to becoming eventual utilities. Right. In a world where eth is whatever its steady state value, let's just call it 10K, everything works out like assuming everything goes well. I don't, I think it basically front runs the activity that's supposed to get there, then the activity gets there. Then it operates more like a utility where it's slightly more volatile but it's less of a front running the beginning of the Internet type of, type of play. So that's why I think all of these valuations are mega stretched on these L1s because the TAM that you're hoping to pricing in this optimistic large TAM in the future. And so yeah, that gets front run and then eventually they kind of hit steady state and then ideally it's the apps that start to do well.
00:24:21.531 - 00:24:29.415, Speaker C: And yeah, I think that the proxy of utilities from back then is apt here but it's tough to draw like exact parallels.
00:24:30.075 - 00:24:54.131, Speaker B: Yeah, it's just with telecoms they didn't hit well. They front ran activity that didn't end up happening. Right. And there was like a big crash. Like I think most of them haven't even hit their 2,000 peaks. I'd have to go look at a chart but I think Cisco and stuff like only recently or maybe hasn't even hit their 2000 peaks. Like 20 years.
00:24:54.203 - 00:25:17.405, Speaker C: It's like networking though. Telecoms is like your Verizon, AT and T's more so and they basically because they sold off the tower businesses and those became utilities as more capital efficient basically for the towers to be standalone and for multiple telecoms to use the same tower versus each telecom owning their own tower. And yeah, Yeah.
00:25:17.445 - 00:25:21.437, Speaker B: I mean AT&T and Verizon are both below their 2000 price.
00:25:21.501 - 00:25:22.877, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean I used to cover.
00:25:22.941 - 00:25:25.509, Speaker B: Obviously it doesn't take. Okay.
00:25:25.637 - 00:25:27.381, Speaker C: It's a very boring business.
00:25:27.573 - 00:25:29.145, Speaker D: It's just crazy.
00:25:29.445 - 00:25:49.105, Speaker C: You hit pretty much like there's a decent amount of saturation and growth is from, you know, children aging into adults being able to use phones and immigration. Right. Like that's your. Otherwise you're saturated and you're just trying to steal market share from each other through promotions and all of that. And so they become just yield based products.
00:25:49.645 - 00:25:53.145, Speaker B: You know you've saturated your revenue when you're waiting for children to age.
00:25:55.125 - 00:26:15.705, Speaker D: Yeah, I feel like on the application side it's just, I think the easiest point in the stack to extract value seems to be just like distribution to Users, which probably comes as like a form of, you know, some sort of regulatory moat or just like having that distribution. So it's like.
00:26:17.565 - 00:26:18.837, Speaker B: Is this a setup for.
00:26:18.941 - 00:27:02.505, Speaker D: No, I'm not. I'm just saying like that just like the wallets, any, anything, right? Like even base and Coinbase and like you know, just funneling their users there, extracting fees there. Like what Uniswap is doing, they have a brand, they can bring their users to their chain. Any, anyone with users. That just seems like the maximum point of value to be extracted is you own the users and then you can take fees from them. Like a lot of the infra pieces will just kind of compete each other on fees and that'll get grinded in over time. And yeah, I think you have to hope the like the L1s do capture some sort of monetary premium because it's really going to like, I think just the easiest point to extract fees is going to be at the user level.
00:27:02.885 - 00:27:05.621, Speaker A: Did you read Robby's fat wallet thesis?
00:27:05.813 - 00:27:09.277, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that that's probably where.
00:27:09.381 - 00:27:46.455, Speaker B: We'Re going for a while though, and it hasn't really played. We started investing against this thesis in 2020 also thinking that not just wallets, but the zappers of this world, whoever's closest to the user, whoever the user like. Because our theory is just people aren't going to be interacting directly with these protocols. There's going to be some abstraction layer which might be a wallet, it might be a portfolio dashboard, it might be a trading terminal and they would own the user and be able to capture value. But it hasn't really played out. MetaMask is the only one that's really managed to do that, I think.
00:27:46.875 - 00:28:04.039, Speaker A: Yeah, but I think that the idea that front ends are capturing value was true at least if you just look at valuations. And we saw this with like Jupiter and Uniswap who were both like the front ends of respective ecosystem. They're both like seven ten billion dollar.
00:28:04.087 - 00:28:25.165, Speaker D: Valuations or something like Uniswap, market share barely dropped after they took the front end fee from 0 to 25 basis points because they have just such brand recognition. And the users, um, I can pull up the data quickly, but it dropped like maybe from like 40% to like 30% or something. And a lot of those users are sticky.
00:28:25.625 - 00:28:30.881, Speaker C: Just how many people are using MetaMask and paying those fees is a testament that people aren't super fee sensitive.
00:28:30.993 - 00:28:44.555, Speaker A: I mean even people that are smart enough to fish, I get into giving them $6 million of tokens are using Metamask to swap. Like that's how many, that's just how many people just like value that convenience, right?
00:28:45.695 - 00:29:30.375, Speaker D: Especially when this stuff is so volatile and it's like okay, like this stuff swings 10% a day, 5, 10% a day to make sure that you're getting like trustworthy reliable execution for 25 bips is really like such a relatively low price to pay versus you know, your transaction failing or you know, using a website where is hacked or compromised or something and potentially losing your funds. I think that crypto is so trust oriented and execution is so important because these assets are so volatile that you know, whoever is going to be the biggest trusted brand offering the best execution and like safety and like cultivates that among their customers is going to be like very sticky in the marketplace.
00:29:30.535 - 00:30:08.617, Speaker B: There are some counterpoints, right? Like tether is I guess a counterpoint like in terms of someone that doesn't have, I mean I guess they started by having one like they kind of grew it through Bitfinex initially when Bitfinex was dominant exchange, but nowadays they really are like a headless. You know, there is no tether, front end or anything that's attracted through and they just print money off being used by others. I think stablecoins are an example where like you can actually pull that off. Although to grow you do kind of need to like try and own the user as you know, Frax and Maker and everyone found out and having to build out their own defi primitives. But there are like a few examples.
00:30:08.721 - 00:30:16.841, Speaker C: I'd say they built the most. That's liquidity. Yeah, liquidity is the moat. Every like the most liquid trading pair on every major exchange is tether.
00:30:17.033 - 00:30:24.849, Speaker B: Yeah, it's like if you don't have a network effect, you have to own the user. Right. If you don't have like some kind of economy of scale, you sort of have to own the user.
00:30:24.897 - 00:30:37.815, Speaker C: There's also the comfort of not using USDC and the stigma that being associated with the thought that they can freeze your assets. So if you're an irrational, you're just not gonna, you're gonna opt for tether over usdc.
00:30:38.195 - 00:31:17.385, Speaker D: Yeah, I think like just front end and capturing the users is one moat. Like there's definitely other moats in the business. But as Jan said like USDT has just grown to such an enormous size that they do own a lot of users in terms of like you know, the trend like the currency of these exchange pairs. And then also just like people hold tether and use tether and like commerce and a lot of places across the world, like, they've kind of built that up through just like being the only real competition or just having so much distribution. But it does kind of come back down to owning the user. They're just not really like an exchange front end business. They're more focused on that stable coin.
00:31:18.125 - 00:31:23.733, Speaker B: Yeah. So TLDR were bullish applications.
00:31:23.909 - 00:31:44.439, Speaker A: Oh, I do think, I do think. Like just on a final point, it's like the industry doesn't make sense if you can't build an app and keep the value. What's the point? People aren't going to build apps just so that they can push the L1 token because they own big bags of it. That's not how you get new developers and stuff.
00:31:44.567 - 00:32:21.749, Speaker B: Yeah. And this kind of leads us nicely to the next point on memes. So memes have seen a resurgence. We saw SPX 6900, which Mirage showed me at token 2049, and I didn't buy enough of have like an absurd sort of whiff, like run. And in general, like, there's sort of been another meme meme season last week. And there's been a lot of takes on Twitter about this, about how people saying memes are good because all the reasons like, yeah, equalizing the playing field and all this.
00:32:21.917 - 00:32:36.277, Speaker A: I think the interesting one and the one that like yawn disagrees with too, but I kind of agree with. And this is done by the guy at. I forgot. It's like the research Montegro.
00:32:36.301 - 00:32:37.717, Speaker D: A banana gun bull.
00:32:37.821 - 00:33:06.071, Speaker A: All right, so his point was that meme coins are good because they divert capital away from like pure narrative trades. Right. And so you have these kind of trades a lot throughout crypto where it's like, oh, the L2 trade is on and people are just going to bid L2 tokens indiscriminately. And then, oh, there's like restaking trade or something. So maybe you'll get a bunch of like those tokens or like a DA trade. Right. You get a bunch of DA tokens going.
00:33:06.071 - 00:33:34.315, Speaker A: And these kind of have no semblance for, I guess, valuation or fundamentals. It's just kind of like chasing narratives. And so his point is that with people bidding meme coins, that capital that would chase narratives now is not there. And so real projects need to actually create a useful product with real fundamentals in order to get liquid funds to buy them because you don't have that indiscriminate capital just chasing these narratives anymore.
00:33:34.695 - 00:33:54.262, Speaker C: No. Yes. I was going to say Even in the crazy scenario where 1% of Narrative 1, like 99% of Narratives are vaporware and 1% are, there's some something useful to the space that's still more productive than chasing memes because you're at least getting 1% something.
00:33:54.399 - 00:33:56.519, Speaker D: Shibarium. L2, have you heard of that?
00:33:56.567 - 00:34:37.285, Speaker C: Like, you know, typically with the narrative chases it you'll have like, it's, it's, as you see with most stuff, right? It's something quality that'll kick things off and then you'll have a lot of these parallel evm and like all of these other narratives that really have no teeth that are following, which I agree are vaporware, but they're usually catalyzed by something that's productive infra. And so people just need to create narratives around catch up trades. And so if the byproduct of this is like, you know, annoying kind of vaporware catch up trades, but you're still having some productivity that catalyzes it initially, I think that's more productive than the, you know, the meme side.
00:34:37.585 - 00:35:35.485, Speaker B: I strongly agree. I just think like that narrative, the idea. And it also depends how you define these narrative trades because like the Internet was a narrative trade for like a decade, right? Like the valuations didn't make sense for the, for like the multiples, the revenue multiples. And any new technology is going to be a narrative trade where like the price is going to get ahead of fundamentals. Like in fact, if it's trading like an appropriate multiple, it's probably a very boring business with no growth, right? That's just sort of how it works. And like in crypto, of course everything is going to, of course everything is going to be mostly a narrative trade, right? Like most of the stuff is the cash flows are fired in the future if this thing works. And I don't know, for me the mean thing is really like an admission that, yeah, none of this stuff will ever have value, right? You're kind of like throwing away at least the Murad thesis.
00:35:35.485 - 00:36:01.839, Speaker B: At least the Murad thesis is basically that the Murad thesis is utility tokens were just meme coins, right? It's just that their meme was complicated to understand. Whereas the meme coin meme is simple to understand. So a lot more people are going to ape that. And to me that's just like not, not true. I mean, I respect Murad a lot obviously, but that to me that's just not, not the case. Like, I think a lot of this stuff is going to be incredibly valuable and wouldn't be in the space if I thought that it was all just memes.
00:36:02.007 - 00:36:33.865, Speaker C: Yeah, I think he, I think he's just, you know, being hyperbolic for the sake of getting attention and it contributes to it. And I think he's, you know, he's knowingly doing this right. I don't think he 100% believes what he's saying. I think he's, it's intentional. It's his marketing. I like and respect Murata a bunch. But you know, even going back to the argument around it being productive for incentivizing good builders, I, I think that even falls apart because I would say meme coins are a disincentive.
00:36:33.865 - 00:37:11.675, Speaker C: They like good builders are just like, wait, they just launched and then it pumped whatever and they made how much? And I'm going to be here building for two years to get just on, on, on Twitter for like, you know what I mean? I think, I think it's sued by the negative catalyst for. Yeah, I think meme coins, you know, just like where am I going to spend my time? I can try taking 100 shots on goal with one of these meme coins and keep kind of iterating and eventually one will hit and I'll make a bunch of money or I can try building and who knows, you know, this, the spatial shift, I just think it, it, it, it skews like the reward mechanism mechanics for, for builders and, and skews incentives if you get, if you.
00:37:11.715 - 00:37:41.167, Speaker A: Create, if you create a new good primitive with a good token, you know, not a bunch of shitty unlocks and everything. Not a crazy high ftv. This meme coin capital is going to bid the fuck out of that narrative. And so the meme coin capital I don't think is just always going to be in memes. I think it's kind of waiting for something that's worthy of a bid. And we haven't really had that. It is very hard to bid a lot of these new tokens that are coming out.
00:37:41.167 - 00:38:06.837, Speaker A: It's just like, it doesn't really make sense. But I guarantee you when we get like some new good organic and most of the good things to bid historically in crypto have been like organic random things that have popped up. Like obviously a lot of the defi summer stuff, telegram bots, right? Those just came out of nowhere. Like there's a lot of kind of examples of that.
00:38:07.011 - 00:38:29.657, Speaker B: The other, the other kind of argument I thought was, was really good. Was the Alexander good one. Just that like the TAM and this is like my problem with the murad sort of narrative, too. It's just these things are not cults. Like, they're not religions. Like, religions develop over, like, hundreds or thousands of years. And, like, they're not united by a coin going up.
00:38:29.657 - 00:39:10.497, Speaker B: They're united, like, by deep cultural and, like, spiritual beliefs. And, like, these things, the only time where they seem to have that is when the token's going up, right? And then, like, obviously, when token goes down, that veneer disappears. And to me, like, the tam, like, if you're going to tell a good meme, is a good story, right. It's just a good narrative. And the meme around something like AI, but even around crypto, around, like, a permissionless global financial system, is just so much bigger than the meme. You can tell about, like, I don't know, even, like, retardio or whatever the meme of the month is. Like, the TAM is just so much bigger.
00:39:10.497 - 00:39:35.555, Speaker B: It's so much easier to tell a bullish story about Tao or some AI coin than it is about memes that I just think memes just aren't thinking big enough. They're like, oh, look at Doge, it traded at like, 90 billion in May 21or whatever. Like, that's where these memes will trade at. And it's like the time for some of the AI stuff, even some of the cryptos, the pure crypto stuff, is just so much bigger that I think, yeah, a lot of people will end up missing the.
00:39:36.735 - 00:40:06.875, Speaker C: I think you can argue that both ways, though, because, you know, part of what helps memes is there is no fundamental value, so the ceiling is somewhat uncapped there. Whereas for some of this other stuff, eventually fundamentals come into play and they tend to anchor price a bit. Granted. Yeah, I think it'll be hard for memes to surpass previous valuations just because of the. So there's like, opposing forces. On one hand, you have, like, the dilution right now you have multiple nine figure, me or ten figures.
00:40:07.615 - 00:40:08.287, Speaker B: And then.
00:40:08.391 - 00:40:21.175, Speaker C: And then on the other hand, memes are much more consensus, and I think they represent a larger percentage of people's portfolios than they ever have. Right. And so those are kind of offsetting. I do think they're really useful to bring in capital into the space, though.
00:40:21.215 - 00:40:46.051, Speaker D: Yeah, that's what I was gonna say. I was just waiting to say that it's like memes that the thing that they're good for is they're onboarding people. Like, you know, apps like Moonshot and stuff. It's like these are actually onboarding people and like, yeah, you can throw some money in it. It's fun. But then, you know, you learned what a token is, you learn what a wallet is, you start transacting with this stuff, you're like, oh, wow. Like, there could be a lot more here beyond just the meme coins.
00:40:46.051 - 00:41:33.237, Speaker D: And obviously that's making the assumption that you're going to graduate from just like chasing these meme coins to like, you know, appreciating this technology for what it is. But I do think it's bringing a lot more attention around the space. And I think it was Ceteris who shared, you know, like, the amount of like, by broken out by generation, like, how many people, like, or what percent of the generation owns crypto. And I definitely think, you know, as zoomers and kind of the younger generation spending more time online, getting more comfortable with digital value, like meme points is a good foray into that. And then, you know, as they understand the technology more, they might graduate beyond them. But I definitely think that's positive for bringing in users to like, just get comfortable with the technology in itself in a fun way. Like.
00:41:33.421 - 00:41:41.197, Speaker B: But yeah, every cycle, like, people buy some tokens. Like, buying tokens brings in users. Like, it doesn't have to be meme coins. It could be any for sure.
00:41:41.261 - 00:41:42.625, Speaker D: But it's like this.
00:41:43.525 - 00:41:44.933, Speaker C: The simplicity of it is nice.
00:41:44.989 - 00:41:50.043, Speaker D: Yeah, the simplicity. And these apps, like Moonshot is like, that sort of stuff is so cool.
00:41:50.219 - 00:42:17.515, Speaker A: Yeah. On like the. The good Alexander post though, I read that and I actually agreed with a lot of stuff he said. He had that chart too that was like, Nvidia trading volume versus, like GME trading volume and just how much bigger. And you know, I've always kind of thought. I've always been Just thought Tau was like, you know, not like a real thing. And I still think it's like, just incredibly narrative driven.
00:42:17.515 - 00:42:52.035, Speaker A: But, you know, every time I update those, like, sector performances, the, you know, we talk about how, like, everything is basically down, but the crypto AI stuff is always like, actually standing out beside memes. And I actually kind of. I read that I started thinking about it more. I actually considered buying, like, Tao for the first time because I actually kind of believe in that, like, big Tam. And it's like Tau is basically just a meme, but it's AI. Right. And so I kind of Is there.
00:42:52.075 - 00:42:53.859, Speaker D: Like, it isn't just.
00:42:54.027 - 00:42:58.275, Speaker B: That's like. That's like super unfair, like, to. I mean, I hear what you're saying.
00:42:58.355 - 00:43:14.615, Speaker A: But it's a meme relative to its valuation. It's a meme relative to its valuation. But yeah, I know it's not just a meme, but. No, I agree with his point that, like the, you know, you can dream a lot more, right? Like, there's a lot more dreaming to be done with this, like AI.
00:43:16.875 - 00:43:45.545, Speaker C: And then you start comping it to kind of private valuations too. If you believe in the value of crypto and AI, you start comping it to OpenAI's 180 bill and things of that nature. And then there's also just the fact that there aren't too many quality AI coins, which is set to change over the next six to 12 months. So it'll be interesting to see how much of its value has been because it's the kind of canonical crypto AI bet that people can make right now.
00:43:45.625 - 00:44:17.571, Speaker B: Yeah, it's just what, what has more like product market fit as a meme? Like, whatever SPX, I guess xpx6900 does have pretty good product market fit, but I mean, like retardio or. Or like AI, you know, like replacing all human, like, cognitive and physical labor. Like, what's going to let people get more excited, speculate more? Like, I don't know, it's just to me, and crypto has a bunch of memes like that that I just think are way more interesting than the naping bees.
00:44:17.643 - 00:45:28.295, Speaker D: There's a certain amount of people which will never buy meme coins or take them seriously, whereas you can kind of probably convince a lot more people on something like Tao, where it's like, this is the future of AI versus a lot of these meme coins. Is everyone, at some level, or at least a lot, a large part of the capital that could flow into these things knows that like, this is just a trade, right? Like, I don't know if this cult vision comes true because, like, the whole thing, like, it sounds very convincing and, you know, also a lot of respect for Murad, but like, the whole idea is like, okay, we're all going to get rich off these and it's all going to be a cult, but, like, to actually get rich or like, make it like, you need to sell at some point. So that's kind of where it falls apart part. It's like, is everyone just gonna, like, have millions and millions of dollars of unrealized gains and all these meme coins and never touch them to sell and like, who is the eventual bidder for those things, right? Because, like, I don't think any, like, super serious funds or people or like large portions of capital are Going to come in and like take really big positions in like something like a Doge or a ship and like as a long term can conviction bet.
00:45:28.335 - 00:45:28.487, Speaker C: Right.
00:45:28.511 - 00:46:09.765, Speaker D: It's maybe more to play like the market dynamic. So it's like I don't know who's going to be kind of like the exit liquidity for that cult if these people actually want to real whole vision of becoming wealthy. But it definitely is an intriguing narrative and you know, says a lot about the space and people pissed off with the low float. If these stuff which we've talked a ton about and probably will continue to do well as long as like Doge exists at you know, multi billion dollar, ten billion dollar market cap, twenty billion dollars market cap and all these new meme ones like you know, can launch and get to a billion or something. Like there's so many meme coins about a billion now. Like there's just going to continue to be more of them. But I do think it's good to onboard people.
00:46:11.025 - 00:46:42.495, Speaker C: Yeah, I think they're different investment buckets though. Right. Like I don't. You're not, you're not kind of putting money into TAO and expecting a similar degree of return over the same time period as you are putting into kind of some of these short, these low market cap memes. So I think there's a different bucket. Like it's not, I'm not, I'm not satisfying my meme exposure because Tao also has memetic value. I think I'm getting my exposure through TAO and I'm like, I'm happy that it also has memetic value that drives it.
00:46:42.495 - 00:46:45.711, Speaker C: Right. So it's not. I don't see them being as the.
00:46:45.743 - 00:46:51.135, Speaker D: Kind of maybe I don't have money that will like people won't just bid.
00:46:51.175 - 00:46:51.559, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:46:51.647 - 00:46:55.191, Speaker D: Like a certain amount of people or funds or whatever just aren't going to bid.
00:46:55.263 - 00:46:58.159, Speaker A: Means there's definitely a decision of like.
00:46:58.247 - 00:46:59.805, Speaker C: From the retail perspective.
00:46:59.975 - 00:47:15.137, Speaker A: No, but there's definitely decision of buying like whiff versus Tau. Right. Like Tao is like double the circulating cap. Obviously the FTV is bigger but like that is a real decision. Like am I gonna buy like Whiff or Bonker Pepe or am I gonna buy Tau? Right.
00:47:15.161 - 00:47:18.657, Speaker D: Do you think for a fund that's a real decision? No, no, not for a fun serious capital.
00:47:18.721 - 00:47:19.009, Speaker A: No, no.
00:47:19.017 - 00:47:21.153, Speaker D: A fund drive these things and that's.
00:47:21.169 - 00:47:35.785, Speaker A: Why, listen, you get like the grayscale. Grayscale has like some AI fund and they just increase their tau exposure from like 2 to 26% or something. Thing yeah, 30. 30. So like again, I'm talking myself into Tao.
00:47:36.445 - 00:47:38.385, Speaker C: Yeah, I have a. Yeah.
00:47:38.725 - 00:47:47.629, Speaker B: Speaking of fundamentals, my own towel. When this airs, do we want to chat about the off the grid launch? I feel like that was one of.
00:47:47.637 - 00:48:17.303, Speaker A: The biggest one, one thing on crypto AI. We're doing like, we're doing a huge, like three week crypto AI thing starting next week. Tons of panels, like tons of different crypto AI protocols and everything. Some investors. This is a three week thing. We're going to have stuff coming out every day. We're going to have, we have an analyst on Deli Pondering Durian who is writing a four part series on crypto AI.
00:48:17.303 - 00:48:32.075, Speaker A: Tower in the Square is already free. He's done like infrastructure, middleware and application soon. And these are all going to be unlocked too. So, yeah, we got like a ton coming out on this whole sector that's just going to be like available starting next week.
00:48:32.735 - 00:49:09.727, Speaker B: Yeah, we, we think crypto is. Or at least, yeah, a lot of us think crypto AI is one of the most exciting of the most exciting sector in crypto right now. So we're dedicating a whole month to it. It's going to be some really spicy debates too. Like, I think we've already had a really good Tao debate actually with a very well spoken Taobear and then just. Yeah, there's a lot of Taobao to choose from, but I think we chose a good one. Then we're having like, is crypto AI a vaporware debate with Kyle Somani? Not exactly taking the bear case because they're bullish crypto AI, but at least like bearish on a couple of the sectors that people have been excited about.
00:49:09.727 - 00:49:27.051, Speaker B: And then Ahmad Mustak, the founder of Stability on the other side, and then pretty much all the best builders from Ritual, from all the top sort of crypto AI projects are going to be going to be there in different panels and stuff. So it's going to be a really good, really good month. Tune in.
00:49:27.203 - 00:49:27.931, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:49:28.083 - 00:50:04.909, Speaker B: So speaking of fundamentals, I wanted to touch on the off the grid launch, obviously that went live this week. It's a big investment for us at Delphi Ventures, obviously, full disclosure, but it's pretty much the crypto game that we've been the most excited about that we've ever seen in terms of like AAA quality. Something that we think could really bring in a mainstream audience. I think it's the most likely game to bring in 100 million users into crypto. And so far the launch has been really Good. It was obviously five years in the making. They raised over 100 mil, went live on Tuesday, had some of the biggest streamers in the world, ninja, Dr.
00:50:04.909 - 00:50:40.305, Speaker B: Disrespectful, a bunch of others streaming it for hours. Obviously some of this was paid, but most of them were staying for four hours past what they were, what they were paid for. And a bunch of streamers that weren't paid like Dr. Disrespect and others were also streaming this publicly. There's a lot of really strong feedback. I think people, people were really enjoying the gameplay. There was I think 450,000 new wallets created on Avalanche over the last few days and obviously they launched on a, on a Tuesday to give time to like bug fix and stuff leading up to the weekend, which is the time where you're gonna have the most, the most people online.
00:50:40.305 - 00:51:09.355, Speaker B: Over the last few days it was more streamed than games like Warzone and the target is to make it the most streamed game on Twitch over the next, over the next two weeks there was like, yeah, 350,000 hex decodings and like a bunch of, yeah, just. I think people were all over the world. You were getting games in less than a minute. So there was, there was a lot of, a lot of activity. Curious if any of you guys took a look at it and what you thought.
00:51:10.455 - 00:51:48.281, Speaker C: Yeah, I put a decent amount of hours in actually. It's, it's a lot of fun. I think the, one of the unique elements is just the. Obviously the firefights are really high quality, you know, good variety of guns. The land, the terrain is really interactive and I think. So the biggest thing and kind of one of my initial gripes with battle royales is kind of the ratio of time spent moving around and looking for weapons relative to firefights, which then makes firefights that you lose just more frustrating. You know, just my.
00:51:48.281 - 00:52:29.467, Speaker C: I spent most of my days playing like Halo and Modern Warfare where it words know two teams and high, high action constantly. You know, there's a full, full map of players and so what they've done a really good job of is making mobility a really important part of the game and so you're able to traverse the map very quickly with various gear. There's kind of different elements of the map that you know, like ropes that help you get to the top of a building and so you're able to bounce around a map really easily and which helps you one find users if you want to get into firefight, but also makes trying to get out of one A lot of fun too. And I think it's adds a whole new dimension to the game in terms of just like.
00:52:29.491 - 00:52:30.851, Speaker B: And the limb stuff is crazy.
00:52:30.923 - 00:52:33.027, Speaker C: Skill of mobility. Yeah, yeah.
00:52:33.091 - 00:52:37.203, Speaker B: Did you play with the limbs much? Because I know Ninja was just getting wrecked because didn't know he didn't know.
00:52:37.219 - 00:53:13.847, Speaker C: How to use it. It's hard. I need to just like, I haven't done the top down look of every single limb to figure out what's what. But yeah, the idea is you're a cyborg and you know, you have your torso and your arms and legs are removable and they provide different skills and abilities from jetpacks to shields to grappling hooks and kind of everything else in between, which adds a whole, you know, a level of kind of dynamism to the game and create so many permutations for firefights where you never really have a lot of kind of repetitive interactions. And also provides a lot of really cool counters to what people are doing. Yeah, yeah.
00:53:13.871 - 00:53:25.515, Speaker D: It definitely feels like it's increasing the skill cap because, you know, the big battle royales that came out initially were or like War Zone. Wait, what were the other ones? What was the big one?
00:53:26.015 - 00:53:27.007, Speaker C: Fortnite.
00:53:27.191 - 00:54:03.389, Speaker D: You know there's pubg for. Yeah, pubg. Pubg in Warzone. Like pubg especially was like. Why I feel like Fortnite was such a good upgrade is because Pubg lowered the skill cap so much in the sense where like you could just get screwed by the zone and then you're running across an open field and he's getting shot in the head and you just spent like the whole game like looting up and doing that and then you just like had a bad pull on the zone and you're just screwed. And then Fortnite like up the skill cap in a way with building where it's like, you know, you could create shelter wherever you were, that building significantly increased the skill cap. But it also like, you know, for casual players could be a lot like, if you face someone who's like a sweaty build, they like, you're just screwed.
00:54:03.437 - 00:54:06.525, Speaker C: Yeah, they just sound like they're typing on a keyboard.
00:54:06.645 - 00:54:33.223, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah. And I, and I feel like Apex Legends did like a good job with the mobility, but I think this is even like kind of an enhancement of that where you have this additional mobility. So it adds like a skill cap to the game where like it raises the skill ceiling on the game where it's like, you know, if you get put in a bad position, you can still get yourself out of it. And then with the limbs as well. It's a whole new element. So I think that's, it's. It's a pretty fun game.
00:54:33.223 - 00:54:42.311, Speaker D: I haven't played it yet, but I've been. I watched like a lot of, of Twitch streams like a few hours when it came out. Yeah, like it looks pretty sick. I need to get my computer set up.
00:54:42.503 - 00:55:08.441, Speaker B: I'm getting a PS5 actually just to play it. But yeah, I think also the on chain stuff seems to be working pretty seamlessly. Like their Avax subnet. Yeah, I think they minted like 350,000 hex decodings yesterday. So like loot that's extracted from the game then minted on chain. And I think if it, if it plays out like they've spent so much effort on that that it could also become like the winning sort of infra play. Right.
00:55:08.441 - 00:55:29.911, Speaker B: There's like a history in gaming of this being the case where the successful games end up also like building the info that they need and then like commercializing that as its own thing. Right. Like Fortnite with the epic game launcher, Counter Strike and Steam. We saw that to some extent in Crypto with Axie and then Ronin. Right. Like attracting a bunch of games because you get access to the Axie player base. I think if this is as successful as it.
00:55:29.911 - 00:55:37.795, Speaker B: As it could be, I do think like there, there's going to be a lot of people wanting to launch games on the, on the Gonzalez subnet.
00:55:38.295 - 00:56:05.925, Speaker D: Yeah, let's see. Like it's competing right now on like Twitch and stuff and obviously there's a lot of hype around it. But you know, the game looks and is just as fun and you know, it's getting as many viewers as like Warzone, Apex, any of those other battle royales. Obviously this is like the initial hype, but it's pretty exciting to see a crypto game of this quality with the real gamers and those level of streamers play and have a good time. So it's exciting for the space.
00:56:07.385 - 00:56:15.489, Speaker A: This is big for Avalanche, I guess too. I haven't really heard Avalanche a lot recently. Right. So this seems to be a pretty big flagship thing for.
00:56:15.577 - 00:56:32.855, Speaker D: Yeah, I just checked the chart. Avalanche isn't really up, but it would be cool if like how much value really accrues to the subnet? Do we know or not really to the subnet or like through the subnet to Avalanche?
00:56:33.995 - 00:57:04.281, Speaker C: I wouldn't assume an insane amount because it still ends up being a function of volume of transactions which the game itself doesn't necessarily operate on chain fully. It's kind of the claiming of items. And so, yeah, that happened to. To a decent amount. But I think ultimately most of the value will come from secondary market volume on these assets. Right. If you think about there's like tens of billions of volume that csgo did.
00:57:04.281 - 00:57:26.427, Speaker C: And so that's really where a lot of these games will kind of capture a bunch of value, which is great because it's directly correlated with the kind of on chain, the volume of the assets, which is, you know, a function of kind of excitement around the game and what people want to do. And so. And it's also not. Not really related to any kind of pay to win type of dynamic. Right.
00:57:26.451 - 00:57:26.635, Speaker A: It's.
00:57:26.675 - 00:57:34.815, Speaker C: It's skins that are cosmetic and rare and just based on kind of what you've achieved rather than how much money you've put in necessarily.
00:57:35.835 - 00:57:44.815, Speaker B: All right, guys, I think this was a good one. Covered a lot of ground. Let's end it there. Thanks everyone, for tuning in, and we'll see you again in. In two weeks.
00:57:45.235 - 00:57:49.255, Speaker A: Yep. Once again, crypto AI Starting next week, three weeks.
00:57:50.915 - 00:57:52.755, Speaker B: All right, say bye, because we forget.
00:57:52.795 - 00:57:55.415, Speaker A: Complaints about our thanks.
00:57:55.755 - 00:57:56.515, Speaker D: See you later.
