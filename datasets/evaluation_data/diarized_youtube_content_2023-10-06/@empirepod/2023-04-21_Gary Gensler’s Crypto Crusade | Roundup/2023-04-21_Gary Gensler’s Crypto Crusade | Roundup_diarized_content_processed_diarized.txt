Empire all right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Empire. We have a. I thought we were going to have a glasses list santi today, but alas, here we are.
00:00:27.172 - 00:00:46.612, Speaker B: Just annoying. I could go glasses. Because, folks, I don't read off the script, which is probably explains how sometimes I just butcher these episodes. But no, for the most part, I have astigmatism, which means I can. I can't read. Like, when I can't drive at night without glasses, it's almost like, you know, like, you're drunk. Yeah, I should get fine.
00:00:46.612 - 00:00:55.482, Speaker B: Like, insurance doesn't cover me, but my glasses and looking at a computer screen, so it's like this light stuff that I can't, like, just really blurry. So, anyways, you got to give me.
00:00:55.498 - 00:01:11.334, Speaker A: A fresh pair of glasses, man. I've, uh, people, I've been wearing contacts since the first grade. I have negative. Anyone who has bad, bad eyesight will understand what this means. But I have negative 7.5 eyesight, which is really bad. That's really, really bad.
00:01:11.834 - 00:01:18.002, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, you know, maybe in Austin, uh, I do have a. This company that does it. Uh, I always get my framework.
00:01:18.018 - 00:01:19.720, Speaker A: You got a guy? You got a guy for that?
00:01:19.842 - 00:01:25.812, Speaker B: Yeah, I got it. I always got a guy. You got a guy? It's a bit mainstream, but I got a guy.
00:01:25.868 - 00:01:29.100, Speaker A: You got a guy. Love that. You're not. You're not shopping at Warby no more?
00:01:29.292 - 00:01:34.964, Speaker B: No. All of our people's used to. No longer, uh, no warby. Yeah, I've gone through all of those.
00:01:35.044 - 00:01:39.684, Speaker A: What's the go to glasses brand these days? Should we give someone a nice plug or. We know. No free ads.
00:01:39.804 - 00:01:44.304, Speaker B: I love. I love the leak alpha. In this particular case, I will not.
00:01:44.604 - 00:01:47.184, Speaker A: No free ads, baby. How we, how you doing?
00:01:48.594 - 00:02:03.294, Speaker B: Big, you know, big week. I wouldn't say there's a ton going on, but there was some pretty interesting stuff. Yeah. You know, I've talked to a lot of folks recently. I'm feeling pretty good. You know, I'm pretty much unchanged from last week, but some interesting developments. How are you feeling?
00:02:03.674 - 00:02:17.048, Speaker A: Feeling good. We had blockworks beers last night. Fun event. So we've been. We used. So blockworks started out as a company. Pre media, pre newsletters, pre podcasts, any of that, just by hosting our first ever thing that we did was host these six to 10:00 p.m.
00:02:17.048 - 00:02:50.960, Speaker A: Happy hours in New York. And that's how blockworks started. And then as we started to monetize them and turn those into a real conference business, we started just hosting these things called blockworks beers for the community in New York, and we stopped doing them in 2019. And I was with one of our sales guys, this guy Max at ETH Denver, and we were meeting with a bunch of folks, and they were like, look, there's no New York crypto scene, and there's, like, no, like, place for us to come together. That's not a big conference. I was like, oh, we used to do these things, blockwork spears. And Max was like, let's bring it back.
00:02:50.960 - 00:02:58.536, Speaker A: So we brought it back, and it was cool. We had, like, we tweeted it out once. We had 250 people register and had, like, probably 150 people came out last night.
00:02:58.560 - 00:03:01.164, Speaker B: And where was that, by the way?
00:03:01.544 - 00:03:17.906, Speaker A: Uh, we rented out some bar. And we rented some bar. You can do these, like, weird deals with bars in New York, I think everywhere where you're like, we'll. If we bring at least 100 people, you give us the space for free. It's a Wednesday night, so, you know, you'll usually have minimal traffic.
00:03:17.970 - 00:03:24.282, Speaker B: Yeah, nice. Galaxy used to do these, uh, back in the day. Like, I remember going to these, like, 20, 1617.
00:03:24.338 - 00:03:38.878, Speaker A: Galaxy did them at, uh, at that office. No gal. Oh, okay, well, I'm thinking of a different one. I'm thinking of the ones that they did on, like, Thursday or Friday nights in New York, where it was at the restaurant and it turned into the club, and I wasn't.
00:03:39.046 - 00:03:43.254, Speaker B: I may have gone to one of those, but no, I think these were in their offices. Yeah.
00:03:43.334 - 00:03:48.454, Speaker A: Oh, man. New Yorkers will know what I'm talking about. I think Novogratz ended up buying the restaurant that they hosted them at.
00:03:48.574 - 00:03:50.314, Speaker B: Not surprising. Yeah.
00:03:50.654 - 00:04:04.834, Speaker A: But, no, it's a good. It's a good event. A lot of people to empire there. That was cool. Got to meet a lot of listeners, and basically everyone just told me how much better our show is than Mike's podcast on the margin. That was kind of the consensus, but we already knew that.
00:04:05.224 - 00:04:11.004, Speaker B: Mike, we feel for you, but keep doing what you're doing. You know, we were there at one point. Once we were there, we were there.
00:04:12.104 - 00:04:42.714, Speaker A: I do have good podcast news, actually. So we had this big announcement and, like, big podcast drop of another show called a Thousand X, which is hosted by Avi Feldman and Jonah. And we launched it on the Empire feed. And it's a show like for traders, buy traders. And we did one episode and then the compliance teams came down hard on us and not, not blockbuster compliance, but some other compliance folks. And so we had to pause the show. But the good news is that 1000 x is coming back.
00:04:42.714 - 00:04:55.094, Speaker A: You can find it on the Empire feed. Fingers crossed for episode two. First episode in a while of thousand x drops on Thursday. So next Thursday, thousand x coming back. You can find it on the empire feed.
00:04:55.434 - 00:05:02.876, Speaker B: Very nice. That's cool. We'll save all the tips and trading advice, which I'm never good at, to those folks, which are much smarter.
00:05:02.970 - 00:05:11.324, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Big brain traders. So let's start with. Let's start with Gary Ansler.
00:05:11.944 - 00:05:12.864, Speaker B: Sure. Yeah.
00:05:12.984 - 00:05:43.364, Speaker A: Cool. Did you watch the. Okay, so a little bit of background. The House Financial Services Committee hosted SEC chair Gary Gensler on Tuesday morning to discuss a whole bunch of stuff. So we were obviously focused on the crypto side of things, but they, it was a bigger conversation around climate change and ESG. And just like his, what Gary and the SEC have kind of like, done in a bunch of different, like, new and emerging areas. So they were discussing the agency's response to crypto regulation, investor protection, security classification, ESG mandates.
00:05:43.364 - 00:06:01.484, Speaker A: There were some pretty interesting and some pretty, like, whiffed on answers, I would say, that Gary had. But what was your take from either speaking to people who I know that, you know, like, kind of close to the scene there, or just, just from, from watching this, what was your initial reaction?
00:06:02.344 - 00:06:59.852, Speaker B: So, okay. My first impression was obviously seeing what most people saw on Twitter, crypto Twitter, which is a few of the clips where he's being particularly asked. If he says security a number of times and he doesn't basically provide an answer, then, um, there's an, uh, and there's another clip, uh, that was going around, which basically, you know, he gets asked a bunch of yes or no questions, he never answers, and basically talks about how he's like, you know, innovations going to China, and he's not providing any clarity. A lot of the stuff that we've heard from a lot of folks. And so when looked at that, you would have thought, hey, listen, it didn't go very well for him. And then, surprisingly, I spoke with another person that I consider to be one of the more preeminent experts closest to what's going on. And their take and interpretation was, yeah, if you just look at those two clips, it looks really, you know, like a win for crypto.
00:06:59.852 - 00:07:33.022, Speaker B: But by and large, I was surprised to hear that that wasn't their opinion, that he actually was very calm, even though he was shaking at times. And, you know, he, it was just part of his strategy. So Adak candidly caught me off guard, and I don't really. We're going to dig deeper into this. Probably in the next week or two. We're going to have a regulatory segment, uh, kind of on a quarterly basis, maybe, you know, more often, depending on how things progress. But I do want to.
00:07:33.022 - 00:08:00.010, Speaker B: That was all I heard. And I didn't really probe much. This person didn't have much time. But, um, yeah, I don't know if you felt that way, because the consensus seems to be this was a huge win for crypto. Look how regulator, like, you know, regulators or, like, congressmen really are pro crypto, and, uh, you know, they're aware that he's not doing a good job and hasn't provided clarity for the space, which is really driving innovation elsewhere. So I don't know what your, if that's your take or if you heard.
00:08:00.042 - 00:08:27.350, Speaker A: Anything differently from folks outside of crypto. I heard that it didn't. So, like, my initial take was, wow, Gary really, really whiffed on this. Like, this was a complete botch, kind of like, we got, we got them. But folks who I spoke to outside of crypto, just in kind of like traditional capital markets world, were like, yeah, these things are usually snooze fest. This was more interesting than usual, but, like, it was still a snooze fest. And, like, there was nothing really important that that important that was said.
00:08:27.350 - 00:09:08.404, Speaker A: I thought some of the House Republicans came down super strong on him and, like, did, did a good job, basically. And, like, I think really pushed him. And I think it's abundantly. Here's my one sentence takeaway, is that if it wasn't clear before, it's now abundantly clear that the SEC, specifically the SEC under Gensler, intends to clamp down, maybe even shut down, most crypto related business in the United States. And this includes exchanges on and off ramps. Really, anything that's. I mean, he's just very anti crypto.
00:09:08.404 - 00:09:34.768, Speaker A: I mean, he said that pretty, he said that nearly every token is a security completely waffled on the ETH response. I don't know. It was pretty, it was pretty frustrating. Like, I was watching this, and he had that one, one response where someone asked him if he had ever held crypto. He said he's never held crypto. He's never bought crypto, and he's never used a crypto protocol. And, man, that was just a bummer to hear because he.
00:09:34.768 - 00:09:59.660, Speaker A: That's like, that's like having a regulator in the nineties or the eighties. Say you have to use snail mail, but then admit to never using email, you know? And it's like, if you would just use this stuff, like, go make a trade on uniswap. Go do. Make a $5 trade on uniswap and see how cool of an experience it is. Go buy an NFT on open sea and just, like, see what it feels like. Yeah.
00:09:59.692 - 00:10:28.482, Speaker B: So, yeah, that is. Yeah, I saw your tweet. I mean, that is very, perhaps one of the most surprising things. Right? He even thought, of course, in MIT, I'm like, guys, like, why even go to college at this point? Like, I mean, this is the whole problem that I had in college. It's like, how can someone teach you about risk or something of investing if they haven't invested themselves? Like, I. I feel like this is a common thing, too, among, like, economic professors, finance professors, a lot of them certainly come from industry. A lot of them are also just really so risk averse that they haven't even, like, touched the stock.
00:10:28.482 - 00:10:42.322, Speaker B: And I'm like, well, am I gonna really learn from these people, let alone, like, how are these guys, like, in charge and trying to drive some sort of policy making? So, yeah, very disappointing, candidly. It also.
00:10:42.378 - 00:10:42.826, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:10:42.930 - 00:11:03.698, Speaker B: Almost makes you question, like, how do these people actually get to office in the first place? And the. The interesting thing was, I think when he first got appointed, you know, everyone in crypto was very encouraging. He's like, oh, this guy, like, taught a course at MIT. Like, he's gonna be very pro, you know, crypto, and it's been nothing but.
00:11:03.746 - 00:11:03.930, Speaker A: Right.
00:11:03.962 - 00:11:50.484, Speaker B: And so, yeah, yeah, it's a good segue, I think. I was going to say it was a good segue because this week also, to your point around, I think it's abundantly clear his stance and his kind of intentions towards really clamping down on the. Continue to clamp down on the crypto industry, what Coinbase has done recently today announcing that they've acquired a license to operate in Bermuda. They also, I think Brian was in London meeting with, know, high ranking UK officials to talk about his plans and plans of Coinbase to kind of continue to operate in the UK. And then, you know, there's a bill passed in the European Union parliament, so we can talk about all of that in this broader context of what's going on in the regulatory world.
00:11:50.644 - 00:12:15.926, Speaker A: Yeah, I think Coinbase had a really smart move this week, and I want to get into that in a second. But the, I mean, the Gensler hearing, do you like, when you see this, do you think anything will end up for. I think for us, like, in crypto land, we see this and we're like, man, this was maddening. This was. I mean, he completely botched the answer around. Like, is ETH a security or commodity? There were some, like, remarkable. I think Tom Emmer did a great job.
00:12:15.926 - 00:12:50.984, Speaker A: McHenry really grilled him. Emmer kind of took Gensler to court in terms of, like, his favorable, favorable approach to FTX, the impossibly high cost of compliance that they've put on the crypto industry, the lack of new rulemaking for crypto, combined with these, like, 55 enforcement actions, they've taken his kind of, like, rogue actions outside of congressional authority, like, really took him to court here. Do you think that they're like, I guess we'll have to ask Trevinsky and Rebecca Reddick when they come on the podcast soon. But do you think this changes anything or this is kind of a nothing burger for you?
00:12:52.604 - 00:14:02.414, Speaker B: I don't know. Part of me wants to believe that perhaps two years ago, three years ago, we wouldn't have had this type of, you know, hearing where, you know, you had, like, Hester Pierce and maybe one or two other, you know, officials that were kind of really out there talking about crypto pro crypto. But now, I think what's different now is that you do have one. It's getting a lot of attention, whether people listen to it, you know, or tuning into it. Probably not, right. But nonetheless, I mean, I think you have elected officials, like congressmen, really paying attention to this stuff because their constituents care about it. I got to believe that the reason why we have two, three, four kind of, you know, elected officials really bring this to light and issue emotion to, like, you know, kind of replace the chairman of the SEC is largely driven by someone more junior and his staff saying, hey, this is a really important topic for our constituent base.
00:14:02.874 - 00:14:03.538, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:14:03.666 - 00:14:20.374, Speaker B: So is it going to matter? I don't know. I'm not a political expert. I think it's going to matter more than it has before, which is kind of a may answer, but my hope is that in the leg in the next election cycle, it certainly bears more weight.
00:14:20.834 - 00:14:26.274, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I agree with you. I mean, you have Tom Emmer coming down hard, and, I mean, he's the House majority whip, so it's.
00:14:26.314 - 00:14:37.434, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, that's a great point. It's like, not the fact that he's the whip. I mean it's important, right? It's not like a random or less, you know, I think that carries more weight, I'd say.
00:14:37.594 - 00:15:15.102, Speaker A: Yeah, it's, it's pretty remarkable that the political objectives of the chair of one of these three letter agencies can start to just put companies out of business. Like they're. I mean I want to talk about Coinbase and their push into Bermuda and they were meeting with the UK like you mentioned. But here's what doesn't make sense to me. How is it even possible for. So the SEC approved Coinbase to go public and now they're coming back a year later or two years later and saying that they're operating illegally. That has implications not just for Coinbase but for investors in the public markets.
00:15:15.102 - 00:15:32.982, Speaker A: Right. Why are you allowed, why did they let me buy coin stock, for example? But then, but then, now they're saying they're operating illegally. Right. Like how, how, how's that changed? And why are, why are we letting the political agenda of the SEC chair impact these public companies?
00:15:33.118 - 00:16:13.398, Speaker B: Yeah, I think one of the more important statements from one of these folks was the role of the SEC should be to create an incentivize capital formation and robust capital markets. And to your point just now, that really is very concerning because it sets a precedent of not only. Lets forget about crypto here for a second, just normal companies. Some of the other topics that were discussed was ESG. Im not particularly an expert on what genslers policies towards ESG have been, but that was also a big topic of discussion in the sense that its created. It has harmed capital markets. And by that I think what the regulator should really be focused on is being.
00:16:13.398 - 00:17:29.576, Speaker B: And historically what makes the US great is it's a system that works, it's predictable, it has a rule of law that has multiple checks and balances and by and large that gives investors and civilians and whatnot greater sense of security and certainty relative to other places in the world. If that all of a sudden gets put in question, then you're going to go elsewhere, like the European Union or the UK are going to look at that and I think are looking at that and saying there's a big opportunity for us to be more relevant in a global scale on the innovation front, on attracting investors and capital formation. And so I mentioned this before in this podcast and I would love to talk about it in the regulatory pod in the coming weeks. And the approval of the gold ETF. You know, I guess decades ago the US was very much against approving a gold ETF. And european regulators approved it first, I believe, and then the US saw that there was a big disadvantage and then approved the gold ETF in local markets. I wouldn't be surprised if the same happens in crypto regulation.
00:17:29.576 - 00:18:21.714, Speaker B: And I think you're starting to see it just today, where UK and EU regulators are providing a greater sense of clarity and process, risk providers, companies, investors, whatnot to operate. And that, I think, is going to matter significantly. That might be really the tipping point of what really pushes the US in a more pro crypto stance. And when I say pro crypto, it's not that tomorrow they're going to come out saying, look, nothing's a security or whatever. It's more just the lack of certainty is really what's the biggest problem here. And it's very, I think, uncharacteristic of the US, because most of the time you have a lot of certainty in the US, not in other places. And in this particular case you're not.
00:18:21.714 - 00:18:39.930, Speaker B: And so that, I think, is a new. Whether you want to bucket that in a broader narrative of, like, the US dollar debasement and the fall of the like, I don't want to get there. I think that's too far, far fetched. But it's certainly impacting today. And you're seeing Coinbase is not a small company.
00:18:40.002 - 00:18:40.186, Speaker A: Right.
00:18:40.210 - 00:18:44.298, Speaker B: It employs a bunch of people and so it's going elsewhere.
00:18:44.466 - 00:18:56.874, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, also today you had the Mica, which is the landmark EU crypto regulation, officially just passed the plenary of the EU parliament. So I think we will see that.
00:18:56.914 - 00:19:19.256, Speaker B: Continue to happen on that point. And I'm not an expert on this because I haven't. There's a great Coinbase policy guy that is covering this in particular, and he was supposed to come up with a threat. I haven't seen it, but when that goes, I hope we'll link it in the show notes. Maybe we'll have him on as well to talk about this. It feels like there's a lot of things that are still going to have to be defined in this bill, but.
00:19:19.280 - 00:20:08.190, Speaker A: At least here's my understanding of the NSDA, is that we don't actually know what the regulations. I think it's like step, step one, but like the TL, the one line summary of this is that one of the world's largest markets, the EU, is introducing regulations for crypto to protect users and support innovation. And this is, I think, what we're waiting for in the US now, which is like folks are saying look, if you want to introduce things that will kind of clamp down on crypto, that that's fine. That's totally fine at this point. Just, but, but give us the hard line. Give, give us the details, basically. So I think that's what the, I think that's why this mica bill and the European Parliament voting for it and pushing it through is important is because, like, they're pushing through really clear guidelines that say this is, if you're building a crypto company, this is how you have to operate.
00:20:08.190 - 00:20:11.674, Speaker A: And I think that's. Yeah, absolutely.
00:20:13.274 - 00:20:32.754, Speaker B: Perhaps went out noticed by a bunch of folks. But Hong Kong also now recognizes crypto as property. And so that was an interesting development as well. Just goes to show, places like Hong Kong, Dubai, have really, I think, recognized an opportunity to attract founders and capital that is in crypto.

00:21:18.224 - 00:21:58.104, Speaker A: Empire v a l o R a app a p p velourapp.com Empire all right, let's talk about that. Coinbase news. So this, this week also, Coinbase secured was granted a license to operate in the offshore financial haven of Bermuda as it seeks to diversify its business outside the US. Coinbase is trying to establish an offshore derivatives exchange in Bermuda, which is a british territory, to offer perpetual swaps, to offer perps which have historically been inaccessible in the US due to pretty tight regulatory restrictions. So I'm curious, curious what you make of this push.
00:22:01.004 - 00:22:25.140, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think whether they're going to fill a void that FTX used to have, I don't know. But, yeah, it's pretty interesting that they're moving this direction. And I think some people are speculating that they'll move entirely out of the US. I don't know how that will actually happen. But nonetheless, I mean, I think as part of the lawsuit, you got to think that they're hedging and building multiple avenues in case it really becomes difficult to operate in the US.
00:22:25.292 - 00:22:38.484, Speaker A: Yeah. So on Tuesday, Brian Armstrong was at the innovate Finance global summit, I think that's what it's called. And someone asked him question about relocating, like, could they relocate Coinbase outside the US? And he said, look, anything's on the table at this point.
00:22:39.424 - 00:22:54.364, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Have you heard anything specifically on the loss, on the kind of the court date for this wells notice that they received?
00:22:54.804 - 00:23:17.244, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I haven't. But I heard that. I heard that the SEC is incred. Incredibly over. I talked someone who's very junior there, but they did say that they're very overwhelmed. They're very overwhelmed at the fight that both Ripple and Coinbase are throwing at them. They're trying to stack, stack some wins.
00:23:17.244 - 00:23:32.184, Speaker A: And basically because ripple and Coinbase are fighting them so hard, it's taking up. Everyone who knows about crypto at the SEC is now being put on the Coinbase and ripple, like kind of task force. So I just heard they're overwhelmed with work right now.
00:23:32.224 - 00:23:56.382, Speaker B: Well, I mean, to your point, I do believe that because they also recently launched, what was it, a enforcement action or against Bitrex. So this is like two years to two years late. It was like a complaint of sorts. And so, yeah, I think they're slowly working their way through the stack, perhaps even trying to get easy wins. But, Preston, do you think this was.
00:23:56.398 - 00:24:29.384, Speaker A: A smart move for Coinbase? Because on one hand, the US is openly at war with crypto, and it's like, what other choice does Coinbase have? On the other hand, this offshore derivatives exchange is very off brand for Coinbase. I would say Coinbase has been trusted, reputable brand. And when I hear offshore perps exchange, I'm like, ooh, that's like kind of bitmaxy vibes. You know, it's not really a great, like, it's not really what I would think of when I think of Coinbase. So, like, what, what do you think of this move in general?
00:24:29.884 - 00:24:53.300, Speaker B: Well, first of all, I think the US saying that the US at war with crypto is an unfair statement. It's, let's not confuse the stance of a particular individual with that of the US, because you also, you saw the whip and, I mean, I think there's a lot of political capital that is behind crypto. And sometimes it's difficult and I don't want to conflate it with.
00:24:53.332 - 00:24:53.644, Speaker A: I don't.
00:24:53.684 - 00:25:31.522, Speaker B: I fundamentally, part of me believes, and I'm optimistic, that the US will change course because this country is just built on innovation. And, and I think, you know, there's a reason why Silicon Valley thrived here. And, you know, I think we'll look back at this as like two year, three year blip where, you know, one particular individual, one particular, like, under a particular administration, it wasn't pro particular, you know, crypto, but that's, I don't know, it's a big generalization. So. But yeah, I know you're, look back to the more important point. I don't think it's going to hurt their credibility. Obviously, people think about, oh, look, FDX was operating in Bermuda.
00:25:31.522 - 00:25:44.646, Speaker B: In Bermuda, like, you know, whether we want to, like, I feel like it's unfair to say that's going to hurt Coinbase reposition. If anything, they're taking advantage of a huge void in the market. Like we talked about another episode. Someone's going to come in and fill this gap that FTX had.
00:25:44.790 - 00:25:46.382, Speaker A: What, the, what, the perps market cap?
00:25:46.438 - 00:26:17.898, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, look, finance is doing this. There was talks now, I mean, if you want to. Yeah, they're trying to relaunch FTX, like tribe capital and a few of the existing investors. Look, I've seen crazy. I don't want to dismiss, like, anything here because is it possible that they relaunch it and it works? Yeah. Like, is it possible that we'll all get our money back? Yeah, I mean, crypto's rallied, right? So, like, a lot of things are possible.
00:26:17.898 - 00:26:28.974, Speaker B: But let me ask you a question. What would you ra, where would you rather trade on a relaunched FTX with God knows which management or Coinbase?
00:26:30.714 - 00:26:41.156, Speaker A: Coinbase. Okay. Obviously, yeah. I mean, yeah, I think this is great for the purpose market. Right. Like, if it'll be. I was, I was thinking about what would happen to the, to the market just if finance disappeared.
00:26:41.156 - 00:27:04.704, Speaker A: Right. And there's really no good options. Either you go kind of with the, like, by bit OKX crew, or you go where kind of like, the liquidity sucks, which is like the Bitfinex, Dara Bitmex, or like the kucoin crowd, you know, and you can go on chain, like, you could use Quenta, but, you know, good to have that cross chain collateral.
00:27:04.784 - 00:27:11.920, Speaker B: Um, I don't think it hurts at all. I think it's just increasing their products feet and, you know, so you're pro, you're pro.
00:27:11.952 - 00:27:19.248, Speaker A: This move, this feels like an aggressive move. Uh, also Coinbase tweeted out where more that they're going through this eight week international expansion. Drive.
00:27:19.336 - 00:27:19.672, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:27:19.728 - 00:27:24.416, Speaker A: Um. Cool. I think. I think this is, in many ways.
00:27:24.440 - 00:28:06.202, Speaker B: It'S like, no different than, like, uh, if you look at it at a state level, like, gambling is illegal in some states, but not others. Like, to say that, like, one company expands into another state because one, you know, I mean, it. You know, you don't have. You're basically saying, if this is negative for Coinbase, you're either thinking that because it went offshore, every other company that's gone offshore all of a sudden is sketchy, which is not true, or that perps and these, like, products are inherently bad and toxic, which also is not true, in my opinion, because it just adds to market structure and robustness and liquidity. Like, it allows for the capital formation that is important for just market structure.
00:28:06.338 - 00:28:30.882, Speaker A: Yeah, that's it. Yeah. Us regulators, politicians, got to get it together. I feel like they're just fumbling the bag. Pushing someone like Coinbase offshore, one of the, I think, has the opportunity to be one of the most historic companies of this generation, and we're pushing them offshore. So definitely fumbling the bag. Other things that are interesting this week is definitely slow news week.
00:28:30.882 - 00:29:20.736, Speaker A: Flashbots launched MEV Share. So the highlight of this is I can just read the new summary and then give them my quick take, which is that Flashbots introduced the beta version of the MeV share protocol, which is a permissionless matchmaking protocol. It allows users and searchers to collaborate together and for users to get paid for the MEV that they create. Mev share. If you know Mevboost on, it builds on Mevboost to just continue unbundling the transaction supply chain. And my understanding of Mevboost was that it enabled this collaboration between the validators and the builders, and that Mev share does the same. But for searchers and users, key takeaway here is that I think this is going to be a big theme this year, and we're just going to continue seeing different ways to.
00:29:20.736 - 00:29:45.928, Speaker A: There are two ways to handle Mev. There's, like, the MeV take, which is that you should try to get Mev out of the system and, like, try to minimize Mev. And then there's the MeV take, which is that you should try to just say that, like, okay, Mev is a thing, and we should try to figure out ways to get the MeV back to the user. And Mev share is. Is the latter. This is a. This is a protocol from flashbots that is designed to hand some of the power back to the users.
00:29:45.928 - 00:29:55.834, Speaker A: And my understanding is that now, more and more Mev that's generated by a user's transaction will be as much of that as possible will be returned back to them.
00:29:56.614 - 00:30:43.522, Speaker B: Yup, yup. Pretty cool stuff with those guys are up to. Should we talk about something? I think is a few folks on ease, which is tay from Metamask recently, or there's a few threads that are going on from her that is just. There's an ongoing exploit, and the source of it is still unknown. It has been targeting wallets across eleven different chains, I believe, and they haven't really pinpointed the common denominators or attack vector here, it seems like. And we'll link to this thread. I mean, she initially posted over the week, and I think if you listed a number of wallets and said, hey, if you're the person behind this wallet, get in touch with us.
00:30:43.522 - 00:31:16.400, Speaker B: And then of course it escalated further and said, look, there's. There's an ongoing, like, draining of these wallets. It's happening. It included ogs in the space, include people that are, you know, pretty beefed up on security. So unknown. There's some speculation and theories that it could be related to Lastpass, which is that password manager. You know, if basically, if you've imported that or saved a copy of your private key in a password manager, in this particular case, lastpass, it was compromised, then, you know, that might be one.
00:31:16.400 - 00:31:48.544, Speaker B: One. Cause the other one was these folks have entered their private key on metamask or some other wallet. And so that exposes the. Basically, if the private keys has touched the cloud or the Internet, then it could be problematic. So, yeah, pretty weird. I'd say that we haven't gone to the bottom of it. I think there's an ongoing team that is interviewing and collecting, kind of diagnosing a lot of the affected users.
00:31:48.544 - 00:32:37.332, Speaker B: I think this particular attack has drained over 5000 ETH, and it's been going on for a while, apparently. So I was up late last night, um, reading one thread from a particular individual that, you know, said, hey, look, I panicked. I saw Tay's tweet and I was migrating some of my assets on arbitrum and was detailing how, you know, this person is very, I would say, sophisticated, like top 5%, top 1% in terms of their security practices. Like air gapped computer, you know, particular, like separate computer, just for. For crypto running an operating system. Not windows, not Mac. I forget the exact name, but, you know, pretty, pretty beefed up and knowledgeable.
00:32:37.332 - 00:33:08.094, Speaker B: And I was unfortunate. I think he lost five ETH, but it seems like that. And he then admitted to it after was that he just kind of inputted, like, one of the addresses on to the orbiter bridge contract was whitelisted, and so he kind of just flipped and. And didn't really check. So it was his mistake. Not likely. Not related to this other attack that Tay's talking about, but, yeah, it was.
00:33:08.094 - 00:33:32.508, Speaker B: I'd say it's been. To say that a few of us have been on edge is trying to understand what's going on is a bit of an understatement. I hope we get to the bottom of this fairly soon. And so the thing that we do know, just to kind of wrap this up and let me know if you have other input here, is, seems to be like, old wallets. So maybe it's something related to key generation of these particular wallets.
00:33:32.676 - 00:33:36.732, Speaker A: Now, there are some, though, that were created from in 2020 and 2021, as.
00:33:36.748 - 00:33:39.532, Speaker B: I write, there are some that were.
00:33:39.708 - 00:33:44.252, Speaker A: So, like, the folks getting hacked are like, pretty crypto native, pretty og.
00:33:44.308 - 00:34:16.664, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah. So anyways, what to do is sort of the, in these moments is probably the biggest question the folks have. And, um, I retweeted one particular one, which I tend to agree with this kind of practice, which is, look, don't panic. If you are going to do something, be very vigilant on, say, for instance, you assume, okay, maybe. Maybe there's a zero day exploit in, like, the compromised version of mask. Hit all these users at one point.
00:34:16.664 - 00:35:09.222, Speaker B: What do you do? Right, if you, first of all get a hardware wallet and, you know, if you're not using a hardware wallet, I think this is a good opportunity to then perhaps consider, um, you know, buying a hardware wallet and. And get familiar with how to use it. There are a number of there out there in the market. Um, and, and then as an added step of security, you can use, like, a gnosis safe, which, you know, you could get multiple, say, three or up to, I don't know, say, at a minimum, three hardware wallets separate, each with their own private key, and you have to sign, you know, two out of three or three out of five or whatever logic. And so in the event that one particular private key gets compromised, your assets are still safe, presumably, if the other two or three private keys that have been generated in a secure manner haven't been compromised.
00:35:09.278 - 00:35:09.470, Speaker A: Right.
00:35:09.502 - 00:35:25.474, Speaker B: And so, you know, that's point number one. Point number two is, I think, this Horcrux model that you guys have heard me talk about, you know, that I love Harry Potter, you know, Horcrux just means, you know, Voldemort shredded, you know, split his soul in seven different horcruxes. Same with your wallet.
00:35:25.514 - 00:35:25.738, Speaker A: Right.
00:35:25.786 - 00:35:59.900, Speaker B: You know, you never want to have just all your assets in one particular wallet. Maybe consider splitting them in different places. Right. And so, yeah, those are probably the two biggest, you know, things that I, that I would do. Right. And so the last comment here I'll say is, you know, maybe what I'm thinking is a lot of these guys, people that have been affected even though they created their wallets a long time ago, and they're, yeah, ogs are supposed to be like really crypto native when you're creating a wallet. Back in the day, like, maybe you didn't think much, right? People that minted punks were like, oh, you know, like, I'll, maybe I'll use a hot wallet.
00:35:59.900 - 00:36:23.954, Speaker B: And same with a lot of people are trading their nfts through a hot wallet, by the way, I'm not suggesting you do, but, you know, and then didn't think much of it, and then five years later, those ten crypto punks are worth a pretty penny. Right. And so I think you always need to go back and, you know, adjust your security parameters based on the value that is being secured, you know, so a lot there.
00:36:24.814 - 00:37:00.614, Speaker A: This is a particularly scary, particularly scary one in my mind, because this is, it's people who have, like, every variable, there's people who have touched multiple different VAR. So, like, uh, this isn't just people on a Mac, it's people on Mac and PC. It's not just Android or iOS, it's Android and iOS. It's not just metamask users, it's ledger live, my crypto exodus, electrum, coin eme, coinbase, wallet folks. Metamask. It's not just people who stored keys in cloud storage or password managers. There were people who def, who got hacked, but definitely didn't store the keys in a cloud storage or password manager.
00:37:00.614 - 00:37:25.072, Speaker A: Sometimes they had multiple accounts, sometimes it was only one account. So this is, yeah, this is definitely a concerning one. I think the first thing to do, by the way, Santi, before you go create the Horcrux, just create a new wallet. First things first. Like, if you hold a bunch of coin in one wallet, just go create a new wallet. It takes two minutes. Um, and move your stuff carefully, uh, into that new wallet and minimize where you, you send and store your, your recovery phrase.
00:37:25.208 - 00:37:55.444, Speaker B: And don't keep all your approvals, check your approvals. This happened and was important during the sushi contract to exploit the new master chef that got deployed, you know, always. You always got to check your approvals. Well, as it relates to creating new wallet, I would say create a new wallet under a new private key, not in private key, because if people have access to your private key, then, you know, it doesn't really matter. So. So, yeah, you know, I think. Well, we'll continue to pay attention to this.
00:37:55.444 - 00:38:26.518, Speaker B: If Taylor wants to come on and discuss further, we'd love to have her on. I think she does incredible work for the ecosystem. The important thing here is if you're going to move stuff, always, always, always verify the contract you're interacting with and the receiver. So even if you have a hardware wallet, what happened to this particular person yesterday was he didn't care to. He or she didn't check the two address, send address. And so this has happened. Number of people that are very sophisticated way back in the day.
00:38:26.518 - 00:38:42.582, Speaker B: It happened to Hugh from Nexus, right? He had a compromised version of metamask. He opened an attachment, new, like, corrupted version of metamask, and then that swapped it to address. He didn't check. He was using, like, a claiming transaction. Nothing but him. Boom. You know, like, his wild constraint.
00:38:42.582 - 00:39:12.788, Speaker B: So, yep, always, always, always check the two function. And when in doubt, just take time, breathe, and, like, be calm. I know it's hard. So it makes you wonder, like, this. These are the moments where you're like, yeah, like, crypto is not easy, and every once in a while, like, you have to really pay attention to this stuff. And I certainly become more aware of what happens in the cybersecurity community at large. Like, you know, people that are.
00:39:12.788 - 00:39:29.634, Speaker B: There's, like, a recent security upgrade across iOS, like, that apple had to patch, and it was discovered by this, like, white hacker group. So you have to pay attention to all this stuff. And sometimes it could be. Yeah, could be a bit stressful.
00:39:29.754 - 00:39:30.074, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:39:30.114 - 00:39:34.650, Speaker B: Say, yep. We're not immune to stress. It's.
00:39:34.682 - 00:39:37.654, Speaker A: It's a breath pretty heavy over there. Something.
00:39:38.394 - 00:39:49.004, Speaker B: No, man. I mean, I don't know what to say. Like, I usually. Every time you think you've seen it all in crypto, you're just like, no, no, not.
00:39:49.424 - 00:39:54.644, Speaker A: Yeah. Anything else, man? Um.
00:39:56.624 - 00:40:03.672, Speaker B: I didn't want to. I did want to mention something, but I'm blanking right now.
00:40:03.808 - 00:40:07.506, Speaker A: Don't think too hard. Were you retrading Pepe? Were you.
00:40:07.530 - 00:40:31.362, Speaker B: Uh, no, no. There's, like, this whole discussion around, like, all these altcoins. I've sort of missed the boat on that, to be honest. I wasn't paying too much attention. But apparently it, you know, I think it was a good indicator that the market was feeling a little toppy and frothy. And so, uh, I think the day after Pepe, like, the market just kind of like, like, okay, we've had enough of this irrational exuberance. Let's go down six, 7%.
00:40:31.498 - 00:40:55.680, Speaker A: Yeah, there was a, uh, there was a searcher from, uh, with the Ens address. Jared from subway. Jared from subway. ETH made. Yeah, made 12,000 transactions in a 24 hours span. At one point, Jared from subway was taking up 7% of all the Ethereum block space on Wednesday. I think it was yesterday that this person had a trading volume of 700 million weth or wheat, whatever.
00:40:55.680 - 00:41:06.074, Speaker A: You. I don't know how you pronounce it. 200 million pepe and 100 million wojak. And there was one sandwich that I saw that made. Made a cool, cool. Thirty k. One trade.
00:41:06.074 - 00:41:09.814, Speaker A: So good work. Jared from subway made. Made a million bucks on Tuesday.
00:41:11.034 - 00:41:11.842, Speaker B: Wow.
00:41:12.018 - 00:41:12.690, Speaker A: Yeah. What?
00:41:12.722 - 00:41:36.474, Speaker B: Bear market. Oh, one other, like, minor tidbit. Now I remember. So Tesla apparently is holding, what, 300 and chain million and 300 million or so of bitcoin in the first quarter, because I think the earnings came out, and they haven't touched a single one, so they just kind of keep holding it. So it's really interesting.
00:41:37.014 - 00:41:41.030, Speaker A: Tesla or microstrategy Tesla. Oh, interesting.
00:41:41.182 - 00:41:49.150, Speaker B: I mean, Microsoft holds, like, 1% of all bitcoin, right? Which is way more than that. But no, Tesla has some bitcoin in the balance sheet, and they have.
00:41:49.182 - 00:41:49.422, Speaker A: They.
00:41:49.478 - 00:41:55.514, Speaker B: At least this quarter, when the earnings came out. That was one piece of interesting tidbit that came out.
00:41:57.934 - 00:41:58.914, Speaker A: True wrap?
00:42:00.074 - 00:42:05.314, Speaker B: I think so. Short week. But what are you doing this weekend? Sorry?
00:42:05.434 - 00:42:06.734, Speaker A: What are you doing this weekend?
00:42:07.314 - 00:42:08.614, Speaker B: I'm gonna try to run.
00:42:09.554 - 00:42:10.334, Speaker A: Nice.
00:42:10.914 - 00:42:13.954, Speaker B: I run. I'm just gonna go for a run.
00:42:14.114 - 00:42:15.922, Speaker A: Just give your thoughts. Nice.
00:42:16.058 - 00:42:17.094, Speaker B: What are you doing?
00:42:19.194 - 00:42:21.450, Speaker A: Hanging. Hanging. Relaxing.
00:42:21.562 - 00:42:22.994, Speaker B: Married life, I guess.
00:42:23.154 - 00:42:27.428, Speaker A: Nothing exciting. I'm getting dumplings in Chinatown tonight or tomorrow night.
00:42:27.556 - 00:42:29.348, Speaker B: New York has great dumplings, don't they?
00:42:29.396 - 00:42:36.424, Speaker A: Great dumplings. Yeah. Did flushing, flushing, queens, for some dumplings last week and this week going to Chinatown. So.
00:42:36.884 - 00:42:43.108, Speaker B: So you like big dumpling? Big. What's your favorite dumpling?
00:42:43.236 - 00:42:44.704, Speaker A: I like the soup dumplings.
00:42:45.684 - 00:42:47.556, Speaker B: But, like, what's the inside of the dumpling?
00:42:47.660 - 00:42:49.984, Speaker A: Oh, like a, like a good pork dumpling.
00:42:50.584 - 00:42:51.400, Speaker B: Nice.
00:42:51.592 - 00:42:55.744, Speaker A: Nice. That's been slow. Week is when we're talking dumplings.
00:42:55.864 - 00:43:07.168, Speaker B: I know. Well, I think this is a good way to wrap it up, folks. Whether you like dumplings or not, whether you're going to go running or not. Have a great weekend. And we'll be. We'll be here next week. We have some good lineups next Monday.
00:43:07.216 - 00:43:19.058, Speaker A: We've got a banger. Oh, no, Tuesday, banger of an episode with Doodle. CEO Santi woke up and chose violence that day. Tough interview. I'd say that. That you led there something, you know.
00:43:19.106 - 00:43:40.234, Speaker B: Talking to this point, people, uh, I think people appreciated some of the questions that we've been asking some of our guests. Uh, there was a comment that we were just, like, really all pro crypto and bullish, and we always like to keep a balanced discussion, but sometimes, you know, you gotta ask normal questions, and if those come across as tough. I'm sorry, we're just trying to get to a truth here and, you know, push the space forward. That's all we're really trying to do here, folks.
00:43:40.394 - 00:43:41.674, Speaker A: See you Tuesday, folks.
00:43:41.834 - 00:43:44.334, Speaker B: All right, thank you, everyone, for listening. Have a great weekend.
