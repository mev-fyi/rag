00:00:02.720 - 00:00:13.342, Speaker A: Right now, you can earn 4.8% on us treasuries. That's right, 4.8% on us treasuries. Not in Defi. How do you do that? It's super easy. We just partnered with public.com
00:00:13.342 - 00:00:27.306, Speaker A: dot. Go to public.com comma, open a us treasury account, put your cash to work. You can also get access to a bunch of other things, like stocks, crypto, whole bunch of other assets all in one place. It's super cool. Public.com forward slash empire.
00:00:27.306 - 00:00:43.970, Speaker A: That's public.com forward slash empire. All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Empire. You got me, yanno. We got sam Kasmian from Frax, and then we are, we booted Santiago from this one. We got Dan Smith, senior analyst on the blockworks research team, joining us. So, dan, sam, welcome to Empire.
00:00:44.002 - 00:00:46.214, Speaker B: Guys, thanks for having me.
00:00:46.874 - 00:01:20.582, Speaker A: So, Sam, I'm excited we're chatting, because I feel like I've been blown up with fracs, uh, frac stuff for the last, like, six months. Uh, if you looked in the blockworks research slack channel, it's basically 50% defi and, uh, 50% the rest is just consumed by fracks info. So I'm I'm happy that we're having this conversation. I was, um, I will admit I'm not as in touch with some frack stuff as the analysts are. But as I was researching this, my first thought was, like, I guess kind of found on a founder to founder note. I was like, man, this guy's, there's, there's no focus here. There's no, like, we've got the, like, we've got, got the lending stuff, we've got the stablecoin stuff.
00:01:20.582 - 00:01:43.742, Speaker A: And the more I read about it, the more I realized it's actually completely 180 wrong. There's this core one line vision and mission, and everything that you build ties back to that. So I thought it could be helpful to maybe start there with what is the overarching vision? And all these products that you build, what are they tying back to? And then we can get to some of the more specifics.
00:01:43.878 - 00:02:13.646, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. And I couldn't have said it better. You captured it really well. A lot of people try to learn about fracs, and so they're a little confused because there's so much stuff we've built now. So fracs protocol issues, the best and most innovative stable coins. We're stablecoin maximalists, so to speak. And I'll explain how that view of, like, usually maximalism is not a very positive sum view, but I'll explain why.
00:02:13.646 - 00:02:43.380, Speaker B: I think, you know, stablecoin maximalism is kind of the best of all worlds. Usually when you say like maximalism, it's not really like, oh, everything else is bad or whatever, but fracs build stable coins. Right now we have three stable coins. They have different pegs. That's the fracs stable coin, which is peg to the US dollar. It's FPI, which is crypto's very first CPI. Pegged stablecoin.
00:02:43.380 - 00:03:09.842, Speaker B: It's a pegged basket of consumer items. And then we have frax ether, which is the newest stablecoin that we've launched, which is peg to one ETH. It's literally just peg to one ETH. And so a lot of people call things similar to that LSD's or liquid staking derivatives. And so obviously fracs either has a lot of similarities to LSD's. We'll talk about that, I'm sure. But basically one liner of fracs, it's on our twitter, it's on our community.
00:03:09.842 - 00:03:50.742, Speaker B: We build the best and most innovative stable coins in the crypto space and we build stablecoin infrastructure. And so, like, that's where, for example, Frax lend, frac swap, and also the newest infrastructure we've built for our stable coins called Frax Ferry, which is kind of like a bridge. It's kind of not a bridge. That's why we called it a ferry, because it goes under bridges, but it's bridge like infrastructure for our stablecoin. So a lot of people see this and they're like, oh, the fracs guys are all over the place. They're trying to compete with Aave and then with Frax lend and, and they're trying to compete with bridges with their, you know, funny named Frax ferry stuff. And then they're like trying to compete with Lido, with Frax ether.
00:03:50.742 - 00:04:33.166, Speaker B: No, no, no, we're not doing that. It's like you said, really? Well, it's a very, very narrow scope vision. Like, for example, we don't build NFT marketplaces, right? We don't build like NFT sets or something, or we don't build something really out of left field that has absolutely no synergy with our stablecoin vision and the very narrow and couple few stable coins that we're focusing on. And so every single thing we build is about our stable coins. We build the most innovative stable coins and the most important infrastructure to make them the most indispensable stable coins in defi.
00:04:33.270 - 00:05:02.966, Speaker A: Nice. All right, so overarching vision. Frax build stablecoins, and you've got a couple different stable coins, and you've got all these different mechanisms and products that you've built to support that vision. When I take. Twelve months ago, there were all these on chain, we can call them different things, programmatic, algorithmic, on chain, stable coins. Today, I would say there are four main players. There's USDC, there's tether, there's Dai, and there's the basket of stables that you guys are building.
00:05:02.966 - 00:05:21.488, Speaker A: Then there's a bunch of other players. But why were you guys able to be so. USDC and tether are obviously, like, they're not, like, fully on chain stable, so it's really you guys. Yeah. So why were. Why were you guys able to survive when someone like, I don't know, Tara is probably a bad. I don't even want to lump you guys in with that.
00:05:21.488 - 00:05:27.352, Speaker A: That bucket, but, like, why. Why were you guys able to survive this, like, colossal deleveraging event when other folks weren't?
00:05:27.488 - 00:06:12.548, Speaker B: Yeah. So one thing I like to highlight for everyone that might not be following fracks for, like, the past a year or so is, like, Frax has never lost its peg. Frax is kind of. It's a. It's a hybrid stable coin in terms of, like, different stability mechanisms. But one thing I will actually say is that for our 2023 roadmap, what we're doing with Fracs is that we're actually bringing it to 100% cr completely with completely exogenous collateral. But it will be algorithmic in the sense that all of this infrastructure, all of this on chain stuff that I just talked about, it will run with fracs to stabilize the price back, but it will not have any kind of reflexive collateral.
00:06:12.548 - 00:07:05.540, Speaker B: It'll all be exogenous collateral. And so we've actually made that pretty clear a few times. But to drive home the point, my personal belief is that if you're trying to go for the top dollar, pegged, stablecoin, market share, things like tether, USDC, and things like that, you have to be the closest to the risk free, uh, asset that. That's. That's pegged to the dollar, and you'll. You'll never be the thing everyone flees to in a crisis, whether it's a liquidity crunch, whether it's, like, a recession or things like that, if you're the most risky thing pegged to an asset. So even though we've never broken our peg, obviously, everyone knows right now, de facto, the closest thing to risk free on chain is USDC.
00:07:05.540 - 00:07:42.558, Speaker B: Right. Dai wraps a lot of USDC. We have a lot of USDC exposure on chain. Our AmOs have USDC liquidity, the FRACS BP pool on curve, which is this liquidity pool that other people can pair with and get a lot of FRACs protocol incentives proportional to their TVL that is also paired with USDC. But this is not our long game. Our long game is to actually be as safe as USDC and just as safe as the closest risk free stable coins. And to get there, and to do that, we have to have 100% cr of exogenous collateral, which we are.
00:07:42.558 - 00:08:30.924, Speaker B: That is the top thing on the frac stablecoins roadmap this year. We have some innovative stuff that we're working on in the back with trying to get the closest possible collateral to Fed deposits. The Fed master account system. That kind of stuff has a little bit hard to predict in terms of, like, the timeline, just because it's not really coding related work, even though we're very good at shipping smart contracts, software and things like that. But that's one thing to highlight is I think we've done a really great job showing that we have the technology to stay at PEG, which we've perfectly done. We've survived, like you're saying, the crisis of 2022 with basically crypto deleveraging, macro market deleveraging, global interest rates rising everywhere. Right.
00:08:30.924 - 00:08:57.214, Speaker B: But that's not enough. So, like, we don't actually want to just pat ourselves on the back and be like, okay, great, we're awesome too. We don't have to improve anything. No. We're going to consistently try to make fracs the safest stable coin won't happen overnight, but we have very consistent plans to make it the closest thing as possible to the risk free kind of stablecoin like USDC.
00:08:59.634 - 00:09:30.674, Speaker C: So diving deeper into how are we going to get the Fed deposits backing fracs? What is the plan to making that possible, and how realistic is that to actually get there? Because if I think about the United States government working directly with an on chain protocol, there seems to be a gap there in their willingness, just given the risk of them taking that on. But ultimately, the way you could view it from the other side is, well, this is a huge source of demand for us treasuries, and that's something that the Fed would ultimately be interested in.
00:09:31.134 - 00:10:22.806, Speaker B: Yeah, usually I don't really like to speculate around regulatory stuff because it's so hard to know. Right. We're obviously trying in the background and things like that. You know, we're very attuned to what kind of regulations are coming or not coming, right? Like the bills that are in Congress, like the stablecoin act that like Senator Toomey proposed last year. But it's still not really up for voter or any, anything close. But like, for example, that was really bullish, right? Like, that actually had a pathway where stablecoin issuers can actually apply for FMA, like the Fed master account. But I don't usually like to speculate because, you know, we don't really know how long it'll take, but I think.
00:10:22.806 - 00:11:17.570, Speaker B: I think it's going to happen, right? Like, for example, USDC has a direct relationship with Blackrock, who manages their. Their collateral, right? And BlackRock has direct access to the Fed's reverse repo facility, which is de facto also just another way to essentially get essentially direct access to the Fed being your only counterparty. And so they are working towards essentially, what's the same thing? I think it's set up. It might not be fully live yet, but they're working towards the same structure. The same structure being basically, in order for you to be the closest thing to the risk free asset when it comes to the dollar on chain, you have to be the closest thing where your only counterparty is the issuer of the dollar, right. The issuer of the thing that you are pegging to, which is issued by the Federal Reserve. Right.
00:11:17.570 - 00:11:42.182, Speaker B: You can't have like 20 different middlemen in between or like 20 different, like rehypothecated. Like, you know, this is a deposit of. A deposit of. A deposit of like, this entity's deposit, but it's a dollar, right? And then at the end it, like, backs USDC. Or like your. Yeah, it's stablecoin, right. It'll never work because something will end up being the risk free thing everyone flees to.
00:11:42.182 - 00:13:03.824, Speaker B: Right? And if the peg is the US dollar, my personal belief, and I think the facts line up with this, is that at scale, if your peg is the US dollar, you are not going to escape government regulation through either fake or genuine decentralization. It just will not work at scale. At scale, meaning in the tens of billions, in the hundreds of billions of dollars of supply. If your peg is the USD, if it's something else, like maybe it's a basket of consumer items, which again, we have FBI. If it's something else, if it's an ETH peg or something, it should be able to be totally possible to have a fully decentralized, fully on chain stablecoin that does not have any custodial risk or real world asset risk or like has to bow to like regulatory pressure or anything off chain because it's like bitcoin, it's like ethereum, it's the smart contracts actually can work and sustain it on chain. In a fully digital economy, if your stablecoin is pegged to a sovereign country's unit of account, which they can issue at size, there is no evidence that you can escape government regulation or that you should. There's just no evidence.
00:13:03.824 - 00:14:44.956, Speaker B: I would love to talk to other people about how that's possible. I know there's a lot of people that say that use x, y and z tiny, tiny market cap stablecoin, that's like pegged to the US dollar because it's fully decentralized or whatever, that doesn't work, right? Like we know that unless there's a very secret stability mechanism for pegging something that no one's yet discovered, and someone's going to discover it and it's going to be beautiful. And you can at scale peg to whatever unit, because there's just this beautiful mathematical on chain stability mechanism which I don't think exists. But unless that's the only way you could do it, is like some kind of brand new thing, it's not possible. Otherwise there's no way you can escape. And so that's why I think you don't have to over comply, right? Like you don't have to like basically, you know, have like white lists and double black lists and like be like, you have to KYc to touch my fiat stable coin or. So you basically have to be reasonable, right? You have to basically say, if I want this stable coin, that my protocol issues are, in USDC's case, my company issues or something, and the next five to ten years, I genuinely want this thing to be in the hundreds of billions of dollars, if not trillions, truly in the next decade, you're not going to escape just being adversarial to regulation if your peg is the US dollar.
00:14:45.150 - 00:15:05.248, Speaker A: Sam, can I try to repeat back to you almost what I feel like? I feel like you've come to the conclusion over time that real world assets are crucial and necessary for the success of a decentralized stablecoin. But also you've come to the conclusion that the only real world asset that you should have as collateral is a fed deposit.
00:15:05.336 - 00:15:08.496, Speaker B: Yes. Okay, 2nd, 2nd part, second part.
00:15:08.560 - 00:15:11.552, Speaker A: True. So maybe. So like I spend.
00:15:11.648 - 00:15:39.596, Speaker B: Let me clarify that. If I, there's a thought that the next great bull market or something is going to be real world assets that come on chain and stuff. And I think that part is true. I think that's great. There's going to have to be real world assets. There's going to have to be all of this stuff which I'm personally bullish about. I think stuff like fracs, lender lending markets and stuff should think about lending against these kinds of assets.
00:15:39.596 - 00:16:36.504, Speaker B: However, I think if you're going to back your stable coin with various real world assets, like loans to private companies or things like that, you look like a commercial bank. That's what commercial banks do. That is not the risk free asset or the closest thing to the risk free asset on chain. What's going to happen is that if you are a stablecoin issuer that's going to back your thing with bunch of commercial paper or like real world asset tokenized commercial paper or whatever you want to call it, well, you're going to end up wrapping a very, very large amount of your supply with either the stablecoin that is only treasuries and fed reverse repo contracts or FMA deposits, or you're going to have to do it yourself as well. Right. And so that's what you see in reality. You see the market.
00:16:36.504 - 00:16:52.568, Speaker B: You can have many different opinions. We could just look at the actual empirical evidence on chain and on the markets and that's what's going to happen. We don't want to actually lend to private, you know, stuff like you don't want to lend to private companies, car companies, this or that.
00:16:52.616 - 00:16:55.192, Speaker A: You're just creating another commercial bank there. You want to use it.
00:16:55.248 - 00:17:01.724, Speaker B: Exactly. We want to be the closest thing to risk free, like USDC. That's our end goal.
00:17:03.064 - 00:17:22.887, Speaker A: Everyone, quick break from the show to tell you about us treasuries. That's right. Bet you didn't say, see that one coming. Us treasuries right now can earn up to 5%. I think the exact number is like 4.8% right now. I have never, I'll be honest with you all, really thought about investing in US Treasuries, I think for mainly two reasons.
00:17:22.887 - 00:17:51.224, Speaker A: One is the yields were always super low. It was like half a percent or 1%, maybe even 2%. Now it's 4.8%, which is kind of a no brainer. But the second big reason is that I don't know if any of you have been to the US treasury website, but it feels like it was built, like built for Netscape, like built, you know, for like in the 1990, 519, 90, 619 97 period. It's like such a clunky website. Really didn't trust sending my money there, and honestly just had no idea how to navigate it.
00:17:51.224 - 00:18:17.094, Speaker A: Now, I'm super excited to share that we've partnered with Public.com. They have made buying us treasuries super easy. You can move your cash into their us treasury account right from your phone and start earning 4.8% today. There's no minimum hold periods, no settlement delays. You can access your cash whenever you want. They also automatically reinvest your t bills at maturity, so you don't have to do anything to continue growing your yield.
00:18:17.094 - 00:18:39.982, Speaker A: Not only do they have access to these, you know, to 4.8% yield through their treasury account, but you can also trade stocks, crypto, even fractional shares of fine art and other collectibles all in one place. Super, super interesting platform. Very excited to use them. If you guys also want to use them, you can go to public.com forward slash Empire. That's public.com
00:18:39.982 - 00:18:57.292, Speaker A: empire. Head over to public.com empire. I'm telling you guys that URL because I got to get credit for this. Move your cash into a treasury account today. Hope you guys enjoy it. So what do you think of? I'm curious to get what you think of.
00:18:57.292 - 00:19:27.558, Speaker A: I was going to say maker, but actually, when you look at the C five companies of the 2016 to 2021 era, I'd call them, they all started with a different strategy. Some people started with the anchorages and bitgos and copper started as custodians. Blockfi and Celsius and Nexo started with lend and borrow, stuff like that. Coinbase. Other people started as an exchange. But as you build, you all kind of, they all built towards the same thing. The exchanges rolled out custody, custody rolled out lend and borrow.
00:19:27.558 - 00:19:54.426, Speaker A: Lend and borrow. Like, blockfi rolled out their own exchange, and they all kind of ended up building the same thing. Uh, I see this happening in Defi where, and I think it. I think either you or someone else has called it the trinity, where, like, the liquidity providers end up creating a stable coin. So I saw, you know, Aave created their own stable coin. You guys created, like, a lending service, like, so I see this happening as well in Defi. I'm curious what you think of maybe we'll start specifically with maker.
00:19:54.426 - 00:20:05.874, Speaker A: Like, when you see maker doing. There's a big debate inside of maker where I spend a lot of time with, like, real world assets right now. What do you think of the real world asset? Like, on maker debate going on right now?
00:20:06.034 - 00:20:59.964, Speaker B: Yeah. First of all, yeah, I think that was, that was me. I don't want to take like complete credit, but like, that was the trinity kind of ideas. Like, you just, you just see this kind of financial natural selection, right? This financial, of, of there is some kind of, you know, facts out in the real world, right? And markets discover them, right? The other way to think about it is like, like physical physics laws, right? Like f equals ma existed in the world and then Isaac Newton discovered it one day, right? Same thing with financial laws of physics, so to speak, right? I'm a very big believer of that. Like, there's a structure, right? There's kind of this, like. So I was a philosophy major and a neuroscience major in college. So, like, my philosophy size, like, there's, there's basically like a platonic form of markets.
00:20:59.964 - 00:21:56.304, Speaker B: Or if you, if you prefer like, like a hegelian structure to markets. And then like, people discover them, like the market as a whole structures around the truth, basically. And the truth is, defi is something like stable coins, lending and liquidity. Everything is different flavors of these kinds of banking activities. You can build them autonomously without any custodial trust, like maker with the stablecoin side and the lending side, like compound and Aave, like Frax lend. Or you can build them with the custodial trust, and that's CFI type stuff like USDC, right? And like Celsius and stuff with the lending. I think what's going to happen is that the most useful kind of activity is going to become like a winner take most market.
00:21:56.304 - 00:23:01.090, Speaker B: And that's why you see stuff like Ave releasing a stable coin curve, releasing CRV USD, because they're already dominant in one area, right? And the only place that they have to go is to expand to the other area, which is stablecoins and lending, so that they can increase their market share. This is all just banking activity, but just in a new generation, the digital generation, the crypto generation. That's how I think about it. The reason frax is just really, like I was saying, stablecoin, maximalist in terms of mindset, is that I think at the end of the day, the most useful and the most profitable part of all of this infrastructure is the ability to generate a liability that people use as their currency. And that's where most of the money or the value will be generated. The other stuff is infrastructure, and you need them. You need that infrastructure.
00:23:01.090 - 00:24:15.698, Speaker B: It doesn't make them not important, they're critical. But in order for you to be able to be as important, like systemically important, we talk about c five banks and stuff being systemically important. If you're going to get large enough to become very important, you need to be able to issue your own liability that people use as currency or the asset in place of. And what I mean by use as currency is, I mean to hold that in spot, spot demand. Spot means just holding it in your wallet or like just sending it as payments without expecting an interest rate to be paid, right? If you issue a stable coin, whether it's pegged to ETH, whether it's back to USD, whether it's back to anything, and another entity issues a stable coin. But people always prefer to hold spot, the other stable coin, because they have spot demand, aka demand as money, that other people call us monetary premium. You always have to pay some interest rate in order for people to leave that currency, which they use for with 0% paid to them, right, to go and just hold yours, right? And you see this, for example, like Dai has a lot of monetary premium.
00:24:15.698 - 00:25:19.912, Speaker B: It was the first decentralized stable coin. And a lot of people projects, daos and stuff just hold daisy as a decentralized currency. Fracs is also starting to get that. But Dai is older, Dai has more monetary premium right now. And that's why, for example, the maker can go to USDP Paxos, and it can go to these other stable coins, fiat stable coins, and it can say, hey, we will hold $500 million of Paxos if you guys pay us some interest. Because no one else is using Paxos, for example, as money, as spot, right? And so in order for Paxos to have anyone use its own, I mean, Paxos probably does have a little bit, right? But not anywhere near as much as dai. So in order for people to, for Paxos to get any kind of demand, it has to pay an interest rate, right? It essentially needs makers permission to hold it so that it can kind of make money on its like collateral on its treasuries, right, and pay some of it out to maker.
00:25:19.912 - 00:25:59.694, Speaker B: So essentially, if you issue currency, if you're a stable coin issuer like maker like for, which is our entire vision and goal, you need to be able to be good at creating long term spot demand for your issuance of your liability. That's the ultimate thing. Nothing else is measured in terms of how much fees do you make or how much this or that. It's how much monetary premium does your stablecoin, does your liability have compared to other people's same pegged stablecoin? And that's the ultimate test, basically.
00:26:00.114 - 00:26:34.190, Speaker C: Yeah. This seems like a great time to peel back a layer and get into the crypto economic side of things, specifically as it relates to fraxis, because you guys used a very interesting two token model here, and it almost allows you to measure that monetary premium that the asset has. So Frax ether, FRX ETH, that actually accrues no staking rewards, and you have to actually opt into the staking rewards. So can you just walk us a little bit quickly through what that model looks like and then specifically how that enables you to measure this monetary premium that flows through the base asset, the stablecoin pegged Frax ether.
00:26:34.342 - 00:27:14.344, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. So, Frax Ether, FRx ETH is our newest stablecoin, and a lot of people were confused by the design. I think now a lot of people are getting it, which is really cool, which, it's a two token design. And what Frax ETH is, it's. It's always backed by at least one ETH, either invalidators that are currently run by the team. Eventually anyone can spin up validators and stuff, but they're ETH backed invalidators, or ETH that is in different amos. Right now, there's only a curve Amo that manages the protocol owned liquidity.
00:27:14.344 - 00:27:44.606, Speaker B: And essentially, the idea is that there's two tokens. One, like you're saying exactly, Dan. There's frax ETH that gets no interest itself if you hold it. It's not rebasing, it's not interest bearing. It doesn't do anything. There's places that you can use it. For example, we do actually have incentives for you to lp on it curve also has a gauge, which we make sure to upkeep with good bribes, incentives, and things like that.
00:27:44.606 - 00:28:17.318, Speaker B: There's other places, other chains now actually have frax ETH liquidity pairs, which we do help them with incentives and we do partner with them and things like that. But the idea is, it's just an ETH peg stable coin. You just mint it one to one with ETH. The fracs ether protocol takes most of the ETH and just stakes it in validator. So it kind of looks like an LSD, a liquid staking derivative, like lido, like rocket pool and things like that. It's not really, because that's why we keep saying it's a stable coin. It's an ETH pegged stablecoin.
00:28:17.318 - 00:29:03.834, Speaker B: But most of the ETH is invalidators, because that's the closest thing to the, as close as you can get to the risk free rate of interest. Paid out by the issuer of ETH, which is the Ethereum protocol, the Ethereum network, the Ethereum blockchain, a lot of it goes to validators. Then what you could do with Frax ether is you can go and you can stake it in the pos vault. This is called the sfracs ETH vault, the stakefrax ether vault. And that gets all the validator rewards that our validators are earning. So all of the validator rewards minus the protocol fee goes directly to that vault. And so you get out the second token called sfraxy staked frax ether, and that is interest bearing.
00:29:03.834 - 00:29:39.764, Speaker B: That like the virtual price of that goes up. You can use that a 4626 compliant, very gas efficient token that you can use it for lending. You can do a lot of stuff that's like very, very, very efficient for those specific things, for interest bearing places. And that's great. So it's just fracs ether that's interest bearing. It's staked in the POS vault and that's it. So it gets like seven to 8% APR, which is higher than other kind of LSD's because there's other people doing other things with the fracs ether token that inert stable coin, like providing liquidity, like using it in different places.
00:29:39.764 - 00:30:57.040, Speaker B: We've actually had people already messages for integrating it in different places. And the ultimate goal, as funny and lofty as it kind of sounds, is that after Shanghai, so after withdrawals are open, we want to have frax ether be a replacement for weth, which is the rapt ETH Erc 20 just compliant rapt ETH token in as many places as possible. If we can have extremely deep liquidity in a lot of places, a very deep curve pool to kind of bypass the small kind of variable wait time of the withdrawal queue, right. Then you can have deep liquidity that can always be swap fracs ETH for ETH, right? So people can still pay gas and things like that. But you have this very highly efficient gas optimized ERC 20 compliant ETH token that's always one to one backed, extremely deep liquidity on like curve uniswap and stuff. And that is what hopefully a large amount of the defi community will be using as a replacement for we in the long term, obviously, like in the one, two, three year term. But it goes back to the view again of in order for you to be successful as a stable coin issuer, no matter what your peg is, people have to want to use your thing as spot demand.
00:30:57.040 - 00:31:40.566, Speaker B: They need to be making spot liquidity with it or just holding it as spot, you have to want to actually hold it without getting paid some like exorbitant, like unsustainable yield and things like that. Otherwise you'll like dump it for whatever the risk free closest thing to risk free stable coin is by some other issue. Right. And so the important thing here is a lot of people call Frax ETH an LSD. It's probably more accurate to call S Frax ETH the LSD, the staked frax ether, because that thing is the one that is, is the interest bearing thing. And that it's getting all of the proof of stake validator yield and fracs. Ether is just an ETH packed stablecoin.
00:31:40.566 - 00:32:34.396, Speaker B: It's actually the first kind of hybrid LSD kind of thing with the vision being it's just ETH money, it's an ETH stablecoin. And what we can do with it is actually very unique. People haven't even considered what some of the stuff we're thinking about doing with it in terms of the weth replacement program, we call it weather. And the idea is that in order for us to have this be successful in the future, we basically need to get people to want to pair with frax ether. And also we're going to want to make sure that everyone is positive. Some view that this is not some kind of zero sum. If it frax ether replaces, we think stuff like leidos steeth or rocket pools wreath or something like that is going to lose out.
00:32:34.396 - 00:33:16.298, Speaker B: In fact, something we're exploring because Frax ether is like a stable coin. We can partially back Frax ether with wreath and steeth. Again, if they're. They should be super safe, which they are their leading LSD tokens, right? And currently, both of them are indeed larger than Frax ETH. They're much older, but they are larger and so they are quite safe. So we can actually back Frax ether with Reith and steeth, partly depending on the weights and the stuff that makes it the most useful as an ETH stable coin. So we are kind of trying to have this kind of stablecoin be the kind of successor to weth, so to speak.
00:33:16.298 - 00:34:32.146, Speaker B: And we want to make sure that everyone knows that we can make the closest thing to the risk free closest thing. I'm not saying obviously, like there's no such thing as risk free caveat, but the closest thing to a risk free replacement to we by backing it with the top blue chip, LSD's backing it with steeth partial wreath. And so as Frac seeth grows, so does wreath, so does steeth. Right. And so it's a very positive sum view because we're not trying to destroy market share. In fact, we're trying to think of it like once Shanghai is open, withdrawals are open. How can we make sure that the total amount of staked ether for everyone, not just on like Frax's validators or something, but for everyone, grows as much as possible? I'm personally of the opinion that once withdrawals are open, instead of ETH price dumping, which is like a lot of what people like fud about and stuff, ETH price is actually going to increase nominally, obviously, given if like the macro conditions in the economy stay the same and don't get worse or something, right? But all things being the same, I think ETH price will actually dramatically rise after Shanghai.
00:34:32.146 - 00:34:56.768, Speaker B: Not investment advice, because ETH essentially becomes interest bearing. Right now, ETH is not really interest bearing because there's this huge, like, time horizon risk, right. The week before Shanghai, the East devs could be like, oh, like something huge happened or something. We're going to push off Shanghai eight months or six months. There's no withdrawals. Right. You still have this kind of like risk where all lsds are kind of bond like, right? There's like a discount.
00:34:56.768 - 00:35:27.236, Speaker B: Steth is like a center to fluctuate ReIth all of these things. And so it's not really an interest bearing asset, right. ETH is not an interest bearing asset currently. But when Shanghai and withdrawals are open, ETH becomes de facto an interest bearing asset. You need an ETH stable coin that kind of captures this monetary premium. We're hoping that it's going to be like frax ether because we've designed the whole system to be like that. But the fact that ETH essentially becomes interest bearing should increase its nominal price.
00:35:27.236 - 00:36:03.864, Speaker B: Right? If you think about it, if that's why increasing the Fed rate makes dollars more valuable, the price of things come down. Right. If ETH becomes de facto interest bearing, the price of ETH should go up relative to other things. So I actually think post Shanghai, all other things equivalent, which is not a given, but all other things equivalent, I think the price of ETH should dramatically rise and it'll slowly, obviously, like meet the time horizon. It's not like after Shanghai, it's going to pump 20% in one day. Once the event horizon is known like that, there's not going to be any delays, there's not any issues and stuff. There should be a dramatic price.
00:36:03.864 - 00:36:07.564, Speaker B: You could argue that that's actually what's currently happening.
00:36:08.144 - 00:36:45.314, Speaker C: Yeah, I was about to say the recent price action is making me think anything's possible. But it's clear the similarities between fracs and Frax ether are actually strikingly similar. And it's clear that building out Fracs has really assisted in building out what frax ether is, what it can become. But one thing I want to hit on is the interesting bootstrapping mechanism you use when a user comes to Frax and says, hey, I want to mint one frax ethereum, the user provides one ETH, and it's actually 90%. So 0.9 of that ETH is used to spin up validators, and 0.1 is used for peg stability.
00:36:45.314 - 00:37:17.570, Speaker C: And so that 0.1 ETH is what I want to focus on here, because that gets deposited into the curve pool where Frax ETH finds its deepest liquidity. And so what this does is it helps build strong additional confidence in the asset. Obviously, these stable coins need a strong peg, but it also generates additional income that then gets used for liquidity bribing. And that kind of spins up a flywheel of attracting more liquidity. So if you could walk us through what that looks like. There's been some recent discussions on Twitter around, like, the safety of this, and I'd like to get your take on that side of it as well.
00:37:17.570 - 00:37:32.814, Speaker C: Right? Because what happens if the curve pool imbalance shifts? And, like, this isn't, like, it's not backed by frax Ether is no longer backed by just ETH, right? It's 90% ETH and 10% an LP token that involves ETH and Fraxie.
00:37:33.114 - 00:38:00.516, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. So that's exactly the case, right? Right now, there's 0.9 for every one ETH. So 90% goes to validators, which backs ether, and then ten goes to actually 10% or 0.1 ETH for every ETH goes to curve. And it's protocol controlled liquidity. A lot of people have a hard time doing kind of the virtual math about it.
00:38:00.516 - 00:39:01.394, Speaker B: And so, like, they. They think, okay, this is kind of risky or something like that. And the answer is two things. One is, as long as the ETH is added single sided, if. If the imbalance is more if it's under peg, right? If ETH is added single sided from the protocols market operations, if Frac's ETH is under peg, the collateral ratio actually rises above 100%. Right? Because think about it. If you add single sided ETH and fracs, ether is under peg, you're buying back your own liability at under the peg price, right? So the first thing people that are, like, thinking about this, that are listening should think about the economics, is if you add single sided ETH to a amm pool like curve and the stablecoins peg is under the desired peg, you're actually rising the Cr above 100%.
00:39:01.394 - 00:39:35.742, Speaker B: That's number one. Number two is if the stablecoin is perfectly at peg, let's say it's like 50 50. If you're adding, let's say, 100 ETH, you can actually, in the market operations contract also mint 100 fracs ether to pair it 50 50 together. So in total, you add 200 tokens, 100 ether, and 100 fracs ether. This is what confuses everyone. This is what people are like. Oh, so it is really under collateralized.
00:39:35.742 - 00:40:05.758, Speaker B: I knew there was some kind of hocus pocus black magic going, it is under back. It's not. It's hard for people to do simulated math. If you think about this situation, there are more fracs ether, literally on the blockchain, right. In this example, you add 100 ETH and 100 fracs ETH into the curve pool because it's perfectly 50 50. Recall that if it was under peg, you just added single sided ETH. Single sided.
00:40:05.758 - 00:41:02.870, Speaker B: And you rise the CR above 100 because you're buying back frac ether at under peg. If you add these 50 50. Think about this. Anyone that wants to take out a fracs ether token from the curve pool at the peg, they are sending in one ether, plus a small fee into the LP, right? And now the protocol, or the LP token holders, they own that one ETH that is now in their possession, and the user has one frac ether of possession, right? So the CR remains exactly at 100%. In fact, it slightly goes above 100% because there's like a tiny, tiny fee, but from transaction fees. Right? But the CR, in all instances, stays the same. So we came up with this, like, right, originally, like you're saying, from the fracs dollar pegged stablecoins curve amo, we came up with these virtual calculations.
00:41:02.870 - 00:41:32.550, Speaker B: In fact, the curve amo does these virtual Cr calculations on chain. If you look at the fracs stablecoins curve ammo, you can literally call a view function. That's like, what is the actual claims of collateral on all the LP tokens that the AMO contract has? It's actually very elegant. And so it actually does all of it. It depends on the a factor. And it's not like if the a factor is different, the CR will go below 100. That's not true.
00:41:32.550 - 00:42:43.602, Speaker B: It depends on the a factor, because you have to know when and how quickly the CR actually goes above 100. Because if this a factor is very, very large, right? If it's like 5000 a factor, even as the curve pool gets more and more imbalanced, you're still swapping at a one to one rate. It's almost like a one to one minting and redemption function, essentially, right? And so you intake the a factor as a dependent variable, whatever it is, from the pool, you actually simulate all the swaps, and then you say, okay, how much, in the worst possible case, if someone just buys out all of the frac ether, do I have I as the AMO? Do I have claims on collateral? In fact, the CR, in this situation, rises. The thing you're calculating is how much does the CR rise rather than how much does it go down. So it's actually just an example of things that look one way are actually exactly the opposite. And in fact, it's good that people are questioning. And in fact, there's a lot of people that have actually looked at fracs, the dollar pegged stable coins, Amos and things like that.
00:42:43.602 - 00:43:10.578, Speaker B: And it's, you know, they're like, oh, this is really cool. After I actually took a look, you know, it's all open source, right? Unlike, you know, Terra and other stuff, we don't do any kind of like, market making ever. We don't send things to like jump or winter mutual. We don't do any centralized fracs as a dow. Nothing we do is off chain. So, like, there's no. There's no hiding anything, right? And so, in fact, if you don't believe something, go and investigate it.
00:43:10.578 - 00:43:53.058, Speaker B: Ideally, don't make like a weird tweet about how first you think it's like super, like, suspected stuff, and it turns out, like, you actually don't understand it. You could, which is usually people's favorite thing to do. But been checked, obviously, don't trust me, verify, but also don't tweet and then verify. Right? Like, first verify and then. But the idea, the point here is a lot of stuff that might look one way actually are exactly the opposite. When you tell someone, actually, this raises the cR. They're like, their mind is blown sometimes, right? Rather than, oh, this makes it like a algo Ponzi under collateralized thing.
00:43:53.058 - 00:44:21.830, Speaker B: But the opposite is also true, too. People should really be careful. So I like the skepticism, and it's really good. Things that look fully backed or like, the things that intuitively originally are like, oh, this is totally safe. Might be really, really messed up in the back once you really do the accounting. Just like how this looks kind of weird when you look at it, but it's actually becoming over collateralized slowly rather than under collateralized. The opposite is also true.
00:44:21.830 - 00:44:28.608, Speaker B: So we like the fact that everyone is doing their part and not trusting but verifying.
00:44:28.776 - 00:45:08.988, Speaker A: Sam, I want to pull us back out for a second just because I have two overarching. I have two maybe higher level questions for you. One is, do you ever. So you talked about these business rules or free market rules or whatever. One thing that I feel like is true in business is going niche, tends to going niche, and then once you capture, tends to win. And then I think a good business strategy is like, go niche, capture the niche, win the niche, and then expand out. Do you ever think that the better strategy would be to, like, Lido? Lido is just focused on liquid staking, and they've, like, dominated that market.
00:45:08.988 - 00:45:36.748, Speaker A: Or like, USDC circle used to do all these things. Remember back in 2017? They had, like, one of the biggest OTC desks. They had the retail app, they sold everything, and then they just focused on USDC, and they've been able to win so far, at least the stablecoin market. Do you ever think, like, hey, maybe we should. I'm not trying to tell you how to do things, obviously, but I'm like, there's another world where you try to, like, dominate one market and then go into another market and then go into another market instead of doing all these different things. I'm just. I just want to.
00:45:36.748 - 00:45:39.604, Speaker A: I don't even know the question there. I just want to hear your thoughts on that.
00:45:39.764 - 00:46:22.030, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I totally agree. I think the difference is that we think that narrow market is stable coins. Just strictly stable coins. Like, not nfts, not like a blockchain phone or something. I think Solana is doing that somehow or something. And the reason is that if you look, for example, people have this categorical issue, I think, or they're either too narrow or they're too broad, which is what I think you're criticizing correctly, is like, for example, no one tells Binance or Coinbase. You should just focus on the spot market, your centralized exchange.
00:46:22.030 - 00:46:55.322, Speaker B: You should just focus on just the spot market. Because in their mind, a centralized exchange is basically like a lot of custodial services, like leverage, fiat on off ramp, and swapping tokens and all these things. It's not just the spot order book. Right. Otherwise you'd have people being like, oh, I don't like the fact that like binance is, you know, doing a launch pad and then BSc, its own blockchain and all this stuff. They have a conception of centralized exchanges. Just, they do a bunch of stuff that's custodial in nature.
00:46:55.322 - 00:47:54.674, Speaker B: That's what it means, right? I think because it was really hard from a technical perspective to build a lot of original defi primitives, people think that, oh, like an am is just its own like market segment. And like you just, you should just focus on like an amm or like a lending thing contract like Aave or compound that matches borrowers and lenders, that's just its own industry. And you should just, you know, kind of stay in your lane or something like that. Or like if, if you issue like a stable coin, right? Like maker with, with Dai, you should just do that. And the issue is, those are all the same thing. At least that's my view. And the reason we're working on infrastructure like Frax lend, frac swap and Frax ferry to basically support our stable coins.
00:47:54.674 - 00:48:37.670, Speaker B: If you think about it, we've been very consistent. We're not making Frax ferry, this generalized token bridge come and bridge your, you know, uni tokens or like MKR tokens. And we're never planning on doing that, right? Like we're very methodical in the scope. Our scope is just something that people intuitively think is, is too much. But I think they're going to come to realize, and as you said very well, like curve is issuing a stable coin, Aave is issuing a stable coin. And all this stuff people are going to intuitively realize in like the next six to 18 months. Oh, actually those were the same thing, right? They are the same scope.
00:48:37.670 - 00:49:02.504, Speaker B: Like we're not built, we're not trying to compete with Opensea or blur or like, you know, Yuga labs with, with like nfts and in game fine stuff, right? We're competing with like, I wouldn't really say competing, but we're in the same area as basically like serious finance with, with blockchain, non custodial primitives. That's basically what the scope is.
00:49:03.004 - 00:49:41.734, Speaker A: Okay, so my next question would be, so there's this blockchain trilemma, right, which is security decentralization, scalability in stablecoins. I feel like you also have a similar trilemma, which is decentralization, scalability, and then replace security maybe with stability, the price stability. And I think there have been a couple of different models so far of decentralized stable. So like USD, excuse me? Ust they were like decentralization plus really scalable, but they didn't have the stability. So they deep. Then. Like LUsd is decentralized and super stable, but they can't scale.
00:49:41.734 - 00:50:17.602, Speaker A: And then there's Dai and fracs, which I'd say are really stable, really scalable, but there's probably like risk from USDC. Um, because like, right, you're, you mentioned like the risk free, risk free rate or risk free asset in deFi. And right now USDC is that risk free asset. And that's like Dai and fracs kind of have like underlying USDC risk. So you guys, there's two different strategies. Like I'd say Dai is starting to, is look, going down this kind of real world asset route where like they're starting to be like backed more and more by loans from private companies with like these intermediaries. And like people are trying to figure it out a little bit.
00:50:17.602 - 00:50:41.294, Speaker A: Fracs, on the other hand, the way I'm hearing it from you, tell me if any of this is wrong, is like you're planning to hopefully get this Fed master account where you can get fed deposits and that's like, that's a trillion dollar idea right there. Like, that is a. I see the vision. I totally get it. Isn't it contingent, though, on getting the Fed account? Like, what happens if you can't get the Fed account?
00:50:42.714 - 00:50:45.854, Speaker B: I think we can get it, I guess. That's funny.
00:50:46.594 - 00:50:49.994, Speaker A: Did I get that like overview, right? And is that like.
00:50:50.774 - 00:52:25.364, Speaker B: So you totally got it, right? Um, and again, I think it's important to talk about that, that stable coin trilemma. Cause you said it. Well, it's like, uh, you know, the issue is, and it goes back to what I was saying, is, at scale, if you're a dollar peg stable coin, I don't think you can, uh, escape kind of regulation or interaction with the state, uh, at scale. And like, for example, you know, you said the, the stable coins here, and in your example, like Dai and fracs, they're like the only ones that are at above a billion market cap that are like decentralized, right? Like they're on chain meeting, right? And it's very obvious. It's just, it's very hard to continue to scale these things with a dollar peg without having some kind of link to just r1 world asset, right? That r1 world asset is treasuries, FMA deposits, just pure cash, right? Like reverse repo contracts, right? Just basically the Fed is the counterparty, right? Or the closest way to get to the Fed counterparty. And if you don't have that, which we don't right now, and maker doesn't, you wrap something that's the closest thing of them, right. Like, right now, fiat coins are essentially real world assets for the good ones, the real world assets for treasuries without the yield, and fed reverse repo facilities, which is what basically circle is trying to do.
00:52:25.364 - 00:53:20.468, Speaker B: That's the issue. The issue is that at scale, this trilemma limits you. There's no evidence that any fully decentralized stablecoin, like LUSD, Rye, all of these things, there's no evidence that they can scale the dollar peg. Rye has this fluctuating peg, albeit, but it is fixed to the arbitrary 3.14 PI dollar value. FPI and Frax ether are not in any way constrained by this view of they can and will and should be fully decentralized, non custodial, fully on chain stable coins. And they are currently but the dollar pegged ones, I don't see how it's possible to ever be.
00:53:20.468 - 00:53:45.006, Speaker B: Our view is there's a r1 world asset model. R1 world asset. You don't need more than that, especially if you're trying to be the simplest and least risky dollar stable coin at scale. You don't need a bunch of, you know, private loans. It'll be more profitable. So, like, one thing there's nothing wrong with, for example, makers real world asset stuff, it'll. It might actually make them much more money.
00:53:45.006 - 00:53:57.702, Speaker B: Right. And that's. It's more risky. So they get more interest from the private companies that can actually, by definition, default. And like the. The US treasuries get paid out all the time.
00:53:57.838 - 00:54:10.200, Speaker A: I know we have a hard stop in a couple of minutes here, so I just. I want to. I want to see if there's anything fracs alpha you can share with us or anything that maybe you haven't shared with folks that you're open to sharing with Empire here.
00:54:10.352 - 00:54:55.204, Speaker B: Yeah, so some of the stuff. So some people probably read all of our tweets and stuff, but we are developing a new thing called the bam b a m, which is called the borrow ammo. And it's like this stealth thing. It's going to come out this year, and it's something that we think is a zero to one innovation for Defi, essentially. And you can borrow stuff and also have spot liquidity without really an oracle. There's no external oracle and things like that. The idea here is for fracs and all of our stable coins to capture the long tail market.
00:54:55.204 - 00:55:19.064, Speaker B: So have debt denominated in long tail assets. Have it not be risky like long tail assets because those need like chain link oracles before this. Right. They all need to have like very, very deep liquidity on chain. We're trying to do it the other direction. Go at it from first principles. People don't know what this does and I don't actually want to reveal it, but it's on our roadmap.
00:55:19.064 - 00:55:36.430, Speaker B: On the roadmap, we also don't reveal exactly what it is because we're like very kind of DL about it. But you heard it here first. We're working on something called the bam bam. It's totally different from anything in Defi. Sometime in 2023, it should be out.
00:55:36.582 - 00:55:39.154, Speaker A: All right, Dan, any last thoughts here?
00:55:39.694 - 00:55:45.350, Speaker C: Yeah, no, that's exciting. Now I'm going to have to keep sliding those DM's of yours and bother you about something else.
00:55:45.382 - 00:55:46.474, Speaker B: I love to hear it.
00:55:46.854 - 00:56:00.476, Speaker C: I guess we talked about decentralization real quick. I know you're working towards removing the reliance on multisigs from fracs and that's gonna be like a gradual process. And using that six of eleven governance system that you guys are sort of pioneering as well.
00:56:00.580 - 00:56:01.124, Speaker B: Do we.
00:56:01.204 - 00:56:05.756, Speaker C: I know he was going through some audits. Do you have any timeline on when that could implementation?
00:56:05.940 - 00:56:32.464, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. I actually think this is even a good governance and stuff is a good podcast episode in and of itself. Yeah. So just to answer super quickly, it's about two months, give or take, away from having actual parts of the protocol be fully using it. We hope to do it sometime. Q two. It's still fully set to do that.
00:56:32.464 - 00:56:57.436, Speaker B: It's an interesting thing I know you wrote about, actually. I link your report a lot, so people can know a lot of the stuff that Frax currently does using an M Sig will be fully on chain, which is basically controlled by vefxs holders. And so it'll be. It's a really interesting structure. I know that you know exactly how it works. Hopefully Q two is the answer.
00:56:57.620 - 00:57:04.868, Speaker A: Nice, Sam. I know you got to jump in. This is awesome. I have a feeling this will not be the last time you're on empire. So really appreciate you coming on, man.
00:57:04.996 - 00:57:07.820, Speaker B: Of course. Thanks for having me, guys. Awesome.
00:57:07.852 - 00:57:08.396, Speaker C: Cheers.
00:57:08.540 - 00:57:08.964, Speaker A: Cheers, man.
