00:00:00.200 - 00:00:28.130, Speaker A: Our goal is to create like a universal restaking layer, not be focused and married to one chain. I know, Yano said. Hey, I don't know if going to every chain makes sense, but our perspective is, hey, look, this is like critical infrastructure. It doesn't have to only live on Ethereum. There's use cases all over the entire crypto sphere for restaking infrastructure. Why are we like saying only lives on Ethereum? Only on only Ethereum token? Why are you shoehorning it?
00:00:28.680 - 00:00:49.344, Speaker B: This episode is brought to you by Se. Say's v two upgrade introduces the first high performance parallelized EVM already live on public Devnet. Mainnet comes later in Q two. You can follow along with the SAI journey on Xay network. Sai is spelled s E. I go follow se on X say network. Hey everyone.
00:00:49.344 - 00:01:19.870, Speaker B: The Polygon Community grants program was launched with 1 billion tokens, all for Polygon builders. Really excited to share that on today's episode of Empire. Season one of the Polygon Community grants program is now live. It features 35 million in matic to support the next generation of Polygon projects. Join the aggregated future today by applying at Polygon Technology forward slash grants. Big thanks to Polygon for sponsoring Empire.
00:01:24.770 - 00:01:50.520, Speaker C: Hi everyone. Jano decided to bail on me today, which is perfectly fine. Today we have a very special guest, which I've had the benefit of knowing through multiple cycles, I guess. And I've had the privilege of seeing them build for quite a bit of time. There's a really fun and unique story behind it. We share in this pod, but we have Drew, co founder of Karak. Welcome, drew to the show.
00:01:51.460 - 00:01:52.840, Speaker A: Thanks for having me, Santi.
00:01:53.380 - 00:01:58.160, Speaker C: So, Drew, give us a very quick intro on who you are and what is Karak.
00:02:01.220 - 00:02:24.224, Speaker A: It won't be brief. My background is a pretty fun one and very unique, I would say. So I first got the crypto when I was 13. So this is 2013, I decided, hey, I was watching YouTube video. So I had recently built a small computer. I was like, I was really into, like, tech at the time, like building diY, stuff like that. And so I watched YouTube video and they're like, yeah, bitcoin at $30.
00:02:24.224 - 00:02:57.072, Speaker A: I'm like, what is this bitcoin thing? So I went to bitcoin.org, i think, at the time, and I didn't read the white paper, I'll tell you that. I don't even know if I've ever read the bitcoin, my paper, but I just saw Gui miner download Gui miner and started running it. I'm like, wow, this thing just sends money to, or sends this bitcoin thing to, um, your bitcoin Qt account, and it keeps streaming in. And every day I would run it the. Run the bitcoin miner every time when I would go to sleep and I would turn it off when I come back from school. And so I got really into it.
00:02:57.072 - 00:03:22.796, Speaker A: I'm like, this is pretty cool. I took all that bitcoin, I started selling it for keyboards and mouses and things like that. But like, it, the story was telling itself. It was like, okay, I can't get a credit card. I can't get a debit card because I'm too young. I would like to buy Steam games or just random gaming gear. I can do that by just running this program, my computer, and then selling bitcoins for Amazon gift cards to like, be instant or whatever.
00:03:22.796 - 00:03:51.120, Speaker A: And it, like, it unraveled pretty. It was pretty obvious what the benefit of this was, right? It wasn't like, to me at the time, it wasn't like an investment or anything. It was like, oh, it's Internet money, you know, this makes sense. This is like Runescape GP or, or wow, gold. But like, you get in a different way. Instead of putting hours, grinding and cutting trees, you just run a programming computer that runs the fans a little extra hard. And then I started really getting, yeah, I was 13.
00:03:52.340 - 00:03:55.400, Speaker C: I don't know a what I was doing when I was 13, definitely not that.
00:03:58.500 - 00:04:22.470, Speaker A: I wasn't, I didn't grow up in like, San Francisco or any like, tech heavy place, so it really was, it's a story that's very strange when I think about it. I'm like, this is pure luck. And life could have gone very differently if I didn't get into it just because I watched the video. And then I really started getting into solidity around 2016. So one of the first big Ethereum hackathons happened close to where I lived. And I was like, screw it. It was summer.
00:04:22.470 - 00:04:55.668, Speaker A: I was like, I'll attend. And before that, I prepped a decent bit, and then I learned how to write smart contracts from there. Then I intern at Coinbase on the wallet team, where I built a simulating things like simulate transactions to make sure you're not getting rubbed. This is before a lot of the metamask, the warnings you have metamask existed. This was one of the first things that told you, hey, this transaction may rug you or whatever this was during the heyday of Defi summer. It was like, look, it makes sense to do something Defi security related I see people getting rugged left and right. I see hacks happening left and right.
00:04:55.668 - 00:05:28.814, Speaker A: I think there's something here, like if we can work on a security solution, and that then we started looking at restaking here in the past, I would say since like November. Well, we were kind of staking during the bear market. So we thought about staking and staking risks, and how do you prevent those risks, or how do you underwrite those risks? The reason was that that was like, the only yield in the bear market. Like, everyone was using staking as 4% is the best you're going to get during the bear. And so we really put our brains to staking. Spent a lot of time trying to model staking on Ethereum. Staking, model the risks, bucket the risks, see if you can underwrite it.
00:05:28.814 - 00:05:58.920, Speaker A: Working with traditional insurance underwriters and reinsurers, like, hey, is this something you're willing to put money towards and to underwrite? And then as restaking emerge, we're like, this makes sense. This is sort of what we initially built during Defi summer, like smart contract protection. But instead of protecting smart contracts only, you're protecting these new, unique, decentralized tasks, maybe go beyond smart contracts, but are still running in the same fashion, still have the same rules that you're trying to protect against.
00:05:59.080 - 00:06:32.148, Speaker C: Yeah, let's pause there for a minute, because this is at a time where I was obviously defi summer. I was very active on chain and was constantly thinking about smart contract risk. And you go and talk to a lot of normal insurers. I certainly went and talked to aeons of the world and, um, some kind of reinsurers, and no one really wanted to touch this space. And even today, it's really challenging to get any sort of insurance in size. Um, and then you reached out. I was just leaving parafy.
00:06:32.148 - 00:06:52.330, Speaker C: So, um, you know, I'd love the audience to hear that because I think it's very unique about your style and really conveys, because throughout this pod, I think we're going to be talking about, generally, insurance security. Obviously, the whole space has taken a whole form in terms of where you are now. But I'd like to just lay out a little bit more context before we get there.
00:06:54.230 - 00:07:16.978, Speaker A: Yeah. So the story about when we initially reached out, you were, I mean, on our radar. Cause you were the only one at the time talking about smart contract risk. I was watching podcasts, and the only person talk about it was you. I can literally tell you exactly what podcast it was. Your monitor is behind you. You're wearing a blue hood, if I remember correctly.
00:07:16.978 - 00:07:28.338, Speaker A: I remember exactly the video. I'm like, wait, hold on. This is the only guy talking about this. We should reach out. But you were at paraphy already, and I think you guys had already done a few insurance deals or crypto insurance deals, so we held off.
00:07:28.434 - 00:07:33.946, Speaker C: Yeah, we're very active. Like in risk card. No, no, it was. It was Nexus mutual, but it has its own challenge.
00:07:33.978 - 00:07:44.932, Speaker A: Yep, yep, yep. Yeah. So one day I woke up, I was browsing Twitter. It was like, 09:00 a.m. and I'm like. And I see your post about you leaving paraphy. And so internally, I send a message saying, hey, Santiago left.
00:07:44.932 - 00:07:53.772, Speaker A: Verify. Send a message. And then, you know, that's the one. The message came to you outlining what we're building and why we wanted you to be part of it.
00:07:53.836 - 00:08:24.128, Speaker C: So it, like, it wasn't. You were already on a message. It was a full couple page document outlining why you wanted me to invest. And, look, I've invested in over 100 companies, and I don't think I've ever gotten a memo to that extent from anyone. So that, immediately, to me, was very unique in the way that, you know. But anyways, you keep telling the story. Yeah.
00:08:24.184 - 00:08:37.370, Speaker A: So that was a synopsis of it. We knew you were one of the few or only person people to talk about it as, at least from an investor perspective. And we're like, we gotta get this guy. We. We can't get them. One day came, we can get them. Bang.
00:08:37.370 - 00:09:09.978, Speaker A: Send it off. But, yeah, I think even through our conversations we've had. We've always talked about the different. We've had conversations throughout the lifespan of Defi and now into whatever you want to call this cycle, through Defi summer into now. And we've always talked about how we think the space should look at security and look at insurance. And it's, you know, it's changed quite a bit. I think initially, we're like, initially, our thesis was the smart contract.
00:09:09.978 - 00:09:59.950, Speaker A: During these defined summers, smart contracts will, as they go through time, become more and more secure. So the idea is, hey, compound aave, etcetera deployed, they'll iterate. But as time goes on, as long as they don't get hacked, they will develop Lindy and become more secure into a point where it is possible to underwrite or to protect against these risks in a way that makes sense for all parties involved. That was our initial idea. I think it started to have legs, but then I think the bear market showed us it was a frank reality check. For where DeFi washing and subsequently where DeFi risk really was, right? One, the yields disappeared. So if the yields appear.
00:09:59.950 - 00:10:20.312, Speaker A: So it has to make sense for you to, like, the amount you're taking from the person's buying protection has to make sense for them. And if the yields were so compressed, which they were during Defi summer, or, sorry, during the bear market, there wasn't much demand for it. Right, and you can't build something like.
00:10:20.466 - 00:11:22.746, Speaker C: Yeah, I live paraphy, thinking, hey, maybe there's an opportunity to build a bank or an insurance company, like a Berkshire Hathaway model, right, where you can start ensuring you have a diversified bulk of insurance, and then you start writing coverage. The problem is, to your point, yeah, the yields went from, you know, teens to five to less than treasuries, and you're like, well, that's really challenging, right? Because then you can't really charge a premium. But the general premise that has always excited me about just the ability to create more sophisticated insurance models is that you can measure risk far more effectively in an open, transparent system. That, to me, is a core primitive that hasn't been fully explored. When you guys came to me, I think you had probably the most thought out vision, which, as we'll get to in the pod, has iterated quite a bit because Defi changes a lot, yields come down. Well, it's not viable to ensure against something where, you know, people are. There's no demand for it.
00:11:22.746 - 00:12:15.760, Speaker C: Right, or viable economic model. But conceptually, I think a core primitive here is if a system is transparent, you can understand and you know the parameters, you can measure risk programmatically in real time. 24 7365. You know, your counterparty, you know who you're interacting with. That, hypothetically, should allow you to measure risk more effectively and therefore price it more effectively. And so it should, in theory, create a vast variety of not only financial products and primitives, but also just an insurance industry in and of itself. And maybe it's not going to be your actuary, it's going to be a solidity engineer, or just a smart contract engineer or a dev that understands these systems and can price that policy far more effectively, or options risk management in general.
00:12:15.760 - 00:12:32.050, Speaker C: And so, anyways, I think you guys, maybe we should get into kind of the evolution of your thinking in terms of the opportunity set, of how you've thought about it over the years, what you've seen, and kind of where you are now leading him to, obviously, Karak.
00:12:32.710 - 00:12:55.296, Speaker A: Yep. Yeah. So I think you touched on in a world where, like, again, our initial thesis was all the information you need to price this thing should be available on chain and, like, it's there, right? It's not like traditional insurance where, you know, progressive tracks your driving, but only keeps it internal to progressive, and then share with like, Allstate or whoever, right? If you can see an policy is.
00:12:55.328 - 00:13:29.860, Speaker C: Renewed annually, which is the most inefficient thing ever, like health or driving. Now, you have telemetry systems, right, that can real time, you know, measure, like metro mile. But it conceptually, it's like, for me, it's one of those industries that is going to totally transform, right? The idea that, like, we write a policy and you renew it every year, it's like, well, what happens within that year? You could become a crack addict. You can become a reckless driver. Your financial counterparty could be taking whole amount of risk that you're not going to be able to see. That is abacus, the global financial crisis.
00:13:30.020 - 00:14:29.326, Speaker A: Yeah, but anyway, I mean, so you touched on a point which is, hey, if the data, if all the data you need to actually refer to actuarially price, this thing is there in public and transparent, you should have a very efficient market in that everyone's got the same information. So then it should be a competition to the fairest price point, right? This would all be true if there wasn't one category of risk that exists. And that's smart contract risk, right? So if it was purely just structural risk and governance risk, then I think for the most part, like, that worldview would have played out and we'd actually have a pretty efficient risk marketplace for what is, I mean, deferred Defi now. But I think because you have that additional element of smart contract risk, that it's not something you just sit there and observe. Like, a lot of these attacks, they take all the money, they're gone, right? If they run through flashbots or whatever, you don't see the transaction until it's over. And so it's not like a run on the bank that slowly occurs. For the most part.
00:14:29.326 - 00:15:10.866, Speaker A: It's, here's $400 million, poof, it's gone. And how do you really actually model that, right? And how do you underwrite that? Because, say you have like ten or 5 billion or even a billion dollars to unwrite all this, and then the Euler finance attack comes and $400 million, your balance sheets wiped out. Like, you have to leverage. You have to. Leverage is a very key component. You have to be able to underwrite two things or more with the same dollar, else you're better off literally just farming the thing that you're underwriting, you're going to get a better yield, right. So to make it worthwhile that someone taking all the smart contract risk and taking all the smart contract risk for all these protocols, you have to provide a yield that makes sense and you have to allow them to use leverage.
00:15:10.866 - 00:15:21.282, Speaker A: But since everything's decently like, especially during Defi summer, a lot of stuff was tightly correlated. Yield on top of yield on top of yield on top of yield on top of yield, yield stack. Any failure in this whole stack analogy.
00:15:21.306 - 00:15:23.938, Speaker C: Of money, legos and a Jenga tower, right?
00:15:24.034 - 00:16:01.332, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. And so that's why I think it's tough to do defi insurance. Do I think it's function potentially possible? Yes, but it's a very difficult problem that I don't think you can store tech at. And I think we've talked about it a lot. It requires a fundamental change, I think in how Defi works, you need a lot more protocols and you need to like have insurance limits. Yeah, it's pretty complex. Hence why like even Nexus, like a lot of their underwriting is now mostly e staking, right.
00:16:01.332 - 00:16:23.910, Speaker A: Or staking type things. Because staking is way more easy to model. Right. You know exactly when the loss will occur. There's four different clients, there's DBT, there's so much stuff to provide security and prevent slashing on staking, but that really doesn't exist on Defi. And when a contract upgrades in DeFi, considered a lindy effect, basically reset, it upgraded. Now you got to restart from square zero tree as a new protocol.
00:16:24.070 - 00:17:05.392, Speaker C: Yeah. There are opportunities like slashing risk, right. You can insure against that. It's like, you know, the maximum loss, right, which is either 5%, 10%, which is easy presumably to absorb, and the probability is quite low. The other far more catastrophic risks that we all know of are an exploit of some oiler thats probably really hard to insure against. Absent off chain insurance company that has a huge book of PNC and other stuff that can absorb these losses. Catastrophe insurance exists.
00:17:05.392 - 00:17:40.450, Speaker C: Theres hurricane, theres all these weird risks, insolvency risks that, you know, fat tails as Talib would call them. You can always get an insurance, there's always a price for it. The question of course is like market participants may not be willing to pay for it and it's not very economical, but so in this process of observing these kind of challenges, the bear market hits, it's kind of really challenging when rates come down. What then sparked the idea for karak. And what is karak, I guess now that we're here.
00:17:41.310 - 00:18:01.486, Speaker A: Yeah, so, I mean, as I said, like, it became a point where everyone's just doing staking, looking at staking, a lot of proximity on staking. And so we started really looking at staking risk. We're like, hey, again, staking risk doesn't have the same challenges as Defi insurance. It's a lot more consistent. It's way more easy to model. You know, the rules, you know, the slashing rules. You have DBT, you have all these different no execution clients.
00:18:01.486 - 00:18:39.310, Speaker A: You have different consensus on your clients. So the risk is a lot less and it's way more modeled. Like, you can model it and then you can sell it potentially to the traditional insurers or reinsurers and maybe get like 100 or $10 million line to underwrite. Right. And so that was our thinking. So we put a lot of time into understanding what's going on on ETH two, staking and bucketing it and bucking the risks and trying to model it out. So we grabbed all the attestations we have, I think a few terabytes of it now at one point on the cloud, and that we were just processing and seeing if we can build models here.
00:18:39.310 - 00:19:13.502, Speaker A: And as that was happening, I think the restaking movement started to come alive. And as we started looking at restaking, we're like, wait, this is very similar to what we were doing on the Defi insurance side. Right. Restaking in itself is basically a task and then a slashing condition. Slashing condition. Meaning, hey, if something goes wrong, there is a loss or like, tends. And this incentivizes the operators that are running these clients to basically behave correctly and to not, you know, not provide false data or not run the task incorrectly or not try to be motions.
00:19:13.502 - 00:19:16.382, Speaker A: Yeah. And we're like, wait, this is, let's.
00:19:16.406 - 00:19:48.654, Speaker C: Lay the groundwork here for people that might have no idea what they're talking about here. Proof of stake protocols like Ethereum, Cosmos, tesos, they your, it's called proof of stake because you have a token. You provide economic security. By staking that token. You may be randomly selected if you're validating to validate that particular block in the same way that a bitcoin miner may well has to prove the puzzle, you know, and submit the data. But in the proof of stake system, the security of the protocol comes from stakers. Meaning you have a solana, you have Ethereum, you stake.
00:19:48.654 - 00:20:41.148, Speaker C: The process of staking, for the most part, is done by professional organizations these are the lidos of the world that you delegate to your tokens, and they will do that for you. And they, in exchange for that reward, they will keep some of that and then share that to the user. That whole process has some risk attached to it, because if the validator does not submit, if it gets elected, if it doesn't submit in time, if it gets all these different conditions where if it acts maliciously or is not online, then it gets slashed, and the slashing is, you lose. Not the entire stake. Some stake. Usually it's less than 10% in a slashing condition. And that tends to be a very low probability event.
00:20:41.148 - 00:20:59.564, Speaker C: Like, for the most part, a lot of the top validators don't get slashed because they have redundancy. They have multiple systems in place. And that's why most people don't stake themselves. They offload and delegate to a professional staker. Right. Whether it's through coinbase or through Lido or some other organization. Right.
00:20:59.564 - 00:21:02.560, Speaker C: Is that fair just to kind of level set?
00:21:03.060 - 00:21:25.774, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's fair. I think for the viewers, this thing of it here, you're given a task, and in the Pos change, this is validating the network. But think of it, you're given a task and you're given a reward, and then there's a penalty for messing up. And those are the three things you should look at. And then when you think of it in restaking form, you're doing the same thing. You're just doing a task, you're getting a reward for that task. And if you mess up, you get a penalty, just like you do on the Pos chains.
00:21:25.774 - 00:21:51.378, Speaker A: But in restaking, the task is like, it's more arbitrary. It's not as, like, you know, eth two has been researched for a very long time. A lot of these chains cosmos, Solana, there's a lot of work into making sure, like, the task is very well defined. Even if two, I think, has a formal spec in restaking, there's additional risk because the task is not as. It's not as pretty as a question.
00:21:51.434 - 00:21:56.030, Speaker C: But why would people restake? Like, what's the opportunity there?
00:21:56.530 - 00:22:09.470, Speaker A: The opportunity is very simple. Additionally, I don't think anyone. There's no, like, I mean, unless you really care about alignment and all these other things, the only. The one liners, there's additional yield in exchange for additional risk.
00:22:09.790 - 00:22:47.350, Speaker C: Right. Nice. Well said. So Karak is you're seeing the restaking movement really take off. After the beacon chain goes live, Lido gets all these deposits, grows in TVL largest t five protocol in terms of deposits value being secured by the protocol. And then there's this restaking opportunity. You guys say, okay, what did you see there? What opportunity were you seeing? And walk us through how you're building Karak, and what is the angle there?
00:22:48.170 - 00:23:15.320, Speaker A: Yeah, so, as I said before, it's very similar to what we built during the Defi summer. If you get to the technicals of what we were doing was basically, you write on chain invariants and say, hey, if these invariants are triggered, payout occurs. Well, here we think everything out. Restaking. You're basically, again, here's a task. Run the task. If there's some issue, slash and slash is almost akin to the payout.
00:23:15.320 - 00:23:29.432, Speaker A: Here it is. You're changing who the recipient is, right. Instead of giving it to someone else, you're burning it or sending it to a zero address. For the most part, it's the same thing with a small, few, little, small tweaks. So we look, sorry, staking. We're like, look, this is. This is our wheelhouse.
00:23:29.432 - 00:23:51.020, Speaker A: This is our bread and butter. We've done this. We understand how to make and how to architect systems that are sort of open ended and allow people to create their own rules. We literally made a system that allows you to plug into any defi protocol and define rules that you want to make sure above. And if there's a hack or anything and these invariants are broken, you get a payout. It's the same thing here. It's like, here's a task.
00:23:51.020 - 00:24:15.942, Speaker A: Run the task. You get a reward. If you mess up, you get slashed. We just, we know how to make that. We know how to define those contracts, make that system very easily. So it made sense when we started seeing the restaking movement take off. Now, when we looked at Karak, we're like, and the way we wanted to design it, we're like, there's a lot of politics that have been designed for restaking that we don't necessarily agree with.
00:24:15.942 - 00:24:41.028, Speaker A: I think one of the big things is that the people have sort of defined restaking. I've said is, hey, it should live on Ethereum. ETH is the cleanest capital. It shouldn't live. It shouldn't be a multi chain protocol, etcetera. And that was the first point of disagreement. Our idea is, hey, restaking is just putting, like, you're basically putting dollars up, dollars, economic security in exchange for rewards.
00:24:41.028 - 00:25:38.952, Speaker A: Why do they have to be in Ethereum? Like, can anyone make a case for that? Aside from, hey, it's ETH aligned or some B's argument, aside from ETH is a pristine capital. Okay, ETH can be considered as pristine capital. One of the things we learned during the insurance phase was people are willing to underwrite in other tokens too. And the other side is willing to pay less of a premium in exchange for that, right? This is called cost of capital. If I let you underwrite with something beyond ETh, for example, if I let you underwrite with USDC SDAI, which is staked, I that earns 5%, the basically follows the treasury rate or governance tokens, you're probably willing to take less of a yield because, you know, the capital is considered less pristine. On the other side, the DSS or the AV's can pay less of a yield to stakers in exchange for that less pristine capital. So our idea is, one of the differing factors is, hey, let's make this thing run on any chain and take in any token.
00:25:38.952 - 00:26:24.690, Speaker A: And our idea is basically create a universal restaking layer, right? So if one day we want to add bitcoin restaking, or I know you're gonna laugh at this one, I'll say it because it's funny and it really exaggerates the point. Maybe you add Solana restaking, you can, but our goal is to create like a universal restaking layer, not be focused and married to one chain. I know Yano said, hey, I don't know if going to every chain makes sense, but our perspective is, hey, look, this is a critical infrastructure. It doesn't have to only live on Ethereum. There's use cases all over the entire crypto, crypto like crypto sphere for restaking infrastructure. Why are we like saying only lives on Ethereum, only on only Ethereum token? Why are you shoehorning it?
00:26:24.990 - 00:27:18.130, Speaker C: I want to get to that because I think it's a very important question. I want to pause here and then maybe just ask a very basic question like, what is the worst that can happen? Because I think when people talk about risk, they're very, very opinionated, but not nuanced. And so in this restake stake, improve the stake systems, you stake, you restake, people are going to chase yield. We know that that's a common behavior of human beings. What's the worst that can happen when you think about the total risk? Right? There's been obviously a lot of concerns that people have been like, oh, this is going to create a huge problem. It might even affect the entire liveness security of the chain. If one protocol really goes down, walk us through what are the biggest risks and what is the most catastrophic risk that you foresee and kind of this restaking economy.
00:27:18.130 - 00:27:25.570, Speaker C: Just out of curiosity, is it catastrophic? What is the worst case? What is the most probable case?
00:27:27.550 - 00:27:35.904, Speaker A: Worst case is zero. Everything can go, poof, get sent to a burn address. Right. That's like. And if anyone says otherwise, practically speaking.
00:27:35.952 - 00:27:37.300, Speaker C: Like, how would that happen?
00:27:37.720 - 00:28:00.068, Speaker A: Yeah. So basically what can happen is if an unintended slashing happens, say, let's keep it basic. The task is out of one plus one equals two. Somehow the slashing condition on the contracts was messed up and that it thinks one plus one is actually three. All operators report two and everyone gets slashed. Right. Unintended slashing should have never occurred.
00:28:00.068 - 00:28:10.948, Speaker A: Then everyone just gets slashed. And then the way the slashing was defined is a complete slashing of all the capital saying if anyone. Not 5%. Yeah. And we're talking about the worst case. Right.
00:28:11.084 - 00:28:26.760, Speaker C: The odd. Right. The odds of someone catching that is pretty high though, right. If the contract is defining 100% slashing, like most people would kind of spot that fairly easily unless it's like an injected code there. That is like a state actor that wants to take down an entire system.
00:28:27.060 - 00:28:50.396, Speaker A: Yeah. So their safety mechanisms, one would be, hey, let's get it audited. Make sure it makes sense. Like make sure that their slashing contract makes sense. Make sure your DSS or abs makes sense. And the slashing rules are fair. There's, there's like slashing veto committees that come in and say, hey, you know, we have five, six, seven days to adjudicate if a slashing is correct or not.
00:28:50.396 - 00:29:27.570, Speaker A: If it's not correct, then, you know, we can cancel it. And I, there's mechanism in place. But, you know, we have to think not only about now, we have to think about when everything's completely decentralized, when there's no slashing committee anymore, when anyone's free to make an ABS or DSS and there's no humans to sit there and judge, when it actually truly becomes a decentralized network. This is the world that's potential. This is the potential for this, for the infrastructure. It could completely slash everything by the rules. It's written in a completely decentralized, permissionless environment with the handcuffs, with the training wheels, with, you know, everything on, the risk can be much less.
00:29:27.570 - 00:29:43.410, Speaker A: Or it could be honestly zero too. Like there's, you can build an abs or DSS with no slashing. I think that's the case right now. Not many or any of the ABS is live right now. Have any slashing, right. So you could have 0% and you get 100% or anywhere between.
00:29:43.710 - 00:29:47.210, Speaker C: What is your operating kind of base case here.
00:29:48.350 - 00:30:35.156, Speaker A: So the base case, I think for the most part, slashing should pretty, be pretty minimal. If they actually, if slashing has become a common thing, this whole restaking, it just doesn't work. If slashing has become commonplace and you've gone from earning maybe 1% on top of your 4% that you're getting for ETH, so say you're getting 4% eth now you've gotten 5%. If, if the slashing become commonplace and you start losing more than 1% or even a half a percent, I think, I think this whole thing flips and the, the public appetite for restaking actually goes south. Now this is me being very frank about people. I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna like sell you on a story or fairy tale. This is the way I think is gonna work.
00:30:35.156 - 00:31:00.518, Speaker A: It's gonna be like when you start having some of these first initial slashings, actually, I start thinking people are going to pull my money out because they're going to get scared, right? And so I think when the first initial slashings, you know, in whatever platform occur, people are going to start pulling their money out of LRT's and pulling out of their native deposits because they're worried. They're like, oh, you know, now here's the risk. It's not just been a points farm anymore.
00:31:00.574 - 00:32:08.880, Speaker C: Now, you know, well, the meta is evolving quickly, obviously with airdrops and now farming, to your point around, people are really saying, hey, was it really worth it, taking that incremental risk? I've actually lost some money. I can't even get my money out as quickly. Take 714 days to bridge over and withdraw and the points or whatever, the airdrop wasn't as juicy and the yield is not there. I guess it brings me to the question, how big of a market is this? We certainly saw with defi yield farming, traditionally, yields come down, the market stabilizes, and it's not sustainable to have these super high yields. How do you think about now, how much TVL can you absorb and what are the restaking opportunities? Like? I guess like there's a number of, but I'd like maybe for you to kind of bucket them in terms of where is this yield gonna potentially come from?
00:32:09.220 - 00:32:26.462, Speaker A: Yeah, I'll give you a frank assessment here too. I think TVL is an awful metric for this entire thing. For the entirety of restating at TBLs right now is the worst metric you can look at and I'll be. I'll explain. Okay, so I can't got 22,000,000,023 21. I don't mean ETH price recently crashed. So.
00:32:26.462 - 00:32:53.368, Speaker A: But around there, right. How do you pay yield on $21 billion when the industry, the meme of the industry is. There's no real revenue. Right? Yeah, yeah, your protocols make real revenue. But how are you gonna pay yield on $21 billion with infrastructure? It's. It's a question that many people. No one's really willing to say it out loud and try to answer that question because I don't know if there's really an answer.
00:32:53.368 - 00:33:09.952, Speaker A: Right. And for the most part is people farming. You just can't pay the yield on $22 billion. And I don't even know if there's a need for that much economic security in one specific. ABs or DSs. I can't think.
00:33:09.976 - 00:33:15.368, Speaker C: You mentioned ABs and DSS a couple of times for the listener. What are those things?
00:33:15.544 - 00:34:00.910, Speaker A: Yeah, so an AV's is Eigens terms actively valid service. Our acronym is DSS distributed secure service. It just makes more sense. But there are two of the same for the most part. But yeah, these are the actual services that run on the restaking platform and they are the ones that will be paying for the economic security. Our view has been, hey, unless they're just going to create tokens that are going to sit there and airdrop, continually airdrop and go straight to zero, you need to create a sustainable economy for this whole thing to work. And this is why I said TBL is the worst metric to look at right now, because you first need to start the sustainable economy before you start bringing large amounts of capital else the TBL chart ends up looking just like that.
00:34:00.910 - 00:34:32.020, Speaker A: After the airdrop, it's going to look like that. The way we've approached is like, hey, I'm. Let's start small. We implement a $1 billion cap because there's not many. No one can make a case that you need more than $1 billion in economic secure, like an application. You need more than $1 billion in economic security. So we implemented a deposit cap and now we're really focusing on building actual proper use cases that can provide sustainable yields outside of native token dilution to the end users.
00:34:32.020 - 00:35:12.472, Speaker A: Now, you asked about what we think as like applications that can actually do this, DSS and ABSs that can actually do that. You have a few buckets to look at. You have people creating things like, or just adding additional security to already existing things. So you have restake roll ups where basically you provide economic, you basically run clients that basically run the roll up. You can have decentralized sequencers, you can simply have guardians that sit there and watch the state routes. And if anything goes off, it will just shut down or pause the chain. Another bucket is you have bridges basically providing insurance across transactions across the bridge.
00:35:12.472 - 00:35:42.820, Speaker A: So you're bridging our, so for example, wormhole from a to b. You can then provide insurance for that transaction route. And if it doesn't get delivered, the user gets paid out. Another one is like ZK coprocessors and off chain compute. And then after that you really start getting into some new stuff. And this is actually where a lot of our focus is because I think this can power new economy. So you have people building and you're an investor in things like hyperbolic, right.
00:35:42.820 - 00:35:59.320, Speaker A: They're building decentralized AI or compute using the POS system. Proof of sampling. Proof of sampling is one option for something that can leverage a decentralized network like this. Actually, a lot of teams are building AI projects that are leveraging DSS.
00:35:59.860 - 00:36:41.796, Speaker C: Yeah. The whole general concept that makes sense is this idea of when people stake in a proof of state network, there's a lot of, there's more security. And it's a very simplistic mechanism. The idea of active validating services, or your mechanism is to create more possibilities into how that security gets shared, distributed for different use cases. Like I've said it multiple times, but like not every use case requires the same level of security. Meaning. Yeah, if you drive a Ferrari versus a Prius, different level of security that is needed.
00:36:41.796 - 00:37:08.520, Speaker C: Meaning insurance. Right. The application itself, if you're moving around a million dollars versus $2 for a game, very different type of security that's required for that transaction. Right. So that's a general idea, right? Between, it's actually the first very crude mechanism of you stake. It's a huge pool of security. And now this allows you to be more flexible in how you actually utilize that pool of security.
00:37:08.520 - 00:37:13.060, Speaker C: This is kind of the whole mechanism that's got the industry so jazzed up over the last couple of years. Right?
00:37:15.160 - 00:37:30.622, Speaker A: Oh, sorry to cut you off, the two metrics that you look at and you just point out is the actual utilization of the capital in a non B's way. Okay, like you can't be like here's $6 billion, but it really needs $6 billion. So actual utilization of capital. And then second from that is the yield being paid on that capital, non.
00:37:30.646 - 00:37:41.050, Speaker C: Dilutive token yes, yes. How sophisticated do you think this market is to determine how much security is required?
00:37:43.470 - 00:37:54.500, Speaker A: I think right now we're sort of taking a, throwing a dart on a dartboard and saying hey, this is, this is the amount we need, right. I, hence why we started big and then now we're trying to figure it out when in reality in a rational.
00:37:54.540 - 00:38:02.480, Speaker C: Market, it's probably good to go over and then cut, cut, cut, and then find the equilibrium as opposed to being under.
00:38:02.860 - 00:38:52.410, Speaker A: Well, I feel you can make the, you can make the argument for going under. And our approach is this, why don't you allow DSS's defined limits? Say, hey, I want a million dollars economic or 2 billion or 2 million, because if you don't define limits and you have a bunch of capital, then you're going to see a rush of the capital, the yield's going to suck, and then everyone's going to leave, and then you'll become bounce up and down, up and down, up and down. Our approach is like, hey, why don't we allow these people that are writing DSS is to say, hey, I only want a million, I only want 2 million of capital. I want it for this duration of time so I don't have to sit there and wake up one day and be like, half my capital is gone, my things half as secure. So basically come in and say, hey, I want 90 days, I want a million dollars from 90 days lock in. And here's probably the yield you're going to get, plus or minus based on our conditions. And then they can make it 2 million, and then they can make a 5 million depending on their needs.
00:38:53.070 - 00:40:04.916, Speaker C: The whole general idea for a listener is that you're basically creating a marketplace for security. And if you're a particular chain or you're a particular application, you're going to go out to the market and say, I'm willing to pay this amount in my native token for this type of security. Going back to the example of hyperbolic, you need all this kind of verification or whatever. They're running their whole business and you require a certain amount of security to operate that in a decentralized context and utilizing the chain. And the investor here or the market might look at that and say okay, yeah, the fair coupon here is XDev 10%, 14%, 30% based on a couple of parameters like the duration of it, the perceived level of riskiness, the opportunity cost, a whole number of parameters. But naturally speaking like the way people like, I think, the way I think of it is there should be an equilibrium, right. In terms of, theres in the same way that you have capital markets, you have a prevailing interest rate based on a ranking system of perceived level riskiness for a company like the rating scale.
00:40:04.948 - 00:40:05.092, Speaker A: Right.
00:40:05.116 - 00:40:33.172, Speaker C: Youre aaa, youre paying t bill plus very small spread. If youre a high yield, youre a risky company. So thats how the market. These yields are presumably going to move quite a bit and capital is going to rotate really quickly. This shared security is going to move pretty quickly and then thats going to, you know, adjust. But your points are really good. When we says we need these applications, right?
00:40:33.356 - 00:41:04.490, Speaker A: We need applications first we, we put the, what's the saying that you put the cart before. Yeah, start small, start small. Create the use cases. Create new applications that can actually use economic security beyond some meme, okay? Get away from this whole alignment crap about whatever. Focus on the actual damn application, build the application, figure out how the economic security actually slots in without shoehorning it in. And then grow the TVL and actually get the delegations. That's the way you're gonna create sustainable model.
00:41:06.190 - 00:41:35.872, Speaker B: This episode is brought to you by, say, sei's belief about the world, I think is a good one. They believe that the EVM is here to stay. Agree with that. They believe that the EVM is gonna look kind of like what JavaScript ended up looking like in the web two world. Agree with that. They also believe that the EVM in its current iteration lacks a lot of the performance and scalability that developers need. So what say has done with their v two upgrade is they just introduced the first high performance, parallelized EVM into the market today.
00:41:35.872 - 00:42:24.696, Speaker B: They've got lightning fast block times and finality of just 390 milliseconds. What this does is it unlocks an entirely new design space with 100 x the throughput of even some of the fastest EVM l two s on the market today, save v two, is now live on public Devnet with main net scheduled for Q two. You can stay up to date with, say, on x at say, network. Sei Network. Big things to say. This episode is brought to you by Polygon. Polygon Labs is developing the next generation of open source zero knowledge tech to aggregate crypto liquidity and user bases, empowering developers to grow in a unified web of interoperable chains with the ag layer, that was a big mouthful, so I'm going to tell you what it means in my, in my words.
00:42:24.696 - 00:42:42.922, Speaker B: There's all these things popping up, l two s and l three s, and it's chaos, right? If you are building something you no longer have to worry about. Bootstrapping liquidity. You can basically just build in the ag layer to tap into the liquidity of the ag layer. And the users of the ag layer. You get the users, you get the liquidity. It's the ag layer. It's hot.
00:42:42.922 - 00:43:03.844, Speaker B: It's by Polygon Labs. They've got the Polygon community grants program. It was launched with 1 billion tokens just for polygon builders. Season one. It's live right now. It features 35 million in Matic to support the next generation of polygon builders. Join the aggregated future today by applying at Polygon technology forward slash grants.
00:43:03.844 - 00:43:09.400, Speaker B: That's Polygon technology forward slash grants. If you talk to anyone, let them know blockwork sent you.
00:43:12.900 - 00:43:37.814, Speaker C: The core differentiation here is you're saying we're going to allow other types of collateral, not just ethereum. That's pretty novel. Walk me through that. And how does that. Because a skeptic might say, wait a minute here. If you allow shitty collateral that, why doesn't that make the system more fragile? Walk me through that. I have the answer to that.
00:43:37.814 - 00:43:43.450, Speaker C: We, you and I have talked about this a lot, but like, what is for that skeptic? Like, what would you say?
00:43:43.910 - 00:44:17.866, Speaker A: Yeah, so it's ultimately a free market. You know, is someone offers up with. If you don't take with, you can take with as a DSS, but you need to think about, okay, hey, what does this mean for my application? Right. In a free market, you can do like, our approach is to create a free market and let the market figure out what it wants to use. And so, yes, someone can come in and bring a meme coin and restake with a meme coin. But who's really at fault? It's the DSS that accepting that shitty meme coin, it's not like it is how the free market plays out. So in Carx system, we basically allow you to come and say hey.
00:44:17.866 - 00:44:47.036, Speaker A: And express, hey, I have capital in this token. What can I restake with? And as a DSS designer or operator or the DS creator, I can say, hey, this is a bridge. It's connecting a bunch of different networks together. It's not just ethereum two and l two. It's ethereum to Avax, to Solana, to some cosmos chains, right? So it's connected with a bunch of different networks. Hence it makes sense for me to maybe accept capital beyond just Ethereum. So I'm going to say, hey, I'll take an Avax.
00:44:47.036 - 00:45:28.628, Speaker A: It'll take in Solana. It'll take in rap, bitcoin, whatever. And then people that have those tokens can come and restake with you. So it allows you to use tokens that make sense for use case, because Ethereum is not the best or it's not the best ROI collateral for all these systems. Like you can't say, hey eth, the only thing you should be restaking with everything else sucks. If it, if it is, if it's a bridge that's connecting five different networks, have five different native tokens, why can't you accept all those tokens? And why does everything have to be only deployed on ethereum itself? Again, it's a bridge that's point of five different networks to have deployments everywhere, right? And that's the core differentiator. It's let the free market decide what it wants to do, what's the fair market rates willing to pay and what tokens is willing to take.
00:45:28.764 - 00:46:01.320, Speaker C: Yeah, I think I share that sentiment. The market is always the arbiter of truth and far more efficient predictor. People obviously are not hyped up about polymarket. Well, yeah, when you have $300 million on the line, it's a far better estimation of what the market is telling you. Signal versus someone having an opinion on what the pristine collateral should and shouldn't be. The learning that I had in DeFi is like a money market, like Aave and compound. The difference between Aave and compound aave was able to attract way more TVL because it was much more agile and onboarding collateral.
00:46:01.320 - 00:46:49.368, Speaker C: And it's not so that you shouldn't be taking these tokens like sushi, for instance, or Wifi as collateral. It's the amount and the caps that you set on that. And that is, it's almost like Moskowitz efficient portfolio construction. Most people would be intuitively say, hey, wait a minute, if you add private equity hedge funds venture to a portfolio, you're gonna. It's gonna make it way more risky. And actually it's not, because what you need to focus on is the correlation among said assets. And in different scenarios, how does one bucket of allocation perform? One might widely outperform venture, might be super high performer while everything else crashes.
00:46:49.368 - 00:47:42.410, Speaker C: If you didn't have venture in that portfolio, you would have been kind of screwed because everything's so tightly correlated. Which goes back to the initial observation you made over time. I guess if you have two systems, one like Eigen, that has only ethereum as collateral, versus another system that allows other types of collateral, well then you're presumably introducing some decoupling less correlation between a bucket of different types of collateral. Now there might be other issues which I want to get into with you is what are the complications of allowing other types of collateral? How do you think about the caps that you're setting? You mentioned this 1 billion cap. What are the other types of collateral? How do you think about the caps? Who's setting these caps? Is it an internal risk committee? Is it just based on what.
00:47:43.390 - 00:48:17.060, Speaker A: Yeah, I think you brought a good point. It's the lending markets have shown us all the ways you can think about accepting collateral. I think the closest one we're most akin to is actually Morpho. Morpho lets you accept anything's isolated in own buckets. And so here everything's isolated in its own buckets. And the only like where the collateral comes and meets is when the DSS chooses to accept multiple types of collateral for its a economic security you touched on. How do you like, what are the complications of accepting multiple types of collateral? Well, and this is a small nuance.
00:48:17.060 - 00:48:44.972, Speaker A: It's how do you equate the voting weight of these different types of collateral? Right. So for example, if we have a governance token, if we have ethereum, and then we have for example bridged asset, you're going to weight these things differently. Purely on. If we just look at it very simple, like simplistically, we're going to say, hey, based on dollars, one ethereum is going to be worth more than one USDC, of course. Right? 3000 versus one. So we're going to wait. Each of these going to have a different voting weight when they're delegated to an operator.
00:48:44.972 - 00:49:08.744, Speaker A: So basically think of it like shares for people at home. Think of it here I have shares, I delegate it to an operator and they go and vote and actually run the task on my behalf. And then I get rewards. It's how restaking works. Well, I'm giving different types of collateral. Each collateral is going to be considered in different forms of value just from the dollar, like the face value of it. But also, you know, the type of collateral.
00:49:08.744 - 00:49:18.700, Speaker A: If ETH is most pristine, it may have a higher voting. Like you may get more votes for restaking ETH versus if you restaked with. I'm exaggerating, but yeah.
00:49:19.680 - 00:49:38.300, Speaker C: Is there one DSS? Are there multiple people here? Like organizations, like, like how are. Because in this, in this, in what you're describing, it really matters whoever is making that decision.
00:49:38.600 - 00:50:09.242, Speaker A: Yes. And so the person that we've given the rights to make decision, there is two parts the DSS is the ultimate decider of what capital gets taken in. So if they're like, no, we don't want to take in wrap BTC, you can't restake a rap. BTC, that's the final answer. But again, you can have multiple dss that do different things. So you can have a warm old DSs that takes in maybe like w or USDC and Eth, and you can have another DSs that's a restake roll ups. DSS that takes in the governance tokens of various rollups.
00:50:09.242 - 00:50:27.014, Speaker A: So they're the ones that ultimately decide. And then you have operators that are saying, hey, I will support this asset. So if I'm an operator and I only want to support pristine collateral like Ethereum, like USDC, then I can do that. And if I'm an operator that wants to be more degen and I want to support more governance tokens, meme tokens, whatever, you can also support that.
00:50:27.182 - 00:50:31.734, Speaker C: The operator, meaning back to your example, would be like a hyperbolic, sorry.
00:50:31.782 - 00:50:35.690, Speaker A: The operators in this example would be someone like a figment or coinbase cloud.
00:50:36.070 - 00:50:37.446, Speaker C: The validators themselves.
00:50:37.518 - 00:50:39.302, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, got it.
00:50:39.446 - 00:50:54.696, Speaker C: And so there's two components. Obviously, validators in this industry have a long track record. Most of the top ten are the top ten across all different chains, from Ethereum to tezos to cosmos. It's all pretty much the same guys, right?
00:50:54.848 - 00:50:55.580, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:50:56.080 - 00:51:09.380, Speaker C: This could be even Coinbase. Right. Or binance running their own validators for the clients. So they, they, they're like on one side of the spectrum determining what DSS they work with. Right?
00:51:10.720 - 00:51:29.526, Speaker A: Yeah. And they choose what services. So if they want to validate the wormhole one, they want to, they can. And if they're like, hey, there's a small one that we don't really put, want to put a reputation online for because maybe it's not thoroughly audited or whatever. They don't have to operate on that one. Right. So they are free to choose which, just like they're free to choose what chains they're going to run validators for.
00:51:29.526 - 00:51:34.758, Speaker A: They're free to choose what DSS is. They want to validate for what keeps.
00:51:34.774 - 00:51:38.570, Speaker C: The DSS in line and in check from taking too much risk.
00:51:41.190 - 00:51:57.518, Speaker A: I know. It's a social slashing. It's the social consequences of it in the end. Right. It's the reputational harm of it. It's the, you know, potentially getting a black mark and saying, no, no one's gonna really. No operator is gonna delegate to you or operate for your, with your DSS, it's completely social.
00:51:57.518 - 00:52:03.846, Speaker A: Again, it's a permissionless protocol, so no one can block anyone from doing anything. There's no admin privilege.
00:52:03.958 - 00:52:07.918, Speaker C: So that's a good point. Anyone can come in and launch their own DSS.
00:52:08.094 - 00:52:16.896, Speaker A: Yep. I think it's important because, again, you don't want to be. You don't want to stay here and be like, hey, we only want to work with this team or this team or this team. And we want to.
00:52:16.928 - 00:52:31.940, Speaker C: Yeah, you're not opinionated. I get it. And I think it makes sense in the same way that the market is not opinionated. You have multiple type of. I almost liken it as an example. There's multiple types of hedge funds. They take all kinds of different risk.
00:52:31.940 - 00:53:13.900, Speaker C: There's this problem that is a principal agent problem. So anytime I invest in another fund, I do sometimes, I always ask the question, how much of your money is on the line? How much of the GP of the entire fund, say the funds, $100 million. How much of that is your money? And if it's less than a certain percentage, I will not invest because there's just not enough skin in the game. Yep. And so then how do you kind of think about the. Just going back to this like principal agent problem, like of a DSS, of an operator? Like, yeah, they can. Are they anonymous? Are they synonymous? They launch it.
00:53:13.900 - 00:53:36.770, Speaker C: They offer a really compelling opportunity. And what I'm trying to get at is the market may not be as sophisticated and they're just chasing that yield and it blows up. How do you. Can you mitigate that? Can you, like, what can you do to prevent that, if anything?
00:53:37.390 - 00:54:06.920, Speaker A: Yeah, so I think so. Again, it's a permission protocol, so anything's possible. But the way you confront this. So we made a pretty flexible design where you can sort of do whatever. Like if you want to make your own custom vault that allows you to take custody, assets on Coinbase custody or. Or finance custody and allows you to restake them. And this have like an actual ricardian contract where you write, hey, if, you know, if I'm slashed and this event is admitted by smart contract, I'm actually going to give up that money.
00:54:06.920 - 00:54:49.776, Speaker A: You can technically, as long as the DSS says, hey, I'll take that capital in. Right. If, you know, you can let governance tokens in, you can let stake governance tokens in, you can let bridge tokens in like it's so flexible. Like you can, you can define however you want to restake and as long as someone on some DSS, on other sides will take it in, take that cap, accept that as like restake capital and economic security. The protocol allows it to occur. Now, going back to your point, how do I create skin in the game? Well, you can extend that flexibility design. You can literally make it so the operator themselves has to put up 10% and has to act like a GP, basically, but 1015 percent up and you can make it so if there's a slashing, they're a first to get slashed.
00:54:49.776 - 00:55:02.312, Speaker A: Right. It's actually not too hard to build. You can create a 4626 volts that has those rules where the, you know, the creator has to put 10% of the capital in and, you know, when that vault gets slashed, they're the first, they're the ones that lose their deposit shares.
00:55:02.376 - 00:55:04.380, Speaker C: Sort of like some, some waterfall.
00:55:04.720 - 00:55:17.400, Speaker A: Exactly. Right. So it's you. You can easily define those rules in the car protocol and it's super easy to find those rules and create a vault and deploy that. Right. So you can solve some of those issues within this open design.
00:55:18.300 - 00:55:42.040, Speaker C: We've thought a lot about, or talked a lot about hypotheticals. I'd like for you to tell us a little bit about what's actually going on in the ground floor. Walk us through. It's been a couple of months since you launched or just fairly recently. What kind of activity and interest have you seen? What's the state of the protocol today? And what is the rest of the next twelve to 1824 months look like for you guys?
00:55:42.430 - 00:56:12.562, Speaker A: Yeah, so I think so. We launched in early April and it was been a pretty, a pretty successful launch. I would say we got to a billion tv I think within like six weeks. And I know I did say TVL was a meme, but it showed that there, it showed that there's a demand here for what's being built, an alternative to Eigen. Right. People wanted something that, you know, is open, is going to exist on multiple different chains except any asset. And I think that's actually become sort of the industry standard.
00:56:12.562 - 00:56:17.410, Speaker A: Everyone's like, wait, why can't you restake with all these assets? Right. Like we were able to challenge that and successfully.
00:56:17.450 - 00:56:31.870, Speaker C: Presumably there's better. It's almost like you want to shop on Amazon. Do you want to just shop in Amazon in your local town or Amazon and the entire country, or the world, but you want to have access to all products, right, exactly.
00:56:32.370 - 00:57:18.490, Speaker A: And so I think we were successful in that mission, saying, hey, this should be any asset and it should exist on multiple different chains. So we saw success there. And from that after we launched, we were able to start adding a bunch of various different tokens. So we've added the east, the LSTs, some LRt's, even things like Pt tokens, governance tokens, like blast was one I think we added last week, things that help tell the story on what we're trying to do. And so that's been the past few weeks and now we're finishing up the V two audit. So going to the third audit for V two security is pretty important to me. I try to keep it very simple, like smart contract, Dev should write smart contracts in a way that's super simple for others to understand.
00:57:18.490 - 00:58:04.794, Speaker A: Audit and get it audited multiple times. Because in the end you want to be able to sleep at night without, and you don't want to have to carry your computer and your ledger and everything around with you 24/7 because you need to potentially respond to spend time and actually get this thing secured, make sure it's well audited. Don't cut corners there. So V two is almost ready to go and go for launch here in the end of July. We're onboarding tons of DSS partners again. We're trying to create actual use cases here that are just not dilutive governance tokens, people that actually want to use the services and take the economic security. So we're working with partners like Warm Hole, which we announced about two weeks ago, and we're helping take wormhole and make it more decentralized, right, which meets the goals of the warmhole community.
00:58:04.794 - 00:58:57.364, Speaker A: So creating a decentralized validator set that can work alongside the existing warmhole guardian network, potentially looking at creating a decentralized relay network. So the end ux for the user that's bridging becomes even better. And working with our partners, right? So another one working with hypernative, which is basically building a security oracle. So how can we power security oracles that provide more security, new use cases that we haven't seen before that can create products that can actually pay the rewards to people that are restaking. And then beyond that, there's tons of partnerships I can't really talk about. But the big takeaway would be, hey, these are new ideas that aren't just like the current infra memes that everyone's just like, man this over like the current high priced FTP infra memes, right? Things that are completely new, that only restaking can really power. We're really excited about that because I'm actually.
00:58:57.364 - 00:59:15.480, Speaker A: You're actually creating new usable products for people versus playing the infrared game and so that's, like, the way we look at, like, integration. Like, that's the way we're. We're looking at integrations, those type things. But, yeah, like, that's the current state. And then I can, you know, I can sell you in the future forever, if need be.
00:59:16.790 - 00:59:52.388, Speaker C: Well, before we go to the future, this idea I've had for a while, I just want to validate with you, and you tell me how you agree. Disagree. But didn't Cosmos really pioneer this, like, ages ago, this idea of shared security model and allowing. When you think about Cosmos as you have atoms as a hub, and then you have chains like DydX, and you're borrowing security and from the. From the hub, and in some ways, we're going more in that direction. Like, it feels a lot like a borrowed concept. Like, Cosmos is kind of cursed.
00:59:52.388 - 01:00:08.668, Speaker C: Protocol is build a lot of really good tech, and then people then just borrow it. Meanwhile, Adam, as a security substrate, is sort of TBD, and the price kind of reflects that, but it feels like that. No, like, you know, you have. Where I was going with this question.
01:00:08.724 - 01:00:08.892, Speaker A: A.
01:00:08.916 - 01:00:38.560, Speaker C: Do you agree, Bjorndev? Do you foresee a scenario where you can now spin up chains like l two s or l three s or whatever? L two s are just other chains far more efficiently because you have multiple types of collateral, and you can very easily spin up like a. You know, if dy. If you're not dy, DX. If you're another protocol, you want to launch your own chain. They can borrow security from Karak in this marketplace and get it far more efficiently than it has ever been possible before in this industry.
01:00:39.100 - 01:01:00.908, Speaker A: Yeah. So on the cosmos point, I think there's so much. You can make cases for both sides. I think the idea of borrowed security, I think, was pioneered by cosmos. But again, as you said, the ideas and execution are two separate things. And, like, there's a lot of politics on that side versus, like, actually getting. I'm not shitting on.
01:01:00.908 - 01:01:33.556, Speaker A: I'm not shitting on that side of the crypto sphere. I'm just saying there's a lot of politics that sometimes get involved and muddy their goals. But I would say I would give it to him. There's no point of withholding credit. I think that the credit is probably due to. Is due to the cosmos ecosystem saying, hey, you can do the shared security. There's one world where you can say, hey, the idea of their way they looked at Social Security, Washington, hey, another chain can borrow the security.
01:01:33.556 - 01:02:03.326, Speaker A: And they were really only thing on, like, a chain level. I think the way I look at it is, and I figure how to word it properly, but it's like there's a whole world of smaller applications that sort of everyone is talking about restaking is ignoring applications that only want 1 million, 2 million, $10 million in security. They're not a whole. They're not a whole chain. It's hard for them to justify having to run a whole cosmos chain and talking with all these.
01:02:03.438 - 01:02:05.262, Speaker C: Not everyone is dy. DX.
01:02:05.446 - 01:02:06.270, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly.
01:02:06.350 - 01:02:43.270, Speaker C: And so effectively what this does, in my mind is it lowers the costs, because if you're you, in order to bootstrap security, you have to give out all this inflation, crazy inflation like bitcoin did in the early days and new chains and cosmos, because you look at a bunch of other. It has historically been quite expensive. This marketplace lowers that cost to bootstrap security because marketplace inherently makes things more efficiently, because there's better price discovery and there's more competition that is, lowers the cost. You don't have to dilute yourself. You don't have to have these crazy inflation curves. You can now do it in a more efficient, cost efficient manner.
01:02:43.770 - 01:02:44.282, Speaker A: Exactly.
01:02:44.346 - 01:02:48.230, Speaker C: Cosmos hadn't historically allowed you to do to that degree.
01:02:48.810 - 01:03:21.660, Speaker A: Exactly. You will make it super simple for people to borrow the economic security and create tools and applications like you. You can make it so you can borrow economic security, but you need to create the stuff that people can actually use it with easily. You know, you know, you have the op stack alongside the borrowed security. You can borrow security like, I mean, it's kind of whatever, but you need to build, like, infrastructure and applications on top of that so that people can actually borrow it easily. You need to build a restaked ras to make a lot of people to one click launch restake roll ups. Right.
01:03:21.660 - 01:03:44.980, Speaker A: I don't know if they really solve that part where here's things you can do. Aside from launching cosmos SDK chain with that security and going through governance processes to actually get it included in the AEC was probably another factor that probably made it the reason why their shared security model hasn't really taken off. Like, there's a lot of politics versus just a clean marketplace. Here's applications, here's economic security. Bamdhead.
01:03:46.510 - 01:04:21.530, Speaker C: Yeah, well, now that we're talking about politics, which I hate, there's still some degree of politics in the system. No. And maybe you want to just talk a little bit about what those are. And I know Eigen has this veto council of sorts, and to your point around the analogy of guardrails in place to make sure that the system kind of takes off smoothly. What are the, like, shades of politics in this system and karak?
01:04:22.510 - 01:04:46.882, Speaker A: I mean, in ours, I think. And it's going all the way back to the beginning of the podcast. I've been here since 2013. I've seen the entire crypto landscape change. And I'm not saying that because I'm not trying to say that and say I'm wise, or I'm so wise that, you know, it's well beyond me. That's not the point. It's to say, I really don't believe in this idea of alignment.
01:04:46.882 - 01:05:16.174, Speaker A: I think alignment is kind of a meme. Like, what does it actually mean being ETH aligned and not like, who also, who cares about alignment? Like, who are you really trying to impress here? I think you do a good job, especially when you talk about Solani. Solana has presented a decent challenge to the whole alignment meme. And so I think it's pretty easy to talk to you about it, which is saying, hey, I think it's a whole lima thing is just like, it doesn't matter. Like, let's be adults in the room. Let's talk about what it is. Like, let's not.
01:05:16.174 - 01:05:22.518, Speaker A: I think the other bit of restaking, it's been talked about as like, a lot more than what it is. I've tried.
01:05:22.574 - 01:05:43.630, Speaker C: Well, I try also, when you talk about security, people that talk about alignment don't appreciate correlation. And that, that is at the heart of how you think about insurance and risk management. It is. It boils down, of course, it's Moskowitz. Go study Moskowitz. Efficient portfolio construction frontier. And then tell.
01:05:43.630 - 01:05:46.010, Speaker C: Come talk to me about alignment as it relates to security.
01:05:47.030 - 01:05:48.006, Speaker A: Exactly.
01:05:48.198 - 01:06:26.958, Speaker C: And that's really it. Yeah. So you guys, just to kind of round up for this chapter of the pod, restaking took, took off a lot, particularly as ETH, you know, the beacon chain launches, there's a lot of tokens that are delegated to the light of the world. They're staking their ethereum. And then there's this kind of idea of, oh, you know, there's all this security that's pulled. Let's offer restaking or, you know, to distribute the security in more efficient ways conceptually. We haven't really found out a lot of the what those use cases are really going to be.
01:06:26.958 - 01:06:58.076, Speaker C: There's 20 billion plus of TVL chasing yield, but we haven't really solved the sustainable sources of yield per se. You guys have said, in contrast to Eigen, which is kind of the competitor here, so to speak, they've garnered a lot of TVL, they've been Ethereum aligned. Only ethereum is collateral. It's pristine. That's kind of their stance. You guys say, hey, wait a minute. No, we're going to introduce all kinds of other types of collateral.
01:06:58.076 - 01:07:22.350, Speaker C: We'll have a more laissez faire approach to it and let's just set the right parameters, allow any people, someone to come and, you know, it really depends on the application, the operator and the DSS to figure that out. And that's the market. We're just here to provide a useful platform for the security to be shared in a more efficient way. Because, you know, crypto is not just Ethereum. So far so good.
01:07:22.690 - 01:07:59.796, Speaker A: So far so good. I mean, there's more I can add, I think, on the differentiation stuff, I think, I think from a developer perspective, the way, again, I'm a developer. I'm sitting here defining the protocol as the solidity engineer or the lead solidity engineer. I'm a developer. I understand where it sucks to work with we, since we're going through insurance, we were integrating other protocols. So I understand what sucks when, when integrating other protocols, what design sucks, what designs elegant and simple. And so from a developer standpoint, it's super easy to build on.
01:07:59.796 - 01:08:28.076, Speaker A: Cara, why, you don't have to do any policy. You don't have to jump through politics. You don't have to make sure it's either lined. You can accept whatever collateral. I don't care what chain you deploy it on. We'll deploy on all the EVM chains and soon beyond that, deploy on non EVM chains too. So you don't have to choose some chain alignment or sacrifice what chain you're already, if you're running a project on, for example, arbitrum, right? Say your GMX, like in this case, you can run on the kark infrastructure on arbitrum instead of having to do some bridging between Ethereum main and arbitrum.
01:08:28.076 - 01:09:01.526, Speaker A: And you can accept your GMx token, your GLP token, your arp token, your eth token, anything you want. It's super developer friendly. To build DSS's and get running on para, you don't have to deal with governance votes, you don't have to be aligned, you don't have to take the knee. Super like, that's one thing I should have touched on earlier is it's very easy to build on car. I'm the engineer, right? I'm not six. Six guys have six people between me and the protocol engineer themselves. I'm the lead engineer on the solid protocol, so I have empathy for the end developer.
01:09:01.678 - 01:09:29.919, Speaker C: So what if, I guess on that point, what kind of interest from projects have you seen since you've announced in April? And back to your point, which is probably more interesting, where I wanted to go is these projects that you say need the one to 2 million of security. Like, what are those projects? What do they look like? And what kind of interest from developers have you gotten since you kind of been more public about since April?
01:09:30.339 - 01:09:36.869, Speaker A: Yeah, we got a ton of interest from developers. The developers that we're getting interest from are the ones like, hey, how do I get, how do we, how do we get building?
01:09:36.989 - 01:09:45.489, Speaker C: Like, and have these been EVM based projects or non EVM or both?
01:09:46.189 - 01:10:21.550, Speaker A: I would say predominately EVM, because those are really the only ones I've thought about restaking because it hasn't really been an option for non EVM projects. But we've seen a small sprinkle of non EVM projects come in and say, hey, you know, maybe for example, wormhole, I don't know if you consider it purely EVM or partially in Solana, is purely EVM. Yeah, yeah. And so we're going, people like wormhole, right? And there's a few others are probably announced this week that also have connections to non EVM chains. But for the most part it's been mostly EVM developers. But the type of developer that's come to us is like, hey, how do I get started? Like where docs, let's get the SDK going. And I match the energy.
01:10:21.550 - 01:10:33.820, Speaker A: I'm like, look, let's ship this thing. Let's ship a POC. It doesn't, it can show up POC a testnet. Let's see how it works. Let's see if it makes sense. You have this governance token. Why don't we let that get restaked, huh? Let's give some utility to your governance token.
01:10:33.820 - 01:11:03.942, Speaker A: And this attitude, I think, has done us pretty well. We've have incredible bd work on a bunch of projects and we're focused on shipping pocs and getting them to mainnet. And in terms of types of projects, again, it's been a variety of projects. Again, you have the AI ones, you have existing infrastructure that's trying to add a decentralized component like wormhole. You have restake roll ups or something new and nascent. Yeah, it's a little bit across the board. You've got indexing and data stuff that's actually pretty new.
01:11:03.942 - 01:11:06.610, Speaker A: And that will probably make front ends more decentralized.
01:11:08.390 - 01:11:08.702, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:11:08.726 - 01:11:14.490, Speaker A: A little bit of everything, I think, in the space has reached out and said, hey, we're interested and how do we get started?
01:11:15.390 - 01:11:54.680, Speaker C: Yeah, in this final chapter, I want to get more of your general thoughts. One, how do you measure success and what does success look like for you guys? And if you could touch on that, what are the kind of the major themes that you're focused on in terms of maybe the type of applications? The overarching kind of theme of this chapter in this pod is why does this make crypto a better industry, what you're building? Like how does Karak make it better and what does success mean to you and how does that percolate into the broader industry?
01:11:55.820 - 01:14:02.290, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the over, and you summarize it, why does restaking really matter? And how does it, what does it mean for the end user and who is the end user? And so, you know, for us again, and the whole theme, hopefully, that I presented the podcast, is really cut through a lot of the random verbiage, a lot of the academic memory, I would say, like a lot of, a lot of that stuff to really get down to the nitty gritty of what restaking is, who does it benefit and what it overall means for crypto, in that case, making systems more secure. The way we measure success is look for users. It's like how do we bring utility and yield to the end user? And I already touched on that saying, okay, you have all these tokens, can you give them yield? And if we are able to do that, I think we're successful in the user's eyes, because now we've taken users that have tokens that are potentially otherwise not generating any yield, like governance tokens, and giving them yield and giving them a reason to hold the token beyond up and down price action. The other way we measure success is like three ecosystem. Have we built a ecosystem of partners, of DSS, of operators that have created new types of applications, and those applications are actually getting positive benefit from economic security. So instead of just points, farming all day, is DeFi or is crypto better because of these applications being secured by economic security and versus them just existing in their current form without any economic security ever? Can we enable again new verticals of applications that weren't, that didn't exist before? And can we enable them to be more decentralized and more fair and more open? And I think the third measure is security and slashing. Like I talked about it, once slashing starts happening, people are going to run away.
01:14:02.290 - 01:14:48.930, Speaker A: When we look at security, what's the security of the protocol look like? What are the slashings? How many slashings have occurred? Is there censorship? Is the operator set diverse enough? Is it geographically decentralized? Is it the same 1020 operators that operate on everything? Or is it a good mix of professional operators and home operators? That's the way we're going to measure success here. Again, I don't think it's TVL. TVL really shouldn't be looked at because you know you can have $20 billion tvl but if your security is not good, poof, it's gone. Right? If users aren't satisfied with it, poof, the money's gone. If there's no ecosystem there and there's nothing to put money in, poof, it's gone.
01:14:49.230 - 01:15:29.170, Speaker C: So that's why again, I think we in this industry, we go one step forward and two backwards. And I think of course yields are not sustainable, but thats fine. I think the market naturally has an equilibrium to yields, but what is not really acceptable is the level of just smart contracts every time theres a hack or it really sets us back as an industry. You and I have had these conversations over the years. Until we have robust risk management in place, this industry will not realize its full potential. Just won't there. Throughout history there hasn't been an industry that has really taken off without proper insurance.
01:15:29.170 - 01:15:48.358, Speaker C: Explorers, whaling expeditions, home building and homeowner. It's just you need proper insurance. Otherwise, and we know that this space has a lot of risk. There should be a lot of yield and you should understand where that yield comes from. Otherwise you are the yield and I'll.
01:15:48.374 - 01:16:04.580, Speaker A: Give the frank assessment yield and the risk. Right. I'm not going to say this is going to, this is the, I'm not going to tell you this is the next coming of Jesus for eth or this is the next coming of Christ for ethereum. Right. I'm going to be hey, this is what's happening. And these are the type of yields you're going to get because you do that task and here's the risk you're going to present yourself to.
01:16:04.740 - 01:16:43.120, Speaker C: Yeah, but I think it's a novel endeavor to create a marketplace for security and real time assessment of risk because if you have a really, you know, one of the things that was super interesting was y insure. You remember andre launching why insure so nexus for users that might not be familiar. So the short story is Nexus was required you to do KYC. So only people, if you were farming in a particular defi protocol or putting money in Aave. You could buy insurance, say, for six months, ensuring up to a million dollars in Aave, and you could buy it for $2,000 or whatever. It was, like, super cheap, actually. It's, like, grossly underpriced.
01:16:43.120 - 01:17:20.000, Speaker C: But you had the KYC, so not everyone had access to it. Andre then put a wrapper to that policy and allowed people to sell it, and that created a far more efficient market because it had better price. Hugh and the team at Nexus were pricing the policy, and I had a lot of conversation with Hugh. I was like, how are you pricing it? It just feels really inefficient. My mind is, like, super underpriced. Um, and it's not dynamics, not real time. The market is always going to be a far, far better, um, mechanism to price risk.
01:17:20.000 - 01:18:11.580, Speaker C: Like, look at options, right? I mean, this is. There's a way to do it. Like, if you want to understand the riskiness of a company, go, go look at option pricing. Uh, like, literally black holes, right? Um, and so, uh, I think what you guys are doing is it, in my mind, it's not so much about, can you get the extra yield from your token? Can you get. It's really the hyperbolics of the world that require security, and they can come to this marketplace in a very efficient way and tap into it and plug into it and say, hey, yeah, I need x amount of security. Boom, and you get it. And yeah, the token holders benefit, and the TSS benefit and the entire karak ecosystem benefits, but it really is enabling, lowering the cost of security by creating more flexibility and opportunities for these applications to come in this free marketplace and say, price me security now, and I need it, and boom, you get it.
01:18:11.580 - 01:18:36.080, Speaker C: And that, I think, will, because security is paramount. If you don't care about security, go build a centralized database in web two and just forget about crypto, full stop. And so I think that, to me, is why this is so exciting. Not so much the meme of, like, you restake and then you add yield on top of yield on top of yield. Like, that's irrelevant in my mind. It's not sustainable. It's nothing interesting.
01:18:36.820 - 01:19:07.540, Speaker A: I have a line that I think you would appreciate. It may be a stretch, but I think I've listened to a few of these. So I get. I can, I think I've heard this before from you. Basically, I'll say karak is like, restaping for Solana, not actually literally restating on salon. Let me explain it's like the philosophy of it, right? One, you know, as how Solana presents. So, like, it doesn't care for these alignment needs, right? The way Solana is presented itself, it really cares for building for 20 years in the future.
01:19:07.540 - 01:19:18.900, Speaker A: Same here. We don't care about the politics, we don't care about alignment. It's just build a great product for the end user. The users will come and hopefully it'll be success if the idea actually works out.
01:19:20.000 - 01:20:14.514, Speaker C: Presumably also cheaper or more efficient, because if you allow more types of collateral, then that should expand the opportunity set. Now, of course, like bitcoin is now all the rage, right? And you're going to see much more flexibility there. You get a bunch of activity happening there after taproot upgrade, you're going to have, you know, Solana in of itself. You have, you know, the high throughput chains, aptos, say sui, you know, avalanche, like, those are all viable collateral types. Not only that, but like, we haven't even touched on this, but, like, from a customer acquisition standpoint and attracting just a lot. Alignment, like is a thing in terms of, like, by allowing other types of collateral on the margin, it's beneficial because you tap into those communities and all of a sudden that if you're a application that, that, that is interesting, that on the margin, like, you care about that, right? You care about tapping into the users of Solana and other chains, right, wherever they may be.
01:20:14.682 - 01:20:40.362, Speaker A: Yep. Quick side. There's also a perspective where there's a. And there's a world where most of these tokens that actually end up being restaker. Governance tokens versus pristine collateral. It gives use to governance tokens that otherwise previously didn't have a use, allows them to be used for some limits. You want a mix of good collateral and governance tokens, but you can give use tokens that didn't have a use.
01:20:40.362 - 01:21:18.104, Speaker A: And I think that's actually super powerful for a lot of end users. People may not care about restaking at all, but if you're saying, hey, I can enable you to do something, that token that otherwise you couldn't do anything all with, that's actually pretty compelling for a lot of users. And then on the other side, institutions too, right? Institutions hold bags of all these various tokens. They'd be willing to restake if they could, if they could with governance tokens. But, yeah, back to the Solana thing, I was saying, and I think you touched on it, it's like, hey, you got all these pristine collateral types of sui and aphthos and Solana and all these other different chains. There's a notion that EVM should be the only place and ethereum itself should be the only place. Restate lives, and it's the only game in town.
01:21:18.104 - 01:21:49.918, Speaker A: And again, we're here to challenge that. It's like, create the free market and make it exist everywhere, make it exist in all the chains. Anyone can show up and create two sides in the marketplace, and in the end, the person that benefits is the users. They're able to restake on their preferred chain or the chain they're working on. Developers can deploy on the chains that already exist on. We're here to work and develop for developers in the future, not just where everyone is today. But, yeah, that's sort of the long way of saying it's like.
01:21:49.918 - 01:21:53.438, Speaker A: Sort of like the Solana philosophy, right?
01:21:53.494 - 01:21:57.930, Speaker C: Yeah. You just care about the end user and making it just a far better experience.
01:21:58.350 - 01:21:59.250, Speaker A: Exactly.
01:21:59.870 - 01:22:21.376, Speaker C: So just to round it up, I mean, I think this has been a very balanced discussion. Obviously, I'm biased. I've known you for years. I am an investor, and, you know, no surprise there. I hope that this discussion has been balanced and I want to end it with that tone. In terms of. I think there are time and time again in crypto, it's important to just appreciate that there are unknowns.
01:22:21.376 - 01:23:17.512, Speaker C: And I think this wouldn't be a proper discussion about risk if we didn't probably end this episode with just that type of closing. In terms of. I think we've touched on a couple of the things that while this creates a marketplace and it creates the ability to share security, the ability to distribute it more efficiently for different types of applications, and ultimately create a more efficient market to price security, which I think is beneficial. The unknowns and the things that might, you know, we ought to just pay attention to is, you know, that this dynamic of anyone, the permissionless, has both a blessing and a curse, sometimes it's important. The user might note, I fully appreciate, you know, might just see higher yield, but it's like when you go and buying, like a bond. Right? And if the coupon's 40%. Well, yeah, yeah, it's 40%.
01:23:17.512 - 01:23:50.830, Speaker C: But what does that tell you about the viability of the company, of the issuer? So I think it's. We touched on this, but I just want to reemphasize, and I want you to comment on it sort of the making sure that, you know, the DSS, you know, understanding, like that type of operator, maybe creating a dashboard. Right, like the l two dashboard is really good. You see which one have fraud proofs which don't? A ranking system, maybe a rating system of these operators to make sure you know which are good. What's their track record? Would you agree with that? Is that something you guys are developing?
01:23:51.210 - 01:24:16.506, Speaker A: Yes, I think, I mean it makes complete sense like these. The end product that you're restating to is a highly technical thing that. And if you're not an engineer, you're really not going to know what's the. How it actually works. Hence also why we have credit rating agencies in real life. Because you can assign. It's very easy to assign a letter to something and for the most people be like, yeah, very easy to understand the letter.
01:24:16.506 - 01:24:37.340, Speaker A: Right. Yeah, but something like this, very technical. There's going to be a very specific amount of people that can actually understand what's going on. And so I think one thing that's done decently well right now for restaking as the LRT's because you've sort of offloaded the. And delegated at least as a small user.
01:24:37.420 - 01:24:38.480, Speaker C: You talk about like.
01:24:40.980 - 01:24:59.356, Speaker A: Etherfy, like a swell. You offloaded it to them and they're there to make the informed decision on where to allocate the capital. Yeah. Yes. You, you may have a principal asian problem, but for them their goal is to make sure the capital stays in their protocol. And the way they're going to do that is providing competitive yield to a low amount of risk. Right.
01:24:59.356 - 01:26:03.460, Speaker A: So you've sort of, you know, by using an LRt you've sort of offloaded your risk analysis to someone else that's actually nitty gritty deep in staking and the restaking that actually has a direct line to the DSS's that they allocate to and the operators that are operating for them. And so I think that's one good thing we've done in the restaking cycle is create some layers of abstraction for the end user so they're not actively having to do this themselves unless you're sophisticated enough. But I think, yeah, you have to create dashboards. You have to create, you have to take audits for the DSS's. You have to sit there. And I think every user should at least look and figure out what their money is being allocated to, even though it's inconvenient and maybe technical and time consuming as good practice, you should figure out what this allocating to, what the source of the yield actually is. Is it a governance token or is it actually something sustainable? And you should become familiar with the risks and you shouldn't just, you know, chase the next farm because it could end poorly.
01:26:03.460 - 01:26:19.880, Speaker A: So, yeah, I mean, this is like anything else in the industry. You should always put time and due diligence it yourself to make sure it makes sense to you. If it's, you know, if it's a lot of word salad and fugazi. Fugazi. Maybe stray away from it. Right. Like, be very.
01:26:19.880 - 01:26:53.840, Speaker A: I hope I present it. Restating is not very complex. It's pretty straightforward. You don't need research papers or even a white paper to explain it. You have a task, you have a reward, and you have a slashing condition if the task is messed up. This is why I'm starting small in TVL, right? That's why instead of having a large amount and chopping it down, like, you start small and you allocate more and more and more as the DSS matures, just from a time perspective, as it develops, as adds better docs and as people come to an understanding of actually what's going on. Nothing.
01:26:53.840 - 01:27:18.312, Speaker A: Like, you can write all you want in a paper, but nothing tells you how things are going to go better than actually running it. No one's going to tell you how the wisdom, the crowd's going to shape up. If no one's going to tell you how to analyze crypto twitter sentiment about your DSS, no one's gonna. You can't predict any of that. Start small, build up from there. And that's been our philosophy. It's like, this is the way it's gonna work.
01:27:18.312 - 01:27:30.968, Speaker A: If something sucks, at least, or something is risky, hopefully doesn't get too much capital, and it can be de risk or, you know, compelled to shut down before it becomes too much of a nuisance.
01:27:31.144 - 01:27:52.380, Speaker C: Yeah. Wise words from someone that started when they were 13 and still fairly young. Very, very interesting discussion. Hopefully this has been. I mean, I want to bring you guys on the pod just to talk about risk, because I enjoy our private conversations. A lot of it just generally about the direction of risk and where this entity is going. And we both share that passion.
01:27:52.380 - 01:27:57.984, Speaker C: We talk about it, you know, insurances and risk. Talking about risk is sexy, at least for a few of us.
01:27:58.032 - 01:28:00.180, Speaker A: That's the most boring topic in the world, right.
01:28:00.580 - 01:28:22.800, Speaker C: It's the most important, I think, for crypto security and then creating more robust risk management solutions in place, and I think you guys are moving in that direction. So really exciting for what you guys are doing. Thanks for coming on and sharing your thoughts, Drew. I think parting thoughts and also where best place for people to follow you or learn more about karak.
01:28:23.460 - 01:29:08.290, Speaker A: Yeah. Parting thoughts. If you're a developer and you're thinking about restaking or potentially adding restaking to your application or building something new, and you don't want to go and like, build your own operator set and or build your own chain, and you want to, you know, if you want to focus on building the thing that makes you different versus the same, like the same peer to peer consensus stuff, you want to make something super fast and super secure, reach out. You know, we're a fast moving team. You reach out, you'll be talking with me within a few hours if you need Beverly, and we can start moving and coding pretty fast. If you're a user and you want to potentially restake some of your assets, we offer a wide variety of assets on currently our v one. So you can deposit things like EtH, EtH, LSTs, LRT's, pts governance tokens, things like blast even.
01:29:08.290 - 01:29:35.230, Speaker A: We offer a wide variety because again, I'm trying to tell the story of all the assets that we can accept in the future. And then if you are an operator of compression, operators can always reach out and yeah, you can find us on Twitter karak, underscore network, karak.net work. I don't. We don't have a white paper, actually. We never wrote a white paper because we just never felt the need to build the product that improved the point. No need to, you know, write a paper that ten people will read.
01:29:35.530 - 01:29:38.042, Speaker C: But there is documentation on the site. People can go, no.
01:29:38.066 - 01:29:40.450, Speaker A: Yeah, there's really good developer documentation.
01:29:40.570 - 01:29:42.682, Speaker C: There's very good developer. Yeah, yeah.
01:29:42.746 - 01:29:48.310, Speaker A: Written ingress, no math. Like, I know there's literally no latex math equation in our documentation.
01:29:51.060 - 01:30:15.430, Speaker C: Plain English. A 13 year old, the next 13 year old, Drew, that's listening to this and can go and look at it and maybe get started. Really good story, Drew. Thanks for coming on again and really enjoyed this discussion and hopefully users let me start. Listeners enjoyed it as well. And if you have any comments or want to learn more about it, just always comment on YouTube. You know, we're reading, uh, them and commenting on them.
01:30:15.430 - 01:30:22.534, Speaker C: So, uh, I look forward to seeing some of those. Uh, but otherwise, thanks, everyone for listening. And, um, yeah, we'll be back, uh, next week with a roundup.
01:30:22.622 - 01:30:23.534, Speaker A: Thanks, auntie.
01:30:23.702 - 01:30:24.650, Speaker C: Thanks, ru.
01:30:24.950 - 01:30:42.760, Speaker B: All right, you heard about, say a couple times, just want to give them one last shout out. Big thanks to say, for sponsoring this episode of Empire. There are a ton of reasons to build on. Say, if you want to get in touch with them, you can reach out to me. I'll put you in touch directly with the team. You can also get in touch with them on twitteray you can follow the journey at Save network. They are currently live.
01:30:42.760 - 01:30:51.720, Speaker B: They've got save v two on public Devnet today. Mainnet goes live later in Q two. Really excited to have say sponsoring and partnering with us on this episode of Empire.
