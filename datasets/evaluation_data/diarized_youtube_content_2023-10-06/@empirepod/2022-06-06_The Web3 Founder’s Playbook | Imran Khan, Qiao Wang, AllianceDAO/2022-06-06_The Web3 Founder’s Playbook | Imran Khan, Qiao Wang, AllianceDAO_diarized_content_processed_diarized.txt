00:00:00.360 - 00:00:47.446, Speaker A: This episode is brought to you by Paraswap, the leading aggregator to find best prices across various dexes. You'll hear more about them later in the show. All right, everyone, we have Chow and Imran from Alliance Dao, two of a, the top minds in crypto who have kind of a front row seat to the latest trends and developments in web3, but also two of my favorite people. They're back. We did an episode with them in January of this year, about six months ago, when they announced Alliance Dao's $50 million raise. For those of you who don't know Alliance Dao, they are the most powerful accelerator in crypto they've had. I might botch these numbers, but I think it's 80 plus startups, maybe 90 startups, over $13 billion in combined, combined value, go through their accelerator program.
00:00:47.446 - 00:00:54.494, Speaker A: Their Dow community has 120 mentors, over 400 network members. Ciao, Imran. Welcome to Empire, guys.
00:00:55.034 - 00:00:55.746, Speaker B: Thanks for having us.
00:00:55.770 - 00:00:56.730, Speaker C: Thanks for having us.
00:00:56.882 - 00:01:00.386, Speaker A: Yeah. How did I do on that intro? Did we, did we get some of the numbers right?
00:01:00.570 - 00:01:06.146, Speaker C: I have no idea. I don't know what the latest numbers is.
00:01:06.330 - 00:01:06.986, Speaker A: Good.
00:01:07.130 - 00:01:09.214, Speaker B: We've had about 140 startups.
00:01:09.954 - 00:01:11.106, Speaker A: 140 startups.
00:01:11.170 - 00:01:13.634, Speaker B: Outside of that, all the numbers were right.
00:01:13.794 - 00:01:48.810, Speaker A: Amazing. Amazing. All right, guys, so here's what I want to do with this episode is I really want to give some advice to founders and builders, you, as to how to handle the markets. Um, we're recording this on june 1. The market is, uh, what feels like we're maybe six months into a bear market. A lot of people are maybe saying, do we have three months to go? Do we have six months to go? Do we have 18 months to go? How should I, should I cut my burn like crazy? Should I do layoffs? Like how should I handle this market? And so I want to get your guys feedback there. But before we get into that, I thought it would be helpful to just start with almost a state of the market to get your guys viewpoints as to where we are right now.
00:01:48.810 - 00:01:54.706, Speaker A: So, chow, I think I'd throw this first question to you. What is your state of the market today?
00:01:54.890 - 00:03:06.978, Speaker C: This is a very tough question because like, well, I think first of all, no one has a crystal ball as to where the market is going, but it's safe to say that this is the first crypto cycle where our industry is very much intertwined with the rest of the macroeconomy. So if the macroeconomic everything will trickle down into crypto from the public market, public stock markets, all the way down to crypto markets all the way down to venture markets, private markets, it's a snowball effect all the way down from the top. So in that sense, it's very hard to predict. But the advice that I see a lot of traditional funds give to their startups, the consensus that everyone should, all the founders should tighten their belt, stay lean, try to have at least a year or two worth of Runway in a market like this. I can't disagree with that advice. It's the prudent thing to do. I like to be contrarian, but for something like this, it does not make sense to be contrary.
00:03:06.978 - 00:04:12.578, Speaker C: Like if the market does not give you the opportunity to raise at a very favorable valuation over the next twelve months or so, which is a big possibility, then you should try to stay lean, because startups are path dependent. If you die, you die. If you run out of money, you die. There's no way to come back. So I think it's prudent for founders to stay lean. That said, the advice that I give to our founders is extremely case by case, it's specific to the situation of every startup, because some startups have raised a ton of money, they have a ton of Runway, which actually makes it a good opportunity to really go aggressive and to expand their market share in a market like this, because a lot of competitors will give up. Right? But there's other startups that hadn't raised a lot of money that have like maybe six months of Runway left, in which case it makes more sense to cut the fat and to stay lean.
00:04:12.578 - 00:04:34.514, Speaker C: But the exact number of like when you, when you should start raising, how much you should start raising, how much you should cut, that kind of stuff is extremely case by case, I really hate to give like a generic advice to all the founders, but in general, that's how I think about these. Imran, I'm curious how you think, because you and I have been firefighting a lot for our founders, different startups, but I'm curious what you think as well.
00:04:34.894 - 00:05:38.180, Speaker B: Yeah, and it also a lot depends on what stage the founders are in. So if you're a pre seed, pre idea stage, then ultimately you have a different set of parameters that you're dealing with, whereas you have a founder, maybe you have a team that's built a product and is looking at traction, and there's a different set of parameters that they have to deal with. So dealing with the first, which is a pre seed and idea phase, primarily speaking, founders are looking out, looking to go out and raise capital. They're looking to validate the community and etcetera. And what we found is that investors are more diligent in regards to the type of idea they want back. They want to see some traction, they want to see an MVP, and they want to see how the founders think about hiring and recruiting as well in this landscape. So investors and everyone around it are becoming more diligent in regards to how they should be backing these startups, the ones that have raised capital in the past and now are firefighting with them.
00:05:38.180 - 00:06:12.240, Speaker B: It's becoming much, much harder to raise capital at the valuations that they were looking at. In fact, some of the founders that I've been working with have brought their valuation down by at least one order of magnitude, just so that they can close out the round and get the capital they need for the next two to three years. And in those cases, you know, what I tell founders is it isn't about the valuation, it isn't about your ego. You just need to raise the capital close around and get back to work. And that's what we've been telling founders on both, both of those stages.
00:06:12.392 - 00:06:42.346, Speaker A: Yeah, go. Default alive sides, right? Instead of default, dead chow. You mentioned one interesting point there, which is this is the first time that crypto has been so intertwined with macro and just with the global macro markets. And one thing that comes to mind there is that a lot of folks in crypto say this is just another cycle. Right? Every couple of years we go through another cycle. But the counterargument there is that this is actually the first time in history that crypto has been fighting fed, in fighting the kind of global, global macro markets, right. We've been.
00:06:42.346 - 00:07:09.786, Speaker A: Right. Crypto since what, January 2009, has been riding this like massive global macro bull market. And for the first time in history, we're going into what feels like a kind of global macro bear market. I don't know if it's a year long, two years long. I don't know if it looks like the Great Depression or the 2000 dot bubble or the 2009 great, great financial crisis. Global financial crisis. I don't know what it looks like, but it does feel like macro is turning around.
00:07:09.786 - 00:07:19.194, Speaker A: So, chow, does this make you think differently about how this bear market could play out in terms of either the intensity or the duration of it?
00:07:19.314 - 00:08:00.480, Speaker C: Yeah, I think there is a very strong likelihood that this is the last cycle in a traditional crypto cycle sense. But also, like, do you even consider this one as a full cycle? Because last cycle we went from around, was it 1200 to 20,000? Right. So call it like 20 x, whereas this cycle went from 20,000 to 60,000. It's a three x. Like, the magnitude of increase is much smaller than the last cycle. Do you even call this a cycle? Right, so maybe the cycle hasn't ended. Maybe this is the last cycle.
00:08:00.480 - 00:08:25.246, Speaker C: Maybe this was not a cycle at all. I think going forward, it's very likely that crypto is going to trade like Nasdaq, probably with a lot of alpha, still like a lot of potential outperformance compared to Nasdaq, but cycle wise, it's quite likely to trade alongside the rest of the risk assets.
00:08:25.440 - 00:08:29.734, Speaker A: Does that make crypto less exciting from an investment perspective?
00:08:30.794 - 00:09:26.704, Speaker C: So, I mean, if we use the language of traditional finance, like beta versus alpha, the beta is. Yes, beta has become a lot less exciting and a lot less predictable. The last few cycles were actually fairly predictable, at least in hindsight. Every single one of past cycles, we had a blow off top. These things are extremely predictable. If you study history of markets, the beta was very predictable, was very large in magnitude, whereas this current cycle, and going forward, beta is a lot less exciting, but the alpha is still there. Unless you think that there's no more growth, no more new innovation in crypto, there's a lot of opportunities for investors to pick outperforming assets in this market.
00:09:27.004 - 00:09:42.340, Speaker A: Imran, do you look at it the same way, kind of minimizing cycles as time goes on, and that each maybe cycle is less violent than the last one? Or do you agree with chao that maybe this is the last cycle? What's your view on this?
00:09:42.412 - 00:10:40.944, Speaker B: I think we're part. I agree with Chao, but I also think that for every cycle that we go through, we are bringing more and more participants into the ecosystem, which would make it less and less volatile over a fixed period of time. I do think we are in a phase right now where we're growing up, especially given the fact that institutions are thinking about crypto as a part of their investment strategy, product strategy, and then even thinking about where they will exist in the next decade to two decades. So we're starting to see that already. And so I do think we're at a period where crypto is growing up, and a lot of it's going to start to correlate with traditional markets. But I also think that just because we're growing up doesn't mean that there is an opportunity for growth. And I do think there are still incredible startups that are being built right now that will ultimately take people off guard.
00:10:40.944 - 00:11:02.108, Speaker B: We could talk about Stepn and others that have really came out of nowhere and started to build partnerships with large like shoe brands. And I think we're going to see many, many use cases like that that will come really out of the left field and we'll start to kind of grow tremendously. So I do think there's a lot of opportunities to left in the markets.
00:11:02.196 - 00:11:21.766, Speaker A: Starting to get into the founder advice type of things, uh, side of things. How do you advise folks who are maybe on the earlier stage, let's say 10, 15, 20 employees right now, who are thinking about maybe launching a new product, maybe thinking about releasing their token? Like do you, do you pull back, do you pause right now or do you actually just continue forward?
00:11:21.870 - 00:12:23.036, Speaker B: This is probably the best time to launch a token or a product. There's a lot of noise during the bull market where you confuse, you know, token price with attraction of a company. And you've seen this happen many, many times throughout this last bull cycle. And when reality hits for these startups and the community start to see what really the startup is, the token price ends up going down. There's no product traction and then there's a lot of pointing fingers at different influencers and community members on why they bought the token or may have used the product. So there's a lot of confusion that ends up happening. So what we always tell founders is, in fact that this is probably the best time to build a product and this is probably the best time to launch as well because you get to actually get the real metrics in regards to the product that you're building and start to get like tighter feedback loops and then start to grow from there.
00:12:23.036 - 00:12:26.866, Speaker B: And so, in fact, I always tell founders this is probably the best time to launch products.
00:12:26.980 - 00:12:59.332, Speaker A: You had this post back in March, March of 2022, about three months ago, talking about customer acquisition costs and why merging in investors and customers into one group is, I think you put it like it's akin to customer acquisition cost, CAC on leverage. Can you just kind of expand on these thoughts as we start to talk about kind of. I want to talk about token vesting, composability partnerships, and I think one good place to start is just customer acquisition cost. As we head into a market where maybe it's a little tougher to acquire customers than in the past.
00:12:59.508 - 00:14:24.318, Speaker B: Yeah, customer acquisition cost is, you know, in the web, two space is ultimately you set aside a budget and you use that budget as a way to use Facebook ads, you use Twitter ads, and you try to get customers to start to use your product. It's like a recruiting funnel for customers. And in the web, three standpoint, you know, we don't really, we can't really advertise on Twitter or Facebook because ultimately you have to be crypto native. And so token ends up becoming this kind of customer acquisition strategy where you're able to attract your early customers, your early investors believe in your product, that use your product, then ultimately the goal is to hope to make them wealthy or better off by using the product. But the problem with this is that, as I mentioned before, this is like CAC on leverage, which is like, it's a great way to attract customers and investors to back your startup, but it also could hurt them, because if the product isn't sustainable or what you're building isn't working, you could have the opposite effect. Case in point is, Luna, people were very excited about the decentralized stablecoin, but when the product didn't end up working out the way it should have, all the people that invested or believed in the product ended up getting hurt. And so CAC is a very important tool for crypto startups.
00:14:24.318 - 00:15:08.050, Speaker B: What we advise our startups is don't use token, don't launch a token, or don't use a token as a way to attract users early on. What you want to do is you want to use your product. Your product should be your go to market strategy, and it should be a foundational layer for your community. Because without product or traction, the token in itself is just going to create more noise in both directions in a very wrong way. And so I'll point to a case study. Dydx, they started back in 2016 or 2017. They ended up releasing the product around 2018, and around 2020 or 2021, they launched a token, I think 2021.
00:15:08.050 - 00:15:28.312, Speaker B: So it took them like four years before they even launched a token. By then they were already very close to being competitive. Uniswap in terms of trading volume. Then they dropped the token and they surpassed Uniswap. And so token should be used as a way to double down on your growth strategy. It shouldn't be your only growth strategy.
00:15:28.448 - 00:15:54.332, Speaker A: Yeah, I think you've seen a lot of the L2s do this as well. Look at someone like optimism. Optimism built an incredible product. And then, and a lot of the scaling solutions have done the same thing. They didn't actually launch a token. They built a product that people love and that people actually use, and then they're releasing a token chow. How do you think about when is the right time to do a Dao? And I think maybe it'd be interesting to look at some of the numbers of Alliance Dao.
00:15:54.332 - 00:16:20.434, Speaker A: If you just know anything off the top of your head, like, how many of the port codes, if you have 100 port cos or 50 port codes in the new cohort, or, I don't know how many are in the new cohort cohort. How many are structured like a Dao from day one? And do you think that those numbers are right? Like, should people. Should founders think about structuring as a dow from day one? Is it structured as a dow, but don't actually be too decentralized? Like, how do you think about that right now?
00:16:21.934 - 00:16:44.506, Speaker C: I think we might have talked about this in our last time I came on here, but my view hasn't changed is don't. Don't. Don't do a dao. Don't do a dao. Initially said from Alliance Dao. Yeah, I mean, we were not like alliance. Now we're not.
00:16:44.506 - 00:17:38.684, Speaker C: About two years ago, when we first started, we talked about it, and we knew that it was going to be very difficult. And even today, even. Even though we're called alliance style, a lot of our, uh, internal, you know, uh, governance or decision making or interactions between the various members, uh, like, does not follow, like, what you typically see on those, like, you know, governance forums, which I believe is, um, extremely inefficient for. And it just totally nonsensical for the vast majority of projects. Um, I think daos could make sense for a very small category of products, which are, I guess, some sort of fairly low level protocols.
00:17:39.784 - 00:18:08.678, Speaker A: All right, everyone, quick break from the show to share a big update from our friends at Pariswap. The best platform to stake, swap, trade, farm, and more. Paraswap just launched. Gas refunds. Based on how much you stake, you can now get up to 100% of your gas refunded on all of your swaps on Paraswap. This is huge for anyone who has spent a lot of time in defi, or maybe it's just starting out. You know, how egregiously expensive the gas transactions can get.
00:18:08.678 - 00:18:29.550, Speaker A: The gas fees are ridiculous at some points in time, and now you can get those entirely refundable funded on Paraswap. To participate, all you need to do is stake a minimum of 500 psp. Big shout out to the paraswap dow for making these refunds possible. Really, it's just. It's tough to be Paraswap right now. They give you the best prices. They save you money.
00:18:29.550 - 00:19:12.260, Speaker A: You've got this gas refund. If you stake PSP, they've got a smooth and really user friendly interface, fast swapping. It's really everything that you'd want from a DeFi platform if you don't use them already. Check out Paraswap today at paraswap IO. Now let's get back to the show. Why do we even need daos? I guess, in the first place, if all of this is kind of just going back to what something like a board of directors looks like, where you've got people who vote on a board, and then the board makes decisions at the company, like very high level decisions at the company, usually capital allocation, large capital allocation decisions. And then you've got a bunch of teams, like a vp of marketing, a VP of sales, a vp of engineering, who just actually execute everything.
00:19:12.260 - 00:19:29.664, Speaker A: It seems like that model is actually working pretty well right now. And it seems like that's where your thesis on where daos go back to. But on the other end, I hear you saying daos one day will have a trillion dollars of capital in their treasuries. So obviously, you're quite optimistic about Daos.
00:19:30.644 - 00:19:35.984, Speaker C: So the question is, why do we even need daos if the traditional company structure works so well?
00:19:36.084 - 00:19:37.288, Speaker A: If it works at all? Yeah.
00:19:37.376 - 00:20:22.748, Speaker C: Yeah. There's a couple of reasons. One is daos are digitally native and borderless. Starting a company that is borderless and transnational is extremely difficult when you work with multiple jurisdiction at the same time. So daos remove that barrier. Two is imagine in the early days of Uber, if Uber wanted to incentivize its drivers with uber equity, it was not possible because you would have to ask for 10,000 Uber drivers to sign paperwork. Imagine the amount of legal friction behind that.
00:20:22.748 - 00:21:03.636, Speaker C: So daos removed that kind of legal friction as well, in terms of incentivizing early contributors. So, basically, the point of daos is actually very analogous to nfts. The point of daos is to remove frictions associated with traditional legal framework. People also talk about nfts as digital native intellectual property, which completely removes the traditional legal framework from it. And that possibly enables a bunch of new use cases. So that is fundamentally the value proposition of daos compared to traditional companies.
00:21:03.820 - 00:21:17.596, Speaker A: Imran, if a founder comes to you today and says, look, we've got four people right now, we've got this amazing idea, we've got our mvp built out. We just raised our seed, million dollar seed, and we're a Dao, what's your advice to them?
00:21:17.740 - 00:22:18.536, Speaker B: My biggest advice is build a product and build an early community around the product. It's the same advice I give about the token as well. If startup was to announce a token, because there's no point in building a community without a product that community is attracted to. The product could be anything, right? But if there isn't, like early traction in regards to why communities are coming together for a, for a certain reason, there's no point in building it down is my number one response to what I hear. What I tell founders early on is build out the product, find out who your first users are, and double down on those users by building more and more set of products that allows them to attract even a larger community. Then from that community you can start to think about ways to decentralize certain operations in a way that could be very scalable for the founder and the startup itself. I'll talk about Makerdao.
00:22:18.536 - 00:23:12.434, Speaker B: Actually, Makerdao first started off as a dAo. They attracted incredible amount of talent and they realized that they can't continue to scale or grow without being centralized. So they announced the product back in 2018, and then they also called out to become a foundation. They want to revert back to becoming a foundation. So they put a vote out and they brought everyone back in from a DAO to a centralized organization. And from 2018 to 2021, they built out this incredible growth marketing strategy where their biggest goal was to integrate Dai into as many protocols as possible. So if you look at their grow to market team or their marketing team, they had maybe like, I don't know, 2025 people, once they felt like they've hit critical mass, they put out another vote and they killed the foundation and they became a dAo.
00:23:12.434 - 00:24:14.798, Speaker B: So all of the like marketing teams and the business teams and the risk team, they ended up becoming subdaos or daos, with its own branding, nothing associated with Makerdao. And now, like all of those teams are running very, very efficiently because they have a very clear protocol on how to, how to propose vote changes into Makerdao and how that should be run moving forward. And so, and it took, Makerdao launched in 2014, like their white paper launched in 2014, and now coming up to almost 2022, they just became a Dao again. So like I said, like, you can't just go out, raise money and become a Dao. It just doesn't work that way. You have to build a product. You have to build an incredible engine that allows you to support the product over a long period of time, build a long term sustainable community that loves the product and that will do anything to get up in the morning and build on the product.
00:24:14.798 - 00:24:23.874, Speaker B: And then over time, you let it go and you allow the community to take over and allow them to kind of think about what they think the product should be moving forward.
00:24:24.174 - 00:24:33.434, Speaker A: Does this change how you think about growing and scaling a team? And maybe just a broader question is, like, how is growing and scaling a team in web two different than web3?
00:24:34.314 - 00:25:26.054, Speaker B: Yeah, it does, actually. Like, even for us, the way we're thinking about building our team, it's very lean. You know, 20 and 30 people Max is the way we're thinking about it. Because ultimately, what you want to think about is where can certain parts of our business units could be scaled through? Community is the way we think about it. So ultimately, in order for us to build the best talent pool, we have to bring on the best people that are, like, ultimately founders, because founders or ex founders or like incredible business leaders can navigate through ambiguity. And so if you look at, like, even alliance style, I'd say almost, you know, 80, 90% of our team is, were former founders. And we did that purposefully, because ultimately, we're founders.
00:25:26.054 - 00:26:11.744, Speaker B: We're all going to end up, you know, taking on certain business units and then ultimately, like, driving that initiative moving forward. And so you'll see our organization, you'll probably see, like, a hierarchy. And in this hierarchy, we'll see, like, you know, let's say five subunits. Any could be business go to market product engineering, and let's say risk or marketing or regular regulations. And the sub units will ultimately be closed to begin with. But I could see our Dao opening up a bit to the community where some of the people that want to contribute to any of these subunits can work with the business leaders to do so. And that kind of opens up the community as a way for us to hire some of the best talent that's coming out of the space.
00:26:11.744 - 00:26:32.598, Speaker B: And we think by having a semi open, like, talent pool or community engagement funnel, this gives us a really good ability to think about what does decentralization looks like over time. But I would say in the short to medium term, we're going to be closed, and in the long term, we'll be probably a bit open to the.
00:26:32.726 - 00:27:31.614, Speaker C: There's a specific type of daos just occurred to me, there's a specific type of daos for which a DaO structure could make a lot of sense from the get go, which is, I tweeted about this a few weeks ago, it's basically sort of incubator of creators. So it's basically like alliance style or Y combinator for creators, for extremely high risk, high reward kind of professionals. And so it could be like YouTube TikTok creators. It could be like people doing extremely creative work, like chefs. It could be pro gamers, right? Like, you know, programmers could make a lot of money, but the career risk is also extremely high. There's a lot of examples of musicians, for example, like a Dao for musicians, that could also make sense. And basically the Dao would have three roles.
00:27:31.614 - 00:28:39.448, Speaker C: The first role is to scout and to pick and to invest in these, like, super high potential creators. The second role is to build tools to support them. And the third role is to market these creators to the outside world. And the reason why a Dao could make a lot of sense for these is because these daos are basically, they should be composed of other people, successful people who happen in the industry. So for instance, the DaO could be formed by a bunch of very successful YouTube creators or musicians or pro gamers. And what they would do initially is they would vote on new creators that they would want to bring into the DaO. This is one of the key differences between, you know, these creator daos versus a startup incubator.
00:28:39.448 - 00:29:22.124, Speaker C: Daos like ours is because for something like us alliance Dow, we need to be extremely contrarian. We cannot let the entire DaO vote on every single startup. It's never going to work. However, for something like creators, those professionals tend to know who else have the potential to become just like them. Right? So in that sense, voting actually makes a lot of sense for these dolls. So like this actually analogous to like this idea of a token register, token curated registry, which, which was one of the biggest ideas in 2018, and people started surfacing the idea again. But it's basically that, like, you have token curated registry is basically a DAO that votes on the list, any generic list.
00:29:22.124 - 00:29:49.232, Speaker C: And in this specific example of creator daos, they vote on a list of other creators. So I'm truly excited about this particular sector. Like in fact, in this, in the current alliance style cohort, we have at least three startups that build alongside this thesis and they're starting off as Dallas, basically.
00:29:49.368 - 00:30:00.424, Speaker A: Yeah, Xiao, I remember the token curated registry thesis and I remember, I mean, isn't that what you were working on at Masari? I remember you and Celcis writing about the token curated registry back in like 2018.
00:30:00.544 - 00:30:01.232, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:30:01.408 - 00:30:43.734, Speaker A: One narrative that was really, really hot last year was the l one thesis, and it started to cool down and gave way to some other narratives like scaling and L2s and things like that. We talk a lot about just like different l one s on Empire from maybe more of the investment lens. But I'm curious, as you guys see so many companies that are actually building and making these decisions to build on different l one s, what are the factors that go into advising builders on which l one and really which tech stack to build on? Like, what are you hearing from founders today? How has this changed over the last few months as maybe Sol keeps having downtime, launch of subnets, L2 releases, things like that?
00:30:44.034 - 00:31:29.446, Speaker B: Yeah, ultimately they're going to be every layer one. And L2 has its own community and has its own products. And what I tell founders is look at the communities and products that are being built and look at the tech in the background to see if this is something that's going to align with where you see your company in the next two to five years. And so, like, if you look at Solana, you think about, you know, gaming and nfts. When you think about Ethereum, you think about, you know, pretty much the sandbox for all of creativity, right? Whether it's defi, nfts music, nfts, etcetera. When you think about avalanche, you think about gaming. When you think about, like, arbitrary optimism, you think about doubling down on your growth within Ethereum and the community that has been built over time.
00:31:29.446 - 00:32:24.484, Speaker B: So I think for the most part, everyone is in the business of selling block space. And the question then becomes, what types of communities do you want to compose with, what types of products do you want to work and align with is the way to think about this. And so what I would tell founders is take a step back and take the tribalism out of the picture and think about what do you need fundamentally in order for you to scale your company from zero to 100. If you're looking for transaction throughput and you're looking for zero knowledge proofs as a way to obfuscate certain types of data, then go with Starkware. So I always leave that up to the founder, because the founder ultimately has to decide what tech is going to work best for them. But I lay out all of the options and I let the founder decide, like, you know, what types of communities or companies they want to align with in the long run.
00:32:25.144 - 00:33:42.744, Speaker C: So objectively, based on the two to 3000 startups that we're seeing on an annual basis, by far the top three layer ones, or I should say like ecosystems are in no particular order. Solana, Polygon and Avalanche, right now, probably Solana and Polygon are top two. Avalanche is growing over the past few weeks, I would say avalanche is growing faster just because they started at a much lower starting point. And the specific advice I give to founders, again, this is going to pivot off a lot of people, but the advice I give to founders evolves a lot over time. Like a year ago, I would have said to founders, Solana is up and coming. There is a huge opportunity for land grab, basically anything that has been proven to work on Ethereum, they're obviously going to work on Solana. My advice is different now because it's a little bit more saturated on Solana.
00:33:42.744 - 00:34:44.568, Speaker C: The specific advice I give to founders right now is the following is probably to start building on avalanche. And by the way, we have zero, like, I have zero conflict interest with Avalanche. I don't own Avax or whatever. This is just the advice that I give to our founders. Start building avalanche. And the reason for that is it's up and coming, it's fairly new. And if one day avalanche runs into similar problems as Salon and Polygon, which both layers run into bottlenecks and wind down quite a few times over the past few months, is that even if avalanche runs into those problems because it's EVM compatible, you're going to have a lot of options to migrate onto other EVM chains with minimal amount of migration work.
00:34:44.568 - 00:35:19.400, Speaker C: So it gives you more flexibility, more optionality. This is the specific advice I give to founders. Currently. The best alternative to avalanche might be ethereum L2. They're slightly less battle tested, in my opinion, but they're also up and coming. So arbitram optimism are probably also good options. So that is a very politically incorrect advice I give to our founders.
00:35:19.592 - 00:36:05.064, Speaker A: Yeah, we'll see how this one does on Twitter. Chow, do you think that capital starts flowing back from some of the l one s back over to Ethereum as these L2s get built out and as these L2 start to launch tokens, and it feels like the narrative is really with the ETH L2s right now. Optimism. Arbitrum will capital, and by capital I mean like money, but also human capital and talent. Will that start flowing back to l two s as the maybe bear market takes some of these alt l one s down 90% to 95%, does that drive the demand for some of these back to the quote unquote main chain, back to Ethereum and the l two s?
00:36:05.804 - 00:36:35.832, Speaker C: I'm not really seeing that in terms of talent. So there's still a lot of talent going into Solana. There's still a lot of talent going into non ethereum. Non ethereum l two chains. So I'm not really seeing that in the very early stage, startup. However, the public market is clearly showing signs of that. I don't know if that will have an effect that will trickle down into the private market.
00:36:35.832 - 00:36:51.454, Speaker C: Maybe, maybe not. But yeah, of course this year is the year of Ethereum. It's the merge and all the l two s launching, but yeah, that's just the public market. Imran, what are you seeing? Cause we see different things.
00:36:51.914 - 00:37:26.834, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the pendulum is swinging. Right. So a couple years ago it would have been only ETH, only, right. And because of like scaling and scaling issues and not being able to get transactions through and or the gas fees, founders started to go towards other alt layer ones. And now I think what's happening on the alt layer one side is that they're being battle tested as we speak. Some are going down, some aren't, some are experiencing high gas fees and etcetera. So we're starting to see the pendulum swing back into L2s and like other like interesting solutions.
00:37:26.834 - 00:38:26.244, Speaker B: And with the upcoming like merge and like, you know, move to ETH two, there's a lot of momentum going back into ETH. And I think the pendulum is in a continuous swing back and forth until all of these products, all of these layer ones are somewhat battle tested, are able to take on more and more users. And so I think this is just going to continue to happen over the next couple cycles until all of the alt layer ones and Ethereum, with e two being scaled out, I think that's what's going to continue to happen. Because if you think about it, if you want to replicate all of the Internet, all of the work that's happening on the Internet today, onto, on crypto, on blockchains, you'll need more than one layer one to take on all the transactions that are happening. And so I do believe in the long run we will live in a multi chain world. The question is how long will it take us to get there and what layer ones are going to be ready to take on the influx of builders as they're looking to build their next product.
00:38:27.064 - 00:39:16.966, Speaker A: Let me switch gears a little bit and go back to thinking about just the next twelve months for builders. Maybe give them a little bit of advice. I know just reading a lot of the kind of web two vc's, a lot of their pieces to founders, they're really focused on the metrics, focused on ARR, CAC, LTV, of a user, gross margin, free cash flows. What are the metrics that you look for in a web3 business? Is it total value locked, is it trying to look at what the company does, their core competency? For example, Aaves might be lending. So you try to figure out the core metric for lending, maybe loan utilization rate. Like what is, what are the core metrics that you're looking at and telling founders to optimize for over the next twelve months, but really just in the course of their building career, I would.
00:39:16.990 - 00:39:56.994, Speaker B: Say, one, it depends on what product you're building, right. If you're thinking about DeFi, you know, I think total value locked is a very bad metric because, you know, a lot of it is incentivized through tokens, token incentivization. So the liquidity isn't really sticky. Right, right. It's there, but, you know, it could leave in a heartbeat. So what we look for there is just like actual transactions. What's happening within a Defi protocol? Are they using it as a product to trade? Are they using it as a way to, there's some like metrics that we like, track within Defi protocols that allows us to think, well, okay, so that is like actual, you know, crypto native usage that we're looking for.
00:39:56.994 - 00:41:29.684, Speaker B: So for like an example of Uniswap or AAVE could be how much borrow for AavE could be like how much collateral has been collateralized and how much is being borrowing borrowed against, and certain types of reflexivity within the markets, what happens to Aave and the users evolve? Same thing with Makerdao. I say even with Uniswap, you know, how much transaction volume is happening and how is that consistent over a fixed period of time, even DyDx and others. So for Defi, I would say, like transaction volume, I would say lending, like what are the actual metrics within lending, etcetera, now, looking at like games and things like that, I would say, you know, a good metric for games is how many monthly active users are using the product itself. So, and that's pretty easy to capture for like Axie Infinity and others. So monthly active users, daily active users, how long are the users staying around for? How often are they playing the game, et cetera? And I think that's going to hold true for many of the other products that are going to be in this, like that are building space for nfts. As an example is like if you're building a marketplace, then how much of the fees are being captured, how much of the trading volume are you tracking, et cetera? And so I would say, like, what's probably common across all that, all of the sectors I mentioned is like transaction volume, how much of the transactions are going through and hitting and how much of the platform is capturing that volume, whether it's through fees or it's through engagement?
00:41:30.064 - 00:41:34.360, Speaker A: Chow is there one metric or two metrics that you look for when you're talking to founders?
00:41:34.392 - 00:41:59.714, Speaker C: Chad so we work primarily with super early stage startups. So there is no metrics, there's no metrics that really matter. But depending on the product, the one question I tend to ask founders is how many potential customers have you spoken with? That question alone tells me a lot about how the founder thinks about market thinks about product building.
00:42:00.254 - 00:42:02.990, Speaker A: If you're building a tool for daos, how many daos have you gone out.
00:42:03.022 - 00:42:15.514, Speaker C: And spoken with exactly? And what did you learn from those conversations? I like founders who have some very unique insights that I've never heard of before that can teach me something.
00:42:15.864 - 00:42:36.608, Speaker A: Is there any other kind of just big advice as we start to think about wrapping this up? Is there any other big advice that we're missing here? Whether it relates to composability, security regulation, token vesting, anything else that you feel is just really, really crucial for founders to know and for founders to be thinking about right now? And maybe, Imran, I'd throw this to you first and then chow, I'll toss it to you.
00:42:36.776 - 00:43:22.714, Speaker B: Yeah, there's just a lot of noise in crypto and people often forget what they're really set out to do, which is build a great product for people. Some people get very lost on the token side and why they should launch a token. Tokenomics has become an important topic for a lot of founders and why they need to get it right. And to be quite honest, I don't think we have a tokenomics that's actually worked well yet for the protocol, for the users itself. We're still in this ambiguities phase of like the governance token. How does the token capture value, etcetera? So I don't think no one has really found the right answer to that yet. And I would say also like regulations has also stopped a lot of founders from building product.
00:43:22.714 - 00:44:11.424, Speaker B: And what we advise our founders is think about regulations as a part of binding product market fit, which is understand the regulatory landscape or the regimes that you're operating in and find ways to build something that's going to align with those regimes in the long run. Because the last thing you want to do is think about the regulators knocking on your door as you're looking to build out product. So just to sum up, the three things that I would advise founders moving forward is one is don't worry about build a product. Don't worry about the noise in crypto. Build a product that will attract your first users. Tokenomics is not something you need to worry about today. And number three is think about regulations and think about it very importantly as part of your product market fit.
00:44:11.424 - 00:44:14.584, Speaker B: And those are probably the three things I would advise that we're finding.
00:44:14.964 - 00:44:53.054, Speaker C: Yeah, I agree with those points, especially the token economics part. I've been saying for years, don't worry about token economics until you have product market fit. And I think people finally are realizing that. So the industry is have realized that it's probably a good idea to build a product that people love first before playing these token games. So I like to see that. But something that came up recently in our founders forum is that someone asked about community management. I think this is a topic that confuses a lot of founders.
00:44:53.054 - 00:45:47.576, Speaker C: We do group office hours on a weekly basis with our founders. This is a topic that would come up like every other week, like how do we do community management? What are some of the metrics that matter? How do you think about community? So I have a few very strong opinions here. Number one is I think the vast majority of crypto products are not doing community right. Every discord that I go into, it's filled with bag holders and people talking about price and market. That kind of stuff just does not add any value to the product that you're building and is often very distractive to founders. I've had founders ask me in my discord, there's so much fud when the price goes down. How do I handle these? It's so distracting.
00:45:47.576 - 00:46:41.374, Speaker C: These people in our discord that are not users of your product. So I actually wrote about this a couple of months ago. The main way to think about community is to think of the community first and foremost as your user base. Your discord should be your potential users, not the back holders. And the way you interact with your community is to seek product feedback from, from them, is to give them product updates, ask them to try a new feature and give you feedback on how to improve. That is the best way to engage the community while building a great product. So this is something I tell founders all the time.
00:46:41.374 - 00:47:27.974, Speaker C: There's also very a basic mistake that a lot of founders make is they're too obsessed with numbers, such as number of discord, number of people in your discord, number of Twitter followers. These are some of the worst vanity metrics. They don't mean anything. So I asked founders to ignore those numbers because oftentimes quality matters more than quantity. If you have like 100 people in your discord who love your product, who constantly give you product feedback, who are net promoters of your product to their friends, these matters a lot more than the actual total number of people in discord and Telegram and on Twitter or whatever.
00:47:28.274 - 00:47:29.570, Speaker A: Yeah, I love that.
00:47:29.642 - 00:47:30.178, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:47:30.306 - 00:48:09.314, Speaker A: We did something new at permissionless this year, which is we launched our vip tickets were these things called permies, which was a collection of 555 nfts. And there's a private discord channel just for the permie holders. That's token gated, right? You can get in if you own a permy. And after the conference, they basically self organized, created a spreadsheet of all the feedback that they have for the conference. Then they turn that spreadsheet into a Google form. All the 500 permis voted on feedback for the conference, and then they sent it over in an organized fashion to the blockworks events team. And this was just like, I couldn't have orchestrated a better customer feedback thing.
00:48:09.314 - 00:48:31.858, Speaker A: So that was really, really cool to see. And then they also got early access and free access to our research product, and now they're starting to give us feedback on the research product. So it's been really cool to see that happen. So I completely agree with you. Couple of rapid fire questions here as we wrap it up. Not related to founders. Jim Chanos just said Coinbase is tremendously overvalued as the fee feast is set to end.
00:48:31.858 - 00:48:35.374, Speaker A: Chow, I'd throw this to you, Coinbase, overvalued or undervalued?
00:48:36.584 - 00:49:11.434, Speaker C: I tweeted that I bought Coinbase last week at around $50. I don't know where it is now. It's probably up a lot. And by the way, the day after paradigm announced that, or not announced, but I guess it was an SEC filing that they bought 20 or $40 million worth of Coinbase stocks. Is it overvalued now? Is it undervalued? Overvalued now? It's probably still undervalued. I don't know what the market cap is now, but like a few years from now, the venture book of Coinbase is going to be worth more than their total market cap now.
00:49:11.514 - 00:49:12.586, Speaker A: I would have to agree.
00:49:12.730 - 00:49:34.808, Speaker C: And also, it's super funny that Coinbase bonds fell to like $0.50 on the dollar. Like, you have to assume that there's a 50% chance that Coinbase is going bankrupt over the next ten years, which is the expiration date of the bond, which is a ridiculous assumption, right?
00:49:34.936 - 00:49:45.124, Speaker A: Yeah, I would have to agree with you there, Imran prediction here. Robinhood acquired or not acquired by end of year, acquired.
00:49:47.224 - 00:50:51.244, Speaker B: And I say this because there's some interesting dynamics that are happening in space right now. So Sam, with FTX acquired, blockfolio looking to get access to end users that are going to ultimately tap into FTX like trading engine. What's also interesting is that Sam just recently acquired like seven or 8% of Robinhood right after the market took a downturn. In parallel to that, Robinhood announced its own metamask competitor. And so what we're starting to see is the shift, right, which is like who can come in, who can take whose market share? Sam is going after the traditional markets where Robinhood is in today, and Robinhood is trying to get into crypto by going after more of the crypto native companies like Coinbase and FTX. I do think, though this is my personal opinion, that Robinhood will probably fail. And in that time, I think Sam will probably have a sizable chunk of Robinhood.
00:50:55.624 - 00:50:57.324, Speaker C: FTX more than Robinhood.
00:50:57.704 - 00:51:01.536, Speaker B: Yeah. So FTX will probably acquire Robin Hood.
00:51:01.600 - 00:51:05.804, Speaker A: By the end of the year, five years from now. Who's bigger, FTX or Coinbase?
00:51:07.824 - 00:51:19.624, Speaker C: What I'm seeing is Coinbase is going full crypto native, whereas FTX is moving away from being crypto native. So Coinbase is going to win crypto. FTX might win the rest of the market.
00:51:20.284 - 00:51:29.524, Speaker A: Yeah, FTX is really going after the institutional regulatory. They spent over a billion dollars in acquiring licenses last year. It's an interesting observation.
00:51:29.564 - 00:51:35.172, Speaker B: I think Coinbase would probably bigger with Coinbase, cloud and all the other things that they're coming out with, their new.
00:51:35.188 - 00:52:07.542, Speaker A: Staking partnership, liquid staking partnership is also super interesting. NFT market? NFT market in the last 30 days is down 24%. Market cap's down 24%. That's kind of an arbitrary metric of market. Cap of NFTs total sales is down 26% over the last 30 days. How much farther? Maybe chow, I'd start with you here. What happens to the NFT market over the next six months, considering the fact that it feels like the NFT market is maybe the last place in crypto that hasn't, the bottom hasn't completely fallen out from it?
00:52:07.638 - 00:52:27.104, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't have a strong opinion, but if I had to make a bet, because nfts are the furthest along the risk curve, they're probably going to follow the rest and they're going to fall more. And when the market bounces, I would like to think that they're going to.
00:52:27.184 - 00:52:36.484, Speaker A: Bounce after the majors, maybe either for Imran or chao. Why is the NFT market hanging on while the rest of crypto has fallen so much?
00:52:36.924 - 00:53:29.714, Speaker C: I feel, again, this is not a very strong opinion, but I feel like the quote unquote blue chip nfts that really matter, their unit price is so high that their holders are fairly price insensitive. So when the rest of their portfolio, like, for these people, these NFT holders, because they're already pretty wealthy, when the rest of their portfolio drops like 30%, you know, it's not going to matter, it's not going to hurt their life. They wouldn't sell their nfts. Right. But if the, the rest of the portfolio crashes to, like, I don't know, there's, there's a point at which you start feeling the pain and you want to liquidate your riskless asset into the most risk confluence. Right. But again, like, it's not a super strong opinion.
00:53:29.834 - 00:54:16.044, Speaker B: I would also say that some of this is being, if you look at, like, art sales during like, the financial crisis and others, it hasn't really taken a big hit compared to, like, asset prices. And I think it's a, you know, there's a couple things, reasons for these reasons. One is, you know, liquidity. Two is that there is a flight to safety, and people think that art will outlive all the markets and all the volatility in markets. So if you look at, like, generative art as an example, auto glyphs, even if you look at it today, autoglyphs has done pretty well. It bottomed six months ago at around like 115 ETH, and it's roughly at about 189 ETH. And there was three sales that happened within the past couple weeks.
00:54:16.044 - 00:54:46.380, Speaker B: And so people are buying the bottom for these, like, high quality generative art. I'd say for the most part, like, pfps and other, like, you know, art, I would classify under, like, community. I think they'll take bigger hits because they're more volatile in nature, because they're more speculative in nature as it is. But I do think genitive art, like fidenzas, ringers and autoglyphs, will hold value over the long term.
00:54:46.532 - 00:54:47.340, Speaker A: Last question here.
00:54:47.372 - 00:54:47.580, Speaker C: Chow.
00:54:47.612 - 00:55:01.120, Speaker A: I'd toss this one to you. The lido has been on an absolute tear in terms of just the percentage of ETH that is staked in lido today, it's sitting at 32% a year from now. Is this above or below 50% of.
00:55:01.152 - 00:55:12.924, Speaker C: ETH staked in lido a year from now? Probably above five years from now? Probably much lower. Why is that? Because the market will demand more decentralization.
00:55:13.784 - 00:55:56.962, Speaker B: And just to touch on that is there's a company called Obel. I don't know if you're following them, but oval essentially allows any validator that hits a certain threshold to automatically delegate their excess of assets to other validators through something called secret keys. And so what this means is that over time, the community will ask for decentralization through validators. And oval is probably best in class in order for that to happen. And so take a look at oboe. They've been funded by Coinbase and us as alliance, Dow and many others, and they want to kind of help decentralize validators moving forward.
00:55:57.098 - 00:56:03.074, Speaker A: Ob I l or ob al? B o l o b o l. All right, cool. We'll put a link in the show notes.
00:56:03.114 - 00:56:03.698, Speaker B: Cool.
00:56:03.866 - 00:56:06.854, Speaker A: Awesome, guys. This has been great. Any last thoughts that you guys want to share?
00:56:07.954 - 00:56:10.034, Speaker C: Eat well, exercise, sleep.
00:56:10.114 - 00:56:10.402, Speaker B: Ciao.
00:56:10.418 - 00:56:17.784, Speaker A: I saw your nutrition levels, your vitals came back at record record highs. Or should I say record lows. I'm very happy for you.
00:56:17.904 - 00:56:18.608, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:56:18.736 - 00:56:23.364, Speaker B: By the way, what are you to track all of the vitals?
00:56:23.704 - 00:56:46.624, Speaker C: So I do a couple of things. I have a local doctor which is like, who practices functional medicine. So they order a bunch of tests for me. And the other thing I use is insight tracker. Not affiliated, I just use them. So combined, I attract probably like couple hundred biomarkers. But like the vast majority of them don't matter.
00:56:46.624 - 00:56:49.432, Speaker C: Like there's maybe only 1020 that actually matters.
00:56:49.608 - 00:56:53.204, Speaker B: I mean, I just use my Apple Watch and I feel like I need more than that.
00:56:53.744 - 00:56:55.704, Speaker A: I use inside tracker as well. I like it.
