00:00:00.440 - 00:00:34.114, Speaker A: Vanak analysts have predicted, I think, 2.4 billion combined in inflows into these spot bitcoin ETF's in the first quarter. Galaxy research has estimated 14 billion in the first year. Bitwise, as Matt Hogan has said, that their firm is kind of projecting 55 billion into all these funds in the next five years. So those are some different levels. Physical gold ETF's hold about 100 billion in assets under management. So people have said that they expect bitcoin could reach that.
00:00:34.814 - 00:01:06.232, Speaker B: What's up, everyone? Before we jump into the episode, little plug for digital asset Summit coming up in London, March 18 to 20th.

Later in the show, you will find out how you can use PyUSD to check out at millions of online stores. All right, everyone, we're back with the roundup. We have Santi and myself, and we are lucky enough to be joined by Casey, who's been on the show a couple of times. Senior reporter, blockworks. Another senior reporter, Blockworks. Ben Strak, who has been covering ETF's at blockworks since before ETF's were cool.
00:01:40.240 - 00:01:43.444, Speaker B: So, case, welcome back. Ben, welcome to the show for the first time.
00:01:44.064 - 00:01:47.352, Speaker A: Thank you. Great to be here. ETF's wearing cool at some point.
00:01:47.528 - 00:02:00.994, Speaker B: They've always been cool. They've always been cool. But maybe not to the general public. But, Ben, do you feel, is this a, is this a big moment for you? Do you feel vindicated to have been covering ETF's daily for years now? And now you're like, here, we've arrived.
00:02:01.494 - 00:02:08.742, Speaker A: Yeah, well, definitely to your point, they have not been talked about like this. It seems like in a long time, so very exciting time for the space.
00:02:08.878 - 00:02:25.194, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. So maybe, Ben, if you could set the stage for us. We're recording this on Thursday, so things are changing so quickly. This will go out Friday morning. We're recording this Thursday around noon. Can you just kind of set the stage for us? Like who? Like, how did we get here and who's arrived to the table.
00:02:26.234 - 00:03:24.978, Speaker A: Yeah, so, I mean, the Winklevoss twins first filed for a spot bitcoin ETF in 2013. That was denied a few years later. So there's been attempts for years to launch these. I think things picked up a little bit when SEC approved the first bitcoin futures ETF in 2021. And then from there, a few developments last year with Blackrock entering the race for a spot bitcoin ETF and then grayscale investments legal victory against the SEC for denying their conversion of GBTC, the Grayscale bitcoin trust, to an ETF. They won that case and that kind of set the stage a little bit for these approvals that we got yesterday. So now, Thursday morning, eleven bitcoin ETF's were set to launch, including from Blackrock Fidelity, as well as smaller crypto focused firms like Bitwise.
00:03:24.978 - 00:03:31.410, Speaker A: And Grayscale was able to convert their GBTC vehicle to an ETF as well. So a lot happening.
00:03:31.562 - 00:03:37.974, Speaker B: Why is it so we've had these futures ETF's, why is it so important that these are spot? Why was this the moment that everyone was waiting for?
00:03:39.114 - 00:04:02.154, Speaker A: Yeah, I think for a lot of people, spot ETF's are just easier to understand. They hold the bitcoin directly instead of bitcoin futures contracts, and there are some roll costs with bitcoin futures ETF's. So I think people were just waiting for this pure spot bitcoin fund to finally launch.
00:04:02.234 - 00:04:15.174, Speaker B: Preston case, can you maybe tee us up on the grayscale side? Ben mentioned grayscale or. I dont know if this is also a question for you, Ben, but why was this grayscale case so important and why did that pave the way for all of this to actually happen?
00:04:16.224 - 00:05:16.756, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean the phrase like regulation by enforcement gets thrown around a lot in crypto and also in policy when lawmakers are talking about different agencies and digital assets, specifically with the SEC. And this kind of shift into fighting things in the courts has really become a big narrative and a big weapon for the crypto industry. Obviously it's very expensive and time consuming, but as we saw today and this week, it certainly pays off. So Grayscale's big win was a judge ruled that the SEC is not allowed to deny a bitcoin ETF for transitioning their GBTC for the same reasons that they have in the past. So we knew that that was like kind of setting the stage, probably leaning toward an approval before we actually got it yesterday. But what we learned yesterday with these statements from commissioners is that the win in the courts really kind of set the stage and was really the. The motivating factor for the commission to vote yes on this.
00:05:16.756 - 00:05:39.636, Speaker C: Gary Gensler, in his statement, said that given the circumstances, and he mentioned this court case specifically, he said the only sustainable path forward was to approve the ETF. So I think that they knew that if they didn't approve it, they would have been dragged back to court. It would have been. It wouldn't have worked out in their favor. So this was really, like Gensler, in his own words, said, the only path forward.
00:05:39.700 - 00:05:57.244, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it read like, so he. Gensler posted this thing. He basically said, look, bitcoin remains this very volatile, speculative asset. And you could just see him writhing in pain through that message of, I really don't want to approve this. But.
00:05:59.024 - 00:06:24.888, Speaker C: He voted yes. He knew that this was the only way. He was backed into a corner. He was dragged kicking and screaming, I would say. But, yeah, I mean, his statement, it literally said bitcoin and crypto are used for money laundering and drug trafficking and terrorist fundraising, things that he said in the past. He's actually putting in the statement that go alongside his yes vote, which was interesting to see.
00:06:24.936 - 00:06:48.080, Speaker B: Yeah. All right, so let's jump to the juicy stuff, and then we can actually get into some of the details of this case. Where are we today? Or. Ben, I don't know. Who has the most up to date info. It's, again, noon on Thursday. So where, like, what are the flows looking like? What are the volumes looking like? Or maybe actually, if one of you wants to tee us up with this idea of, like, there's flows, there's volume, and there's Aum.
00:06:48.080 - 00:06:52.324, Speaker B: And how are those three things different? And then we can look at some of the actual numbers from today.
00:06:55.504 - 00:06:56.496, Speaker C: Ben, do you want to start?
00:06:56.600 - 00:06:56.864, Speaker D: Sure.
00:06:56.904 - 00:07:17.116, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, so Aum is the total assets in. In the fund, assets under management that. That is based off of flows that are coming in. So inflows and outflows going in and out. New money. But Aum takes into account flows.
00:07:17.116 - 00:07:33.294, Speaker A: It takes into account the seed capital, which was gathered beforehand to help the ETF launch and also takes into account the performance of the asset and how the price. When the price of bitcoin goes up. Aum in spot bitcoin, ETF's goes up as well.
00:07:33.594 - 00:07:41.642, Speaker C: Yes. Like, the aum dollar amount versus the actual amount of bitcoin would be different.
00:07:41.778 - 00:08:22.184, Speaker A: Yeah. So, yeah, so a lot to look at so far. We have a story up on Blockworks Co. Right now, with just the initial trading volumes in the first half hour, there were more than a billion in trading volumes so far. So a lot of shares trading hands in those funds with Blackrock, Fidelity and Grayscale seeing the most so far. And, yeah, that compares to the first. Bitcoin Futures ETF by proshares in 2021, had about a billion in trading volume for the first day.
00:08:22.184 - 00:08:27.000, Speaker A: So obviously, well, well past the pace there for these.
00:08:27.152 - 00:08:34.364, Speaker B: So the early winners here, it looks like. So we've got these eleven firms. The early winners are Blackrock, Fidelity, and Grayscale. Is that right?
00:08:35.504 - 00:08:41.480, Speaker C: Yes. I was joking with Ben. Eleven is far too many. I can't keep track of too many tabs.
00:08:41.552 - 00:08:49.044, Speaker B: This is a great chart right here. Okay. Grayscale. Okay, so anyone watching on YouTube, you can actually see it live right here. This is great, great data.
00:08:50.364 - 00:08:54.584, Speaker A: Yeah. And so that story was as of 10:00 a.m. And we will be updating throughout the day.
00:08:54.884 - 00:09:01.476, Speaker C: Yeah, I believe as of now, I think Blackrock might be in the lead and we have surpassed 2 billion in trading volumes.
00:09:01.540 - 00:09:19.822, Speaker B: Nice. Wow. Okay, so Ark is. So what I'm looking at is grayscale bitcoin trust is first iShares, which is Blackrock. Then you've got fidelity. Then you have Ark, 21 partnership, Cathie woods firm and 21 shares. And then coming up in fifth, we have bitwise.
00:09:19.822 - 00:09:29.314, Speaker B: Then you've got the Invesco Galaxy partnership, bitcoin ETF, then Valkyrie, then Franklin, then wisdom tree, then hash decks.
00:09:30.614 - 00:09:39.006, Speaker A: Yeah, and hash decks is a little bit of a different one. They converted their bitcoin futures ETF ticker defi to also hold bitcoin directly.
00:09:39.110 - 00:09:39.662, Speaker B: Nice.
00:09:39.798 - 00:09:51.766, Speaker C: And they, Ben, you might know more about this. Their spot holdings, they're tracking CMM, CME futures, bitcoin spot prices. Right. In this fund. It's a little bit different.
00:09:51.910 - 00:09:56.474, Speaker A: Yes, believe it's a little bit different. I would have to dig into the details there.
00:09:56.814 - 00:10:04.398, Speaker C: Yeah. So not only they've converted, and also the underlying assets, from what I understand, are not quite the same as some of the other products.
00:10:04.486 - 00:10:24.990, Speaker B: Nice. Okay, so what is. Let's talk about this. One of the most interesting dynamics, I think, which is like these fee wars that have emerged. So maybe you can walk us through what happened with the fees. I think a lot of folks were expecting maybe 50 bps, 60 bps. Fidelity came out at 39 bps, and this all out war ensued, I'd say.
00:10:24.990 - 00:10:27.954, Speaker B: So, Ben, what is the update on this fee battle?
00:10:28.774 - 00:11:02.454, Speaker A: Yeah, so because you have eleven funds launching at the same time, one of the differentiating factors is fees. So that's why there's been such a competition there. We saw fidelity, I think, came out one of the first ones with like 39 bits basis points. And we saw some other issuers undercut them at 25. Bit wise was the lowest at 20 basis points. And we just kind of saw issuers continue to lower them constantly.
00:11:02.494 - 00:11:04.230, Speaker C: Like some updated today.
00:11:04.422 - 00:11:05.014, Speaker A: Right.
00:11:05.134 - 00:11:09.634, Speaker B: Still updating even though. And once it's posted, you can still update it and bring it down.
00:11:10.374 - 00:11:11.494, Speaker A: You can change them after.
00:11:11.534 - 00:11:11.750, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:11:11.782 - 00:11:21.710, Speaker A: Valkyrie was at 80, for example. They went down to 49, and then they went down again to 25 this morning. So everyone's trying to stay competitive. Yeah.
00:11:21.902 - 00:11:33.434, Speaker C: And there's also some waivers, I believe Blackrock for the first twelve months or until 5 billion. It's a little bit lower. Some have zero fee for the first six months.
00:11:33.774 - 00:11:37.794, Speaker A: Right. Bitwise and Ark. I think there's some.
00:11:39.414 - 00:11:58.114, Speaker D: Ben and Casey, at what point will we know and understand the type of buyer and the concentration, like the cohort, like who's buying it, you know, the retention, like the average holding period. I know it's first day, but, you know, any big, like, institutions buying NDTF is mostly retail.
00:12:00.254 - 00:12:41.862, Speaker C: I would. So in the lead up to the bitcoin ETF approval and why people thought it was so important, a big part of that obviously was like being able to hold bitcoin and have exposure to this asset in something like a retirement account or that type of fund where you can't, like a registered investment advisor cannot like, make a coinbase account on your behalf and like buy bitcoin for you. So this product is like giving brokers an opportunity to, you know, on behalf of their clients get exposure to this asset. So I'm assuming, and Ben, I'm curious what you've heard as well. I think that the retail trader of crypto and the retail trader of this fund are not the same.
00:12:41.998 - 00:13:50.144, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think a lot of this initially is retail investors. We know that advisors, independent registered investment advisors, are very interested in these ETF's because we saw in a bitwise and verify survey a little while back that 80% of advisors were saying they were unable to buy crypto for clients or unsure whether they could, and that an ETF is a vehicle that they're very familiar with. So that would be a gateway into this space for them. Advisors have a little bit more ability to go into these quickly if they want to. Whereas some of the wire houses the larger full service brokerages like bank of America, Merrill, Lynch, Wells Fargo, they will have more of a due diligence process where they won't be jumping into these funds right away. There might be certain hurdles that these ETF's need to clear, whether it's certain levels of AUM or committees voting to allow them to enter those funds.
00:13:52.564 - 00:14:04.888, Speaker B: Why did. So everyone pulled fees down. What about Grayscale? What are your thoughts on grayscale strategy here in terms of keeping fees at? What do they keep it at? One, they brought it from two down to 1.51.51.
00:14:04.896 - 00:14:07.904, Speaker A: .5 yeah.
00:14:08.024 - 00:14:09.524, Speaker B: What's the strategy here?
00:14:10.464 - 00:14:11.724, Speaker C: Well, the highest.
00:14:13.344 - 00:14:45.864, Speaker A: Yeah, well they. I mean they obviously, they get a lot of revenue from. From the fees on those assets in GBTC. There were about 28 billion in assets under management in that fund. That trust launched in 2013. Grayscale disallowed redemptions in that trust years ago. So investors would have to trade those shares on the secondary market and those were trading at a discount for the last couple years.
00:14:45.864 - 00:15:09.964, Speaker A: So some investors were kind of trapped in that vehicle. The ETF changes that, essentially bringing the. Eliminating the discount. So, yeah, so I think some people we've spoken to expect large outflows from GBTC now that it's an ETF to kind of go into some of those lower cost funds.
00:15:10.624 - 00:15:19.644, Speaker C: I'm also curious if we might see Grayscale launch another bitcoin ETF product at a lower fee that's not under the GBT ticker.
00:15:19.684 - 00:15:22.900, Speaker B: Say more about that case. Wouldn't that cannibalize their existing.
00:15:23.092 - 00:16:07.464, Speaker C: Well, I think so. With. And this is something that also kind of goes back to the approval process and what we saw and learned, I guess, from the SEC yesterday. These ETF's are all cash redemption. And most issuers, Ark investo Galaxy tried to do a in kind redemption process, but they, we assume, were told by the SEC that that wasn't gonna work. So I've talked to a lot of analysts and also people, I don't wanna say people close to the matter. I know people get upset when I say that, but talk to people that know a lot more than I do and they seem pretty confident that we're gonna see a lot of issuers file for bitcoin ETF's that use in kind redemption.
00:16:07.464 - 00:16:10.600, Speaker C: So I'm curious if grayscale might try to take that route, in which case.
00:16:10.632 - 00:17:06.284, Speaker D: Maybe we would see, maybe double click on that GBTC investor. You've been it for years, maybe you did in a tax advantage account like an IRA, Roth IRA, if it's cash settled for you to pull out of that vehicle, it has a tax implication. Well, if you bought it, maybe not in this, in this tax advantage accounts, but like in a regular account, to keep the matter simple, if you were to pull out of that, you have a taxable impact and if you want. So if you wanted to save on fees, you would have to do the math around I'm going to pay taxes on this and so it's probably not worth it to pull out. And so if they launch a new product, it's really to capture the new inflows that are obviously not going to pay 1%. But I'm just curious how you think about the retention of the pool of capital of GBTC and how that rotation might kind of happen.
00:17:09.404 - 00:17:49.710, Speaker C: Yeah, no, that's a good point. I think with the in kind versus cash redemptions, I think the issuers are definitely. I mean, it's tax advantageous for them to use in kind. So with in kind redemptions, we see the issuer exchanges, the funds underlying assets. So in this case, bitcoin. With a market maker in a cash redemption, they are actually like using cash to like buy the underlying asset, to buy the bitcoin, which creates a taxable event. But yeah, I mean, like Ben said, with this transition, it's giving GBTC holders an opportunity to pull out and pull into something else for the first time.
00:17:49.710 - 00:18:12.956, Speaker C: So I am. It's day one, so I'm really curious to see what we'll see. Also with like the futures product we saw initially bitto, which was Proshare's bitcoin futures ETF, it was the first one to launch, like Ben said, in 2021. That did amazing so far this week and last week, and now we're seeing that back off. So there's a lot of different trends here. It's hard to know exactly what everyone's.
00:18:12.980 - 00:18:25.892, Speaker A: Thinking and just about GBTC. Grayscale is kind of positioning this as they are the fund with the most liquidity, the tightest spreads, the decade long track record.
00:18:25.948 - 00:18:29.544, Speaker C: So that's how they're really leaning into that 2013. Yeah.
00:18:31.294 - 00:18:58.268, Speaker A: But yeah, and to the point too, of potentially them launching another fund we've seen in the past, GLD, the largest physical gold ETF by State street. They launched a cheaper gold product. So even if that product would kind of cannibalize their own fund, they'd rather do that potentially than those flows go into other issues.
00:18:58.316 - 00:19:12.588, Speaker B: Yeah, that's interesting. It's probably actually a smart strategy by them. Let's say you lose 50% of the. Let's say even you lose 50% of the Aum, but if you don't drop your fees by more than 50%, you're technically making money there. So that makes sense.
00:19:12.716 - 00:19:18.624, Speaker A: And a shout out to James Safer at Bloomberg Intelligence, who kind of has circulated that theory more recently.
00:19:19.564 - 00:19:41.514, Speaker B: Yeah, nice. What are the broad, we're talking very hourly and daily. What are the broad flow and asset and AuM predictions for this year? What is consensus on the street? What's consensus? Maybe the more crypto native, I'm assuming more optimistic consensus. What are people thinking right now?
00:19:42.734 - 00:19:47.198, Speaker C: I have heard estimates for initial inflows from 1 billion to 5 billion.
00:19:47.326 - 00:19:52.874, Speaker B: So massive range day for the. What, like, what's the time?
00:19:52.954 - 00:20:18.066, Speaker C: We'll say, like, first week. I think some people are saying a day, but I'll try to. I'll say week. I don't think that's possible. But, yeah, I mean, I. And this kind of goes back to the question of, like, is it priced in or not? And I think in the short term, we saw yesterday and we're seeing today that maybe the initial news of approval and, like, first trading day was priced in. We haven't seen like a ton of bitcoin moves, honestly.
00:20:18.066 - 00:20:41.944, Speaker C: Ethereum's moving way more. But last night, as we're seeing these approvals come in from the SEC, bitcoin's like barely moving at all. So I think in the short term, a lot of that was priced in. When you look long term, though, I mean, we don't really know what's going to happen. An inflow of a billion versus 5 billion in the first month is a huge difference. So, like, of course bitcoin is going to trade differently based on that.
00:20:42.324 - 00:21:22.914, Speaker A: Yeah, we have a few Vanac analysts have predicted, I think, 2.4 billion combined in, in, inflows into these spot bitcoin ETF's in the first quarter. Galaxy research has estimated 14 billion in the first year. And bitwise, as Matt Hogan has said, that their firm is kind of projecting 55 billion into all these funds in the next five years. So those are some different levels. Physical gold ETF's hold about 100 billion in assets under management. So people have said that they expect bitcoin could reach that.
00:21:24.414 - 00:21:40.194, Speaker B: How do you think. This might be a really dumb question. How do you think about the impact of flows impacting the direct price of bitcoin? If there's 100 billion of flows into bitcoin, how does that impact bitcoins actual price?
00:21:42.394 - 00:21:45.506, Speaker C: You mean like, because the fund is.
00:21:45.530 - 00:21:46.882, Speaker B: Buying the bitcoin fund buying the bitcoin?
00:21:46.938 - 00:22:09.522, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, I mean it's, it's good. I mean, I talked to a lot of analysts that were like, there's really no downside here. Like, it's cash is infinite and like, there's interest in this product. But like I said, I mean, depending on these different predictions, which there's a massive range and we don't know what's going to happen. That's kind of where it gets a little bit more dicey. Um, so, yeah, I mean, I would say again, I think short term it's very priced. In long term, I'm doubtful.
00:22:09.578 - 00:22:14.658, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm thinking about like some of.
00:22:14.666 - 00:22:51.940, Speaker D: The math and this goes back to our 2024 predictions. It's like you need to think about how much bitcoin is actually available because a lot of it might be in the hands of people that don't want to sell, might be lost wallets. You know, there's different estimates of how much is circulating versus, well, you need to make the distinction around. And this actually becomes more relevant for a proof of stake system. Like if when we have an ethereum ETF, which by the way, you know, then now there's, the focus is on that. Like, Blackrock already filed. I mean, there's like, people are speculating that it might be as early as August, but like simplistically total supply is not as relevant as circulating supply.
00:22:51.940 - 00:23:30.444, Speaker D: And like, what is actually available to be traded in the order books, because you might have, you know, in a worst scenario, there's like no liquidity. Right. No one wants to sell. So if you have all those inflows, like just the price goes to infinity, I guess. So that's the thing to really monitor how much of bitcoins actually people look at order books to make this kind of assessments of like for an incremental billion, 10 billion of flows, how much is actually in the order book at any given time. And it's kind of hard to piece it because sometimes it's just like shadow. Not all of it is like it's an iceberg.
00:23:30.444 - 00:23:37.054, Speaker D: So like it's sort of a bit of a difficult exercise to do perfectly, but you can get a good estimate.
00:23:37.474 - 00:24:09.354, Speaker A: Yeah. Galaxy Digital research associate Charles Yu had a report in October that kind of looked at the price of gold and how that reacted after Gold ETF's launched in 2004. Basically finding gold has increased by four times. The price has increased by four times since then. I think he projected a 74% increase for bitcoin in the first year of spot bitcoin ETF's trading. So that was an interesting report to check out potentially.
00:24:10.814 - 00:24:26.334, Speaker B: What's up, everyone? Quick break from the show to talk about digital asset summit. This is going to be blockworks 8th Das. We've been hosting this since 2019.

00:26:04.274 - 00:26:25.374, Speaker B: What about the ETH ETF? It feels like the, I mean, our industry is the attention span of a goldfish. So we celebrate for a day or two the bitcoin ETF, and then all eyes go on the Ethereum ETF. What is the kind of target deadline for the ETF's also, is it the same issuers? Different issuers. What's this looking like?
00:26:26.434 - 00:27:18.326, Speaker A: Yeah, so we saw Ark invest and 21 shares, they filed for a spot ether ETF in September. Believe Vaneck did the same. And we've seen others, Invesco and Blackrock even come in a little bit later with that. So that September filing will go through the same sort of 19 before process that these spot bitcoin ETF's went through, which is essentially a 240 day process if they take the full time. So I think there will be some sort of ruling by next May around then. But I think a lot of discussion will need to happen before we see those. I saw to the point earlier, Casey mentioned Gary Gensler's statement with approving these funds.
00:27:18.326 - 00:27:30.662, Speaker A: He mentioned that this ruling does not signal anything about the commission's views to the status of other crypto assets. So there will be work to do on getting those approved for those issuers.
00:27:30.838 - 00:28:00.264, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, there were two years between approving bitcoin futures ETF's and Ethereum futures ETF's. So, like, if that's any indication, it's not. Ether is trading like an ethanol ETF is going to be approved tomorrow. But I'm pretty skeptical, like Ben said, really? Based on Gensler's language that we'll see this happen quickly. I think that, again, based on what we've seen, it will happen eventually, but I'm not holding my breath.
00:28:00.724 - 00:28:18.136, Speaker A: And the difference between bitcoin and ether compared to the other assets is they do have futures markets regulated by the CFTC right now. And like Casey mentioned, the first ether futures ETF's launched a few months ago in October, so.
00:28:18.280 - 00:28:21.008, Speaker B: Nice. Yeah, I saw some folks talking about a ripple ETF.
00:28:21.136 - 00:28:21.804, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:28:22.984 - 00:28:31.896, Speaker B: My understanding is that is a far fetched product. Just because there's no robust futures market other than bitcoin and ETH.
00:28:31.960 - 00:28:44.214, Speaker C: Yeah, and like Ben said, I mean, just because the SEC rules that ripple's not a security doesn't mean anything in terms of ETF approval. Like, it's all about the security of the market and there's a lot to be done.
00:28:44.334 - 00:28:46.518, Speaker B: Yeah. What else is interesting here, guys?
00:28:46.606 - 00:28:47.914, Speaker C: Do I talk about Coinbase?
00:28:48.214 - 00:28:50.994, Speaker B: Let's talk about Coinbase. What should we talk about? Coinbase, case?
00:28:52.014 - 00:28:57.254, Speaker C: Ben probably knows more than I do. They're the custodian for nine of the eleven, I think.
00:28:57.294 - 00:28:58.834, Speaker A: Nine, yeah, that sounds right.
00:28:59.334 - 00:29:04.454, Speaker C: Their stock is down a lot today, which is, I thought was interesting, which makes sense.
00:29:05.514 - 00:29:07.074, Speaker D: Was that 145 now?
00:29:07.194 - 00:29:07.586, Speaker B: Ish?
00:29:07.650 - 00:29:51.166, Speaker C: Okay, we'll see. Yes. Some analysts were predicting that, obviously, with them being raking a lot of these custody fees, but I was seeing estimates from, like 25 million to 30 million in annual fees, which obviously isn't a ton of. And then, of course, there's the thought that if you can buy an ETF, why would you make a Coinbase account to purchase bitcoin? Again, I think that those two categories of investors are different, but it is something to think about. I mean, I know that my parents, for example, would rather buy this ETF than get on an exchange, even though I've told them.
00:29:51.230 - 00:30:13.614, Speaker B: And do you know the economics here? So let's say. Okay, so I'm looking at our, the blockworks ETF tracker. You've got grayscale bitwise. Basically everyone except for Vaneck and Fidelity uses Coinbase to custody their bitcoin. What is the split there? So let's say bitwise here, their fees are going to be 20%. What percentage of that goes to Coinbase and what goes to bitwise, do you know?
00:30:14.194 - 00:30:20.014, Speaker C: I do not know, Ben. I'm not sure if you have any updated numbers.
00:30:22.274 - 00:30:23.794, Speaker A: I'm not sure what the breakdown is.
00:30:23.834 - 00:30:27.858, Speaker C: I don't. This isn't something. Is this something that they have to disclose? I can pull this up in, Edgar.
00:30:27.906 - 00:30:33.722, Speaker B: It's probably actually in the Coinbase annual filings. That'd be an interesting.
00:30:33.898 - 00:30:41.914, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, that's something to watch, I guess, for their Q 120 24 earnings report, because we'll have this data.
00:30:42.074 - 00:30:43.346, Speaker B: Yeah, that's interesting.
00:30:43.530 - 00:30:56.752, Speaker C: So, yeah, that's definitely something to watch. I was, again, I was surprised that coin itself, the stock was trading so low today. It didn't really move that much last night on the approval and aftermarket trading, but not doing so hot today.
00:30:56.808 - 00:31:16.684, Speaker B: You would have thought it would move in one way or the other, either positively because it's a big, big step forward for the industry, or negatively because. Yeah, like you said, maybe people aren't buying bitcoin on Coinbase anymore. In terms of maybe case, I'd throw it back to you in terms of ETF's, in context of the broader SEC war against crypto, what are you hearing on the ground?
00:31:18.944 - 00:31:26.488, Speaker C: Well, I would say so. Do you mean, like, in terms of approval, what does this mean for the sec going forward? Or like.
00:31:26.576 - 00:31:41.086, Speaker B: Yeah, like, you know, the SEC was coming after folks like Coinbase pretty hard, was coming after Kraken pretty hard. I don't know if what you're hearing in terms of, like, are these coming after some of the DeFi protocols pretty hard. Like, is this still going to continue. Last more. Okay, continue.
00:31:41.150 - 00:32:39.194, Speaker C: I think that, like I said, this regulation by enforcement has really encouraged this litigation process and fighting it out in the courts versus settlements, which is really important for the industry because a court ruling helps set a precedent exactly like we saw with this bitcoin ETF. When we see all these settlements with the SEC, it's difficult because it doesn't really create any precedent for any other actor in the space. It doesn't help to change any rules or to provide clarity to the industry. That being said, I mean, it's really, really expensive. We saw it with ripple, we saw it with Grayscale. We're currently seeing it with Coinbase, Kraken. I mean, it takes a lot of resources to go up after the SEC and fight these matters out in court, but it's what we've seen so far, really the most effective path forward in terms of getting, I would say, like, more concrete change.
00:32:39.194 - 00:33:24.650, Speaker C: The other side of that, with the drama that we saw this week surrounding the approval announcement, I'll say. So we had the SEC's official Twitter x account, whatever you want to call it, compromised. There was a false tweet that they put out that said that the ETF was approved. That happened on Tuesday night. We obviously saw bitcoin's price fluctuate a lot after that. It took about 15 minutes for the SEC to correct the narrative and state that the ETF's had not actually been approved. Immediately after this, we saw a lot of feedback from lawmakers, mostly Republicans, criticizing the SEC, saying that this obviously was incredibly irresponsible.
00:33:24.650 - 00:33:57.964, Speaker C: It impacted markets, and it's unacceptable for a government agency to not have better security around these accounts. So that happened on Tuesday. A lot of lawmakers were very fired up. And then on Wednesday, we had another fun little incident with the SEC where the approval document was posted, I believe, at like 03:45 p.m. It was just before four, which everyone found very surprising. The SEC tends to keep these announcements until after the market closed. But it came up.
00:33:57.964 - 00:34:03.964, Speaker C: And then I think, Ben, you can correct me. I think it was up for maybe five to ten minutes before the post came down.
00:34:04.264 - 00:34:05.656, Speaker A: Maybe even less than that, but, yeah.
00:34:05.680 - 00:34:06.736, Speaker C: Maybe even less than that.
00:34:06.840 - 00:34:09.864, Speaker A: We were frantically reading it and then it disappeared.
00:34:09.944 - 00:34:51.994, Speaker C: It did. So then, obviously, you know, coming right on the heels of this compromised Twitter account, everyone is wondering, was the SEC hacked? Is this true? Why is the page gone? The SEC's office is not responding to anyone. We were frantically calling their press office. No one's saying anything. It took half an hour to then get the actual real news that was posted. So none of this is looking good for a lot of these lawmakers that have long criticized the SEC's enforcement practices. It's not winning them any favors in Washington right now, I would say, particularly on the right.
00:34:51.994 - 00:35:05.397, Speaker C: I was hearing some speculation from Democrats that the, the Twitter situation was not actually the SEC's fault, but it was a problem of X's security. X obviously came forward and said that that wasn't.
00:35:05.445 - 00:35:06.373, Speaker B: I don't know about that one.
00:35:06.413 - 00:35:15.725, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. I was talking to someone that said they just hate Elon Musk so much, and this was just a perfect opportunity to blame Twitter.
00:35:15.869 - 00:35:17.685, Speaker B: Good political opportunity, of course, yeah.
00:35:17.709 - 00:35:43.610, Speaker C: I mean, everything's going to get a spin on it, and obviously we have to take it all with a grain of salt. But I am curious to see, I mean, we saw there was a congressional hearing for Taylor Swift ticket sales. Like we're going to see a congressional hearing over this SEC situation, I have no doubt about it. So I'm curious to see how that impacts some of the bills that we're currently seeing that are targeting the SEC and something to watch.
00:35:43.722 - 00:35:50.374, Speaker B: Nice. Well, Ben case, this has been great. Anything else that we should talk about that we have not and that we're missing?
00:35:51.834 - 00:35:53.694, Speaker C: Have you bought? Has anyone bought.
00:35:55.154 - 00:36:11.130, Speaker B: I actually want to try to buy. I saw on Twitter that folks who are trying to buy through, you know, Vanguard and JPMorgan and stuff are getting like big warning symbols. It's like, you know, approve three different times, click this checkbox, like, are you sure you want to buy? So.
00:36:11.322 - 00:36:13.014, Speaker D: Six confirmation, sir.
00:36:13.674 - 00:36:18.550, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. So I'm going to, I'm going to try to buy through our JPMorgan account today and see, see what happens.
00:36:18.622 - 00:36:21.558, Speaker D: I did some, did a little bit of trading this morning.
00:36:21.686 - 00:36:23.914, Speaker B: Yeah, what'd you buy? Which one?
00:36:24.854 - 00:36:28.034, Speaker D: A mix and, and some coin based stuff.
00:36:29.894 - 00:36:31.150, Speaker A: I'm on the sidelines for now.
00:36:31.182 - 00:36:35.034, Speaker B: Every day I talk to Santi. Santi, how you doing? Just got some more coinbase stock.
00:36:36.854 - 00:36:38.554, Speaker C: Well, today, buy the dip.
00:36:39.894 - 00:36:42.814, Speaker D: I mean, the other thing that's interesting we talk about is a circle IPO.
00:36:42.934 - 00:37:45.436, Speaker B: So basically, um, circle is looking to go public. So we actually reported this maybe six to twelve months ago that they were looking to go public, but it had been kind of put on hold a little bit or it's been slowed down. The company just announced that it filed the draft registration statement for its IPO, and they said that the IPO is expected to take place after the SEC completes its review process. Which is subject to market and other conditions. And this is a really big deal. I would say it's maybe not as big of a deal as the bitcoin ETF, but it's still a colossal deal that I think will probably be swept under the rug just because everyone's so focused on the ETF. But if you look at the state of capital markets in crypto today, the only ways for people to actually access bitcoin, if you're an institution or crypto if you're an institutional investor, it's now the bitcoin ETF, it's Coinbase stock, and it's publicly traded bitcoin miners, which are essentially just beta on bitcoin circle.
00:37:45.436 - 00:38:13.346, Speaker B: Ipoing basically gives folks access to broader crypto businesses. And even more importantly, there are about six to ten companies that are waiting to see how circles IPO is received, and if it's received successfully, I think a lot of other companies are going to push to IPO, which just having several publicly traded crypto companies, other than just Coinbase and the miners, I think it's a huge unlock for an industry.
00:38:13.490 - 00:38:15.130, Speaker D: So you wonder what.
00:38:15.162 - 00:38:16.254, Speaker A: And microstrategy.
00:38:17.474 - 00:38:36.834, Speaker B: And microstrategy, of course, yeah. There's also Galaxy, which trades in Canada, but it's a big development having. It's just a sign of a maturing industry. The obvious other one is Kraken. Probably follow suit in 2024. And then there's another cohort that I would say is one level below Kraken.
00:38:37.374 - 00:38:39.182, Speaker D: Who probably looks fire blocks.
00:38:39.278 - 00:38:55.750, Speaker B: Yeah. Who probably looks to 2025. This would be, you know, chainalysis, Anchorage fire blocks, maybe consensus blockworks. Yeah, exactly. Alchemy, Bitgo, Gemini, etoro. You could probably bucket in there. Ripple, I've heard, has talked about it a little bit internally.
00:38:55.750 - 00:39:07.074, Speaker B: So there's the whole swath of companies that are now looking at circle to say, how successful are they going to be? How's the market going to receive this? And if it's received well, look, we'll start to file as well.
00:39:08.934 - 00:39:18.310, Speaker A: Preston, does anyone have a favorite bitcoin commercial they've seen on x or. We saw bitwise kind of come out swinging with the most interesting man in the world.
00:39:18.502 - 00:39:34.592, Speaker B: I mean, Matt. So, Matt. I'm biased. Matt Hogan's an advisor to blockworks and has been very helpful through the years, through the ups and the downs. And. And so I'm always biased towards bitwise commercials, especially when they feature Matt Hogan. So I like that one.
00:39:34.592 - 00:39:49.800, Speaker B: I didn't really like the hash decks one. I thought that was kind of half assed. I've been loving everything that comes out of van Neck. I think Vanek's been doing a really good job for the industry since. For a long time, for six years now. And they've had some good stuff. But it's cool.
00:39:49.800 - 00:40:00.304, Speaker B: I mean, NFL playoffs are coming up. It's going to be interesting to see how many commercials are, you know, you're watching the playoffs. Like, how many bitcoin ETF commercials are there going to be?
00:40:01.284 - 00:40:11.984, Speaker D: We can all finally take a backseat and let Wall street do the sales and marketing for the industry. And that's a huge machine. Sales, marketing department grew orders magnitude.
00:40:12.324 - 00:40:23.644, Speaker B: And I have a question, actually, for this. So I'm looking at our story spot. Bitcoin ETF's estimated volume. You've got grayscale, Blackrock, and Fidelity, then arc 21 shares. Then bit wise. Where. Where's Van Eck? Here.
00:40:25.944 - 00:40:35.824, Speaker A: They were pretty significantly lower. I think Ark was behind the top three and fourth, and then the rest were pretty significant.
00:40:35.904 - 00:40:38.768, Speaker B: Vanek get delayed, or they got approved, too? They're good to go.
00:40:38.816 - 00:40:44.144, Speaker C: They were approved. I will say not every single fund started trading exactly at 930.
00:40:44.224 - 00:40:44.632, Speaker B: Okay.
00:40:44.688 - 00:40:54.780, Speaker C: Okay. Take that with a grain of salt, especially with. So this story that you're looking at, Jason, was published at, like, ten something. So some had, like, truly been trading for half an hour, and some hadn't.
00:40:54.852 - 00:40:55.624, Speaker B: Gotcha.
00:40:56.164 - 00:41:01.104, Speaker C: But, yeah, I was a little bit surprised. Their ticker is also Hodl, so I was curious.
00:41:02.284 - 00:41:17.204, Speaker B: Nice. Awesome. Okay, spen, thanks for everything. Incredible coverage of this bitcoin ETF. Excited to see it develop and start to move into ETH ETF conversations starting in Q two. And, yeah, good work on everything.
00:41:17.704 - 00:41:18.416, Speaker C: Thank you, guys.
00:41:18.480 - 00:41:20.124, Speaker A: Thanks. Thanks, guys.
00:41:21.904 - 00:41:45.340, Speaker B: Everyone, thank you so much for watching today's episode. Really hope you enjoyed it.
