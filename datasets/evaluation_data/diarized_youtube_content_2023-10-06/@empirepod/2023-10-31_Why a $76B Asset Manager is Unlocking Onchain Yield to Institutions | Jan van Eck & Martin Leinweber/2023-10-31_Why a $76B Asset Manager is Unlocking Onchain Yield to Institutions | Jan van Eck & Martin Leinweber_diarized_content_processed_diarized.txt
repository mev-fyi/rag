00:00:00.200 - 00:00:41.090, Speaker A: This episode is brought to you by Toku. If you are planning to launch a token, already have a live token, are granting employees or contractors vesting token awards, or are just trying to figure out how to take care of taxable token events for your team. From easy to use token grant award templates, through tracking vesting to managing tax withholdings, make it simple today with Toku. All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Empire. Very special up today, we have Jan Vanek, CEO of Vanek Funds, and Martin Lineweiber. I have a horrible german accent, so I'm sure I botched that. But digital asset product strategist at Market vector Indexes, which Vanek owns.
00:00:41.090 - 00:00:43.574, Speaker A: So, Martin, Jan, welcome to the show.
00:00:44.674 - 00:00:47.506, Speaker B: Great to be here. Thanks, Jason. Great to finally talk.
00:00:47.650 - 00:00:48.546, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks.
00:00:48.610 - 00:00:49.594, Speaker C: Thanks for having me.
00:00:49.714 - 00:01:02.864, Speaker A: So, Jan, I have to ask, are the rumors true? So our producer said that he was listening to a podcast episode with Howard Lindsay, and actually, and you mentioned that Empire is your favorite crypto podcast. We got to get it out of the way. Is that a true statement?
00:01:03.404 - 00:01:23.972, Speaker B: It's my most favorite. Listen. Absolutely. I'm a tradfi guy. Let's get that on the table right away. And I think, Martin, you're a listener, too. I had a lot to learn on the tech side, and after a couple of Patrick O'Shaughnessy pods in 2017.
00:01:23.972 - 00:01:27.754, Speaker B: Yeah, I tried to understand most of what you guys talk about.
00:01:27.884 - 00:01:43.554, Speaker A: It's funny, I feel like the Patrick three part series, I think he called it hash power or hash series. I forget what it was, but I remember that series in 2017, my co founder and I would just play the podcast. We would listen to, like, three minutes, be like, did you understand that? Nope, didn't get that. All right, Google something.
00:01:44.214 - 00:01:45.638, Speaker B: But I feel like a lot of.
00:01:45.646 - 00:02:17.754, Speaker A: People got pulled into the industry that way. So yon, I want to start actually with macro. Before getting into crypto, I've actually heard you describe Vaneck not as an ETF provider or ETF firm, but as a macro firm at a whole. I'd be curious, what do you think is the, when you think about just the macro landscape right now, we've got this, like, yield curve that's flipped upside down. You've got, I feel like the debt crisis is what everyone's talking about right now. We had commercial banks collapsing six months ago. What are you paying attention to right now in macro? What do you think is the most important thing in macro right now?
00:02:17.874 - 00:03:05.720, Speaker B: Sure. Let me talk about what I mean by Macro. And what I mean is that there's a lot of people who build their whole career around looking within the Bloomberg, like all the dynamics within the financial markets, and we say, hey, wait a minute, before you do that, take a step back. What's happening in the world from a political, economic and technology perspective, because some of those trends are going to be very important and very investable. So the way trad five people think about their portfolios and asset classes very simply take the rise of China, right? Deng Xiaoping moves as a country towards open markets. There is no asset class called emerging markets, but there is this clear political move in one of the world's biggest countries. And I traveled there in 92.
00:03:05.720 - 00:03:52.208, Speaker B: I said, this is going to be one of the biggest moves in my career. And so that has investment implications. So our point at Vaneck is look at what's happening in the world. Let's have a dialogue with our clients. We don't know all the answers, but let's have a dialogue and say, hey, listen, likely to be sustainable in terms of trends, what's likely to impact the financial markets and your portfolio from either a risk or return perspective? So, all right, to answer your question, the Fed is, and interest rates are the biggest driver of financial markets, no doubt, right? And so the Fed has said there's one time where you really don't want to be invested in stocks and bonds as a tri fi person. And that's when the Fed is raising rates. And the Fed said, hey, we're going to raise rates aggressively.
00:03:52.208 - 00:04:30.304, Speaker B: They're clearly 90% done with the raising rates part. The second part, which doesn't get enough airtime in my mind, is what they're doing with their balance sheet. It's the quantitative easing moving to quantitative tightening. And if you listen to that narrative, what that means is there's no, to oversimplify, no government coming to the table in the bond market anymore. So since the financial crisis, every day I kind of exaggerate. But either foreign central banks or the US central bank was bidding up a lot of the bonds. And it wasn't just us treasuries, right? It was mortgage backs.
00:04:30.304 - 00:05:24.154, Speaker B: The swiss central bank bought all kinds of different investments in their balance sheet. So if that game is over, then who is setting the prices of interest rates in the United States? Was the private investor. And if that's the case, then to me it's very clear that ten year rates should be higher than one month or three months short term interest rates. Why? Because the risk of interest price movement out, the further out is dramatic. So more risk, more return, and so I think if you go say the Fed is 90% done with raising rates at the short end, eventually we're going, and shortly I think we're going to have an inverted yield curve. I started saying this a week ago, and now we're almost there, it feels like, and we don't know the path that we're going to get there. Jason, I think that's an important question to ask.
00:05:24.154 - 00:05:54.358, Speaker B: Does the ten year go to 6.5% and then the whole curve shifts? That I don't really know. But yeah, this chart is the best indicator. What it does goes back to the 1980s. And what you can see in green is that's when the ten year interest rates are higher than normalized yield curve, higher than the three month. Right. So this period where long term interest rates are lower in red is very rare and it doesn't persist.
00:05:54.358 - 00:06:06.116, Speaker B: And so it's all down to people's psychology of do they think the fed's going to come back and intervene in the bond markets or not? I'm betting not. And so I bet on a normalized yield curve.
00:06:06.230 - 00:06:06.576, Speaker C: Hmm.
00:06:06.640 - 00:06:16.404, Speaker A: Okay, so we have this inverted bond market right now, which doesn't really make sense, right. Less yield for more risk. How do you get out of that if you're the Fed?
00:06:17.704 - 00:07:20.926, Speaker B: Well, if you just keep doing quantitative tightening and stop interfering in the market, it will happen. What's funny is when you debate with people is when you have regime changes like this, right? Because this has been something that's been around since the financial crisis. And frankly, a lot of people in our, in the investment industry haven't, you know, really kind of experienced a sort of combination of inflation and the fed fighting inflation, which happened in the seventies. It just takes a long time for these changes to kind of get into people's psychology. But if quantitative tightening continues and the Fed really doesn't come back, the market will normalize the yield curve. That's just normal behavior. I think the question, the tough call is, okay, so what, Jan, what does that mean for my portfolio? And I think one thing that, to jump to the crypto is I do think that the hedges against higher interest rates are bad for gold.
00:07:20.926 - 00:07:50.620, Speaker B: That's for sure a well established narrative. If bitcoin is the modern gold, then I think high rates are bad for bitcoin. And that would explain the bear market that we've seen. I don't think bitcoin matches gold one for one. I call it like an eight year old, like an underdeveloped asset. But I do think that this is the time, if you believe that you want to be positioned for an eventual change in fed policy, you have no idea when the market's going to price it in. Do your buying.
00:07:50.620 - 00:07:53.212, Speaker B: Now, when you talk about a regime.
00:07:53.268 - 00:08:22.054, Speaker A: Change, there's two things that come into my mind. There's what I like, a short term regime change with a presidential election next year. But then there's the, like the, this colossal regime change around the dollar. And I think the big conversation right now at dinner tables with, if you meet with portfolio managers, which I know you do a lot of, is the budget deficit. I'd be curious how you think about the concern of the budget deficit and really maybe the timeline of the concern there.
00:08:22.594 - 00:08:53.138, Speaker B: Yeah, listen, the hardest thing in financial markets is timing. So that's why if you can do your portfolio construction with a big time budget, that's super helpful. So, you know, many people have, have gotten caught up in predicting the decline of japanese yen or whatever based on these kinds of budget analyses. So these charts here are just straightforward. They're not even anyone else's guess. It's the CBO. So this is what the government is saying.
00:08:53.138 - 00:09:42.812, Speaker B: And it just shows, given our mix of fiscal policies, that interest costs, even at basically current levels, as you can see on the right, are going to become a crazy amount of government spending. Now this is a very static view of the world. I'm probably in the more half a glass, half full camp where there's a lot of policy changes, whether it's raising the retirement age or reducing the amount of benefits they're spending, all that kind of stuff. It would have to be bipartisan. So I'm not saying this is baked in the cake, but the timing is very difficult. And if you could go to the next slide, a lot of life is kind of in the financial markets. There's so many thousands of charts and data points.
00:09:42.812 - 00:10:34.504, Speaker B: It's like, what's the one that speaks to you? Because it could very well be, Jason, that we live another 20 or 30 years and the dollar doesn't collapse and interest rates don't skyrocket because of US's fiscal position. But here's my favorite sort of data point, which is it's a little complicated, but it's basically the chances that the market thinks that the government, us government's going to default on its debt. So these are effectively the market saying, I'm worried about, to me, the US federal budget deficit you can see early in the chart goes back to 2008. There were a lot of concerns about solvency of the US government. Then it went away. It spiked earlier this year during the March shutdown discussions. And it's an elevated level.
00:10:34.504 - 00:11:11.312, Speaker B: But stepping back, these are not high levels to me. If you look at what Deutsche bank was during the financial crisis and all the chances much higher, I think it feels like most macro strategists are bears. A lot of them are my age, and they like to stress the negative and inevitability of all these crises. And maybe some bitcoin maxis do, too. But this is kind of. Nah, maybe not so much like, yeah, it's a problem, but maybe we can work our way through it. So that's kind of what I look at.
00:11:11.312 - 00:11:14.248, Speaker B: Let's not get ahead of ourselves on the doomsday scenario.
00:11:14.376 - 00:11:44.784, Speaker A: Yeah. Though if you go back to this slide like this, the net interest cost is a percentage of revenue, is, I don't know, it does kind of make you think, like, if you extend this out far enough, there's kind of three ways to fix this problem. Like, what we're looking at is a problem, and there's three ways to maybe address the problem. There's, you can inflate away the debt costs, you can build your way out of it with maybe AI and or crypto as the catalyst, or you could forgive the debt. Is that. Does that feel like a fair assessment of this?
00:11:45.284 - 00:12:15.274, Speaker B: Well, I would just forgive and say, tweak your promises, and some of those are intergenerational concerns. So. Okay. Old people like me been working in the market. I'm not going to change your retirement age, but youngsters like you, yeah, maybe you have to work till you're 90 or something. So something that's more demographically appropriate. So, yeah, I don't think it has to be.
00:12:15.274 - 00:12:20.354, Speaker B: My point is it doesn't have to be a flat out default. If you just change some of these assumptions, you can bend this curve.
00:12:20.474 - 00:13:04.248, Speaker A: Yeah, that's interesting. I'd be curious how you think about a lot of founders that I talk to, and Mike and I have these conversations all the time, is what's happening in 2024? And it feels like, when I think about the economy, if someone told me two years ago that the Fed was about to hike rates by 500 points. Impending recession imminent. Right. But it does feel like there's been these pockets of recessions, like B two B SaaS had a big recession and there are big layoffs, but it doesn't feel like the economy has had a big recession, and it feels like the economy almost, like, sidestepped these rate hikes. Is that how you view the economy as well right now responding to the rate hikes. Or I'd be curious how you think about that now and how you think about that as you look forward to 2024.
00:13:04.376 - 00:13:40.426, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, my biggest factor when I think about the economy is actually the labor market. And the labor market is just so strong. And so whether you look at unemployment statistics, the participation rates have started to normalize post COVID. But frankly, I see this with all my coworkers and everyone you talk to in the economy. Their attitudes towards work have changed, whether it's work towards work from home or whatever. And listen, the consumer is super strong. Corporate America is super strong.
00:13:40.426 - 00:14:15.242, Speaker B: Yes, there's a kind of refinancing risk a couple of years out, but it's really the government that paid for all the bills on COVID. None of the rest of us did. So I feel like until that really manifests itself, I'm not that concerned about the economy and the technical GDP numbers. Just to me I'm like, well listen, if we're at low, almost full employment, very low unemployment statistics, that's a good main street's happy as long as inflation doesn't eat away all their earnings.
00:14:15.378 - 00:14:29.114, Speaker A: Maybe you could actually share the original Vanax story tied into gold. I've heard you share this wonderful story. I think it was your father started the firm and gold. You can share the story instead of me because I'm sure I'll botch it, but would love to hear the original.
00:14:29.154 - 00:15:07.868, Speaker B: Listen, it's this high conviction macro approach to the markets. So my father started the firm in 1955, and as an american he said, listen, the recovery in growth in Germany and Japan after World War two is great. You can buy these companies cheaper than american companies. This is something that people should put in their portfolios. And the logistics at that point of actually buying international stocks in foreign currencies was much better to do in a mutual fund. So that was his thesis. He was a little bit more of a wonk and an economist than a great marketer.
00:15:07.868 - 00:16:04.604, Speaker B: So the business didn't grow very much. And then as the nerd that he was in his forties, he decided to get a PhD in economics at night, even though he had two little kids at home and two jobs. And he studied under an austrian economist that many crypto people know well, Ludwig von Mises at NYU, who convinced them that government spending and effectively money easing was going to cause inflation in the United States. At that point, gold was a way to take advantage of that. That was the established countercurrency to everything but gold was fixed against the dollar. And as I like to point out, it had been fixed against the dollar. For the entirety of us history, gold really was the basis of value globally.
00:16:04.604 - 00:16:22.170, Speaker B: He said, listen, that's going to break. I don't know when, but it's going to break. So he sold 80% of his fund and bought gold mining shares, which he had to buy shares because buying gold was illegal.
00:16:22.272 - 00:16:33.566, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Which is a crazy thing to do because of the price of gold had stayed flat for almost 200 years. It's a crazy thing to do.
00:16:33.750 - 00:17:35.090, Speaker B: I recall, like at the breakfast table, like, you know, tuning into 1010 wins radio. And what was the gold price fixing in the morning? This was after it started moving. But for three years, the price of gold did not change against the dollar. And, you know, my dad would pull out this chart of homestake mining and the recession and the depression, saying, well, you know, when there's uncertainty, gold shares can actually rally. But I mean, it was an outlier story at best. But then, you know, when, when we got off the gold standard in 71, you know, gold went from $35 to $800 an ounce. So again, it's that kind of macro view and understanding that what, what historians I think appreciate more than everyone else is that the future, forget the past, the future can be a set of outcomes that are crazier than everyone else, sort of just pivots towards the recent past.
00:17:35.090 - 00:18:05.624, Speaker B: So anyway, so that's the story of the company. And I think I've learned a lot from that and it informs a lot about how we think about portfolios. And Jason, one last comment. What I think is it's only odd for Americans, the rest of the world, you would never think, oh, if you're Argentinian, oh, yeah, I'm going to be 60 40 invested in the argentinian markets as the core. And never question that. Never. You would go broke within ten years, every decade.
00:18:06.484 - 00:18:09.144, Speaker A: What do you think your dad would have thought about bitcoin?
00:18:09.924 - 00:18:31.328, Speaker B: Oh, I think he definitely would see its value. He wasn't like a tech lover per se. But I think all the logic behind it and the concerns about governments in general being unable to stop spending is just something that resonated with him.
00:18:31.456 - 00:18:51.274, Speaker A: Yeah. So when you think about the ideal portfolio, this like 60 40 portfolio, how much do you think the, from a historical lens, like, how do you think about how macro and technology changes impact that 60 40 portfolio? Does the portfolio allocation change or does what's inside the 60 and the 40 change?
00:18:51.394 - 00:19:42.674, Speaker B: That's what I focus on right so if you think about, as I do, most, crypto x, bitcoin as just aggressive growth investments, that's the sleeve, right. That it should come out of your portfolio if you're more aggressive and the 60% is equities. It's just so saying, listen, a, if you want some growth exposure, this is something you should definitely consider as disruptive change number one. And number two, be aware of the other parts of your equity portfolio, what might get disrupted, what might lose the value because of this technology on the fixed income side. And I won't do a long diversion there. There are a lot of exciting options in fixed income as well. I've been very bullish fixed income coming into this year, but it's certainly not just by the ten year.
00:19:42.674 - 00:19:48.826, Speaker B: There's a lot of investment grade paper available at the short end that was high single digits.
00:19:48.970 - 00:20:08.248, Speaker A: Yeah. Are bitcoin and ETH in your mind when you start to think about. There's almost two ways I wanted to ask you about crypto as a whole. There's as the investment for financial advisors and for portfolio managers, and then there's the crypto as a corporate strategy, basically. But maybe we can start with the investment. Yeah, go ahead.
00:20:08.336 - 00:20:18.728, Speaker B: I mean, Ethan and a lot of the other really foundational projects to me are growth kind of investments through the token or the VC.
00:20:18.776 - 00:20:23.744, Speaker A: Ethan is almost more of a technology investment. Bitcoin is more of the digital gold investment today.
00:20:23.864 - 00:20:57.884, Speaker B: Exactly. Yon is not a 60, I shouldn't even say 60 40 or 40 60, because Jan's probably a 60 30 ten person. I'm probably more tactical than my dad would have been, but I definitely want gold and bitcoin in my portfolio knowing that the biggest risk is out there, the federal budget deficit. Given that we know that. Well, we don't know, but I think that we're near the end of this fed cycle of tightening. We're certainly closer to the end than the beginning. Then.
00:20:57.884 - 00:21:18.058, Speaker B: Then don't try to guess the timing of the move. Listen, crypto people will be like, you're crazy. The happening is next year. Like, you're insane. This is the best tactical opportunity. I think of it more just if you look at the fed cycle, you don't know the timing of when this gets priced in, and this is a great time to own it. But I've been saying that for several months.
00:21:18.146 - 00:21:36.724, Speaker A: Yeah. I've got a tweet lined up for you that I'll tell you on the podcast, which is, we've got Q one. Bitcoin ETF launches Q two, we've got the having, Q three, we've got rate cuts ahead of the election. How do we feel about. And that lines up with the historic four year bitcoin cycle. How do we feel about that?
00:21:37.784 - 00:21:54.784, Speaker B: If one is cynical about the election, then you want at least six months for lower rates to kick in. So I'd be like a very exciting spring with the havening and the bitcoin ETF and rates being cut maybe all at the same time.
00:21:54.904 - 00:21:55.640, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:21:55.832 - 00:21:56.752, Speaker B: What do you think?
00:21:56.888 - 00:22:18.416, Speaker A: So you guys got into the ETF business a lot earlier than a lot of other folks. You guys saw the kind of writing on the wall with ETF's. I think it was 2006, I want to say. Yeah. And then you, I think, filed for your first bitcoin ETF in 2017. What do you think? The, I want to start to transition this into the Vaneck products around crypto. And Martin, we'll bring you in in a second here.
00:22:18.416 - 00:22:31.784, Speaker A: Thanks for being patient with us. But what do you think the likelihood that a bitcoin ETF gets approved in 2023 is, which is probably very low likelihood, versus maybe March of 2024, which is when I know a lot of folks are waiting for that timeline.
00:22:33.604 - 00:23:29.670, Speaker B: There's, I can say is there's obviously movement at the SEC now where there was absolutely no movement until a month ago. So whether it's just, I have no idea, December or March, I'm not a mind reader, but what I would point it to, well, obviously, they didn't appeal the grayscale decision, but I think more interestingly, you should look at and listen. It's super frustrating to vanek because we were first to file in almost all of these categories, like, by years, like ETH, spot ETH futures, bitcoin futures, like, anyway, but we are where we are. And the SEC said, listen, we don't want to give anyone an issue or an unfair advantage. So what they did with ETH futures is they effectively said to the firms that it's showing an interest in, that we're going to try to get you all to market on the same day. And they did. It's really the first time in ETF history where something like that has happened.
00:23:29.670 - 00:23:40.194, Speaker B: Now, there wasn't a lot of market demand for the ETH futures products, so I would imagine a similar thing is in their mind for spot bitcoin.
00:23:41.094 - 00:23:53.814, Speaker A: Is the bitcoin ETF important because it's puts a stamp of approval on the industry or because it basically allows financial advisors to be able to recommend this for the first time like, why is this such an important milestone?
00:23:54.114 - 00:24:19.378, Speaker B: Well, listen, two things. One is more symbolic than anything else. I mean, it's important because everyone thinks it's important. So you have this circular argument, I like gold, I like bitcoin. What's the value? Well, the value in it is there's limited supply, and then the crowd thinks it's valuable. But you go to, like, a Warren Buffett. He will never like gold.
00:24:19.378 - 00:24:52.946, Speaker B: He will never like bitcoin because there's no income stream associated with it. Not true for maybe some other crypto, but let's just say that for our argument's sake. So you get into the circular argument. So to that extent, the spot bitcoin ETF launching is important. Why? Because everyone thinks it's important. I mean, globally, everyone has their eye on the SEC, on this, on this issue, but practically speaking, it's going to be a great product as well. So if you look at the spot bitcoin products that trade in Canada, Brazil and Europe, they trade at really tight spreads.
00:24:52.946 - 00:25:21.334, Speaker B: And the infrastructure, I mean, I don't like these institutions, Jason, don't get me wrong, but the established stock exchanges around the world have very hardened infrastructure. So you're finding a product that trades really tight, very reliably, in a regulated manner. And also it's super tax efficient for Americans. It's way better than these futures based bitcoin and e products.
00:25:22.554 - 00:25:41.314, Speaker A: How would you recommend someone who has a large risk appetite be positioned in terms of going into next year? So take someone like myself on the younger side, like crypto a lot. How would you recommend someone like myself basically position their portfolio.
00:25:44.294 - 00:25:50.794, Speaker B: All in? I mean, listen, who knows?
00:25:51.294 - 00:26:04.204, Speaker A: The reason I ask is it feels impossible to position a portfolio in this market. I'm not sure if it's ever felt easy, but it does feel very difficult right now to try to think about how to allocate your portfolio.
00:26:05.464 - 00:26:57.052, Speaker B: Listen, this whole thing could be a sham, like a lot of people think it is. It could be that web, two companies adopt some crypto technology, some Wall street firms do permission blockchains, and you and I will have other jobs in three years. Right? It could be. So you have to discount the future because no one knows. Right? But if bitcoin has now been established, which I think it has been, and I've thought so for five years, as an alternative, just like silver has, or platinum, to demand for gold as a store of value, then you've got a almost close to perfect setup as a trade, right? You've got the. You said it. Your tweet storm of next spring, right? You've got the Fed changing its policy or nearing the end of it.
00:26:57.052 - 00:27:38.158, Speaker B: You've got the havening, you've got other uncertainties and you've got the liquidation that has occurred in the market. I've been involved in some really blown up asset classes in my career. Emerging market debt was one of them, where the bonds issued by countries were trading at like 4510 cents on the dollar. And so what do you see? You see everyone liquidating. You see the market makers liquidating, so there's no infrastructure. And now I guess the narrative around the FTX bankruptcy is their portfolio will be liquidated. I just can't imagine who else there is to sell.
00:27:38.158 - 00:28:11.184, Speaker B: And if you look at the statistics on, on chain and c five sales of bitcoin and other coins, I mean, it's all supportive of that simple story. The only thing that doesn't make sense is if this is true what Jason and Jan are saying, then why doesn't the market price it in? And this is one of the mysteries of the financial markets. Like, you know, the havening always leads to a bull market. Why don't people, yeah, I mean you've, how many, I don't know, happenings you've lived through like, you were like, why don't people anticipate this? And there's no accounting for the crowd.
00:28:12.764 - 00:29:08.056, Speaker A: This episode is brought to you by Toku. Toku makes implementing global token compensation and incentive awards simple. With Toku, you get unmatched tax and legal support to grant and administer your global team's tokens. From easy to use token grant award templates, through token vesting to managing tax withholdings, Toku understands every grant structure. Token purchase agreements, restricted token awards, restricted token units, token options, token appreciation rights, and even phantom tokens. For legal, finance and HR teams, it is a huge, complex task to have to comply with global regulations around compensating people with tokens, not to mention the payroll tax obligations, tax reporting in every country that you employ someone, it is difficult, time consuming, manual and costly. And it is drawing more and more attention from regulators and governments.
00:29:08.056 - 00:29:39.222, Speaker A: Toku makes this simple for leading teams across the space. Protocol labs, DyDX Foundation, Mina Foundation, Hedera Gnosis, safe getcoin, and a lot more. Reach out to toku@toku.com forward slash Empire or click the link in the description. Martin, let's, I want to pull you in now. So I've agreed with nearly everything Jan said so far, except, well, I don't actually think he agreed. Would agree with this, but it's the buffet thing about there's no cash flows in crypto.
00:29:39.222 - 00:29:44.224, Speaker A: There are cash flows in crypto, and it comes from. I know, I know. You don't actually think that yan.
00:29:44.264 - 00:29:45.672, Speaker B: I said, I said bitcoin, but.
00:29:45.688 - 00:30:22.214, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, exactly. Okay, so no cash flows from bitcoin, but there is something which is ETH. And I know you spend a lot of time trying to think about. Okay, maybe it's not just an ETH, like a spot ETH ETF, but maybe there's more that we can do and maybe we can capture mev and give that back to institutions, or maybe there's something that we can do with, with staking. So I'd love to just hear more about, like, how you and market vector and van Eck as a whole are thinking about capturing more of the value, like what I'd call crypto native value, and packaging that up for the institutional crowd.
00:30:22.374 - 00:30:44.296, Speaker B: Can I. Sorry to interrupt, but let me just frame market vector. So, market vector is a wholly owned subsidiary of Vanac. It was when we set up our ETF business and had some ideas, we said, well, there is no good ETF. Sorry, no index to track this ETF we want to do. Let's create our own. But market vector has grown beyond that.
00:30:44.296 - 00:31:07.788, Speaker B: They have 100 nonvanet clients and they have 20 nonviolent crypto clients, including Coinbase and a whole bunch of other people. So I just wanted to frame before Martin answers that more narrow question, we want to be a really thoughtful and research forward provider of data and indices in the industry. And so far, some other people have agreed with us.
00:31:07.896 - 00:31:16.340, Speaker A: Hmm. So when someone. So when someone wants to build an ETF, they will go to market vector to help them construct that ETF.
00:31:16.452 - 00:31:31.904, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, the first retail bitcoin funding Canada, used one of our indices. We've got, you know, an ETF company in Brazil. We've got other companies in Europe besides our own offering. So, yeah, sorry, I will now be quiet and self mute. Go ahead.
00:31:32.884 - 00:32:33.062, Speaker C: I mean, it's a good question. Before we start with Yves, maybe why an index? Because in crypto, there is no standard. And especially if I ask you for the bitcoin price, what's the bitcoin price? Do you look at Coinbase, at Binance, at Bitfinex? There are huge differences. And so we really have sophisticated algorithms, weighted exchanges, to come up with a reliable reference price, which is important for an ETF, especially for regulated products, but also for derivatives. And so we do that for a lot of single token indexes, but also baskets, of course. And when we come to Ethereum, I think the latest innovation, and the thing I really am excited about is that we finally have a cash flow product. If you look at the, we talked about the rates market, right? It's a huge market in treadfi.
00:32:33.062 - 00:32:51.638, Speaker C: Yeah. If you look at the derivatives market. Yeah. Easter figures, I think swap markets is around $500 trillion. Yeah, trillion with a t. And I ask you, how large is the rates market in crypto? Zero, more or less. Right.
00:32:51.638 - 00:34:06.280, Speaker C: And so with the change from proof of work to proof of stake in Ethereum, I think it really is the new driving force. And suddenly you have a cash flow, which is, I mean, a lot of people say it's a risk free rate. That is staking rewards rate. I have a problem with risk free, but I would say it's the lowest risk rate you can get in crypto when you compare that with lending your USDC out where you have counterparty risk, or if you are in a liquidity pool and facing permanent loss. So what we did here is that together with our partner figment, we asked the question, what is the staking rewards rate? Because if you look at Coinbase, if you stake at Coinbase, Kraken, figment, block, daemon, they all have different staking rewards rate. Yeah. And what we see here is we index size, the whole Ethereum chain, so all 800,000 plus validators and come up with a daily annualized staking rewards rate.
00:34:06.280 - 00:34:47.084, Speaker C: Our staker rate, comparable what you have in the money market with liber on our software. And if you go back to this daily rate, I think it's slide three. Right? What you see is there are two components there. The consensus layer rewards. That's the orange area, which is basically the inflation, the newly minted Eve. And what is super interesting is the execution layer reward you get since the merge, since September 2022. That's basically the priority fees and the MEV part.
00:34:47.084 - 00:35:16.744, Speaker C: And I'd like to say it's the heartbeat of Ethereum, because whenever the economic activity is high, the rate is shooting up. And here, I love this chart, if you do the deep dive. So what are layer ones doing? They sell block space. And whenever block space demand is high, people are getting crazy. They are bidding high transaction fees. There are a lot of mav opportunities. And then this rate is shooting up.
00:35:16.744 - 00:36:00.964, Speaker C: And you saw that during the FTX debacle when people wanted to get their assets off the exchange to their wallet. Or an extreme example is the March banking crisis we had. So the staking rate shoot up from 7% to almost 16% in a day and then down 7%. Why? Because Silicon Valley bank went under. USDC had large deposits at this bank, and suddenly we have this deepak. So a lot of people were selling their USDC and bidding up the fees again. And it doesn't always have to be related to negative events, as you see.
00:36:00.964 - 00:36:58.272, Speaker C: For example, during this pepe meme coin craziness, we also had a lot of block space demand and during the curve exploit. So what's interesting is you can look at the plethora of on chain fundamentals, or you can just look at our stake rate to see what is going on on the Ethereum chain. Why is this so important? To unlock financial innovation, you need a benchmark. You need some kind of standardization as I talk to you. Yeah. You can't use different staking rates from Coinbase or block daemon or what have you. Whenever you have standardization, commodities market standardized, futures market, standardized tenors and notional values, you suddenly need that tool for this EPM rate.
00:36:58.272 - 00:37:42.836, Speaker C: And with this benchmark rate, you can really do a lot of interesting things. For example, you can do swaps on this. Take rate, for example, if you're a validator and you get the variable rate and you want to have a fixed rate, maybe you get into a fixed two variable swap with a hedge fund who wants to bet on the movement of this variable rate, and you suddenly exchange this. Yeah, you can also do basis swaps and merge two worlds with, for example, you're long the staker rates and you get short the fed funds rate, for.
00:37:42.860 - 00:38:13.604, Speaker A: Example, which is very similar. Like, basically what you're saying is, all right, so now you have this base rate in DeFi. And what that does is it unlocks a bunch of financial innovation on chain. So if you think about like interest rate swaps, for example, a company wouldn't be able to take out a variable, you know, rate loan or that could crush them. Or my mortgage, for example, like I got a fixed rate mortgage because I didn't want a variable rate mortgage. Those types of products don't yet exist in DeFi because there's no rate.
00:38:13.944 - 00:38:14.544, Speaker C: Right?
00:38:14.664 - 00:38:15.364, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:38:15.744 - 00:39:49.094, Speaker C: So for example, if you lend your ETH out on what rate is this based? I mean, now it's a bilateral negotiated rate based on, I don't know, but it should be at least based on the staker rate plus a spread, for example. And so what we also did is, and I think getting back to this, why this could be a really important benchmark for the crypto space what I like about the staking is it's non custodial, so you have no counterparty risk. And that's, I think an important differentiator when it comes to the rates you normally have and you have no smart contract risk as all the things are enshrined in the base protocol. I think a more intuitive product is if you apply the staking rewards rate to an existing Ethereum product, to the price index to come up with a real total return product. And that's something you see on slides, on the next slide or slide seven. Yes. So we are all familiar with the plain vanilla Ethereum products, but why shouldn't you get the Ethereum price plus the rewards? Similar to if you invest in a stock fund.
00:39:49.094 - 00:40:16.514, Speaker C: Yeah, you get the stock price, the stock price development and the dividend. You don't talk to the portfolio manager and say keep the dividend. I'm just interested in the price development and what you see here. We've done that for our normal market vector Ethereum index. That's the purple line. So since the merge it's basically flat. But if you include the staking rewards rate, you're suddenly up 15%.
00:40:16.514 - 00:40:46.642, Speaker C: And let's see a compounded, you can set this index with a compounding feature. So for example, let's say you have a large fund, you can set up new validators with the ETH you've earned. You can also set that just for accumulation. But I think it's really intuitive that you see okay, in the long term I think that will establish as a standard.
00:40:46.778 - 00:41:07.914, Speaker A: Yeah. And Jan, when you think about this and you meet more portfolio managers and financial advisors than most people on this earth, what is the demand for something like this? Are they talking about staking and talking about capturing mev rewards or this is you're maybe planning for 2030 by building things like this?
00:41:08.534 - 00:41:56.026, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, Martin could probably answer the question better than me because this isn't something that's easily deliverable through an ETF because the ETF's right, you can't stake because you need to have the daily liquidity. So I think it would be for other financial advisors. I think if you ask me a question today, where's the, you still have this concept in emerging markets called crossover money because the emerging markets, people were all weirdos, right, and they had passports and things like that. And most people were trading us government bonds or corporate bonds. But once in a while things became so interesting. There was this crossover demand, which is huge if you ask me what the biggest crossover demand potential is in crypto right now. I think it's people buying bitcoin, like macro funds.
00:41:56.026 - 00:42:23.308, Speaker B: And this is, I think, some of the narrative out of Blackrock as well, where through their Aladdin technology platform, I think they see, I'm guessing, but I think they see a lot of crossover generalist investors saying, you know what, I'd like to leg into bitcoin here as a tactical trade. So I think there is demand in the crypto ecosystem for exactly what Martin was talking about. But I think that's probably smaller than the bitcoin crossover trade.
00:42:23.476 - 00:42:26.790, Speaker A: Yeah. So it's funny because, or Martin, anything.
00:42:26.822 - 00:42:53.162, Speaker C: You'D add to that, I think you have to have a global perspective. I do think in the. Yes, I absolutely agree. We are happy if we get the spot bitcoin ETF and then a plain vanilla ethereum ETF. Right. But we are really talking with european investors who are interested in it also with asian investors. And the liquidity part is something I think you can solve.
00:42:53.162 - 00:43:21.684, Speaker C: Yeah. You don't have to stake 100% of your portfolio, so you can set a utilization ratio, meaning the proportion of your fund, maybe just 30, 40%, is staked with staking as a service provider. And in addition to that, you operate with liquid staking derivative. Right. For example, with liquid collective, they also do KYC, aml. And then suddenly you can play around with it. So that's it.
00:43:22.624 - 00:44:06.384, Speaker A: Yeah. It's interesting because we're talking about, I'd call this a very crypto native product, and it actually ties into a question I wanted to ask you, Jan, when I look at the Vanek Twitter, which I'm going to link to the Twitter in the show notes, because it's a very interesting, it's a very fun Twitter account, I would say when I think about Vanek, very traditional firm, been around 70 ish years. When I look at the Twitter, it is run by a very crypto native, probably on the younger side, like type of person. And that's telling me a little bit about how you view who your end customer might be. Maybe not now, but maybe in the future, who is. I guess I just ask you point blank, who is your end customer and how crypto native is that person when you picture someone in your head?
00:44:08.484 - 00:44:40.146, Speaker B: We have very different customers. I mean, our tradfi and crypto customers, there's almost no a Venn diagram and there's no overlap. It's really crazy. So to your point? Yes. On our Twitter account, we're trying to reach our crypto native customers. And, you know, crypto Twitter is a big, a big thing. You know, you and I talked about Vanek's strategy and crypto and all this kind of stuff, and I think big picture.
00:44:40.146 - 00:45:12.954, Speaker B: It's just been super frustrating how hard it is in the US regulatory environment to get more crypto native faster. If you believe that the technology offers cost and networking advantages to users and can disrupt existing cost structures. Wow. The last several years have been pretty frustrating. How fast that moves. I almost feel like we're trying to keep our crypto native friends entertained and engaged while we kind of catch up to that potential.
00:45:13.614 - 00:45:33.834, Speaker A: Yeah. How deep do you think about, when you think about your corporate strategy as a whole, you're doing, it's October, do an end of year planning, thinking about the future. How deep do you want to push into crypto? Like, will you start running nodes, for example, will you become an LP on chain? How deep do you see your vanak pushing into crypto?
00:45:34.784 - 00:46:11.404, Speaker B: So sort of since our reemergence after DeFi summer in 2020, we've gotten pretty aggressive. We have an active research and investing team here out of New York. We've expanded. We offer twelve funds in Europe that offer exposure to one or more tokens. We've talked about Martin's effort, but we have some on chain. I mean, we've invested through venture capital funds that connect us directly to developers. And we are partnering with, well, we have actually, this is for its topic for another day.
00:46:11.404 - 00:46:57.308, Speaker B: We have our own on chain project ourselves, but we're also partnering with a lot of those projects. So it's very important that we do that in a very regulatory compliant manner because that's our firm's ethos to begin with. But as we know, the rest of the world is much more friendly towards these kind of developments, especially Europe. And I think that was Martin point and a lot of, there's a lot of liquidity and interest that comes out of Asia, even forgetting kind of recent developments in Hong Kong and Singapore. So, yeah, it's stuff they can't fully talk about now, but very much feel like outsider looking in. But we're getting there. We're getting there.
00:46:57.396 - 00:47:13.854, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, we've seen it, right. Because we have all this insights into who's listening to our podcast, who's reading our newsletters, who's attending our conferences. And we made the decision, I was telling you over the weekend, to move our digital asset summit from. We were going to do it in DC. Turns out, not a great idea to do it. Kind of in the belly of the beast.
00:47:13.854 - 00:47:18.114, Speaker A: We're going to London. Right. And the interest has been nuts for us.
00:47:18.974 - 00:47:34.004, Speaker B: I mean, just as an anecdote, what's interesting is, you know, some of my colleagues are meeting with banks in the Mideast in Asia, and they have a mandate almost from the government that they have to have crypto capabilities. Right.
00:47:34.124 - 00:47:45.492, Speaker A: One of the biggest banks in Japan. I'm not sure if this is public yet or not, so I won't say the name, but they are offering staking rewards to all of their customers, retail and institutional, and they're offering staking rewards.
00:47:45.588 - 00:47:47.196, Speaker C: So here we have it.
00:47:47.380 - 00:47:48.700, Speaker A: That's with you guys?
00:47:48.892 - 00:48:02.064, Speaker C: Yeah. No, that's not with us. But I think that's another proof for the. Maybe Warren Buffett some someday invests in. I mean, he invests in, not in gold, but in gold mining stocks.
00:48:03.084 - 00:48:33.510, Speaker A: I mean, if you. What bank does Buffett own a lot of at a Bank of America or some wells fart, one of those big ones. And what I'm earning in my bank of America account right now is I don't even know if I'm earning anything. I don't even know if I'm getting any yield. If I just sit in cash in my bank of America account, there's. You could quickly see a future using, I don't know, maybe using your guys's product where the cash in my account, you could either allocate it to treasuries. Right? Or you could start to allocate it to the.
00:48:33.510 - 00:48:38.062, Speaker A: To the staking rate. So, Martin.
00:48:38.118 - 00:48:38.958, Speaker C: Yes, why not?
00:48:39.086 - 00:48:41.834, Speaker A: Yeah. What other products are you excited about right now?
00:48:42.654 - 00:49:24.300, Speaker C: So, definitely the staking thing. But the other big innovation we will launch soon is a new breed of baskets, fundamentally weighted. You know, normal baskets are market cap weighted. And I have to say, it's a good starting point, a market cap weighted index. If you know that, you don't know anything, it's a good start. But as you know, a lot of people sometimes, especially in the crypto space, then have problems with some of the tokens in the top ten. For example, there's ether, nothing going on, for example, with Cardano, or you have a meme token in it.
00:49:24.300 - 00:50:24.034, Speaker C: Dogecoin. Nobody wants to invest, or they are still. It's surprising, but still litecoin, the poor man's bitcoin, and bitcoin cash is still top ten. And so we thought maybe we can improve the selection process. You have all these on chain fundamentals real time, and why shouldn't we use that? And so we partnered with token terminal to get their data, to use their data. And so we will select tokens and coins according to their economic traction, meaning what do they earn? Or how many active users do they have to account for network effects and adoption? And the interesting thing is that it looks a little bit different. Yes, you still have bitcoin and ethereum, but you are catching more of the smaller altcoins earlier.
00:50:24.034 - 00:50:51.574, Speaker C: For example, an actual snapshot would also consider arbitrum L2, or lido, which would never enter a classic top ten index. So we will do a top ten fundamental index, and that will allow for investors who are maybe more deep into it and want a second iteration, also an iteration which performs better than our market cap.
00:50:52.194 - 00:51:34.014, Speaker B: I just like to say, to say to our traditional customers, what are you doing with crypto? It's all speculative. And I say very quickly, look, there's 20,000 tokens out there that represent software projects, but there are a handful, the 50 or 100, that actually generate some kind of fee income, either directly or through their ecosystem. That's what we're paying attention to. Why can't you do analysis on that income stream and that possibility, just like a traditional company? So it's sort of, yes, let's create an index. I'm so excited by what Martin is doing. That actually takes away. Listen, dogecoin is great, but it's all optionality at this point.
00:51:34.014 - 00:51:46.104, Speaker B: So let's just take out those kind of investments because they're very speculative. And look, maybe all of crypto is speculative, but there's the shades. So I find this, I mean, we're.
00:51:46.144 - 00:52:16.330, Speaker A: It'S the conversation that we have internally, especially on the, on the research side of our business with, with blockworks research, which is, everyone basically treats these protocols as these, like, weird esoteric protocols, but a decent number of them now have real financials and real, real user metrics. Right. So why are we talking about Makerdao as this, like, weird esoteric protocol instead of talking about it as something that'll do like 150 million in revenue this year and has a cost structure and has revenues and spits off profits. Right.
00:52:16.442 - 00:52:17.098, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:52:17.266 - 00:52:18.562, Speaker A: I love that you guys are doing that.
00:52:18.658 - 00:52:33.598, Speaker C: Yeah. It's still underestimated. People still don't know that there are protocols producing, which produce cash flow. Right. They all think it's, it's nothing. They do nothing. It's, it's, it's just price appreciation.
00:52:33.598 - 00:52:42.878, Speaker C: And that's not true. And I hope that we can change that with that index. And, and we definitely also have to do more on the educational front.
00:52:43.046 - 00:52:49.438, Speaker A: Yeah, folks can subscribe to blockworks research if they want to see that sound, for example.
00:52:49.486 - 00:52:49.910, Speaker C: Yes.
00:52:50.022 - 00:53:00.052, Speaker A: Actually you guys are pretty active in our chat. We've a subscriber only chat and there's some, some vanak folks. Do you guys have a liquid fund? I feel like there's some people at your liquid fund who are in the chat.
00:53:00.188 - 00:53:01.996, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, Prunov.
00:53:02.180 - 00:53:23.684, Speaker A: Yes, exactly. Exactly. So yan, I heard you say on a podcast the other day, it might have been with Mike on, on the margin earlier this year that you thought a central bank could buy bitcoin at some point in the next twelve months. I'm curious if you think that that has already happened or if you still think that that's a, a high likelihood probability.
00:53:24.824 - 00:54:13.620, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it's sort of more specifically a frontier central bank. Right. So not maybe the United States or Canada, but you know, as part of the evolution and maturation of bitcoin, going from an eight year old to like a twelve year old, you know, there are some government institutions that are very close to that. They invest in mining assets. If you own a miner, then you're pretty close to getting an income stream in bitcoin, last I checked. But in a major symbolic way, I guess we probably haven't crossed that. But absolutely, you do have countries that in the short term are sort of dollarizing.
00:54:13.620 - 00:54:29.798, Speaker B: So Ecuador, now Argentina with their election a couple of days ago, so we just forget how the rest of the world has a demand for an open payment protocol. Yeah, I think that's also, and their central banks reflect. Understand that.
00:54:29.926 - 00:55:02.804, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. I said I wasn't going to bring up regulation, but I do have one question for you, which is I'd be curious if you think that this regulatory regime with Gensler and stuff is everyone, I feel like sure, we're all on the same page that it might be, feels like a bit of an overreach, but do you think that this is where the US is headed as a whole? Like it's just almost going to get worse and worse? Or do you think that this is just a spectrum and regulation tends to ebb and flow back and forth and we might be at a more intense point in that spectrum and then it will add back.
00:55:05.904 - 00:55:45.104, Speaker B: It's kind of simpler than that. I think if you look at, look at China, right under Deng Xiaoping, they adopted free market policies, 30 years of tremendous growth, Xi Jinping, a different mix of policies, slower growth, more regulation. I think this is just one administration to the next, although I'll caveat that with we don't know what a republican administration would do with respect to crypto. So I think it's very much top down. So I think policies can change dramatically. I mean, you see that in so many areas between Biden and Trump. So we'll just have to see.
00:55:45.224 - 00:55:49.160, Speaker A: Do you think a republican administration would be more friendly to crypto?
00:55:49.272 - 00:55:50.736, Speaker B: It's hard to know, right?
00:55:50.880 - 00:56:07.844, Speaker A: It is, yeah. I actually don't think they'd be more friendly. I just think they'd be more hands off, which inherently would probably be good. But who knows? I don't know. All right, guys, this is a great chat. Anything. Jan, anything I'm missing, Martin, anything that you really wanted to talk about.
00:56:09.624 - 00:56:42.504, Speaker C: Maybe from a european perspective, because you asked, is this a big thing, the US ETF? And I think, although despite having a very pro crypto regulation in Europe, it had no price impact, suddenly you have the announcement in us with the spot bitcoin, ETF's and everything is blowing up. To think we still need the US to lead this and to have higher adoption. And I think that's also good for Europe and for the rest of the world. That's my opinion.
00:56:42.654 - 00:57:18.024, Speaker B: I would say. I do think for crypto, and I mean more ETH Plus plus to get out of this bear market, there has to be better user adoption. There's so much development happening. Compared to 2017, it's a different order of magnitude. But even compared to 2020, there's so many projects with potential, even with web two companies. But I kind of feel like real adoption and on chain activity is going to have to drive a bull market in crypto here. I think bitcoin is a different kind of, as we've talked about, but I do think that's possible.
00:57:18.024 - 00:57:33.340, Speaker B: I like the Solana Visa project, boy. Man, if you get some traction around that, the fact that we pay 3% on all credit card transactions in the United States is insane. It's insane.
00:57:33.532 - 00:57:44.680, Speaker A: Do you think that'll be led by what I bucket is stable coins and defi? Or will that be led by maybe something like decentralized social or on chain gaming? Which. Which side of that?
00:57:44.832 - 00:57:48.120, Speaker B: I'm a payments defi guy, but I work on Wall street. Like, what do you expect?
00:57:48.192 - 00:57:55.600, Speaker A: I'm with you. I'm with you. I'm with you. Cool. All right, guys, this is awesome. Yon really appreciate it, Martin. Really appreciate it as well.
00:57:55.600 - 00:58:06.048, Speaker A: Thank you so much. Very excited about this big macro firm, 70 plus years old, pushing deeper into crypto. It's really cool to see. So congrats on everything.
00:58:06.176 - 00:58:07.084, Speaker B: Thanks, Jason.
00:58:07.464 - 00:58:08.016, Speaker C: Thank you very.
