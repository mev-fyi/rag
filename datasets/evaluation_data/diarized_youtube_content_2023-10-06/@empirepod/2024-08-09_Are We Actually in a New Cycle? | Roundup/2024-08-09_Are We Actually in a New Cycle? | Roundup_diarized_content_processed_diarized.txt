00:01:35.884 - 00:01:38.604, Speaker B: I had a colossal fought on the bike I got.
00:01:38.652 - 00:01:39.412, Speaker A: Did you really?
00:01:39.556 - 00:01:40.108, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:01:40.204 - 00:01:40.908, Speaker A: What happened?
00:01:41.004 - 00:02:00.760, Speaker B: It'd been like a long time since I fell. I don't know. I was cycling with the buddies training for his ironman in Copenhagen next week and hits me up. I'm like, all right, let's go for a ride and venture over to Italy. And, man, just italian roads are just third world country. And on the descent, I just had a feeling like literally two minutes before I fell, I was like, I think I'm gonna fall.
00:02:00.800 - 00:02:05.544, Speaker A: And you look fine, though. You didn't scrape it up too much. Oh, yeah, you did this.
00:02:05.592 - 00:02:11.296, Speaker B: And then there's other parts of my body that are not as suited for. The people are listening.
00:02:11.328 - 00:02:14.100, Speaker A: On a Friday or Saturday. We can. We can show it off.
00:02:15.360 - 00:02:23.046, Speaker B: I don't know, man. I don't know what's worth the bear market or my bot or my bodily injuries. No, what bear market? Where?
00:02:23.078 - 00:02:32.210, Speaker A: Um, I'm sure if you just said, what's worse, my bodily injuries or my butt. But we'll, we'll take it. Dude, this, um. You know why you fell, right?
00:02:33.070 - 00:02:34.710, Speaker B: Karma. I don't know.
00:02:34.790 - 00:03:15.150, Speaker A: So when. When I was, um, I was in college, I did this, like, I'll share for another day, actually. I basically did this, like, multilevel marketing thing that, like, was ridiculous, um, and ended up being like, you know, probably, I don't know, should or should not have done that, but I was really good at it and had, like, thousands of people in, like, my, what is called a downline. And I got really into personal development stuff, like Bob Proctor, Tony Robbins, Napoleon, whatever his name. And one of the things was like, thoughts become things. So the reason you fell is you were thinking you were going to fall.
00:03:15.770 - 00:03:20.698, Speaker B: Visualized it. Wait. I'm thinking that my portfolio is going to do 100 x. Why haven't I done 100 x?
00:03:20.874 - 00:03:23.870, Speaker A: You're not thinking hard enough. You're not doing enough thinking.
00:03:24.730 - 00:03:25.418, Speaker B: Okay.
00:03:25.514 - 00:03:36.750, Speaker A: There are these guys in this company that I was doing it with, and they're like, you just. You just got to visualize. You just got to manifest it. And I was like, fucker. I'm manifesting. And I was, like, 18.
00:03:38.780 - 00:04:01.524, Speaker B: Well, uh, what are we manifesting this, uh, in this roundup? I mean, I guess, like, uh, I had a really good discussion yesterday with Kane. They were launching their own pod with Infinix. And, um, we were just talking about the markets, and it was like. It was just, uh, him and I just share. Um, we go way back, and so there's just so many stories that we could share. We could probably go on for hours. But, um, there.
00:04:01.524 - 00:04:41.870, Speaker B: I'd like to start this pod. There is this great tweet by ceteris. I think he goes by ceteris, basically shows a year to date performance of all the different coins bucketed by l one's AI and a bunch of deep end and other categories. And basically, the only categories you've made money this year is Solana and meme coins and a select handful of meme coins. And so we were just talking about. That was, like, the opening, right? And it's a. It got me thinking because I relistened to the pod with David Calc and what's his name.
00:04:42.490 - 00:04:43.498, Speaker A: Jeff. Jeff Park.
00:04:43.554 - 00:05:07.190, Speaker B: Jeff. Sorry, Jeff from Bitwise. A lot of people really liked it and reached out and said, oh, it was funny. We recorded that before the flash crash, I guess. But anyways, Kane and I both sort of came to the conclusion that it's like, it's a very. You would think that it gets easier to, like, navigate crypto cycles, but this cycle has just been. And whether you want to call it a cycle or not, Kobe thinks that we haven't even started the cycle.
00:05:07.190 - 00:06:03.620, Speaker B: But for all intents and purposes, this year, it has been very exactly this chart right here, ladies and gentlemen, so color coded. Sounds like this guy went to work at an investment bank. So the only categories that have made money are bitcoin up 32%, Solana outperforming bitcoin at 43%, and then pepe with bonk, flocky, and shib. Everything else is in a few, kind of like pendle and here or there. But you look at this, and it was like other cycles kind of didn't look like this. So it almost mimics the equity markets, right, where you've had a very concentrated return of the magnificent seven. And.
00:06:03.620 - 00:06:12.736, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think this is really good context for the pod. I don't know if we should go there, but there's a whole host of things that we can unpack here that.
00:06:12.768 - 00:06:15.820, Speaker A: Wait, I mean, let's do it. Go. Go in. So keep talking.
00:06:18.160 - 00:06:20.048, Speaker B: I'm doing all the heavy lifting and madness.
00:06:20.144 - 00:06:22.192, Speaker A: Dude, I'm eating lunch right now. I'm hungry.
00:06:22.296 - 00:06:23.568, Speaker B: Okay. All right, let's do it.
00:06:23.664 - 00:06:24.552, Speaker C: Wait, wait, wait.
00:06:24.576 - 00:06:26.048, Speaker B: What happened? What happened to the chart?
00:06:26.144 - 00:06:28.032, Speaker A: I want to show you eating. I want to show you my meatballs.
00:06:28.056 - 00:06:53.910, Speaker B: But wait, no, we've talked bodily. Anyways, moving on. So when we think about this. So, like, most fonts can't touch meme coins. Fine. All right, go listen to the pod with Joe McCann in November of last year. Probably one of the few fonts that actually was comfortable openly talking about owning meme coins.
00:06:53.910 - 00:07:23.430, Speaker B: Most can't or won't, at risk of being ridiculed by their lp's. But this is very much a have and have nots market, and I don't think. I mean, maybe my memory is betraying me here, but prior cycles didn't look like this. You obviously had Defi summer concentrated returns and outliers. But this is just extremes, right? You have severe underperformance and severe outperformance, and there's no man's land. Maybe Defi is kind of there, but it's still lagging. It's still down.
00:07:23.430 - 00:07:48.540, Speaker B: Um, I guess, like, um, certain going. Coming into the cycle, you would have said, um, I'm gonna. I'm gonna do, like. I'm gonna do the l one l two convergence. You know, I if. If something like ethereum does well, the l two should do well, right? Well, not really. You have, you know, Arb opinion.
00:07:48.540 - 00:08:00.288, Speaker B: Arb and op down. Relatively the same. 66%. 67%. Well, the modular thesis. Well, no, you got crushed, right. Tia down 58%.
00:08:00.288 - 00:08:29.690, Speaker B: Maybe you would have made some money on airdrops. Dimension down 75%. So that narrative kind of quickly went away. Some of the other l two s immutable, which is now fully vested mostly, is down 45, 46%. Manta is down 68%. Blast is not on this list, but it's also down. There's a whole host of criticisms around, you know, like, not much going on and points in the meta and all this stuff, but.
00:08:29.690 - 00:09:06.708, Speaker B: So, so the l one, l two as a whole, the ethereum ecosystem is just vastly underperformed, I think eth, I mean, eth here is 10%. I mean, shit, man, you're better off, like, doing a senior secured credit and clipping 15%. So that's underperformed quite dramatically. Just the ethereum ecosystem as a whole. The cosmos ecosystem as a whole. Ethereum, defi, there are some kind of bright spots, brighter spots. So, like ethereum, eth, defi, for context, has been underperformed.
00:09:06.708 - 00:09:43.854, Speaker B: And this is something Kane and I talked about extensively. Like, you know, Defi has been in a bear market since even November, since before rate hikes. But some by Maker weve talked about here is up 15%. Aaves rallied recently. I think theres this meta evolving around. What happens if rates with rate cuts now really on the horizon, does that make ethnic DeFi, or just defi as a whole more attractive? Possibly likely. This is a great comparison.
00:09:43.854 - 00:10:10.070, Speaker B: So, like Sol defi relative to ETH, Defi has outperformed vastly. And interestingly, a lot of these, like, trade at much higher ftbs, right? Like Jitto trades at, I forget, like 7 billion ftv, maybe more now they announced. But, you know, relative to, like, I know, I know they're not perfect.
00:10:10.490 - 00:10:11.786, Speaker A: I don't think judo is 7 billion.
00:10:11.858 - 00:10:18.190, Speaker B: Sorry, no, not Jupiter is. Yeah. Jito is 2.7 billion ftv, and.
00:10:20.570 - 00:10:23.954, Speaker A: Jupiter's probably over seven at this .8 or nine, correct?
00:10:24.002 - 00:10:40.542, Speaker B: Yeah. So judo is 2.7 billion. Market cap is only 340. So, you know, a lot of it's still locked. But compare that to Lido, which took a heavy beating, by the way, on Monday. Lido is at 1.7,
00:10:40.542 - 00:11:18.116, Speaker B: sorry, 1.1 billion. Most of it is already in circulation. So, like, market cap and fully diluted are very, very similar. So, like, that's just, you look at this, and of course, I mean, no surprise, right? There's a very clear, strong narrative of the cycle, which is Solana, and the Solana ecosystem vastly rerating relative to ethereum and other ecosystems. But primarily ethereum, which is returns off the bottom. And so what you want to look at also is what actually rebounds fastest, what catches a stronger bid.
00:11:18.116 - 00:11:44.120, Speaker B: And again, sold. Look at the top left, 31%. It's actually higher. Now, Sol is now 157. And some of the meme coins, like Wif here is 142. Now it's like oh, to 171. I mean, it's just incredible strength, right? And that is a very clear signal of what the market is bidding.
00:11:44.120 - 00:12:15.644, Speaker B: And anyways, there's the other observation I want to make, and then I'll pause and then, you know, I'll stop rambling, is a lot of the projects that there's just no bid. And we talked about this in the episode with David. It's like projects that are unlocking have vastly underperformed. Like, there's zero bids, there's zero interest in those. I don't want to say zero, right, but they're vastly underperforming. Right. There's just no liquidity in the system.
00:12:15.644 - 00:12:38.810, Speaker B: It's like hot balls of money moving around, mostly between the Solana ecosystem, mostly within memes. Any new moneys coming in? Mostly has been retail. And thats going directly into memes. And the meta around buying low float, high FTV coins is just really there and strong and top of mind. So, yeah.
00:12:40.630 - 00:13:24.596, Speaker A: David Canales at blockworks ran this analysis in the actually shout out, the Empire newsletter, so you can see for anyone watching on YouTube. So basically what he did is he took the S and P. So the green line here is the S and P. Then he said a BTC Maxi portfolio. He wanted to basically look at a BTC Maxi portfolio, a buy the dip portfolio, which says you put in, you invest more anytime there's a 10% drop, then an 80 20 portfolio, BTC 80 ETH at 20, and then a 60 20. So BTC 60, then Sol 20 Sol and ETH 20. And what you can see here is like, okay, so during this time period, this is from January 1, 2023.
00:13:24.596 - 00:13:50.780, Speaker A: Okay, so 80 20 portfolio up at 200%. BTC maxi up like 200 2230 buy the dip is up 400%. And then this 60 20 portfolio outperformed. I mean, it's up 450 ish percent. So, like, that's, I think, why you see the, what it feels like is the Solana ecosystem dancing on the timeline and everyone else.
00:13:51.520 - 00:13:58.536, Speaker B: To be fair, the date, the starting date, heavily influences the out.
00:13:58.608 - 00:13:59.352, Speaker A: Yeah, it does. It does.
00:13:59.376 - 00:14:02.896, Speaker B: And he, like, you're basically saying, like, and I'm telling you.
00:14:02.928 - 00:14:03.096, Speaker C: The.
00:14:03.128 - 00:14:26.552, Speaker B: The 1 January 2023 was the absolute bottom for Solana. It was when it hit $9, $8, 840 if you go back, if you, like, started in, I don't know, mid Jan souls already at 26.
00:14:26.696 - 00:14:27.288, Speaker A: Right.
00:14:27.424 - 00:14:36.748, Speaker B: That's. That would likely change the gray, the brown line for everyone watching online to below the dip.
00:14:36.884 - 00:14:39.044, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, yeah, yeah.
00:14:39.092 - 00:14:58.110, Speaker B: But I don't think it, like, I don't want to, like, look, great analysis. Um, the conclusions, I think, is still pretty much the same is if you didn't have Solana, your portfolio. Yeah. All right, let's get. You get paid to be. To get a couple things right. I understand if you don't want to pump meme coins, but, like, I.
00:14:58.110 - 00:14:59.738, Speaker B: Solana. Really.
00:14:59.914 - 00:15:23.894, Speaker A: So the question becomes then Santiago. And by the way, actually, before we get moving on from that so setters thing, I guess he did this first one is about returns off the bottom, but it's important to call out, like, there were things. People made a lot of money in 23. Right. So if you look at, like, Celestia is a good example. You were saying, like, this modular narrative. Like, celestia ripped from two to 20.
00:15:23.894 - 00:15:25.030, Speaker A: That's a nice ten x.
00:15:25.070 - 00:15:27.454, Speaker B: And, like, someone made money three months.
00:15:27.502 - 00:15:32.486, Speaker A: There, but now it's basically returned back to the. To. To its initial price.
00:15:32.558 - 00:15:32.934, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:15:33.022 - 00:15:34.318, Speaker A: Or maybe it's up 100%.
00:15:34.454 - 00:15:44.530, Speaker B: If ceteris is listening or one of your analysts wants to run this analysis, give me or show me a little dot of when the unlocks start.
00:15:45.630 - 00:15:48.982, Speaker A: That'd be a good thing to add to actually blockworks researchers platform. That's cool.
00:15:49.046 - 00:15:53.906, Speaker B: Yeah. Like, literally just start in telegraph and then obviously going forward. Right?
00:15:54.018 - 00:15:54.546, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:54.658 - 00:16:21.476, Speaker B: Um, I was having this discussion with probably the analysts I'm going to hire, um, around looking at just like, how market cap, instead of we. We tend to look at charts, mostly on. On price. Look at it on a market cap basis. For instance, it was relevant for Arb. Like, Arb. There's a lot of noise in this analysis, but, like, Arb as an example, like, it was trading at $2 before the big unlock.
00:16:21.476 - 00:16:33.624, Speaker B: You go to the art chart. Let's look at that. Okay, let's run this. So. So you go back to where. Not April, around where Das was April.
00:16:33.752 - 00:16:35.016, Speaker A: Oh, April 24.
00:16:35.088 - 00:16:54.120, Speaker B: Yeah, right around $2. I remember this. I'm an investor. $2 you start, then unlocks happen there. The big unlock happens there. I think it was like, a bigger amount than the linear. So I guess it was ten or 20% goes down to $1.60
00:16:54.120 - 00:17:03.696, Speaker B: ish. Level. Right. See that green line after that big dip down? That's support 160. Sorry. 1.6 around April.
00:17:03.696 - 00:17:17.168, Speaker B: Go to April. There, that green line right there, you see that $2. And then it dips to 160 then and there. All right, that's the first unlock right there. And then, and then this huge red.
00:17:17.224 - 00:17:18.552, Speaker A: You'Re saying this huge red candle.
00:17:18.616 - 00:17:23.624, Speaker B: Go even before that. March. Yeah, das was march, right?
00:17:23.752 - 00:17:28.500, Speaker A: Yeah, march. Okay, so this big one from 2.2 down to like one six.
00:17:28.960 - 00:17:42.790, Speaker B: Exactly. And then you have some, some bid. There's some support there, like one six and then boom. Again. And then there's, there's some market stuff. Like there was a, there's a big dip, I think, like everything kind of, of course, everything. You want to look at this.
00:17:42.790 - 00:18:29.200, Speaker B: Like, the market trend is still obviously down, um, for other stuff. So, like, what's signal? What, like what's specific arbitrum? What's like just market? Um, but, but, yeah, you know, I think it's, and I, and I tend to single out r because it's like high quality in my, look, none of this financial advice, but, like, incredible. Like I think is the best l two, the tech, the team, the ecosystem. It's a very buttoned up organization. It's like blue chip, let's call that. And again, we talk. My theory is, and I'd love someone to validate or invalidate this hypothesis, is if you're an early investor, you're in the money.
00:18:29.200 - 00:19:01.168, Speaker B: And so you didn't get into Seoul or maybe you had a very small, you didn't size it correctly. The rest of your portfolio is flat or up 10%. You did make some money 2023, but not enough to get above the high water mark. This idea of a high water mark is at the peak of 2021. You collect carry. If youre not a venture friend, youre a hedge fund. You collect carry.
00:19:01.168 - 00:19:23.986, Speaker B: You take a snapshot of the portfolio of an investment and say boom. Like, say its, youre up five x. You collect carry on that. Theres a snapshot of the value. So the values now 500, say, of the particular capital account, then the market goes down 80%. So that is now worth 100 again. Right.
00:19:23.986 - 00:20:06.590, Speaker B: So it goes down to 100 for that set of investors that were in the prior cycle. For you to start making collecting carry off of that base, you have to get above the watermark. The watermark is five, right. So, yeah, you did well in 2023. The market rebounded 2023. But if you didn't get very specific things right, like, not just sitting on ETH maybe bitcoin, but not Solana. You're likely not close or very close to that five number, the high water mark, meaning you invested in arbitrary last cycle or other projects.
00:20:06.590 - 00:20:24.460, Speaker B: And when you have an unlock like that, what are you going to do? You're obviously trigger happy because you're almost indiscriminately gonna sell to get a bot to get above that watermark.
00:20:24.500 - 00:20:25.060, Speaker C: Right?
00:20:25.220 - 00:21:26.130, Speaker B: Because you, because if, because ETH isn't carrying the weight you may have or may not size Solana well, or bitcoin. And you're sitting on a lot of these things. Like if you're clocking, you don't care if you're clocking up ten x at $2 or a eight x or a six x or a five x or a three x down at $0.50. What you care is to get above the five to get paid this year because you havent been eating the last two years. And that dynamic I think is carrying thats as a whole. I think what is challenging, and I was talking about this last year, I was talking about this a year before. Its like a lot of these unlocks, if you don't have new liquidity coming in, the early investors, especially coming off of the last cycle that need to really get above the watermark are going to be like for sellers in many ways.
00:21:26.130 - 00:22:10.472, Speaker B: And that is challenging in the context where you haven't really had new flows coming in. We talked about in the prior pot, one of the most important metrics to track is stablecoin flows. And that's not coming up. Like if you look at the aggregate inflation of tokens coming live with the unlocks, I think there's a great website like unlocks or something like that, that tracks all the unlocks. Token unlocks, yeah, I think they track the aggregate number of unlocks happening like call it per month, per week. And I think the, yeah, let's go to that. So these are presumably the major ones that captures most of them, right.
00:22:10.472 - 00:22:35.310, Speaker B: So in the next seven days you have 200 million of unlocks, linear unlocks per day, 50 million. So now I think what you overlay, again, one of your analysts should run this is that and new flows coming in. So look at new stable coin supply growth. Like the rate of change in supplies.
00:22:35.730 - 00:22:40.642, Speaker A: It's like you're getting at inflows. Is it greater than the, if it's.
00:22:40.666 - 00:23:07.162, Speaker B: Greater, bid all this stuff. If it's not, don't like Algo do this, you know, I mean, you'll know when to bid a lot of this stuff when the stablecoin rate of change vastly exceeds the unlock that needs to be absorbed by the market. Yeah, that's it. I mean, there's no. And that's where I think. I think that's what Kobe's getting at. I think that's what Kane's getting at.
00:23:07.162 - 00:23:22.436, Speaker B: I think that's my view as well. It's like the cycle kind of really hasn't started. We call it a cycle because obviously, like Solana said, a vast, like, in bitcoin, there's been discrete catalysts that are, like, suggested it's a cycle, right? But as a whole, it's not.
00:23:22.588 - 00:23:48.870, Speaker A: So maybe. Let me show you this. So if we pull up the. Let's pull up the bitcoin chart. So I think the interesting thing to look at on bitcoin is actually to go back to 2019, right? So there's two arguments for this cycle. One is, hey, look, we're actually probably like late 2019, early 2020. Maybe this moment, the other day over the weekend was like a March 2020 type of momentous, um, and, like, we're the start.
00:23:48.870 - 00:24:19.240, Speaker A: The cycle is just starting. The other argument is, um, we're maybe like halfway through the cycle. This was like, I don't know, consolidation before the, you know, the second stage of the cycle begins. So if you look at 2019 here, right, we. It, you know, bitcoin fell down to like 3000, came up to 12,000, and then went right back down to 4000 over the next couple months. Obviously, with the 4000 being march, what was that, 12th? I think it was of 2020. And if you pull up.
00:24:19.240 - 00:24:22.780, Speaker A: Did you read Coby's tweet? This one?
00:24:24.800 - 00:24:26.744, Speaker B: Yeah. Leave it there for folks to read.
00:24:26.832 - 00:24:42.322, Speaker A: Yeah. So I can read it for anyone who's not watching on YouTube. But someone tweets out, he said, honestly, the cycle is just starting. Kobe goes unironically. Cycle has not even started yet. Someone goes, people think you are serious, Lowell. He goes, I am serious.
00:24:42.322 - 00:25:15.810, Speaker A: Increasingly, I like the argument that this is not even a cycle, really, but it's more like 2019 with leverage and ETF's. Was 2019 a new cycle or was it part of the bear market? Floated this idea to a few people in March, but everyone told me I was an idiot, which I am. But still, it was quite rude to say that to my face. Of course, if we're in 2019 looking 2024, it doesn't mean that 2020 plays out the same way because structurally so much is different now with the ETF's high fdvs, probably too difficult to pattern match. Too much stuff about the future. So, I mean, I have thoughts on this, but I'm curious to maybe. Maybe you wanna.
00:25:15.810 - 00:25:17.570, Speaker A: What do you think about it?
00:25:23.590 - 00:25:28.050, Speaker B: Yeah. I don't know. Like, I wanna believe it. I think.
00:25:33.400 - 00:26:09.620, Speaker A: This is the question. What Kobe is saying right now is the people get so fixated on the cycle. I think the reason why it's almost tough to answer this question is because what constitutes a cycle? And was 2023 a bull or not? Well, bitcoin went from, like, 16,000 to 45,000. Right. It was up to three x. Bitcoin in 2019 was up four x before it tanked again. So, like, is that a mini bull? Was that a forex inside of a bear? And that's, I think, why that question can be hard.
00:26:11.360 - 00:26:41.530, Speaker B: These things are easier to package up into nice narratives after the fact. But let's just imagine if you're there in 2019 and you see bitcoin do a forex, and then it goes down to four 4000 and then it rips again to what? Pull up that chart again. So, like, from. From that 2019 moment that people keep referencing, you know, that's 2019. You go. You go from. From three to twelve, right? Give or take.
00:26:41.530 - 00:26:43.614, Speaker B: So that's forex.
00:26:43.742 - 00:26:44.570, Speaker A: Mm hmm.
00:26:44.870 - 00:26:54.180, Speaker B: And then you go down to what you're saying. Sure. Let me ask you a question. Do you use log? Are you seeing in a log scale?
00:26:55.400 - 00:26:59.120, Speaker A: I don't know what I'm looking at here. I think I just moved into the.
00:26:59.160 - 00:27:04.140, Speaker B: Crypto charts, by the way. Should always be looked at on a logarithmic scale to not scare the shit out.
00:27:05.000 - 00:27:07.080, Speaker A: I was like, what day, what week am I on?
00:27:07.120 - 00:27:09.980, Speaker B: Yeah, there we go. So it goes from three to twelve.
00:27:10.320 - 00:27:11.700, Speaker A: Yeah, there it is.
00:27:12.640 - 00:27:14.180, Speaker B: And then down to four.
00:27:15.290 - 00:27:15.690, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:27:15.730 - 00:27:32.058, Speaker B: And then in a matter of kind of 2020, in a matter of a year and change, you go, boom, to 60,000. I remember that. That was just bananas. I mean, that. Especially that second half, like November. Was it?
00:27:32.154 - 00:27:32.738, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:27:32.874 - 00:27:40.306, Speaker B: Q three, Q four. I mean, my God, it just went from five to. It did a ten x more.
00:27:40.338 - 00:27:51.020, Speaker A: We published a podcast on Empire with Dan held saying, the super cycle is here. Bitcoin could go to 400,000. To give you a sense of where people's minds were at.
00:27:51.100 - 00:28:33.558, Speaker B: Okay, let's throw away the years and thinking. Let's just think about flows, right? This is the. A lot of the discussion that I had with Cain, and I've had it with David and Pranav, which, by the way, we should have on. We should have David and Pranav is defi Summer or even in this moment, right. The market gives you plenty of time to scale into a trade with momentum, and you had it in defi summer. You didn't have to be early as we were in parafi. You didn't have to invest in Defi before.
00:28:33.558 - 00:29:25.260, Speaker B: Defi was a thing and buy, lend and maker and synthetix at the absolute bottom to have made substantial outperformance and just absolute return. You could have waited for compound to launch liquidity mining. You could have waited even months after compound launch liquidity mining. A month or two, you had yearn, you had a bunch of things. You had all these farms Uniswap, like, so many things, right, to. And it was like a window of three months or a month, depends, right? But it's multiple weeks where the market is telling you, like, there's a shift in the narrative, there's a shift in the paradigm, and it's very reflexive, like, you're seeing bitcoin here from five to 60. Ethereum did something similar.
00:29:25.260 - 00:29:46.930, Speaker B: Solana has done that to a certain extent. Right? I mean, it did. Went from eight to, like, 185 now. Right. So I think we should probably stop thinking about. I don't want to go as far as saying, I guess, like, we should stop thinking about crypto as a whole. Like just one bucket.
00:29:46.930 - 00:30:32.800, Speaker B: The more it grows, the more it warrants just bifurcation. But I don't want to be. I think that's a bit naive. I think ultimately, a lot of it does depend on what bitcoin does and then what the rest of the, you know, space does. But increasingly so each cycle, more and more, you have these pockets of just outperformance, like it has been with Solana and, you know, memes this cycle. But I guess the more important thing is, so, like, over the weekend, where Berkshire announced, like, it was Saturday, where Berkshire announced, like, they had sold a lot of their apple, I woke up and I was like, oh, I know how this is going to look immediately. Obviously, the crypto markets respond.
00:30:32.800 - 00:31:29.700, Speaker B: I get on the phone with a bunch of folks, including Dave, including Pranav and a bunch of others, and I was like, all right, what do you guys think? And stuff like that. My conclusion was, I'd rather hold a little bit more cash because I want to be in a position of mental clarity, strength and liquidity, to be able to bid that post, to be able to bid that Q three, Q four of 2021. Psychologically, let's run what's going through your head. You were 2019, you're in crypto, you're looking at bitcoin and all of a sudden it goes from four to twelve in your face. You may have bought it at twelve because you're like, shit, it's going to 400. Like, I got to get on the bus. You buy a twelve, it goes to four.
00:31:29.700 - 00:32:07.210, Speaker B: You may have sold at some point or you're scared shit and you're like, ugh. And then you're too scarred mentally. You may have not, may or may not have just allocated all of your bag and you're just fully allocated at that point and that's okay. Maybe you sold, maybe you didn't. Likely you sold at some point, right? And then it does that in your face, then it rips from four to 60 and you miss that because you're too clouded, you're too exposed. Right. My argument around that is that most people didn't have enough cash as a percentage of their portfolio in that period.
00:32:07.210 - 00:32:52.980, Speaker B: And I think there's a couple of ways to go about it. Right. If you're fully just, I'm talking about like funds, right? Um, but even like retail investors, maybe more. So I've come to the conclusion that it, the way you want to play these cycles is like, I feel comfortable, and I'll say it again and again, I feel comfortable not timing the bottom. I feel comfortable capturing at best, 50, 60% of the apps, the return of the cycle and that underperformance, so to speak, that not capturing the absolute return, that's four to 50 kind of thing is predicated on a couple of things. One, I'm never going to time the market to. Trying to time the market is a fool's errand.
00:32:52.980 - 00:33:10.302, Speaker B: It's going to distract me from other things. Three, it's going to put me in an uncomfortable position because if I'm all fully invested, I'm not having any cash, I can't buy the dips. So you go back to the analysis that your analyst did. It pays to buy the dips. If you don't have any cash, good luck. Great analysis. No cash.
00:33:10.302 - 00:33:39.642, Speaker B: Most people never have cash to buy the dips. Um, and, and so I think, like, I've just come to that conclusion where it's very difficult to hold cash, especially when every, when stuff is ripping. But I think you take comfort in the fact that you're going to have plenty of time, couple of weeks to really scale another trade. The question is, we had a huge shakeout on Monday, but I'm still. Yeah, okay. You're supposed to like, you know, bid at that point. But I don't know.
00:33:39.642 - 00:33:59.026, Speaker B: Like, I don't feel. I'm not seeing it with absolute clarity. I basically think, to Kobe's point, we're, like, in that choppy period of 2019, you know? Yeah. And it's fine. You could just, like, cost average your way in, no problem. Maybe that's what you're supposed to.
00:33:59.178 - 00:33:59.990, Speaker A: You mean.
00:34:02.090 - 00:34:09.374, Speaker B: It was. And by the way, those are big moves. Movements, right? It's like four to ten, four to seven, four to eight. Like, those are big, big movements.
00:34:09.502 - 00:34:27.622, Speaker A: I remember the 2019 movement up. This was the Binance IEo bull run. Remember that? All those binance ieos. I remember thinking, this can't actually be happening. This isn't real. Because 2018 and 2019 felt so long. Like, that was my mentality then.
00:34:27.622 - 00:34:38.480, Speaker A: Okay, so I have a question for you. Why you're saying that you're timing the market by trading in and out of this stuff, but then you're also telling me you're not trying to time the market.
00:34:38.560 - 00:34:49.220, Speaker B: No, no, no, I'm not. I'm not necessarily. I'm not necessarily moving in and out of this stuff. I am just increasing my cash allocation.
00:34:51.440 - 00:34:53.912, Speaker A: But where do you get this? Where do you get the new cash from?
00:34:54.016 - 00:34:55.220, Speaker B: Oh, from outside.
00:34:56.170 - 00:34:59.210, Speaker A: Oh, well, sir, we don't all have. Well, outside.
00:34:59.330 - 00:35:06.034, Speaker B: No, no, no. Like, I'm selling. No, no. What I'm telling you is I sold some over the weekend and Monday some.
00:35:06.162 - 00:35:08.150, Speaker A: But isn't that timing the market?
00:35:10.450 - 00:35:50.486, Speaker B: I don't know. Like, I mean, I'm not trying to. You could argue it's timing the market. I'm doing it more so to have. And I, and I credit Pranav to helping me come to this realization. I'm doing it to psychologically be in a better spot and feel good and strong about bidding in that low moment. Now, I don't know, like, I don't know if we go down more from here, its always certainly possible.
00:35:50.486 - 00:36:31.494, Speaker B: So if you factor that in, I just said differently. I think if when the cash balance goes, the percentage of cash in the portfolio goes low and it goes to a threshold where its uncomfortably low, I am more likely to do dumb shit. Im more likely to be shaken out. Im more likely to think about it annoyingly, and it's distracting. And as soon as it's above a certain threshold, I feel good. And I'm not talking about just x outside of the portfolio. It's outside of crypto.
00:36:31.494 - 00:37:00.838, Speaker B: I'm just within crypto. I just think that within crypto, imagine yourself as a fund manager that you're paid. That's what I'm trying to convey here. It's like because a retail investor is different or my position is different because I don't have a fund, it's just my capital. But if you're a fund and you are investing in these markets, I think very few funds have some cash. They're all always fully allocated. But I don't know.
00:37:00.838 - 00:37:07.276, Speaker B: Go listen to the episode in David, and I think it just, I don't know. I feel like you should, to some.
00:37:07.308 - 00:37:09.300, Speaker A: Extent have some cash, you're saying?
00:37:09.340 - 00:37:18.680, Speaker B: Yeah, hold some cash. And I think some of the best investors always have pretty high cash balance.
00:37:19.260 - 00:37:53.956, Speaker A: Hey, everyone. Jason here. I wanted to talk about something that's been on my mind a lot recently, and that is, where are all of Crypto's killer apps? We often ask this question on the show. So I'm excited to tell you about Empire's latest partner, Anoma, the universal intent machine. Intents are a new way to build dapps, enabling users to say what they want without needing to specify how it's done. Let's say you have an NFT on one chain, but you want to swap it for a token on another chain. To make things even worse, you also don't know which bridge to trust or how to navigate different dexes on each chain.
00:37:53.956 - 00:38:18.020, Speaker A: Disaster, right? But here's the good news. Thanks to intents, you can just tell the app what you want to do, and Enomas solver network takes care of all the complexity in the background. We're excited to see what cool dapps Anoma's architecture will unlock to stay up to date with Anoma. You can follow them@x.com anoma or sign up for the newsletter@anoma.net dot. Special thanks to Anoma for sponsoring today's episode.
00:38:18.020 - 00:39:17.984, Speaker A: Hey, everyone, I wanted to take a second to talk about Real, a permissionless l two for tokenized real world assets on arbitrum orbit. What's really cool about real is that it uses the off chain yields from RWAs as a sustainable solution for native liquidity incentives. Real is also the first L two, where 100% of profits from transaction fees and fees from protocols accrue back to the L two's governance token. RWA Real has just launched their rewards program, where 10% of the RWA supply is being given away to early users of the chain. Users can provide concentrated liquidity, trade, borrow and leverage tokenized real world assets, including t bills, real estate and tokenized basis trades. Just as a quick disclaimer, this is not investment advice or product solicitation and not aimed at us persons. Find out more at Re Al Rewards special thanks to real for sponsoring today's episode.

00:40:09.014 - 00:40:42.220, Speaker A: Everything that Avalanche has been building the last few years has culminated in this moment where today you have institutions and developers able to essentially have limitless possibilities with the chain. They've enabled developers to build cross chain swaps or create gaming environments where one subnet can unlock features in another or can use USDC as a native gas token. Onyx, for example, by JPMorgan or Citi or DTCC's digital assets, or the Australia New Zealand Banking Group. They're all building on Avalanche. Evergreen subnets. Really cool stuff. Big thanks to avalanche for sponsoring this episode of Empire.

If you had $100 that you were wanting to put into crypto at some point in the next couple of years, how much of those hundred dollars are sitting in cash and how much are in crypto?
00:41:02.840 - 00:41:15.930, Speaker B: Well, like within the crypto portfolio, because I invest in other stuff. Right? Like the whole link company if you like. You know, like it's. Wait.
00:41:16.230 - 00:41:17.010, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:41:17.310 - 00:41:42.390, Speaker B: Hey, well, Pranav, I'm talking about you. I'm trying to replicate. I'm trying to recreate the conversation we had over the weekend and I'm. And I'm. And I'm basically going through the exercise of if holding a little bit more like no one holds cash. And I'm positioning myself in a mindset of a fund manager, not me or retail investor. It's like it pays to have cash.
00:41:42.390 - 00:42:09.320, Speaker B: Not necessary because you're trying to time the market. Because psychologically, you know, we're going back to like the market gives you plenty of time to, to scale into a trade once the pair, once the momentum shifts, even if you're not timing the bottom, if you get comfortable not timing the bottom and capturing maybe 50% of the move up, it feels good to have cash because you're going to be, just psychologically, for me at least, have more clarity. And this is kind of the conversation that we had over the weekend, right?
00:42:09.440 - 00:42:53.612, Speaker C: Yeah. Well, I think right now it's kind of a little bit of a tricky situation in the market where the question is like, yes, you do want to have cash at some point so you can play offense when nobody else can play offense. That's the obvious reason. Right. But do you, when do you raise the cash? Is the question. Do you raise it? Sort of. If you think you're 70% way through a drawdown, do you try to raise it then for to the remaining 30% you can capture at the lows, or do you wait to see how things play out? Because I think time and time and again, what we've seen, I think we saw it a little bit of this, this week as well, is the market seems to panic very quickly, and the central bankers respond very quickly as well to deal with that panic.
00:42:53.612 - 00:43:26.840, Speaker C: Because right now, again, I don't want to make this a macro conversation, but where I think the central bankers are is we probably solved this inflation problem. Now we want to land the plane and we don't want to have a hard landing. So they're in this mode of potentially panicking too quickly and easing too early because they want to avoid that. So anyways, my view is it seems like we're range bound for a while. And if you think that, then you probably want to raise cash at the higher end of the range, then sort of 70% way through the range.
00:43:28.240 - 00:43:51.872, Speaker A: Pranav, how do you think about, though? Like, at some point you break out of a range, right? So you top down, top down. You're ranging, ranging, ranging. At some point it hits the top and then it just kind of breaks through. Right. So for people who are trying to, you know, it's bouncing between 50 and 60, let's call it, and you're selling at 60 and you're buying more at 50, and you're selling at 60 and you're buying more at 50, and then sometimes at some point it breaks past 60. So how do you think about, then you're caught on the other side of that.
00:43:51.976 - 00:44:26.998, Speaker C: Yep. So I sort of, in my brain, separate the market into two environments. Environment. One is own good assets and focus in the medium to long term, don't try to be tactical. And environment two is try to be tactical. And I think in the first half of this year, our view was, let's be tactical. For all of last year, we were like, own good assets and just play it out right, because we started our strategy mid June 2022, where the entire world was falling apart in crypto, and all you had to do is own the winners and survivors, and you probably did okay on their side.
00:44:26.998 - 00:45:32.772, Speaker C: Coming into this year, everything had done extremely well, and you could see the obvious kind of frothiness in the market. That's when we were like, you know what? We should probably be tactical, because everyone is. You're seeing just stupid things happening where, like, you have a new token launching every week, and there's a new points program for something, and there's just too much supply vaults and all these things happening, and you're like, all right, I want to be tactical here because everyone is feeling very trigger happy, and everyone's risk appetite is very high. I think around May, things started to change, which was you had, obviously, candidate Trump coming out supporting this asset class, and then you saw this light at the end of the tunnel for the entire space, which is if you can get the regulatory landscape to fix itself, then more people will use crypto products for simplicity, say, stable coins, and at the same time, more people have the ability or air cover to allocate to tokens allocated the token market. So if you solve those two things, that's a big enough catalyst where you're like, you know what? I don't want to be too tactical and too cute here. I can just focus on medium to long term, and that's kind of when we shifted our mindset. So we're not being tactical at this moment.
00:45:32.772 - 00:45:35.320, Speaker C: We're just kind of focusing on the medium to long term.
00:45:37.060 - 00:46:09.264, Speaker B: Okay, Yano, something you said around, and then it moves up. All of a sudden, we're under this impression that you have to constantly be in the market and playing every hand the dealer is dealing, because it's gonna up from one day to the other. Bitcoin is gonna be at Cathy Wood prognosis, which is, you know, we're gonna wake up one day and bitcoin be 250,000. No, the reality is you felt it right now. Like, you're sitting there and, like, Solana is ripping in your face. Yeah, and you had, by the way, you didn't get it at eight. You could have gotten 16.
00:46:09.264 - 00:46:35.166, Speaker B: You get 16, you could have gotten 50, you could have gotten 60 7100 and yep, you felt late at all of those points because most people psychologically feel late. So the argument, I guess, to counter my position of like, holding cash is that if you're not invested, you're perhaps more likely to be paralyzed because you hate. Not everyone loves to time and is obsessed with timing. The bottom.
00:46:35.318 - 00:46:35.718, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:46:35.774 - 00:47:06.860, Speaker B: And again, the most important realization shift for me this cycle is, and maybe the capital base is different and that's why I kind of operate like this is I'm not looking to capture more than 50, maybe 60% of the absolute return that this cycle is going to deliver. And that encompasses many things. Having a little bit more cash, not going off too much in the risk spectrum, you know, DC ing in and out. Like these are kind of things that. But of course it's. It's difficult. Even though like you write it down, you have it like seared in your brain.
00:47:06.860 - 00:47:19.078, Speaker B: It's when people are making more money than you, it's like, I'm not capturing maybe, maybe bitcoin actually goes to 400,000 this cycle, as Dan said in 2019. Maybe. Who knows? Anything's possible. Preston?
00:47:19.094 - 00:47:40.508, Speaker A: I don't know. I just feel like I'm so far on the left, left side of the curve from you guys because like, my strategy is honestly just, I sit here and bitcoin goes down and I just don't really do anything. And if I have some extra cash from like my block work salary, I'll buy some more bitcoin. And if bitcoin goes up, I'm not trying to sell it. I'm not thinking we're range bound. I'm not trying to sell to then go buy lower. Like, I'm just sitting not.
00:47:40.564 - 00:47:44.244, Speaker B: This is like the meme that Shelley had, which is buy said, forget, just come back.
00:47:44.332 - 00:47:50.516, Speaker A: Yeah. And I just listened to you guys because you guys are such brilliant minds at this. I'm just like, I don't know my.
00:47:50.628 - 00:48:12.148, Speaker C: Yeah, I think. I think in most times that's probably the best approach. But you do need to avoid the 2022 90% drawdown events as much as possible. Right. And you never know. It's hard to call those things. So every now and then when things look like theres poor asymmetry, from a risk reward standpoint, it always helps to raise cash.
00:48:12.148 - 00:48:38.560, Speaker C: Wed felt like that April of this year, which is March April this year, where you could just see the frothiness. Funding rates were through the roof. There were days where bitcoin funding was like 40 something percent. Alts were also having a very high funding environment. Open interest had gone up a lot and people were making money too quickly. And everything felt so amazing. You're like, well, this party's not going to last for a long time.
00:48:38.560 - 00:49:04.790, Speaker C: And there's not real clarity on a lot of the regulatory things. So it just feels like a better moment to have some cash versus now, I think there's regulatory clarity. Look, I mean, I was looking at this yesterday, the amount of open interest we've wiped out in bitcoin, eth as well as alts. We're back to November of last year levels. So you've taken out all the excess in this market.
00:49:05.370 - 00:49:53.730, Speaker A: Let me ask you guys about this presidential election and how you think, how you trade around it. So I've heard there's a lot of conversation on Twitter this week, which is poly market polls showed Kamala, I think, overtaking Trump at one point this week, it looks like I pulled it up. Now Trump is at 50%, Harris is at 49%. But I don't know, does that factor into, I guess there's two questions, like, how do you think about doing that on a very short term basis? The longer term question is like, do you? I guess Santia and I have talked about this, Pranav, how much do you think this really makes an impact on longing crypto versus not longing crypto? If it looks like Harris is winning, are you going cash? And if it looks like Trump is winning, your lever longing soul right now, how do you think about this?
00:49:56.040 - 00:50:49.008, Speaker C: Were not trading the election that way at all because things are so hard to predict. And it's also investors aren't giving us capital to trade election outcomes necessarily. But I will say this, which is interesting. We subscribe to this investor survey where all these institutional managers, like ourselves, basically answer a whole bunch of questions and then they send out the survey results every month to us. So im not going to this companys in stealth, so im not going to call their name out there. But there was a question that was asked, which is how much do you expect the market to move and how upon the election and all these managers, with an aggregate amount of $3 billion of capital, its 44 managers, I believe, said that they expect the market to go up between ten to 30% in crypto if Trump wins and the market to go down ten to 30% if Kamala loses. Thats market psychology right now, as Trumps moved up or moved down in the polls, markets have drifted down.
00:50:49.008 - 00:51:33.050, Speaker C: So I think if you can chart Trump odds on polymarket along with, let's just say, the price of bitcoin or whatever. Alt there's probably a high correlation there in the last 30 days. So I generally think to the extent Kamala Harris pivots on her views on crypto, then you're removing this left tail that people perceive. People perceive the market as right now. So if you can remove that tail from the market, then you could have a pretty nice environment between now and election. Now, post election, then the question is, like, who can execute on regulatory clarity faster? Right? So Trump's kind of promised you first hundred days, crypto council pass some legislation. So that seems to be a faster path versus the common path right now.
00:51:33.050 - 00:51:51.500, Speaker C: Seems to be, you know, litigation with coin based finance get outcomes. Maybe that goes to the Supreme Court one day and we'll get an outcome from there. That's the path. If you can maybe change that path to some legislation, maybe it'll still take more time with common law, that's still good. But there's one that's better for the market than the other.
00:51:55.080 - 00:52:08.816, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm not trading it either. I think I tweeted about this yesterday. There's too much focus on predicted or polymarket odds, which, by the way, they've peaked. They've peaked for Trump. It will not go as higher than what, the day after the assessment?
00:52:08.848 - 00:52:09.576, Speaker A: 100%.
00:52:09.728 - 00:52:41.890, Speaker B: No surprise, right? I still think he wins. But again, I would agree with Pranap. Very difficult to predict. Nate Silver hasn't gotten it right after he got it right. He's a one trick pony. And so I think the more important question is, we weren't even talking about Trump and a presidential candidate being super pro crypto and the market was rallying substantially, like in November. No one was talking about this.
00:52:41.890 - 00:53:17.000, Speaker B: It wasn't an issue. And I think sometimes in crypto, we tend to anchor too much and place too much weight on certain things. And my thesis is, it doesn't really change much if you zoom out and go farther than twelve months on the margin, but it doesn't invalidate the entire cycle. I think you have. The Chevron case is probably something that people have completely forgotten about. This idea that administrative overreach is peeled back. And so that's huge.
00:53:17.000 - 00:54:00.010, Speaker B: And you're seeing courts rule in crypto favor bitwise grayscale, not bit wise. It was grayscale Coinbase ripple yesterday. So, like, that's very positive. How much emphasis do you place on that? Pranav, you said earlier? I think the regular, we talk too much about government is what I'm trying to say. And that is gonna. It only goes down from here if Trump odds only go down from after the assassination. The regulatory fierceness, the intensity that we felt in this industry is only going down that is positive for the space.
00:54:00.010 - 00:54:19.614, Speaker B: And just this idea that it's like, in the conversation in the US, I think, also helps so many other countries, so many other regulators that are observing this and saying, okay, yeah, clearly it's a thing. It's an asset class, right? In Brazil, you have a sole ETF, right? Yeah.
00:54:19.742 - 00:54:57.538, Speaker C: Well, let me ask you a question. You guys see this a lot. I'll tell you my bias, and I'll be curious what you think. I believe that the best builders in crypto are yet to come. I think the ratio of, let's just say, mediocre founders to high quality founders in crypto is very different than what it is in web two. And I think some of those I talked to, there are a bunch of investors in my strategy that also invest in tradfi or web two stuff like AI funds and all these things. One of the things they tell me is some of the best AI builders don't want to touch the space because of, like, all the regulatory headaches.
00:54:57.538 - 00:55:09.990, Speaker C: But if things were cleaned up, then they might do, they might leverage stable coins, for example. So I feel like the best builders are yet to come. And I think cleaning up the regulatory means those people will just leverage the tools crypto has to offer.
00:55:11.650 - 00:55:44.198, Speaker A: I would agree with that. I would also push back a little. So, Santi, I agree with your take on we peaked in terms of how much people think that politics matters for crypto. I would say, and, like, Trump's odds and all that, that kind of stuff. But I do think, I mean, there are some big decisions, but I think peaked is how much the president, how much the president will impact crypto. But what does matter that I don't really hear anyone talking about is, like, right now, there's a big decision between, like, Gina Raimondo and what's that other guy's name? Wally. Wally Adamo for treasury secretary.
00:55:44.198 - 00:55:54.506, Speaker A: Like that. That does matter. And also, like, the SEC chair. Like, it's probably either going to be like, Gensler is 100% out, in my opinion. Like, Gensler, no matter damn, or republican.
00:55:54.538 - 00:55:56.826, Speaker B: Like, and that's, like, the most important.
00:55:56.938 - 00:56:07.986, Speaker A: Gensler's out. But it's either gonna be caroline Crenshaw or Hester or, like, someone like Hester Pierce. Like Hester Pierce. Amazing, actually. Hester Pierce, probably it's Ryan. Yeah, maybe Celkis gets it. But, like.
00:56:07.986 - 00:56:19.122, Speaker A: Like, Crent like, Crenshaw arguably would be even worse than Gensler. Even worse. Which I know seems crazy, but what, again? Again, we're winning in the courts is.
00:56:19.146 - 00:56:21.618, Speaker B: The other bluff you call, and we're.
00:56:21.634 - 00:56:22.346, Speaker A: Winning in the courts.
00:56:22.378 - 00:56:24.934, Speaker B: And so, like you, that's the most important thing.
00:56:25.062 - 00:56:30.130, Speaker A: I. Look, I'm agreeing with you. I'm agreeing with you. I think that, like, I hate talking about government.
00:56:30.470 - 00:56:32.718, Speaker B: My dad reminded me, we talked much about government.
00:56:32.814 - 00:56:34.610, Speaker A: He was like, big government guy.
00:56:34.910 - 00:56:40.166, Speaker B: No, like, well, like, my. My grandfather was secretary of state. Just doesn't decide. No flex.
00:56:40.238 - 00:56:42.110, Speaker A: In what country?
00:56:42.230 - 00:56:58.256, Speaker B: In Mexico, no flex. But, like, I just think my. My dad actually reminded me this the other day. He's like, back in the day, we wouldn't talk about government the way that we talk about it now. It's all the time, constantly.
00:56:58.288 - 00:56:58.384, Speaker C: It's.
00:56:58.392 - 00:57:07.488, Speaker B: A good. Government is invisible. And we should just. I don't know. It gets tiring. But I hear you on the margin. Yes.
00:57:07.488 - 00:57:27.070, Speaker B: I don't think it invalidates. We've had all of these cycles that we're talking about. 20 19, 20 23, 20 17 in a, you know, pretty adversarial regulatory environment. So it only gets better from here, irrespective of who wins in the US.
00:57:28.410 - 00:57:31.150, Speaker A: What, um. Why was jump selling for enough.
00:57:33.610 - 00:57:35.162, Speaker B: Trillion dollar question.
00:57:35.346 - 00:57:45.960, Speaker C: I wish I knew. I've obviously read all the Twitter threads people have been posting. One of them is one of your blockworks guys, Jonah, who seems to, like, have the answer to everything.
00:57:46.500 - 00:57:47.964, Speaker B: The thousand x guy.
00:57:48.132 - 00:57:49.040, Speaker A: What's that?
00:57:50.420 - 00:57:51.200, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:57:52.820 - 00:58:17.278, Speaker C: Honestly, I don't know. I have. Like, we can speculate. One is like, maybe they saw the unwinds from Japan coming. Like, the amount of carry trade unwinds and they wanted to get ahead of it on Sunday because it was, like, so ridiculous that someone selling on a Sunday. Right. Like, when everyone knows if you're, like, somewhat marginally sophisticated, you don't try to move size on, like, a low liquidity day.
00:58:17.278 - 00:58:22.290, Speaker C: So they were doing that on chain, and at least people thought they were moving Ethan chain. That meant they were going to sell.
00:58:24.030 - 00:58:24.318, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:58:24.334 - 00:58:25.650, Speaker C: I don't know. What do you guys think?
00:58:27.470 - 00:58:33.956, Speaker A: I've. No, I'm. I'm asking you guys because you're the smartest, smarter than me. So that's why I asked you. Ask the questions. Yeah, I don't know.
00:58:34.078 - 00:58:47.168, Speaker B: It's the unknowns that marginally worry me a bit. I'm like, I don't want to read too much into it. This is when the Adams come out with the mega threads of. This is an FTX type of event.
00:58:47.224 - 00:58:54.540, Speaker A: I messaged Santi Vinny Lingam's tweet and said, I've got a sneaky suspicion that something, aka three arrows or an FTX broke over the weekend.
00:58:54.880 - 00:58:56.816, Speaker C: I know, Winnie. Do you want me to invite him to this?
00:58:56.968 - 00:59:16.890, Speaker A: Vinny this morning, I've not messaged him. Well, here's what he said. I think it's fine to share. I said, what's good with this? He said, yeah, it's really not about jump. It's someone that forced jump to do what they did. I said, big hedge fund got on the wrong side of a trade question mark. He said, yeah, ETF linked, possibly something like that.
00:59:16.890 - 00:59:22.430, Speaker A: So that's what I'm like. Is there something here or is this just fun for a good tweet?
00:59:23.170 - 00:59:37.242, Speaker C: But also, we generally know who the big market makers are in the space. I haven't come across jump in a long time. From a market maker perspective, I didn't realize they were like, you know what I mean? Like, I thought they were kind of out of business.
00:59:37.386 - 00:59:39.562, Speaker B: By the way, jump.
00:59:39.586 - 00:59:39.818, Speaker C: Crypto.
00:59:39.834 - 00:59:50.034, Speaker B: There is. Okay. Are there systemic actors right now in crypto other than Coinbase and binance? It's not them. I think.
00:59:50.202 - 00:59:50.910, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:59:51.250 - 01:00:07.306, Speaker B: Like, like, I don't know, Holly. It would be theme unless, like. But no, like, so, like, okay, maybe a hedge fund blew up. Okay. But I don't know, it's, it's nonetheless, it's. The point still stands. It's.
01:00:07.306 - 01:00:14.410, Speaker B: It's quite odd that they decided to do this in August on a, on a Sunday, like pick the worst moment in time to.
01:00:14.530 - 01:00:41.210, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, look, they have a big market making business in the tradfi side, and a lot of people in Tradfi were worried about what happened on Monday, on Friday. Right. Because of the move that you had seen in the yen and all the unwinds, you'd start to see. So they might have had the right call because their tribe five business see something that crypto people like us aren't seeing yet.
01:00:42.030 - 01:01:06.520, Speaker B: Yeah, that's probably the more I have heard of other threads, like outside of crypto. It's like cautioning around the rebound and saying, hey, there might be another leg down. Yeah. People have unwound some of the positions, but we don't really know. Maybe there's just some carcasses there that are going to surface at some point.
01:01:07.900 - 01:01:14.120, Speaker C: I think. Was it JP Morgan put out something saying they thought that 75% of the unwind was done?
01:01:14.650 - 01:01:16.670, Speaker B: Yes. Yes. Yeah.
01:01:18.610 - 01:01:35.338, Speaker C: I mean, the question for me is like, okay, everyone knows about this yen carry trade at this point. But if you remember, even in crypto when that SdE peg broke a couple of years ago, the question was like, what are the next pegs to break? Actually, it was luna that broke and then that had people go after that SDE peg.
01:01:35.434 - 01:01:36.710, Speaker B: So it's like the question is.
01:01:37.250 - 01:01:47.384, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, that's right. So the question is like, what are the other carry trades in this market that are very big, that are at risk? And the one people always talk about is the cash futures basis trade on.
01:01:47.432 - 01:01:49.760, Speaker B: Like Athena US treasuries. Oh yeah.
01:01:49.800 - 01:01:53.032, Speaker C: Oh, you're talking about crypto. Yeah, I'm talking about just trad five markets.
01:01:53.096 - 01:02:11.238, Speaker B: People are markets. Yeah, there's a. I don't, I have no insight here. It was Salini who tweeted about the low liquidity in the treasury's market, especially. I don't know if you paid attention to that or what you read into that. Like, it's just like basically I was a bond trader.
01:02:11.384 - 01:02:11.754, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:02:11.802 - 01:02:35.470, Speaker B: And I felt like way back, like I think it was, he referenced 2021, like pre Covid, like it was like low liquidity. Now he said, I can't imagine, like it's much, much worse. I don't know what to read into that. He basically was, I think it was something along the lines of no one is really bidding like longer paper. And so that's a signal in and of itself around like a hard landing.
01:02:37.020 - 01:02:52.692, Speaker C: So I know that people are concerned about these off the run treasuries, basically, not the latest issue ones, which is why the treasury is doing a buyback of all these things here. Ill put it in our chat because liquidity on these off the run treasuries are pretty thin. I dont know if thats what he said.
01:02:52.756 - 01:02:55.000, Speaker B: For listeners, whats the distinction?
01:02:56.500 - 01:03:24.090, Speaker C: On the run is the latest issue, one that everyone trades and off the run is something that was issued two years ago. For example, the 30 year that was issued this year is the 2054 maturity, the 2049 maturities. Like this 25 year. People say this is backdoor QE, which is if the treasury is buying bonds.
01:03:25.070 - 01:03:27.950, Speaker A: This treasury buyback program is backdoor QE.
01:03:28.070 - 01:03:28.770, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:03:30.510 - 01:03:34.646, Speaker B: Yeah. Any other concern?
01:03:34.718 - 01:03:35.334, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:03:35.502 - 01:04:02.190, Speaker A: By the way, I think this is an argument for pro stablecoin policy in the US is if like liquidity, my white, my wife's like uncle is like deep in the treasury market at CME or CFTC or something like, or I think CME. And the only argument, crypto argument that's ever made sense to him is stable coins being the buyer of last resort for these treasuries, saying the liquidity is drying up.
01:04:03.410 - 01:04:14.698, Speaker C: The only thing there. Yeah, the only thing there is like stable coins can't buy 2040, 2050 treasury. They had to buy t bills. Right. Like short duration. Because you can't have a Silicon Valley bank happen to a stable coin.
01:04:14.834 - 01:04:18.390, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Well, unless you're a tether, right. And you're using excess.
01:04:18.730 - 01:04:22.090, Speaker C: Oh, yeah. You can do whatever you want. The excess. Yeah. You can go buy bitcoin with your.
01:04:22.210 - 01:05:01.232, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. But listen, on your point around what's, what could break and some of the carry trades, defi for all, I mean, for what it worth, yet again, performed exceptionally well on Monday. And I know a lot of people paying attention to Athena in particular, as, you know, a project that might be a little more fragile. And it absorbed like, I think it was 190 million of redemptions or something like that. And so anyways, pretty time and time again. At the time, it was classic, like left, right, kind of meme picture. Traditional finance.
01:05:01.232 - 01:05:09.904, Speaker B: Like there's people lost access to. I think it was like eight brokerage accounts. Like interactive brokers, fidelity. It was like. It's like. Exactly. This is.
01:05:09.904 - 01:05:15.584, Speaker B: This is why Defi. Right? Yeah. So what do you think the leverages.
01:05:15.672 - 01:05:21.960, Speaker C: In this market, like, the hidden leverage, because we can all see the on chain stuff. Like, I don't think we have like another.
01:05:22.120 - 01:05:26.296, Speaker A: But who's lend, you know, lending. The lenders have had an idea.
01:05:26.328 - 01:05:36.782, Speaker B: Like, you don't have genesis anymore. Like, I want to build a genesis. And actually, if I. It was a great business. But you don't. I don't know. Maybe, you know, like, where would that come from?
01:05:36.966 - 01:05:54.878, Speaker C: I don't. That's what I'm saying. I don't think there is a conversation we're having over the weekend. Right. We're saying, let's put probabilities on. Let's just say crypto going 30% lower. Crypto going in this range, and then crypto going to 50% higher.
01:05:54.878 - 01:06:05.300, Speaker C: Those three things. When I think about those probabilities on the low end, I keep asking, like, what is the thing that drives it to that 25% lower outcome? And the best I can come up with is like a correlation. One, everything just goes down.
01:06:05.420 - 01:06:06.884, Speaker B: A macro. Yeah. Kind of thing.
01:06:07.012 - 01:06:10.428, Speaker C: Yeah, right. Yeah, correct. That's what I mean. Macro.
01:06:10.484 - 01:06:51.900, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, no, that's. Yeah, I agree. Again, I think the conclusion here is that we came over the weekend is if you look farther out than six months, nine months, twelve months. It is. I've yet to found compelling arguments to be bearish for a variety of reasons. Now, the perhaps more nuanced. Before you jumped on Pranav, we were looking at Yanu, if you want to pull it up, the ceteris tweet that you probably looked at, it was kind of going around circles of the vast, just like return dispersion and crypto as it has been in traditional markets.
01:06:51.900 - 01:07:00.648, Speaker B: Basically, if you didn't hold soul, BTC or memes, you kind of have, are flat or down for the year.
01:07:00.784 - 01:07:01.500, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:07:03.400 - 01:07:28.492, Speaker B: How do you think that looks like a year from now? So, yeah, let's pull it up. So I think you saw it, but here we go. Yeah. So you saw this, right? Basically it's, if you're not in whiff and soul and BTC, like good luck, you know what I mean? Or like how if. I don't know if you want to read. I mean, we discussed this kind of length at the beginning of the pod. But the more interesting question perhaps is if we're all saying same thing.
01:07:28.492 - 01:07:32.320, Speaker B: Okay, in twelve months from now, how does this chart look? How does this table look?
01:07:32.740 - 01:08:04.528, Speaker C: So I don't exactly know how this table looks, but I'll tell you how we think about this, and we've talked about Santi. So it might be repetitive to you, but two years ago, when I. Yeah, two years ago when I talked to people outside of our universe and it said you have crypto exposure, they say we own some bitcoin, we own some eth. And now you ask the same question. People often say we own some bitcoin, some meat, some soul and some coinbase. Like, that's kind of like your mag seven equivalent in crypto. All im trying to do is pick number five, six and seven on that list.
01:08:04.528 - 01:08:42.848, Speaker C: That will be the 5672 years from now. And I think in order for asset number, in order for things to become five, six and seven on that list, it has to be things that hundreds of millions of people will be using. And theyre very aware that theyre using those things. The reason you have Sol and Coinbase on the list is 100 million people kind of realize they're using this product and there's all these other things to it. So for us, we're always kind of trying to pick that asset number five, six and seven. And that has to be, again, something hundreds of millions of people are going to be touching. So when you look at like Coinmarketcap top 100, you can have a very elaborate thesis on some token.
01:08:42.848 - 01:08:58.209, Speaker C: But then I ultimately go back to asking will hundreds of millions of people be touching this product that this company or project or token is building a, and as a result become a top mind share grab for people in two years? And that's when that's going to drive all the returns.
01:08:59.469 - 01:09:05.941, Speaker B: Couldn't have said it better. That's why I'm so bullish on deep in, like, I just announced an investment this weekend. I don't know if you guys participated in that.
01:09:06.005 - 01:09:07.349, Speaker C: You know the team really well, they're great.
01:09:07.429 - 01:09:50.308, Speaker B: I do basically, like, like, he's been building like this, like, broadband Internet and like, you know, basically came to the conclusion that crypto was the next stage for them to, like, really scale it out and, yeah, it's those type of things. I agree with you that also just, I agree. L1 should be invisible to some extent, but it's hard to overlook the fact that most of the activity is happening in Solana. Most of the teams are even just today. Athena at support USDe is now available on Solana. One of the founders, Pac Moon, that is prominent. The blast ecosystem should not say prominent, but just in the blast ecosystem decided to go and leave to build on.
01:09:50.324 - 01:10:17.072, Speaker A: Solana and Ave. Did you see Ave? Mark? Mark Zeller. Look at this. Um, I don't think anything's been confirmed yet, but someone tweeted at, uh, uh, here, I'll share this tab. So, yeah, Zoomer Oracle said Ave of Solana sitting at 30 million market cap heading towards 10 billion. TvL launched in peak nuke city two months ago, second biggest TvL salon after judo. Mark Zeller, who's obviously big in the Aave game, said would be a shame if.
01:10:17.072 - 01:10:28.512, Speaker A: And then I saw this tweet from Chris Berniske said Camino to communal finance, basically the road to Camino finance. And Mark Zeller said, let's see how long they survive when we launch there.
01:10:28.576 - 01:10:32.980, Speaker B: So I think that Mark is just being Mark, look, I'm going to.
01:10:33.320 - 01:10:42.182, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, Mark is being marked, but he's also saying, I mean, I think that you don't. Unless. No, why wouldn't launch in Solana all.
01:10:42.206 - 01:10:48.654, Speaker B: The, it makes all the sense in the world. Right. I don't even remember when Lido, like, left Solana. Like things I don't understand.
01:10:48.702 - 01:10:51.134, Speaker A: Oh, opened it for Jito. I mean, that was the exact.
01:10:51.302 - 01:11:13.776, Speaker B: Yeah. So, look, I would not be surprised if they launch in Solana. Here's the thing, it will actually be really interesting to see how they perform and how much tbl they're able to, like, gather relative to Camino and margin five. Right. As like a proof point for teams outside of the Solana ecosystem. Because probably their mind is like, oh, maybe these guys are like very native. Like the Camino, the margin fight teams are like very Solana native.
01:11:13.776 - 01:11:28.568, Speaker B: But I've heard it from someone like Kane, like that. The Solana community has been very welcoming and I think it's sometimes a concern. It's like, oh, you know, I'm in a zero maxi now, like exploring, like going into Solana. But Solana community is like very welcoming.
01:11:28.744 - 01:12:18.786, Speaker C: So since we're talking about Solana and these dapps, I have a question for Higgs, followed what sanctum is doing, like with all these different lsts? No, it's essentially enabling the long tail of lsts and then they essentially have a curve like product where you can swap between these lsts with minimal slippage. Right. So it's like Jup sole and this box sole and all these things. And on the surface you're like, why do you need all these like long tail of lsts? It's kind of like the first reaction you'll have to this. But then I've been thinking about this one a lot, which is if you look at just the regular world, you have obviously 5000 public companies, I think, and you have hundreds of thousands of small businesses. The small businesses don't have their own stock that trades because the market doesn't have such an appetite for so many assets to include indices and own them and trade them. The market will never price you the right way if you're just a small business that's trying to have a listed stock.
01:12:18.786 - 01:13:06.856, Speaker C: Similarly, I'm thinking about this idea that do all dapps need a token? If you're a small dapp, arent you better off just having your own LST and then monetizing your product a certain way and giving it back to the LST and then actually just capturing value a different way. And thats good for like, because heres the thing. If a new Dapp launches in Solana, right, and I look at that as an investment opportunity myself, then im probably going to have to sell some Sol to invest in that Dapp. So youre giving me this trade off that I maybe dont want to make, which is own Sol or own this other random governance token that I think might outperform Sol. And most people are just like, you know what, we just would rather own one asset. So this way you're letting the Dapp creator, founder or team capture economic value, but at the same time, you're not having the investor make the choice between selling their soul for governance token.
01:13:07.048 - 01:13:18.250, Speaker B: Absolutely. I think like something like drip, for instance, is moving this direction. Right. They have their own LSt helios as well.
01:13:18.370 - 01:13:18.626, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:13:18.658 - 01:13:20.706, Speaker B: They're not like the number one validator, I think.
01:13:20.818 - 01:13:21.954, Speaker C: Sanctum as well. Yeah.
01:13:22.042 - 01:13:49.554, Speaker B: Excellent observation. Right. Because I think if you're capturing attention in some way, shape or form, capture capital to and natively allow that capital, like remove the opportunity cost is what you're saying of having to swap something you like. But also on the idle component versus the realization that the blur team had. That's the way they build blasts. Right. Which is like, if you're providing liquidity for these NFT marketplaces, you're also missing out on lido type of yield.
01:13:49.554 - 01:13:56.746, Speaker B: So build the l two with native yield integrated so that you capture, you retain. It's all retention and game. Right?
01:13:56.858 - 01:13:57.550, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:13:58.410 - 01:14:13.190, Speaker B: And that is relative to traditional tech or fintech, money moves here much faster. The barriers to exit are super low and so it's difficult.
01:14:14.350 - 01:14:29.650, Speaker C: I think there are certain perp platforms on Solana that might do really well, but I want to maybe get exposure to that by owning the thing that gives me the trading fees in addition to the LST staking GiB. But I don't want to own that governance token generally. I think most dapps should think about having their.
01:14:30.270 - 01:14:36.878, Speaker B: You could launch your LST and then have some of the fees. Just bundle all of the fees of the platform into that.
01:14:37.014 - 01:14:37.670, Speaker C: Correct.
01:14:37.830 - 01:14:54.928, Speaker B: That's smart. When Jito's kind of doing. Jito has a governance, it is a token that's capturing a lot of things. Right. Do you think that it's feasible for someone like Jito to, like, if you were to, like, do it again, to like, not have the GTO token and just like, yeah, I don't know.
01:14:54.944 - 01:15:08.378, Speaker C: I don't know about Jito. I do think. I don't think the current market structure of, like, every little project that builds one little product that has 10,000 users having its own governance token is like the right market structure.
01:15:08.464 - 01:15:09.086, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:15:09.238 - 01:15:12.886, Speaker C: Because all the, like, most of those things will just go down 90% over a period of time.
01:15:13.078 - 01:15:18.862, Speaker B: By the way, it's a good thing because a lot of times having a token is distracting for users, like, then demoralizing.
01:15:19.006 - 01:15:19.670, Speaker C: Right.
01:15:19.830 - 01:15:45.954, Speaker B: It's like pumped out fun. The projects that actually get off the bonding curve are the ones that actually get attention, but you give them that breathing room as you get a startup before ipoing, whereas the current construct in crypto is you. IPo day one, it's like, no, guys like you have to kind of wait a little bit. So you're saying smaller ones, monetize this way, fund the business this way, fund the development this way. Once you get to a critical size, maybe it makes sense to launch a token. Thats a good in between hybrid thing.
01:15:46.122 - 01:16:07.630, Speaker C: That goes back to that earlier question you had, which is that chart of token performance and all these things. I think a lot of managers in the space, including we think about this similarly sometimes as well. Its like youre always trying to find the next hot thing. The answer just might be own the thing that is really working and dont try to chase for the next hot thing because the next hot thing actually might not make it.
01:16:10.210 - 01:16:44.362, Speaker B: Do you think that that strategy only becomes more important as we have more consumer applications? Whereas historically in crypto it's like selling the dream. And so maybe it pay to chase that new hot thing, that new high performance, high TPS thing, but that strategy is not going to work anymore because increasingly. So you're going to have a very clear understanding of the have and have nots from a technical, from an adoption, from a retention standpoint. Right?
01:16:44.426 - 01:16:45.546, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah.
01:16:45.738 - 01:17:00.960, Speaker B: Like, like it depends on the layers of the stack and also in the cycle. But going forward, it is going to be incredibly difficult to justify, for instance, ethereum being six, seven x the value of Solana when ethereum fees are down 57% in the quarter.
01:17:02.060 - 01:17:02.676, Speaker C: Yep.
01:17:02.788 - 01:17:06.428, Speaker B: Because of. Was it four, eight, what is it, 48, 4844?
01:17:06.524 - 01:17:07.200, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:17:08.060 - 01:17:17.644, Speaker B: And, oh, it, it's. And all of a sudden, Solana fees plus mev. And then applications getting a lot of traction.
01:17:17.812 - 01:17:18.204, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:17:18.252 - 01:17:40.770, Speaker B: Like, like you couldn't stand on you, you couldn't put a finger on some of these benchmarks and some of these analyses of like, ideologies in prior cycles, this cycle and subsequent cycles, I think it's going to be just increasingly clear from a, you know, kind of undisputed manner, the have and have nots.
01:17:40.890 - 01:17:41.434, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:17:41.562 - 01:17:50.030, Speaker B: That goes for bottom parts of the infra middleware, but primarily like ecosystems and then like, the applications within those ecosystems.
01:17:50.420 - 01:17:53.876, Speaker A: Gents, I hate to do this. I'm five minutes late for a call. I think I'm the admin on this.
01:17:53.908 - 01:17:59.520, Speaker B: All right, thanks for joining us on short notice. I was talking before you joined. Let's have you on again.
01:17:59.820 - 01:18:00.644, Speaker A: Yeah, of course.
