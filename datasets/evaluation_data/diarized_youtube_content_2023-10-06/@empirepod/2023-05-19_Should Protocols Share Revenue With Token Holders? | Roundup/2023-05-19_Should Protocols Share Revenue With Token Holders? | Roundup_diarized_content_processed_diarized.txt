00:00:39.634 - 00:00:54.190, Speaker B: Empire all right, everyone, welcome back to another roundup of Bell Curve. Today we got some new faces. We got Miles, who's been on the show before, of course. Welcome back, Miles. We've got two of our senior analysts. Dan Smith. Fells, welcome.
00:00:54.382 - 00:00:56.514, Speaker C: Appreciate it. Happy to be the b team today.
00:00:57.614 - 00:00:58.554, Speaker D: Likewise.
00:00:59.574 - 00:01:28.104, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, fellas, this is going to be a good one. We've met, we shed the dead weight and we, we got the all stars here. So this is going to be a fun one. It's been a, it's been a spicy week, actually. We got a lot of good content and maybe it makes the most sense to start with Lido because that made quite a bit of waves. So, um, there was a forum post that appeared earlier this week. The title of the post is introducing LDO staking TLDR is to introduce an LDO staking module buyback program.
00:01:28.104 - 00:02:23.184, Speaker B: It allows token holders to stake Lido in exchange for a proportion of Lido Dow revenue via an LDL buyback and distribute program. The idea is that this is going to increase LDL utility and having stakers basically serve as sort of a insurance fund of last resort against some sort of slashing event. I guess the caveat, before we get too far into this, is just to say, it seems like at this moment in time that this was probably proposed by a couple of trading firms potentially working in conjunction. It's all speculation, so we don't need to name any names on the show, but you can kind of do your own sleuthing on Twitter to find out who's being implicated here. So probably this was a little bit of maybe pump and dump kind of action, but I think there is still, it merits an interest, it's an interesting idea. It merits some discussion, whoever wants to take it first. What do you guys largely think about this?
00:02:23.604 - 00:03:46.000, Speaker E: Yeah, I can jump in maybe just to touch on the last point. I think it speaks to the need to be very very wary of where these proposals are coming from, especially in a bear market like this, where there's limited opportunities. And in general, you want these decisions to be driven by long people who have long term vested interests in these protocols. And as much shit as the VC's get, typically, that is typically why it's sometimes good to have a lot of the voting power with market participants like this, rather than potentially participants that are looking to hold lido for a much shorter period of time and have of ulterior motives. So I would say use that lens, especially, especially now in the bear market, as you kind of look at some of these proposals. But then maybe just transitioning to putting that aside, the merits of the proposal itself, I guess I could just say I'm strongly opposed to the proposal. And my two main issues were, I guess one is just in the context of the proposal.
00:03:46.000 - 00:04:50.564, Speaker E: I think the author said that Lido has 17 years of Runway based off of the assets in its treasury. And of course, Lido probably has one of the more diversified treasuries or deep five protocols. But the majority of that Runway in LDO tokens and be able to pay, I think, a very significant contributor base at this point of around 70 or 80 people. They need stable coins, they need cash, or at the very least they need ethereum. I think LDO plays into their comp for long term incentives, but that's just very, very wrong to be using native tokens as to calculate the Runway. And I think we can look back to, I think it was Hasu and monet supply wrote a great managing treasury as well piece, I think, a while ago. So that was my issue.
00:04:50.564 - 00:05:42.124, Speaker E: Number one is that they need this revenue to pay for expenses. And they have about, I think, $30 million of non LDO expenses next year. Roughly $30 million of revenue coming in. If you send out half of that revenue or whatever was proposed to token holders, now you're operating at a loss and you have to go sell more lido on the open market or find more vc's to buy it in order to extend that Runway. That's number one. Then number two is, even if Lido was profitable, kind of put these Runway issues aside. I think there's just far better ways to allocate capital to maximize long term token value at this point for Lido than to start returning capital to token holders.
00:05:42.124 - 00:06:42.860, Speaker E: My general mental model for these things is that if you are profitable, you will use the revenue to pay for your expenses for the next year. And then whatever you have left, you want to invest in basically the highest ROI opportunities for Lido. This could be investing in the staking router, really helping, bootstrapping some of these new validator sets, really building out the dual ETH or steeth Elido governance. These are the things that's going to maximize Lido's long term market share. Then once you get to the point where you can pay for all your expenses, you've allocated capital towards the highest ROI opportunities, and then you still have revenue left over, just like a traditional company. That's when it starts to make sense to start returning that capital as dividends. And so I don't know why.
00:06:42.860 - 00:07:07.708, Speaker E: Maybe it's just the nature of tokens being highly liquid, but people tend to want to distribute capital back to token holders in the very early stages of these protocols. And, you know, I just generally think that it's poor capital management or capital allocation management. So, yeah, we'll stop there, but yeah.
00:07:07.756 - 00:07:34.812, Speaker C: No, I strongly agree with your takes on that, Miles. And around the token, the treasury Runway thing. Absolutely. That's like super clear to me, and I really don't think most people would have an argument around that. I think the real debate really comes around, like revenue distribution. That's like where I see kind of two clear camps. And, you know, I'm firmly in the belief that the model you just described is perfect in reference to pure governance tokens.
00:07:34.812 - 00:08:39.506, Speaker C: Like, if they. If the token doesn't play a direct role in the ecosystem, whatever that may be, there are plenty of different ways that we've already seen protocols design a token, an ecosystem around a token, you know, like, even in the most basic sense, which may or may not be a great model, I'm not supporting the model, but curve uses their token to create this liquidity incentive program, and they kind of pull from the bitcoin model. That is one example of where this could make sense. But in a pure governance token model, returning revenue to the token before it's matured and to your point, has no better places to reinvest the capital is like nothing short of mental illness. It makes no sense that, like, I can't figure out a way to justify how that makes sense. And in the case of Lido, more specifically, you know, after they take their 5% of all staking revenue, that, like, right, currently is annualized at about $14 million. And, you know, obviously ETH price, ETH price fluctuations affect that, and the current ETH staking rate affects that as well.
00:08:39.506 - 00:09:12.614, Speaker C: But let's just use that $14 million number for now. And the proposal suggested that up to 50% of that 14 million could be redistributed to the token. So that's $7 million going to a $2 billion token. Like, why are we doing this? This doesn't make any sense. Like, please go use that revenue to pay developers to expand your protocol, to improve your protocol, to improve the UX, to create a new service offering. Literally anything like this is their job, and it needs to be kept within the protocol to fund future growth.
00:09:13.474 - 00:09:56.642, Speaker D: Yeah, strong agree with that, Dan. I also just think a good analogy for that is like, what if a bank's only business model was to take customer deposits and put them in short term t bills? Like, they wouldn't be making that much money. It's like the same with Lido. Like, they're gonna have to diversify that product offering. I personally would love to see like an LST back stable with that's like kind of like governance minimized and most excess revenue actually flows to an insurance fund because, like, down the line 1020 years, you could actually do some interesting things, like with that stablecoin after you have proper reserves backing it. So I don't know, I think just in general they need to focus on growth. And then also, like, I don't know if you guys remember a little while ago they were talking about giving Steve holders governance rights over Lido because it's so intertwined with Ethereum security.
00:09:56.642 - 00:10:13.044, Speaker D: But this is exactly the opposite of aligning incentives. This is literally trading ETH for LDO. Like it's value extractive for the LDO token. So very against this proposal. I think there's a lot of interesting things they'll be able to work in down the line, but I just don't think that time is now.
00:10:13.344 - 00:11:13.674, Speaker E: Yeah, yeah, totally agree. And, you know, I think the faulty narrative that is, you know, used to support some of these ideas is that if you start paying out dividends or returning capital in some way, that's going to pump the token price, and now all of a sudden the LDL in your treasury is worth more so you can have a longer Runway. And that's why it's like a good capital allocation decision. But if you just look back at protocols that have implemented these models, there's typically a token pump, narrative driven token pump in the month after the announcement comes out. The actual amount of revenue distributed is typically negligible in reality, and then the token declines back to the norm. I think that's generally the way these things work. But I would say Lido actually does have a roadmap to returning capital.
00:11:13.674 - 00:11:56.494, Speaker E: I think their goal is really to ossify the protocol over time, once they have really reached maturity. And if they reach market dominance and they start basically ossifying these core components of the protocol, then it's basically just maintenance. And at that point it probably makes sense to start minimizing governance as much as possible, which could be like removing this idea of capital allocation and just distributing the revenue back to LDL holders. So, yeah, I think we're in full agreement here.
00:11:57.914 - 00:12:31.414, Speaker B: Hey, everyone, we'll get back to the show in a minute, but just wanted to let you know that we've got our permissionless conference coming up. This is the one that we do with bankless. It is the biggest and best conference in Defi. It's going to be in Austin, Texas this year, September 11 through the 13th. If you've been in crypto for a while, you know that bear market conferences are the best conferences because those are the one that all the alphas at this year, we've got a phenomenal lineup of speakers and the topics that we're covering are insane. We're going to be talking about ZK tech roll ups, count abstraction, Mev app change, the whole suite of stuff. I cannot wait myself.
00:12:31.414 - 00:13:01.970, Speaker B: So because you're a listener of this podcast, you're also going to get a discount. Type in pods 20 and you're going to get 20% off your ticket. Click the link at the bottom of this episode and go get it now because prices go up every two weeks. Yeah, you know what, I was, there was a great thread. You know, he did it as a semi joke, but sort of poking fun at a real problem. Joseph DeLong put together this thread on the Dow run lemonade stand, and it was semi hyperbole, but definitely a real grain of truth. And what a dowel run lemonade stand would be like.
00:13:01.970 - 00:14:07.912, Speaker B: It's not like, take your lemons and your water, whatever your raw materials, and sellers like, well, what if we voted and like dumped out four fifths of the, of the lemonade to create scarcity and a liquidity sink? And you know, what if your friend, like, lobbied you to move over to the other sidewalk? And this was just the living manifestation of that. And there's like two arguments here, which is, do you have this model that, you know, corporate finance is kind of perfected, which is reallocating profits back into the business until you don't have a better use for those profits. And that is when you distribute dividends in the most capital efficient way, which in tradvide share buybacks. So like, what is the time for crypto protocols to do that? I think that's a matter of debate. It's definitely not when you're not profitable, that's definitely when you should not be returning capital to shareholders. Hasu wrote a great, a great response to this, where he gave probably more realistic numbers. He's an advisor to Lido, and the numbers that he gave were projecting Lido Dow to make 30 million in gross margin at the current price of ETH, spend 30 million in cash and spend 15 million in token incentives.
00:14:07.912 - 00:14:46.328, Speaker B: So basically 45 million in total expenses. That comes to a net loss of $15 million. So if you're losing $15 million a year, what you should not be doing is returning capital to shareholders. But there is like a debate of when. That is the problem with these sorts of, like a focus on tokenomics in ecosystems where it doesn't necessarily make sense, like eats tokenomics, like the value cruel mechanism. The burn, I think, is great curve is probably a good example, but it distracts from focus, which should be directed towards the product. And you get, you're trying to create these weird Ponzi loops that in this instance actually take away from, from the business drivers of lido.
00:14:46.328 - 00:15:11.982, Speaker B: So Lido is a two sided marketplace with people that want to stake and deposit ETH and node operators. You're raising the barrier to entry for node operators by creating a bond that's additional friction. So not only is this isn't even net neutral, this is net negative in a proposal of tokenomics, which I feel like often happens when you're not focused on the drivers of the business and the financials.
00:15:12.078 - 00:16:15.130, Speaker E: So, yeah, while we're on the topic, I would also like to poke at that scarcity narrative, because typically these types of proposals either are, let's buy back and distribute, you know, the native token, let's distribute whatever the profits are, just, you know, as is in kind, or let's take our, you know, revenue, let's buy back and burn. Just this general idea of like when you're an application and you're not trying to be a store of value or money in any way while you're literally lighting your revenue on fire has never, never resonated with me. And I think it's just, you know, on the topic, I would like to extend it to these burn, you know, ideas as well, because you can just look back, it just hasn't been successful. And I think Ethereum is a very, you know, unique case where they don't want governance to be, you know, they don't want governance, period. Right. That's, that's actually part of their value prop. And, you know, be incredibly neutral.
00:16:15.130 - 00:16:29.414, Speaker E: And so if you don't want any sort of governance and your asset actually is, you know, you're trying to have moneyness around it, then some sort of burn could make sense. But when you're building a product that makes no sense.
00:16:30.034 - 00:17:23.404, Speaker C: Yeah, I want to, I want to dive a little deeper on this, Miles. So I strongly agree that, like the ETH burn mechanism, to try to be money to the base layer of an economy built on top of it, there's something to that. And let's leave that aside. But strictly looking at this buyback and burn, sort of this capital redistribution from protocol to token method, if you think about traditional finance and that capital redistribution is commonly done in the form of cash dividends or share repurchases. And if you think about a buyback and burn as a share repurchase, I'm curious to get your takes around that, because in tradfi, everyone has the same models that have slightly different assumptions that all get to the same ballpark value. And that's generally how stocks trade. That's significantly oversimplifying it, of course, but generally, then when you look at crypto, or I guess to go further on that, that's why share repurchases work.
00:17:23.404 - 00:18:10.714, Speaker C: When the last thing you do on that model is get the enterprise value divide by the shares outstanding and you just change that shares outstanding number, then that's like how the capital allocation flows from the company to the shareholder. So, like, if you have a $50 stock and you get $1 of dividend in cash, now you have $51. Or if I do a share repurchase, that one share goes from dollar 50 to dollar 51, and you still end up with the dollar 51, but in a slightly more tax advantaged way. And with buyback and burn methodology in crypto, there are no models. So there is no changing that last number on the denominator that effectively redistributes that revenue from the protocol to the token holder. So I'm kind of curious to get your takes around that. Like, will that model ever work in crypto?
00:18:11.734 - 00:19:01.754, Speaker E: So I'd just say, like, just looking at the traditional side, like, when does this, when do these buybacks, like, make sense? And when do they not make sense? And I'll maybe just give, like, two examples of. So in one area where one company where it has actually made sense is Apple, right. And this is very probably the past five years that they've started doing this. And think about Apple's market position and the amount of cash that they hold. I mean, it is orders of magnitude more than we could ever imagine with a protocol at this point. And it's been fairly successful, but they're in a very privileged position to be able to do that. And where it doesn't make sense is basically what we're talking about here is when there's just better capital allocation decisions.
00:19:01.754 - 00:19:58.854, Speaker E: Bill Gurley, I'll have to dig up some tweets, but he's written about this a lot. And if you look at, I don't know, just taking a crypto company, I know DCG bought back a ton of shares when they could have eventually used that for the hole in their balance sheet that they created. So these things, you know, if you're, again, it is a little bit short sighted in some, in most scenarios, but yeah, I think maybe at some point we could get to the point where that makes sense. You know, if Uniswap has 95% market share of all, like, you know, Dex trading, and they want to start burning uniswap because there's really nothing else to invest in, then that could make sense. But I just think we are years and years away from this making sense for an application that's building a product.
00:19:59.394 - 00:20:35.118, Speaker B: Well, one of the other differences as well, outside of the capital allocation question, is one of market dynamics. And the reason why share purchases work in traditional markets is they're actually relatively efficient. Right. So it's kind of this idea of if you have a pie and you cut it into four pieces or eight pieces, you don't change the slice of the pie. But in crypto markets just aren't that efficient. You just don't have that many sophisticated investors. And I don't think that the way that investors react to share repurchases in tradfi markets are the same way that they react in crypto markets.
00:20:35.118 - 00:21:08.134, Speaker B: I just don't think they are a consequence. The other consequence of share buybacks is you restrict the float. That's not the explicit aim of a share buyback, but that is a consequence of it. And I do wonder if the reason why buyback and burn models in crypto get implemented are less about returning capital to token holders and more about intentionally constricting the float and pumping the price of the token. That's a suspicion that I've always sort of had and wondered about.
00:21:08.904 - 00:21:26.368, Speaker E: I think that's the general thinking, is that you take these shares off the market, but you're also applying buy pressure as you're taking them off the market, that makes the token price go up, which makes your treasury go up, and it just hasn't totally played out like that.
00:21:26.536 - 00:21:56.510, Speaker D: Yeah, I wish we would see more of a revenue share model, kind of like gains network. So they do a revenue share model, but they also make sure 20% of all revenue or something like that actually goes to a. A protocol dev fund. So, like, they've been, you know, incentivized since day one to keep shipping good products and building out their offering. And when they do that, they generate more revenue like that. That incentive makes a lot more sense to me than. Than, you know, the one with Lido that we're discussing.
00:21:56.702 - 00:22:32.384, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe we've got a bunch of other stuff to cover. So I want to make sure we move on a little bit past Lido. But one thing that I think would be worth getting into is the history of just why Steve holders deserve some say in Lido governance. And there have been a lot of sort of hot takes on Twitter about how I think, well, we'll get his take. I think I saw Vance tweet this out, actually, that Steve is going to surpass what he said. He had some take about this, but basically just rapid growth of Steve, and that it might be, I think history was that it'll be the more common base pair than ETH on LP pools. So that was a bit of a hot take.
00:22:32.384 - 00:22:45.304, Speaker B: I've kind of come around to it, but I know whoever wants to take any miles, you were sort of involved in the governance aspect of seafolders, and then if we could get into, like, how rapidly you see it expanding.
00:22:45.424 - 00:23:17.204, Speaker E: Yeah, absolutely. So I think there's two drivers. I mean, liquid staking protocols in general, and you could argue, have this kind of a principle agent problem where, you know, you could. You're delegating your stake to a validator. Right. You don't necessarily have a choice of who it's delegated to because that's controlled through governance and like a whitelist in Lido's case. And, you know, these validators are, in Leido's particular situation, not actually putting up collateral.
00:23:17.204 - 00:24:00.264, Speaker E: And so if there was a malicious one, you know, it would destroy their reputation and their business. But that's really what you're banking on. So that's kind of like the risk here. And second piece, I would say, is Lido's goal is for steeth to become as ubiquitous as ETH itself. Right. And to do that, you really need to break through kind of what I think about as like social scalability issues, which is getting the ethereum community comfortable with that sort of roadmap, because you know, that that is what will lead to market share domination. And to do that, you really need to do two things.
00:24:00.264 - 00:25:12.944, Speaker E: You need to give steeth holders the ability to veto super malicious proposals that could destroy the value of their steeth by having some sort of attack. And second, over time, you want to ossify or cement parts of the protocol and remove governance, you know, governance's ability to change it. And so these are things like, you know, the withdrawal contract at some point in a perfect world, that would just be completely ossified. And so, you know, as a steeth holder, you don't have to worry about, you know, some sort of Lido governance attack that could, you know, rug all the steep or something like that. And so this is, to me is, it's like you're trying to solve this principle agent problem in order to maximize the total ceiling of possible market share that you could capture. And it was at a point where I think they had reached 30% of all staking market share. And obviously we're like in the 90% of market share within liquid staking.
00:25:12.944 - 00:26:05.064, Speaker E: And so ethereum community starts to get nervous and saying, this is going to look like kind of like a cosmos chain if this is what the status quo is, where we have maybe 100, 150 validators, but that's against our principles. That's not how we designed Ethereum. And so I think all of this, like the dual steeth ETH, or the dual steeth Lido governance, the ability to add new validator sets with the staking router, including permissionless ones, this is all going towards, okay, what do we need to do in order to get the community comfortable with having Steve basically as the canonical liquid staking token with winner take all market share, and I think they're on the right track, honestly.
00:26:05.724 - 00:26:36.596, Speaker C: And I'll put Vance in the hot seat, but that tweet stated that staked ETH would be the more common base pair by year end. Bold take, my friend. But I totally agree with, with miles sentiment there. Like, staked ETH is Lido's product, and they're just trying to improve the utility of that product and give the token holders more rights in the system. And I think that's broadly kind of a good way to go about this. But yeah, I'm curious, like to watch Lido grow. Obviously it'll grow with the market share of total staked ETH.
00:26:36.596 - 00:27:17.810, Speaker C: But I'm curious if that like 30 33% market share number kind of like acts as this stonewall for their growth, that because to Miles point, do we really want one ecosystem member ensure there's 28, I believe is the number of total validators operating on behalf of Lido's total stake. But do we really want to shrink the total amount of validators to that number? And I don't know. I generally think the Ethereum community will kind of push away from that. So I'm kind of really interested to watch Lido's growth and whether or not that 33% of total stake number becomes an issue going forward. And right now, just for context, they're sitting at about 31%.
00:27:17.922 - 00:27:46.652, Speaker B: So I have a question to you guys. Let's just say, let's remove the sort of social scaling problem and whether or not Ethereum would accept that. Let's also remove the factor that there might be some sort of catastrophic slashing event or technical bug in Lido or something like that. By the way, we didn't even. It's kind of a shame we're talking about this because v two actually ended up shipping this week, which is super cool. So props to Lido. There was, I heard Wren on the Zero X research podcast, which Shell, Dan and Sam here, they put together some great content.
00:27:46.652 - 00:28:09.354, Speaker B: So you go over and listen. But there was a, there was a nut statistic. So there were nine different audits that were conducted on v two. And each audit, up till the last one, found a new bug, which Ren said he didn't know how to feel about that. I know how I felt about that, which is not particularly great. You would hope by like four or five they wouldn't be finding these stuff. So let's just.
00:28:09.354 - 00:28:58.224, Speaker B: But let's remove the social scale up scaling risk and let's remove the fact that there might be a bug. I think in that world, you'd rather hold Steve than ETH, right? Like, why wouldn't you? It's just the Steve gives you some form of interest, right? Like staking rewards and ETH doesn't give you staking rewards. And the ETH roadmap and monetary policy is clearly favoring stakers over holders, right? Everything from 1559 to the burn, those are all done for reasons of credible neutrality. Not like number go up reasons, but those are the reasons. So I think to maybe defend Vance's point of view a little bit. I think by end of year, that's a pretty bold prediction. But I do see the relative demand of Steve over ETH.
00:28:58.224 - 00:29:04.228, Speaker B: Yeah, it's going to go up over time. It's like bonds versus dollars. You've had the whole money that gives you interest.
00:29:04.396 - 00:30:05.384, Speaker C: But the counterpoint in that example is the US government's the only issuer of what gets deemed as risk free bonds. But there's multiple protocols that issue liquid staking derivatives of ETH that use different models just very clearly. And Lido is the winner today. They had a huge first mover advantage with being the first liquid staking token listed on Aave. If you pull up the chart of outstanding staked ETH and then map over when it got listed on Aave, it is very, very clear the impact that that had. And so I'm curious, like, we've kind of like adopted this as the safest liquid staking derivative as a market. And I don't know, I'm just really interested to watch this market play out as other players get a little more mature, have a slightly different offering, whether that be like fracs built this kind of ponzonomic model where it has a two token model that provides higher yield, or Coinbase has like a higher fee, but it's super easy to onboard new people.
00:30:05.384 - 00:30:26.214, Speaker C: You get to do it directly through the Coinbase app. There's these different trade offs with all these different models. So I don't know. That's my issue with how does one staking liquid staking derivative become the de facto base pair, is there's just so many different offerings that ultimately I fear that we're going to get this liquidity fragmentation in that world.
00:30:27.074 - 00:30:40.506, Speaker E: Yeah, I totally see that. I do think that there's also a lot of forces that push it towards winner take all though, right? Because the liquidity basically begets more liquidity.
00:30:40.570 - 00:30:43.106, Speaker B: Begets liquidity and so on.
00:30:43.130 - 00:31:55.614, Speaker E: And there's a lot there. One thing that I've been thinking about, and we work closely with the liquid collective team, and there is a part of the market that just from a compliance standpoint, can't really touch lido because in order, maybe they're a centralized custodian, that is a fiduciary on behalf of their customers, and they cannot basically support staking to non KYC validators, and they don't reach their levels of compliance. And then there's another part of the market that just ideologically would prefer a rocket pull model. And I think that that's why the staking router is so important, because you basically have your existing set of whatever it is, like 30 validators or something like that, and 100% of deposits are going there today. But you could also see them adding different validator sets that cater to those other parts of the market and then splitting how the deposits are allocated across those different validator sets as well as within them.
00:31:55.914 - 00:31:56.810, Speaker B: Interesting.
00:31:56.962 - 00:32:09.724, Speaker E: Yeah. And I do think that there's. It's a big question here. I would say that the Coinbase success has been both ease of access as well as compliance, which I don't think a lot of people think about.
00:32:10.264 - 00:32:18.880, Speaker C: And that kind of, like, ties together this whole conversation of go use that $14 million to build out the staking. That was the first thing.
00:32:18.912 - 00:32:37.444, Speaker B: Seriously, Miles? Yeah, seriously. You know what else they could use it for? So I saw DJ and Spartan tweet this. I didn't realize this, but bybit, their liquid staking program, they just convert you directly into. Into steeth. I mean, if they're just like a front end distribution for go do more of that. That's. That's phenomenal.
00:32:37.444 - 00:32:51.428, Speaker B: Go do that with. Well, it's now like. Like Kucoin or whatever other, like, kind of tier two exchanges will have you basically, Kraken's got some problems with their stake and go do that. Let them be front end. I mean, I don't know. There's a lot of stuff like that. Even.
00:32:51.428 - 00:33:06.880, Speaker B: Even that. There was a synthetix proposal to onboard on board, Steve. I'm pretty sure as well. Was that synthetix or was that some crafty BD work? I don't know that that is what. That is what they should be doing. They should be opening up new distribution channels, pipelines. Like.
00:33:06.880 - 00:33:15.416, Speaker B: They should. They should be. This is a winner take all marketplace, and we want to be the winner. We want to get critical mass. That's what they should be doing. Yeah.
00:33:15.440 - 00:33:37.374, Speaker D: Another thing I'd love to see would be kind of the use of account abstraction with steeth on l two s. Like, as you mentioned, Mike, like, obviously, you want to hold steethy, like, barring contract risk, like, over regular ETH. So if I could pay for transactions on arbitrum or optimism in Steve, that would be fantastic. I would always have a steep balance in my wallet. So that's another thing they could work on.
00:33:38.714 - 00:34:12.434, Speaker B: Sorry, this wasn't even on the roadmap or the notes for today, but I got a shout out. Ethereum. I saw Kai Sheffield at visa tweeting out some of the. The tinkering that they're doing on account abstraction and acting as a paymaster. And I was blown away by that, that they understand what that is and they understand the, like, the opportunity for visa. You know, you've seen a lot of like proof of concepts from banks talking about tokenization of real estate. I'm just sorry, my eyes just glaze over that, so.
00:34:12.434 - 00:34:40.516, Speaker B: But this, like visa as a payments giant understanding account abstraction of where they fit in the ecosystem is freaking cool. I would be long. Sorry, not financial advice, but visa, yeah, they're like the, they're probably the largest institution acting crypto today that like, I really think actually gets it and has a super cool, like, approach to it. So huge shout out to Kai and the team at Visa. Just awesome.
00:34:40.660 - 00:35:19.480, Speaker E: Couldn't agree more. It's, you know, very much so signal over noise there. And I do think it will be interesting though, because we have so many of these very early stage account abstraction infrastructure providers that have really been pioneering everything about this new development with 4337. And then you have incumbents like Coinbase and Visa that could also be extending their capabilities. And it will be interesting to see how they think about by partner build with how to deal with this infrastructure, especially the ones that are not as sophisticated as visa.
00:35:19.672 - 00:35:50.654, Speaker B: Yeah, guys, I want to make sure that we have some time to talk about stacks. Got to give a shout out to Sam here. Wrote, I think, the hundredth report on blockworks research. And it was pretty much a blowout on stacks, which you personally, Sam, uncovered some pretty critical bugs in that ecosystem that hadn't necessarily been there before, by the way. Big fan of would be and stacks in general and definitely pulling for them, but it was fascinating. Um, Sam, maybe could you just give us kind of like an overview of what you found in that, in the stacks ecosystem?
00:35:51.154 - 00:36:12.674, Speaker D: Yeah, for sure. I'll do my best to kind of tldr it as quick as I can. So essentially, uh, stacks uses a, what's called a proof of transfer consensus mechanism. Basically, miners on the bitcoin layer can send bitcoin to two different stacks. Stacker slash staker, they call it stacking. That's probably my least favorite part of stacks, to be honest, out of all this. I really don't like that term.
00:36:12.674 - 00:36:58.236, Speaker D: But anyways, they send it to two random stacker addresses and then dependent upon how much bitcoin they send in relation to other people who are submitting bids, they have a higher chance of mining the next stacks block. And then STX stackers are able to earn native bitcoin yield, which is actually really cool. I love that aspect of the proof of transfer design. But the problem is there's actually three problems. Problems. The first one was there was a critical bug discovered in the proof of transfer stacking mechanism that allowed a stacker to trick the contract into thinking they had more STX stacked than they actually did. So they wound up earning 15 and a half or so bitcoin over a 20 day period, basically stealing their share of bitcoin in relation to other stackers.
00:36:58.236 - 00:37:49.674, Speaker D: So that's pretty bad because STX stackers are going to be charged with signing peg in and peg outs when they launch s bitcoin. So to date, they don't have a native bitcoin bridge, but they're looking to build that out because they think it's been kind of one of the growth hurdles for their ecosystem. Like, their main goal is really to onboard that $500 billion of idle bitcoin capital into Defi and making it productive. But had this, this bug occurred with sbitcoin live, all of the bitcoin in the bridge would have been at risk. So that's the first bug. The second one is bitcoin Mev related. Basically, f two pool, the mining mining pool that has a 15% share of bitcoin hash power, has been excluding or ignoring other stacks mining bids and including only their own.
00:37:49.674 - 00:38:20.520, Speaker D: So that way they can send as little bitcoin as they want to to STX stackers and still win the block, since theyre the only competition for that block. So thats really outright censorship and kind of the first example of bitcoin mev that ive really seen. So its super interesting. But yeah, f two pool over the last six months has pretty much had 70% to 100% market share over block building on stacks. So obviously that's. That's a problem that needs to be addressed. And then lastly, stacks has been experiencing more reorgs as of late.
00:38:20.520 - 00:38:53.424, Speaker D: And there isn't really a kind of a root cause known by the team. They think it's kind of just connectivity issues. But this is really bad just because stacks is going to undergo the Nakamoto upgrade and they're going to introduce fast blocks. They'll have blocks in between different settlement blocks, so that way the times are faster and they're not plagued by bitcoins. Time to finality, but I'm not so sure how this is going to impact that. So, definitely something to keep an eye on. But, yeah, reorgs are obviously bad because they're going to reduce network throughput, potentially, like, have some nodes drop off the chain, make it less secure.
00:38:53.424 - 00:39:05.874, Speaker D: So there's definitely a lot of problems that stacks needs to combat. But it's cool that they're trying to tie their chain closely to bitcoin. Because me personally, like, I'm very excited about the prospects of bringing Defwood defi to bitcoin.

00:40:06.874 - 00:40:33.444, Speaker B: Yeah, it was. It was interesting. Just, you know, we're, yeah, concluding this mev season with Hasu. And frankly, I didn't even think to look at bitcoin as a source of mev or just understand what was going on from mining perspective and bitcoin. But maybe we should have. I mean, this is a super interesting exploit by one of the larger mining pools out there. So my understanding, it's not huge dollars, but it's still worrisome.
00:40:33.484 - 00:40:33.636, Speaker E: Right?
00:40:33.660 - 00:41:03.462, Speaker B: It's just some good old fashioned censorship and Mev extraction. So, yeah, it was just interesting. It also, I think, shows the challenges of, you know, it's not. I mean, stacks has been called a roll up. At this point, I'll just say I'm not even 100% sure I know what a roll up is. But the design architecture between stacks, as opposed to some canonical, optimistic, or zk roll ups on Ethereum, is definitely different. And I admire the work.
00:41:03.462 - 00:41:19.876, Speaker B: I'm a lover of bitcoin. I want bitcoin to succeed. I think all this stuff is super cool, too, but there are definite challenges, like the super small lock size and the ten limit, or the ten minute, you know, block times that stacks going to hurdle. I don't know if you guys, any other thoughts or conclusions?
00:41:20.020 - 00:41:52.590, Speaker D: One thing to note, honestly, because it does sound bad for stacks, but at the same time, you know, it's really no different having one stacks block builder is really no different than having an l two with a centralized sequencer. So they're kind of in the same position in a way. So I think that's worth pointing out. It's just a little bit more worrisome, because obviously, in the case of optimism or arbitrum, they're directly incentivized to operate it in an honest manner. But this is an external party, so who knows how the incentives get switched up once s bitcoin goes live.
00:41:52.742 - 00:43:03.472, Speaker E: Yeah, it's like if optimism gave that centralized sequencer to a searcher or a trading firm, they're obviously going to extract value from it. I think that's all right. And I really appreciate you digging in because I don't, you know, spend a ton of time in that area of the space, but it does speak to kind of the challenges of, you know, we've talked about, like, bitcoin as an app chain, and I think this is kind of deviating from really what would be considered, like, bitcoins original purpose. But I still think that there's a lot of really interesting space to explore, and it's just a question of whether, you know, bitcoins role in Defi is kind of truly like being exporting bitcoin to other DeFi ecosystems that are maybe better suited for it, or if there is a way to kind of, you know, achieve what stacks is trying to do. It's unclear to me if that's, you know, kind of them trying to get, you know, a square into a round hole, because it's. It's. It's just, you know, very, very different than.
00:43:03.472 - 00:43:05.444, Speaker E: Than the design of the base layer.
00:43:05.904 - 00:44:07.374, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, no kidding. And one interesting thing from this, though, was the nefarious actor was f two pool, in the case of stacks, and we've also seen them, you know, do have a little nefarious activity on ETH back in the proof of work days, and they were like, kind of messing around with timestamps on the consensus layer. And if you actually had a credit to a guy named Alex on Twitter, maybe we can link this thread in the show notes. But he actually found a address on ETH Mainnet that's tied to the founder, or what I believe to be the founder of f two pool. Nonetheless, it seems to be an f two pool address, and this person is withdrawing SNX, the token to Ethereum mainnet, bridging it to optimism and then redepositing it back into binance and then just looping that process. I can't come up with any good reasons as to why that is. But given their previous behavior in the space, I think that's kind of something to keep an eye on as this event develops.
00:44:07.994 - 00:44:10.094, Speaker E: Likely not good. Whenever they're.
00:44:10.834 - 00:44:19.690, Speaker C: It's like, I don't know, maybe they're just bored and they're trolling binance. I have no idea. But that seems like that's generally not the case. There must be some financial incentive here.
00:44:19.842 - 00:44:52.704, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe just before we, maybe we can close with tether and the announcement that they're going to start their own little bitcoin purchasing program. But do you, what do you guys think in general about just ordinals and VRc twenty s? And I guess there's kind of like the ordinal NFT inscriptions and then there's also like a. It's part of a wider attempt to actually build out robust defi on top of bitcoin. I'm kind of two minds about it. Yeah, actually, I'd love to get your guys opinions on it, but I've thought a little bit about it myself.
00:44:53.734 - 00:45:53.480, Speaker E: I guess at first I thought it was a bit odd or like, this is just kind of a fun experiment, but I don't know, the more I've thought about it, I guess, again, back to this framework, bitcoin as an app chain and really a place like their product is this extraordinarily censorship resistant asset. Those same properties actually make for NFT storage pretty and minting, somewhat attractive. And I guess I would not expect there to be like NFT fi on bitcoin just because it's not like, if it's just people holding NFTs there and buying and purchasing occasionally, then that makes sense. But I wouldn't expect any. Maybe where it becomes like, high volume trading of these things happens somewhere else. But yeah, I think. I think they also overtook Ethereum nfts and volume this past week.
00:45:53.480 - 00:45:56.644, Speaker E: So there's something there that's at least speculation.
00:45:57.584 - 00:46:23.428, Speaker D: Yeah, I'd say fad. I don't think it sticks around for that long. I do love, the one thing I like about it is obviously the immutable immutability of bitcoin. Like, a lot of NFTs on Ethereum aren't as immutable and sensors as a lot of people think. Um, but I don't think there's any legs to it for specifically static images. That was so bad last bull run at this point. Like, I think the, the fun part about nfts at this point is just the programmatic.
00:46:23.428 - 00:46:39.774, Speaker D: Programmatic ability. God, I can't talk right now. But you know, what I'm trying to say is of the nfTs, like, blend. Like, I'm not saying that's actually a good product or not, but I just think the interesting part of NFTs is, is the ability to add utility to them on like a smart contract enabled platform.
00:46:40.194 - 00:47:22.990, Speaker C: Yeah, I think I lean in your direction, Sam, but I kind of like the idea of ordinals. I mean if we like take a step back, bitcoin has a fee problem. It needs to generate organic fee revenue at some point. I'm not saying its model won't work, but that is just a problem that it's going to have to deal with at some point in the future. And at least with the rise of ordinals we can point to this and be like okay, maybe we can innovate something because prior to that they'd be like, well I don't know, we'll come up with something eventually, but, and that was, that was the thick of it. And now at least we have something to point to. Be like, okay, maybe this, you know, the whole speculation side of this, not great, but let's try to like build this out into a more sustainable ecosystem.
00:47:22.990 - 00:47:49.296, Speaker C: And that's kind of how I'm viewing it. So tend to agree. The speculation side of things is a fad. It's just like it's, it's clearly not built properly, right? So like when you trade these BRC twenties you like buy, you're creating an NFT that says like this is for 3241 tokens. And then if somebody wants to buy 5000, they'd buy that NFT and then keep buying nfts of other token lots until it added up to 5000. That's never going to work. That's not scalable.
00:47:49.296 - 00:47:50.444, Speaker C: That's ridiculous.
00:47:51.344 - 00:48:17.192, Speaker E: Yeah, I couldn't agree more. It's a lot more than just jpegs that make nfts a lot more interesting. Even Lido's. I think the withdrawal process involves an NFT, which is just another example, right? You see nfts and uniswap v. Three. There's a lot more that can be done here, but it is a vehicle for speculation and they needed one.
00:48:17.368 - 00:48:41.680, Speaker C: Strong agree. And just to give one more quick example of a cool, useful NFT, was the interchange scheduler in the Atom 2.0 whitepaper. The idea of tokenizing future block space, and those are obviously non fungible. Each block is unique with an NFT was super interesting. Like I think we're going to get really cool use cases for nfts. I personally believe those use cases will be abroad more so on chain than off chain.
00:48:41.680 - 00:49:06.844, Speaker C: Right? Like to Mike's point, like, I also fall asleep when you talk about tokenizing real estate, but I tend to think the technology unlock of an NFT is really huge. We just don't know what to do with it yet. But I think we've already started to see some exciting examples arise. And that also flows to Sam's point, like when nfts get more programmatic and more use case around them, I tend to think that won't be on bitcoin.
00:49:08.264 - 00:49:49.438, Speaker B: Yeah, I've kind of thought about this a decent amount and I think ultimately, first of all, I kind of just am more in favor of like market type planning than central planning. And like, if the market wants to do this, I don't know. I just think central planning goes wrong very often. And I didn't love. I kind of had a knee jerk bad reaction to the bitcoin high priest saying that maybe miners should censor these transactions when ordinals were originally taking out. That just really rubbed me the wrong way. So who knows? And eventually bitcoin had to figure out their monetary policy because once the block rewards went away, they had low transaction fees and that was not going to be enough to secure a network that they were hoping to grow at the size that to really grow.
00:49:49.438 - 00:50:10.494, Speaker B: So I think this is an interesting solution. I don't love Defi on bitcoin, but I do like nfTs. I think nfTs. It's been interesting to watch NFTs on Ethereum. When are these going to move to polygon or arbitrum or something like that? They don't because there's provenance. There's a little bit of cache for minting on a more expensive chain. Bitcoin fits that to a t.
00:50:10.494 - 00:50:32.540, Speaker B: And bitcoin has culture too. They've got culture. They've got a fan base. I don't know. I like the ordinals a little bit less of a fan of defi on bitcoin, but still worth paying attention to. Let's transition here to tether and maybe we could close on this topic. And frankly, I would love to get your guys thought.
00:50:32.540 - 00:51:05.634, Speaker B: So we just got the latest attestation report from tether and this, I think, Dan, you were the one who pointed out that this was a. I guess this came from BDO, which is not top four, one of the big four, but it's number five. It did come from the italian branch. And I say this is an italian. So I mean, no slight against the good folks of Italy, but I wouldn't like to see this come out of America. I'm not going to lie but yeah, I mean, there was. It looks like everything is sound in terms of their balance sheet.
00:51:05.634 - 00:51:23.830, Speaker B: They did announce that they were going to be basically reinvesting 15% of that operating profit into bitcoin buys and gold as well. So would love to just sort of get all your guys thoughts about this. What do we think? Good idea, bad idea? How are you thinking about it?
00:51:24.022 - 00:51:49.262, Speaker C: I mean, tether is a business and they want to make money, so I get it. As long as that's with the profits and not my deposits, I would greatly appreciate if deposits are backed one to one. We don't need any more fiascos like that. Yeah, I agree. This is. I think this was their first attestation with BDO. I think that's a huge step in the right direction.
00:51:49.262 - 00:51:54.714, Speaker C: I hear your sentiment on the italian branch of it. Like, all right, what's going on there?
00:51:55.054 - 00:51:56.662, Speaker B: Oh, Dan, do you not trust Italians?
00:51:56.758 - 00:52:30.240, Speaker C: Hey, with a name like Dan Smith, you'd never believe it, but also got some deep roots in the italian heritage. But yeah, I don't know, I think it's cool. I think the song people were threading about the buy pressure on bitcoin, and this is like a fraction, if you like, annualize the revenue they made in Q one and assume that they continue that out. I forget the exact numbers. I'll ballpark it at like $400 million of bitcoin buy pressure. That is an absolute fraction of the annual miner issuance or miner subsidies. So it's cool.
00:52:30.240 - 00:52:49.004, Speaker C: But you'd probably need to see like USDC and circle and the issuer Paxos of USDP and all these other stable coins as well, kind of participate in this. But tether is largely the largest stablecoin. So I don't know, it's cool, but that's about it for me.
00:52:49.384 - 00:53:13.604, Speaker D: I got a question for you guys. How in the world is tether not in any way impacted by the banking problems in the US? Their liabilities are us dollars. They have to hold them somewhere. And those banks likely have exposure to us dollar denominated debt, which has been the, you know, obviously the root cause of the banking crisis. So I just don't understand how they haven't been affected at all.
00:53:14.344 - 00:53:54.432, Speaker B: Yeah, just let me layer on, because there was a worry a little while ago, I don't know if you remember, a chinese real estate developer called Evergrande coming under an enormous amount of stress. And the worry was because the word has been, you know, bond traders, they don't trade anything on like tether's behalf they don't know any other traders who, and like, they don't know anyone who trades on tethers behalf. So the speculation was always that they must be trading chinese commercial paper, then Evergrande imploded. And they said, we're not impacted by this at all. So, Sam, I think the only logical answer to your question is that they were in China. They dodged it perfectly. Then they went to the US and invested in us treasuries.
00:53:54.432 - 00:54:01.364, Speaker B: They knew the banking crisis was coming and now they're back in China. I think that's a perfectly logical explanation. That's definitely what's going on.
00:54:04.454 - 00:54:26.914, Speaker C: Yeah, no, that was the funniest part about everybody fleeing USDC during the DPEG to USDT tether. And it was like, the implication is that there's no exposure to the US banking system, which I guess at that time was probably a good thing. But broadly, you probably do want exposure to the largest financial economy in the world. So I don't know.
00:54:27.314 - 00:55:08.474, Speaker E: I don't think that's up to them. I don't think any banks are servicing tether. I think they've got some red flags would come up on a conservative bank's compliance part. That's DD, but I have no idea. I think you could. We've had tether FUD for years now, and it comes and goes in waves, and you can spin up a story for exactly, you know, the worst case scenario here that makes a lot of sense. And you can also just kind of continue to blissfully ignore it, which is basically more or less what we've been doing and who knows what the truth is.
00:55:08.474 - 00:55:41.264, Speaker E: Yeah. I would be very disappointed if this was another LFG approach to diversify some sort of the collateral into bitcoin, which we've seen can go poorly. Especially, I mean, all this. Remember what happened with that? It was like, yay, all this buy pressure on bitcoin. And then it blew up and we're like, no, all this sell pressure on bitcoin. So, you know, you could see, could see that too. But I don't feel very strongly in either direction.
00:55:43.804 - 00:56:23.934, Speaker B: I think at this stage, I think it's okay to demand transparency, especially for something as impactful as tether as it is $82 billion market cap. I don't understand the justification for being so opaque. It simply should not be this difficult to get more insight and transparency into their balance sheet. And I don't know, I feel like, to be honest with you, my, like, knee jerk response to this was, yeah, do Kwan was like a year ago. If, like, this bitcoin, like, is buying bitcoin now going to end up being a poor financial decision? Probably not. Like, we all work in crypto. Like, I'm pretty bullish.
00:56:23.934 - 00:56:48.374, Speaker B: I'd be bullish at this. At this price level. And they'll probably. It'll probably end up being a good financial decision. I guess my question is, what's the reason why they're doing this? Because if it's an optics and marketing decision, then I really don't like it, to be honest with you, because just pattern matching. I have sort of negative associations with who's done that in the past. So I don't know.
00:56:48.374 - 00:57:04.034, Speaker B: I think it's something that's interesting to watch. And I would love to see the sort of pressure just ratchet up on tether to just be more transparent with their books. Like, they could be. I don't understand why we don't insist that they aren't more transparent. I just think they should be.
00:57:04.114 - 00:57:46.034, Speaker E: Yeah, I think we have insisted. I think the obvious answer on is they don't really want you to know exactly what's on there. But that's, like, the skeptical view, obviously. And then on, like, why they're doing this. Like, I would have to, I don't know, a ton of background on, like, the history of, like, the team that runs tether, but, you know, they could be like, og bitcoiners that just. This could be, like, some sort of ideological thing or, you know, it could feel like it's a hedge on kind of some tail risk, you know, black swan event with. With a lot of their, you know, the credit backing their collateral.
00:57:47.014 - 00:57:47.326, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:57:47.350 - 00:58:11.826, Speaker D: I think the reason, if I'm the tether founder, to do this is either a, make it all back in one trade, or b, like, I'm trying to position myself as the future global bank, you know, because obviously, if you think crypto, if that's part of your thesis, you're going to need bitcoin liquidity. So I guess it makes sense to, like, start buying now as opposed to later. But, yeah. Those are the only two reasons I could come up with, Preston.
00:58:11.850 - 00:58:17.934, Speaker B: I feel like everyone on this call is going to know this, but do you know which blockchain settles the most amount of tether?
00:58:20.314 - 00:58:23.414, Speaker E: Oh, yeah. It's an extremely highly reputable.
00:58:25.474 - 00:58:33.094, Speaker C: Please, no more questions like these. Good old Justin Sun's tron with, like, what is it, 50 some billion?
00:58:33.994 - 00:58:48.218, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's a, the gap is actually widening. You can see. Yeah, it's the. It's the amount settled on Tron is growing faster than ethereum, so the gulf is winding, but just.
00:58:48.266 - 00:59:00.036, Speaker C: I don't know what's up with that. I've been wondering for. For too long. I need to go listen to his Empire podcast with. With Jason. But some. I want to hear his answer because, like, why I need.
00:59:00.036 - 00:59:09.444, Speaker C: I need answers. There's no economic activity over there outside of Justin's $2 billion in their version of Ave. So, like, I don't know. I don't know, man.
00:59:09.564 - 00:59:10.584, Speaker E: Yeah, I don't know.
00:59:11.124 - 00:59:15.704, Speaker B: Yeah. We end this podcast with more questions than answers.
00:59:19.924 - 00:59:20.588, Speaker E: It actually.
00:59:20.676 - 00:59:43.872, Speaker D: It actually is crazy. One last thought, that just two months ago, USDC was sitting at a similar market capture Tether. And now it's less than half of Tether's market cap. Like, what an absolute botched result of all this banking problems in the US. We had circle, such a good entity fighting the good fight, and now it's just gone the other direction. So that's unfortunate to see.
00:59:44.008 - 01:00:10.706, Speaker B: I would bet that's temporary. I just have to bet that that's temporary. Yeah. I actually thought Miles on Reveries podcast, I pledge allegiance. That was a great interview with Diogo and. And Nathan, and they talked about these sort of market distortions that can actually exist for multiple years. So let's say you were a competitor against Celsius and you were just watching these guys.
01:00:10.706 - 01:00:35.670, Speaker B: The models, like, the numbers didn't work, but it just worked for like six years. And they ate up all the aum. It looked like they were winning for so long. It's like 1000 days in the life of a turkey, and then boom, you know, the head gets chopped off and there you are being served on the platter. And I think in crypto, that's especially true. I mean, these distortion fields can run for. It's not like weeks or months, it's years.
01:00:35.670 - 01:00:47.910, Speaker B: And it makes you question all these decisions. And I think it's a good reminder. It's just a good reminder when you see something that you're just, like, scratching your head over and just can't make sense of. You're just. You're not crazy, you know?
01:00:48.022 - 01:00:50.314, Speaker E: So, yeah, it makes me feel great.
01:00:53.444 - 01:01:01.244, Speaker B: All right, well, fellow turkeys, this has been a lot of fun, guys. Thanks for. Thanks for standing in. This was a super fun roundup.
01:01:01.364 - 01:01:02.364, Speaker E: Yeah, yeah.
01:01:02.404 - 01:01:03.140, Speaker C: Cheers, Mike.
01:01:03.252 - 01:01:04.660, Speaker D: Yeah, for sure. Thanks, guys.
01:01:04.772 - 01:01:05.116, Speaker E: See ya.
01:01:05.140 - 01:01:05.404, Speaker B: Cheers. All.
