00:00:00.520 - 00:00:20.902, Speaker A: This episode is brought to you by Se. Say's v two upgrade introduces the first high performance parallelized EVM. Already live on public Devnet Mainnet comes later in Q two. You can follow along with the SAI journey on X A network. Se is spelled S E. I go follow say on x say network. Hey, everyone.
00:00:20.902 - 00:00:55.722, Speaker A: The Polygon Community Grants program was launched with 1 billion tokens, all for Polygon builders. Really excited to share that on today's episode of Empire. Season one of the Polygon community grants program is now live. It features 35 million in Matic to support the next generation of Polygon projects. Join the aggregated future today by applying at Polygon technology grants. Big thanks to Polygon for sponsoring Empire. You're live.
00:00:55.722 - 00:00:57.950, Speaker A: You made it. You survived Brussels.
00:00:58.250 - 00:01:10.578, Speaker B: I survived Brussels. Shockingly, you know, like, my spidey senses go up. I grew up. I've traveled a lot. I grew up in Mexico. And so explain it to me.
00:01:10.594 - 00:01:25.756, Speaker A: Was there only. Was there one area of Brussels that people kept going? Or was it like. Cause I know there's the. Brussels is the highest crime rate in all of Europe. I saw a chart, robbery of robbery. So what, people were people walking around with, like, nice watches and they were getting scooped, or what was happening?
00:01:25.858 - 00:01:44.544, Speaker B: I don't really know. I mean, I knew of three people anecdotally. Look, robberies happen all the time in major cities. They happen all the time. This is sort of virtue of, like, law of large numbers. And I don't want to overly extrapolate. I'm not an expert on Brussels or, you know, the demographic changes or immigration policies or whatever.
00:01:44.544 - 00:02:17.370, Speaker B: I don't want to get into any of that. I just felt unsafe. London has become also really unsafe, particularly, like, street robberies. Like, they're seeing phones and watches. But apparently three people got robbed. One of them, I know, was walking in a pretty sketchy ghetto area of Brussels. But I read some of the comments and appears that a lot of them were, like, Brussels or Belgians that were commenting, and they're like, yeah, our country is really taking a toll.
00:02:17.370 - 00:02:58.432, Speaker B: I have a few friends that are from Brussels, and they no longer live there. But the event was in the main center, and there's a lot of the side events were very nearby. So, like, mega Eth had an event right next to the venue. I went and was speaking at a movement labs panel, and that was a bit farther north in the, like, Grand Central Station of sorts. Uh, it didn't help that it was, like, also torrentially raining so people can move around. So it's like biblical rain. I don't know what the universe is trying to tell.
00:02:58.456 - 00:03:01.368, Speaker A: What's going on with Greece. Crypto events in the rain. Dubai had that, too.
00:03:01.424 - 00:03:02.256, Speaker B: I know, I know.
00:03:02.288 - 00:03:18.164, Speaker A: So it seems like the consensus. So I saw. So I was talking to Mike. I'll just read one of Mike's public tweets. So last year's ECC was one of Mike's favorite events he's ever been to in several years of going to crypto events. And he tweeted this thing, July of 2023. He said ETHCC was electric.
00:03:18.164 - 00:03:43.172, Speaker A: I've never interacted with so many energized people focused on l two scaling account abstraction, Mev and ZK Tech. He wrote this whole thread about why it's so great. And he posted earlier today. He said, last year I left ECC enthused. This year, I'm struggling to identify a common theme from the conference. The event feels fragmented across many redundant, partially filled side events. And worst of all, no apps.
00:03:43.172 - 00:03:49.748, Speaker A: What? I don't know if that's a harsh take, but, like, what, what did the, what did it feel like on the ground for people who missed?
00:03:49.804 - 00:03:57.092, Speaker B: I really enjoyed it. I mean, I had all my meetings, like, in my hotel. I had eight meetings and everyone was there. Oh, I loved UCC.
00:03:57.196 - 00:04:01.868, Speaker A: Yeah. I stayed at the nicest hotel in Brussels, and I didn't leave once. I had people come to me.
00:04:02.004 - 00:04:14.410, Speaker B: Matter of fact, I did. I mean, I'm not gonna lie. I mean, it was as far as hotels goes, it was like, wasn't that special, but it was very convenient. I had all my meetings there.
00:04:15.510 - 00:04:19.486, Speaker A: Did you go to, go to the conference? Did anyone go to the actual event?
00:04:19.678 - 00:04:20.950, Speaker B: I don't know. I didn't.
00:04:21.070 - 00:04:21.326, Speaker A: No.
00:04:21.358 - 00:04:41.046, Speaker B: I mean, the point of these conferences are the people that are there. And then I get to meet. All my portfolio companies were there. And there was a few events, like, had I stayed, like, barachain was having their. A big event. Mega eth had a sequence of days of events. But again, the rain made it really hard to go to these.
00:04:41.046 - 00:04:59.050, Speaker B: So I was just able to go to the movement panel, and that was a really good discussion. And the second day, I met with Kane Casey, who's launching her fund called Topology and eight or ten Shane. I'm an early investor in polymarket. And so I caught up with Shane.
00:04:59.470 - 00:05:04.090, Speaker A: Oh, dude, I pinged Shane. He didn't respond to me. I want to do an episode with Shane and Nick Tomino.
00:05:04.870 - 00:05:24.758, Speaker B: Shane is. It was like unrec. Like, he's such a recognizable figure because he has this crazy hair. And so I could. I'm terrible with, like, spotting people, like, kind of autistically just walk and don't see people. But Shane, it's, like, impossible to, like, you know, miss. And so I saw him, like, multiple times.
00:05:24.854 - 00:05:25.510, Speaker A: Nice.
00:05:25.670 - 00:05:50.036, Speaker B: No, it was a good event. Look, I. So I can't comment on the content and the quality of the ECC itself, but there was a number of side events that were really good. So, yeah, I enjoyed it. There was a bit talic talk that is live and people can go watch, so I don't know if I'm going to watch it. Candidly, I'm not really sure.
00:05:50.108 - 00:05:57.520, Speaker A: Mike moderated a talk with Vitalik and anoma. I think that he said went well, but it seemed like Vitalik was everywhere.
00:05:58.020 - 00:05:59.260, Speaker B: He was hopping around, apparently.
00:05:59.300 - 00:05:59.900, Speaker A: Yeah, that's cool.
00:05:59.940 - 00:06:00.740, Speaker B: I didn't see him.
00:06:00.860 - 00:06:14.240, Speaker A: I saw a picture of Vitalik leaving. He, like, arrived in the rain. Like, people are talking about him like a godlike figure. It's like he arrived in the rain. He, like, leapt through the crowd, got on stage, despoke, and then left without a bodyguard. Like, who is this man?
00:06:15.700 - 00:06:18.364, Speaker B: Those bodyguards are the ones that you don't notice. Just saying.
00:06:18.492 - 00:06:19.320, Speaker A: It's true.
00:06:19.860 - 00:06:26.124, Speaker B: I would be. I mean, I wouldn't be celebrating the fact I'm actually concerned if he doesn't have a bodyguard.
00:06:26.172 - 00:06:46.300, Speaker A: Yeah, true. So it's interesting. So we have permissionless coming up in October, and side events are, like, the site basically every single. So, you know, like, one of the ways that we make money is, like, sponsorships at conferences. Like, people buy, like, a booth, or they buy, like, an activation or whatever it is.
00:06:46.380 - 00:06:54.524, Speaker B: You mean a booth. Or there's gonna be full of, like, a waiting room, peloton, treadmill, a juice bar, and cold brew coffee.
00:06:54.612 - 00:07:08.392, Speaker A: For those who want a little insight into my conversation with Santi, I'm trying to convince Santi to pay, like, ten k to put his face all over a booth that just has a squat rack and a deadlift. I'm making progress, but, yeah, I might.
00:07:08.416 - 00:07:10.900, Speaker B: Not even go to this conference, but, yeah, sure, I'll.
00:07:12.720 - 00:07:31.164, Speaker A: Yeah, anyways, so, anyways, we. So the con. So it used to be. Here's the history. It's like everyone, like, in every industry, people just, like, spot. They sponsor, like, the conference, and there's always, like, some things around the conference, but, like, they sponsor the conference, and there's thousands of people walking around on this huge show floor, and there's, like, booths and whatever. It's valuable.
00:07:31.164 - 00:08:14.250, Speaker A: It's almost like a mini. The way I think about it is like a marketplace gets built in three days and then torn down. There's like a marketplace that's an IRL marketplace. And when the money shifted out of the hands of the C five companies like Anchorage and copper and fireblocks and Coinbase, they're all very used to doing those kinds of sponsorships. The money shifted to the protocols. So, and when you go to a protocol like arbitrum or movement or aptos or Sui or Monad or whoever it is, and you talk about normal sponsorships, at some point, I don't know when this happened, it started seeming like the uncool thing to sponsor, like, just sponsor a booth, basically. And what everybody wanted to do was host side events.
00:08:14.250 - 00:08:38.662, Speaker A: So in 2021 and 2022, that actually, that actually was a great strategy. Like, the side events were like the places to be. You remember, like Breakpoint, Solana. Those side events were like, theyre amazing. 2023, everyone ran out of money. So the side events actually continued to be good because there were so few companies that could host a side event that it felt very exclusive and rare and unique, and you couldnt get into them. So they also remained good.
00:08:38.662 - 00:09:05.224, Speaker A: 2024, I shit you not, Santi. You talked to 100 companies for, like, about permissionless. 95 want to host a side event. So I think people saw it sounds like you had your agenda at ECC. But what I'm hearing from, we had twelve people on the ground at ECC. The side events were so fragmented and all over the place that it really took away from the value of the conference. And I think we've seen, like, I would call ECC.
00:09:05.224 - 00:09:31.232, Speaker A: I wasn't there. But, like, peak. I think we've hit the top on these side events, and I think you'll start seeing people if you're like a monad or a movement or like a hot name, I would say, go ahead or, like, put penguin pudgies or whatever, like, host a side event. But, like, most people should not be hosting their own side events. Go host a dinner or something. But I'm also very biased because I want, I don't know. I'm as biased, I'm as biased as you can get.
00:09:31.232 - 00:10:11.378, Speaker A: Like, truly, because our part of our revenue comes from people sponsoring our event and not hosting a side event. But, like, if I were in the shoes of an event marketer, I'm doing three things at permissionless. I'm hosting a dinner, I'm hosting a private dinner, and I'm buying a booth, truly, because I think a booth is like a very easy way to go. Talk to three to 4000 of your ideal customers or users. I'm doing some sort of weird activation. If I have a lot of money and I'm a big brand and I know that everyone wants to be around me, I'll host a party. But if it's not, if I'm not one of those brands, don't try to go create your own thing like you, like, go to where everyone else is.
00:10:11.378 - 00:10:14.750, Speaker A: So that's my take. That's my take.
00:10:16.450 - 00:10:45.978, Speaker B: Well, yeah, you know, I don't like, to be honest, I'm not a big fan of conferences. They like, I like going to them because that is the highest concentration that I can, like, meet people that I've never met in real life. And I want to kind of just get a feeling for the founder. I was like looking, I'm looking at two deals. They were there. I want to meet them. I want to see them in the, like, in real life, how they interact.
00:10:45.978 - 00:10:57.350, Speaker B: Sometimes I'm there to watch people without just observing how they behave. I've learned a lot over the years of just good and bad, but mostly bad, actually.
00:10:57.890 - 00:11:05.390, Speaker A: There's that Sonti guy again, sitting in the corner looking at the founders. Why is notes on that guy?
00:11:06.260 - 00:11:36.776, Speaker B: No, no, but it's good to do diligence and just get an understanding of the sentiment, how people are perceiving a number of attendance. I don't really go to the talks themselves. One, it's impossible to. A lot of times the quality of the audio sucks. ETH conferences are really bad location wise and organization wise. And the joke at Defcon in Osaka was just a putter. Perspective master venue, four different floors, and there was like two elevators for the entire conference.
00:11:36.776 - 00:12:16.884, Speaker B: I'm like, and this was at a time where there was no l, two s, and the joke was, okay, yeah, this is the congestion of the network in real, like, you're seeing it, right? And then, like, who in the right mind decided to pick Brussels as a conference spot? But like, practically speaking, no security, by the way. Like, and so, like, really, guys like Bogota, like, okay, Cancun. There's issues with the Cancun and Defcon. So I think we ought to be a bit of a. More thoughtful as an industry where we organize these things. Seriously. And I think there were a number of incidents, so it's like, important to see, but I get it.
00:12:16.884 - 00:12:35.534, Speaker B: So anyways, I don't go to these talks. I bookmark them and I then listen. And then two x a speed, because that's just more efficient. But I'm there just to meet with people. And if it's at a side event, then all the better. If it's not, is it at a hotel room, at a restaurant? Great. And a lot of deal making happens there, I think.
00:12:35.582 - 00:12:36.222, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:12:36.406 - 00:12:37.502, Speaker B: So it's good.
00:12:37.606 - 00:13:00.352, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. I mean, my thesis on conferences is just very simple. It's as the world gets more digital, the value of IRL connections goes up, basically because the frequency of IRL connections will go down, but the value of those connections will, will go up and like, there'll be more efficient connections. So instead of going to an office every day, like now, you're seeing someone only when you are thinking about investing in them, for example.
00:13:00.416 - 00:13:08.768, Speaker B: So, and to tell you the truth, uh, it doesn't have to just be at a conference, but the conference sort of forces you to mostly talk to builders.
00:13:08.824 - 00:13:22.872, Speaker A: It's just a shelling point for everyone to convene. Like, my vision for permissionless is simply like all the people on crypto Twitter who you think of, like bring them together in one place. Like Da DA is different. Das is more like institutional crowd. But like, that's, that's what I'm trying to do with permissionless.
00:13:22.976 - 00:14:06.066, Speaker B: Yeah. What I'm trying to say is a lot of times in this market environment, then we can talk about sort of traders take over and the timeline like they're commenting on the charts and 200 moving averages or 200 day moving averages and whatnot. Going to these conferences. For the most part, there's a lot of builders there. And I just really, whenever there's, in moments like these, it's really helpful to just talk to builders because you realize, like the building continues to happen. And a lot of times builders don't even pay attention to price. Some of the best ones just unfazed by the price and just continue building.
00:14:06.066 - 00:14:48.370, Speaker B: And so I think going to these conferences really resets that mindset because it could be really easy to get caught up in the sentiment of price and what have you. I generally think conferences are a good reset to. I saw and talked to a number of people that said, yeah, it was really energizing to go to the conference, to talk to builders, to see the excitement in the room of just all the different things that are being tried. And so, yeah, from that standpoint, I did come back more energized from the conference, having met with, it could be one really good meeting or two really good meetings, or just someone come up to you saying, hey, I really enjoyed the podcast. I was like shit. That makes my day more so than a hundred x. Seriously.
00:14:48.370 - 00:14:54.170, Speaker B: Not to say like it's great to get 100 x. Don't get me wrong, it only happens so very often.
00:14:55.430 - 00:14:59.902, Speaker A: This is when I see you tweeting about the social layer, not the financial layer. The social layers complement well.
00:14:59.926 - 00:15:30.810, Speaker B: Well to put a comment on that, I was talking to Smokey from, from Barochain and they had a big event that I. So I reach out to them say I'm leaving but I can't go to the event. And then I'm talking to this company called Papa like vape to earn. And the whole idea is to allow help people to transition away from smoking to vaping, then eventually habitually to wane off of nicotine and the bad parts of what caused actually lung cancer and the addiction component of it. And we were talking about.
00:15:33.830 - 00:15:34.238, Speaker A: A lot.
00:15:34.254 - 00:16:17.332, Speaker B: Of what is in the narrative right now is talking about airdrops are broken, its hyper financialized, were not building apps, its just a casino. Its a common thing that we hear certainly from the outside world. More so now internally when price goes up, none of this gets talked about. But when price doesnt go up, people start being critical of these things. I dont know. In that conversation with Smokey we were just talking about something like play to earn was very much dismissed because the price of axie went down and the price of Stepn went down. And then everyone is dismissive of a category because the price went down but doesn't care to.
00:16:17.332 - 00:16:57.382, Speaker B: Deep down. Look at. I'm still quite constructive and bullish on this coordination and getting people to do things, not just because it's a financial return. And it's easy to think about an airdrop, think about just the financialization, like the financial component of an incentive. But there's just so many instances and we've talked about it in the social layer, like in the context of forentech and time fun and all these things that like sometimes humans just want to do things because of their good because it brings something else other than a monetary reward. Yeah and anyways, I think those are the type of applications that like earned nfts are really interesting. Like badges, po apps.
00:16:57.382 - 00:17:36.246, Speaker B: These are things that are not new. Yeah I just don't think protocols experiment with them enough. Because the attachment, the emotional attachment that you have to things that you earn I think is greater than things that you can just buy. Sort of. It was like the jewelry, like watches for instance. You can buy one and sure but there are certain timepieces that they're useful because they remind you of particular moments in time when you get married, when you have your first kid, when your parents gave it to you, when you're in a particular milestone in your life. They're like mementos that, like, evoke a certain memory.
00:17:36.246 - 00:17:52.850, Speaker B: The same that a song that you haven't listened to in five years comes on. You're like, I remember exactly where I was because it conjures up a memory. And so I think, like, for that reason, I don't think people, I think the design space for, like, the social layer, not community.
00:17:53.310 - 00:17:54.050, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:17:54.550 - 00:18:03.900, Speaker B: Is very unexplored. And that was a theme that I talked to three different founders at the conference.
00:18:04.320 - 00:18:05.072, Speaker A: I agree with that.
00:18:05.136 - 00:18:06.344, Speaker B: They all seem to agree.
00:18:06.472 - 00:18:10.968, Speaker A: Yeah. I was looking at, do you know the app called gas? Do you know who Nikita beer is?
00:18:11.104 - 00:18:11.760, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:18:11.920 - 00:18:41.884, Speaker A: So I was looking at gas by Nikita Beer. Someone posted a product video of gas which I think he sold to discord or Facebook. And he's a phenomenal consumer builder, I'd say, which a lot of people are not able to do. There hasn't really been huge consumer hits in a long time. And it got me thinking about actually the same thing, but on a product incentivization level. So, like, the way I've been thinking about this is there's three ways to incentivize users. There's financial incentives, product incentives, and social incentives.
00:18:41.884 - 00:19:12.696, Speaker A: So a social incentive might be, like, what you're talking about, Santi, just like, getting people on board. And, like, I think a good example of this might be Snapchat streaks. I don't know if you view, I don't use Snapchat, but if you hang out with, like, a 13 year old, like, they have, like, a 2000 day streak going. And like, everyone in their, in their, like, 6th grade class is talking about, like, how, like, how long is your streak? Like, that's the social incentive. A product incentive is like building a product that is just very addictive. Like, people should look. Well, I'll link in the show notes to Nikita Beer's gas app.
00:19:12.696 - 00:19:34.972, Speaker A: Like, it's the way that they walk you through making a decision and getting you to click. The next thing is very, it's like, it's, it's a product incentive. Like, TikTok is another product incentive. Like, they've made the product so good that it's addicting. And everyone in crypto is focused on the third bucket, which is the financial incentive. Not enough for focus on the product incentive and the social incentive.
00:19:35.156 - 00:20:09.770, Speaker B: I'll tell you one observation. Maybe you agree or disagree with this. Price going down. Even when price goes up a lot, I actually get more stress when price goes up, much more when price goes down. It's actually, my brain is just wired differently, I guess after so many years, humans, I think it's like over 70 plus percent of people experience loneliness at some point. And at some point, meaning, like, over the last year or last couple of years, that trend is on the rise. If you think that money is going to cover that, you're very wrong.
00:20:09.770 - 00:20:47.270, Speaker B: Extremely, extremely wrong. Money does not cover it. Certainly can help the best. And I actually first heard it from Kobe. But it's great not to have to think about certain things, putting food on the table. Like, if you think about the hierarchy of needs, of Maslow, like, okay, that's like, once you break through that, that's amazing. Everyone should hopefully get to that point where you don't have to think about if your coffee costs a dollar or five or ten and you stop thinking about those things, and it frees up your memory space to think about other things that are far, perhaps more interesting.
00:20:47.270 - 00:21:32.388, Speaker B: But apps above that level, wherever that may be, and wherever you live, between 100 to 100,000 a year or whatever, or maybe even less. When price goes down or price goes up, people think that they need more money and they're going to cure loneliness. And it's actually not true at all. And so I think what I'm trying to get at is a crypto. If you argue that crypto's only value is financialization, you're sort of missing the point that crypto is highly entertaining. Yes, it's very engaging because you're transacting value. And value takes up different meanings when you can tokenize and express it in the crypto context, like digital scarce contest of capturing attention, tokenizing it in some way.
00:21:32.388 - 00:22:23.860, Speaker B: And so I don't think that to say that everyone is in crypto just because they're fully interested in making money, I think misses the point that I think crypto is also touching a very powerful nerve here, which is addressing the loneliness problem that people have and that may or may not be fixed. But I'm a believer in that. Don't get me wrong. I do think there are a lot of people come here because they want to make money and then at some point, end up thinking that making money will fix their loneliness problem. But along the way, it's that meme, the friends that we make along the way. And I think part of that is true. You know, it rings true, because I think I don't think anyways, I'll just say that I don't think if you agree or disagree that there is far more reasons or there is more reasons why people are here than just making money.
00:22:23.860 - 00:22:49.666, Speaker B: I would argue that it's a vast majority, but we can debate whether it's the primary or secondary reason. I don't really care, but I don't know. I think there's a big opportunity to create, like to tap into that.
00:22:49.778 - 00:22:54.930, Speaker A: Do you think play to earn? Like the play to earn and move to earn things will come back this cycle?
00:22:55.050 - 00:23:32.350, Speaker B: Yeah, 100%. Yeah. For instance, I've always felt that Strava should have already done this to some extent, but they haven't. The biggest criticisms of play to earn is that it's not sustainable to get paid dollar 50 to walk a mile. And then obviously these economies are not sustainable in that shape or form. Um, but I think we're going to start seeing it particularly in some, like my shell, you know, where you're, you're basically incentivizing people to do something. They're going to earn some reward.
00:23:32.350 - 00:23:53.790, Speaker B: But, but the counteract, like the network effects that you have in, in for instance, monetizing your own model, um, or even being able to use a model that has been trained with human data from say that you want to learn a language, you're learning Romanian. You know, you're, you're giving feedback to that, to that model. And then I can use that if I want to learn Romanian. By the way, I know you're learning Romanian.
00:23:53.910 - 00:23:58.010, Speaker A: Romanian, Romanian is the language. Romanian is the language that you trust, sir.
00:24:00.590 - 00:24:33.070, Speaker B: Esoteric language. I'm trying to say like some sort of, or whatever. What I'm trying to say is that like, yeah, maybe you're, you're, you're earning some tokens, you can monetize that model. But I think that the network effects that you can get in certain verticals are really interesting and they don't require, they don't require that much of ongoing supply sinks to incentivize people to stay in that economy and to transact in that economy. Whereas Axie was difficult, because Axie wasn't a game. It was actually not a really fun game. It was difficult.
00:24:33.070 - 00:24:36.538, Speaker B: So anyways, well, I think on the.
00:24:36.554 - 00:25:01.580, Speaker A: Strava note, imagine you had a Strava. Imagine Strava was built as a crypto app. The thing that it would probably get wrong is trying to incentivize users too much financially. And what Strava got right is realizing that it's just like Strava's a social app for runners and bikers, and it's like, you get leaderboards, you can compete against your friends.
00:25:01.620 - 00:25:02.404, Speaker B: King of the hill, baby.
00:25:02.452 - 00:25:09.828, Speaker A: King of the Hill. Yeah, so, yeah, absolutely. Speaking of that, I have. I found a good YouTube comment for you.
00:25:10.004 - 00:25:11.040, Speaker B: Here we go.
00:25:12.020 - 00:25:17.440, Speaker A: New Santi looks skinnier than old Santi. Running is starting to kill the Empire podcast.
00:25:19.240 - 00:25:21.060, Speaker B: Feed me, whoever you are.
00:25:23.200 - 00:25:29.980, Speaker A: All right, here's one. Funny how Santi is like a bitcoin maxi, but about tennis, he only plays, quote, real sports, not pickleball.
00:25:30.320 - 00:25:33.184, Speaker B: Correct. Very much wherever you are.
00:25:33.312 - 00:25:38.048, Speaker A: True. Excellent, excellent observation regarding vampire attacks.
00:25:38.104 - 00:25:39.800, Speaker B: Yeah, Wimbledon happening right now.
00:25:39.840 - 00:25:55.740, Speaker A: Ready regarding. Yeah, it is. Wimbledon's been good. I've been watching regard and then olympics coming up. Um, regarding vampire attacks. Yano, you're so pale that the vampire reference seems appropriate for you. Sorry, sorry, dude.
00:25:55.740 - 00:26:01.112, Speaker A: Tough, tough. I am trying to get some color here. Uh, I'm out. I'm out.
00:26:01.136 - 00:26:03.936, Speaker B: Uh, in Long island somewhere.
00:26:04.008 - 00:26:04.384, Speaker A: Somewhere.
00:26:04.432 - 00:26:06.700, Speaker B: Yeah, somewhere in Long island.
00:26:07.280 - 00:26:10.576, Speaker A: Strong island. Uh, yeah, getting some color out here.
00:26:10.608 - 00:26:28.712, Speaker B: So, by the way, can we. Can we address something? Because it is summer in the northern hemisphere, there have been increasing number of shark attacks there. I only have one phobia and it's sharks. I watched way too many jaws growing up, by the way, in Lego. Lego just launched a jaws Lego set, which is both fascinating, horrifying at the same time.
00:26:28.776 - 00:26:30.792, Speaker A: How scared are you of sharks? Like, are you.
00:26:30.816 - 00:26:32.740, Speaker B: I don't do open water triathlons.
00:26:33.320 - 00:26:34.312, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, you're scared.
00:26:34.416 - 00:26:44.796, Speaker B: Just don't. Yeah, no, you could. You could start saying you could scream shark, and I'm going to pull all. Get out. It's irrational. I get it. I know, I know.
00:26:44.948 - 00:26:54.724, Speaker A: So you have an. You have an ira. Like, there are rational fears. Like, I grew up in on the west coast. Like, and you don't really want to go surfing at, like, Stinson beach because there. There might be sharks in the water. And that's a very.
00:26:54.724 - 00:26:57.572, Speaker A: I'd call that rational. Like, you have an irrational.
00:26:57.676 - 00:26:58.964, Speaker B: Yeah. I mean, probabilistically.
00:26:59.052 - 00:26:59.300, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:26:59.340 - 00:27:18.554, Speaker B: Like, I know the probability is really low. That being said, there have been an increasing number of attacks in a particular places like the hamptons. Uh, South Patrick island is a hotbed in Texas, which is a popular destination. Um, there was like three. There was like three. There was three shark attacks in the span of an hour. The shark just went crazy.
00:27:18.554 - 00:27:25.306, Speaker B: The theory is that sharks are getting hungry because the temperature of the water is rising and so their metabolic rate goes up. And so I don't really know I think.
00:27:25.338 - 00:27:30.550, Speaker A: Isn't there a thesis that the water is getting warmer so they can actually come closer into the beach as well?
00:27:31.300 - 00:27:33.596, Speaker B: Uh, that may be true as well. I don't know.
00:27:33.708 - 00:27:37.572, Speaker A: Uh, or maybe they would want cold water, actually. Maybe. No, I think I actually, I think.
00:27:37.596 - 00:27:50.396, Speaker B: I think the temperature is more so that their metabolic rates, they require more food and. Yeah, like, there's a bunch of humans there. Anyways, watch out, folks. Like, I signed up for a half iron man, by the way, so I'm not just gonna get skinnier. Um, but, uh.
00:27:50.468 - 00:27:51.772, Speaker A: Have you done a full ironman?
00:27:51.916 - 00:27:56.140, Speaker B: No, no, I've done, like, five halves at this point.
00:27:56.260 - 00:27:58.240, Speaker A: So where will. Where will you swim?
00:27:58.770 - 00:27:59.602, Speaker B: In a lake.
00:27:59.706 - 00:28:11.990, Speaker A: In a lake? See, lakes freak me out. Lakes are filled with, like, a loch ness monster. No, like those little, uh. You know, I actually watched a movie as a kid of, uh, piranhas.
00:28:12.930 - 00:28:16.234, Speaker B: Uh, yeah, I know piranhas are only in the Amazon, I believe.
00:28:16.362 - 00:28:16.666, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:28:16.698 - 00:28:21.386, Speaker B: But barracudas are really nasty creatures. But they're like, I think, in a saltwater.
00:28:21.498 - 00:28:21.722, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:28:21.746 - 00:28:44.060, Speaker B: But, you know, the most dangerous we can go. The most dangerous, um, place to go swimming is where river meets ocean because there's so much sediment and nutrients in the water. It's full of crocodiles and sharks. Like, places like where the river just disembarks the riverbank into the ocean, like in the brazil and whatever.
00:28:45.360 - 00:28:46.144, Speaker A: Good to know.
00:28:46.232 - 00:28:48.952, Speaker B: Good to know that crypto is slow. And we're talking about.
00:28:49.016 - 00:29:17.304, Speaker A: Honestly, I was prepping for this pod being like, what am. What are we. What are we talking about? I mean, there's this. So I went. I went on chopping block on the Laura shins chopping block with Haseeb and Tom and Robert yesterday and foolish week to go on because they basically just grilled me for an hour about why media companies should exist and our op ed and Celcis podcast and tough, tough, tough, tough episode. But, yeah, I mean, what happened this week, there was, like, selling. There was a.
00:29:17.352 - 00:29:18.912, Speaker B: Well, there was a couple. Mount Gox.
00:29:18.976 - 00:29:19.832, Speaker A: Mount Gox in Germany.
00:29:19.856 - 00:29:26.964, Speaker B: There's a couple things Germany has sized down. They had three and a half billion bitcoin. Now they're down to 700.
00:29:27.012 - 00:29:29.276, Speaker A: And I think two. They have 50,000 bitcoins.
00:29:29.308 - 00:29:32.716, Speaker B: So, like, three, 3 billion, however you slice it.
00:29:32.748 - 00:29:41.360, Speaker A: So that was from somewhat. That was from a. They shut down. It was seized from the operator of movie two k. Right. Which is the privacy or the piracy?
00:29:41.780 - 00:29:43.060, Speaker B: It was all seized. Bitcoin.
00:29:43.140 - 00:29:43.732, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:29:43.876 - 00:30:09.012, Speaker B: They never acquired it, to my understanding. And then they. They've been liquidating it. I think they've liquidated over two thirds of the position. Right. Because they had, call it 3 billion, they're now two down to 700. But they've been like, whoever is running this, they've sent, like, they've sent bitcoin mostly to coinbase Kraken, and I think bit stamp, I believe, uh, it's like unsophisticated.
00:30:09.116 - 00:30:13.772, Speaker A: They. Yeah, I was thinking they should have just hired a trader for like one hundred twenty k, twenty two year old.
00:30:13.796 - 00:30:40.490, Speaker B: And just like, it's just, I mean, obviously it's very telegraph when they send it to an exchange, but it's, it's like very messy. I mean, you kind of have a fiduciary responsibility to like, get best execution. I don't think they are, really. Yeah, it doesn't surprise me. I mean, Germany shut down their last remaining nuclear reactor right when the Ukraine war started. So it's like someone great tweet was like, so let me get this straight. They're selling bitcoin for euros, which they can print.
00:30:40.490 - 00:30:44.290, Speaker B: Got it. Okay. Got it. That will age well.
00:30:44.630 - 00:31:21.730, Speaker A: Anyways, there is actually an interesting geopolitical, if you think about. Here's an interesting geopolitical thing I was thinking about is if you think about bitcoin not as bitcoin the asset, but as a scarce commodity that nation states will want to get their hands on one day. What Germany is doing is basically sending a precious commodity into the market. And El Salvador tweeted that they were buying. So you're essentially sending take out bitcoin. Think of it like oil or whatever. I am sending precious commodity into the market and sending it to another nation state that is then taking my precious commodity.
00:31:21.730 - 00:31:37.330, Speaker A: And I think there's an interesting geopolitical angle that's not really talked about today. But fast forward, probably not this cycle, but probably five years, the geopolitical aspects of owning the bitcoin will, I think, become a popular topic.
00:31:38.470 - 00:31:57.096, Speaker B: Yeah, we'll see. I mean, all governments can always continue to print money, right. But it's sort of. The market will halt you to your knees if you're not the de facto reserve currency that is a dollar. Other countries don't have that favored status. Yeah, but, yeah, I don't know. I mean, it's.
00:31:57.096 - 00:32:07.360, Speaker B: I can understand why they're doing it. You know, three and a half billion in their grand scheme thinks is peanuts for a government. But, you know, still, it may not over time. We'll see.
00:32:08.860 - 00:32:38.548, Speaker A: This episode is brought to you by, say, sei's belief about the world, I think, is a good one. They believe that the EVM is here to stay. Agree with that. They believe that the EVM is going to look kind of like what JavaScript ended up looking like in the web two world. Agree with that. They also believe that the EVM in its current iteration lacks a lot of the performance and scalability that developers need. So what say has done with their V two upgrade is they just introduced the first high performance, parallelized EVM into the market today.
00:32:38.548 - 00:33:22.906, Speaker A: They've got lightning fast block times and finality of just 390 milliseconds. What this does is it unlocks an entirely new design space with 100 x the throughput of even some of the fastest EVM l two s on the market today, save V two is now live on public Devnet with main net scheduled for Q two. You can stay up to date with, say on Xdev at say, network. Sei network. Big things to say. This episode is brought to you by Polygon. Polygon Labs is developing the next generation of open source zero knowledge tech to aggregate crypto, liquidity and user bases, empowering developers to grow in a unified web of interoperable chains with the AG layer.
00:33:22.906 - 00:33:43.788, Speaker A: That was a big mouthful. So I'm going to tell you what it means. My. In my words, there's all these things popping up, l two s and l three s, and it's chaos. Right? If you are building something, you no longer have to worry about bootstrapping liquidity. You can basically just build in the ag layer to tap into the liquidity of the ag layer and the users of the ag layer. You get the users, you get the liquidity.
00:33:43.788 - 00:34:06.318, Speaker A: It's the ag layer. It's hot, it's by Polygon Labs, they've got the Polygon community grants program. It was launched with 1 billion tokens just for Polygon builders. Season one. It's live right now. It features 35 million in Matic to support the next generation of polygon builders. Join the aggregated future today by applying at Polygon Technology forward slash grants.
00:34:06.318 - 00:34:19.810, Speaker A: That's Polygon dot technology forward slash grants. If you talk to anyone, let them know. Blockwork sent you. I have a quiz question for you. What do you think has performed better this year? Nvidia or Coinbase stock?
00:34:20.840 - 00:34:26.140, Speaker B: Coinbase. No, no, actually, Coinbase is up 60%.
00:34:27.000 - 00:34:28.360, Speaker A: Interesting question. Right.
00:34:28.480 - 00:34:45.380, Speaker B: It's been choppy, though. It's 221. It went all the way. It's been actually. Let's see. Actually, funny, I have like this chart where it compares Coinbase, Nvidia actually, Coinbase is up 38% this year. Right.
00:34:45.860 - 00:35:01.044, Speaker A: So on the twelve month here, here's. I just pulled up the twelve month chart, sorry, is 2024. But look at, look at the twelve month chart. Twelve month chart. Coinbase was actually tracking ahead of Nvidia for the last eleven months and Nvidia just, just overtook Coin.
00:35:01.132 - 00:35:22.150, Speaker B: So it's seeing much more. No, so I just looked at it now. Nvidia is up 170% year to date and Coinbase is only up 40%.
00:35:23.170 - 00:35:31.450, Speaker A: Yeah, look at this chart. Yeah. Coin is up year over year 180 and Nvidia is up 205.
00:35:31.530 - 00:35:33.322, Speaker B: Oh, I said year to date. You're saying year over year.
00:35:33.346 - 00:35:35.350, Speaker A: Like I was saying year over year. Twelve months.
00:35:36.290 - 00:35:40.830, Speaker B: Okay. Yeah, yeah, that's right. It just flipped. Right. It's like today actually.
00:35:40.990 - 00:35:41.310, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:35:41.350 - 00:35:52.438, Speaker B: Is that right? Yeah, Coinbase, they're actually on par. Nvidia on a one year. I'm looking at like trading view right now. One year, Nvidia 195.36%. Coinbase 196.38%.
00:35:52.494 - 00:35:54.286, Speaker A: Yeah, that's an interesting chart to follow.
00:35:54.318 - 00:35:59.330, Speaker B: Today, ladies and gentlemen. Yeah, yeah, it was. I mean, there's, there's been a number of. But yeah.
00:36:00.030 - 00:36:05.278, Speaker A: Shout out David Canelis. Go, go. Subscribe to the Empire newsletter. We were talking about this. Good, good little piece of.
00:36:05.334 - 00:36:17.860, Speaker B: What do you make of that, by the way? Okay, so if you fast forward question, let's make a poly market prediction market here, or just look at options. What outperforms over the next twelve months? Nvidia or Coinbase?
00:36:19.080 - 00:36:21.060, Speaker A: Next twelve months Coinbase for sure.
00:36:23.280 - 00:36:24.104, Speaker B: Interesting.
00:36:24.232 - 00:36:26.980, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay, what do you think?
00:36:30.920 - 00:36:31.824, Speaker B: I'm just trying to think of a.
00:36:31.832 - 00:36:43.260, Speaker A: Scenario because think of like, Nvidia is up. Overdose. Over the last two years. This chart looks very differently. Last two years, Nvidia is up. I mean, what, 1000%? Probably.
00:36:44.560 - 00:37:18.898, Speaker B: Well, yeah, yes. The question though is do they outperform? Like the second question of that is, is a return positive or are both negative? So they both go down, which goes down more. Because if you assume, if both go down, it's maybe a macro thing, like macro takes a shit. Everything's down on a relative basis. What has a higher beta will probably coinbase. And so. But I get your point, Nvidia has rallied quite a bit.
00:37:18.898 - 00:37:21.562, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's difficult to say.
00:37:21.666 - 00:37:23.670, Speaker A: Do you own more coin or more Nvidia?
00:37:24.410 - 00:37:26.200, Speaker B: More coin, yeah.
00:37:27.020 - 00:37:27.484, Speaker A: What else?
00:37:27.532 - 00:37:36.520, Speaker B: Actually, I don't know because some of the products may have, definitely have Nvidia exposure and. Yeah, it's tricky. I actually don't have a good answer to that.
00:37:38.140 - 00:37:57.510, Speaker A: I have another stat for you here. Okay, I'll throw it up on the screen. Blackrock's bittle fund, their money market, money market tokenized money market fund passed 500 million in assets. I think it's the first money market tokenized money market fund to pass half a billion.
00:37:58.170 - 00:38:04.138, Speaker B: Yeah. And just for context for people to know, like this biddle, they're like tokenizing treasuries.
00:38:04.314 - 00:38:06.390, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:38:09.170 - 00:38:11.790, Speaker B: That's been one of the hottest narratives this year. Right? Like Ondo.
00:38:16.690 - 00:38:39.972, Speaker A: Oh, okay, here's one for you. And then we might have to call this early. I feel like I'm grasping the straws here. Tell me what you make of this story. Coindesk reported this story. Hold on, I'll pull this up top crypto VC says ex general partner made undisclosed side deal with portfolio company Polychain. Says Niraj broke the fund's policies by secretly accepting advisor tokens from Eclipse.
00:38:40.076 - 00:38:45.458, Speaker B: So what they 5% down to 1.36% worth 13.6 million.
00:38:45.564 - 00:39:03.094, Speaker A: Basically what it seems like happened is Niraj led the eclipse deal when he was at polychain. And I know actually Neil, the founder of Eclipse, was sleeping on Niraj's couch for a couple of months. And maybe there were some side dealings where it says, hey, if you can.
00:39:03.102 - 00:39:06.810, Speaker B: Help, sentence can be very misconstrued.
00:39:07.950 - 00:39:26.700, Speaker A: Maybe there was something that said, hey, nirajdev, if you, uh, if you get polychain to lead this round, I'll give you some advisor. I'll, I'll, I'll give you some side tokens. And by the way, thanks for letting me sleep on your couch for a couple of months. Um, and do. I mean, like, what, what do you make of this?
00:39:27.440 - 00:39:42.690, Speaker B: Obviously, it's not about board, right? Yeah. And I mean, it's a good, actually very good reporting. Um, people should go read the article if they're interested. Yeah, it's, I mean, it's not a good look.
00:39:42.730 - 00:39:45.234, Speaker A: I mean, just worth $13 million. Interesting.
00:39:45.282 - 00:39:54.802, Speaker B: Today. Yeah, the last round. Yeah. That is on the revised allocation that he got. He initially got 5%, which is crazy to give someone 5%.
00:39:54.826 - 00:39:55.938, Speaker A: He gave him 5%.
00:39:55.994 - 00:39:59.834, Speaker B: That's 5% of a company. I mean, unheard of, right? He had more equity.
00:39:59.882 - 00:40:02.452, Speaker A: What is this bizarre ad that is running on coindesks?
00:40:02.546 - 00:40:25.660, Speaker B: So this is tough for razor. Oh, tough, are you? This is some retargeting things anyways, you're. So initially, the initial allocation, advisor allocation was 5% and then that was revised down 1.33%.
00:40:26.160 - 00:40:32.130, Speaker A: Wow. So that would. So they would have given him enough token at the 5% that's worth like $50 million?
00:40:34.030 - 00:40:54.730, Speaker B: Yeah, pretty much. Well, and so I think it got rise down as a company's valuation continued to go up. But, yeah, the TLDR is you have to disclose these things and obviously it's a conflict of interest. Right. If you're a partner, you're personally getting allocation before, like, it's sort of like huge conflict of interest.
00:40:56.560 - 00:41:08.780, Speaker A: Spearheaded the precede. He spearheaded the precede deal. This is very good reporting. He spearheaded the precede deal. And a coindesk investigation revealed that around the same time he was allotted about as many eclipse crypto tokens as polychain itself.
00:41:10.440 - 00:41:24.230, Speaker B: Yeah, tough. The rule of thumb here is if you're going to get some sort of advisory tokens or whatever, and you're working at the fund, you're doing the deal. Those advisory tokens go into the fund to lower the valuation.
00:41:26.330 - 00:41:29.350, Speaker A: Is that so? If you're an employee, you kind of have to send that back.
00:41:30.290 - 00:41:56.038, Speaker B: You contribute them into the fund first you disclose it second, it goes into the fund. There are. So I guess the lawyers can comment on this, but like take an example. Bain Capital. Bain is also has a management consulting arm there or a private equity fund that has a huge management. They're going to go in and like do some operations work and they're going to get paid some sort of fee to do some management consulting or whatever. It's part of the company that they're investing in.
00:41:56.038 - 00:42:18.610, Speaker B: Maybe in that case you have this revenue goes to the operating unit of Blackstone or KKR, this private equity fund, like the operators themselves that are going in and fixing. Not to the LP's, but in this case it was just advisory tokens. It just goes to effectively lower the valuation, the entry point, because you're getting more equity for a pre determined price.
00:42:19.320 - 00:42:19.632, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:42:19.656 - 00:42:26.860, Speaker B: The other thing we should probably point out is the name of the company. It's the psychological operations company, the Psyops company. It's just simulation.
00:42:27.520 - 00:42:33.936, Speaker A: I always love seeing what people name their holding companies and Niraj named it the Psyops company.
00:42:34.048 - 00:42:42.540, Speaker B: Yeah. Well, it'll be interesting to see because obviously Niraj has left Polychain. He started ritual, which is this AI company. Polychain is also an investor in that company.
00:42:44.250 - 00:42:45.350, Speaker A: Are you an investor?
00:42:46.090 - 00:42:50.110, Speaker B: No. You got to wonder why this came out just now.
00:42:50.610 - 00:42:52.642, Speaker A: It's like, I mean, I would assume.
00:42:52.666 - 00:42:54.630, Speaker B: It'S either someone off at.
00:42:55.010 - 00:43:05.010, Speaker A: I would assume it's because of the man on the screen here. I would assume Olaf needed a little scapegoat. To take the fall for their eclipse investment. That would be my.
00:43:05.050 - 00:43:26.550, Speaker B: I mean, usually if you're leading around, you're doing diligence. You require to see advisory agreements, cap table, prior cap table. And it would have been, I guess maybe the psychological ops company came out and it was under that entity and they didn't see who the beneficial owner of that was an employee of theirs. The partner was leading the deal. But, yeah, I don't know.
00:43:27.690 - 00:43:32.810, Speaker A: This is tough. Niraj's original token allocation is larger than the current CEO of eclipses.
00:43:32.970 - 00:43:34.310, Speaker B: It's wild.
00:43:34.930 - 00:43:41.190, Speaker A: So the current CEO of Eclipse only has less than a 2% equity. That doesn't make sense.
00:43:41.770 - 00:43:44.138, Speaker B: Well, not Neil, that maybe they were referencing.
00:43:44.194 - 00:43:51.242, Speaker A: No, the new guy that Vijay who came over from DoidX, who I actually did in Uniswap.
00:43:51.306 - 00:43:51.770, Speaker B: Right.
00:43:51.890 - 00:43:54.762, Speaker A: Yeah, he's great. I actually caught up with him the other day.
00:43:54.946 - 00:44:02.834, Speaker B: Yeah, full disclosure, I'm an investor in eclipse. I. No knowledge of this. I just read the article. I was like, okay, well, unfortunate Neil, then. Sorry, not Neil.
00:44:02.882 - 00:44:05.070, Speaker A: Third take down piece coming for you, Santi.
00:44:06.750 - 00:44:31.450, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, people know that I'm an investor. There's always going to be one commenting, oh, this guy invested in eclipse. I'm like, yep, trust me, I'm not happy about it. The thing that Vijay was quick to tweet and say they listened, obviously, we're cleaning up shop to say that it's not ideal situation. I think it's an understatement or something to that effect.
00:44:32.070 - 00:44:37.210, Speaker A: Yeah, well, see, that's all I got this week.
00:44:38.910 - 00:44:40.814, Speaker B: Yeah. Is that it?
00:44:40.902 - 00:44:41.770, Speaker A: What do you got?
00:44:42.590 - 00:44:53.430, Speaker B: No, just making sure. Big news items. I mean, obviously, eCc, there's not much covering. I didn't go to the panels themselves. We talked about bitcoin, Germany, kind of Matt Gox.
00:44:53.550 - 00:45:36.846, Speaker A: Okay, let me ask you one. I'll ask you one cycle related question. The general consensus amongst what I'd call empire guests, when we ask people about the cycle and where we're at, seems to be something along the lines of, there's too much uncertainty in the market. The market doesn't like uncertainty. We're going to chop and consolidate for the next couple of months, and then come October, November, when there's more certainty around who's going to win the election. If it's Trump, the market ends up ripping and we go into a big bull market in 2025. If Biden gets elected, maybe there's some sort of mini bear market, and then it delays an inevitable bull that feels like probably 85% of guests who come on empire say that? Yeah.
00:45:36.846 - 00:45:39.530, Speaker A: How does that line up with how you're thinking about the next several months?
00:45:40.790 - 00:46:19.032, Speaker B: I mean, I don't think on months basis, sir, but I think that is probably the prevailing sentiment out there. But also, you got to wonder, like, you know, if everyone is thinking that and doing that, then, yeah, I don't know. Crypto markets have a way of acting in a way that is very unpredictable, and I just constantly reminded that it's impossible to time markets. And so you can be right one time, you can be right multiple times. Now. I do listen to certain people. Like, chao was like, hey, listen, I do pay attention to the 200 day moving average, and that was a breakdown.
00:46:19.032 - 00:46:42.964, Speaker B: You've tested 60 something, whatever, 62, 63, constantly, and it's just not breaking. So, you know, I think these are moments where, like, if you have, um. If your portfolio construction is off, if your sizing is off, if you have too much leverage, it feels highly, highly uncomfortable in these moments where. Yeah, it just feels uncomfortable. Yeah, it's going to be volatile. It will always be volatile. So I think it's more of an inward thing.
00:46:42.964 - 00:47:06.570, Speaker B: It's like, okay, I feel comfortable in how I've sized positions. I always carry some cash because I always want to be in a position to bid when others never want and don't want to touch it. Are we there yet? No, absolutely not. Do we have these moments periodically? Yes. And so it's always nice to have some cash on hand. None of this is advice or whatever. I'll leave you this thought.
00:47:06.570 - 00:47:48.918, Speaker B: I picked up this great book called the forgotten Billionaires. Fascinating, this idea that it's easier to make wealth than it is to preserve it, to the point where none of the descendants of Vanderbilt are billionaires. Few are actually millionaires. Very few billionaires today inherited their wealth. Most of it was created, and it's incredibly hard to retain wealth over generations. And so because people either spend too much, invest in stupid stuff, just don't put it on an index, and let it ride. And I think the worst thing that you can do is put yourself in a position where you're going to have to be a forest seller.
00:47:48.918 - 00:48:22.724, Speaker B: So you should. I guess the operating assumption is it can be extremely volatile. Like, you wouldn't you? And I probably won't be surprised if bitcoin is at 30 next week. Would you be, like, super surprised? It's certainly possible. Now, I did this tweet last week of what is more probable, and it was the exact same ratio for Sol, BTC, and ETH, and the market is still price skewing. Actually, this would contradict what you're saying. I tweeted July 5.
00:48:22.724 - 00:48:55.900, Speaker B: What has a greater probability of happening in the next six months? Seoul at 200 or Sol at 66. And at that time, it was like up 50, down 50. Similarly for bitcoin, 112k or twenty eight k, six thousand for ETH or 1500. And bitcoin and Solana were 75% believed that it was the higher number. So it was going to go higher. So sold 200 BTC at 112, 75%. People believed that had a higher probability than the downside case.
00:48:55.900 - 00:49:32.022, Speaker B: ETH was slightly lower. Two thirds believe so, 66%, not 75 for BTC. And Sol believe that still ETH, like positive skew over the next six months. So I continue to hold my thesis, which is, I think, at the end of the year, well see all time highs for the majors, meaning bitcoin, Sol, eth. I think we end the year breaking and higher than where they are now. Prediction markets are telling you that Trump's going to get elected. Everything points to that.
00:49:32.022 - 00:49:47.510, Speaker B: It's a pro. That administration probably, definitely seems like it's going to be more crypto friendly. You're going to have the ETF, eth, ETF likely cranking. Probably. Maybe. I don't know. Solana, ETF surprises people, comes sooner.
00:49:47.510 - 00:50:17.432, Speaker B: Maybe, probably not this year. But still the markets are forward looking. I don't know. I'm not like, do I feel the need to go really out on the risk spectrum? And I don't think I'm. The challenge with all of this is that the traditional market is ripping. Right? That's the hardest thing right now, because you're, like, you're definitely taking less risk in traditional markets, presumably this is higher beta, so that is riskier. And so you're not.
00:50:17.432 - 00:50:32.936, Speaker B: The question is, are you being comp. So, like, if you're trafficking in both, like, are you being compensated enough to, like, go out and bid right now when equities have just been so generous? That's a challenge, right?
00:50:33.048 - 00:50:35.220, Speaker A: Yeah. So what's your book called?
00:50:37.120 - 00:50:38.168, Speaker B: Forgotten billionaires.
00:50:38.224 - 00:50:53.240, Speaker A: Forgotten billionaires. Okay. I have a related book that I'm reading right now. It's called Aster. It's written by Anderson Cooper from CNN. So Anderson Cooper is actually Vanderbilt. He's part of the Vanderbilt family.
00:50:53.240 - 00:51:20.276, Speaker A: And he has this unique look. He wrote another book called Vanderbilt from a lot of, like, the private family files that he has and stuff. But this is about Aster. So if anyone for New Yorkers will be familiar with, like, Astor Place, and there's Astor street and things like that. This guy, John Astor was like, yeah. John Jacob Astor was like, your quintessential american dream story. He came to the US in 1783 and they basically, they were one of the wealthiest families in the whole.
00:51:20.276 - 00:51:56.290, Speaker A: I think they were the wealthiest family in the US at one point. They were like one generation before the kind of, or two generations before, like, the Gilded Age group. So, like, he was friends with, like, Thomas Jefferson and things like that. But it's a really interesting story, just about the. Yeah, about the entire Astor family. And from, like, 1783 to 2009, there were probably a top ten, like, wealthiest american family. And it just shares the story of, like, making great wealth, the american dream, and then, like, the ability of a family generations removed to lose that wealth.
00:51:56.790 - 00:52:15.550, Speaker B: Generations. Yeah, it's difficult. Buffett famously said, rule number one, investing is don't lose money. Rule number two is don't forget rule number one. You know, it's simple, but, you know, I also think, yeah, you're not necessarily losing, but you're not selling.
00:52:15.670 - 00:52:16.902, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:52:17.046 - 00:52:19.610, Speaker B: Paper gains and paper losses, indeed.
00:52:22.450 - 00:52:22.738, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:52:22.754 - 00:52:57.030, Speaker B: It's really interesting. I like reading these traditional books. Sometimes I don't finish them all, but it's constant reminders of things that are really just. Howard Marks said something that has really stuck with me over the years, which is he's like, you don't necessarily have to ascribe to so many different concepts in finance or investing. It's like, just hold on to. In my career, I've held on to one or two things and have really harped on them time and time again because constantly people lose sight of them. And I've just stuck to those because I believe it is just fundamentally what drives my process.
00:52:57.030 - 00:53:11.218, Speaker B: Uh, he's not looking to capture the entire cycle. He's not looking to capture the outperform. He's just looking to dampen ball and, like, protect capital at all times. Obviously, that served him well. Um, so anyways, no, it's. It's a good book. It's.
00:53:11.218 - 00:53:16.340, Speaker B: It's actually a really good reminder, uh, of investing.
00:53:17.920 - 00:53:20.500, Speaker A: Good chat. So glad you made it back from Brussels.
00:53:21.000 - 00:53:22.872, Speaker B: Yeah, stay safe. Don't go in there.
00:53:22.896 - 00:53:24.416, Speaker A: It's a nice new hoodie you got.
00:53:24.608 - 00:53:32.328, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. Shout out to Omar on second lane, guys, they just gave me this hoodie. He actually asked me, like, what color do you want? It was like, navy blue. I only wear navy blue. That's sick.
00:53:32.384 - 00:53:33.260, Speaker A: I want one.
00:53:34.400 - 00:53:37.320, Speaker B: It's quite comfortable. Like, I don't usually wear merch.
00:53:37.360 - 00:53:42.154, Speaker A: I know, I'm chilling this means I need to get you some blockworks merch after I've asked you for.
00:53:42.282 - 00:53:44.378, Speaker B: I've got. How many times have I asked?
00:53:44.434 - 00:53:46.058, Speaker A: There's probably four years of asking for block works.
00:53:46.074 - 00:53:59.554, Speaker B: The only reason I'm like, hey, if I invest, can I get a hoodie? This was my only condition. I'm not asking for a board seat. I'm not asking you for information rights. I'm not asking even for. I'm asking for a goddamn hoodie. I can't even get that.
00:53:59.602 - 00:54:04.938, Speaker A: All right, I think you've earned it. Fine, fine, fine. I'll bring it to permissionless. That means you have to not. No. Show permissionless where you're.
00:54:04.994 - 00:54:07.750, Speaker B: Listen, folks, I gotta go pay $10,000 for a hoodie.
00:54:09.540 - 00:54:17.476, Speaker A: All right? By the way, permissionless, our event, our health chats have. That's actually turned into a nice little, like.
00:54:17.628 - 00:54:22.444, Speaker B: Yeah, we need great coffee, by the way. Terrible coffee. Paper straws. No paper straws.
00:54:22.492 - 00:54:38.382, Speaker A: I told the coinbase, I told Coinbase is head of events yesterday, they should really build a. They have these like, coin base cafes. Yeah, they should build like a base cafe right next to the show floor. And the only way that you can get. You can get free cold brew. But the only way that you can get the cold brew.
00:54:38.486 - 00:54:40.910, Speaker B: A cold brew with like, some stats and regulation.
00:54:40.990 - 00:54:56.566, Speaker A: Yeah, but the only way. Here's. Here's what? Like, someone should do this activation is the only of a cold brew right next to the show floor. The only way that you can get the. That you can get this free cold cold wallet is you pay with your wallet and the number of people who will be. Be there and say, fuck. Fine.
00:54:56.566 - 00:55:02.730, Speaker A: And download the coinbase wallet. Or the. Or Uniswap should do this. Uniswap wallet. Like that is it. That is a no brainer activation.
00:55:03.350 - 00:55:16.526, Speaker B: 100%. We can have even a leaderboard of caffeine consumption. Like, if you disclose your. Like, there's just so many things. Why am I telling people to do this, goddamnit. Like, there are marketers out there give me fucking good cold brew at a conference. Otherwise I'm not going.
00:55:16.526 - 00:55:19.590, Speaker B: That's it. If there's no cold brew, I'm not going.
00:55:19.710 - 00:55:22.038, Speaker A: Preach. All right, sir.
00:55:22.094 - 00:55:31.034, Speaker B: Anyways, guys, thanks for tuning in this slow summer. Get your free vitamin D. Don't look like a vampire. Like Yano. Look like me, you know, nice. Perfectly.
