00:00:00.520 - 00:00:26.692, Speaker A: Thank you all for coming to the market structure panel. My name is Eric Golden. I was at Fidelity for 16 years as a portfolio manager, managing fixed income assets, mortgages, municipal bonds, treasuries, a bunch of fun over the counter market stuff. Full time crypto and host of web three breakdowns. I'm here today with some great panelists. Maybe we'll just go down the line, kind of introduce yourself to everyone a little bit about what you do. You want to start, Cynthia?
00:00:26.798 - 00:00:44.764, Speaker B: Sure. Nice to meet you, everyone. I'm Cynthia Wu. I'm funding partner at Matrixport. So Matrix support is a one stop financial shop where we offer custody, prime brokerage, as well as asset management to retail and institutions. Good to see you here.
00:00:45.304 - 00:01:02.194, Speaker C: Hi, my name is Darius. I'm the founder of QCP Capital. We are a full suite cryptocurrency trading company. We trade spot, we market, make in derivatives on OTC exchanges, Defi, and we do a lot of investments as well.
00:01:07.414 - 00:01:23.654, Speaker D: Hello. Hey, my name is Eric. I'm a trader at CMS holdings, and CMS is a trading firm that focuses on liquid investments as well as we do some vc deals on the illiquid side also. So we do the full stack.
00:01:24.434 - 00:01:46.014, Speaker A: So coming from the trade fi side, I love, I mean, market structure is really interesting. Leverage is always a good place to start. It's how markets move. It's also how markets blow up. I think that one of the things I think would be an interesting place to start for all of you just to go down the line is how do you think about the leverage in the crypto system? How do you monitor it? How much do you think is actually in the system on any given time?
00:01:46.794 - 00:02:12.666, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the other two gentlemen probably have more say on that because they are like their p and l is a stake. But for us, as a service provider, that's not something we watch very closely day to day. But that's the sentiment we need to be monitoring and be aware where the market is. Right. So, because we have a lot of clients, a lot of them are prop trading firms and hedge fund miners. They take loans from us. We do institutional lending.
00:02:12.666 - 00:03:01.314, Speaker B: So definitely we can feel where the temperature is from where the interest rate are. In the previous few cycles before the burst, like in 2021, May and 2020, March, there were definitely periods of time, often lasting for a few months, where everyone is adding leverage. Everyone feels that the price is going higher, everyone want to take loan almost at the same time, in the same direction. Right. So that drives the market interest very up, like a lot in a short period of time. So typically when that happens, we will have a sense that market is probably a little bit toppy. And you can also look at the perpetual swaps of funding rates, and that's also quite direct.
00:03:01.314 - 00:03:07.974, Speaker B: Look at that and the open interest. That's quite a direct indication of how hot is the market. Yeah.
00:03:08.314 - 00:03:41.604, Speaker C: Just to add on to what Cynthia said, it's obvious answer, but not obvious as well. So like you said, funding rates in perpetual swaps, loan rates are very telling of leverage in the market. I mean, in Defi summer, you had perpetual swap rates that went up to like 100, 5200 percent. Term futures rates that went up to like 6100 percent as well. So that was very clear. Obviously a lot of leverage in the market. And then the question is now, is there still a lot of leverage in the market? Not easy to answer.
00:03:41.604 - 00:04:45.294, Speaker C: The rates are much lower. Forward rates are probably about 510 percent or maybe five to 7%. Perpetual swaps are kind of flattish, but at the same time, what's the normal state of the market? A lot of people don't remember that in 2018 to 19, during the crypto winter, then the normal state for bitcoin, forwards were actually backwardation, meaning that forwards were trading at a discount, not at a premium. So the question that we always ask is, with forwards at a premium, is that a normal state of the market or is that still leverage? So are we going to go back to a place where unleveraged means that bitcoin futures trade at a discount on backward nation, in which case we are still quite in a leveraged market and there are more ways to go. So no easy answer to this. It is easy to tell when the market is super overheated, but when we are at a state at this stage, it's hard to tell whether we are at a mean stage or whether we are still leveraged. My personal answer to that would be, I think we are still a little bit leveraged and there's still a bit more to go.
00:04:45.294 - 00:04:48.054, Speaker C: But no right answer to that as well.
00:04:48.914 - 00:05:11.728, Speaker D: Yeah, the other two have indicated, well, yeah, just a lot of perps. That's what we primarily look at. And then on the defi side, the lending borrowing platforms like Aave compound, they'll have like 10% at the highest, but now they're down to like low, like three 4% ish. So clearly leverage out compared to what we were.
00:05:11.896 - 00:05:50.196, Speaker C: I think the problem with crypto and leverage is that there isn't a reference rate because, you know, matrixport might have their internal reference rate. Then DeFi comes in and you have a hugely different reference rate, and then each centralized exchange has their own perk rate as well. So I think one way that the space, I think, would need to take a step in terms of the interest rates is to have a reference rate for the space. But easier said than done, because you have that in treadfi. But building it in DeFi is a lot more difficult given the fragmentation, not just in venues, but in types of products as well.
00:05:50.380 - 00:06:21.812, Speaker D: Yeah, going off that, it'll be very interesting when ETH staking comes out, when they go proof of stake. We'll see when that happens. But people have said the staking rate will be around like 5%. If you add the flashbot stuff, maybe you can get up to like eight, 9%, but then that'll inherently be a reference rate. And then we'll see if, like, the ETH futures trade more premium and stuff, and how much it takes to borrow. But that'll be very interesting and very different from what we have right now with ethanol, borrow at like 2%.
00:06:21.988 - 00:07:17.488, Speaker A: Yeah, that's really helpful. I think there was Sam Bankman Fried, who said there was, right before the Luna blow of about a trillion dollars of demand looking to get in, and we only had about 200 billion of stablecoin, which is why you see these interest rates that to trade five people are like, where are these rates coming from? How are you able to generate this? Is this all just Ponzi economics? But to your point, it's really fragmented. I guess one thing I've always been curious about with the crypto space in general, is with such a high volatility asset, why do you think there's leverage in the first place? Usually in Tradefi, if you look at stuff like long term capital management, a famous blow up, what we did, I'm still in both worlds, I guess, is you take an asset that has a really low volatility, and you put as much leverage on as possible. Crypto just went, Max, Max and said, let's put leverage on a high volatility asset. Do you think that's here to stay? Or maybe some of the background of why crypto uses so much leverage and why it makes sense, actually.
00:07:17.536 - 00:07:58.758, Speaker C: This from an option market maker's perspective, our fear before this period was that the volatility was getting too low. The realized volumes, the implied volumes, tend to trade above the realized volumes. That's a characteristic of a frontier market, frontier emerging, and they tend to trade around. Just before this period, it was trading around 40, 50%. And before this, I think two years ago or one year ago it was trading around 100%. And I mean, that's the reason why we like this market. But I guess answer your question as to why this leverage.
00:07:58.758 - 00:08:42.484, Speaker C: I think it's just purely the fact that it's a very speculative market. Folks are not in here to do structured products, index products, they're in here not to get the. Anything below 100% is low for crypto. That's the reason why you see in crypto there's this phenomenon where the VC funds are bigger than the macro funds. So you have a billion dollar, 10 billion VC funds because these guys promise 100 x 1000 x return, whereas the macro funds are not. It's just purely the sentiment where people want the exponential return and therefore do leverage up is the way to get 100 AC return. So I think that's the reason why mostly why we see this phenomenon of leverage on high volatility.
00:08:43.664 - 00:08:45.056, Speaker A: Eric, do you have anything to add?
00:08:45.200 - 00:08:53.964, Speaker D: No, I would agree with that. In a bull market, everyone thinks the number goes up, so they want to make more money. It's just human nature, so they just lever up.
00:08:54.704 - 00:09:24.904, Speaker B: I think you just mentioned the fragmentation, right? Fragmentation. And people have different, different views and there's different rates they get from send five platforms, defi platform, across different platforms in semi Defi. So people feel that there is for traders, they feel there's a lot of risk free arbitrage opportunities if we can pull up a beautiful trade. And then they're comfortable because they feel they're not taking that much risk. It's market neutral. So they just want to take leverage to amplify that yield.
00:09:25.264 - 00:10:09.272, Speaker C: Actually, to add to that, I think as the institutional guys come in, that's starting to change. So we're starting to see people do structured products. I mean, if you compare crypto volume to fx volume, for example, dollar India volume is four 5%, crypto volume now is about 70, 70, 80. The private banks look at the space and they start salivating because the amount of things they can write with, the kind of spreads they can take, it's immense. And we're starting to see the companies like banks, starting to look at the space matrix bought ourselves. We do structured products in the space, and a lot of them are sell bought products. So I think actually the risk is that the leverage stands to, or rather the volatility gets compressed the way we see in treadfi.
00:10:09.272 - 00:10:31.814, Speaker C: So for us, I think the alpha comes from a high volatility market. But as these products come in and index products come in, I mean, once Goldman Sachs come in, Fidelity comes in, they start writing index stuff. You see the compression that we see in treadfi, and I think that will happen quite quickly as well. So in our view, I think the window of this high volume will not last that long. So enjoy it while it lasts.
00:10:32.514 - 00:11:10.834, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's one of the interesting things about institutions. I think it's probably a ways off. I talk about in trade fi, you basically are smashing atoms to find alpha. It's like you're trying to find a pin's knife, and then in crypto, you're starting at 100% and then trying to prioritize alpha. I think it's an interesting point just to move to the fragmentation idea of capital efficiency, help people understand what does it mean to be capital efficient when you guys are doing these large trades across multiple exchanges? You can't just have a prime broker and run across all of crypto. You've got to really be strategic and optimize your assets. So maybe explain to the audience what capital efficiency is and how you use it in your businesses.
00:11:12.374 - 00:11:41.196, Speaker B: Yeah, so, Mitch, report. We offered prime brokerage services last year to a lot of hedge fund. So last year we can see most of them actually trade on centralized exchanges. So for us, the job is to provide more venues and financings for them to trade on those venues. But this year, a lot of things have changed. Especially, I think, after December last year, the market really comes down. The alpha that was easily gets in the central exchanges, this is no longer there.
00:11:41.196 - 00:12:17.852, Speaker B: So this pushes a lot of the hedge funds to look into DeFi for Alpha. And that definitely has been a very big trend that we have seen. So the type of demands that we often hear from the hedge fund is that, oh, can you provide us the prime brokerage services? We wanted secure access into deFi. We also want finance into DeFi. And can you portfolio margin my position across DeFi and Sendfi. So, yeah, so we just do what we heard from the market, and that's definitely become kind of the edge in our product offerings. And I do see that trend not going to stop.
00:12:17.852 - 00:12:35.664, Speaker B: It's probably going to accelerate as more and more, I would say startup hedge fund, who is around ten to 50 million AUM, they're moving that direction and getting quickly, more and more sophisticated about the DeFi strategies.
00:12:36.864 - 00:13:35.680, Speaker C: I think guys who are doing prime brokerage, like matrixport, are doing God's work for the space. Because think about it, if you are doing a prime broker, if you want to be a prime broker, you charge basis points on volume traded and then you take the clearing risk and you take that intermediary risk in a market that has a black swan, and once every one, two years, it's very much like picking pennies in front of a steamroller. So compared to tradfi, where a bank is happy to give a line to hedge funds and have counterparty lines, and then they take the default risk in crypto, that's a lot harder. So that is in the c five side, it's very difficult to be a prime broker given how volatile the space. It's not volatile in the sense that it's mean volatility. You're talking about fat tails here, which is the most difficult for a prime broker. And then you throw in the defi side, which has no intermediary, which makes it even more fun.
00:13:35.680 - 00:14:22.798, Speaker C: Right? Because the simple answer to that is collateralization is completely inefficient in defi. But at the same time, well, I mean, at least two weeks ago, the yields are very high. So now you have, so now you have a situation where you have a very fragmented market in c five and Defi, and then you have two big fragments there, and then you don't have a party that is able to combine both. So I think we still have a ways to go in terms of being able to consolidate the market and the market the way it trades now, it's a bit more like a lot of bilateral stuff. Bilateral stuff and clearing occurs like matrixport will clear on bit.com or deribit will clear, so it becomes very pocketed clearing. So that's the reason why it remains fragmented.
00:14:22.798 - 00:14:36.594, Speaker C: And the prime brokerage costs are very high because of the tails. So no easy answer to this, but I think as more big players come in and they're willing to take that counterparty risk, we will start to see a bit better collateralization.
00:14:37.494 - 00:15:27.324, Speaker D: Yeah, I agree with what my two co panelists have said. Basically, Defi is very inefficient right now. Like the largest lending borrowing aave compound maker, you need to be super over collateralized to even participate. So what we focus on a lot of the time is we do business with Celsius and Genesis and we have our spot positions like bitcoin and ETH, and we do under collateralize and borrow lending with them, like bilaterally, as you said. And hopefully in the future, we will see DeFi protocols be able to take on this under collateralization because that'll truly move the space forward. But until then, it'll always be very exceedingly inefficient compared to the CFI alternatives.
00:15:27.744 - 00:15:50.796, Speaker A: So, speaking of under collateralized. Over collateralized. There's been a lot of discussion on the other panels about Luna and the blow up and how it affected a lot of the retail participants. I'd be curious to get your take on the other side of that. I don't know. I mean, depends on how many people in this room work for a market maker, an OTC desk. They don't get to see the other side of the market, of what that felt like on the OTC desks.
00:15:50.796 - 00:16:00.184, Speaker A: Large trading. There's been lots of rumors about people coming in and doing different trades. I'd be curious just to hear, from your perspectives, how the saga of last week played out for you all.
00:16:00.644 - 00:16:51.266, Speaker C: Yeah, maybe I'll start. Actually wasn't as bad as we thought. So if you compare the market crash of 2018 and you compare to the market crash of 2020, those two market crashes, there was a real question in the back of my mind was, is this going to survive? There's an existential question. I think in this case, it was a huge impact and it was a huge wealth destruction event. But there wasn't the question of whether is this space going to survive? Because it was well contained within DeFi, well contained within a specific ecosystem. So, I mean, there were concerns that if a big borrow lender has exposure, you start seeing defaults and whether that creates a domino effect. But there wasn't an existential question, and there wasn't this liquidity gap that we used to see.
00:16:51.266 - 00:17:13.804, Speaker C: It. Gaps from 20k down to three k, that kind of gap. There were bids. The market was well contained. The exchanges were very orderly. There weren't exchange stops and liquidity issues. I actually think that this Luna crash was a sign that the space is a lot more robust than it was before.
00:17:13.804 - 00:17:34.274, Speaker C: Of course, we are still waiting to see whether there were guys who might announce blow ups in the coming weeks, if possible. But as far as it stands now, I think, to me, it was a very positive sign that the space was able to. It's more resilient than it was before and able to take this blow in an orderly manner.
00:17:35.614 - 00:17:55.924, Speaker D: Yeah. So, yeah, huge wealth destruction event. I think 40 bill wiped out in, like, two days. That's the largest ever in crypto. But so we were farming in anchor. I mean, 19%. Like, who doesn't want that, right? So there's indicators that allowed us to, like, sell the UST at around 0.99.
00:17:55.924 - 00:18:39.564, Speaker D: But mainly we were watching the second and third order events. So when Luna goes to zero, there's some really interesting events that happened. For instance, ChainLink pegs the price of Luna at. This was when Luna was trading well under $0.01, but they had to hard coded a floor because they were afraid of an oracle manipulation or something. Anyways, a lot of the DeFi protocols just use chain link and whatever the chainlink price is, that's what they accept. So lending, borrowing protocols, who accept Luna to borrow, and you can pull out other assets, got hit really hard by this.
00:18:39.564 - 00:19:12.912, Speaker D: So a lot of, like, I think on BSc there was one called Venus. I think 10 million was lost on Avax, there's another one called Blitz. I think another 10 million was lost there. And then some of the other protocols, I think there was one on cava that hard coded UST to $1. So you can see when USD pegged, they minted USDX. It's just a coin that they were able to swap at one to one. Like over 300 million TLV was lost there.
00:19:12.912 - 00:19:23.404, Speaker D: So a lot of times when, like, these huge events happen, there are unintended second and third order consequences that are very interesting to watch. Trade, et cetera.
00:19:25.304 - 00:20:01.188, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. Yeah, I pretty much agree with what there is has said. I think for the first time, first, the cycle adopter. This crash might sounds very devastating, but we are a multi cycle adopter already, and we feel that we take it relatively well, and the industry is going to come back stronger. If you look at the liquidation numbers, the notional value got liquidated in that four or five days is about 3.5 billion. That's around, I think, eight, nine percentage of the overall futures market open interest.
00:20:01.188 - 00:20:34.842, Speaker B: And if you look at what happened last year, if you remember when China bans crypto, and that was really a period of negativity. And the market liquidation back then is 10 billion, right? It's around, I think, more than in some percentage. Absolute number is more than this time. And if you look at the year before 2022 March, that's dark period for everyone. That liquidation happened during that period. Time was 20 billion. So this is, in relative terms, it's not a terrible thing.
00:20:34.842 - 00:21:19.270, Speaker B: And also, it's in a confined environment. And on the positive side, always look at the silver lining. I think what this incident could bring to the industry is definitely the focus on, like, building that real value building and also community building. And try not to focus so much on gross hacking. Don't just look at the tvls, don't look at yield, but also look at what is back in the yield, because if you look at anchors financial, you will be able to see that they are running a 1.3 billion deficit on annual basis and that's just not sustainable. And those are public information.
00:21:19.270 - 00:21:35.894, Speaker B: But why people are not reflecting on those, why people do not see this risk? I think this blow up, give everyone a reflection on what are the how to do the research. And after you find out this, how you manage your exposure, just.
00:21:35.934 - 00:22:04.534, Speaker C: Sorry. So, side note, I think this is going to go down as a very interesting case, not just in crypto history, but in financial trading history. I give you example. This is a funny one, right? So there were option market makers who were long lunar UsT puts. So if you're long a put, technically if Luna goes down, you're going to make money. But the problem is that it was Luna against UST. So even though they were long, the Luna USD puts, both sides went to zero.
00:22:04.534 - 00:22:17.804, Speaker C: It's a unique case. I mean, I've said through the euro, Swiss DPEG, five other dpgs, and as long as you're long, put your fine, but in this case you are not put your fuck as well because you're hedging in Luna USD and then you both go to zero. That's an interesting side note.
00:22:18.544 - 00:22:40.074, Speaker A: There'll definitely be many case studies written about it and I hope they add that one too. I would just be curious to go into your point about some of the interesting things about how free markets work. So you talk about what in a normal market would be considered a mistake. They would break trades. If someone hard codes $0.10, you can't borrow against it. In crypto.
00:22:40.074 - 00:23:04.394, Speaker A: I find it interesting. I don't know what the right word is because I think some people find that horrible. Your system said you could do this and then people exploit it. Other people say code is law, and so if you can do it, the market will find an edge. How do you feel about if there's an edge, it can be exploited versus how. Back to the point of institutional adoption. When you think about institutions, they would never stand for that type of behavior.
00:23:05.094 - 00:23:52.550, Speaker C: Yeah, I can give a very good example of this. So we are very active in the DeFi options vaults, and basically what these vaults are doing is replicating the centralized options markets where you have intermediary that will stand in between managing the settlement price, managing the trading process, whereas the vaults are all, it's the same option trading process, but in smart contracts. And therefore, like you said, completely hard coded. Right. If you quote a wrong price, you're done. You know, the protocol can't go back and change it. If the option vault is using the chain link price, and the chain link price happened to be dollar 20 away from the actual market price at the time, you can't change it as well.
00:23:52.550 - 00:24:27.534, Speaker C: So it's very frustrating. It's very frustrating. And I'm sure there are many other instances of this where the Defi markets have shown themselves to be inefficient. But the truth is, we are still in very early days of Defi. And the problem that we're trying to solve in DeFi is not a small one. We are trying to replicate financial markets, which have been around for decades and function with an intermediary, and we're trying to replicate the entire process without intermediary. So we are really just at the start of it, and we're starting to innovate and trying to find solutions to this.
00:24:27.534 - 00:24:56.904, Speaker C: The onus is on the space to build and be creative to find ways to do it. So I think there are frustrations and a lot of p and l frustrations as well. But I think it's always good to work together. I think that's what's good about the crypto community. We work together and we try to find innovative ways to do it. So for us, I think the vision is, in 510 years time, the crypto space, the defi space, will be able to replicate what we see in traditional markets with different mechanisms that don't require an intermediate meteor. I think that's what the grand vision is.
00:24:57.204 - 00:25:18.652, Speaker D: Yeah. So, like right now on Defi, as he said, it sits on one side. Code is law. There's a hack. You basically lose your money unless a centralized exchange can track out who hacked it, and then you can potentially get your money back. But I'd say most hacks just gone on the other side, exact opposite for traditional finance. I don't know how many people here know about FX, but there's something called last look.
00:25:18.652 - 00:25:29.534, Speaker D: So when the banks trade with you and you run them over and they don't like the price, they just delete the trade. So that's the complete opposite spectrum. Hopefully, in, like, 510 years time, we'll meet somewhere in the middle.
00:25:30.554 - 00:25:32.974, Speaker B: I don't have more to add. They're down. Good job.
00:25:33.634 - 00:26:06.058, Speaker A: No, I think that's a great point. I think that as bad as last week was, and I think as the morale has kind of fallen to me, I think about the trade fi world, where in a fixed income trade, you might do $150 million trade, and it's done over the phone with me saying the word done. And that's it. That's the whole thing. Holding together trillion dollar markets is two people on the phone expressing the word done, and then if there's a fight and you adjudicate, and then you break trades. And the difference is that retail doesn't get to participate in that market. They have a separate area where trades can be broken.
00:26:06.058 - 00:26:33.534, Speaker A: And so I do believe that there's so many better ways that we could build this, but it's all experimental, and we need to have problems to actually solve it. So I think what you guys are doing is awesome. On risk management, how do you look at the portfolio? What are the tools you look at? How are you in a market like last week? What are you doing from a top down analysis to understand how much risk you have, how much the market has, if it's time to delever, if you need to over collateralize, talk a little bit more about risk management.
00:26:34.994 - 00:27:34.572, Speaker D: I would say specifically for last week, you look at how impacted you are with that. It's pretty isolated, the Luna ecosystem. So you look at your assets on Luna, how much Luna you have, and specifically, even if you collateralized, other things on the Luna chain, they were worried, for instance, that the Luna chain would go down and people could do a 51% attack because not that much Luna was staked. So if it's a particular thing, like last week, it was just what assets you have on Luna. But then that obviously trickles down into the entire space, and people started getting liquidated at Luna, so they had to use other assets as collateral, and everything started a huge wave. So when stuff like that happens, you have to be heavy into cash and anticipate that. Sometimes the first wave of Luna liquidations happen, but then people put up other assets as collateral, and the second wave of BTC goes down 5%, and these waterfall effects can happen.
00:27:34.572 - 00:27:38.464, Speaker D: And in crypto, because of the leverage that we just talked about, it happens more often than not.
00:27:39.844 - 00:28:11.862, Speaker C: I actually think risk management wise, it's not that different from traditional finance risk management. You have your VAR models, you have your risk limits. The unique thing about crypto, I guess, is when something happens, like Luna, it's all about the tails. So immediately when a black swan event happens, you watch your tails. What tail move is going to end the business? So you look at the USD exposure, lunar exposure. That's contained, that's fine. Then the next thing that happens is USDT starts to de pact.
00:28:11.862 - 00:29:01.864, Speaker C: Now, that's a big tale, because if that happens, even if you don't have USDT, all your counterparties have a lot of USDT. So immediately you contact tether, check with John, Carlo and Paulo and ask them how's the, in a very polite manner, how's the treasury doing, you guys? Good, you know, and then, so I think, you know, immediately you need to look at your tails. So I think, and one of the toast tales is not just like USDT or USDC, another one is counterparties as well. So you know, you have the Celsius, the genesis and the same thing you're going to ask them, you know, hi, how's it going guys? You know, make sure that the counterparties are fine because it's very counterparty dependent, it's a very bilateral community. So I think the only difference really is in what your tales are and how you watch your, which is a bit more high touch than you have in traditional markets because there's a regulator that monitors that for you.
00:29:02.884 - 00:29:25.932, Speaker B: Okay. We are in institutional lending business and prime broker business. So that's why risk management is really the key. And I would say it's a bedrock of our business and also the scalability of our business. We're lucky that we didn't have any UST or Luna Explorer because we were not comfortable accepting those two assets as collateral. Right. We are very.
00:29:25.932 - 00:30:16.450, Speaker B: I will say our team does a lot of due diligence work put in to understand the tokenomics, the liquidity in the market and the robustness of the projects to be able to add them into collateral. So I would say in order to add a certain asset into a collateral for institutional lenders like us or the likes of us, is, is often a more onerous process. It will be taking longer time. It's not that. Okay. We get a lot of random or kind of ad hoc interest from hedge funds. Okay, can we give you this token, can you take that and lend us us dollar or stablecoins? And often we will need some time to reveal that because we need to be very conscious about the risks of taking certain asset as a collateral.
00:30:16.450 - 00:31:47.084, Speaker B: And the other aspect is that when we lend out to do much lending with hedge fund, especially those with a heavy component of DeFi strategies, there's a lot of work that we need to put into that as well. So not only look at the team's backgrounds and nav the max drawdown, but we also need to look at their list of protocols and projects they want to get on. And we need to, luckily we have a good team, professional team of security auditor, as well as smart contract specialists to really look into those protocols, read the codes and also do our own independent assessment in addition to what they've been given, and also to understand what is are they doing liquidity mining, are they doing arbitrage, are they just trading? What are the strategies they're doing on those protocols and projects. So that often takes some time. And potentially we might also need to build some white listing, additional whitelistings and control mechanism to make sure that the money that we lend them to does not end up in somewhere the smart contract addressing never been heard token. So I will say to provide prime brokerage service to centralized exchanges way easier infrastructure wise, but to enable that to the entire DeFi space is a lot of heavy lifting or a lot of dirty work needs to be put behind to make sure this is really doable.
00:31:47.864 - 00:32:22.612, Speaker C: Maybe I can share a bit about how we manage our lunar USD risk. So we were Luna seed investors back in the day. So we have Luna exposure and USD exposure because we, we were market making USD, we're market making Luna options Luna spot. And because we were seed investors, we had a line with terraform Labs to swap USDC and USD at par. And that's something that we always have with any kind of stablecoin exposure that we have. And we always make sure that the line is good. We're constantly swapping.
00:32:22.612 - 00:32:51.724, Speaker C: And in January, when there was a slight deep, we went to check the line and they close the line. So if the terraform treasury is closing that line, to us, it was a signal that the team is not confident in the pack. So in January we cut all exposure. So that's how we sort of test the market confidence in a certain thing. You make sure that you have a line, you make sure you're checking that. Back to the point about making sure your tails are covered.
00:32:52.304 - 00:33:09.344, Speaker A: No, I think, talk about an informational edge. I know we're the only thing stopping between this and happy hour, so I'll wrap up with my last question. You guys have been through multiple bear markets. I think maybe just one last question down the line of in this cycle, what is kind of your outlook for the next six to twelve months and anything else you might want to share?
00:33:12.004 - 00:33:46.194, Speaker C: Yeah, maybe I'll start. So, like I said, this is a bear market, but it doesn't feel like the previous bear markets. For one. You don't have that kind of liquidity gap. I mean, don't speak too soon, but you don't have the kind of liquidity gap in, in the black swan event, you have active participation from builders who are still building. And more importantly, we have institutional players in the space now we have isdas with banks, with isdas with hedge funds that I used to trade when I was in tradfi. We didn't have this before.
00:33:46.194 - 00:34:16.260, Speaker C: So I think we're in a very different situation. And again, I tend to be a bit more positive. Of course, the macro environment is a bit scary with the fed raising rates and inflation so high. But I think on everybody's minds, there isn't a question that is bitcoin going to go to zero. I think that alone is a big difference. And I think both Defi and crypto are here to stay. So I think for us, while we need to manage risk in the next six months to a year, I think we're generally positive everyone should just go into the building phase.
00:34:16.260 - 00:34:20.128, Speaker C: The space is going to go on. So, pretty positive about that.
00:34:20.296 - 00:34:48.304, Speaker D: Yeah. Like he said, it's pretty different from the previous cycles. This one is a lot more macro driven. The previous macro has been straight up since 2008. I think there's a world that if the Nasdaq isn't down like 40% from highs, Luna doesn't de peg today. It's just a lot of risk off and cascading events. I didn't join crypto to trade high beta QQQ, so hopefully that stops.
00:34:48.304 - 00:35:20.502, Speaker D: But yeah, my general overall outlook is a little, just straight macro. So I think we'll see in the next two or three years it'll go up. The space is a lot like ten x bigger than before. Every cycle is ten x bigger than the next cycle. The bitcoin has not reached its previous cycle highs and that seems to be strong support. So hopefully this macro stuff stops soon. They talk about hiking rates.
00:35:20.502 - 00:35:40.744, Speaker D: There's another seven hikes this year. So that's pretty bearish. If they keep on going more. Hopefully that just in general just is driving all this crypto stuff. As long as the macro stuff goes away, I'm pretty bullish about the space.
00:35:45.524 - 00:36:33.194, Speaker B: Hello. I'm pretty confident that the mainstream adoption is not stopping and it's not slowing down despite the price till the end of the year. Might not be very exciting, but I feel that the building, the deployment of capital, the learning is definitely there. Right? Like I joined the industry four years ago. Two years ago, we couldn't really see the people here that in this room get interested in participating to this industry. And two weeks ago I was in Milken and that was not a crypto conference, but literally half of the conference panel speech I went to, it will have some component web, three blocks, blockchain, crypto, regardless what title it is. It could be sports and entertainment.
00:36:33.194 - 00:37:16.304, Speaker B: It could be alternative investment or even charity humanity. But they will talk about crypto, and the people who is speaking of that subject matter has a good knowledge of crypto. It's not just a very superficial commenting. They did their, you can feel that they did their homework. They come with knowledge, might be doing something on their own already. So I feel that definitely, we're very excited about the prospect of this industry. And also on a more macro level, I believe that with all the infrastructure being built and more for DeFi, there will be more institutional money getting into Defi this year, despite what happened last weekend.
00:37:16.304 - 00:37:16.976, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:37:17.120 - 00:37:21.568, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you all for your time today, and thank you to the audience for your attention. Thank you.
00:37:21.736 - 00:37:22.104, Speaker C: Thank you.
