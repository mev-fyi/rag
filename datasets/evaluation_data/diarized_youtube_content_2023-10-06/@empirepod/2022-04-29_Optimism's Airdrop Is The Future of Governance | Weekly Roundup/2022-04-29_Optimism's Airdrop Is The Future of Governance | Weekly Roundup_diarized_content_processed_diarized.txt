00:00:00.360 - 00:00:38.540, Speaker A: This episode is brought to you by Bitmex, the OG crypto exchange that is back and better than ever. You'll hear more about Bitmex later in the show. What up? What up, what up? We've got a weekly roundup for the first time in a couple of weeks. Santi, the man of the myth, the legend is back. We had too many good guests that we were bringing on the show, so we paused on the roundups for a little bit. But we got a lot of really good feedback in both the DM's and in the discord that you guys wanted to hear more roundups. And so we're back with the roundups and we're going to keep doing these.
00:00:38.540 - 00:00:41.964, Speaker A: We're going to get back to doing these every week. So, Santi, welcome back.
00:00:42.084 - 00:00:53.928, Speaker B: GMO friends. Good to be back. We haven't forgotten about the roundups. So we're here, we're thinking about it. So this is going to be a big roundup. There's a lot to talk about, a lot of stuff going on, as always. But.
00:00:53.928 - 00:00:56.544, Speaker B: So, yeah, let's get started.
00:00:56.704 - 00:01:10.444, Speaker A: Cool. Amazing. All right, here's what we're talking about today. Optimism. Optimism has what I think is one of the most interesting experiments going on in governance today. They didn't airdrop, but it is much more than an airdrop. There's also the bored ape hack on Instagram.
00:01:10.444 - 00:01:21.932, Speaker A: We might talk about that. We might also talk about some stuff with stable coins going on and some competitors to ust coming out. Obviously, Justin sun is trying to have his hand in that pot. Um, there's a little thing and everything.
00:01:21.988 - 00:01:24.164, Speaker B: Else that it gets traction and everything else.
00:01:24.204 - 00:01:47.494, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. Uh, osmosis, uh, is voting, um, uh, for a bridging solution, uh, figuring out what they're doing there. So we might touch on that. And of course, uh, the Elon musk Twitter acquisition is going down. We might talk about that as well. But before we do, I have to plug permissionless. Um, permissionless is going to be the event of the year.
00:01:47.494 - 00:02:10.374, Speaker A: We will have around 7000 attendees for anyone who bought or minted your permy, congrats to you. We minted them at around one ETH. They shot up to about seven ETH and I think they're trading today around four ETH. So, Santi, congrats. I know you snagged one and then just. The speaker list is crazy. We've got Chris Dixon, do Kwan, Vlad tenev, the CEO of Robinhood is making a fun little announcement on stage.
00:02:10.374 - 00:02:25.196, Speaker A: Justin drakes on deep Li Jinping Jiho. Nick Carter, haseeb from Dragonfly. Santi. Here's your pretty face on the page. Kyle Samani, Eric Peters from one river. We have a chief product officer of coinbase. We've got Kane from Synthetix.
00:02:25.196 - 00:02:44.860, Speaker A: Man stacked, Rob Leshner of compound. Obviously, Celkis is going to bring the fire on stage. Jim Bianco for the macro crowd, Tarun, Matt Hogan, Amy Oldenburg, who's amazing, head of emerging markets at Morgan Stanley. So we got a stacked lineup. Oh, we just had Emma Norchett. Really interesting speaker. People might not have heard of emma recently.
00:02:44.860 - 00:03:06.648, Speaker A: She is at the Ontario teachers pension plan. They are speaking publicly about their crypto investments for the first time ever at permissionless. Super excited to hear the Ontario teachers pension plan. So get your ticket, if you haven't already, get your ticket. Permissionless, head over to the blockworks website. So without further ado, let's jump into it. Um, optimism.
00:03:06.648 - 00:03:31.864, Speaker A: Optimism is an. Is a roll up solution on ETH. They are the second biggest l two, I think, behind Arbitrum. They recently announced their new token op and the optimism collective on Tuesday. So on April 26, they announced this real high level, and then we'll get into it. They are airdropping 5% of their initial supply to 267,000 addresses. Little alpha here.
00:03:31.864 - 00:04:03.938, Speaker A: This includes not just folks who have used optimism, but anyone who's, you know, it includes gitcoin donors, bridge users, multisig signers, snapshot voters. So it's really worth checking to see if you qualify for this drop, even if you haven't used optimism before. A little alpha for you. I think the most interesting thing here is not just the token, but actually it's more about what they're doing around governance. So the optimism collective is going to be governed by two different houses. And here's what you need to know. The first is the token house, the second is the citizen house.
00:04:03.938 - 00:04:32.622, Speaker A: So the token house established really, by this first airdrop. And by the way, there's going to be multiple airdrops. Token holders can vote on protocol upgrades, project incentives and more things like that. That looks a little more traditional, like an airdrop. The second is where it gets really interesting. This is the citizen house, which is going to be launched later in 2022. And this is going to facilitate and govern this process to distribute retroactive goods, funding generated from revenue collected by the network.
00:04:32.622 - 00:05:25.152, Speaker A: So, like transaction fees and eventually sequencer auctions. And the interesting thing here in my mind is that these, like, quote unquote citizens of the citizen house are given this what they call a soul bound, non transferable one of one NFT. And what makes this interesting is that instead of, and the way I understand this, tell me if I'm getting it wrong, is instead of voting being entirely determined by the number of tokens that you own, now it's a little more one to one per person. So if you own a million tokens, I own ten tokens, which is realistically probably what it's going to look like, then I think we have a more fair amount of the vote, instead of you having a million votes and I have ten votes. So there's a lot more here, but really, really interesting and exciting rollout by the optimism team. So congrats to them. What are your takes on this Santu?
00:05:25.348 - 00:06:06.432, Speaker B: We'll start from the top. I mean, I think we talk about how important l two s are for ethereum. It is interesting the way that they structure the airdrop. I thought it was pretty thoughtful people that I think it's, Badger is a very thoughtful airdrop. I think it's very purposefully designed to incentivize people to bridge over and continue to bridge over and interact with optimism. One thing to point out, of course, is that optimism has a relatively low tvl compared to arbitrum, which is the elephant in the room here, which is what is. Does this put pressure on arbitrum to then go and launch a token? I mean, I think optimism doesn't even have 1 billion tbl, whereas arbitram has like 3.6
00:06:06.432 - 00:06:21.560, Speaker B: arbitram. Of course, I think benefited from having launched. I think. I think it was first, or like their testnet was, was done in a more thoughtful way of thought. And full disclosure, I am an investor in Arbitrum. I am not an optimism. We can get to how that happened and why they pissed me off.
00:06:21.560 - 00:06:23.684, Speaker B: But look, I think I'm very happy for them.
00:06:24.264 - 00:06:27.174, Speaker A: Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Optimism pissed you off? What happened?
00:06:27.214 - 00:06:34.074, Speaker B: Not them, but it was just like certain investors in this group, like, have a tendency to block other investors.
00:06:34.574 - 00:06:38.194, Speaker A: You got blocked? You got blocked from the deal. Did you see the deal early?
00:06:38.734 - 00:07:22.704, Speaker B: I'd spoken to one of the earlier investors and I don't know the team well, so that might have been the reason. But I had heard also that the round that was led by paradigm, they didn't allow any other funds to participate. And I thought that was a very interesting decision because in crypto, if youre a founder, I think you always want to bring in more and more into your cap table and not alienate. I felt it was just a very weird way to do it. And sometimes founders want to have more funds involved, and then they cave into the demands of investors, which I think is a terrible decision. I always encourage founders to bring in as many as a diversified cap table, and that wasn't the case. So I went out and funded arbitrum.
00:07:23.124 - 00:07:44.356, Speaker A: Santi, let me ask you this. Here's something I still don't understand. So back in. So a month ago, March 17, Paradigm Andreessen here's Techcrunch article. Paradigm Andreessen, back optimism at $1.65 billion valuation. Can you explain the, like, equity versus token value here? So, like, the optimism got funded at a $1.65
00:07:44.356 - 00:07:50.062, Speaker A: billion valuation, but now you've got the token. So, like, where is the value accruing here, and what's the almost better investment?
00:07:50.238 - 00:08:56.100, Speaker B: That's a really good question. Well, I'll start. The way I think of these is, if you invest in the equity of the company, you have to believe that most of the value will, assuming that there will be a token, most of the value, if not all the value, will accrue to the token, not equity. And what typically ends up happening, and this is my rough kind of mental model for this, is if you invest at a, like $10 million valuation, then you kind of multiply that by two, two or two and a half to get to fully diluted network value. And the reason I'm coming to that is, for the most part, if you look at a lot of these projects, Uniswap, and a lot of these initially only equity investments, they then distribute tokens to the company, in this case, like Uniswap Labs, I guess, or in this case, optimism, the entity equity, the entity that holds equity. And they get, like, anywhere from 30 to 40, no more than 50% of the tokens allocated to that entity, which if you had invested in equity, you have a piece of.
00:08:56.132 - 00:08:56.300, Speaker A: Right.
00:08:56.332 - 00:09:20.806, Speaker B: And so. And you see the relationship there, right. If you invest at a $10 million valuation, equity valuation, and then that that entity gets 50% of the tokens, then you get to essentially divide by 0.5. And so that is two x. Right. And so in this case, I would almost think that if the last valuation was, what did you say? 1.3 million? 1.3
00:09:20.806 - 00:09:45.026, Speaker B: billion? 1.651.65. I would kind of rough math, divide that by 0.4 to get to a $4 billion valuation, fully diluted network value. So that's going to be the interesting thing here. Of course, once the token is not live yet, so I'm sure there are going to be a bunch of scams. You can go and check on their medium. I think it was their medium announcement or their substack.
00:09:45.026 - 00:10:18.720, Speaker B: You can go in and check if your wallet is eligible for tokens. But there's no token circulating yet, so everyone, please don't fall for scams. I never want to be first in claiming. I always want to see, like, other people go. There's like, no, I think there's less benefit of being first. Your second question, going back to it, is how does value accrue? Is a more important one, generally speaking. Again, the equity versus token.
00:10:18.720 - 00:10:59.722, Speaker B: I think you have to believe that everything kind of, in the case of Uniswap, in the case of optimism, there's still going to be this entity, whether it's uniswap labs or optimism labs, that is probably continuing the development of the network. But most of the value in the case of Uniswap is the swap fees. In the case of optimism, it would be some of the fees that are collected. You have to believe that the value is going to accrue to the token. The question is, should l two s have a token, and what does the token serve the purpose for here? That's a more difficult question to answer. I've had multiple conversations with people about l two s and the role in.
00:10:59.738 - 00:11:22.098, Speaker A: The token, because here I think one thing people might be failing to realize is that the op token is just a governance token for the optimism collective. It's not actually taking away from Ethereum or ETH in any way. Transactions are going to continue to get paid. Transaction fees are going to continue to get paid in ETH, not in this op. At least that's my understanding. I'm pretty sure I'm right there.
00:11:22.186 - 00:11:25.406, Speaker B: I think you're right. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:11:25.470 - 00:11:59.726, Speaker A: Which doesn't fully fit the narrative of maybe some of these l two s. I think a lot of people thought that l two s, okay, everyone's going to drop a token and then maybe that actually ends up hurting ETH. But it really helps the l two s. And the value starts to accrue away from ETH to the l two s because the transaction fees would start to get paid out in that native token. I think this is a good move by, by optimism, actually. I think it's not maximizing the op value right out of the gate, maybe, but it's still aligning themselves, really, with the ethereum community, which I think is a good move. Yeah.
00:11:59.726 - 00:12:13.834, Speaker A: Because keeping in mind what you said at the very beginning of this conversation, it's not like optimism has a monopoly on market share. They've got about 10% of the market share right now, and I think Arbitrum has about 50, 55% of the market share.
00:12:14.864 - 00:13:21.472, Speaker B: Yeah. It's like, your point is interesting in the sense of, does this actually detract from Ethereum, l one, meaning, not ethereum, does this detract from ETH, the native token, the substrate that you use to interact in Ethereum? My view is very simplistically, and if I'm wrong, and people in the community, I mean, if you think this is kind of totally wrong, take, please let me know. But I've always felt that we're still in the very super early stages of adoption. If what polygon is doing, what optimism and arbitram are doing, is just really increase the capacity of the network in a very meaningful way. And so you're still interacting with the l one. You're still, you're still, like, increasing network demand and block space. And so at the end of the day, if you, you know, with EIP 1559 in particular, it's just like you're, yes, more activity is happening this l two, but at the end of that, you're rolling back, you're bringing back some of that to l one to settle, ultimately, whether you're batching or in whatever frequency that you're doing, but you're still coming back to the l one to make that state transition.
00:13:21.472 - 00:13:27.576, Speaker B: And so ultimately, it's sort of like, I think it's net positive no matter what.
00:13:27.680 - 00:13:27.968, Speaker A: Sure.
00:13:28.016 - 00:14:18.428, Speaker B: There might be some nuances in the token design and the token structure. If you're paying a native currency like Polygon or in this case, optimism, or if starkware or arbitrum were to launch their tokens, I ultimately think that it's net positive for Ethereum. It just increases the ability, and I guess, the interest, perhaps, of users to come to that l two and interact versus going to perhaps another chain like BSc or Cosmos or Polkadot or whatever, they still remain faced with a choice, I'll put it this way, faced with a choice of going to an l two or going to another chain like Solana, what do you think is better for Ethereum? Yeah. And so I think ultimately you want to keep users in l two environment and on the margin, it's better than them totally rage, quitting, going elsewhere.
00:14:18.596 - 00:14:47.824, Speaker A: Yeah. And what optimism's done is build. I mean, they've built a great flywheel here. Right. So I think it's most interesting from a governance perspective, with this kind of two collective model or two house model. But the economics, right, the optimism protocol generates revenue today from transaction fees and eventually from auctioning off the right to sequence transactions, aka like, block space is valuable, right? And we all know that. And it becomes even more valuable as the ecosystem gets richer and richer and richer.
00:14:47.824 - 00:15:54.460, Speaker A: And then this protocol revenue will be used to fund public goods through these rounds of, like, retroactive voting. And then this creates ecosystem wide incentives to build for public benefit. Right? And so now you've got this flywheel, right? So you've got, like, demand for op block space drives generation of sequencer revenue, which drives funding via these retroactive votes, which drives value to the users and builders, which drives more demand for op block space. And so, yeah, they built a really nice, really nice flywheel here. So I think one other interesting thing that they've done, I'd like to get your take on this is uniswap had this, they popularized the one and done airdrop. Right? You use our product, and at some point when we launch this token, or we're trying to get mainstream adoption of the token, we're going to do this airdrop, and it's going to be one time. This feels like a line in the sand where the one and done airdrop model gets abandoned in favor of a more multi round, iterative airdrop machine.
00:15:54.460 - 00:15:56.388, Speaker A: So I'd like to get your takes on that.
00:15:56.556 - 00:16:02.278, Speaker B: Yeah. You're saying that that 14% that's reserved for future airdrops. I think it's smart.
00:16:02.406 - 00:16:08.854, Speaker A: Yeah, well, they really only did 5% right out of the gate right now, and they reserve more for future airdrops. Yeah, exactly.
00:16:09.014 - 00:16:42.502, Speaker B: Yeah. Ultimately you want to have, look, it's going to get competitive, right? They're going first, other than Polygon, but they're going first. It's really, what's arbitrum going to do now in Starkware? But presumably arbitrum is coming next. And so you want to, as always, as a protocol, you want to reserve as much flexibility to, I mean, this is valuable currency to use down the road for BD, for partnerships, for referral programs, for whatever. And I actually saw this firsthand and yearn. You remember, like, the extreme cases, Wi Fi that got fully kind of. There was nothing left for airdrops.
00:16:42.502 - 00:17:13.870, Speaker B: The entire supply of Wi Fi was fully allocated to people that farmed Wi Fi early on. And then what do you do from that? And then, like, there was this whole discussion. I think ultimately what ended up happening is there was a mint that I was a big part of suggesting an increase in supply of Wifi. And a lot of that was reserved for partnerships and referrals. And. And I think it is super valuable currency. The worst spot that you can be as a protocol, is to not have any more of your native token to go around to be competitive in this environment.
00:17:14.022 - 00:17:37.720, Speaker A: Well, here's the. Here's the simple. Here's my simple way of thinking about it is if, let's say you're building a company, right? You're building a venture backed company, not in crypto, you would you usually, what happens is you allocate, like, maybe ten or 15% for employees right out of the gate. And when you hire employees and you want to give them some equity, you might give a little equity. And let's say you want to give some. Maybe you're a web3 native person. You want to give some of your community some.
00:17:37.720 - 00:17:51.196, Speaker A: Some of your equity. Um, you're going to give some of that pool to your. To your community. But you would never give it all in one. In one batch, in one fell swoop, right. You would never say, okay, we've. We've been building this company for two years now.
00:17:51.196 - 00:18:25.866, Speaker A: It's time to dump all of our ten to 15% options pool onto our community and employees. You would say, all right, we've got this 15% reserved. Why don't we give, like, 3% to employees and maybe some. Some big community members right now, but let's save some. Some dry gunpowder, right, for when we have more big employees that we need to hire, and when we have more big community members that we want to actually allocate this to. And so that's, like, this feels more in line with a model that does work decently well, which is, like, this almost employee options and equity pool that has existed for years and years and years.
00:18:26.010 - 00:18:28.534, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a great analogy. I think.
00:18:28.954 - 00:19:01.096, Speaker A: I really like that optimism kind of found the maximum number of ways to reward as many on chain behaviors as possible. So they didn't just say, okay, we're going to look at the optimism behaviors. They said, we're going to look at all of the long term loyal behaviors of a user in crypto, and we're going to reward them. And I think other projects have almost approached this as, like, how can we, process of elimination, take out people who have not interacted with us? And they almost penalize people who didn't do enough. So, yeah, I like that by the team. Yeah.
00:19:01.120 - 00:19:42.442, Speaker B: I think the key highlight here, as you point out, is still too early to tell what is actually getting be governed. What is the impact to ethereum l one like particularly ETH and value cool layer? The more important one here from an experiment standpoint thing that I'm going to be looking at closely is this kind of non token holder centric Dao governance multi chamber, which I think is pretty interesting because it becomes less of a how a corporation is run, meaning that is if you own 10% of the company, you can control it, you can sway it, if you own it's more so like actual politics, which is every sitting Madison has one vote and it will be pretty interesting to observe how that happens.
00:19:42.628 - 00:19:59.694, Speaker A: Yeah, tldr this is a new approach to l two decentralization and governance. I think it's going to influence pretty much all other l two s. As Vitalik said, this is possibly the biggest attempt at non token holder centric Dao governance so far. And yeah, really excited to see where this goes. So congrats to the optimism.
00:19:59.734 - 00:20:02.154, Speaker B: Team l two summer.
00:20:02.734 - 00:20:27.144, Speaker A: L two summer baby. L two summer. All right, let me pose a question before we get into the next topic, which is this board apex Instagram hack 2020 summer Defi Summer really drove the defi market for the next twelve months. 2021 Summer Solana Summer really kicked off the l one battle, right? 2022. What's the summer of 2022?
00:20:29.724 - 00:20:33.384, Speaker B: Rising inflation? I don't know.
00:20:33.764 - 00:20:36.346, Speaker A: I guess if I the Summer of Empire.
00:20:36.460 - 00:21:28.966, Speaker B: If I go back to my predictions that I just opened up now, I predicted that the merge was going to happen in Q two, which is Ethereum's transition to proof of stake. If you layer on top of that, this l two rising activity because of token drop and just more protocols like deploying and migrating to l two, I think that sets. And this goes back to the episode with Travis just renewed interest in Ethereum. I felt that a lot of last year was fair criticisms to Ethereum, but at the same time a lot of capital migrating away from the Ethereum ecosystem. You remember the battle between sue and Kane in a very public manner. I think a lot of investors have been neglecting Ethereum for a while. It's not perfect, but at the same time it's hard to overlook it.
00:21:28.966 - 00:21:58.554, Speaker B: And sometimes it's crazy because as an investor you always want to go for the new shiny toy, meaning the new l one, and try to replicate that. And look, it's exciting. I get it. Some l one s are truly at the cutting edge and trying to innovate. And Ethereum was like that a couple of years ago. But it has felt that a lot of the attention has shifted elsewhere and I think this is positive to bring it back home. I call it home because I'm mostly Ethereum centric.
00:21:58.554 - 00:22:17.518, Speaker B: That's no surprise there. But I think, yeah, the merge plus this l two kind of wars, if you will. I think it's a summer where Ethereum, it's a new chapter for Ethereum and it will be front and center, I think if you're in crypto and you're in web3, I think it's going to be hard to overlook.
00:22:17.686 - 00:22:37.364, Speaker A: Yeah, I completely agree. I would say the summer is categorized by two things. One is Ethereum. I think Ethereum ends up having a really exciting summer. And the second is all of these crypto games that I know you're, you know and love them and you're very deep into. A lot of them are actually launching this summer. So that should make for a really exciting.
00:22:37.404 - 00:22:52.876, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, um. Um, we, the episode with Kieran is coming out this week. Had a really good discussion with him. People know that I'm an investor. I'm very active. This is a project I spent the most amount of time. But the game launched and is out this week and for the first kind of batch of testers.
00:22:52.876 - 00:22:59.200, Speaker B: And, um. It's pretty awesome. Yeah, it's very awesome. And it goes back to what Brooks, that episode with Brooks.
00:22:59.232 - 00:22:59.448, Speaker A: Right.
00:22:59.496 - 00:23:46.388, Speaker B: Who's building nor. He said it very clearly. It's, you know, if it, if you, if it's not fun, meaning if you get, if you have all the money in the world and you're still playing it, then that's the game. And I think that's what I feel that a lot of. To your point, a lot of these web3 games launching soon are gonna approximate or actually fulfill that characteristic, which is so important. The last thing I'll say is, I tweeted about this just on the gaming front. I think we should move away from saying play to earn and rebrand as play and earn, because play to earn is just like a terrible term that I think opens up to unfair criticisms of where this space is kind of truly headed.
00:23:46.388 - 00:23:51.742, Speaker B: And it doesn't really capture the opportunity set here, which is you're playing and earning, but you're playing.
00:23:51.798 - 00:24:19.444, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I agree. I like that. A couple days ago, bored ape. Let's see. What is it? So the 25th, the morning of the 25th, the official bored Ape yacht club Instagram account was hacked. The hacker posted fraudulent link to a copycat of the bored ape website with a fake airdrop where users were prompted to sign a safe transfer form transaction. This transferred their assets to the scammers website.
00:24:19.444 - 00:25:05.088, Speaker A: Obviously, board Ape immediately discovered the hack. They alerted the community, they removed the links from the compromised IG account and they attempted to recover the account. They made a post on Twitter, but it happened pretty quickly and there were several million dollars worth of nfts hacked, which is really, just really too bad. I think there were like four bored apes, six mutant apes, a couple of kennels, a couple other just like really valuable nfts were, were transferred to the hacker. And based on the floor price of all of those nfts, it's looking like between like seven to $12 million worth of value from these nfts that were hacked. So, yeah, I don't know, it's really, it's really just a shame. And I think it is a reminder that when you make a mistake with bear assets, there's no getting it back.
00:25:05.088 - 00:25:19.056, Speaker A: Right? If I make a mistake with my bank of America account and I send a wire to a routing number that has the wrong thing, I can get that back. Right? I can call b of a and chase or whoever it is and get that back. There's no getting this back. There's no calling metamask and getting this, this transaction fixed.
00:25:19.200 - 00:25:58.510, Speaker B: No, I agree. I think the positive element of all this is that it is becoming harder for a hacker to take leave with funds, in this case the NFT. You sell it, you try to withdraw those funds from a centralized exchange. Good luck. You can use tornado, but I think as an industry we were unfortunate, but through trial and error, we're becoming more like unified in that front to like, okay, fine, hacks will happen. People are going to get their keys compromised for whatever reason, unfortunately. But it's a transparent system, so it's kind of hard to get away with it.
00:25:58.510 - 00:26:42.178, Speaker B: So that's the upside of it. Of course, it's not fun. It can happen to anyone, really. The thing that Kobe highlighted, which I think is really smart, is we need better custody solutions for both ERC twenty s and nfts, and just bare assets in general. And so whether it's a multisig, whether it's a trusted custodian, but ultimately like an EOA, which is this sort of like assets sitting in just one wallet that can, with a click of a button, you can make a terrible mistake. Feels like a, feels like very much v one. And then we're going to be looking back on this and saying, everything should be controlled by multiple.
00:26:42.178 - 00:27:00.694, Speaker B: There should be some, a more human friendly logic to everything, right? Of course, it comes at the expense of speed at times. Right. When you're trying to. Anyone that's been in Dao governance. Yeah, good luck trying to corral, like, multi Sig votes over the weekend. It's. It's impossible.
00:27:00.694 - 00:27:20.434, Speaker B: But, you know, when you're just, again, when you're. These are not low value items. Right. And so sometimes it's okay to be slow on these things. And so I think, yeah, I'm hopeful. I think this is a big opportunity for someone to build, like, a custody solution for nfts for, like, retail.
00:27:20.594 - 00:27:44.560, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. I mean, I think there are two ways to go here. One is. So here's what Kobe said, by the way, for anyone who didn't see the Kobe tweet, he said yuga labs or apecoin, Dao should create a custody service ASAP. They're the only people that have the trust and distribution. They could give an official custody to ape. NFT that is not a redeemable receipt, but acts as a proof of ape so that bored ape owners can still flex with a hot wallet.
00:27:44.560 - 00:28:28.528, Speaker A: Users would KYC add their board apes to ape cage custody. It's a nice marketing name. Kobe, obviously, marketing genius. And in return get the same ape minted with some unique cage custody design. Users can show off that they own a cool ape with their own wallet with proof of a proceed, but they need to KYC to withdraw the ape. I think there are two things that should either happen. One is that Coinbase, you should be able to custody your nfts in more of a coinbase or a kraken or a Gemini type of solution, or what some of the big projects should do, I think, is partner with someone like a fire blocks copper Coinbase Gemini.
00:28:28.528 - 00:28:33.320, Speaker A: I'm going to upset someone because I forgot to mention them here. But one of the big custodians and.
00:28:33.352 - 00:28:41.640, Speaker B: Basically launch whoever we mention is because we're in top of mind. And if that's. You go and build this goddamn thing because you'll then be top of mind.
00:28:41.792 - 00:28:58.374, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. So, like. No, but, but really, like, bored ape could. Could partner with Coinbase custody or with Gemini custody or with Bitgo or with fire blocks and create a white label you would never know as fire blocks behind the scenes. But create a bored ape custody solution, it really wouldn't be too hard.
00:28:58.534 - 00:29:14.474, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I agree. I mean, this is an opportunity. Big, big opportunity. I think I have been surprised. I was going back to one of my initial conversations. So I've owned bored apes before.
00:29:15.694 - 00:29:19.114, Speaker A: I didn't know you were an ape owner. So when did you buy and when did you flip?
00:29:20.254 - 00:29:24.998, Speaker B: I minted. Oh, you meant it minted. And then also you sold too early.
00:29:25.046 - 00:29:27.074, Speaker A: That's why. That's why you're salty about the apes.
00:29:27.814 - 00:29:33.190, Speaker B: I just. Aesthetically, they don't appeal to me as much as other nfts.
00:29:33.342 - 00:29:33.846, Speaker A: Sure.
00:29:33.950 - 00:29:50.112, Speaker B: Sure. That being said, I'm very impressed with what they built. This is. I will continue to say it and I will be very upfront. This has been my terrible, my worst takes of my predictions for 2022, which was that the punk floor would always be above board apes. Like, yeah, folks. Anyone listening? I'm an idiot.
00:29:50.112 - 00:29:54.824, Speaker B: Thank you. I think about this a lot. I lose sleep over certain things. But, hey, we live and we learn. I'm not perfect. What.
00:29:54.864 - 00:29:57.920, Speaker A: What price do you sell? Sell your, uh, your board a back.
00:29:57.992 - 00:30:20.652, Speaker B: The first one was like a 30 ETH. I felt it was toppy 30 then. Then 40. And I was like, all right. And I was having a conversation with Tom, a shout out to Tom Delphi. And we both said, like, it feels like NFT is like, it feels like irrational exuberance here. Like, yeah, like, like there's a rotation that's going to happen imminently to, like, ethereum to defy, which has been totally out of favor.
00:30:20.652 - 00:30:25.476, Speaker B: We still are here. You have a zookeez and you have moonbirds and you have.
00:30:25.620 - 00:30:32.060, Speaker A: Oh, my God. Mike and I have this. We could. Mike and I could have joined you on that conversation. We have this. We have this talk every single day.
00:30:32.132 - 00:30:32.948, Speaker B: I'm like, when's it going to end?
00:30:32.956 - 00:30:50.224, Speaker A: It feels like it's a little too toppy in NFTs. And I was telling Mike that, I was like, yeah, I've been diving really deep into the Moonbirds project. And I was like, we should. We should really cover NFTs more closely. And Mike's like, that's a top signal. I was like, you've been saying top signal in NFTs for 18 months now.
00:30:50.524 - 00:30:54.268, Speaker B: At some point now we have music NFTs and everyone's talking about music NFTs.
00:30:54.316 - 00:30:55.340, Speaker A: Yeah, total.
00:30:55.412 - 00:31:01.724, Speaker B: To be fair, I've just stopped paying attention to stuff. I mean, it's. I pay attention to it because I invest in NFT infrastructure.
00:31:01.844 - 00:31:05.724, Speaker A: Right. But, you know, you're not buying. You're not like, I'm not buying.
00:31:05.844 - 00:31:23.120, Speaker B: Most people think that I'm collecting. Like, I've outsourced my collecting to, like, pleaserd out because that's just like, we go for really high value stuff that is iconic to Internet culture. And that's it. Like, I'm a decent percentage of pleaser and I'm happy with that. Like, I'm involved. I'm in the book. I'm the council.
00:31:23.120 - 00:31:29.880, Speaker B: Like this is. But asked me last time, I kind of went in D Gen wise and like, minted stuff.
00:31:29.952 - 00:31:46.228, Speaker A: Yeah. We interrupt your programming with a special announcement. Empire has a new sponsor. Santi and I are very excited to welcome BitMex. That is right. Bitmex is back. The exchange we all know and love is back and better than ever.
00:31:46.228 - 00:32:12.112, Speaker A: We're going to be dropping a couple updates on Bitmex over the next couple of months. This first one is a big one coming soon. Bitmex is rolling out their spot exchange and they're giving away $500,000 in bitcoin to new users. That's right. Listening to Empire has got the alpha Santia and I got you $500,000 in bitcoin going to new users for the ogs. I don't think I need to tell you why you need to use BitMex. It's a love of the game kind of thing.
00:32:12.112 - 00:32:43.362, Speaker A: You respect crypto, you use Bitmex for those newer to the industry, Bitmex has a long and great history of innovation. Since their launch in 2014, they created perps and a whole lot more. Now they're back, they're better than ever. They're making waves. So what do you need to do? Go sign up for the Bitmex spot exchange for a chance to win some of the $500,000 in bitcoin that Bitmex is giving away. Bitmexbitmex.com. That's bitmex.com.
00:32:43.362 - 00:32:58.650, Speaker A: Go make it happen. Now. Let's get back to the show. So you're not paying attention to, like, Aku. Like, Aku Dream, like, Akutars just launch. Or accutars, whatever they call Aku dreams. And, like, obviously moonbirds just went up from like a two to like, what, 35 or something.
00:32:58.762 - 00:32:59.042, Speaker B: You're not.
00:32:59.058 - 00:33:00.472, Speaker A: You're not paying attention to this.
00:33:00.658 - 00:33:03.108, Speaker B: I'm paying attention. I'm not. Like, you're not.
00:33:03.156 - 00:33:04.012, Speaker A: You're not participating?
00:33:04.068 - 00:33:05.340, Speaker B: I'm not participating, no.
00:33:05.412 - 00:33:06.104, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:33:06.444 - 00:33:25.876, Speaker B: And, you know, I was thinking about this last night. It's just like, I'm reading this really good book by Robert Greene. He's a little bit Machiavelli, but it's like laws of human nature. It's just good because it has a lot of historical references about characters and archetypes. And it's like, you gotta write what?
00:33:25.900 - 00:33:26.980, Speaker A: The 48 laws of power.
00:33:27.052 - 00:33:38.918, Speaker B: He wrote the 48 laws of power, which are super Machiavelli. You know, people read this and, like, start applying it. I'm like. And sometimes they, like, chill. Like, I know you're applying rule 47 right now. Like, back off. But it's dense.
00:33:38.918 - 00:34:12.042, Speaker B: And so I think, like, you know, one of the, like, one of the most recent, like, chapters I was reading is, like, newton. People forget, but, like, Newton, like, got terribly rugged investing in, like, the South Sea company or something. Like Isaac Newton, like, ladies and gents, the guy that, like, the apple fell and he, like, developed all these kind of, like, really in foundational piece in physics. He was a terrible investor, and, like, he fell trapped to, like, fomo. And, like, you're literally reading this and it's like, it happens to everyone.
00:34:12.178 - 00:34:12.450, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:34:12.482 - 00:34:45.032, Speaker B: And my takeaway to that is, like, I just have found comfort in, like, sticking to what I know best and trying to perfect my edge. And, like, it is very, very hard for me to really kind of focus on that and build the themes and do what I think do best and, like, participate in every single mint and, like, keep track of. It's just, like, impossible. And I've sort of, like, come to terms that I'm not. I'm not going to, a, catch them all, b, be the first. But if look at board apes as an example. Yeah, I was terribly wrong there.
00:34:45.032 - 00:34:50.024, Speaker B: My lesson there is pay attention to what's happening. And it's funny because I've.
00:34:50.144 - 00:34:50.600, Speaker A: If you.
00:34:50.632 - 00:35:37.440, Speaker B: If you go back and, like, pretty much every episode that we've recorded or that I've been a part of, not just here, I talk about bored apes of how interesting it has been in how they've went to market and they build a community and they're laying a bunch of services around that, and it's attracting, capturing the imagination. People that are not in crypto and, like, over 50% of their people in the community, this is their first thing related to crypto, maybe their only one. And for me, like, I should have just paid attention to what I was saying, you know? Cause maybe someone that was listening to this probably went out and bought a board. Eight, but 20 and 30 and 40. And here we are, 147. And that's been my learning. And so my takeaway there is, you know, I'm not going to be first in many of these things, but at least you asked me if I pay attention.
00:35:37.440 - 00:35:56.260, Speaker B: Yeah, I pay attention to moonbirds. Yeah, I'm paying attention to Azuki's because Azuki's are attracting a very interesting crowd. And so, like, you know, keep an open mind about how high these floors can get. Maybe. I don't know. I thought it was top before board.
00:35:56.292 - 00:36:30.874, Speaker A: Apes at 50, you should participate in every part of crypto. So you should go buy nfts, and you should experience what it's like to bridge assets from one l, one into the other. You should go play a crypto game. You should play a couple of crypto games, right? You should trade on a Dex. You should also get a ledger and see what it's like to use a ledger. You should also hold some crypto with, like, a centralized service and see what that onboarding is like. You should have, you should participate in every aspect of the crypto ecosystem.
00:36:30.874 - 00:37:16.924, Speaker A: That being said, you should minimize fomo and trying to play at every aspect of the crypto ecosystem perfectly. And the reason for this is if you're always chasing nfts or if you're trying to yield farm perfectly, there's only so much mental bandwidth a human can have. That's time that's taken away from your most valuable project, whatever that may be. So I don't even know what it is for you, but for me, it's blockworks, right? So, like, every time I'm chasing another NFT or minting or, like, yield farming to try to optimize my optimism, airdrop, that's time that's taken away from me building. Building blockworks. And, like, for anyone who wants to build something impactful and long term, like, all of those times you're chasing something else in crypto, is time that you're not actually building something impactful.
00:37:17.384 - 00:37:43.644, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. I think your point's a very good one, which is, I think hobbyists are early, and Chris has a great Chris from a 16 c, Chris Dixon. He says technology really starts at the fringes by these hobbyists, whether it's like radios or the Internet. And crypto very much is like that, too. And I think hobbyists are just generally curious, curious beings. Above average. They have above average curiosity.
00:37:43.644 - 00:38:24.262, Speaker B: And in crypto, I think you want to be experimenting with a lot of things to. To hone in on what you do best. A lot of people come and ask, hey, how do I get involved in this space? I'm like, well, you just named ten things they could do, right? And in that process, you're going to probably uncover things that are not working very well in the space. And so for that reason, I think you should always maintain a level of curiosity and over time, just kind of ossify and solidify certain frameworks and areas of interest, and I think that's. And moved into space for a while. And so I think for me, I do early stage pretty actively. This is what I do, and I'm trying to find the next aave, the next step in the next alluvium.
00:38:24.262 - 00:38:31.518, Speaker B: And it's kind of impossible for me to really kind of do that to the best of my ability by participating in every single NFT drop. It's impossible, right?
00:38:31.606 - 00:39:19.724, Speaker A: Yeah. All right, let's move on to another piece of news, which is stablecoins. It looks like when something happens in crypto, usually other people, something happens and it goes well, other people follow suit and shout out to our buddy do Kwon over at Terra has done something really interesting with USD, and other builders are keeping an eye on that and actually following suit. So two announcements. One is Justin sun of Tron announced that he is launching, or I guess they are launching a Tron. Dao is launching USDD, which is a decentralized, algorithmic stablecoin that is going to be pegged to the dollar, and they will have $10 billion worth of crypto that they're using as collateral. If the $10 billion sounds familiar, it's because, or it's.
00:39:19.724 - 00:39:37.316, Speaker A: I don't want to say because, but it's similar to do. Kwon's plans to acquire $10 billion of bitcoin to serve as the reserves for UST. I think the interest rate on this for what he said was, I've got. This summer, I think it's 30. The trondao. Yeah. Will administer a reserve with a 30% interest rate.
00:39:37.380 - 00:39:38.116, Speaker B: 30%?
00:39:38.260 - 00:40:01.864, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, 30%. And then on the other side of things, you've got Ilya and who we recently on the podcast, great episode, Nir is launching USN, which is another stable coin. I think this is actually going to have a 10% interest rate to start, but maybe go up to like 20%, they said. What are your thoughts on all of these stables starting to hit the market?
00:40:02.804 - 00:40:54.308, Speaker B: I mean, I haven't looked closely. I mean, 30% doesn't sound like risk free or sustainable, but sure, fine. Maybe it's sort of the gimmicky, like, clickbait flashed savings rate, and then they drop it to, like ten or five or one. But no, look, I mean, every ecosystem needs to have a robust kind of stable coin offering. And whether it's native, built by the team, or it's some variation of. I still remember talking to the maker team over time, and in stablecoins, I've invested in a few all across the spectrum of some, like, circle and looking at that and looking at what they were building, which has built an incredible business off of, like, the consortium of USCC to algorithmic stable coins and everything in between. Maker kind of as a senior model, like.
00:40:54.308 - 00:41:26.022, Speaker B: And the maker team was like, there's kind of. When you think about it, there's really no benefit of going first and designing a stable coin that is not centralized because it can be easily copied. Of course, there's distribution in motes and what have you. But if you're a brand new l one or that's taking off, it just opens up the possibility of someone copying elements of what's working in Ethereum and then just bringing it back. I think that's what you're seeing here. I think it's net positive, ultimately. I think that having stablecoin diversity is.
00:41:26.022 - 00:41:55.302, Speaker B: I've always felt that, like, stablecoin centralization, meaning it is kind of the Achilles heel of the industry. Right? I mean, you shut off USDC and, like, defi collapses. I wonder why more people are not talking about the systemic risk, perhaps that terra might pose to some. To bitcoin. They're gonna have a lot of bitcoin in their balance sheet. Like, what happens if they have to sell bitcoin immediately to stabilize the peg? Like, okay, bitcoin maximus, like pomp or, like, woohoo. You know, we have that.
00:41:55.318 - 00:41:58.812, Speaker A: It's, like, perfect collateral so that there's always a buyer.
00:41:58.988 - 00:42:23.472, Speaker B: Right, no, I get that. I get that. But when you try to liquidate, like, four billions of dollars of bitcoin, like, in a flash. Yeah, you know, that's not gonna be fun. You know, it's like, if Satoshi all of a sudden move this coins, like, all hell breaks loose. And so, yeah, you know, I think these just. Again, I'm not, like, being critical.
00:42:23.472 - 00:42:48.044, Speaker B: It's just like, there's a higher concentration of a bitcoin holder here, which is the terra, like, LFG or whatever. If they need to kind of recapitalize and sell some of those reserves to stabilize the peg, then, well, that's gonna have a. You know, that. That might not be as fun for a bitcoiner looking at that, but, yeah. Or a ramble. I'm saying is, these are interesting things. I don't know how Tron's gonna sustain 30%.
00:42:48.044 - 00:43:01.324, Speaker B: If Justin's listening, we'll love to have you on and just talk about this. And I think you went to Wharton, so, you know, I think, like, you know, 30% is not necessarily risk free or sustainable. So we'd love to have a senior.
00:43:01.624 - 00:43:03.144, Speaker A: He went to Wharton, you think?
00:43:03.264 - 00:43:10.364, Speaker B: I think he went to Wharton, yeah, I love to have the senior economist and the Tron foundation come in and enlighten us and how this is sustainable.
00:43:10.824 - 00:43:13.856, Speaker A: He just followed me on Twitter last week, so now I can dm him. So.
00:43:13.920 - 00:43:14.672, Speaker B: Okay, great.
00:43:14.808 - 00:43:16.100, Speaker A: I'll dm him. Bring him on.
00:43:16.192 - 00:43:20.744, Speaker B: Great, let's bring him on. Or his senior economic advisor, whoever that might be.
00:43:21.364 - 00:43:46.282, Speaker A: Cool. Yeah, we'll see. Yeah. It's interesting, this feels like a rerun of the l one when all the l one stuff was playing out last summer after Solana ran up and then Avalanche and things got really, really hot. And then basically all these ecosystem funds announced because it was like, oh, there needs to be a shit ton of capital that goes into these l one ecosystems. So let's fundraise to build on these ecosystems. Now.
00:43:46.282 - 00:44:09.614, Speaker A: It's like, oh, all these new ecosystems need a stable coin. I don't actually think they all need a stable coin, but they all think that they do. And so you're going to get the near stablecoin and the tron stable coin. And the question just becomes, maybe avalanche doesn't go build the avalanche stablecoin because they're now in bed with the terror ecosystem. Because Doe made a really smart move buying avalanche as collateral.
00:44:09.914 - 00:44:14.352, Speaker B: Isn't the analogy here. Every country has its own currency.
00:44:14.528 - 00:44:18.968, Speaker A: Yeah, but that's a horrible model. It's a. Unless you're a central banker.
00:44:19.056 - 00:44:22.324, Speaker B: I just said it was an analogy. I wasn't endorsing the analogy.
00:44:22.784 - 00:44:23.584, Speaker A: It's a shit.
00:44:23.624 - 00:44:30.736, Speaker B: It's a shit for anyone that's traveled. Yeah, these are all shit coins. Like, all of them. Most of.
00:44:30.760 - 00:45:04.144, Speaker A: There's this amazing post by wences Casaris, founder of Zappo. I still think he is the best, like, thinker about bitcoin in the world. It's a shame. He sold Zappo and it turned into Coinbase custody. So what we know of as Coinbase custody is actually Zappo Xapo. But he wrote this piece maybe four years ago or five years ago or something. And he was like, what would happen if bitcoin was the global reserve? Not the global reserve currency, but the global reserve layer of the world? So everything would actually get priced.
00:45:04.144 - 00:45:36.090, Speaker A: It would basically become the pricing mechanism for which all prices are quoted in. So instead of, like, when you say, what is the yen trading at today? Right, you quote it in, like, us dollars. But if you say, what's the US dollar trading in, it's like, you quote it in another currency and it's like, all right, what is the GDP of Indonesia? What is the price of oil? Like, it's all kind of quoted in us dollars right now, I would say. Or it's all quoted in another currency or in the local currency. But what if bitcoin was like this global reserve pricing mechanism.
00:45:36.122 - 00:45:38.682, Speaker B: Satoshis. For which everything gets price in satoshis.
00:45:38.778 - 00:45:39.666, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly.
00:45:39.770 - 00:45:51.634, Speaker B: Yeah. Wentz is by far one of the best thinkers. I would definitely agree with you. I would encourage everyone to go and maybe we can link him in the show notes. Like, he just cr. Hes just a true visionary. I think he was very active in the art bitcoin channel, too.
00:45:51.634 - 00:45:54.906, Speaker B: And like, yeah, yeah, he spent.
00:45:54.930 - 00:46:04.088, Speaker A: I think he spent a 250 before he invested. He spent like $250,000 of his own money trying to hack bitcoin before he ever made a purchase. So there's.
00:46:04.136 - 00:46:38.394, Speaker B: At one time I was thinking has also been in the episode with Kieran. I was talking about, like, clusters of vibrant web, three crypto communities. Argentina is very much one you and, I think, in large. In large. Credit to wences, who's argentinian. And I think he was a true luminary and inspired a bunch of other people to join. Like, you know, you have open zeppelin, you have a bunch of core devs in a number of projects that are argentinian.
00:46:38.394 - 00:46:57.206, Speaker B: A lot of, like, core researchers and white hackers are in Argentina. So. Yeah, no, it's. The other one is Australia, of course. But I can't think of, like, perhaps those are the two most vibrant kind of communities that I've seen. Clusters. I don't know if you can think of any others.
00:46:57.350 - 00:47:29.504, Speaker A: No, but that's a good. Yeah, I mean, he's done an amazing job. It's funny, I went to this. One of the last things of interesting news here is osmosis is going to vote in Axelar today as the kind of canonical Bridge and, like, EVM bridge. And there's been, like, these several months of debate on which bridge osmosis should choose as their canonical bridge to bring these, like, EVM assets into the osmosis ecosystem. So you had wormhole or. Or gravity bridge or Nomad or axilar.
00:47:29.504 - 00:47:59.034, Speaker A: I don't think we should talk too much about this, because Sonny from osmosis is. Is going to actually come on the show and we should let him talk about this. But one issue I think this is. I think this is really important, and it actually shows why bridges are sometimes not amazing when you have several different bridges. I don't know if you've actually looked at this, but, like, the UI, the UX is horrible right now. There's like eight. Let's say you have, like, let's say you have, like USDC gets bridged over and there's like eight different bridges.
00:47:59.034 - 00:48:27.624, Speaker A: There's like UsDCa, USDC B, USDC, USDC D, USDCA, USDc bb. And the UX is so fricking confusing. It's like, imagine if you went into your bank account and there was like. Or you went on to Coinbase and you had like twelve different kinds of bitcoin. Or you had, you went into your bank account and there's like eight different kinds of the US dollar. So I'm excited to see that actually get fixed when they kind of put their foot in the ground with one bridge.
00:48:28.244 - 00:48:37.724, Speaker B: Yeah, I don't have much to add here other than very excited to have both sunny, maybe Zaki or someone else come and talk about this.
00:48:37.884 - 00:49:04.196, Speaker A: Yeah, maybe we should bring on Tarun as well. Because one thought is if osmosis attracts the majority of EVM assets, then osmosis kind of becomes the default cosmos hub. So I'm curious about what the implication. So everyone would say, okay, that's bullish for Adam. I've heard Tarun, who we've had on the show, call Adam the doge of l one tokens. So I'd like to bring, maybe we bring Tarun on and show gets a little feisty, but that's something to keep an eye on.
00:49:04.340 - 00:49:05.064, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:49:06.084 - 00:49:36.184, Speaker A: Last two piece of news is just Fidelity announced they're going to be adding bitcoin as a 401K option later this year. There are 23,000 companies that use fidelity's retirement services. They can now add bitcoin to their employees investment options. Employees can then transfer up to 20% of their balance into a bitcoin holding account and divert up to 20% of their paycheck contributions there. Going forward, if this was in a bull market, this would be blasted around Twitter and people would be going crazy. This was pretty quiet news, quiet among the crypto community.
00:49:36.264 - 00:50:06.184, Speaker B: But to be fair, five independent people sent this to me that are not in crypto. I said, holy shit, this is a big thing. And I said, one of them. Yeah. And I was like, yep, it is. You know, it's almost, it's almost reminiscent to when the ER Isa ErISA laws got changed and allowing pension funds to invest in alternatives, including venture. And it just was a huge detonator for pension fund resources allocated to the asset class.
00:50:06.184 - 00:50:43.958, Speaker B: You know, in many ways, like, you're seeing that in real time. Like, you know, okay, we've had like, to be fair, we've had 401K structures and independent smaller kind of startups. I think there's a few that allow you to alto Ira and a bunch of others that allow you to do this. But nowhere near the scale of fidelity. Like Fidelity probably has the lion's share of like employee, like 401K plans through your employer. Right? Like when I was at JP Morgan, it was fidelity. When I was at another like an adventure fund, it was fidelity, right, until like, um, this is huge.
00:50:43.958 - 00:50:49.822, Speaker B: Huge. Because you're going to be covering like the vast majority of the US population probably has Fidelity 101 401K.
00:50:49.878 - 00:51:24.380, Speaker A: Like, yeah, yeah, this is uh, this is really exciting news. Um, and just speaking of exciting news and more capital flowing into the industry, huge shout out to, uh, our good buddy Haseeb over at Dragonfly. Dragonfly is one of the best crypto funds, um, at least in my opinion. Um, and uh, they just raised a $650 million fund. Uh, this is their, I think, third fund, uh, $650 million. They brought in several Ivy League endowments. Invesco, an undisclosed southeast Asia state owned investment company, Sequoia invested in the fund.
00:51:24.380 - 00:52:03.158, Speaker A: Sequoia, China, KKR Tiger. I remember talking to them a little while ago. They were originally planning on raising 500 million for the fund and so clearly they exceeded the goal of 500 and topped out at 650. Dragonfly's brief history, they raised $100 million fund back in 2018, $225 million fund in 2021. So just, yeah, they've had a massive amount of success. And actually just speaking to several founders recently, a lot of them say that Dragonfly is one of the most helpful companies on their cap table. It's probably because a lot of their team comes from like an engineering background instead of an investing background.
00:52:03.158 - 00:52:10.220, Speaker A: And, yeah, so just amazing work by Dragonfly. Big shout out to, to tom over there and Haseeb and the entire team. Really nice work.
00:52:10.342 - 00:52:14.584, Speaker B: Yeah, my interaction with Dragonfly have been super positive and I would echo that as well.
00:52:14.744 - 00:52:17.804, Speaker A: Yeah, so, all right, man, I think that's it.
00:52:18.104 - 00:52:31.512, Speaker B: I think so. Well, per tradition, I recommended a book, but any recent shows or books that you've read that are interesting, I'm listening.
00:52:31.528 - 00:52:43.318, Speaker A: To a podcast right now called, I actually hate recommending this podcast because the title is so freaking cheesy. It's called how to take over the world, which is like, oh, so cringe in my mind, how to take over the world.
00:52:43.366 - 00:52:45.742, Speaker B: More cringe. Empire. You mean stop.
00:52:45.838 - 00:52:56.430, Speaker A: I like that name, by the way. Rebrand Empire coming soon. Shout out to our design team. They've been working super hard. So excited to get your. Your. Your pretty face on the COVID and stuff like that.
00:52:56.430 - 00:53:10.830, Speaker A: So how to take over the world is this podcast. It's a history podcast. My favorite history podcast. They just did episodes on. They basically do these, like, two to three hour episodes on different, like, figures. So I'm listening to the Walt Disney one right now. Let me scroll through some of the past ones.
00:53:10.830 - 00:53:28.462, Speaker A: They did like, 3 hours on Napoleon. They did 3 hours on alexander the great. I really. They did a great one on Putin, actually, so they had a great one on Putin. Tom, citizen, Frederick Douglass. I've listened to pretty much all of these. Julius Caesar Rothschild, Steve Jobs.
00:53:28.462 - 00:53:33.834, Speaker A: Yeah. Napoleon. Just like, for the history nerds out there, I'd really recommend the show.
00:53:34.594 - 00:53:35.962, Speaker B: Interesting. I'm gonna check that.
00:53:35.978 - 00:53:36.458, Speaker A: I love history.
00:53:36.506 - 00:53:40.234, Speaker B: There's one that's really good called hardcore history.
00:53:40.274 - 00:53:41.690, Speaker A: Hardcore history, yeah.
00:53:41.762 - 00:53:42.890, Speaker B: That's when I was thinking of.
00:53:42.962 - 00:53:49.842, Speaker A: Hardcore history is just like. It's like Dan. Dan Carlin. I've listened to all those. It's Dan Carlin's. And, like, it's. It's a bit dense in my mind.
00:53:49.842 - 00:53:59.374, Speaker A: It's like. Yeah, it's a lot, right. It's like, you want to listen to about, like, world War Two. It's like you're getting a 14 hours podcast. You know, it's like a college course.
00:53:59.674 - 00:54:19.906, Speaker B: Yeah, I have one. I started yesterday, so I. Not partial endorsement. Apple TV, they're doing a lot of these features around sports, like athletes. One just came out called. They call me magic, which is a history of magic Johnson. And I watched half of the first episode last night.
00:54:19.906 - 00:54:42.688, Speaker B: It looks pretty cool. I'm a sucker for these. The last dance, I think, is one of the best documentaries out there. Obviously, the history of the Chicago Bulls and Michael Jordan. You know, the Lance Armstrong documentaries. Free solo. All these documentaries, I was like, people that are at the peak of their discipline, I'm fascinated by, because I want to learn how they did it.
00:54:42.688 - 00:54:50.456, Speaker B: And magic Johnson is up there. He's pretty up there. So anyways, really good. So check it out.
00:54:50.640 - 00:55:07.240, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Here's a question for you. One thing that when you read it, when you. When you see these people who are, like, peak performers, I think one thing that's not always clearly shown is just the amount of sacrifice. I'm not talking sacrifice, like hard work. Like everyone. Everyone's peak is like hard work, you know, works.
00:55:07.240 - 00:55:16.184, Speaker A: Works their ass off and stuff. I'm talking, like, if you look at free solo, I forget the guy's name, but, like, he is. He's not afraid to die, right? And, like, that's a different level.
00:55:16.264 - 00:55:19.886, Speaker B: You mean, like, the part of his brain that recognizes emotion is totally shut off?
00:55:19.910 - 00:55:34.758, Speaker A: Is off? Yeah, exactly. Or, like, you know, Steve Jobs. People look at Steve Jobs like, I would love to be Steve Jobs. Like, that dude is a fucking asshole. And he built an amazing. He built apple, which was, like, the coolest company of all time and the most. One of the most impactful companies in history.
00:55:34.758 - 00:55:55.184, Speaker A: But, like, he also was an absolute dick and, like, had a kid, and I'm pretty sure, like, didn't take care of that kid or something like that. Or, like, was an asshole to the mother of that child. So, like, I think there's always sometimes for, like, these hyper, hyper, hyper. The most successful people in the world, there's always something like that. I found.
00:55:55.764 - 00:56:30.150, Speaker B: Yeah, like, there's a great interview by Elon Musk's former wife, and I found a lot of comfort in that because she said, I kind of always knew that Elon was gonna do his thing, and it wasn't easy being his wife, but seeing Elon do what he did was, like, rewarding for me. But was he the best husband? Probably not. Like. And so it was just, like. It's interesting to read that, because I think, ultimately, you're building a company. Like, you want to continue to perfect what you do. Like, I do think that.
00:56:30.150 - 00:56:46.418, Speaker B: I'm not a believer that you have to be an asshole to be successful. I think we over glorify that aspect, which is all. Steve Jobs was an asshole. Jeff Bezos, tough to work with. Michael Jordan. Incredible. Like, very, very demanding of his other teammates.
00:56:46.418 - 00:57:11.270, Speaker B: I don't think you need to be an asshole. I think. I think there's a fine line between being an asshole and demanding the best of people as a leader and the best scene. This is why I think the last answers, and I'll end it to here. The last stance for me was really a good documentary, to the point that I recommend it to anyone that I hired a paraphy, anyone that came to Paris, just watch this. Because our role here is to seek perfection. It's a single, like, as a franchise.
00:57:11.270 - 00:57:26.790, Speaker B: It was like being able to replicate what the Chicago Bulls did is like, no. Do you want to be number two? No one fucking remembers number two. You want to be number one. And you. What's most exciting about this industry is there is a wide open expanse to capture this. And, like, it's. It's incredibly exciting.
00:57:26.790 - 00:57:55.882, Speaker B: There's going to be sacrifices to that. And there's a great scene. There's a great, great scene where they're interviewing, like, a lot of Jordan's teammates and they all saying, yeah, you know, Michael had a thing of, like, he knew what your weakness was and he would exploit it. He would constantly put pressure on it for you to fix it. And they were like, it was really, really hard to be with Michael sometimes. It was super to the point that it was just drive you nuts. And then at the end, all of them, all of them looked down with their hands and they raised hands like they have the five, five rings, and no one could take that away from you.
00:57:55.882 - 00:58:20.888, Speaker B: Now, as Michael, an asshole, I don't know, but I think some people tend to think my conclusion is you can be very demanding without being an asshole. You can't control how other people might perceive that. But, like, if your intention is right, which is, let's actually be the best basketball team out there. Let's actually build the best media company out there. Let's actually be the best fund out there. If you're not willing to be on board, then you might as well leave now. Like, drop the towel.
00:58:20.936 - 00:58:31.940, Speaker A: I mean, winning. Winning and being number one solves a lot of things. So with that, here's your call to action. We're trying to build Crypto's best podcast. Go hit the subscribe button. Yo, Santa. I'm trying to win, baby.
00:58:31.940 - 00:58:38.364, Speaker A: I'm trying to win. We're trying to build the best podcast. Hit that. Like, if you're not willing to, you know, ask for it, then you're not.
00:58:38.404 - 00:58:43.052, Speaker B: I am reading the comments at one point, we'll share the story, but I am reading the comments, folks.
00:58:43.108 - 00:58:53.220, Speaker A: Oh, we also moved to a new YouTube channel. We split the macro and the crypto. The crypt, the macro. People did not like Santi and me. It was really, really getting in our heads.
00:58:53.292 - 00:59:00.438, Speaker B: Someone said, like, do these people really? Is this all they do for a living? Like, how miserable are they? I'm like, yeah, yeah. This is all I do.
00:59:00.486 - 00:59:10.374, Speaker A: Yes, this is all I do for a living. So anyways, all right, hit that. Subscribe if you're on YouTube, like, or no, follow it. Give us a five stars on Apple and Spotify, and we will see you guys next week.
00:59:10.454 - 00:59:12.742, Speaker B: All right, my friend. Great being here. Good to be back.
00:59:12.918 - 00:59:13.294, Speaker A: Take care.
