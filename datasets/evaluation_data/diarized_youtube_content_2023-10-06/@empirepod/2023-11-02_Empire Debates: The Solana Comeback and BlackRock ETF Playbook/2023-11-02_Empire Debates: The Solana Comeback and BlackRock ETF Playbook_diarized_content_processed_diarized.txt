00:00:00.240 - 00:00:05.406, Speaker A: Oh, by the way, if they really want to change the rules of a particular defi protocol, what's going to happen in an open source world?
00:00:05.470 - 00:00:06.554, Speaker B: You fork that.
00:00:07.574 - 00:00:30.844, Speaker A: And that's the beauty of these systems, that they're self ordering. And if there is some form of coercion or forced hand or wrong or a bad actor, then very quickly liquidity migrates at the speed of light, and so do users, and so does code. And that is incredibly powerful because it keeps the system in check.
00:00:33.304 - 00:00:50.204, Speaker C: Hey, everyone, welcome back to the debate series. I think. Yeah, I'm here with Ryan Santhe and myself. We're here to chat. We're going to start off with the ETF status and what's going on there. Ryan, why don't you take us away and start us off?
00:00:50.744 - 00:01:00.522, Speaker B: Well, I mean, you being in America, probably have a deeper understanding and are even more.
00:01:00.578 - 00:01:01.794, Speaker C: I do, but I wasn't ready.
00:01:01.914 - 00:02:11.674, Speaker B: Yeah, more excited for this than I am. But long story short, it does appear that blackrock and potentially others, are starting to populate what will eventually be an ETF. IBTC has shown up on some Blackrock websites, and it looks like it's only a matter of time. And that time is likely measured in months and not years. It's interesting that bitcoiners have been waiting for essentially decades now, or at least a decade, for two things, a bitcoin ETF and for global destabilization across macro markets. And both of those seem to be happening at the same time. So we see bitcoin kind of leading this rally, although I think there's a lot of excitement across the space about appending ETF right on the heels of bitcoin and what it'll mean broadly for crypto assets.
00:02:11.674 - 00:02:14.694, Speaker B: So what are your guys thoughts?
00:02:15.514 - 00:03:12.464, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't want to mid curve it. I think it is hugely impactful, like a lot of things, so difficult to understand what the impact will be in months, but measured in years. I think it is incredibly, incredibly positive for the space. It removes so much friction, it legitimizes access to it, and also it gives people a product to sell. All these registered investment advisors and financial guys, theres just another thing that they sell from a portfolio diversification standpoint, and I think thats incredibly positive. The folks at bitwise, Matt, I think, put a great chart of what gold did after an ETF approval, and if you look at that, I think you could, it may not be one to one. It might not, because we are in a tough macro, maybe higher for longer interest rate environment.
00:03:12.464 - 00:03:30.176, Speaker A: People are risk off. But still, I think in a matter of 510 year horizon, this is going to be a huge catalyst, probably one of the more important in the last five years, Ryan, people have been trying to get an ETF approved in crypto since forever.
00:03:30.340 - 00:03:31.072, Speaker B: Forever.
00:03:31.208 - 00:03:33.120, Speaker C: Michael Vost wins 2013. Right?
00:03:33.232 - 00:03:34.924, Speaker A: Exactly. Ten years.
00:03:35.784 - 00:04:21.232, Speaker C: Yeah. I think the most interesting thing to me was I had Hal press, Scott Johnson, James on the Delphi pod a couple of weeks ago to chat the ETF side. And it was a very different environment just a couple of weeks ago. And it seems like now that Grayscale won their case against the SEC, I think we're starting to see glimmers that the Sec has sort of caved in or kind of agreed that this is a reality. Right. And one of the key points there is, Scott called out that grayscale doesn't have to refile this 19 b four doc since they filed their s three a couple weeks ago, which is kind of like a technical thing, but I think it kind of means that this stuff is sort of in the bag. Right.
00:04:21.232 - 00:04:28.632, Speaker C: And then what does that mean? It just means we have an SEC that sort of, it seems like has to approve the ets at this point.
00:04:28.808 - 00:06:10.970, Speaker B: Yeah. The big question that I have is will they approve the grayscale or grayscale as an ETF, especially with the New York attorney general case against Grayscale? Or will they go sort of blue chip and kind of throw crypto a bone by approving one of the sanctioned overlords of America and Blackrock? And how does that play out for the space? I'm of the mind that the original sort of pitch that a lot of us used in kind of the 16 1718 era was that by 2025 or so, no self respecting family, office or institutional investment portfolio on the planet would be without one to 2% exposure to a crypto. I think that this is sort of like the last domino in that happening. The amount of capital onboarding that will happen through this is going to be huge. And the impact for something like ETH, which is even lower liquidity than bitcoin, is going to be a multiple of what were going to see for bitcoin. Because remember, it doesnt take two times capital to double the valuation. It takes probably somewhere around 10% of capital inflow in order to double the valuation, maybe even less, because so many coins have actually been lost and ETF's have to populate with the physical $100 billion.
00:06:10.970 - 00:06:43.404, Speaker B: ETF will need to have $100 billion of the given asset and they have to buy that and custody it and third party and so on and so forth. And so I'm of the opinion that we could be months away from really significant order of magnitude gains in blue chip assets in crypto because of the fact that these guys have to populate and they got to buy the 40% of bitcoin that still hasn't been lost on hard drives or spent on pizza.
00:06:45.624 - 00:07:46.122, Speaker A: That's a great point, Ryan. The interesting thing now is particularly something like ETH, like an approved stake network, where the availability of coins, well, two things come to mind. One, not only the liquidity, but the availability of said coins. Meaning if most of ETH is being staked, then it really reduces the coins in circulation, and so it creates even more of a reflexive dynamic. The other one is, are these ETF's going to offer and pass through staking rewards if they are staking the coins, and if they're not staking, then that should be pretty positive for the folks that are because the yield is higher. Because then all of a sudden you have maybe 20 whatever percentage of all ETH that will be held by this ETF's. If they're not being staked, then that is pretty positive for folks that are staking because the staking yield goes higher.
00:07:46.122 - 00:08:14.294, Speaker A: You enter this reflexive loop. That is very interesting. Now, the third thing is, if you have an ETF that also passes through some of the staking rewards, that's like a REIT. I mean, that's just a technology upside with dividend component to it. I mean, the market hasn't, hasn't seen that product. You don't have a tech ETF giving you a dividend, by the way.
00:08:14.334 - 00:08:50.564, Speaker B: That's not going to happen. That's not going to happen. I'll tell you why. Because they have to use third party qualified custodians. So like a Jane street or some, itll end up being anchor or somebody else like that. But there will be a really long dearth before they get smart on staking or yielding on top of the asset. For those of us who are staking good, those of us who are yielding and outperforming staking, even better, because theres going to be less capital available to support that.
00:08:50.564 - 00:08:59.824, Speaker B: I think it's going to be an amazing opportunity to really outperform the static ETF's by having compelling yield.
00:09:00.604 - 00:09:10.304, Speaker C: Ryan, what if the qualified custodian offers staking, though? Like what if an anchorage or a bitgo? I mean, because you're not violating the qualified custodian rule, but you are staking.
00:09:10.884 - 00:09:29.824, Speaker B: But are you aware of any sec approved, qualified, uh, custodian or, um, uh, or other that, you know, that does offer staking on top of their. Their, uh, their custody?
00:09:31.044 - 00:09:35.788, Speaker C: Yeah. Not here. Only in Canada. I know three iq does it for their ETF. Yeah.
00:09:35.876 - 00:09:36.868, Speaker A: So that's it.
00:09:36.916 - 00:10:00.004, Speaker B: Right? Like, these guys are going to be getting inflated away. It's kind of new. New money. Effectively not being smart money yet coming into a space. That's the natural evolution. They will get smart. And then you're going to have to, as capital allocators, you're going to have to be doing something better than holding ETH, staking it, and taking 220 from your lp's.
00:10:00.004 - 00:10:30.474, Speaker B: That's why I think the value will accrue to those who are yielding in a compelling fashion. Outperforming staking, which I'm super excited. Couldn't be more excited about what the dual impact that this is going to have of a filtering and leaving an upper crust of high quality asset managers along with just booing asset prices in a way that we've never seen any event like this in space.
00:10:31.294 - 00:10:46.866, Speaker A: No. I want to clarify one thing and then ask you both questions. One is the conversion of a grayscale. So grayscale is actually not impacted from the lawsuit that is at the DCG level. And grayscale is kind of cornered off. Does it have a marginal impact? Soft. I mean, there's two process.
00:10:46.866 - 00:11:19.644, Speaker A: So technically, no, but personally, I would want a blue chip. In a best case scenario, I would perhaps want Blackrock to go first, because it's just gold standard. My question to you guys is, so you have $100, you have the option to buy the ETF coinbase stock or bitcoin and ETH, maybe Solana or something else, like liquid tokens. How do you allocate that?
00:11:19.724 - 00:11:38.784, Speaker C: So, if I'm playing the long game, which I'd probably be if I'm buying bitcoin or ETH, the long game that comes into play is control over my assets and long term taxes. So I would want to hold the BTC and ETH, I'd want to stake the ETH, and I'd want to custody it myself. That'd be my pick.
00:11:38.944 - 00:11:42.804, Speaker A: When you talk about taxes, why not Rothria? Put that ETF in there.
00:11:44.864 - 00:11:48.608, Speaker C: Yeah. That could solve their coinbase. I mean, I'm just saying, like, this.
00:11:48.616 - 00:11:55.240, Speaker A: Is what GBDC, ethan, right? How is it that, like, I'm not an accountant, but Ryan and I are not in the US, my man.
00:11:55.272 - 00:12:00.026, Speaker C: Like, and some here the question, this.
00:12:00.050 - 00:12:02.986, Speaker A: Is the family feud answer. It's like what outperforms?
00:12:03.130 - 00:12:53.060, Speaker B: Yeah. So something comes to mind that's a good reference for many people. In 2017, the economist did a global case study inviting thousands of students to participate in this case study of what would be the best portfolio mix and the global average. If you believe in the wisdom of the crowd, as I do, the global average, incidentally, came up to two thirds bitcoin. One 30th is the optimal crypto strategy for that time. Noting that this was mid 2017 and there werent fair and many other options. Id say the smart money is the inverse of that two thirds ETH, one third bitcoin, which is, which is what we use as our internal benchmark here at dialectic.
00:12:53.060 - 00:13:30.476, Speaker B: That's what we call the dialectic index. Two thirds ETH, one one three bitcoin. That's what we're trying to outperform. What I would do myself is I would buy ETH and I would yield with that ETH compounding ETH. And that's because ultimately it's the highest quality asset in the space that we see today. The developer mindshare the sinkhole of both capital in other L2s and new layer ones that connect natively with ETH. There's a sinkhole of capital, both mind share capital as well as financial capital there in ETH.
00:13:30.476 - 00:14:07.058, Speaker B: I think that ETH will outperform bitcoin for that reason. And then the other reason, all that ETH needs to do to triple or to double is like $10 billion. So a little bit of money flowing in and you get a doubling, and theres a lot of doublings that can occur over the course of flowing in. $100 billion. For bitcoin to double, it kind of needs 100 billion or at least 60 billion flow. Thats a lot of money to mobilize. And so I think bitcoins going to hit 100k, but that means that ETH is going to be at 16 to 20k.
00:14:07.058 - 00:14:16.702, Speaker B: So who cares? Youve outperformed bitcoin substantially by being all in ethanol. That's the way I play. There's other assets that I would hold. Long tail and diversification.
00:14:16.758 - 00:14:50.234, Speaker A: Yeah, because the same dynamic, you could argue around what is ETH to bitcoin. Solana may be to ETH, an l two might be to ETH. Solana might be to an l two, which we'll get into that discussion next. I guess I would. Similar to you, Ryan, I would largely be like 60% to 70% ETH and a combination of that through staking it. And, you know, not all of it staking. You know, I don't think I would have an ETF.
00:14:50.234 - 00:15:09.204, Speaker A: It doesn't make sense for me. I just think that's a positive catalyst. But I wouldn't do it. You would do it. The ETF, if you don't want to deal with custody, and if you may want to use it in a tax efficient manner or. Or get it, count as collateral in the trad five portfolio. So that might be the only consideration.
00:15:11.424 - 00:15:15.768, Speaker C: I followed the rules too closely. I thought the self custody option was 50 50 bitcoin ETH.
00:15:15.816 - 00:15:56.014, Speaker A: But no, I don't see much reason to hold bitcoin, candidly. Only if your time horizon is measured in less than a year. If you think that the ETF for bitcoin gets approved, and then the ETF for ETH probably takes another six months to a year. But if that, you could. I think we all hear an agreement that we will see an ETF of ETH come in short order, measured to your point, Ryan, in months after the bitcoin ETF. And so the capital inflow to ETH. And I'm going back to my conversations while I was a paraphy.
00:15:56.014 - 00:16:59.324, Speaker A: If $100 were to flow into the space for such a long time, it was like $99 to $100 would go into bitcoin at the institutional level, and then they would take months or years to study the space, and then they would allocate some in Ethereum and then Solano and venture towards the end of the cycle. Most of my conversations with a lot of hedge funds, tigers of the world, was like, don't even talk to me about bitcoin. I'm interested in Ethereum because I'm a venture, I'm a tech investor, and bitcoin is not that, but Ethereum is, and Solana is. And so I think my biggest, I think insight there, and I think it will be true, is when people are willing to take more risk, they may leapfrog that bitcoin to ETH step. They might just go directly to Ethan. And I think for that reason, I'm much more. I just don't see a reason to hold bitcoin other than playing timing game.
00:16:59.624 - 00:17:17.284, Speaker C: I just think the sell is so easy. If you're on Wall street, to Ryan's point, or your point earlier, Santin, you say, hey, look, you're getting something that has way more of a tech ecosystem. It's a yielding asset, and the sell isn't that hard. I think it's pretty easy at that point. First, bitcoin.
00:17:17.944 - 00:17:20.968, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a technology bet with some yield, like, it's huge.
00:17:21.016 - 00:18:04.224, Speaker B: Yeah. It has to be sold to like a thoughtful, curious individual who like, cares about something conceptual, like a smart contract. I have underestimated the value of bitcoins brand over the years. You know, I've been on record in 20 every year from 2017 on saying that you Ethereum would flip bitcoin. And I think next year it very well may. But I've been wrong the entire time and usually comes back to that global brand that it has that it's like the first thing people think of. The fact that it's a digital pet rock and doesn't offer anything more compelling than just custody.
00:18:04.224 - 00:18:09.796, Speaker B: Hasn't seemed to bother that many people. I've been surprised at its resilience. The honey badger.
00:18:09.900 - 00:18:40.092, Speaker A: I was just going to say younger generations, like Ryan, to your point, if you extend this to 510 years, the addressable market for Ethereum is way larger than bitcoin because it touches the Internet. The Internet's vastly larger than the market size for gold. I mean, you're like, you know, the funnel for getting someone interested in holding and investing in ETH is like everyone that's young and cares about gaming nfts. The Internet versus gold is just a little, will be more niche, I think.
00:18:40.228 - 00:19:10.444, Speaker C: What do you guys think happens post ETF? Let's walk down that path. Like, ETf's are everywhere. Market caps are way up. There's an aura of acceptance. What are the second order effects of that? Outside of price? Does Wall street and web, two companies now control more of the decision making? Yeah, I'm trying to think through the bad parts of a lot of the old world owning new world assets, if there are any.
00:19:10.824 - 00:19:35.394, Speaker B: I mean, I kind of just accept it as the natural evolution of things. The world is not just going to let a band of 800 of us who happen to be at some conferences in the early 2010s just become super lord overtures of the planet multi trillionaires. So, like, the more that it's spread across the traditional wealth, probably the better it is for us in the end.
00:19:36.614 - 00:19:53.142, Speaker C: How do you think decision making pans out there then? Like, for Ethereum? Like, who's making the decisions five years from now? Core protocol upgrades. Like, obviously there's the idea of, like, rough social consensus, but we all know that in reality it comes down to like, a core group of developers. Like, will fidelity have developers, will Blackrock?
00:19:53.198 - 00:21:09.776, Speaker B: Will a nation like, well, fidelity does, right? Fidelity is super smart. I mean, they've been in it for as long they're OG as it comes in the game and also making technical contributions. I think fidelity developers have made contributions to the bitcoin code base and certainly to a range of things in Geth and what have you. Yeah, this is the thing is, like, these guys have been around the whole time. A lot of these large capital players have quietly been here. And I think this is what we're seeing, this run, correct me if I'm wrong, but the run from 27k in bitcoin up to 35, and in ETH, ETH running from 15 and change up to 19, and Solana running from 20 to 30, that feels like that's all ETF driven. Which makes me wonder, is there also a Solana ETF on the horizon? Could that be the third one to go? And does that make sense, and is that the right step for the ecosystem? I don't know if you guys have opinions on that.
00:21:09.920 - 00:21:59.934, Speaker A: Well, Tom, I think your question around how decision making changes once you have traditional finance players. I actually let me put in a different context. Like, do you fundamentally believe that the people running these companies are evil or different than a lot of the people that are in crypto? And I don't think the answer is yes. And largely, I think people change depending on what system they're under. And, for instance, I grew up in Mexico, and we had a lot of canadian american teachers come down, and they quickly, outside the school, there were these cops that would stand, and they would always pull you over to give you a ticket, but they would never give you a ticket. You would just kind of. They would have expected them to give you, like, you would give them $20 and they would let you go.
00:21:59.934 - 00:22:43.048, Speaker A: And a lot of the american and canadian teachers initially resisted that. And then months in, they kind of understood how the system worked, and they quickly just gave them $20 because it was easier to give them $20 and go, as opposed to getting a ticket and losing so much time. It's not to say that. What I'm saying is people really change under the system and the regime that they're under. And I think if you believe that the rules of crypto are really sound and are better than the traditional system, and the incentives are much better, then that's it. You don't have to believe anything else. I think that's what makes crypto such a sound system.
00:22:43.048 - 00:23:34.324, Speaker A: Now, if the assumptions are faulty or if there's a governance surface area vector that might be exploited, well, that's going to be exploited anyways, whether it's from traditional finance guys or not. You have an SPF guy come in and run circles around a lot of crypto natives. I think it's hugely positive. If anything, they might bring some excellence in areas where crypto has been kind of not so strong on. And this idea of trying to, like, reinvent the wheel on everything, whereas, you know, maybe dao and corporate governance actually becomes a much more sound thing because you have actually professional players. Maybe you need Apollo and KKR credit teams as opposed to maple finance guys underwriting for tokenization work.
00:23:35.144 - 00:24:16.620, Speaker C: Yeah, I don't disagree with you, Santi, but the one thing I would disagree with you on is, like, in the scenario where you have a bunch of Wall street bankers, analysts, et cetera, trying to make proxy decisions in their own world and apply that to crypto. A lot of the meta or subconscious things that you and I and Ryan and others are okay with, they will not agree with. Like, let's go through a couple examples, like, what's the worst thing about adding KYc? Let's just add it to everything. We're used to, that we work at a bank. Like, why? What's wrong with private order flow? Let's just add that in. Who cares? I don't necessarily think that they'll have the same decision making that we would.
00:24:16.652 - 00:24:35.516, Speaker A: Have, but you and I, can we acknowledge that there are people in crypto today that are not in alignment with this circle. The thing that makes crypto so unique is that you sort of assume that everyone's going to act in their self best interests, but somehow the system works.
00:24:35.620 - 00:24:37.684, Speaker B: Yeah. And the market decides.
00:24:37.804 - 00:25:21.304, Speaker A: And the market decides. And so, oh, by the way, if they really want to change the rules of a particular defi protocol, well, what's going to happen in an open source world? You fork that. And that's the beauty of these systems, that they're self ordering. And if there is some form of coercion or forced hand or wrong or bad actor, then very quickly, liquidity migrates at the speed of light, and so do users, and so does code. And that is incredibly powerful because it keeps the system in check. And I think if you believe that, then it doesn't worry me who comes into the space. I sort of already assumed that there's a mixed bag of people in crypto, and.
00:25:21.304 - 00:25:25.444, Speaker A: But the system works, and that's like a feature, not a bug.
00:25:26.144 - 00:25:26.936, Speaker B: 100%.
00:25:27.040 - 00:25:49.464, Speaker C: Yeah. I am excited for the business side of Wall street to come into crypto. Like the CEO's, the sales guys, the operations teams, like the buttoned up processes, like the polishing. That is the stuff I am excited about and hopefully some activists to target the massive unused daos that Ryan's always talking about.
00:25:49.544 - 00:25:58.364, Speaker A: I can't wait for Bill Ackman, Bill Ackman or Soros to go knocking on the gnosis or block one door taser was.
00:25:59.224 - 00:26:06.440, Speaker B: That would be, that would be fantastic. Oh, if some, if someone reopens or not. Sorry.
00:26:06.552 - 00:26:09.768, Speaker C: Like, let's say Bill Ackman wanted to go after a giant treasury.
00:26:09.816 - 00:26:49.754, Speaker B: Like, is there or any, any other. These, like mass though, like, what's, what's the route? Like, it's just like, so what you do is you would buy up, you'd buy up some of the tokens and then you'd start a campaign. Dean and I at one time thought about doing this, and we did it somewhat successfully with the Digicstaff. We just sat down with Sean. We were like, look, you got all this money in the treasury. You're the biggest token holder. Why not vote to dissolve the dow and pay out the token holders? And they're like, you know what? Yeah.
00:26:49.754 - 00:27:30.234, Speaker B: And they did it and they made a lot of money and they deserved it because they were buying tokens. And we were fortunate to have some tokens at that time as well. And that was an accredited trait. I wish more, we talked to a couple other daos and I wish more would have done it, but too many of them. We saw right away that most of them just looked at this as a giant trust fund for the core group forever. And the problem is that you don't have actual legal rights of a shareholder because if you did, Ackman would already be here mopping up folks here in Zoog, left, right and center.
00:27:34.414 - 00:27:58.492, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, talk about things that are overlooked. But look, there are some protocols right now where the value of their treasury higher than the market cap of the token con or, or like really close. And there have been instances where the core team has looked at that, and then they buy a bunch of the tokens and then just like, dissolve it. And it's, a lot of people don't pay attention to that.
00:27:58.548 - 00:28:18.052, Speaker B: And that's, that's totally, like, that's a totally legitimate. I actually think that that's much more ethical than just sitting on it, paying each other 500k salaries till hell freezes over. Right, right. You know that other people in the market can participate in these calls and make a judgment of, like, okay, is.
00:28:18.068 - 00:28:20.140, Speaker A: This thing moving towards dissolution?
00:28:20.292 - 00:28:47.188, Speaker B: Should I start to take a position? I think that that would be a really, like, great cleaning in, in our market. There's way too much money locked up in foundations, sitting in t bills, and not enough returned back to investors who took risks to build ambitious projects that didn't work out. And that's fine, but return the capital that's there, and you need a big.
00:28:47.276 - 00:29:13.734, Speaker C: Social group for that. You need a group on Twitter causing real social pressure on these founders publicly to do that. We have a couple activist funds around the space. If there was a coordinated social effort to pressure the treasuries into doing so and getting all of their various stakeholders involved in whatever role that they have within that project, I think that would work. But.
00:29:15.554 - 00:29:18.330, Speaker B: The link marines link marine raiders.
00:29:18.362 - 00:29:19.634, Speaker A: Or something like that.
00:29:19.794 - 00:29:21.974, Speaker B: Link marine treasury Raiders.
00:29:24.474 - 00:29:29.394, Speaker A: That's a heck of a name for a fun, by the way. Might go by that domain.
00:29:32.814 - 00:30:24.104, Speaker B: Let's switch gears and chat. Solana versus the evolution of other l two s and l one s. I guess to contextualize, I'm looking at the scope of tokens out there, the blue chips and ETH and bitcoin aside, and trying to think through where value will accrue in this next cycle. And certainly there's a lot of really solid work being done in the Solana ecosystem, and there's some interesting technical advantages that Solana has, but also some interesting disadvantages that they seem not to really get over. Liveness continues to be a problem in year what now? Close to four, and they're.
00:30:26.244 - 00:30:26.628, Speaker A: One of.
00:30:26.636 - 00:31:31.404, Speaker B: The highest quality of what I would call generation two smart contract scripting platforms. You had gen one with ethereum, gen two, which is this, ETH killers, Polkadot, Solana, dfinity, Cardano, avalanche, so on and so forth. Then you have a gen three that's coming out, celestia fuel, wormhole, a range of others that blur the lines to l two s and this generation of l two s with optimism, polygon, arbitrum, so on and so forth. There sort of isn't a clear line where l two and these gen three l one s cut off. Like, is Celestia an l two? Is it an l one? You kind of don't really know. It works natively out of the box with Ethereum. And is value going to accrue to these alt l one s that are trying to be the capital sinkhole? Or is more value going to be captured by these protocols that are ultimately accruing value to ethereum? How are you guys thinking through that?
00:31:31.904 - 00:32:15.758, Speaker C: Yeah, maybe I'll jump in first. I think it's a great question, Ryan. I think the way I think about it is three broad buckets, and I think Kyle from Multicoin had a really good post on this on the end goal of the l one or l two should be serving the developers, because then they bring the customers, they bring the scale. So my mental model has always been Ethereum has the most mind share. It's where everything's happening. And if we go to the extreme on the left, we have something like cosmos where you can build your own app, you can make consensus level edits, and that has proven successful. Right? You have Akash there, you have dy DX chain moving there for their perps, you have Thor chain, like massive projects that are big and doing well.
00:32:15.758 - 00:33:26.996, Speaker C: And then if you go to the right of Ethereum, you get a much more centralized experience where eventually Solana's nodes will be the size of data centers, which is fine, that's the path they're going down. And you get something that's the best single stored global state. You don't have to worry about making all these edits, you don't have to worry about rolling your own chain, you don't have to worry about composing, you don't have to worry about anything like that. So the thing that I'm weighing is, will developers eventually just get burnt out with the l two scaling plan on Ethereum? Right? Will they get tired of weighing ten ZK projects and five roll ups and rolling down to Celestia or eigen layer disclosure? We're investors, we love them both. And will they eventually go over to a Solana where they don't have to worry about a lot of stuff, they just worry about their app, right? Or will they need that cosmos level functionality and changes on Ethereum while tapping into Ethereum's liquidity. Right? So you could have the cosmos vision on ETH. So, yeah, I'm sort of stuck, right? You told me early on in my career not to be too binary, and here we are.
00:33:26.996 - 00:33:41.174, Speaker C: But I'm kind of stuck between the cosmos vision playing out on ETH, while understanding that it's a technical hurdle for developers to deal with and the idea of just deploying on something like Solana. But. Sorry for the rant.
00:33:41.334 - 00:33:42.434, Speaker B: No, that's great.
00:33:43.894 - 00:34:25.034, Speaker A: You know, I don't know. I tend to think more of, like, on a consensus basis. I think Solana has been. What is most interesting to me is that the ethos of the team and the community is quite unique. I think what made Ethereum great and what was most interesting for me at a time when it was only bitcoin, was this idea that there's more like, intellectual curiosity within the Ethereum community. And this idea that we don't know everything, we will have to build it as we go. And I think that's what kept Ethereum, what it, it has led it to be what it is today.
00:34:25.034 - 00:35:08.106, Speaker A: I think there are some factions within the ethereum community that have really become more rigid in their thinking and look, rightfully so. It's matured. It pulled off a dramatic transition, proof of stake, which archaeologically might be one of the most important social phenomenons of the human race. Like, just this idea of coordination at scale, I think will go down in history books as something like, incredible. Now, what I really find interesting from Solana is that, but it's very much differentiated from all the other competing l one s. It's sort of like lateral. It says, hey, we're willing to take a lot of the critique and be open.
00:35:08.106 - 00:35:51.362, Speaker A: Like you look at Anatoly. And I think he strikes me as, I've interviewed him multiple times. I've had the good fortune of seeing him in the fire, being criticized so much and accepting it and saying he got criticism on the gas fee model. And then he took that and he optimized it and actually did an improvement to the Solana ecosystem. And the way they price gas is vastly superior than how Ethereum does it. And I think that level of thinking is, what I'm trying to say is that is shown up and will continue if I replace a bet on Solana is on that. And a similar matter that I placed that bet on Ethereum early on, and I've been very impressed also.
00:35:51.362 - 00:36:12.786, Speaker A: Just like a phoenix rising from the ashes, this post SBF FTX kind of SPF FTX kind of association really hurt them. I think a lot of people turned their back on them. And my thesis back then was, if they come out of this, they're going to come out of it way stronger. And I think that's what you're seeing right now play out. Is it perfect? No, ethereum is not perfect. Bitcoin is not perfect. Nothing is perfect.
00:36:12.786 - 00:36:50.898, Speaker A: But I think the, the, like, the Solana phone is something that I, you know, we could, you could argue that it's an interesting experiment, but look, I think they are doing that. I think, is it a good thing? Is it gonna work out? I think they're, like, being actually you. They'll, they'll be the first ones to tell you that they're being super conservative in the, in what they're expecting out of this pilot. But it's like Google Brain, you know, it's like this is like their skunks work kind of operation. And I actually find it like really.
00:36:50.946 - 00:38:50.264, Speaker B: Interesting that that is interesting, because if they, you know, if they're still spending capital on something like the phone, then I'm actually, that actually increases my skepticism that the, the sort of double edged sword with Solana, to your point, I think you hit the nail on the head, was that they've been such a great open community and they've done so much bridge building. The idea to just go out and sell early stage safs to basically every vc in the market, kind of like an angel check and just get so many people in the community I felt was really brilliant. Theyve done these types of moves to bring people in over time. But post the trust breaking moment of FTX, which broke trust across that ecosystem, there would need to be a galvanization, and youre closer to it than I am, that there appears to be going through of focus on the advantages that they have and just being a great developer experience and so on and so forth. If they're still doing things like a phone and stores in New York malls and things like that, then I would say that that demonstrates lack of focus from a core team that would be concerning at this juncture. They should be laser focused at this point. And my big question here is the mistakes that were made that burned billions and billions of dollars of capital, one of which is the token distribution model early on, where a lot of it is distributed to a few vc's, the other being obviously the relationship with SBF and a few other things along the way.
00:38:50.264 - 00:40:22.654, Speaker B: Can they recoup that faster than another brand new chain that has superior technology in this generation, like now gets traction? Does Gen three chains, whichever one you're excited about, Eigen layer Celestia fuel any of them? Do they get traction faster than Solana recoups traction? My bet is that the gen three eats the lunch of gen two broadly, that the whole class of ETH killers have a strong uphill battle, mostly because they don't have the dry powder, because they've distributed too much, their token, too early. And that's going to be a lesson over long term, that your distribution curves need to be very gradual and very long sweeping. And this whole giving 20% out of the network in the first 24 months is a terrible idea, even though it looks good to some people. And thats the side Im taking, is that this next generation actually learns the lessons of the previous generation and its cleaner slate that people can then build on. And thats interesting. And that is easy, easier platform for building than trying to recoup what's lost. And the lack of focus shows that Gen two is not on target, if that's still where they are.
00:40:22.654 - 00:40:26.014, Speaker B: Spending scarce resources at this.
00:40:26.794 - 00:40:45.424, Speaker C: Yeah, I think the focus thing is important. I don't think the phone or the stores are that much of a focus anymore. I was at. Well, I was in Wynwood in Miami, and I saw the Solana store that they used to have, and I don't think it's open anymore. I don't know. I think so. I don't know.
00:40:45.424 - 00:41:30.724, Speaker C: I don't have complete views here either. Or maybe not as complete as you, Ryan. But I think Solana is getting a lot of traction, and I think that they are successfully reversing the trust that was lost in FTX. I mean, these guys are. I mean, the developer interest around breakpoint right now is ridiculous. I mean, the number of people going to that, the number of projects presenting, I mean, couple that with some serious technical improvements, whether you're talking about, like, firedancer or tiny dancer or Jitto disclosure portfolio company, we're talking about, like, the isolated fee markets that Santi is talking about. That's all happening without the gen threes ever being launched yet.
00:41:30.724 - 00:42:03.344, Speaker C: You can't use Eigen Da to launch roll up yet. I love Eigen layer. I'm just saying it's not a possibility yet. A lot of the ZK projects, whether evms or whether ZK vms, you can't really use them. You can't do any sort of composability whatsoever. I'm very bullish on what's being built on ETH two, but I'm not being mutually exclusive with the Solana story, given I think their developer progress has been pretty strong. But again, I'm not our Solana expert.
00:42:03.504 - 00:42:14.400, Speaker B: Well, I mean, you follow closer than I do. And so that's interesting that your feedback from both of you is there is really a lot of, like, organic strength.
00:42:14.592 - 00:42:22.932, Speaker C: I think that. Yeah, there's a lot of organic strength. I mean, the Anatoly is the most likable founder in crypto, which is a huge advantage.
00:42:23.068 - 00:43:15.126, Speaker A: That is, the guy gets punched by all sides and everyone in the ethereum community, and he is one where he says, hey, you're right on some things, like he's super humble and he understands it's not a perfect design. I think technically they might be one of the strongest. I mean, his background coming from, I think he was at Cisco and doing distributed systems there and hardware guys. So I think they just think very different than most other l one founders that are just forking Ethereum and just maybe doing some marginal improvements and dressing it up and actually being way more aggressive on their token distribution to attract, from business development standpoint, a lot of projects. And it's actually very artificial and customer acquisition costs are really high. And I think Solana is organic, way more organic. Right.
00:43:15.126 - 00:43:51.654, Speaker A: The counter argument we just said, which is, look, call it what it is, I don't think any, any project has had like a, you could always poke holes at the distribution. Now, we all know there are limitations as to how you can raise capital and get bootstrapped in crypto. Unless you're friend tech, you at some point will go down the VC route. And, and that implies that VC's get some allocation and people might look to that and say, hey, that's really high. It has lockups, it has all the things. And look, Solana had to go through that. I mean, it is the nature of the regulatory environment.
00:43:51.654 - 00:44:15.972, Speaker A: The coins are fairly distributed. The Nat Komodo consensus is higher. It's actually pretty high. And so when you look at it from a decentralization standpoint, it's come a long way. And I think people don't appreciate that. If it has all this said differently, like, yeah, look, the distribution wasn't perfect. People criticize it.
00:44:15.972 - 00:44:52.352, Speaker A: It's a VC coin, actually. I actually think that those arguments are, while they're factually correct, they also dismissed the fact that, so did ethereum at one point, so did bitcoin at one point. It was fairly concentrated. Like guys, like, this is just the nature of the game. But I do think that if you look at the interest now, given everything that's going on, it's actually organic, it's not acquired, it's not, hey, let me give you a $20 million token grant. Come and deploy in our competing l one of choice, or l two. That to me is a very good barometer of.
00:44:52.352 - 00:45:41.214, Speaker A: There is a lot of developers that might say, hey, I met two kinds of developers. One that first built an ethereum that went to Solana, or built in another chain and then went to Solana and said, hey, there's actually certain things that are possible here that are just not in other environments because it's just really low fee. And the benefits of that, you could argue l two is on the margin. Sure. And then the other ones that are just, it's their first time building and the tooling has gotten much better, and the developer resources has come a long way. It's actually very easy to get on board in Solana and start building, which is something that the Solana foundation has really put a lot of emphasis on, which I think is very important.
00:45:42.874 - 00:46:22.246, Speaker C: One good example here, the thing that I'm struggling with is there are so many different ways to build on Ethereum. Is it too confusing? And are developers eventually just going to say, fuck it, I want to build on salon, it's easier? I think that's basically kind of my thesis in a nutshell, a little bit for Solana. But one good example of this, like, Ryan and Santi that's helpful is helium. Right? Helium had their own chain from the ground up. Like, it was very confusing. It was very distracting from their core mission of building out IoT and stuff like that. And one day they just said, hey, let's pivot to Solana.
00:46:22.246 - 00:46:43.506, Speaker C: And I. I think they were probably one of the biggest NFT mints ever, right? Like, every IoT device, every 5g device now has their own NFT for it. And I think things went pretty smoothly. I mean, granted, they probably both sides put a ton of resources into it, but kind of demonstrates, like, an app chain going to Solana. Freeze.
00:46:43.690 - 00:48:34.274, Speaker B: That was certainly the best merger that we've seen in the space. Obviously probably the highest profile one, but also the best executed one. And that would be an interesting thing if Solana used its business development activities to focus on doing mergers and sort of made some capital deployments to bring over really compelling ecosystems to kind of be part of the Solana chain, instead of running their own l one or l two, or their own resource layer of some kind. That would be a moment where I would certainly get very excited. I feel like another thing that could get an outsider in after the clarity that the Alameda allocation has washed through the market. You guys have demonstrated the number of times we talked about last time, and you've sent some data on this that actually the market's holding up really well against the Alameda buying, which supports your argument that actually Solana, the community of Solana, is showing up every day right now and buying from the FTX sellers, which, you know, gotta tip my hat to. That's, that's there a thing that I suppose I'm missing in this moment is a genuinely unique application or experience or primitive that that is enabled by Solana.
00:48:34.274 - 00:49:23.934, Speaker B: So, like, a lot of it feels like, oh, we're the, you know, we're the x of Ethereum. But on Solana, and it's like, okay, what is new? Is there an amazing experience game that has gotten traction or gotten users? Is there an awesome DeFi experience or defi pool that is producing some compelling new Defi primitive? I'm not sure if I've seen that. Until we get that, it's still going to be in the ETH killer category and not emerge as one of its own as a legitimate, like, top three blue chip. Are you guys seeing that, though? Like, what? What, for you, is the thing that is like the killer app on Solana that's going to bring, you know, the next million people to the table.
00:49:24.634 - 00:50:05.946, Speaker A: So I actually was recently talking to a founder here in Solana, and there's this project called Drip House, and what they do is free nfTs. And basically you subscribe as all these artists or projects that will grip you every day. Part of the collection. It's kind of like a random lottery. It's kind of fun, like opening up, I guess, those pagani cards. And the founder very succinctly said, look, it was just not possible to do it. Even in an l two environment, it would have cost us an order of magnitude or two, just gas fees alone.
00:50:05.946 - 00:50:57.394, Speaker A: And that just kills a project in and of itself. Whereas in Solana, it's just radically cheaper to do this type of project. And so just then and there and drip is done. I think volume wise, it's like, it's gotten a ton of traction. I don't want to spit out numbers here out of my ass, but I think something like that is an example of a team saying, being acutely aware that, hey, it's actually pretty cool, we want to do this, we can't do it in l two, we can't do it on. Certainly now, one ethereum we need to do in Solana, and can that change? Sure, over time, maybe gas optimizations, whatnot. But I think really, the consumer and gaming aspect is fairly well suited for Solana.
00:50:57.394 - 00:51:27.700, Speaker A: I think you've seen some interesting NFT projects, like, appreciate that micropayments is an area that I'm really excited about. Just payments in general, I think is one area that is just prime for explosion. Just a stable coins, and it will happen. Merchant adoption, whatnot. And I think Circle has certainly lent its credibility and put its weight behind deploying in Solana and being active. There's. It has done so in other ecosystems as well.
00:51:27.700 - 00:52:11.344, Speaker A: So, hey, look. But still, I think it's early in every ecosystem, but these use cases are emerging. And I think when you think about things that have been prohibitively expensive in an l one and even in an l two environment, because I think in your mind when you were used to seeing paying thousands and thousands like per transaction on an l one, at the peak of defi summer you were yield farming. And so, and then you say, oh, the anchoring is so high that when you go to an l two it seems like it's, it's a huge improvement. And it is. But for someone new coming in, an l two is still expensive.
00:52:11.504 - 00:52:13.760, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure and for all.
00:52:13.832 - 00:52:37.024, Speaker A: And it like margins off a whole segment of use cases and users that will not pay even a dollar. For us it's like, wow, I'm used to paying 20 3100 thousand. I've seen all kinds of gas fees, but in Solana it's just radically cheaper. And that matters for a lot of projects and users.
00:52:37.524 - 00:52:49.724, Speaker C: The good thing is I think by next episode or next recording, breakpoint will have happened already. So I think we can all see what projects come out of there, what's interesting and what isn't, and we can talk about it too.
00:52:50.064 - 00:53:00.104, Speaker B: Let's switch gears to another project that, Tommy, you've been following really closely. Why don't you walk us through kind of the latest and greatest with Ton and Telegram?
00:53:00.184 - 00:53:43.516, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. Maybe a bit of a teaser as we end the episode for next week's convo, but been diving into the tan blockchain, which is, I guess legally separate from Telegram, the service we all use and love. At token 2049, a big conference, the tan blockchain announced an exclusive partnership with Telegram. Kind of got me interested in looking at tan again. And a couple of the interesting things is that Telegram, the app plans to exclusively use the tan blockchain. But more interestingly, I think it's November 1. Everybody in Telegram will have a wallet by default in the app, excluding the US.
00:53:43.516 - 00:55:06.416, Speaker C: So it's an opt out wallet, which means it's in the app for everyone ready to go. If you do oallet in your search bar and you're not in the US, you could actually use it right now. They'll have staking through tonstakrs and Bebo and others. And even better, they'll have a full App Store in Telegram that you can use crypto apps with linked to the native wallet. So the idea that Telegram could sort of win web3 if the wallet and App Store works out to 800 million users around the world, minus the US portion, which I don't know what that portion is, I think shouldn't be understated, right? Because every l one we all look at outside of Coinbase's base and maybe Telegram here doesn't have the distribution that Telegram has, so it's a huge differentiating factor. On the flip side, information around the tan blockchain is extremely slim. Data analytics, how the blockchains run the token distribution is kind of hard for me to pin down right now because they had a unique release after the SEC settlement and it's a little janky because I think you can only really use a couple assets on ton like Tron USDT and stuff like that.
00:55:06.416 - 00:55:15.552, Speaker C: So it's a little early on. But look, the distribution is interesting, so diving back into it and seeing what's around, but interested if you guys have heard anything or if we should leave.
00:55:15.568 - 00:56:03.544, Speaker B: It, the big question that I asked myself and asked you this is at 10 billion. Have I missed it? And given the nebulous nature, in a world that is supposed to be transparent and forthright, especially in incipient moments, the nebulous nature of the token distribution, and even, let's be serious, we can assume that it's proof of authority chain. It clearly is proof of authority chain. Does that turn a threshold of people off such that how much upside does it have from here at 10 billion fully diluted?
00:56:04.404 - 00:56:40.060, Speaker C: Yeah, I asked a very smart person their view, and they had the same view you have on the nebulous nature of it. I think it's a really, really good question. Honestly, not sure yet. I need to dig in and figure out how the blockchain works, but I think Coinmarketcap and Coingecko have the wrong FDV for Telegram. For what it's worth, I think the total supply is overstated, but I need to confirm that. And there's a lot of tokens that are locked up. So the Tan believers fund has $3 billion worth of tan that's locked up for God.
00:56:40.060 - 00:56:45.544, Speaker C: I think it's a couple of years. I think it's two years and then something like that, or maybe more.
00:56:46.644 - 00:57:57.754, Speaker A: I think I go back to the one two episodes ago we were talking about, fully diluted and circulating, and we ought to look at the distribution curve and the anchor holders. Same as this also reminds me of world coin super high FTV, where I agree, Ryan, for me it's how much upside because I need to get, at least as an early stage investor, the opportunity cost, especially in this market where I can get stuff at 10 million, fully diluted, even liquid stuff. Like it's like, am I willing to go over to a $10 billion project? How much upside does it have? But I also, I'm thinking acutely of what you just said which is in a world where Ethereum doubles triples from here. It doesn't five x. What are other assets do? And not just purely speculation, but also I am looking for who has the best distribution time and time again. I think you will win as more consumer applications get built. I think whoever has not just the best tech, I think the tech here is overstated in an open source context.
00:57:57.754 - 00:58:30.736, Speaker A: I think you can fork a lot of it and the modes are less so they're there, but you can fork stuff. If the team is technically competent, I think it will be able to fork whatever works. And so I'm looking more for who has the best distribution. And that's why I bring up world coin and not so much world coin. I think it's a huge effort, but telegram has massive distribution to blink like Coinbase, but even better. And I think it can do a lot of really interesting things.
00:58:30.880 - 00:59:44.070, Speaker B: We have to get like for the next big win, we have to get a new cohort of people into the space and this feels like as good a avenue as any. I'm hopeful that the ETF's will be an avenue towards another million people, primarily being family offices and wealth management clients onboarding into the space. But Ton has massive global or telegram has massive global distribution and if it's this, I'll take it. I'll take anything that onboards millions of people. Great. Before I'm going to get serious about it as an asset, I want clarity on things like inflation, distribution of ownership and gini coefficient, the consensus mechanism, roadmap these types of things. And maybe they're holding back from being double or triple this FTV if they could.
00:59:44.070 - 00:59:59.218, Speaker B: Whatever it is, whether it's six or ten, obviously there's debate there. I would think that they would improve their prospects by being honest about that in this moment and that would be the best thing to to onboard do the developers.
00:59:59.346 - 01:00:10.306, Speaker C: Well, let's end it there. Next episode we could chat what we saw from Breakpoint Solana wise. We could chat findings on Telegram and any other major topics we have for next next recording.
