00:01:38.106 - 00:01:45.170, Speaker B: Am I my. No, I met my in laws today. There's a chance they can hear us recording, so we will say only, fantastic.
00:01:45.242 - 00:01:49.506, Speaker A: Obviously they know you're in crypto, right? It's not gonna be a weird thanksgiving where, like, people, I was here, I.
00:01:49.530 - 00:02:08.898, Speaker B: Spent COVID here, which was, I will tell you, 2020 for blockworks were some dark days. Our revenue fell. We're an events business, right? So our revenue fell 80% literally overnight when the New York shut down. Conferences and then the world shut down, and they saw. They saw all that go down. So, yeah, they've. They know.
00:02:08.898 - 00:02:09.618, Speaker B: They know I'm in good.
00:02:09.666 - 00:02:15.026, Speaker A: Oh, very good. It's good to know that at least there's no surprises.
00:02:15.170 - 00:02:16.654, Speaker B: You seem like you're in a good mood.
00:02:17.594 - 00:02:36.976, Speaker A: I mean, like, who. What's. What's not the like? I mean, it would be disingenuous for me to say that, like, you know, bull markets are always way more fun. I don't understand. These people would say, like, we, we, but let's go back to a bear market. I'm like, no, you clearly don't understand how bear markets feel and they make you question your existence. And, you know, it's, it's good.
00:02:36.976 - 00:03:00.974, Speaker A: You know, there's some really positive developments that we're going to talk about here beyond price. You know, the. The binance action, some developments with Coinbase, some new project launching. You know, again, you know, we've been doing this consistently every week, at least once a week, and it's always a bit more fun when you're not questioning.
00:03:01.014 - 00:03:03.070, Speaker B: That everything is better when number go up.
00:03:03.222 - 00:03:04.070, Speaker A: Absolutely.
00:03:04.222 - 00:03:24.090, Speaker B: Here's what I want to talk about. The two big things are blast and Binance. Blast is then l two. That Pac man, the founder of Blur, launched, and that. I'm not even really sure if it's a spin out or a separate company, but we can talk about that. Separate company, separate company and then Binance. One of the biggest, actually, news announcement, I would say, of the year in crypto.
00:03:24.090 - 00:03:48.970, Speaker B: It doesn't feel like maybe that big of a deal because I think a lot of people who are native to crypto native, saw this coming potentially or knew something was happening here over the last couple of months. But nonetheless, still huge news for the industry. It has a lot of second order implications. Binance and blast are the two big things. There's some other stuff like crack it. Sec sued Kraken again. Pith launched their token.
00:03:48.970 - 00:04:03.934, Speaker B: I think Pith is a really interesting project. We're actually going to have the founder of Pith on the show, Coindesk, got acquired. So that was also an interesting thing. But I think those three things pale in comparison to both Binance and blast. So you want to start with Binance?
00:04:04.714 - 00:04:06.410, Speaker A: Sure. Yeah, take it away.
00:04:06.562 - 00:04:23.440, Speaker B: Yeah, let's start there. So this week, Binance. Agree. Two big things with Binance. One is that Binance agreed to plead guilty in a criminal charge related to knowingly violating the Bank Secrecy act. They're paying more than $4.3 billion as part of the settlement agreement.
00:04:23.440 - 00:04:47.456, Speaker B: This is the largest penalty in US treasury history. If you break that down. I tried to find, like how that $4.3 billion breaks down. The only thing I could find was 3.4 billion of it is a civil monetary penalty to FinCEN, which is the financial crimes bureau within the treasury. And that agreement comes with a five year monitorship, which I think actually is important.
00:04:47.456 - 00:05:22.108, Speaker B: Five year monitorship and various agreements to kind of like bone up their compliance and ensure that the company completely exits the US. The reason I say that part's important is I think what that five year monitoring means is that they actually are going to get for five years, like logs to everything that binance does and all that kind of stuff, which that's. I do wonder if this will have some second order implications for companies who have done business with finance in the past. And then the other part of the fine is they're paying us $968 million fine to OFAC, the Office of Foreign Assets Control. So that's the one big bucket, is this fine.
00:05:22.236 - 00:05:41.412, Speaker A: It entails no involvement in binance operations for. This is for CC. CC needs to step down. He has already. He is paying a $50 million personal fine. And then there's a sentencing date in March, I think February or March. But he effectively pleaded guilty as part of that.
00:05:41.412 - 00:06:10.124, Speaker A: He's stepping down and paying 50 million. He can't be involved in finance for three years. The question now remains, is he going to serve some, like, jail time? Where is it going to be, like, Arthur, right, where it's just like. Like house arrest for like 18 months or so, right. I would think it's more like Arthur's type of sentencing because again, they also face like these very similar kind of issues. Right. Like anti money laundering and OFAC and whatnot.
00:06:10.124 - 00:06:12.564, Speaker A: Binance.
00:06:13.704 - 00:06:17.472, Speaker B: You're talking about the 1.8, the 1.8 and the 2.5 numbers.
00:06:17.568 - 00:06:37.774, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Binance was fined 1.8. That was a discount for partial cooperation, and that is paid over 15 months. And then the other component of the 4.3 is a 2.5 billion for sanctions. I think they just facilitated money flowing into certain sanctions.
00:06:38.234 - 00:06:39.722, Speaker B: Iran, I think, was the.
00:06:39.858 - 00:06:48.354, Speaker A: Iran was the biggest one, which, by the way, Arthur, what was it also faced similar issue with Iran, right?
00:06:48.474 - 00:07:03.874, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think there's a couple of angles that are interesting here. 4.3 billion that they owe. That's the biggest penalty in US treasury history. CZ steps down. And then also CZ got hit with $50 million in personal fines credited to the CFTC.
00:07:03.874 - 00:07:38.324, Speaker B: Couple of interesting maybe ways that we could go with this, which is one conversation about the markets, is this good or bad for crypto? So that's maybe where we could start. Other things are just like second order implications also. What, like maybe what this does for Coinbase and other exchanges, but maybe we can start with the markets. What do you think when you saw this happen? What do you think in terms of bullish, bearish neutral was priced in. How do you think about this in relationship to this cycle that's kicking off? And is this good or bad for the industry?
00:07:38.664 - 00:07:53.734, Speaker A: My first reaction was immensely bullish. You just climb a huge wall of worry. There were people that were speculating binance. Like, it was just unclear. Right. The impact that it would have. I mean, binance is the most important company in crypto.
00:07:53.734 - 00:08:03.746, Speaker A: It has been like, it served a huge impact for retail adoption, for projects listing, like the liquidity. Like, it was just.
00:08:03.930 - 00:08:05.698, Speaker B: They started the market.
00:08:05.746 - 00:08:05.906, Speaker A: They.
00:08:05.930 - 00:08:19.734, Speaker B: I mean, the fall 2019 market, which was a bull. There was that mini bull market inside the bear. That was a bull market, specifically on the back of the binance ieo program. They literally have the ability to move a whole market there.
00:08:20.154 - 00:08:42.570, Speaker A: Yeah. Like, I went to the binance conference, one of their first in Singapore, met CC. He's super approachable. Like, this is pre IO. My big thesis then was like, longing exchange coins was a great bet in a market that is volatile but choppy, because exchanges profit in that type of environment. But anyways, the news, I think, is immensely positive for a couple of reasons. Of course.
00:08:42.570 - 00:09:16.244, Speaker A: There's this wall of worry that we constantly have in crypto, and now there's a lot of clarity. 4.3 billion is not, you know, it is a large sum of money. I think it's the 7th largest fine ever paid to the US government. I think it's the largest to the DOJ, I believe. So that, like, in context, like, there's, like, the other people, like, in this category, in this league table are like, citigroup and HSBC, like, major banks, effectively. And then there's binance as number seven, which is super impressive like this.
00:09:16.244 - 00:09:44.394, Speaker A: I mean, there's speculation about profitable binance has been, but, like, in the order of, like hundreds of billions or so, like, like 100 billion or so. And so. Anyways, there was a couple of. Immediately the market reacted negatively. Now today, 24 hours later, the market is actually, you know, in the green and pumping pretty hard. There was some outflow of binance. I think it was like one north of a billion of outflows, 1.4
00:09:44.394 - 00:10:31.564, Speaker A: billion. As a couple hours into the announcement, naturally, some people were worried or whatnot. And so I think it's very positive for the space that it also is positive because immediately after there was Brian Armstrong went on Bloomberg and also had a good tweet of like, hey, we've served. Like, like, we've. We've taken the long road approach here. Like, it has been very difficult at times because we were in the US, we tried, like, we've complied. We haven't taken the, you know, fast route, like, as the DOJ kind of press release, um, said, you know, we haven't gone through this approach of, you know, move fast, like ask for forgiveness instead of permission, which was the kind of the binance approach as they framed it.
00:10:31.564 - 00:10:41.172, Speaker A: And Coinbase was like, we've always asked for permission first. And full disclosure, I'm very long Coinbase stock.
00:10:41.308 - 00:10:44.300, Speaker B: Did you buy more Coinbase after you saw what happened to binance?
00:10:44.412 - 00:11:25.384, Speaker A: Yeah, yesterday and today, I've just been very, like, I woke up today to an announcement of Coinbase that they were launching loans for institutional clients. And I tweeted about it today. I just think that Coinbase sees this incredible opportunity to be really the dominant player, not just in the US, but in crypto, full stop, and take a lot of the market share from fallen angels, from Genesis, no longer around. So now they've stepped in and I think they're going to fill that gap of facilitating a lot of loans and market making along with galaxy. But I think Coinbase in particular is.
00:11:25.464 - 00:11:27.552, Speaker B: Yeah, they're launching international perps, too.
00:11:27.728 - 00:12:21.994, Speaker A: They launch international perps. So that was a big revenue driver for Coinbase. And sorry, for binance and other exchanges, they've expanded internationally, they've been very vocal in their presence in the UK and other jurisdictions, and they've gotten licenses to serve these jurisdictions more easily. They've also obviously launched their l two, which is kind of a curated experience for users, 100 million plus to enter into web three. And I think if they're ever going to do that, they're probably going to enter through Coinbase. And I don't think the market fully appreciates the revenue potential and opportunities, not only from a customer retention and acquisition standpoint, because all of a sudden your product, the suite of products that you offer just becomes more compelling. But also the modernization of said customers just has increased pretty dramatically.
00:12:21.994 - 00:12:58.410, Speaker A: And I think the market is very critical of the stock and continues to be critical in the sense of, hey, spreads are going down, right? Revenue fees are going down. Obviously, in a bear market, trading volume goes down. But also the percentage fee that Coinbase has taken historically has been pretty fat, pretty high, and that over time goes down through competition. No different than, like, the stock brokerage firms went through this kind of transition, too. You remember when Robinhood and Wealthfront launched, they were seeing zero commission trades. Everyone freaked out. He was like, oh, my God, the schwabs of the world are going to go out of business.
00:12:58.410 - 00:13:21.172, Speaker A: They didnt. They just found other ways to monetize. And I think thats a similar transition the market is going to wake up to in coinbases. Incredible revenue generation and not to mention USDC. For the first time ever, they broke down the profitability of how much they're making actually on a lot of customers. Hold the stablecoin called USDC. They're buying treasuries.
00:13:21.172 - 00:13:35.628, Speaker A: They're earning some net interest on that, which they're sharing some to customers, but they're taking some as well. And so all that combined is just. Anyways, my thesis for coin, I mean, none of this is financial.
00:13:35.756 - 00:13:54.962, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. All right, so takeaway number one, like, by the way, I agree with you, long Coinbase, that's takeaway number one, takeaway. And by the way, Coinbase, I was looking at the revenue numbers. 2018 520 million. 2019, roughly the same. I think it was like 480, 21.1 billion past a billion in revenue for the first time.
00:13:54.962 - 00:14:15.942, Speaker B: Fast forward two years, 2022, 3 billion in revenue this year. It's expected they'll do around the same. Probably a little less than 3 billion. I think it's a coiled spring, but we'll see. I don't want to just come on here and pump Coinbase. So that's the first thing takeaway is good for Coinbase. Second takeaway I would have is when you talk to people about the last remaining buckets of FUD in the industry, it was finance and tether.
00:14:15.942 - 00:14:41.630, Speaker B: Those were the two things. And I think it's like you've basically heard this for. You've been in crypto for a while, a little longer than I have. You've heard this story before, which is crypto can't survive without insert thing, whether it's Mount Gox or Bitmex or FTX or Binance. And I think Matt Hogan said it well. He's like, what people miss is that crypto is incredibly antifragile. Right.
00:14:41.630 - 00:14:59.318, Speaker B: And it's much bigger than any one trading venue. So I'm looking at the numbers here. Binance has roughly 60% of the total liquidity in crypto. And I don't know, I think it's. Crypto is much more antifragile than anyone realizes.
00:14:59.366 - 00:15:01.766, Speaker A: I mean, look, to be fair, finance will continue to operate.
00:15:01.870 - 00:15:08.966, Speaker B: Yeah. I saw people making comparisons to FTX, by the way, and I think it's just good to. These are two completely different situations here.
00:15:09.070 - 00:15:12.622, Speaker A: I mean, one of them didn't misappropriate customer funds.
00:15:12.798 - 00:15:15.318, Speaker B: These aren't these aren't even comparable. Yeah.
00:15:15.366 - 00:15:49.168, Speaker A: Like, like, yeah. Let's be very clear here. The issues and the fines are related to Binance's. Binance facilitating trade and flows in and out of sanctioned countries in the same way that BitMex, like, did, right. It was not related to, you know, man, like, being insolvent or any of that nature, which is what FTX did, right? That's fraudulent activity. Now CZ's pleading guilty to that. You know, he said, look, we're a young company, whatever.
00:15:49.168 - 00:16:08.744, Speaker A: Like, we should have done better. We had better, should have had better compliance policies in place. Yada, yada, yada. There's some implications to that. But it's night and day, right? Way worse. Yeah. If there was insolvent, the biggest concern was, and look, binance, like, the biggest concern was, like, proof of reserves.
00:16:09.044 - 00:16:30.014, Speaker B: Like, it was two things that was. The absolute worst was proof of reserves. The second worst was a full binance shutdown. There was basically four things that I think people were considering. Slap on the risk on the wrist, kind of like this, like, neutral thing where nothing really happens. A binance shutdown and then lack of proof of reserves, like an FTX situation. And this basically just.
00:16:30.014 - 00:16:56.898, Speaker B: I think the last one would have been catastrophic to crypto. The full binance shutdown probably would have been market nukes by like 40, 50%. This kind of like, limbo phase would have been, I don't know, just kind of like where we're at right now. And what we just got was, I think it was Jonah from Cumberland or X. Cumberland said, he's like, look, this is a slap on the wrist. Slap on the wrist is a buy everything type of moment. So people outside the industry, I think, were.
00:16:56.898 - 00:17:16.214, Speaker B: I got an email from my uncle saying, this guy's going to jail, what's probably horrible for crypto. And I think that's the take from outsiders, that this is another FTX moment, another criminal running a big thing. And to people inside of the industry, it's very exciting. It's a big de risking moment, I think.
00:17:16.594 - 00:17:57.932, Speaker A: And for context, binance has been producing proof of reserves for quite a while now. You know, of course, they during, like, I think it was that proof of reserves of Binance went live in November of 2022. People took object in the way they were managing that and whatnot, but they were producing proof of reserves for a while now. And that's not the case for what certainly wasn't the case for FTX. And so, you know, there have been limitations, they've been improving the proof of reserves. The way they reported that, you know, in February 2023, for context, they did a major upgrade. The developers implemented CK snark protocols on top of the core.
00:17:57.932 - 00:18:05.620, Speaker A: Merkle. Look, I don't want to get into all the mechanics, but it's like an audit, right? There are a lot of components to a proof of, like.
00:18:05.692 - 00:18:13.124, Speaker B: Yeah, the wallet control. You can see the wallets control about $65 billion worth of funds. I think this is a non conversation. Even. I don't even.
00:18:13.204 - 00:18:52.220, Speaker A: Yeah, like. And the issue was, of course, during these moments of walls of worry, not just in crypto panic, as Howard marks likes to say. Pendulums swing to extremes, whereas the actual reality of things, they're never that extreme. Of course, there's fat tail events that can be catastrophic and destabilizing, like a global financial crisis or whatever, where the wisdom of the crowd gets it wrong. Uh, like a hurricane, something like that. But for the most part, like, I think the market went from total euphoria to total skepticism. And everything is FTX.
00:18:52.220 - 00:19:12.752, Speaker A: And a lot of people, Adams, of the world just went on this ramp. Like, just went on this. Like, they were traumatized by FTX because they were super bullish FTX. And they were, like, caught up, like, oh, shit, you know, like, maybe I should have, like, been a little bit more cautious, and then everything looks like FTX, and that's, like, we should just kind of be more calm and objective.
00:19:12.928 - 00:19:13.724, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:19:14.464 - 00:19:38.084, Speaker A: And was it priced in? No, there was. There's always in crypto some, like, crippling fear. Right. Because trauma is real for crypto ogs or anyone that's been here for a while. Like, it's. It's very hard to work through trauma and, like, move past it. It will be very paralyzing.
00:19:38.084 - 00:20:20.736, Speaker A: There are so many things that are overlooked in bear markets as they are in bull markets because of these traumatic moments. You're in fear or you're operating from a place of. You, of course, don't want to make the same mistakes, but I think that can be a bit paralyzing. Now, that's a topic for a totally separate podcast, which sort of dovetails into what we were talking about in the prior episode of how we position our portfolio, how you think about narratives that are being overlooked. I think there are so many of them. We're going to have Robbie, from immutable to talk about gaming, which I've talked about extensively here, but stuff like that, you know, you had play to earn people. You know, Axie and so many other projects went through that kind of hype cycle.
00:20:20.736 - 00:21:23.204, Speaker A: They're now despair, and people are totally discrediting gaming. It's like, it's not going to work, guys. I'm like, okay, is it really not going to work? Like, so anyways, that's just a market in total trauma mode, and it has been for quite some months. And so this news announcement, I think, is really impactful to kind of move past that trauma. And more importantly, one of the things that Brian said in his interview, I think it was on Bloomberg, he said it now places a lot of emphasis on rulemaking. You know, let's actually have clarity. And I think there's been a lot of progress during the past year and a half or so, but now that we have these big, fine events, it's like, all right, let's actually go back to the more important matter at hand and craft rules, very clear rules and regulations so that it allows folks like Coinbase and binance to operate within the law.
00:21:23.204 - 00:21:53.060, Speaker A: And I think that's going to be the major theme over the next year or so. Right. Of course, there's elections coming up, but I think that's really now. I think now regulators, look, they brought enforcement action against Kraken, which is a bit of noise, and they keep punting and delaying resolution on the coinbase front and the ETF stuff. But they're kind of running out of excuses not to provide clarity to an industry that time and time again. It's like, okay, maybe we didn't operate within the lines. We paid this huge fines, okay.
00:21:53.060 - 00:22:04.100, Speaker A: But, like, the intent is very positive, even from players like Binance. It's like, all right, you know, we want to do right. We believe in the technology. Let's just, like, get to a place where we have clear rules. Right?
00:22:04.212 - 00:22:46.238, Speaker B: Yeah. Now, the only downside that I could see from. From a lot of this is that so SEC is clearly getting weaker and weaker. They keep losing these cases. They kind of went after this, like, what I would say a foolish Kraken case after they already settled with Kraken earlier in the year. However, I think it was Yellen said, or the other person who spoke, the DOJ guy, I forget who that was, but said, if you are operating a Defi company, I don't know if you watch that talk, but it feels like they're signaling what they're coming after next. It does feel like as the SEC gets weaker, potentially, the DOJ is getting stronger here and or coming after crypto a bit more.
00:22:46.238 - 00:23:15.298, Speaker B: I would have to imagine that. So they've gained access to a lot of the code from binance and a lot of the messages and 100% of the logs. The only explanation for that and what you said in the very beginning of the show, which is he complied, so the dollar amount was lower. CZ negotiated this treaty. I would say it's probably pretty likely the DOJ. This is the first of a couple of DOJ things that they start bringing companies. And that's probably the downside of this.
00:23:15.386 - 00:23:43.142, Speaker A: Yeah. Like, any sort of type of bad actors that have sent funds to binance or whatever, and maybe that allows intelligence units to, you know, or like DOJ to. To work on probably enforcement actions or cases they have open, but they haven't really gotten full resolution. But now that, you know, a lot of flow has gone through binance. And so now it's, you know, folks like, even like Zach, right. He flags, hey, like, these addresses. People buy these addresses and Kyc addresses.
00:23:43.142 - 00:24:08.594, Speaker A: And then, you know, sometimes, you know, I think that now that they have this data, historically, I think maybe easier for them to. To build the cases. Uh, which I think is a good thing. Like, you know, if you've been doing shady or fraudulent stuff and you've been working with an exchange, good luck. Like, those are the. I have no problem that that's very positive for the space. I don't fully appreciate the defi stuff.
00:24:08.594 - 00:25:01.804, Speaker A: I'm refreshing my memory on the pod, the latest regulatory pod with Rebecca and Jake. And I saw Rebecca recently in person. There have been proposed pieces of legislation that could be very damning for DeFi, like the traveling rule and some of this stuff that would make it almost impossible to interact in DeFi and pools of liquidity, if not everyone's KYC and whatever. I just want to remind people, like, we hear this, but like an agency, my understanding is an agency might have an opinion, a particular, but that doesn't mean it's law. And it. Unless and until it's law and pass, it could be like, there's a heavy commenting period for a lot of these new bills that. That are, you know, crafting regulation for the different pieces of crypto.
00:25:01.804 - 00:25:20.924, Speaker A: Of course, DeFi is important in some of these bills, but these bills haven't been, like, passed. And there's a. There's a. People should go listen to that episode because it is super important if you're listening, if you're running DeFi protocol, if you're a fan of Defi. Interestingly, CZ said that he wants to spend more time, like, looking at Defi.
00:25:21.504 - 00:25:22.244, Speaker B: Great.
00:25:22.824 - 00:25:58.010, Speaker A: Yeah. If you're wondering, like, there is, there's a great way to get involved, right. And comment on these bills because they're not perfect by any stretch of the imagination. Like, they missed the mark on so many things like the stable coin bill and some of these other bills. So, yeah, like, time and time again, they bring Defi into the limelight of like, hey, you know, especially like the CFTC or the SEC, right. Because, you know, it's, they're trading on like closer to the regular. There's clear regulations for like, financial firms, right.
00:25:58.010 - 00:26:30.384, Speaker A: But the biggest thing, like, for instance, when FTX went down, everyone was like, you know, this is why we, we need to shut down Defi. I'm like, well, no, I think they peeled it back in a bit. And the rhetoric was peeled back as well in the sense that, like, Defi is not FTX. In fact, if FTX were operating as a true defi protocol, it would never happen. You know, Aave hasn't been insolvent. Like there's, you know, insurance funds that may be impacted if there's bat debt, but it's all on chain. It's all transparent.
00:26:30.384 - 00:27:09.272, Speaker A: So anyways, a long ramble, but I'm not surprised that they make those comments. You know, we have to also appreciate it's an, we're going into an election year, and during election years, politicians always want to, you know, they're looking out for themselves, right. And they want to make headlines. And crypto is a great opportunity and has been for people to make headlines. That doesn't mean it's the law. That doesn't mean it's the interpretation of the court, and it doesn't mean it's a sentiment of the overall government. So I'm just gonna say that because it's important, right.
00:27:09.272 - 00:27:17.568, Speaker A: When we hear these headlines, like the New York Times of the world is always gonna report and always take the most negative spin as they have been doing on things.
00:27:17.616 - 00:27:24.858, Speaker B: That's what I read the New York Times, things. Criminals going to jail. And by the way, what is a crypto exchange?
00:27:24.906 - 00:27:37.974, Speaker A: So, yeah, meanwhile, they're taking the softest stance on the whole Israel Gaza situation. Oh, yeah. No, no, that's not like report with the true veracity there, right? Just a bunch of idiots.
00:27:39.834 - 00:27:44.414, Speaker B: Speaking of, I don't know, I was going to try to use a bunch of idiots and pivot into blast.
00:27:45.154 - 00:27:46.226, Speaker A: Oh, yeah. Yeah.
00:27:46.370 - 00:28:09.738, Speaker B: But Joseph told me I have to read, I have to. I messed up our ad read for the digital asset summit, so I have to do it live, which is that it's Black Friday. When you're listening to this. And we have Blackrock Friday at Blockworks here. Instead of Black Friday, we got Blackrock Friday. So you get 20% off four packs of das tickets. People were reaching out to us saying, hey, we want to buy tickets for our whole team.
00:28:09.738 - 00:28:19.866, Speaker B: So we launched these things called four packs. And if you go, I think the code is Blackrock Empire on the das page. So if you enter Blackrock empire, you will get 20% off.
00:28:19.970 - 00:28:22.288, Speaker A: Is that because Blackrock is sponsoring it or.
00:28:22.466 - 00:28:23.892, Speaker B: We got an announcement coming soon.
00:28:23.948 - 00:28:27.904, Speaker A: You'll see it's related to Blackrock.
00:28:31.964 - 00:28:32.716, Speaker B: On that one.
00:28:32.780 - 00:28:33.100, Speaker A: I just.
00:28:33.132 - 00:28:36.144, Speaker B: I just read what Joseph tells me to read, man. I don't, I don't.
00:28:36.524 - 00:28:37.668, Speaker A: He's a great guy.
00:28:37.836 - 00:28:38.824, Speaker B: Thank you, guys.
00:28:41.844 - 00:28:46.668, Speaker A: Yeah, well, London, it's gonna be great. Yeah, I'm planning on being there. It is.
00:28:46.716 - 00:28:53.394, Speaker B: It's gonna be great. Let's talk about blast. Why don't I tee up the blast conversation?
00:28:53.554 - 00:29:05.842, Speaker A: Please do. And I'm just going to say I'm biased here, folks. I'm an investor. I was an early seed investor in blur. I also invested in blast. So everything that I say, website and.
00:29:05.858 - 00:29:07.374, Speaker B: Your face is on the homepage.
00:29:10.034 - 00:29:24.360, Speaker A: I can tell the story, how this came together. And we're going to have Pac man. We had him very early on with his building blur. We're going to have him on again. He is catching up on sleep, but he'll come on soon.
00:29:24.472 - 00:29:53.532, Speaker B: Yeah. Great. All right. Why don't I tee up this conversation from an outsider's point of view and just what I saw on Twitter and stuff like that, and then I'd love to hear the backstory of this. So blast is an l two created by Blur and by Pac man, who's also the founder of Blur. If you guys remember, Blur was an NFT marketplace that challenged some of the ideas of what it looks like to trade. NFTs, took on OpenSea, gained a lot of volume and market share relative to OpenSea, maybe a year ago, a little more than a year ago.
00:29:53.532 - 00:30:25.264, Speaker B: So Pac man said, I came out with this tweet the other day, said, look, I can just read it directly. It says basically Blur wanted to build on l two. There wasn't a good l two that they could find that had some of the things that they wanted. Specifically, that thing was native yield on the chain. So he said, look, if it doesn't exist, I can go build it. So the basic premise behind blast is that they're offering native yield on assets like ETH and stablecoins. And I think what this means is they're basically doing two things.
00:30:25.264 - 00:31:29.594, Speaker B: One is they're participating in ETH staking any assets, any ETH that's been bridged over to blast basically gets a yield. And they're doing this in two ways. They participate in ETH staking, and two, they're sending stable coins to protocols like maker to bring that t bill yield on chain, again via folks like Maker, which is then passed through to users of the blast l two. And for folks who really criticize this on Twitter, this idea of, like, an l two with native yield, I think it's important to just look at the amount of capital that's sitting on l two s without any yield, right. If you look at something like. So when you bridge ETH, for example, to another l two, you send ETH to a bridging contract, and it kind of mints ETH, kind of like a receipt token on the l two. However, all that ETH is typically not staked, right? For example, the arbitrum bridge has about, last time I looked, two and a half or $3 billion of ETH sitting there.
00:31:29.594 - 00:32:11.298, Speaker B: So let's say we use that two and a half billion dollar number. If all that ETH were staked, earning 4%, that means that arbitrum could, arbitrum and or arbitrum's users, depending on how they want to allocate it, would be earning an extra $100 million in ETH per year. So I think that's basically the thesis, is that, and we've seen this before, too, with gnosis. So gnosis launch their own chain. They stake all of the dai, and that earns 5%. And as a result, DAI stakers on gnosis earn this, like five or six or 7% yield. So if you assume that maybe $100 million of stables are bridged over to blast, let's call it 50 million gets staked.
00:32:11.298 - 00:32:44.580, Speaker B: The rest is sitting in wallets or maybe used in defi. If 100 million is earning 5%, or let's say 50 million is earning 5%, you're looking at two and a half million dollars. That's going back to either the blast protocol or to users. That's the high level overview that I would say. But maybe give me the. And we can talk about the reaction, which was both. I saw some very positive reactions, very negative reactions as well, been about 40 or $50 million of liquidity that's been bridged over already.
00:32:44.580 - 00:32:50.664, Speaker B: But what's the backstory here? How did Pac man approach investors? As much as you're open to sharing here. Santi.
00:32:51.364 - 00:33:22.874, Speaker A: Yeah. So for context, my first interaction with the blast team was like, I didn't know it was Pac man. It was sort of, I was introduced by a good friend of mine who actually brought me blur. And so again, she has a good relationship with Pac man. And so she's like, hey, you ought to talk to, you know, I know you invest in infrastructure. You just got to take a look at this l two. My first reaction was, do we need another l two? And I had a long discussion with Pac man at the time.
00:33:22.874 - 00:33:43.730, Speaker A: Like, I didn't know it was him on the other side. Then, of course, I knew later on, but you had a call with someone and they were like, it was like, he went by Sudo. I was like, okay, well, fine, I'm going to take the call. So I took the call and I was like, my first question is, I'm just going to stop you. Why do we need another l two? And, you know, I'm an investor in others. One's an l two s. And so he's like, well, because none of them have, like, native yield.
00:33:43.730 - 00:34:38.953, Speaker A: And I said, like, can you unpack that? No pun intended. And, and he went through what you just referenced. I was like, well, how easy, one, why have current l two s not done this? And how easy is it would be for them to kind of just adopt this standard? And they're like, well, they kind of have to re architect it because a lot of these l two s have been in development for a long time. It's like, all right, fair. And so, of course, then, and we'll reference the tweet. You know, the idea to do blast really starts to make sense when you understand that they've, you know, they face these challenges when building blur. And again, for context, like, a lot of people deposit ETH into these pools, you know, kind of waiting for some sort of event where they can at some point swap for nfts, but they're earning some yield, they're earning some points.
00:34:38.953 - 00:35:26.936, Speaker A: It's an incentivized pool, if you will, these kind of blur seasons, but they're not earning like native ETH yield by staking it on Lido, for instance, or some other Lst. And they're not earning yield on stable coins. And so I think that alone is a very compelling value prop. And one of the things that I've always been impressed by Pac man is he's one of those founders that, like, every good founder, has very one liner to crystallize exactly why they're doing when we had him on early on. He said traders need a dedicated venue to, like active traders need a dedicated venue to trade NFTs and that's not Opensea and I'm going to build that for them. And he was just very focused on that. Right.
00:35:26.936 - 00:36:05.024, Speaker A: Which I think is, is a hallmark of a great founder. And in this case, I think this l two is directly informed by the experience that they've had and the challenges that they faced and the feedback that they've gotten from the customers, which, by the way, they've gotten a lot of traction and blur, in my opinion, and I'm biased, of course, because I'm also an investor, it is a dominant NFT marketplace and venue, especially for traders. Yeah, I think, I don't know if you want to dig more into that. I participate in the round. I plan to help them as much as I can.
00:36:06.364 - 00:36:29.382, Speaker B: I have a question on the round here. When I was reading it, it said I originally thought that they raised $20 million from Paradigm and Standard, but then it said they raised 20 million. Contributors of blast have raised 20 million from. And it seemed like they were wording that carefully to say it doesn't really mean blast, but the contributors of the contributors of blast and like, I think.
00:36:29.398 - 00:36:37.474, Speaker A: A lot of, a lot of invest early investors in blur ended up participating in the round. Of course, it was led by paradigm and Standard.
00:36:38.054 - 00:36:44.742, Speaker B: Was this actually a separate round or was this the money that Pac man raised for blur also got included in blast? No.
00:36:44.798 - 00:37:31.516, Speaker A: My understanding is no. So this is a separate, like round four blast and it has a lot of the same investors in Blur but also new investors. Of course, Paradigm was an early backer of Blur and now I think through the relationship with Pac man, led the round. Standard, my understanding, was not involved in blur early on. Maybe they have. They've like. But anyways, it was those two funds and then a whole host of, like the blur, like the blur around was a lot of people active in NFT, trading in the community and in a similar matter, I think that he took a lot of the same playbook and invited a lot of people that participated in this round were people that have known him.
00:37:31.540 - 00:37:48.572, Speaker B: He liked very native crypto, the very native hasaka and e girl. And I saw folks like Leshner were tweeting out, what is the, how did that go down? Was there a telegram chat with just all the blast investors? And he's like, all right, like 02:00 p.m. On a Monday, we're ripping this.
00:37:48.588 - 00:38:10.824, Speaker A: Tweet out or I committed before and then, yeah, now joined like a group of all the investors just to coordinate and stay on top of announcements and developments. And it's a lot of people I know. And so, yeah. All right, everyone.
00:38:10.864 - 00:38:46.226, Speaker B: So we talk a lot about the institutions coming into crypto on empire. Santi and I are both headed out to London March 18 to 20th for Blockworks 8th ever Digital Asset Summit. Das this is an institutional buttoned up conference that we've hosted since 2019. I like to joke that it is probably the last remaining kind of suit and tie event in crypto. People are still wearing suit and tie. It's pretty funny, but you'll actually hear from a lot of the largest institutions in the world coming from standard Charter, FIS, JPMorgan framework. Folks coming out Wintermute, Vanek, Goldman Sachs there are a couple big themes of this conference.
00:38:46.226 - 00:39:11.414, Speaker B: One, bitcoin catalysts, the halving and the spot ETF. Two, a view from the buy side. Three, Rwas tokenization and stable coins. Four, global regulatory frameworks five, institutional infrastructure, including banking and payments and six, the macro case for crypto. If you have anything to do with the institutional side of crypto, you have to be there. Santi and I got your back. We hooked you up with a 20% off code.
00:39:11.414 - 00:39:47.354, Speaker B: It is empire 20. There is a little competition running internally at blockworks to see who can drive the most number of tickets. So help Santi and I out register with our code and you get 20% off. That is empire 20. This episode is brought to you by the Chronicle Protocol, a cost efficient, transparent and decentralized oracle that gives protocols verifiable on chain data for the frequent listeners of empire. You know that we talk a lot about Makerdao. Well, Chronicle protocol is a novel oracle solution that has exclusively secured over 10 billion in assets for Makerdao and its ecosystem since 2017.
00:39:47.354 - 00:40:30.258, Speaker B: And for the first time ever, Chronicles Oracle services are now publicly available. Why should you use Chronicle? It's simple. Chronicle offers a 60% reduction in gas fees for all of their leading counterparts. Also super cool. They have unparalleled transparency when it comes to oracles. Chronicle offers a dashboard that allows anyone to track the genesis and trajectory of the data it provides. This is the first time ever that an oracle has made all of its data verifiable, setting a new standard for the accessibility of on chain data endorsed by a network of the most revered validators, including Etherscan, Infuria, gitcoin, DYDX, and Makerdao, Chronicle is the epitome of security and reliability in the oracle space.
00:40:30.258 - 00:41:20.092, Speaker B: It's time for a paradigm shift in oracle development. You can learn more about chronicle@chroniclelabs.org. Dot big thanks to chronicle for sponsoring empire. Today's episode is brought to you by Northstake, the secure and compliant staking platform for institutional investors. Northstake is purpose built for institutions that want to enable the ability to move in and out of staked ETH seamlessly while controlling all aspects of their fund management. Northstake's Tokenized ETH staking service offers institutions easy, low risk crypto yield opportunities, complies with both AML and Meca regulations, making it possible for institutions to tap into Ethereum's growth and earn staking rewards even through these pretty turbulent regulatory times. In crypto, if you are an institutional investor seeking compliant crypto exposure and yield, north stake streamlines that all for you.
00:41:20.092 - 00:41:44.148, Speaker B: To get started, head over to Norstake DK tokenized e staking I know you're probably not going to go to that long URL, so just click the link in the description of the episode. That'll take you right to Norsteak site. Or if you're on YouTube, scan the QR code on your screen right now. Now let's get back to the episode. All right, can I run some of the pushback by you and you tell me, all right, it wasn't a perfect.
00:41:44.196 - 00:41:48.056, Speaker A: Launch, you know, and we can dissect that as much as.
00:41:48.240 - 00:41:51.464, Speaker B: Well, I would actually argue it was a phenomenal launch.
00:41:51.624 - 00:42:01.688, Speaker A: Well, not perfect. I said, yeah, nothing really is ever. But for all, there's some reasons why it went very well and there's some things that I think could have been improved.
00:42:01.856 - 00:42:27.840, Speaker B: There were, there was a messaging problem. I think I'm just going to read one of this, one of these users tweets. They're very clearly aware of that. That is, compare how they talked about ethanol. ETH itself is natively rebasing versus stables USDB blast auto rebasing stablecoin on their website. From the website users transact in ETH dapps are built around ETH blast was designed from the ground up so that ETH itself is natively rebasing on the l two. This is simply false.
00:42:27.840 - 00:42:39.804, Speaker B: It is not ETH itself. It is something similar to steeth and not making the distinction as reckless. So what do you think about that idea that they are basically saying ETH is rebasing, but really it is not actually ETH here.
00:42:41.854 - 00:43:06.138, Speaker A: Yeah, they're working with Lido on the backend. The way it works is it's a one way bridge at the moment you deposit smeath into the contract. And I think they very clearly said, you're not going to have this ETH available until we launch in February. So that, I think was clear. It was really the messaging where people took object, and it's fair criticism.
00:43:06.286 - 00:43:09.602, Speaker B: The risk. The risk free messaging or what, it.
00:43:09.618 - 00:43:16.026, Speaker A: Was really that, that I think, you know, I just don't think you should ever use that word in crypto, the.
00:43:16.050 - 00:43:54.230, Speaker B: Word risk free rate. Yeah, yeah. I mean, I will say it was good to see, like, people calling out. That was one of the things that hopefully one of the learnings, as an industry, of calling out what people perceive to be bad actors. And I'd rather have people perceive that something like this is bad and then have them execute and show them that they're not a bad actor. I think what people were really panicked about was, what it sounds like is they're taking user funds and investing them. They're working with Lido on staking, but they're taking basically user assets, investing them into t bills, and they're calling it risk free.
00:43:54.230 - 00:44:03.618, Speaker B: So that's not like, t bills are very low risk, but there's still smart contract risk. There's a bunch of other risks. So it's not really honest to call it a risk free rate.
00:44:03.666 - 00:44:09.186, Speaker A: Yeah, maybe, look, wave a wand, do a scan, you say, hey, guys, look, this is the mechanism by which we're going to earn your yield.
00:44:09.370 - 00:44:10.170, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:44:10.362 - 00:44:52.306, Speaker A: And here are the risks, here's how it works, and we're going to build, and here's just could have been a bit more upfront. And this is a message for any protocol, right. I think more emphasis on that would have been appreciated, and I think that would have gone a long way. So, you know, I think that the team realizes that. And, you know, one of the things that, like, with blur, you know, you never get these things 100% right. But, you know, I would have emphasized that a bit more versus, like, how the mechanism for earning points works, which, look at the thing is important, like, incentivizing people to do that and whatnot. People are very quick to call it like a Ponzi pyramid scheme.
00:44:52.306 - 00:45:07.542, Speaker A: I'm like, look, there's a difference between upon, like, Ponzi, like, there's a difference between a pyramid scheme and a multi and multilevel marketing. And this goes back to a fight that has happened not only in crypto, but like, you know, herbalife as an example, like Ackman.
00:45:07.598 - 00:45:09.622, Speaker B: And I can enter the chat and.
00:45:09.638 - 00:45:15.474, Speaker A: The difference, and I don't think so. You know what the difference between MLM, multi level marketing, and a pyramid scheme is?
00:45:16.214 - 00:45:24.694, Speaker B: I actually. I have a lot of experience with this. Yes, I do. I remember watching these another day. My friend's story for another day.
00:45:26.834 - 00:45:27.570, Speaker A: I'm going to book.
00:45:27.642 - 00:45:55.366, Speaker B: There's actually a technical definition of it, which is that. Yeah. For a pyramid scheme to be. For something like herbalife and Amway to be legal, a certain number of investors or a certain number of people. Actually have to be using the product. Actually have to use the product, instead of just buying it, to then flip on someone else. The reason why amway is able to still exist is an herbalife and all these folks is enough people actually buy the product.
00:45:55.430 - 00:46:18.230, Speaker A: It's like a real product. Like you maybe would have said, these vitamins don't work. It's expensive piss, yada, yada, yada. But it's a product that people use. And as long as it's that and you're selling that, it's a multilevel marketing and it's okay. Now, you might have disagreements with that, and how people are pushy and who's being targeted. But if they're selling a real product, that's multilevel marketing.
00:46:18.230 - 00:46:24.190, Speaker A: It's not a pyramid scheme. A pyramid scheme is when someone sells you stuff that is vaporware. It's like there's no product behind it.
00:46:24.222 - 00:46:26.030, Speaker B: Right. Yeah.
00:46:26.062 - 00:46:45.854, Speaker A: And so, yeah, in this case, you could argue, look, they're building a real product. They're going to deliver on that in February. If they never deliver a product. That's the issue that every crypto protocol faces. Right. But this is a team that's actually, like, they're phenomenal builders. And so that's where I predicated my thesis.
00:46:45.854 - 00:47:17.588, Speaker A: And you could see that in the work that they've done with blur. Like, it's just a phenomenal product. And so, again, you know, we can talk about issues with l two s and modular, monolithic. Like, all that stuff is an interesting discussion, that it's very relevant. And the construction of the l two. And, you know, the important things that one should look at when you're deciding whether interact in an execution environment. Like, what are the things that matter the most? Which means.
00:47:17.588 - 00:47:35.344, Speaker A: So that's like the more interesting, nuanced discussion that should happen. Absolutely. All the time. Not just with blast, but, like, with optimism, with arbitrum, with every other l two, with other any l one. Like, I think people get kind of caught up in the drama and the noise. And I'm happy to go through it now. I tweeted about this today.
00:47:35.344 - 00:47:52.370, Speaker A: And the most important thing for nl two, in my opinion, is like, that you can verify and, like, validity and verification of an execution of a block. If you can't do that, run away like it's an issue.
00:47:52.482 - 00:48:03.122, Speaker B: Well, let me ask you this then. Why didn't blast just do the harder thing and wait? Like they basically deployed as an, as an l? As an l. Like they just, they're just a deposit with a multi sig, right?
00:48:03.178 - 00:48:05.246, Speaker A: Yeah, that's what it is at the moment.
00:48:05.350 - 00:48:15.234, Speaker B: Yeah, it's just a deposit with a multisig. And the idea is like, hey, we're going to obviously build this down the road. Why did they actually just wait and deploy as an l two?
00:48:15.614 - 00:48:27.822, Speaker A: That's a great question. I mean, I think it's, again, like, they could have done that. I think. I didn't directly ask the question. Yeah, but this is something we should definitely discuss when he comes on. Pac man.
00:48:27.878 - 00:48:28.350, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:48:28.462 - 00:48:59.618, Speaker A: My intuition is that, you know, you just sort of, um, like a lot of projects too. You know, you, you want to attract liquidity and, and lock it. And from day one, you want to have all these kind of users. Yeah. Because that's really the most important thing. Like a lot of, if you look at other launches across ecosystems, like there's this idea of an incentivized testnet and get all these builders, you know, from a BD perspective. Let me ask you a question.
00:48:59.618 - 00:49:45.850, Speaker A: If you're. Because now blast has over 100 million in tvl deposits, they're there. So if you're working at BD blast and you go to teams and you say, hey, guys, we're building this l two for the team from Blur. We have a lot of experience, trust us, we're going to build it. Do you want to deploy on us? They're like, you know what, call me when you actually launch and you have a testnet because we have the ability to do other stuff right now. You can go on some of the other l two s, but now the discussion is much more. It's different when you say, hey, guys, we have all this interest and it's there and people are taking this and willing to lock up their capital because they're excited about who's behind it and who's building it.
00:49:45.850 - 00:50:03.320, Speaker A: Do you want to come and build in tandem with how we, like, build this l two? And I think that's really the more important thing is, you know, the worst thing is having a product that, you know, from day one, like you bootstrap these networks, you want to have supply and demand. Right. And a lot of that hinges on having stuff to do on the l two.
00:50:03.472 - 00:50:03.800, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:50:03.832 - 00:50:54.362, Speaker A: Like, some of the more successful launches, like Arbitram, did it exceptionally well, where they just really did a great testnet, where they had a lot of developers open. Like, open. Any developer could come and build. And I think now that's a blast. Is an interesting situation where I think their ability. The bottom line is, I think the ability for them to attract builders, which is fundamental for this to be competitive and actually be very differentiated, is the reason why I think they launched it in this manner where they opened a gate to have open interest and signal their intent to kind of interact in the cell two. And look, you know, we talk about, like, you can stake ETH, you can stake stables, but also you can lock your blur as well.
00:50:54.362 - 00:51:38.662, Speaker A: And so season two of blur just ended, and a lot of people got the airdrop, you know, price action. Today, blur is up, like, over 40%. And I think a lot of the, there's a lot of interest in people that, you know, are very active in blur to now participate in the cell, too. And look, of course it's incentivized. Like, you know, like, that's like, the nature of crypto. You incentivize testnets, and you have incentivized, you know, and you have airdrops, like, you know, so anyone that's kind of critical of that, like, okay, well, you know, we are in a space of incentives, and you have to incentivize people to come over, you know, and I don't see a problem with that. I think this is a very creative way of doing it.
00:51:38.662 - 00:51:48.166, Speaker A: Um, you know, the narrative was not perfect, for sure. The language was not perfect, for sure. Um, and that's, I think, something that could definitely be improved.
00:51:48.270 - 00:51:49.006, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:51:49.190 - 00:51:50.294, Speaker A: Like, it's not risk free.
00:51:50.374 - 00:51:55.406, Speaker B: Really close. Yeah, I know you're really close with the arbitram guys and, like, Steven and stuff. It's. It's, uh.
00:51:55.510 - 00:52:02.198, Speaker A: Yeah, and Stephen came out with great tweets. I mean, and again, time and time again, he's been saying guys, like, there are.
00:52:02.286 - 00:52:12.964, Speaker B: His point is, you have to be very honest and have a very open conversation about what is an l two and what is actually secured by Ethereum. And I think, look, I've had private.
00:52:13.084 - 00:53:10.330, Speaker A: Discussions with Stephen, and now he's more open about it. But for a long time, he was like, imagine the frustration of a team that's been building since quietly, since the early days of Ethereum in Princeton, and no one really knew arbitrum when I led the round, when I was a paraphrase, and then, like, as personally invested, it was not very well known. It was like, why have you guys taken all these years to build this l two? Like, this was like 2015, 2016. And the reality is it's like, incredibly difficult to get it all right? Like, to build fraud proves, like. And, okay, there are people take issues like, oh, you know, your sequencer is not decentralized. Yeah, but you're nl two. Like, you don't need a decentralized sequencer to have, like, decentralizing the sequencer is something that people, like, look at and say, oh, there's just one entity running the sequencing, but that doesn't compromise.
00:53:10.330 - 00:53:31.404, Speaker A: Like, that has issues with censorship of transactions. But if you have fraud proofs, you can very clearly contest that and go back to the l one and settle that right now. That's not the case for other l two s. Like, optimism doesn't have fraud proofs. That's incredibly diffic. Like, that. That is, that's not an l two.
00:53:31.404 - 00:53:41.064, Speaker A: Like, if you don't have fraud proofs, you're not an l two. Full stop. Like, and I don't know how else to say it, like, but then why.
00:53:41.104 - 00:53:47.352, Speaker B: Like, why is it okay that for, like, why, why support blast but not support optimism?
00:53:47.488 - 00:53:49.168, Speaker A: Well, because you're gonna build it.
00:53:49.296 - 00:53:49.960, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:53:50.112 - 00:54:37.024, Speaker A: Like, this is something that I will push all day long. If I don't see fraud proofs in l two, I just can't rally behind it now. They're in development. Right. I had other kind of concerns around glass, like, how scalable is this earning yield? What are the dependencies when you're earning yield and there are some, right, you have to. And, but maybe long term is really good because if you just have maybe that this allows for other validators or like, lses to gain more traction if you incentivize them, right, and pull away from a lot of the dominance of lido. And maybe this attracts other real world asset protocols to gain much more, like Ando and some of these others.
00:54:37.024 - 00:55:39.552, Speaker A: So that, I think is positive. Of course, the strategy has some capacity constraints of earning yield. Or like, maybe there's a degradation in yield because again, a lot of this capital that is in l two is just not earning any yield and has this constant trade off. Now, you theoretically remove that trade off. You allow native yield in l two, of course, has an implication on the amount of ETH that is staked and where it's staked and where it's earning yield. And I think that's positive, but it also impacts the aggregate yield of the network, because if more ETH is being staked, well, then by default, the staking yield goes down. But then there's always this trade off of at some point, the native ETH yield goes to a point where the relative attractiveness is going farther on the risk spectrum of buying treasuries through a maker or some other protocol that is facilitating, that becomes better, but it becomes greater.
00:55:39.552 - 00:56:10.384, Speaker A: And so naturally, there's this kind of fluctuation in the risk free rate, which is, again, I'm going to use that term to talk about the benchmark rate is probably the better terminology here. The benchmark rate is the e staking yield. And that's going to always be the opportunity cost that you're going to take relative to doing other stuff that is farther on the risk spectrum. Because theoretically, staking ETH is this, that yield is like the lowest risk.
00:56:10.504 - 00:56:48.682, Speaker B: So let me tell you why. Let me just tell you why this scares me, Santi, a little bit. Just. I know I'm just to play devil's advocate here, the reason this scares me is because, all right, so if you look at all the innovations with l two s, they've either been technical or, like, technical innovations or, like, I guess I'd call them social innovations or, like, industry focus innovation. So you could either add differentiators in the way that you're adding, like, fraud proofs or ZK tech or something like that. Or you could focus on maybe a privacy first l two or gaming first l two. And what this is doing, and I think the reason it got a lot of pushback is this isn't saying, hey, we're going to build an l two with better tech or with a focus on gaming or anything like that.
00:56:48.682 - 00:57:43.242, Speaker B: We're making, actually, crypto economic adjustments. Instead of technical adjustments and social adjustments, we're making crypto economic adjustments. And I actually think Pacman is one of the best founders in all of crypto, and I think he'll do, I think blast specifically, like blast itself, probably will be one of the most, I think probably talked about l two s in 2024. However, what this does, and I think what this does, is it forces all the other l two s to start making crypto economic tweaks and adjustments. And what that reminds me of is what ended up blowing up the 2021 cycle, which was you had, like, really legitimate lenders, like take blockfi. Blockfi was a really legitimate company, but they started, they had to compete with someone like Celsius and Celsius was not legitimate. And so they, like Celsius, started having these, like, essentially what we now know were fake yields.
00:57:43.242 - 00:57:59.304, Speaker B: They were artificially inflated yields. So you had, like, 9% yield on Celsius. And then if you're blockfi, your venture back company, you need to get more users. Your real yield should be like three and a half, let's call it. But you had to pull it up to six and a half, or 7.5%, and that ended up blowing up an entire.
00:58:00.244 - 00:58:56.782, Speaker A: To be fair, that risk seeking behavior was. I think the issue was in this connectivity between tradfi applications and Defi and the carry trade that a lot of people depositing institutions were doing. They were promising a particular yield to their customers, the blockfi, Voyager, Gemini, urn, and who else? Like, you name it, but let's just stop there. And the issue was that they didn't know their counterparty well enough, they didn't do enough risk and due diligence, risk assessment and due diligence to understand where that yield was coming from. And as I will always say, and I think I coined this phrase, was, if you don't understand where the yields coming from, you are the yield. And I think they didn't properly understand where the yield was coming from, and they're earning their. To your point, they did get caught up in this competitiveness.
00:58:56.782 - 00:59:10.014, Speaker A: And I want to. You know, they're always looking at, oh, if Voyager is offering 4% on ETH, I need to offer 4.1. And then, you know, at some point that. That music stops, because there's so much.
00:59:10.094 - 00:59:18.214, Speaker B: But this is going to happen in l two s. Like, l two s. Well, l two competition was not that intense a year ago. Now, it's super, but it's a different.
00:59:18.334 - 00:59:40.834, Speaker A: I agree. It's different type of. I think the. The nuance here is, like, you understand where the yields coming from in this case, like, it's all on chain, and, well, it cannot. Well, it can. It's all in chain in the sense of, like. Like, if all of a sudden l two is telling you there's going to give you 15% on your stake teeth, you're like, uh.
00:59:40.834 - 00:59:43.426, Speaker A: Like, no, I don't think users care.
00:59:43.450 - 00:59:45.306, Speaker B: Where their ETH is coming from is the problem.
00:59:45.410 - 00:59:47.506, Speaker A: The yield is coming from where their.
00:59:47.530 - 01:00:18.852, Speaker B: Yield is coming from, and that's the problem. And it was the same problem. Like, right now, the yield for blast comes from ETH staking and treasuries like, those are very legit and won't blow anything up. But in a super competitive, let's fast forward 18 months ripping bull market, hundreds of millions being pumped, billions being pumped into l two s and venture money. L two space is the most competitive space in all of crypto. The yield then goes from like, hey, we're offering 4% yield, to hey, we're offering 12% yield. And like 5% of that is real.
01:00:18.852 - 01:00:29.024, Speaker B: It's coming from treasuries or staking. But the other 7% is made up of maybe they're yield farming with your ETH. Maybe they're using venture dollars to fund it.
01:00:29.364 - 01:00:44.128, Speaker A: I think the important thing to understand right now is, yeah, they're, they're earning in the deposited ETH is being converted to Steve and potentially going to go through maker as well. So you're absolutely right. You have to.
01:00:44.176 - 01:00:46.920, Speaker B: I'm talking about like, what I'm scared of for the other l two.
01:00:46.992 - 01:01:33.528, Speaker A: But it will, it's going to be an issue for blast and will be for any like even maker. Right. You have to understand where that yield comes from. And as a rule of thumb, if all of a sudden you're being promised a yield that is material from anything else you're doing, like if you're staking your ethan Lido is giving you 4% and someone comes in and gives you eight, well, you need to pause there and like, understand like what's the spread and where it's, where it's coming from. And maybe it's part of it is incentivized by the native l two token maybe, whatever, right? And you have to have a view on that. But yeah, like naturally, anything that has a higher yield has higher risk. And you need to understand that, that the risk that you're taking.
01:01:33.528 - 01:02:14.714, Speaker A: So I agree with you where I think it's going to be interesting. And look, Maker went through this kind of existential crisis where the early, early maker community was like super OG, very die hard in terms of principles. There was a contingent within the maker community that was like, this is pre defi summary that was just like, keep it pristine. Dai should be only collateralized by the most pristine asset. And that's ethereum. Like, just don't introduce other types of collateral. But then you have a capacity, right, constraint as you think about like Dai and its stability and its growth.
01:02:14.714 - 01:03:03.214, Speaker A: It was capped by the amount of ETH, right, and the market cap of ETH. And so as soon as you start introducing other forms of collateral, you migrate to multicollateral DAI and you introduce USDC again, totally different type of collateral. Some of it is more censorship resistant than others. Some of it is riskier than others. I think where people miss the point is oftentimes, like so many times in this, in this discussion, when it comes to crypto, like, people think of it in binary terms, like decentralization is a spectrum. Censorship and lack thereof, it's a spectrum. And I think people, we need to think more like that to really understand the relative riskiness, obviously the absolute risk, but also the relative risk.
01:03:03.214 - 01:03:45.422, Speaker A: And the rationale for introducing our argument for proposing multicolateral die as a tangent, but I'll be quick, is it's a matter of risk parameters and setting the right risk parameters. Um, because on one hand, if you just are backed by ETH, dais not going to go anywhere, the peg is probably going to like, like deep and then maker goes to zero because no one cares about this protocol. If you really want to grow and get more demand and get more loans and like CDP is open, like, you have to allow people to like mint, die with other collateral types that are important people use. Like, you might have a very strong opinion about USDC, but let me break it, folks. It is the most widely used stable coin with tether. There's always a choice. That's the point that I'm trying to make.
01:03:45.422 - 01:04:26.530, Speaker A: The nice thing about crypto is there's always a choice what you use. But when it comes to protocol economics, I think, yeah, we're going to see more creativeness and how this yield is being passed through over to users. And we made a lot, there was a lot of mistakes were made in Defi summer. Again, it was a lot of yield, farming activity. But you're depositing a protocol, it's not delivering a product well. That yield is really not sustainable. So you always have to think about that, right? Like Treasuries 5%, is that sustainable? Interest expense for the US government is going to amount to 20% of GDP.
01:04:26.530 - 01:04:33.074, Speaker A: Is that sustainable? Like, I mean, we can go on this path and again, it's like turtles all the way fucking down, you know?
01:04:33.194 - 01:05:05.000, Speaker B: Yeah. I have one more question on blast. It'll be fun to see how this plays out. And I'm excited to chat with Pac man on the podcast. What is it about paradigm that I feel like a lot of these experiments on the fringes, whether it's blast or friend tech, a lot of these, I think they did blur. What is it about paradigm that enables them to. Why are they behind what feels like most of these type of things in crypto? From what you know about paradigm, we should have Matt and Fred and stuff on the pod.
01:05:05.000 - 01:05:07.912, Speaker B: But what is it about them? From maybe having worked with them over.
01:05:07.928 - 01:05:34.038, Speaker A: The years, I think they're the best stacked team in crypto, like a funding. So, yeah, like, like, the proof isn't like, look at what they did with uniswap. I think I was. I always thought that they were my biggest competitor when I was a paraphy. Now I like to invest with them, but as, when you're like, of course Matt takes a sequoia playbook and a lot of these rounds, like, he just cuts everyone out.
01:05:34.046 - 01:05:34.250, Speaker B: Right.
01:05:34.302 - 01:05:35.882, Speaker A: It's like them and no one else.
01:05:36.018 - 01:05:39.162, Speaker B: Yeah, he won't last. Other, other folks involved, like, standard in.
01:05:39.178 - 01:05:57.690, Speaker A: This case was an interesting one because I. That was my biggest objection. I love what they do. I have immense respect. Like, when you see the work that Georgios and Sam, which I wanted to hire a pair. Like, they have Sam, they have Georgios, they have Dan, like, and a bunch of. I've spoken with another guy called Aaron.
01:05:57.690 - 01:06:41.758, Speaker A: Like, they, they have. When people think about, like, if you're a founder and the amount of resources that you're going to get, I think they have the best, the best, most diversified, competent, like, researchers. And they may not be an a 16 z that has like a hundred, like, team of operating and pr and all that, but I think when it comes to, like, really, really like, getting deep into helping a project design crypto economic incentives protocol design and research and security, it's just like they have Sam. Like, that's it. Like, that's your secret nuclear, like weapon. There's no better person in the ecosystem than Sam. Like, he's.
01:06:41.758 - 01:06:53.332, Speaker A: He's God. Like, he detects every bug. And so that alone, like, is just a reason why you would pick paradigm over anyone else. Candidly, if I. If I'm a founder, I would take their money over anyone else.
01:06:53.518 - 01:06:56.364, Speaker B: Who would be. Who are the second and third best, in your opinion?
01:06:56.784 - 01:07:08.776, Speaker A: Well, you know I'm biased, but outside of parafy. Well, it depends what type of protocol you are, right? I think. I think some funds are.
01:07:08.840 - 01:07:09.296, Speaker B: Good point.
01:07:09.360 - 01:07:21.594, Speaker A: Like, like paraphrasing super. Like if you're defi your d five. Yeah, but there's other great funds. Like if you're in Asia. Like obviously, you know, Dragonfly and Foley is. Foley's is an exceptional work. Like step in and scroll.
01:07:21.594 - 01:07:41.330, Speaker A: And I think they're really plugged in. They do great research and really help their portfolio companies. But it depends on the stage, too. It's such a difficult question. Right. But, like, categorically I have an immense respect for paradigm because they've contributed a lot to the space. No, people may not like them.
01:07:41.330 - 01:08:14.318, Speaker A: They might think that they're making investments. They are questionable. I'll just say, like, I'll just remind people because, you know, a lot of people think it's like, oh, you know, like, this is just, you know, a lot of people had very visceral and have very visceral reactions, especially when they don't participate in rounds and when they have and when they come, like, when a new company comes in and is perhaps challenging the value of their bags. Look, it's okay. It's a normal reaction. I get it. But I would encourage people to take time to learn.
01:08:14.318 - 01:08:25.390, Speaker A: And also, like, I'm just gonna say solana for a long time was not very, not very popular. People very critical of it, and this.
01:08:25.422 - 01:08:29.318, Speaker B: Was, like, not even crypto tend to do.
01:08:29.366 - 01:08:47.321, Speaker A: Yeah, that's what I'm saying. And now, of course, Solana is, like, all the rage, and for rightfully so. Like, there's just a lot of stuff that had you been paying attention, you know, you would have liked the team. You would have liked what they're doing. And I think the most important thing is, like, focus on founders and the team and their intent to build.
01:08:47.457 - 01:08:47.865, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:08:47.929 - 01:09:16.716, Speaker A: And how long they've been here. Like, God, I mean, the Solana team has been kicked in the nuts, like, time and time again, but they keep come back, they keep improving the protocol. Like, I look at that, and I have an immense respect for, for these builders because building as Kane and every other builder that's been that I've heard it from a lot of them. It's just like, it's super difficult to build, especially in bear markets. Like, you get crucified always, constantly, things go right. People like, obviously that's your job. People go like.
01:09:16.716 - 01:09:34.804, Speaker A: But. But even when things are going right, people, like, have opinions of, like, oh, you know, all of a sudden this community model, like, folks. Not. Because just because you have a token doesn't mean you can all of a sudden barge into board meetings or whatever. Or like, you know, like, no, absolutely not. Stay away.
01:09:35.744 - 01:10:02.828, Speaker B: All right, last piece of news from this week that I think is about computers about to die. There was pith, but we'll have Mike on from pith to talk about pith, so we can do a separate part on that. Kraken got sued by the SEC, but Binance was the bigger news. Coindesk got acquired. So Coindesk and I actually just. I'm so biased about this. That I'd love to hear your take on if I'm overreacting or not, but the reason I posted this Twitter thread about it, let me give the story.
01:10:02.828 - 01:10:56.262, Speaker B: So basically, when DCG had problems with their balance sheet because of Genesis, Barry put a couple of DCG owned companies on the market, and one of them was Coindesk. And they ended up. So in July, they had an acquisition or a deal with this guy, Matt Rosak to buy the company for 125 million. As the market stayed flat and actually fell in the end of the summer and early fall, Rozak pulled out and that deal went back on the market and this company, bullish, ended up just buying them. It got announced this week, on Monday that this company, bullish, is buying coindesk. I posted this Twitter thread, which was not classy, I would say, but I just wanted to call out my thoughts on it. I think it's pretty bad.
01:10:56.318 - 01:10:57.434, Speaker A: Can you show it now?
01:10:57.934 - 01:11:16.622, Speaker B: Yeah, I'll just read it. I'll just reread it. I said the coindesk bullish acquisition is bad for the industry. First off, bullish is owned by block one. So for those who don't remember, block one created the EOS blockchain. It was supposed to be a faster ethereum. It was part of that original group of ETH competitors who raised during the IcO era.
01:11:16.622 - 01:11:24.586, Speaker B: And in May, I'm sure you remember this, auntie, in May 2018, EoS raised $4 billion in the largest ICO ever.
01:11:24.730 - 01:11:26.850, Speaker A: Theyre now one of the largest bitcoin.
01:11:26.882 - 01:11:37.498, Speaker B: Holders, by the way, they took that 4 billion, they let it ride in bitcoin. Theyre now one of the largest bitcoin holders in the world. They own more than microstrategy. And in July, what?
01:11:37.666 - 01:11:38.290, Speaker A: A lot more.
01:11:38.322 - 01:12:02.978, Speaker B: Yeah, they own more bitcoin than microstrategy. And in July 2021, so theyve been launching new companies. They bought a domain name for $30 million, actually from microstrategy and from Saylor called Voice.com, comma, put $150 million into that company, killed it. A year later, July 2021, block one launched a new crypto exchange called Bullish with 10 billion in funding. That is billion with a b.
01:12:03.026 - 01:12:03.722, Speaker A: With what?
01:12:03.858 - 01:12:34.270, Speaker B: Yep. Crypto exchange called Bullish with 10 billion in funding. It was backed by folks like Peter Thiel, Lewis Bacon, Richard Lee Novogratz, Christian angermeyer. And today, bullish announced that they're buying Coindesk. And the reason I think it's so for us, as blockworks, as someone who competes against them, amazing news for us. We love to see that. But as someone who loves crypto and genuinely believes that we need, like, now more than ever, we need unbiased media to move the industry forward in a responsible way.
01:12:34.270 - 01:13:03.324, Speaker B: This is not good. This is no different than binance buying Coindesk or Nasdaq buying the Wall Street Journal or Blackrock buying Bloomberg. It crushes, I think, the editorial integrity of the brand. And the reason this kind of hit a. I don't know, hit a nerve with me was this comes a couple days after foresight ventures, who owns Bitget, also another crypto exchange, bought the block. And I would consider 80% of the block. Bought 80% of the block.
01:13:03.324 - 01:13:22.624, Speaker B: Consider the. If you look like the three, I think the three best media companies today in crypto are probably coindesky. Block works in the block. I would put those as, like, the kind of trifecta of crypto media. And it's a bummer to have two of those three owned by crypto exchanges.
01:13:24.084 - 01:14:17.620, Speaker A: I hear you loud and clear. Now, let me ask you a question. We've also seen a host of billionaires like Jeff Pazers of the world go out and buy, like, the Washington Post. I think he bought, like, look, there's a reason you could try to, you know, when people buy, you know, news outlets, or obviously presents a conflict of interest, because Bezos has an interest, like, the people that are behind it in the board, obviously have stakes in companies, they have interests in other things. In this case, I think your point is a very good one, which is obviously, there's bias, but there's always bias. It's how much bias is too much bias. And do you have the proper controls in place to preserve the integrity of the journalists that are reporting? And how involved are you in what gets pushed and what.
01:14:17.620 - 01:14:37.132, Speaker A: What makes a story and what doesn't make a story? I think that's the issue. That was the issue with block. Right? The block. One of the former, I think, was a president that got ousted, was CEO. He took loans from SBF, and, well, he didn't disclose that. And I think it's a matter of just proper disclosure of conflict of interest. Like, look, you've done.
01:14:37.132 - 01:14:52.468, Speaker A: It's like I'm in this podcast. I have an opinion on things. I have a lot of investments in the space. It's no surprise. I mean, I talk. When I talk about Coinbase, I'm long coin. When I'm talking about blur and blast, I have exposure to that.
01:14:52.468 - 01:15:28.964, Speaker A: Of course, it would be stupid and disingenuous for me. One, to not disclose it, and two, to not appreciate that. Like, it's not going to influence my opinion, and I hope listeners appreciate that. I think when it comes to, like, I'm just a guy that sits on a chair to talk about and ramble on shit, it's different if, like, I don't own. I'm an investor in blockworks, too, but it's a very minor stake. I don't go to you and say, hey, you need to publish this now. Like, but, like, what's the worst case scenario in your mind? Like, they just skew.
01:15:28.964 - 01:15:38.080, Speaker A: They all of a sudden now start, like, pumping Eos bags and I don't know, like, what's. What's the issue? Because what I'm saying is there's always a right.
01:15:38.112 - 01:15:49.034, Speaker B: Billionaires, like, billionaires buying billionaires buying companies. Is that right? John Henry, the Boston Globe, Bezos, the Post. Glenn Taylor.
01:15:49.074 - 01:15:49.226, Speaker A: Right.
01:15:49.250 - 01:15:59.814, Speaker B: The Star Tribune, the Sheldon Adelson, the Las Vegas. He bought the Las Vegas review secretly after they were covering him negatively, and he bought it. Like, the list goes on and on. Mark Benioff, time.
01:16:00.234 - 01:16:01.774, Speaker A: Musk buys Twitter.
01:16:02.434 - 01:16:26.090, Speaker B: The thai billionaire guy shot. I don't know how you pronounce his name, but he bought fortune. Like, the list goes on and on. The difference there, I think, is that they're not buying companies in industries where they necessarily operate. So it's different to buy someone like the Wall Street Journal or maybe the New York Times or something where you're covering everything. We are b. Two b media companies.
01:16:26.090 - 01:17:24.864, Speaker B: We are like, trade publications, essentially, where the only thing that we do is cover crypto. So every single day, coindesk is either making a decision to cover bullish or not to cover them, and they're making a decision to on how to cover any crypto exchange, which are all bullish as competitors. So I think Barry did a phenomenal job with this. Barry actually did well early on, maybe not as much, but in the last couple of years, Barry did a great job with Coindesk. They had very good ethics and policies and real church and state, and he genuinely believed that good media is good for the industry, and what's good for the industry ends up improving his company. I don't see this as that type of acquisition. I don't think the Brendan bloomer of eos is like, what's good for media is good for the industry, and what's good for the industry is good for block one.
01:17:24.864 - 01:17:27.976, Speaker B: Like, this feels like a. Yeah, absolutely.
01:17:28.000 - 01:17:32.776, Speaker A: No, I hear your point. I'm just kind of like. I'm raising a point where I'm as.
01:17:32.800 - 01:17:35.732, Speaker B: Biased as you can get with this. I actually wanted to hear opinion.
01:17:35.828 - 01:18:26.364, Speaker A: No, like, I think it's a very valid concern. I think, look, at the end of the day, you have to think about, okay, the aggregate purchase price of this is probably de minimis relative to their bitcoin holdings. And so the question is, you know, if you're a venture fund investing in and buying a controlling stake in a media publication, are you going to lit money on fire? Because at the end of the day, like if you're reporting really poorly, I think the chance, like your investments can probably go to zero in the long term. Right. If you're a shitty media, you know what I mean? Like if you're comp, if your integrity is compromised, if you're so biased, like people gonna wake up to that and, and I think you're just gonna dominate. It's, it's maybe a great position for you guys to just plow ahead and be the most independent. Um, you know, there's always some bias, but independent media outlet for crypto and then you just win that game.
01:18:26.364 - 01:19:17.206, Speaker A: Because I'm a big believer at the end of the day, truth prevails and people appreciate good editorial content. Like, it is obviously more sensitive. Like the ability to influence narratives is probably easier in crypto, of course, because it's an emerging asset class. We're also, by the way, facing challenges when the New York Times and traditional media also carry narrative and portray this industry to make headlines that time and time again. They've obviously not betrayed him a more, in the most favorable way. Right? Like over the last twelve months, like over the history of crypto, it's always been the negative headlines that negative headlines sell more than positive headlines. And that's always been the more like demoralizing piece of media because the monetization model is clicks and views and like that just sucks.
01:19:17.206 - 01:19:57.240, Speaker A: Right. And I think this is why when I, when I interviewed you and Maple Mike with Vance, I think it was Vance or Michael, it was really this opportunity. I think that you guys have to embed a lot of like a different modernization model where you don't have to rely on clicks and sensationalism to make a living. Like, and to make it a profitable enterprise. I think you can really embed nfts. You can have greater ownership. You can, like there's just a lot of things that with micro payments I think you can roll out more interesting creative subscription models.
01:19:57.240 - 01:20:32.910, Speaker A: I don't know. Right. But yeah, yeah, that was my, I think that's the opportunity you guys have. And if all of these new, if the block and coindesk are going to fade into irrelevance because they don't have proper independence, as you say, between the board and the owners and the journalists, that's going to show up and they're going to go to zero, because over time, these things take care of themselves. You don't have to do anything. Like, if they're so willing to become a very biased media outlet, well, guess what? I'm not going to read it. And then over time, people are not going to read it.
01:20:32.910 - 01:21:07.692, Speaker A: Right? So they're just their market share and their mind share in the space goes to zero. I think the real problem is the New York Times of the world. That I think is a bigger problem, especially at a time where you're going to have an ETF approval. You know, Bloomberg has a segment every day in our segment of Bloomberg crypto that may or may not continue to exist, but that's just been incredible to see. Right? I mean, what I'm trying to say is there's growing interest for people to learn about this space. It's the only reason why I show up and sit on this chair, because I was just frustrated with people, the pops of the world. It's just like, God damn it.
01:21:07.692 - 01:21:32.464, Speaker A: If that's your first interaction in this space, like, no wonder we haven't gotten mainstream adoption. I don't care how good the product is. If people come in here and the first thing that you see are pop up ads and buy this, like, token. Like, no. Like, no, let's. Let's approach this from first principles and have an honest discussion and a balanced one. Like, we tend to over promise.
01:21:32.464 - 01:21:59.406, Speaker A: Like, guys, like, tone it down a bit. Like, this tech is really good. Like, we're here, we're bags are packed, our net worth is tied. That's a, that's like, we're putting ourselves in line, but that doesn't give you, like, I think it's not a good strategy to go out and say and sell you and pump your bags. Like, no, like, let's. Yeah, be objective and police ourselves and look, I think this is, again, just to tie it out. When I see the Coinbase team and their discussion and the way that, like, Brian goes on tv, that's.
01:21:59.406 - 01:22:39.154, Speaker A: I think that's a good, like, if I were to pick a marketing person for our industry, like, it's not sailor, it's probably someone like Brian. He's not perfect, but, you know, this is closer to someone that just like, so anyways, I think it's encouraging for you guys. It's motivating for me because, yeah. Like, the challenge is I think everyone here, if you have an audience, no matter how big, I think you have a responsibility to stay balanced and vigilant and push, like, as pristine of education as you can raise awareness. Yeah. Everyone has a bias. I have a bias, of course, on my portfolio.
01:22:39.154 - 01:22:39.898, Speaker A: Of course.
01:22:40.026 - 01:22:40.706, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:22:40.850 - 01:22:49.330, Speaker A: It's impossible to eliminate. Like, this is who we are. It's just by nature being an investor, but, you know. Yeah. Good.
01:22:49.362 - 01:22:52.642, Speaker B: Podman. My computer's on 2%, so I'm. Is it?
01:22:52.698 - 01:23:06.476, Speaker A: All right, well, that. Does that mean that you're going to shut down for the rest of Thanksgiving anyways? Super. Thank you. If you celebrate Thanksgiving, I think it's the best holiday. It's my favorite holiday. I'll be celebrating. I sure as know Yano and our producer is also gonna do it.
01:23:06.476 - 01:23:20.264, Speaker A: So anyways, for everyone that's been listening, thank you for listening. It's very encouraging when we hear the good and the bad, what people like and don't like. So really, thank you, everyone. It's one of the more fun things that I do like.
01:23:20.564 - 01:23:40.158, Speaker B: Enjoy your thanksgiving, folks. See you next week. Right, everyone, thank you so much for watching today's episode. Really hope you enjoyed it.
