00:00:00.360 - 00:00:19.998, Speaker A: Someone asked me, like, why don't I hold much bitcoin is because what do you need to believe for bitcoin to grow ten x in value? Basically establish the same market cap as gold. And gold took hundreds of years to ossify as a store of value as social consensus. I don't necessarily believe that, like, in order for bitcoin to do a ten x, think about the amount what that, like, what do you need to believe for that to happen?
00:00:20.126 - 00:00:42.446, Speaker B: All right, everyone, so on Empire, you obviously know that we talk a lot about the institutions coming into crypto, and that is why we are super excited to share that. We are hosting the digital asset summit. We've hosted this since 2019. It's coming up in London, March 18 to 20th. Don't miss your chance to get ahead of the curve. You can get 20% off with code Empire 20. We'll see you in London.
00:00:42.446 - 00:01:26.864, Speaker B: This episode is brought to you by the Chronicle Protocol, a cost efficient, transparent, and decentralized Oracle. Chronicle has developed a next generation oracle primitive called Scribe, which reduces oracle gas fees on l one's and l two s by over 60%. You'll hear more about chronicle later in the show. This episode is brought to you by Northstake, the secure and compliant staking platform for institutional investors. Northstake's ETH staking service lets institutions earn staking rewards while maintaining maximum flexibility on all of their capital. You can learn more about Northstake's institutional staking services by clicking the link in the show notes or that QR code that is on your screen right now. If you're on YouTube now, let's get into the show.
00:01:29.304 - 00:01:39.444, Speaker A: I use Soundcloud for Discovery, though. Soundcloud is just fire. I love these tracks for, like an hour. An hour, 30 mashups or just like, ultra sets.
00:01:39.984 - 00:01:44.696, Speaker B: I'm gonna. This is gonna be super cringe. I know we already hit record, but I'll just say it anyways.
00:01:44.760 - 00:01:47.240, Speaker A: You're normally the cringe person, and you're. We have.
00:01:47.272 - 00:01:51.072, Speaker B: I read the YouTube comments. I know I'm cringe. I've accepted it. Are you in there?
00:01:51.248 - 00:01:57.786, Speaker A: Have you, by the way, have you also seen that I have more followers now? No way. What, you.
00:01:57.810 - 00:01:59.414, Speaker B: You bought you buy some bots again?
00:02:00.674 - 00:02:11.978, Speaker A: I'm poor. And second, no, no. I've been tweeting a lot about Solana stuff, which actually, I do want to go deep. I've been going very deep, look. But yes, I think I've gained a.
00:02:11.986 - 00:02:23.606, Speaker B: Lot of followers before Solana, so we have. So Solana rap. Just Solana rap. Spotify raptors came out. Oh, my God. And we had a bunch of people who had. Who had empires, their top, top pod.
00:02:23.606 - 00:02:32.954, Speaker B: So appreciate all you guys. If anyone comes to permissionless or Das and empire was a top. You were a top 1% listener. We'll give you some free merch.
00:02:33.934 - 00:02:45.246, Speaker A: And, folks, for context, I haven't even gotten any merch. Like, I'm an investor in blockwork, and I've been sitting in this goddamn chair since. I hear.
00:02:45.270 - 00:02:50.390, Speaker B: So this is, uh, blockworks does not have much merch. Not because we're like, you know, says.
00:02:50.422 - 00:02:52.614, Speaker A: The guy that has, like, block works.
00:02:52.654 - 00:03:08.294, Speaker B: Dude, I made this and paid for this with my own money. This hat I bought with my own money, not the company card, because we were. We bootstrapped for the first five and a half years. We were so cheap that we didn't even get t shirts with the blockworks logo printed on it for five years into the company.
00:03:08.374 - 00:03:22.900, Speaker A: I respect that. You know, I'm very. I'm very bearish. Like, you could have shorted every single crypto company, that it was a premier sponsor in consensus, and they would have gone to zero. Like, it would have been a great trade. Like, companies just not spend in merch. Like, just.
00:03:22.900 - 00:03:23.228, Speaker A: No.
00:03:23.276 - 00:03:23.692, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:03:23.788 - 00:03:24.612, Speaker A: Hire another.
00:03:24.788 - 00:03:27.144, Speaker B: Pull up your Spotify wrapped. Let's see what you got.
00:03:27.804 - 00:03:34.224, Speaker A: Well, I want to see the podcast section, which I haven't been able to find. This is how technologically incompetent I am, I guess.
00:03:34.604 - 00:03:37.624, Speaker B: Definitely gonna be the worst roundup we record all year, but that's okay.
00:03:38.084 - 00:03:49.626, Speaker A: Maybe not, man. I don't think people want to. We riff a lot about crypto, but there's other things interesting in life that are not crypto. Like, my life is very much crypto, but I listen to a lot of.
00:03:49.650 - 00:03:52.854, Speaker B: Jay Z this year. Interesting. Jay Z was number four.
00:03:53.434 - 00:04:01.114, Speaker A: I got diplo, Morgan wall, and heartless. Great song. I'm a country guy, man. You know, I had, like, tents. Oh, yeah. Big time. Big time.
00:04:01.114 - 00:04:14.816, Speaker A: I love country. Like, I love eat. I love Edm, like, traditional house music. Aviciis of the world. Um, and I also love, uh, to straight up country.
00:04:14.920 - 00:04:16.176, Speaker B: Well, Zach Bryan.
00:04:16.360 - 00:04:20.384, Speaker A: Oh, come. Oh, yeah, my top pods. I listen. I listen to.
00:04:20.424 - 00:04:28.528, Speaker B: I want to invest, like, the best after not listening to invest, like, the best for a couple of years. Founders pod. Oh, man, my stuff is so basic. I'm sorry.
00:04:28.536 - 00:04:32.084, Speaker A: I got some taste rift. I've got some taste rift. I like taste.
00:04:32.464 - 00:04:35.720, Speaker B: All right, I can't share this, actually. Mine are too minor.
00:04:35.752 - 00:05:00.608, Speaker A: Too basic. Well, like, it's like nfts, man. You know what makes it? You know what it is? I hate when people are very opinionated with your. You know, when someone asks the question, it's like, what do you like? It's like, oh, you like, you like house? Okay, so what do you like house? And you just know the guy on the other end is gonna totally bash you and say that you're a basic bitch because you listen to Avicii. And. I'm sorry. I just like to listen to whatever music.
00:05:00.696 - 00:05:14.032, Speaker B: Yeah. Makes me feel good on my top five, which I know I'll get a lot of shit, which, you know what? No, but I respect the hours of. If I need to crank, I'm drinking an espresso at 08:00 p.m. I'm putting on my big headphones, and I'm listening to a Tesla set from, like, 10:00 p.m. Till 01:00 a.m. And.
00:05:14.048 - 00:05:21.928, Speaker A: Just cranking out some work. You know how I survived defi summer where I was not sleeping? Just yield farming.
00:05:22.016 - 00:05:22.684, Speaker B: Oh.
00:05:23.144 - 00:05:33.224, Speaker A: Just listening to house music with these same headphones. This mashup, like Avicii Ultra remix. The last one he did ten times in a day.
00:05:33.264 - 00:05:35.416, Speaker B: Like maniac 2015. Yeah.
00:05:35.480 - 00:05:44.482, Speaker A: Like, I know you can tell me what's. What's minute four of this. Hour 30, I have that, Martin. I'm like, oh, brother.
00:05:44.578 - 00:05:46.714, Speaker B: Minute 26, usher comes on.
00:05:46.754 - 00:05:58.378, Speaker A: I'm like, that's great. And, you know, the best part now is Spotify is this dj function, which I'm not, like, 100% sold on. Honestly, sometimes I'm, like, really mad at this.
00:05:58.466 - 00:05:59.738, Speaker B: I don't like it that much.
00:05:59.906 - 00:06:10.236, Speaker A: No. Like what? No, no. Really bad selection. But every once in a while, the shuffle works every so often. And that song that you haven't listened.
00:06:10.300 - 00:06:11.464, Speaker B: Up out of your chair.
00:06:13.444 - 00:06:33.808, Speaker A: There'S that song that always comes back, and it happens, like, once a week. Right? I'd be, like, in a wrong in a long run or a long cycle or, like, driving or on a plane. You're going through this, and I'm in this phase now where I'm stuck. I don't have good music, and I'm dreading it because I'm hopping on a 24 hours flight.
00:06:33.936 - 00:06:38.264, Speaker B: Dude, you got to get in. You got to get in this telegram, chat, crypto, edm jams.
00:06:38.344 - 00:06:40.240, Speaker A: This is Tommy's. No, no, this is.
00:06:40.312 - 00:06:44.120, Speaker B: Yeah. Tom Shaughnessy and I think Ben Sparango from.
00:06:44.272 - 00:06:49.924, Speaker A: Yeah, I love those two guys. One of my favorite people in the space by the way, for different reasons.
00:06:50.344 - 00:06:53.096, Speaker B: Tommy started this group in like 2017 or 28.
00:06:53.160 - 00:07:07.928, Speaker A: I'm part of the group now. Oh, yeah, listen, I went, I went on Tommy's podcast twice or three times, and every time he had mentioned this group and would never add me until the third, I publicly called him out on it and he added me. That was the only reason why.
00:07:07.976 - 00:07:22.176, Speaker B: Very selective. He's added people and then he's. But he's, he's captain at 200 the whole time. If he adds someone, he has to chop someone. So interesting. That's my good, my source of music. Did we another big w for the Empire pod this week? We.
00:07:22.176 - 00:07:35.472, Speaker B: So we. So Das has these, these promo codes like Empire 20 and stuff. When we did a blackrock one, Empire was fifth of all the blockworks pods. We're now second. So we've, we've left to number two. I'm hoping we're still not happy, by.
00:07:35.488 - 00:07:37.560, Speaker A: The way, I only take one.
00:07:37.632 - 00:07:52.524, Speaker B: Number one, we're not happy, but give it a couple. People need to use the code Empire 20 for Das. And, yeah, we'll leave to number one. I'm confident we need to give Mike and Mark Usko, like, a glimmer of hope that they can beat us. And then we'll skyrocket.
00:07:53.574 - 00:07:57.374, Speaker A: Yeah, we'll make him feel like it's a competition, but it's really not exactly.
00:07:57.534 - 00:08:13.074, Speaker B: So you just got off this twitter spaces. So Empire just did our first ever live stream. That was fun. I tuned into the end of it. I was on Amtrak, so I can actually partake. But it was with Nick from Celestia, with the CTO of aptos.
00:08:13.934 - 00:08:14.902, Speaker A: Avery Chan.
00:08:15.038 - 00:08:19.238, Speaker B: Yeah, it was with movement labs from movement lab.
00:08:19.286 - 00:09:01.836, Speaker A: No, really, really great. Look, I think the most important discussion that is happening in crypto right now, perhaps the most relevant, is this idea of modular versus monolithic. And I think it's, we're going to look back on this moment of infrastructure development in crypto and say this was probably very comparable to what happened after the.com crash. And the software as a service movement. This, like, technological phases go through this bundling and unbundling, and there's a lot of creativity, expression that happens in this unbundling phase. And then, and then you have a rebundling, um, which is something that I asked towards the end.
00:09:01.836 - 00:09:11.212, Speaker A: And it was interesting to get their perspective. But, yeah, basically you're. I mean, we don't have to go into the full details here. People should go listen to a lot of this great podcast is.
00:09:11.348 - 00:09:17.154, Speaker B: Well, can you kind of can you kind of summarize it? What were you guys talking about? Any, any takeaways make you think differently in any way?
00:09:17.324 - 00:10:04.842, Speaker A: Well, so for context, Aptos is this kind of next gen layer one that a lot of the work that had been done in Facebook Libra, they took it. They're using this move programming language, parallel execution. There's like, basically like higher performance layer one. And the way I think of it, and I'm an investor in Aptos, full disclosure is move as a programming language is like. Is really superior in the sense that I focus on is it's just more secure. Like, you would avoid every reentrancy attack in DeFi because with move, and that's huge, right? Because we keep, like, Kyber swap just happened, and it was like, incredible how sophisticated these attackers are, finding these bugs. And solidity is not the perfect language.
00:10:04.842 - 00:10:47.070, Speaker A: I don't think it will be the de facto language. And the standard much farther down the line, it just has a benefit of network effects or whatever. But that's interesting. So we had him talking about, look, it's obviously like an integrated blockchain. It has some modular pieces to it, which I didn't fully appreciate. So he was on, and then we had Ruchi on basically rushy for movement labs. What they're doing is they're taking, say that you're an app in, you're a, you develop, you have a Defi protocol in Aptos, which still obviously is relatively new, and you don't have as many users with liquidity.
00:10:47.070 - 00:11:44.234, Speaker A: So what does movement do? Movement says, hey, if you're a protocol that has already deployed and has a move like on Aptos, then you can use our vm to then connect to Ethereum, which is pretty cool, right? Because ultimately you want to tap into the liquidity. You want to tap into those users. And so it allows for that, which is pretty cool. And there's a whole. And why Celestia is relevant in all of that is because obviously, when you're launching this kind of l two, Celestia allows you to, in this modular framework, allows you to outsource data availability and consensus, which, the way I think of it, is blockchain. Running blockchains is very expensive, or it has three major cost components. One is hardware requirements, which, you know, Solana, for instance, is higher.
00:11:44.234 - 00:12:17.238, Speaker A: Like, running a Solana node costs $3,000 of hardware, give or take. Like an Alienware, like a very sophisticated computer with some GPU, whatever. Solana. Like Ethereum? No, like, it's $200 except raspberry PI or whatever. So it's hardware bandwidth, because obviously you're, you're piping through a bunch of data, right, in every block. So that requires like fiber optic connectivity. And that has a cost, right? It's price per unit of data that gets transacted, right, when you pay for Internet.
00:12:17.238 - 00:13:51.426, Speaker A: And then the third component of all that is storage costs. Like at some point you're gonna these the state and synchronizing the state and these blockchains as they grow and propagate, right? And these, you know, it's ever expanding, right? And so scalability is always at the heart of that. And what celestial has come in and done is says, hey, we're going to specialize in data availability and consensus and what data availability. They just pioneered this thing called data availability sampling, which scales sub linearly. So basically, like, instead of every node having to basically to reach consensus and settle, you need to make sure that all the transactions in a block are correct and you don't have a double spend, right? You don't have, even in a parallel execution environment, you don't have transactions that may be conflicting, right? Because you may have a same type of smart contract calling one thing in the double spend thing, but then you have a higher fee. And the transaction that has a higher fee priority, like gets prioritized and gets included in the blockchain in a parallel execution environment. And so celestial for context, the data sampling is instead of every node to reach consensus, you got to make sure, well, that the data in the block is actually correct, it's ordered correctly and doesn't have these double span things, they allow you to, instead of having every node having to inspect and look at all of the data in the block, you're just sampling a small amount and probabilistically say no, the data in that block is correct.
00:13:51.426 - 00:14:31.594, Speaker A: We can reach consensus in a much cost effective manner. And that's pretty huge, right? Because in Ethereum, even in l two s, like, if you don't have this data availability sampling, it's pretty expensive. Like, you can think of it like it's, you know, if you increase the block size, well, there's more data in the block. And so it becomes one of these, like, pretty big unlocks in my mind. For context, I was talking to a team that I'm an investor in. They're going to launch their own l two, and we have hundreds now, maybe thousands of l two s. There's no stop in sight.
00:14:31.594 - 00:15:09.894, Speaker A: And the cost, ultimately, if you're not using celestia, you have to pay for that. You have to pay for those data costs that you need to send back to the l one. ETH l one. For every batching of transactions that happens, you ultimately just settle it and send it to the ETH L1 that has a cost which is pretty high. So, for instance, I asked Nick from Celestia, who's a CoO. So, like, what does that translate into? Cost savings. If you're a team that wants to launch your own l two, like, you're a gaming project, you want to launch your own l two.
00:15:09.894 - 00:15:39.054, Speaker A: And he didn't have like a finance or. He said they were going to publish this data. But for context, this project that I was talking to said it would have cost us like $100,000 to do it ourselves by us having to do data availability and, you know, in house. If we outsource it to Celestia, it's $1,000. So you go from 100,000 to 1000. That's huge. Like, that's multiple two orders of magnitude, right? Cost improvements.
00:15:39.054 - 00:16:10.310, Speaker A: So anyways, the TLDR of all this is a very interesting discussion. Why? Because movement, I think, will be very interesting to see which type of aptos projects or new projects that are building on Aptos, because candidly, move is a better programming language. I'm sorry, I'm not a developer, I have no business in commenting, but I care about the hacks that are happening in Defi. And so if you tell me that a programming language is formally verified and would prevent every single most of reentrancy attacks, I'm like, yes, on board.
00:16:10.422 - 00:16:27.178, Speaker B: Because I was telling you about nine months ago, I had dinner with the founder of one of the biggest custodians in the space, and he came from web two as well. And he's like, look, I think it's general consensus that move is the best programming language. It's just, it just doesn't have the kind of narrative among crypto natives right now.
00:16:27.266 - 00:16:29.850, Speaker A: Right. And I think that's where movement becomes so important.
00:16:29.962 - 00:16:30.378, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:16:30.466 - 00:17:17.900, Speaker A: Because how you build network effects and interest in a chain. Well, I think this is a very interesting hybrid solution that allows you to leverage all the benefits of move as a programming language and all the liquidity user mind share that exists in Ethereum. So towards Dan, I asked, do you think you were going to see a rebundling? Like, it's sort of like a vampire type on Ethereum, right, where like, you make it easy to deploy move on a vm, like a move based, like, program on a vm. And so you all of a sudden, like, tap into all that, you know, and so is that a vampire attack? Like, how do you see this? I don't think it's a. I actually would be curious to get your opinion on, on this whole discussion of modular versus monolithic slash integrated, some people call it.
00:17:17.932 - 00:17:48.218, Speaker B: Yeah, I can, I mean, I can share. I had this call. I'll tie this story together with your question. So I had a call with a guy who built big events and media business and actually the eighties around the Internet, and this was in the eighties, even pre netscape, pre browsers going mainstream in the early to mid nineties. This was in the eighties. And I was explaining to him this big debate that's happening in crypto, which we're talking about right now, monolithic versus modular. And he goes, oh, my God.
00:17:48.218 - 00:18:13.334, Speaker B: That's what you're talking about is protocol layering versus integrated designs. And I was like, okay, what do you mean? He goes, in the early Internet, there was this huge conversation, this big debate was regarding the design of network protocols and infrastructure. And the Internet today is obviously, is a modular approach. And if you haven't seen, have you ever seen the OSI model, open systems interconnection model?
00:18:14.064 - 00:18:17.472, Speaker A: This is sort of like history of computing in Palm.
00:18:17.568 - 00:18:26.544, Speaker B: Look at this guy. I'm sure a million people already know this, but I'm going to reveal my ignorance and share this with you. I hadn't heard of this before.
00:18:26.704 - 00:18:29.928, Speaker A: This is what we do at Empire, by the way. We reveal our ignorance.
00:18:30.056 - 00:18:51.992, Speaker B: Exactly. So what you're looking at, this is the Internet right here. So the Internet as we know it is broken into various networking functions in distinct layers. So you've got physical layer, data link layer, networking layer, transport layer. So for those who aren't actually watching, I can explain this. There's seven layers of the OSI model. At the bottom is the bits layer.
00:18:51.992 - 00:19:24.460, Speaker B: It's bits, it's the physical layer, it's fiber, it's wireless, it's hubs, it's the physical structure. Moving up one layer is the data link layer, which is, you move from bits to frames. This is Ethernet, you know, switch bridge, things like that. Then you get into packets, right? This is the networking layer. IP, ICMP, iPsec, igMp. This is like path determination and IP, like logical addressing. Then you go up another layer to segments, right? This is the transport layer.
00:19:24.460 - 00:19:44.328, Speaker B: This is like end to end connections and reliability, TCP, UDP. Then you go to the fifth layer, the session layer. This is when you get into what we would think of in crypto is like the data availability layer. Basically this is the first data layer, which is the inner host communication layer, APIs, sockets.
00:19:44.416 - 00:19:50.936, Speaker A: Winsock, would that be a layer zero or IBC?
00:19:51.080 - 00:20:16.820, Speaker B: Yeah, that's my understanding of it. Then you go up another layer, then the top three layers are basically data layers. So session, then presentation. Presentation is like how do you represent the data? It's the syntax layer, SsL, IMAP, mPEG, if you've ever seen like a JPeg file. Like JPEG, like that's a presentation layer. Yeah, exactly. This is nfts baby.
00:20:16.820 - 00:21:02.498, Speaker B: And then the top layer is the application layer. This is the network process to application, right? This is the end user layer and this is protocols like HTTP, SSH, DNS, FTP, IRC. This is the application layer, the most famous ones, obviously HTP. So I don't know, this is news to me that this thing exists. And I thought it was a really helpful framework to understand how the Internet works today. Basically each layer is responsible for specific tasks which allows for easier management, updating, troubleshooting, all these kind of things. But as this guy was explaining to me, there were all these very intense arguments back in the eighties in favor of more monolithic designs where these functions would be more tightly integrated.
00:21:02.498 - 00:21:22.178, Speaker B: And proponents of that argument argued that these are his words, not mine. It would lead to more efficient and easier to implement systems at the cost of flexibility and scalability. And man, here we are 40 years later and we're having the exact same conversations about protocols. I just love that framework. Loved hearing from this guy.
00:21:22.346 - 00:22:22.982, Speaker A: Well it's fascinating. One I unfortunately or fortunately wasn't around back then, but I've tried to go back and understand how the Internet happened. That is actually the title of one of my favorite books, is how the Internet happened. And it's just a amazing kind of archaeology of exactly what you're describing is how these movements came about and these discussions that were happening then that are so relevant, applicable to crypto. And so definitely I think where for instance during DEfcon before COVID in Osaka, the huge thing when l two s were being discussed very heavily was you're going to break composability. You would hear this idea of breaking composability. And I went to one of the, what I think is one of the smartest devs, he's super critical, like calls out bullshit, I love him.
00:22:22.982 - 00:23:25.074, Speaker A: And I said well is it like correct to think about composability as a binary thing of breaking it? Like either you have it or you don't. Or should we be more thinking about, is it a spectrum of the latency that you might have between these chains that, okay, it's not atomic, but can you introduce some sort of latency, at least today, before the infrastructure catches up, like IBC and stuff, where you accept some sort of spectrum? And I said, I got to think. The Internet went through this, where there's different standards, there's all these communication issues. And I said, my appreciation is that the Internet kind of went through these growing pains, and ultimately, they really solve that connectivity and the ordering, like, all these different things. Right? And he was like. I think he was, like, basically agreed on that premise. So maybe we should just have, like, 80 system engineer.
00:23:25.154 - 00:23:49.354, Speaker B: I mean, I'll bring. We should bring this. I mean, if you go back to this thing that struck me here, I'll pull this back up, is we talk about it in crypto. We talk about it is basically two ends of the spectrum. There's modular versus monolithic. And what this guy said is, he's like, well, what are the hybrid solutions? And he's like, the Internet became a hybrid solution. It was very modular at the beginning.
00:23:49.354 - 00:24:25.130, Speaker B: These seven layers won out, but then it became this hybrid system. So if you think about TCP IP, for example, that's an integrated protocol suite. These protocols are part of this layered architecture, which is actually more modular in design, but the entire stack isn't modular. Or, like cdns, content delivery networks, or this hybrid model, where you've got kind of decentralized distribution, which is a modular trait that's combined with centralized control and optimization, which is this kind of, like, monolithic trait. So. And he said one other one.
00:24:25.162 - 00:24:25.370, Speaker A: Oh.
00:24:25.402 - 00:24:34.800, Speaker B: SDN software defined networking. I don't honestly understand what that means, but he can come on and explain it to us. So there's a bunch of these example. It doesn't have to be modular. It doesn't have to be monolithic.
00:24:34.832 - 00:25:05.474, Speaker A: It can be. I don't think it's either or. Candidly, like, avery from the CTO of Aptos said something in this live stream that I want to dig deeper on, which is Aptos. You can think of it as a monolithic integrated. I think integrated becomes a better word, because I'll tell you why. He said, you can think of it as aptos, as a, like, ethereum, like monolithic, like Solana monolithic. But he said, there are things in our stack that make it modular, including Da.
00:25:05.474 - 00:25:18.714, Speaker A: And so I think there's, when he said that I. And I bring it back to what you just said, which is, I think, integrated. And I've heard other people advocate we probably should be using the word integrated.
00:25:19.094 - 00:25:19.686, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:25:19.790 - 00:26:35.492, Speaker A: Because within that integrate, it's really how you package it up, where at different points, the integration may be, and I may be saying something that is incredibly dumb, but I'll say it anyways, I think when the integration becomes very tight, you in many ways, become indistinguishable from something that is, what is modular, can become indistinguishable for something that is monolithic if the integration isn't incredibly tight or very close to the point where it doesn't matter. That's the thought that I had. It might be the dumbest shit that I say in the pod, and I may look at that, but I'll say it again. You understand what I'm saying? When you look at something that is modular, like a Rubik's cube, right? You're using ethereum for settlement and execution. You're using celestia for Da and consensus, and you're using whatever up top, you know, VM, you could use, like, whatever, like, you know, movement, SVM, like eclipse in a whole combination. So you have these permutations in the Rubik's cube. I think the state of which the modular movement is today is.
00:26:35.492 - 00:27:01.614, Speaker A: The Rubik's cube is very rough. It hasn't, like, it's just coming to be. You just put it together. It has no greasing of the bearings. And so it's like things are breaking. You don't have good ux. These things are not very well integrated yet, so you need a systems integrator to come and build the connectivity layer between and make that movement more tightly packaged.
00:27:01.614 - 00:27:25.982, Speaker A: And I think a lot of the innovation, as I think about where I want to spend my time to learn, look out, and invest in teams, is who is going to make this, like, I believe in modularity? Who's going to make the modular blockchains more tightly integrated? Because I think that's an area of opportunity. Does that make sense?
00:27:26.078 - 00:27:43.884, Speaker B: It makes sense. I mean, you could potentially argue that someone like something like a monad. Did you see, say, network? Do you see what, say, you had a big announcement today. We can look at it if you didn't see it, but something like, say, or like Monad are kind of sitting in between, are more like these hybrid models.
00:27:44.044 - 00:28:31.154, Speaker A: Sure. And maybe it's. Again, I'm saying this through analogies because that's how my left curve, lizard brain, non technical, tries to understand things through analogies. But it may be actually incorrect when you just say, look, Celestia integrates exceptionally well, like with a move based vm, and that integration just works really well. Maybe the challenge is just on the UX. That is very poor and crude at the moment, but I think, look, I got to think that the connectivity between chains is not perfect today. You have layer zero, you have chain link, you have messaging between chains.
00:28:31.154 - 00:29:38.604, Speaker A: But I would posit that that will become more important and an area of innovation in perhaps the same way that the Internet had to go through, like to make as close to, as we know, composability in a monolithic context, in a modular, like in a multi chain world. And you're connecting stuff like the way things interact and work in concert, I think probably will become much, much more fluid and better over time. A theory, again, I may be wrong, I need to do way more work, but maybe this is a good transition into like, my updated views on Solana and Ethereum. Because I've had a lot of. I've spent a lot of time listening to other podcasts. I spent a lot of time also talking to builders and other investors of how they think about. Obviously a lot of allocators are now thinking about the relative ratio between ETH and Sol and maybe Sol and next gen l one s.
00:29:38.604 - 00:30:28.566, Speaker A: So I think this whole modular and monolithic debate is also sparking some pretty interesting discussion around what is the roadmap of Ethereum. Vitalik had a good post this week. What is the end state for l two s? Why would you build on Solana versus Ethereum versus aptos? What really is the moat here? And I don't want to fod or. I think a lot of these, it's a multi chain world. Different use cases are just going to require different type of, I think, execution like environment. But God, I think that. I think a lot of people are.
00:30:28.566 - 00:30:52.646, Speaker A: I think there's a huge awakening happening and it is everything on a relative basis. If 90% of your investments happened 90 plus in Ethereum, I think the biggest shift that you're going to see is it's probably not going to be 90 going forward. Yeah. Not for new funds, emerging managers, and certainly not for more established funds. Yeah.
00:30:52.670 - 00:30:57.446, Speaker B: I mean, the hottest deals right now are in Solana and six, I've done.
00:30:57.510 - 00:31:13.042, Speaker A: Eight deals in the last two, three weeks, committed and funded. None of them are on. One of them is on. No. Maybe one is on a theory, I guess, like if you count, would you.
00:31:13.058 - 00:31:14.974, Speaker B: Count something like movement being.
00:31:16.154 - 00:31:18.706, Speaker A: That's why I was like, so what?
00:31:18.730 - 00:31:23.254, Speaker B: So the rest of so the other six or seven are in Solana or in just other ecosystems.
00:31:25.554 - 00:31:29.762, Speaker A: Let me look. Predominantly. Predominantly Solana.
00:31:29.938 - 00:31:32.762, Speaker B: Where do you track your investments? Do you have a spreadsheet?
00:31:32.898 - 00:31:34.614, Speaker A: I have an excel sheet open.
00:31:37.644 - 00:31:46.944, Speaker B: How do you. I've actually found this quite tough. Like, where do you, do you just have a spreadsheet and you, like, what are the columns? Like, what are the, what are you looking at on this spreadsheet?
00:31:50.124 - 00:32:30.254, Speaker A: Well, I look at. So company name, committed and allocated, because sometimes I commit an amount and I don't get the full allocation. I want to understand when that happens. What is the equity valuation? What is the token? Fully diluted network value? Sometimes there's, I don't like, sometimes companies don't ever think about FTB. They're like, we're never going to launch a token. So oftentimes it's blank. Other times I make an assumption of two to one ratio or one to one, then number of tokens, purchase price for the tokens, realized gain, unrealized gain.
00:32:30.254 - 00:32:53.584, Speaker A: So then, of course, mom money over money, and then DPI. DPI obviously just tracks what's been realized. Mom includes unrealized. And then I have a couple of three other columns that are like, and I was just updating this today. I spent like an hour a day or like, no, multiple hours a week just updating this stuff. I now have. No, no, no.
00:32:53.584 - 00:34:10.280, Speaker A: Updating is like, there's like one, which is a bear case valuation, base case valuation, bull case valuation. And then I track like, you know, funded closing, you know, sector. I sort of a taxonomy of, like, I want to bucket these l one, l two s, gaming, infra, defi, nfts, yada, yada, yada. There's a certain type of nomenclature that I use just to understand where I'm allocating over allocating, under allocating. And those are primarily, I probably should add a few other columns, like ecosystem like, as we were just talking about, I would say the most interesting one, which I've added actually today. And it ties back to a discussion that you and I were having around positioning the portfolio is, I think, even if you're not a professional money manager, no matter what, it is incredibly important to have a fan of returns and assign some sort of probabilities, right? What is the best case for an l two? What is the bear case? What's the bull case? What's the base? And then it's not to say that that's going to be set in stone. I think it's just a reminder of when you underwrite and make the investment.
00:34:10.280 - 00:34:46.610, Speaker A: If I'm making an investment in l two, well, what's going to factor into your calculus? Well, I'm going to look at where other l two s, right? The best l two today. Arbitrum from a fully diluted network value. And yes, full disclosure, I'm an investor, folks, is trading out 8 billion or so. Then you have optimism at seven. Then you have starcore private rounds or secondary markets. A lot of these l two that have been launched, they're trading in the two to $3 billion, $4 billion range, the CK sinks of the world starquares scroll. Then you have blast.
00:34:46.610 - 00:34:57.414, Speaker A: Right. And so I'm going through that exercise now because you can get carried away very quickly if you don't set discipline and standards.
00:34:59.274 - 00:35:30.158, Speaker B: All right, everyone, so we talk a lot about the institutions coming into crypto on empire. Santi and I are both headed out to London March 18 to 20th for blockworks 8th ever digital Asset Summit. Das. This is an institutional buttoned up conference that we've hosted since 2019. I like to joke that it is probably the last remaining kind of suit and tie event in crypto. People are still wearing suit and tie. It's pretty funny, but you'll actually hear from a lot of the largest institutions in the world coming from standard, Charter, FIS, JPMorgan, framework.
00:35:30.158 - 00:35:58.480, Speaker B: Folks coming out Wintermute, Vanek, Goldman Sachs there are a couple big themes of this conference. One, bitcoin catalysts, the having and the spot ETF. Two, a view from the buy side. Three, Rwas tokenization and stable coins. Four, global regulatory frameworks five, institutional infrastructure, including banking and payments and six, the macro case for crypto. If you have anything to do with the institutional side of crypto, you have to be there. Santi and I got your back.
00:35:58.480 - 00:36:26.240, Speaker B: We hooked you up with a 20% off code. It is empire 20. There is a little competition running internally at blockworks to see who can drive the most number of tickets. So help Santi and I out register with our code and you get 20% off. That is Empire 20. This episode is brought to you by the Chronicle protocol, a cost efficient, transparent, and decentralized oracle that gives protocols verifiable on chain data for the frequent listeners of empire. You know that we talk a lot about Makerdao.
00:36:26.240 - 00:37:06.588, Speaker B: Chronicle protocol is a novel Oracle solution that has exclusively secured over 10 billion in assets for Makerdao and its ecosystem since 2017. And for the first time ever, Chronicles Oracle services are now publicly available. Why should you use Chronicle? It's simple. Chronicle offers a 60% reduction in gas fees for all of their leading counterparts. Also super cool, they have unparalleled transparency when it comes. Oracle's Chronicle offers a dashboard that allows anyone to track the genesis and trajectory of the data it provides. This is the first time ever that an oracle has made all of its data verifiable, setting a new standard for the accessibility of on chain data.
00:37:06.588 - 00:38:15.423, Speaker B: Endorsed by a network of the most revered validators, including Etherscan, Infura, gitcoin, DyDx and Makerdao, Chronicle is the epitome of security and reliability liability in the oracle space. It's time for a paradigm shift in oracle development. You can learn more about chronicle@chroniclelabs.org. Dot big thanks to Chronicle for sponsoring Empire.

Or if you're on YouTube, scan the QR code on your screen right now. Now let's get back to the episode.
00:38:28.294 - 00:39:07.662, Speaker A: When I first invested in something like Ethereum. Like, you come from a mindset of saying, like, did I ever imagine that that was going to be a 200 or $300 billion network in what are we, like year eight of development? So fucking lutely not. Like, no. A lot of people, you'll hear a lot of OG say, yeah, of course. So obvious. I'm like, dude, I remember the early meetups, and I don't like, just look at yourself in a straight face because you're not doing. At the end of the day, the only person you're fooling is yourself because it's okay to update your model.
00:39:07.662 - 00:39:21.434, Speaker A: Like, if you're seeing all these traction. And for instance, if all of a sudden we start seeing way more funding into Solana, well, someone's gonna flip Ethereum. There's a version of this next cycle where Solana flips Ethereum. And I think it's a greater than 25% probability.
00:39:22.734 - 00:39:26.014, Speaker B: Sorry, you think it's a 25% probability that Solana.
00:39:26.094 - 00:40:04.928, Speaker A: Percent probability that Solana flips Ethereum. Like, I don't want to say this cycle, but there is a version of this world where Solana flips Ethereum, and that doesn't necessarily mean that ethereum shrinks in size. I think that Solana just uniquely enables different use cases that introduces way more usage, utility, therefore value. And there is a version where Solana and Ethereum are trading at the exact same FTV. And there's a version where Solana trades at a higher FTV.
00:40:05.096 - 00:40:06.728, Speaker B: Is it more, okay if that were.
00:40:06.736 - 00:40:09.240, Speaker A: To happen, is it more about what.
00:40:09.272 - 00:40:12.284, Speaker B: Solana got right or what Ethereum got wrong?
00:40:13.464 - 00:41:10.526, Speaker A: What Solana got right? Because it's a very interesting question someone asked me, like, why don't I hold much bitcoin? Is because what do you need to believe for bitcoin to grow ten x in value? Basically establish the same market cap as gold. And gold took hundreds of years to ossify as a store of value as social consensus? I don't necessarily believe that. Like, in order for bitcoin to do a ten x, think about the amount what that, like, what do you need to believe for that to happen? Sovereigns buy it. A lot of allocators buy it. It's certainly possible. How many Michael Saylors do you think are out there in the world today and are going to be out there in the next five years? Look, I'm always amazed by how, like, quickly technology, especially in an open source context, especially how connected the world is. It is just mind blowing and fascinating how Nvidia went from nothing when we're all tracking it in crypto, to a trillion plus company.
00:41:10.526 - 00:41:52.146, Speaker A: That happened in very, like, the amount of value it gets created is basically in the. How quickly that can happen gets compressed, I think, in this state of the world, not just in crypto, so it can happen, but I need to believe like, that. Those set of assumptions, I think are, I describe lower probability. It is far easier for me to believe that Solana reaches the same market cap of Ethereum without believing all the other stuff that I just talked about. Like the crypto aggregate market cap doesn't need to be 10 trillion plus for Solana to flip Ethereum. I think I could argue that it could stay. It doesn't have to grow much because there's two things that may happen.
00:41:52.146 - 00:42:25.474, Speaker A: One that I'm arguing here, one a rotation away from Ethereum into something like Solana. In that scenario, yes, I think there is some value. When you think about the collective value of Ethereum, if you include other l, two s, then maybe some of that value does get sucked away and goes to Solana. It is possible. My operating assumption is not necessarily that one. It certainly has some probability, but it's low, I think. Well, I wouldn't think that's slow.
00:42:25.474 - 00:43:46.704, Speaker A: I think there's a higher probability where more money that is coming into the space and investing on a relative basis. The split between how historically it's been allocated to the Ethereum ecosystem will go down relative to how it goes to and be is allocated to Solana and some other ecosystems. But especially in this debate around Solana, I think that share will grow considerably. So if you're a venture fund, you just raised blockchain capital of the world as an example, not them. You just raised $100 million fund two, fund, 190 plus percent of that went into Ethereum. Right? Maybe 80 if you held some bitcoin or whatever, but you're trying to outperform ETH, but you're still investing in the ETH ecosystem fund, $200 million fund going, and you just raised it, or erasing it, I would say maybe that ratio now goes 40% Solana, whereas before it was less than five, maybe zero, actually, zero. For many funds, like a lot of funds have zero exposure or have had zero investment dollars go into Solana, that number is going to grow by an order of magnitude.
00:43:47.324 - 00:44:01.108, Speaker B: Let me ask you this. How, okay, if that's your thesis, how much exposure do you put on how do you play. How do you play that trade, basically? Do you buy Solana? Or. I mean, we've been. Yeah, just on telegram talking about Solana.
00:44:01.156 - 00:44:04.224, Speaker A: NFts depends on what type of investor you are.
00:44:04.684 - 00:44:06.204, Speaker B: You, specifically?
00:44:06.284 - 00:44:06.596, Speaker A: Me?
00:44:06.660 - 00:44:09.100, Speaker B: Well, yeah, like, are you. Are you, like, are you markets?
00:44:09.252 - 00:44:17.620, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm certainly. I've entertained the idea of selling all my Ethan buying soul. I've entertained all of you.
00:44:17.772 - 00:44:21.036, Speaker B: Eventually, someone called me last night and also brought that up.
00:44:21.180 - 00:44:45.464, Speaker A: I've entertained it. And I was listening to this. I've been just maniacally listening to everything that Anatolia said in the public record and tracking his progress. And I think I had a big insight this week. Historically, I placed a lot. I had a tweet about this. Historically, I placed a lot of focus on the higher hardware requirements of Solana.
00:44:45.464 - 00:45:49.104, Speaker A: But I think it comes from a point where, if you truly believe that we are solving problems that need to be solved and people therefore are willing to pay for it, then hardware becomes irrelevant. And these like, to this point around the cost of running a blockchain hardware. Biggest criticism for Solana, it's an order of magnitude higher than Ethereum. Meaning what does that actually, you know, it just becomes more expensive to run a full node. And so there's only, it discriminates certain people where Ethereum, anyone can run a node with a like line, you know, with a raspberry PI, $200 versus 3000. My real question is, I don't think that's a big enough of a concern, because if you have a very clear focus on the type of problem that you're addressing with a blockchain, people are going to be willing to pay for that because they make up way more in the problem. If you're solving real problem, there's a ton of margin.
00:45:49.104 - 00:46:16.288, Speaker A: And what does that mean for Solana? You hear Anatoly talk time and time again. He was developing some algorithms. Anytime he had an edge or found some alpha, he will receive the data ever so slightly slower. In financial markets, there's this latency of data. There's a great movie about people getting closer and closer to the stock market to be closer. Right? That's bandwidth. That's another component of cost here.
00:46:16.288 - 00:47:28.214, Speaker A: And they would get closer, because if you receive information before someone else, that's Mev, like you can do MeV. In Solana, they are very focused on solving that, which is, for me, I see a team that is very focused in product market fit in a very unique problem that they're trying to solve. And that's why I think you've seen a lot of Defi founders excitement from people that in tradfite coming into Solana and saying, yeah, when you have a globally synchronized state machine where information is propagated with no, like, no one has an unfair advantage, that is incredibly valuable, to the point where, yeah, you're going to pay the hardware, right, you're going to pay the storage and you're going to pay the bandwidth, because there is so much more value in getting to that state, right, where financial markets don't. And that's, that was like in Ethereum and others, not just a criticism on Ethereum as an industry, we've been, oh, we can do like, we can, we can do trustless trust. Like, these networks are fascinating. It's smart contracts and even bitcoin. Like, the idea of having all these networks to reach consensus without trusting anyone.
00:47:28.214 - 00:47:56.784, Speaker A: Mind blowing. I study game theory. To me, it's a new chapter of game theory, incredibly exciting and novel and, like, holy shit. Moment. Right? But the approach has always been, let's decentralize. Let's just. But what does that fucking mean? Like, like, what does it actually mean? Like, what product? And, okay, Defi is great, but when there's latency or there's really, like, you can't build a centralized order book model in Ethereum, you can in Solana.
00:47:56.784 - 00:48:24.664, Speaker A: You can do micro payments in Solana. I'm not saying that every single application lends itself to Solana, which is also the other point. I think they've been very opinionated on the type of things that are going to work in Solana. And that's okay. It's not going to capture it all, but I don't think it's a winner. One chain to rule them all world anyways. Does that make sense?
00:48:25.204 - 00:48:29.868, Speaker B: It does. It does. What got you to change your mind about?
00:48:29.916 - 00:48:50.926, Speaker A: I heard Anatoly say the same thing three times in three different podcasts over three years. And I was like, okay, yeah, that's a clear vision. And then, of course, oh, we can unpack this a lot. I was just having a great, fascinating discussion with Logan from frictionless capital. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Great guy. Like, we should probably have him on.
00:48:50.926 - 00:49:21.698, Speaker A: He is probably one of the guys that, because I, funny enough, think that investors, the best investors in crypto, articulate the technology and the value proposition better than founders. Most founders, and he's probably one of them. Like, he's very deep and he understands these things very well. Murt on Lightspeed shout out. Also very good. He's the rare people that, like, have that skill. But also, the other thing that changed is I heard Anatolia.
00:49:21.698 - 00:49:56.202, Speaker A: It was a podcast that I was on with him. It might have been here, or I got invited to bankless with Vasily from Lido to talk about, because they were getting criticisms of their dis centric. I was like, all right, let's have a Solana discussion. We didn't have the team, but we had Vasily from Lido. And there's just a couple of things that were interesting. Like, for instance, dynamic fee markets are probably the most important and will be the most important thing to scale these blockchains. Like, you can talk about parallel execution.
00:49:56.202 - 00:50:31.498, Speaker A: Interesting, for sure. And you could talk about the different ways that you can do it deterministically or optimistically. I have a very specific view that the. I don't. I'm getting a bit technical, but I don't understand why you would use optimistically optimistic parallel execution. I just think deterministic, while it places more burden on the engineer, specify very clearly what the smart contract or what app that they're doing at the smart contract layer, what it can do, whereas optimistic, the engineer doesn't have to do that, but with deterministic like you do. So it's a bit of an overhead from an engineer perspective.
00:50:31.498 - 00:51:10.600, Speaker A: But then that solves a lot of issues, because if all of a sudden you know that there's a smart contract, for instance, with payments, when you're sending USDC, it's super simple. Like, it's not like this crazy abstract, like smart contract. It's like very simple sending. So if an engineer explicitly says, my contract's only made for payments or into venmo on chain, well, that's just very explicit. It's a very dumb smart contract. So that's a deterministic parallel computing environment that Solana instance sui has. You have optimistic, which Modad Aptos say some of the Ethereum maybe can do this with access list.
00:51:10.600 - 00:51:45.018, Speaker A: But I'm like, well, okay. Like the issue with that is when you're trying to do the ordering of transactions and making sure that there's no like conflicting, right. It becomes incredibly hard to like parse through conflicting transactions. It just becomes easier in a deterministic environment because you know when you're sending money, boom, easy. Like, you can the finality for that. And the, and again, the finality is faster. But more importantly, you can do more dynamic and better price discrimination on fees because then all of a sudden you're like, you can set.
00:51:45.018 - 00:52:43.154, Speaker A: What I'm trying to say is maybe it's just too nuanced, but like, I'm of the opinion that any infrastructure debate, perhaps the most important thing now is understanding how these different three cost components of blockchains are going to look over time. Because scalability is a very, like TPS. All this stuff is, it's like TVL, right? But I think if we really dissect, it's like, all right, what is your hardware cost requirements going to look at when you have millions of applications and millions of users? Certainly TPS like, is not a standard. It's not standardized. Yet every project claims that they have the highest DP's. For me, that's just like, it's a bullshit metric until we have some reasonable standard. But it's really, I think it's broadband and low credit shout out to broadband probably become one of the most important and highest costs of blockchains, not hardware and of course the most important thing is like how many people are actually running full nodes, not light nodes, full nodes.
00:52:43.154 - 00:53:22.604, Speaker A: Because then you can look at the Nakamoto consensus and say, okay, well, there's 20 different full nodes in Solana versus maybe two in Ethereum. So while realistically it's much cheaper from hardware perspective to run a node in Ethereum, no one's doing it. Practically no one's running a fucking node in their kitchen. Like, no one. But if you have sophisticated players that are like, jumps to the world, say, wow. Like an environment where data syncs in real time and you can build all these different incredible applications like a centralized order book model and a perp on chain, there's huge fees that can be extracted from that. Yeah, I'm gonna pony up the hardware cost and yeah, I can probably stomach the bandwidth costs.
00:53:22.604 - 00:53:42.584, Speaker A: So anyways, I'm like deep on this. I'm like, of course, like not articulating this in the best manner, but I think over time people will have this awakening. I think we. Yeah, and I'm not a maximalist. I don't want to fod Ethereum. I think there are merits.
00:53:43.564 - 00:53:49.876, Speaker B: By the way, I was with you until the very. I think that there are three or 4000 full nodes on ETH or maybe even more than.
00:53:49.900 - 00:53:53.504, Speaker A: Yeah, there's like 3000, 3500 full nodes on ETH.
00:53:54.364 - 00:53:56.348, Speaker B: But I was with you until the end there.
00:53:56.436 - 00:53:58.284, Speaker A: There was like 3000 or so.
00:53:58.324 - 00:54:05.504, Speaker B: Also, folks, it is 11:00 p.m. Where Santi is and has not eaten food all day. So we like, we like 11:00 p.m. Fasting Santa here.
00:54:06.774 - 00:54:23.834, Speaker A: But you know what I mean? Like, yeah, yeah, it's, it's. I'm going through this process. I'm not. Look, I am participating the early rounds of Solana. I did it paraphrase. I wanted to have exposure to that. Did I appreciate all this that I'm saying? No, absolutely not.
00:54:23.834 - 00:54:39.384, Speaker A: For me, it was a lot of the team back then. Um, I've been, I've been a judge in many hackathons. Credit to band for inviting me. I've been a breakpoint speaker. I've been going to breakpoint. I didn't go this year because I couldn't go. I was running the marathon.
00:54:39.384 - 00:55:07.638, Speaker A: But it's important to pay attention to this stuff. And I also think a lot of this infrastructure debate and scalability debate should be taken with a bit of a perspective, as you said, on how the Internet actually happened. You can't really. I'm not a builder. I'm not technical, but I love history. And I just constantly remind myself that technology moves really fast. The best thing that you can do, because I'm not going to predict it, I'm not going to predict the future.
00:55:07.638 - 00:55:43.258, Speaker A: So understand the present exceptionally well, better than others. And I don't think a lot of fund managers really understand this nuance. I think they're opinionated. I think maybe it's just by some sort of selection that they've seen more deal flow in Ethereum, but I think that's going to rapidly change. In fact, I know it because I've talked to most funds out there in the last, like, month, and they're all asking the same goddamn question. How much ETH should I have relative to soul? Ten to one, five to one? One to 10 to one? It's all the same. They're all asking themselves the exact same question.
00:55:43.258 - 00:56:11.658, Speaker A: And it's not just Solana, it's other l one s. And if anything, if anything, like, I still believe that there's a place for, you know, Ethereum and the VM and L two s. I mean, I certainly made investments in a lot of this stuff. It just depends on the use case. And a lot of these use cases, we haven't even started to see. We can't even imagine them. Like, who imagined Uber would have been a thing? Smartphone? No one.
00:56:11.658 - 00:56:13.414, Speaker A: So anyways, let me.
00:56:13.954 - 00:56:26.510, Speaker B: Let's close with this, because some folks were tweeting at us about Solana nfTs, and they wanted. They wanted your take on this. So I actually do wanna. I'm gonna. I'm gonna go. You were, you were trying to write bell curve. So I'm gonna bring us back to the left side here.
00:56:26.510 - 00:56:39.542, Speaker B: If you look at mad lads, they are. They were sitting at 40, 45 to 50, sold back in. What is this?
00:56:39.638 - 00:56:48.684, Speaker A: Two weeks ago. There's not looking at video. I'm just gonna say. Yano is doing technical analysis on nfts, on tensor. Man. I know, I'm just looking.
00:56:51.464 - 00:56:54.164, Speaker B: I don't know how to use tensor. This is the only way I do. I click.
00:56:54.624 - 00:56:56.164, Speaker A: Bollinger bands.
00:56:57.344 - 00:57:00.944, Speaker B: Yeah, we hit the 61 fibonacci number.
00:57:01.064 - 00:57:03.704, Speaker A: Wait, is Matlab's hitting resistance? Definitely is.
00:57:03.744 - 00:57:25.164, Speaker B: No, we're hitting resistance, baby. Yeah, exactly. No, a lot of support on this one. Look at those Bollinger bands. No, all I'm saying is if you. If you think that soul is gonna rip the. And you wanna like your derivatives, right, you know, I'm out here just going long coin base, and you're doing like, triple, quadruple, whatever backwards.
00:57:25.204 - 00:57:28.224, Speaker A: You probably perform by this lower risk on the strategy.
00:57:29.244 - 00:57:32.988, Speaker B: Why not just buy, what is it? Quacks or whatever? Or quack.
00:57:33.036 - 00:57:34.700, Speaker A: An honorary quack. Quack.
00:57:34.812 - 00:57:51.488, Speaker B: Quacks, yeah. Mad lads or tensorians. Like, why not like that's basically a lever bet on soul. Or maybe you are as well. It's really a question about what? I'm not actually asking about solar, I'm asking about how do you think about buying nfts?
00:57:51.576 - 00:58:34.374, Speaker A: This goes back to the value accrual. Do you buy as a, as a fund manager, whatever you want to outperform the benchmark? If you're not outperforming Ethereum or bitcoin or Solana? Well, folks return capital and whatever, especially now that the ETF is coming. So I think certainly now as well, I still do consider myself a professional money manager, even though it's just my capital. I want to have the same discipline and structure. So it's hard to outperform. It has been hard to outperform over a decent period of time. The underlying bitcoin, Ethereum, like most funds, actually don't, the same way that most hedge funds haven't outperformed the S and P and Nasdaq.
00:58:34.374 - 00:59:49.066, Speaker A: So I think it's hard at timing to do these lever bets on these ecosystems. I've expressed certain views, for instance, betting Defi and Ethereum. Well, that was a paraphy, was a levered bet on Ethereum. Now that at some point is also very opinionated view on Defi. Now you could say, okay, well, if Solana really picks up in a version where Solana at ten x from here flips ETH or just is a parity, right, goes back to 200 or whatever, right. It grows in value, network value, what needs to happen for that? So if you invert and you say, okay, what needs to happen for salt to do x or y, I think you could reasonably say that a whole host of applications are going to be built, some of which, a lot of it was, what has been built in Ethereum has been successful, what can be ported over to Solana, the more perhaps interesting discussion, because a lot of that has already happened, is, you know, which applications are getting traction, but also which applications that didn't work in Ethereum can work in a bet in a more higher performant. However you want to define that execution, consensus environment, whatever.
00:59:49.066 - 01:00:15.658, Speaker A: And I think that is the more interesting question now is, is it going to be gaming? Is it going to be, you know, social spy? Is it going to be. So when I look back concretely in the seven deals that I made. Those seven deals are early stage bets on parts of Solana. Like. Like Solana V, you know, the eclipse, for instance. That was one bet. So that's a Solana EVM.
01:00:15.658 - 01:00:54.420, Speaker A: Like the SVM, right? Like margin fi, for instance. Well, it's like a, you know, money market of sorts in Solana. So I think that I would. I think of it as I always want to hold the underlying, the base, because I think value does accrue. This is, like, you know, fat protocol thesis kind of thing, because I'm making two different bets. One, that salon is underappreciated and the whole venture community and funding community, and, like, doesn't have enough. While it has had incredible performance, year, date, six x or whatever, um, it's still on a relative basis, like, quite small.
01:00:54.420 - 01:01:14.948, Speaker A: So. But I do think that, um, I wouldn't touch nfts for that. Not because I don't think you can actually outperform. I think there's a version where you. You're. You're. You buying nfts on Solana vastly outperforms my private investments in some of these applications that may take four years in the making and might not even make it, so.
01:01:14.948 - 01:01:30.972, Speaker A: But that's. That's collecting, man. I don't. I don't collect to sell. That's just my philosophy. I don't think I've ever sold an NFT. Maybe one, actually, where I was gifted an NFT, and then someone wanted to buy it from me.
01:01:30.972 - 01:01:34.064, Speaker A: And the team that gifted to me, I was like, this is weird.
01:01:34.644 - 01:01:37.984, Speaker B: I also don't think I've ever sold an NFT, though, to be fair, I also.
01:01:38.644 - 01:01:40.436, Speaker A: It's a crypto.
01:01:40.460 - 01:01:42.772, Speaker B: When I should have sold crypto and should have sold some of those, I.
01:01:42.908 - 01:01:58.076, Speaker A: It's hard because, I mean, I think there's many one on one rules of investing. Don't lose money. Which is kind of like, okay, duh. But the more important one is just don't fall in love with anything. Yeah. So always have a price target in mind.
01:01:58.140 - 01:02:04.412, Speaker B: That's Tommy's point in that. In that group chat, which was you and Ryan were telling him to get a punk, and he's like, look, I'm. I don't want to get married to.
01:02:04.428 - 01:02:23.098, Speaker A: Anything that's a problem with nfts. Like. Like, just become attached to these things. Anyways, I don't know how you think about it, too, but, look, I suffice to say that I'm making some meaning, pretty meaningful changes in my portfolio, because I've gone back to kind of first principle thinking and just going a bit deeper on the tech.
01:02:23.226 - 01:02:27.054, Speaker B: Yeah. Cool. That feels like a good place to wrap.
01:02:27.674 - 01:02:28.574, Speaker A: Is it?
01:02:29.434 - 01:02:30.934, Speaker B: I have a hard stop in.
01:02:32.074 - 01:02:33.024, Speaker A: Oh, yeah.
01:02:33.154 - 01:02:44.104, Speaker B: Well, listen, I'm also like, we got Lido. Is Lido a systematic.
01:02:45.044 - 01:02:46.980, Speaker A: We didn't talk about light. Oh. We didn't talk about metallic spots.
01:02:47.012 - 01:02:52.276, Speaker B: We didn't talk about wormhole work. When did this wormhole fundraise actually happen? This feels like a raise.
01:02:52.300 - 01:03:03.308, Speaker A: That happened. No idea. This feels negotiated. Yeah. There's so much. I mean, look, folks, we're heading into the holidays. I'm gonna be doing a bunch of traveling, but I'm fired up.
01:03:03.308 - 01:03:04.476, Speaker A: There's a lot to talk about.
01:03:04.540 - 01:03:10.636, Speaker B: We don't got. We don't got holidays yet. We got three weeks till the holiday. We got four weeks till the holidays. Don't try to get off this easy.
01:03:10.700 - 01:03:21.828, Speaker A: You know, it's like. Is it that speaking? We have to round it with Spotify, of course, which is two things. One, I want folks to drop their year in review, and hopefully we see Empire.
01:03:21.916 - 01:03:23.604, Speaker B: Only if empire was on there for sure.
01:03:23.724 - 01:03:40.984, Speaker A: No, no. I want to see what people listen to, and if we're last, fine. Like, I want to actually pay attention to that. But also, as we think about the holidays. Look, man, there's people that put up their Christmas tree and whatever holiday attire, like, a month ago. And Mariah Carey.
01:03:41.404 - 01:03:42.664, Speaker B: What's that song?
01:03:43.884 - 01:04:00.844, Speaker A: We all hate it. Look, you might laugh at her, man. The amount of royalties that she makes on that. We're doing it wrong, man. We should EDM track and claim royalties on that. On chain, of course.
01:04:01.464 - 01:04:04.584, Speaker B: According to the economist, carries all I want for Christmas.
01:04:04.744 - 01:04:05.776, Speaker A: All I want for Christmas is.
01:04:05.800 - 01:04:13.244, Speaker B: You made Carrie $60 million between 94 and 2016. So that doesn't take into account the last seven years.
01:04:14.304 - 01:04:20.072, Speaker A: Goddamn, I hate the song. I love that. I love it.
01:04:20.168 - 01:04:23.000, Speaker B: We need a better jingle for empire is what we need. So we can.
01:04:23.072 - 01:04:26.884, Speaker A: Yeah, can someone. We need a jingle here. We need someone.
01:04:26.964 - 01:04:29.652, Speaker B: Drum up a better jingle for empire. We're still using this thing.
01:04:29.668 - 01:04:36.900, Speaker A: We made block quirks and empire merch, folks. Like, we are still very much in it, baby.
01:04:36.932 - 01:04:38.064, Speaker B: We're slumming it.
01:04:38.844 - 01:04:46.596, Speaker A: Anyways, thanks, everyone, for listening. It's been a treat. Gianno. For the record, let it be known that is shutting me down. It's 1015. It's almost 11:00 p.m.. Here.
01:04:46.596 - 01:04:55.614, Speaker A: I got a flight to catch that is going to severely jet lag me, but I still want to go and he's dropping me. So let let it be known that that is happening. Peace, folks.
01:04:56.234 - 01:05:19.670, Speaker B: Everyone, thank you so much for watching today's episode. Really hope you enjoyed it. We wanted to take a second to just remind you about our upcoming digital asset summit in London, March 18 to 20th. Santi and I got your back. Seats are limited, and we hooked you up with a 20% off discount code. It is Empire 20. If you heard it early in the podcast, there's a little competition running at blockworks to see who can drive the most number of tickets.
01:05:19.670 - 01:05:25.214, Speaker B: So when you register for the digital asset summit, make sure you use our code. Empire 20. See you in London.
