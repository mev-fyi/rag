00:00:00.160 - 00:00:27.758, Speaker A: You've just started to see bald motherfuckers like Larry Fink going on CNBC talking about fiscal responsibility and all sorts of other bullshit that we've been banging on drums for the last, like, 15 years. The sales force is just starting around the world of, hey, put your assets here. We'll protect you against inflation. You maybe made ten x on some shitcoin that you bought, and you sell that now the shit's going 1000 times higher. But I even. Not even there yet.
00:00:27.886 - 00:00:51.830, Speaker B: Hey, everyone, if you have been listening to Empire, you know that Santi and I are fed up with unaffordable fees and frustrating transaction speeds that make the on chain experience basically unusable. So the arbitrum team reached out, and they showed us the platform. They showed us what you can do on arbitrum. Whatever you're doing, you can experience frictionless transactions at lightning speed on arbitrum. So head over to portal Arbitrum IO.
00:00:51.902 - 00:00:52.734, Speaker C: And check it out.
00:00:52.814 - 00:01:23.982, Speaker B: What's up, everyone? Before we jump into today's episode, I'm excited to share Empire's first ever security partner. Harpy is the best tool to prevent your wallet from theft in real time. Harpy is not just a security solution. They are a peace of mind solution. But don't just take our word for it. Harpy is the only wallet security solution that protected 100% of its users from attacks like the Ledger one and Q four, which was an off chain signature attack.

00:01:24.038 - 00:01:29.222, Speaker D: Forward slash Empire. All right, everyone, welcome back to Empire.
00:01:29.278 - 00:01:31.462, Speaker B: We've got guy from Athena Labs, and.
00:01:31.478 - 00:01:34.954, Speaker D: We have Arthur Hayes joining us. So, Arthur, guy, welcome to the show.
00:01:35.454 - 00:01:36.766, Speaker A: Thanks for having us.
00:01:36.870 - 00:01:37.294, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah.
00:01:37.334 - 00:02:09.074, Speaker D: Bump for this, Arthur, I thought it'd be fun to actually pick on you. To start, you've been writing about stable coins for, I don't know, as long as I have been reading you, whether it's like, I remember the Luna brothers piece from 2022. There was an article from 2021 talking that I remember when you were writing about stablecoins, the height of the last market. Basically, you were calling for a change in stablecoins. I'd be curious, what is your story of both thinking about stablecoins but also meeting guy and getting involved in athena?
00:02:10.254 - 00:02:19.154, Speaker A: Yeah, stablecoins and tether was the pioneer of this back in, I don't know, 2015, when they were, when they started, whenever it was.
00:02:19.314 - 00:02:19.586, Speaker D: Right.
00:02:19.610 - 00:03:00.324, Speaker A: So back when I used to trade a lot more and be more involved in the exchange scene, when I started in 2013 after Mt. Gox failed. Then baking became a really big issue for the entire crypto ecosystem. And exchanges lost bank accounts. I remember back in the day, Bitfinex had an HSBC account, and you had major banks, unbeknownst to probably their compliance departments, had crypto exchanges that were using them. But once Mt. Gox failed and that whole shit show went down and there was more scrutiny around crypto, you started seeing banking become a lot bigger issue for a lot of the major exchanges.
00:03:00.324 - 00:03:36.258, Speaker A: So they played this cat and mouse game where for a time it was Taiwan, where all the exchanges of thousands of taiwanese banks that were cool with crypto, and then the taiwanese banks corresponded. Back in the US said, we don't want more crypto. So they kicked everybody out. And so it became this constant back and forth, and into the breach stepped tether, which was like, hey, how are we able to do it? We're able to keep a bank account. You can stuff some dollars here, and we're going to give you this us dollar token that's going to ride around the crypto exchange ecosystem. And basically you, as the exchange, don't need to have baking relationships. And that was very important.
00:03:36.258 - 00:04:06.004, Speaker A: And obviously you have exchanges like Binance. Binance. I don't know if they have a bank account even today, started no bank account, still has no bank account, probably. And their whole order book was based on tether pairs. So stablecoins as a concept of we want to bridge. How do I get fiat into crypto when the banking system is hostile? For obvious reasons, there's this stable coin thing. Tether started very small, and obviously now it's like 100 billion aum.
00:04:06.004 - 00:04:44.194, Speaker A: And my whole, I guess, problem with tether is not that they're shady or they're lying about the reserves or any of that fud shit that you hear on the Internet. I think tether is a great business. It's run very well. My problem is that tether relies on the banking system to exist. If the banking system says, we don't want to have this proto us dollar bank servicing crypto, it's very trivial for them to cut off all the banking relationships together. We know the five banks that they deal with, it would be literally a phone call from any regulator or any major bank saying, we don't want to have tether in the system anymore. And boom, tether is gone.
00:04:44.194 - 00:05:17.644, Speaker A: And we have to deal with that shit. Show the DPEG redemptions, blah, blah, blah, trading mayhem. So we have this great product that we need as crypto ecosystem yet we're relying on the tradfi motherfuckers to give us access to this product. And so my thinking was, well, why are we doing this? We have derivatives, we have crypto. We don't need to use the banking system. We can create a synthetic dollar by combining. And originally, my thought was bitcoin and a short futures contract, or short perpetual swap, the inverse types that were margined in bitcoin.
00:05:17.644 - 00:06:13.788, Speaker A: And we can create this synthetic dollar, and we can use a synthetic dollar throughout the ecosystem for anyone who wants to park money into a crypto dollar that can ride around the ecosystem when they don't want to own bitcoin or ethereum or any of the other shitcoins. And so I've written about this concept many times in different flavors throughout the many years that I've been writing the crypto treater digest. And then I penned this article, dust on crust calling. Again, like, we have this big issue in our ecosystem, in our market structure. We're relying on tether and circle and first digital and binance USD, when it existed. These companies that just hold dollars in bank accounts to power a lot of the trading pairs. Why don't we use something that's owned and operated by one of us, where the exchanges themselves are owners, and the exchanges themselves have a vested interest in making sure this survives because they want to make more money.
00:06:13.788 - 00:06:33.210, Speaker A: And so it's like, well, why don't we just provide this concept of the synthetic dollar that's created with crypto and a short perpetual swap position? And I wrote this article about a year ago, and guy read it and sort of started working on it, and we kind of crossed paths in the summer of 2023, sort of, you know, the rest is history.
00:06:33.402 - 00:06:37.050, Speaker D: So, guy, did this. Did Athena come out of that post, or did you are.
00:06:37.082 - 00:06:37.866, Speaker C: Did you have the idea?
00:06:37.890 - 00:06:45.090, Speaker D: And you basically brought it to Arthur, and he's like, you're like, I know you're talking about this. I've got this idea. Or is it, hey, you've got this idea. I think I can go build it.
00:06:45.282 - 00:07:07.820, Speaker C: It was actually slightly higher than that. So it was that Luna bros. Piece that you actually mentioned just up and went down in 22. That was actually when I sort of resigned from my job and started to think about Athena more seriously. But it was when, at the beginning last year, that Arthur put out the dust and crust. That's when I started to step it up a bit more seriously and put a team around it and that kind of stuff. So it had been something I've been thinking about for a while.
00:07:07.820 - 00:07:27.618, Speaker C: We'd seen previous iterations of this similar idea on chain in the past where they tried to do it purely using decentralized exchanges, and I found that just intellectually a very interesting type of idea on chain. It been something I've been thinking about for a while, but it was only really until a year ago when we start to really work into it today.
00:07:27.746 - 00:07:46.874, Speaker D: Nice. Arthur, why do you think this is the right. I remember that. I think it was the dust on a crust. It was like one NUSD equals. I think it was $1 of bitcoin plus short one bitcoin USD, inverse perp swap, something like that. But why is this the right model? There have been so many.
00:07:46.874 - 00:08:04.284, Speaker D: There's been the Luna model. Obviously, that's a whole different debacle. But do you remember basis from 2018, there's been these algo stable coins. There's been a whole variety of basically stable coins that have launched. Why is this the model that you've centered on as the right one?
00:08:04.864 - 00:08:30.518, Speaker A: The first thing is, I don't think that we need to be decentralized. Where's the stable coin itself? We want to take this fiat money thing that is definitely not decentralized. It's useful to us in our ecosystem, yet we don't want to rely on the banking rails. So let's take the decentralization aspect out of it. Once you remove that, then the space of what you can do becomes a lot easier. We have these exchanges. They're centralized entities.
00:08:30.518 - 00:08:47.760, Speaker A: They have a vested interest in trading and crypto happening much more efficiently to generate more fees. And they need a fiat pair for some of their. Some of the trading pairs, and they also offer derivatives. So why don't we use these exchanges, these products that are battle, you know, hard, battle hardened, tested.
00:08:47.792 - 00:08:47.984, Speaker C: Right.
00:08:48.024 - 00:08:59.000, Speaker A: The perpetual swap. You know, Bitmex launched in 2016. It's been very successful. Every single major exchange has a perp swap. Most traded product ever in crypto history. Let's use it. It works.
00:08:59.000 - 00:09:17.280, Speaker A: There's a funding rate. We have history of it. We know how it behaves in bear markets and bull markets. Let's combine the two. The math obviously works. And let's create a synthetic dollar for real, and trust the. The centralized entities in crypto that have a vested interest in this ecosystem surviving to safeguard this system.
00:09:17.280 - 00:09:28.684, Speaker A: And so I think that this has always been a great idea. It's just we have to be hit in the head a few times to sort of come around and saying, well, let's trust ourselves to build something that we want to use for trading.
00:09:29.184 - 00:09:33.112, Speaker E: Can we talk about, like, prior iterations? Guy, you alluded to this in a.
00:09:33.128 - 00:09:35.248, Speaker C: Decentralized context of like a tokenized hedge fund.
00:09:35.336 - 00:09:45.104, Speaker E: So, like, can you just go through maybe prior false starts and why they didn't work? And what about Cina is different and gives you conviction that it will work?
00:09:45.844 - 00:10:34.764, Speaker C: Yeah, I think we saw two examples. One was UXD on Solana back in 21, and there was another project called Lemma, who tried to do the same thing on Ethereum. I think the very basic answer to your question is the derivative market is just nowhere near as big to think about scaling this in a secure way on chain, just for your context. C five versus defi open interest is roughly 30 times larger. And you can't even really think about Dexs as a single pool of liquidity, because all of the main Dexs are actually split across different chains, and it's very difficult to pull that together into a single source to actually use as one pool of liquidity. So the very simple answer is that it's basically just impossible at the moment, even with the market having grown since then on chain, to do this even beyond nine figures of size. I think we also looked at what was done, and I think was actually done.
00:10:34.764 - 00:11:29.912, Speaker C: It was slightly reckless, I think, within the risk management. So to do this product on a single venue, I think, is actually quite dangerous, because when there's a single venue that can be where the funding can actually be pushed down by either just the project itself or other people on there. It doesn't allow you to diversify that funding risk across different venues. If you said to me you could only do this on finance, which controls roughly 40, 40% to 50% of the SECs open interest. Now, I still wouldn't do that product if it was just on Binance, which is 15 times larger than the whole DeFi together. So, yeah, it was very explicit trade offs that we made, which is we thought that users would value scalability and a product that was actually useful at size over some of the decentralization pieces that those other projects offered. We thought that if we were honest to our users around the trade offs that we were making, we thought that it was something that you could accept.
00:11:29.912 - 00:11:46.324, Speaker C: If we made some work around how we're interfacing with custodian, we can jump into how we're trying to reduce some of the counterparty risk to exchanges. But that was a very key piece, which is trying to actually isolate the credit risk of the collateral outside of centralized exchanges, which we think is a nice middle ground between Defi and C.
00:11:47.864 - 00:12:13.124, Speaker D: For those who missed our episode that we did a couple of weeks ago on Athena, maybe you could just set the stage. Basically, you guys launched a month ago, I think 800 million TVL, 35,000 users took over the narrative for a little bit. Can you just outline Athena for anyone who might have missed that? And then we can get into some of the risks, collateral side of things and funding risk and concept of a stablecoin, all that kind of good stuff.
00:12:13.284 - 00:13:10.804, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. So it was roughly two weeks ago from now that we came out with the public mainad that was just allowing users to come in and try the product with capped ceilings as we opened up. So we're pretty focused on ensuring that it was a pretty secure rollout and not just allowing this to grow as quickly as it could without constraints. The idea is that users can come in, they can buy either USD or s USD. And we've split up the tokens in the same way that DAI and SDI have approached things, which is you've got a stable unit, which is at the synthetic dollar, which is USDE, and then SVSDE is where you stake that same token to capture the yield that's being generated from two sources within Athena. So you've got the staked ETH returns and then the basis from the futures market, which are being put together in the same instrument. I think what we think is interesting about that is that I think crypto has a bit of an obsession around yield, but it's one of the biggest dislocations where everyone's obsessed with yield, but there's no real actual source of cash flow within crypto.
00:13:10.804 - 00:13:42.340, Speaker C: Outside of basically people paying for Ethereum block space and paying for leverage. That's really the only place that people pay billions of dollars for real yield. And so really SDSD, you can just think about putting together the only two forms of scalable crypto net yield in a single instrument. And it happens that the output of that is a dollar like instrument. So that's how we split between USD and Sgft. And yeah, as you said, we've had reasonably strong growth since we came out about two weeks ago, and just sitting at over 800 million of supply at the moment.
00:13:42.492 - 00:14:00.284, Speaker D: Cool guy. Do you want to get into some of the maybe common criticisms about it? So you guys launched, and I think there's some, like there's the funding risk criticism, there's the I can do the trade myself side of things, there's the custodial and counterparty risk, maybe you could walk us through some of these common criticisms and debunk them one by one.
00:14:00.584 - 00:14:36.860, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. So I think the funding risk is one that I think gets people's attention the most, but it's probably the one that I'm least concerned around out of all the different risks that sits around this. So the very basic idea here is that there's usually contango within Ethan BTC markets where you're getting paid to short. And roughly, the market is generally long and willing to pay for that leverage to be long. So on the funding risk, I think it's one that I'm actually least concerned around relative to, I think, the attention that I got within the market. And the very basic idea here is that usually you're getting paid to be short. Within crypto, there's a natural long bias to the market, and they want to pay for that leverage to get long.
00:14:36.860 - 00:15:26.174, Speaker C: So, yeah, naturally, the markets tend to pay for leverage to be long. And Athena is obviously sitting on the other side of that trade, where you're capturing the funding basis from others who are paying for that leverage and are expressing like, a long bias. You do see that flip through time. So I think we can look back at 2022 as a reasonable case for how would something like this perform when basically every large entity within the space was blowing up and going to zero? And I think one interesting piece was that basically, funding averaged just around zero through that period. That's not to say that the data that you look back in time can always project what's going to happen in the future, because obviously Athena is going to have a pretty material role in the market if we're successful. In terms of how you think about that break going forward, I think what id just urge people to do is actually just think about it slightly differently. I think everyone had this assumption that Athena is going to get so big and push the funding into negative territory.
00:15:26.174 - 00:16:27.364, Speaker C: But youve actually just got to think about the funding within the market as basically an exogenous interest rate to Athena system, and people are just going to express what is the level of interest rate that they are happy to hold this product, and if they are not happy to hold it at a lower level, theyre going to be stepping out of the product. And in doing so, you have to lift the shorts, which allows the funding to mean revert. So I can give just one example here, which is the funding has been roughly between 25 to as of yesterday, 65% for shorting ETH. There is going to be a demand slope for everyone within the market where they look at this product versus RWAS or USDC in the market and they decide I am willing to hold Athenas USD versus these other products at whatever spread to RWAs as an example. And if that does get too close to other things that they can hold within the market, theyre going to be swapping out and just going into a different instrument. And that has a self correcting piece to the mechanism which is if people are happy to hold it at twelve and it starts to get pushed down closer to five, theyll step out and allow it to main robot. So yeah, I think on the funding base we see it as a self correcting mechanism.
00:16:27.364 - 00:16:34.298, Speaker C: Its a market set interest rate and Athena is really just responding to demand and supply in the market for that interest rate.
00:16:34.476 - 00:17:12.200, Speaker B: Alright, I mentioned them in the pre roll, now I'm going to bring them up again. It's arbitrum. Santi and I are really fed up with these high fees and we're really excited to have teamed up with Arbitrum for the next couple of months on empire as the leading Ethereum scaling solution. Arbitrum now powers hundreds of decentralized apps across defi, herps, nfts, gaming and a whole lot more. The team has showed us everything in the ecosystem, both now and what's to come, and we're really, really excited about it. Arbitrum allows both data daily users and developers to interact with Ethereum at scale with low fees and faster transactions. The way the team got me excited was through portal dot arbitrum IO.
00:17:12.200 - 00:17:51.352, Speaker B: So my call to action to you is to get started by visiting portal arbitrum IO. Go experience on chain like it was meant to be. For a lot of empire listeners, your crypto is not just another number on a screen, it's part of your future. I know Santi and myself feel that way. Our security sponsor of this episode, Harpy, takes this responsibility seriously and is the only wallet security tool that shields users from both on chain threats and sneaky off chain signature attacks. If you've ever been in that situation where you're moving quickly, you approve something on chain, you realize that the address might be a dubious address, or you're really hoping that you could take that back. Harpy has you covered.
00:17:51.352 - 00:18:06.984, Speaker B: Harpy can redirect your assets to your self custody vault, ensuring they remain completely under your control, safe and sound. With Harpy's always on monitoring, you're not just detecting threats, you're actively blocking and recovering compromised assets from malicious transactions before.
00:18:07.064 - 00:18:08.400, Speaker D: They can even confirm.
00:18:08.472 - 00:18:33.362, Speaker B: On chain, Harpy is the only wallet security solution that protected 100% of its users from attacks like the ledger one in q four, which was an off chain signature attack.

00:18:33.488 - 00:18:42.942, Speaker D: Arthur, when you sat down and reviewed this, what do you think? What's the biggest risk to Athena? When do you think about this? In light of all the things that have gone wrong with stablecoins in the.
00:18:42.958 - 00:19:27.368, Speaker A: Past, biggest risk is counterparty risk. So Athena requires decentralized exchanges to perform the function, number one function, make sure that p and l is transferred between winners and losers. So if Athena is a winner, because the market goes down on their short per futures positions, they have to be confident that that P and L can be paid out. And so what could cause that PN to be paid out? Somebody blows up on the other side, there's automatic deleveraging, there's socialized losses, something of that nature, depending on how the different exchange operates. So that's. That's one issue. The second issue is if the exchange gets hacked or steals the collateral that Athena has put on on the platform.
00:19:27.368 - 00:19:37.800, Speaker A: Now, Athena has obviously tried to mitigate that by using third party custodians, but then you also have counterparty risk to the third party custodian. Have they built their tech correctly? Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
00:19:37.832 - 00:19:38.000, Speaker C: Right?
00:19:38.032 - 00:20:03.344, Speaker A: So it's a counterparty risk issue. It's the same, you know, overarching risk that tether has. What's whose tethers counterparty? The US banking system. So you choose one. Do I want to bet on the US banking system helping crypto to survive, or do I want to bet on the centralized crypto exchanges to help this product survive? And so you have to choose whichever risk that you want to take. There is no risk free in this situation.
00:20:05.484 - 00:21:02.854, Speaker E: Can we double click on the funding rates in, like, a day, like yesterday, when there's a huge wipeout? Like Arthur, of course. Like, we have a lot of data on funding rates historically, which, you know, you can model these out with, like, certain confidence intervals and, you know, but I'm curious, like, I noticed that you guys, I think, updated the insurance fund part of the proceeds to make it larger. I may have seen an update, like, shortly after you launched. Talk to us about in an extreme scenario, because every time you think you model it out like crypto always fucking surprises me in terms of some black swan happens. And so how do funding rates behave in extreme scenarios? And in your mind, what kind of analysis have you done in terms of what would be the worst that could happen when the insurance fund may not be as large, but your TVL grows ten x, what is that relationship and what would happen in those extreme scenarios?
00:21:03.794 - 00:21:39.204, Speaker C: Yeah, so I think there's probably two pieces to match to this. So one piece we didn't jump into in the beginning was part of the core change that we made to Arthur's idea, was actually thinking about placing bitcoin with staked ethereum as the collateral asset within Athenas backing to start with, at least. And part of that, its actually less driven to generate yield within the bull market because staked ETH returns are 3.5% to 4% now. Its not that interesting versus the basis that youre capturing on the short side of this. So of the composition of returns right now for SUSD, its like less than 5% right now is coming from staked ETH returns. The reason its actually there is for more of a bear market.
00:21:39.204 - 00:22:34.956, Speaker C: And if you do get to zero or negative funding, thats actually your first line of defense, which is youve got a positive interest rate there to help cover for some of that. And so if you just overlay the staked ETH on top of the funding rates as well, and if you sort of split up the days that you look back in time, its roughly only 10% of days out of 10% out of 100, where you see negative funding actually exceed the staked ETH returns. So thats just one piece there, which we think is a helpful defense mechanism. And actually, just like a first margin of safety, the second one is around the sizing of the insurance fund. We had a very interesting moment in time at the back end of 2022, if you guys remember the merge, there was an arbitrage trade that was going on to get the ETH proof of work airdrop, where people were long spot and then short the futures. And then you'd collect the proof of work airdrop and then basically dump it for a risk free return. That's functionally very similar to what Athena is doing, which is long ETH on one side and then short to futures.
00:22:34.956 - 00:23:27.006, Speaker C: And you actually just saw the entire market go down into roughly negative 100% funding territory for a few weeks while people were doing that trade. If you run that out, it looks very different to the type of risks that you see with analgo stablecoin, which goes to zero in 24 hours here, you could be at the bottom band there where these exchanges cap out how negative the funding can actually be. Roughly. It comes out to nine basis points of loss a day in that scenario. So we've sized the insurance fund and are sizing it with that sort of scenario in mind. And the idea here is that on top of all of those mechanisms that sit there, I would just point out that it is quite irrational for a user to see a negative interest rate and still remain within the product. And if they decide that they want to step out into something that is either zero or positive yielding, that obviously helps to remedy the situation.
00:23:27.006 - 00:24:24.214, Speaker C: And it's a sub corrected mechanism. Yeah, I don't want to dismiss the risk, it does exist, but the risk is very different in terms of what you actually lose versus something like an algorithm that goes to zero. And I would also just say that you've always got to contextualize these risks relative to return as well. So it's a very simplistic analysis to just say USDC versus USD, because with USDC it's return free risk, where you're taking the risk of a deep egg, like we saw in March of 23, and you're getting paid nothing to be an unsecured creditor to circle while here, if you're getting paid 65% like you were last week, or 30 or 20 or whatever that number is, you've got to contextualize the potential loss that you could have in a negative funding scenario relative to the return that you've actually held through the entire life of this. So if in a years time this is at 1.3 on susDe, and you lose nine bps a day in a negative funding scenario, it looks very different to basically going to zero, or comparing it to the USDC where you get zero.
00:24:25.634 - 00:25:04.234, Speaker E: Yeah, I think that's a good point. How do you think about. Obviously, I think Apy was something that people were very interested in when you launched. Of course, that is fluctuating constantly now. It's, I think, at like low thirties or 30 ish handle, how does that behave over time? And of course it depends on a wide variety of things, market conditions and whatnot. But as you scale and you become a much larger buyer of a greater share of these exchanges, how does that, if you were to isolate perhaps other variables, but how scalable is this strategy is perhaps the question.
00:25:04.654 - 00:25:48.304, Speaker C: Yeah, it's absolutely not infinitely scalable like a treasury or tether. So it's ultimately constrained by the size of open interest for derivatives within crypto at the moment, there's around roughly 35 billion of just BTC and ETH. That's just the two majors. You can also do this with Solana, for example, which is roughly $1.5 billion of ROI right now. The way we roughly think about this and exchanges start to cap you out in terms of the percentage of ROI that you can actually sit on these contracts is roughly between 35% to 40% of the post money open interest. If you're looking at the market right now and just assume that you can be cool at 30% rather than 40%, thats like roughly $10 billion of open interest that basically Athena could provide to the market, which is obviously more than Internet, where we are right now.
00:25:48.304 - 00:26:20.698, Speaker C: I do think that we start to have marginal impacts on funding rates in the not too distant future from where we are now. So roughly 9% of total ETH global interest is sitting in Athena right now. And I think if we double from there, we start to materially impact the funding rates. I think this is also just a slight misunderstanding from people where they almost. It is a criticism that that yield is going to come down through time. That is literally the point, which is youve identified that an unlevered cash in carry is paying you 25, 35, 65%. That number should be lower.
00:26:20.698 - 00:27:06.934, Speaker C: That is the observation of Athena. And in the process of bringing that number down to something that makes sense, I dont know, maybe its twelve instead of five on an RWA, someones going to create billions of dollars of value in that process. We don't look at it as like that arbitrage should be closing down, or that interest rate should fall. We look at it as that is the opportunity which is to go and push adapt something that makes sense. So it is also just another way that I urge some people to think about Athena, which is like, you might think that the whole story that we're telling around synthetic dollars and authors like original vision, you might think that that's complete bullshit. I don't. I think it's an important thing for the space you can actually just think about Athena is actually an interest rate arbitrage vehicle, which is bringing interest rates between DeFi, CFI and tradfi in line.
00:27:06.934 - 00:27:44.896, Speaker C: One very basic example I can give you here is that you can go borrow dai now at nine figures of size for 6.5%, and you can throw that in Athena for 65 this week. You can do that at nine figures of size. There are people who are paying 60% to be long in ETH pap right now. And you can put down heat on maker and actually get paid 40% to 50% by borrowing DAi and then putting it into Athena on the other side. There are obviously risk elements in what I've just described over there, but that dislocation is just completely insane, right? That you can borrow in defi at six and a half, and CFI is almost ten x out right now. So really you can think about Athena.
00:27:44.896 - 00:27:52.484, Speaker C: Potentially, it's just connective tissue, which brings interest rates in line, and the supply of USD is just a balancing item, which makes it all fit together.
00:27:55.014 - 00:28:17.194, Speaker D: Guy, how long do you think it takes for these? Basically three rates. You've got the tradfi rate, you've got the CFI rate, and then you've got this defi rate that we're talking about. And they're three very different rates right now. How many years will it take for those to. Hypothetically, they should basically converge over time, at least the CFI and the defi rate. Maybe not the tradfi rate, but how long will it take for those to converge?
00:28:18.134 - 00:28:30.524, Speaker C: Well, I'm hoping Athena accelerates that, right? Thinking about, like, the institutions coming for however many years, and like, Arthur was here doing this Arb. I don't know when Arthur was doing it. I remember reading some blog. You can jump in that you.
00:28:30.564 - 00:28:35.500, Speaker A: Yeah, I was doing it back in 2013. It was 300% per annum returns for that same Arb. So you're doing.
00:28:35.532 - 00:28:37.260, Speaker D: You were doing this trade, basically, but.
00:28:37.332 - 00:28:47.736, Speaker A: You know, on bitcoin, the first futures exchange called icy bit, it was 200% to 300% per annum returns doing cash and carry on levered.
00:28:47.900 - 00:28:52.204, Speaker D: Arthur, do you guys ever think about launching an Athena like product when you're at Bitmex?
00:28:53.544 - 00:29:27.096, Speaker A: We thought about creating a synthetic dollar within the Bitmex ecosystem to do different things within our ecosystem. But no, we didn't think about starting our own stablecoin. And I think, to guy's point, for this to be successful, it can't be a Bitmex product, or a binance product, or a wellbe product, or a bybit product. It has to be everybody together, because then you just get picked off as the one exchange that's offering the synthetic dollar rails for crypto, and you don't stand strong together. So it can't be one exchange owning this thing. It has to be a consortium of everyone for it to succeed.
00:29:27.240 - 00:29:43.664, Speaker D: Yeah, guy, your guys position is very public. I've noticed your website. You have very, very, very transparent website. I think you've done a great job with that. The downside is that your position is very public. And if I. So if I'm.
00:29:43.664 - 00:29:54.568, Speaker D: As soon as I see that, I'm like, all right, there's some hedge fund out there that's basically trying to think about how to cause a cascade and how to basically, essentially hunt Athena's position down. How do you, um, how do you.
00:29:54.576 - 00:29:56.280, Speaker C: Think about Kent Griffin, where we need him?
00:29:56.392 - 00:29:59.496, Speaker D: Yeah, exactly. Exactly like, yeah, how do you fuck the retail?
00:29:59.560 - 00:30:04.524, Speaker A: Come on, we're in Miami. Exactly.
00:30:05.064 - 00:30:06.484, Speaker E: He's donating that.
00:30:07.224 - 00:31:02.462, Speaker C: That's probably so bold to your preclinent. The first is you basically don't want to get front run on actual flows that are moving from inputs on Ethereum before you've actually executed the hedge on the other side. So all the stuff that you're seeing there on the dashboard has obviously got a time delay, so people aren't actually watching exactly where that's going to be executed, but that's on the margin where you'd be losing execution costs rather than something that's systemically wrong with USD itself. The type of attack vectors that I've read about I dont think make a lot of sense, and you guys obviously jump in if you disagree. It would basically take billions of dollars of capital to take the same trade as Athena and push down the market with billions of dollars of shorts and then wait until we bleed out, or they bleed out. And there isnt really a snap moment where you actually can short things. The reason that lingua was the most amazing short was that you could short UST, but the upside was one, and the downside was zero.
00:31:02.462 - 00:31:17.214, Speaker C: And then you could also short learner, because that was going to zero as well. Here it's like a slow attrition of principle, and the capital that you're using to short is going through the same attrition of principle as well. So I don't really know what the outcome is of someone trying to do that.
00:31:18.194 - 00:31:20.934, Speaker E: Yeah, be kind of uneconomically stupid to do it.
00:31:21.314 - 00:31:25.986, Speaker C: Yeah, I wouldn't put that unless it's.
00:31:26.010 - 00:31:28.186, Speaker E: Like a state actor that just has nothing to lose.
00:31:28.210 - 00:31:53.714, Speaker D: This is the one I saw yesterday said, users of Athena are lending their assets steeped and may not get them back if the market dips, which is extremely plausible given volatility. There's no free lunch. This would happen if Athena is unable to unwind its short position without losing much of its assets because there wouldn't be enough market depth. Athena's position is very public, very large, not very dynamic. At some point, more dynamic hedge funds are going to force Athena out of its position, which will cause a cascade and severe losses.
00:31:54.174 - 00:31:57.364, Speaker A: On the downside of the upside is this person talking about.
00:32:00.064 - 00:32:28.980, Speaker C: Yeah, I can get to the broad point of what they're getting to. And when I did say earlier within the discussion that I was less concerned around funding liquidity, is actually saying that I spent more of my time thinking about it. I think this is what that person is getting to. So you can think about users coming into and out of Athena. There is a cost of liquidity to get in, and there's a cost of liquidity to get out. It's the same way when you're using uniswap, there's a slippage, and if conditions are fine, you can do that tight. And if they're not, you're going to have to pay up for that liquidity.
00:32:28.980 - 00:33:09.620, Speaker C: The same thing exists here, which is you're putting in a liquid second token, or ETH, and then you need to execute a hedge on the other side at some level of size, and there is a cost to doing that on the other side. We, as Athena, pass through that cost to users on the other side. We can never internalize that cost because of the precise reason that you're describing there, which is if you get to a moment when liquidity is extremely thin, everyone wants out, all those different types of things. You can never internalize that negative equity to Athena's balance sheet. You have to push it onto the users as a transaction cost and liquidity cost to get in and out. So, really, I think what they're getting to there is that if everyone was wanting out at the exact same time of Athena, you'd be needing to unwind a lot of derivative positions on the other side. And there are times when that would be an expensive process.
00:33:09.620 - 00:33:47.376, Speaker C: We do have a redeem fee that exists within Athena, which is every time assets are coming in and out, we're basically taking basis points to cover for some of these costs. And it's not like a hard coded number that sits there now. It's actually us reading centralized venues to say, where can we actually unwind this now? And we need to push on that cost to the user. And so the way that that would be expressed is like a bad outcome for a user, is everyone's wanting to get out at the same time. And basically, the price that Athena is showing you that you can get your collateral back is like 99.5 rather than 100, because there's like 50 pips of execution to get at. So it'll basically be expressed by the level that you can actually redeem the USD from the protocol.
00:33:47.376 - 00:34:28.216, Speaker C: And there's nothing that you can do to hide from these cost of liquidity. It exists with all these things. Like I mentioned with Uniswap, the only thing I think that we can do is be transparent that that rift does exist, and there is a cost of liquidity to get in and out. But yeah, I think that is something that's important to keep an eye on. And I think one other element I'll just address around this is we have a lock on the staking on chain. If you're going to be capturing the yield, there's a seven day cooldown to actually get your assets back out of the SUSD contract. The reason that that exists there is you can think about this like a bank trying to manage its asset and liability duration mismatches, where we don't have a perfect duration match on the assets and the liabilities.
00:34:28.216 - 00:35:03.753, Speaker C: Because you do have some steth or liquid staking tokens, which are not perfectly liquid like tether. And your liabilities, you need to make sure that they match up in a better way than basically just having on demand our deposit that can come out. And so if you're locking users into SUSD, which is where we expect most users to be, there's a seven day sort of cooldown from people saying, I want my money back, and then actually being able to effectuate that transaction, which gives you time to sort of smooth out some of the unwind that I was describing there. So you can just really think about that. Like any financial services company that's just trying to manage asset and liability mismatches on their balance sheet.
00:35:06.044 - 00:35:25.064, Speaker D: Can you walk us through this decision? So the way that Arthur describes Athena, talking about stable coins, talking about a better tether and a better USDC, the way that you talk about it is different. I think you guys have kind of rebranded away from stablecoin more to like synthetic dollar or even synthetic Internet bond. What's the rationale for that?
00:35:25.724 - 00:36:02.144, Speaker C: Yeah, I think to be clear, like the other projects are doing the exact same thing in 21 called themselves stable coins. Carl Samant with that piece, talking about solving the stablecoin trilemma and all these kinds of things. So we didnt think it was that offensive to have the name when we had seen other projects do the same thing for the last two years. But people seem to have an allergic reaction to this. And it wasnt actually even last week. It was in October last year, where Austin Campbell called this out. And I came out publicly and I said, I actually agree with you, which is we as an industry need to think about the way that we present products to users and marketers to them in a more serious way.
00:36:02.144 - 00:36:49.200, Speaker C: My personal view, and this is just my view, is that anything which is not like less than 90 day maturity t bills or reverse repos sitting in a bankruptcy, remote SBB, that is a stable coin and everything else should have a different name. The problem is that we have a pretty large design space for stablecoins or that bucket of dollar denominated assets. If you see something like a makerdao with a CDP, all of these other CDP is like illiquity, Prisma, and a bunch of them that are out there now, they've been trading at like ninety eight cents to ninety nine cents for the last like six months. Not maker all the other ones. And so like what do we do there? It's not a stable coin. It's been a point below pegged for six months. Is that like a rule book about how we think about naming these things? I think the only thing that I'm trying to get to here is that there is a large design space.
00:36:49.200 - 00:37:28.412, Speaker C: We're trying to target a dollar. The peg has sort of stayed like posted to a dollar versus like 99% of what you've seen on chain. I agree that we should think about the naming conventions being different, but we also havent come together as an industry to actually define what is it, the way that we actually approach these things. So I would be happy to be part of that discussion. But I didnt really appreciate some people coming out and saying its being deceptive in the marketing or misleading. I think that wed been pretty clear, like in the documents on the very front page saying that this is not the same as USDC and USD. And if we thought that a synthetic dollar captured the essence of that better and people have different ideas, I'm happy to sort of like jump.
00:37:28.412 - 00:37:29.260, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:37:29.412 - 00:37:44.620, Speaker D: It comes down to how are, I mean, are people going to use it or not? Right. If people are using USDe, like, it doesn't, doesn't really matter what you call, call it. I think it's like a. And Arthur, I thought you got, I saw that you guys had a maelstrom are using it for I think, I think paid USA.
00:37:44.772 - 00:37:47.064, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:37:49.024 - 00:38:38.624, Speaker E: I used to think the biggest issue with terra or just stablecoins in general was usability. If it's just financial speculation capturing yield, certainly there are better mechanisms than others. Yours is better than terra for sure. Anyone that is contesting that just hasn't read through and thought about it clearly, or an algorithmic stable coin. But can you talk more about there's this concept of usability brings further stability. Can we see as you guys were using it, Arthur, how much of composability is a focus here? Integrations with other defi protocols. Do you ever think that of course there's a cap to how much you can grow today, but over time, if the market keeps growing, then this could be much larger.
00:38:39.564 - 00:38:39.900, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:38:39.932 - 00:38:50.614, Speaker E: What's the end goal here from a bd standpoint? How much of is it a focus today? Or will those things just kind of solve themselves as you guys continue to grow?
00:38:51.674 - 00:39:35.642, Speaker C: Yeah, I think on the composability piece thats actually whats interesting about Athena. I think Yana had a comment earlier which is like, why cant I do this myself? The answer is your grandma can actually do this trade if you hold her hand on a Sunday to put it on. Thats not whats interesting. Anyone can put on the trade themselves. Whats interesting is when you tokenize it and you put it into an instrument thats actually liquid and composable and allows you to then plug it into different areas of both CFI and DeFI. Thats actually where the magic starts to happen. So I can give you just two examples here, which were basically pushing quite hard for at the moment is very basic money markets at the moment where youre putting down some asset that has a yield and your ability to borrow that at a lower cost of liability, and then lever that up in some way to get an interesting price leverage return.
00:39:35.642 - 00:40:30.590, Speaker C: That hasnt really worked in DeFi for the last two years because theres only really one source of dollar denominated return which is basically looping rwas the cost of borrowing. USDC should converge to RWA rates and theres not really much of a trade to do here. If Athenas USD is producing 25 35 north of that and you can borrow dollars from Defi at 6.5, your ability to actually start using money markets in really interesting ways is completely unknown by this new asset. Another one that IM incredibly excited about is thinking about yield bearing collateral on both Dexs as collateral to actually marginal purp and then on sexes as well. So if youre trading a perp and then paying the funding on the other side, its an order of magnitude increase in capital efficiency to actually be able to put down an instrument thats actually capturing the basis from another exchange and then paying you while youre longing another asset. This is something that were working on with Synthetix on chain which im pretty excited about for, for the next quarter.
00:40:30.590 - 00:41:26.366, Speaker C: And I think that this is actually one of the largest growth areas that people dont understand about tether, is that theres $20 billion demand for tether where the only use case is putting it down for marginal linear perpetual on sectors. And so when you go to the largest trading funds in the space and you tell them that instead of holding $100 million of tether and getting paid zero, you can be earning ten to $20 million on that, its actually quite a big deal. And thats why theres been a few trading firms who I think have been involved in, in the growth that you've seen in the last few weeks. All that's to say is that the point you're getting to there is actually the key one, which is the trade is the least interesting thing about Athena. It's actually composing and plugging this into both DeFI and CFI, which is what I personally find interesting about it. And I think the bd question you're getting to there is that actually I think a big mistake that a lot of the on chain stable like assets have made in the past is that they ignore CFI as a distribution channel. And there's maybe 10, 20, 30,000 people who are sitting on chain doing stuff every day.
00:41:26.366 - 00:42:13.104, Speaker C: There's 100 to 200 million people sitting on these centralized exchanges. And every success story of a stablecoin has been distributed through an exchange who basically forces the product into their users hands. And so if you think about the real like nature and fabric of USD, it makes a lot more sense for a centralized exchange to be pushing this because they're getting trading fees as we're executing the hedge, we're using their liquid staking tokens and growing the TVL of that and bringing like yield to their balance sheet. And then we can share some of the yield with them as a distribution partner. And so if you ask me, what are the big avenues that this could grow? I think one is yield bearing infrastructure within l two s, where I think that thats going to be a big theme this year, whether its like blaster or others copying them. And then the second one is perp collateral on centralized exchanges, where centralized exchanges are actually doing your job for distribution and pushing the product for you there because theyre incentivized to do so.
00:42:13.724 - 00:42:31.404, Speaker E: Yeah, yeah, definitely. So I think you brought up a really good point. Like, so if you're holding USCC or tether, there's certainly a lot of risk there, whether you want to believe them or not. But you're not getting paid and they're making a whole lot of money in the back end. I mean, Coinbase started disclosing a whole lot of money.
00:42:33.344 - 00:42:35.560, Speaker A: I mean, Heather is like the what?
00:42:35.592 - 00:42:36.544, Speaker D: The opt in?
00:42:36.624 - 00:42:42.900, Speaker A: Just the money treasuries. Heather makes $62 million per employee in 2020, most probably.
00:42:42.932 - 00:42:43.524, Speaker D: That's nuts.
00:42:43.604 - 00:42:46.708, Speaker A: That's crazy ever in human history. Exactly.
00:42:46.756 - 00:43:15.864, Speaker E: Coinbase started disclosing their net interest income recently in the last quarter. Now the streets waking up to that. As a user, you're not getting paid. Do you think that you'll force their hand if at some point you become big enough? Do you think that USDC particularly, or tether will have to share some of the. The yield that they're clipping back to users otherwise? Or do you think that users are not just as sophisticated?
00:43:17.684 - 00:43:59.852, Speaker C: Arthur might have a different view. To me, I think USDC is already buckled on that, basically, which is you might have seen some of that marketing spend that they're doing on Coinbase, where you're getting 5% for having it, and they're doing that in different pockets. Watch on as public. So even though tether is, whatever, three to four x the size of USDC at the moment, I think they're more than ten to 20 x more profitable because tether truly internalizes the full 5%. But USDC is paying out, I would expect, almost half of that to the distribution partners that they're working with, based on the numbers that you're seeing from Coinbase. So, yeah, I think USDC is buckled. And part of the reason there is that, actually, I think USDC holders are much more interest rate sensitive than USDT holders.
00:43:59.852 - 00:44:50.060, Speaker C: I saw a pretty incredible stat, which I hadnt realized, which is the overlap of USDC and USDT holders is only 4% in terms of wallets that are actually holding the same asset, which is just an absolutely tiny amount. And actually, USDT is generally asian based entities who are sitting outside of the regulatory apparatus of the US, while USDC is more plugged in over there. If you think about a USDC holder, when rates went from zero to five, theres an enormous gravitational pull for capital out of crypto into treasuries, basically. And USDC was just an incredible offer to go and actually capture that. And so I think that's part of the reason that you saw them actually decline. And they face a lot more pressure when it comes to internalizing their yields, is because their holders are actually more yield sensitive. And then the second piece to that is the real reason that I think tether won is that they were like, they got the holy grail, I think, which is basically their money on exchanges.
00:44:50.060 - 00:45:34.004, Speaker C: And the point that Arthur was getting to, which is when you're the trading power on all of these major sex venues and BTC USDT ETH, USDT on binance, thats just an incredible mode thats so difficult to unseat because you dont really care about holding a yield for 5% when youre buying tether to go and long an asset thats going to move five to 10% of the day. And that really is the moat for tether, which is it is actually money on these exchange rentals. So who knows? I dont think the cycle will ever get to the size that's like north of 20 or whatever it is, where they actually feel threatened by us. I think tether basically has such a strong rate that they probably won't be paying out. That yield us to see, I think is a different story.
00:45:34.664 - 00:46:07.804, Speaker E: Yeah, I want to talk about the minting and redeeming process. This was something that came up quite extensively when right before FTX collapsed, Sam was going into a lot of detail. They were actually one of the few. And when there was the tether, Fud comes up at like every, every other year or so. And he was going to detail. But I think you guys are requiring users that are minting and redeeming to KYC. But anyone can go buy it in a curve pool, frack, whatever it is in the secondary market.
00:46:07.804 - 00:46:12.960, Speaker E: Can you comment on who is actually going through that process now?
00:46:13.032 - 00:46:14.192, Speaker C: What kind of entities, what kind of.
00:46:14.208 - 00:46:31.432, Speaker E: Players are getting involved and what are the just going back to risks, like the, like how cumbersome or the latency in that process. I'm just kind of curious if you could just spend a minute talking about like the whole minting and redeeming aspect.
00:46:31.608 - 00:47:07.530, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. Maybe I can just give you context for like three reasons why we actually did it, and then we can jump into those pieces. So the first was actually just around security. So this is like the most sensitive piece of Athena, which is we're printing you USD and you're giving us an asset. If we're mispricing that asset, that's how you lose money if you're mispricing them into redeem. And so for us, not having that fully open to the public is actually a security measure, which is we know the counterparties who are sitting on the other side there. And if there ever is an issue with the mint and redeem being mispriced, we can actually go to that counterparty and say, okay, there's been an issue here, and try and recover that.
00:47:07.530 - 00:47:54.434, Speaker C: So that's one piece which we just felt made the architecture sitting on chain much more secure for users. The second one is actually just trying to abstract away complexity for users, because we thought it was not very ergonomic for users to arrive with a liquid staking token and then swap that into dollars. What a user is actually seeing is swaps from dollars into dollars within an amm, whether it's uniswap or curve. And then what you've done is actually abstract away the complexity of bringing in liquid staking tokens or ETH into our system, onto market maker, because you basically just ensuring that that arbitrage mechanism makes sense where they want to bring you those liquid staking tokens to close out the ArP. So thats just another piece which we thought conceptually users didnt like the idea of swapping ETH into dollars. You just want to be swapping dollars into dollars. That was another piece for us there.
00:47:54.434 - 00:48:13.624, Speaker C: Thats the way it works. Its similar, and you can compare it to the way that tether and USDC do their approved parties. Its a known counterparty sitting on the other side, its kyc on the mint and redeem, and its obviously freely and permissionlessly transferable through Defi afterwards.
00:48:14.204 - 00:48:41.314, Speaker D: Arthur would be curious to just zoom out from Athena and get your broader take on the stablecoin market. What do you think ultimately happens with stablecoins? To run through maybe two or three examples, there could be a fed stable coin. They probably dont want to do that because they make trillions of dollars in FX fees. But there could be that, uh, they could try to shut down, they could call Cannor Fitzgerald, try to shut down tether. They could go after circle, they could king make circle. Like what, what is your broad view of what happens in the stable coin space?
00:48:42.054 - 00:49:51.002, Speaker A: So what I don't understand is why, what the political situation is in the back rooms of why, like Jamie Dimon or, you know, Solomon egg Oldman or one of these guys doesn't have their own coin and do this trade because it's very profitable. As we know, tether makes so much money. So the one issue is that the Fed doesn't really like fully reserve banks, because when you just take in dollars and you don't lend them out, you basically deposit those dollars to the Fed and the Fed has to pay you interest on them. And this is costing the Fed hundreds of billions of dollars a year and has rendered them unprofitable as they keep raising rates. So, tether circle first, digital. Any of these, I call them physically backed us dollar stable coins, actually poses a profitability issue for the Fed and the treasury, because they're just going to park the money in short term money markets, which is either interest on excess reserves of the Fed, reverse repos, and money market funds, or bills with less than one year maturity. This is costing the Fed and the treasury trillions of dollars a year as they keep raising rates to fight inflation.
00:49:51.002 - 00:50:30.710, Speaker A: So to allow a JP Morgan or Citibank or one of these guys to issue one of these coins, and obviously they would instantly have probably trillions of dollars flooding into them. Yeah, we would love a 24, $7 that trades on a public blockchain. We fucking hate coming to the bank at 530, and we can't get our fucking wire through. It's a service, everybody wants it. They refuse to provide it, either because they feel they don't have to, or they've been told they can't do it. I don't know which one of those it is, but I do know that fully reserved banks present a problem for the Fed and the treasury in that they have to pay so much money to. To keep reserves, uh, stagnant in the system.
00:50:30.710 - 00:51:05.524, Speaker A: So that's a higher level money market thing, which has nothing to do with crypto, which is why I think they don't like tether now. Doesn't mean they're going to call the to shut it down tomorrow. Well, now they got a problem. They've let tether grow so big, it's, I think, the 22nd largest holder of Treasuries, the treasury market liquidity, has declined since COVID as the market has ballooned in size. And so, yes, could you go after tether and call Kanter and Deltech and all these other banks and say, shut them down? Sure, they could do that. 2 seconds, and tether would be debanked. But then what do you do with all those treasuries when everyone in crypto said, okay, I want my fucking money back today.
00:51:05.524 - 00:51:44.694, Speaker A: I need to sell $100 billion worth of treasury bills. The market's not that liquid, so they've kind of fucked themselves. And on the one hand, they don't want to have fully reserved banks like a JP or a city do this trade, because then they're going to be paying them even more money on their excess reserves. But on the other hand, they've let tether grow so big that now it's bigger than most countries in terms of holdings of treasuries. And they can't easily just kick them out of the US dollar financial system because of the pandemonium it would cause in the treasury market. So it all comes down to us politics. I don't know how that gets resolved.
00:51:44.694 - 00:52:43.080, Speaker A: CDBC, again, it's an issue of does the Fed or any other central bank want to bank the citizens directly and put all the commercial banks out of business? Not even China is willing to put their commercial banks out of business to launch a CDBC that people want to use. So ultimately, I think the CDBC thing, well, it would be a tether killer, or, you know, this would be so useful to have your smartphone and connect directly with the central bank and move fiat around instantaneously. No KYC issues, blah, blah, blah. The banks have such a strong political bulwark in every single major government around the world that they're never going to let themselves be disintermediated by the central bank, who's a regulator. And so that's why we have wholesale CDBCs, which make no fucking sense because they're not going to be used by anyone. You know, the banks just sending around some tokens around each other, like never going to be used. So I don't think CDBCs are what's going to sort of dethrone in the stable coins.
00:52:43.080 - 00:53:11.672, Speaker A: It's really going to come down to incentives from the exchanges and the users. As Guy said, tether doesn't pay out money. They started so early, they have such a moat of usefulness that they don't have to pay anyone anything. But if I'm getting 2030, 40, 50% holding USDe as the user, as the exchange, now the exchange can own some governance tokens. Okay, well, Giancarlo and Paolo and all those guys at tether, like where the.
00:53:11.688 - 00:53:12.280, Speaker C: Fuck is my money?
00:53:12.312 - 00:53:48.596, Speaker A: And if they're not going to pay up, then it starts to skew. When you have these really, really high basis rates, does it mean that they're automatically going to start dumping tether? No, but we have Athena 800 or whatever it is, million TVL with all these exchange partners. And all these pairs are going to come out sexes. Why is that happening? Because they have incentive to put it on there. And, you know, you don't dethrone tether all at once. It starts very, very small. So I think there's all these confluent factors that the status quo of intense competition between algorithmic stable coins, physical us dollars in a bank account, synthetic us dollar stable coins, over collateralized things like that.
00:53:48.596 - 00:54:09.124, Speaker A: We're just going to compete and compete and compete. Whoever offers the best incentives for the users and the exchanges will ultimately win. I think that the overarching fiat regulatory apparatus has so many issues in and amongst themselves that they can't resolve that kicking out tether a circle probably isn't what's going to happen.
00:54:09.824 - 00:54:32.170, Speaker E: Yeah. So much of the stablecoin, I guess, landscape over the years has been. There's countless bodies there. A lot of it has been like. Like unknown unknowns that pop up and creep up in the system. I guess, like Tara, like everyone was.
00:54:32.282 - 00:54:52.734, Speaker A: Going, I know that terror was not an unknown. Unknown terror was not on. I wanted. Yeah, I'm not saying I read a paper like, what the fuck is this Luna thing? Why is it so viable? I had my analyst do a paper, and one of the first fucking things he put out was at Google. I don't know what the professor was. And it was this algorithmic civil coin, desperately. The fucking paper, it described verbatim exactly how.
00:54:52.734 - 00:55:04.978, Speaker A: And I knew that thing was a piece of dog shit and I bought it anyway because it was going up before it went down. So don't fucking tell me that you know how this shit was fucking written on the Internet.
00:55:05.066 - 00:55:08.714, Speaker E: No, I said I didn't talk about Tara.
00:55:08.754 - 00:55:09.122, Speaker A: Tara.
00:55:09.178 - 00:55:24.908, Speaker E: The issue with Tara was that everyone jumped into the trade was so juicy. What they didn't factor in was the size of the door to go out was not growing. So that room became incredibly. It was like a frat party. It was like thousands of people all of a sudden in the same room, and everyone wants to get out at the same time. It's not going to happen.
00:55:24.956 - 00:55:25.428, Speaker A: Right.
00:55:25.556 - 00:55:55.514, Speaker E: So I guess, like, what are some of the things that, like, you're going to be paying a lot of attention to, to make sure that, you know, is it who's showing up to mint and redeem what kind of. How savvy they are? What kind of players are showing up? Is it the exchange relationships, the counterparty relationships? Like, what are some of the things that in your mind could be, like, unknown unknowns here that might introduce some fragility into the whole mechanism.
00:55:57.214 - 00:55:57.638, Speaker C: That you.
00:55:57.646 - 00:56:06.274, Speaker E: Just are not, that you're just not in a position to comment on now, but maybe you have some theories of what those may be and you're looking out as you grow.
00:56:07.414 - 00:57:02.106, Speaker C: Yeah, I think one is always just thinking about that obviously exists, as we said, with different stable coins in different ways. So we thought that USDC didn't really have audio risk, and then we learned that there was actually very reality risk to SVB, which is where the underlying assets are sitting in the background. So I always think about these things rather than saying, we removed this type of risk. It's like really just transferring risks into different places. And so we look at the custodial setups that we put in place, which is obviously one of the largest risks here, which is if you lose your collateral, whether it's sitting in a smart contract or a custodian or a centralized exchange, that's the way that this materially goes wrong, rather than on the margin issues with funding and that kind of stuff. I think the way I approach this was, as you know, Santi Defi was the first thing that I personally found interesting about the space. That's where I had all my assets and what I was initially drawn to by the space.
00:57:02.106 - 00:57:41.392, Speaker C: But I think we also got to acknowledge that trustless interaction within DeFi is unacceptably unsecure at the moment. So I saw an into the block piece that came out. The probability of default, of actually just leaving your assets within a smart contract on Ethereum is roughly working out at 7% per annum. You get zeroed 7% of the time that you put your money into a smart contract. And yes, it sounds like great on paper that we're interacting with just smart contracts. There's no human interference and all that kind of stuff. But actually, just empirically looking at the data and saying, is it safer to have your assets in a smart contract, a centralized exchange, or an institutional great custodian? It's unquestionable that the answer is an institutional great custodian.
00:57:41.392 - 00:58:10.002, Speaker C: I know that doesn't please people when I say that. It's not with the ethos of DeFi and all those different types of things, but we looked at that as an acceptable trade off to actually app users assets sitting within that, which we think provides inadequate trade offs. To me, that is like the big one, which is how you think about the counterparty exposure. And I think we just looked at the data and could see empirically, it's not a bad place to have your assets, and that's the reason that funds you. At Powerfi hedge funds, they have their money in custodians.
00:58:10.058 - 00:58:52.426, Speaker E: It's not like anyone that says not to use a custodian is like, full. Like, crypto is these, like, tinfoil hat people that are not practical, like custodians. Like, it's like a Horcrux model. You should be using custodian, and you should be using a smart contract and everything at your disposal. But yeah, there are just some people that are really extreme and are not very practical, but it's refreshing to see you guys being one. Do you, do you think about like, just the insurance fund? Insurance has been one of those things that, like, hasn't really materialized, like going to, I don't know, some, you know, third point or whatever, and like, have crypto insurance products. That's something that hasn't really, you know, flourished at some point.
00:58:52.426 - 00:59:06.054, Speaker E: You have the insurance fund that you're growing, you're taking a fee, and so that should grow over time. But do you anticipate insurance players jumping into the fold here to provide an extra layer of security? That would be pretty cool, I think.
00:59:06.594 - 00:59:52.816, Speaker C: Yeah, it's actually a really good point because I think one of the reasons that insurance within DeFi hasn't taken off is because the cost of capital or the return of DeFi got squashed so significantly that there was basically no margin to plug insurance in. So if you remember the very beginning of DeFi summer, it was like 50% to 100% yields. You could afford to pay a Nexus mutual 1020 percent. We were talking about this back in the day. Yeah, but obviously when rates went below five, there's not enough to even feed a user, let alone an insurance layer that it's up. So I think that is actually a very interesting idea here, which is if you're making super normal returns through USD and someone can actually underwrite that, it's a risk that can definitely be underwritten. That could be one of the first reasonable use cases for an insurance fund here.
00:59:52.816 - 01:00:36.954, Speaker C: I think the other thing, just to make people aware is that it doesn't only have to be funded through excess spread of the product through time. Lido did large treasury sales when they were out with the token and had decentralized infrastructure sitting around it. If you think that this is a business that's producing a lot of cash flow, which as of the numbers that's coming out this week, it's one of basically the largest revenue generating apps on Ethereum right now. Two weeks into being big live, it's not that difficult at anything to be able to sell part of your treasury to people, to actually try and capitalize that insurance fund as well. So you've got different avenues that you can think about capitalizing that, whether it's capturing a spread or actually just selling tokens for our dollars.
01:00:39.614 - 01:00:43.934, Speaker D: Arthur, what's your take on where we're at in the market right now?
01:00:45.474 - 01:00:48.506, Speaker A: This is the beginning of the bull market. It's real fun right.
01:00:48.530 - 01:00:49.374, Speaker E: The beginning.
01:00:50.194 - 01:01:23.404, Speaker A: The beginning. This is just the beginning. We're. I mean, I guess I don't know what bitcoin is right now and have my charts up, but we're close to all time highs. Once we get past all time high, like, you know, crypto market cap, then it starts to get really, really interesting, because then you have a bunch of people who bought shit in 2021 who now are above water, and they start doing silly shit all over again. And I don't know what it is. Maybe it's going to be dog with hat and cat with hat and wherever fucked up shit we come up with over the next 18 months to relieve fools of their money, but we'll do it, and it's going to be fun.
01:01:23.404 - 01:01:47.056, Speaker A: And I think it's just beginning. This is just the start. And if you think about the ETF as this factor that's contributing all this capital, the way that people allocate to these funds, like Blackrock and fidelity, it's through retirement account. It's sticky flows. It's not like they're gonna go in. They had to go into work. They had to fill out a fucking form from HR, hand it back.
01:01:47.056 - 01:02:13.740, Speaker A: Like, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick. Which one do we want? You want to choose? Like, you're not. You ain't fucking doing that shit because bitcoin went down 25%. Like, you're too busy in your fucking tick tock. Look at thirst traps. So I think, like, the flows are sticky, and they won't be sticky forever, but we'll get to a plateau of a level where, okay, everybody has allocated what they're going to allocate, and now they're a little bit more price sensitive. Okay, maybe the price drops, you start selling things, but we're not even in the.
01:02:13.740 - 01:02:42.984, Speaker A: At that point right now. This is just the start. You've just started to see, you know, bald motherfuckers like Larry Fink going on CNBC talking about, like, fiscal responsibility and all sorts of other bullshit that we've been banging on drums for the last, like, 15 years. Like, the sales force is just starting around the world of, hey, put your assets here, we'll protect you against inflation. Obviously, I have my issues with that, but that's the narrative. It's working. It's the best selling product ever for the ETF providers.
01:02:42.984 - 01:02:53.580, Speaker A: They're going to do more of it, whether it's Ethereum or Solana or whatever, all coins. We're just getting started. We haven't even gotten to the fun stuff yet. People are just getting back above water.
01:02:53.712 - 01:02:53.980, Speaker C: Right?
01:02:54.012 - 01:03:06.704, Speaker A: So it's fun, but it's just the beginning. So don't think that you're, you know, you maybe made ten x on some shitcoin that you bought and you sell. By now it's just going 1000 times higher like this. Not even there yet.
01:03:07.204 - 01:03:15.652, Speaker E: What's your over under on ETF products? Ethereum, Solana, and then everything else after that over the next two years, I.
01:03:15.668 - 01:03:17.844, Speaker A: Think as many as they can get out, they will.
01:03:17.964 - 01:03:18.244, Speaker C: Right?
01:03:18.284 - 01:04:00.380, Speaker A: And so whatever the. The framework is that whoever the new SEC chair puts out for these us regulated institutions, they're going to maximize it. They've just made so much money listing bitcoin. It's not that hard. I'm sure they have their qualified custodians or whoever it is, whether it's Coinbase now, you have the banks lobbying the regulators in the US, be able to custody crypto. They're looking at why the fuck should coinbase get all this revenue from our club? We should be getting the money on holding these crypto assets. So now the banks are involved, everybody wants to take their little cut of this ecosystem on the tradfiization of bitcoin.
01:04:00.380 - 01:04:30.232, Speaker A: So I think they're going to try to list as many assets as possible because it's extremely profitable to do so. It's not an ideological thing. Whether they believe bitcoin is better than ethereum. And the other one, it's money in, they charge 20 bps or whatever it is on their product, and, you know, they grows and they get a bonus and they're, you know, go there fucking by their house at hamptons or whatever they do. So I think we just get more and more and more of these products. Whether or not they're successful at a certain point, will it reach saturation, and they won't be successful anymore, but we're doing it.
01:04:30.328 - 01:04:34.684, Speaker D: Is there a downside of this, though, of, like, the institutions buying up all our bitcoin?
01:04:35.824 - 01:05:16.414, Speaker A: Well, it's. If you look at the asset markets today, passive investing, taken to an extreme, and right now it is at an extreme, is entirely terrible for price discovery. What stock goes up the most? The stock that's highly valued. It doesn't mean the stock earns its rate of return. It just has to have a price that goes up. So if I'm allocating a percentage of my portfolio to s and P 500, the stock that's worth the most gets the most money, not necessarily the stock that has the best return. And so you see the dispersion of returns, evaporate price discovery evaporates and everyone just buys queues and spies.
01:05:16.414 - 01:05:38.804, Speaker A: Right. And so passive investing is a cancer when it gets to where it is right now in tradfi. Yeah, we'll get to the same point in crypto where, you know, these top twelve fund managers own, you know, 20 or 30% of the supply of crypto. I don't know. We'll see what we do when that happens. I guess it's up to the community. The whole point of this is that anyone can join.
01:05:38.964 - 01:05:54.424, Speaker D: I was thinking about it. Less in the light of number go up technology, more in the light of your original stablecoin thesis of, look, someone picks up the phone, calls, canner shuts down tether tomorrow. Is there anything in the back of your head where you're thinking about that with bitcoin and Blackrock, or that risk has failed? No.
01:05:55.124 - 01:06:14.724, Speaker A: Well, I mean, what would they do if Blackrock sell you bitcoin? Okay, cool. Then the price goes down. Whatever. We've had 95% price correction in bitcoin before. Is that like, okay, cool, we'll have another one. And the new price, the new floor, is $100,000 bitcoin rather than, you know, 20,000 or whatever it was 16,000 this cycle.
01:06:14.764 - 01:06:45.026, Speaker E: So I think what you, what you said about this, look, when I was a paraphrase, like, defi fell closer to, like, what could be most problematic, or even some, like, tether. But it's just, your point's an excellent one, I think, which is it just got to a point where just too big to shut down. And, like, as you know, what is the motivation to, like, shut down bitcoin ETF? Yeah, like, I just, like, I think, like, lobbies and, I mean, Blackrock is.
01:06:45.050 - 01:06:52.722, Speaker A: The US financial system. You don't just shut down. Larry. Yeah, he's making the most money. Yeah, fucking bitcoin ETF, like you, a.
01:06:52.738 - 01:07:02.306, Speaker E: Couple of rock and Nvidia are now more interesting and more important than the fed. I mean, it's just sort of like people listening to video earnings calls to higher degree.
01:07:02.330 - 01:07:16.562, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm done with macro for a while. Macro doesn't fucking matter, right? Fed cuts, fed hikes. Who gives a fuck, right? Tell me what that 03:00 p.m. Or whatever time it gets released ETF flow was. Every day is more important than what the fuck, J pal and Lagarde and all those motherfuckers do.
01:07:16.698 - 01:07:20.074, Speaker D: Yeah, arthur. What? Um, just going back to, like, this cycle.
01:07:20.154 - 01:07:20.762, Speaker B: Um.
01:07:20.898 - 01:07:43.634, Speaker D: All right, so, like, a typical cycle. Typical with quotes around. It was bitcoin led, flows into ETH, flows into degeneracy, flows into meme coins, top run it back four years later. This has been like, Solana runs, then, like, bitcoin runs, then we jump over to meme coins. How do you think about just, I don't know, how this cycle looks different than the last or how it looks similar.
01:07:44.134 - 01:08:01.588, Speaker A: Well, I mean, let's bear in mind people lost a lot of money in 20, 2021 to 2023, right? So people are just starting to, like, get their mojo back. So maybe that will be the cycle. We're not even. Solana is what, 110 or whatever it got, it peaked at 250.
01:08:01.716 - 01:08:02.004, Speaker C: Right?
01:08:02.044 - 01:08:06.556, Speaker A: ETH's not at its all time high in price terms yet. Bitcoin's not at its all time high. It's close to it.
01:08:06.700 - 01:08:06.980, Speaker C: Right?
01:08:07.012 - 01:08:46.314, Speaker A: So we don't know what happens when all these coins recover to where people have bought them. In 2021, you have all the FTX back holders are, you know, crying, crying the blues, because they got. They got struck at the lows of the market, right? So it's going to take a lot of time and capital to make people feel rich again to start buying. I mean, I guess there was alien punks that sold for some crazy amount of ETH. I've got ether rocks, so hopefully the rocks go up, too. So, I mean, I think when we start seeing jpegs flying again, then we're now, okay, this feels like what we're after, but I think we don't think we're there yet. People are still butthurt, like, oh, no, there's going to be a big correction.
01:08:46.314 - 01:09:09.454, Speaker A: Oh, no. Bitcoin can't just slice through the all time high. It's happening sooner than I thought. But again, people lost a lot of money. The major institutions of crypto failed and went under. We're still not psychologically there, at least on a median level, to believe that this is the start of the bull market. People are still in disbelief.
01:09:09.894 - 01:09:39.046, Speaker E: What are the sectors that get you most interested from an investing standpoint? Is it crypto AI narratives that are new as opposed to narratives that are old, like Defi and Gamefi are really hurt. And so they probably have more resistance going up because there's a bunch of back holders that are going to sell along the way as they go back to par. Or are you more excited about just new stuff, like crypto AI and all.
01:09:39.070 - 01:09:39.702, Speaker C: That kind of stuff?
01:09:39.758 - 01:10:07.274, Speaker A: I mean, so the AI thing. AI is tough. It's hard to make money in AI, I think, on a longer term basis, I'm an exchange guy. I've made my money in exchanges. I love exchanges. I think the one thing, and guy and Athena working on this as well, is the interest rate market is ten times bigger than FX trading market. We're just starting to see that market with how Athena and Pendle interact and Etherfi and Eigen layer points and all these things.
01:10:07.274 - 01:11:04.800, Speaker A: Now, I'm super bullish on. Obviously, I own a lot of pendle. I think that Pendle or whoever captures the interest rate trading of crypto and builds a bedrock of those products is going to be trading multiples of what binance is doing today on a centralized, true fashion, just because the most liquid futures contract in the world is not the s and P 500, it's the euro dollar futures contract. I don't know how many quadrillions of notional it trades every year, but it's the bedrock of Pax Americana's us dollar reserve system. Is that futures contract. What is the one for crypto? Is it going to be something Athena, the EUSD ApY and Pendle, something or other like that? I don't know, but I'm excited about that because it's a segment of the market that not very many people understand. Because, you know, the interest rate markets and money markets, it's kind of complicated and opaque, and they made, you know, the authorities make it opaque for a reason, how fucked up it is.
01:11:04.800 - 01:11:23.952, Speaker A: But at the end of the day, I'm super excited about that, because it's not well appreciated. I know where it goes in the trad five sense. We're going to move there, just like, you know, derivatives. When I started in 2013, no one treated derivatives, few here and there. Now Druid is. Is the majority of all trading volume. I think we're going to see this.
01:11:23.952 - 01:11:50.982, Speaker A: It's only the FX pairs. What about the interest rates? We have a native yield in ETH now we have restaking. Eigen layer is the hottest project of this cycle so far. Right? And what is it? It's taking that yield bearing asset and using it to secure other apps. This is going to be the biggest thing, I think, in this cycle is us starting to appreciate what interest rates mean. We have a natively yielding asset like Ethan that's powering, obviously something like Athena. And so that's what I'm super excited about.
01:11:50.982 - 01:12:02.714, Speaker A: And yeah, I love that kind of stuff. And I'm an exchange guy and markets person, and I think that's something that I'm going to be sinking my teeth into over the next 18 to 24 months.
01:12:03.974 - 01:12:07.950, Speaker D: Guy two years from now, who's the biggest customer of Athena?
01:12:08.022 - 01:12:09.638, Speaker B: Is it traditional funds who want the yield?
01:12:09.686 - 01:12:20.444, Speaker D: Is it crypto funds? Is it that I saw you guys are doing this go to market thing with l two s? Is it the users of l two s? Or I guess the l two is the customer here who's the biggest customer of Athena?
01:12:21.184 - 01:13:16.886, Speaker C: Yeah, I imagine it's probably a centralized exchange as a user of our product and then distributed to their users. I think all those different pockets that you outlined there are interesting, and they change through time. So I think crypto funds are probably the lowest down on that list where they can actually do this trade themselves, unless they're actually taking the tokenized issuance of it and then using it broadly throughout DeFi. I think that they find it less interesting because they do do this themselves and sometimes more efficiently because they dont have to do it at such a large size. I do think the piece that you get into, though, was the tradfi element, was something that I was actually quite surprised about as were going through this process now of trying to find capital to come into Athena, which is because youve actually replaced the underlying assets sitting within a smart contract, and its sitting within institutional grade custodians that tradfi is actually used to. So a fire blocks copper. All those types of entities, they can actually engage with this in a way that they couldn't by leaving money within the smart contract.
01:13:16.886 - 01:14:08.454, Speaker C: I've been pretty blown away, I think, by just the types of entities that are coming in from tradfi. And just looking at this as a very interesting packaged dollar instrument to capture crypto yield in a single click. When that becomes incredibly interesting, I think, is actually when rates in the real world start to fall from five to four to three, because you've got to remember, Athena's product here is actually competing with what is actually, historically in the last ten years, a pretty high risk free rate. The moment that this product actually really shines is when rwas fall from five to four to three. The rates on this product are actually negatively correlated to rates in the real world. And so thinking about this as like a large, scalable dollar denominated instrument where youve got negatively correlated yields, thats actually incredibly compelling to track by people who sit outside of crypto as well. And if you can package that up in a safe and secure way, I think people are underestimating the size of the flows that can come from that.
01:14:08.454 - 01:14:10.294, Speaker C: Nice.
01:14:12.034 - 01:14:20.414, Speaker D: Cool, guys. I think that's about it. Um, guy, anything we missed on Athena? Arthur anything we missed on Athena or just general market sentiment that you want to share?
01:14:21.194 - 01:14:27.894, Speaker A: I mean, fuck it. Bull market. Let's fucking go. It's party time, bitches. That's how we're ending it.
01:14:28.394 - 01:14:34.956, Speaker D: Guys, appreciate you coming on, man. Congrats on everything with Athena. Arthur. Appreciate your thoughts as always.
01:14:35.090 - 01:14:39.432, Speaker C: Um, thanks for coming on, guys. Thanks for coming on, guys.
