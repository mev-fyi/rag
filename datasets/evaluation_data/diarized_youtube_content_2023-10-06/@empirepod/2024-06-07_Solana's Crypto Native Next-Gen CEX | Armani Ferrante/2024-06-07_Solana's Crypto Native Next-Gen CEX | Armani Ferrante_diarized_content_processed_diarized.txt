Welcome to the show, man.
00:01:56.958 - 00:01:58.798, Speaker B: Hey, guys, how's it going? Thanks for having me.
00:01:58.926 - 00:02:20.330, Speaker A: Yeah, good, man. Good. Good to have you here, Armand. I want to start off. So Santiago is an investor, so maybe he can help take us a lot deeper than I can go. But I actually am kind of an outsider to, like, I own some mad lads and stuff, but like, an outsider to really what? You guys are building a backpack from an outsider's point of view, like thinking about Armani, the builder. You launched anchor, the framework.
00:02:20.330 - 00:02:33.074, Speaker A: You launched Mad lads, the community. You launched backpack, the wallet, and then you launched the exchange. So I'd love to get your, like, high level view of what? Like, what is Armani building here?
00:02:33.694 - 00:02:51.554, Speaker B: Yeah, great question. So I think there's multiple parts. I think of the, of the stack. You know, Anchor naturally is a smart contract framework. That's really, you know, the customers, you know, it's a developer toolkit. Mad ads is an NFT profile pic. It's an NFT community.
00:02:51.554 - 00:03:24.198, Speaker B: Community in a super genuine sense of the word. A backpack is really the consumer product that's really the force that we're putting behind, the company behind. And what it really is is it's an entry point into crypto. A lot of people like to talk about super apps. They like to talk about these ones, soft shops. Backpack truly is, in the most meaningful sense of the word, your entry point into crypto, namely through the substrate of custody. It's like you want to own crypto.
00:03:24.198 - 00:04:04.412, Speaker B: No matter how you want to own crypto, it's the best place to do it. And the ultimate goal is to be able to own crypto on any chain, whether it's self custody, whether it's a ledger, whether it's a 24 seed phrase, or whether it's a centralized exchange and you want to use an account. And that's, I think, at a very high level, what we're trying to do with backpack and the way that's operationalized, we can go down a bunch of different rabbit holes. But today, that's where we're at, and there's a bunch of stuff that we're building in terms of the next year of backpack, but that's more or less where we are today.
00:04:04.548 - 00:04:27.507, Speaker A: Nice. Let's talk about the exchange. Every cycle there's a new exchanges have been the best business model historically in crypto. The last decade, there's no better business model than an exchange. And every cycle there's a new exchange that rises to the top. You could say, what, 2013, 2015, you've got Coinbase 2017. Binance came along unseated.
00:04:27.507 - 00:05:00.200, Speaker A: Coinbase 2021, you could say FTX came into that seed. Obviously, it was fraudulent, but it did become the top exchange. I think when I talk to people, and I think the thesis for a lot of the investors was, look, backpack is going to be that exchange this cycle. How do you think about building a crypto exchange and, like, go as deep as possible here? Like, how is it going to be different? Like, what is the strategy, customer acquisition? Like, would love just, like, get all the brain dump of your thoughts on building an exchange?
00:05:00.392 - 00:06:23.738, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a great question. So there's a bunch of different ways to tackle this question, but I think, you know, at a high level, maybe just give you some moral context on how I think about exchanges. I think the exchange is one really important piece into the app, but it's really an auxiliary component. In the same way that a wallet is an auxiliary component to an l one, where an exchange and a wallet, these things aren't very useful unless the underlying l one is flourishing and has a vibrant, successful ecosystem. And that's our view of the world. I think we are pretty different in the exchange world in the sense that we are coming from the on chain world and then going and building out this really important tool to grow l one ecosystems and to kind of encourage self custody and to kind of make innovative crypto products, which is maybe a bit of a different perspective than starting with the exchange and then going on chain. But if you rewind, let's say a year ago, which I think is when we decided to go down this path, and you look at the exchange opportunity, on the one hand, if you aren't really super familiar with the exchange business model, you might look at the landscape and think to yourself, oh, wow, it's quite competitive.
00:06:23.738 - 00:07:02.214, Speaker B: You have to be crazy to go build an exchange. But if you dig a bit deeper, there's some quite interesting insights that I think, I mean, the exchange opportunity was pretty obvious, but actually how to execute on the exchange opportunity is actually quite subtle, and it's this really weird mix of skills. You need to have really good engineering. Obviously, you need to be able to figure out how to actually solve these really important problems. Changes are notorious for being hacked. FTX was, you know, we all know what happened there. I don't need to relitigate that.
00:07:02.214 - 00:07:28.882, Speaker B: And there's this enormous kind of, like, trust minimization problem that no exchange really has solved in meaningful way. But that's just like one part of the problem. Right. You also, I think, in the wake of FTX, need to have that kind of compliance piece really figured out in a really mature way. And this is really the thing that scared the hell out of me, out of building an exchange. I'm an engineer. I'm a product person.
00:07:28.882 - 00:08:39.874, Speaker B: I love marketing and community and being loud on crypto Twitter. I'm not a lawyer, I'm not a compliance expert. There is a rich history of people building crypto exchanges, some successful, some not, that have basically ignored this piece altogether. We obviously all saw what happened with finance and how Czada had to step out. And I think it's my view that the days of a founder who's maybe a good programmer or a good product engineer or whatever, starting one of these crypto exchanges without the compliance piece figured out, I think those days are mostly over, and it's basically precipitated by FTX. Every kind of regulator for good reason is really on the edge of their seats, really paying attention to the world. And on the one hand, I think it's kind of unfortunate in the sense that it's really hard to build one of these startups now, but on the other hand, it's obviously quite great in the sense that the world has to level up and we have to mature as an industry.
00:08:39.874 - 00:09:55.922, Speaker B: These types of things that once just shrugged off are now kind of important. And it's my view that as a result, the crypto world, or startups in crypto are going to run into like two different kind of are going to fall into two different buckets. They'll either be totally centralized, like us, where you've fully regulated your license, your money transmitter, maybe, whatever it might be, you're a licensed Vasp in whatever jurisdiction you're operating, or you're going to be fully decentralized. You're going to be operated on a super decentralized network with a bunch of independent nodes. Maybe you're an immutable smart contract, something that really represents the best of the space, things like uniswap and other really pioneering OG defi protocols like that. Anybody that's caught in the middle is going to be in this weird spot, in my view, where they're not trust minimized, they don't follow any of the rules. And it's my view that it's only a matter of time between they either get squeezed out of existence for one way, shape or form.
00:09:55.922 - 00:10:44.264, Speaker B: Either they're fragile in the sense that they explode, or they don't comply with the rules and they get regulated out of existence. I think that middle spot is a really bad place to be. And so for me, if we were going to build a centralized exchange, this piece had to really get checked off. It's like, how do we do it and do it right and do it kind of with the sophistication of building like a Wall street financial institution. And it's really easy to say that in a negative light, like everybody hates Wall street or whatever. What I really mean by that is being able to comply with the legal framework that financial institutions have to operate in different parts of the world. The reason for this is really simple.
00:10:44.264 - 00:11:49.448, Speaker B: The reason why centralized exchanges are so valuable and have such enormous distribution is because they are the very first touch point that bridge people from one economy into the crypto economy, from traffi and to DeFi. And they are uniquely positioned, unlike any other product, really, to be able to bring all of that value back and forth between those two economies. And obviously, if you want to be able to interact with that value in the traditional economy, if you want to be able to have great Fiat rails, have client money accounts with banks, be able to trade not only crypto assets, but, you know, also stocks and bonds and real estate or whatever it might be, right. You need to be able to operate inside of that compliance framework. And to me that's really important. Like, you know, foundationally, I view the space, you know, I view crypto as like, you know, eating Wall street in the same way that, like, software ate the world. Right.
00:11:49.448 - 00:12:52.728, Speaker B: We, you know, ultimately, if crypto is really going to succeed, you know, every piece of financial plumbing, every piece of financial infrastructure has to be built on crypto rails. It's this really important part in the product landscape to not only focus on decentralization and not only focus on this parallel crypto economy, but to also bring all that stuff into the traditional economy as well. I think this is a foundational kind of view with, like, going after the change space. And so I think, like, that is like maybe the beginning of the conversation of like, you know, those things become being really important. And then obviously, you know, when FTX collapsed, a lot of people kind of saw that as a huge void that was ready to be filled. And actually executing on that on that is actually very difficult. And that's like maybe the next part of the conversation.
00:12:52.728 - 00:12:53.960, Speaker B: But I guess I'll stop there.
00:12:54.072 - 00:12:55.924, Speaker C: Yeah, why don't we just go there?
00:12:56.744 - 00:13:32.842, Speaker B: Sure. Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, I think firstly, if you want to execute on the exchange opportunity, obviously you need to have the engineering chops and I think need to be able to build a really kind of reliable, robust web two system that's up, kind of up twenty four seven and never goes down, but has to be really fast. Right. And like, you know, with the, you know, requirements of a modern financial institution. But I think that the thing that's, I think unique is like, well, you also now have to start layering on all this, like cryptography and stuff like that.
00:13:32.842 - 00:13:59.684, Speaker B: And all this stuff's kind of interesting and unique. And then there's a compliance piece that's like, interesting and unique. Most people have like one or two of those, but then the third piece, which I think is pretty challenging, is the distribution piece. And that's really having all three of these things together is really unique. Most people have two or three. Most people honestly have one. Very few people have all three of them.
00:13:59.684 - 00:14:47.284, Speaker B: And the distribution piece in the go to market, I think, is something that is unlocked in a couple of key ways. So I think there's obviously unique product. I think that's the most traditional way that people go to market. I think what's really, I think, unfortunate, but just the reality is that the barrier to entry to building a centralized exchange is so high that that, unfortunately, is a source of edge and is a very real way to differentiate yourself. A small example of this is just what we're doing in Japan. We moved here very intentionally because it's really hard to get license here. It's really, really hard, and the bar is really high.
00:14:47.284 - 00:15:31.968, Speaker B: And it's not that common for an American to come and move Tokyo and set up office here and hire a japanese team, and not only a japanese team, but a team that actually knows the process and how to actually build out the centralized exchange here. And so I think that's an unfortunate reality. And then I think another piece is just the international nature of crypto exchanges. And this is maybe the part that is super. It's invisible to most people. So I'll make an assertion that I don't mean to be mean or insulting or anything, but, like, you know, I'm an American. I love the US.
00:15:31.968 - 00:15:54.736, Speaker B: I will probably live in the US. That's, again, at some point in my life. But if you're building an international crypto exchange, you have to live next to your customers. You have to. If you're not living next to your customers, you're not doing it right. You're just leaving value on the table. Like, little things like tweeting when your customers are awake are really important, let alone being able to speak the language.
00:15:54.736 - 00:16:13.828, Speaker B: And, you know, whether it's japanese or, or Chinese or Cantonese or whatever. And so I think that's another element that's really unique to our team in the sense that, like, we have a bunch of people that are super international, that are from different parts of the world. And so we're able to, like, go to these local markets in ways that I think a lot of teams have trouble with.
00:16:13.956 - 00:16:36.210, Speaker C: Armani on that point, I want to double click on Japan. It's a very unique market and very crypto native. I think a lot of the spot bitcoin, the penetration of crypto in Japan is high, similar to Korea, but they're very particular. Bitcoin is very strong. Some of the other assets are not so much. What was the rationale for going first to Japan? Being a market that is so hard to crack into and very unique and.
00:16:36.242 - 00:16:43.698, Speaker A: Localized before you do that, Armani. What are the two? There's coincheck and Bitflyer. Are those the two exchanges in Japan?
00:16:43.866 - 00:16:48.814, Speaker B: Yeah, those are the two real, quite large, quite successful exchanges.
00:16:49.324 - 00:16:56.988, Speaker C: And by now, I think, took forever. I don't know if they are actually even licensed at this point, but they were working on it two years ago, I believe.
00:16:57.036 - 00:17:08.892, Speaker B: That's right. That's right. Yeah. I mean, I think, firstly, Tokyo is just this, where I am right now. Tokyo is just like one of the best cities in the world. It's incredible. People like, I have this conversation, people are like, oh, why'd you do that?
00:17:08.908 - 00:17:09.260, Speaker C: Or whatever.
00:17:09.292 - 00:17:26.892, Speaker B: And I'm like, well, just come here for a weekend and you'll see why. It's just like, it's beautiful, it's safe, it's clean. There's so many smart people. Um, it's just, it's like, it's just amazing. Um, uh, as you said, it's super crypto native. I think it has a very progressive crypto culture. Um, and so it's really exciting on that front.
00:17:26.892 - 00:18:01.304, Speaker B: Um, I think we've very unexpectedly have been able to hire a lot of really, really smart people here, um, which is, I think was probably the. I thought it would be hard just because, you know, it's like, you know, as a, as a, as a foreigner or whatever. And so that's been, like, super pleasantly surprising. I think what's really unique about Japan is a couple of things other than obviously all the stuff that you mentioned. Quite a unique culture as well. Listing tokens is very unique here in the sense that you only get a couple shots on goals. Heavily throttled.
00:18:01.304 - 00:19:01.264, Speaker B: They have this whitelist of sorts where if you want to list a token in Japan, you have to basically get it approved. It's not till about two or three exchanges have the same token approved that the third or fourth one can come along and list it without approval. The number of tokens that are on exchanges here in Japan, it's actually way less than in other parts of the world. I think the other thing in Japan is a really strong admiration and respect for its institutions. I say this as a foreigner, so what do I know? But I think what's unique, and what's pretty consistent, just based on the people I've spoken to, is that the licensing piece is really important here. And so unlicensed offshore exchanges tend to not do really well here. And so if you're going to go to market in Japan, you have to do it.
00:19:01.264 - 00:19:43.394, Speaker B: You have to button up and do everything kind of bespoken by the rules here. And so I think that was kind of, we basically thought, okay, well, if we're going to do it, then this is kind of how we have to do it. And I think the other thing is just like, it's just a big market. It's like one of the largest countries in the world by GDP. And that obviously makes it exciting. I mean, there's the two kind of competitors, but I think generally in the exchange landscape, there's just not a lot of competition. I think in a sense, like there's not a lot of people competing at a very high level.
00:19:43.394 - 00:19:52.154, Speaker B: There's a lot of exchanges, obviously, but not a lot that are kind of really going toe to toe with the largest kind of exchanges in the space.
00:19:52.734 - 00:20:06.154, Speaker C: Maybe this is a good of a pause to just get your thought process into the decision. Building an exchange, centralized exchange at a moment where, yes, we all felt that there was a gap because FTX was a good product.
00:20:06.824 - 00:20:07.760, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:20:07.832 - 00:20:37.554, Speaker C: I mean, people used it. It was a good product. Putting aside all the other stuff, one component is, I mean, it has all this level of efforts really high for centralized exchange. Right? You're talking about licenses you have to. Building distribution is really hard. It's not clear in many places. The other alternative is kind of go do build a competitor to uniswap and then build some on ramps by integrating with a bunch of partners and maybe kind of stitching it together like that.
00:20:37.554 - 00:21:06.094, Speaker C: The point that you made around owning the customer relationship, I mean, Coinbase is synonymous with crypto in the US. It has built such a powerful brand and people still use it even though fees are higher than other places. Why go, like, did that compute when you were thinking about was that even an option? Building a decentralized exchange? Do you think a decentralized exchange with some on and off ramp could ever approximate what a centralized exchange has from a customer relationship standpoint?
00:21:06.994 - 00:21:41.248, Speaker B: So I think it really depends on what role you're trying to play. I think decentralized exchanges are super important. I think there's certainly the future in many ways. I think obviously our product, the wallet in particular, it's a self custodial wallet. It's in the same app as the centralized exchange. You can interact with Defi and indexes in that way. I think there's a couple of things that are really important.
00:21:41.248 - 00:22:32.494, Speaker B: I think, firstly, there's a lot of decentralized exchanges now. I think there's tons of competition. I think that part of the world is really being taken care of really effectively by teams like us on Ethereum, Jupyter and others on Solana yeah, just generally a lot of really impressive people that are doing really great work. I think in the centralized exchange landscape, I think there's also a lot of really impressive people doing a lot of great work. I think there's less in terms of number of products that are, I think, solving all the problems that, in my view, need to be solved. And I think for a lot of us, you know, the centralized exchange is the first touch point into the industry. I don't know about you guys, but I bought my first eth, my first bitcoin.
00:22:32.494 - 00:23:08.588, Speaker B: It was on Coinbase. I didn't onboard with a self custodial wallet, and I didn't know what a ledger was. I didn't know what a mnemonic was. It wasn't until I got on a coinbase and used the app and got my first crypto that I eventually started learning about self custody. And that was that progressive kind of onboarding journey. And I think that is one of the most important things that a lot of exchanges are trying to do. But they're not doing it as integrated as they could be, and they're just best positioned to teach the world about self custody.
00:23:08.588 - 00:23:33.672, Speaker B: There's no place better. Coinbase made a really interesting decision, tons of respect for them. Brian Archdaug is incredible. No shade at them. They're the pioneers in the space. But the fact that they have their apps separated is something that I think is a really good example of one of the differences between us and them. For us, we want self custody to be inside of the same app.
00:23:33.672 - 00:24:07.700, Speaker B: Yeah, you can use the centralized exchange, you could use your exchange account. That's going to be a backbone of the product. But self custody is just as important, and it needs to be right there, front and center alongside the exchange. And so I think that's one big component. I think the second big component, other than coming to the exchange space with this on chain ethos, is wanting to actually go toe to toe with the largest financial institutions in the world. Like, okay, we're not there yet. We're certainly not there yet.
00:24:07.700 - 00:24:46.466, Speaker B: We have a long freaking way to go. But it's my view that particularly kind of, in certain parts of the world, you don't go and look at, just literally go look at a financial app, go look at your banking app, go to your favorite bank or trading product and compare that to Instagram, or compare it to TikTok or whatever. It's night and day in terms of the engineering quality and the design and the product experience. The reason for that is really simple. It's just that there's just an enormous barrier to entry, to. To building these things. It's quite literally impossible.
00:24:46.466 - 00:25:47.034, Speaker B: You need millions of dollars, you need decades of experience. You need relationships with all the right people to get into the right rooms, to have the right meetings, to get the right trust, to get the respect and time from the right people that will allow you to do these things that it's so hard to build these companies, and there's been a couple of them that have come in over the past decade or whatever, whereas, like Robinhood and whatever, but they are kind of like the exception. I think from my point of view, this is the other piece that nobody is really tackling, other than Coinbase. Coinbase is the only one that's really trying to go for that market and really trying to eat the traditional financial world. They're the only ones that have been able to go public that should be indicative of anything. There's so many people that tried and could have, but they just, for whatever reason, couldn't get to that. Like, they couldn't get their financial department to have the right auditing stuff in place.
00:25:47.034 - 00:26:40.234, Speaker B: To get to that next level is really important for the industry, for crypto to really take over. And I think that's one of the big places where everybody is just falling short. And it's not necessarily that they're falling short for any bad reason or whatever. I think a lot of people just haven't tried it or don't realize how important it is. And so we've kind of set up the exchange from day one with this goal in mind. And so we're doing, like, a lot of really hard things that require a lot of experience, like hiring, like, you know, really established and experienced auditors from, like, you know, day accounting firms and financial institutions, and not only exchanges and crypto, but also, you know, people that have done this stuff before. And so, yeah, I think that's the other big missing piece that I think is really important for the industry to get to the next level.
00:26:40.654 - 00:27:28.644, Speaker C: When I first used it and then heard the pitch from Christian, I felt and agreed with a lot of your point of view. There has been a lot of innovation in the exchange space. If you have the license, you can get away with a kind of crappy product, and that's the nature of the world. But it felt to me that you guys, having started with mad lads and, like, really under it was a sort of a very interesting. These guys really understand crypto. You're building it at a time where we have just more visibility in what the user really likes, meaning nfts felt like you have a deeper appreciation for that. But of course, as you say, you know, the, you have to do the, you have in crypto building in crypto, in the centralized world, regulated world, you have to sort of build for perfection.
00:27:28.644 - 00:27:55.210, Speaker C: It's not like, you know, in the capital requirements and the level of effort is higher than maybe like spinning up a competitor to Robinhood. Right. You know, when we were in the early days of parafy, Ben and I were of the mind that we had to build and use every single service provider, like not the second tier or the third tier. We had to use the best auditor, the best accountant, because. Because otherwise people discount you.
00:27:55.362 - 00:27:56.054, Speaker B: Right.
00:27:57.754 - 00:28:19.694, Speaker C: And so the question for you is, when you think about like, expanding and really servicing the next hundred million users, how much of that is, we just need to raise a ton of money and replicate what we've done in Japan and go elsewhere and convince regulators that we are legit and we have the best team to execute and make them feel safe.
00:28:20.684 - 00:29:18.574, Speaker B: Yeah, I think so. Maybe for some context, exchanges can use money unlike any other business. And it's not just like buying stadiums and hiring celebrities. Right. And we've seen plenty of that, obviously. And I guess there's like a time and place for that type of thing, although we're certainly not at that place or time. What you need the money for is for, you know, things like parking money in banks so that you can get licenses and hiring teams all around the world, offices, local compliance people, local customer support people that speak the language, people that are not just random people off of the street, but people that have done this type of thing before can actually build a real team that's familiar with the local country and the local laws and the local, you know, a compliance regime or whatever.
00:29:18.574 - 00:29:59.304, Speaker B: Every time you expand into a place, you have to set up all of this infrastructure and it's like, okay, it's like a couple million here, a couple million there. It's just absurd. It's so absurd that just nobody does it. And the way that it was done in the past with Coinbase and binance and FTX and all these others, is that they were just so early that they were lucky. They were just lucky that they got a jump on it. But the world, in my view, has changed now. You can't run that same playbook again.
00:29:59.304 - 00:31:08.534, Speaker B: It's like building a bank in the 1920s or whatever was a lot easier than in the 1930s. Or obviously, you look up until today and it's like the same story in crypto. And so, yeah, I think the barrier to entry is enormous. The ability to just spend capital is absurd. And so raising a lot of money is obviously really important, especially if you want to get to that next level, because you need to do things that not only build the product, but you also need to have all of these, kind of all these people with financial expertise and auditing expertise and security expertise, like an SRE, a security team, an accounting team, a financial team, a compliance team, not just a one country, but in Japan and the UAE and the US, in literally every country you can imagine. And so it's this enormous beast that is unlike really building a normal Silicon Valley startup or normal kind of defi startup, which is just super, I think, unappreciated until you've actually gone through it.
00:31:10.004 - 00:31:39.662, Speaker A: This episode is brought to you by, say, Sei's belief about the world, I think is a good one. They believe that the EVM is here to stay. Agree with that. They believe that the EVM is going to look kind of like what JavaScript ended up looking like in the web two world. Agree with that. They also believe that the EVM in its current iteration lacks a lot of the performance and scalability that developers need. So what Sei has done with their V two upgrade is they just introduced the first high performance, parallelized EVM into the market today.
00:31:39.662 - 00:32:05.854, Speaker A: They've got lightning fast block times and finality of just 390 milliseconds. What this does is it unlocks an entirely new design space with 100 x. The throughput of even some of the fastest EVM L two s on the market today. Save V two is now live on public Devnet with main net scheduled for Q two. You can stay up to date with, say, on X at say network. Sei network. Big things to say.

00:33:51.720 - 00:34:26.992, Speaker A: This episode is brought to you by Mantle Mantle's liquid staking protocol mantle LSP is a permissioned and non custodial ETH liquid staking protocol call deployed on the Eth L1 and governed by Mantle. Here's what you got to do. Step one, bridge me to the l two. Step two, put into top dapps for extra rewards. Lendl they've got 8% me loop APY, that's at app Lendle XYZ markets you've got circuit which is base plus boost APY is 6.8%. That's built on lendle. There's three steps to get started.
00:34:26.992 - 00:34:50.164, Speaker A: You gotta get the me on l one, you go to meth mantle XYZ stake. Step two, you bridge the me to an l two, that's bridge Mantle XYZ. We can put the links in the show notes. And step three, you can explore a bunch of different dapp opportunities for extra yield if you want to get that. So big thanks to mantle. And congrats to mantle on becoming the fourth largest liquid staking protocol. Already.
00:34:52.104 - 00:35:17.324, Speaker C: It has felt that most recently regulation is maybe at an inflection point, particularly in the US with this election cycle. As you think about expanding one, has it gotten easier to talk to regulators to get approved? Do you have you change your mind maybe on when you're, you know your strategy for the US in general?
00:35:20.184 - 00:35:40.684, Speaker B: Yeah. So I would say it's. I wouldnt say weve really changed our mind. I think our approach to the US is basically its a huge market, its where I grew up. We want to go into the US. It just takes an enormous amount of time and an enormous amount of money. You cant really short circuit it.
00:35:40.684 - 00:36:44.766, Speaker B: Furthermore, I think the US product is quite strong. I think Coinbase is quite good and I don't see any good reason for us to immediately go toe to toe with them. The market internationally is just as big or bigger. And so that's where we're starting, where we can kind of get a head start and start building a real business, get users, get a real product off of the ground, start growing and start snowballing, both letting our product grow, letting your user base grow, letting your resources, capital and team grow, so that when we're ready to go into the uS, we're kind of ready to go guns blazing and ready to really compete at a high level. And I think this snowball mechanism, for lack of a better word, is actually really important. When thinking about building an exchange, you really need to figure out how to prioritize because it's an enormous amount of resources and you can't go after the biggest market on day one. Right.
00:36:44.766 - 00:36:55.118, Speaker B: You have to figure out like what's the path for you to get from zero to like climb, climb, climb until you can eventually get to like really high level. And so that's kind of, you know, the game that we've been playing.
00:36:55.246 - 00:37:35.434, Speaker C: Yeah. I want to get an understanding of why you think you've won to date and how do you think about winning in this game you talked about? You mentioned earlier you're solving unique problems. Coinbase has expanded their product offering, quite interestingly, most recently with like base, for instance. And they've been very opinionated on becoming that place where your first interaction with crypto and then we want to guide you in an app store, kind of equivalent of entering web3. You guys have taken a different approach, but I want to hear for the benefit of our listeners, how you think about the steps you've taken and how your products different, why you're winning.
00:37:36.214 - 00:37:57.662, Speaker B: Yeah, great question. So, firstly, I wouldn't say we're, we've won by any means. I mean, we've won a couple. Yeah, we're trending in the right direction. I mean, it certainly doesn't feel like we've won. We have a very long way to go, the way I think about it. I mean, it's, I guess, like pretty trite advice.
00:37:57.662 - 00:38:32.878, Speaker B: Right. What we are doing and continue to do is to just focus on where we can be unique. And there's a bunch of different kind of elements of this. So the first element is just like starting with our core. It's like madlet community and Solana. This is where I think we have very unique distribution, unique background, unique storytelling, just moral friends and family that are in the ecosystem. This is a great place to start building a company and start building a product where you have a 10,000 pic profile, a profile pick collection of people all around the world.
00:38:32.878 - 00:38:54.364, Speaker B: That Madlads is unique in that it's really genuine. It's not like it's like an actual community. It sounds silly and dumb, but it really is. That's been a really great starting point. Just like, okay, just build a product for these people. There's two products that every NFT holder has. They have a wallet and they have an exchange.
00:38:54.364 - 00:39:21.406, Speaker B: And so that's been really just, I think, symbiotic relationship and think that thing, that was a unique starting point. And then you start there and then you keep expanding. We did it with the Solana ecosystem and rode that wave. I think Solana obviously was at $8 or whatever when post FDX collapse, and now it's at 170 or whatever. It peaked at 209 or whatever it was. This year, a bunch of tokens got launched. That was a bunch of listings.
00:39:21.406 - 00:40:03.934, Speaker B: That was a bunch of launch pools for us. That was a bunch of awesome product engagement where we had the mad lads helping the product and the product helping the mad lads and backpack, and that allowed us to start growing in other unique parts of the world. And I think that's been our approach to community. The exchange and the wallet is really unique in that our goal is ultimately just to promote and to help grow other projects, and we can do that in a really positive way. And so we're kind of like this cheerleader for the projects that we work with because it's a very symbiotic relationship.
00:40:05.714 - 00:40:30.932, Speaker A: So, yeah, Armani, will you tell me about the future of the exchange and how you think about adding more products to it? So you start with Solana assets. Then I saw you guys listed shuffle, I think it was, which is an eth token. So maybe you're now pushing onto ethanol. Then do you start to like, will you ever add nfts? Will you ever think about adding traditional equities? Tell me about the vision for the product side of the exchange.
00:40:31.108 - 00:41:48.094, Speaker B: Yeah, so the way I think about it is there's a couple different user segments that are pretty interesting to go after. I mean, firstly, we obviously went after where we had unique distribution, which is just okay, let's get every Solana backpack wallet user basically to use the exchange. And as we're doing that on the b and marketing side and getting listings, we start working on the next phase. And really that next phase expanding to the broader, I would say pro Sumer, more typical centralized exchange user, which is people that care a bunch about trading, people that care a bunch about having a diverse set of token products, people that care about futures and borrow lending and spot argin and all these things. And really recreating, in my view, like what made the FTX product really special. And you see this of Binance and OKX and Bybit, where they all kind of had their own go at recreating that product. But I think that continues to be a pretty important, I guess just a product that hasn't been properly reproduced.
00:41:48.094 - 00:43:00.404, Speaker B: I think that's a small way to expand the customer segment where it's no longer just about Solana Maxis or whatever, but now starting to think about the larger people that care about trading crypto more broadly. When you start thinking about trading product, it's all about one thing, it's all about capital efficiency, it's all about cost of capital, it's all about where's the optimal place for me to have my funds. An optimal place for you to have your funds is the place where it's a, most secure and b, can be used for the maximum amount of things possible. If those are your two design constraints, then that starts guiding a lot of the decisions and a lot of the way you start building. On the second point, the table stakes is just the large l ones, right? Solana ETH, bitcoin, you got to have those three chains, you got to have all the awesome projects that are part of it. I think for us, the wallet is a really integral part of the product. On the mobile apps, literally one app on the web, we have it natively integrated with the extension and the website.
00:43:00.404 - 00:43:59.734, Speaker B: We go after expanding the product offering with those two products in tandem. But the more tokens that you have, the better the trading product, and that's a basic informative direction. But then you start venturing into other products, perpetual futures, cross collateral system margin systems, borrow lending spot margin, etcetera. But then once you've gotten to that point, I think then the question is, what's next? And I think in my view, you know, one of the most important innovations in this space has just been stable coins. I mean, this isnt like particularly insightful. I think a lot of people agree with this. When you look at companies like Circle, what are they really? Circle is basically a centralized exchange that has one product, they dont have a trading product, they just tokenize dollars and put it on different blockchains and create and redeem through their centralized exchange.
00:43:59.734 - 00:45:44.094, Speaker B: They dont call it a centralized exchange, but its a centralized exchange. It does everything a centralized exchange does. And that by itself has probably been one of the most important innovations for crypto at large, whether it's USDC or USDT or any of these other stable coins that are tokenizing these real world assets or whatever you want to call it. I think this is really the unique thing that regulated centralized exchanges can do in a way that no other products can do, basically. And so I think given our kind of setup, given our, I think, skill set on the team and orientation, and just way like the problems we've chosen to solve, we're kind of heading in that direction where I think we will be able to, or we'll at least give it a go to try to tokenize a lot of really important assets and bring them on chain to create. People like to call talk about exchanges as liquidity hubs, but I think creating these very capital efficient environments where it's just way more just practical and also just productive and safe and just more convenient to have your money on in backpack, whether it's through the wallet or through the centralized exchange, that's ultimately the goal. And I think once you've done that, I think for a lot of maybe millennials or Gen zs or whatever, or Gen alphas or whatever the letter is these days, the centralized exchange starts becoming a financial hub in the same way that our parents thought about their banks or whatever.
00:45:44.094 - 00:46:04.766, Speaker B: I think that's ultimately the direction that a lot of, you know, I think that. That we're going, and there's gonna be like, a lot of work involved, a lot of challenges that we face. But I think ultimately, nothing beats crypto in terms of, like, the place to have your, you know, all of your finances. And so that's definitely the direction we want to go.
00:46:04.910 - 00:47:14.894, Speaker C: The way you describe the frustration with the financial system, which is like, it's not up to par with best in class Internet services. And my thesis for exchanges, particularly yours Coinbase, is that they will become the premier financial institutions, especially for younger generations, which are harder to capture, but once you have them, there's enormous amount of LTV there. How do you think about the users that you initially acquired? A lot of them were Madlad's holders deeply passionate community. In crypto, I think you have this phenomenon where the early adopters are easier to acquire and retain, but as you go and try to expand into other circles, it just becomes harder and harder. Maybe you're bumping into a user that is using Huobi or binance or OKX, and you don't have perps and they do, but you have launchpad and really unique distribution, especially in Solana. How do you think about expanding? And I'm curious, any insights you can share into what you're observing at the customer level, the interactions, what they're doing, the behavior? Are there any particular insights there that you found interesting over the last year?
00:47:16.364 - 00:48:11.734, Speaker B: Gothic I think there's maybe a couple ways to look at this in terms of user acquisition and getting to that next level. I think, firstly, building crypto products is really. It's not necessarily hard, it's not rocket science. If you're a good web two engineer, good web two product person, you can work in crypto and build stuff, stuff. But I think a lot of the skills and expertise and just foot guns and how to build secure, reliable cryptosystems at scale is pretty. There's not a lot of people in the world that can do that. If you think about maybe the first part of your question that what you were getting at.
00:48:11.734 - 00:49:19.784, Speaker B: I think as the industry grows, which I think we all continue to think it will grow as the products in the underlying ecosystems, whether it's Solana or ethereum or base or whatever, become more and more important, it's like rising tides, raises all boats. The institutions that are there to facilitate that economy grow alongside it. And there's very much, I think, network effects there in terms of not only capital and people and brand distribution, but also just in terms of actually just becoming part of the fabric of that economy and whether it's running validators and actually operating the networks to contributing the protocols to. A small example of this is our. It's just like anchor, right? It's just like every. You know, a lot of, I would say. I would say that the majority of smart contracts on Solana liberally have our company name in it or whatever.
00:49:19.784 - 00:49:58.560, Speaker B: And that's like a really small example that's like, maybe not super meaningful, but it's illustrative of the point of that. I think as the industry kind of grows and takes over and really starts to, in my view, it'll eventually dominate kind of traditional financial services. The institutions that were part of that will capture market share in the same way that Internet companies did with all the incumbents. And so I think that's definitely a big part of it in terms of going after the main entrenched, I don't know, archaic financial services businesses.
00:49:58.752 - 00:50:05.324, Speaker C: Yeah. Is having the stablecoin necessary to really get mainstream users?
00:50:09.004 - 00:50:14.584, Speaker B: I wouldn't say creating a stable coin is necessary. I would say having good stablecoin products. Absolutely.
00:50:16.524 - 00:50:18.504, Speaker C: Would you ever think of creating your own?
00:50:20.324 - 00:50:38.540, Speaker B: I think there'd have to be a really compelling reason to. I think getting distribution on them is really hard. It's close to impossible. I do think exchanges are the best places to get distribution. The first bd problem that you're probably going to solve when you're creating a stable coin is go find an exchange partner, just like circle.
00:50:38.652 - 00:50:57.624, Speaker C: The reason Athena Athena has gotten traction is because they're a great customer to exchanges. So they're going to get listed, they're going to have the distribution. Right. So if there's anyone out there that's going to create a competitor, USDC, maybe different denomination yen, or, you know, otherwise euro, it's probably going to be an exchange like you guys.
00:50:58.404 - 00:51:05.580, Speaker B: Yeah, no, that's, that's totally right. I mean, I think, I totally agree. It's not on the roadmap, but, yeah, wholeheartedly agree with the sentiment.
00:51:05.772 - 00:51:06.544, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:51:08.244 - 00:51:08.940, Speaker B: Go ahead.
00:51:09.052 - 00:51:26.544, Speaker C: Can you just make a comment or just talk about the launchpad? There's been really interesting projects that have launched in backpack. How important has that been to really entrench your position in the Solana ecosystem? And how do you see that going forward to get an edge over other exchanges, perhaps?
00:51:26.984 - 00:52:32.714, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's super important. I think ultimately, exchanges are in this really unique position where they own that customer relationship. They have that distribution to just a huge, broad audience in a way that very few projects do. I think it's really important to take that responsibility and to use it in a really productive, positive some way. And so I think we have just tried our best to create as much value and to extract this minimal amount of value from projects in the sense that our success is their success or their success is our success, I should say. And so that's kind of the view that we take to launchpads, and I think people have been really appreciative of that and it's been really successful. And we kind of were able to capture lightning in a bottle with it, in the sense that we got a bunch of people really excited about them, people in the larger kind of APAC region in particular, but all over the world, honestly.
00:52:32.714 - 00:53:01.138, Speaker B: And so I think it's a really important moment, not unlike NFT mints, where it's just one of the best opportunities for a project to tell their story and tell educate the world what they're building, why it's important, and to have this huge microphone to in an audience in a way that's really important and really special. And so, yeah, I think it's a really important moment for our projects and really important for our business as a result.
00:53:01.266 - 00:53:58.344, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I think binance executed this phenomenally well in the last cycle. Their launch battery projects have launched there, had a ton of distribution and attention out of the gate. It felt like that is like iOS have been like not as popular, I guess, for a variety of reasons. I'm curious, when you think about it felt historically that there's been some tension between the strategy of listing tokens. Some exchanges are really just kind of fast and prioritize that their users want it. Others have, like Coinbase have taken their time, but then they've also listed random tokens that it just felt like the strategy has been confusing, at least from my standpoint. How do you think about your strategy and is that something that you guys feel like you have a better understanding because you're closer to these teams, at least in Solana, and you're really entrenched in the community?
00:53:59.044 - 00:55:05.584, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I think that's more or less how we feel. I mean, I think we're very much in the trenches on the front lines. I think we were really lucky in the sense that a lot of the teams that came into the Solana ecosystem, we just met them on day one when they first came in. I think a lot of the wormhole team, a lot of the pith team, a lot of the drift team, the Zeta team, all these projects on Solana that are listing tokens and building really cool stuff. You know, I wouldn't like, you know, they would like, help me like build the anchor framework or whatever, you know, just like things that just didn't happen. So we were really lucky in the sense that we just knew a lot of folks. And so that really, I think, informed our listing process in the sense that, oh, we knew the really high quality builders that we're building really like substantive products and not just like, you know, just randomly trying to exit or whatever.
00:55:05.584 - 00:55:24.544, Speaker B: I think that's super important, not to say obvious. I think on the one hand, you want to be really fast, for sure. That's a unique product. You have to have your finger on the pulse. You have to know what people want. You have to know what your customers want ultimately, and the tokens that are exciting for them. That's ultimately the thing that guides your decision.
00:55:24.544 - 00:55:36.204, Speaker B: But, yeah, I think, like I said earlier, it's just we just want to be productive team players and the various ecosystems and be a reliable exchange partner.
00:55:38.104 - 00:56:01.604, Speaker C: I know you obviously are not just hi to Solana. You've mentioned other ecosystems, like Ethereum. They're very important. Bitcoin, others. I want to get your take on Solana. Why builder? Why focus there, especially at a moment where it was, as you pointed out, kind of abandoned post FTX? What did you see there, and what do you see there today that you find most interesting?
00:56:03.144 - 00:57:19.824, Speaker B: Yeah, I think, I mean, the thesis for Solana is very simple. And if you're a programmer, it's very easy to come to this conclusion if you're not a programmer. Solana is maybe pretty hard to understand, but it's very simple. It's like to put it in just normal layman's terms, like, do you want to use one tab on your chrome browser, or do you want to use multiple tabs on your chrome browser? Do you want to use one app at a time, just Chrome, or do you want to use Chrome and Spotify and your calendar app, and your settings app and your clock app and whatever. At the same time, parallelism is the most blatantly obvious thing to build, and it's really the only l one that has done it, I think at the scale that it has been able to do it, there's been a lot of really admirable attempts at it, I think. But I think they're really the first one to really go to market in prod with lots of users. And so I think if you during when FTX crashed, you'd see all this just crazy stuff.
00:57:19.824 - 00:57:57.804, Speaker B: It was like SBS chain or whatever. And it's like, no, SBF couldn't program a blockchain. It's like dependent on it. He's a trader, not an engineer. I think the thought process was really simple. If you believe that crypto is going to survive, do you believe that smart contract platforms are important? And then do you believe that parallel processing is important for such a smart contract platform? And if you believe any of those things, then really the only game in town is Solana. Ergo, you should keep building on Solana.
00:57:57.804 - 00:58:36.072, Speaker B: And I think that was kind of, there's some other stuff that I think is super important, like the community distribution. And that whole problem is pretty challenging because there are other, especially today, parallel execution environments like sweat and aptos, et cetera, and super excited about that as well. But at the time, Solana was really the only one that had a functioning crypto economy. And so it was pretty. I think on the one hand, it was non consensus, but it was just so obvious in my view, that I just keep going.
00:58:36.208 - 00:59:08.268, Speaker C: Yeah. On that point, for me at least, I was investing in Solana projects before the FTX collapse. Like, you know, Soland jet. Like, there's a few projects that I looked at was playing with orca, like, I look at radium, like I was playing with them. And then post FTX, I felt like the quality of projects. There was a point in time where I felt like, this is a very different project. The Defi ecosystem really took a different meaning for the better.
00:59:08.268 - 00:59:53.432, Speaker C: Like, the quality of apps improved dramatically to the point where, like, I was sending most people that were interested in crypto to Solana based apps, like, we always phantom existed for a while. Their product's gotten incrementally better. But you had, like, I was sending people to try, out of the three apps that I. Four apps that I would send, people would be backpack, Jupiter, Tensor, and maybe drip if they wanted to get something free on their hands. And I was like, wow. For me, that was a big aha moment. And I don't know, I'm still trying to pinpoint, like, was it bonk? Was it, like, what was it that happened behind the scenes? Because again, if you're not a developer in these ecosystems, I think you miss a lot of what happens under the hood.
00:59:53.432 - 01:00:24.284, Speaker C: And you might say, well, this was happening for the last three years. You just saw the tip of the iceberg. But I did feel that, like, you know, when, when especially, like, post FTX or some projects that really started to break and they weren't perfect. Maybe my observation is wrong, but I'm curious to get your perspective. Like, did you feel that there was a big inflection point, the quality of builders coming into Solana? Did the foundation do something? Was it bonk? Like, what was it?
01:00:27.264 - 01:01:11.260, Speaker B: I think, yeah, I don't really think that. Okay, maybe. I think there's a couple things that are simultaneously true. So I think, foundationally, Solana is unique in the sense that it's a very product first ecosystem. It's probably the closest thing to Silicon Valley in terms of blockchains, in my view. Like, the most amount of people that just are super pragmatic and just care about their users, they're, like, a lot less idealistic, I think, than other chains. And I think on the one hand, that's a really good thing in the sense that they care about the people that use their product and that's who you should care about.
01:01:11.260 - 01:01:53.218, Speaker B: And then it may be a bad thing in the sense that maybe, I don't know, that would be a bad thing, actually, now that I think about it. But some people think it's a bad thing, but I think it's super practical is the wrong word because it's almost like demeaning, but it's very product focused. And I think that's foundationally at its core. It's like if you want to build a good product, you have to have a fast blockchain. If you want a fast blockchain, use Solana. And so it just attracted all the people that wanted fast blockchains, if that makes sense. And then the people that cared about running a validator on their phone or whatever, there's like, you can, they did, they don't like Solana.
01:01:53.218 - 01:02:54.660, Speaker B: That's fully fine. So I think that's foundationally one ingredient. I think the second ingredient was that, well, it had a couple years, I think I came to Salana in 2020 at a couple years of just like baking, of cooking these projects that I mentioned, like pith, wormhole, uh, drift, Zeta, um, Jupiter. All of these teams were cooking for years. Like, these were not teams that just like randomly like saw, oh, you know, I'm going to rip a token, like randomly on a weekend. Like these are folks that have been doing startups, uh, for a very long time and doing these particular startups for at least, you know, since like, you know, 2020, 2021 or whatever, however long it's like on the order of like years. And I remember I was at NFT NYC like a year or two before the FTX collapse, and I was talking with some of the guys from Jupiter and they're like, yeah, we're going to do this.
01:02:54.660 - 01:03:21.004, Speaker B: We're going to do a Jupiter token or whatever. And they just launched it like a couple months ago or whatever. They put so much time and energy thought into everything. It's really incredible. And so I think there was a lot of that as well. That's like a second ingredient. Just like people were just cooking in the kitchen for so long and were really building real, I think, substantive kind of products and companies and protocols.
01:03:21.004 - 01:04:05.748, Speaker B: And then I think the third ingredient was just like maybe signal noise, FTX goes down. All the people that dont really have the chops or theyre just here for the bull run or whatever, theyre just here for I dont know why people come to crypto other than I guess, just come for the bull run or whatever, but if you're not here to build cool stuff, you're going to bounce immediately when something like that happens. And so I think you look around and it's like, oh, who's left? It's like, okay, the people that are left are the real ones. And I think that was a really important ingredient. And everybody says it. It's so trite, but it's also just so true. It's like you just like, focus and build like no other in a bear market.
01:04:05.748 - 01:04:15.542, Speaker B: And I think that was certainly true for us. But, yeah, I think that's my, my take, if you will, on, on what happened. I don't know.
01:04:15.718 - 01:04:32.594, Speaker C: Yeah, maybe I like to build her in the space and for folks that are listening or maybe building, or thinking about building, like, Juan, if you have to do it again, would you do it in the same manner? Would you be doing it? Would you be doing something else? And what have been, like, the key learnings for you? What would you do?
01:04:33.314 - 01:04:39.134, Speaker B: That's a great question. I'm almost, like, afraid to give an answer to this question.
01:04:41.514 - 01:04:44.974, Speaker C: You haven't been afraid of any, so we have to get you on one.
01:04:45.354 - 01:05:26.144, Speaker B: Yeah, I feel like, I don't know how I feel about this. I would strongly consider being anonymous, I think. Yeah, I think I feel like not, I feel like there's this really a counterintuitive thing that's like, the more like, I tweeted this the other day, and it's not always true. Right. But it's like the more you share with people, the more opportunities they have to call you out for something. Let me give you a small example. We decided to, we have our code base for the wallet and we're like, oh, there's no open source wallet on Solana.
01:05:26.144 - 01:06:11.394, Speaker B: It'd be cool to do an open source wallet. We decide to checkpoint our code base, which has a bunch of private stuff in it, ops as the exchange on the mobile app and all this stuff, we just rip out all the stuff that we wanted to open source, a fully functioning chrome extension, put it on a public repo and make it a GPL license, and you're like, cool, awesome. We have a real consumer great open source wallet on Solana now. This is awesome. And it's your world. Please go check out the code, audit it, test it out. Stop complaining about no open source wallet.
01:06:11.394 - 01:06:46.574, Speaker B: You have one now, then what happens? It's just people just start shitting on you. For doing that. It's like, you're not doing it the right way. You're not actually open source. Like, you actually suck. You're actually a bad person because you're trying to, I don't know, free ride off of the goodwill that open source people give you or whatever. And I'm just like, okay, I've probably done more open source work on Solana than anybody other than the Solana core devs, but, okay, I'm a bad person.
01:06:46.574 - 01:06:59.954, Speaker B: And so just stuff like that, it's just like, it just, I think in crypto just so heightened that I think, you know, I think, you know, that FTX thing, obviously, it was just like an enormous, just like, when you guys.
01:06:59.994 - 01:07:10.018, Speaker C: Announced, when you guys announced the round, it keeps coming out. Every Bloomberg piece was like, you know, former FTX employees launch another exchange, and it was like, I'm sure it was attention grabbing.
01:07:10.186 - 01:07:13.778, Speaker B: They're calling me an executive. They like, alameda executive. So, like, what?
01:07:13.826 - 01:07:25.742, Speaker C: Like, to be fair, the, the beanbag, the guys, you guys, that picture that has been now used, and pretty much, I mean, you guys should get royalties. Yeah, it was like, yeah, so emblematic, but, yeah, yeah.
01:07:25.838 - 01:07:55.914, Speaker B: Anyway, I digress, but I feel like there's not a ton of upside of having your identity revealed in crypto. So I would strongly. I used to hate being anonymous, too. I was just like, I'm not being anonymous. I have nothing to hide, and I still have nothing to hide. I'm, like, an honest, like, good person. I'm just gonna naively believe that everybody's like, you know, equally as, as, but.
01:07:55.954 - 01:08:17.534, Speaker C: To be fair, other, other than Satoshi, you've never, like, the most successful teams in crypto. It feels like a necessary evil and burden that a founder has to just embrace. As you said, it's not easy to build. I sympathize with founders and crypto. You, when the token goes up and the projects doing well, it's like, yeah, obviously that's your responsibility. As soon as there's some deviation that you're the scapegoat, like, you're on the.
01:08:18.314 - 01:08:41.054, Speaker B: Yeah, the analogy. I talk with the team about this a lot because they'll, like, pay attention. They'll see something on Twitter, and then I'll be like, oh, you need to, like, not pay attention to Twitter. And what I like to say is like, you know, to, like, you know, imagine you're, like, walking down the street and you, and somebody, like, screams at you. I don't know if it's like, you know, maybe they're on drugs. Maybe it's a criminal. Maybe it's somebody who just had a bad day.
01:08:41.054 - 01:09:02.507, Speaker B: I don't know. But like, you know, these things happen, right? Living in San Francisco, it's like this thing's like part of life. I don't know either. You've been stuff recently. I love San Francisco, but it is really insane. Some of the things that happen over there. But you never stop and think to yourself, oh, you know, that person just screamed at me when I was walking to work or whatever.
01:09:02.507 - 01:09:41.534, Speaker B: I'm going to stop and spend the rest of my day thinking, why did that person scream at me when it's just like, I don't know, some crazy person or whatever. If you're walking in SF or whatever, and I don't mean to be like, insulting people sf, but that has happened to me just so many times. It's just a really great analogy, but that's basically crypto, Twitter. It's like all these people that would just call you the worst possible things you can imagine. And it's these just like, it's almost like it's really hard to not get distracted by it. And I think it slows. I think it really turns off a lot of really good builders.
01:09:41.534 - 01:10:10.264, Speaker B: Um, I think it's actually one of the biggest problems, probably. It's just like a lot of really good people just don't want to go into crypto for like, this reason. It's like, it's. You just get thrown into the mix with all these, like, you know, whether it's like criminals, like, you know, like in the case of FTX or whatever, or just, you know, just people that are anonymous calling you a criminal, it's like, it's tough. So, anyway, not super interesting, but. But maybe that's the one thing I would reconsider.
01:10:10.764 - 01:10:29.660, Speaker A: I think the best thing about. The best thing about the industry is also sometimes the worst thing. And you can't have it one way and not have the other, right? So you can't have the, like, I mean, the like, speed at which you guys were able to do customer acquisition could never happen if you didn't have the madness of crypto Twitter.
01:10:29.732 - 01:10:32.664, Speaker B: Yeah, totally. You're just right. You're totally right. Yeah.
01:10:34.054 - 01:11:02.816, Speaker A: Armani. Are there any good things like post FTX? Everyone always talks about, like, ah, like lessons learned, compliance, whatever. Don't be a fraud, etc. Etc. Like, are there any good lessons that you learned from FTX? Like, yeah, I mean, they were fraud. Like, so the context for this question is, I was with an investor who was one of the biggest investors on FTX. And he's like, look, like, say what you will about FTX and the fraud and Sam and all that kind of stuff, like, it was an amazing platform.
01:11:02.990 - 01:11:03.860, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
01:11:03.972 - 01:11:11.924, Speaker A: With a pretty small team. So, like, are there any product lessons that you took away? Like trying to ignore all of the fraudulent stuff? Any product lessons you took away?
01:11:12.084 - 01:11:59.680, Speaker B: Yeah, no, that's a great question. I mean, it's probably like a deeply uncomfortable question for most people because, like, the narrative is so, like one sided and as usual, I mean, the truth is somewhere in the middle. Right. There is certainly a ton of negative stuff, but it's also easy to forget. It was like literally the biggest startup of the last cycle. It attracted the best people, the most amount of talent, and that whoever you're referencing, I mean, I would directionally agree it was a great product with the small team. What are the positive lessons? I mean, I think the main thing is probably just like growth in crypto.
01:11:59.680 - 01:12:42.784, Speaker B: I mean, you saw it wasn't just FTX, it was also binance is the same thing. Right? Like, you can grow ten times faster than you think and ten times bigger than you think. Right. The growth at binance and the growth at FTX, those were like, those are, I mean, there are two examples of two kind of crypto exchanges in two different cycles, and it's easy to maybe look back on FTX and write it all off. But I mean, I think we've seen a lot of it ourselves where a lot of that growth was real. These are like real amazing businesses. And so I think that's certainly a big one.
01:12:42.784 - 01:13:18.444, Speaker B: I think, I would say this is a negative lesson that is positive from FTX, but I think another one other is just to focus on the things that matter. I think in my view, FTX started doing all this weird stuff at the end, sponsoring athletes and celebrities, all this crazy stuff, instead of just focusing on trading product or whatever. I think that's maybe another important lesson. It's just really focus on the things that your customers care about.
01:13:19.144 - 01:13:28.142, Speaker A: You saw Coinbase make the same mistake in the cycle, too, launching the NFT platform when they, and I think in the bear market, yeah, they acquired it.
01:13:28.158 - 01:13:31.594, Speaker C: And then they brought a product. I paid him a ton of money and the amount or nothing.
01:13:32.534 - 01:13:56.722, Speaker A: So that's great. That's great, though. Armani, how's the organization set up? Like, you guys have, you have like anchor that I don't know how much time you guys spend time on, but like, you've got the XNfT protocol you've got, like, backpack, the wallet, the exchange. You've got madlads, the community. Like, do you have different pods, essentially, or is everyone working on everything or how. Yeah. And, like, how big is the organization? How do you manage all this?
01:13:56.898 - 01:14:13.414, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Great question. So, like, the group is broken up into, like, you know, different teams, obviously, different functions that are kind of working on different things. So, like, you know, like, the wallet is, like, you know, a very clear team. The, like, you know, exchange compliance team is a very clear team.
01:14:13.714 - 01:14:21.314, Speaker A: So, like, on the wallet team, will there be, like, a marketer and a product person and engineers on the wallet, do you have, like, okay. Okay.
01:14:22.854 - 01:14:39.118, Speaker B: I mean, I'm kind of unique in the sense that, like, I'm, like, really the only PM. And so I, like, think about all of these things. Like, I think about marketing. I think about, like, you know, engineering. I think about product. And so I kind of, like, glue everything together in a sense. But, yeah, it's, you know, mostly kind of.
01:14:39.118 - 01:14:43.862, Speaker B: I, like, kind of thinking in terms of, like, products and, like, many startups.
01:14:43.878 - 01:14:50.304, Speaker A: In a company, how do you think that you build company like, the companies differently than other founders build?
01:14:51.884 - 01:15:32.914, Speaker B: I mean, I wouldn't say I was, like. I'm, like, particularly unique. I would imagine that our company is kind of would be similar to other companies that are started by people with similar backgrounds. I'm a programmer, so I like to think about building good engineering teams and giving them as much responsibility as possible. So just a bunch of really just senior engineers that basically have a bunch of trust and responsibility to make a bunch of really good decisions. And so they're kind of empowered to do large parts of the product. We don't have a lot of.
01:15:32.914 - 01:16:03.652, Speaker B: We don't have any PM's. I'm literally the only PM. We probably won't have any PM anytime soon. Similarly with design, although product design is super important, we have one really awesome one. So I think that's at its core. And then obviously, there's all the functions around it that are equally as important, that are just there to amplify the core engine, if you will. But I don't know.
01:16:03.652 - 01:16:16.920, Speaker B: I kind of view myself as just. I'm just a substitute, I guess. I find whatever's not working and then just go and work on that. Right. Whether engineering or marketing or whatever.
01:16:17.072 - 01:16:37.364, Speaker C: Yeah. I want to end with one question inspired by something I read recently, but before we do that, I'm curious if there's anything that you can offer in terms of what's next on the platform any particular product upgrades or launches that you might be willing to share or just anything in general you want to talk about that we haven't covered during this segment?
01:16:41.264 - 01:17:22.774, Speaker B: I generally don't like to anticipate future releases for whatever reason, mainly because I think it loses the impact. That's a horrible answer to your question, but I would say there's nothing in particular. There will be a big summer for us. We have product that we're rolling out, but, yeah, we'll see when it comes out. But we have a couple of kind of enormous announcements, let's put it that way. Probably one of our announcements, in my view, will be equally as large as the exchange itself.
01:17:23.554 - 01:17:52.570, Speaker C: Oh, well, okay. Lots of. Look forward to. I was reading over the weekend this, the idea of hard work, and there are like five different, they kind of broke it down into five different types of hard work. And I'm curious, as you think about the success that you've had and what is your mind been most like, your style. One of them is out thinking, which is you have a better strategy. There's a shortcut.
01:17:52.570 - 01:18:11.478, Speaker C: The other one is pure effort. You're just working longer. The intensity of it is high. The third one is being opportunistic. You know, you position yourself to take advantage of a change of an opportunity, maybe avoid in the market. The fourth is consistency. You're just doing average things for longer than most.
01:18:11.478 - 01:18:29.634, Speaker C: And the fifth is focus. And a lot of that is just saying no to a lot of distractions. They're all different types of hard work. I am curious, when you think about the success that you've had, which ones do you gravitate to or you think have been most important in your journey?
01:18:29.794 - 01:18:53.454, Speaker B: Yeah, for me, it's very definitively two, four, and five. It's like, no, no questions. I think they're all kind of the same to me, basically. I think just working really hard, undistracted for a long period of time. It's just my formula. It's kind of as simple as that. And if you keep doing that long enough, like, hopefully you get lucky, an opportunity comes along.
01:18:53.454 - 01:18:57.754, Speaker B: So, yeah, that's for listeners.
01:18:57.794 - 01:18:59.738, Speaker C: Pure effort, consistency and focus.
01:18:59.866 - 01:19:10.894, Speaker A: I would argue that most founders are going to tell you, like, to me it's so two, four, and five in a heartbeat. Like, I would argue most founders will say two, four and five, and most investors will say one.
01:19:12.314 - 01:19:19.970, Speaker C: I'd say yes, although investors that end up blowing up would say one because I never want to assume that I'm smarter than the market.
01:19:20.042 - 01:19:21.054, Speaker A: Oh, interesting.
01:19:21.364 - 01:19:49.520, Speaker C: But you hear three arrow guys be like, really smart or, you know, long term capital management blew up spectacularly. These are no laureates. Just felt that they had an algo. And I think you never, I never want to assume. I think one is the most dangerous because you never want to assume you're smarter than anyone else. But I do think a lot in crypto has been opportunistic. And if I hear the conversation we just recorded, I do sense that there's been a lot of insight that you've had because you've been in the industry.
01:19:49.520 - 01:20:21.076, Speaker C: You were at FTX that collapsed, and you saw the opportunity, like, at a moment where everyone prices, this is the last thing you want to be building, like, an exchange again. And I think that's, that's positioning yourself to take advantage of. We know exchanges are highly profitable. We know that value can be, you know, created there. And you went for it. And sure, you've been at it for a while. You were very strategic and going to Japan and all this stuff, but to me, it feels like it was.
01:20:21.076 - 01:20:28.804, Speaker C: It was actually surprising hearing your answer that you didn't mention opportunistic, because I think a lot in crypto. Is that not in the bad sense of the word?
01:20:28.924 - 01:20:53.884, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I totally agree. I mean, I think it's like, what's the saying? It's like you create your own luck or whatever, and I think. I think two, four and five gives you three. It gives you opportunity. So I think that's like, have your cake needed to, I guess. And it also gets you other smart people that want to be around you. And so kind of, like, if you do two, four, five, you kind of get the rest.
01:20:53.884 - 01:21:42.934, Speaker B: But I just want to, like, maybe say one thing on this topic that was just so insightful to me that a friend of mine, he's another, he's a defi founder in this space. It really blew my mind when he said this. I just wanted to share it. It was just so incredibly insightful. So I'm sitting there at a lunch with him here in Tokyo, and Nisakir Mani, who do you think my role model is as a founder? And he tells me, he's like, my role model is a redwood. And I'm like, what do you mean it's a redwood tree? Yeah, it's like a redwood tree. And I'm like, well, what are you talking about? What do you mean it's a redwood tree? Like, that makes no sense.
01:21:42.934 - 01:22:18.734, Speaker B: And he's like, no, no, no, think about a redwood tree. You know, fires come and go people come and destroy kind of everything around the land, but it doesn't matter what happens. The redwoods stay. The redwoods don't go anywhere. They're always there standing. And kind of the history of the region and the Bay area can be kind of encapsulated in these redwood trees. And he looks at me and he says, armani, I'm a redwood.
01:22:18.734 - 01:23:17.564, Speaker B: I'm a redwood tree. And he says, I don't want to win in a cycle. He says, I want to win in three cycles or five cycles. And if you look at all these guys, whether it's terra and Luna or FTX or three arrows capital or whatever, these are all folks that had to win in a single cycle. There was a tipping point where they just lost it, and then they threw it all away because of whatever reason, whether they took two speculative bets or sold customer assets or whatever it was. And he's like, well, if you just change your mindset from winning in one cycle to winning in three cycles or whatever, it changes all your decisions. And that was just such an awesome thing to hear from somebody in the space, that type of long term thinking.
01:23:17.564 - 01:23:21.364, Speaker B: So anyway, it was just shout out to guy, and it was awesome.
01:23:21.404 - 01:24:07.008, Speaker C: Yeah, it's amazing. I've started to use that analogy in the sense that if you invert and you say, how many more years ahead of you do you have in investing? You've discovered crypto today. Do you want to perfectly time the cycle, or do you want to position yourself to invest for the next 40 years and compound? And if you do that, then I think you start making decisions that never compromise your ability to play the game. You never use leverage, so you protect capital, and you want to be in a position where you want to fund projects where no one wants to fund them. We're not in that environment right now, but it's still very exciting. So inverting is sort of what has been helpful for me to just play the long game, I guess, as a redwood. That's awesome.
01:24:07.008 - 01:24:24.564, Speaker C: Armani, I it's been a fascinating discussion. Really loved having you on. I know we've been trying to make this happen for a while, but you're a busy man, so really appreciate you coming on the pod, and perhaps we'd love to have you on again when you do this major announcement, and maybe we can do a recap of what you're doing then and there.
01:24:25.264 - 01:24:27.448, Speaker B: Sounds great. Thanks so much for having me on, guys.
01:24:27.576 - 01:24:28.888, Speaker A: Armani, appreciate it, man.
01:24:29.016 - 01:24:30.256, Speaker C: Really appreciate it.
01:24:30.440 - 01:24:45.346, Speaker A: All right. You heard about, say a couple times, just want to give them one last shout out. Big thanks to say for sponsoring this episode of Empire. There are a ton of reasons to build on say. If you want to get in touch with them, you can reach out to me. I'll put you in touch directly with the team. You can also get in touch with them on Twitter, a network.
01:24:45.346 - 01:24:57.194, Speaker A: You can follow the journey at say network. They are currently live. They've got save you two on public Devnet today. Mainnet goes live later in Q two. Really excited to have say, sponsoring and partnering with us on this episode of Empire.
