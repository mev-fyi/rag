00:00:01.600 - 00:00:41.740, Speaker A: Hey, everyone, welcome to Arbitrum part two. If you missed the episode earlier today that dropped all about Arbitrum's airdrop and orbit, go listen to that episode first. It's with Harry. It's with Stephen, who you're going to hear from in this episode that you're listening to now. They did an episode earlier this morning that we recorded last night on March 16, like eleven at night. And then the episode that you're listening to right now, episode two is all about their thoughts on ZK, competitive space Mev on Arbitrum, their thoughts on arbitrum versus optimism, arbitrum versus coinbases l two. But I think it's really good context to actually set it up with the episode right before this.
00:00:41.740 - 00:00:50.204, Speaker A: So go listen to the episode right before this, then go listen to this episode. I think that's all you need to know. So let's jump into it. Harry and Steven, welcome to Empire.
00:00:50.244 - 00:00:53.020, Speaker B: Guys, thanks. Great to be here.
00:00:53.052 - 00:00:54.144, Speaker C: Thanks for having us.
00:00:55.084 - 00:01:14.024, Speaker D: Theres a lot of really good stuff happening in Arbitrum. Right. I want to highlight a few of those you processed, I think last Tuesday, 1.1 million transactions, about 20,000 more than Ethereum l one. I think it was the first time that layer two blockchain surpassed Ethereum. And daily transaction count on Wednesday. I think you believe you repeated that.
00:01:14.024 - 00:01:39.424, Speaker D: Maybe give us a quick over update on what has happened since weve had you on the podcast. There's been a lot of teams building on arbitrum. There's a lot of excitement. Talk to us a little bit about how that process has gone about over the last couple of months. What are the more exciting things that you've seen in the ecosystem? Would be great to level set everyone.
00:01:39.884 - 00:02:09.206, Speaker B: Yeah. So the arbitrary ecosystem is, I think, a very welcoming place, and that stems from us, that we try to welcome teams and work with them to success. But also the ecosystem as a whole, it's much, much, much larger than our team. It's very welcoming and open. And we're actually seeing an influx of, well, two things. One is very, very strong projects, particularly in Defi, but also treasure and other Gamefi and NFTs as well. But particularly in DeFi is probably our strongest vertical right now.
00:02:09.206 - 00:02:55.126, Speaker B: Very strong projects and particularly innovation. Take GMX innovation in DeFi, it's not just like, oh, we're also going to launch this here. You're seeing very innovative projects and frankly, projects that people want to use. People are excited to use them and to use these products and they actually have real product market fit. We're also seeing an influx of protocols come from other chains to arbitram. Trader Joe, since we last spoke, they did an expansion from avalanche to arbitrum, gains protocol from Polygon, did an expansion to arbitrum, and now arbitrum, by the way, is their dominant network in terms of their volume. Lyra, which is an options protocol from optimism, did an expansion to arbitrum.
00:02:55.126 - 00:03:28.740, Speaker B: So we're seeing this convergence around the DeFi ecosystem and defi community and arbitrum, which is very strong. And it's not just transaction counts, because people ask, you think this is real? Are there other reasons why people are doing transaction counts? Obviously, I don't have. I'm not inside everyone's head that's using arbitrage. So I don't know the exact answer and can't tell you what everyone's motives are, their transactions. But what I can tell you, that it's not just one metric going off. It's a series of metrics that have risen together. And I'll walk you through those briefly.
00:03:28.740 - 00:03:53.392, Speaker B: Number one is, of course, the transaction gap. Number two is the TVL. So arbitrum, if you look at Defi llama, defi TVL, we've surpassed just about all other layer twos that were even sidechain. So we're about $800 million past polygon at this point. Past avalanche, past Solana, well, past optimism. Right now, it's in terms of defi chains. Arbitrum, bsc.
00:03:53.392 - 00:04:04.970, Speaker B: Sorry, ethereum, BSc. Arbitrum. And when it comes to Dex, volume, actually. So that's TVL. When it comes to actually, volume being transacted. Indexes. We're right now number two to Ethereum.
00:04:04.970 - 00:04:32.572, Speaker B: It's just ethereum. And if you scroll over to the right, you'll see the Dex volume. Haven't looked at it today, but this is how it's been for the past few weeks. It's been ethereum and then arbitrary, although it looks like BSC is slightly edged out today. But over the past week or so, arbitrary has been consistently in the number two spot, but right up there with. With ESC as well. And the other metric, which is a fascinating one, is the number of ETH being bridged to arbitrum.
00:04:32.572 - 00:05:05.488, Speaker B: This is one where l, two b tracks this very well. An interesting fact is arbitrum has more ETH on it than pretty much all of our competitors combined, so we have more ETH in our protocol than the polygon bridge. Optimism, starkware, Zksync, immutable x, and more. All of these combined and we have actually. So we're almost at 1 million east in arbitrum. We're about like, you know, we're about to get to that point. And, you know, what that means is there's real value here.
00:05:05.488 - 00:05:35.594, Speaker B: There's real users transacting. And so I can't tell you the motives, but it's encouraging to see the true usage metrics go up as well. And when I checked last week, and I haven't looked at it today, the average trade in Arbitram was about $1,000. So real users, and not even only whales, but users with $1,000 is a moderate sum. But it's not the millions you see some that transact on Ethereum. So it's real usage for real people.
00:05:36.854 - 00:06:24.898, Speaker D: What's behind the scenes here? We've, in this pod, talk about historically, it's pretty impressive. Polygon, from a business development standpoint, managed to convince a lot of, you know, high profile companies, build, at least announce that they're going to deploy on Polygon. But we see like, these massive reorgs that can, like, continue to happen. And to your point earlier, like we criticize, like, there's a lot of people in the Ethereum community that criticize, like, Solana outages, but like, these reorgs are, you know, not, they're pretty concerning. So I want to get your opinion on, unlike that Process of BD, how active are you on business development? And you talk about Reddit. I'm really curious to get your perspective.
00:06:24.946 - 00:06:47.504, Speaker B: Yeah, so a few things. First of all, I'm very close to the Polyvad team. And yeah, their business development team is fantastic. Really, really good. And one thing here is to notice it's actually good for all of us. The fact that you have these consumer brands that are embracing crypto is not only helpful for Polygon, so it's helpful for all of us. So I'm actually thankful for them, for a lot of the work that they're doing in bringing these brands to crypto.
00:06:47.504 - 00:07:20.876, Speaker B: And yeah, definitely they have a fantastic business development team. In terms of the reorgs, it definitely is a problem. And I know it's a problem that, I know there was a large reorg last week and it's a problem that becomes difficult for apps to use. But I think the team is keenly aware of this problem. I think that's one of the reasons why the Polygon team is really embracing the roll up vision. And they're going to be launching their own roll up and maybe one day even converting the matic chain. I don't know their plan exactly to a roll up.
00:07:20.876 - 00:08:01.286, Speaker B: So I think it's a validation, basically, on the vision that there is something very, very special and strong about roll up architecture. And I don't think that's controversial. I think the Polygon team will be the first ones to tell you, yes, there are serious problems with their current technology, which is why they're investing heavily in building roll up technology as well. But, yeah, definitely. In terms of us, yes, we have a comparatively small but very mighty business development team. And the one thing to notice, we don't have all the same resources. We don't have a native token, and sometimes we don't really have a grants program.
00:08:01.286 - 00:08:24.232, Speaker B: All these protocols you see in arbitrary, I can confirm. I've never paid GMX anything. I've never paid any defi project anything to launch an arbitrum. And that's not to say it's bad, too. It's just those aren't resources that we have today. So we are competing in the realms that we can. And I think the things that people like about us is we have best in class resources and support.
00:08:24.232 - 00:08:39.454, Speaker B: We really try to work at the project to make them successful. Something that differentiates us from some other teams. Not to name anyone in particular. There are some teams out there that optimize for the announcement. Like, we got an announcement. This. This project is moving to us, or this company is launching on us.
00:08:39.454 - 00:09:03.274, Speaker B: We don't optimize for the announcement. We optimize for the success. The announcement is day one, and then we day two, once that media cycle has died down, we say, all right, let's roll up our sleeves and make sure that this is an absolutely successful launch for you. And I think the thing you'll see is all those projects that I mentioned before, they've come to Arbitrum. They've been very, very successful in Arbitrum, and I'm not going to take credit for it myself. I think that's as an ecosystem we embraced, but our team also does as much as we can as well.
00:09:05.794 - 00:09:26.134, Speaker D: How much of you think of, there's been speculation about a token launch, some airdrop happening. I feel like people are acutely aware of there may be a possibility to get an airdrop. So that is an incentive to come over to arbitrum. And you've seen an uptick in activity, I think, recently, maybe.
00:09:26.474 - 00:09:27.346, Speaker A: What do you.
00:09:27.490 - 00:09:35.054, Speaker D: I mean, I'm not asking you the output here, but what is the token strategy for arbitrum?
00:09:35.134 - 00:10:05.972, Speaker B: Yeah. So first I'll say is that's sort of what I was mentioning before around. There's definitely a lot of people that are, that might be coming for different reasons, but typically in what I see from those type of users, they're doing very small transactions. They're not touching dexs. So the fact that we have all the key metrics of actual usage metrics up as well, is indicative of the fact that there's something really up there. This is real usage. But again, I'm not in the heads of all these users, but it's nice to see the correlated metrics.
00:10:05.972 - 00:11:53.200, Speaker B: If transaction count was way up or bridging was up, or the number of people bridging was up, but the value being bridge wasn't up, then that probably be concerned what's going on here. Why are people bridging to the shame and actually doing anything? The fact that people are bridging significant value and transacting with that value is indicative to us that there is something wrong, something really right, I should say, going on here in terms of we obviously don't have a native token and don't really have too much to share, unfortunately, about our plans there. But what I will say is our goal as technologists, and that's where we come from this, we're first and foremost a technologist, of course, off chain labs, the business, but we're first and foremost about the technology, about the security. That's why we chose to be in this business, and that's what we care about, that's what we're passionate about. And one important question is how do we get to how does a roll up decentralized, and how does that full decentralization happen? And I think that's the context in which a discussion of a token makes sense, in which can this help decentralize the protocol? Can it actually help in building the vision? It shouldn't be a question of like, hey, this will be really good for us for some other reason. For us, it's always about the technology. And the key question we ask is for any feature, will this make the product more decentralized, more secure, and actually help deliver in the mission and the vision that we have for a fully trustless layer? Two, and that's how we consider the question about a token.
00:11:53.200 - 00:12:00.324, Speaker B: And really all their questions in that, and there are obviously some good arguments both ways there, but that's the framework that we use.
00:12:01.784 - 00:12:19.554, Speaker D: Maybe just a finer point here. We talked earlier about decentralizing the sequencer, so in this context, would having a token make that easier? Like is having a token part of the process of decentralizing the sequencer. Or can you decentralize a sequencer without having a token?
00:12:22.014 - 00:12:23.074, Speaker B: Yeah, so.
00:12:23.454 - 00:12:24.446, Speaker D: And maybe it's a stupid.
00:12:24.510 - 00:12:39.542, Speaker B: No, it's not a stupid question. And actually, it's such a good question that I'll tell you the truth. People ask me all the time, when are you guys going to decentralize a sequencer? And I'm like, 99% sure that, like, almost everyone asking that question is really asking me when there's a token.
00:12:39.558 - 00:12:41.342, Speaker D: Because they've conflated this one token.
00:12:41.398 - 00:12:41.974, Speaker B: Right.
00:12:42.134 - 00:12:42.942, Speaker A: That's exactly right.
00:12:42.958 - 00:12:43.270, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:12:43.342 - 00:12:44.246, Speaker A: When token, right.
00:12:44.270 - 00:12:45.446, Speaker B: Because these people, like, don't.
00:12:45.470 - 00:12:47.142, Speaker D: Like, I didn't, I didn't want to.
00:12:47.158 - 00:13:01.902, Speaker B: Ask it, like, no, no. I guess on Twitter, like, half a psychos, a one token half time, they'll say, when are you going to feed us? And half the time, well, third of the time, whatever, you know, sometimes they'll say, that was not yoga's next question.
00:13:01.958 - 00:13:02.870, Speaker A: It's like, when are you going to.
00:13:02.902 - 00:13:05.790, Speaker B: Right, right. Actually, I'll take this an opportunity.
00:13:05.822 - 00:13:11.070, Speaker D: Full disclosure, guys. There is some bias. I'm an investor in Norway from a really close to team. I'm trying to be real objective here, guys. I'm trying.
00:13:11.102 - 00:13:37.728, Speaker B: So I'll say, actually, when you feed you, this is a fun one. We're in Denver now, and on Saturday we've taken over a shake shack for the day. So we will be literally feeding our community for the day. But I don't think that's what people are getting at. Decentralized the sequencer. There are definitely, there's two parts of this technology. Decentralized in the sequencer means you have more people running the sequencer.
00:13:37.728 - 00:13:57.600, Speaker B: So it's not just one party, it's many parties running the sequencer. First of all, I want to mention that also, there's a difference in validators and sequencers. Validators are the ones that provide security for the chain. We already have a dozen plus validators. And removing the whitelist will mean validation is completely decentralized. And that will happen, like I said, in the coming months. That is the core security property.
00:13:57.600 - 00:14:20.740, Speaker B: Decentralized. And the sequencer is a bit different. The sequencer in that world doesn't have power to push bad transactions or do anything like that. What the sequencer has power to do is to reorder transactions, like extract MeV. And so decentralized today, we don't extract Mev. We tell you we don't, and we really don't decentralize the sequencer is a guarantee that we don't, that you can verify. So people often don't realize, I think people conflate the open validation with sequencer.
00:14:20.740 - 00:14:55.524, Speaker B: We're going to get to the full security point very, very soon. We already have a dozen plus validators, so the validation is already largely decentralized, but it'll be fully decentralized soon. In terms of the sequencer, though, we still want to get to a point where the sequencer is decentralized, so we have these proofs that you can reorder transactions. So we have a protocol to decentralize the sequencer. So how does he have a bunch of people basically becoming one sequencer? And then the question is, how do you choose who's participating in that protocol? So the sequencer, maybe now is that of one node, just choose a number. That's nice and fun. Ten nodes, whatever.
00:14:55.524 - 00:15:48.570, Speaker B: That's just, you know, for argument's sake. And the question is, how do you choose those ten nodes? And that's where, you know, I think in our case, we probably really want reputable companies to take part in this. And there will be that, you know, we really want. You don't just want your sequencer decentralized to ten people, ten to ten anons, that like that you don't actually know, you know, who they are. You want there to be, okay, it's decentralized among reputable, maybe the Ethereum foundation, I'm not saying they would do that, but reputable parties that you can trust. But there could be a role, and I think this is what people speculate, there could be a role in which a token decides who takes place and who joins the decentralized sequencer, but it's definitely not necessarily a decentralized sequencer. You can largely decentralize a sequencer by having many nodes, many parties take place in the sequencing, even without a token mechanism to choose who those people are.
00:15:48.570 - 00:15:53.090, Speaker B: You could use that, but it's not necessary just to kind of quickly highlight.
00:15:53.122 - 00:16:42.414, Speaker C: And double down on that point. It's interesting in that sort of like, it seems like the general perception publicly, is that like, oh, what does decentralizing the sequencer mean? Like, oh, it's just like people, like people being able to pick who the sequencer is, but that's fundamentally not that interesting, because you get to vote on who you're trusting, but you still are just kind of trusting a single entity, as opposed to the kind of much deeper technical point that Steven was mentioning, which is basically actually distributing it so that there's not one elected party everybody trusts. There's actually a group of people with a threshold of trust where you could totally have some number of them being fully, actively malicious, and the system is still strong and hold its properties.
00:16:42.794 - 00:17:05.334, Speaker A: Hmm. Can I, can we get into Mev, actually, because you guys had a little stuff going down in the, in the flashbots discord last week that I just wanted to get your take on. Um, I don't know if this is a question for Harry or Steven, but would love to just get your take. I mean, I can explain the situation from, from my view of how I saw it, but would love to get maybe one of your takes on MeV, the situation last week in the flashbacks. Discord. Would love to get your thoughts on this.
00:17:05.974 - 00:17:09.654, Speaker C: Yeah, happy to. It was an interesting one.
00:17:09.734 - 00:17:14.870, Speaker A: Yeah, looked enjoyable from your, I think one.
00:17:14.942 - 00:18:01.434, Speaker C: Very interesting. There's a lot of interesting lessons here. One is, even in a centralized sequence or model with fair ordering, there are still ways to get advantages with Mev, which is something I think we already knew, but is relatively subtle. The actual situation that arose was that this gets a little technical. There are different components of arbitrum, and you have the sequencer. It posts transactions and batches to Ethereum, but before it actually posts the batches, it sends out the transactions that it's sequencing on a feed that anybody can subscribe to. And that's how you get to the, the kind of fast confirmations.
00:18:01.434 - 00:19:14.324, Speaker C: But it turned out that they were being sent out in a random order to all of the people who were subscribing. And so we figured out that basically there was a huge incentive for backrunners to subscribe tens of thousands of times to the feed, in the hopes that they would hear about the already confirmed transactions milliseconds sooner than their competitors and gain an advantage. So it really kind of highlights that sort of, there are always these opportunities for MeV, and kind of back running is one that is kind of generally a good. It's the reason why kind of the Dex actually shows the right price, because there's an arbitrage opportunity, and somebody will come in and sort it out so that users can actually sort of pay what, whatever the kind of correct price is. But it also is relatively antisocial in that everybody is relatively mercenary and out for themselves and trying to do whatever they can to make as much money as possible. There are a lot of interesting lessons that we're taking in terms of.
00:19:16.784 - 00:19:17.072, Speaker B: How.
00:19:17.088 - 00:19:33.796, Speaker C: To let these negative externalities of MHD extraction, um, where people try to find corner cases and ways to sort of abuse the system. In order to make money, how to sort of design a system where the negative consequences of that don't really like, affect sort of a regular person who.
00:19:33.820 - 00:19:35.092, Speaker A: Wants to run a node and subscribe.
00:19:35.108 - 00:19:40.024, Speaker C: To the feed, but they can't because it's being overloaded by searchers.
00:19:40.924 - 00:19:58.070, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I feel like one of the pushbacks here was that off chain labs would be from this pr, was that off chain labs would be taking any potential mev revenue for arbitrum and giving it to like AWS or something farms or something like that, and keeping it for themselves or instead of the ecosystem. Like, that was the narrative I'd say, that was getting.
00:19:58.102 - 00:19:59.910, Speaker B: I think. It wasn't us, I think.
00:19:59.982 - 00:20:22.144, Speaker A: Yeah, no, I know. I think that was an overblown thing. It's what I dug. I think that was an overblown thing. But it does beg the question of, like, what is the solution? Like, do you embed a searcher into the sequencer and return value that the searcher captures, and return that value to, like eventual token holders or something? So im just curious how you think about Mev not right now, but longer term.
00:20:22.604 - 00:21:21.364, Speaker C: Absolutely. And its definitely something that were very interested in. I think the thing people reacted to was essentially what we viewed as a short term vix, in order to make sure that the actual quality of service of the system to real users was effective. Definitely not an ideal solution. I think that fundamentally, the idea of capturing a significant portion of, or as much value as possible from MeV, that's being extracted on a chain, that's the way flashbots has been building and doing a lot of interesting work. This particular issue of latency to get transactions doesn't really have a direct parallel in most other systems, because when you have. Well, it sort of does, but it comes in having a distribution of nodes throughout the network, so that you hear about transactions sooner, as opposed to all transactions coming from a single place.
00:21:21.364 - 00:21:37.584, Speaker C: So it's a relatively different problem. But in general, both for this and for just reducing the degree to which the other place we have this in our system right now is basically latency races for submitting transactions, which is another area we're working on.
00:21:38.514 - 00:21:38.914, Speaker B: Steven.
00:21:38.954 - 00:21:49.374, Speaker C: I think actually later this week, we're planning on publishing a research post which discusses the vaccine plan. Perfect timing.
00:21:50.314 - 00:21:51.170, Speaker A: Really cool work.
00:21:51.202 - 00:22:13.984, Speaker C: Trying to basically balance the idea of still protecting our users. And our number one focus will always be on minimizing MeV and protecting our users from MEV. Because broadly speaking, many types of MEV are bad for users. But there is good Mev and kind of seeing how we can design a system to capture that value is something very much on our mind.
00:22:14.024 - 00:22:56.662, Speaker B: One other thing I want to mention here is I think the process actually worked as it should have. And I think that the narrative was a little bit unfair in some ways. We had this problem, and we brainstorm solutions, and one of our engineers actually created a pr. But prs that, even though they get pushed master for us, often don't always get merged. He literally went to the flashbots discord and said, hey, what do you think? And asking for feedback on that. And we got feedback both on the flashbots and Twitter, actually, we decided not to do that and to abandon that, but we explicitly didn't go ahead and push something without community feedback. We very much went and solicited feedback, and the process worked as I knew.
00:22:56.662 - 00:23:06.264, Speaker B: We got. We heard it community loud and clear, and we took that feedback very seriously. Yeah, I don't think people. I don't know. Obviously, I don't think people saw it from that viewpoint.
00:23:07.404 - 00:23:08.772, Speaker A: Totally, totally.
00:23:08.908 - 00:23:32.964, Speaker C: And the solution from that was basically just to say that we're not actually deploying that change now because of the. We are holding it out as a. If we need to, we will. But for now, we have kind of other workarounds and need to. Will basically be sort of. Can sort of the non mev ecosystem continue to have a good experience? Using the chain is sort of the most important principle.
00:23:34.584 - 00:24:23.594, Speaker A: Um, I want to tee you up, Stephen or Harry, to talk about stylists and what you guys are building with, like, stylus or EVM, but I've won maybe, like, a related question before, which is, um, Steven, when you were talking about optimism, it kind of, in the beginning of this episode, it made me think about, like, kind of the two different strategies you guys are taking on the developer side of things. And it seems like you guys are looking to support more web, two developer languages, to onboard more devs, and instead of going modular, you guys have spun out arbitrum Nova as this completely separate. This is my understanding. I might be wrong here, but as this completely separate chain for social apps and gaming apps, whereas optimism is going for this more modular narrative with bedrock. I'd be curious to hear, a, am I even right there? But B, is that, like, what's the rationale behind that strategy?
00:24:23.634 - 00:24:58.620, Speaker B: Yeah, I think there are two pieces. So, yes, we do have, like you said, two layer, two chains that are on Ethereum today, but we will and have. And actually, we'll announce our first partnership here, probably in the next week or two, but there will be a healthy ecosystem of layer three chains, we call them on arbitrum, or these application specific chains built on arbitrum one. So, in terms of that, we'll have. You can call that modular, the same module, modular vision of having many chains anchored onto the arbitrum one chain. So I don't think there's actually a difference there. Arbitrum, Nova.
00:24:58.620 - 00:25:44.624, Speaker B: We decided, for specific reasons, specifically for partners that wanted to bridge very fast directly to Ethereum. We decided to launch on top of Ethereum, but we will have a blossoming ecosystem of layer three chains, and we'll be in a position to announce the first of these quite soon. Yeah, so that's. I don't think that there's a big difference there. And in terms of expanding our technology to developers, that's additive to all this. So both on the arbitram one chain and on every other of these chains that are launched on top of us or arbitranova, they'll all get, if they use the arbitrage technology, they'll all get the ability to, if they just choose to include it, to have this diversified developer support.
00:25:45.844 - 00:26:19.054, Speaker A: Yeah. Stylus is one of the coolest things I think I've seen in terms of onboarding more developers. My understanding is that through these web assembly smart contracts, users are going to be able to deploy programs on arbitrum written in their favorite programming languages, like Rust or C or C, to run those alongside EVM. EVM programs on Arbitrum. So, I'd love to just hear. That's my very basic understanding of it, but would love to hear what you guys are building with EVM and Stylus.
00:26:20.834 - 00:26:25.254, Speaker C: Yeah, I know Steven loves talking about stylists. I saw Steven's eyes.
00:26:26.514 - 00:27:13.194, Speaker B: All right, I'll do the overview, and then if you have, once ARi can fill the details, the idea is basically, EVM is great, and we are the most EVM compatible or equivalent or whatever term you want that you can be. So, building an arbitram today is exactly like building on Ethereum, other than it's a lot cheaper in terms of the developer experience, both on the surface and under the hood, exactly the same. And the question that we asked ourselves is, that's great, and we're going to keep that always. But is that our limit? And I believe the answer to that is no. I think EVM compatibility is the floor, not the ceiling. That's the foundation and the base that we need. But there's so much more that we can do, and the principle here is one of inclusivity.
00:27:13.194 - 00:27:34.194, Speaker B: I think people like myself included. It's hard. This week I'm in Denver. There are 25,000 people here. So you got this impression that the entire world knows about crypto, and we have taken over the world, but it's not true. If you zoom out just a little bit, you see that the crypto community is still very, very small, even among the technical community. Crypto is a very small community.
00:27:34.194 - 00:28:13.842, Speaker B: And the question is, can we embrace those people, and particularly, can we do it in a way where we bend to them, but don't ask them to bend to us? That is, we make affordances that say, hey, you're a developer or you're an enterprise with development teams that have support in traditional languages. We're going to make our technology work for you and make it easier for you to build on arbitrary and build on web three, rather than say, hey, retrain your team or hire new developers. It's not only about the talent. It's also about the libraries. You might have some great rust support or libraries that you want to run but rewrite those in. EVM is not something that we want to say. Again, EVM is fantastic, and it will always be our foundation.
00:28:13.842 - 00:29:01.054, Speaker B: But the question is, are there more affordances that we can build? And particularly, can arbitrum layer two generally be a breeding ground for innovation where we don't say, okay, we're the same as Ethereum, and that's where we want to be. We say, we support everything Ethereum does, and now let's see how can we make it even better. Because the vision is, this is a vision that's like, basically a meme at this point. We want to get to the next billion users. But my thesis is to get to the next billion users, we need to get to the next million developers. And to get to the next million developers, we're going to have to build affordances that allows them to use both their knowledge and their tooling that they already have. What we're doing with Stylus is we are going to be adding, initially, C and C and Rust support.
00:29:01.054 - 00:29:28.732, Speaker B: These are three programming languages, three popular programming languages support. So you'll be able to write your smart contracts not only in solidity and EVM languages. That's not going to change if your contracts are written already or you want to continue writing DVM, and I'm sure many people will, and we will support that. Of course, that's not going to change. But if you want to write in Rust or C and C, you'll be able to do that as well. And this is a big change, because today there are chains that support rust, like Solana, for example, supports rust. But it's a binary decision.
00:29:28.732 - 00:30:12.986, Speaker B: You're like, do I want to go on the EVM chains or do I want to go on the rust chains? And this decision that I want people to make is wait. I want to choose the ecosystem I want to be in. I want to be in the arbitrum ecosystem, and I don't want my decision point to be, do I want to build in rust or EVM languages, solidity or move? I want to first choose my ecosystem and then any language I want that I can use. And there's one added benefit here, which is as almost a side effect, but really core to what we're doing using some of these affordances, like building these languages are just much more performant than the EVM. So you'll be able to get a ten x increase in performance by doing that. So what that might mean is you might have an EVM or solidity app in arbitrum today, and you'll say, hey, there's this one piece. Maybe it's like cryptographic code, that's really expensive.
00:30:12.986 - 00:30:49.044, Speaker B: So let me actually just take that piece out, rewrite that in rust, or call out to a rust library. And now my whole contract is more efficient, which means my users pay less, I use less gas, which means the chain has more capacity, because if everyone's using less, we can fit more into the same amount of space. I think that is as we scale. That's basically another factor of ten in our scale. Because if you imagine everyone moves over to using these affordances, now we've ten x the capacity of our chain without actually using any more resources from Ethereum. So a lot of different angles. One the inclusivity angle, one the scaling angle, and one just giving developer better experience.
00:30:49.044 - 00:31:06.818, Speaker B: Yeah, that's basically what's motivating this upgrade. But again, EVM support is not going to change. It's not going anywhere. So if my thesis is wrong and no one wants this, nothing will change, everything will work. Exactly. I think that people will want this. But the point is, I have a.
00:31:06.826 - 00:31:08.594, Speaker A: Feeling this is a good thesis, even.
00:31:08.634 - 00:31:10.374, Speaker B: For what it's worth.
00:31:11.154 - 00:31:46.874, Speaker D: We invest a lot. To be fair, we've had other chains and other networks, and they've admittedly said, look, the tooling is not there, like cosmos, for instance, great tech, but they would tell you we need to go a long way in making it easier for developers to come on board. And there's just a whole segment of developers that understand these other languages that would just expedite the process for them to start getting interested in writing and building stuff. So I agree with Jason here. I think it's fairly positive.
00:31:47.334 - 00:32:02.918, Speaker A: Who do you guys see? Do you see Coinbase's l two and optimism and the other l two s as your main competitors, or do you see Solana and Avalanche and alternative l one s as your main competitor? Who do you think of as when you hit the whiteboard?
00:32:02.966 - 00:32:44.504, Speaker B: Yeah. So Harry and I may have different answers here. I'll answer you from the sort of partnership perspective. What I view the main competitor basically is when I'm talking to a project, who else are they considering building on? That's from a technical perspective might be whose technology is closest to us, but from an ecosystem growth perspective, what choices are you considering? I think probably the ones that we see most are people are either coming to us or polygon. Those are most of the conversations that we see today. So in some sense, we're competing with team. You're competing for Polygon.
00:32:44.504 - 00:32:59.764, Speaker B: With Polygon for teams. But again, you know, it's a very friendly competition and, you know, we have great respect for the Polygon team and really good relationship with them. I have an answer that's not which hit me.
00:33:00.464 - 00:33:02.246, Speaker C: Our greatest competitor is ourself.
00:33:02.360 - 00:33:03.014, Speaker B: So.
00:33:08.154 - 00:33:33.654, Speaker C: I feel like we're constantly kind of like driving ourselves forward, like, you know, being dissatisfied with just like, things we've had to do and areas we can improve. Like, I don't think we want to. Like, I don't think we're, we're opening up, you know, working to open up validation because of competitive pressure. I think we're working to do it because it's the big, the damn thing we've wanted to do for like four years now, and we're excited to do it.
00:33:34.194 - 00:33:43.074, Speaker D: The reality is, I think you said, Stephen, and we heard this from the Coinbase guys, too, is like, to think about competition now, it's kind of really stupid because there's like ten users.
00:33:43.154 - 00:33:43.814, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:33:44.114 - 00:34:19.364, Speaker D: And like, so like, if. If everyone acquires, isn't doing the bd efforts and brings on an incremental user, then it's that positive. Because I guess the question here is multi chain deployment is you need to believe that that's going to be the case. The trader Joe example you mentioned, the liar example. A lot of these teams, as you mentioned earlier, may have deployed in another l two or another l one. And eventually, if the users are there, they're going to want to come to arbitrum, they're going to want to have a footprint there. I think the best.
00:34:19.364 - 00:34:49.133, Speaker D: If you invert and you believe that to be true, then you go out and acquire as many users you don't really kind of focus on. Because that's the thing, I think. I think fundamentally, historically in crypto, we've talked a lot about, like, acquiring this, like, circle of ten rails, whereas game is, how do we get the million, ten, 100 million users? Because then there's a lot to go around. Right. I think everyone wins in that scenario. Unless, of course, to your point, Harry and Stephen, is if your chains not secure, then go home, pack up your shit, and go like.
00:34:49.213 - 00:34:49.925, Speaker B: Yeah, you know what I mean?
00:34:49.949 - 00:34:52.313, Speaker D: Like, I agree.
00:34:53.373 - 00:35:17.585, Speaker B: Yeah, I completely agree. And like I said, you know, I cheer every time I see polygon. Have, like, a big bd win where a consumer brand comes because it just means that there's more knowledge of our industry and whether they're on polygon or an arbitrum or polygon now, but they're, you know, maybe they'll be an arbitrary one day. Like, that, to me, is a win for our industry. And that's what we need. We need that, you know, particularly in the post FTX, there's so much like, people look and just say, like they think they can't differentiate. They just think this is all bad.
00:35:17.585 - 00:35:27.294, Speaker B: Some people, and they're obviously, in my opinion, very incorrect, but the idea that we get more mainstream adoption is a win for our entire industry. And in some sense, we all rise together.
00:35:28.994 - 00:35:49.258, Speaker D: I want to get your thoughts on the zks. Obviously, we look at pictures of Denver. It's all the rage. The room is full. Everyone has a strategy. You guys have been relatively quiet, although I think we've talked about this in the prior episode. I'm curious to get your thoughts on the evolving landscape of zero knowledge proofs and CK rollups.
00:35:49.258 - 00:36:05.282, Speaker D: And there's a bunch of teams. It's a term that gets thrown around very loosely, but I think there are many distinctions. So maybe just spend the last ten minutes talking about zks. What's all the rage? What's your strategy? If there is one? And then we can go from there.
00:36:05.338 - 00:36:51.664, Speaker B: Yeah, so a few things. One, we have nothing against ZK or ZK proofs. You know, if you look at my research history, I've been researching and doing work in ZK and cryptography generally for, you know, goes back to probably 2013 or so, that being said, so. And, you know, one other thing is, I think that differentiates us from some of our competitors. If you look at the name of our company, we're off chain labs, right? I think just about every other one of our competitors has their particular technology built into their name. That could be like optimism, or it could be Zksync or Starkware. And again, a lot of these are fantastic teams, but the idea is that we come to this problem and say we want to solve the problem with the best tools available today.
00:36:51.664 - 00:37:32.992, Speaker B: We're going to not come here and say, hey, if you have a plumber come to your house, you wouldn't want someone showing up to your door and saying, here's a wrench. This is what I'm using to fix. You say, don't you want to take a look at the problem first? Maybe the wrench isn't the right tool. It's like, no, whatever your problem is, I'm going to fix it with this wrench. I think that's the wrong approach here. I think our goal is to say we need to bring scale to users, and by the way, we need to bring scale to users today, and we're bringing scale to users today, and we need to do that using the best and most secure tech possible today. And that is indisputably today, arbitrum and Arbitram's particular flavor of optimistic role, and we're happy to innovate.
00:37:32.992 - 00:38:40.020, Speaker B: And if ZK proofs come to a time where I think that they are cost competitive, which I don't believe they are today, because the proving costs are going to be much larger than our costs when they're compatible, which they're not today, because EVM is not built to be in a circuit. And you have all sorts of incompatibilities, both in terms of gas accounting. Things that are expensive in circuits are cheap in the EVM, like hashing, and vice versa. And you just have a developer experience that's different, and often these protocols will have a small laundry list of incompatibilities or things that differ between EVM and the compatibility is not there. And even to the extent that they are there, by the way, there's, in my opinion, no path that these projects can realistically get to anything like stylus, where they, you know, the extent that they're getting EVM support is because they're very hard, much hard coding decisions now in their circuitry to get them to tailor to the EVM, to get something general like stylus, that allows us to add more programming languages, I don't think is there today. So there's cost and there's compatibility and then there's just our future vision, which are currently not compatible with the ZK technology as we know it, as we see it. And I think we're significantly far away from that.
00:38:40.020 - 00:39:24.652, Speaker B: But if that changes, I'm not going to eat my words. I'll be happy, and we will happily embrace that technology. Anecdotally, one of the key innovations in the Arbitrum research paper, which was Princeton, we published at Princeton in 2018 at the Unix security conference, was what we call the Arbitrum virtual machine, or the AVM. And when we launched in August of 2021, that was powering our fraud proofs, the arbitrum virtual machine. When we launched nitro a year later, we retired the AVM completely. So this thing, which was like the crown jewel of our research, we said it served its purpose, but we've built something better now. So that thing, which I can confirm, Harry, myself, literally spent years working on, it was a.
00:39:24.652 - 00:39:55.442, Speaker B: It's a work of art, and from an academic perspective, it's extraordinarily elegant. But we have the realization and said that's, you know, we have something that's actually simpler and actually works better, and we can build our fraud proofs in a way that also allows us to extend them in more ways and be more performant and use, uh, uh, um, you know, uh, more standard tooling. And so we're going to retire that. And there was no one happier to retire that than me, and probably Harry was also. It was great. And the point is, we're happy to continue to innovate and build our technology. We're scaling up.
00:39:55.442 - 00:40:27.262, Speaker B: We have a team of a large research team, large engineering team, is only getting larger because we're not saying, all right, let's pat ourselves in the back. We built this. We're done. We're saying, how do we get even better? One of the fallacies I think people make with ZK, they like to compare the state of arbitrum today with some futuristic state of ZK, as we evidenced in arbitrum nitro, that big upgrade we made, arbitrum is not staying still. We're not stagnant. You either have to compare ZK today to Arbitrum today, and it's clear that Arbitrum is the winner there. It exists, it's secure, it's providing real value to users today.
00:40:27.262 - 00:41:15.244, Speaker B: Or you compare arbitrum in the future, a year or two or three or four or five from now with ZK at the same time, and Arbitrum won't look like it does today at that time, frankly, I'm actually looking forward to the launch of ZKe EVM chains. Like I said, I have nothing against their technology. I'd like to see how they perform. It'll be the first time where users can actually do a direct comparison, because right now, it's a comparison between a live system. With all the baggage that comes having a live system, you actually can pin yourself to a metric and a quarter to a PowerPoint tweet presentation that just speaks about what will come in the future. But now we'll have an Apple to apple comparison. And my expectation is that we'll fear quite well and again, but there are fantastic teams that are building here, and there'll no question make innovation over time.
00:41:15.244 - 00:41:56.058, Speaker B: I don't personally think we're there yet, but if it comes the point where we are, we will just, like, we abandon the AVM and just like, we will absolutely say, all right, there's something better here. We don't have ego about that, and we'll contribute to that future. And we are contributing to that future. We have a research team that's looking very closely at ZK and other technologies. And just to close out, what I can guarantee you is in five years from now, Arbitrum will look nothing like it does today. From a technology perspective, I don't know what it will look like, but we'll have five years of research and innovation and hopefully community participation of making arbitrum a much stronger and better and decentralized product. And there's no question.
00:41:56.058 - 00:42:16.880, Speaker B: Just look at what we accomplished in the last year and a half. There's no question. In a five year horizon, we're going to reinvent ourselves and be so, so, so much better from a security perspective, from a usability perspective, you know, we're going to have everything that's just far improved. And will that include ZK? Maybe. I don't know. We'll include whatever we believe to be the best technology to bring that vision. I don't have a.
00:42:16.880 - 00:42:24.512, Speaker B: I'm not. I'm not coming here and saying, I need to use this wrench. I'm saying, I need to solve this problem. I know the solution today, and I'm working on saying, how do we make that solution even better?
00:42:24.688 - 00:42:25.000, Speaker D: Guys.
00:42:25.032 - 00:42:46.380, Speaker A: You guys are. It's been amazing to see everything that you've built. Appreciate you coming on arbitrum sitting at fourth for TVL right now, across all chains, third for volume. It's been super cool to see just how quickly you've grown and, uh, how you guys have not just helped build arbitrum, but I think built the entire on chain ecosystem, so keep it up. I, uh. I will definitely miss my flight right now, so I need to jump, and, uh, I'll see you guys.
00:42:46.412 - 00:42:47.064, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:42:48.004 - 00:42:48.684, Speaker D: Thanks much, guys.
