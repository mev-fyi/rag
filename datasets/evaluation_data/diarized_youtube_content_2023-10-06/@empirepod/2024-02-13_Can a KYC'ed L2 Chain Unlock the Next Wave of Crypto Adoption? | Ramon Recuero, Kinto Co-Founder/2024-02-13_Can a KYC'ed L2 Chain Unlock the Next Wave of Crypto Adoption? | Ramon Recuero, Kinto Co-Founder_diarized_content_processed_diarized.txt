00:00:00.360 - 00:00:33.724, Speaker A: Your digital footprint becomes a better mechanism, a better inference to provide, like proof of humanity. Provide like a track record of a credit history report. Like, if you have thousands of interactions on Aviv, you always pay down the interest. If you've never been liquidated. That, I think, becomes a more complements the current KYC framework in a very nice way, because blockchains are data rich. So ultimately, if you become that beachhead to get most users to agree and sign up for Kinto, have this kinto NFT, you almost become an essential middleware for everything else in crypto.
00:00:34.664 - 00:01:11.176, Speaker B: Hey, everyone, if you have been listening to empire, you know that Santi and I are fed up with unaffordable fees and frustrating transaction speeds that make the on chain experience basically unusable. So the arbitrum team reached out, and they showed us the platform. They showed us what you can do on arbitrum. Whatever you're doing, you can experience frictionless transactions at lightning speed on arbitrum. So head over to port arbitrum IO and check it out. What's up, everyone? Before we jump into today's episode, I'm excited to share Empire's first ever security partner. Harpy is the best tool to prevent your wallet from theft in real time.
00:01:11.176 - 00:01:45.976, Speaker B: Harpy is not just a security solution, they are a peace of mind solution. But don't just take our word for it. Harpy is the only wallet security solution that protected 100% of its users from attacks like the ledger one in Q four, which was an off chain signature attack. To learn more about Harpy, click the link in the show notes or visit Harpy IO Empire. What's up, everyone? Before we jump into the episode, little plug for digital asset summit coming up in London, March 18 to 20th. Tickets are pacing so far ahead of schedule that we had to decrease the discount code. So instead of Empire 20, it is now Empire ten.
00:01:45.976 - 00:02:08.884, Speaker B: Head over to the website digital asset summit Das London, March 18 to 20th. Use code Empire ten and get 10% off your ticket. See you in London. All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Empire. Really lucky to be joined by Ramon, co founder and CEO of Memory Labs. Memory is building. Kinto, full disclosure, Santi and I are both investors.
00:02:08.884 - 00:02:22.336, Speaker B: And Ramon, before that, head of product at Open Zeppelin, I think he spent some time at y Combinator on the technical lead side at Google, and also had founded a crypto company before this. So, Ramon, welcome to Empire, my friend.
00:02:22.480 - 00:02:24.432, Speaker C: Really happy to be here. Thank you for having me.
00:02:24.528 - 00:02:55.084, Speaker B: Yeah. Ramon Kinto is building this safe and secure l two that institutions can use. And obviously, Santi and I are both investors, so we believe in the vision, have a bunch of questions. But I think the lead into this conversation actually starts with not Kento, but Babylon finance. So what happened at Babylon finance that led to this decision to go build this kind of like KYC to l two?
00:02:56.024 - 00:03:25.042, Speaker C: Yep. Thank you. It's basically a lot of pain is behind a lot of learnings, behind this experience. Babylon, for a bit of background, was a defi protocol on Ethereum mainnet that allowed people to create investment clubs together with your friends and invest in different investment opportunities in crypto. Like, for example, okay, let's lend money on Abe, borrow from it, and let's buy Steve or less deposit in convex and curve and stake the tokens there, those kind of things. Babylon was going well. We released the community, we released governance, the token.
00:03:25.042 - 00:04:02.564, Speaker C: Then we got to 30, 40 million in deposits. And this is in a space where asset management has traditionally not been really in favor because most people in crypto prefer to manage the money themselves. And they are really far in the risk curve. But anyway, we have like 30, 40 million in deposits. And then the famous rarife incident happened, where they suffered a reentrancy hack. And Babylon was one of the six or seven pools affected with fracs and a few others. And because of that, we went in a week from 40 million in deposits to 3 million in deposits.
00:04:02.564 - 00:04:30.010, Speaker C: It was really painful, because even if it wasn't directly our fault, and it was also compounded by the decision of rarife to say that they were gonna refund. So we told our users, oh, no worries, all the money is there, they're going to refund. It's just a matter of time. And then they changed their mind through a governance proposal two weeks later. And then when we told our users everything was going to be fine, and then they told us, no, it's not fine. So the users where they had $1, now they saw $0.80. So you can imagine.
00:04:30.010 - 00:05:12.040, Speaker C: And this is when the crypto market was imploding, all that stuff. So everything was going down. So the users were understandably really angry and, yeah, and basically, it's like in a bank, or like in the JP Morgan days, when spreading false rumors about this bank being. This bank being insolvent eventually led to the bank being insolvent the next day. And in this case, the moment you lose trust of your users, even if you need to close your protocol or for a few hours, then you're done. So then after this, eventually react, Rari and Faye decided to refund users. So we also did all the work to refund all the users.
00:05:12.040 - 00:05:36.494, Speaker C: So nobody lost money through that hack. But it was really difficult to recover deposits because of the bear market and the Steve deep, everything that was going on. So we decided to close it. But from all that pain is when I came to the realization it doesn't matter. All the benefits of decentralization 24/7 everything that you can offer with crypto, that we all believe in, if users are losing money left and right due to hacks, scams, or rubles.
00:05:38.194 - 00:05:39.374, Speaker B: What is Kinto?
00:05:39.794 - 00:05:50.054, Speaker C: Yeah, Kinto is a secure layer, too, that helps focus exclusively on finance, that helps people and institutions bridge the wall of traffic and Defi.
00:05:50.954 - 00:05:54.134, Speaker B: What do you mean by it being a secure layer, too?
00:05:55.154 - 00:06:40.422, Speaker C: Yeah, there are a few layers here. One of them is like, we have KYC at the chain level, and there are several reasons for this that we can unpack, but this just out of the gate gives you civil resistance. It probably doesn't give you civil resistance in the most decentralized or crypto bank way possible, but it gives you civil resistance on par with what the airport security systems do right now. It's not perfect, but it works well enough, and governments and financial institutions take it. Then, on the user side, we're forcing every user to have their own smart contract wallet. So this will remove all the hacks that you see, the board, ape holders, and all these kind of people that is like, they get just scammed every day. And this will also enable a much better user experience.
00:06:40.422 - 00:06:59.654, Speaker C: So they get two things for the price of one. So those are two main reasons. And then another one is like, by having a L2, you also have a bit more time to act when something happens before you escape the chain. So that gives you also a bit more time to act in the case of an emergency.
00:07:01.154 - 00:07:28.584, Speaker A: I'm going to jump in as a perhaps someone listening to this would say, I definitely hear you. Look, we've been in this environment where there have been constant hacks pretty much every day, and it makes you really question if this can actually work at scale. What's the point of creating an environment where you have to, when you lose a lot of properties, so to speak, like, why not just go back to web two, you know?
00:07:29.164 - 00:07:50.870, Speaker C: Yep. You know, and I'm being in crypto for ten years, so the moment I hear KyC, it's like an immune reaction, an allergic reaction, my polytunnel shred. But it's not one or the other. It's like everything in life. This. There's like, grace. And in this case, people, when we tell the story of kinto, immediately they think, oh, this is a permission chain.
00:07:50.870 - 00:08:12.770, Speaker C: I need to ask for permission. This institution will give me access. But the way we have created Kinto is that the KYC is still owned by the users governance. Users with KYC providers are allowed. And you as an user, you pick which KYC provider you trust. For example, right now, we offer plaid or synapse. And Plaid is a web tool leading company that banks use.
00:08:12.770 - 00:08:56.153, Speaker C: So they trust, and they are the ones that store data on chain. There is no information ever store, and Kinto doesn't store anything, so you don't lose any privacy. And also, even if plaid gets hacked, they don't have your account information, so you still can preserve your anonymity. And then even in Kinto, by default, we create for you, like, a non custodial wallet in turnkey that is like an embedded wallet that is not tied to anything else. So even in the case that both Kinto gets hacked, then that address doesn't give them anything about all the other addresses. So we have split everything, kind of like the Harry Potter horror crux Voldemort. So it's really hard for someone to steal identity.
00:08:56.153 - 00:08:58.353, Speaker C: That's our top of mind.
00:08:58.813 - 00:09:56.806, Speaker A: Yeah. So I definitely hear you on the KYC. Look, I think it would be probably naive to think that we're going to operate and continue to operate in an environment where you don't like, if you look at regulation everywhere, like, you know, the traveling rule, there's just been steps towards understanding to some degree who's operating on chain. Now, of course, one of the questions that I had when you came to me, and I was an investor in Babylon, and I love backing repeat founders, so you came to me and said, hey, I want to build this. My reaction was, it makes a lot of sense because, you know, in many ways, you already know who's operating on chain. Like, if you think about it, the flow is most people go through an exchange that will require you an enforce at that checkpoint, proper Kyc. So they would be able to trace, you know, whether you want to believe it or not, through chain analysis and other tools.
00:09:56.806 - 00:11:06.024, Speaker A: People, you know, it's kind of really hard to preserve unless you onboard it through some other, like, manner. But I would love to understand some of the other features, like when you talk about a more secure environment, you know, in a place where everyone in the pool or everyone in this l two knows who each other and can interact. Like, what kind of activity do you foresee, do you think, you know, this is a place where banks come and they can trade against each other because they know who they're trading against, they know the counterparty or developers get more excited coming here because this is where most users are going to, are going to ultimately be. I'm curious like how you think about like building this and what kind of features this allows because there are other, I forget the name of this other company that is like providing KYc as a service for any type of l two. So I'm curious how you think about the other benefits beyond being KYC by default.
00:11:06.324 - 00:11:46.848, Speaker C: Yeah, I think the main difference from Kinto is that we are doing it at the chain level. And this must be like, must seem like a minor point, but it's really important, this mental model doing it at the chain level. Because talking about use cases, for example, RWA protocols right now on Mainnet, they suffer from an anti network effect because each one of them needs to do their own KYC. They cannot compose with each other. And the users that would invest in their products, they're usually not on mainnet because they require these compliance checks. So there is a mismatch there. So on Kinto users, they just KYC once and it's like the Apple store, if you already put your credit card, then it's one fingerprint and then you can access everything.
00:11:46.848 - 00:12:30.072, Speaker C: So it's the same in Kinto users only need to KYC once. So it's better for all the protocols, RWA protocols that need this feature. And then if you're, if you are issuing assets that require other checks, like for example, oh, this is, this asset is only available for users in this jurisdiction. You can do that check on chain really easily and then you can compose with other KYC protocols that cater to the same universe of, of assets. And one important distinction here is like, we don't want to kyc everything. And we truly believe, for example, what is happening in ethereum, arbitrum, and we're building on top of arbitrum on Kinto. We don't want to copy all the protocols that are already mainnet and just offer them, we don't want to have Aave compound uniswap replace them on Kinto.
00:12:30.072 - 00:12:50.740, Speaker C: We just want to have the protocols or the assets or the use cases that require this compliance check and then hop multi chain to compose them with the best assets that are already available on Mainnet, arbitrary etcetera, because we don't want to fragment liquidity. If you need one of our, that it makes no sense to have that on Kintone. We just hop on Mainnet and grab it.
00:12:50.932 - 00:13:08.184, Speaker B: Roman, what do you think? Remember you mentioned Aave and compound? Do you remember Aave launched Aave, arc and compound launched, what was it called? Compound treasury? I think it was, yeah. And from my understanding, both of those were not successful. What do, what did they get wrong and how does that impact your strategy at Kinto?
00:13:08.684 - 00:13:42.978, Speaker C: I think the same thing they get wrong is kind of like the IElts use this analogy of the intranets versus the Internet, you know, in the two thousands. Also, a lot of people said, no, Internet is not going to work. It's open, there's a lot of criminals using the Internet. It doesn't meet the needs of all these institutions to come on board, so it's never going to work. And the same has happened on crypto, you know, with a lot of institutions or provenance, it's like they're creating this private chains and then they whitelist the participants. So there is no organic flow, there is no velocity of money. And it's just four or five people changing, changing money between each other.
00:13:42.978 - 00:14:30.064, Speaker C: And as Santi said, it's like, why not create a normal web two application with a database for doing that? It makes no sense. So in the sense things like our arc being whitelist, being whitelisted participants, by default, it breaks the composability. All the cool thing about crypto is the composability. And it's really hard because when you think, okay, why see composability? There's a lot of nuance and that's where the, I think the wisdom is here. But it's like you can have some layer of KYC and Kintok, we can offer that for the assets that need it, and then even we can offer this product, even multi chain right now. And even another use case is for airdrops, for example. A lot of airdrops have given billions of dollars to users and many of that has been lost to civil resistance, to civil bots and stuff.
00:14:30.064 - 00:14:59.280, Speaker C: So even right now, if you're doing an airdrop, another chain, you could check really easily, oh, it is a unique user and you can just check has it verified in Kinto and that's it. You don't need any data, personal information or anything that can be one use case or other one, using uniswap V hooks and hooking kinto, KYC, AML directly there and you don't need to know anything. So there are some things that will be in the middle and it's messy. This messy middle is not clear that it's like, oh, no Kyc at all. Oh, everything Kyc. So it's like. It's the messy middle.
00:14:59.392 - 00:15:00.084, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:01.224 - 00:15:01.744, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:15:01.824 - 00:15:40.760, Speaker A: That's a good observation. Two things come to mind. One, Kyc is extremely expensive, and obviously there's ways around it. I mean, it's cost. I forget the figure, but it's caused the traditional system an enormous amount of time and money and friction, and it's not the most effective thing, but nonetheless, I mean, I don't think that it's going to go away anytime soon. I am curious, when you talked about the two providers, synapse and plaid, I believe that is mostly for us persons, I believe, or maybe Europe. It excludes.
00:15:40.760 - 00:15:59.214, Speaker A: My understanding is it doesn't cover the entire world. And so how do you think about. My understanding is KYC is very not, like, robust in other places. So how do you think about onboarding people in Asia or Africa, Latin America? I mean, is that going to be a challenge or have you thought about that roadmap?
00:15:59.594 - 00:16:27.186, Speaker C: Yeah, great question. Right now, between synapse and plat, both countries, we support. Both places, we support like 85 countries. So around half of the world. And this includes many places in Asia, Africa, Europe, US. But regarding costs, that's one of our value propositions. Also, for all these protocols, availability protocols, etcetera, because we are covering the KYC cost and because of this relationship with partners, we can good unit economics to make this viable.
00:16:27.186 - 00:16:31.654, Speaker C: And then because of our token incentives, can also use them for the KYC.
00:16:33.234 - 00:16:45.858, Speaker B: Ramon, where is the KYC stored? And that might be a really dumb question, but, like, you know, how in tradfi, if you do KYC, it's just stored on, like, the company's database, basically, or with the provider, like plaid or whoever it is. Like, how does that work for you guys?
00:16:45.986 - 00:16:53.328, Speaker C: Exactly. It works. That is only the KYC providers to store the data. Kinto doesn't store any personal data. We don't want it. We don't. We don't want anything.
00:16:53.328 - 00:17:14.336, Speaker C: So if you as a user right now, we have our launch program open. You can start KYC. You select, oh, I want to do a KYC through plaid. You complete the flow. It just takes a few minutes, and then your information is stored there. And then in Kinto, we only store kind of like an encrypted map between your wallet address and your id on plaid. That's it.
00:17:14.336 - 00:17:45.134, Speaker C: And then imagine later, two months later, you want to visit this application on Kinto that offers you access to. To treasuries, to short term treasuries that then you can use as collateral, etcetera. Then when you visit that, maybe that institution, for whatever reason also needs your date of birth. And then they will use RSDK to say, hey, Jason, I need your date of birth and you with a signature can. Yeah, exactly. And they will redirect and then through our backend will check. It's like, yeah, is it, is it.
00:17:45.174 - 00:17:48.824, Speaker B: Read only or can plaid right back to Kinto?
00:17:49.684 - 00:18:21.704, Speaker C: Plaid can write back to Kinto. In cases of AML, for example, if someone gets added to of sanctions and things like that, then automatically we update your NFT on chain. That is what allows you to send transactions on Kinto because that's why also Kinto is safer. Only people that have gone through the KYC can send transactions. But then also if someone gets added to a AML of a sanction, automatically we receive the callback from plaid or synapse and automatically update that information in the NFT. So then in an application wants to blacklist people that have received the sanction, then they are automatically compliant.
00:18:22.084 - 00:18:45.644, Speaker B: So what's the user experience there? Let's say I'm Santi and I'm playing around on Kinto and one day the government realizes that I'm a bank robber. They send that info to plaid, Plaid writes that info back to Kinto and Santi wakes up and just basically can't play on chain. What does that actually mean? He blocked out of his wallet or.
00:18:46.184 - 00:19:13.548, Speaker C: Depending on the application. I mean, if that happens, Santi should still be able to withdraw assets. It depends because, depends on the level of sanctions or if it's of fact, probably there is something really, and they probably require you to fix everything. But if not, if it's just a country level sanction, then you will get that information added to your NFT and then all the protocols that don't allow that to happen, you wouldn't be able to interact with them anymore.
00:19:13.676 - 00:19:29.268, Speaker B: Yeah. Who do you think of as your customer, Ramon? Is it the supply side of this or the demand side? Or maybe otherwise put is it the user who wants to do things on chain? Or is it the Blackrock who's like, look, I want to access things on chain, but haven't been able to yet because there's no KYc.
00:19:29.396 - 00:20:05.132, Speaker C: Yeah, like all this is both and it's kind of taken on a problem. The way we see it right now is that these institutions are going to take a bit of time and you need tbL, you need users to be able to convince them to create this and jump on board. And I think it's also important to be credibly neutral. You know, Blackrock, for example, is probably not going to jump on Franklin Templeton chain and so on. Another thing that Quinto is going to offer later, because right now we solve like, institutions have like three major problems coming on. Chain one is compliance, that you don't know who else is in this other pool, etcetera. So they don't want to commingle funds solves that problem.
00:20:05.132 - 00:20:25.900, Speaker C: Kinto. The other one is the security hacks, all that. And we also have insurance at the chain level. So Kinto offers a lot more security guarantees. And then the last one is private transactions. That is something that we plan to offer later through layer three on top of Kinto. So there is still within the KYC AML ecosystem, but then if you want to develop an application that requires everything private, then you can do it.
00:20:25.900 - 00:21:00.164, Speaker C: So talking about right now, we're focusing on users, because users, the same way we're having this conversation, and we don't know if it's going through Google, Amazon users five years from now. They shouldn't know if we are using Solana, Ethereum, Kinto, whatever, and they don't care. They shouldn't care. In the end, what we care is about creating value. And if we want to create value right now and not ten years later, waiting for regulations to change to what we would believe is the best for decentralization, then that's why we need to offer this middle way to be able to offer these assets that require these, these checks to come on chain today.
00:21:00.864 - 00:21:20.964, Speaker B: Are there going to be, do you think the growth of the ecosystem comes from apps that are new, apps that are basically Kinto specific, like KyC, like institutional apps? Or is it the, I don't know, tier one? Is it the existing ETH DeFi ecosystem that basically launches support for Kinto with this KYc support?
00:21:21.464 - 00:22:10.006, Speaker C: Yeah. The way I see it is that it's probably, it's probably first gonna be retail and retail getting larger and larger, and it's gonna. Right now you can see the hot ball of money in crypto really easily, but it gets getting bigger and you can see blast that got more than a billion dollar in deposit. And probably not much of that is institutional, although they probably made some deals with market makers that help getting the initial traction. But in order for Defi to grow, I think it's important to first offer a secure experience for users. And Kinto is going to have this unique value proposition for users. That is like, okay, you can access anything else you want on Mainnet, for example, access st, but access it through Kinto.
00:22:10.006 - 00:22:33.994, Speaker C: And do you get all the security properties? You get our wallet that we are really proud of the work that we have done, and you can try online everything. You don't need to worry about Metamask, you don't need to worry about gas, because everything is a sponsor, everything is through account abstraction. So it's much you don't, it doesn't seem like crypto, but you still get the non custodial benefit that nobody else can access your wallet. Only you can access your wallet, but you don't. It feels like Robinhood.
00:22:36.054 - 00:22:53.948, Speaker B: If you play the tape forward, let's call it five years or ten years. Ramon, are you still, eventually you won't want to use plaid, I'm assuming, for KYC. And eventually maybe you don't. Can you do KYC in a different way, leveraging something like ZK proofs and maybe walk us through your vision for like, what the future of KYC looks like on Kinto?
00:22:54.086 - 00:23:47.104, Speaker C: Yeah, I totally understand. And this is what has prevented, I think, a lot of crypto people from embracing KYC because the technology is there to not need KYC, because there is no reason for me to give my id when I can just prove with a zero knowledge proof that it's like, oh, I was born here and I'm over 18 years old, there is no need to send my id. So KYC is in ascend and also leave technology, but it's the one that is adopted by governments, banks, and we know how slow they move. And these institutions want to come on chain. They want to create products, they want to invest in products. But if we don't offer them the tools to meet their compliance checks, their compliance guy is not going to allow them to do so. So that's why offering this technology now and then maybe 510 years later, it's going to be either a serial knowledge proof or even something that, like Walt coin, is an alternative to KYC that has other problems, like Ptolemy said in the post.
00:23:47.104 - 00:24:02.034, Speaker C: But there's another alternative. Right now, KYC is the most adopted civil resistance technology that meets the regulation requirements. As soon as this changes, Kinto is going to replace that piece with something, with something else. I'll be the first one to do it because I want to do it.
00:24:05.294 - 00:25:08.646, Speaker A: Maybe a basic question, but do you lose? What are the trade offs here? Obviously, QSCML is important. I think it continued. But do you lose speed? Do you lose? I mean, there's an added friction when you talk about maybe going to another protocol, another chain, like a multi hop, like practically speaking, yes, it's possible. But I guess, like, are you inviting people, developers, to write these specific rules to say, hey, if you live in x jurisdiction and you're KyC in the US, you can only interact with so and so protocols and so you can't do that hop, but if you come from another place, you can. I'm curious, I mean, that can get really complex really quickly in the evolving regulatory landscape. And I'm thinking of, I was an investor in this company called Avalara, which does tax and calculates tax across every state. And that changes like literally every day for, and it's, I'm curious, like, that can be very costly for you guys.
00:25:08.646 - 00:25:16.864, Speaker A: Are you inviting a whole set of developers through incentives to write these permissions and rules for users?
00:25:17.024 - 00:25:59.140, Speaker C: Yes, as you say. I mean, this thing gets really complicated, especially with the long tail of assets. You know, if you want to put this exotic product, this exotic building on chain and tokenize it, I think that's going to require a lot of specific checks depending on which jurisdiction you're in. But we're focusing first on use cases that scale, and the obvious one is treasuries, and you can see maker. So RWas, I also don't like the name because it's everything, everything is RWAS. But it's like right now, the obvious use case, especially with the fed fund rate as 5%, is like treasuries and be able to allow people to use them as collateral. One of our launch partners, for example, is mounting protocol that is like a stable coin, but gives you the yield different than USDC that they keep the yield for themselves.
00:25:59.140 - 00:26:01.544, Speaker C: Mounting protocol gives the yield to users.
00:26:02.524 - 00:26:43.214, Speaker A: Yeah. When you, from a regulatory standpoint, and sorry if I keep asking about regulation, I know it can be boring, but I think that could be an advantage. Say a government less friendly comes to you and says, hey, can they come to you and say, hey, my understanding is we believe there are some users from this country that have KYC used gone through Kinto. Hand me over whatever it is. I want to see transaction history. I want to be able to tie the wallet to the person. Is there a backdoor? Is there a possibility to do that?
00:26:44.354 - 00:27:18.224, Speaker C: There won't be. I mean, initially, until we release governance, until we give all the power to everything to on chain governance, this is going to be possible. Then later what we want, once we put this in place, we want to just have a process approved by governance, that is like, okay, the authorities need to give you this, this and that. And then if this happens, then governance can decide to approve all these people. And all these people information will be revealed to the KYC provider. In this case, it will be, okay, this address is this id. And then the government can go talk with the KYC provider to get information.
00:27:19.084 - 00:27:35.354, Speaker A: Yeah. I want to make sure I understand something you said earlier, because it's going to follow. The next set of questions is in the scenario where synapse or plaid get hacked, that hacker is still not going to be able to tie your identity with the wallet.
00:27:35.514 - 00:27:38.494, Speaker C: No, because there is nothing stored in there.
00:27:41.474 - 00:28:10.514, Speaker A: I asked the question because in a scenario, for instance, where you're part of a multisig and there's five people, it's really the wrench attack that you're trying to prevent here. People can very easily, you know, if someone hacks Plaid, they all of a sudden know the five people on the billion dollar treasury. That's, that's an issue, right? I mean, in time, like ledger, for instance, you know, doxxed 80 people, high net worth people in crypto, right? And so that's an issue.
00:28:12.134 - 00:28:46.222, Speaker B: All right, I mentioned them in the pre roll. Now I'm going to bring them up again. It's arbitrum. Santi and I are really fed up with these high fees, and we're really excited to have teamed up with arbitrum for the next couple of months on Empire as the leading Ethereum scaling solution. Arbitrage now powers hundreds of decentralized apps across defi, perps, nfts, gaming, and a whole lot more. The team has showed us everything in the ecosystem, both now and what's to come, and we're really, really excited about it. Arbitrum allows both daily users and developers to interact with Ethereum at scale with low fees and faster transactions.
00:28:46.222 - 00:29:19.380, Speaker B: The way the team got me excited was through portal dot arbitrum IO. So my call to action to you is to get started by visiting portal arbitrum IO. Go experience on chain like it was meant to be. For a lot of empire listeners, your crypto is not just another number on the screen. It's part of your future. I know Santi and myself feel that way. Our security sponsor of this episode, Harpy, takes this responsibility seriously and is the only wallet security tool that shields users from both on chain threats and sneaky off chain signature attacks.
00:29:19.380 - 00:30:04.708, Speaker B: If you've ever been in that situation where you're moving quickly, you approve something on chain, you realize that the address might be a dubious address or you're really hoping that you could take that back. Harpy has you covered. Harpy can redirect your assets to your self custody vault ensuring they remain completely under your control, safe and sound. With Harpy's always on monitoring, you're not just detecting threats, you're actively blocking and recovering compromised assets from malicious transactions before they can even confirm. On chain, Harpy is the only wallet security solution that protected 100% of its users from attacks like the ledger one in q four, which was an off chain signature attack. So if you're serious about protecting your crypto investments, it's time to make the switch. Secure your wallet for free at Harpy IO, forward slash empire.
00:30:04.708 - 00:30:11.424, Speaker B: That's Harpy. H a r p I e IO, forward slash empire. If you want it to be even easier, just click the link in the show notes.
00:30:12.844 - 00:30:29.604, Speaker A: Should we transition a little bit into, since you started where you are today, the conversations you're having with partners, where's the platform? As I understand it, you have launched kind of an early beta. We'd love to understand where the product is today and the traction you're getting.
00:30:30.264 - 00:31:03.590, Speaker C: Yeah, our launch program started like two months ago because what you mentioned before about the friction and that is, it adds a bit more time to get onboarded onto Kinto. We split up this process so in the first phase, users were completing the KYC process. We have like already more than 6000 users verified. And then starting a week before. The week before, we let them create their smart account wallet. And every kinto wallet is kind of like your own Nosis safe. So it's like pretty secure by default.
00:31:03.590 - 00:31:39.454, Speaker C: But this all account abstraction, you don't need gas, you don't need signatures all with your fingerprinting, your pass key but it gives you that level of security. And now we have more than 4000 wallets have already been created. Starting two weeks from now. The next phase, we're gonna actually help users that got affected by a hack in the last two years on Defi. We're gonna give them an incentive to join on Kinto because the idea here is that we're gonna do everything we can to make sure that Kinto is safe and these things don't happen again. So that's gonna be the next phase. And then we're gonna start allowing people to deploy capital ahead of our full launch.
00:31:39.454 - 00:31:40.990, Speaker C: That is gonna be April 1.
00:31:41.182 - 00:31:43.354, Speaker B: Ramon, you guys, originally, I think.
00:31:45.254 - 00:31:45.566, Speaker C: You.
00:31:45.590 - 00:32:07.314, Speaker B: Guys are kind of more like an l a layer three in a way because you're built on Arbitrum. But originally built on optimism, is my understanding. And then about maybe two months ago, you guys officially announced that you had moved over to Arbitrum. Why have. Why did you make that switch? Why did optimism not work for you guys? And why'd you move to optimism? To Arbitrum?
00:32:07.694 - 00:32:14.894, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, we really like the optimism stack. And they were. First I see Santa celebrating. Yeah.
00:32:15.054 - 00:32:20.474, Speaker A: Frog proofs. And Arbitrum is just a superior piece of technology. Sorry. Why don't I just cut in and solve your problem?
00:32:20.774 - 00:32:51.676, Speaker C: I mean, it's true. I mean, technology wise, I say they're mostly identical, but arbitrum is the leader because they are farther ahead in the stage of a roll up, and they also have more TBL. But the reason why Arbitrum wasn't a choice when we started, because they didn't release this stack to create L2s. Yeah, we wanted to be on L2. That's another reason. Because also arbitrum was forcing people before to have to go through governance, and you have to get approved through governance for being a L2, because we want to be a L2, not a layer three. We are to arbitrum.
00:32:51.676 - 00:33:10.024, Speaker C: What basis? To optimism, to help explain it. And now we talk with arbitrum. And then they are so helpful. They replied really quickly that it was in comparison with optimism, we had a much better experience working with the arbitrum team, and that's why we suit. It was a no brainer for us on this point.
00:33:10.324 - 00:33:18.704, Speaker A: What is the, like, the licensing model? You know, you're paying some sort of fee to arbitrarily, right?
00:33:19.044 - 00:33:31.172, Speaker C: Yeah. Sequencer fees, temporary. They're still finalizing it. They just posted on the governance forum, I believe, last week or the last few days. And it's going to be approved, hopefully. And then that's the model. Around 10% sequence of fees.
00:33:31.228 - 00:33:56.534, Speaker A: So arbitrum didn't throw you a big fat grant to incentivize you to come and build an arbitram, just to be clear, because other l two s are. It's important, you know, from a bd standpoint, you know, when you think about. It's, I've heard some crazy deals in terms of grants and incentives, so, yeah, it's good to see that. What are you most focused on right now, from a product standpoint.
00:33:58.554 - 00:34:31.400, Speaker C: These last few weeks? Focusing on this wallet to make sure. I think it's, you know, I really, I'm a huge fan of Solana as well. I think the experience that we have right now, and Quinto matches Solana in terms of transaction in terms of user experience, what we can get with Phantom. So that's, that's my focus. And then now it's going to be focusing on getting the world out there. And that's why we're going to London to the, to the DAS conference. We're going to start creating more blog posts, explaining the world up there and getting the protocol ready for capital deployment end of March.
00:34:31.400 - 00:34:46.564, Speaker C: We're also completing several security of this. We're also partnering with hyper native security protocols. We want to have chain analysis. We want to have the chain secure because I have a lot of PTSD from my experience at Babylon, so I don't want to go through that pain again.
00:34:47.544 - 00:35:23.664, Speaker A: Yeah, maybe I want to educate. We know that a lot of exchange accounts get traded. This happened during the FTX collapse. This happens time and time again. You know, how do you prevent that mechanism from happening here? So say that IkYC, it's tied to my particular wallet. That wallet might have hundreds of interactions with other wallets. So presumably you say, okay, Santiago has these other interactive with these other wallets, say that someone comes to me and I sell that account, you know, I basically give them access to my cryptographic keys, and they can now sign on my behalf.
00:35:23.664 - 00:35:51.206, Speaker A: Is there a way to understand that? And how do you prevent that? Because then all of a sudden, you, you know, someone gets access to. It's a liability for me, perhaps, so I should be cautious. But I could also be hacked. You don't really know, right? Unless I'm attesting to, like, I sign a transaction with a message saying, I'm still here, it's me, it's not the Lazarus group, or it's not, you know, so and so. Yeah.
00:35:51.270 - 00:36:18.504, Speaker C: In short, it's really difficult and we cannot, it's akin to identity theft in the real world. But in your case that you were saying, if you, if you get it stolen, it's really easy. The other case is really easy that you eventually can prove as going through the Kyc saying, oh, that's not my account, give it back to me. That's really easy. But the case where you sell it willingly to someone else is probably going to take a while for the system to pick that up and then invalidate it.
00:36:18.924 - 00:36:40.864, Speaker A: Not that you will. Right. Because you can do it in a centralized exchange, hoping that that centralized exchange is probably not going to give that information back to authorities. But, yeah, how do you prove that? Humanity, actually, I'm curious. If someone gets hacked and you need to prove that it's actually not you controlling the keys, what's the mechanism to do that?
00:36:41.274 - 00:36:45.594, Speaker C: I mean, you force them to go through the KYC again and the liveness check and everything.
00:36:45.674 - 00:37:19.914, Speaker A: Yeah, okay, got it. Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. And just as a data point, like I've heard varying costs for KYC providers kind of are all over the place. When you talk about these partnerships, like can you talk about the speed and the cost? If you can't disclose specifics, I just like to understand like order of magnitude, like how long does it take? How expensive is it for you or the partner? You know, the total cost per user?
00:37:20.214 - 00:37:53.326, Speaker C: Yeah, the cost I can give the ranges. The cost of KYC change a lot. I mean, for individuals it can be one to then for businesses it's a lot more involved the process. So it takes $1015. The good thing about Kinto, because we have network effects, we can buy a lot of KYC processes at once and then make it cheaper and then establish that partnership. Because then they also ensure that they have also repeated business from us. So the unit economics make it out of make more sense then regarding time, it changes a lot by jurisdiction.
00:37:53.326 - 00:38:15.474, Speaker C: For example, you have us customer, it can take you 1 minute automatically. As you go through the process, you're approved. So it's actually frictionless if you are. For example, also if your id doesn't match your current address, then you also need to provide a different proof of address documents. So that can slow things down. So, but most, I would say 85% to 90% of the people, less than 24 hours.
00:38:17.054 - 00:39:11.344, Speaker A: It seems like there's a great opportunity, maybe not with Coinbase, because I remember when you were raising Coinbase, announced base and I was like, wait a minute, like this sort of, they already have 100 million users that are KYC and they already have base and l two. So what void are you gonna fill here? But this all led me to think, okay, like if you're, you talk about Phantom, you talk about other wallets, argent, like so many other wallets that have Kyc, wouldn't this be more of an opportunity to do b two b versus b two c? Like just go to the wallet. If a user is gonna create a wallet, like the aggregators, like Phantom. So Phantom's done a great job. It's easy on board, right? They create a wallet, you already have a lot of that information, or moonpay or whatever, immediately. By default, you also create the kinto, KYC, NFT and the wallet. Now Phantom, you would argue, why would they do that? The user can then just go and interact.
00:39:11.344 - 00:39:34.648, Speaker A: But a lot of the users in these wallets are interacting on chain naturally. It would be a good opportunity for you guys to, by default, be in that flow so you don't have to do it twice. You create the wallet in Phantom, it takes you 20 minutes to collect all this stuff and then immediately use the same set of docs in that timeframe to create the NFT. Like the Kinto NFT, right?
00:39:34.816 - 00:40:01.036, Speaker C: Yeah, no, that's exactly what we're thinking. And Moonpei and Cado, we're talking with them for this reason. The only thing, there is a bit of a legal problem there for data exchange agreement. For example, if they kYC with some other partner, there needs to be some legal process in place to make sure there can be exchange of data that is workable. This is a bit of engineering effort on both sides and a bit of legal paperwork. And we're working with some. It's similar.
00:40:01.036 - 00:40:32.694, Speaker C: For example, when a protocol builds on Kinto and then for some reason they need also personal data, they're going to have to sign this data sharing agreement so then they can retrieve data from plaid or Sina from the customers. It's similar to that, but with the partners. And it's a great idea working with this, with all these wallets because they already have onboarded. That's why also why we work with Synapse, because it's the biggest KYB provided in crypto. They work with binance. So they already have Kybe. A lot of people that are already in crypto.
00:40:34.154 - 00:40:45.694, Speaker A: And out of the 6000 people that have like onboarded so far, do you have an understanding of who they are? They're mostly retail. Are they some for businesses? Like who are these folks?
00:40:46.134 - 00:41:15.654, Speaker C: We have a few institutions that we have provided the KYB and they have KYB, but mostly it's retail because this phase we have focused on retail. They are a bit from everywhere in the world. We have probably from these 10,000 users that have started the process. We have around 1000 between the US and Canada. Then we have another probably 1000 western Europe. Then we have 500 Japan, Korea, and then we have a bunch also from other countries like Nigeria or India.
00:41:17.634 - 00:41:46.370, Speaker B: Ramon, can you take us in the room of, you mentioned Das. So at Das we have like Citi and Blackrock and JPMorgan and all these like the kind of classic big traditional institution speaking who when you, I know you've met with a lot of these folks already, like, can you take us inside the room into these conversations? Like, why haven't they played in Defi? What do they think of Kinto. What's stopping them from onboarding to Kinto today? What is their, I guess, current framework for this?
00:41:46.562 - 00:42:18.356, Speaker C: Yeah, great question. And it's really funny because when we talk with draft five people, they don't get some other things, but they immediately get, it's like, oh, everyone needs to be KYc in the chain. It's like, oh, they automatically get that value prop. They automatically get it. What has been preventing them from doing things on chain? And we have talked with some of these financial partners that recently on crypto, crypto, Twitter, they have been really vocal. It has been the lack of compliance and the commingling of funds. And this is interesting.
00:42:18.356 - 00:43:05.984, Speaker C: We talk even with VC's, crypto, VC's that do stuff on chain, and they even are afraid to do stuff on Abe because they don't know who their character party is. And even people like Galaxy, they have to do their own work to analyze another pool or a uniswap pool to decide if they are willing to take the compliance risk to put money there. So I think the compliance risk and the security risk, of course, defies smart contract hack. And then the lack of liquidity, because some of these things like Avyarc or provenance or there is no velocity of money, liquidity is really low and there is not so much stuff to do. So for the staff, what is safe, there wasn't anything to do for the stuff that there was a lot of to do, like in Ethereum Mainnet, there was no way to meet their compliance needs.
00:43:07.004 - 00:43:09.104, Speaker B: How does privacy tie into their needs?
00:43:10.524 - 00:43:13.704, Speaker C: You mean data privacy or user privacy?
00:43:14.764 - 00:43:19.316, Speaker B: It's more like trading privacy, basically. And I don't know how Kento has thought about that.
00:43:19.460 - 00:43:41.664, Speaker C: Yeah, that's what I was mentioning before with layer threes, being able to do layer threes and you can think like the aztec technology that they can do. So you can do that on top of kinto, and then it's great because you benefit from all the KYC AML network effects. But then you can do also if you need your private Dex or private perp, and then you want everything be private, you can create that roll up on top of kinto as a layer three.
00:43:42.644 - 00:43:57.654, Speaker B: Nice. I know you guys talked about RWAs briefly, but take us inside the world of RWAs, Ramon. And I know you mentioned it's a good quote, like everything is an RWA, but what kind of areas of RWAs are you excited about right now?
00:43:57.954 - 00:44:35.770, Speaker C: Right now we're really excited about treasuries. You know, you can see the growth of these protocols, like condo, bakked, even mounting protocol they have, because everyone wants safe collateral. That's one of the things. Because right now with RWAs, a lot of people are also thinking, oh, is RWAs just a bear market narrative or because last year is like, oh, RWAs are going to take over the world, and now, right now when the bull market starts, it's like, oh, nobody cares about RWAs. I want to make 100 x and bonk or these other tokens. The truth is somewhere in the middle. I think if you can get great collateral safe that you can then use as collateral to build on top, then that's going to increase the amount of liquidity, it's going to increase the amount of TVL.
00:44:35.770 - 00:45:00.134, Speaker C: And right now, 5% treasuries are a really appealing collateral. And imagine that you can. Enquint is one of the first products that we want to offer, that you can deposit USDC, then you convert it to this collateral that pays you 5%, and then you can borrow from it and buy something else. You can buy Steve, or you can even loop it if you want a collateral treasuries that gives you, instead of five, giving you six or 7% with a bit of risk, obviously.
00:45:01.634 - 00:45:08.574, Speaker B: Is there anything that Kinto unlocks that isn't possible today, but will be made possible because of kinto?
00:45:09.194 - 00:45:20.562, Speaker C: I think composability between RWA protocols is the main one and is the composability. Because right now, if you want to do something with centrifuges and then use it as collateral, to use somewhere else is really, really difficult to do.
00:45:20.658 - 00:45:29.202, Speaker B: Ron, this is a great chat. Anything that is obviously missing from this conversation that we should talk about, or Santi, anything that you're thinking through, I.
00:45:29.218 - 00:46:06.806, Speaker C: Just go back to the main point that the things that are preventing people to use crypto and that we get this mainstream app, I think, is security, the first one, and then user experience. And then once we solve these two use cases, the application is going to come. And I agree with Santi also that games, for example, is an obvious one. That is going to happen. And it's going to happen, I believe, in the next twelve to 18 months. And then these people are going to get comfortable with crypto. So then slowly we're going to be able to grow the number of users in more and more entrance use cases.
00:46:06.806 - 00:46:21.494, Speaker C: The biggest one is some of the asset management players. But eventually, I mean, from here to 20 years from now, is just going to be a constant gain of more use cases and more territory in a way.
00:46:23.754 - 00:46:52.454, Speaker A: Yeah. What I'm excited about is that hopefully this becomes the beachhead to get more people to, you know, for better words. Just appreciate that, like, doing Kyc is not like this huge breach. It's already being done at some point for you to interact on chain, whether you want to believe it or not. So if you're naive enough to understand that you're like a non. It's really not the case, but hope. But, but I think the flip will switch where people start seeing the benefit of and getting comfortable with the partners that you're using.
00:46:52.454 - 00:47:37.800, Speaker A: And the, you know, a lot of what we talked about here is the security and the way that this data is handled and, you know, doesn't have access to avoid a situation like ledger, right, where, you know, a lot of this information comes out. And then, and then ultimately, like, my thesis is like, Kyc is a very crude mechanism today. It constantly needs to be updated. A lot of it is information in the real world that is like, not actually very sound, but it's the best. We have, like utility bills and bank statements and all that stuff. There's a whole web of trust. But think about 510 years from now, your digital footprint becomes a better mechanism, a better inference to provide proof of humanity, to provide a track record of a credit history report.
00:47:37.800 - 00:48:37.038, Speaker A: Like, if you have thousands of interactions transactions on Aave, you always pay down the interest. If you've never been liquidated. That I think becomes a more complements the current KYC framework in a very nice way, because blockchains are data rich. So ultimately, if you become that beachhead to get most users to agree and sign up for Kinto, have this kinto NFT, you almost become an essential middleware for everything else in crypto and unlocks things like under collateralized loans. And I think it really, I get excited from a financial standpoint. Like, DeFi just becomes, you know, there's certain things that haven't worked because we haven't, you know, really figured out this and the civil resistance, like, for airdrops, for community engagement, become really, really essential. I always like to ask this question, like, if we bring you on in a year or two from now and Kinto doesn't work, it doesn't live up to your expectations, or, like, why would that be? Like, what are the.
00:48:37.038 - 00:48:40.274, Speaker A: What are the scenarios in your mind where Kinto doesn't get off the ground?
00:48:41.254 - 00:49:19.150, Speaker C: Yeah, there are few, as always. Yeah. In a startup, there are so many ways you can die and only a few ways that you can be successful. One of them can be, even if regulation gets really, really friendly and then, oh, we don't need KYc, and there is just one designated, for example, if the US says, okay, we're going to approve everything Defi, and then this base is going to be the source of truth. And then it's like, oh, if you have an attestation on base that can decide the winner one way, then another one is like, oh, rwas. That is going to be one of our first focus. Don't get any traction, don't get any TVL.
00:49:19.150 - 00:49:32.454, Speaker C: So then Kinto fails to get $100 million in TBL. Another one can be, we suffer a security incident. So then for us, if we're focused on security and then we suffer a security incident, that would be a death now. So those are three ways that Kinto can fail.
00:49:34.194 - 00:49:56.462, Speaker A: Yeah. Well, you're a repeat founder, and I mentioned, I really like backing rebeat founders for someone that is new getting started in the space. What would be your best advice or set of advices for them if they're new to crypto and building something, you.
00:49:56.478 - 00:50:38.626, Speaker C: Want to build something on crypto, it's tricky because, you know, I come from YC and I come from the, from web two, and YC has always been like, the way to go to get the advice about how to get started. And all the advice from YC still applies. So I would say this is a good. But then there are a lot of things where it doesn't apply in capital formation, capital location, incentives. The way we, the way you onboard users is totally different. So I would follow your curiosity and I would pair, for example, y combinator with the Andreessen Horowitz crypto school. I think those are good resources to get the high level and then get a sense of how you can, because making the switch from building a company to building a protocol, and you don't need to build a protocol per se.
00:50:38.626 - 00:50:49.404, Speaker C: That's another thing that you need. Maybe you don't need a token. You can build, assess and crypto. Maybe that's a business model, or maybe you need the protocol and the token and incentives and the community, but all the, all the, all the paths are available.
00:50:50.984 - 00:51:10.120, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a good observation. I think this is a good place to end it. Perhaps we'll see more and more businesses just build on top of protocols and without a token, but just, you know, so it's a great point. That's it for me. I mean, Ramon, great, great having you on. I think it's exciting what you guys building and, you know, thanks for coming on and sharing your your insights. Yanno, anything else?
00:51:10.272 - 00:51:12.360, Speaker B: No, all good. Ramon, rooting for you, man.
