00:00:00.280 - 00:00:27.774, Speaker A: My end of year price target for 2026 is 150k that I think is very cheap. Id even bump it up to 2025 at this point. And the reason that I think its achievable is because you now have an entire population, the wealthiest country on the planet, primed to understand bitcoins value in a way that they have never been primed to understand.

00:00:59.708 - 00:01:03.356, Speaker A: Hey, it's great to, great to be here. Thanks for having us back on. Thanks for having us back.
00:01:03.380 - 00:01:04.744, Speaker C: Yana, nice to see you.
00:01:05.124 - 00:01:40.424, Speaker B: Yeah, you too. All right, guys, so I want to, um, here, here's like my vision for this conversation. I think there's already been a lot of podcasts about like, contextualizing macro and like, why did SVB happen? And kind of what's going to happen with this credit contagion? I want to try to draw a line from that kind of stuff, momo. I want to figure out how to draw this like through line from that into crypto. And I think the place to start is a question for you, Avi. When I look at the market, and I'm not as deep into the market as you guys are, there's like two very conflicting signals. One signal is that the Fed, everyone kind of expected the Fed to hike again later in the year.
00:01:40.424 - 00:02:11.108, Speaker B: The other signals, like the two year is going down, suggest the Fed might pivot the two year, cross the Fed funds. Thats pretty good sign that the Fed is going to turn around here. Theres this rush in demand for safety into the two year and things like that. But then you have inflation data coming in hot. I think the big question in the market today is, what is the Fed going to do? And Im curious. And then that obviously trickles down into the risk assets like bitcoin and ETH and stuff like that. So, avi, how are you thinking about this right now?
00:02:11.216 - 00:03:14.854, Speaker A: I think I would reframe that as what is the Fed going to do into, what can the Fed possibly do? It's interesting. The move in rates could be attributed to the Fed cutting. It could be attributed to a slowdown in growth expectations. It could be attributed to a rising risk of a severe recession versus the mild recession that people were, people were thinking of. Id say that this is a very, very uncertain macro environment in the short term, because really what we need is we need the data to keep coming in and for us to get just a better grasp of whats going on. But one thing that has been happening very constantly in this market over the last year is that these things tend to get priced in very quickly. So the volume of s and p is up a ton relative to historic standards.
00:03:14.854 - 00:04:13.884, Speaker A: Bitcoin has been whipping around, not relative to historic standards, but its been whipping around. And whats actually happening right now is that youre getting these narratives and these moves priced in very, very, very quickly. So I look at where rates were three days before SBB went down and a day after SVB went down, and it was a complete and total shift. It was a massive shift. And so what that tells you is that where the market is today, it's not really telling you anything really interesting, because the market keeps changing so drastically and so dramatically every week, week to week. Three weeks before, sorry. In the beginning of Fed, you had a 9% chance of the Fed hiking 50 bps in their March meeting.
00:04:13.884 - 00:05:10.042, Speaker A: And then at the beginning of March, you had a 70% chance of them hiking 50 bps. And then now you have effectively a potential no hike price. Diplosis. Looking at the market to give you direction into what the Fed is going to do has not been particularly useful. Its changing so constantly. And so what weve been focused on and what ive been focused on when it comes to trading and when it comes to investing is understanding relative to expectations. What do we think is going to happen? So when it was priced at 9%, the risk of a 50 bid pike, well, what do we think about that? How is the market positioned for that? We felt the market was way under position for the risk of a 50 bit pike.
00:05:10.042 - 00:05:39.214, Speaker A: And when it was at 70, we thought the market was way over positioned. So its actually about where people are putting their capital relative to your own expectations, really looking hard at when you think the market is wrong and coming to your own conclusions, because effectively the market has been wrong a lot over the last eight weeks. The market is consistently wrong. And that's what we're seeing in this.
00:05:39.714 - 00:05:42.370, Speaker B: Jonah, what's your take on this yeah.
00:05:42.482 - 00:06:36.528, Speaker C: It'S funny you mentioned interest rate volatility, avi. I'm not an interest rate options trader, but I speak to many of them, being told that the volatility you're seeing realized volatility in short term interest rates is three x. What was realizing during some of the worst moments of the financial crisis in 2008. So there's a bit of a reflexive mechanism. The Fed and the banks that are teetering right now are all very focused on this short term interest rate market in order to inform their decisions. And when you have that kind of volatility, volatility driven by everybody wondering or trying to price what the Fed is going to do and what's going to happen next with this banking crisis, the institutions themselves that are causing this volatility are also watching it and being inflexibly impacted by it. So it's a bit of a spiral in some respects, for investors.
00:06:36.528 - 00:07:35.770, Speaker C: If you get caught the wrong way on it, ultimately, the way that it's feeding into crypto, from my perspective, is liquidity is getting worse. Capital is scarce as a result of suddenly becoming more difficult to access banking. Trading firms require capital to provide tight liquidity. So bid ask is wider. That, again, reflexively creates a more volatile gap year, more liquid market, more opportunity to get it right, but equally, a lot of risk and a lot of transaction costs to get in and out of trades. And ultimately, I think the most interesting feature of all of this chaos was that during the weekend, after Silvergate and SBB went down, you saw bitcoin and ETH really start to rip. I mean, that just shows you that when there's a flight to quality and a run on the banks, crypto has sort of entered a new paradigm.
00:07:35.770 - 00:07:58.814, Speaker C: It's exited the paradigm of strong macro correlation, and it's entered a new decorrelated paradigm where it represents, represents a different type of diversified risk asset. Once again, I think that's super relevant. I think that's when you get one of those paradigm shifts in the way of market trades, there's usually a pretty exciting entry point for something lucrative.
00:07:59.434 - 00:08:55.836, Speaker A: Yeah, I'll push back. I'll give you a little poke on that, which is that I think these things can exacerbate moves in the short term. But bitcoin was also following equities on the way back up a little bit, but it radically outperformed equities. And so I think what, like, even relative to historic expectations, and so what I think you get when you get these narratives, like a bank, bank failures leading people to go look at crypto. You're effectively pouring fuel on the fire for a move when risk moves, as opposed to, hey, this is going to cause a decoupling between risk and bitcoin. It actually, in my opinion, probably will over a six to twelve month time period. And I liken this back to back to 2021.
00:08:55.836 - 00:10:12.536, Speaker A: Like, if I'm going to make an analog to the crypto markets, it's like the same, same way that from Jan or sorry, from March of 21 to April or sorry, to July of 21, bitcoin went up a ton to 60k, came back down to 30, went to 40k. So kind of like chopped around in actually like a range. And while that happened, Solana went from $20 to 200, but the moves were actually correlated month over month. It would just so happen that Solana would go up way more than bitcoin when bitcoin was going up. And then when it came down, it came down a lot, but it ended up because of those up moves outperforming over time, even during a period of flat behavior. I think thats probably what well see from bitcoin is that you have this fuel on the fire. Now people are now sitting here, they're thinking to themselves, hey, this is actually kind of interesting, that the type of person that had their money with SBB that got rugged by them is actually a type of person that would be very likely to come into crypto because they're generally further down the risk spectrum.
00:10:12.536 - 00:10:53.970, Speaker A: So they're looking, okay, if I can't trust banks, if we're literally going into a potential banking crisis, which I don't necessarily think we are in a grand way, but it does break open the possibility of, well, maybe I can't trust my bank, which is very powerful, which is a very, very powerful tool. Well, poor security will fire when bitcoin starts going up. People start piling into it, they start going, okay, I don't want to miss this. I don't want to be on the sidelines. Hey, this might actually be a safe place. So I guess to round up my point, I still think we're tied at a bit to risk assets. But over a six to twelve month time period, I think that bitcoin can radically outperform because of this new narrative thats emerged mechanically.
00:10:54.042 - 00:11:28.434, Speaker B: How does this translate? How does this price transmission happen? Is it big macro thats trading bitcoin right now because theyre left bell curve take, banking system collapses, bitcoin might rip, or is it another left bell curve take? The Fed is probably going to slow, maybe it's less likely that the fed hikes. So, I don't know, risk assets start ripping, and bitcoin's like, farthest out on the risk spectrum, so they start buying bitcoin. Or is this just crypto native funds getting excited again and piling back into bitcoin? Like, what's this price action actually looking like?
00:11:28.514 - 00:12:10.714, Speaker C: I would think it's macro funds and crypto funds. I would think it's smart macro thinkers and people who are deeply experienced in the microeconomics of crypto who are buying this. I mean, if you look at what price action has done since March 10, the s and p is unchanged, effectively, maybe up 1%. Crypto is up, or bitcoin alone is up 25% from that day. These are big divergences in these two asset classes. And obviously, the context for that is interest rate volatility. There's no question that macro funds are saying, hey, bitcoin and crypto in general, this is a provenance hedge.
00:12:10.714 - 00:13:27.854, Speaker C: If you put your deposits at a bank, it doesn't matter if it's Silicon Valley bank or JP Morgan. Your job is not to analyze that bank's balance sheet and think about whether your deposits are safe or not. That's an investor's job as a depositor, you just dump it in there. Then one day, if you wake up and say, hey, I actually thought I had money, and I don't. Well, maybe I do, but the FDIC owns my deposit now, and I'm stuck in their receivership procedure for nine months, that's not ideal either. So anybody who's keeping cash at a middle tier regional bank, anybody who's looking at the broader macro picture and trying to think about what an unfurling of smaller banks might mean for the economy and for flows of funds, which is macro, guys, really bitcoin, even if 1% of that community decides to stick a little bit more capital into bitcoin, which you can store on your ledger nano and keep in your vault and you own it, unless you lose the keys, of course. I think those sorts of thought processes are probably going through the minds of people who are trying to, for a career, being deeply analytical about what this actually means, what this banking issue means.
00:13:29.074 - 00:14:10.936, Speaker A: Yeah. What's interesting here is that two years ago, three years ago, whenever I would talk about bitcoin as a monetary asset, and I think that's where this discussion is mainly focused on right now, just because of current events, obviously, crypto is much more than that, but as a baseline. Well, why does bitcoin have value. And my conversations would always start like this. They would always go, well, you as somebody that's in the first world, that's in the US, you don't need to worry about it as much. But there are countries around the world where banks fail frequently. There are countries around the world that experience high inflation rates.
00:14:10.936 - 00:14:52.770, Speaker A: There are countries around the world where you can't trust your government or your central bank to manage monetary policy effectively. And today you dont have to qualify that anymore with that first statement as much. Right. I still have infinitely more trust in the Fed and the US government to manage the dollar than I would want to insult anybody or name countries. But for countries that dont have this effective monetary policy. But its one of those paradigm shift moments, as John has said. Whereas if youre sitting here in the US now, thats something that unfortunately you have to think about.
00:14:52.770 - 00:15:22.680, Speaker A: So as much as we dont want depositors to be investors, we dont want depositors to have to worry about that. We dont want that mental cognitive load on these guys. People have it now. You unfortunately have to think like that. It actually goes back, if you really dig deep. Well, it goes back to the Fed raising rates in an unprecedented fashion. So SBB threw their money into 1.68,
00:15:22.680 - 00:16:01.544, Speaker A: yielding mbs for ten years. Because at the time, the Fed was sitting there saying inflation is transitory, and dont worry, were not going to raise rates. Thats not happening. And however naive it was at the time, they trusted the Fed inflation strategy, very unlikely to raise rates. Okay, were going to listen to you guys and were going to go put our money in this, because we dont think that theres a ten signal move on the horizon. And in a world where mistakes happen in a system that is as fragile as the one that we have, you have to take steps to protect yourself. And what are those steps? Well, maybe bitcoins, one of them.
00:16:01.544 - 00:16:22.164, Speaker A: That is the path of logic that a lot of the smartest guys in the world are taking right now. A lot of the macro funds are realizing that. A lot of the high net worth individuals are realizing. You just walk down that logic path and you come to the realization relatively quickly that our system is imperfect. And when you're faced with an imperfect system, you need a hedge.
00:16:22.744 - 00:17:15.774, Speaker C: Yeah, and hedging, you don't need to. It's not like if your portfolio is 60% stocks, 40% bonds, and then you look at this and think, gosh, things could get a little hairy here. I need to move into bitcoin. You're not going to go from 60 40 stocks, bonds to 10% stocks, 10% bonds, 80% bitcoin and ETH. Right? All you have to do is move a little bit of your money into bitcoin or ETH or both for the asymmetry of these fat right tailed assets to protect you if something crazy does happen. So it's not like we're expecting the macro community or pension funds or real money to just start pouring capital into crypto, but we're expecting it to trickle in pretty steadily. And the feds, between a rock and a hard place right now, they have supply side inflationary pressures and a banking crisis.
00:17:15.774 - 00:17:21.770, Speaker C: They sort of have to pick what they want to fix. They can't fix both problems at the same time.
00:17:21.842 - 00:17:22.546, Speaker A: And that's.
00:17:22.690 - 00:17:36.734, Speaker C: Avi, you actually tweeted it. It's pretty hilarious and super on point tweet where you saying, hey, bitcoins. Bitcoins trading like it's an alternative banking system or something. And, you know, at the end of the day, kind of it.
00:17:37.474 - 00:17:52.298, Speaker B: But do you really think that. So, avi, that. I mean, but what. What you guys are saying really resonates with me. I don't know if you guys remember wences Casaris, he started Zappo, which then got sold to Coinbase, became Coinbase custody. But he. I remember he had this line, I forget when I heard it, like 2015 or 2016 or something.
00:17:52.298 - 00:18:31.844, Speaker B: He said, bitcoin makes an incredible amount of sense to folks outside of the United States because their government oftentimes doesn't work and their banking system doesn't work. The reason the United States is the hardest country in the world to explain bitcoin is because your money works and your government works or your banking system works and your government works. And so I think that obviously resonates with me. It resonates with the three of us. But for these big macro funds, part of me is a little bit skeptical that that's why they're buying bitcoin here. Part of me thinks that, like, they're just looking to get out on the risk spectrum again. And.
00:18:32.704 - 00:18:47.752, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't think so, because, I mean, like, it's. Yeah, I mean, the. The easiest way to look at is, okay, like, Goldman has a. As a high retail interest basket. Yeah, barely. It's not. It's like, not up, like 2%.
00:18:47.752 - 00:18:50.584, Speaker A: Right. You go. Go look at, like, the Ark funds. Go look at Tesla.
00:18:50.624 - 00:18:51.160, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:18:51.312 - 00:19:22.534, Speaker A: Go look at, like, you know, tech stocks. Right. It's very clear to me that the majority of money that's driving bitcoin it's not like, and you saw this in the beginning of January, by the way, so the beginning of January, everything ripped together. QQQ was ripped with bitcoin, ark ripped everything that you would assume. When people are like, okay, we're risk on, let's go get long. All of that stuff ripped alongside of bitcoin. And that's not true this time.
00:19:22.534 - 00:19:34.898, Speaker A: Bitcoin is actually. I mean, what's actually ripped relative to historic standards? Gold and bitcoin. So that tells you something a little bit different. Yeah. Right. We know why gold's ripping.
00:19:34.986 - 00:20:22.938, Speaker C: It's China. China buying. I mean, who knows? Maybe they're letting some of the 10 trillion worth of us dollar denominated securities roll off, investing that into things like gold. And, hey, maybe bitcoin, they might not be publicizing that. That investment decision, but the user experience of the dollar is deteriorating. If the Fed and the treasury were just stable custodians providing predictable open banking access and a really well controlled 2% inflation target, I think people would be happier to use the dollar instead. The institutions in Washington, some of them at least least, are weaponizing the dollar, requisitioning the dollars that other governments thought they had, particularly Russia.
00:20:22.938 - 00:21:09.760, Speaker C: And so I think a lot of people running governments that oversee billions of citizens are starting to say, hey, maybe I should diversify a little bit. Maybe this dollar might not be as stable as we thought forever. Maybe something a little bit more immaculately conceived, like bitcoin, can protect 1% to my portfolio better than us treasuries would have done. I don't know if. It's an interesting question you asked, though, Jano, about are macro funds actually buying because bitcoin is a solution for emerging markets? Maybe not, but we're in a different paradigm now. As Avi and I started talking about. It's like there was the 2010s where it was just a hunt for yield, right? Oh, a money losing startup that basically wework.
00:21:09.760 - 00:21:34.468, Speaker C: Sure, whatever. We'll put money in it now. We're not in that paradigm anymore. We're at the beginning of the super cycle of some sort of future of money and a clearly unpegged inflation regime. So what does that mean? I think macro funds are hunting for the assets that are going to perform in that paradigm, and bonds aren't one of those assets anymore.
00:21:34.616 - 00:21:37.068, Speaker A: So, Jonah, I've been waiting for the.
00:21:37.076 - 00:21:53.868, Speaker B: Word super cycle to come back, man, and I'm happy you dropped it. So, Avi, do you think we are setting up for. Is this a monster bitcoin rally that is upon us, or is this a nice little bitcoin rally fades off into a little ETH rally into alts, and it's a nice little bump.
00:21:53.956 - 00:22:29.792, Speaker A: Yeah. On the short term, that's actually what I think. Over the next three months. That is what I think what this does is the same thing that COVID did in March of 2020, which is that it shifts peoples mindset to be a lot more open to crypto than it was previously, so that when the time is right, they will start flooding it. My end of year price target for 2026 is 150k. That I think is very cheap. Even bump it up to 2025 at this point.
00:22:29.792 - 00:23:10.884, Speaker A: And the reason that I think it's achievable is because you now have an entire population, the wealthiest country on the planet, primed to understand bitcoin's value in a way that they have never been primed to understand it before. And so, regardless of what happens, let's take a scenario where this is it. Credit Suisse gets bailed out, everybody ends up happy. There's not a single other bank that fails. Everything goes back to normal. If we get a mild recession, the Fed starts cutting risk, starts ripping all of the narratives. Bitcoin fade away.
00:23:10.884 - 00:23:45.724, Speaker A: Bitcoin does extremely well in that scenario still, because when it's risk on, the population has been primed to think of bitcoin as a real asset now, in many ways, as an asset that can actually potentially have value, if this hadn't happened, then we probably would have gone up less. When the macro environment shifts and risk comes up, the way that I think about it is this is fuel for the eventual explosion of BTC and eventual adoption of BTC, it just ratchets up that adoption curve.
00:23:46.344 - 00:24:20.058, Speaker C: Interestingly enough, as that adoption curve ratchets out, all supercycles that we talk about in a commodities market are driven by demand. The big one in oil that happened in the two thousands was because China opened up and just started consuming a ton of commodities in bitcoin, I think we all. Obviously, this is the Empire podcast. We all agree that demand for crypto is going to go up over time. It's got a killer app already. But against that backdrop, you have something that almost never happens in commodity markets, which is in 2024, the supply of bitcoin is going to get cut in half.
00:24:20.186 - 00:24:20.450, Speaker A: Right.
00:24:20.482 - 00:24:22.938, Speaker C: It's not even a constant supply side picture.
00:24:23.066 - 00:24:24.058, Speaker B: I was going to ask how that.
00:24:24.106 - 00:24:25.490, Speaker A: Yeah, how to have bananas.
00:24:25.522 - 00:24:36.026, Speaker C: And then where's half the bitcoin? Like, I don't know. I think at some point, you have to look at the last three of these things and the price action that occurred after them.
00:24:36.170 - 00:24:36.810, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:24:36.962 - 00:24:46.274, Speaker A: Also, just from a liquidity perspective right now, Jonah, if I wanted to go buy $100 million of bitcoin, how much do you think I'm moving the price?
00:24:46.974 - 00:24:53.674, Speaker C: Depends how sloppy you are, Avi. You're a careful guy. I think you'd probably move it by 1%.
00:24:54.374 - 00:24:57.950, Speaker A: 100 million is not that much money to move $400 billion.
00:24:58.022 - 00:25:00.326, Speaker B: 100 million is moving the price of.
00:25:00.350 - 00:25:03.594, Speaker C: 1% in this market right now. Absolutely.
00:25:04.054 - 00:25:05.542, Speaker B: That is more than I. Wow.
00:25:05.678 - 00:25:19.782, Speaker C: Maybe during some of the battleship liquidity, ultra stable environments of. Of maybe last summer, maybe 25 bits, 30 bps. But right now, good luck.
00:25:19.918 - 00:25:23.398, Speaker B: Yeah, it's a remarkably low amount of this market, 1%.
00:25:23.486 - 00:25:54.124, Speaker A: So all it takes is a couple large players just start allocating to kickoff some time. Really nulls, which I think is actually what happened, which is why bitcoin rallied so hard from twenty k to twenty six. It was very likely a few large players had decided to allocate. I think that there's there, as far as I understand it. And actually, John would have better insight into this, given where he sits post SBB. There were a lot of macro funds hitting up desks, asking them about bitcoin. Now, whether they bought or not.
00:25:54.124 - 00:26:27.232, Speaker A: I think they did, but the interest has gone up tremendously since SBB went down. Now, I still don't necessarily think that starts an immediate run. I'm still on the side of we need risk to be okay. I don't think bitcoin is hitting 30k best and p trace 3700. It's just very unlikely from my perspective. But it does set up for bitcoin outperformance over time. Yeah, sorry, go ahead, John.
00:26:27.408 - 00:26:49.846, Speaker C: I was going to say, avi, you hit the nail on the head there. When you're a liquidity provider, you have some people that are consistently trading with you, consistent counterparties. You have some people that show up once in a blue moon, and then you have the people that come out of the woodwork pretty much only when something extraordinary is going on and you realize that you're just their backstop, provided.
00:26:49.910 - 00:26:51.062, Speaker A: You'Re still around, which a lot of.
00:26:51.078 - 00:26:53.662, Speaker C: Trading firms aren't anymore after the events.
00:26:53.678 - 00:26:54.254, Speaker A: Of the last year.
00:26:54.294 - 00:27:15.106, Speaker C: But it's funny. We got in that last bucket of you're our backstop. We're not really your friends. We need you right now. We've had more of that inquiry in the last week than we had during FTX, which tells you something tells you a lot, Avi.
00:27:15.130 - 00:27:39.562, Speaker B: How does this think. And then, Jonah, I want to get your take on the same question, too. How does this impact how you think about other narratives in crypto, like the alt l one trade or even just ETH? BTC has been falling a lot. Like, how does this change how you think about ETH or l two s? Would love to get your thought on. I know you play a lot in sushi and stuff and different protocols. And how does this change how you think about this stuff?
00:27:39.738 - 00:28:03.214, Speaker A: Yeah, I'll say that. I'll talk about BTC for a second. The story of this year, when it comes to majors is supply. So on the BTC side, you have the mount Gox coins that are coming out. You've got this 40,000 BTC that are being auctioned off by the. Auctioned off by the state. On the east side, you have the unlocks from Shanghai that are around the corner.
00:28:03.214 - 00:28:46.644, Speaker A: Although actually, I don't know if you guys saw this, but Lido, unfortunately, won't be ready to process withdrawals when Shanghai comes along, which is contributing to a little bit of heaviness on Lido, which I do think it's a little silly. The entire point of Lido is to stake ETH. So that was. That was unprecedented. But, you know, so I think what we're seeing right now is we're seeing mainly, well, two. Two things. One, there was that on ETH, there was that story on that New York AG came out and they actually had two, three paragraphs on why they thought ETH might be a security.
00:28:46.644 - 00:29:26.840, Speaker A: And then also you have the fears, the fears about Shanghai, which I think are both contributing to BTC underperformance. And then you have, on the buy side, people are the type of person that's entering crypto right now that's driving prices. Are everybody that we've just talked about. So it's the people that are buying bitcoin because it's a monetary base asset and they're not buying Ethereum. Right. It's not the Silicon Valley folk that are buying Ethereum because it's going to be the platform for every new application that's built in web3, which I think was a lot of the outperformance before it was these tech focused guys. Now that participant in the market, are these macro focus guides, right, or girls buying bitcoin.
00:29:26.840 - 00:30:10.702, Speaker A: And right now, ETH just has a lot of headwinds because of that, because bitcoin has the narrative and ETH has the supply coming. Live in Shanghai now, at some point Gox is going to start distributing and at some point I think the supply for bitcoin starts to come alive a little bit more and then ETH BTC can start to outperform. But id say Im tactically bearish ETH BTC for the next two months and then ill probably flip tactically bullish on ETH BTC. I think this is definitely the most bitcoin denominated ive been in a while and anecdotally that actually isnt true for a lot of crypto natives.
00:30:10.798 - 00:30:14.498, Speaker B: Yeah jonah, agree or disagree with that? I agree.
00:30:14.546 - 00:31:19.854, Speaker C: Until the halving comes up and then you probably need to be short EbTC. Again, that's a very good point. I think what's interesting is normally when crypto pukes, bitcoin dominance rises because bitcoin is the bellwether of space and one of the biggest adoption. I think it would be really telling if you get a powerful rally in crypto where bitcoin dominance increases. I think that tells you that maybe some of the the froth and the heat in web3 is cooling off a little bit and bitcoin is proving its macroeconomic and geopolitical value to a broader participant base than young people who are passionate about web3 and all of its promise, which I believe it has. But the Gartner hype cycle, where are we on that right now for web3? Probably cooling off a bit. And I think bitcoin is coming out of a trough of disillusionment into I think a demand driven steady long term uptrend with plenty of immediate term and dips to buy, hopefully.
00:31:19.854 - 00:31:59.260, Speaker C: This is wild job. I think just looking at my screener here, my dashboard, I dont think that this year looks like previous crypto years where you see bitcoin and ETH rally and then you get a follow through with kind of a levered alt up trade. There's a real divergence. If you sort by year to date returns dominated in ETH, there's a pretty spectacular divergence of returns amongst a lot of relevant tokens. It's not just like alts are trading like this levered ETH bucket anymore. The wheat is getting separated from the chaff right now 100%.
00:31:59.332 - 00:33:00.124, Speaker A: That's also what makes it great for active traders. And I think we said this on our previous, on our previous cast, but there's a real tightening in the market happening right now where people are pulling their money from bad assets and putting them in good assets, and those bad assets tend to just decay over time because you have I mean crypto gad is almost, I think the entire market this year and last year has almost always been a supply story. You have teams that are unlocking, you have investors that are unlocking. And the only people that arent selling are the people that really believe in their product. Because retail is not in the market anymore. Theres not this large organic demand that can absorb tens of millions or hundreds of millions of dollars that are being emitted by the investors and by the team. What you get is you get this decay from projects that are bad and you get a basing from projects that are good where the team and investors are willing to hold on because they actually believe in the product long term.
00:33:00.124 - 00:33:32.384, Speaker A: And thats really good. Thats really good for crypto. To go back to your point, Jonah, about BTCD is very calming and nice to see BTCD go up on this rally. Its like okay. To me what it means is that theres real money coming in, right. And I think at some point in the future this will just always happen. Once bitcoin gets to a certain level and it gets high enough, my bet would be 40 to 45k.
00:33:32.384 - 00:34:04.346, Speaker A: Then you start to see some really crazy. Then you start to see your five xs in a week. Then you start to see a lot of retail come back in the market. And maybe you start to see the trash start to rally more aggressively than the stuff that's good. But for the time being, this is actually a really great investment environment for fundamental investors too. So you can actually go look at projects that are doing good stuff. I mean there's an l two building on, building on BTC stacks.
00:34:04.346 - 00:34:30.994, Speaker A: And you go look at them, their transaction counts are up a ton. Ever since ordinals came out, their user interfaces for a lot of the protocols they're being built on pretty solid. The full disclosure, we do own it, you know, and it's these things. It's like, okay, well, things are actually developing, things are actually, things are actually getting used. There's, there's real progress that's being made. And that's a, that's a, that's a beautiful thing to see.
00:34:32.774 - 00:34:40.274, Speaker B: What do you think bitcoin dominance ends at? It's at what, 45 now? Somewhere between 45 to 50 now maybe?
00:34:41.334 - 00:35:33.734, Speaker A: Yeah, I think um. I dont like calling specific levels because I think its very context dependent on how we there. But my view on bitcoin dominance would be that effectively until either bitcoin trades 30 to 35 in the short term, or we get past Shanghai and we start worrying about Mount Gox unlocks those are the two things that are going to top BTCD. So if we get to 35k in the next month, two months, then Im probably calling a top one BTCD. Or if were in August of this year, Im probably calling a top one without bitcoin and probably call it top one BTCD.
00:35:34.114 - 00:36:05.526, Speaker B: All right, quick break from the show. There is this kind of overuse cliche saying in crypto, but it's true. Bear markets are building and everyone tells you that and everyone knows it. What people don't know is that if you're building apps in crypto and building apps in web3 without using quick node, you are building on hard mode. So quick note is is this amazing blockchain development platform. It reduces costs, streamlines the time to market for your app, and it offers consistent performance at scale. For folks that have built apps, you will know that there are a couple key points here.
00:36:05.526 - 00:36:53.580, Speaker B: One, Quicknode offers unlimited endpoints across 18 different chains and 35 different networks. They have response times that are two and a half times faster than any of their competitors, 99.99% uptime and a dedicated 24/7 customer support team. If you've been listening to Empire for a while, you might know that I am no gigabrain developer, but I do know a lot of devs and a lot of great product teams at other places. So when I see Coinbase and Twitter and Adobe and OpenSea and doing analytics, all leveraging and trusting quick node to power their business, that's when we get excited and that's when we want to partner with them. They're the best solution for any leading crypto and web3 company that is seeking an end to end blockchain development platform right out of the box. So my message to you, get off hard mode.
00:36:53.580 - 00:37:17.280, Speaker B: Let quick node handle the blockchain infrastructure. Let quick note handle the security. Let quick note handle the performance while you focus on building beautiful products for your users, visit quicknode.com. Super easy. You can use code empire. You'll get a free month on their build plan, so don't forget to use code empire. Santi and I got to get credit for this one so they know that we sent you and you will get a first month free.
00:37:17.280 - 00:37:27.374, Speaker B: Hope you guys enjoy it. Uh, Shanghai, you think will be short term, short term selling negative for ETH, long term bullish.
00:37:27.754 - 00:37:56.490, Speaker C: I mean, the way that they've designed Shanghai, it's kind of hard to pull too much ETH out of basically the pool of stake deep that's out there. It can't be withdrawn quickly. There's congestion in the queue to withdraw. There's a limit to the, there's a bottleneck in that pipeline to withdraw. So I think. I don't really foresee a massive dump occurring on Shanghai. I think you just sort of watch the congestion queues and trade accordingly.
00:37:56.490 - 00:38:04.216, Speaker C: I don't think the sort of event everybody's making it out to be in terms of a big price mover, I don't see a lot of volatility around that.
00:38:04.320 - 00:38:28.718, Speaker B: Yeah, I want to get your guys take on things other than bitcoin and ETH, and one of them is USDC. And the peg you started to see different. I think it was like Jane street and Doctor. I think you guys were dumping a little bit. Jonah or DRW maybe. I don't know, I might be totally botching who this was. But anyway, some institutions that I, that I think held a lot of USDC were starting to dump it.
00:38:28.718 - 00:38:52.756, Speaker B: And my. If I'm trying to like think about the second order impacts of this, once you have something like USDC where the peg is broken, I would think that maybe there's like, for some of the heavily regulated institutions from a compliance perspective, they maybe can't hold it anymore. Um, I could be totally off there, but I'm curious to get your guys take like, what are the long term implications for something like USDC since this deep hiking event?
00:38:52.950 - 00:39:24.264, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. I mean, we traded a ton of USDC during that basically over the last week. And I think crypto, Twitter will identify one of our wallets and say, hey, TRW did X, Y or Z. They're never getting a full picture. So if they see us selling a bunch of it, they're probably just missing all the USDC that we're buying on the other side from other people in different wallets. It's super confusing to do that on chain kind of forensics because you don't know whose wallet is.
00:39:24.344 - 00:39:24.964, Speaker A: But.
00:39:26.704 - 00:40:43.388, Speaker C: At a macro level, what we saw in USDC when it depegged there was selling of USDC at a time when the Fed wire closed and the 24/7 banking solutions that tradfi has basically set up to service crypto banking needs over the weekend. Crypto banking needs are usually stablecoin. Related were Signet and CED, which belonged to signature and Silvergate, which are suddenly banks that went from being not that risky to scary to park your catch on either of those 24/7 banking networks going into that weekend when the Fed wire closed. If you cant wire cash and stables are your source of liquidity and youre concerned that USDC may have perhaps a problem on their hands due to Silicon Valley bank holding some of USDCs deposits. You're going to see a lot of selling. We traded billions of dollars worth of these tokens. Ultimately, the liquidity that companies like Cumberland DRW provide during those times end up shoring up, basically minimizing the volatility in those deep events.
00:40:43.388 - 00:41:13.024, Speaker C: And usually the peg is retained quicker the more liquidity there is. Imagine if there were no liquidity providers figuring out ways to wire cash, put up capital, take risk, buy discounted stable coins whose balance sheets are just fine during times of crisis. The price would jackknife a lot lower on all that panic selling. So ultimately we weren't dumping it, we were just providing two way liquidity, which we think contributed to a faster reversion to the meat, which is parodying.
00:41:13.544 - 00:41:55.012, Speaker A: Yeah, I think when USDC was kind of, it was kind of interesting to me. I mean, I put out a tweet that did some preliminary math on it before they had put out the statement that they had 3.3 billion with it, with SVB. And even after that $3.3 billion hole was disclosed, which is about 8%. What was odd to me was that even in the worst case estimated, you were probably looking at 75% recovery from SBB, maybe 70, 75%. And what was very odd was that USDC traded to $0.88
00:41:55.012 - 00:43:02.744, Speaker A: because thats way below fair market value from my perspective. And so I think a lot of it was just panic. And then even once, even once the backstop was announced, it took a bit to fully repay. I mean, it was trading at, that was, it wasn't an immediate, immediate reversal. And so I think in terms of will institutions touch USDC moving forward? I think they will, because I think this was a bit of an unprecedented, unprecedented thing. And also, USDC is so ingrained into crypto, and as a regulated institution, are you really going to switch to tether? Or if a new stable coin comes out, are you really going to bet that that new stable coin is going to do a better job of managing risk than USDC, which has probably put up like, probably the most stringent risk? They're probably tackling this stuff with full force right now. They probably hired a bunch of people to go monitor this 24/7 or they're probably going to be the flightiest people youve ever met, which is a good thing, by the way.
00:43:02.744 - 00:43:51.096, Speaker A: I think that from an institutional perspective, your choice is either use USDC, which is still the safest stable coin from my opinion today post SVB or dont touch stable coins in crypto, which by the way is a reasonable thing to say. Maybe you dont want to touch stable coins and crypto anymore. Maybe youre more worried about that than you are about ethics. One thing that was interesting is that liquidy traded really well because liquidity is a token and full disclosure, we don't own any. Liquidity is a token that allows you to mint a stablecoin purely backed by ETH. It's the biggest actually decentralized stablecoin that's not backed by USDC anyway. And the thing just ripped.
00:43:51.096 - 00:44:43.474, Speaker A: There could also just be a product market fit for these types of things where you know the risk and the risk is the price of ETH and that is easily controlled for more, at least more easily controlled for than not knowing who the banking partners of these stable coins are. So there's a little bit of that that might find a product market fit. But I don't view this as the end for USDC by any means. And I also think that it's times like that that offer really fantastic opportunity in the marketplace to have some balls and make a bet. USDC trading at $0.90. Obviously this is hindsight, but you could just look at my public Twitter feed and the math that I did, the fact that I was telling people that really shouldn't be trading below $0.90, that's opportunity right there.
00:44:43.514 - 00:44:55.746, Speaker B: No, I agree with you. Those are the times that hardened protocols. You think about March 2020, that flash crashed down maker made it through and you could argue that that really hardened maker that they made it through that.
00:44:55.930 - 00:45:15.466, Speaker C: DeFi has been looking amazing throughout all this, but it almost feels like Tradfi is failing crypto at the moment. If Silicon Valley bank just rugs circles, deposits circle does a fantastic job, by the way, that is a top notch team. Those guys are professionals. They manage risk better than anyone in the stablecoin industry.
00:45:15.530 - 00:45:16.414, Speaker A: They're incredible.
00:45:17.424 - 00:45:24.880, Speaker C: It's pretty interesting to see the tables turn a bit. I'm just happy that the FDIC stepped in.
00:45:24.992 - 00:45:48.274, Speaker B: Yeah, agreed, agreed. Shout out to the circle team. I know we only have a couple of minutes left here, guys. Any other trends that you guys think are interesting outside of the majors that you're paying attention to? Avi, I know you posted about some alts the other day. You mentioned stacks. You did some stuff with sushi a couple of months ago. What are you paying attention to that you find interesting, either from a trading perspective or just crypto interest well.
00:45:50.374 - 00:46:30.574, Speaker A: From a trading perspective, I'm honestly focused a lot on just the volatility of the majors. There's been a lot of opportunities and also in bitcoin and Ethereum options. I think one thing that I've mentioned on a few podcasts is that you tend to get pretty depressed volume, because the structural nature of the volume market right now is that theyre just a bunch of sellers. So, for example, when bitcoin was trading 20k volume in the fifties, that was a steal. That was an absolute steal. That dislocation just didnt make sense. I think the option market presents a reasonable amount of opportunity right now.
00:46:30.574 - 00:47:19.974, Speaker A: Im directionally very bullish on Defi in general because I think when you think about bitcoin as an alternative banking system, DeFi or the actual, thats actually where the banking system can be replicated. BTC is a great asset to hold, but all the functionality of a bank account and all the functionality of the financial system exists in DeFi. So I think the recent crises are just as good for DeFi long term as they are for bitcoin. First its going to be good for bitcoin, then its going to be good for. And so we're looking at, you know, I think there are a lot of protocols that are working that are working very hard, that are working very hard right now. There's some protocols not working hard at all. And so you just find the, find the ones that are working hard and you short the ones that are not working hard.
00:47:23.274 - 00:48:20.614, Speaker C: That's a good take. I mean, I guess I have kind of a boring answer to your question, Yano. I guess the craziest altcoin that I've been, you know, looking at recently is GBTC Grayscale Bitcoin trust. It's. The discount has ripped from -46% all the way up to 30%, back down to 40%. I mean, if you look at this in terms of annualized percentage returns of these moves gargantuan and given that the product market fit of bitcoin that's manifesting itself in this market paradigm, combined with all the legal and regulatory nuance behind that particular trust, you have to quote obviously some real volume trade. I also think the options market is probably one of the most interesting places to get involved in crypto trading right now.
00:48:20.614 - 00:49:00.214, Speaker C: It's interesting to me, as a former options trader to watch people continue to bash out calls with reckless abandon against their bitcoin length or ETH length, trying to earn a little bit of extra yield without seeming to realize that risk free yields have gone up, so they should theoretically be demanding more carry for their option selling than the. Let's look at it. There's less than a volume differential between implied and realized right now. They're basically selling it out at fair value. For all you option buyers out there, the audience, it's pretty interesting stuff. Lots of leverage in a good way in your favor.
00:49:01.394 - 00:49:30.610, Speaker B: Last question here. Just actually on the leverage side of things, I feel like a lot of the collateral, I think you could make a fair argument that a lot of the last cycle was just a bunch of collateral and leverage floating around in the system. This cycle, the off chain leverage, the blockfi's and Celsius and the genesis of the world aren't really here anymore. What do you think the just leverage space and collateral looks like in the next cycle? How is it different than the last cycle?
00:49:30.802 - 00:50:01.304, Speaker A: Well, I think for one you're going to see some serious competition from actual prime brokerages in the space from traditional capital markets. Like traditional capital market? Yeah, I think that there's a lot in the works right now. You talk to almost every bank. They have a crypto team now. And some of the banks are actually pretty far along in the process. I think they're just waiting. They're waiting for regulatory clarity, which is, by the way, probably the largest topic that we didn't hit on in this podcast.
00:50:01.304 - 00:50:05.208, Speaker A: So love to talk about on another podcast at some time because it's very.
00:50:05.376 - 00:50:09.084, Speaker B: I mean, maybe once you guys bring back 1000 x, then you can talk about events.
00:50:12.264 - 00:50:14.468, Speaker A: Soon, soon, soon.
00:50:14.596 - 00:50:15.424, Speaker C: Love it.
00:50:15.884 - 00:50:23.584, Speaker A: But yeah, I also think that you're probably just going to see less. You're going to see less leverage in the system.
00:50:24.684 - 00:50:50.594, Speaker C: Leverage doesn't combine well with this kind of volatility. It stops people out. But commodities are a very leveraged product because they're all futurized and traded on exchanges where collateral is centrally managed and cleared and guaranteed. Like you said, avi, I think we're getting towards that model. And once you can feel confident in the security of the repository of your assets, then you start to feel comfortable levering them up a little bit.
00:50:50.714 - 00:50:52.314, Speaker A: Yeah, that's good.
00:50:52.434 - 00:50:54.054, Speaker B: Fellas, any last thoughts?
00:50:55.434 - 00:51:01.850, Speaker A: No, it's always fun talking to both. I always have a conversation. So I appreciate you having us on the podcast.
00:51:02.002 - 00:51:03.906, Speaker C: Ditto. Let me guess, you.
00:51:03.930 - 00:51:05.234, Speaker B: Well, fellas, thanks.
00:51:05.394 - 00:51:14.314, Speaker A: See you guys. You our.
