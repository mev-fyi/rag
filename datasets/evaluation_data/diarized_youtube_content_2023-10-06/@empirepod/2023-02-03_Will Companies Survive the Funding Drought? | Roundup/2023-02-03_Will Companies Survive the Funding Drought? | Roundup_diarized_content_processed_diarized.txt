00:00:04.520 - 00:00:09.430, Speaker A: All right, so welcome back to another episode of Bell of. Whoo. Empire. Sorry, guys.
00:00:09.502 - 00:00:10.294, Speaker B: Wait, what?
00:00:10.454 - 00:00:11.154, Speaker A: Me?
00:00:13.094 - 00:00:13.750, Speaker B: Jesus Christ.
00:00:13.782 - 00:00:16.286, Speaker A: I'm just talking to Mike about Bell Curve. I'm sorry. It's.
00:00:16.430 - 00:00:24.998, Speaker B: This is what happens. Your love for you, do a couple podcasts. I'm just, you know, I'm in a single relationship here with Empire.
00:00:25.046 - 00:00:34.290, Speaker A: No, no, no. You don't know this. Mike kicked me out of bell. Mike, Mike, Mike. I did season one and season two with Mike of Bell Curve. He just booted me. So season three is all about app chains on Bell Curve.
00:00:34.290 - 00:00:39.314, Speaker A: People should check it out. It's good. But I got kicked out as the host. Mike put in a guy from.
00:00:39.474 - 00:00:51.938, Speaker B: We've had a trend in the last episode, and we're going to talk about this episode about founders and what they go through, because you and I have talked to a lot of founders and what they can resolve.
00:00:52.026 - 00:00:58.656, Speaker A: Check me out. Yeah, we got it. Exactly. So we. Welcome back. Welcome back to Empire. You got the roundup.
00:00:58.656 - 00:01:03.176, Speaker A: And, Santiago, I see you rocking Nike today. I'm curious what you think of this Nike Tiffany collection.
00:01:03.200 - 00:01:12.712, Speaker B: Absolute fire. Saw a picture of LeBron wearing this jacket, too. Just, man, I mean, that's kind of stuff that I would. That I love, you know? Cause historically, like, a lot of the.
00:01:12.728 - 00:01:17.688, Speaker A: NFT projects, would you spend one ETH? Or I guess it's point. What is ethat today?
00:01:17.816 - 00:01:25.804, Speaker B: No, would you spend just one ETH? Right. Well, what are the. These, you were saying? These. These secondary market for these shoes is going, what, four k?
00:01:27.344 - 00:01:30.200, Speaker A: Four k. The Nike SB dunk, low diamond supplies.
00:01:30.272 - 00:01:35.896, Speaker B: ETH is at 1600 because, you know, j pal hike 25 basis points. Market loves it. We're ripping ETH.
00:01:35.920 - 00:01:38.564, Speaker A: Is that spending two and a half ETH on. On these shoes?
00:01:38.944 - 00:02:05.776, Speaker B: I mean, I use dirty fiat, but I hate to say it, but I. And I'm gonna get a lot of shit for it. But I probably will drop on this just because. Hear me out. Just because I don't. Just because I think these are two brands that are moving aggressively and with a purpose and a mission in crypto, and I think I respect that. And so I'm also a huge.
00:02:05.776 - 00:02:22.064, Speaker B: I love Nike, and I run a lot, as people know, and I love Nike as a brand, and I'm very loyal. So if anyone out there, Nike who heads up their NFT web3 department wants to come on the show, talk. I mean, it'll be the easiest interview you'll ever do.
00:02:23.804 - 00:02:34.324, Speaker A: You know, it's funny. Did you see, you saw LeBron walking through the tunnel I feel like the. The NBA tunnel has become, like, it's the new. It's like Runway. That's where fashion is made.
00:02:34.364 - 00:02:34.636, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:02:34.700 - 00:02:45.460, Speaker A: Yeah, that's the. It's the new Runway. Like, that's where the NBA tunnel is, where fashion is made today. And so they kill. I think they killed it. You know, you had a. Who's the CEO of Tiffany? Like, Arnod, the son, the sun or whatever.
00:02:45.460 - 00:02:51.834, Speaker A: I forget his name. The young. The young guy. Like, he was sitting at MSG rocking the shoes. You had LeBron walk out with the leather jacket and the shoes.
00:02:51.874 - 00:03:14.154, Speaker B: Like, you know, I think, like, historically, I got asked this question in an interview once. It's like, if you could just own one stock for the next 50 years, which one would it be and why? Or the next 20 years, like, really long term. And I pick the LVMH. Cause I think they're, like, humans always want to differentiate. And this part of my thesis of nfts too, right, which is like, digital identity and ownership. Like, humans love to differentiate. And so I really love.
00:03:14.154 - 00:03:32.142, Speaker B: I mean, they've done a fantastic job. The stock, how LVMH has expanded into so many different brands. Hospitality, they own, like, luxury hotels now, Cheval blancs. Like, they. They are just impressive in their acquisition strategy. And now, obviously, with. And try to be relevant across all their brands.
00:03:32.142 - 00:04:01.624, Speaker B: Like, they're all over, like, f one with tech sponsoring Red bull into nfTs. Like, and, like, it's actually impressive to see because they're like, you, you know, talk about the interage dilemma they have. They're sitting in a very comfortable position, but they also, they also put themselves in an uncomfortable position, meaning they know that they need to reinvent themselves in the next 20 years. They need to appeal to a younger generation. And it's super impressive to see how these guys really are, like, moving into web3.
00:04:02.564 - 00:04:08.340, Speaker A: I think it's awesome. So lvmh, they are one of the. I think Bernard Arnaud is the rich guy in the world or top.
00:04:08.452 - 00:04:10.820, Speaker B: I think he is now the Elon.
00:04:10.932 - 00:04:26.446, Speaker A: Richest person in the world. But lVMH owns Tiffany, Kristen, Dior, Fendi, Marc Jacobs, Laura, Piana, Celine, tag. I think they own. They own a bunch of alcohol as well.
00:04:26.470 - 00:04:32.286, Speaker B: Yeah, Moet Shant. I think they. I'm not sure Moet. But nonetheless, like, they own across the.
00:04:32.310 - 00:04:33.862, Speaker A: Luxury category, they own dom.
00:04:33.958 - 00:04:34.874, Speaker B: Yeah, they don.
00:04:36.894 - 00:04:56.490, Speaker A: Hennessey. So, like, anyways, huge. Like, they've got basically, like, these massive brands in, like, spirits, fashion, cosmetics, watches, jewelry. And so Bernard Arnaud put in place. His son, I think his name is Alexander. It's, like, 30 years old. Pretty young to run Tiffany and Alexander's super into nfts.
00:04:56.522 - 00:04:58.858, Speaker B: Yeah, he's rocking like that.
00:04:59.026 - 00:04:59.346, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:04:59.370 - 00:05:04.418, Speaker B: So, yeah, there's a fascinating story. We'll link it in the show notes of, like, how they bought.
00:05:04.466 - 00:05:08.848, Speaker A: Can you get them on, like, you know, punk, pink, punk, punk ping. Yeah, punk. And get them on?
00:05:08.896 - 00:05:30.564, Speaker B: Yeah, I'll try. I don't have direct contact. I've never talked to him. But, yeah, definitely, like, there's a great story of how they, like, have done a huge turnaround and, like, reinvented Dior as a house. Like, I don't particularly love the brand, but, like, I respect, like, they've just done an incredible turnaround. And they're really good at acquisitions, turnarounds, just growth, and, like, it's just super impressive.
00:05:31.464 - 00:05:31.912, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:05:31.968 - 00:05:36.210, Speaker B: So, yeah, nonetheless, this, this nike stuff.
00:05:36.242 - 00:05:37.034, Speaker A: Is pretty interesting, though.
00:05:37.074 - 00:06:10.040, Speaker B: Like, how. How does one buy. You were telling me this, but, like, like, what's a. What do you think is our long term vision if you're Nike, if you're Tiffany, these collabs, but also just thinking broadly of, like, nfTs, are they gonna use that to, like, give, like, their loyal members access? Because, like, today, for instance, Nike, like, launched some new sneakers, running sneakers. And because I'm a member and been a member for a long time, I was like, I got early access. Are they going to use NFts as, like, gateways to, like, here's what I'd say.
00:06:10.072 - 00:06:41.130, Speaker A: Like, nfts are no nFts. There is one thing on the mind of every brand in the world right now. How do I plug in to the cultural zeitgeist and specifically, like, maybe making that more tangible? How do I get my brand to survive? As this new cohort of people age, you know, twelve to 22, they come into all the wealth. Younger and younger people are making more and more money as they move their. As their lives become digital. They spend all their money in a digital world. And, you know, the first person I saw do this really, really well was John Malone.
00:06:41.130 - 00:07:24.462, Speaker A: Right? So, John Malone Liberty, one of the largest landowners in America. I think it's like, I think he might be the largest landowner in America behind Bill Gates. We might have talked about this already, but landowner in America, and he's very famous for doing all these media roll ups in the eighties, he basically identified Formula One as this kind of crusty older brand that had the same sponsors, same demographics, but their demographics were getting really old, and their demographics were eventually going to die out. So he acquired them. And what did he do? He linked up with Netflix and basically did a content marketing play. So some people think of content marketing as like, oh, we're going to create a blog or we're going to launch a brand podcast. What Formula one did, led by John Malone, is he said, no, we're going to actually create a show.
00:07:24.462 - 00:08:08.770, Speaker A: And that's how drive to survive on Netflix came to be. And I think what you see Tiffany doing right now is you don't think of, I think Tiffany, which is like 150 year old brand, as doing these big mass market, as even doing partnerships in general. But what's super obvious is that their partnership with Nike is their attempt to basically move into, become this mass market brand, but really become a brand that engages with, like, a broad group of young consumers. And, like, I think every brand today is like, how do I breathe life into my brand so that young consumers see me as a, as a, as a brand that kind of gets it. So that, that's, I think, what's on the top, top of mind for a lot of brands.
00:08:08.842 - 00:08:31.784, Speaker B: Let me ask you a question. So if you buy these sneakers is super slick, like black with like, the Tiffany color, which is like, like a mint color. Would you, if you buy the sneakers, what would you ascribe more value to the sneaker or the NFT? If you have, like a, an NFT that represents the physical item.
00:08:35.524 - 00:08:38.764, Speaker A: For the. So it's funny. So, like, I would never, because you're not.
00:08:38.804 - 00:08:39.964, Speaker B: The question is, are you gonna wear them?
00:08:40.004 - 00:08:43.236, Speaker A: I have, I have one. I have one pair of, like, collector sneakers.
00:08:43.300 - 00:08:43.740, Speaker B: Okay.
00:08:43.812 - 00:08:45.028, Speaker A: And you know what I've done with them?
00:08:45.116 - 00:08:45.388, Speaker B: No.
00:08:45.436 - 00:08:49.668, Speaker A: I have kept them in the box in my closet and I have never worn those.
00:08:49.716 - 00:08:50.076, Speaker B: So funny.
00:08:50.100 - 00:08:53.788, Speaker A: You see the value of them keeps going up. And so I'm like, I'm not going to scuff.
00:08:53.836 - 00:08:59.476, Speaker B: The question is, are you going to sell them at some point? This is the conundrum that I don't know.
00:08:59.580 - 00:09:06.956, Speaker A: No, I won't, because, like, they're there. I've got, they're a piece of history in my mind. And, like, they're these.
00:09:07.060 - 00:09:24.096, Speaker B: But I do get anxiety because it will depreciate. It will deteriorate. Right. Are you, are you keeping them in good conditions? Like, you move places? Like, accumulating physical stuff gives me some anxiety. I love collecting certain stuff, but I do think about that a lot. Whereas digital is great. Like, I love Legos, for instance.
00:09:24.096 - 00:09:35.704, Speaker B: I have my, in my parents house that I spent the full, like month, you know, true to crypto bear market, mini bear market that we had. I was actually living my parents attic, which is my room, and I have.
00:09:35.744 - 00:09:37.056, Speaker A: It'S all Legos, luxurious and.
00:09:37.080 - 00:09:52.880, Speaker B: But I don't build them because I. I think that they're like, I just. There are certain pieces that I just don't want to build. But I also, historically have never sold anything that I've collected. I've only sold one NFT, actually, which was an ift island, like, where. Thing that the team gifted me. And I said, I'm not gonna sell.
00:09:52.880 - 00:09:55.824, Speaker B: But there was someone who wanted it. So, like, I end up selling it.
00:09:55.864 - 00:09:56.484, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:09:57.944 - 00:10:04.764, Speaker B: So in this case, you're right. Like, I don't think, like, this particular sneaker, I'm not gonna, like, wear it.
00:10:05.464 - 00:10:20.246, Speaker A: Here's what I would do. I would do what I did with all nfts when I nft market was booming, I'd buy two. But I always. What I did with most nfts is like, you buy two nfts, you, when the price goes up a lot and you're like, I want to sell. I want to sell. Go ahead, sell it. But then you can still hold on to one.
00:10:20.350 - 00:10:31.514, Speaker B: That's a good idea. So, like, crypto butts, which I know that you're a big fan of. We had a great episode with melted. You talked about that a lot. I do have one. Or a few, actually. How many do you have?
00:10:32.134 - 00:10:33.758, Speaker A: I actually own this.
00:10:33.926 - 00:10:36.594, Speaker B: I'm just calling you out because I know that you have more than two, right?
00:10:37.634 - 00:10:48.042, Speaker A: No, I actually only have. Yeah, but I was, I was just shopping the other day, so I've got. I've got my eyes on one that's like, okay, beauty. And I'm gonna probably pull trigger on the second.
00:10:48.098 - 00:10:53.210, Speaker B: This is like, this is a good, like a framework. Buy two and then you get rid of one.
00:10:53.242 - 00:10:59.234, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. So nice. What should we talk about today? There's not much news.
00:10:59.314 - 00:10:59.802, Speaker B: Surprising.
00:10:59.858 - 00:11:06.638, Speaker A: Putting together the news stuff with our producer. Shout out Garrett. And Garrett, like, the least crypto news I've ever seen.
00:11:06.686 - 00:11:31.564, Speaker B: It's interesting because the market, it's one of those times where, like, there have been weeks where we have so many news and the market does nothing. It's choppy. It's a crap market now. Market tripping, because Jay Powell did us all a favor. Is it really priced in? But then it's not, you know, and so, yeah, it's interesting. I mean, there have been some news on the side, nft wise. Some, like, soft rugs by rally I guess, and few things here and there.
00:11:31.564 - 00:11:51.264, Speaker B: The, we can talk about the, I mean, the Celsius, like 400 page dot, like, whatever, like, report had so much stuff in there that it's like, you read, there's a great thread in there. Like, you, all you have to do is like, read like five pages. You're like, this is, this is sickening. And so, yeah, there's some Celsius out there.
00:11:51.304 - 00:11:59.200, Speaker A: Here's my one liners that Celsius is royally screwing over their users by what's going on. But I, I feel like I can't say more right now.
00:11:59.312 - 00:12:08.284, Speaker B: Well, it has historically, you know. Right. They were using customer funds to see as well he was selling his own personal stake, like up to 40 million or so.
00:12:09.544 - 00:12:36.766, Speaker A: Here's what I'd say, santi, is there's no leaders. There's no. I think that if Celsius leadership was still in place, they would actually do the right thing and they'd be like, let's sell this business and, you know, let's take care of the users. There's no Celsius leadership left over. It's basically just the bankers and the lawyers running this thing. And I don't know what's going to happen with Celsius, but I can assure you, when lawyers and bankers are in charge, the users will not be taken care of. This will extend out as long as humanly possible.
00:12:36.766 - 00:12:37.750, Speaker A: Because they're raking in.
00:12:37.782 - 00:12:42.582, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, lawyers in the Enron case made over a billion dollars, or the restructuring.
00:12:42.638 - 00:12:43.222, Speaker A: Same with Madoff.
00:12:43.238 - 00:12:43.838, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
00:12:43.886 - 00:13:02.794, Speaker A: Yeah, same with Madoff. I have something I want to talk about, actually. So last week on the roundup, we talked a lot. I had those three calls with founders and I want. And I talked about that. I actually had similar calls with different venture firms in crypto this week. And they were kind of.
00:13:02.794 - 00:13:36.058, Speaker A: It made me realize that, like, I think that we've probably hit a bottom in crypto markets, like the public market side of crypto. I think we've probably seen a bottom in bitcoin and ETH. I have a feeling we'll get back down to those lows at some point again this, this year. But we've probably seen a bottom, but that doesn't mean there's not a lot more pain to come. And what I mean by that is some of these calls with the venture firms, they're talking about their portfolio companies and they're like, look, we have some port cos who we love. We are all in on these poor cos where they're going to raise again. We're going to back them.
00:13:36.058 - 00:14:25.702, Speaker A: They're going to raise probably a lower valuation or a flat round, but that's okay, we'll double down on them. But a lot of these funds have companies who are not doing super well and they're not going to be able to. And the funds I talk to are not going to back them again. And what happens then? The dynamic that occurs there is when you have a company who's all the VC's who have invested in them already are not willing to back them again, there's no way they can raise another round from outside investors because that's a huge red flag. Or if they can raise, it's going to be at like a 90% down round, which just kills the esoPs, which then kills the employee morale. And it just, if you have a high liquidation preference, it means the founder might never make any money again. So it's a pretty high likelihood that you're going to see a lot of companies, I think, in the like five to 20 person range.
00:14:25.702 - 00:14:34.108, Speaker A: A lot of those companies are just going to quietly shut down later this year. And it won't be like public pain, but there's more pain.
00:14:34.246 - 00:14:52.488, Speaker B: Yeah. It's interesting you say that. I want to comment a few things. One, I think public, public markets are faster to respond. Private markets, you know, valuations took a bit of time to, to go down, whereas the public market was much faster. Right. A lot of these deals got announced later.
00:14:52.488 - 00:15:38.296, Speaker B: Like I'm announcing. I announced two deals this week that I participated in. These were like, you know, we closed like a month or two ago, so there's a bit of a delay. I also think you're right in the sense that the problem with crypto, like in bull market, I always caution founders, which is even if you can raise a huge round, a huge markup, like, few, like, some of these deals were like a month later, another fund would have come in and offered them way more money at a huge markup. And it's great. Sometimes you take the money and it's an insurance policy. But what you just said about, like, the morale of a company, when you do a down round, it is very, very difficult for a lot of employees and retention, and it sucks to do a down round.
00:15:38.296 - 00:16:27.264, Speaker B: And so the hope is that sometimes these, these rounds were not large in capital, but huge in valuation. And so it's a really tricky position for a lot of these companies that have hired too aggressively, had, had to cut down, and are probably going to have to do a down round, the second. The third and last thing I want to comment on is, I'll be really interested to talk about this just in general, which is the rationale psychology that goes on in an investment committee in crypto, which is crypto historically has been a market that has really fast evolving narratives, and people love to chase new narratives. It's all about what's the next new narrative. If you're sitting in committee, you have a portfolio of companies. You have, say, a $50 million fund. We've already deployed half of it in, you know, a couple companies.
00:16:27.264 - 00:17:02.474, Speaker B: Would you rather back and do another round of those companies? Might have been, like, an error. That's not really in favor now. Or were you gonna back the new companies with a new hot narrative, zero knowledge proofs, yada, yada, yada, yada, slap, whatever your next nice term is. And I'm not sure. I think a lot of funds are not very sophisticated, are just going to chase some narratives, and they're gonna. Because they might think that that's, like, going to be what. What, like, gets them out of being underwater.
00:17:02.474 - 00:17:14.814, Speaker B: I'd be curious if you agree with that. Like, I think some funds are more disciplined, but, like, the cohort of funds in crypto is very diverse, and some are more professional than others.
00:17:14.974 - 00:17:36.328, Speaker A: The reason I. The only pushback there would be that, like, there are a lot of funds who are running out of money right now in terms of, like, they raised. You know, let's say. Let's say you raised in, like, summer of 2021. You're almost two. You're almost, like, two years since you've raised, or, like, you're at least a year and a half since you raised. And so now you're starting to think about raising your next fund.
00:17:36.328 - 00:17:50.220, Speaker A: But you need to stay as a. As a venture. And, I mean, you. You know this from your time at paraphy and even just as an angel investor. Like, one of your jobs is being in the narrative and being in the. You have to build a brand as a venture investor. You have to get in the deals.
00:17:50.220 - 00:18:19.120, Speaker A: You have to, like, people have to know you. You have to go on the podcast. You have to do your tweet threads and your medium articles and things like that. And if you run out of money too early in a cycle, you, people will forget about you. A, people will forget about you, but b, you'll miss a lot of the great opportunities that'll happen later this year. So I think, actually, I am seeing a lot of venture firms be really conservative right now because maybe they raised 150 million. They only have like 20 million left to deploy.
00:18:19.120 - 00:18:28.288, Speaker A: And so they're being super conservative. Cause they, before they can raise that next fund, they, you know, they don't. You never want to be fully out of money, essentially as a venture.
00:18:28.336 - 00:18:50.660, Speaker B: Yeah, it's trying to say that. So you remember katie hahn, former a 16 c partner. She like, was a prosecutor of the silk road and then wasn't the Coinbase board. She raised left a 16 z and raised 1.5 billion, at least committed. I don't know how much. He's called venture fund, strictly venture.
00:18:50.660 - 00:19:18.924, Speaker B: I'm not sure how much they hold in public tokens. They just announced a deal, actually this week, which is why I bring this up, because I saw her on CNBC basically saying, look, we're in no rush to deploy this capital. We think that we're going to see lower valuations. And this was like two months ago, three months ago. So we're kind of bottoming out. And now they, they're now redeploying. They did like a, I think it was a $7 million series A or so.
00:19:18.924 - 00:20:11.532, Speaker B: And so it's interesting that these funds are now, you know, I think, chiha, a fund like that has plenty of capital to deploy. You know, it's really, you know, because there's a few funds that raised, like last year that have decent amount of capital. The question that I've been consistently seeing from people that wonder is how much of that capital is actually being called, meaning you can announce in ventures fairly common, and I'm an investor in a few venture funds, crypto, non crypto. So basically what it says is you commit, say, $10, and they'll say, we're going to call up to half of that, no more than half, usually. And so you basically shell out $5 and then the other five, in this case, they're going to call over some time horizon, usually two years, while they'll deploy, or maybe up to five. It's. And a lot of people say, hey, how much of.
00:20:11.532 - 00:21:16.516, Speaker B: There's actually this, this idea of there's so much dry powder in crypto, a lot of, and just generally in markets in private equity in venture in crypto. And some people are wondering how much of that is actually going to be there to deploy. My understanding is if you look at these subscription agreements, they are very, like, it's pretty hard to back out. If you made this commitment and they call capital, it's pretty tough to back out. And so I, what I'm trying to say is, I would think that I would probably haircut conservative, like up to 25% of that, like, aggregate number. So if Katie Hahn, you know, Han Ventures, had one and a half billion committed to them, and they called, call it 400 million in their first, like close or whatever, the rest of that, I think reasonably speaking, she's going to have like probably like over a billion to deploy. And maybe there's like one or two LP's that drop.
00:21:16.516 - 00:22:10.304, Speaker B: But the large, the really large LP's, I think will not drop because it's one of the more important questions that you get asked when you, when you invest in these funds is when you do, like this description questionnaire is what percentage of the assets of whatever vehicle is investing through or your personal assets. I think it's, if you're investing through a corporation, which most people do anyways, what percentage of the assets are committed to, to this opportunity. And I think there is, it needs to be below a certain threshold. Like, if it's just like 100% or 80%, like, you get asked more questions. But a lot of these large lP's, you know, it's a very small percentage of their allocation. When we think about like large institutions allocating 1% of their capital, pension funds, calpers of the world, you know, it's a relatively small number for them.
00:22:12.084 - 00:22:15.732, Speaker C: Everyone, quick break from Empire to tell you about another blockworks channel that I.
00:22:15.788 - 00:22:18.420, Speaker A: Know you're going to love. I've been in crypto full time for.
00:22:18.452 - 00:22:31.174, Speaker C: Five years and have always struggled with one thing, which is keeping up with the next big trend. As soon as I wrap my head around MeV, we're on to appchains. As soon as I wrap my head around app chains, we're onto liquid staking derivatives.
00:22:31.214 - 00:22:32.590, Speaker A: I'm sure you've been there.
00:22:32.742 - 00:22:57.466, Speaker C: Blockworks research has solved that problem for me. Our team puts research, data governance proposal, updates, models and more into one really easy to use platform. So I can always stay ahead of the curve if I don't understand something. For example, I just bought the platform. I can search for an l one. I can search for a protocol, pull up the platform@blockworksresearch.com. Dot I search the term.
00:22:57.466 - 00:23:23.634, Speaker C: There's always an amazing amount of insight in a really consumable way. Right now you can subscribe to the platform. It's $2,500 a year or $900 a quarter. Hopefully you can make more than $208 a month by using the platform. If you can't, you're probably, probably in the wrong business. But if you're not ready to subscribe to the platform today, you can subscribe to the research team's free newsletter. You can follow their twitter handles today links in the show notes.
00:23:23.634 - 00:23:40.634, Speaker C: Trust me, once you do that, you're going to want to subscribe to the platform. If you are ready to subscribe right now, I got you guys with a little hookup. Empire listeners get a 10% discount for the first 50 people who use the code. Empire ten got your back. Check out the links in the description to find out more.
00:23:41.014 - 00:24:13.878, Speaker A: Now let's get back to the show. Yeah, I think that brings up a good point. So even though you're contractually obligated to send this money, like, if you're a pension and you committed 10 million, you're contractually obligated to send the 10 million to the fund. When they call it, there's a, there's a. I think there's a dynamic, too. So actually it was Vance from framework who mentioned this to me, which is, I think is a good point, which is if you're running a fund, you have two roles. You are an investor, which is finding good deals and investing in the right things.
00:24:13.878 - 00:24:42.746, Speaker A: But you're also. And that's what people think of as like, a vc, but then you're also a fund manager, which is like running the fund and like, managing relationships with the LP's. And like, when shit is hitting the fan, like calming your LP's down. And so there's this element of like, yes, the pension told you they'd give you 10 million. You called five of it on day one. Now you're going back to them at the absolute bottoms saying, hey, super opportunity. We're being super opportunistic, really exciting time to buy.
00:24:42.746 - 00:25:09.926, Speaker A: And if you are not a good fund manager and you have not managed those relationships in the right way, even though they're obligated to send you that money. If I'm a pension and I don't trust you, I'm like, okay, I know, I, I know I'm obligated to send you this money, but, like, I don't love that you're buying into crypto at these, at these prices. And so I think there's like some. I would assume there are some fund managers who, like, are better at that element of the game than others.
00:25:10.030 - 00:25:14.634, Speaker B: I mean, this is a. I really enjoyed my time and I think this was a good dynamic that we had.
00:25:15.374 - 00:25:17.918, Speaker A: Who seeded paraphy? Was it. Was it KKR? Do I remember?
00:25:17.966 - 00:25:50.854, Speaker B: It was Henry Kravis personally. So Henry Kravis is one of the three founders of KKK 10 million do I remember? I don't have full details. I don't think there's a Bloomberg, this is all public record Bloomberg article reference. Henry Kravitz was an anchor investor because, you know, Henry carries a lot of weight. Ben used to be at KKR, and so, and Bain Capital Ventures was a big part of that, too. So that made a huge splash. Obviously, someone like Henry, who basically invented an asset class, which is private equity, did one of the first buyouts.
00:25:50.854 - 00:26:27.488, Speaker B: KKR is one of the best, if not the best private equity firm out there. Someone like that who kind of was big part of the invention of an asset class called private equity. Discover and believe in crypto as an, as an asset class, maybe didn't fully appreciate the technology, but, you know, as an asset class, like, that was a huge validation. I think that article, Bloomberg article kept, like, it's still probably, like, really popular, getting a lot of hits. But, yeah, you're right. I mean, Ben was great at that, and I had the liberty and luxury of just focusing more on the investing side. But it's a big part.
00:26:27.488 - 00:26:53.912, Speaker B: Like, it's not to say that I don't enjoy it. I'd much rather have more time just to think about, like, investing. But it is a big part of, and it's very time consuming, especially because crypto is such a volatile asset class. You know, people, when you're doing great, it's like, it's like, go watch the big short. I think they really summarize what running a fund is like. Right? Because Michael Burry, by the way, it's interesting because Michael Burry now deleted his account because he was telling people to short the market yesterday. Yeah.
00:26:53.912 - 00:27:18.016, Speaker B: Like, one, two, sell. He deletes his account every time he gets a bad call. Like, this guy's like, he's volatile. Like, look, we're all kind of eccentric in some way, but, you know, he very much visibly, like, shows that, shows his hand. But the big short really kind of gives you an inside scoop into what running a fund is. Right. You know, a lot of his investors, like, were, like, trying to sue him.
00:27:18.016 - 00:27:40.782, Speaker B: And one of the lead investors was calling him all the time, Lawrence, I think his name is name. Like, this guy Lawrence, his anchor investor, was like, you're, you're breaching all these clauses. Like, you're, you're, like, basically in a run of money. You're crazy for betting against housing. Like, yada, yada, yada. And then, of course, like, did a huge one fall. So, yeah, all this, like, no different than running it's really not like I.
00:27:40.798 - 00:27:43.286, Speaker A: Think, I don't know what the, I've.
00:27:43.310 - 00:28:21.824, Speaker B: Had a lot of discussion, by the way, someone hit me up yesterday from another big font and said, oh, I heard there's a rumor that you're gonna start a fund. I'm like, like, no, I'll publicly say this, no, and all of this. And then I got to thinking, like, you know, it has been, it's difficult to run a crypto fund. Like a lot of the, a lot of people. One, the community always liked to like, vilify venture at different parts of the cycle. And look, some venture funds are better than others. Some fund managers are really vocal and can polarize the community and others are not.
00:28:21.824 - 00:28:50.654, Speaker B: But like, sometimes there's a broad stroke of like, oh, this is a VC project and VC's are bad. And they get, you know what they don't see is that VC's also like grind out and really help founders, especially in tough times. Like, you're basically like talking to founders all the time. Cause they really need your help. And some funds or fund managers are, they don't wanna talk to the analysts, they wanna talk to you. Right. I was spending more than half of my time just talking to the portfolio all the time on call.
00:28:50.654 - 00:29:20.886, Speaker B: Like, crypto is 24 7365. Like, you get hit up on Sunday, you know? So I heard this from Kyle Someani, actually. I know Kyle gets a lot of shit out there from a lot of people, but one thing I think that he said is very true. He said, basically, when we make an investment, my criteria is, can I drop everything if I'm on vacation and pick up the phone for this founder? Do I really want to work with him? To be fair, I think Multicoin as a fund has really helped some of their portfolio. Like a lot of their portfolio companies. Like, if you hear from founders, Multi.
00:29:20.910 - 00:29:25.038, Speaker A: Coin has helped more than, more than pretty much any other fund out there. Multi coin is help.
00:29:25.126 - 00:29:29.430, Speaker B: I'll go on the record of saying, like, salon, like, you may, they are very helpful.
00:29:29.542 - 00:29:30.862, Speaker A: Helium. Yeah, yeah.
00:29:30.918 - 00:29:49.080, Speaker B: You may not love the project, you may not love other things. Not asking you to, but I will, I do, I will give them credit because they are very helpful. So anyways, all this to say is running a crypto fund is really hard, folks. And so next time you criticize a lot of these funds, just wonder, like, they do play a huge role, like they're investing in.
00:29:49.152 - 00:30:13.070, Speaker A: I thought, I thought, I thought Chris Berniski had a good take, which is like everyone, the reason people criticize crypto venture funds is because, like, they get insider deals and like, they're, you know, they're able to buy at these low prices. As Chris put it on Twitter the other day, which is really well put for anyone criticizing. You've got the same opportunity right now. Public markets, these tokens are down at the same prices that venture funds are getting them at. And so go for it. Pull the trigger. But most people want.
00:30:13.102 - 00:30:42.516, Speaker B: Well, it brings me back to the initial statement you said, which is a lot of these projects have launched a token. They're trading below market. But also venture funds have a huge lockup. Like some of these rounds are being done where the community is. There's a huge allocation of the community, and they're getting it at roughly the same price as venture funds, sometimes with way better terms in terms of lockup. And so, you know, that's some of the things that don't get discussed. But, like, venture funds have to hold the bag for years.
00:30:42.516 - 00:31:12.044, Speaker B: For years. And, yeah, and so, yeah, it's a lot of, a lot of the new things that have been happening is when venture funds like Dragonfly and some of these funds, like, had to go and ask the community they can invest in, like Lyo, for instance, convince the community to sell tokens from the treasury. And so, yeah, I don't know. It's a bit of, a bit of a tangent here, but I think it's an important topic to discuss, especially as in bear markets, venture funds do play a huge role.
00:31:13.104 - 00:32:08.696, Speaker A: I think there's one other thing that people don't see if you haven't raised or if you haven't invested in some of these private rounds, which is, I think the thing that hits the media, that hits the, like the headline is the valuation X company raises this much at this valuation. What most of these deals is really about, though, are the terms on the term sheet. What are the liquidation preferences? What do you have veto rights over? Those are things that are not in any story, but oftentimes are much more important. I saw something the other day. It had a three x liquidation preference. There's no way that, there's no way the founder of that company and the employees are going to make any money, and that's just a shame. But on Techcrunch, it looks like it's a super successful race and stuff like that.
00:32:08.840 - 00:32:14.856, Speaker B: This is very true. Not in crypto that much, actually, historically, these rounds have been very fairly founder friendly terms.
00:32:14.960 - 00:32:23.934, Speaker A: But I do wonder if now that you have more professional investors in crypto and the market's going down, I think the liquidation preferences that I'm seeing right now are like.
00:32:24.054 - 00:32:54.122, Speaker B: Yeah, I think. I think a lot of, a lot of the traditional funds ventured into crypto, did like the blockfi, Celsius, FTX. They basically were very soft on the terms. In a raging bull market. Yeah, like, no boards you like, I understand, like one x liquidation preferences standard. Like three x is like, you're basically in the worst bear market in history of the world. But like, no abort seed is like, shameful.
00:32:54.122 - 00:33:58.260, Speaker B: One of the things that I do want to observe is of the FTX stuff, and I know that we don't want to touch too much on that, but I think it will be really interesting to see the repercussions for venture funds that invested with, some of which are being investigated, of, like, did they actually uphold their fiduciary responsibility to do proper due diligence on the, on this company and companies in general? Some of these deals were like, struck lightning round deals, crazy valuations, no terms. Now, when we talk about the lessons and the positives that come out of something like that, as painful as it is, is that I think a lot of VC's in crypto now are going back and being way more disciplined, asking for a board seat. Let's talk about liquidation preference. Talk about information rights. Just standard, NBCA, Natural Venture Capital association. Like, terms that, like, apparently were not even in some of the more splashiest rounds. And this is true for traditional venture, too.
00:33:58.260 - 00:34:21.394, Speaker B: Like, I remember looking at Ubers, like pre IPO rounds. They had a huge ratchet liquidation preference. Like, basically, like, it was very favorable for those investors. And so you're absolutely right. I think people should assume that, you know, not everything is people just take the headline valuation, but there's a lot of stuff that goes, that, you know, goes into that number.
00:34:22.414 - 00:34:35.362, Speaker A: Yeah. Anything else you want to cover? Pretty slow news week. So I could be okay wrapping it here. We could also talk about rally or these bitcoin nfts, but I'll also be okay wrapping here. So.
00:34:35.458 - 00:35:27.436, Speaker B: No, I mean, I don't want to talk too much about macro. The only thing I want to say is like, and I'll, I will keep saying this as long for the rest of the year because it's an important thing to maybe just like I'm, I say this publicly because I want to remind myself, I'm not sure we're now in a full back up only mode. Prices have rallied quite a bit since the bottom. It's just still really, really important to correct the fundamental issues that persisted and, like, specific to crypto, strip away all the macro noise. There are some fundamental things in crypto that need to be improved on, and let's not lose sight of those. Let's actually focus and make sure that we don't make the same mistakes as before. And this is, we just talked about FTX board seats, you know, being more rigorous and diligence publicly, you know, calling out a lot of, you know, a lot of the stuff.
00:35:27.436 - 00:36:08.574, Speaker B: Not like, glorifying people just because, you know, just important to, like, remind ourselves of the things that we were talking about two months ago, even a month ago. And that should always kind of, like, we should always learn about those mistakes. You know, Mike had your, your founder had a really good tweet yesterday, the day before, said, like, you know, there's some really bad ideas in the last cycle. And I asked him, okay, what were the worst ideas that you saw? Because he said, a lot of venture funds back to this discussion are going to, like, you know, look back and, you know, a lot of these ideas were fairly dumb. And I'm actually really curious. And I'll leave it, I'll leave it here. I don't have a perfect answer for this.
00:36:08.574 - 00:36:51.950, Speaker B: And I love to hear people comment on, on YouTube and some of the other channels on Discord is like, what were actually those really dumb ideas that you consider? Because I think there are two camps, two, two categories of dumb ideas. One, which is too early because the infrastructure is not there, and a perfect example of that is cryptokitties. At the time, cryptokitties congested the Ethereum network. And people are saying, like, what is this stuff? People are saying it now about bitcoin for other reasons, but, like, NFTs as a category in 2017 was deemed discarded and said, this is really dumb. And then they re emerged two years later, and now here we are, right? It's very much here to stay. And it's a very important piece of crypto as vertical. That was a dumb idea that was just not ready for its time.
00:36:51.950 - 00:37:00.190, Speaker B: The infrastructure is not there. There's other dumb ideas like recursive leverage and, you know, algorithmic stable coins, which actually, I'm not fully sold on.
00:37:00.302 - 00:37:15.170, Speaker A: I mean, one of those ideas that I had, like, I think, I think there's a good lesson here, which is whenever you have, like, a, like, a really bad emotional reaction to something, like, I had this with NFTs when the NFT market was ripping. Like, do you remember when, um, people.
00:37:15.242 - 00:37:18.258, Speaker B: Sold his, like, 75 tens of million, 6 million?
00:37:18.306 - 00:37:28.506, Speaker A: Yeah. And then you know, like, bored ape started ripping. Punk started ripping. Like, all the. I had a very, like, emotionally negative reaction to that. I was like, this makes no sense. This is so dumb.
00:37:28.506 - 00:37:39.546, Speaker A: This is ridiculous. This is a huge bubble. And, and I was wrong. And it took, like, months to come to come to that realization and honestly, like, come to the acceptance.
00:37:39.650 - 00:37:51.234, Speaker B: This is like, I remember this episode. It was like January or February last year. And you were saying, like, mike and I have this, like, constant heated debate of, like, how high the NFT volume market and prices floors are going to go.
00:37:52.174 - 00:37:52.510, Speaker A: Board.
00:37:52.542 - 00:37:55.914, Speaker B: Apes were like, at 20 e, and then they ripped to like a hundred plus.
00:37:56.734 - 00:38:09.254, Speaker A: Like, I was, I was so, like, that was one of the most wrong I've been in crypto probably is like, I had no idea these pfps were going to be worth a million dollars each. And, you know. Yeah, miss, missed that one.
00:38:09.294 - 00:38:13.736, Speaker B: But, but you were saying, like, so I had a very visceral reaction to that. But what do you do with that?
00:38:13.800 - 00:38:48.838, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. And, like, when you have a visceral reaction to something, I think you should lean in. And, like, I actually think, like, I would maybe apply that to something like the Solana ecosystem today. Like, I think people are having super negative, super emotional reactions to the Solana ecosystem because of, like, you know, they were engaged with FTX or, you know, I think multicoin is also getting a lot of crap and multicore, big investor in Solana. Like, when you have a really, really, really negative emotional reaction to something in crypto, it's usually a good sign that you should lean in a little deeper. Yeah, and investigate.
00:38:48.886 - 00:39:24.126, Speaker B: I think so, too. The last important part, it's like, there are certain things that it's always better if you can take more time to process new information and delay judgment. It's always kind of worked out well, not chasing stuff and just, like, taking your time. Crypto markets are generally, like, every time I feel like I'm missing out on something, I always kind of see it at that price. Maybe it takes six more months, maybe a year, maybe two. But it always pays dividends to actually do the work and be ready because crypto markets will really, really kind of test your conviction. And I think if you do the work, you're kind of fairly more calm in that environment.
00:39:24.126 - 00:39:32.334, Speaker B: So, yeah, I think that's really it. The only thing that is really exciting coming up is drive to survive, I think comes out next week, right?
00:39:32.834 - 00:39:33.346, Speaker A: Yes.
00:39:33.410 - 00:39:35.546, Speaker B: Nice hype. I got some travel coming.
00:39:35.610 - 00:39:35.842, Speaker A: I did.
00:39:35.858 - 00:39:36.414, Speaker B: What?
00:39:36.994 - 00:39:38.306, Speaker A: Yeah, I watched the 10th.
00:39:38.330 - 00:39:42.306, Speaker B: What did you think about not not that. Yeah, it's like, whatever I didn't think about. Entertainment's kind of.
00:39:42.410 - 00:39:55.666, Speaker A: All right, Santi, you. You mentioned people are asking you about. People are asking you about if you're launching a fund. Yeah, I'm gonna. I'm gonna ask you one question. Oh, Jesus Christ. It is February 2, 2023.
00:39:55.666 - 00:40:03.272, Speaker A: By the end of the year, December 31, 2023. Have you started to build something? Whether that's a fund, a company?
00:40:03.368 - 00:40:03.720, Speaker B: Yes.
00:40:03.792 - 00:40:06.336, Speaker A: Something that I am built resemble a fund or RDS.
00:40:06.480 - 00:40:09.164, Speaker B: I am building something right now. It's not a fund.
00:40:10.024 - 00:40:13.256, Speaker A: Will it be okay? Will it be launched in 2023?
00:40:13.360 - 00:40:18.160, Speaker B: What if I told you it's already launched, but no one knows about it? Like, well, it's launched.
00:40:18.352 - 00:40:23.964, Speaker A: What if I told you it's already launched and everyone's using it, but no one knows that Santi is behind it?
00:40:24.784 - 00:40:45.712, Speaker B: That's actually really cool. Here's the thing, guys. Going to have an episode of one of the. In this journey in crypto, I met some of the most remarkable people. Just want the reason why I'm still here. And one of those persons going to come on the pod and you're going to hear his story, and you're going to. I think it's going to be one of the best episodes we're going to have.
00:40:45.712 - 00:40:59.160, Speaker B: And I won't actually hint that maybe at the end we'll disclose that we're working together, but to me, gives me a lot of confidence and, like, I just get talk about, like, a brand, like lvMH.
00:40:59.232 - 00:41:00.640, Speaker A: When are you going to tell people what you're building?
00:41:00.752 - 00:41:10.924, Speaker B: Like, you know, there's, like, not much to report on yet, so I'd rather like, you know, take some time, but I promise it will come before permissionless. Before permissionless.
00:41:11.544 - 00:41:20.742, Speaker A: We do a big coming out party at permissionless. You know, the Robin Hood. The Robin Hood founders announced their crypto wallet for Robin Hood at permissionless on stage. So if you know.
00:41:20.798 - 00:41:21.198, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:41:21.286 - 00:41:26.054, Speaker A: And there's actually another huge company announcing some stuff at permissionless this year, so maybe we get you up there with.
00:41:26.094 - 00:41:45.354, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I want to go to building. It's not. It doesn't involve a fund. But the reason I did this is because this person, I think, is an incredible operator, someone that the crypto ecosystem has benefit, like, will benefit a ton from, because he has just so much knowledge and experience. So I'm just really fortunate to be able to work with him.
00:41:45.454 - 00:41:49.650, Speaker A: Cool. We'll leave it at that. Thanks for listening, folks, and we'll see you guys next week. Yeah.
00:41:49.682 - 00:41:51.074, Speaker B: Thanks, everyone, for listening. Take care.
