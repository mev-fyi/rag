00:00:00.200 - 00:00:13.790, Speaker A: You know, it's funny is we said we'll never do icos again. And then we launched icos with pictures plugged into them. Happy new year. Welcome. Welcome to the first roundup of the year. We're not going to be doing a roundup. We'll get into that in a second.
00:00:13.790 - 00:00:15.878, Speaker A: But, Santi, how you doing, my friend? Happy new year.
00:00:16.006 - 00:00:23.354, Speaker B: I'm doing great. Really refreshed and feeling optimistic, so. Yeah. How are you doing?
00:00:23.774 - 00:00:25.996, Speaker A: I don't speak French. What does your sweater say? Swatch.
00:00:26.020 - 00:00:38.372, Speaker B: It's like the Paris soccer team. Someone gave it to me as a gift. But, yeah, I think it says this is Paris. Fairly obvious, but, yeah, I couldn't see.
00:00:38.388 - 00:00:40.092, Speaker A: The Paris just said, I don't even.
00:00:40.108 - 00:00:52.388, Speaker B: Know how you see. We'll get into one of these things of failure, personal failures that I had this year. I wanted to learn French because I moved from the US, and I haven't done that.
00:00:52.436 - 00:00:56.494, Speaker A: I thought you were gonna say fashion. Cause that was one of your failures. But we can talk about what.
00:00:57.434 - 00:01:10.858, Speaker B: Yeah, well, the folks have made a point on commenting on YouTube about all my. How terrible I've been on a number of fronts, but fashion is certainly one of them. So, yeah, I haven't learned French, and I'm terrible at fashion. So a great way to kick off this episode.
00:01:10.986 - 00:01:22.348, Speaker A: Look, I'm just on my high horse. My. About once a year, my wife tells me that we need to. That I need better clothes. And I always put it off. I'm like, I don't want. I don't want to shop.
00:01:22.348 - 00:01:35.944, Speaker A: I don't want to spend money on a bunch of new clothes. I just don't want to do it. And then she finally, like, pulls the trigger and orders, like, 30 new pieces of clothes for me. And then I try them on, and she. She helps me return them. And one of the pieces I got. I got this new cardigan.
00:01:35.944 - 00:01:39.904, Speaker A: So I'm feeling like I'm on my fashion high horse, you know, I. I.
00:01:39.944 - 00:01:41.152, Speaker B: Used to wear a lot of cardigans.
00:01:41.248 - 00:01:44.656, Speaker A: I've got nice pants, but I don't know if you can. Okay.
00:01:44.720 - 00:01:49.036, Speaker B: Yeah. Married life coming together. I, like, like it.
00:01:49.200 - 00:02:07.836, Speaker A: Yeah. By the way, I was walking. I was also walking in Brooklyn over the break, and I was like, man, I haven't gotten new glasses in, like, three years. So I popped into a warby Parker, and I tried on glasses that look like the ones that you have. Just trying a bunch on, man. I cannot pull off that look. No, this is not my go to.
00:02:08.020 - 00:02:23.596, Speaker B: Allow me. This will be. I don't usually goal set for the year, and I can tell you why. And I've started. Stopped doing this for a long time, but this will be intention that I put forward, which is I will help you find glasses if you need them. I'll help you find.
00:02:23.740 - 00:02:38.148, Speaker A: All right. I will take you up on the, on the new glasses. So here's what, uh, here's what we're doing today. So, same, same format. We're gonna do the same format this year as we did last year. Once a week, we've got a guest episode. The other episode of the week that comes out on Fridays is the weekly roundup.
00:02:38.148 - 00:02:53.106, Speaker A: Same thing. First roundup of the week is gonna be next week. This week, we are doing something different, which is the Empire awards. Is that what we're calling them, Santi? I feel like we need a much better name than that. Like, there's, like, the Webbys, there's. What's our. There's the Dundies.
00:02:53.106 - 00:02:55.494, Speaker A: What's. What's our. What's our name for this?
00:02:56.274 - 00:03:05.014, Speaker B: I don't know. But maybe this is an opportunity to get the. Some of the hardcore listeners involved, and, you know, maybe we'll. We'll get inspiration from them.
00:03:05.634 - 00:03:33.916, Speaker A: You have a good name for the Empire awards? Yeah. Then, then let us know and we'll use it moving forward. So, so what we want to do. So we basically just. There are a bunch of questions that Santi and I talk about, like, hey, what's your craziest prediction for next year? Like, hey, what was, like, your best investment of the year? Like, hey, what was your worst investment of the year? Or, hey, are there any new, like, apps or tools that you're using? And we talked about this, and I thought it'd be really fun to make all of this actually public information. So, hopefully, we don't over share too much. Hopefully you guys find this.
00:03:33.916 - 00:03:39.544, Speaker A: Find this interesting and not too personal and importantly.
00:03:40.604 - 00:04:05.824, Speaker B: Yeah, and I think this is a great idea from you, inspired by some of the feedback that we got from listeners. I mean, we're going into year two, I think, where people tend to, like, is when we talk not just about, you know, industry and business, but also more personal stuff and, you know, not, like, super sensitive stuff, but just personal stuff in terms. And so I'm more than happy to share that people don't like it, you know? You know, definitely does not overbore you to death.
00:04:06.304 - 00:04:31.532, Speaker A: All right, man, let's get into it. So, I'm going to try to break this into, like, industry, not just predictions, because I think everyone's kind of sick of predictions at this point, but, like, you know, kind of, kind of big topics within crypto and then also, like, personal, personal topics. So let's start with some of the industry stuff. Biggest reframe for 2022, in your mind, for crypto or not for crypto? Biggest, like, mental reframing for you.
00:04:31.688 - 00:05:15.974, Speaker B: For crypto, it was definitely the lack of risk management of most crypto service providers. For me, it was a big surprise, and I think it came to a big surprise for most people, where pretty much everyone got caught off guard with one particular trade, which was Luna and the collapse of Luna and the contagion effects that that had, I think, really exposed the fragility of the crypto. I say service providers because it's a centralized parties that were really caught off guard here. You know, you had Luna then. That led to the 3 hours collapse and Genesis and FTX and Almeda and Celsius, block five, voyager. Like, the amount of contagion that that had was really just started with Luna. And I think that was a big.
00:05:15.974 - 00:05:22.882, Speaker B: I think caught a lot of people off guard and sets the tone for 2023 and going forward.
00:05:23.058 - 00:05:34.580, Speaker A: Yeah. Or if they had this, or if they did have good risk. Risk parameters in place, it was. They were all the same risk parameters. Like, they basically all tumbled the same way. Yeah. So that's a.
00:05:34.580 - 00:05:59.114, Speaker A: All right, I think that's a good one. Mine was. I had. I had two here. One is, I think that just from having worked with maker a little bit, and this is the first, you know, I've been a recognized delegate for, I think it's been maybe five or six months now. My takeaway from that is that daos need internal leaders. I think that what you're doing with the DAO is you're putting software in place to automate a lot of things.
00:05:59.114 - 00:06:39.844, Speaker A: I think it's just an extension of, like, software's eating the world. I think that daos are kind of just an extension of that and that, like that. What daos do is they automate a lot, even more processes than SaaS businesses do. But what has become abundantly clear to me, having done season two of Bell Curve, which was all about Daos having worked inside maker for a little bit, is that daos need internal leaders. I'm not saying you have, like, a CEO of the DAO, but much like, more defined internal leaders, because what that does is, um, when things don't go well, you know, it's like, hey, that that person is responsible for that. So it puts responsibility on things. And then I think people are probably sick of hearing me talk about this at this point.
00:06:39.844 - 00:06:55.782, Speaker A: But I got really scarred by, um, I think the second reframe is, uh, that brand nfts, like corporates doing nfts might actually be a real thing. And I've been incredibly skeptical on that for a while, and I've started to change my mind on that.
00:06:55.918 - 00:07:37.514, Speaker B: Yeah, I think just commenting on the first point, which I think is a great observation, not just in crypto, but generally, given the innovation that we're seeing in AI, is this tendency. Yes, we can innovate, we can automate a lot of things, but humans still play a central role in certain functions. You can't collapse hierarchy. Software, yeah, rules the world, but yeah, code is law, but you still need human intervention. There's still a place for humans to interact with technology, I think. And so because AI is not all the rage, but I think there will be, the role for advanced human skills is even going to be greater in how to manage this technology and including working with thousand stuff.
00:07:38.174 - 00:07:57.114, Speaker A: All right, next big reframe. This is a non crypto one. I have a feeling you'll disagree with me here. I've come to the belief that angel investing is not a good way to make money. That could be the part of the market that we're at. Like, that could be a very bear market take. But I think I did.
00:07:57.114 - 00:08:49.468, Speaker A: I think I made twelve or somewhere between twelve to 15 angel investments in 2022. And this year has just shown me how difficult it is for a, a startup to really hit it big and for your angel portfolio to really make good returns. So a couple of things that, let me just, I'll play this out a little bit. If you look at some of the companies that, like, let's say you, angel invested in some of the best companies in crypto, like flashback a year, and you're like, I have an amazing portfolio. I invested several years ago in Bitgo, Circle, Blockfi, on paper, the companies that have done incredibly well. So what happens is, I think there's just, like, a lot of ways that these companies can not give you liquidity, do really well, but still not give you liquidity. For example, Circle wanted to IPO, then the market shit the bed.
00:08:49.468 - 00:09:11.066, Speaker A: So they haven't Ipo'd yet or done their spac or whatever they were going to do. What's another one? Blockfi. Blockfi was like, this darling company was raising at like three or four or $5 billion. Obviously, Blockfi's falling apart another one bitgo. Bitgo. If you had angel invested in them, you would have waited several years, and then you get this amazing return when they sell for like a billion or 1.2 to galaxy.
00:09:11.066 - 00:09:40.904, Speaker A: But now that deal has fallen apart. Right. So it's just shown me how like, how important the a, how tough it is to make a return. B, I think I underweighted the illiquidity premium and like, not having. Having put a lot of capital into these companies means less capital in a bear market to buy ETH at $1,000, for example. So I think I underweighted that. And I also.
00:09:40.904 - 00:09:43.864, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, those are my, that's my, that's my reframing.
00:09:44.024 - 00:10:40.554, Speaker B: I think I would have told you that, exactly that same observation last cycle, because that was a theme for me, where I had so many liquid investments and mispricing the liquidity premium, 2030, 40%, however. And so I think I would definitely push back that angel investing or just early stage investing is not like a good strategy. I think the sample size is going to be tricky, like the cohort of companies that you're investing into. The value entry points is going to matter a lot. I think your sample size is a bit skewed to centralized players in crypto, which goes back to the point of liquidity, because you could also have invested in. For me, early stage is also buying certain tokens at a valuation that resembles early stage. I think that you have liquidity there.
00:10:40.554 - 00:11:39.562, Speaker B: I think that the time for a company to go public and get liquidity in traditional. In traditional venture and certain pockets of venture of crypto, like blockfi and some other players, getting liquidity is tough. But in crypto, it's sort of like a weird asset class where you can get liquidity much faster if you invest in certain projects. And you can use that token, you don't necessarily have to sell it, but you can use it, you can stake it, you can borrow against it. That is one of the key properties, I think, of this asset class, which is historically, I think there was a point where venture, traditional venture, the time to exit, time to liquidity was much compressed than where it is now. But crypto allows you to have much more liquidity. So, yeah, I don't think it's dead, for what it's worth, I'll continue to do it, but I do think that managing capital and cash flow to be able to invest, like for instance, as you said in ETH of 1000, is really important.
00:11:39.718 - 00:12:11.668, Speaker A: Yeah, I think I'm just thinking about how many kind of deals I want to do and how much capital to deploy into these angel deals in 2023. And one thing that's very clear to me is that I'm still so new to the angel investing game. I think I maybe did two or three deals in 2021, like twelve or 15 in 2022. I'm not good. I know this about myself so far, or just, I don't know. Like, each time I would make an investment, I would write down, like, I think this is going to do x. I think, like, the timeframe is here.
00:12:11.668 - 00:12:23.596, Speaker A: I think here's why it'll do well. Those were not correct. Like, I was pretty all over the place in my, I don't have a good understanding yet of, like, yeah, the.
00:12:23.620 - 00:12:55.736, Speaker B: Thing is, like, I'll tell you truth, most I do go back and say some of my best investments felt really uncomfortable, not obvious. And as you said, totally missed my. I always do like a downside case, base case, upside case. And I can tell you the ones that seem more obvious, clean bets were not. The ones that were more uncomfortable. Just surprised me, both upside and downside. And I think the key, though, is I think we obsess a lot about it hasn't been a good investment.
00:12:55.736 - 00:13:01.124, Speaker B: So when you ask the question, it's difficult because you have to sort of take a snapshot point in time.
00:13:03.764 - 00:13:04.220, Speaker A: And.
00:13:04.292 - 00:13:44.216, Speaker B: What could be a terrible investment might turn out to be a fantastic investment in the next two, three years. And so the key is just being patient. And the best exercise that I've done is just understanding that these things are going to take time. And if you're not positioning yourself to be very patient and wait like five years, ten years, then you're likely going to put yourself in a bad situation where you're going to be forced to sell or eager to sell. And so it is very tricky to do that observation, especially in this moment in time where you take a snapshot and everything's down considerably. And so it's sort of like a power. It is very much a power law distribution.
00:13:44.216 - 00:13:57.540, Speaker B: I play the game, I think of it in probabilities. Like, okay, if I'm investing in a cohort of 50 companies, I just know that it's going to be one or two that really carry the day and really make up for all the losses. But it's tough, though.
00:13:57.612 - 00:14:22.264, Speaker A: I think where it got tough for me is like, I don't, I basically, you know, peanut butter spread or whatever the right word is. Like, if I took x amount of capital and I invested it in ten companies, I just kind of took x divided by ten. Right. Whereas I'd like, if I do other investments, I would never do it like that. I'd be like, I have more conviction here, so I'm going to put more. But anyways, I want to, I want to move through these. So what was your, what was your biggest reframe for non crypto?
00:14:22.804 - 00:15:21.848, Speaker B: I think generally it is this idea that you have to dance while the music is playing, but you have to really make sure one where the exit is and how big that door is. And I think it ties back to Luna, for instance, like Luna could have worked. There's a couple of reasons where in a scenario where Luna could have worked if they had perhaps diversified the treasury better and the market hadn't shifted as much. The problem was that the size of the people in that party grew from one to 100, the size of that door didn't. And so that has a whole host of problems. And I think it emphasizes the broader point that I think we're going to see going into 2023 is it really exposes exposing market fragility when there's lack of liquidity. And you saw that kind of in the UK during the mini budget, like, pension funds were scrambling to sell assets to cover kind of liabilities because the gilt market just kind of basically shut down overnight.
00:15:21.848 - 00:16:02.764, Speaker B: And it was really interesting to see that because we're used to saying and thinking that crypto markets are fairly, very underdeveloped. But I think we're going to start to see where things really break when, when you're in a different market environment that you haven't had in the last twelve years. So for me, that's a big reframe. It's like people still need to allocate capital. They're kind of forced to as asset managers. But it's this idea of just being perhaps more nimble when you're thinking like you could have set in November 2021 markets coming down. In crypto you said, okay, yeah, rates are going up.
00:16:02.764 - 00:16:33.114, Speaker B: And then just like being really. It's sort of this tension that you have on one end, you want to be a long term investor in another. You're seeing some profound changes that haven't happened in the last twelve years. You're hearing folks even as late as like the summer, where most people are like, you know, we've seen a pretty, pretty big move from stance and rate hikes since March. That was still early. Like, you could have like, exited the market then. And so it's, I think it goes back to the episode with Eric Peters which is survival.
00:16:33.114 - 00:17:06.406, Speaker B: And sometimes you could just go years without doing anything. But the most important thing. And he said something that is really, for me, it was really an eye opener. It was just such a simple framing of it, which was, you can't even be lucky when you're dead. You can't even buy a lottery ticket when you're dead. And so I think that's a big, you know, you count your blessings going into the year if you're, if you're in this position where you have some capital. But being very, I think nimble is something that has been a big kind of a reset reframe for me.
00:17:06.550 - 00:17:12.434, Speaker A: I like that one. Favorite project or business of the year.
00:17:13.134 - 00:17:42.928, Speaker B: No surprise. I mean, folks have heard me talk about this and none of this is, look, there's certain bias because I'm an investor in some of these companies all speak from experience, because the project, I'll frame it as the project I spent the most amount of time last year. I was going through. This question is Alluvia, I've been the longest standing council member there. And coming off of parafy, I was very, I still am very bullish on the, on the gaming category. And so, like, thematically, my favorite kind of theme is gaming. I think it's making crypto relatable.
00:17:42.928 - 00:18:09.968, Speaker B: We'll make it mainstream. We'll be the catalyst next cycle. And, you know, there's certain games that have come a long way. You know, when I first was a seed, did the seed run for Illuvium in like December of 2020? You know, they've gone from zero to 150 developers, artists, gamers, sorry, designers. So the team's grown a lot. They've launched and they've executed on the roadmap pretty impressively. And what is really interesting is kind of this, they're being opening, like building in the open.
00:18:09.968 - 00:18:59.332, Speaker B: And the way that they've launched the, like, they've launched the auto battler game and then they launched like, land nfts. Now they're about to launch the game where, you know, mobile and desktop where people can, you know, develop that land. And so they're building in the open but also maintaining a certain level of centralization of the team, getting the community involved. And I think it's going to be a blueprint for other game studios out there trying to navigate and enter into web3. So for me, I'm just excited about the way that I think it's going to be a good example of how to develop a web3 game. And also a reminder, games take a long time to develop. It's just been very interesting to see how the community sometimes has been frustrated that they haven't moved fast enough.
00:18:59.332 - 00:19:34.662, Speaker B: And, you know, it's sort of this tension. But for me, it's been just a very rewarding experience of being involved and seeing how all this is kind of shaping up. And I think this year is going to be, people are going to increasingly understand how the different kind of three different games that illuvium is building are stitching together quite nicely, integrating nfts and, you know, from. From, like, catching, like, cards like Pokemon to lands like Sim City and then building them all together and then auto battling and leveling up. So I think the, like, the game is coming together quite nicely. So for me, it's definitely luby.
00:19:34.838 - 00:20:00.914, Speaker A: Yeah. Kieran just messaged me today, actually. I think it sounds like they have a big announcement coming out this week. So mine was actually the blockchain association, which I have. There's another category, like breakout companies. Maybe we can move into that, where I have maybe more of like, a crypto native answer. But I think this was a year where the regulatory side of things actually could have gone really poorly, especially if Sam's bill got pushed forward faster than it did if things maybe didn't get slowed down before we have.
00:20:00.914 - 00:20:38.544, Speaker A: While the Dem still own both the Senate and the House, I think things could have looked really differently at this time if there weren't folks like coincenter, but also really the blockchain association going to Batford and. And for crypto and really being the voice of crypto and DC. So I think this was a pretty important year for. This was a year when I think a lot of folks in DC could have really got a black eye by crypto, and I think they did. But I think we have. We have the blockchain association on our side really going to bat for crypto. So I'll give them a call out.
00:20:39.244 - 00:20:45.064, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. By the way, the senator that was pushing the bill, the SBF bill, resigned today, I believe.
00:20:45.924 - 00:20:47.020, Speaker A: Oh, wow. I missed that.
00:20:47.052 - 00:20:48.224, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah.
00:20:49.404 - 00:21:18.656, Speaker A: Crypto person of the year. I struggled with this, but I did say, I actually said Ryan Wyatt from Polygon. So he came over. I think he was running YouTube's, like, gaming studio or something like that. Or maybe I think he was running YouTube's gaming studio. If you just look at the Polygon deals that they've closed this year, it's like Polygon has brought in DraftKings, Adobe, the NFL, Liverpool, Starbucks, Adidas, Prada, Walt Disney. I'm sure.
00:21:18.656 - 00:21:40.798, Speaker A: I'm missing others. Facebook, stripe, like Instagram. They brought in all these huge traditional institutional brands, web two players into crypto and things haven't really happened with that so far, but I'm optimistic that in 2023 those brands actually do something. Yeah, I'll give a shout out to Ryan there, definitely.
00:21:40.846 - 00:22:30.128, Speaker B: For me, it was very clear the, the Ethereum developers working on the merge sometimes. So like Tim Bico, Justin Drake, Roald Jordan, among others. There's a great article that just covers and profiles like eight of them, but it was a huge overhaul and people forget, but it's been, you know, years in the making and I think these guys have been very consistent and patient. And so kudos to them because I think the merge was, I think, one of the more important developments of crypto history. The ability to really show people that such a distributed, decentralized system can agree and make such a big transition. Kind of this analogy of building an airplane while in flight. Certainly the airplane is an important, you know, and carrying a lot of passengers.
00:22:30.128 - 00:22:43.826, Speaker B: And so I think these guys really carried a very stressful but important role. And the merge for me was one of the more will, I think, go down as one of the more fascinating, important milestones of this industry. If we look back in the next.
00:22:43.850 - 00:23:07.522, Speaker A: Ten years, I would say not just this industry. One thing that was interesting about on the day the merge happened is you had folks from kind of just like very respected software people commenting on how impressive this big open source development really was. Like the Collison brothers at Stripe. You had Toby from Shopify, um, pretty og, like Linux. People just commenting on how, how tough it is to actually push this through. So. All right, that's a great answer.
00:23:07.522 - 00:23:16.146, Speaker A: I like, I like your answer a lot. Um, breakout companies of the year or breakout company of the year. Um, who'd you say here, I'll start.
00:23:16.170 - 00:23:18.494, Speaker B: With the theme, uh, I think crypto.
00:23:19.194 - 00:23:21.374, Speaker A: Are you doing 2022?
00:23:22.154 - 00:24:11.154, Speaker B: Well, I guess I have both, but I'll do 2022 and then you can do 2022. 2022 for me was thematically, I think crypto became much more relatable, mainstream for people finally kind of for me, and I'll notice for me, it was just easier to explain crypto. And I had people actually come to me for like an invite for step in and, or thinking about nfts. And, you know, nfts have been around for a while, but I think certainly, like, 2022 was a year where people like you had, you know, even the nfts and lifestyle apps, early ones in their beta forum, like Stepn or Illuvium, auto battler, whatever. And also, as you alluded to, normal brands really entering the fold. And so for me, thematically, that was like a breakout theme. The company that I picked, again, I'm biased because I'm an investor and I'm an advisor.
00:24:11.154 - 00:24:34.966, Speaker B: So full disclosure, and none of this advice or financial advice or whatever is Stepn. It was really interesting because they launched in December, I guess technically of 2021. In 2022, they were only in their beta form, but I think they become very quickly a number one app. And I had people that have been historically very skeptical on crypto ping me and say, hey, can I get an invite code? Because I want to, you know, I'm running marathon.
00:24:35.030 - 00:24:42.614, Speaker A: Well, forget about that period of time when there's a bunch of, like a lot of the web, two people, like big web, two people or non crypto folks are like, let me get a step in code. Let me get a step in code.
00:24:42.654 - 00:25:43.656, Speaker B: Yeah, you know, and, you know, I think, look, there are criticisms now, especially, you know, of in game economics. And this play to earn, I think, is a misnomer. It's not a perfect app they're working hard on. And we had a great episode of Yawn from step in here, so people should go to it. But, yeah, for me, I think an app like Stepn is breakout in the sense that it made crypto very relatable, especially for people that historically have been very skeptical. And it's this idea that if we're going to come out of this bear market putting macro on the side, it's going to be because the bar to acquire a user in crypto has gone up meaningfully, given all the blow ups this year. And so it's really puts the pressure on the industry to deliver beautiful apps that without a question, you're going to be using because you stopped using post when you had email, you stopped using, you know, the train when you could fly.
00:25:43.656 - 00:26:03.444, Speaker B: It's the same. The bar is really high. And so I think, you know, it's, it's good, frankly, it weeds out a lot of bullshit. And it, and, you know, I think you have to deliver a beautiful app or a product. And so Stepan, I think, gave us early indications of what that might look like for other companies.
00:26:03.864 - 00:26:35.070, Speaker A: My breakout, I have two breakout companies of the year, and it's tied around two of the biggest themes of the year, staking and Mev. And those are two areas of crypto that could have been very, just centralized with, like to run an ETH validator node, for example, you need 32 ETH. You need a computer system with high quality cpu. You need operational knowledge to run a validator node. I think you need approval from the network, which has, like, a long wait. I think you need that. I'm not entirely sure, actually.
00:26:35.070 - 00:27:06.336, Speaker A: So then the other. The only other option would be like, kind of staking through a centralized exchange, like a coinbase or binance, or whoever Kraken offers it. After their acquisition of staked, Lido came onto the scene and unlocked the ability for people to do for steeth. Right. And it was like, anyone. So I think Lido helped to, like, not decentralize staking, but, like, give more people the opportunity to participate in staking. So I think Lido and then the.
00:27:06.360 - 00:27:12.364, Speaker B: Other one, it's a collective of validators that are approved by kind of a collective group.
00:27:12.744 - 00:28:05.584, Speaker A: But on the MEV front, I would say, I mean, flashbots, right? Like, flashbots, you've got MEV is like, people are figuring out, is like, the one of the best ways for blockchains to monetize. And flashbots builds these tools to make MEV accessible to users who otherwise might be maybe technical, technically, or like, financially enable to participate in MEV. And it just makes the process more transparent. So you've had, I don't know how much money, probably at this point, billions, or over a billion, I would assume, has been extracted through MEV using flashbots. Yeah. So big shout out to both flashbots and Lido, my breakout company, for 2023. I think that staking continues to get bigger in 2023, and leveraging ETH security to continue building on the network will get bigger.
00:28:05.584 - 00:28:38.764, Speaker A: It's tough for me to say, like, one company, I think, in the predictions I talked about Uniswap, I think Uniswap, who had kind of a quiet year in 2022, will have a big year in 2023. But that feels like a boring answer. So my answer is actually a less known company, which is Eigen layer. I'm not an investor. I've no part. I've never even talked to their team, actually, they're coming on the podcast soon, which will be the first time I've ever talked to them. But I think this year, you're going to see a lot more innovation in ETH staking, as capital is going to want more secure forms of yield.
00:28:38.764 - 00:29:17.124, Speaker A: I think what Eigen layer is doing, from my understanding, is particularly innovative staking project, where they provide security as a service to roll ups and bridges and oracles. It allows those projects to leverage ETH stake security to supplement or like complement the security that's provided by their native token. So I think they're launching, I think restaking the restaking protocol, the first like middleware using the restaking mechanism called Eigen Da data availability I think it is anyways, I don't, that's my kind of farther out there prediction. So what do you think about breakout company in 2023?
00:29:17.244 - 00:29:28.492, Speaker B: I didn't have one purposely. I do have overlooked verticals, innovations and crypto going on right now, but I purposely skip this one. Maybe we should talk about like the unsexy businesses of the year 2022. 2023.
00:29:28.588 - 00:29:29.932, Speaker A: Go for it. Unsexy businesses.
00:29:30.028 - 00:30:09.994, Speaker B: More of an interesting, interesting question. For me, it's this. I'm not actually an investor here, but I do think it's going to be a big thing for this idea of credentialing and gatekeeping of crypto. Front ends is going to be pretty important. Identity nfts that comply, that kind of attest to KYC AML, I think is going to be very important. You have a company like Burada that is kind of minting you an NFT once you've kind of gone through verification process. And I think that really opens up to something you said just now where uniswap is going to have a pretty good year, but it's a boring answer.
00:30:09.994 - 00:30:54.724, Speaker B: Defi is a boring sector, has been for a while. The yield farming days at Wirth on are gone, but a lot of, a lot of foundation is there. And so I think, I think decentralized, permissioned Defi is going to be a thing, permission nonsense. Like anyone can interact, but I think trust, I'd rather frame it as trusted pools of liquidity are going to become the primary liquidity venues in Defi. You probably will continue to have this non trusted, but trusted. I mean, everyone in the pool is, Kyc has a burrata Nft or some sort of Nft. And that really, I think, opens up one, I think it's going to marry nicely with some, whatever regulatory guidance we're going to have going forward.
00:30:54.724 - 00:31:36.350, Speaker B: And two, I think it really will, we're going to see Defi resurge at some point. It's not dead. I think the recent blow ups have further solidified the reason of existence of Defi. Where it thrives, where it doesn't thrive. Capital efficiency has always been an issue, probably will always be an issue. But maybe with trusted pools of liquidity, you kind of solve a lot of the things that a lot of people are critical of. Defi, particularly capital efficiency, I think really gets solved once you have trusted pools of liquidity, where JP Morgan can interact with Goldman, where I can interact with you, Jason.
00:31:36.350 - 00:32:07.734, Speaker B: I know the counterparty very well in this pool, an amm or money market like Aave. And so I think that is going to be. I think Defi continues to be unsexy, but shines again. And I think in order for this to work, you need trusted pools of liquidity. And I see identity nfts really important kind of front and center in unlocking that.
00:32:07.894 - 00:32:35.106, Speaker A: Nice. I like that answer. My unsexy business of 2022. I have two answers. One is Coinbase. Because Coinbase got a ton of shit for not being crypto native enough and just being this boring business when, if you remember back in the raging bull market, they were getting pushed by the crypto community, turned on Coinbase. And so I'll just say, like, they've just, like, stuck to their lane and built and like, I'll give, I'll give Coinbase a shout out.
00:32:35.106 - 00:32:51.562, Speaker A: I will also give a shout out to unsexy businesses of the year. Anyone who didn't chase this, like, wild venture backed narrative that we've been on for the last decade. So bootstrapped, profitable businesses, I've got a soft spot for them. I will also say.
00:32:51.738 - 00:32:53.114, Speaker B: You mean like block words?
00:32:53.274 - 00:32:55.214, Speaker A: Yeah, but there's a lot of other good ones out there.
00:32:56.234 - 00:32:57.106, Speaker B: You know, just.
00:32:57.170 - 00:33:02.330, Speaker A: I have a saucepan hurt. I mean, that's why I think, I think it was tough, honestly.
00:33:02.522 - 00:33:12.042, Speaker B: I think what you more personal question. At some point, you would have gotten approached by a lot of people, wanted to give you money. We get a product.
00:33:12.178 - 00:33:13.194, Speaker A: Yeah, all the time.
00:33:13.234 - 00:33:14.290, Speaker B: I'm sure you get all the time.
00:33:14.402 - 00:33:15.094, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:33:15.714 - 00:33:23.854, Speaker B: How did you, like, navigate that? Did you ever look back and say, gosh, if we don't do it, we're gonna be at a disadvantage and we got to, like, put feudalists.
00:33:23.894 - 00:34:12.954, Speaker A: That's why I have a lot of respect for someone like Coinbase. Because when you see other companies who are your direct competitors built like doing something crazy, like hiring, hiring like crazy or something like that, it's very easy to get FOMO looking at competitors. And I mean, during the bull market, Mike and I definitely had that right, looking at some competitors who, like, we know their business models inside and out, just like, you know, Brian knows new the FtX business inside and out because you're building the same thing as them or something very similar. So we know the business models of all the other crypto media companies very well. And when we have the same amount of employees, they have the same amount of employees, but then they grow by 400% and we only grow by 20%, we're like, hmm, something's going on there. So there's use. Like, I think it's easy to get a lot of FOMo and start chasing after competitors.
00:34:12.954 - 00:34:35.734, Speaker A: But, yeah, we. I mean, yeah, we just. I think in general, it doesn't make sense for media companies to raise capital until they have. Maybe until they, or unless they have a product that sits at the bottom of the media funnel, then it. Then it makes sense to consider it, at least. So. Yeah.
00:34:35.734 - 00:35:28.972, Speaker A: So unsexy business of this year. I think that one thing that came up in the Colleen and Peter Brevin Howard episode that launches on Monday is custody and exchanges separating, excuse me, custody and settlement finally starting to separate from centralized exchanges. What we call an exchange in crypto is it's really a brokerage, it's an exchange, it's a custodian. It's a clearing and settlement provider. It looks very different in traditional capital markets. I think there are a couple of companies that are going to do really well from that separation. Anchorage, fire blocks, copper, all of these un sexy capital markets providers, institutional capital markets providers for crypto, especially those three.
00:35:28.972 - 00:35:46.586, Speaker A: There's other ones who bitgo, I'm sure will do well, too. Those are unsexy businesses that are probably going to do really well as regulation comes down and stuff like that. All right, I'll throw one at you. Do you want to do wildest prediction for 2023 or highest conviction bet for 2023?
00:35:46.770 - 00:35:48.014, Speaker B: It's the same, actually.
00:35:48.354 - 00:35:48.730, Speaker A: All right.
00:35:48.762 - 00:36:07.314, Speaker B: For me, the answer is the same. I think Ethereum flips bitcoin. You know, this has been. People might say this is a very, like, normie. Enter. You know, you're roughly at 45% dominance right now. And I just think the narrative for ETH is really solidified with the merge.
00:36:07.314 - 00:36:23.794, Speaker B: There are some issues with centralization. I get it. But I do think that, you know, I'll just give you a data point. So ETH and bitcoin are down exactly 75% from their all time highs this cycle. Last cycle. So 2017, 2019, ETH was down like 95%. Bitcoin is down 80%.
00:36:23.794 - 00:36:30.714, Speaker B: You know, it's not the only reason and the only thing I look at, but I think that's indicative of.
00:36:33.014 - 00:36:33.350, Speaker A: The.
00:36:33.382 - 00:37:15.538, Speaker B: Resiliency of ETH, of Ethereum's network. And I started to observe that the folks coming in, I think really, I struggle with bitcoin's narrative because it's not a hedge really against inflation. It's not really a macro hedge, really smart macro. Guys, don't put on this trade. Finally, I think it's sort of been, we'll give you the benefit of the Dow because we hadn't been through a recession and we're going through one now. And this has just behaved like a risk on asset. Can it become a digital gold in 100 years? Most likely, but it's just going to take time.
00:37:15.538 - 00:37:49.822, Speaker B: And I just think that, look, even if it becomes digital gold, it's a trillion market, the settlement layer, the Internet is much bigger than that. And I think ETH has really come out strong in that. And I think the use cases, we've had this discussion before. I'm not icomaxi. I do like bitcoin in some capacity, but I think the reason for me to hold bitcoin is just not there. I do need to hold ETH for a number of reasons. I use it and it's important for me.
00:37:49.822 - 00:39:02.622, Speaker B: And, you know, I stake it, I get some yield and I pay for gas. And so I do think that in a recovery, you know, ETH really outperforms bitcoin to a point where if it doesn't flip it, it comes very, very close to flipping it. And my best, highest conviction bet, we talked about early stage investing. I do think that like outperforming the majors, particularly ethereum, is really hard, very hard over a long term horizon, medium long term horizon. And I arguably think it's like the best risk adjusted bet if you're going to allocate a crypto. I think for me, going back to your opening line of I'm doubting if angel investing is really worth it. My benchmark to always, is this going to outperform me? And like applying like a sharp ratio and like thinking, okay, when I say risk adjusted, it's a very nebulous financial like metric because how do you think, but I just think about it from, if I make an investment in like, you know, the liquidity component, the, you know, this idea that a team, I just close shop and, you know, might be, you know, it has all the risks of an early stage venture and team building and what have you.
00:39:02.622 - 00:39:31.494, Speaker B: Like, Ethereum has just grown into this thing that is, is executing working. It's not perfect, but I think it just gives you really, for me, over time, it's harder and harder to justify making an investment rotating ETH into that. And so, yeah, you know, I think, I think Ethereum is a very clean bet on the industry. And the industry's growth.
00:39:32.554 - 00:39:58.674, Speaker A: I need, I need to think about that one. It's funny being on. So we've got this Empire podcast. I also sit in and sometimes co host the Bell Curve podcast with Mike. And the other, we do another roundup with Vance and Michael from framework, and they're both Uber ETH bulls. So I've been inundated with you, Michael and Vance spitting the ETH narrative. Yeah.
00:39:58.674 - 00:40:28.842, Speaker A: Maybe my pushback would just be that in the last bear market, bitcoin was that thing where it was like you just like every, everyone was like, Bitcoin was what you are saying today, where it's like, no if ands or buts. Like bitcoin is. Bitcoin is the only thing. You put your whole portfolio in bitcoin and you will make it. And I don't know, it didn't really turn out that way. Maybe. Here's my question for you.
00:40:28.842 - 00:40:41.108, Speaker A: What would make you change your mind? What would make you reconsider that? I think, is there something with the app chain thesis? Something with another l one? Something with things getting built on bitcoins.
00:40:41.196 - 00:41:56.628, Speaker B: Like develop two things, developers, the number of developer activity meaningfully shifting away from theory, like seeing top developers, top teams leaving, could be part of the app chain thesis, like building on Cosmos, like Dy DX. If I see another 20, Dy DX is leaving Ethereum, departing Ethereum and moving to another chain, or building their own. We talked about vertical integration, for instance, like an app building their own chain, then that could be one. And the second one is this censorship of transactions becoming a really big issue. If that happens, I think we have a more existential question crisis in the industry, because that would probably mean that they shut down and make define possible. And it's really a full blown out in that tail risk that we always have had in crypto, which is there could be a version where when you try to separate money and state, or become, make it more decentralized, there's gonna be people that are not gonna be happy about that and can make your life, still, can make your life very, very difficult. And I think that, you know, tornado cast situation was something that I think was, I understand the motivation of why it happened.
00:41:56.628 - 00:42:30.704, Speaker B: We had a great discussion with a few, two podcasts touching on this, but people I think were pretty paranoid of this censorship component. And what I mean by that is a lot of validators are in a place like the US, and the US government could say, hey, listen, you're validating a transaction of an unknown enemy of the state. That's not. You know, that's an issue. Right. So going against OFAC, and so it says gamma was doing trade with Iran or North Korea. That's not legal.
00:42:30.704 - 00:42:40.484, Speaker B: And so, yeah, I think that would probably give me pause. And I think that further shifts the pendulum back to, okay, bitcoin doesn't have this issue.
00:42:41.184 - 00:43:03.354, Speaker A: Here's the bet I'll make for 2023 is that that maybe would fall into the bucket of, like, a non ETH maxi type thing is. I think a tier one defi protocol this year will launch its own chain. And I think we're going to see. I think we're at the be well compound tried it. Compound tried it with polkadot, and it didn't work out.
00:43:03.974 - 00:43:11.936, Speaker B: Talk about a project that we haven't talked at all this year. You control f. Polka dot cricket.
00:43:11.960 - 00:43:13.304, Speaker A: Polka dot. Not. Yeah.
00:43:13.384 - 00:43:16.024, Speaker B: I mean, eos, but polka dot. Yeah, yeah.
00:43:16.104 - 00:43:36.090, Speaker A: Polka dot blew, I think, a massive opportunity, but. So, like, compound tried to build their own chain, from my understanding, and they did it with Polkadot, and it was, like, colossal headache, and they dropped it. If they had chosen cosmos, I just wonder what. Like, the. I think the app chain thesis would be a lot stronger, and I think the app chain thesis. I mean, we're doing season three of Bell curve on the app chain thesis. Like, I think we're gonna.
00:43:36.090 - 00:43:44.940, Speaker A: I think it'll be a narrative this year. So, anyways, that's a. That's a thought. Let's move past it. Most overlooked. Do you want to do most overlooked vertical in crypto?
00:43:44.972 - 00:43:45.772, Speaker B: Yeah, let's cover that quickly.
00:43:45.828 - 00:43:46.628, Speaker A: Let's cover that quickly.
00:43:46.676 - 00:44:29.454, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay. EIP 4844. This is really sets the stage for scaling. I think, you know, we're all excited about zero knowledge proofs and ZK rollups and everything, but I think roll ups in the short and medium term, possibly even longer term, are really kind of a very trustless scaling solution for Ethereum. And I think that EIP 4844 really help continue to push the ecosystem, the Ethereum ecosystem, towards roll ups. And for context, I don't know how much you want me to go four, but people go read about it.
00:44:29.834 - 00:44:37.454, Speaker A: Blobs. I'm just excited for there to be blobs. I mean, it's just a great. Love that word. I'm pumped. I'm a big believer in this great.
00:44:38.154 - 00:44:40.610, Speaker B: Great words behind great technology.
00:44:40.802 - 00:44:46.882, Speaker A: Proto dank sharding with blob carrying transactions, man. Okay.
00:44:46.938 - 00:45:21.558, Speaker B: I mean, it's just such a funky but great word. Yeah. So, yeah, I mean, roll up. He's considerably down, right. Everyone talks about at some point l two hits, a limitation point. And I've had this discussion with teams like arbitrum and scroll and others, and we've had on the podcast around, hey, is there a time where an l two just hits a threshold, a limiting capacity? But I think this innovation, EFP 48 44, really opens, like, gives further Runway for an l two to credibly support. I mean, I don't know the number.
00:45:21.558 - 00:45:53.756, Speaker B: I've asked this to a lot of devs, like, what is that number? Is it billionaire? How many billion users, how many volume of transactions would this allow for and open up? But I think it's meaningful and I think it coincides if this goes through, would really just marry nicely in terms of timing, of potentially seeing, continue to see more lifetime lifestyle apps, people coming in and trying to play a game or buy nfts or whatever, interacting, some sort of metaverse that is hyped up by Yuka labs or whatever. So I think this is a key piece of innovation.
00:45:53.900 - 00:46:30.498, Speaker A: I like it. My most overlooked vertical innovation in crypto right now. I actually had an answer that ties back to what you were saying earlier, which is I wrote a combination of nfts as cookies, digital identity projects, which kind of combines into one thing, which is your wallet being your home for all things digital, not just crypto. I think we think of wallets today as, like, where I store my crypto assets. I think then it becomes, like, where I store my crypto assets and my jpegs, and maybe better and more fun way to use, and then it becomes just my home for my digital identity.
00:46:30.546 - 00:46:32.794, Speaker B: Home password, credentialing system.
00:46:32.874 - 00:47:01.044, Speaker A: Yeah. And I just think the wallet, like Metamask, has never had a real competitor, and this is the year they get real competitors. So I think we'll see the, we went from the exchange wars of 2017 to the l one wars of 2020, 2021 into the the wallet wars of 2023. 2024. And you've heard me talk about this before, but I think that's an overlooked sector that I think when we used to overlook other l one s and now l one s are huge. I think we'll think about wallets in the same way by the end of the year.
00:47:01.384 - 00:47:02.324, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:47:03.064 - 00:47:06.376, Speaker A: Most overhyped thing in crypto right now, surprisingly.
00:47:06.400 - 00:47:48.204, Speaker B: I'll say utility nfts and the metaverse, in the sense that I want to make a distinction. I'm very excited about games. I do think that nfTs, as we're seeing them just in their current form, like art is pretty cool, but I struggle when teams, like, kind of confuse and try to like, promise that they're gonna build a metaverse and, you know, bring utility. Like, like, you go and buy art, it's because you like it. You don't expect that art to do pretty much anything other than like, be visually appealing and convey something to you. For this reason. I think just punks have a very clear and defined role in that, in the art NFT scene.
00:47:48.204 - 00:48:24.828, Speaker B: But I think that, like, a lot of projects in the art NFT scene will go through this identity crisis of just saying, yeah, I don't think we're going to be able to build a metaverse here. And, and then it becomes really kind of difficult. So I think it's a very hyped, very high because we're seeing a lot of activity nfts. But just be very clear. My best advice, to be very clear on what you're doing and, like, building a metaverse, the team of 20 people is very, look at Facebook. I mean, Facebook is probably very hard.
00:48:24.876 - 00:48:27.756, Speaker A: I think I would correct you. It's very impossible.
00:48:27.940 - 00:48:43.900, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, like, look, Facebook is probably gonna shut down their like, whole metaverse initiative. It's gonna be weird because they rebranded to meta, but I think for the reasons they're gonna get so much pressure, it's a reminder that it's gonna take a lot of time to build a metaverse.
00:48:43.972 - 00:48:53.064, Speaker A: So, yeah, you know, it's funny is we said we'll never do icos again. And then we launched icos with pictures plugged into them.
00:48:54.124 - 00:48:55.184, Speaker B: What was yours?
00:48:56.044 - 00:49:21.884, Speaker A: Bored apes. I think it is absurd that the price of that apes still have a 75 ETH floor. I think people bought apes primarily because all these celebs were buying board apes. And now it's come out that like, the celebs had been gifted these apes and that they had no interest in the apes. And that that is basically just like a sponsorship deal. I mean, it'll go down as one of the best sponsorship influencer marketing deals of all time. That I think.
00:49:21.884 - 00:49:48.314, Speaker A: I think it was Moonpay who, who middleman a lot of those deals. And like, I just think, you know, if the, if it was like, I've been to a Doodles party, it's pretty fun. I went to like a punks event, or like an event where there's like, mainly people with punks. It's pretty fun. Like good people, like real crypto ogs. The doodles people were just like, honestly, I described as like good vibes, just like friendly good people trying to get along. I went to a bourdie party.
00:49:48.314 - 00:50:08.962, Speaker A: It was awful. It was just like cringe. Like, I was like, oh, man, like you, I don't like you as a person, and I don't like you, like, repping the industry. And it's just really cringe. And I think, like, when I see someone with a bored ape now, I'm like, as your profile picture, I get it's a negative connotation in my mind. I'm like, that is a, like, that's a toleration. Yeah, it's pretty.
00:50:08.962 - 00:50:13.626, Speaker A: And I think it's a pretty cringe thing. So I just think, I think board apes are wildly overvalued right now.
00:50:13.730 - 00:50:34.892, Speaker B: So this was one of my terrible predictions of the year, right? If you people may recall, in 2022, I said the floor for, for punks, the floor for board apes is never going to be higher than punks is the size it will be. But, you know, still the floor for punks now is like 62. So it's below like board apes. Yeah, still. So, yeah, yeah. Okay.
00:50:34.988 - 00:50:38.784, Speaker A: Business you want to see built in 2023, crypto, non crypto or you want to skip?
00:50:40.204 - 00:51:08.438, Speaker B: I'll cover it quickly because I do want it. I don't think it will be built for one particular reason, but insurance by default. If DeFi is going to work, I think we need to have insurance by default. When you're depositing an aave, when you're borrowing, when you're minting a dai, just give me insurance by default. Just wrap it in there. But I do think it needs to be an uncorrelated off chain player for it. The issue with insurance, historically, crypto has been scaled because of the core and on chain solutions to struggle with correlation risk.
00:51:08.438 - 00:51:42.914, Speaker B: But I think at some point, maybe not this year, it's going to be a big opportunity to build an insurance. It's primed for that because you have a lot of data on chain for an actuary that is a Sam Saban to underwrite the risk. But the problem is that the premium economically doesn't work now and Defi yields are lower than treasuries. It does work when you're farming a 20% APY and you can clip a 5% premium on that. And so the net yield is 15, doesn't work when it's like 2% and treasuries are five. Just will not. The risk is you cannot make this business work today.
00:51:42.914 - 00:51:44.874, Speaker B: It's just wishful thinking.
00:51:45.794 - 00:51:51.466, Speaker A: So I said baked in insurance. So there you go. Boom. We got one.
00:51:51.610 - 00:51:53.162, Speaker B: For what is worth, we did not share.
00:51:53.218 - 00:52:00.386, Speaker A: I was waiting. All right, Santi, what's the best investment you made? Time or money this year?
00:52:00.570 - 00:52:48.612, Speaker B: Last year, really thinking critically about time, my time, where I spend my time, like, freeing up a lot of my calendar to be able to have as much open time to think or try to think. No, I mean, because I came off of, like, defi summer and, you know, I just sometimes I, like, I took time to travel and I had the opportunity to go to Africa. And for me, it's like, really interesting. Like, animals rest, like 80, 90% of the time, and. And I think they. And then that 10% where they go hunting, they really, like, go balls to the wall. And I think that I took a lot of learnings from that in terms of there are times where you just need a rest.
00:52:48.612 - 00:53:11.324, Speaker B: You just need to kind of observe. And I think that I had an intuitive feeling that, you know, the year was just going to be for me. It was just I wanted to take time to reflect. I was also. I mean, I was very active, still investing in an early stage, but I think with a more open mindset of just observing. I think 2023 is going to be that for me as well. Look, if you're playing every poker hand, it's the surest way to lose.
00:53:11.324 - 00:53:50.274, Speaker B: And it's difficult because as a type a person, you always feel that compelled to do more. And if you're not, you feel like this fear of slowing down. There's a great quote on Phil Knight and shoe dog which says we run because the fear of stopping is just unbearable. And you never want to feel not relevant. And this industry moves so quickly. And so for once, I think I allowed myself to, yes, like, still, I think be involved, but at the same time, in how I became involved, I think changed in terms of, yes, I'm still investing, but just observing. And a big part of that, which I'm cheating here because I'm moving into another question, because the best thing I did was this podcast.
00:53:50.274 - 00:54:32.112, Speaker B: And for me, the way to express what I think is still feel relevant in this industry. As I left paraphy from like an fund into just what am I going to do? I think for me, it was just this podcast is the most important thing that I've done because I think education is what's missing in this industry as unbiased, elevating the discourse of discussion is super important. And it was just when I say, I don't think I would have been able to feel comfortable taking time off, if you will, had I not been doing this podcast weekend, week out, was.
00:54:32.128 - 00:54:34.844, Speaker A: That your best business decision of 2022?
00:54:36.064 - 00:54:43.824, Speaker B: Personal? Yeah. Like, was it the best return? No, I have another one, but, you know, I mean, like, but roi my time. Absolutely.
00:54:43.984 - 00:55:03.606, Speaker A: I like that. I have such a pretty deep answer. I have a less deep answer. My best investment, my best investment, I took it pretty literally, was of all the angel deals I did, only one was non crypto, and it is the bet. It is a company called Beehive, which is. It's built by the. It's built by.
00:55:03.606 - 00:55:25.978, Speaker A: It's a newsletter company. So they're taking on basically the newsletter space, like a blockworks, for example. I think we've used, like, seven different email providers, like Sendgrid and Mailchimp. And we tried to use campaign monitor, but they wouldn't let us because we're a crypto company. We got kicked off Mailchimp because we're a crypto company. The newsletter landscape is just a nightmare. It's these really old companies, but it's a super important thing.
00:55:25.978 - 00:56:05.874, Speaker A: The newsletter is the backbone of a lot of media companies. So the guy who ran the tech team at Morning Brew, this guy, Tyler Dank, left Morning Brew and started a newsletter platform built for the modern age media company. And they're just crushing it easily, like unicorn company and more. They're going to do incredibly well, and they already are. So my best investment was my only non crypto investment of the year. My worst investment was probably my worst investment was also probably the worst business decision of the year. Those are two of the same things.
00:56:05.874 - 00:56:34.382, Speaker A: Worst investment, personally, was I held onto a bag of FTT tokens and just, like, never got around to selling it. So, you know, that's a, that's a nice zero. Um, and then the worst businesses decision of the year. Um, well, I have a kind of jokey answer and then a more real answer. The jokey answer is we got paid by Lou Luna. Luna was going to sponsor for missionless, and we got paid in USt, and the peg broke, and we, you know, Mike and I were talking. I think it was down to 80.
00:56:34.478 - 00:56:36.834, Speaker B: But he sold at 80, right, or something.
00:56:37.694 - 00:56:57.394, Speaker A: I forget the actual, like, what, what it was, but we were like, we'll wait for the price to go back up to, like, 90 or 95 or something. And then we just, we didn't sell it at 90 or 95. So, like, that. That was a bummer. That was a bummer to have that happen. But also, it was big learning for us. We ended up hiring a director of finance, and we put these, like, we really got that process into shape.
00:56:57.394 - 00:57:10.040, Speaker A: So that was good. I think the other worst business decision was, like, chasing people to work at blockworks who have big logos on their resume did not, does not usually work out. Yeah.
00:57:10.112 - 00:57:13.044, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that's true. Yeah.
00:57:15.184 - 00:57:19.344, Speaker A: What about you? What about. What was your worst investment? Time or.
00:57:19.384 - 00:57:57.294, Speaker B: Well, time or money for, in terms of an investment, a hard investment? It was certainly in crypto. There was a few, two deals that I won't name, but two deals that weren't renegotiated. And as an angel, a lot of times, you know, the fund negotiates a term sheet with a fund, and then they close, like one or two months later or so. There was a big, very, like, violent shift in the market in March, and the deal, there was two deals that I closed in the summer where I said, guys, the market's just not there. Like, you're. This shouldn't be priced at 50 million or 75 million. It's like 20.
00:57:57.294 - 00:58:36.248, Speaker B: I'm gonna say, guys, it's probably better off that you like, while the lead doesn't want to renegotiate. And is it going to be a good investment? Maybe. I mean, maybe not. Depends largely on what the team does. But I think that I just look back and personally, I kick myself because it's part of a bigger trend that I want to continue to do more, which is just say no as opposed to, like, and back out. And the issue there was, you know, I developed a good relationship with the team before we closed, and, you know, they kind of pushed me harder to still go through. And I said, okay, fine, I lower my check size.
00:58:36.248 - 00:59:06.476, Speaker B: But then it's like, no. Like, if I don't feel the conviction I have a minimum check size, I'm not going to do it. And so, you know, it was, I think those two, personally, I want to get better at just saying no. And I think, you know, it's a snapshot. So it's difficult to say that they're not going to be good investments on paper, but certainly entry point sort of is one of the more, if not the most important thing. So entering at 75 million is a very different valuation than at, like 20. Night and day.
00:59:06.620 - 00:59:13.704, Speaker A: Great. Night and day. Yeah. What's the takeaway from that?
00:59:14.404 - 00:59:15.516, Speaker B: Just say no.
00:59:15.700 - 00:59:17.452, Speaker A: Yeah, I like that.
00:59:17.628 - 00:59:36.964, Speaker B: There's always these times you feel it and then you drag your feet, and then there's all these other things of, like, you know, met trying to manage reputation, what they're gonna think, and, you know, it's important, right? Reputation. No one says they don't care about what other people think is just delusional. In a game of investing. It's important, but still. Yeah.
00:59:37.304 - 00:59:42.404, Speaker A: Best business decision of 2022. Time or money? Or is that the empire answer?
00:59:42.824 - 00:59:59.296, Speaker B: It is empire. I'll say another. Which was diversifying real estate and other assets. Like, you mean a meaningful way? I'd done it before, but now, like, in a more meaningful, substantial way. And so I think I'm experiment with real estate. I like it, and I think for me, it's just now.
00:59:59.320 - 01:00:08.216, Speaker A: Do you mean like, buying real estate trusts, for example? Are you, like, buying homes, renting them out, and passive income, like a direct.
01:00:08.280 - 01:00:49.670, Speaker B: Portfolio, and trying to spin up what I think could work of capturing a nice clipping, a nice yield, and manage, like, not me doing it, but, like, setting up a team to, like, manage a property, rent it out. And I'm kind of excited to see that project go through. It's not taking. My biggest fear was it's gonna take a lot of my time, but I found a way to that it wouldn't. And just, I spend more of my time thinking, okay, where can I get the highest cap rate? Like, what are some of the places that could be good? Rental properties. And I'm excited going into this year, because I think we're in that environment where a lot of people might be able to, like, might want to let go of properties because they're underwater mortgages. Payments are really high, and so, yeah, I just like real estate.
01:00:49.862 - 01:01:32.788, Speaker A: Yeah, there you go. I have a couple of friends who got really deep into real estate this year, and I think the key is not. Is less about, like, the price you pay and more about, are you able to get yourself out of, like, the rental process and create a real source of passive income? So my best business decision of the year was finally building a leadership team, I think, at blockworks, and surrendering control to people who are just way smarter than I am. So, like, if. If we look back, if we look back at this time last year, we didn't really have a, whatever you want to call it, like a leadership team and exec team. Um, now, going into 2023, we have a. We have a CTo, we have an editor in chief, we have an amazing coo.
01:01:32.788 - 01:01:52.358, Speaker A: We have a director of finance, we have a director of people who starts next week. We have a vp of marketing. Um, I really hope I'm not forgiving someone, but, uh, we have a leadership team. Right. That's baked out, and it's allowed me to kind of take one step back and honestly, all of them are much smarter than I am, so. And, like, better at what they do. So that was a.
01:01:52.358 - 01:01:59.582, Speaker A: Finally doing that after five years of blockworks was a good decision. Most helpful thing you started doing in.
01:01:59.598 - 01:02:32.224, Speaker B: 2022 and why people not, no surprise, podcasting. By far, Empire. Like, it is for me that one of the more most rewarding things is have people come up and say, you know, I really enjoyed that podcast. It allowed me to do X or Y or open my eyes to this, and, or I do this. This is like my weekly Saturday or Sunday running routine or grabbing coffee. And, yeah, it's very wholesome to just feel like, you know, I hope that this has been helpful for people. You know, we're not trying to dispense investment advice, telling you to buy ether or TikTok with investment.
01:02:32.224 - 01:02:48.734, Speaker B: Sometimes people want to hear that we're not going to do that. But, yeah, it's, it's really rewarding. Uh, it's this idea of, like, you know, feeling relevant, uh, but also feeling like you're having an impact. Um, and, yeah, it's been, for me, really rewarding.
01:02:49.154 - 01:02:54.538, Speaker A: Well, now I feel bad if my answer is not empire, but it's not. It's, uh. I also love empire, but, um.
01:02:54.586 - 01:02:55.538, Speaker B: You got married.
01:02:55.666 - 01:03:01.330, Speaker A: I got, like, that should have been mine. That definitely edit this out.
01:03:01.362 - 01:03:10.192, Speaker B: No problem. But, yeah, I know it's, listen, listen. Other than getting married, other. Yeah, safe face.
01:03:10.328 - 01:03:46.232, Speaker A: No, mine was actually getting a trainer in last year, so I haven't, like, you know, I've always taken my health seriously, but, like, I never, I haven't lifted, like, heavy weights in like, a decade. I've kind of a bad back. Like, I just, like, thought it wasn't really that good for you. I got a trainer, and he's really pushed me to, like, as kind of obnoxious and, like, douchey as this sounds, like, lift heavy. And, um, it's just been the best thing for my back, for my mood, for, like, personal health. It's been, yeah, I feel better than I've ever felt. And so I think what originally seemed like a really expensive investment has paid, paid a lot.
01:03:46.232 - 01:03:58.556, Speaker A: Paid a lot of. So, yeah, getting a trainer. Um, all right, we got a couple fun ones that are a little more personal. Like, best habit you picked up. Worst habit you picked up. You know, you want to throw yours out there.
01:03:58.740 - 01:04:24.434, Speaker B: Yeah, best habit. I used to be, like, I stopped running for a while, and I just did weights. I started running yet again, a push. A friend of mine pushed me to, like, do the New York marathon and I became. So I'm running now like six days a week, have a, have a coach because I'm running three marathons this year. I'm running London, Berlin and New York. So, yeah, running for me is walk, is meta, is so meditating.
01:04:24.434 - 01:05:06.494, Speaker B: I mean, the feeling that I get, it's just very liberating. I run with music. I love music. But, yeah, it's, you know, the idea of consistently training and also, like, learning how to train has been also really cool. Like, this 80% rule which was adopted by, like, people started understanding, like, people started wonder why, like, the, like, russian wrestlers vastly, like, outperformed and beat us wrestling team in the Olympics was because they, they have this 80% training rule, which is you never want to train to 100% of your effort. It's always 80%. And that allows you to, one, minimize injury and train every other day, like, consistently.
01:05:06.494 - 01:05:38.604, Speaker B: And the power of compounding, you know, you don't get injured as much. And when you show up to rate, it's only like two, three weeks before a competition when you really push it hard. But, you know, whereas a us athlete would have been training for like, you know, 100, 120 days a week. Sorry, a year, the russian athletes would have been training for like 320 or so. So it's, it's really. Yeah, it's been kind of a nice process to, to pick back up because I'd missed, like, just running every, every day. Every other day.
01:05:38.724 - 01:06:05.168, Speaker A: That's great. Best habit that I picked up or that I continued was I don't sleep with my phone in the bedroom. And that's been really nice. I sleep with my phone in my office, which, so that when my alarm goes off, I literally have to walk downstairs and get my phone so I don't snooze. So that's been nice. And then also, I don't look at my phone in the morning until. I don't look at my phone in the morning until after I've come back from a morning walk, which is also.
01:06:05.168 - 01:06:10.416, Speaker A: So it's like, I kind of get like an hour before bed and an hour in the morning without a phone. And that's been really nice.
01:06:10.480 - 01:06:10.680, Speaker B: So.
01:06:10.712 - 01:06:29.592, Speaker A: So, um, also started listening to the, like, Andrew Huberman podcast, like bits and pieces, like health guy. Um, yeah, that's great. And he recommends. Yeah, exactly. They, they both recommend this thing, like, sunlight first thing in the morning. And I don't know how much of it is real, but I do that, like, the first thing in the morning is I walk out, get some sunlight, and that's been really helpful. I like that.
01:06:29.592 - 01:06:56.782, Speaker A: So, worst habit I picked up is I just. I found myself watching a lot of tv now. Like, basically every night I've stopped. I don't read because I'm honestly, like, white from the day, and, you know, maybe 10, 10 30, I'll get into bed or something, and instead of reading a book, I'll just, like, I'll throw on tv. It's great. I rip through. I watch friends, and I'm watching the office, so I'm like, I've never watched tv.
01:06:56.782 - 01:07:14.954, Speaker A: I've never been, like, a tv person. Never. So, like, honestly, all these. Michael, Michael, throw out all these, like, jokes, cultural references. They're like jokes from the office and jokes from friends right over my head. So the best thing about this habit is I now finally understand Mike's understand Mike's cultural references. The bad thing is watching a shit ton of tv.
01:07:15.034 - 01:07:17.854, Speaker B: So, hey, well, it's not necessarily that bad.
01:07:18.674 - 01:07:19.734, Speaker A: Give any bad.
01:07:20.994 - 01:07:26.562, Speaker B: I mean, I was thinking about this a lot. Like, I do have things that are, like, I chew gum a lot. Like, I like it.
01:07:26.578 - 01:07:30.354, Speaker A: Like, that's your worst habits on t. I think you're doing pretty my worst habit.
01:07:30.434 - 01:07:46.490, Speaker B: But, like, you know, it's like, you know, like a baseball coach. Like, when they're on tv, they have, like, a massive, like, I don't know if they're chewing tobacco or gum, but I'm not, like, particularly proud of this habit. I don't know, man. Like, I. I tend to like, yeah, what are you gonna say?
01:07:46.562 - 01:07:57.754, Speaker A: Oh, I was gonna. That actually reminded me. I chew a ridiculous amount of sunflower seeds, so I go through. I used to go through a big pack of David sunflower seeds a day, which is in.
01:07:57.794 - 01:07:58.178, Speaker B: Wow.
01:07:58.266 - 01:08:13.644, Speaker A: Which is a horrible amount of salt. And so I bought raw sun. I bought sunflower seeds, like, a five or ten pound pack of them. And I've been playing around with making my own sunflower seeds. They don't taste nearly as good as ranch sunflower seeds, but that's been. Been trying to cut that habit.
01:08:13.684 - 01:08:16.716, Speaker B: Ranch. Ranch sunflower seeds, dude, they're so good.
01:08:16.780 - 01:08:25.271, Speaker A: They're so good. All right, favorite recurring. Favorite recurring content of 2022 or favorite individual content? What's. Tell me some content you liked.
01:08:25.427 - 01:08:43.895, Speaker B: Talking about. Newsletters. There's one called the Diff. Like, the difference, the diff. It's a newsletter covering inflections in finance and tech. We'll link it in the show notes. Really insightful pieces, like, just quirky, like, topics and it's one of those newsletters.
01:08:43.895 - 01:08:59.983, Speaker B: I was looking back, I get a lot of newsletters delivered in the mail, but this one I deliver on Sunday. I open it, I read it religiously. So it's really insightful. And so kudos to whoever does it. I think it's one of the best newsletters, or at least that I've enjoyed.
01:09:00.883 - 01:09:23.424, Speaker A: I have a couple of newsletters I really like and a couple of podcasts. Podcasts. I think a lot of people started listening to the all in podcasts with Sachs and Chamath and those guys. I like that one. I pledge Allegiance podcast is my favorite non blockworks podcast. It's a crypto show by the reverie team, Jacob Donnelly, head of B two B at Morning brew B two B Media. He writes a media newsletter that I like.
01:09:23.424 - 01:09:48.420, Speaker A: And then also just my favorite, like, five bullet points on the news for the day is a newsletter called News Items by John Ellis. What is it? John Ellis? It's like 200 followers on Twitter. But found this guy got recommended and I like it a lot. Favorite individual piece of content was this Graham Duncan piece. Graham Duncan said, I think he runs a hedge fund. It was about being a time billionaire. And we'll link it in the show notes.
01:09:48.420 - 01:10:33.568, Speaker A: But basically, the idea is, like, Tyler Cohen has this thing about cultural billionaires, right? In culture, we're so obsessed as a culture with, like, money. We, like, defy these, like, dollar billionaires in that way. Graham Duncan kind of co opted that term. And he's like, I think about billionaires of time. He's like, when I was thinking about time billionaires, it's when I see sometimes, like a 20 year old, the thought is that they have like 2 billion second of their life left, right? A million seconds is eleven days, a billion seconds is 31 years. Right? So 31 years, billion seconds, eleven days, million seconds. And so it's like, you know, if you could go to Rupert Murdoch, I think is the example Graham Duncan uses, who's worth, I don't know, 20 or $25 billion? He's 87 years old.
01:10:33.568 - 01:10:50.902, Speaker A: What would he pay if he could take the next five years of someone's 20 year old healthy body and healthy mind, right? What, what. What price would they pay? Um, yeah. And he explains, he's like, my. He's like, as I've gotten older, my pricing has gone completely exponential and has gone completely vertical. Um, Hazel's just gone to the record.
01:10:50.958 - 01:10:52.974, Speaker B: Saying, like, he would pay billions and give up.
01:10:53.014 - 01:10:54.134, Speaker A: Yeah. That made me think about time.
01:10:54.214 - 01:11:28.822, Speaker B: So back 20 years. Yeah. I mean, on this point alone, like, I do think it's like very refreshing. I know taking a step aside for a bit. Like as we talk about like what was your best investment and predictions and like look back in the year, like it's been a tough year for most and I just remind myself of like this. You talked about a funny thing which has equinox shut down all like, all like new descriptions on the first of the year because the people that probably are not going to commit in churn, I think it was you or someone else that said that. I think it's like I don't kind of like this idea where like people like for the first three weeks say happy new year and like set these goals.
01:11:28.822 - 01:11:55.654, Speaker B: And I just feel that like you just have to do something and like the power of compounding, like doing small incremental things that may not feel massive or super rewarding at once will really, really compound over time. And like I tend to think of like, okay, how many more? Let me ask a question. How many more years are you going to have to build blockworks or in your productive life to continue to be an angel investor? How many more years do you think you're going to have?
01:11:56.874 - 01:11:57.738, Speaker A: A lot.
01:11:57.906 - 01:11:59.442, Speaker B: 30 plus.
01:11:59.578 - 01:12:00.450, Speaker A: Yeah, hopefully.
01:12:00.482 - 01:12:01.170, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:12:01.362 - 01:12:03.494, Speaker A: And so it's like more than 30?
01:12:03.794 - 01:12:23.710, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. You know, I mean, like, and so it's like, I think it's a big part of what Eric says and all these things come together which is like your reputation is the most important thing. Like, you know, keep your head down, build, don't get too ahead of, you know, narratives or get carried away with stuff and just do the right thing over and over again. And I think that will like massively show up over three, four years.
01:12:23.842 - 01:12:26.834, Speaker A: What, uh, any favorite individual content for you?
01:12:27.534 - 01:12:36.846, Speaker B: Definitely. It was uh, this sone sand conference, uh, where John Collison, the, one of the stripe co founders, interviewed Stan Druckenmiller.
01:12:36.870 - 01:12:38.814, Speaker A: Oh, Druckenmiller. Such a good chat.
01:12:38.894 - 01:13:11.394, Speaker B: Yeah, it was, it was such a great conversation. And it was right around the summertime, I think it was June, mid June where I listened to it. And for me it was seeing someone of his caliber come out and say, hey, we're living in unprecedented times. Like, I'm not. And hearing also his history of how he's dealt historically with ups and downs in his professional career and, you know, investing was just really eye opening. It was great to hear his perspective so highly. Encourage folks to go and listen to that.
01:13:12.534 - 01:13:33.284, Speaker A: Druckenmiller has probably, probably had the best predictions of the last two years. He, like, he nailed the inflation take. He nailed what's happened with commodities. He nailed impending recession. He nailed big layoffs coming to big tech. He nailed, I mean, if you listen to. If you listen to only Druckenmiller and just took his trades and he publicly shared his trades, too.
01:13:33.284 - 01:13:36.560, Speaker A: Yeah, he crushed it. Yeah.
01:13:36.592 - 01:13:45.146, Speaker B: I think they went to a lot of cash in the summer and said, I just don't know what's happening in the world. So I'm not trying to be hero and. And have largely kind of adopted that thinking.
01:13:45.330 - 01:13:52.454, Speaker A: Yep. Yeah. That was a great chat. If you had to leave crypto today, Santi, what would you work on?
01:13:53.034 - 01:14:54.454, Speaker B: It's an interesting question, because there have been times over the last, like, God, I don't know how many years I've thought about this, and I do have a very clear answer. And it would be working on sequencing the microbiome, starting a company to do it, meaning, like, if people remember, we sequenced it like DNA, like Craig Venter. And there was a government that also was working on it. And I think it was like, a really impactful milestone to then, like, develop drugs and, like, medications and cures for a lot of things, like CRISPR and modifying DNA to solve, like rare diseases. I'm of the mind that. So the microbiome is much more complex because you have way more bacteria in your gut than you have DNA. So largely is a computational problem, which I think coincides nicely with where we are in terms of quantum and the ability to process massive reams of data.
01:14:54.454 - 01:15:57.326, Speaker B: And I've had this idea when I was working at a health startup, like researching aging. It was actually during the last bear market, and a lot of the best scientists I got to know, because we were also working on the microbiome is kind of a key hallmark of aging and how your body kind of absorbs nutrients. And I think a lot of the unsolved medical mysteries will be unlocked when we further understand the microbiome and sequence it. Because once you sequence it, then you start saying, okay, give me a correlation of, like, how does microbiome look for people that have developed cancer or obesity or some other type of disease, like irritable bowel syndrome? And I think most of your nutrient absorption happens in the microbiome. And so if there is deficiency there, I think it has a whole downstream effects and second order effects into your broader health and how we age and any sort of disease that you might develop further down the line. And. And so I think that's like a big puzzle that remains unsolved.
01:15:57.326 - 01:16:26.904, Speaker B: And I. Look, I'm not a scientist, so, you know, people may correct me, but it's an area that I've been fascinated with that in nuclear. But I think for me, like, microbiome is really interesting field. And, you know, in many ways, it's a coordination problem because the NHS, like, in the US, you know, doesn't really fund, you know, I was. I was. There was, like, 14 Nobel laureates on the board of this company, and, like, they don't really get a lot of funding. There's so many topics that they just shelf because they don't get.
01:16:26.904 - 01:16:54.032, Speaker B: And the incentives are kind of screwed and, yeah, I just wish, like, I think it takes a hundred million dollars to, like, sequence a microbiome, and you basically have to, like, collect stool samples from every single kind of, like, culture and, like. And just, like, map out, like, what does a normal microbiome look like? How does that inform what you eat and. And your. Your uptake to different kinds of diet and medication? So, yeah, it's like, I'm fascinated by this.
01:16:54.088 - 01:16:59.472, Speaker A: You're basically dedicating the next ten years of your life to dealing with a lot of shit, so good luck.
01:16:59.648 - 01:17:04.912, Speaker B: Which basically sounds a lot like crypto anyway, so it's basically not going to collect, like, actual shit.
01:17:05.088 - 01:17:06.672, Speaker A: Yeah. People trading shit coins.
01:17:06.728 - 01:17:08.564, Speaker B: I'm gonna go and, like, you know, collect.
01:17:10.504 - 01:17:13.040, Speaker A: I think that's a good one. It's funny, actually.
01:17:13.112 - 01:17:14.204, Speaker B: What was your question?
01:17:14.704 - 01:17:34.672, Speaker A: Well, it's funny even thinking about this question. I remember in 20, the 2019, like, the heart of the bear market, Mike and I having a couple of beers and being like, you know, this whole crypto thing doesn't work out. Like, what should we do? I think I was like. I think. I think Mike was like, I'd want to go work at Netflix. I forget what I said. I think I was like, I'd probably start something.
01:17:34.672 - 01:17:59.214, Speaker A: I forget the answers. But, um, it's like, I like, in this, it's just interesting seeing our mindsets two years later, three. Excuse me, three years later, four years later. I've never once had that thought. The thought of if crypto works or not. It's just interesting. That bear market, a lot of people were like, if this whole crypto thing doesn't work out, even people like myself who had started a company in the industry, and now nobody even asked that question.
01:17:59.214 - 01:18:32.732, Speaker A: And I've never once. It was funny trying to think of, what would I go do? Because I'm like, well, I wouldn't not work in crypto. There's no, I think if you understand risk reward today you work in crypto. Like, there's no, like, there's no other industry I would want to work in. So that, like, it was interesting thing about this. That being said, I do have. I do have an answer to this, which is basically there are some big topics that haven't caught on and haven't gone mainstream simply because the narrative is in the wrong, is not in their favorite.
01:18:32.732 - 01:18:45.036, Speaker A: And I think the two big ones right now are, like, probably psychedelics and nuclear. So nuclear. Like, the narrative around nuclear is that it's unsafe, but when you actually look at the facts, nuclear is just a better source of energy.
01:18:45.220 - 01:18:47.292, Speaker B: And John Wolf episode.
01:18:47.468 - 01:19:20.022, Speaker A: Yeah, it's like psychedelics, too. It's like the facts show that psychedelics are. Can, in certain scenarios, be really good for you and a better replacement than a replacement to or at least a second option or an alternative to some mainstream, like, prescriptions, but the narrative is incredibly against them. Now, I think that's changing quickly, but. So I'd probably do something there because I think. Yeah, I think that's interesting. Something around personal health would be super interesting, too, but I think those are complete money losing businesses.
01:19:20.022 - 01:19:28.978, Speaker A: And it's, like, not really in my DNA to go start a company that doesn't make money for 20 years. I think I'd have. So there's a couple things that you.
01:19:28.986 - 01:20:00.854, Speaker B: Just said that are really cool. Just commenting briefly on, I think working in crypto and being a part of the industry really gives you a very strong appreciation for narrative formation and the importance of narratives. And, yeah, I do agree with you. Like, for folks listening, we touched on this, like, just recently on, like, you have, like, how many more years is billionaire? Like, time, billion time concept? You know, it's. For me, it was like, okay, where. What? I don't know. Like, people might be listening.
01:20:00.854 - 01:20:21.222, Speaker B: They're much older, but, like, if you're young, you just graduated. Like, there arguably isn't a better time in your life to take, like, outsized, asymmetric risk, whether it's nuclear, whatever. And it's just, like, very refreshing. Like, what's your downside and what's the potential upside? Downside is time. But, yeah, it's like a good way to frame it as you just.
01:20:21.278 - 01:20:56.426, Speaker A: I think that if anyone my age under, like, this is going to sound really annoying. I was going to say, if you understand risk reward today you work in crypto, you should work in crypto. The majority of people, I think now there are other things, like nuclear psychedelics. There are some big advancements in healthcare probably that need to get worked on, but pushing a pixel web two has basically become pushing pixels around and optimizing a landing page from a 9.8% conversion to, like, a 9.9% conversion. Like, that's what the SaaS industry entails.
01:20:56.426 - 01:21:06.506, Speaker A: Now. Ten years ago, like, go change the world. Go build SaaS companies. But now, if you work at one of those companies, you're optimizing a conversion rate from, like, 9.8 to 9.9.
01:21:06.570 - 01:21:35.084, Speaker B: So, yeah, by the way, one last thing there. One last thing there is what you're saying is super important. Like, there is this idea of much less existential risk in the industry. Yet again, we're seeing prices that we saw in the last cycle where there was existential risk. So the industry feels to me much more derisked and clearer verticals and use cases with traction behind them. And so this is why I think it's super exciting. Like, the optimistic, the industry is so.
01:21:35.124 - 01:22:15.184, Speaker A: Much more derisked this time around. It's funny, we have our company offsite in a week, and it's like, Mike and I always put together the opening deck, I think, for the company. We do an hour, two hour kickoff, and we always talk about, like, where the, like, our, like, state of the union, like, where's the industry at? And, um, it's just funny because, like, I just, even though there are, like, we have a lot of new employees and people who have maybe just come into the industry, but, like, and in their minds, it's like, holy crap, like, what did I just get myself into? Like, and in my mind, like, the industry is so de risked right now. It's so, it's such a no brainer, and I'm so confident that things are, will return. So, anyways, favorite app or product that you started using last year?
01:22:16.044 - 01:22:23.628, Speaker B: I went back to reading the newspaper, particularly the Financial Times. Like, I just went back to, I love that.
01:22:23.676 - 01:22:24.308, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:22:24.476 - 01:22:58.920, Speaker B: You know, like, there's something you start the day and you get, like, sunlight. For me, it just became a nice habit of waking up, reading the newspaper, and, like, drinking coffee. And I think the Financial Times has some pretty interesting, like, I think it's one of the best, if not the best newspaper out there. They have great editorialists like Jillian Tett and a few others. A few others that are not so good too, that are just, like, constantly, like, having these very negative takes on crypto that are not very balanced. But, yeah, it's just good too. I religiously kind of read the paper each morning.
01:22:58.920 - 01:22:59.924, Speaker B: How about you?
01:23:00.784 - 01:23:33.938, Speaker A: I started using an app called Clay. It's like a personal CRM, but I've used. I've always wanted a personal CRM that actually worked. But the problem with every personal CRM in the past is, like, whether or not you build it in yourself or in, like, a notion or something like that, or like it, or just, like, there's a software that's built for it. They never work, I think, because they're not auto populated with your existing network. You have to be like, all right, I talked to Santiago today, and, like, let me input my notes. Clay pulls in all your information from everywhere.
01:23:33.938 - 01:23:55.856, Speaker A: So it pulls in your. Like, it pulls in everything. Like, every message I send anywhere, like, it pulls into clay, basically, and Clay will be like, all right, like, you haven't, like, hit up this person in a while. Like, but it seems like you used to, like, really engage with them, and it's actually. It's been really helpful. And it's really helpful. Like, if I'll go to dinner with someone, and then I go to dinner with them, like, six months later, I'm like, damn.
01:23:55.856 - 01:24:23.980, Speaker A: Like, I don't remember what we talked about at all, but I know we had a great conversation. It's helpful to go back to that. It's also helpful to be like, if you go to a new city, it auto pop. You can just type in, like, media people in media people in Austin, Texas, and it'll be like, you have 14. You have 14 media people in Austin, Texas, in your network, and like, oh, crap. I didn't realize this person lives there. So, like, I went to London for a week in 2022 and was like, crypto people in London.
01:24:23.980 - 01:24:31.412, Speaker A: I was like, oh, my God. I didn't realize. I totally forgot. Stani is in London. Like, let me hit up Stani. And it just pulled that in. So, yeah, I like it.
01:24:31.468 - 01:24:31.988, Speaker B: That's great.
01:24:32.076 - 01:24:37.384, Speaker A: That's really cool. Clay Dream podcast guests for Empire this year.
01:24:37.724 - 01:24:38.984, Speaker B: I should go first.
01:24:39.804 - 01:25:02.638, Speaker A: Why don't I go first? I have. I think I have lame answers. I think I have lame answers because there are people I really want to talk to, but then they also have to tie into crypto. Marc Andreessen is one of them. Either Mark Andreessen or Ben Horowitz, either one of them. I'd really like to have on the podcast. I have a cz I would like to have on the podcast.
01:25:02.638 - 01:25:32.210, Speaker A: I'd like to, like. There are some questions I have for CZ, and I want to get his take on them. I've always wanted to have wences Casaris, who started Zappo. He's, like, not a big name at all. I doubt the episode would get many downloads, but, like, I just, for me, yeah, I just respect the hell out of him. He's one of the early people who got me, like, convinced that bitcoin's a real thing. I heard him one time, I went to a JPMorgan event, probably 75 people in the room, and they brought him to speak.
01:25:32.210 - 01:26:01.624, Speaker A: This was two years ago, probably. And he has the most articulate vision for bitcoin that I've ever heard. And I know that. I think the industry and we're all getting pretty pro ETH people are getting sick of bitcoins, probably because the bitcoin Maxi crowd. I would love to have a bitcoin conversation with wences, probably something similar with Jack Dorsey. I'd love to have Jack on the show just because he's, like, very bitcoin Maxi, but also, like, I respect the hell out of what he's built. I'd also love to get his take on what Elon's doing with Twitter.
01:26:01.624 - 01:26:14.740, Speaker A: Barry Silbert is another one that came to mind, like, especially right now. So, yeah, those are some of the names, but I'm not, like, I feel like I'm not. I didn't love my answers for that. So what do you think?
01:26:14.892 - 01:26:40.074, Speaker B: I didn't love my answer to this question, too. It ties back to my favorite piece of content. I would love to have Stan druck Miller in the pod, getting his refreshed takes on the year on the industry and just reflecting on since his, since I last saw his podcast. And the other one was Elon. Like, I just. I'm curious to talk to him about his strategy in Twitter. Maybe we could have it.
01:26:40.074 - 01:26:58.614, Speaker B: The ideal would be Elon and Jack in a pod to see how they just talk about and agree, disagree and dream big, baby. Yeah, that would be, that would be nice. The ones that you said are also really, really good, so I don't think they're lame, but, yeah.
01:26:59.154 - 01:27:11.066, Speaker A: What are your business goals for the year? Or actually, if you. If you can help us land any of those podcast guests, Santi and I are flying you out. We're taking you to dinner. Dinner?
01:27:11.130 - 01:27:12.578, Speaker B: Actually, yes.
01:27:12.626 - 01:27:18.274, Speaker A: Land one of those people you want to start with. Business goals for the year or personal goals? These are our last two topics.
01:27:19.214 - 01:27:20.754, Speaker B: Let's go business and personal.
01:27:21.134 - 01:27:21.742, Speaker A: All right.
01:27:21.838 - 01:28:06.442, Speaker B: Started off, so you said two to three business goals for the year. The first one is I want to turn Empire into the number one podcast, first with crypto and then just generally investing. This year, I think just in crypto, I do want it to be the go to. The, when people think of the go to for getting high quality as unbiased kind of crypto knowledge and content, I want the empire to be synonymous with that. And so, yes, that is, I'm very committed to that because I think education is the most important thing missing in this industry where I can help. Like, I'm not a developer, like, I can't work on, like, zero knowledge proves, but I do think that we can. We have something going here, and I'd like to turn that into, and I see no reason why we can't.
01:28:06.442 - 01:28:38.292, Speaker B: So that's one. And the second one is really helping, particularly. My gaming portfolio kind of really launched this year. I did a lot of work last year with a few of them step in Luvium and others. And I want to continue to do that because I just think that gaming is really going to be this email moment of this industry where it just dispels. It's like, here you go, guys, like, there we go. We have a mill, like this lifestyle app or gaming app that just blows people's minds off.
01:28:38.292 - 01:29:24.564, Speaker B: And I think it's just gonna take, it's gonna take one or two games to really, like, you started seeing, like, inklings, like bored ape got a lot of traction. But the problem, the proposition that people need to shell out hundreds of thousands of dollars and the collections only 10,000, I struggle with that being that, that thing. But I feel like we're so close. I see it. I've been playing these games. Like, I'm seeing how these teams are building and I think it's going to happen in 2023 and I'm really excited for that. And I'm applying as much energy into that in helping these teams kind of, like, really go to market because I think it's going to be super impactful for the industry.
01:29:24.964 - 01:29:30.628, Speaker A: Hmm. I like those. I can get behind the Empire one, that's for sure.
01:29:30.716 - 01:29:31.944, Speaker B: Yeah, there we go.
01:29:32.684 - 01:30:08.676, Speaker A: I would, let's see, for, I mean, a couple block works goals for the year. Like, just continue building the leadership team. Like, would love to have a really, really, really strong leadership team that has ownership over every, like, core business line and department of block works. I'm really excited about that. Just like, you know, just, I end up learning, personally learning a lot from these people and just, yeah, love working with smart people and excited about that. I'm really excited to build blockworks brand in the Soliloquy Alpha league, but in the governance and grants space. So we have some stuff coming in, both governance and grants, and I think people will see more about that in the first half of this year.
01:30:08.676 - 01:30:39.104, Speaker A: And we're really as tough of a time as it is for Daos right now. We're incredibly optimistic about DAos. We've built a ton of stuff behind the scenes for Daos and for people who participate in daos, especially people who invest in daos. And we're launching a lot of that this year. And just, I want to build our brand in the governance and grant space because I don't think people kind of associate blockworks with that. So I think, and I think that's on me to push that ball up the hill. On that note, I want to get blockworks research really on the map.
01:30:39.104 - 01:31:20.784, Speaker A: Like somewhere between 50 to 100, probably closer to 100 paying companies and funds to our research platform. It's $2,500 a month, excuse me, 2500 bucks a year, which is like, such a wild, no, it's 75% cheaper than any of our competitors. It's such a no brainer to subscribe to it. And it's, again, just like, I don't think it's in front of the right people right now, and I think that's on me and some other folks on the team to, you know, if you. To basically push that ball up the hill and, and kickstart that flywheel, I mean, it's, it's $208 a month. If you can't make more than $208 a month reading our research and platform, like, you're probably in the wrong business. So that's, that's one goal.
01:31:20.784 - 01:31:42.284, Speaker A: I want to scale our podcast network right now. We have five podcasts internally. Like, we have five, like, internal, like, blockworks shows. Um, I want to double that to ten. I think there are some shows that are missing in the industry. Like, I don't want to actually leak too much alpha, but there's some, like, really clear podcasts that are missing. And I think podcasts can be this really nice flywheel.
01:31:42.284 - 01:32:05.704, Speaker A: If we have another large show, it ends up helping Empire. Empire can help launch it. It helps grow empire. I think that's a really fun thing. And then the last thing is just, we're going to host permissionless again. And I want to keep pushing, I think we push the bar on what's possible with conferences, and I just want to keep pushing the bar and build another world class crypto conference that's, uh, in Austin.
01:32:05.744 - 01:32:06.324, Speaker B: Right?
01:32:06.704 - 01:32:08.320, Speaker A: In Austin. This year. Yeah.
01:32:08.472 - 01:32:11.720, Speaker B: Nice. That's cool. Yeah, that's great.
01:32:11.912 - 01:32:15.488, Speaker A: Those are some goals, man. Um, all right, let's wrap it with personal.
01:32:15.656 - 01:32:34.694, Speaker B: Well, out of curiosity, just on this point, how big was block works in, like, 2020, 2021? Like, how much, what's, like, your most important KPI? Like, I'm curious how many people you've hired, like, this year? Like, 2022. And we started, like, the right metric.
01:32:36.354 - 01:33:01.236, Speaker A: I mean, how many people we've hired is not the right metric to look at, I'd say, because I think we've never raised any outside venture money. And so if you look at someone like, well, I won't name. There are other crypto media companies that I think will have, like, are pretty bloated right now. So on paper, they have too many people in my mind, but I won't name names. No. Like, our metrics are, like, that. I look at are, like, our total audience.
01:33:01.236 - 01:33:26.704, Speaker A: So, like, how many podcast downloads do we have across the network? How many newsletter subscribers do we have? Page views is really. Is also important. Page views is, like, a bad, it's like, not a perfect measure, but I look at it on the editorial side. I look at page views compared to our competitors, because, like, total page views goes down in a bear. So if you set page view targets, you'll probably be off, maybe content engagement.
01:33:26.744 - 01:33:27.760, Speaker B: Like, I don't know if you use, like.
01:33:27.832 - 01:33:55.966, Speaker A: Well, no, it's page views relative. It's our percentage of the market share that we own. So if you add. If you basically take our page views as the numerator, and then the denominator is, like, all the page views of, like, Coindesk plus the block, plus decrypt, and, like, our, our market share percentage. So that's one of the bigger company goals of the year, is, like, there's a current percent, and I want to increase that. Yeah. And then revenue matters, obviously.
01:33:55.966 - 01:34:00.954, Speaker A: Yeah, obviously. Yeah, yeah. Personal goals.
01:34:02.814 - 01:34:35.324, Speaker B: I want to link to something that I wrote, like, in the last bear market around, like, it's called the summit. I want to. It ties into one of my goals because I think of, like, setting the right intention. Goal setting could be tricky because I think it can lead you to. I don't know, I'm not a big fan of goal setting, but I do have, like, certain, I guess, concrete goals, if you will. One of them is running a sub 2 hours and 40 minutes maRathon. My PR is 247, and I want to go below 240 and then hopefully continue to progress.
01:34:35.324 - 01:34:46.736, Speaker B: So I'm kind of committed to that. I want to, I don't just want to break that and then maybe go down to 230. I'm going on the record, so if I don't do it, guys. Well, you know.
01:34:46.760 - 01:34:49.644, Speaker A: All right. Look at you. I'll try.
01:34:50.304 - 01:35:07.240, Speaker B: I'll try. Yeah. I'm having a lot of look, as is, I'm having a lot of fun running. That's one of the best things I started doing again this year. And, you know, whether I break it or not, but I'll give it a good shot. The second one, I really want to go to New Zealand. It's one of the few places I haven't been to.
01:35:07.240 - 01:35:22.160, Speaker B: And I. I want to go to the scene where they filmed Lord of the Rings and, like, the Milford Sound. And I just think it's, like, an incredible country. I haven't been able to do that because of COVID Like, they shut down. And Australia, too. Like, I want to do Australia. New Zealand.
01:35:22.160 - 01:35:25.456, Speaker B: I haven't figured out what the best way to do it is. Like, should it?
01:35:25.600 - 01:35:25.856, Speaker A: But.
01:35:25.880 - 01:35:50.620, Speaker B: So, yeah, well, like, I've invested a lot of projects in Australia, and maybe illusion does, like, a festival conference there this year, so I'll definitely kind of do that in tandem. But, yeah, I. I want to. I want to go there probably November, December, where it's summer there. And the last one is, I want to go back to long form writing. I have a blog which I haven't. Haven't published nothing.
01:35:50.620 - 01:36:12.282, Speaker B: Like, I haven't published new entries. I write some things I never publish. I've been obviously focused on the podcast and, like, I tweet. I guess I should post for a living now. But. But, yeah, I want to go back to. Actually, I think you said this in one episode, but you have this habit of, like, going to, like, the New York Public Library and, like, writing.
01:36:12.282 - 01:36:17.962, Speaker B: I think this idea of writing really has helped me kind of crystallize process, digest a lot of things. It's been.
01:36:18.058 - 01:36:18.490, Speaker A: It's been.
01:36:18.522 - 01:36:43.394, Speaker B: I think it's going to be one of those years, like 2022. 2023. It certainly was for me in last cycle, where it takes time to process a lot of the things that have happened. The world increasingly moves at a faster pace. But I think there's value in. In writing stuff out, in ordering that process, and I enjoyed it. I haven't, like, necessarily found the time in the last two, three years.
01:36:43.394 - 01:36:50.594, Speaker B: Well, I was focused on doing other things, but I think I have the time now to. I want to. I want at least go back to writing.
01:36:50.894 - 01:37:10.634, Speaker A: Nice. I like all this. I like all this. I have. I have three. One is, I want to spend some of the best weekends in 2022. For me, were weekends spent in nature, like, getting out of New York, going up to, I don't know, like, the Catskills or something like that, or up to, like, upstate New York or Hudson Valley.
01:37:10.634 - 01:37:31.554, Speaker A: And. Yeah, I just want to spend. I want to spend a quarter quarterly, once a quarter, just long weekend in nature, whether that's, like, in a cabin and we rent or something like that. So that's. That's one. I want to hit the 800 club for lifting, which is, um, something. Yeah, my trainer's pushing me to do, which is 800 pounds of deadlift, squat, and bench.
01:37:31.554 - 01:37:38.314, Speaker A: Like, if you add up what you can do for all three of those 800 pounds. Um, and then I just started playing chess.
01:37:38.354 - 01:37:42.666, Speaker B: Is that set on a certain ratio of your body weight, or is it just an absolute number, like, for everyone?
01:37:42.730 - 01:37:46.914, Speaker A: It's just an absolute number. It's like, okay, yeah, um, I'm gonna.
01:37:46.954 - 01:37:49.650, Speaker B: Start calling you this 800 pound gorilla. So, 800.
01:37:49.722 - 01:38:06.176, Speaker A: Yeah, I want to do the 800. So 800. I have no idea if that's a good goal or not a good goal, but I want to do that. And also, I just started playing chess. I've never really played chess in my life. Like, I didn't play as a kid or anything like that. So I started playing on the chess app this year.
01:38:06.176 - 01:38:20.220, Speaker A: And you start a couple months ago. I think they start you as, like, a 400 player or 500 player. I'm now at. They give you like, an. I guess it's called an Ilo Elo ranking or something like that. I'm now an 800, which is really bad. But I want.
01:38:20.220 - 01:38:27.316, Speaker A: I want to get to a 1200 in chess, which the real chess players out there are going to laugh at that number, but I want to get to a 1200 by the end of the year.
01:38:27.380 - 01:38:35.784, Speaker B: So there's some really good chess players in crypto, like Ben, my former partner, paraphy. Quite good, actually. I think it was, like, fairly high ranked.
01:38:36.444 - 01:38:41.028, Speaker A: You know who's really good is Robert Leshner, Rod compound, I think.
01:38:41.076 - 01:38:43.616, Speaker B: I think Ben beat Robert or Matt. Yeah.
01:38:43.740 - 01:38:47.360, Speaker A: Matt playing from paradise is also really good.
01:38:47.392 - 01:38:54.816, Speaker B: Paradigm. Yeah. There was like, a con, like a tournament. And the final, I think, was like, kane and Ben, actually. Yeah.
01:38:54.880 - 01:38:59.112, Speaker A: Interesting. Yeah. So I'm trying to get my chess game up. I've never played. I've never really played some.
01:38:59.248 - 01:39:07.232, Speaker B: You've obviously watched the Magnuson documentary, this norwegian prodigy who, like.
01:39:07.288 - 01:39:17.314, Speaker A: Yeah, Magnus Carlson. I've been watching a lot of, like, Magnus. I haven't actually seen the documentary. I've been watching him on YouTube, though. Just, like, I just listened to him on Lex Friedman, actually. Yeah.
01:39:18.414 - 01:39:26.334, Speaker B: So, nice, man. Well, I'm not very good at chess, so, you know, anytime you want to have, like, validation that you're a good player, just, you know, come beat me.
01:39:26.374 - 01:39:34.286, Speaker A: Yeah. I want to feel really good about myself. This is fun chat. I'm. Yeah, thanks. Thanks, everyone, for listening. I'm really excited about this year.
01:39:34.286 - 01:39:51.688, Speaker A: We have some really fun podcasts lined up. I think we have a really good guest list. I think we're, like, just, I don't know, continuing to improve. But as Santi always says, like, if you guys have feedback for the show, don't drop it in the YouTube comments, because that's just a mean place. But tweet at us and, yeah, tell us. Tell us what you want to see.
01:39:51.736 - 01:40:10.710, Speaker B: Well, yeah, yeah. Always open to suggestions, and, you know, let us what you think about this format. If you like it, we'll, you know, continue to experiment with this type of format. Questions and maybe fire around or stuff like that. So, you know, always welcome feedback. But, as always, really appreciate everyone listening and taking time out of your day to hear us ramble.
01:40:10.902 - 01:40:12.114, Speaker A: Happy New Year, folks.
01:40:12.494 - 01:40:13.134, Speaker B: Happy New Year, everyone.
