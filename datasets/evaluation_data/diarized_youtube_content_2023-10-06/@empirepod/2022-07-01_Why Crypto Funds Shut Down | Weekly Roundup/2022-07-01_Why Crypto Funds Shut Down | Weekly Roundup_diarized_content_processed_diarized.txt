00:00:00.360 - 00:00:33.502, Speaker A: This episode is brought to you by Bitmex, the OG crypto exchange that is back and better than ever. Youll hear more about Bitmex later in the show. It makes more sense for a manager to close the fund, liquidate all the assets, then raise another fund, purchase the same assets at a bargain price in a few weeks or months time, and actually profit from the revival of the crypto market. Technically, on paper, if you put it on an excel, it makes sense. You lose your reputation, though, and thats probably why folks dont end up doing this. All right, all right, all right. Releasing this on July 1.
00:00:33.502 - 00:00:46.630, Speaker A: It is July 4 weekend. If you're tuning in, you got the dedication, you're not out barbecuing. You're listening to Santi leak some alpha. So we're glad to have you here for another episode of Empire. Santi, welcome back, my friend.
00:00:46.702 - 00:00:57.114, Speaker B: We're leaking some sauce. What's up, guys? It's good to be back. There's been a lot that's happening in the space, and so we're excited to cover as much of that as possible.
00:00:57.674 - 00:01:04.522, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Santi, what are you doing for the fourth? Do they celebrate the fourth out wherever you live these days?
00:01:04.618 - 00:01:12.466, Speaker B: No, I do not live in the US anymore. But it's, yeah, I guess. No, I don't celebrate the fourth.
00:01:12.490 - 00:01:13.626, Speaker A: Other than will you do anything?
00:01:13.690 - 00:01:14.826, Speaker B: Friends will? Yeah.
00:01:14.970 - 00:01:15.898, Speaker A: Like this weekend.
00:01:15.986 - 00:01:34.364, Speaker B: Look, I'm not in the US anymore, but I still owe a lot of, like, America is dear and dear to my heart because I think it embodies, it's still on a relative basis, I think the best place in the world where anyone has a fair shot at making it. And so that set of cultures and values I very much believe in. And so, yeah, I love America.
00:01:34.444 - 00:01:41.044, Speaker A: So I thought you were going to say you're like, I owe a lot to America. I thought you were going to say, I owe a lot of taxes in America, so I still celebrate the fourth.
00:01:41.084 - 00:01:48.476, Speaker B: No, no. I paid a lot of taxes back in the day. I mean, I spent ten years in the US and so no. Happy fourth, everyone.
00:01:48.620 - 00:02:03.980, Speaker A: Happy fourth. Happy fourth. Awesome. All right, so a big episode today. Here's the agenda for today. And per usual, we'll probably divulge into a bunch of random topics, but agenda for today, market update. Talk about just what happened this week, getting into some of the big news stories.
00:02:03.980 - 00:02:29.450, Speaker A: Second, we'll jump into an update on Voyager and three arrows. I think santi might have some thoughts there. Coin flex. I want to talk about the unfolding situation with coinflex and OG Roger ver. Then we'll get into some contagion that's happening in the bitcoin markets and specifically with bitcoin miners. Uh, Arthur Hayes put out a piece a couple of weeks ago about potential doom and gloom on July 4 weekend. We are at July 4 weekend, so we'll share some of those thoughts.
00:02:29.450 - 00:02:53.004, Speaker A: Um, I really want Santi to explain high watermarks to me. Um, I'm trying to wrap my. I think I understand them pretty well, but I want to make sure I fully understand them. And I want to make sure you guys all understand them because I think they're very important in today's bear market. Uh, c five versus d is probably where I'm spending the most of my time personally right now. And so I want to get into some thoughts there. And then just quick news.
00:02:53.004 - 00:02:58.624, Speaker A: And then I think Santi has a book recommendation for us. So, big episode. Santi. Anything I'm missing there?
00:02:59.004 - 00:03:01.060, Speaker B: No, no, no. I think that's really good. Let's get into it.
00:03:01.132 - 00:03:18.797, Speaker A: All right. Let's get into it. So bitcoin is down 7% week over week. ETH is down 8%. Bitcoin at the time of this recording, which is midday on Thursday, bitcoin's down to a little above 19,000. ETH is down to a little above 1000. Both down seven and 8%, respectively, on the weekend.
00:03:18.797 - 00:03:35.454, Speaker A: Uh, some of the big l one s. Solana is down 14%. Seems like there's a fat bid at $30 for Solana. It's been tough to break through that. Polkadot's down 12%. Avalanche is down 10% this past week. Another crazy week, right? Three arrows.
00:03:35.454 - 00:03:54.164, Speaker A: Looks like they're formally filing for bankruptcy. We'll talk about that in a second. Coinflex is issuing a new token offering 20% APY to cover some bad debts from Roger versus more on that later. Contagion risk is still looming. Like we mentioned before. Who is next? We've got July 4 weekend coming. Lack of a bid probably coming on July 4.
00:03:54.164 - 00:04:15.192, Speaker A: We have now seen more than 1 billion in bridgehacks this year. Michael Saylor purchased more bitcoin this Wednesday after already being down a billion on prior purchases. SEc yesterday denied graystate. Grayscale spot bitcoin ETF grayscale responded by suing the SEC. Shout out, grayscale. Um, I think we're. Everyone in the industry is rooting for them to, uh, to do well there.
00:04:15.192 - 00:04:37.496, Speaker A: Gary Gensler reaffirmed that bitcoin is a commodity. Uh, but also stated that many other crypto financial assets have the key attributes of a security. Not a good statement to make. We'll, we'll keep an eye on that. Uh, Coinbase had two negative things come from wall street. Uh, I think it was Goldman downgraded them to a cell and Moody's downgraded the debt. Uh, not great for Coinbase, which has already been hammered on the year.
00:04:37.496 - 00:04:50.936, Speaker A: Uh, Solana released a working fee market. I mean, uh, uh, a phone. A phone. Solana released a phone and crypto. Twitter is getting hot over governance decisions. Bitcoin maximalism. Good friend of the pod, Nick Carter.
00:04:50.936 - 00:05:10.226, Speaker A: Shout out Nick is being attacked by the bitcoin community for liking something. Asides from bitcoin, which. Shout out Nick, who's done a lot for the space. So, man, how are we still feeling? Santi, how are we feeling? Are you still feeling. Last week you were excited and the week before you were feeling good. How are we feeling today? It's a lot of bad news right there.
00:05:10.290 - 00:05:36.352, Speaker B: Yeah, look, I mean, I think we tend to focus on negative news during a bear market. I mean, that's just a sentiment. That's what we gravitate to. And the media is really good at feeding that. I mean, I hope that during the course of the next couple of weeks, and so we just provide a balanced take. There's certainly a lot of negativity. There's been a lot of stuff that has come out to light, particularly the three hour situation is really underwhelming in the sense of like we could have done.
00:05:36.352 - 00:06:18.126, Speaker B: I mean, it's just, you left wondering, like, it seems like everyone and their mother had exposure to three arrows and including a lot of Defi protocols that, you know, parked part of their treasury to get some yield. And, you know, I hope, like, in many ways, like, I understand the criticism of this space. Like, I think I was looking at. I was thinking about this yesterday. It has, it feels like a system wide impact. You talk about contagion that 3 hours is having across the space, lending desks, consumer apps like voyagers of the world, blockfi's of the world exchanges. So a lot of people are getting hit.
00:06:18.126 - 00:06:46.004, Speaker B: I'm like, this could have been avoided. It is like a mount Gox event, except for. I sympathize. Back in the day in Mount Gox, there wasn't a lot of venues to trade bitcoin. And so naturally you kind of went to mount Gox and a lot of people got impacted because of that. But in today's world, like, you didn't have to give your money to three arrows you didn't like. You know, like, the Singapore Banking Authority just issued a statement reprimanding three arrows for not, like, failing to disclose that they'd met.
00:06:46.004 - 00:06:58.980, Speaker B: They were managing more than 250 million. Like, come on, guys. Apparently the investigation has been going on for a little under a year, but it's like these guys been really vocal and flashing around the idea that they had billions of dollars under management. It's like, you can't.
00:06:59.012 - 00:06:59.522, Speaker A: It's.
00:06:59.668 - 00:07:16.254, Speaker B: It's a little too. Little too late. You know what I mean? And this is. It's disappointing because we can do better. You know what I mean? I've talked in prior episodes that the biggest risk that I see in this industry is just self sabotage. And in many ways, like, this is it. I mean, like, it's just, it's a little bit embarrassing.
00:07:16.294 - 00:07:16.446, Speaker A: Not.
00:07:16.470 - 00:07:43.676, Speaker B: Not a little. Actually, it is full stop embarrassing. And so you could blame 3 hours all day long, but at the end of the day, like, it's really like the due diligence officers in these companies, in these protocols that should have exercised more scrutiny. Candidly, I am. The short of it is I'm feeling excited about a number of things. It's also a moment that reflect. And before this episode, I was telling you, I love walking, and I've been walking a lot.
00:07:43.860 - 00:08:16.772, Speaker A: Yeah. I went on a trip when I was 22 or 23 to Israel, and I met this rabbi, and his name was Rabbi Shua. And Rabbi Shua told me, he said he was actually giving my best friend some relationship advice, right, because my buddy was in this, like, kind of relationship with some ups and downs. And he. And he told my friend, he said, look, the thing that you love about someone is often the things that thing that you don't like about them and the thing that goes wrong. And so the thing that you really don't like about your. My buddy's girlfriend at the time is also the thing that you really like about your girlfriend.
00:08:16.772 - 00:08:38.946, Speaker A: And it's kind of two sides of the same coin. And that's always stuck with me for the last decade. I think about that a lot when it comes to people and situations and things that blockworks and things in my personal life. And I think what we're seeing now is two sides of the same coin. And the reason I bring that story up is right now. Bankless always uses this line. It's like we're speed running the financial history or we're speed running finance.
00:08:38.946 - 00:09:16.728, Speaker A: I forget the actual way that they say it. And oftentimes we look at that as like a pro, right? We look at the fact that Hayden Adams is, and Rob, Rob Leshner and Stani, they don't come from, they didn't work at Goldman for 20 years. And that's why these systems are so amazing. And a lot of folks in crypto, like there, I'm a history major, right? Mike is a classics major. We didn't come from this ingrained financial system. The downside of that is sometimes we're forced to repeat some of the learnings that maybe folks in traditional capital markets have learned. And so, yeah, what's happening right now is just the cause of just about every banking financial crisis in history.
00:09:16.728 - 00:09:44.734, Speaker A: You borrow short term money and then you lend and you lock up funds over the long term. Right? If you think about September 2008 and every single investment bank who borrowed in the wholesale short term debt markets and went net long, took a government bailout or was bought by a commercial bank, or went out of business. And the crypto flavor of this today is that firms that borrowed short term money at high rates from retail holders locked it up long term into three arrows, and they are paying the penalty right now.
00:09:45.354 - 00:10:39.158, Speaker B: One of the things that I've changed my mind recently on is the idea that we can do under collateralized loans in DeFi. I think it's going to, given everything that's going on, one of the major criticisms with DeFi is that it's not very capital efficient relative to the traditional financial system where you have rehypothecation and the idea that a bank takes $1 and then lends out nine. And so in DeFi, obviously, the systems are over collateralized. And in many ways, as you said, it is nice to know that particularly everything that's going on and folks that were not exercising good risk management and we're lending out uncollateralized are taking a big hit. And I think, I've been excited about the idea of bringing more capital efficiency to DeFi. But I think you need a lot of things to happen, obviously, reputation and some sort of enforcement. But the credit has been throughout history.
00:10:39.158 - 00:10:48.960, Speaker B: You're a history major. The only way credit has been enforced throughout history is violence, or the perceived of violence, meaning the government can come down and there's like enforceability that doesn't exist in DeFi.
00:10:48.992 - 00:10:49.112, Speaker A: Right?
00:10:49.128 - 00:11:24.406, Speaker B: There's no. And so I think it's just going to take a long time to get there. And that doesn't mean that DeFi is kind of dead or, you know, it just means that there are other interesting innovations happening in DeFi, like minimizing counterparty risk that there would be reasons why you don't necessarily care about getting under collateralized loans. It's just, it allows you to get. Have access and use some of the assets that you have on chain and make them productive. Like, I think that use case is pretty, pretty cool, but it just means that it comes at a, you know, at a trade off. But, yeah, it's.
00:11:24.406 - 00:11:50.932, Speaker B: The coinflake situation is pretty interesting. Like, they were lending. I mean, there was a lot of exposure. I think Roger deposited a lot of BCH, and. And then historically, he had been a good counterparty, they say, because he was, like, refilling collateral, and, you know, but this is just a reminder. Like, it's not so much that you trust your counterparties. If you assume that this asset class is highly volatile, then you should be prepared to.
00:11:50.932 - 00:12:14.472, Speaker B: You should stress test your systems the same way that banks get regulated and are stress tested. I think you should assume what happens if the value of this collateral drops 80, 90%? Can it be easily liquidated? How are we going to manage that? And I think that's where a lot of folks were caught off guard. And just because you're in this environment of up only, I guess.
00:12:14.528 - 00:12:14.888, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:12:14.976 - 00:12:15.336, Speaker B: So here's.
00:12:15.360 - 00:12:58.182, Speaker A: Here's what happened with coinflex for folks who, uh, hopefully stayed off crypto Twitter this week, because I think it's a healthy for the emotional state to put the. Put the Twitter down and do what? Santi doesn't go on a walk. Coinflex is a, uh, is an exchange, right? They're trading in derivatives exchange. They suspended all user withdrawals last Thursday, about a week ago, due to, quote, extreme market conditions and, quote, continued uncertainty involving a counterparty. So everyone's thinking, all right, maybe the counterparty is three arrows, right? On Monday, coin flex. So five days ago Monday, Coinflex announced plans to raise funds by issuing a new token that will offer a 20% annual return. The token, as they put it, related to an outstanding debt owed by a, quote, certain high net worth individual.
00:12:58.182 - 00:13:30.438, Speaker A: So then it becomes, okay, it's not three arrows. Who's this high net worth individual? Coinflex CEO Mark Lamb announced the company would be issuing a new token offering a 20% yield. And if the full amount of 47 million is raised, which it seemed like the high net worth individual owed, then all Coinflex users would be able to withdraw their funds in full. So basically, there's this strange individual. We don't know who it is. Coinflex is missing 47 million. Because of that individual, they, I guess, owe the company money, and then they're going to issue a token with a 20% yield to get that money back.
00:13:30.438 - 00:14:09.296, Speaker A: Now, the interesting thing comes out on Tuesday. The high net worth individual is none other than Roger ver. Right. CEO of trading platform and wallet provider Bitcoin.com, but more well known for creating bitcoin cash and forking the bitcoin network, creating bitcoin cash, changing the block size back in the kind of block wars of 2017, which I'd really encourage folks to learn about if they don't remember that period. It turns out Roger versus, according to Coinflex, owes the exchange 47 million. And Coin Flux said they have a written contract with him obligating him to personally guarantee any negative equity on his Coinflex account and top up margin regularly.
00:14:09.296 - 00:14:22.924, Speaker A: It turns out he's a big customer of Coinflex. He denies that the debt pertains to him. Coinflex says the debt is 100% related to him. So just a nasty situation for both parties.
00:14:23.234 - 00:15:10.734, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that it will be interesting. What kind of legal precedent happens out of all these kind of restructurings and defaults was three arrows and affiliates, obviously, Coinflex Voyager. What kind of legal precedent is set as a result of that? There's obviously contracts in place, and so I guess you could sue the person and there's recourse. But again, it would be interesting how the actual court of law, in whatever jurisdiction these contracts are set to be settled or disputed, whether it's Delaware or BVI or Singapore or whatever, how the court interprets that. And I'd be pretty. Yeah, it's gonna be pretty interesting, I think, to see that.
00:15:10.774 - 00:15:15.278, Speaker A: Yeah, I've known Mark for years, so I don't want to talk too negatively on coin.
00:15:15.326 - 00:15:16.934, Speaker B: This is Mark Lamb, the CEO of Coinflex.
00:15:16.974 - 00:15:33.938, Speaker A: Mark Lamb, yeah, exactly. Mark. I've known Mark for. For years, since maybe 2017 or 2018. And he's a great guy. I will just say, I'm like, I don't love the 47 million in debt. You issue a token with 20% yield to, like, to backfill the 47 million.
00:15:33.938 - 00:15:57.394, Speaker A: It just. It's like, I don't know, it feels like you gave a $47 million uncollateralized loan to someone who can't pay it back to fund, so then they don't give it back. So then customers can't withdraw. So to fund other customers withdrawals, they turn the debt into a token. So sell it to people and offer 20% APY on it feels very degen for a company to do in the heart of a bear market.
00:15:57.694 - 00:16:20.584, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. I mean, it's like, I would characterize this as like a distressed bond of sorts. Yeah. And of course, in traditional markets, this is a common practice, like bankruptcy. There's a lot of hedge funds and vulture funds that specialize in distress. In distress. And they like to buy bonds, pennies on the dollar and restructure and have some sort of say in the company, and then end up.
00:16:20.584 - 00:17:33.424, Speaker B: You wipe up the existing equity and then it could be a pretty lucrative strategy. I will say it's highly sophisticated. I do question this mechanism, and if users truly kind of understand what's going on. And so, yeah, again, 20%, you have to then believe, like, I think they're saying if coinflix survives and, you know, is generating all these trading fees and proceeds from that will be diverted to paying people that own this token and. But again, yeah, you should sort of like, yeah, this is a big assumption that coinflex survives, which not sure of. There's an interesting tweet about related to this, which is someone had mentioned, I think it was Sam, actually, SPF, the founder, CEO, I guess, of Alameda and FTX had said, I think he's one that has perhaps the most amount of insight into the health and contagion that is going on in the space just because he's contemplating perhaps buying blockfi after giving them a 250 million line of credit. The voyager and a few other parties, I think he's taken a look at, and he mentioned a lot of these exchanges in particular are insolvent.
00:17:33.424 - 00:17:54.496, Speaker B: They just kind of don't know this yet, or are, you know, I don't know. Like, I don't know if I believe that. Like, someone in the exchange, like, doesn't know they're insolvent. I think it's pretty clear, but at least I think it was more so. I think people don't realize, and he was kind of intimating at this, that the level of contagion is not. Is not fully understood yet. And so to me, that's.
00:17:54.496 - 00:17:57.644, Speaker B: That's pretty alarming. If you have money with counterparties.
00:17:58.064 - 00:18:01.072, Speaker A: It's interesting he called out exchanges, by the way, because when I think about.
00:18:01.088 - 00:18:02.120, Speaker B: What'S going on, it's just like a.
00:18:02.152 - 00:18:23.196, Speaker A: Lending well, and that feels maybe like an aggressive. Like he probably wants to scoop up some assets on the cheap. It feels like when I look at. Let's run through who's been affected. You have Celsius, blockfi. Genesis had to, I think sell or hedge all their liquid collateral on hand, and the losses were netted against the balance sheet. You have Nexo, which claims no exposure to three arrows.
00:18:23.196 - 00:18:45.420, Speaker A: But there's some stuff coming out about Nexo right now. Finblox, which is a crypto yield platform, their withdrawal limit of, uh, I think they moved it to, like, $500 a day or $1,500 a month, which is basically the same as we're blocking withdrawals. Babel finance, uh, had a $3 billion loan book. They suspended withdrawals. Um, Voyager. Right. They had a massive, uh, exposure to three arrows.
00:18:45.420 - 00:18:53.428, Speaker A: They stopped. Uh, they put their withdrawal limit at $10,000 a day. Uh, and now coin flex. Right. So, coin flex is a. An exchange. Voyager is a broker.
00:18:53.428 - 00:19:00.114, Speaker A: The rest are lend and borrow platforms. So it's interesting that Sam called out the exchanges, not just the lending borrow platforms.
00:19:00.234 - 00:19:51.408, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it reminds you a lot of exchanges allow margin, and so, like, leverage positions, and so that might be it. I think one of the things that is pretty interesting is you're sort of wondering, okay, this solidifies the thesis for DeFi, but the problem is, a lot of users don't, you know, don't feel comfortable managing their own keys and interacting and being a self custodian. And. And so that is the issue, which is, I'm very much a believer in Defi. I don't have a lot of exposure to counterparties because I feel comfortable operating in a world where I'm in control of my assets and minimize counterparty risk. But it puts into question, I was thinking about this the other day. What are the things that.
00:19:51.408 - 00:20:36.982, Speaker B: Sure, Defi is great, but. But in reality, what is going to happen in the next cycle? What needs to happen for users to really use this? And how do we create systems that prevent this sort of stuff? I think human behavior and greed always gets to some of us systemically, and these things continue to happen, not just in crypto, just in general. But I'm curious, is DeFi ever going to get the number of users that, like, the user that is using coinflex, the user that is using, you know, Voyager or Celsius? You know, there was, like, warning signs that were Celsius for a number of times, but people just kept their money there. And unfortunately, no, I think that's the big question.
00:20:37.038 - 00:21:19.744, Speaker A: Right? Like, Aven compound could not have misallocated assets and hid losses like Celsius did. Right? Asset management protocols on Defi, like enzyme couldn't have lied about AUM and asset coverage like three arrows did. Maker and Dai right wouldn't have failed due to humans inadequately defending a peg like Luna did and Ust did. So the Defi is showing actually really, really strong right now. But at the end of the day, I think it was Logan Jestremsky posted this thing. Shout out Logan. If you look at the total users uniswap, Aave Maker, Chainlink, zero X protocol curve, Ens and Dydx combined have less than 8 million users across all of those protocols.
00:21:19.744 - 00:21:37.952, Speaker A: So I love that question that you're saying is like, how do we bring users into Defi and how do we make it really user friendly? I think it has something to do with holding your own keys and being spooked of holding your own keys and like, I don't know, I don't want to hold several million bucks on like a metamask. That doesn't sound right. Yeah.
00:21:37.968 - 00:21:38.216, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:21:38.280 - 00:21:40.430, Speaker A: That doesn't sound fun. Yeah.
00:21:40.502 - 00:22:46.498, Speaker B: I think my view is that at some point most users will still come from a user aggregator, whether it's existing financial institutions, like most of the financial apps that you have on your phone. The Uber bullish case here is that they start using crypto rails to do the settlement and to be more efficient. As the world becomes more competitive, a bank might be more compelled to use defi rails, assuming there's sufficient regulatory certainty and clarity to settle stuff, to do it faster, better and cheaper to minimize compliance and overhead costs, which are increasingly eating into margins. The user might not even realize the closing loop there is. There needs to be somehow a mechanism where the user is still in control and can audit and can verify without necessarily having to manage the complexity of the security piece, which is hard. But yeah, it's like everything. At some point there needs to be ownership and accountability of, especially when you're dealing with your money and most people kind of don't want to think about that.
00:22:46.498 - 00:22:47.306, Speaker B: And it's stressful.
00:22:47.370 - 00:23:06.226, Speaker A: I get, yeah, here's pre. All of this stuff like imploding on itself, all of CEFi imploding on itself. Here was my thesis. I thought that DeFi would sit in the background. Users would never actually interact with DeFi. I really thought that. I thought c five was going to sit on top of DeFi, and CFI would basically be the rails.
00:23:06.226 - 00:23:33.434, Speaker A: And the way that you got money out of the traditional capital market system into CFI and CFI would give you exposure to deFi. I don't like that. I think I was wrong and I don't like that system anymore, because when you have CEFi sitting in the middle or your money's at JPMorgan and they're using crypto rails for something. You're still relying on these centralized entities that have. A lot of humans are greedy and humans have make mistakes. And.
00:23:35.134 - 00:25:02.384, Speaker B: Although to be fair, look, at the end of the day, I think the challenges that I've observed in crypto over the years is that we become too idealistic without being pragmatic. And it's never like a binary, it's always asymptotic, meaning, I think the question that we need to ask ourselves is not whether it's perfectly decentralized or perfectly secure or perfectly transparent, is it an improvement meaningful enough for a user to perceive the value, whether it's ten x threshold, faster, better, cheaper, however you want to think about it, right? And the idea is, I do believe, like, even in that scenario, where the bank is, is kind of operating on chain, like, the increased transparency, at least on a system level, you know, kind of access, a deterrent for people to act maliciously, to do things and get away with it. I think, like, I think the global financial crisis, a big part of that was you didn't understand the level of exposure to a lot of financial institutions. The Lehman, bear Stearns, bank of America, AIg, the list goes on and on and on. I think what's interesting about DeFi, good and bad, is there's not a lot of transparent privacy. And so you can very quickly, you know, people are piecing together this analysis and forensics of, like, all the wallets of Celsius, man. You can't do that in traditional financial system.
00:25:02.384 - 00:25:56.144, Speaker B: Yeah, like, I know, I know. Sometimes that could be problematic, because when you're bidding, for instance, like constitution Dow against Ken Griffin, like, Ken knew that constitution Dow how x amount of dollars, he just needed to bid a little bit more than that. But nonetheless, like, if all these assets, real world assets, depositors deposit basics, all the exposure in the financial system is brought on chain, and of course you need some level of privacy here, then you at least have better transparency into the workings of the economy and the financial system that you currently don't have. And that may sound too idealistic. I hope that we move there. I think if we're somehow, you wave a magic wand and you enter into a system like that, then I think it's harder for bad actors to get away with stuff. It's harder to abscond and do money laundering and do all kinds of stuff.
00:25:56.144 - 00:26:25.702, Speaker B: And I think that's why regulators would be excited and interested in this technology. Like especially in places like India where you have massive shadow economies where you don't have the ability to even understand your GDP because all of this stuff happens through cash. And you know, why wouldn't you want to have all economic activity be represented and mapped in a digital context with a digital footprint that is immutable? I know that may sound crazy and we're getting.
00:26:25.838 - 00:26:55.644, Speaker A: I have a prediction. No, no, I have a prediction for you actually. And I want long or short, yes or no. One of the things that takes off in the next bull market is highly scalable EVM compatible, privacy enabled l one s. I think that those will be who just launched this Jill Carlson. Shout out to Jill Carlson. Are launching something called espresso, which is like a highly scalable EVM compatible.
00:26:55.644 - 00:27:14.720, Speaker A: It fits all three of those things. And whether or not that works or not, I don't know. But I know Jill. She's incredibly brilliant. Her team is incredibly brilliant. Some of the smartest minds right now are working on zks and privacy enabled L1 s, which I think becomes really, really, really important in the next bull market.
00:27:14.912 - 00:28:01.578, Speaker B: Yeah. Shout out to Tor from Enigma, who has a secret network. He was critical in one post that I was, he said, look, the problem is if people really valued this, like, they would already be moving to my network, like Secret network, which allows some like default privacy. And I said, well, maybe like one. I think, like we're still in a state of the world where like, we are, the users in crypto are perhaps currently, today are very different than the users that are going to come in five years, and we'll be here in five years. Like we're just beta testers. And so in many ways it poses a challenge for existing builders, because if you go out and you ask people what they want, a lot of times you're not going to get perhaps the answer that may be correct.
00:28:01.578 - 00:29:01.162, Speaker B: And building a product tailored for mass adoption. Which brings me to the idea of trying to understand the rationale of the Solana team to launch a mobile phone, Android, but mobile phone of their own. I think it requires. That level of thinking to me is more interesting because it requires stepping out a little bit of the current user base and saying, well, let's, instead of designing systems where our current users in discord want, let's zoom out and say, okay, what actually in five years time, let's build for that user. And okay, we're well capitalized in order to build towards that. But I think that's the level of thinking that is interesting now for builders out there, because in this current environment, I think you want to be building for that type of user, whether it's institutional or non institutional. And so it's a little bit of trying to play a game of what are they going to value without necessarily understanding what they want today, because they're not going to tell you.
00:29:01.162 - 00:29:02.050, Speaker B: They're not here.
00:29:02.202 - 00:29:02.642, Speaker A: Agreed.
00:29:02.698 - 00:29:04.570, Speaker B: But privacy and security is a big piece.
00:29:04.642 - 00:29:16.746, Speaker A: I would agree. I'm pulling this back to the agenda or we will not cover a single thing that I said we were going to cover. And people will be mad. Santi. People will be mad on Wednesday. On Monday, Voyager. Just a quick update on Voyager and three arrows.
00:29:16.746 - 00:29:46.824, Speaker A: On Monday, Voyager officially issued a notice of default to three arrows. On Wednesday, David Kanellis at Blockworks reported that three arrows had been ordered into liquidation by a British Virgin Islands BVI court partners from global consulting firm Tineo restructuring. I don't know. Teneo restructuring, maybe they're huge. It sounds like they do restructuring or said to be managing three arrows is insolvency. 3 hours is headquartered in Singapore, as a lot of people know, but they're incorporated in the British Virgin islands. So we will.
00:29:46.824 - 00:30:03.924, Speaker A: Blockworks is covering this really closely, following this really closely, covering the news on a day to day basis. So we will keep you guys posted there. Empire is brought to you by BitMex. With the launch of their spot exchange. Bitmex is running an insane promo right now. We wanted to give you the inside scoop. Here's the deal.
00:30:03.924 - 00:30:45.358, Speaker A: For the next two months, users who trade dollar 250 worth of crypto on Bitmex's spot exchange will be entered into their million dollar giveaway. Prizes range from thousands of dollars all the way up to $500,000. That's right. Trade $250 on Bitmex for a chance to personally win $500,000. Beyond the million dollar giveaway, new users can also get up to 200 BMEx BM ex. That's Bitmex's new token coming soon just by creating an account and going through KYC and trading. So you can actually get Bitmex tokens just by creating an account and trading.
00:30:45.358 - 00:30:58.158, Speaker A: The more you trade, the higher your chances of winning. What are you waiting for? Go to bitmex.com today. Sign up for an account bit m e x.com dot. You don't talk bitcoin mining. I think there's a, I think there's.
00:30:58.206 - 00:31:00.634, Speaker B: Mentioned that in the prior episode, so let's definitely cover that.
00:31:00.774 - 00:31:21.922, Speaker A: Yeah. So let me give an update on kind of bitcoin mining. Ryan Swanson is a blockworks analyst, an analyst on the research team, and he's been really, really helpful to break this stuff down. So if you guys don't follow Ryan Swanson, go check him out. Usually, here's what happens. Price goes down, bitcoin. Price goes down, miner go, miners go offline, difficulty adjusts.
00:31:21.922 - 00:31:51.088, Speaker A: Now, though, what's different from the 2018 2019 bear is the amount of credit in the bitcoin mining system. A, there are lenders like Blockfi and Blockchain.com and DCG with foundry mining and a bunch of other folks and Genesis as well. Right now they have access to credit and now they're publicly traded companies, so they have even more access to credit. So again, usually, price goes down, miners go offline, difficulty adjusts. New equilibrium found. Miners go back online.
00:31:51.088 - 00:32:29.484, Speaker A: Now, though, because they have access to credit, they can operate at a really, really significant loss. So price goes down, miners don't go offline, difficulty stays where it was. Miners start losing money faster and faster and faster than they otherwise would be. Um, the lending business uses Asics as collateral, right? So if you lend to a bit, a big miner, um, a, they're going to take your bitcoin if you can't pay back the debts, but if you can't pay back with bitcoin, they're going to take your asics. However, lenders right now don't want to repo the Asics because you'd flood the market with a bunch of asics, which would drive the price of Asics down and you'd sell them for pennies on the dollar.
00:32:31.104 - 00:32:34.288, Speaker B: Historically, the depreciation curve of these machines is pretty high.
00:32:34.416 - 00:32:35.016, Speaker A: It is main.
00:32:35.040 - 00:33:22.716, Speaker B: And some other folks, I never got really comfortable investing in miners or operating one of my own unless you were mining in 2010. Industrial grade mining is for very, very small, sophisticated players. And I just don't think that that's where historically, I think you would much better just behind the underlying spot and like, you would outperform those mining operations. Now, the trick there, of course, is like rising energy prices has caught a lot of these folks off guard very, very quickly. Combined with falling prices, bitcoin's now down six 7%. Today it's below 20 yet again. And so, of course, all of that is it puts further stress in the operations of these miners and them being potentially in technical default with these loans, because the collider is just not there.
00:33:22.820 - 00:34:04.154, Speaker A: Mike, I think the one we were talking about this beforehand, I was like, I think Russia and the pipelines and rising energy costs are going to be a big impact on this. I was thinking about it as you were just saying that I'm pretty sure how it works and we'll have to bring some bitcoin miners on this, is that the miners typically have long term energy contracts. So they actually maybe aren't as susceptible to price spikes. I might have been wrong when we were talking pre recording. I think the primary factors that go into the profitability of a miner are basically power prices and capex. Capex is the cost of the mining rig. And the market is dominated really by two large chinese players, micro BT and Bitmain.
00:34:04.154 - 00:34:14.613, Speaker A: They basically just have a duopoly and that grants them this, gives them this really strong pricing power. So even when prices are going down, they maybe don't, they aren't as price sensitive to the market.
00:34:14.773 - 00:34:49.040, Speaker B: Yeah. Although to be fair, even though, yes, you're hedging that you have long term energy contracts in place. Like look what's happening in the UK now. They're contemplating shutting down sending natural gas to Europe in the summer because they're already anticipating rise like a shortage during the winter. And so they want to stockpile more natural gas. And so I think what you're seeing now, not to get too much into macro and geopolitical stuff, is a lot of countries are now very much focused on safeguarding resources internally and make sure that they have enough near shoring. And of course COVID and the war in Ukraine has just highlighted.
00:34:49.040 - 00:35:39.332, Speaker B: This globalization trend is being pulled back as countries realize, look, we need to secure access to resources internally and make sure that we rein in inflation. And a big part of that is bringing back and making sure that you have the ability to access a lot of this stuff to contain inflation in many ways, as I say this, I think the only probably sector in the economy that's going to really grow. And one of the things that I would be looking at is the manufacturing index, domestic manufacturing index for a lot of these countries. If you're a player, there might be opportunities there because the governments might extend contracts to you because they are so, so have been so reliant on global supply chains that are now being put into question and fragile because of the whole geopolitical situation and also just economically. Like it's not very viable anymore.
00:35:39.468 - 00:36:20.254, Speaker A: Yeah, I have two friends who operate, or I think they're, one's like SVP of Ops and one is COO of these big bitcoin miners, two publicly traded bitcoin miners. And it is an incredibly hard business to run because you have to, you have to think not six to twelve months out, but you have to think much further out. And like, one example of this is even though demand has really waned for bitcoin recently, miners are continuing to add machines to their fleets, which you can see by the growth of the global hashrate. The disconnect between the price and the hashrate stems from this twelve to 18 month delivery lag for bitmains S nine s. Forget what the current model is.
00:36:20.294 - 00:36:21.446, Speaker B: S nine was a few years ago.
00:36:21.470 - 00:36:40.412, Speaker A: But, yeah, S 19. I think it's s 19 for the bitcoin. S bitmain s 19. So there's this twelve to 18 month delivery. Right, lag. So a lot of the hash rate coming online today was ordered, like 18 months ago during the period when, like, bitcoin was hitting all time highs at $65,000. However, like, let's say you actually get these s 19s.
00:36:40.412 - 00:37:07.980, Speaker A: Electricity costs are rising, bitcoins price is dropping dramatically. Miners are struggling to make their interest payments. You have these struggling miners now who received their pre ordered rigs that they ordered at bitcoin all time highs. They don't even want to turn these things on because they'd operate at a loss. Uh, it's a really. So what ends up happening is like, the miners have to start selling off bitcoin on the balance sheet to meet the debt obligations. This pushes bitcoin down farther, which puts even more financial strain on the mining industry.
00:37:08.052 - 00:37:43.790, Speaker B: Yeah, so this, like, that's an excellent point, which is why I've. Look, this is a part of the bigger discussion of the distinction between proof of work and proof of stake. But I felt that, look, these two systems, when you compare them, the biggest challenge that I see with proof of work is the idea that you constantly have an operator there that has, that is constantly selling to recoup and make, to recoup capex and also make a profit. And that selling pressure can be, can be, it varies, right. But in this current environment, just further exacerbates the downtrend. And proof of stake is you don't have that pressure.
00:37:43.822 - 00:37:43.990, Speaker A: Right.
00:37:44.022 - 00:38:36.918, Speaker B: Because it's effectively capital owners are the ones that are staking and earning some proof of stake yield. But it's very different. I think one is an owner and the other one is not so much an owner, meaning he's just there to profit as quickly as possible. Whereas if you own the underlying, you're not as sensitive or eager to sell necessarily. It has felt to me that proof of stake, when I first heard about it, was just a more sustainable model from a security budget perspective, but also from an alignment of owners and operators of the network that are operators, meaning you're providing security through validation. And it just felt to me that proof of stake from that perspective was much more sustainable model than proof of work. But that's like a topic for like 3 hours.
00:38:36.966 - 00:38:54.744, Speaker A: You know what I'll bring? We'll have a bitcoin mining episode. I'll bring my two buddies on the show. I think what ends up happening is similar to FTX and CFI right now. This is going to lead to just a huge consolidation where the investors and miners with healthy balance sheets end up swallowing the really highly leveraged bitcoin miners.
00:38:56.204 - 00:39:25.362, Speaker B: Let me ask you a question then. One of the biggest criticism about proof of stake is the concentration. There's big whales out there. And this is a feudal system of sorts where owners of Ethereum, it's fairly concentrated. Is that any different from miners? Like, the control hash rate? Like, what is it? Like the top three miners? Like, if they collude, they could theoretically attack the network. Like, they have greater than 51% hash rate in this environment. Like, I don't know.
00:39:25.362 - 00:39:57.062, Speaker B: We should probably monitor this and track this. Like, the concentration of hashrate among the larger players probably goes up because those are the guys that survive, right? The smaller guys are really the ones that get squeezed. They're not as sophisticated. They haven't hedged as well. They don't have as much, much access to loans and capital providers, and they're in a more precarious situation financially. And so if those guys go away, there's just a greater concentration among the, among the pools, among the big players. Like, so it's just something to monitor and keep, keep tabs on.
00:39:57.198 - 00:40:23.748, Speaker A: Very much so, yeah. I mean, what's the, I think the, who owns the biggest pool right now? I think it's foundry. I think DCG's mining arm foundry owns like maybe 20% market share. Amp pool pool and f two pool have like 15% market share. And then I think you've got a couple of folks down at like 10%, which is, uh, binance pool. I think binance actually has like a 10% mining pool and pool in has like ten or eleven. So anyways, I'm not the best person to talk about this.
00:40:23.748 - 00:41:00.842, Speaker A: We will bring some folks on. Here's my prediction. My far out prediction is that, uh, just like you're seeing, uh, Goldman come in. Citi come in and try to scoop up these assets on the cheap. Uh, like the CFI assets, like Celsius and folks like that, this is the first time they've really made a massive push. From a large balance sheet acquisition point of view, this could be the first time you ever see traditional oil and gas companies and big energy companies come into bitcoin mining through, uh, uh, scooping up some of these bitcoin miners for pennies on the dollar. It's not likely, but that would be an interesting thing to see play out.
00:41:00.898 - 00:41:16.774, Speaker B: So I'm looking at the just back to mining pool stats. Foundry and pool, f two pool, pool in and binance. If you combine all those five, they basically have 60% of all the hashrate and the top three, by the way, 49.
00:41:17.194 - 00:41:17.842, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:41:17.978 - 00:41:34.684, Speaker B: And it's been this, like, it's foundry and pool and f two pool. Collectively, they have roughly 50% of the hash rate out there. Now, that number probably goes much higher, assuming that the other tail end of folks that are kind of insignificant go away.
00:41:35.064 - 00:41:56.776, Speaker A: Keep in mind, though, like, concentration may seem like a threat to the decent, may seem like a threat to bitcoin mining. However, mining pools don't control the network and don't have a lot of. Don't have a lot of clout in this sense, because any miner can just quickly change pools. Right. If there's any hint of foul play, such as, like, if someone starts, like, censoring bitcoin transactions, you can really quickly just change. No, fair point.
00:41:56.800 - 00:42:11.734, Speaker B: Like, I'm not trying to fud here. Like, I'm not saying, like, the network's gonna be attacked tomorrow. It has been like this for a while. There are reasons why, to your point, that and a number of other reasons why it doesn't get it. Like, you have kind of comfort and validity that it's not going to get attacked. So this is by no means a flood. It's just.
00:42:11.734 - 00:42:19.910, Speaker B: It's just not ideal that you have this situation, but there's always. It's just important for folks to appreciate that is all I'm trying to say.
00:42:20.022 - 00:42:29.514, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah, I agree. All right, let's get into the man, the myth, Arthur Hayes, by the way, do you know, do you know Arthur? Can we bring him on this podcast?
00:42:30.024 - 00:42:33.160, Speaker B: We probably can if he's listening. We'd love to have you.
00:42:33.352 - 00:43:01.202, Speaker A: So, yeah, we'll reach out floaters and July 4 weekend predictions from Arthur Hayes. Arthur published an article on June 16 called Floaters, where he talked about the contagion in the crypto markets and the doom of many existing crypto funds. He refers to the market crash contagion victims as floaters. You have to read the article to figure out why they're called floaters. It is not pretty, is a little hint. And so far, the article has been right on target. He predicts.
00:43:01.202 - 00:43:25.136, Speaker A: Arthur predicts this final showdown between panicked sellers and a bidless market to happen on the upcoming July 4 weekend. So again, he wrote this two or three weeks ago. We are now at the July 4 weekend. And here's kind of, I think there are like three or four reasons why. Right. By today, when we're recording this, the Fed will have enacted this big rate hike, is what he says. And sure enough, they did that.
00:43:25.136 - 00:43:41.424, Speaker A: July 4 falls on a Monday and is a federal banking holiday. This is, as he says, the perfect setup for yet another mega crypto dump. There are three ingredients to this dump. A. Risk assets will again rediscover their dislike for tightening USD liquidity conditions. Sponsored by the Fed. B.
00:43:41.424 - 00:44:11.410, Speaker A: Crypto funds must raise fiat to satisfy redemption requirements by continuing to sell any liquid asset. Liquid crypto asset. We are definitely starting to see this across some of the tier one and tier two funds. You can see them on chain selling liquid crypto assets for cash to satisfy redemptions. And three, even during this time, no fiat can be deployed until Tuesday, July 5, because all the banks are shut down because of the holiday. So he calls it the perfect setup for a mega crypto dump. I'm curious to get your take on this.
00:44:11.602 - 00:44:37.072, Speaker B: Yeah, well, weekends have historically been times of low volume and a lot of volatility. So, yeah, I would exacerbate. But a long weekend, I think. Q two numbers are going to start showing up, right? I think. When is it that we technically, I mean, Q two numbers come out and I think you'll be in a technical recession, which, you know, I think people already know. But when you see the, when you see the headlines.
00:44:37.088 - 00:44:38.608, Speaker A: Right? When the headlines come out. Yeah, exactly.
00:44:38.656 - 00:44:39.964, Speaker B: It always sinks in.
00:44:40.784 - 00:44:55.488, Speaker A: When do funds have to start sending? So, like, let's say you're an investor, like a pantera or parafy or a framework, like any of these, like big crypto funds. Like, when do they actually send their statements to investors? Is it a week after the month?
00:44:55.656 - 00:45:05.320, Speaker B: It's a great question. It really depends because a lot of times I'm an investor in number of funds, and some take at least a couple of weeks after the month close to report.
00:45:05.392 - 00:45:10.204, Speaker A: You got to imagine they might be pushing that deadline out a little longer this year.
00:45:10.504 - 00:45:48.338, Speaker B: I don't know if that's the case, but their fund administrators take time to reconcile and issue fund statements around redemptions it also varies. It's definitely like some funds have just a notice period, which say that like a quarter, say that you want to redeem. You put your notice when you get your statement in February. Now, you might not be able to do that as easily. You might have to wait three months, six months to get your money. It just depends on how these funds are structured. A lot of them do have flexibility to, to do like only some.
00:45:48.338 - 00:46:06.458, Speaker B: Some are quarterly, some are annual, some are semi annual redemptions. I'm not sure. I think, like more, more funds in crypto because of volatility and historically, what we've seen in the space try to build in as much buffer to have time to, to sell these positions in an orderly manner if there are redemptions.
00:46:06.586 - 00:46:09.242, Speaker A: Wait, so explain this to me. Like, what actually, like when we hear.
00:46:09.258 - 00:46:45.944, Speaker B: About, so, jason, hypothetically, someone called, you invest in investor, you're investor in fund a, you want your money because whatever you want to take money out, you got your statement. You got your say that you got your may statement. You just got it actually probably, or you got it a few weeks. You say, hey, you know what? I want to de risk. I want my money back. You call them and say, I put in a redemption notice and you probably are not, in most cases, are not going to get that money. You have to kind of wait, probably, I would say at least a quarter.
00:46:45.944 - 00:46:54.944, Speaker B: And so that puts you in August, September timeframe.
00:46:55.444 - 00:47:31.760, Speaker A: And if you're ahead of the fund, right? Like, let's say when you were at parafy, someone calls you up, they're like, santi, I need to de risk. I want, I want. I have $10 million in your fund. I want to take 5 million out. Does that turn into a sales call? And that's like, look, Jason, I get you on a de risk, like, keep your money with us, and it turns into walking them through the markets, calming them down a little bit. You get on the phone like, a, so is that kind of how those usually go? And then b, let's say I'm like, I don't care, Santi, I still want to pull my money. Do you basically say you have to give the money back based on whatever the agreement says on like semi annual or annual?
00:47:31.932 - 00:48:37.526, Speaker B: Well, I'm not going to speak on paraphy's account or any fund. General statement? Yeah, it also depends. Some funds have the ability to exercise what is called a gate, meaning, and you saw this a lot in the global financial crisis with a lot of funds got, like, in traditional markets, the redemption is much faster. Like you can redeem in a month and get your money back. Sometimes they have two interesting provisions that end up becoming more important. And LP's kind of learned this the hard way in the global financial crisis is sometimes when a lot of investors try to redeem their money all at once, the fund manager has the ability to pause redemptions, what is known as a gate, meaning for them to like prevent the situation where they need a for sale if they don't want to sell. And so that is, of course, very friendly for the manager because in an environment like today, you could imagine a lot of investors if they have the ability to redeem, which many may not, because some of these funds have multiple year lockups, one year lockup, two three year lockups for the hedge funds.
00:48:37.526 - 00:49:08.744, Speaker B: Right. If you're a venture fund, it's a closed end fund. You can't take your money out until after ten years or so. So it's for the liquid funds out there that may block the redemption notice and say, guys, we're not going to give your money back. It's super volatile. We feel that we're going to exercise this provision that protects us from actually legally being required to give you your money back until we feel that it's good market conditions. Now that may be contested and can get ugly.
00:49:08.744 - 00:49:53.244, Speaker B: But for the most part, let's just assume that most funds in crypto don't have this gate because sophisticated institutional players don't like it. Then, yes, you have to honor the redemption notice and give them the money whenever that is. June, July, August, September, October, November, December. So I think that brings us back to what we're, I've been looking at over the last, the first episode, this started in May. I said, look, there are some funds that are probably going to blow up. And you said, are they going to blow up because they just blew up like they took a lot of leverage, or are they going to blow up because it closed shop because of the high water? Mark and I said both. We've seen some of 3 hours blew up because they were taking a whole lot of leverage.
00:49:53.244 - 00:50:17.690, Speaker B: They lost a lot of money on a couple of trades, GBTC, Arb luna. And so they try to make that back. And of course, the market turned in a very nasty way. And so you blow up because of that. So that's been that. And then the other itch, which I think is why I'm cautious on the liquid side of things, is this point, which is there's going to be a lot of redemptions, I think, and redemptions cause for selling? Yes. Yeah.
00:50:17.690 - 00:50:22.906, Speaker B: Unless, of course, you raise like. Yeah, I mean, it's, it is for selling.
00:50:23.050 - 00:50:30.666, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. Can you. Let's cover high water mark to make sure everyone understands high water marks. Can you give your, what is the high watermark?
00:50:30.770 - 00:51:05.320, Speaker B: Yeah. Mind you, I'm not like an expert on this stuff, but my general understanding is, let's say that the fund was up massively last year. And so the fund goes from 100 to 1000. And that's like your nav at the end of, at the end of the year. This year you're down 50%. So you're back to 500. And so you have to go back to 1000 in order to charge Kerry.
00:51:05.320 - 00:51:49.004, Speaker B: Now it brings us to the question, how do funds make money? Two ways. One, management fee, which is typically the order of 2% based on AUM or capital commitments. And the second is where the real opportunity is, is on performance, meaning 20% typically on any performance, any gain above your capital contribution. And so as an investor, you saw your statement last year and said, oh, wow, my account say that you're just one investor. My account was worth 1000 at the end of the year. Now it's worth 500. The watermark is if the fund manager is able to go back to 1000, you would have said, oh, wow, they just made a 500 profit this year.
00:51:49.004 - 00:52:56.064, Speaker B: Let me take 20% of that. So 100. But the reality is you actually don't get any carry because you just, again, the high water mark is that, just, as the name implies, is 1000. So it moves up as you kind of mark your book, mark to market or whatever, then you need to go back to 1000. And anything above that is where you actually start making money. So what does that actually, that is difficult for a lot of funds in a very volatile asset class like crypto because there are two, three years, as we have been, where you just kind of, it was a great time to be an investor in technology generally, but now a lot of funds, not just in crypto, but like Chase Coleman, for instance, like Tiger, is down 50% on the year. Melvin Capital, which was caught on the other wrong side of the meme stock trade, had to close shop, actually, because you said, look, when you're down that much, like what is the probability? I think as a fund manager, you say, okay, it's going to take a lot to go back up to that high watermark.
00:52:56.064 - 00:53:16.194, Speaker B: Like, I need to make a three x and to then potentially start making money. Now, there was two ways to kind of mitigate this problem. One is you raise more capital at the bottom. So right now you say, God, this is a generational buying opportunity. Let me. Excuse me. Let me go try to raise a bunch of funds.
00:53:16.194 - 00:53:49.150, Speaker B: And on the funds that you raised today, you are actually earning. Carry on. Because they start at a much lower bar. Right. The problem is, who's going to give you the money in this environment? It's probably really hard as a lot of people are kind of licking their wounds and not willing to allocate until kind of things settle down. But, you know, that's not to say money's still looking to be allocated like you have, you know, funds like Blackstone and Oaktree that have raised some pretty interesting funds lately. Traditional markets in crypto, not so much.
00:53:49.150 - 00:54:06.086, Speaker B: I think. I think the fundraising environment's kind of weak, although I haven't looked at the numbers, but I would probably gather that there's not a lot of money looking to allocate to the asset class for now. So, yeah, hopefully that was a one on one. But you let me know if there's anything that's helpful.
00:54:06.110 - 00:54:27.180, Speaker A: Let me almost repeat it back to you to make sure I fully understand it. So, basically, the high watermark is the highest value that a fund has ever reached. Let's say I'm a hedge fund manager. I make two and 20, right? I'm getting 2% of the. Of the value in the fund. The 20 is the performance fee, right. I can't charge my 20% performance fee until the fund reaches the prior peak.
00:54:27.180 - 00:54:53.584, Speaker A: So this almost gives the incentive for funds to close when we're in a market like this, because let's use some numbers. If a fund was $200 million and now it's $50 million after the crash, the fund needs to return 300% before the gps can collect any profits. Right. However, if they just close the fund, restart with the 50 million, and then profit $30 million, they made that same. That same return. So.
00:54:55.684 - 00:54:57.980, Speaker B: Because it's a reputation game, right?
00:54:58.012 - 00:54:59.420, Speaker A: It is a reputation, yeah, of course.
00:54:59.452 - 00:55:37.584, Speaker B: So. But the other incentive that can be out of whack is the level of risk taking that. That is there. Once you understand that, you need to really blow it out of the water to then make some carry, right? Because when you say, wow, I need to make a greater than two, three, four, x in order at CSUN performance fee, then it is what probably happened in 3 hours is my understanding is you do these revenge trades where you take way more risk than perhaps your framework wants you to, and that's where things can really go.
00:55:37.624 - 00:55:38.736, Speaker A: That's where it gets really ugly.
00:55:38.840 - 00:55:46.988, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. And so that's something to. I mean, it's just inherent in a lot of. And a lot of hedge funds.
00:55:47.116 - 00:56:13.618, Speaker A: Yeah. On paper, yeah. I think it's all about the reputation risk, because on paper, it makes more sense for a manager to close the fund, liquidate all the assets, then raise another fund, purchase the same assets at a bargain price in a few weeks or months time, and actually profit from the revival of the crypto market. Technically, on paper, if you put it on an excel, it makes sense. You lose your reputation, though, and that's probably why folks don't end up doing this. I think the. It's really also important.
00:56:13.618 - 00:56:37.746, Speaker A: I think it was, Mark, you sco, sent this to Mike, um, or they talked about it on their podcast on the margin. But there's a stock loss recovery formula that people don't often understand. So if you lose 10%, if you're down 10%, you need the asset to go up 11% to make your money back. So. Right. Basically equal, basically the same. If you're down 20%, you need to recover 25%.
00:56:37.746 - 00:56:56.604, Speaker A: So again, similar numbers. And if you go down 50%, you need something to rise 100% to break even. The numbers get really drastic as you fall down to where we're at in this bear market. If you're down 70%, you need something to go up 233%. Right. So it's not equal. It's not like goes down 70%, comes up 70%.
00:56:56.604 - 00:57:03.164, Speaker A: If you're down 90%, you need something to go up 900%. And if you.
00:57:03.244 - 00:57:04.708, Speaker B: It's not a linear relationship.
00:57:04.796 - 00:57:16.784, Speaker A: It's not linear. Right. If you bought looks token at the top and you're down like it 98%, you have to. I think the percentage rises like 9900%.
00:57:17.164 - 00:57:19.596, Speaker B: That you need to come back to exponential relationship.
00:57:19.740 - 00:57:42.440, Speaker A: Yeah. So I think the formula is like, let's say you're down 80, 80%. It's like 80 divided by one. -80 over 100, I think, is the formula. So it's like percentage loss divided by one MinUS the percentage loss over 100. Basically, if you're down 70%, 80%, 90%, it is going to be a long time before you make money as a fund manager.
00:57:42.632 - 00:58:52.790, Speaker B: Now, of course, a lot of funds struggled with this in the last cycle, and some of them closed shop, others didn't and were able to, over time, raise money and weather the storm. And it made a, made like an outstanding return. Crypto markets have always surprised me. Anytime I think I understand them to some degree, I'm proven wrong and so do you believe? I think if you're a manager today in that seat, which is really tough, I think you're left wondering, are we going to continue to see these really outsized returns and great years that make up for this, or are we going to become more and more institutionalized and more competitive as more funds enter the space, as we saw last cycle, and just the ability to make outsized returns over time should compress. In the early days of private equity, the early funds like KKR and a few others, really made a killing. The first buyouts. But then over time, these returns get compressed.
00:58:52.790 - 00:59:09.702, Speaker B: Right. The asset class becomes more competitive. Now, I think crypto still has many, many, many years to run just by virtue of its less than a trillion dollar asset class. But still, I think you're left wondering what is going to be really the return potential, at scale, in size for a lot of these funds in the next cycle.
00:59:09.758 - 00:59:29.066, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, we'll keep an eye on it. I want to get into maker, actually, because there are two votes that are pretty interesting, and I think there's one vote that ends in about 20 minutes from now. So I'll pull that up. As I'm talking about it, governance shows its true colors during a bear. Right. And I think actually we talked about this.
00:59:29.130 - 00:59:30.054, Speaker B: What governance?
00:59:31.594 - 00:59:53.046, Speaker A: Well played, sir. Well played. So last week we talked very briefly about Solen spun up an emergency dow to appropriate money from a whale who is at the risk of being liquidated. Then I think they canceled the decision. Bancor suddenly removed impermanent loss protection from existing LP's who wanted to withdraw. Cosmos is in this intense discussion to approve. Like, I think it's a minuscule amount.
00:59:53.046 - 01:00:39.622, Speaker A: It's like five hundred k to invest in applications for liquid staking. Maker has two interesting votes going on right now. One is this highly contentious vote that is framed as VC's versus the community, where the VC's want to implement a new core unit that would function as a board of directors type structure that the quote unquote broader community argued was centralizing and against makers. Ethos Maker, for those who don't know, have these core units, which are basically like selected groups that are given a budget to oversee some aspect of the protocol, and core units help prevent this chaotic micro governance. They add efficiency to the process. It's actually gone quite well, from my understanding. I think 60% of the vote voted against the proposal, 40% voted in favor of the proposal.
01:00:39.622 - 01:01:15.870, Speaker A: I haven't dug into it too much, but that's one, one interesting proposal that I'm looking at as it just like, it brings the Dow almost more back to the structure of what a publicly traded company looks like. The next vote is. Hold on, let me pull this up, because I think the vote is happening in real time. Let's see. Maker is voting to invest 500 million into different investment strategies to help them get through the bear market. Let me pull this up. They are allocating to short term short US short treasuries, 80% allocation and investment grade corporate bonds, 20%.
01:01:15.870 - 01:01:32.714, Speaker A: So they're putting 400 million. Oh, the vote's going to pass. All right, 56%. All right, this vote, I think, is going to pass. So maker will put five out of 500 million, they'll put 400 million into uS short term treasuries, 100 million into investment grade corporate bonds. It's pretty interesting.
01:01:34.014 - 01:01:39.404, Speaker B: Yeah, I'd be curious, like, how they are actually going to invest that capital. Like which entity?
01:01:40.584 - 01:01:43.496, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, structurally, like this.
01:01:43.560 - 01:02:00.688, Speaker B: This is, in order to open an account as a dow, like, you need a, I mean, you need to like have a registered company. And I think they had dissolved the maker foundation at some point. So, yeah, I'm curious, like, how they are going to execute this proposal.
01:02:00.856 - 01:02:28.554, Speaker A: Well, we have, we have some folks from maker coming on the podcast, I think, next week or the week after. So that'll be really interesting time to talk to them about it. I love this. I think this helps them compete with USDC in the next bull market because you're becoming this like fiat collateralized stablecoin, which is, they're already holding a ton of USDC anyways. And honestly, with yields higher than zero now, it makes sense to hold t bills directly and get them yield rather.
01:02:28.594 - 01:02:34.428, Speaker B: Than only hold USDC treasuries are yielding more than defi rates.
01:02:34.586 - 01:02:35.484, Speaker A: Exactly.
01:02:35.864 - 01:03:21.214, Speaker B: Yeah, I would suspect a lot of credit. It's interesting that it passed. I would suspect, like a lot of, you know, I still remember in the early days of maker, there's like a very fierce debate around onboarding other types of collateral that are more centralized than pure ETH. And of course, when USDC, during March of 2020, during the COVID crash, where it was, it was a very precarious situation of the network and we, you know, the community voted to add USDC as collateral. It was very contentious. I think a lot of people, like, felt that that was a detraction from the original vision of maker, which has truly kind of decentralized money and censorship resistant. And now, of course, this is just moving the other direction.
01:03:21.214 - 01:03:43.394, Speaker B: So, yeah, I think it just goes to show, like, I think the people that are voting and have a lot of MKR are institutional players that are perhaps more practical and not as, I guess, idealistic as some folks are in crypto, which would want to probably go back to the original version of Maker, which was purely like single collateral die backed by ETH.
01:03:45.494 - 01:04:07.276, Speaker A: This is so. I love looking at the votes in real time. Like you can see Gauntlet abstained from the vote. They have 3% voting power. Penn Blockchain group, which is students and blockchain Columbia at Columbia both have 1% each. Flip side crypto has 9% of the vote. I just love Monet supply has 0.3%.
01:04:07.276 - 01:04:25.264, Speaker A: He voted just to do short term treasuries. Love looking at this stuff. It's really interesting. So, yeah, cool. What else? I feel like we have more to talk about. Santi. Oh, you know, you had some tweets I want to ask you about in terms of what will be the next catalyst for crypto.
01:04:25.264 - 01:05:04.074, Speaker A: Let me pull up your tweet. You said, what will be the next bull market catalyst in crypto 2008 to 2012 non sovereign store value aka bitcoin 2014 to 2017 digitally native global capital formation ICOs and ETH 2019 to 2021 decentralized programmable transfers of value defined NFTs 2023 to 2025 killer integrated apps, fun games. What's the update on the, like? A, like, why tweet this? What is the thought behind it? I know you love games, but like, why do you really do, like, is that, how strong is this conviction? And b, how do you play that when it's like, all right, invest in fun games, you know?
01:05:04.234 - 01:06:32.890, Speaker B: Yeah, I was thinking, and a few folks have asked me, like, what is going to trigger the next cycle? I think very much so. There were singular points that kind of detonated a cycle like, like started a bull market. Like, it was DeFi, like compound private liquidity mining ignited this whole interest in decentralized finance, and then nfts after that. Now, of course, it's unfair statement, because there's a lot that goes under the hood during a bear market, during periods that are quieter, in a not bull market that facilitate and are kind of prerequisites, I think, substrates in order to catalyze a bull market, you know what I mean? And so, like, NFTs existed for, like, cryptokitties, I think were marked the top last cycle because it just showed how unequipped these networks were to handle any degree of activity. We went back to a drawing board, and I think the first killer use case of Ethereum was DeFi and so looking back, this last cycle, I think was pretty interesting because DeFi was, I think, interesting, although not a lot of users, but nonetheless, I think still the core premise of DeFi is very much there and will work and I think has sparked the interest of traditional financial institutions. And it's not going to go away even if you strip away all the ponzonomics. That aside, there are some really exciting stuff in Defi and we shouldn't lose sight of that.
01:06:32.890 - 01:07:17.668, Speaker B: But that's not going to get us to the next, that's not going to get the next 100 million users excited, which I think is what you need to shoot for in the next cycle. And so I think it's a combination NFTs, I think was towards the end of this cycle. I think that obviously prices are down, volume is down, but I don't think the interest of a lot of brands and folks like Shopify and all this stuff goes away. So nfTs, I think we're just scratching the surface of what is possible. And so if you combine that with games, is what probably detonates the next cycle. I don't know. This is why I'm excited about games, because, again, I think, I hope and I think that the next cycle is where we get reasonable degree of mainstream adoption.
01:07:17.668 - 01:07:37.780, Speaker B: And I think that's going to come from a game. Yeah, probably. Most likely. It's definitely not going to be coming directly from DeFi protocol. Like, probably not. There might be high value transfers with DeFi, but I struggled to see a bull market, the start of a bull market being marked by DeFi. Think it comes from a really fun game.
01:07:37.892 - 01:07:43.220, Speaker A: Hmm. I mean, I think the start of the bull market won't actually have anything to do with anything inside of crypto.
01:07:43.252 - 01:07:49.184, Speaker B: It'll be just, I mean, like when the Fed decides to, like, you know, back off a bit and like, go back to risk on.
01:07:49.844 - 01:08:17.028, Speaker A: I mean, you basically, like the Fed. The, here's the narrative of the Fed until November, until the 2022 elections, is fighting inflation, right? Once. Unfortunately, I think the Dems will get absolutely smoked in November. So the Dems will most likely lose the House and the Senate, which creates this kind of like, lame duck two year period for the Biden administration. Nothing gets passed. It's all political energy gets focused on the narratives that play well with voters in 2024. American voters care about one thing, their money.
01:08:17.028 - 01:08:54.932, Speaker A: What do the Dems do? They have the one tool of pumping money into the markets. They juice the markets to try to win votes. The easiest way to accomplish that goal is to print money, and even though it hurts inflation in the long term, and while we just saw, we're seeing inflation play out, I think politicians are short minded and end up focusing on the 2024 elections. And the narrative of the Fed switches from fighting inflation to pumping money back into the markets. And I think that sparks basically just back to a risk on market where folks are investing in tech stocks and folks are investing in crypto, and money usually drives the narratives instead of the other way around.
01:08:55.068 - 01:09:01.676, Speaker B: Yeah, that's perhaps a more cynical view of crypto, which, by the way, I have been thinking about, as you know.
01:09:01.700 - 01:09:03.204, Speaker A: No, but it's everything. It's not just crypto.
01:09:03.244 - 01:09:05.991, Speaker B: No. Yeah. I mean, in many ways, it's like.
01:09:06.007 - 01:09:11.483, Speaker A: What'S the narrative around even big tech stocks right now? It's like, oh, they didn't work. I'm like, come on, guys.
01:09:11.983 - 01:10:07.040, Speaker B: Yeah, no, of course. I do think that we should probably take this time to focus on understanding, really, and doing some introspection and saying, what is it that we're working towards and what is the ultimate goal as a builder, as a founder, as a participant in this community. And I think in many ways, bear markets are quieter times to do some reflecting, not necessarily beat yourself up too much for what has happened, but certainly learn. And I think there is a lot, certain deficits that we need to patch in these systems. Scalability, probably top of mind. Privacy, better onboarding solutions, more transparency, more accountability, more self policing, better, um, you know, security, however, that you want to define that, whether it's better auditing systems or, you know, simulations, uh, to. To prevent users from being easily phished.
01:10:07.040 - 01:10:33.120, Speaker B: And keem, you know, I mean, like, there's a lot that needs to know we need to work on. And candidly, I don't look at that, and I'm like, if you're listening to this and you think, God, that sounds so difficult to overcome, I'm like, honestly, I mean, that. That is the opportunity. And that was what inspired this tweet is like, there is, I think, a lot of stuff that needs to be built. Look at it. Look at it this way. If you're running a steel mill, there's not a lot in the industry other than maybe making.
01:10:33.120 - 01:11:01.604, Speaker B: Scraping a little, like, margin out there and being, like, right on some stuff, but there's not a lot of innovation needs to happen. I think this is just the excitement in this industry. It's so early and increasingly, prices also reflect that even more. But there is a lot of stuff that needs to be built. And so that is the opportunity that is, I guess it goes to the best companies. Chris Dixon had a great tweet about this is the best. Companies typically tend to be built during times like this.
01:11:01.604 - 01:11:18.242, Speaker B: And so I'm not demoralized in any way. I think I'm going to be as you know, active in trying to find those people that are looking to come into the space and build this stuff, which is exciting. It's hard. Smart people want to work on difficult problems.
01:11:18.378 - 01:11:40.174, Speaker A: Yeah, it is hard. I mean, look, zooming out using bitcoin as a proxy for the industry, its grown at an eleven year rate of two and a half times a year. Right. Were in a short term bear market here and anyone whos owned bitcoin over for a three year period has made money throughout history. And the Internet itself is 50 years old. We have decades more to go for this to work. I told you I was going to talk about Defi.
01:11:40.174 - 01:12:11.728, Speaker A: I think it is so impressive what DeFi has been able to do in the last few months when all hell is breaking loose in crypto. I know yields are really low, but yields were artificially pumped high. Defi is working so well right now. The smart contracts are executing. I think now is the time to rediscover. I think it was Arthur Hayes who said this. The merits of category defining Defi projects and dapps that have been dumped indiscriminately alongside this, as he put it, not my words.
01:12:11.728 - 01:12:42.424, Speaker A: Copy pasta trash. Right? There exists a universe of projects that are like category leaders that will allow us to build an entirely new decentralized financial system. They're down like 80% to 95% from their late 2021 all time highs. They have actual users that spend real capital to access the services. And they are the first projects that have defined how like key defi services should be offered. And I don't know, I just, I'm really excited about some of these like old school blue chip defi projects right now.
01:12:42.964 - 01:13:35.130, Speaker B: I totally agree with you. There is, this is, I mean, it's a way, I think the name of the game and is surviving and having the possibility to be in a position of strength no matter what kind of market conditions we're in. And I think there's a lot of things to be excited about. I think there will be a lot of cleanup that needs to happen in this space. We're going to have some good episodes coming up that talk about a lot of the things that need to happen on the regulatory side, making sure that regulators understand the distinction between defi and non defi Celsius is different than maker, much different than Ave and compound. And I think we've done a lot of progress over the last couple of years, and I think there's a really good adage in crypto that says, I think we should measure the progress of this industry at the bottom of the progressive kind of bottoms of the subsequent cycles. Right.
01:13:35.130 - 01:14:09.644, Speaker B: And I think if we look back, have we bought them? Not sure, but we've made some really tangible progress in the last three years, four years, and more importantly, we've ignited and sparked interest in crypto from people that had no business, no interest in crypto, particularly nfts and games. And. And so anyways, we should continue to. Not a ramble. We should continue to be always very skeptical. I think people are now increasingly, increasingly skeptical. Maybe like it's a difference between being skeptical and cynical.
01:14:09.644 - 01:14:51.822, Speaker B: I think we should always be very skeptical. But cynicism kind of doesn't. Kind of being a cynic to me is just someone like, that's on the sidelines. It's like your economics professor, right? He teaches you about risk, but the guy has never invested, or him or she has never invested in the stock market, has never been 2 seconds away from being liquidated. And, you know, like, this problem that I had in school is like, how the hell am I supposed to learn from someone that doesn't have practical experience? And so the nice thing about crypto is, yeah, sometimes you learn through experience and by fire or, you know, learning from others. And so I think that's the beauty of this space, is I think the rate of innovation is much faster in open source systems. Everything is kind of out there.
01:14:51.822 - 01:15:31.884, Speaker B: And so we learn from these mistakes. Cycles probably are compressed, and that's, I think the exciting part here is, and I hope is that this is true. And tell me if you disagree, is the rate of innovation is much faster in open source systems, and so maybe the rate of adoption won't be. And I think that may have been one of the errors that I constantly challenge. My own assumption is you may be building stuff, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the adoption is going to be faster than historically. Like a lot of these technological revolutions, like the Internet really in earnest, took like 20 years to reach pretty decent adoption. Crypto is only ten years in.
01:15:31.884 - 01:15:46.996, Speaker B: Does this mean that it's going to take 20 years or is it around the corner? Probably it's going to take 1520 years. Right. But there's going to be rapid, chaotic innovation. And some of that is certainly being felt right now.
01:15:47.140 - 01:16:07.048, Speaker A: Those are some big numbers. Santi 1020 years. Let's talk about the next couple of weeks. We have some really good episodes coming out. There are a lot of new listeners. We had a, this is the most record, I think it was a record week last week, record month for the podcast and the biggest down, the biggest, most downloaded episodes we've ever had. So a lot of new folks, if you aren't subscribed, subscribe to the show.
01:16:07.048 - 01:16:29.240, Speaker A: Hear the upcoming episodes. We have sunny from osmosis and Derek from reverie coming out on Monday talking about osmosis and cosmos. Super interesting episode. We have Eric Peters coming up after that. We have Jan, the founder of step in, Matthew Ball. For those who are into the metaverse, uh, Matthew Ball is probably the smartest person on the metaverse out there. We've got Eric Voorhees, we've got Bill Barheit, we've got Dan Matuszewski from CMS.
01:16:29.240 - 01:16:41.444, Speaker A: We've got the head of trading at one of the largest market makers in crypto. We've got Sam from maker and Monet supply coming on insane episodes. Hit the subscribe, toss us a. Like, Santa, you want to throw out a book book recommendation?
01:16:42.064 - 01:17:02.656, Speaker B: So, speaking of. Yeah, this is pretty awesome. I picked it up, it's the world for sale, and it talks about the evolution of the commodity trading business. And, and yeah, it's pretty like oil, aluminum, gold, a lot of these. And so it's pretty interesting book. I'm halfway through it and so far it hasn't. Disappointed.
01:17:02.656 - 01:17:06.160, Speaker B: So again, the world for sale. Pretty awesome.
01:17:06.272 - 01:17:07.084, Speaker A: By who?
01:17:08.944 - 01:17:12.352, Speaker B: Javier Blass and Jack Farsi.
01:17:12.488 - 01:17:16.828, Speaker A: I have a wreck for you. It is a non financial book. Here's my, here's, by the way, none.
01:17:16.836 - 01:17:18.024, Speaker B: Of this financial advice.
01:17:19.444 - 01:17:35.156, Speaker A: This is financial advice. Go spend $15 on the over story. It is a not finance book. It is actually like kind of. It just, it's. This guy explores our nate, our relationship with trees, which sounds so freaking boring, I know, but it makes you zoom out. And it's a bunch of short stories.
01:17:35.156 - 01:17:47.694, Speaker A: And in each short story there's like, trees are embedded into each short story. And it just, I don't know, makes you zoom out and think about like, our perception, our perception of time and why we're so bad at acting on climate change and the meaning of hope and things like that.
01:17:47.814 - 01:17:49.662, Speaker B: Trees are decentralized networks.
01:17:49.798 - 01:17:50.854, Speaker A: They are. They are.
01:17:50.934 - 01:17:54.834, Speaker B: By the way, what is, what is your favorite tree? What is your favorite tree? I have two.
01:17:55.414 - 01:17:57.062, Speaker A: I don't have a favorite tree. What's your favorite?
01:17:57.078 - 01:18:00.134, Speaker B: What are you talking about? You just shilled a book about trees and you don't even have a favorite tree?
01:18:00.174 - 01:18:03.694, Speaker A: No, that's a redwood. It's the redwood. I grew up outside San Francisco, so I.
01:18:03.734 - 01:18:04.150, Speaker B: There you go.
01:18:04.182 - 01:18:05.230, Speaker A: I would go hiking with my mom.
01:18:05.262 - 01:18:14.776, Speaker B: To the redwood because, by the way, these are, like, century old trees, right? They're super slender, not less sequoias. And they are in one of the more, like, majestic places, like, near the coastline. Oh, yeah. Western us.
01:18:14.840 - 01:18:17.200, Speaker A: It's insane. Hundreds of years old. Yeah.
01:18:17.312 - 01:18:17.672, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:18:17.728 - 01:18:18.776, Speaker A: What's your favorite tree?
01:18:18.880 - 01:18:21.672, Speaker B: Oh, redwoods and bonsai trees.
01:18:21.808 - 01:18:22.576, Speaker A: Oh, bonsai.
01:18:22.640 - 01:18:23.624, Speaker B: Yeah, bonsai.
01:18:23.744 - 01:18:25.004, Speaker A: Do you have a bonsai?
01:18:25.784 - 01:18:26.724, Speaker B: Not here.
01:18:27.104 - 01:18:27.800, Speaker A: Not here. Where?
01:18:27.832 - 01:18:28.280, Speaker B: In the metaverse.
01:18:28.312 - 01:18:30.644, Speaker A: Another house in the metaverse?
01:18:31.824 - 01:18:40.034, Speaker B: Yeah. I actually have a bunch of bonsai, like, bonsai nfts. This is one of the earlier mints. And I like aped in because I like bonsai.
01:18:40.534 - 01:18:44.158, Speaker A: Bonsai. I love it. Bonsai. Bonsai trees go back thousands of years.
01:18:44.206 - 01:18:50.478, Speaker B: Yeah. Honestly, like, speaking of travel, which you can travel more now, but the airlines suck now.
01:18:50.526 - 01:18:53.606, Speaker A: These days. I think they're preparing 1600 layoffs this week.
01:18:53.670 - 01:19:11.994, Speaker B: It's crazy. I mean, don't even get me started. I miss permission. This because of travel. I dread traveling now because every person that I talk to now has had a negative experience at airports with airlines or luggage getting lost, all this stuff. So flight delays getting canceled. Nonetheless, if you ever get the chance.
01:19:11.994 - 01:19:32.234, Speaker B: And I went to Defcon, the last Defcon was in Osaka. Japan is a magical place. Like, these gardens, meditation gardens, are unreal, like, just out of this world. And the vegetation in Japan is, like, incredible. And if you don't want to go to Japan, just watch, like the last samurai or whatever, and just observe the gardens and the vegetation because I think it's so peaceful.
01:19:32.794 - 01:19:33.538, Speaker A: I love it.
01:19:33.626 - 01:19:34.546, Speaker B: Zen gardens.
01:19:34.690 - 01:19:35.770, Speaker A: Zen gardens.
01:19:35.962 - 01:19:44.634, Speaker B: Anyways, hope everyone's Zen out there and not liquidated, and go for a walk. Enjoy the fourth and keep your head up.
01:19:44.794 - 01:19:45.770, Speaker A: Be well, sir.
01:19:45.922 - 01:19:48.114, Speaker B: Thank you. Thanks, everyone for listening. See you next time.
