00:00:44.454 - 00:00:56.354, Speaker B: Welcome back everyone, to Empire. We have a very special guest, which she has been on the pod, but this was pre, you know, before my time. It's been a while, but Casey, it's great to have you back.
00:00:56.654 - 00:00:58.518, Speaker C: Hi. Thank you so much for having me.
00:00:58.606 - 00:01:01.512, Speaker B: So, for introductions, tell us what you do at blockworks, because.
00:01:01.608 - 00:01:07.296, Speaker C: Yeah, definitely, I'm a senior reporter. I COVID policy and regulation, which is.
00:01:07.320 - 00:01:09.304, Speaker B: Really not an interesting topic in crypto at all.
00:01:09.344 - 00:01:28.244, Speaker C: Not at all. I was going to say for the first year, there was nothing to write about. For the last year and a half, there's been a ton to write about. So, yeah, it's been a lot of fun. It's definitely a contentious area of the industry. Everyone wants to go on record saying that they welcome regulation and we'll see how it all plays out.
00:01:28.784 - 00:01:37.184, Speaker B: That's awesome. Well, I hear you've been camping out in the southern district of New York as of this week. So tell us what's going on there.
00:01:37.344 - 00:02:00.104, Speaker C: Yeah, so yeah, I'm based in Manhattan. Sam Bankman Fried's trial is happening in the southern district of New York, which is downtown. It's actually down the street from Trump's New York Supreme Court trial. So the security has been absolutely insane. So much pressure in the entire area, it's pretty wild. But I am there for Sam's trial. It started on Tuesday.
00:02:00.104 - 00:02:19.084, Speaker C: I've gotten there before 06:00 a.m. Every morning. I think the first morning I showed up a little before 430, and I was not the first person in line. So that kind of shows you what the interest has been and, you know, people from the general public and also media trying to get in and see what's going on.
00:02:19.204 - 00:02:24.750, Speaker B: That's a while. So what's getting more attention to Trump or the SBF trial?
00:02:24.902 - 00:03:04.060, Speaker C: I would say in terms of. So the media camps out. They have, and by media I mean, like, the news trucks with the cameras and the crews, and they have these big tents so they can camp out across the street. There's, like, barriers on how close they can get to try to get photos. In Trump's case of Trump walking through, but the attorneys and everything in Sam's trial, because he's currently in custody. When he comes to court every day from Brooklyn, where he's in jail, they transport him underground so he doesn't actually walk past the photographers, but Trump does. So in terms of the media camp out, I would say Trump definitely has more interest there just because you'll actually see him.
00:03:04.060 - 00:03:20.250, Speaker C: But on the Sam side, there, there are a lot of cameras. There's a ton of people just trying to get photos of his attorneys or any witnesses that might walk by. And they're actually, they're selling for like, dollar 500 each. So if anyone has some free time and wants to head down to Fydeye, then maybe that's a good idea.
00:03:20.412 - 00:03:30.070, Speaker B: Okay, well, let's start like. So who's actually showing up? Is it mostly crypto reporters, crypto media, or is it just the full gamut?
00:03:30.222 - 00:04:05.612, Speaker C: Yeah, it's a good question. I would say mostly crypto, but there are a lot of mainstream outlets to Bloomberg, the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times. The New York Times actually flew someone here from California to cover the trial. They're staying here for a few weeks monitoring everything. And there's a few other publications, the Verge, Wired. It's this intersection of tech, white collar, crime, finance, and crypto. So it is kind of fun to see some different beats converge.
00:04:05.612 - 00:04:13.236, Speaker C: And there are also just some general court reporters, people that just cover crime in the southern district. So it's a fun little mix for sure.
00:04:13.300 - 00:04:21.045, Speaker B: Got it. And so basically, you have to get there, like at four or five in the morning, 06:00 in the morning, to be actually, because they limit the number of people that can go into the courtroom.
00:04:21.189 - 00:04:48.054, Speaker C: Yes. So, like I said, I got there a little before 430 on Tuesday, and I think I was like, third in line. I wasn't even first, which is pretty wild. But, yeah, it's all first come, first serve basis. You line up, you go through security. You're not allowed to bring, unless you're an attorney or a clerk or something, you're not allowed to bring a cell phone or any electronics. So, like AirPods, computer charger, computer, anything, it all has to get checked in through security.
00:04:48.054 - 00:05:14.814, Speaker C: And then you wait in line until a Marshall tells you where to go, the actual courtroom. It kind of surprised me. It's not that big. And there are a lot of reserved seats for counsel, for defendant's family. Sam's mom is there with a few people that have been sitting with her every day. I don't know exactly who they are, but these are all seats that are reserved that media cannot sit in and the public cannot sit in. So it is.
00:05:14.814 - 00:05:18.806, Speaker C: It's pretty limited in terms of how many seats there actually are for the public.
00:05:18.950 - 00:05:41.996, Speaker B: Got it. So let's. I mean, I'd love for this episode to be really just to recap of everything that's been going on this week, because I understand there was, you know, the. What is it? The panel got selected this week, including. Yeah, the jury, including, like, I think there's one from inside partners, which is an investor, but she wasn't part of the deal team, which I. And she said there's no conflict, which I find bizarre.
00:05:42.140 - 00:05:45.224, Speaker C: Yeah. She was actually dismissed, which is good.
00:05:45.964 - 00:05:46.868, Speaker B: Okay, good.
00:05:46.956 - 00:06:07.512, Speaker C: Yeah. But there. So I saw the whole selection process. That's what started on Tuesday. I've never been called for jury duty, but those who have know that it's not a super fun process. Everyone was trying to get out of it. So what they do for these massive cases that are a little bit more public, there's been a ton of media coverage.
00:06:07.512 - 00:06:41.728, Speaker C: They're expecting it to last six weeks. That's not a typical case for a typical jury. So they do bring in a pretty big pool because they know that so many people will have to be weeded out. So they do it in batches, about 50 at a time. The judge will go through and ask a series of questions that the prosecution and the defense have agreed to. And this is everything from, like, what do you do for work to have you ever invested in crypto? They even asked if people had seen that 60 minutes story that aired last Sunday, the Michael Lewis book. A lot of people had seen it.
00:06:41.728 - 00:07:02.448, Speaker C: So that was something that I assume the defense wanted to know about. They ask about knowledge of crypto, all sorts of stuff, just to kind of weed out people. Each side gets a set number of vetoes for no reason. So they can just say, I do not want number five, and that's fine. Obviously, they can't do that for everyone.
00:07:02.576 - 00:07:02.936, Speaker B: Right.
00:07:03.000 - 00:07:30.844, Speaker C: So it's kind of a back and forth process. Some people immediately get out if, you know, there's a medical condition. Sometimes they have childcare. There's all sorts of reasons that people can tell the judge about, and the judge will determine whether or not they're dismissed based on that reason someone said that she has two toddlers and she can't get childcare. Someone lived, I don't know, like a three hour commute or something that was just going to be completely unfeasible for her to come for six weeks.
00:07:32.094 - 00:07:40.358, Speaker B: Was there a common denominator of things that would immediately. Well, not immediately, but would dismiss you or people that. Yeah.
00:07:40.526 - 00:08:10.876, Speaker C: Yeah, that's a good question. One person stood up and said, I think the question was about conflicts. So I think he stood up to say that he had travel booked at some point in November, which the trial is expected to go around until Thanksgiving. So he said that he might not be here. And then he added that he doesn't know a lot about crypto, but everything he's heard since he learned about it has been bad. And he doesn't like crypto. So that kind of immediately got him out.
00:08:10.876 - 00:08:26.584, Speaker C: Two people actually mentioned Bernie Madoff. Kind of just off handed, like, I don't know anything about this case, but I know about Bernie Madoff, and I know people are comparing Sam to him. So that's the bias that I'm walking into the situation with. They were immediately kicked off.
00:08:27.034 - 00:08:29.602, Speaker B: Not veto, just the judge dismissed them.
00:08:29.698 - 00:08:31.810, Speaker C: Yes. Well, actually, we don't really know.
00:08:31.962 - 00:08:32.418, Speaker B: Okay.
00:08:32.466 - 00:08:40.066, Speaker C: A lot of this happens in sidebar. Some of it will get published with the transcripts, but not all of it is public.
00:08:40.250 - 00:08:46.370, Speaker B: Yeah. And you can't. You don't know who's being vetoed versus who's being just dismissed by the judge.
00:08:46.482 - 00:08:50.674, Speaker C: Well, we know who will not come back for, like, the next round, I guess.
00:08:50.714 - 00:08:53.956, Speaker B: Right? Yeah. But you don't know if it was vetoed by the defendant.
00:08:53.980 - 00:08:54.268, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:08:54.316 - 00:08:54.500, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:08:54.532 - 00:09:02.784, Speaker C: We don't know. We can assume. And there are cases where the judge does it retroactively. Got it. What else?
00:09:03.124 - 00:09:07.132, Speaker B: And so that was jury selection has already been established. Like they already found.
00:09:07.308 - 00:09:26.740, Speaker C: Yes. So that took all day Tuesday and then most of the morning on Wednesday. Yeah. One potential juror actually was married to someone that represents FTX in. In the bankruptcy lawsuit, ironically. So they were dismissed. But of the jury, we're left with.
00:09:26.740 - 00:09:50.616, Speaker C: So there's 18 total. It's twelve that will sit on the jury and then six alternates. There are nine women and three men. Of the twelve, it's a lot of diversity. There's a pretty diverse range of education, too. It goes all the way from high school to, I believe there's a few masters. Someone has a nursing degree.
00:09:50.616 - 00:10:08.804, Speaker C: A couple nursing degrees, actually. There's a librarian. There is a special education teacher. There is one former banker. So that's, I believe, the only kind of financial connection. All different ages. I think it goes from, like, 22 to 70 something.
00:10:09.144 - 00:10:15.832, Speaker B: Yeah. Presumably if you had used FTX, FTX us in this case, like, you would have been dismissed.
00:10:15.968 - 00:10:16.682, Speaker C: Yes.
00:10:16.848 - 00:10:18.754, Speaker B: Because if you, then you're a creditor and.
00:10:19.534 - 00:10:33.154, Speaker C: Yeah, so those were all kind of part of those general questions at the very beginning, when it was a pool of, like, 100 people, they asked everyone if anyone had ever invested in crypto. I think like, three people rose their hands, and out of 100. Yeah.
00:10:33.734 - 00:10:36.006, Speaker B: So, folks, we're still early.
00:10:36.190 - 00:10:38.942, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, we are. Very early. Very early.
00:10:39.078 - 00:10:40.862, Speaker B: Gosh, three out of 100.
00:10:41.038 - 00:10:49.150, Speaker C: And they were not necessarily the most savvy because the judge then asked if they had made or lost money, and every single one had lost money, so.
00:10:49.302 - 00:10:50.074, Speaker B: Gosh.
00:10:50.774 - 00:10:52.954, Speaker C: Need some more trading advice.
00:10:53.254 - 00:11:07.070, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay. And so, I mean, my understanding in all this is really just based off of suits of what happens in these courtrooms. Assume it's, like, more boring than Harvey's showing you.
00:11:07.222 - 00:11:11.502, Speaker C: I gave myself a little mini law degree in the month leading up to this trial, so.
00:11:11.598 - 00:11:14.198, Speaker B: Okay, so this was your first time actually going into one of these?
00:11:14.246 - 00:11:20.546, Speaker C: It was my first time covering a trial in person. Yeah, we've covered the ripple suits. We've done other legal stuff, but actually in the courtroom.
00:11:20.570 - 00:11:24.402, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, but this is criminal. Right. And the other ones are civil. Yeah.
00:11:24.538 - 00:11:25.294, Speaker C: Yes.
00:11:25.594 - 00:11:54.044, Speaker B: So the jury was selected. Any highlights? I mean, of course, you mentioned the diversity of the panel and whatnot, but as, like, an aside, like, during all this process, I mean, people should remember that. The reason I think SPF was put into custody is because he was trying to do, like, witness tampering. Meaning, like, reaching out to FTX employees that he thought were, like, you know, being put into witness protection and whatnot. Yes. You know, look, it's a very high profile case. But out of curiosity, how.
00:11:54.044 - 00:12:03.704, Speaker B: How, like, how are the jurors, like, protected from being bribed, being breached out to. I mean, I'm curious if you know how that works.
00:12:03.744 - 00:12:26.224, Speaker C: Yeah, no, that's a good question. In some cases, they're sequestered. In this case, they're not. They are given very strict instructions from the judge not to consume any media. They're not allowed to read any books, podcasts, news, anything relating to the trial, which I'm sure is pretty difficult. I mean, if you turn on the local news in New York City right now, like, people are talking about it.
00:12:26.604 - 00:12:34.636, Speaker B: I mean, you've got to imagine these people are, like, googling, like, FTP I mean, like. And then, like, the way the algorithm works, guys, is you're going to be retarded.
00:12:34.820 - 00:12:35.598, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:12:35.716 - 00:12:35.946, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:12:35.970 - 00:12:50.130, Speaker C: In today's world, also, they're not allowed to speak to anyone about it. So, like, if you come home from jury duty to your wife, you can't tell her what you. You're not supposed to tell her what you did all day, which, in my head just seems difficult and also unlikely. I feel like they have to.
00:12:50.162 - 00:12:54.858, Speaker B: I'm not really curious if divorce rates go for people that have been selected.
00:12:55.026 - 00:13:07.478, Speaker C: Yeah, that is another question they ask every potential juror who they live with and if they have children. So some people live with spouses. Some people live with boyfriends or roommates. And that's all part of it, too.
00:13:07.566 - 00:13:08.270, Speaker B: Okay.
00:13:08.422 - 00:13:21.766, Speaker C: It's funny. It's funny the stuff that they consider and to kind of try to imagine what the prosecution's thinking, like, who might be someone that would really find Sam guilty or on the defense side, who they think would be more sympathetic. There's a lot of psychology that goes into it.
00:13:21.830 - 00:13:27.766, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. Okay, well, okay, so that happened, and from there, what has been going on?
00:13:27.790 - 00:13:52.684, Speaker C: I guess so then it is opening statements, which is, I would say, closer to, like, the tv version of a courtroom drama. This is. It's not evidence. So nothing they say the jury can take is fact, but they can say whatever they want, and they can pretty much speak as long as they want. The prosecution, I think, went for about 25 minutes. The defense was a little bit longer, maybe like 35 minutes. Prosecution goes first.
00:13:52.684 - 00:14:12.384, Speaker C: So in a criminal case, the prosecution, the government, they are the one that have the burden of proof. So they have to present the case beyond a reasonable doubt to the jury. The defense legally doesn't have to do anything. They don't have to present a case. They don't have to cross examine. They don't have to do anything. So the government starts.
00:14:12.384 - 00:14:40.394, Speaker C: Their opening statement was pretty on message with what I think most of us would have expected. You know, they said the word stole a lot. They kept saying that Sam stole billions of dollars from thousands of people. They mentioned a, quote, lavish lifestyle, that he used all of this money to fund his celebrity friends and penthouses and beachfront properties and everything that he was doing.
00:14:40.554 - 00:14:43.174, Speaker B: Yes, folks, he was not driving a KIa.
00:14:45.074 - 00:14:50.640, Speaker C: It's pretty funny. I'll skip ahead for this one little tidbit. He actually drove Corolla.
00:14:50.712 - 00:14:55.152, Speaker B: Oh, sorry. Corolla. Yes. Yes. Yes. That was. That was the facade, you know?
00:14:55.208 - 00:15:01.424, Speaker C: Yes. Yes. It was the Corolla that was parked in the parking garage of the $35 million apartment.
00:15:01.544 - 00:15:03.128, Speaker B: Right. Yeah, of course. You know.
00:15:03.216 - 00:15:28.568, Speaker C: Yeah, obviously, no. The defense had asked one of the witnesses who worked at FTX if they knew what kind of car Sam drove. The witness said, no. The attorney then said, well, did you ever see a Toyota Corolla around? And the judge immediately stopped the questioning and said, I think everyone's seen a Toyota Corolla. Like, this is a ridiculous line of questioning. You can't say that. Move on.
00:15:28.568 - 00:15:30.352, Speaker C: So that was pretty funny, to be fair.
00:15:30.408 - 00:15:41.504, Speaker B: Like, in this particular compound in Bahamas is, like, uber wealthy and so, like, presumably insanely wealthy. Yeah. So, like, you know, it's not like San Francisco lots where you see Prius and.
00:15:41.624 - 00:15:43.816, Speaker C: Exactly. I'm sure it stuck out.
00:15:43.960 - 00:15:45.764, Speaker B: Yeah. But. Okay.
00:15:46.104 - 00:16:33.164, Speaker C: Anyway, so opening statements, prosecution, I think, really on message for what we expected. They really honed in on Sam doing this secretly. They tried to kind of allude to him being the brains of the operation. He had all of these secret channels. He knew about these secret ways that he could funnel money from FTX through Alameda to Alameda through different code loopholes, and he was the one facilitating all of it. They mentioned, they alluded to Caroline Ellison. They didn't actually name her, but they said that Sam's on again, off again girlfriend was involved, that he put her in a position of power despite personal relationships.
00:16:33.164 - 00:16:46.934, Speaker C: They were really trying to paint a picture of a company that was very unstable, that Sam was completely in control over, but also that had no boundaries and protections.
00:16:47.314 - 00:16:49.854, Speaker B: Got it. And so that was the government?
00:16:50.234 - 00:16:51.330, Speaker C: That was the government.
00:16:51.482 - 00:16:54.134, Speaker B: And how's the defense statement?
00:16:57.354 - 00:17:34.104, Speaker C: Personally, I thought that they did the best they could. I mean, it's an uphill battle for them. Speaking to other people in the courtroom afterwards and stuff. People were pretty disappointed in their opening statement, but the gist of what they said was Sam was just a regular guy. His attorney said that he was just a math nerd who didn't drink and didn't party. He said that Sam had really tried to urge Caroline Ellison to hedge her bets and not be too risky, but she just didn't listen. He said that he kept.
00:17:34.104 - 00:17:56.124, Speaker C: FTX was a startup. He kept saying, you know, it just grew so quickly. He said, working at a startup is like building a plane while you're flying it. And he said that a risk management system or risk management officer department was just part of the plane that never got built at FTX. So I thought it was interesting that he.
00:17:56.284 - 00:17:58.684, Speaker B: $40 billion startup without a risk management.
00:17:58.844 - 00:18:37.570, Speaker C: Exactly. Yeah. I mean, he mentioned twice, I think that there was no risk officer, risk team, which seems strange for the defense to mention that, but, yeah. The picture that I got from what he was trying to say, what he's trying to present, was that Sam didn't know what was going on. He thought that whatever channels were being used to move whatever money was something that everyone was doing and everyone was aware of, it wasn't something that he did in secret. It wasn't something that he directed people to do, and the market just crashed.
00:18:37.642 - 00:19:02.714, Speaker B: Yeah, let me put a pause on that, because do we actually, like, we probably have an.org chart, and if you're a venture investor, you had an.org chart at your disposal in these pitch decks, which are, you know, Matt Huang, I think it can be also called into question. And he's a witness, I guess. And so these things are under discovery. Like, I'm pretty sure. I mean, they had a legal team, an in house legal counsel.
00:19:02.714 - 00:19:08.134, Speaker B: Right. And did they just claim that they didn't have a compliance department or a risk management department or.
00:19:08.434 - 00:19:10.450, Speaker C: That's a good question, because that seems.
00:19:10.482 - 00:19:14.386, Speaker B: Like, factually incorrect from everything that I know.
00:19:14.570 - 00:19:17.682, Speaker C: So you think that investors were told that they did have a risk?
00:19:17.818 - 00:19:38.152, Speaker B: I mean, like, I met Sam even before he built FTX, and there was a guy in there who presumably was a compliance guy and look anything like a compliance guy that you would think like, the archetype of compliance. It was like a tattooed guy from Australia. I'm like, this guy doesn't know anything about compliance. And I come from banking. I know how compliance people look. And he didn't have a semblance of what a chinese wall was. Interesting.
00:19:38.208 - 00:19:38.848, Speaker C: Okay. I don't.
00:19:38.896 - 00:19:43.632, Speaker B: So, I mean, like, you know, this predates FTX.
00:19:43.808 - 00:19:46.336, Speaker C: No, no, that's. That's something that we should all be.
00:19:46.360 - 00:19:49.232, Speaker B: Watching for, but usually easily fat. Check that. Like, you know.
00:19:49.288 - 00:19:49.624, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:19:49.704 - 00:19:50.644, Speaker B: Like the website.
00:19:51.424 - 00:20:06.780, Speaker C: Yeah. No, the government has not yet claimed that he misled investors in that way. I imagine that they probably will. Matt is also taking the stand, either late this afternoon for a little bit, if not definitely tomorrow.
00:20:06.892 - 00:20:19.708, Speaker B: For context, Matt, partner, co founder of formerly a Sequoia, started paradigm, paradigm investing and was part of, I think, one of the earlier rounds for FDX. Not super early, but they were involved fairly early on.
00:20:19.756 - 00:20:30.292, Speaker C: Yes. Yeah. I imagine that he'll speak more about Sequoia's involvement, but we'll have to see what the government wants. And he's a witness for the government, I should add.
00:20:30.428 - 00:20:47.946, Speaker B: Okay, got it. Got it. Okay. Anything. So I guess those were the opening statements. Anything else worth noting for those opening statements? Or. I guess the consensus was that the defense was pretty weak in portraying Sam was, like, this nerd guy.
00:20:47.946 - 00:20:51.098, Speaker B: He didn't know anything was going on, and everything was doing, you know, as a startup.
00:20:51.146 - 00:21:23.550, Speaker C: And, yeah, I was speaking with an attorney after Tuesday, I guess, after opening statements, and he said that in a lot of these white collar cases, we kind of saw it with Elizabeth Holmes. The defense is, either this person was so far at the top, they didn't know what was going on, or this person was so far at the bottom, they didn't know what was going on. And it kind of seems like his defense, Sam's defense, is taking the top approach. So we'll see. We'll see.
00:21:23.622 - 00:21:32.734, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay. Should we. I mean, where should we go next? Like, should we talk about what happened after that? Should we talk about the witnesses that are gonna.
00:21:32.894 - 00:21:59.442, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. So we don't know who exactly will testify. The government has to present the defense with a master list of all of the potential witnesses, and we don't know if they'll be called or not. So Sam's father and brother are both on that list, which is why they are not in the courtroom. If you are a potential witness, if you might be called to the stand.
00:21:59.498 - 00:22:01.974, Speaker B: You'Re not allowed to watch the and so mother bar.
00:22:02.354 - 00:22:02.834, Speaker C: His mother.
00:22:02.874 - 00:22:04.880, Speaker B: Is there not a witness then, or.
00:22:04.992 - 00:22:06.288, Speaker C: He'S not a witness? Yes.
00:22:06.336 - 00:22:07.016, Speaker B: Interesting. Okay.
00:22:07.040 - 00:22:30.974, Speaker C: He's in court, so, yeah, we'll see. And I. And I know I'm not as well versed in his parents legal situation. I know that they have something else going on, but, yeah, his mother has been in court every day. She seems fine. She's been taking notes, not really showing a super strong expression. I will say at one point today, I looked over, and she had her head kind of in her hands, but she didn't last.
00:22:30.974 - 00:22:34.626, Speaker C: She didn't stay in that position very long. She kind of quickly recovered, I guess.
00:22:34.650 - 00:22:38.218, Speaker B: While we're at it, like, this body language stuff, like, sam's there. How close are you?
00:22:38.226 - 00:22:39.098, Speaker C: Just Sam is there.
00:22:39.186 - 00:22:41.186, Speaker B: Maybe we should have started the episode there. Like, how close?
00:22:41.290 - 00:22:52.826, Speaker C: No, we should have. Well, I was joking with. When I asked her producer about coming on the show, I was like, I am the closest thing you have to Sam Bankman fried right now. So that's what I got. I'm about three rows behind him.
00:22:52.850 - 00:22:57.698, Speaker B: I wouldn't lead with that in normal conversations, but for the purposes of this podcast, it's fantastic.
00:22:57.826 - 00:23:00.914, Speaker C: Yes, yes. Outside of this world.
00:23:00.994 - 00:23:04.546, Speaker B: Right? Yeah. So how close are you? What? 20, you know, 20ft?
00:23:04.570 - 00:23:07.378, Speaker C: Yeah, maybe 1015ft.
00:23:07.466 - 00:23:15.994, Speaker B: Wow. I heard that he looked thinner, but he still had his, like, scruffy, kind of like disorganized look to him, per usual.
00:23:16.114 - 00:23:16.530, Speaker C: Yes.
00:23:16.602 - 00:23:17.258, Speaker B: Is that true?
00:23:17.346 - 00:23:34.418, Speaker C: Definitely thinner. I haven't seen him in person in probably a year and a half. So it is kind of hard to tell, but definitely thinner. He looks really, really pale. I don't know if that's something that's new or something that he's always been. He did get a haircut. I'm sure you saw that.
00:23:34.418 - 00:23:44.954, Speaker C: That was very big news. The haircut. Actually, he, fellow inmate gave it to him ahead of court, so his defense wanted us to know that.
00:23:45.114 - 00:23:46.514, Speaker B: Wait, wait, what was that?
00:23:46.674 - 00:23:49.874, Speaker C: His defense actually leaked that to another.
00:23:49.954 - 00:23:52.264, Speaker B: Reporter that, who gave them a haircut.
00:23:52.394 - 00:23:53.380, Speaker C: A fellow inmate.
00:23:53.452 - 00:23:54.428, Speaker B: Oh, I see.
00:23:54.556 - 00:24:09.940, Speaker C: And they also mentioned. So he's wearing a suit and a tie. People were concerned about that, given his typical wardrobe. But he is wearing a suit and tie. It looks a little oversized. I don't know if it's because he lost weight. I imagine it's strategic.
00:24:09.940 - 00:24:28.844, Speaker C: On the defensive side. I think everything at this point is strategic. They're trying to make him look, you know, frail or innocent or whatever it is. There's a lot that goes into that. But his defense team also mentioned that he bought the suit at Macy's and it was 40% off. So he is not the luxury. Yeah, no, this is not a man.
00:24:28.884 - 00:24:37.076, Speaker B: This is not a Brunello Cuchilli, Cuccinelli suit, folks. But who knows? Maybe it's, you know, 40% off, but it's still pretty expensive.
00:24:37.140 - 00:24:37.660, Speaker C: Who knows?
00:24:37.732 - 00:24:39.316, Speaker B: Nothing. You can't.
00:24:39.420 - 00:24:56.538, Speaker C: But he looks. He looks, you know, the same. Other than those physical changes, he is allowed to use a computer during the trial. So he has a privacy screen over it, obviously. So we can't see what he's typing. But he's typing a lot during the case. He will, like, look over at the jury.
00:24:56.538 - 00:25:11.282, Speaker C: He, for the most part, watches the witness on the stand. He'll kind of lean over and he's sitting with his whole counsel there at a big table. So he'll kind of lean over and speak with different attorneys at different times. But so far he has really not shown any emotion.
00:25:11.418 - 00:25:18.858, Speaker B: Got it. Okay. He at one point will be on the stand, but that will happen much we don't know. Oh, we don't know.
00:25:18.906 - 00:25:22.754, Speaker C: Probably if I had to put money on it. I think he will testify.
00:25:23.854 - 00:25:32.062, Speaker B: That's up to his team to assess. Right. As you said earlier he, you know, they don't have to do anything here.
00:25:32.158 - 00:25:32.566, Speaker C: You're right.
00:25:32.590 - 00:25:35.446, Speaker B: Yeah. The government can list him as a witness, and so he has to.
00:25:35.510 - 00:25:57.744, Speaker C: No. So he. The decision actually is solely up to Sam. His attorneys probably do not want him to take the stand, and they're probably advising him against it. But at the end of the day, Sam makes the choice, and he can tell the judge, I want to be put on the stand. The government cannot call him as a witness. It's part of the fifth amendment.
00:25:57.744 - 00:26:16.418, Speaker C: You can't testify against yourself. That kind of thing. He can't be forced. Exactly. So he can't be forced to, but he can choose to. And given what we know about him, I really think that he's going to choose to, but we'll have to see. So that won't happen until the prosecution's case rests.
00:26:16.418 - 00:26:27.570, Speaker C: So they'll go through all of their witnesses. I think it's expected to take at least a couple more weeks. And then at the end of that, Sam might have the opportunity. Or he will have the opportunity.
00:26:27.602 - 00:26:30.090, Speaker B: He will have the opportunity. Take this down. Yeah. Okay. Yes.
00:26:30.242 - 00:26:31.082, Speaker C: We don't know.
00:26:31.218 - 00:26:31.730, Speaker B: Okay.
00:26:31.802 - 00:26:34.258, Speaker C: But, I mean, you. You know him. I feel like he's.
00:26:34.386 - 00:26:35.546, Speaker B: Well, I don't know him that well.
00:26:35.570 - 00:26:38.174, Speaker C: I just have, you know, I mean.
00:26:38.674 - 00:26:59.534, Speaker B: I was on several podcasts with him. My first interaction with him was at his offices in Hong Kong when it was just Alameda, and Alameda was just like this. No name, but, like, he claimed to be one of the largest, like, trading shops. This was, like, in 2019. And I was on my way to the binance conference, and then he said, yeah, I want to build an exchange. And I said, well, you have a fund. You're building an exchange.
00:26:59.534 - 00:27:20.090, Speaker B: It needs to be a clear division there. And he was claiming to make these wild, like, hugely profitable. And if people remember, the Alameda deck raised a whole set of red flags, like, guaranteed. Like, whenever you're in finance or investing and you hear there's, like, guaranteed returns, just run away. Like, run as far as you physically can. Don't ever look back. It's just.
00:27:20.090 - 00:27:22.174, Speaker B: It's just not. It's a scam.
00:27:22.554 - 00:27:23.154, Speaker C: Right?
00:27:23.274 - 00:27:39.428, Speaker B: And I saw that, and it was like, in. The terms were egregious. It was, like, worse than rentech. It would. It was like, we can make all this money, and we'll just, like, give you guaranteed eleven or 12% on your capital. I was like, well, if you're. No, I want it like, a traditional hedge fund model is, like, 220.
00:27:39.428 - 00:27:57.740, Speaker B: Like, charge me 2% management fee and 20%, you know, take 20% of the profits, and I want to participate in the upside. Why are you capping at 11%? But it's guaranteed, so it's like. And I was like, okay, all this seems, like, really strange. And then he built FTX. Like, he said, yeah, I want to build an exchange. And he built it. And then it's like, I didn't hear from effortless because I didn't end up investing in Alameda.
00:27:57.892 - 00:28:00.664, Speaker C: The funding you were on to him, you could have been a witness.
00:28:02.224 - 00:28:15.096, Speaker B: I mean, sure, but I had. It was his usual demeanor. Like, it was like, the bean. The beanbags, they're right. Like, the office was good. It was. There was, like, maybe, like, less than ten people in this office, and this.
00:28:15.120 - 00:28:15.704, Speaker C: Was in Hong Kong.
00:28:15.744 - 00:28:30.954, Speaker B: Hong Kong, yeah. Okay. Like, financial district, some swanky office, but it was, like, all empty. And he had the gaming chair, like, everything. Everything you've seen in it. Like, it was. It was like that he portrayed himself as, you know, hugely, like, profitable.
00:28:30.954 - 00:28:36.694, Speaker B: Like, he had done very well at Jane street and then saw this huge inefficiency crypto, and then moved over and, like.
00:28:37.074 - 00:28:41.450, Speaker C: But he was pretty young at this point. He was, like, 26, 27.
00:28:41.642 - 00:28:57.298, Speaker B: Probably younger than that. You know, he looks. He looked young. Yeah, yeah. But, yeah, the red flag was a deck. The guaranteed returns. And then the idea that he didn't really seem to understand that when you have a fund and you have an exchange, that you have clients, money, like, you can't front.
00:28:57.298 - 00:29:09.640, Speaker B: Like, there needs to be a clear division. Right? Like, and he had. When I asked him that, he was just like, he didn't. He seemed like. Like he didn't know about that. And he looks over to this. What is this comply.
00:29:09.640 - 00:29:23.352, Speaker B: The compliance guy or whoever, like, is in charge of man? And I was like, yeah, guy. He hired a tattooed guy from Australia. I'm like, sure, yeah, no, probably not. You're. I come from JP Morgan. Like, you know how compliance people. Like, no disrespect, but, yeah, not like that.
00:29:23.448 - 00:29:24.208, Speaker C: So funny.
00:29:24.296 - 00:29:43.492, Speaker B: Anyways, and then I was with a few pot. Like, I was in a few podcasts with him, like, on. I think it was, like, Kobe's podcast, was it openly. And he was hugely critical of Defi. And so we always kind of, you know, I never. There was, like, very heated discussions because he was not a very big proponent of Defi, and, you know, admittedly. So.
00:29:43.492 - 00:29:49.704, Speaker B: Anyway, that's an aside. So what has happened after? So, like, yeah, that was my only interaction with him?
00:29:51.004 - 00:30:14.322, Speaker C: Yeah, he just, I've only interviewed him a couple times and obviously it was before a lot of, I haven't talked to him in over a year, so my perspective might be a little bit skewed, but given what I know about him and given his demeanor and his energy, I just, I feel like he is going to want to take the stand. I really think he just genuinely thinks that he can schmooze his way out of this, you know?
00:30:14.418 - 00:30:26.320, Speaker B: Yeah. Wear a t shirt and like, like a turtleneck on Elizabeth Holmes. I'm curious, so what has happened after? So that was Tuesday, there were Thursdays. So, um, what is that?
00:30:26.352 - 00:30:34.004, Speaker C: So, yes, jury selection and opening statements wrapped Wednesday. Um, and then we had our first witness.

00:33:03.754 - 00:33:19.164, Speaker C: The government called a french man who lives in London. He's called commodities trader who says that he lost like between 141 hundred, 50,000 USD on FTX. He was unable to withdraw it.
00:33:20.664 - 00:33:23.844, Speaker B: That was like a lot of people. I'm curious why this guy's special.
00:33:24.264 - 00:33:40.698, Speaker C: Yeah. So I thought it was an interesting choice. I did not think that they would start with a victim. Some people did. I've heard a lot of mixed. Hindsight's 2020. Also, I've heard a lot of mixed theories about who they would start with.
00:33:40.698 - 00:33:47.642, Speaker C: I really did not expect it to be a victim. I also, I just don't.
00:33:47.738 - 00:33:49.414, Speaker B: Why not, though? I'm curious.
00:33:49.754 - 00:34:00.938, Speaker C: I kind of thought that they would start maybe with a fellow employee. I thought they would start broader. Like, here is how it all went down. You know, a big picture of this.
00:34:00.986 - 00:34:02.954, Speaker B: Why not go straight for the jugular? Like, hey, this guy lost.
00:34:02.994 - 00:34:09.172, Speaker C: You're right. No, again, hindsight is 2020. I think a victim made sense, but I don't think they picked the best victim.
00:34:09.268 - 00:34:09.700, Speaker B: Why is that?
00:34:09.732 - 00:34:16.264, Speaker C: And I don't. He's this french guy. He trades cocoa bean commodities.
00:34:17.004 - 00:34:28.884, Speaker B: Coco's been on a tier. So, so he has like a thick, like, french accent, you know, I don't know, like, you know, I've TX. And you're almost 150,000 and no idea.
00:34:28.964 - 00:35:01.708, Speaker C: Like, you know, I trusted Sam. I won't imitate the accent, but yeah, so he's this french guy. He lives in London, he trades commodities. He's talking about trading commodities. I don't really think the jury understands what he's talking about. And then he says that he put 100,000 great british pounds into crypto and he had that money available immediately for him to invest. And again, I don't want to be judgmental of anyone in the jury.
00:35:01.708 - 00:35:06.890, Speaker C: I just, I don't think that that is really connecting with them. I don't think that's a lot of money.
00:35:06.922 - 00:35:15.274, Speaker B: I mean, for, you know, like the average salaries. And I think, I'm sure he's using a lot of financial jargon that they're like, I don't even know what Alameda and FTA.
00:35:15.354 - 00:35:34.094, Speaker C: Exactly, exactly. And, you know, he's talking about being a commodities trader. He was allowed to invest in crypto because of the disclosure requirements with his company. If you don't work in finance and you're just, you know, there's a woman on the jury. She's 22 years old. She works at a grocery store and lives with her parents. Like, she doesn't know what you're talking about.
00:35:34.094 - 00:35:37.330, Speaker C: And at the end of the day, it's. It's the jury that has to.
00:35:37.402 - 00:35:41.810, Speaker B: I mean, as far as victims go, like, like, yeah, I.
00:35:41.842 - 00:35:42.834, Speaker C: It was an interesting choice.
00:35:42.874 - 00:35:43.730, Speaker B: It was an interesting.
00:35:43.882 - 00:36:13.504, Speaker C: I'm sure there's some pass, too much judgment on it, but. So, yeah, that was witness number one. Okay. And they really, the government really tried to focus on. They actually showed the Larry David Super bowl commercial. They showed a Tom Brady commercial, and they showed all these things to kind of say that, you know, here's this man, this french man with all this money that trusted Sam because of his marketing strategy and because of his presence on social media and because he was taking photos of Bill Clinton. So that was the gist of that.
00:36:13.504 - 00:36:30.274, Speaker C: The next witness was a little bit more exciting. Former employee, former bestie with Sam Bankman Free. They met at MIT. They lived together. Yadidia, Adam Yadidia.
00:36:30.354 - 00:36:31.774, Speaker B: And then he was hired. Right.
00:36:32.114 - 00:36:32.914, Speaker C: What's that?
00:36:33.034 - 00:36:36.274, Speaker B: They went to MIT, and then I think they knew each other. And then he was hired.
00:36:36.434 - 00:36:53.958, Speaker C: Yeah. So he. They met at MIT, they lived together, and then he actually was an intern at Alameda for only about two months. And then Adam, the witness, went and got his PhD and then came to work at FTX as a developer.
00:36:54.086 - 00:36:54.630, Speaker B: Got it.
00:36:54.702 - 00:37:23.584, Speaker C: So he was with FTX, I think, from, like, mid 20 October 2021 until November 2022. Obviously, he did not work past that. And he, the big bombshell from him was he was granted immunity. So he was actually subpoenaed by the prosecution immediately in November December. Right. When this is all going down, they're investigating Sam. They think crimes have been committed.
00:37:23.584 - 00:37:58.372, Speaker C: Adam gets subpoenaed and he agrees to cooperate. I'll say, in exchange for immunity. The government is very, very clear that it's not a deal. He's not just saying what the prosecution needs in exchange for no jail time. The prosecution is very clear that he's not lying under oath. He's saying the truth. And in exchange for cooperation, he is not going to face any jail time, which is different than Ellison and Gary.
00:37:58.508 - 00:38:03.804, Speaker B: And some of the others who different from this case. They potentially do.
00:38:03.844 - 00:38:10.460, Speaker C: They pled guilty. Yeah. So Caroline and Gary have pled guilty. They have not been sentenced yet, but.
00:38:10.492 - 00:38:15.704, Speaker B: They will face something reduced. But the gist there is some reduced.
00:38:16.034 - 00:38:19.914, Speaker C: Yes. You take a plea deal, you agree.
00:38:19.954 - 00:38:24.962, Speaker B: To cooperate, and instead of being 117 years, it's exactly 20 or something.
00:38:25.058 - 00:38:27.682, Speaker C: Exactly. And this includes who knows what they'll get?
00:38:27.738 - 00:38:36.814, Speaker B: Who knows what they'll get. Yeah. But this includes Caroline Ellison, right. Includes Ryan Salami.
00:38:37.114 - 00:38:40.602, Speaker C: Yes, Ryan. Gary Wong.
00:38:40.698 - 00:38:42.968, Speaker B: And Gary's the co founder.
00:38:43.146 - 00:38:43.904, Speaker C: Yes.
00:38:45.884 - 00:38:49.484, Speaker B: Ryan, I think, was the CEO of FTX International or.
00:38:49.604 - 00:38:51.476, Speaker C: Right, I believe.
00:38:51.620 - 00:39:02.460, Speaker B: Or something. Yeah. And then Caroline, where is the co founder? Where is Sam Trabuco in all of this?
00:39:02.652 - 00:39:04.172, Speaker C: It's a good question because, you know.
00:39:04.188 - 00:39:23.718, Speaker B: This is like, people like us. People remember Sam was this, like, traitor at FTM, and he, he was to put these, like, epic, like, tweet threads where he was like, we made all this money. Like, when they're, whenever there was like some week with, like, crazy volatility, he would like, do a post mortem of the hugely profitable trade that.
00:39:23.806 - 00:39:24.390, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:39:24.542 - 00:39:38.322, Speaker B: And then he quietly, like, abruptly quit. Yeah, I think it was co CEO with Caroline abruptly quit before. And then, like, he was like, I'm gonna buy a boat and sail into the sunset. And that's all we did.
00:39:38.338 - 00:39:40.234, Speaker C: He quit pre bankruptcy.
00:39:40.314 - 00:39:54.082, Speaker B: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. This was, this was probably a yellow flag that people like, obviously, in hindsight, it was like, okay, why is he quitting? But yeah, this was a few months. I don't recall exactly when he quit, but this was before everything.
00:39:54.178 - 00:39:58.666, Speaker C: Like, Brett Harrison quit FTX us. I think.
00:39:58.730 - 00:40:00.712, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it was around that time.
00:40:00.898 - 00:40:01.276, Speaker C: Okay.
00:40:01.300 - 00:40:13.196, Speaker B: Yeah, around that time. It was in the summer. Yeah. Has he is being like, what's his role? Is he, do you know where, what's he, what? He's gonna trabuco?
00:40:13.220 - 00:40:19.828, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. I don't witness. He might be. We don't know. We don't know.
00:40:19.876 - 00:40:24.028, Speaker B: I gotta, I gotta believe that he's going to be like, he was just a super important role.
00:40:24.116 - 00:40:31.128, Speaker C: I do too. I'm sure he's on the list, but I cannot confirm. He hasn't been in court, so.
00:40:31.216 - 00:40:32.096, Speaker B: Right. Yeah.
00:40:32.240 - 00:41:12.000, Speaker C: Could mean something, but yeah, we, so just to kind of give everyone, like, a general idea, there's no, like, schedule for the trial. It's just trial. So right now, the prosecution is in the process of presenting their case. They have been cooperating with the defense and that they're giving them a little bit of heads up on who they're calling to the standard. So on Wednesday, I believe they told us that the next witnesses would be Matt and Gary, who we'll hear from today, tomorrow, potentially also next week, just depending on how long it takes. We don't know who's after that yet. They'll probably tell us tomorrow.
00:41:12.000 - 00:41:23.280, Speaker C: Or maybe there's no court on Monday. Maybe on Tuesday, they'll tell us who we can expect after that. But it's not like, oh, today Caroline Ellison's next Thursday. We just don't know.
00:41:23.312 - 00:41:25.680, Speaker B: Yeah, but you have a day's notice, if you will.
00:41:25.832 - 00:41:36.360, Speaker C: Yes, we generally have a day or two's notice. Also, the prosecution confirmed that Caroline will be testifying, which should be a shock to no one, but she will be. So we'll be waiting for her.
00:41:36.472 - 00:41:41.576, Speaker B: So from now, for the couple of weeks, it's just going to be witnesses?
00:41:41.760 - 00:42:11.784, Speaker C: Yes, yes. And I want to go back to Adam. So he's the former friend. He was a developer at FTX. He said that he was aware that the bank account that FTX customers used to wire money into their own trading accounts if they opted to fund their account via wire transfer, that account was owned by Alameda.
00:42:11.824 - 00:42:16.160, Speaker B: That was under Alameda's name. Like, if you wired money to FTX, it was going through Silvergate.
00:42:16.192 - 00:42:16.664, Speaker C: Alameda.
00:42:16.704 - 00:42:17.256, Speaker B: Alameda's guide.
00:42:17.280 - 00:42:51.040, Speaker C: Yes, yes. And he said that he knew that for a long time, many months, and that was kind of where the prosecution started. I think they lost the jury a little bit on this next part. So Adam became aware. So basically, okay, the money goes to Alameda. Alameda controls the money of FTX customers. Internally at FTX, they had a system to track how much that liability was.
00:42:51.040 - 00:43:30.526, Speaker C: So in theory, it was the amount of deposits minus the amount of fulfilled withdrawals. How much money does FTX, you know, collectively owe FTX customers? There was a bug, apparently, that Adam discovered. It said that the liability was 16 billion, and in reality, it was really 8 billion. So Adam was tasked with fixing this bug in the code of this system that tracked the deposits, tracked the liability, the debt of Alameda to FTX customers.
00:43:30.670 - 00:43:33.022, Speaker B: It was being overstated by two x.
00:43:33.158 - 00:44:00.274, Speaker C: It was being overstated by two x. Yeah, it was double what it should have been. Unsure why, but basically the reason why prosecution brings all of this in, and like I said, it was confusing. I think that they really lost the jury. You know, they're talking about code and bugs and accounts, and the jury was completely lost. One woman actually fell asleep. So we'll see what happens.
00:44:00.274 - 00:44:37.686, Speaker C: Anyway, so prosecution said all of this to establish the fact that. That Adam, as a developer, probably would not have had a lot of access to the financial statements. It just wasn't his part of the business. But because he fixed this bug. He knew 100% that Alameda owed $8 billion to FTX customers. That was something that he knew for certain and that he had first hand knowledge of. So he said that after he discovered that, that the liability was post bug fix, in reality, $8 billion, he went to Sam.
00:44:37.686 - 00:45:04.990, Speaker C: He said, I'm concerned about this. It seems too high. Can Alameda pay it? And Sam, I want to look at my notes so I make sure I get the quote right. Sam said that last year we were bulletproof, but not this year. And he did not explain what bulletproof meant. Adam did not ask. Adam said, how long until we are bulletproof again? And Sam said, six months to three years.
00:45:04.990 - 00:45:52.054, Speaker C: And to put this in a timeframe for everyone, Sam said this in July 2022. So roughly like, four months before the November 2022 collapse. Adam then said that he received a phone call in November from a fellow FTX employee, someone named Layla Lila, and she told him that someone had told her that Alameda used FTX customer funds to repay their creditors, and that is why he quit. So that was the long winded story of his testimony. The government, they have screenshots from some signal messages. They use those. They put those into evidence, which was pretty funny.
00:45:52.054 - 00:46:09.334, Speaker C: Sam obviously had instructed all of his employees to only use signal they had auto delete installed. Allegedly, he said that he wanted to keep these messages away from regulators. All in all, this witness, it's looking bad for Sam.
00:46:09.794 - 00:46:13.834, Speaker B: How did they get the signal? Like, if it was auto delete, someone's taking screenshots.
00:46:13.994 - 00:46:17.218, Speaker C: Someone must have taken screenshots. Yeah, presumably Adam, but they didn't actually.
00:46:17.266 - 00:46:20.694, Speaker B: Confirm that because a lot of people, like, wait, wait. Does signal have a back door?
00:46:21.674 - 00:46:22.414, Speaker C: Everyone.
00:46:23.074 - 00:46:28.778, Speaker B: This also came, uh, in the b. Is also relevant for binance case because they also have, like, uh.
00:46:28.946 - 00:46:29.514, Speaker C: It is.
00:46:29.594 - 00:46:32.818, Speaker B: So anyways, puts in a question signal.
00:46:32.986 - 00:46:40.274, Speaker C: Yeah. And the government mentioned several times that the only reason that they have evidence of these messages is because someone did take.
00:46:40.354 - 00:46:41.618, Speaker B: Somebody take screenshots.
00:46:41.706 - 00:46:42.922, Speaker C: Yes. They confirm that.
00:46:42.978 - 00:46:52.850, Speaker B: Um, which, you know, someone in there was saying, I want to keep these for leverage, or something's going wrong. I need to document this. And, like, would be a whistleblower.
00:46:53.002 - 00:46:53.626, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:46:53.690 - 00:46:54.962, Speaker B: And. Yeah. Okay.
00:46:55.018 - 00:46:58.574, Speaker C: Yeah. So part of. It's now part of.
00:46:58.874 - 00:47:00.146, Speaker B: Yeah. Public record.
00:47:00.210 - 00:47:01.874, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, public record. It's all there.
00:47:01.954 - 00:47:05.254, Speaker B: Anything interesting or juicy in those signal screenshots?
00:47:06.794 - 00:47:34.360, Speaker C: It was funny. There was one, a signal group chat with everyone that lived in the penthouse in the compound. Yeah, yeah. So Adam lived there with Sam and Caroline and Gary and I think there were, like, ten of them total. There were a lot of stories that came out later, things that happened in that penthouse. So, yeah, there was a group chat of them, and they were talking about paying rent, which I thought was funny. I didn't realize that they actually did pay rent.
00:47:34.360 - 00:47:37.524, Speaker C: I thought that Alameda had purchased it on behalf of.
00:47:37.904 - 00:47:39.244, Speaker B: Wasn't that the case?
00:47:40.874 - 00:47:57.026, Speaker C: Sam basically gave people an opportunity to get some financial exposure. He called it, and pay rent. Or maybe he was asking them if, you know, it could eventually lead to, like, equity in the condo or something. But, no, people did not have to pay rent to live there.
00:47:57.170 - 00:47:59.778, Speaker B: Sounds like a frat house, but, yeah, it does.
00:47:59.826 - 00:48:13.742, Speaker C: Well, it's funny that the defense, it's their opportunity to cross examine. And Sam's lawyer looks at Adam and says, well, that apartment was just like living in a dorm. Right? And Adam's like, well, you know, not really. It was communal living, whatever.
00:48:13.878 - 00:48:16.198, Speaker B: Not exactly your mit dorm room, folks.
00:48:16.246 - 00:48:29.006, Speaker C: But not exactly your mit dorm room. Yeah. I mean, they showed photos. So many photos of the penthouse have been entered into evidence. I mean, it is. It's beautiful. So nothing like a dorm.
00:48:29.110 - 00:48:32.446, Speaker B: Definitely not. Not my taste in terms of. There are some things there, but. Yeah, sure.
00:48:32.510 - 00:48:43.464, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. I. There's several things about the situation that would not appeal to me in a living situation, but, yeah, not comparable to a college dorm, definitely.
00:48:45.004 - 00:48:48.384, Speaker B: Okay. Anything else noteworthy from this particular witness?
00:48:49.564 - 00:48:59.412, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that the big thing is he's confirming that Sam knew. Sam knew.
00:48:59.468 - 00:49:18.640, Speaker B: Sam knew. Had exact knowledge that there was a hole, because he also said that there would take up to six to three years that there was a hole. And then if you actually go back and I'm thinking of those threads that Sam, you know, was posting while all this was going down, when CZ exposed them, and like, he was, he said.
00:49:18.672 - 00:49:21.464, Speaker C: Hey, look, we're whole entered into evidence, right?
00:49:21.504 - 00:49:31.724, Speaker B: Yeah. And so there's a. There's a lot of those tweets that I remember reading said, like, we're whole. Like, we're, you know, we'll be like. We have. I think he claimed at one point that they. They were.
00:49:31.724 - 00:49:35.064, Speaker B: There was no, like, asset liability mismatch they had.
00:49:35.404 - 00:49:35.884, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:49:35.964 - 00:49:56.124, Speaker B: And so. And I think there was. There's something particularly said had. I think he said that the lawyers. He claimed at one point that the lawyers had advised him to, like, go into, like, claim, like, chap file for chapter eleven, but had they not done that and in 72 hours, like, the situation would have been remedied. And I was like, really? Not the case. If there's $8 billion hold, it's gonna.
00:49:56.124 - 00:50:04.452, Speaker B: Cause now he's saying it's gonna take three to six months. Three. Was it six months to three years? That doesn't exactly sound like a separate range.
00:50:04.588 - 00:50:05.556, Speaker C: That's a massive range.
00:50:05.580 - 00:50:14.304, Speaker B: Well, it probably depends on, like, you know, like, crypto markets at the time. You know, crypto markets were post terra like this. You know, it's pretty gnarly, you know? So.
00:50:14.764 - 00:50:39.852, Speaker C: Yeah. The other thing, I'll add, that he. That witness mentioned around the time where they're talking about not being bulletproof and needing six months to three years to kind of recover. Sam allegedly told Adam that he was in talks with raising money from Saudi Arabia and slash or the UAE. So there was apparently a frantic attempt to.
00:50:40.028 - 00:50:42.156, Speaker B: Yeah, I think there were some rumors around that.
00:50:42.300 - 00:50:44.340, Speaker C: Yeah, I think, I feel like we had heard it was, like, a sovereign.
00:50:44.372 - 00:50:48.292, Speaker B: Wealth fund maybe in the Middle east that would maybe bail them out.
00:50:48.428 - 00:50:57.554, Speaker C: Right. So, yeah, that's. That's now been confirmed that that was a. A last resort plan that he was working on. Yeah.
00:50:58.294 - 00:51:02.446, Speaker B: Interesting. So that was it. Any other way after that? No other witnesses?
00:51:02.550 - 00:51:30.938, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, then it's just a little bit of legal fun. It goes into cross examination. I think I said this at the beginning, and we all know Sam's attorneys are. They have a very hard job. I'd imagine that they're probably spending a lot of time already working on an appeal just because it's. It seems so unlikely that he's not found guilty, at least on some counts. So their cross examination was, to be honest, was pretty hard to watch, really.
00:51:30.938 - 00:51:43.530, Speaker C: There just wasn't. The attorney just could not. He couldn't do it. He kept asking questions that were perceived as leading. So then you've probably seen this on tv. There's.
00:51:43.602 - 00:51:43.930, Speaker B: Objection.
00:51:43.962 - 00:52:03.936, Speaker C: Objection. Yeah. And the judge sustains it, and the lawyer has to kind of regroup and reframe. I think there were, like, three times where he paused the questioning to go over and, like, whisper with Sam and the other attorneys and then kind of regroup and come back. It's just. It's not a great look. He had this massive binder up on the podium with him.
00:52:03.936 - 00:52:14.520, Speaker C: He's, like, flipping through all these pages just frantically, whereas the prosecutor comes up with no notes. Her hands are, like, behind her back. Yeah. She's perfectly composed and relaxed.
00:52:14.592 - 00:52:19.442, Speaker B: I want to double click on who is. Do we have any knowledge on who these people are? Like, who's on both sides?
00:52:19.608 - 00:52:28.034, Speaker C: Yeah. So the. The prosecution is. They're representing Damien Williams office. He's the attorney general. Damien was actually there on.
00:52:28.334 - 00:52:34.662, Speaker B: He's been. Damon Williams has been the high profile selling district of New York, like, behind pretty much all the major clampdowns in crypto that you've seen.
00:52:34.758 - 00:52:48.628, Speaker C: Yes. Yes. And he's done. You know, it's not often that he's in the courtroom, although he was in the courtroom on Wednesday. He's doing all the press conferences. Anytime you see a statement from that office, it's from him.
00:52:48.676 - 00:52:49.100, Speaker B: It's from him.
00:52:49.132 - 00:53:06.636, Speaker C: Yeah. So he's the top guy. So the main prosecutor on that case representing Damian Williams is Susum. That's her last name. Her first name's escaping me. And like I said, she's good. She's composed, obviously.
00:53:06.636 - 00:53:27.202, Speaker C: These are all of her witnesses. So they've been prepped with her for weeks. I think Adam, the second witness, Sam's former friend, he met with the prosecution like eight times, just really nailing everything down. So, yeah, I mean, it's their show. They have the burden of proof. It's their chance to prove it to.
00:53:27.218 - 00:53:40.726, Speaker B: The jury because they have the burden of proof. They have access to the witnesses ahead of time. They can prep them, but the defense does not. Or they. They don't have as much time or access to the witnesses.
00:53:40.870 - 00:53:47.302, Speaker C: Yeah. So the defense, like the defense, did not have an opportunity to pre cross examine Adam.
00:53:47.358 - 00:53:48.078, Speaker B: Yeah. Right, right.
00:53:48.126 - 00:53:48.862, Speaker C: That's what you're asking.
00:53:48.918 - 00:53:49.590, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
00:53:49.662 - 00:53:54.078, Speaker C: They, like Sam's attorney, has what Sam has shared with him.
00:53:54.166 - 00:53:54.678, Speaker B: Right.
00:53:54.806 - 00:54:00.270, Speaker C: He has anything that's been entered into evidence. So, like, all the screenshots from signal, for example, he was given those ahead of time.
00:54:00.342 - 00:54:03.568, Speaker B: Right. That's presumably that huge binder that he's referencing.
00:54:03.726 - 00:54:06.716, Speaker C: Exactly, yeah. And, I mean, there's like, there's thousands of documents.
00:54:06.740 - 00:54:16.004, Speaker B: Yeah. No, I mean, yeah, yeah. It's crazy. Yeah. So they really have to scramble each and every time. They have. They have the massive list of witnesses.
00:54:16.004 - 00:54:37.374, Speaker B: So they're. They're frantically kind of, like, preparing a strategy for each and every one of them consulting with Sam, obviously, what is being put in evidence by the prosecutor. They have access to that. So they can see what they're seeing to then develop a strategy for each witness. But it's also. But, but it's a harder. They don't have the benefit of having talked to them.
00:54:37.374 - 00:54:48.614, Speaker B: And so that, because they have, you know, the pressure or I guess, the, you know, the government needs to prove that he's guilty. So it makes sense that it's a bit lopsided like that?
00:54:48.774 - 00:55:07.410, Speaker C: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, the defense, like you said, they have an idea of what the prosecution's angling for with each witness. Like, every witness is serving a purpose for the government. So, yeah, it's. The defense has to be flexible in terms of, like, being prepared for everyone. It's also.
00:55:07.410 - 00:55:16.594, Speaker C: I mean, it's been more difficult with Sam being incarcerated for the last few months. He had his bail revoked, and he now has limited access to his attorneys.
00:55:16.754 - 00:55:20.210, Speaker B: You know, they can also. Visitation rights are limited, I guess, per day.
00:55:20.242 - 00:55:35.244, Speaker C: Yeah, it's limited. He's allowed to come to the courthouse for this trial. He comes early, and he has an opportunity to meet with his counsel, but it's not the 24/7 access he was getting when he was on house arrest. His parents place in California.
00:55:35.864 - 00:55:49.808, Speaker B: Interesting. Yeah, I mean, that. That really is, like, if you're the lawyer, that, as you said, it really puts a greater amount of difficulty to develop a strategy if you don't have, like. It would have been way easier for them if Sam was in his parents house.
00:55:49.976 - 00:55:50.488, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:55:50.536 - 00:55:56.464, Speaker B: Or, like, a hotel room. You have access to him all the time. Huh. Interesting.
00:55:58.244 - 00:56:06.464, Speaker C: They mentioned his Adderall, too. It was a funny little tidbit. Apparently, Sam is supposed to get four doses of Adderall.
00:56:07.084 - 00:56:10.184, Speaker B: Does he get access to stimulants?
00:56:10.804 - 00:56:20.514, Speaker C: Yes, he's court ordered, allowed four doses. They didn't say the milligram amount, but four seems, in my personal opinion, high.
00:56:21.094 - 00:56:22.758, Speaker B: No idea. I've never taken it.
00:56:22.886 - 00:56:29.526, Speaker C: It's. I haven't either, but it's just four just seems like a lot he's been given for listeners.
00:56:29.550 - 00:56:31.646, Speaker B: If you have any context or knowledge, maybe.
00:56:31.710 - 00:56:32.142, Speaker C: Yeah, let us know.
00:56:32.158 - 00:56:35.934, Speaker B: We'd love to know milligram dosage here, but, yeah, please let us know.
00:56:36.054 - 00:56:37.670, Speaker C: There's a shortage, too. So. Ford?
00:56:37.702 - 00:56:41.630, Speaker B: Well, I don't know. I mean, there's been a shortage for years, though, I believe, like, shortages.
00:56:41.702 - 00:56:43.262, Speaker C: Like, feels like this is now.
00:56:43.318 - 00:56:51.926, Speaker B: Like, forget about oil prices, folks. Like, there's George Vader. All right. The country is no longer productive. Okay. Joseph, our producer, says definitely a lot. Okay.
00:56:51.950 - 00:56:52.874, Speaker C: For is a lot.
00:56:53.334 - 00:56:57.638, Speaker B: Is. For, like, is there a standard, like, milligrams, like, each tablet?
00:56:57.686 - 00:56:58.634, Speaker C: That's a good question.
00:56:59.254 - 00:57:00.046, Speaker B: Or 40.
00:57:00.150 - 00:57:00.678, Speaker C: Not 40.
00:57:00.726 - 00:57:08.686, Speaker B: Okay, 40. 40 pills. No. Joseph is. Has no idea what's going on.
00:57:08.830 - 00:57:11.734, Speaker C: I can't imagine that it would be lower. Oh, he says, force, not much.
00:57:11.774 - 00:57:12.288, Speaker B: For is not much.
00:57:12.326 - 00:57:38.544, Speaker C: I can't imagine that the dosage would be lower than ten milligrams. I feel like that's okay. We're totally getting into speculation. The point is, the judge said that he could have four a day, but he's only been getting two because he's been in court, so he's not at prison for lunchtime, I guess, which is when they would give it to him or whatever it is. So they're trying to work on that because he has not been able to focus while in the courtroom. His attorney said. So.
00:57:38.544 - 00:57:40.484, Speaker C: Yeah, we'll see.
00:57:40.784 - 00:57:54.512, Speaker B: I mean, if you were taking all. He was using that patch and whatever and all that Adderall and you still had a bug in the contract, you still didn't catch $16 billion or wait. Or whatever it was. I'm sorry, guys. But, you know, the bug.
00:57:54.568 - 00:57:59.952, Speaker C: The bug, really, they, like, glossed over the bug. The fact there was an issue in the code.
00:58:00.048 - 00:58:07.014, Speaker B: You know, there's a lot of bugs in crypto, but not, like, money coming in is a. I'm not a developer.
00:58:07.054 - 00:58:09.046, Speaker C: And it seems like such a simple equation.
00:58:09.110 - 00:58:13.182, Speaker B: You know, you're taking whatever comes in that tells you. Exactly.
00:58:13.358 - 00:58:14.194, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:58:15.054 - 00:58:19.182, Speaker B: Like, the liability side of the house is very, very straightforward. I'm sorry.
00:58:19.278 - 00:58:20.278, Speaker C: Very straightforward.
00:58:20.406 - 00:58:35.374, Speaker B: The assets, however, you're valuing these things and the illiquidity of said things and how you give, like, a current, like, standing value to those assets. I understand. But the liabilities, it's like. No, it's, like, fairly straightforward. What comes in the house.
00:58:35.714 - 00:58:36.274, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:58:36.354 - 00:58:51.602, Speaker B: Because you're using that money. Yeah, do whatever. Champion coat what we're doing. Okay. Interesting. Any other, like, initial reactions from the people that were there from different media or different.
00:58:51.658 - 00:58:52.614, Speaker C: Yeah, it's.
00:58:53.434 - 00:58:54.602, Speaker B: What's the sentiment in the room?
00:58:54.658 - 00:59:27.244, Speaker C: I probably sound like a nerdy journalist, but it has actually been a lot of fun, you know, going to conferences and stuff. A lot of us know each other, so, you know, standing in line together and being in the courtroom, it is entertaining. The judge is pretty funny. He's had a few one liners that have made the entire courtroom laugh. One juror, during the selection process even said something that got Sam's mom to crack a smile. So the energy is high, I would say. One of the prosecutor today actually asked about the FTX arena.
00:59:27.244 - 00:59:29.366, Speaker C: That got a lot of giggles.
00:59:29.470 - 00:59:33.158, Speaker B: Miami Heat. Right? They got renamed FTX, and then.
00:59:33.246 - 01:00:14.154, Speaker C: Yes, the defense was trying to say that Sam didn't spend a lot of money on crazy things, and he didn't have fancy cars or whatever. And then the prosecution said, well, what about this arena in Miami? So that was pretty funny. But, yeah, the energy has been good. There have been a few, just regular people, just members of the public that want to come and watch. There's been a lot of attorneys in the audience. I actually, I sat next to a woman yesterday who is an attorney for one of the witnesses. She obviously wouldn't tell me who, but if her, if her client gets called, then I guess we'll know.
01:00:14.154 - 01:00:32.042, Speaker C: A lot of the clerks that work in the courthouse, in the building, for other judges, I mean, the line to get into the courtroom was just insane. All of the clerks wanted to watch it. They want to see the opening statements. It's drawing a lot of interest, not just from the blockworks reporter and other crypto media.
01:00:32.138 - 01:00:41.434, Speaker B: I would think, like, you think you're going to have to wake up, like at 420, like in the morning every for the next month, or do you think, like, the interest is going to, like, you do?
01:00:41.554 - 01:00:46.298, Speaker C: That's a good question. I think the interest probably has to die down a little bit.
01:00:46.346 - 01:00:53.644, Speaker B: Unless there's like a very special, like when Caroline or Matt, like high profile people get called, like, sure, you know, get there early, but if it's just like random.
01:00:53.804 - 01:00:55.892, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, for my sake, I really hope it dies down.
01:00:55.948 - 01:01:01.704, Speaker B: But are they serving coffee inside? How do you like, how long they are serving coffee?
01:01:03.684 - 01:01:09.100, Speaker C: Honestly, food is a bigger issue. You're not allowed to eat in the courtroom and there's just, there's no time for eating.
01:01:09.212 - 01:01:14.740, Speaker B: So you're there for, you know, four in the morning. It's five in the morning until you leave at like noon or so.
01:01:14.852 - 01:01:22.694, Speaker C: It wraps around today. I left a little bit early, but it wraps around 430 every day, pm, pm, there's an hour lunch break.
01:01:22.814 - 01:01:27.678, Speaker B: Okay. So you're allowed to, if you go out, you still have your, you save your place.
01:01:27.806 - 01:01:53.500, Speaker C: So to get. Yes, your spot gets saved. So your seat in the courtroom gets saved, which is great. But so you leave the courtroom, you can run downstairs. You can't bring your phones in and your computer, you have to check that. So you retrieve your phone and computer, you have to leave the courthouse, you have to walk outside to turn on your phone. So then that's when all the journalists are out there, like sending their tweets and writing stories and everything.
01:01:53.500 - 01:01:54.876, Speaker C: And then you go back in.
01:01:54.940 - 01:01:56.708, Speaker B: So you're really not eating during that hour.
01:01:56.756 - 01:02:10.220, Speaker C: You're not eating during that hour. Reporting back to headquarters, reporting back, quite literally reporting back. Yeah, but no, it has been fun. And trial, it's only four days a week, every week. So it's either Monday or full time job.
01:02:10.292 - 01:02:13.700, Speaker B: I mean, most people now work from home. So, you know, that's full time for all.
01:02:13.732 - 01:02:28.484, Speaker C: That's a purpose, getting dressed every day. I'm like, I'm not used to this, but. No, it's been good. It's been good. We'll see. Like you said, I think when Caroline testifies and everything, it'll probably be another circus, but it's never a dull day. I'm sure there's.
01:02:28.484 - 01:02:29.824, Speaker C: There's a lot to come.
01:02:31.324 - 01:02:37.468, Speaker B: Can they. I mean, what happens if they call ZZ as a witness? Is he in the witness list?
01:02:37.636 - 01:02:38.260, Speaker C: Cz?
01:02:38.372 - 01:02:39.184, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
01:02:39.524 - 01:02:41.802, Speaker C: He was not named.
01:02:41.988 - 01:02:45.710, Speaker B: I mean, good luck trying to get him into the courtroom, but I don't think he's going to show up.
01:02:45.782 - 01:02:55.646, Speaker C: Yeah, we'd have to ask an attorney this. I don't know what the deal is about testifying, if you yourself are also.
01:02:55.830 - 01:03:10.784, Speaker B: I mean, for context, for. CZ was probably the guy that they were invested. So binance was an investor in FTX. They had a huge amount of FTT tokens, and then CZ was really the guy that tripped this up. And then Coindesk reported it, and then everything kind of unraveled after that. That. But Cz knew.
01:03:10.784 - 01:03:39.688, Speaker B: I've heard really crazy, like, I've heard some stories about how CZ got, like, actually ended up knowing. I mean, but he was as an investor, he had, like. And, you know, like, finance, intel, whatever, like on chain analytics or whatever. They knew, and he really tripped us up. So, I mean, he's like a good win, and then they try to acquire, there's like a whole back and forth between them getting involved, like, buying, you know, and FTX, and then they dropped out, and so it was. Yeah, I mean, he could be a.
01:03:39.696 - 01:03:42.352, Speaker C: Witness, but it sounds like he'd be a perfect witness.
01:03:42.488 - 01:03:44.736, Speaker B: Yeah, but I don't think he's gonna show up. And.
01:03:44.840 - 01:04:03.132, Speaker C: No, he was not. So they list a big to the jury. They give them, like, a massive laundry list of every name, company, entity, etcetera, that could even be mentioned during trial, and he was not on that list. I'll have to double check the transcript.
01:04:03.188 - 01:04:04.864, Speaker B: Was finance on that list?
01:04:05.484 - 01:04:22.944, Speaker C: I don't. Finance was. I do believe I'll have to double check the transcript. I'm pretty sure he was not on that list. But also we'd have. I'm curious what the legal opinion is on testifying if you're also going through.
01:04:23.564 - 01:04:25.372, Speaker B: Yeah, he's so.
01:04:25.388 - 01:04:30.542, Speaker C: I don't know. I don't know. It seems like it might be a issue with.
01:04:30.638 - 01:04:31.406, Speaker B: Difficult.
01:04:31.550 - 01:04:32.554, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah.
01:04:34.374 - 01:04:42.622, Speaker B: Anytime soon, given everything that's going on. Excellent. Okay. Well, is there anything else that we haven't covered that we should?
01:04:42.758 - 01:04:53.554, Speaker C: I don't think so. I'm sure everyone's been following this on Twitter, but, yeah, there'll be a lot more updates to come. Some early mornings for us. And.
01:04:54.004 - 01:04:58.132, Speaker B: Gosh, yeah, 420 in the morning. I mean.
01:04:58.188 - 01:05:00.044, Speaker C: Yeah, send snacks, too.
01:05:00.204 - 01:05:04.932, Speaker B: Yeah, please, folks. You know, southern district of New York, you know, going, yeah.
01:05:04.948 - 01:05:11.228, Speaker C: And if you're. If you want to try to make $500, then come early and try to get a photo of Mark Cohen, Sam's attorney.
01:05:11.316 - 01:05:22.992, Speaker B: There we go. That's a lot. Well, great. I mean, this has been illuminating. Just, I. You know, again, like this. This is like the real suits, but you know what happens in courtrooms.
01:05:23.048 - 01:05:27.176, Speaker C: Yeah, no, thank you so much for having me. I know a lot of it is definitely boring and.
01:05:27.240 - 01:05:43.584, Speaker B: No, I mean, it wasn't boring. This is really just the procedures and the witnesses and whatnot, and just kind of the sentiment of an interpretation of the different people in the room and how they're assessing kind of the strategy and whatnot. So Michael Lewis, presumably, he wasn't in the courtroom, and his.
01:05:43.624 - 01:05:51.864, Speaker C: He was not in the courtroom. This is actually pretty funny. He was not there. Okay. And he's not a witness.
01:05:52.164 - 01:05:54.028, Speaker B: He spent a lot of time with Sam.
01:05:54.156 - 01:05:56.052, Speaker C: He spent a lot of time, he.
01:05:56.068 - 01:05:58.700, Speaker B: Will tell you, could be a witness. I mean, he could be a witness, for instance.
01:05:58.732 - 01:06:16.334, Speaker C: No, he. I mean, reasonably speaking, I think he would make sense. But he's. As far as I know, he's not. I will say, though, so the journalists, all the, you know, the book came out on Tuesday, which is when the trial started. Everyone's talking about it. Everyone's reading reviews.
01:06:16.334 - 01:06:45.394, Speaker C: Zeke Falk, who is a Bloomberg journalist, he wrote a. I don't want to say competing story, but he also wrote a book about SBF that came out pretty recently. He was there. Everyone's talking about Michael Lewis. To be honest, everyone's kind of shitting on Michael Lewis. Little did we know that someone who works with a podcast he does or works on a podcast that he's involved with or something was there. So, yeah, watch what you say, even if you think you're among, like.
01:06:45.434 - 01:06:47.250, Speaker B: Or not to be ruthlessly transparent.
01:06:47.322 - 01:07:02.554, Speaker C: But, yeah, no, yeah, yeah, no, she was very understanding. I mean, I think the 60 minutes story was just so poorly done. I haven't read the book yet, so I won't pass judgment on that. But I have read some reviews, and it seems unfortunate.
01:07:02.594 - 01:07:16.114, Speaker B: What I heard was that it's sort of, like, him trying to save face, because how do you spend so much time with a guy and have the inside look and didn't pick up the fact that he was like, how do you justify, like, having spent all this time?
01:07:16.534 - 01:07:50.716, Speaker C: He didn't even ask. And, yeah, didn't say, like, let me. You know, it's one thing if you said, show me a financial document, and then later we found out that it was falsified or something, but he didn't even ask. He never even reached out to binance. So, like, you know, obviously, in the midst of him following Sam around and writing the story, everything blew up. You know, as a journalist, as part of your reporting, part of that should be reaching out to CZ and say, what happened? What's your side of the story? You know, I saw one side. He never did that ignorant at all.
01:07:50.716 - 01:07:55.588, Speaker C: He saw no need to. He said. So it just seems very short sighted.
01:07:55.676 - 01:08:04.588, Speaker B: And sounds like someone paid him a bunch of money and FTT tokens to write this book. And then, you know. Yeah, seriously. Journalism integrity.
01:08:04.756 - 01:08:06.700, Speaker C: Yeah. Awesome.
01:08:06.852 - 01:08:13.972, Speaker B: Casey. Well, you know, I don't want to keep you here longer because you probably need to catch up on sleep and a bunch of other things. Thank you for coming on.
01:08:14.028 - 01:08:14.892, Speaker C: Thank you.
01:08:15.068 - 01:08:19.964, Speaker B: I think our listeners would love it. We'll probably have to have you on down the road as these things progress.
01:08:20.044 - 01:08:23.064, Speaker C: Six weeks long. God, so much more.
01:08:23.364 - 01:08:26.904, Speaker B: I think I saw that you were running. Preparing for the New York marathon.
01:08:27.084 - 01:08:29.200, Speaker C: I am running the New York marathon. Yeah, that's.
01:08:29.272 - 01:08:33.104, Speaker B: I am running it, too, by the way. But I don't need to wake up at 420 in the morning each day.
01:08:33.144 - 01:08:46.480, Speaker C: Yeah. Having the trial, like, the four weeks before the marathon, it's a bummer, but are you ready? Okay. I think so. I did. I've done 20 miles.
01:08:46.632 - 01:08:47.112, Speaker B: Okay.
01:08:47.168 - 01:08:48.992, Speaker C: I was gonna do it again. Yeah.
01:08:49.048 - 01:08:50.044, Speaker B: Is this your first?
01:08:50.464 - 01:08:51.736, Speaker C: It is not. I've done.
01:08:51.800 - 01:08:52.032, Speaker B: Okay.
01:08:52.048 - 01:08:58.168, Speaker C: There you go. Third marathon. No, no. Fourth marathon. Third New York Marathon.
01:08:58.256 - 01:08:58.792, Speaker B: Nice.
01:08:58.928 - 01:08:59.924, Speaker C: What about you?
01:09:00.224 - 01:09:04.320, Speaker B: This is gonna be my fifth New York, and I've done eight now.
01:09:04.392 - 01:09:05.352, Speaker C: It's. Yeah, I.
01:09:05.368 - 01:09:08.904, Speaker B: New York is the best in my mind, my humble in New York.
01:09:08.944 - 01:09:13.112, Speaker C: Yeah. I don't think living here and not running it, like, when you cross the.
01:09:13.128 - 01:09:28.512, Speaker B: Bridge into Manhattan and get the first avenue, like, that, feeling alone, you're hearing people, like, halfway through, like, there are very few fire headphones. Yeah, yeah. There are very few moments where I felt that kind of electricity. And it's just. It's just amazing.
01:09:28.648 - 01:09:31.248, Speaker C: Yeah. I'm really excited. Hopefully we have good weather.
01:09:31.416 - 01:09:39.800, Speaker B: Hopefully. You know, we never know. You know, that's what makes New York, New York. Yeah. All right. Well, good luck with training, and thank you, too. Yeah.
01:09:39.800 - 01:09:42.824, Speaker B: And I guess we'll see, you know, running.
01:09:42.984 - 01:09:44.252, Speaker C: Yeah, for sure.
01:09:44.448 - 01:09:56.624, Speaker B: Great. Well, thanks, everyone, for listening. If you want to learn more about the trial and other details around that, please drop us a comment, Twitter or YouTube, and we'll try to have Casey back so you can report.
01:09:57.164 - 01:09:58.604, Speaker C: Definitely. Thank you, guys.
01:09:58.684 - 01:09:59.004, Speaker B: Thank you.
