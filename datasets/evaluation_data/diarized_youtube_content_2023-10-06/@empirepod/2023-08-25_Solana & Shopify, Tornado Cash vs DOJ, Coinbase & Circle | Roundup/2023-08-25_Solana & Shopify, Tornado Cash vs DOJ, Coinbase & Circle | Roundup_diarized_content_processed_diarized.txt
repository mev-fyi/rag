00:00:02.480 - 00:00:06.794, Speaker A: Dude, it's been a while. I feel like we're like we haven't done a roundup in a couple weeks.
00:00:07.174 - 00:00:31.320, Speaker B: Yeah, you know, it's been, obviously we covered some, did some specific episodes, not roundups around Friendech. That was last week. We had a regulatory pod and I mean, I think there's been some activity, but not a ton, I would say. But I think we have a good, good content and material to talk about during this roundup for permissions.
00:00:31.392 - 00:00:53.122, Speaker A: All right, man, here's what I want to talk about. I want to talk about friend Tech. We did that episode with Ansem that I thought was pretty interesting. It's been a couple of days since then, so I just want to do a quick update. There we have tornado cash. Then there's an interesting collaboration between Solana and Shopify that happened, and then Coinbase made an investment in circle and that has some implications for USCC. We can.
00:00:53.122 - 00:01:10.434, Speaker A: So we'll try to talk about all that. We'll see if we get to it. First thing is friend tech, I'd love to just get your. Not before we look at Dune, before we look at the transaction data and all that kind of stuff. Would love to just get your thoughts on that episode and the last two days and if you've thought more about that.
00:01:12.094 - 00:01:55.038, Speaker B: Yeah, I thought it was a good episode. It forced me to think about kind of whole two conflicting ideas at once in my head. One, and then I looked at the comments and the feedback from people and a lot of people reached out today. I would have expected you to go on there. And I saw a part of me like, first of all, I think it's very positive from an onboarding perspective, from a usability perspective, it's gotten a lot of traction over 100,000 users. I think you were the one that mentioned this. But the flow, of course, it's on base and I'm very bullish on base as being a very net positive for this space.
00:01:55.038 - 00:03:03.808, Speaker B: But the, it sounds to me like, and I haven't gone through it, but a lot of the episode I wanted to get your thoughts on how easy it was to get initiated, to bridge and to get started. And that's really important because I think that is in and of itself really positive that now we are getting closer and closer to, even before I can abstract in the state of the world where it's just really easy to use these apps. Putting aside my thoughts around is it good or bad around betting and having a, you know, speculating on influencers, like, like is it the right implementation of that. I'm not sure I actually lean negative on that. But the idea of, and I think you and I both agree on this, which is it feels like the relationship between the content creator and their fan base ought to be reinvented in a more direct, intimate way. I'm not sure this is the right implementation. And I referenced things like steemit and bitcloud and other prior iterations of that and compared it to stable coins.
00:03:03.808 - 00:03:09.632, Speaker B: Fascinating. But don't work. Really, or haven't?
00:03:09.768 - 00:03:11.496, Speaker A: Not stable coins. Algorithmic. Stablecoins.
00:03:11.560 - 00:03:35.582, Speaker B: Algorithmic, yes. But yeah, look, I'll pause in a minute, but I think net. Net, I still haven't signed up. I'm very curious in terms of the activity that's happening there. And you shared a tune dashboard right before this episode, and we'll cover that here. But, but, yeah, you know, that's so, so that's my thinking.
00:03:35.678 - 00:04:09.890, Speaker A: Yeah. The biggest breakthrough for me has been it feels like the future of connection with, like, fan connection with either artists or celebs or even just like, founders that you enjoy following and other people and things like that. Like, it's really fun to be in, like, I don't know, like, in Rob. Rob Leshner's chat, for example. Like, chilling in Leshner's chat, and people are just, like, talking about different things, and his chat is, like, very focused on just, like, kind of shooting the shit about news. Then you go into, like, disclosures chat, and there's only 50 people in disclosures chat. And he's, like, showing behind the scenes of, like, how he just made this song, and it's really cool.
00:04:09.890 - 00:04:21.746, Speaker A: And then you go into someone else's chat, and you're like, they're doing, like, trading strategies. And I'm like, nah, I don't really care about the trading strategies. Like, I'm gonna sell. I'm gonna, like, sell this. This. Now they don't call them shares, they call them keys. Keys, right, keys.
00:04:21.746 - 00:05:06.924, Speaker A: So I don't know, like, is a friend tech the future of, like, that connection? Is that the platform? I have no idea, but it does feel like we've. There's this unlock about connecting with fans, and it's made me think about, like, you know, there are some baseball players, there's some football players, some basketball players, some artists that I would love if they got on the platform, I'd buy their keys instantly. Not because I think their price is going to go up, which was my original thought of, like, allows you to go long on people that you enjoy. It's actually, this access point that things like Patreon and I always, I think, I still think of onlyfans as like just like this porn platform still. But, like, I'm sure it's, I'm sure it's evolved into more than that. But, like, I don't think either Patreon or Onlyfans have, have nailed that.
00:05:07.044 - 00:05:39.118, Speaker B: And usually successful businesses, by the way, hugely. Yeah, yeah, no, I agree with you. Like, the access thing is very interesting. And so one of the things that was brought up during the episode was, and I asked the question, like, what would be the things that you would change? And it sounds like video and general chat, because right now the chat is direct only, right? Like, you don't have access to, it's like, note, open chat between all the key holders and the, that's the biggest.
00:05:39.166 - 00:06:21.430, Speaker A: Problem of the whole platform right now is that you have to, and there's this like, workaround, which is people are basically saying, so you'll ask a question in my chat or you'll say, hey, like what? You know, you'll ask some question. And I have to say, like, hey, Santi just asked this question, quote, and then I respond to it. So, yeah, I actually saw, so I have the keys to some of our, to some blockworks people. And I saw one of our analysts, this guy Matt, he got this question. He did the retweet quote thing. He's like, hey, who's your favorite? Who, who do you like more, Mike or Jason? I was like, oh, he's not going to answer that, is he? And sure enough, he answered it. But it was a smart move, he said, but he said he likes both of us.
00:06:21.430 - 00:06:32.430, Speaker A: So that was, I was like, all right, you passed that test. But it did get me thinking. I was like, man, like, what else are people saying about blockworks on here? Or like, what's happening in these, like, private chats? You know?
00:06:32.462 - 00:07:20.594, Speaker B: So it got me thinking, yeah, absolutely. The thing that gives me pause is sort of the, unlike other platforms like Patreon, is this kind of price, constant price feed and the implications that it may have on just, you know, thinking of worth. I mean, certainly there's a lot of criticism on social media that's that social media has created more anxiety and for folks. And is this, is this net positive? In many ways it is. I could see in a world where some people become really obsessed with the price and demoralized, if you will, in a similar manner as NFT collections. Right. Have really gone down in value.
00:07:20.594 - 00:08:00.898, Speaker B: I think technology is neutral, but certainly you know, it doesn't feel good. It feels great if your price goes up. Let's just be honest, it feels, probably doesn't feel as good if your price crashes. And so, yeah, it's just going to be interesting to observe. I tweeted out and said, I would love to see a correlation between, like, the number of followers in other platforms, particularly Twitter, and how that is translated into the price of the key. On Friendq, as you pointed out in the episode, there are certain people that don't have many followers on Twitter, but on Friendk, they are actually wildly popular.
00:08:01.026 - 00:08:10.950, Speaker A: I think it's influence people. I think there's a strong correlation between what people perceive someone's influence and power and their space to be, and then.
00:08:11.142 - 00:09:03.752, Speaker B: Less of their followers, which it's interesting because as we've known on some of the traditional platforms, like, there's a lot of bots, historically, people have paid for followers. And so it is, this certainly is more a real, you know, it's a market. Right. And so there's money behind it. So you understand true influence, I guess, and interest in a particular person, and it allows for, I mean, I guess the upside case is that it would allow up and coming people that are putting out good content or just generally to be discovered because markets tend to be way more efficient in discovering value. Right. And that the gap between real value and discoverability, like, really compresses.
00:09:03.752 - 00:09:20.832, Speaker B: Right. And so whereas in social media platforms, traditionally, like, there's, there's a lot of accounts that you're like, well, probably, probably paid for those, or there are a bunch of bots. And so, yeah, the other, so you.
00:09:20.848 - 00:09:52.496, Speaker A: Said it gets you excited when your price goes up or maybe gets you demoralized when your price goes down. You know, the, actually, I had an interesting thing happen this morning, which is the, every Friday they give out the airdrop points. So the point, these points that are off chain but will eventually impact an airdrop, and I really haven't been playing with this app to get an airdrop. Like, that hasn't even crossed my mind, really. However, this morning, I didn't get any points, and I was kind of pissed off. Right? I was kind of pissed off because I was like, oh, I've been, you know, I've been using this app a lot. Why didn't I get any points? And it's interesting to see.
00:09:52.496 - 00:10:25.734, Speaker A: I've only thought of airdrop, like, airdrops and points and these kind of things is like, positive reinforcement mechanisms. I've never thought about them, actually, as negative reinforcement mechanisms. Where you might have some good users, but if they didn't get what they feel is they're worth, then it actually disincentivizes them to use it. So anyways, we can look at this dune chart. I mean, these transactions have completely fallen off the table. So if you look at before August 18, transactions were kind of sitting around 1500 a day. By August 21, they had peaked at 38,000 transactions in a day.
00:10:25.734 - 00:10:49.294, Speaker A: That chart is now down only since the 21st, and they are now down to 2000 transactions, almost back to the original levels. So these are some, I mean, just very bearish charts. I would say sellers is catching up to buyers. Money that went into the platform is now streaming out of the platform.
00:10:50.194 - 00:10:51.854, Speaker B: Is that okay?
00:10:52.854 - 00:10:53.934, Speaker A: This is actually in.
00:10:53.974 - 00:11:02.534, Speaker B: That's just inflows. Inflows continue to be positive. But what's the outflow like? The net. The net flow? Is that negative?
00:11:02.694 - 00:11:04.958, Speaker A: No, I think it's still. I think it's still positive.
00:11:05.126 - 00:11:17.684, Speaker B: Right? Yeah. So look, I mean, I think still money is coming in. And when I say money, it's more like users are coming in, although at a slower rate.
00:11:17.854 - 00:11:18.272, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:11:18.328 - 00:11:34.120, Speaker B: And what's interesting is total protocol fees is what you were just showing it. But it's north of 3 million or so, a portion of which it gets shared with the key owner, some people.
00:11:34.272 - 00:11:35.488, Speaker A: 3.5 million.
00:11:35.616 - 00:11:53.294, Speaker B: 3.5 million. And a port, that's aggregate, that gets split amongst the protocol developers, the team, and then the key holder. Right. So folks like Kobe have made 80 ETH or so I think you were saying the episode.
00:11:54.154 - 00:11:58.854, Speaker A: Exactly, exactly. So anyways, it'll be interesting to follow it.
00:11:59.434 - 00:12:25.600, Speaker B: Yeah. Overall, I mean, this is zooming out a little bit. Obviously, bass people should go listen to. There's two episodes that we recorded with Jesse was one of the kind of leaders within Coinbase to spearhead that effort. And we recorded the second one right before they were launching. And this kind of on chain summer. And Base is part of that where it's been getting a lot of traction.
00:12:25.600 - 00:13:02.712, Speaker B: And so that's good to see. You know, is this the. You know, just generally my thinking is that Base is going to be incredibly positive for the space. It will allow people to venture into this world in a. And I'm looking at over 100 million users of Coinbase that potentially are going to venture into web3 and have applications and access that. So that, for me, is really the most important thing and something that I will continue to monitor and probably we'll talk in this episode.
00:13:02.808 - 00:13:19.564, Speaker A: Yeah. Base just hit 16 transactions a second, surpassed Ethan pretty remarkable. I mean, hats off to the base team, right? A week or two after or however long it's been live already past ETH. So hats off. Where do you want to go next? Let's talk Tornado, I think.
00:13:20.144 - 00:13:25.816, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a development that came out yesterday. We were Thursday, so that was Wednesday.
00:13:25.960 - 00:13:43.034, Speaker A: Yeah. So the update for folks, I can share it right here. DOJ just arrested Tornado. Cash co founder Roman Storm and a couple other folks were involved in this piece. I don't know if you were able to read the piece, but. And there are OFac sanctions against Roman Seminov as well. The two.
00:13:43.034 - 00:14:25.874, Speaker A: Let me just read some of the blockworks piece. Two co founders of Tornado Cash were charged with us federal money laundering and sanctions violations on Wednesday. One of the co founders, Roman Semenov, was additionally added to the Office of Foreign Assets controls specially designated nationals list. Roman Storm, who's the other co founder, they're both deemed responsible for laundering upwards of $1 billion in criminal proceeds through the mixing service, which if you guys haven't used tornado before, it's this mixing service. And. Yeah, I mean, that's kind of the update. The first important thing, I think, to understand is that the US government only attributed 7% of the activity in tornado cash to illegal activity.
00:14:25.874 - 00:15:14.416, Speaker A: They continue to make this claim in the piece that the quote unquote majority is illicit, but they only attribute 7% of the activity in tornado cash to illegal activity. And so then I think that begs the question, well, what are they really going after here? Why are they really going after this if it's 93% is legal activity? And I think the key to the government's argument here, this account, Seth for privacy, had a great thread on it. The key to the government's argument now is profit instead of custody. Their previous key argument in precedent cases was about the custody of these funds. Now it's about the profit. And there was this piece where they talked about the torn token, the tornado cash token. And I think without torn, I doubt there's a case to be made at all here.
00:15:14.416 - 00:15:43.666, Speaker A: And I think this case is kind of turning from custody and illegal activity. And they've started to realize that maybe there hasn't been as much illegal activity happening on this platform as they once thought. I think the court is now going to start to focus on the profit motives as there was this kind of, you know, maybe as they would call it, clear profit motive at stake for the founders indicted here. So I don't know. I think it's a pivotal moment here. I think it's a real shame. I don't, I'm, I'm sure I'll get some, some backlash for this, but I think it's a real shame to go after tornado cash.
00:15:43.666 - 00:16:07.944, Speaker A: And I think that this, I would call it neutral tech, um, should be able to remain standing. And I think that you should go after the bad actors. You shouldn't go after the platforms that enable the bad actors. And I think we're seeing another, this is Napster 2.0, this is, this is um, you know, like Ross Ulbricht all over again. Like this is, I think we, I think we're going after the wrong folks here.
00:16:08.924 - 00:16:57.004, Speaker B: I agree. It's a very pivotal moment in terms of privacy, which is, you know, fundamental, you know, right in my mind. And there's all, there's a couple of things that people way smarter than I have commented and brought attention to. One is the idea between, you know, developing code and publishing code and the implications that that may have or historically hasn't had. And this obviously is not an example of that precedent. And the nuance here is that these developers, they sort of burned the keys at some point and then, you know what, for people that just sort of means that they're not able to take down the protocol. Once you print the keys, it gets out in the wild.
00:16:57.004 - 00:17:38.290, Speaker B: You deployed this working thing and it's just going to live on forever. And so you don't have control over making modifications. No one can really kind of force your hand. But then there are some arguments that like they've thought about changing the front end and making some things like that was, I think a big part of what I will think be what gets argued in court. You know, their motive and their intention of what they could or could have not done because they, you know, at one point spurned the keys. So I was gonna be interesting to follow. You know, some folks were pretty witty and just framing it analogue saying, hey, messaging services or car developers.
00:17:38.290 - 00:18:55.100, Speaker B: Okay, well there's, you know, certain illicit activity happens and people are using messaging services to communicate. Does that make you liable if you developed a car and cars get used by, you know, criminals, does that also make you lie? Like where does it stop? I think a big part of going back to your original comment that, you know, that the 6% numbers is low is a lot of it in part of enabling what is a very clear enemy of the state, which is in the OFAC sanctions, which is North Korea. Like Lazarus group has been behind very large hacks and some protocols like Ronin and a few others and they've used tornado to kind of launder these funds. And I think that's, in my thinking, that's probably the biggest issue here, which is you basically have allowed a clear enemy of the state to use a piece of technology, tornado cast to get funding. And that's very problematic. I think that's a large motivator. I won't say all of it, but you can't know for sure.
00:18:55.100 - 00:18:57.166, Speaker B: But I think that's a big piece of it, right?
00:18:57.310 - 00:19:23.862, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, exactly. I think it has to go to the courts, obviously. But, like, this would set a horrible precedent, right? It would say it would kind of allow this stretching of the term money transmission, and it would really expand the reach of these KYC AML laws to practically every non custodial privacy privacy tool. And if you think about that, you know, maybe that even includes atomic swaps. Right. Maybe it includes non custodial dexs. Right.
00:19:23.862 - 00:19:41.224, Speaker A: And I think this, like, this logic that a non custodial service has to implement KYC AML without prior precedent or legal impetus for this is just this absurd claim. But it would all. But if it got pushed through the courts, like, it would have this very. It would have a very negative impact on Defi.
00:19:42.124 - 00:19:43.204, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely.
00:19:43.324 - 00:19:44.024, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:19:44.524 - 00:20:08.092, Speaker B: Yeah. I remember when this first came out. This was months ago. Right. One of the founders got put in jail, Alex, I believe, who resides in the Netherlands. He got put in jail and then released, I think, on bail. And we brought on, we talked about it in the regulatory episodes.
00:20:08.092 - 00:20:51.358, Speaker B: We will talk about it when we have Rebecca and Jake back again around. What is the precedent, as you mentioned, where is that placed in other defi apps? And I think that's sometimes. Sometimes, you know, they go after a specific kind of the, this feels certainly more on the edge. Right. Which is, you know, closer to enabling, like just laundering and just, you know, funds, if you will. But then that sets a really bad precedent for some, like, you know, uniswap and other amms and whatnot. So, yeah, it has unintended consequences, second order effects.
00:20:51.358 - 00:20:58.958, Speaker B: I think it will be heavily, you know, argued in court and probably peeled back to some extent as a hope.
00:20:59.006 - 00:21:24.404, Speaker A: At least, I think. Yeah. Here's my, just maybe my concluding thoughts on this is that I think that it comes down to whether or not you believe technology itself is morally neutral or is a good or a bad thing. And for me, I think technology itself is morally neutral. Right. It can be used for good or for bad, depending on the intentions and the actions of the people who create and use it. And I don't think developers of technology are, you know, are inherently evil or good oftentimes.
00:21:24.404 - 00:22:05.124, Speaker A: And I think that the responsibility lies with those who choose to use technology unethically. Right. For example, like a cyber criminal who hacks into a private data is more culpable than the programmer who made the hacking tools. And I think, you know, a lot of people might bring up the Oppenheimer example with nuclear technology. I don't think the person who pioneered nuclear energy, nuclear energy is inherently evil. Maybe someone who creates bombs might, or who drops bombs might be evil, but someone who creates, uses nuclear energy to power a city is a good person. Or maybe you could also look at algorithms, right? Developers who create algorithms to maximize engagement.
00:22:05.124 - 00:22:17.444, Speaker A: I wouldn't say they're, you know, they're, they're evil. But maybe companies that have, that enable algorithms to spread misinformation, I would say they're not doing a good thing. But then there are also companies that use algorithms in a good way.
00:22:17.484 - 00:22:56.074, Speaker B: So the key is intent and motive. And I think that's what's going to be the point here in the defense and the argument in court, which is you could argue, and that the motivation here was to have privacy. And I think, you know, reasonably speaking, you want to have privacy. You have privacy in the financial system. Like, it is vital to be able to have the, the possibility to have privacy in a crypto context. And, and that is, I think, I think that is, is a valid defense. And so, yeah, we'll see.
00:22:56.074 - 00:23:02.204, Speaker B: I think it's going to be very interesting how this gets interpreted and resolved in court, if you will.
00:23:02.244 - 00:23:27.854, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm in this chat with some different crypto founders, and one of them posted this thing that I have been thinking about this morning, which is he said, it makes a lot of us in this industry who are agnostic to the use cases of the technology we build. Think twice about whether we could potentially be scapegoats. If a bad actor uses such technology for evil, this then limits innovation. Yeah, and I've just been thinking about that this morning, so.
00:23:29.114 - 00:23:30.694, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely.
00:23:32.594 - 00:24:05.048, Speaker A: Hey, everyone, we'll get back to empire in just a minute. But before we do that, I want to let you know that we have permissionless coming up. Permissionless is big conference that blockworks and bankless put on together. It is the biggest, the best DeFi conference in crypto this year. It is in Austin, Texas, September 11 through 13th. If you've been in crypto for a while, you know that bear market conferences are the best kind of conferences we have a phenomenal lineup of speakers. A lot of the guests that you hear on Empire are both going to be speaking there.
00:24:05.048 - 00:24:28.866, Speaker A: You will have the opportunity to meet them there. And a lot of the topics that we cover on Empire, ZK tech roll ups, account abstraction, Mev app chain, thesis, a lot of that kind of stuff. That will all be discussed at permissionless this year. So because you are a listener of Empire, you get a special discount. That's right. Santi and I negotiated with our marketing team. You get 30% off.
00:24:28.866 - 00:24:46.182, Speaker A: If you go to blockworks.com forward slash permissionless, Empire 30 is going to get you 30% off your ticket. Today, when I'm recording this, that's about $300 off your ticket. So type in Empire 30. When buying your permissionless ticket, you get about $300 off. Click the link at the bottom of this app episode. It's in the show notes.
00:24:46.182 - 00:25:19.424, Speaker A: Do it quickly because prices go up all the time. And if you are going to permissionless, hit me up, let me know. Shoot me a DM on Twitter. I would love to meet up with you there. All right, let's look at the Coinbase circle deal. So, pretty exciting announcement between Jeremy Allaire and Brian Armstrong are really circling Coinbase this week, which is that Coinbase has now taken a stake in circle and, quote, commits to the long term success of USDC. So if you remember, USCC was actually created by this consortium, or I guess this partnership between Circle and Coinbase a couple of years ago.
00:25:19.424 - 00:25:52.200, Speaker A: Now, Coinbase actually has bought an equity stake in circle. And there's a couple of changes that come from that. First, with this new approach to the partnership, the two are shuttering their center consortium, which is this group that I mentioned, this governance group that was created five years ago to oversee USDC. And Circle is actually bringing the governance and the operations of USDC in house. So that's one big update. The second update is that USDC is now going to launch on six new chains. So they're on a couple of chains right now.
00:25:52.200 - 00:26:12.974, Speaker A: Between September and October, USDC is going to launch on base, near optimism, Polkadot, Polygon, and I think cosmos. Um, so, yeah, pretty. I don't know, pretty exciting. Um, yeah, pretty exciting for circle and. And for Coinbase.
00:26:14.154 - 00:26:20.426, Speaker B: Yeah, I think there was also a piece of, like, the net interest income that they receive being split.
00:26:20.610 - 00:26:24.914, Speaker A: Yeah, let me read that, because that was actually very interesting. Bullish for Coinbase.
00:26:24.954 - 00:26:27.050, Speaker B: Right? Yeah, that's what I was thinking. Yeah.
00:26:27.242 - 00:26:43.756, Speaker A: So let me. Let me pull this up somewhere. Uh, the. Here, I got it. Right here. The revenue will continue to be shared based on the amount of USDC held on each of our platforms. And additionally, we will now equally share an interest income generated from the broader distribution usage of USDC.
00:26:43.756 - 00:26:46.644, Speaker A: That's what you're talking about, right? Yeah, yeah.
00:26:46.764 - 00:27:24.324, Speaker B: I mean, the comp here is sizable. Tether is. Tether is one of the largest holders of treasuries in the world, more so than a lot of sovereigns. I mean, I think it's a top ten holder holds more treasuries in like, certain countries. And it is, I think, their latest reporting, I mean, it is making a sizable amount of yield on those treasuries. And so in a similar manner, you can think about that being an important line item in Coinbase's financials over time. The thing is, some people might argue, is the dominance of USDC has gone down.
00:27:24.324 - 00:27:50.784, Speaker B: And I don't really know or can explain that candidly. I don't know if you've seen some analysis to point to as to why that is, but certainly, like the USDC is a percentage of, like all stable coins has gone down, tether continues to go up. And so maybe this is, you know, them launching in six different chains reignites their growth and their kind of position in the broader stablecoin market.
00:27:52.364 - 00:28:11.804, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know. I don't really know why it's been going down, but. But I agree. Yeah, I'm surprised that. I'm surprised Coinbase's stock hasn't changed or that the outlook for q three is unchanged here between base. Between this announcement and base. Imagine, like, well, I mean, this goes.
00:28:11.844 - 00:29:20.752, Speaker B: Back to the point of, I fundamentally believe the markets are not efficient and that sometimes, and you would argue we're more connected now, there's access to information more so than ever before. But sometimes things go, you know, the coverage that you get, one, a lot of the market is passive, right? Like you have a growing share of just flows going through passive mutual funds like fidelities of the world that are not very actively managed and, and they're not paying, maybe they're not paying attention to it or, and, or they don't understand the full story. And so it's sort of like, what do you believe in that other don't? What do you understand that others don't? And so, I mean, a full disclosure, I've been, I've been, I've been looking at Coinbase stock for a while. I have exposure to it. I think it's, it's a, you know, and then, and then it rallied a ton once Bau post, which is one of the most smartest, I think guys out there, we think about smart guys in the room like Seth Klarman. Incredibly smart. He had some battle posts and they bought the bonds and they were trading like, they dipped all the way to $0.40
00:29:20.752 - 00:29:43.756, Speaker B: on the dollar and now they're trading at like $0.62. Coinbase is now tendering those bonds. I think they have billing bonds outstanding, the three and a quarter coupon they're tendering, which means they want to buy back those bonds, like sixty seven cents, and they're not getting any interest from investors. And so not surprising. I mean, I think this, these are sort of things. Of course, credit story is different than equity story. Like, owning a bond is very different than owning a stock.
00:29:43.756 - 00:29:55.964, Speaker B: But, um. But yeah, I think. I think this is a prime example of the market may sometimes just does not understand the story.
00:29:56.124 - 00:29:56.532, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:29:56.588 - 00:30:08.620, Speaker B: And it goes like, not just, not just crypto, by the way, just over time, there have been pockets of. Of the market that are just not understood by analysts. You can argue nuclear has gone through that phase.
00:30:08.772 - 00:30:14.904, Speaker A: I still think. I think Wall street thinks of Coinbase is just a crypto exchange and they think about Wall street as a crypto.
00:30:15.364 - 00:30:41.094, Speaker B: We're in a world where volume is down a ton, the fees are going down, volume is down. It's in a bear market. There's no interest, which is true, but they don't appreciate. Maybe the business model just goes through an entire transformation where it becomes more of a, you know, fees attached to subscriptions and, you know, base and sequencer revenue and, and that an interest income from the stable coin.
00:30:41.214 - 00:30:41.566, Speaker A: Right.
00:30:41.630 - 00:30:46.598, Speaker B: And so that, that just changes. Right. And so anyways, so I have a.
00:30:46.606 - 00:30:56.446, Speaker A: Maybe a personal question for you. I don't know if you're comfortable sharing this. When you buy, like when you buy Coinbase, you're talking about these bonds. Like, do you buy the bonds? Do you buy the stock? Do you like, how do you think about that?
00:30:56.630 - 00:31:24.990, Speaker B: That's a great question. I mean, it depends on the price. It really fundamentally, I'm of the mind and I truly believe I ascribe to Howard Marks, which is the founder of Oak Tree. His whole thinking is price is the big determinant. You could buy a great company at a terrible price, makes for a bad investment. You could buy a terrible company at a great price, makes for fantastic investment. And so I started looking more closely Coinbase, when.
00:31:24.990 - 00:32:20.744, Speaker B: When it dipped to like, close to $30, $32, $33 and the bonds were like, really gone. You know, when there's excessive amount of negativity and everyone's calling for, like, you know, something's dead, I just go to that and I pay attention. That, and that was what ultimately led me to Coinbase. The question that I've always asked over time, people, is, as you think about interest in the space, how are people going to allocate in their portfolio if they want crypto exposure absent an ETF? Coinbase is an important avenue to do that. And so if you, as I think about my overall crypto portfolio, Coinbase is an interesting way to get exposure to just how the overall market will play. They're them wanting crypto exposure. And so.
00:32:20.744 - 00:32:46.732, Speaker B: So, yeah, that was, I didn't buy the bonds. I just haven't been a credit guy my entire life. I thought they were interesting. I talked to a bunch of other folks around it. My rationing was, my back then was I'd rather just have exposure to the equity. And I didn't actually invest directly into equity. I think I mentioned this in a prior episode.
00:32:46.732 - 00:33:24.346, Speaker B: I did it through like a complex structure where it's called like a phoenix note, quite, quite popular. And basically it's like a structured note where I'm getting paid a very high coupon with a barrier. So that essentially says, like today the price is at $70, right. You say, okay, I'm gonna. It gets issued today. You have downside protection, meaning if the stock doesn't go down 30% or 40%, you're getting paid a quarterly coupon. And at the end of, in six months, it can be called, it's usually a year of maturity.
00:33:24.346 - 00:33:40.552, Speaker B: And so what happens if the price of Coinbase stays within a range of the strike, like the issue price and the barrier, which is lower, then you get paid that coupon. If it dips below that, then you actually get settled in chairs and you end up owning Coinbase.
00:33:40.688 - 00:33:41.724, Speaker A: Like an option.
00:33:42.224 - 00:34:33.872, Speaker B: Yeah, but you're getting paid a super high coupon because it's a very volatile name. So the coupon on this thing is like 30, 40, 50%. So what is that? So my thinking was, and just, this is a strategy that I've been deploying in my entire portfolio, which is, I'm not like, do I like it at this price? I don't know, but would I like it 30% lower? Absolutely. And in the meantime, if I'm getting paid a really high coupon, I just cost average my way down. And this is something that I've played around for the last year. And a half because generally I'm uneasy where equities are trading. And so it's a great way to get income while also potentially, if it dips below that, I just think my margin of safety going back to what Seth Klarman talks about, like, I love the possibility of just owning something 2030, 40% lower than what it is now.
00:34:33.872 - 00:34:40.956, Speaker B: If I don't end up owning it, I still get a really high coupon. Great. And so I minimize kind of my opportunity cost.
00:34:41.140 - 00:34:48.624, Speaker A: That's smart. I always thought Phoenix notes were like, that were a type of bond that was issued by a company emerging from bankruptcy. But I might be wrong there.
00:34:48.924 - 00:34:51.172, Speaker B: Well, this might be interesting.
00:34:51.268 - 00:34:54.612, Speaker A: All right, that's good to know. I have another question for you on.
00:34:54.628 - 00:34:57.132, Speaker B: Coinbase for a reminder that none of this is financial advice. Okay?
00:34:57.148 - 00:35:03.104, Speaker A: Yeah. Right. Well, I have another question for you here. What are the main reasons why a company would buy back their bonds?
00:35:03.764 - 00:35:17.284, Speaker B: Well, because they're buying it at the, you know, if they. If they issued a nominal, like at a dollar. Right. The principal is a billion, but they're buying back, like they're. They're repaying that debt and they're essentially like saving $300 million.
00:35:17.444 - 00:35:18.144, Speaker A: Right.
00:35:18.644 - 00:35:33.128, Speaker B: Like, you're buying that debt at a discount. You're. You're terminating that. So you effectively got, you know, 30% for free. It's a real low coupon, to be fair. Like three and a quarter. If they were to issue those bonds again, they were not, that coupon would be much, much, much higher.
00:35:33.128 - 00:35:37.284, Speaker B: They issued those bonds right when they were going public. There's a lot of interest.
00:35:38.184 - 00:35:51.724, Speaker A: Yeah. They get to reduce the debt. They get to reduce the future interest costs, manage the bond maturities. Kind of, yeah. It also probably sends a kind of signals a strong strength to the market. Yeah. Helps increase, like, future earnings by retiring the bond.
00:35:51.724 - 00:35:52.448, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:35:52.456 - 00:35:58.862, Speaker B: But you retire debt at a. At $0.60 on the dollar. Well, you just got a bunch of money for free.
00:35:58.958 - 00:36:12.714, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Interesting. All right, last cool thing that happened this week, Shopify enabled USDC payments via Solana pay integration. There was a good tweet by a circle guy. Hold on, let me pull this up.
00:36:13.374 - 00:36:17.238, Speaker B: Yeah. Which basically talks about the percentage of fees. Yeah.
00:36:17.286 - 00:36:47.422, Speaker A: Okay. Patrick Hansen. So Patrick Hansen is a director, EU strategy and policy at Circle. So he said Shopify accounts for 10%, which is just a crazy number. 10% of total US e commerce and $444 billion worth of global economic activity. The average cost per transaction using Solana pay and USDC is 0.0025. So 0.02
00:36:47.422 - 00:37:05.822, Speaker A: $0.05 versus roughly 2% credit card fees on Shopify, which if anyone's ever used Shopify before, it's usually more like three to 4%. So, yeah, I think it's pretty interesting. What do you make of this? Because if you remember, this was a. I feel like I've seen this before. Right. I feel like.
00:37:05.822 - 00:37:24.536, Speaker A: Do you remember in 2018 when Coinbase turned on, like, e commerce stuff and they launched crypto payments? And so my first thing was like, I've seen this before. But then my second thing was, yeah, but in 2018, we didn't have tens of billions of dollars of stable coins. No one was buying things in bitcoin and ETH. Right.
00:37:24.600 - 00:37:27.040, Speaker B: You didn't even have USCC back then, I believe.
00:37:27.112 - 00:37:33.924, Speaker A: Right, right. So I think actually, no, it is hugely bullish. Yeah, so it is, it is.
00:37:35.104 - 00:38:15.264, Speaker B: Look, I think the question is, the skeptic here might say, well, merchants are not going to want this thing called stablecoin, USDC, but I think over time, that's just going to prove to be. I think the adoption of USDC is incredibly bullish. Payments is something that we've all is one of those areas that is easy to dismiss, to your point, because it hasn't worked before. Like Coinbase, commerce shut down, it didn't get enough steam and. But I think credibly, payments with stable coins should be a massive component of. Of crypto usage and adoption. Like, it's just, it's just people wanting to not hold local currencies because of volatility.
00:38:15.264 - 00:38:36.874, Speaker B: And they want to have dollars. Well, you can do that very easily with stable coins. Basically, digital dollar us is held like, there's a dollar that is held in a bank account. We get comfortable with Coinbase and how they do it. And the counterparty risk, well, you know, it's back dollar for dollar in a bank account. Like, it's when they publish a reserve, they publish kind of who their counterparties are. And so I think it's very interesting.
00:38:36.874 - 00:39:24.222, Speaker B: I think to your point, a lot of times it is important to revisit things that you were bullish on and your thesis from back. And because something hasn't worked before doesn't mean it won't work again, particularly how fast technology changes and the environment is different this time. And so I think certainly, like with Solana versus ETH, you know, the transaction fees are very, very low. One of the biggest criticisms back then, before Solano and Ethereum was, well, wait a minute, like, gas rates are really high, and then that 2% 3%. While true. So actually, in certain instances, the gas fee on the layer one was very high, $8, $9, $12. And the spikes really made it difficult.
00:39:24.222 - 00:39:48.042, Speaker B: Right. To see a world where you would have billions of e commerce flow going through an l one. Well, now you have an l two, and now you have a cheaper environment like Solana. Well, okay, that's very different. Where you're not only a parity, you're actually way below that two, 3% per transaction. So on the absolute cost. And so that's quite different.
00:39:48.178 - 00:40:15.650, Speaker A: Yeah. Here would be. My skeptics take. My skeptics take, is that the, if you look at the 3% fees that Shopify takes or 2% fees that Shopify takes, we're all assuming that that is a. An infrastructure cost. We're all assuming that the infrastructure that they have, those 2% fees go to covering the technology, hardware, software, personnel, infrastructure costs required to operate a payments network. And by using USDC or crypto, you bring down those infrastructure costs.
00:40:15.650 - 00:40:38.842, Speaker A: There's a bucket, though, that. There's another big bucket, though, that I think people in crypto maybe don't talk about, which is the risk fees. And these are the fees that account for a significant portion, I think, of that, of the payment fees of the 2%, because when a financial institution takes on payments, they're also taking on the risk and liability of processing, processing those payments. Right. And so, like the settlement.
00:40:38.898 - 00:40:39.570, Speaker B: Right.
00:40:39.762 - 00:40:56.676, Speaker A: The settlement rate, the risk, the, like two or 3% fees help cover the costs related to things like fraud prevention, verification, payment reversals, chargebacks, things like that. And so that is, that is not something that this solves. Right. So.
00:40:56.740 - 00:41:12.468, Speaker B: Well, no, hold on there. It actually does. Right. Because these transactions are absolute. Like they're, they're settled. The finality is there, like, when you think about prod, like you, like, no, it doesn't happen. Like, what is, like, basically not a primer.
00:41:12.468 - 00:41:13.004, Speaker B: This is not.
00:41:13.044 - 00:41:14.940, Speaker A: I see what you're saying. You can't call a Bank of America.
00:41:14.972 - 00:41:36.884, Speaker B: And say this was like interchange fees. Like the whole, the whole banking system is like. Is a clusterfuck of patchwork of things that have been developed since the sixties and just put together. And you keep adding on top of this patchwork that is highly inefficient and the communications slow and the settlement slow. And so all of that introduces risk. Right. But think about, like, when you're paying, you're swiping your credit card.
00:41:36.884 - 00:42:15.834, Speaker B: The merchant doesn't get the money immediately. And these, you know, your credit card pays them net 20 and at 30, depending on the side merchant. And then what happens on the back end is sort of these two banks need to talk to each other, make sure you have your money and all this sort of stuff. That's where there's incredible amount of fees, interchange fee and merchant fee, and all these sort of things to cover for these possible risks and also just processing overhead. But when you're settling a stable coin, like, it's like you're transferring a stable coin, there's no verification, there's no KYC, there's finality. Well, you could have KYC that's separate. But the reality is, like, there's no fraud.
00:42:15.834 - 00:42:39.234, Speaker B: Like, there's no. Like, it's sort of. The settlement is instantaneous or near instantaneous, and it's final. And the working capital component for merchants is also hugely impactful. Like, you're getting that money immediately. So anyways, there's a whole host of things. Why settling and staying your merchant? Very interesting.
00:42:39.234 - 00:43:39.472, Speaker B: I think there is a category in crypto that will emerge, which is the reward component. By using these. This mechanism, you know, right now, you don't get points if you're using your USDC. But I think there's an opportunity for someone to come in here and say, hey, we're gonna give you points reusing USDC if you're settling on this, right? And presumably a merchant might give you a discount because why? Because instead, compared to when they would much rather get the stable coin, right. If they have a very clear, like, if they can swap us to see for dollars very quickly on Coinbase, you're the merchant where you're getting that money immediately. You're not waiting 2030 days to get that money from American Express or visa. And if that's the case, then they should just issue you, Jason, if you're swiping with a gnosis safe card, right, visa, and you're immediately transferring that USDC to the merchant, the working capital, like the present value of that is higher, and so they can offer you a discount, right, some reward or whatever.
00:43:39.472 - 00:44:09.246, Speaker B: And so that that whole category is going to probably is nascent, but I think will become more and more important to incentivize people to use this mechanism, because the merchant would much rather get that money immediately. It's hugely beneficial. Small businesses get crushed by credit card. This is why the famous Amex doesn't work in Europe. Because mercury only take, like. Because Amex is notoriously known for really having bad terms, especially for smaller merchants, which need it most. The working capital piece makes or breaks your operation.
00:44:09.246 - 00:44:13.814, Speaker B: So anyways, this is going to be very important for e commerce, I think.
00:44:13.934 - 00:44:17.806, Speaker A: Yeah. Little secret, they do take Amex. They just get crushed on the fees too much.
00:44:17.870 - 00:44:21.194, Speaker B: Yeah, they do. They do. Like, they have a terminal. They just don't want.
00:44:21.774 - 00:44:22.500, Speaker A: They just run.
00:44:22.542 - 00:44:27.808, Speaker B: They'd much rather use you visa or pay cash. Right. A lot of people want just cash because they want to. Obviously.
00:44:27.936 - 00:45:04.392, Speaker A: There's actually an amazing. The best piece I've read about this is by David Marcus, who was head of messenger at Facebook and then became head of Novi and was running their pay, was running their stable coin and then left to build this thing in the lightning space. We should actually really have David on, but he wrote a piece in 2019 called why building a new protocol for money is the only way to truly change the game for people. It's quick readers, like five minutes. I'm going to link it in the show notes here. But if you really think about the payments, I mean, I'm very excited by this because I think the payments narrative has been dead for years and I think it's coming back now that USDC and stablecoins are a big thing. And if you look at the current payment system, it's so broken.
00:45:04.392 - 00:45:22.346, Speaker A: Right. Existing networks like Ach and Swift, they're built in the seventies, 55 years ago, and they're close to outsiders wallets. Right. Venmo cash app, they're not connected. They literally don't talk to each other. Moving money from country to country takes too much time, too much money, too high fees, merchant fees. Crazy.
00:45:22.346 - 00:45:25.094, Speaker A: And I think stable coins really do fix that.
00:45:25.674 - 00:45:26.410, Speaker B: Yep.
00:45:26.562 - 00:45:29.734, Speaker A: So, santi, man, good to be back.
00:45:30.234 - 00:45:36.974, Speaker B: It's great to be back. Yeah. Any, anything else that we should cover? Any books, documentaries?
00:45:41.354 - 00:46:02.516, Speaker A: Watching this documentary on Netflix about cold callers. The first. Are you really telemarketing? The first telemarketing business? Yeah, it's like something. It is a sad. Yeah. The two things I was like, the two things I had lined up were like that and then that. The Jared from subway documentary where he ends up really, you know, I like a child abuser.
00:46:02.516 - 00:46:06.100, Speaker A: I think it was. I was like, oh, man, I'm going down two dark rabbit holes here.
00:46:06.172 - 00:46:07.948, Speaker B: What's going on? Yeah, no, I told you.
00:46:07.956 - 00:46:23.458, Speaker A: I've been getting. I've been watching, like, fellow media company Hodinkee. I've been like, I've probably watched 100 hours of Hodinkee things like every talking watches, every, like all the John Mayer interviews, they just did this great thing with Ed Sheeran. I've been going deep into the Hodinkee rabbit hole.
00:46:23.626 - 00:46:34.418, Speaker B: Nice. Yeah. Corona 24 is another big company in the space. They just raised. They've been around for a while. They raised some capital from General Atlantic and I feel, I think General Atlantic, but then most recently, Cristiano Ronaldo, just, you know, it's interesting.
00:46:34.466 - 00:46:59.206, Speaker A: Hodinkee is this really. I mean, from a media company perspective, I like studying them. They did over 100 million in revenue last year. They started watch blog, and then they launched the marketplace, actually. So it's this really interesting evolution of, like, media into e commerce, which other folks, like meat eater, did 100 million in revenue. They're like a blog into e commerce. Food 52 does a shit ton of revenue just selling, like, pots and pans and stuff.
00:46:59.206 - 00:47:04.446, Speaker A: They started as a food blog. So they're all churning group companies. Churning groups. Best in the world at doing this.
00:47:04.630 - 00:47:05.558, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:47:05.686 - 00:47:06.134, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:47:06.214 - 00:47:07.230, Speaker B: Yeah. No, that's.
00:47:07.342 - 00:47:08.030, Speaker A: What are you watching?
00:47:08.102 - 00:47:30.744, Speaker B: I'm looking at my kindle right now. I reading anatomy breakthrough. So far, I'm like a third of the way out. Interesting. I wouldn't say, like, earth shattering. It's about, like, how to get unstuck and, like, you know, if you have writer's block or, you know, like, I don't know. It's.
00:47:30.744 - 00:47:59.980, Speaker B: It's interesting. And then I read Mister China. I think I mentioned this before. It's a book that was, like, you know, written by a guy who was one of first pioneers in the nineties and, like, turn of the century, raising huge amounts of money in the US to go invest, like, private equity money to invest in chinese businesses, and basically got rugged, like, raised, I think, over billions of dollars and just like, into a bunch of stuff that end up working.
00:48:00.012 - 00:48:03.132, Speaker A: Oh, is this about, um, Tim, Tim Clissold, the british guy?
00:48:03.148 - 00:48:17.796, Speaker B: I believe so, yes. Yes. So it was, like, highly recommended and it was. I'm fascinated by China. I've read a bunch of stuff on it from Kissinger's book to a few others, and just understanding the psychology. It's a very different market. And so I don't pretend to understand it.
00:48:17.796 - 00:48:55.056, Speaker B: I don't speak Mandarin, but I am fascinated by it. I think it's a big. Obviously, what they're doing. Crypto is interesting now that the west seems to be taking a more dogmatic stance to this technology, whereas now China, Hong Kong, Singapore, the east in general has been more. Has taken a more pro stance, statistically speaking. I think we ought to be seeing more projects come out of the region, but we haven't, at least not to my understanding, but I think there are some interesting fonts and people out there that, you know, that are like scroll, for instance, and step in, like all these projects based out there. So, yeah, I'm really fascinated by it.
00:48:55.056 - 00:49:41.694, Speaker B: I think always studying asian markets would have been highly beneficial for a lot of people that were dismissive or we thought it was just copycat nations, but I think it's very important, particularly, like how they've totally leapfrogged, like in the fintech space, like how people interact and how they just. The way commerce happens there. Like WeChat, actually. Another great book, the story of WeChat, or intense, like, very interesting. And so anyways, I'm always kind of curious about books that talk about the region to get an insider perspective and better understanding. So this one was good. I expected more because it was so hyped, but it was fun to read.
00:49:42.274 - 00:49:49.178, Speaker A: You know what book I just read that you would love is the Dream of Salomeo by Brunello Cuccinelli.
00:49:49.266 - 00:49:51.106, Speaker B: Oh, I've heard about this one.
00:49:51.250 - 00:49:53.586, Speaker A: Yeah, you would really like it. You'd really like it.
00:49:53.610 - 00:49:56.214, Speaker B: So I just read that basically transformed the entire town.
00:49:56.854 - 00:49:59.398, Speaker A: Yeah, transform Solomeo and.
00:49:59.566 - 00:50:00.510, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:50:00.622 - 00:50:11.158, Speaker A: It's like he's all about like humanistic capitalism, which is this kind of fluffy thing, I think oftentimes when, like, us folks talk about it, but he's, he's done it well, so it also helps that he can sell a scar for $8,000.
00:50:11.246 - 00:50:13.754, Speaker B: So it's crazy. Yeah, that brand is.
00:50:14.934 - 00:50:15.998, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:50:16.046 - 00:50:16.678, Speaker B: Pricey.
00:50:16.806 - 00:50:17.726, Speaker A: Pricey.
00:50:17.910 - 00:50:22.070, Speaker B: All right, man, that's awesome. Well, it was a good roundup. Welcome back, sir. It's good to be back, folks.
00:50:22.102 - 00:50:32.356, Speaker A: I forgot to say hiring engineers and salespeople. I was supposed to say that at the very beginning. If you're still listening at this point, you hopefully like clockworks enough. We're hiring salespeople and we're hiring engineers. Full stack.
00:50:32.500 - 00:50:35.508, Speaker B: Is this a lot for the research platform?
00:50:35.676 - 00:51:01.334, Speaker A: We're hiring engineers both on the editorial side of the business and to make our media site better. And then also on the research, analytics and governance side, we're launching this big thing in three weeks of permissionless. We're really scaling up that platform. And then we're hiring on the sales side for advertising and sponsorships. So if you want to work with Coinbase's CMO to help them advertise across our platforms, that's a good one.
00:51:02.074 - 00:51:02.842, Speaker B: Great.
00:51:03.018 - 00:51:03.802, Speaker A: Cool.
00:51:03.978 - 00:51:15.088, Speaker B: That's awesome. All right, folks, well, thanks for tuning in, as always. Drop your comments if you want us to talk about something or you don't like x or Y. Otherwise, we'll be back.
00:51:15.226 - 00:51:17.164, Speaker A: Santi loves those YouTube comments.
00:51:17.324 - 00:51:19.900, Speaker B: I do. I actually. I spend an ordinary amount of time looking at comments.
00:51:19.972 - 00:51:23.060, Speaker A: You read every. You gotta start commenting on them.
00:51:23.212 - 00:51:23.836, Speaker B: No, of course.
00:51:23.860 - 00:51:27.748, Speaker A: I feel like it really impacts your day. You're like, someone's like, oh, Santi had a bad haircut.
00:51:27.836 - 00:51:39.588, Speaker B: This is why you think I'm gonna go on friend deck and see my price collapse. Like, I'll have a mental breakdown. I'm still having mental breakdowns out here reading comics, but, uh. So I'm not prepared to go on friend. I can't. No. Brave new world, man.
00:51:39.676 - 00:51:42.456, Speaker A: Yeah. All right, guys, we'll see you next week, right?
00:51:42.600 - 00:51:43.024, Speaker B: Take care, everyone.
