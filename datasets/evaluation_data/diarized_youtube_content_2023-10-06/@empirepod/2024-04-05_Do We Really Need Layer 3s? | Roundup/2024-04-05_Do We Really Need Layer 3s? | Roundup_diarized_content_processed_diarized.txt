00:00:00.280 - 00:00:19.822, Speaker A: The Twitter posting of either. There's two types of Twitter posters today. Meme coins are going to revolutionize society. Meme coins are the new culture coin, and they're the new. They represent the new community in a digital first world, and they're trying to basically play up what these meme coins are. Then there's the other side. Meme coins are the stupidest thing.
00:00:19.822 - 00:01:01.404, Speaker A: We're wasting brain power and energy, and they're neither. They're just something that people are trading and like, stop fucking pontificating on what these things are. I'm sick of all these meme coin hot takes. If you are an empire listener, hopefully you've played around on chain. And if you have done that, you know that transferring assets across different chains is a pain, to put it nicely, that is why we are incredibly excited to have the wormhole foundation as a partner of the Empire podcast Stewards of the Wormhole protocol, supporting over 30 different blockchains and six different runtimes. Stay tuned. Later in the show, we have a cool thing that you can claim, which is a wormhole nft just for empire listener.
00:01:01.404 - 00:01:32.942, Speaker A: This episode is brought to you by Monad, which has not only the highest performance evm l one architecture ever built, but also the wildest and craziest community in crypto. Monad's internal devnet is live and public. Testnet comes out soon, so make sure you join the Monad community today at discord. GG. Forward slash, Monad. M o n a D, Monad. All right, everyone, what's going on? You got two tired souls coming in, Santa.
00:01:32.942 - 00:01:33.934, Speaker A: What's happening, man?
00:01:34.094 - 00:01:43.806, Speaker B: Not much, man. Just another day. A lot to talk about. A lot of big day today, right? The wormhole air drop. Wormhole airdrop.
00:01:43.870 - 00:01:49.272, Speaker A: So I honestly have not, not looked. I'm kind of. I'm kind of over these airdrops.
00:01:49.398 - 00:02:05.740, Speaker B: I'm a little Murda shout out to murder. He had a great tweet about. He's like, yeah, being a maxi doesn't pay because I never bridged from ethereum to Solana. I never used the bridge because I've always been Solana native. So I didn't get the airdrop. I'm like, that checks out. Checks out.
00:02:05.812 - 00:02:16.880, Speaker A: Checks out. Yeah. So it's trading at a little 14. I feel like everyone's. Everything's trading in this range of $14 billion. 14 billion. Slid a little bit since it launched.
00:02:16.880 - 00:02:31.216, Speaker A: It launched at, what, one and a half? It's down to 140 or no, 130. It launched at. Went up to 150, slid to 140 total fully diluted valuations at 14,000,000,014.
00:02:31.280 - 00:02:35.880, Speaker B: Yeah, just a little bit. It was trading in, what is it? Evo secondary market.
00:02:35.952 - 00:02:38.560, Speaker A: Like 2017.
00:02:38.672 - 00:02:47.640, Speaker B: It was between 17 and 20. So these things are fairly accurate, actually have become fairly accurate, which is pretty good indicator, actually.
00:02:47.832 - 00:02:58.884, Speaker A: So Athena also launched an airdrop. Yes. They launched their token this week, and it's trading at a $2 billion valuation. What do you think is the logic and the decision?
00:03:00.144 - 00:03:03.204, Speaker B: I think fully diluted is much higher than that. It'll be twelve.
00:03:03.784 - 00:03:08.644, Speaker A: No, 2 billion. Is it okay on coingecko? It is.
00:03:09.524 - 00:03:10.380, Speaker B: Hold on.
00:03:10.532 - 00:03:23.300, Speaker A: Right. Oh, no, I'm looking, I think maybe hallucinating. I think I'm looking at the stable coin. Yeah. Yeah. It's 16. 16 billion fTV.
00:03:23.300 - 00:03:28.464, Speaker A: Ah, yes. So it's higher than wormhole. That's wild.
00:03:29.364 - 00:03:56.600, Speaker B: Yeah. People are young, people are chasing that yield. We can unpack all that. But listen, folks, just a word of advice here. When you see these things, just pay attention to fully diluted, pay attention to unlock schedules. There's good websites out there that will tell you when investors are unlocking. You never want to, you know, just for a second there, think about the relative value of something that is 17 billion.
00:03:56.600 - 00:04:07.318, Speaker B: Don't get me wrong, like, you know, things can go to much higher. Irrational. But, you know, I'm an early stage investor and I look at that and I'm always cautious.
00:04:07.406 - 00:04:07.750, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:04:07.822 - 00:04:27.150, Speaker B: I much rather let these next couple, like, whenever there's airdrops, I let kind of the market kind of, like, work its way through it for a couple of weeks, as people claim sell. There's a lot of chaos going on with market makers. So I. For me, I'd rather just kind of be on the sidelines.
00:04:27.302 - 00:04:37.314, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, you compare something like, so Athena 16 billion, wormhole 14 billion, then you compare that to something like arbitrum, right? Which is Athena 14 and a half.
00:04:39.614 - 00:04:46.634, Speaker B: Higher than arbitrum, higher than uniswap, higher than aave, higher than measure. Yeah.
00:04:47.254 - 00:04:52.190, Speaker A: So we got. We got that. We jumped. We jumped right in. You got the hat on today. Is that, uh.
00:04:52.342 - 00:04:53.622, Speaker B: It's freezing my room.
00:04:53.758 - 00:04:56.154, Speaker A: Are we with half for a reason, or.
00:04:57.174 - 00:05:12.364, Speaker B: I love. You know I love hats. Someone out there needs to get me this goddamn pink hat. Ansem, if you listen to this, I know you have a guy send me that guy because I want it. I just want it. So this is the closest thing.
00:05:14.624 - 00:05:18.324, Speaker A: I'm like, so I'm so over that. Okay, so I know.
00:05:18.984 - 00:05:19.728, Speaker B: Wait a minute.
00:05:19.816 - 00:05:48.700, Speaker A: What? I'm so over what? I'm so over the twitter, the twitter posting of either. There's two types of twitter posters today. Meme coins are going to revolutionize society. Meme coins are the new culture coin, and they're the new, they represent the new community in a digital first world, and they're trying to basically play up what these meme coins are. Then there's the other side. Meme coins are the stupidest thing. We're wasting brain power and energy, and they're neither.
00:05:48.700 - 00:06:00.624, Speaker A: They're just something that people are trading and, like, stop fucking pontificating on what these things are. I'm sick of all these meme coin hot takes. Just let the people trade.
00:06:01.324 - 00:06:24.052, Speaker B: Yeah. I've taken a more simplistic approach to not just meme coins, but just stuff in general. Ultimately, marketer markets are the arbiter of truth. No one really cares what you think. The market just rules. And so people are finding, look, it's pretty interesting I shared this with you before. The pod binance has done more volume, I think it was yesterday.
00:06:24.052 - 00:06:59.024, Speaker B: Finance has done more volume on with than on bitcoin. Now, I'm not making any conclusions. It's just an interesting data point. Coinbase, I believe when it listed bonk, it had multiple days where it just broke all kinds of records. And, you know, I. I'm a very laissez faire markets person. You know, I think people, if people are against meme coins, oftentimes, like, you get into these discussions, right? People are like, oh, I hate crypto, or I hate meme coins.
00:06:59.024 - 00:07:35.806, Speaker B: I'm like, do you also hate Las Vegas? Do you also hate sports betting, entertainment? And they're like, no, no, that's totally different. I'm like, is it? And so that's always my line of defense. Historically, I've tried to rationalize a lot of things, and I just like to just flip it to something that is very closely related to what they're attacking. Because oftentimes people just attack stuff that really contradicts another thing that they like. And so that's where you corner them, and you're like, all right, explain your flawed logic. So I've done that and just saves a lot of time and energy.
00:07:35.990 - 00:07:57.678, Speaker A: Yeah, there's this interesting chart I saw Luke Martin post on Twitter, which is. And then I'm gonna. I'm gonna allocate zero more time to this podcast to. To these meme coins. But there's this interesting point that Luke Martin posted about state lotteries, which is lottery ticket sales are at a record high. So if you look at. If someone's listening to the podcast, not watching on YouTube, this chart is up and to the right.
00:07:57.678 - 00:08:13.348, Speaker A: Up. Only it just passed 100 billion in state lottery tickets in 2023. You compare that to 2010. We were around. It looks like we're around, like, 55 billion now. It looks like we're about. What is this chart? 105 billion.
00:08:13.348 - 00:08:24.064, Speaker A: So that's, you know, we've doubled state lottery tickets. And this is just. I mean, you see it on the subway. I was on the New York subway today, and there. There's just advertisements everywhere to go buy lottery tickets.
00:08:25.524 - 00:08:30.904, Speaker B: Yeah. Like, lottery tickets. Like, probabilistically, the odds of you winning there are extremely low.
00:08:31.404 - 00:08:31.828, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:08:31.876 - 00:08:40.948, Speaker B: Because he knows, too. The house always has a marginal edge. So if you continue to play in an infinite sequence, you will lose all of your money.
00:08:41.116 - 00:08:47.144, Speaker A: Oh, you haven't been in a crapshoot with me. I got the edge. I got the edge at the craft stable.
00:08:48.764 - 00:08:50.980, Speaker B: You bet on red. Just. Just drop it.
00:08:51.092 - 00:08:52.700, Speaker A: No, that's roulette. That's roulette.
00:08:52.732 - 00:09:02.514, Speaker B: Roulette. Yeah. Listen, this all tells you how much I spend on a casino. I live in a casino. 24 7365. So I don't need to go to Vegas. The will.
00:09:02.514 - 00:09:44.724, Speaker B: The thing I'll say about meme coins that in this discussion, I think it's a healthy discussion to have amongst just the community, and it also tells you a lot about the type of person. Right. But one thing that I will say in this discussion around airdrops and projects trading at fully diluted meme coins are kind of more simplistic versions of, like, you know, projects. I'm not saying that they have a roadmap. They have utility. No, it just means. Right, but you don't have this, like, very low, extremely low flow, high FTV dynamic, which has historically been quite hurtful or not hurtful, but it's just.
00:09:44.724 - 00:09:48.536, Speaker B: It's just. It's just a thing. Right.
00:09:48.680 - 00:09:53.790, Speaker A: Can you. I hear a lot of people say that. Can you. For people who maybe don't know that, can you explain why that's harmful?
00:09:53.952 - 00:10:04.778, Speaker B: Not. Not all meme coins are created equal, for the most part. You look at, like, with you look at some other meme coins, the entire supply has been distributed. It's trading constantly.
00:10:04.946 - 00:10:10.474, Speaker A: The inverse, though, what's the. It's a commonly used phrase. All right, the market cap is this.
00:10:10.514 - 00:10:10.738, Speaker B: Or.
00:10:10.786 - 00:10:17.334, Speaker A: But the. You know, the FTV is this. That's a harmful dynamic that has played out. Why is that harmful or problematic?
00:10:17.954 - 00:10:22.460, Speaker B: I'll take. I'll retract the harmful part, because, again, it's difficult.
00:10:22.492 - 00:10:23.824, Speaker A: But markets are markets.
00:10:24.124 - 00:10:41.224, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. The. The tricky part is when you, a project, take Athena, because we're talking about. Or wormhole, they have a billion tokens. Totally. Like, total tokens is gonna be a billion. They don't issue that all at once.
00:10:41.224 - 00:11:00.992, Speaker B: Most projects don't do that. They haven't. Why? Because they have an emission schedule. They have certain tokenomics that, you know, like bitcoin. You're emitting these tokens based on whatever liquidity, mining incentives, certain other metrics. Token is the. The way you acquire customers, the way you attract attention.
00:11:00.992 - 00:11:38.352, Speaker B: You do that over time, right. For Athena, it's you. You want to incentivize people to deposit and earn a yield. The way they're capturing that yield, in part, is by these rewards that are emitted in the native token. Right? And so they're not going to issue that all at once. You have this dynamic where the project might be, at best, airdrops, like 5% initially, maybe 10%, maybe 20%, but as a percentage of the total token supply, it's quite low. And so when you think about price discovery, it's going to take a lot of time for the market to really come to terms.
00:11:38.352 - 00:12:07.956, Speaker B: And usually, for instance, arbitrum. Arbitrum just had their first big unlock for investors last month. So there was some selling. It was trading at two, dipped all the way to $1.64, trading at $1.45. Ahead of that, you saw some activity, and even with the price decline, you know, there's a lot of noise there because the markets have been choppy, whatever. But on a market cap basis, circulating market cap, arbitrum actually, even with a price decline, it's actually trading at all time.
00:12:07.956 - 00:12:38.550, Speaker B: High mark account. Why is. Because there's just more tokens out in circulation. General rule of thumb, more tokens in circulation, better price discovery, low tokens, small percentage of tokens in circulation. Tricky price discovery for the most part. Unless, of course, you can point to a vote. If there's a healthy secondary market like second lane or some of these brokers, right, that they're facilitating transactions, then you may have a better approximation of how these things are trading.
00:12:38.550 - 00:13:02.070, Speaker B: But it's tricky. I think I'd much rather prefer seeing a project where you have much more percentage of the total token supply out in the wild trading hands actively, or you just have a better sense of the true value, that market cap of that project.
00:13:02.262 - 00:13:26.958, Speaker A: Right. Yeah, I agree with that. So, yeah, so we had three topics on the dock for today, there's these like, l two s, l l three s. Then there's meme, like just meme coin stuff that we just talked about. And then there's airdrops. And I think if you try to, basically the through line of all of these things is you're, it's a fight for attention. There is just a violent fight for attention right now.
00:13:26.958 - 00:13:40.144, Speaker A: If you're a builder and the, like, what, what are airdrops? If you, if you look at, like, where, what airdrops are on your, uh, I like as a line item, basically on your p and l, it's a marketing market expense.
00:13:40.184 - 00:13:40.720, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:13:40.872 - 00:13:42.432, Speaker A: If you look at meme coins, I.
00:13:42.448 - 00:13:46.192, Speaker B: Saw DJ stock based compensation to employees.
00:13:46.328 - 00:14:15.138, Speaker A: Sure. It's a way to get, it's, it's a marketing, it's a marketing expense and a way to get, uh, or whatever you want to call it, but it's a way to get attention. Meme coins, what are they? If you're a project, like I saw Degens now launching an l three or something or another, like, I think actually you're going to see it. Or I think you could say backpack and mad lads, like, they launched is not meme coin, but an NFT. Nft. And then they started building things on top of it. It's just a way to get attention.
00:14:15.138 - 00:14:37.394, Speaker A: L three s and l two s. Like, why does a. I actually want to have this bigger conversation about l three s and l two s. But like, at this point, a lot of the technology is commoditized. Why does someone choose to build on blast versus base versus binance, smart chain versus arbitrum versus Solana? All the tech's going to get commoditized. It's user acquisition. It's user acquisition intention.
00:14:37.394 - 00:15:03.166, Speaker A: And that's the game that everyone's fighting right now. So maybe we can talk about, you know, talk about l three s. You sent me this message this week and you said, um, I don't have much of an opinion on l three s other than they are just not good. So maybe I'd ask you to. That's a obviously a pithy telegram message, but I'd love for you to just, like, hear your take on l three s, folks.
00:15:03.190 - 00:15:08.446, Speaker B: If you're gonna dm Jano, just remember he worked for a media company and he's gonna always air the wandering.
00:15:08.470 - 00:15:19.066, Speaker A: You didn't say, you didn't say off the record. You didn't say off the record. Let me record. I'll tee up the conversation on l three s. Actually, first, maybe, which is that.
00:15:19.250 - 00:15:21.922, Speaker B: So there's a.
00:15:22.098 - 00:15:46.466, Speaker A: So there's the l one, which is ethereum, obviously. Then all these l two s. Launch, optimism, arbitrum, starcore, things like that. There was a post in September of 2022 by Vitalik. He said, what kind of layer threes make sense? And I think this kind of woke a lot of people up to this idea that, hey, look, eventually there's going to be l three s and maybe l four s. And there's actually this. Maybe I'll pull up this diagram from this piece here.
00:15:46.466 - 00:16:00.842, Speaker A: Let's see if I can. So for anyone who's watching on YouTube can see this. So you've got the l one. You've got ethereum right here. Then you've got Starknet. Then the l three might be starkx, which is roll up or Starcks, the validiums app specific. Starknet.
00:16:00.842 - 00:16:17.796, Speaker A: Starknet, a different one. Privacy. Starknet. And then you've got the l four s. Read this post back from the end of 2022 that Vitalik made. He said, the conclusion here is that l three s are good for three things. L two is for scaling.
00:16:17.796 - 00:16:36.716, Speaker A: L three is for customized functionability, excuse me, functionality. For example, privacy. That's one thing. L two is for general purpose scaling. L three is for customized scaling. And then the third bucket was l two is for trustless scaling, like roll ups. L three is for weakly trusted scaling validiums.
00:16:36.716 - 00:16:56.796, Speaker A: And now we're a year and a half later, and you're starting to finally see these l three s come to the market, right? Folks are building l three s. I think degen launched an l three, which originally started as a meme coin, launched an l three on base. You're seeing arbitrum stylists, you're seeing optimism. You're seeing people build these l three s. I'd be curious to get your.
00:16:56.820 - 00:16:59.788, Speaker B: Take on, like, yeah, just what you.
00:16:59.796 - 00:17:01.504, Speaker A: Think of these l three s in general.
00:17:03.104 - 00:17:21.884, Speaker B: Again, I don't. I'm not sophisticated on this topic. I haven't followed it, other than it just gives me a mental. I'm sure it's one of those topics that I have, like, tabs open that I want to. I don't want to dive into, because it's just. I'm not very incentivized. It's just like, it feels painful.
00:17:21.884 - 00:17:58.454, Speaker B: I'll pump it over to you, because I think you may have a more informed opinion here. Like, for instance, arbitrage stylus. Why? What you're saying, and correct me if I'm wrong here, is, you know, if people want to use generalized arbitrage and layer on a lit, layer on something more specific, as Vitalik is saying, you like, why can't you do that as a l two? The same way that base is using the op stack as an l two. Why do you need to, like, what's the rationale for an l three? Or is like. It's sort of unclear to me.
00:17:59.994 - 00:18:44.872, Speaker A: Here's my thesis on what's happening is everyone's basically saying, I want the security from ethereum, so I'm going to use the l one for security, I'm going to use the l two for scalability, and then I'm going to use the l three for control. And I think that's kind of the narrative and that's what's playing out. If you talk to some folks who are doing this, I think really what you're going to see is you're going to see a lot of experimentation at the l three level, uh, or l three layer, and then you're going to see a lot of like. Again, I really think this l two tech will ultimately be commoditized. I don't know if Arbitrum's winning or optimism is winning or Polygon's winning or scroll. Like, it's all going to be commoditized in my mind. And the only two reasons that, like, someone will pick something is the brand and the user acquisition that comes from.
00:18:44.872 - 00:18:49.428, Speaker A: From building on it. So maybe blast is for more detail. Yeah, go ahead.
00:18:49.556 - 00:19:16.504, Speaker B: Blast is an l two base, as we think of it today, is described as an l two. You can bridge directly from an l one to base. Maybe that's like the simple definition of an l two bridging from an l one to an l two. So base is. But base is a fork, or using the op stack. Optimism is also an l two base. Optimism.
00:19:16.504 - 00:20:02.180, Speaker B: There's some deal there where optimism believe, like, granted a lot of the tokens to Coinbase, who then decided in their RFP assessing which l two tech to use, or whether arbitrum or optimism stack, they decided to use optimism. And there's. It was heavily incentivized, it's my understanding they're an l two, though. Base is an l two. Could base be like, in that decision tree of Coinbase, thinking that they're going to build something in Ethereum, say that there's the next coinbase, another exchange. They want to go through the same decision making process as Coinbase did. Are they going to build an l two or an l three? Like, why would you build an l three.
00:20:02.180 - 00:20:31.004, Speaker B: Or you can build an l two using the stack of arbitrary. More optimism. Like that's where I am. Like, why are you stacking and have more dependencies than l two, where you can just have the direct line of into an l one? It just seems like there's going to be more friction introduced if you have to make. Unless, again, this is where I'm dumb on this, and I'm not familiar if you can hop directly from an l one to an l three. Okay, maybe, but it just feels unnecessary.
00:20:31.884 - 00:20:59.248, Speaker A: Yeah, you got two dumb l three guys here. So we're, let's pontificate. Let's pontificate for a second. Just knowing that neither of us are deep in this right now. I think the word, the key word here is bridge. I think when I think about like an l, if I'm an l two, here's my vision. I'm trying to get as many folks to basically, to basically build these l three s on top of me.
00:20:59.248 - 00:21:32.824, Speaker A: And I think an l three, in a sense, is like, it is cheaper than running, cheaper and maybe more secure than running all of these bridges, right? So it's maybe better to then deploy like, the l two essentially just becomes a bridge like an l. I think the l two in this sense, like, let's use arbitram, let's use actual things. Let's say there's a theorem for security. Then all these l three s want to, then all these, like, apps, all these applications want to get built. And then if you believe in the app chain thesis, you say, okay, well, then all these apps are going to build their own chains.
00:21:33.444 - 00:22:13.616, Speaker B: Yeah, man, but like, I get it. But like, if you're like, step in, for instance, or a game, fork the op stack and build your l two. Heck, why even stop there? Build your own l one. That's gonna happen, too. So it just feels like if you go back to the, when ethereum got started, there was the ethereum killers. The incentive for developers to build their own chain was superior to build on ethereum because they can launch their own l one, they can have more autonomy, and they could capture way more value. Look at all the professor coins, thunder chain and avalanche.
00:22:13.616 - 00:23:13.804, Speaker B: And the incentive for a developer was very strong to build on zero one, if we believe that to be true even in today's environment. Again, the question is, and I'm not sophisticated, I'm just posing the question, why would a project that is worth their salt, that has a good product, project product that has, that is capturing attention, why would they build an l three. Why not build an l two directly? It seems like an l three, just introducing more lock in dependency to one particular l two. When the current state of l two to l two s and l two s to l one s is very fragmented, we're not there yet, we're bridging easily, is my challenge. The cost point of an l three, I think, is a mute one, because you can use modularity again to to use Celestia or like so like, it's not. I don't buy this argument that an l three is cheaper. I also don't buy the argument that an l three, like why would you lock yourself into a particular ecosystem, like optimism or arbitrary? Okay, maybe you believe that bridges across l two s is going to be great.
00:23:13.804 - 00:24:15.838, Speaker B: It just, this is, goes back to the heart of you want to ask me why I lost conviction, lost interest in Ethereum, even though, mind you, I've invested in a lot of l two s? Because I want, I have a very strong incentive for Ethereum scalability to roam out of work. I just don't think it's as elegant from a what matters most here is from a user's perspective, I don't think it's as elegant, as clean as integrated chain like Solana or Aptos or some of the other ones, just not. Maybe the other part of my brain says you're being too critical. Over time, the tech will be commoditized and abstracted away, where it's just going to be very easy to work your way around these chains. So this argument doesn't kind of really matter. If the tech is really good, you can hop around and someone's going to figure that out for you. But we're in a state where we have to think about this.
00:24:15.838 - 00:24:38.214, Speaker B: So I'll go back to my main question that I hope someone can answer out there. If you're a listener, please jump in into the discussion. If you're a really good builder, a project, an application, why would you build your l three and be sub and have to me sounds like more dependencies and lock in, whereas you can build your own l two like base did using the op stack, or heck, even build your own l one?
00:24:39.954 - 00:24:57.306, Speaker A: Here's the thesis, which is that if you go fork the op stack, you're then trying to create your own ecosystem of liquidity over here. But if you just go build on arbitrum, or you go build on top of optimum, let's say become an l three on top of optimism, you now have like interconnectedness of liquidity with everything else on optimism.
00:24:57.410 - 00:25:00.554, Speaker B: But if you force it, I think so.
00:25:00.974 - 00:25:01.406, Speaker A: Right.
00:25:01.470 - 00:25:05.606, Speaker B: What is the distinction between the interconnectedness horizontally versus vertically?
00:25:05.750 - 00:25:07.006, Speaker A: I really don't.
00:25:07.070 - 00:25:08.566, Speaker B: Vertical versus. Not horizontally.
00:25:08.630 - 00:25:31.610, Speaker A: Like, I mean, if you, for, like, let's say you fork. Let's say you build on the what's op super chain or whatever it's called, like, and you go build your own l two, you now are not. I'm. Again, I really don't know. Um, but I think you're not connected to, like, the. You're kind of fragmenting the liquidity there. Whereas if you build an l three on top of optimism, maybe it's that you get the.
00:25:31.610 - 00:26:19.656, Speaker A: You get interconnectedness with everyone building on options. I'm out of my depths. Here's a, here's a. Here's a cynical take on this, is that l three s are only exist because l two s don't know what their business model is. And l two s need basically, l three s are marketing thing created by the l two s because they didn't have a good business model and they needed more value accrual to the l two. If you look at why l three s maybe exist, maybe it's a marketing thing that the l two s have pushed onto crypto, Twitter, and the industry to drive more value landing on the l two instead of on the l one. And that is a really app instead.
00:26:19.680 - 00:26:39.000, Speaker B: Of the l two. Like, if you're. What you're saying is, like, if you're a good app, mind you, base, there's a lot of apps on arbitram, defi, ecosystems and all of them, it's like a perp protocol, going to build their own l three. I just like it.
00:26:39.112 - 00:26:47.028, Speaker A: What is the impact? Okay, let's say all these l three s. I can't wait for just us to get shredded on Twitter and YouTube from this conversation.
00:26:47.196 - 00:26:48.484, Speaker B: I'd love to be shredded because.
00:26:48.564 - 00:27:20.482, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm just clearly posing questions. Yeah, yeah. Let me, again, I'm just going to try to play the cynical person here. If all, let's say, fast forward, let's say all these l three s actually take off more and more and more and more of the fees on ethereum. Well, I'm trying to think this out. Ethereum is going to start earning less and less and less fees. And if it's earning less and less and less fees, and the fees are kind of like land, I'm going to make up this word like landing on the l two instead of landing back at the l one.
00:27:20.482 - 00:27:48.534, Speaker A: Perhaps the value of ETH drops and then it kind of, it kind of creates this really negative feedback loop where like maybe people start to get spooked, the validators no longer are willing to hold ETH and they're no longer willing to secure the network, and you lose this idea of like, oh, maybe the ethereum security is not the and all be all. So I think while these l three s are maybe a good idea for the l two s, in the short run, long term, I think it's easy to be cynical on it.
00:27:49.354 - 00:28:22.074, Speaker B: I think it's an excellent point. At what point? I think that time, time again, we hear this, like, users and liquidity is where is on ethereum? Evm, I get it today is true. You're not building for the state of the world today. You're building for state of the future. If you're a really good product, which we haven't really seen, you're gonna attract a lot of users and liquidity directly to your app. You control that, you control that user. Why not go build your own l one? We're like talking about like micro usage right now.
00:28:22.074 - 00:29:19.746, Speaker B: In the grand scheme of things. The only reason we're all here is because we believe that this actually becomes like an incredible extension of the Internet. We haven't really seen that yet, but somehow we're like caught in these debates of scalability and saying that Ethereum's like the winner or like the dominant chain. Certainly it's starting to be like contested very easily in terms of usage, in terms of fees. Solana, for instance, has had multiple days now where the fees there has been higher than Ethereum. So your question is a really good one, which is where does if an l three, an l four, an l five and l 27, whatever, at what point does, if the value capture sits on the l two or higher up the stack, at what point does it? Is it just economically and more importantly, like the security starts to kind of fall apart. You'd rather build your own l one because you become like the values there.
00:29:19.746 - 00:30:09.196, Speaker B: So you just, you just drop into an l one, right? My simple thesis for something like Solana is that like, and mart credit to Merc, because he actually was the first one to come up with this, he said, look, the scalability trilemma, which we've always go back to, it says, you know, security decentralization, what is it? Security centralization and scalability, I believe one of those things. I think it's those three. And you can like, you know, do some trade offs around the continuum, but it's like I simplistically today, the way I think about it, is the most secure chain will be the one that has the most killer products because that attracts, that creates more fees. Assuming that the fee captures worked out. Not every chain is figured out, by the way. No chain is perfect in terms of fee markets. They're all kind of trying to, like, optimize it.
00:30:09.196 - 00:30:41.034, Speaker B: Ethereum has done it with the FP 1559, which I think is really novel. I think Solana will have to do that. It's figuring that out. Other chains will probably have to do that as well. But, like, if you. It's not a bad problem to have, like, if you have a lot of demand and usage, then that creates a robust fee market, right? That creates more security because validators, you incentivize validators naturally, to come to your chain, earn fees, and then that. But it starts, begins, and ends with, you have to have killer applications, you have to have performance.
00:30:41.034 - 00:31:23.620, Speaker B: And that means user experience today is far superior. In Solana, I think base is not bad. Like, these l two s are not bad. I don't want to come across as negatively critical of l two s, but I just think that the integrated design today is more elegant and more clean for the user, as opposed to having a bridge across. Cosmos has this problem, too, not just ethereum. And so I just think users naturally always gravitate to where the easiest. You don't have to think about this stuff, right? Maybe in six, you know, six months or a year, like this connectivity across l two s, l three s, l 27s, like, is, like, totally abstracted away.
00:31:23.620 - 00:31:37.820, Speaker B: It's super clean. Then that. I will revisit my thesis. But let me ask you a question. Would you agree or disagree that it's just a cleaner experience in Solana? You don't like, you don't have to think about bridging across base and arbitrum.
00:31:37.852 - 00:31:49.292, Speaker A: And I think so right now. But, like, Solana is one cycle behind ETH, and ultimately there's going to have to be Solana, l two s. Like, if you talk to a lot of the future, you don't think.
00:31:49.308 - 00:32:07.452, Speaker B: So we had this discussion in London. I think the drip, was it vivo or whatever? Vivo, yeah, Vivo and the tensor. Like, I think there's been discussion around it. I tweeted about it. I think that thread has really good, healthy debate. So we should link.
00:32:07.548 - 00:32:08.300, Speaker A: I didn't see that.
00:32:08.372 - 00:32:38.078, Speaker B: Right. Yeah, I tweeted about it right after Das. I don't think it solves ultimately much. Maybe for drip, but I came away after reading all the comments Austin princess commented in there. I thought that was one of the best responses there. So if we can pull it up or just link to it. But I agree with his take, which is they're not solving the current issue and bottleneck constraints that Solana has right now.
00:32:38.078 - 00:33:13.914, Speaker B: When I say bottling, sort of like the fees. So anyways, the value to char and multicolored guys, like, again come out. And I actually do agree with their take, and they've been saying it for years. You value an l one based on the mev capture. Mev capture in Toronto is going to continue to be actually more and more interesting and robust. You're already seeing that with Jito. And so in Ethereum, where's the mev going to be captured? Like sequencers, centralized sequencer, actually capturing a lot.
00:33:13.914 - 00:33:22.022, Speaker B: So yeah, I think the, you value.
00:33:22.078 - 00:33:48.764, Speaker A: An elf based on that, based on all the mev capture. I think that's trying to, I disagree with that. I think that's trying to put some like trad five framework, basically of like valuation on top of an l one. Like how do ETH. ETH or soul or whatever, like they're, they're valued the same way that you value, like grain or gold or oil. They're just commodities. They're just commodities.
00:33:48.764 - 00:34:15.856, Speaker A: Like soul is just a commodity. So any, any, like ETH is in, at least in my mind, is just a commodity. So any, like, if you look at how people, you know, people don't talk about, you know, soybeans or whatever, like, they're not, or oil, they're not like, oh, look at the p and l of oil today. They're like, oh, there's a supply shock happening to oil today. OPEC cut this thing. Or there's something happening, like oil markets.
00:34:15.880 - 00:34:43.021, Speaker B: For instance, there is nuance where the value capture happens. EMP, like, like expiration has been really challenged. Most, like a lot of people go bankrupt there because you have to be really. But like the refinery process, the refinement of crude into like higher. Like, you know, that's where most of the value is captured. So you think holistically of the oil markets, not just oil itself, is what I'm saying. Like the whole ecosystem, like the whole energy, like oil and gas industry.
00:34:43.021 - 00:35:09.129, Speaker B: And think about like, where's value being created, like, where's the highest margin stuff anyways? It's like a loose analogy. I don't want to go into it. Um, but, yeah, yeah, I don't know. I, I'll just go back to, I would love to better understand. And hopefully someone can jump in here and. And just make the case of the. The need for an l three in the context of base use.
00:35:09.129 - 00:35:17.373, Speaker B: The op stack built their own l two. And can someone also just tell me why base at some point won't even launch their own l one?
00:35:18.584 - 00:35:36.336, Speaker A: Yeah, we have. I want to get Steven from Arbitrum's take on this. They have arbitrum. I think it's Stylus, and I think. I think. And the reason I want to pick on him is I think they have the most. The most capital deployed on Arbitrum right now.
00:35:36.336 - 00:36:35.430, Speaker A: I'm pretty sure in the most number of apps that have built on Arbitrum. I'm pretty sure about that in terms of all the folks who have their kind of go launch an l three platforms own. So let me. So maybe we can do like Stephen and someone else as well. Everyone wanted to give a big shout out to today's sponsor, wormhole foundation, stewards of the wormhole protocol. If you are like Santi and I, and you play around on chain, you know how bad the cross chain experience is today? Well, wormhole has set out to solve that, powering cross chain transfers for over 200 different multi chain teams, including some of the best, like Uniswap and circle. So what does that mean for you, the empire listener? This opens up a huge number of multi chain use cases across Defi, NFts, governance, oracles, and more, by supporting over 30 different blockchains and six different runtimes, including Sui Solana, different Ethel two s theorem, and a whole bunch more.
00:36:35.430 - 00:37:02.528, Speaker A: That means you have now the most powerful interoperability platform at your fingertips. If you're a developer, you'll be excited to hear that wormhole provides an extensive suite of tools and infrastructure so that you can securely build multi chain applications. But don't just take our word for it. Obviously, wormhole protocol leads the industry in all time. Messages transferred with over 900 million cross chain messages. 900 million. That is close to a billion.
00:37:02.528 - 00:37:25.112, Speaker A: And that's a big number of messages. As a thank you, wormhole foundation is dropping exclusive nfts. That's right, we got some exclusive nfts for empire listeners. Hit the link in the description to claim your unique wormhole NFT today. This episode is brought to you by Monad. Monad's thesis is simple. The EVM is here to stay similar to JavaScript and web two.
00:37:25.112 - 00:38:00.042, Speaker A: But unfortunately, today's EVM lacks the high performance and the scalability that developers need to make certain applications possible. Monad addresses these concerns in these bottlenecks while preserving seamless EVM composability. For application developers. There's a seamless transition to Monad as the Ethereum RPC API allows for really easy portability. And for developers, Monad can support 10,000 real transactions per second with their unique parallel execution environment. And of course there's full compatibility with EVM bytecode. Monad's internal devnet is live public.
00:38:00.042 - 00:38:15.134, Speaker A: Testnet comes out soon. You can join Monad's journey in two ways. One, go follow them. They're on Twitter on a d xyz, and also join the Monad discord. It's discord. Gg Monad. Big thanks to Monad for sponsoring empire.
00:38:15.134 - 00:38:54.012, Speaker A: The last thing I'd say on this topic is like, I noticed that there was a lot of hate around blast. There's the munchables hack and I think 62 or $63 million hack. And people were like, do you let the hack happen or do you roll back the chain? And then people were commenting saying, look, if blast rolls back the chain, you'll see how centralized it really is. So they can't do that. And I would just remind people, the difference between blast and base and binance smart chain is slim to nothing. Uh, it is, it is brand. It is brand.
00:38:54.012 - 00:39:11.182, Speaker A: And, uh, you don't have to take my, it's not my take for that. I think that folks at l two beat do a really good job of that. There's, um, friend again for anyone watching on YouTube. You can, you can see it right here. But like, you look at base that. So l two beat has these different stages, um, and then different risks. Right? So this is base.
00:39:11.182 - 00:39:30.314, Speaker A: They've got three out of five or red, two out of five or green. Same with blast. Stage zero items missing for stage one, they've got three X's proof system still under development. No user withdrawals can be censored by the permissioned operators. No. Or yes. Upgrades executed by actors, et cetera, et cetera.
00:39:30.314 - 00:39:54.590, Speaker A: Yes. So exact same thing. There's no difference between these two. Yeah, I just remind op as well. So as, actually, as l two beat lays it out, the only folks who have moved into stage one, it's arbitrum, Duidx and Zksync here. So everyone else, distinction.
00:39:54.622 - 00:39:56.034, Speaker B: There are fraud proofs.
00:40:00.814 - 00:40:01.594, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:40:03.034 - 00:40:50.974, Speaker B: Anyways, I think, yeah, I look at some point, blast has been, Anatoly had a good tweet this week about the criticisms of Solana being higher hardware requirements, more centralized, and the fact that they've always been very explicit about that and upfront, whereas his criticism was exactly this with Ethereum. They haven't been upfront about this, about the l two s and how, you know, they don't have fraud proofs. If an l two doesn't have fraud proof, it is. You're at risk, you're beholden to them. They have fraud proofs but they have a centralized sequencer. The sequencer is largely relevant for security. It just more value capture to a particular party.
00:40:50.974 - 00:41:09.274, Speaker B: It's a centralized, but ultimately you can always revert back to the l one. You don't risk that. You don't have a fraud proof. You. Yeah, it's no different than a multisig in terms of the actual impact implication for the user. And look, I get it. Blast is in development, they're moving a pretty fast pace.
00:41:09.274 - 00:41:36.670, Speaker B: And yeah, in the roadmap you have to build frog proofs. Optimism has been around for what, the longest, where the frog proofs. I will, I will constantly, like, I, you know, I won't get tired of saying it. Someone said that like, they built it. They've been like in development or some early form. I'm like, it's been a couple years. I know it's difficult, but it's been a couple years.
00:41:36.670 - 00:41:43.510, Speaker B: Like, like, yeah, it's concerning, right?
00:41:43.582 - 00:41:44.234, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:41:44.814 - 00:42:08.714, Speaker B: I mean, not to just throw shade on one particular, it's just as a matter of principle, like, just fraud proofs are essential, otherwise it's a multisig. Like if you're upfront about being a multi second people, and at least like it's better to be very upfront. I'm, let me ask you a question. If you were to survey all the users that are deployed into optimism, would you, would you think that they, like, if you ask them about proper, do you think that they would understand that? Do you think they don't understand that? It's.
00:42:10.134 - 00:42:12.914, Speaker A: I don't, I don't think they care. I don't.
00:42:14.174 - 00:42:47.584, Speaker B: But if you compare the percentage, if you ask the same question, like what percentage of people that are deploying in a blast would appreciate that it's a multi sig, probably higher. Yeah, look, there's a lot of criticism in the launch. If they rephrase it, they came out of it. Look, it's not perfect, but you want to see that was, I'm not like just depending my, my bags. You talked about how blast was being like, you know, blasted and put on like the, know, pitchforks and whatever, but like, you know, they've been upfront about the fact that it's a multi sig.
00:42:49.204 - 00:42:50.124, Speaker A: So you where.
00:42:50.164 - 00:43:02.304, Speaker B: Yes, like, I get it. At some point. At some point, if they're, if they, if blast has a chance to be successful, fraud proofs are essential. Essential.
00:43:03.764 - 00:43:17.076, Speaker A: Yeah. Agreed. I mean, look, there's, it's, it's what I'm. We're, we're agreeing. Right. I'm just like the decentralization narrative that most, you know, most of the l two s promote is. I mean, it's a, at this point in time, it's not true.
00:43:17.076 - 00:43:23.508, Speaker A: Right. A lot of them are just highly centralized and, you know, some of the biggest ones haven't implemented fraud proofs and. Yeah, we're agreeing.
00:43:23.676 - 00:43:30.284, Speaker B: And look, I don't want to be cynical. I'm just being, I'm just laying out, I understand that there's development to, I.
00:43:30.284 - 00:43:36.020, Speaker A: Think fraud proofs did things or to defend them. I think they did implement fraud proofs on testnet recently.
00:43:36.212 - 00:44:00.124, Speaker B: I believe so, yes, that's correct. That's what I verified this. So I've been told this by multiple people, and especially at that. So I may be speaking out of turn now, but I just generally think that I appreciate these things are hard to build. They take time. And I know there's a team and there's teams that are devoted to figuring this stuff out. I don't want to imply that there's not.
00:44:00.124 - 00:44:36.526, Speaker B: It's just. But the reality is just, let's just call a spade a spade. That's my, that's the point that I'm making, that people have a way to focus too much on criticizing other projects, whether it's meme coins, whether it's an ETH killer, whether it's whatever. Like, focus as a matter of principle, focus less on criticizing others and just internalize through introspection and figure out what you need to work on yourself. That applies to l two s and everything else in life. Like, you know, like, just don't throw stones if you have sinned. It's like that story, whatever.
00:44:36.526 - 00:44:39.874, Speaker B: The Bible. Not religious at all, but, you know. You know what I mean? Like.
00:44:42.254 - 00:44:43.302, Speaker A: Yeah, let's pivot.
00:44:43.398 - 00:44:45.262, Speaker B: We need, let's echo for sure.
00:44:45.398 - 00:44:55.954, Speaker A: Echo dot XYZ, Kobe's project. Yeah, you guys had a nice little thing. What's your, what's your company project? What are we calling it? Bid club.
00:44:57.694 - 00:44:58.954, Speaker B: I'm also an echo.
00:45:00.254 - 00:45:19.958, Speaker A: All right. Are they, are they similar? Different, so, all right, so they're different. So bid club. Okay, so I'll do your show for you, which is something on Twitter today. It said announcing Bid club's founding members. Bid Club is a membership based investment idea sharing platform for longer form. Theses around publicly listed cryptocurrencies.
00:45:20.046 - 00:45:20.258, Speaker B: Now.
00:45:20.286 - 00:45:48.274, Speaker A: Now enclosed beta. Looking for our next cohort of members. Bid club's founding members. Arthur from Defiance, Jason Choi, Avi Feldman, James and Vincent from modular cap. Great guys. Jason, Cam, Andrew, Kang, Kyle, Samani, Sante, Daryl, Xerox, Wangarian, and the last guy who I don't know, Tanthai. So those are, so that's, so that's bid club.
00:45:48.274 - 00:46:16.024, Speaker A: Then Kobe also announced something fairly recently, which is Echo XYZ. I think the best way to describe it is maybe like crypto, a crypto only, like angel investment platform, or maybe like a crypto, crypto only angel list maybe is the right way to describe it. But what are your, what are your thoughts? A, I'd love to hear the thesis for bid club, and then b, I'd love to hear like just your thoughts on Echo.
00:46:16.804 - 00:47:00.594, Speaker B: So I'm involved in both, full disclosure, I think both serve a clear purpose and they're quite different. Your framework is, I think, correct. Echo is early stage, like an angelist investing startups. There are clubs or I guess groups and certain personalities and have a group. I sort of missed that line because I was too kind of laser tied up to connect my tour. Again, all this stuff. But anyways, there's some good syndicates that you can apply to and join Larry from the blog, you have Ansem, you have Casey, you have multiple people, will price, just a bunch of people that I guess are known are good, have a good reputation being early stage investors that have had these groups and syndicates.
00:47:00.594 - 00:47:31.476, Speaker B: So I think of it as angel. Listen, bit club is differentiates in two forms. One, it's more of a discussion debate platform, like idea sharing, not so much actionable. It's not like you're going to send money and fun directly on the platform. It's just meant to be a place where you can curate discussion. And there's analogies to, this is like public markets, right? Like, I forget the platform. Jason knows.
00:47:31.476 - 00:48:11.324, Speaker B: It's like stock tweets or whatever. Like there's platforms where people share, even conferences where people go to, and there's like catch one managers that talk about like pitch public ideas and then it's a healthy debate. So I think about like bit Club as a more of a debate club and skewing exclusively to liquid like projects that have launched. So a lot of what you'll see there now is, you know, there's a there's a post about the thesis for Waif. You know, there's a thesis for Solana, there's a thesis for you name it. But it's only liquid tokens, so they're quite different in that sense.
00:48:12.904 - 00:48:22.364, Speaker A: So on echo, do you, like. You can follow different. What's the problem that echo is trying to solve? It's that a lot of the angel deals right now are very private and.
00:48:23.394 - 00:48:26.334, Speaker B: Yeah, it's trying to democratize access to early stage investing.
00:48:29.034 - 00:48:33.094, Speaker A: Funny. In a way, icos, they really were the fairest option here.
00:48:34.714 - 00:49:03.406, Speaker B: Kind of. Yeah. Like, icos, with certain modifications, I think would be the purest expression of just opening up x is, I think you have, you know, tweaks and saying, like, in terms of just standardizing disclosures and, you know, but, yeah, I don't disagree with that at all. Actually, Kane and other people have been kind vocal about, like, revisiting the idea of an ICO.
00:49:03.590 - 00:49:08.194, Speaker A: Yeah. What's your vision for bid club? Like, how involved are you?
00:49:08.734 - 00:49:25.430, Speaker B: Sorry, just one. One point which ties into the discussion. We're talking about, like, fully loaded versus circulating. Like, icos had more of the tokens circulating out of the gate, better price discovery. Yeah. So anyways, yeah, you hear these criticisms time and time again. Like retail, quote, unquote, not.
00:49:25.430 - 00:50:12.924, Speaker B: Institutional investors can invest in these projects because they maybe not fall under the accreditation, or even if they're not in the accreditation, they're not, like, invited to invest in these rounds. And so, yeah, I think Kobe's sort of taken that stance and wants to take a crack at it, which is. Yeah. Why I'm excited about exploring that, the thesis for bit club. I'm excited because I've, for a while now, have found public markets more intellectually engaging and fun than early stage. Even though I still do a lot of early stage, I've most of now I'm thinking about my, like, public opportunities, like liquid tokens. And I just think that it's, uh.
00:50:12.924 - 00:50:57.568, Speaker B: I never thought I'd be like a quote unquote hedge fund guy. My background, my training has been in venture crypto is both, obviously, but I think a lot of opportunities are in the, in the public markets, like liquid tokens. I think it's an area that on a relative basis is probably underlooked by institutions. You know, there's some guys, like the module guys, reflexive multicoin. Does some of these, like, some funds, like, have the liquid strategy attached to them. But I think in the grand scheme of things, there's way too much emphasis from, from investors, institutional investors in the space, in early stage opportunities, not so much in public markets. And I think there's incredible amount of opportunities there that, you know, retail has access to.
00:50:57.568 - 00:51:40.978, Speaker B: So, you know, the nice thing, there's like that joke, right, that the, the VC lives the best life. He gets to invest and wait ten years to be proven correct or not in traditional venture crypto is earlier, right? Because you might have invested in wormhole or Athena six months ago. Now you have a token. So the market then and there, you know, I guess it's, it's much faster. But, you know, I think public markets are really cool and more intellectually stimulating, at least for me, because, you know, it's a bit more daunting, I guess. You invest in something, it goes down like 60%, 70% overnight. Like, when I first invested in Wif, I think, like, it went down like 60%.
00:51:40.978 - 00:52:20.744, Speaker B: Like, woke up and I was like, okay, yeah, this is definitely a volatile thing. I was on this podcast being, you know, when it first hit a dollar, when it first hit two, right? I was. You could see me worked up, like, what should I do, right? It's already up a lot. Like, how should I manage that? And instead of running away from that, historically, I had run away from that because I now pay more attention to that. And I think it's like, even this experiment with trading meme coins I funded, like, some random wallets, like, just as experiments. They're no longer small experiments. But that process, I think has allowed me to, like, just develop another muscle as an investor that I.
00:52:20.744 - 00:52:49.768, Speaker B: It's less developed in venture. And I quite like that. I've really enjoyed that experience, and I think it will help serve me well even for early stage investing, but also just to apply it. Like, I have now a more growing desire to spend more and more time in liquids because I'm now just really, really convinced it's very overlooked. That's where I want to spend most of my, like said differently, if I were to start a fund today, like raise money, I would spend more than 50% of my time on liquid.
00:52:49.936 - 00:52:50.512, Speaker A: But how much?
00:52:50.568 - 00:53:03.648, Speaker B: Because it's that way. It's way more scalable. Strategy, like, you could raise a billion dollars today and deploy in liquid paradigm is now trying to raise 850. How much of that's going to go into private? It's like, that's just not going to bode well for all.
00:53:03.696 - 00:53:10.576, Speaker A: How much of that is a factor of where we're at in the cycle, right? Like, the venture deals have gotten now pretty ridiculous.
00:53:10.720 - 00:53:31.344, Speaker B: True, true, true. Like, they will certainly be able to deploy at 50, maybe across two cycles, like multicoint today just announced, like, invested over $200 million in wormhole. Yeah, you do four of those deals. You wouldn't, right, from a concentration standpoint, but you're right. You're starting to see now more and more the 200. We're going to see a billion dollar raise. Right.
00:53:31.344 - 00:54:16.274, Speaker B: So I just think that historically, a lot of that capital has flown into privates that have a long duration. They carry a lot of risks, whether you want to think about them or not. Whereas public, I think, is way more scalable and more actionable. Like, you can deploy over multiple billions of dollars into something like Solana on a risk adjusted basis. Is it going to outperform most stuff? Probably none of this financial is like, as an example, hypothetical, or some of the large, like the top 50 tokens by market cap, like, they're over a billion dollars. Right. You can buy 5% of that token supply fairly easily and, and, you know, run a fairly concentrated book and all liquid.
00:54:16.274 - 00:54:47.560, Speaker B: You know, you don't have redemption necessarily, risk or as much. You can be more tactical. Yeah, maybe no one will give me money because they're like, no, most of your success has been in early stage, which is partially true, but yeah, no, I, I really, really think it's an area that is overlooked. So when I met the modular guys, when I met Jason, how involved I am at big club, I'm a. Jason came to me. I think it was the first or second person he came to. And then we selected some of the other members in there, but we were very thoughtful around.
00:54:47.560 - 00:55:26.756, Speaker B: The people that are in there are typically guys that, you know, are, have their own, or fund managers, and they, they are vocal and invest in liquid stuff. That was a criteria. There was a lot of other people that could have fit that bill, but they were just not active in the public markets. And so liquid markets, I'd say. And so they're just, they're just not meant for the platform. So what we envision doing this is like token 2049 in Dubai is a little too close, but like some, sometime, like maybe permissionless or maybe some of these conferences where you have a zone type, zone conference is really cool. Like, you have some of the best investors like stand or gamilla go and they pitch their ideas.
00:55:26.756 - 00:55:33.638, Speaker B: There's private dinners that hedge fund managers do and like, they kind of, they have to come with an idea and they can be picked apart.
00:55:33.686 - 00:55:34.134, Speaker A: Right.
00:55:34.254 - 00:55:57.484, Speaker B: So that's. I like debate. I like that type of debate. And so I envisioned bit club taking that type of form, like online platform for very high caliber discussion on ideas, more curated, more sophisticated than crypto, Twitter, and. And then a component of in person, which you guys are experts on. We've talked about this. Right.
00:55:57.484 - 00:56:23.592, Speaker B: You know, layering it as a side event in some of your conferences would be pretty cool. Have, you know, local clubs where people can go to and learn about this stuff. And, you know, debate. And a big part of this and where I've spent a lot of time with Jason is the disclosure component. Like, I'm always very uneasy. I think we don't get as many views as some other podcasts in crypto because we're not here telling you, we're not talking about prices as much. We've been spending 30 minutes on l three s.
00:56:23.592 - 00:56:33.464, Speaker B: I mean, people are already snoozing at that point. Right, right. They want an idea. They want. I need to buy. Am I gonna buy wormhole? Yes or no? Am I gonna buy, you know, Athena, yes or no? I want to. People want to be spoon fed.
00:56:33.464 - 00:57:03.204, Speaker B: I don't like to do that. You don't like to do that for obvious reasons. But I think there is a. There's a time and a place for that, and I'm hopeful that bit club is that nice. And I'm looking forward to it because I hope that I have, like, I hope that I can do that in a way that, you know, I'm probably still going to be cautious, but I hope that I can do that. And it encourages me to be structured and standardized. Like, if you're going to pitch an idea, it has to follow a certain format.
00:57:03.204 - 00:57:24.366, Speaker B: If you're ever selling, if you're ever doing stuff, like. And so I. It's just nice to have that type of template, right? Because it's written. I think these things, ideas should be structured as memos, the same way that you would do it at a fund. Well documented. People can read about it and comment and see all the disclaimers and disclosures, whereas in a podcast, you just. You're not.
00:57:24.366 - 00:57:27.794, Speaker B: You're going to miss some of that. Right. And it's better to be in written form.
00:57:29.014 - 00:57:29.794, Speaker A: Cool.
00:57:30.654 - 00:57:31.582, Speaker B: I like it.
00:57:31.718 - 00:57:34.194, Speaker A: Let's do it at permissionless. I think it's a good idea.
00:57:34.734 - 00:57:43.314, Speaker B: I think so. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like, the same way that we did that meetup, like, maybe just a meet up for bit club members that have been active in the platform. And. Well, I'm actually really.
00:57:44.574 - 00:58:01.778, Speaker A: We're doing zero x day, so, like, permissionless is three days but there's day zero, which is zero x day. It's basically for blockworks research subscribers. And we're going to bring a lot of the big allocators in the industry and maybe, maybe we can combine forces in that way. But that's cool.
00:58:01.826 - 00:58:05.818, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah. That's cool. Investing is a social sport.
00:58:05.986 - 00:58:32.692, Speaker A: Yeah. And even more so in crypto. So. All right, there's one last piece of news, actually non crypto, that I thought was cool this week, which was. So there's the biggest prediction market company, I think, out there, not polymarket, it's actually this thing called Kalchi. Like outside of, outside of like the kind of offshore costa Rica ones, but there's one called Kalchi. And they've tried to do everything right in the regulated way.
00:58:32.692 - 00:58:38.076, Speaker A: They've raised some venture money. They've waited to get the regulations. And actually that's in LA.
00:58:38.140 - 00:58:39.860, Speaker B: They raised from h 16 z, I think.
00:58:39.932 - 00:58:56.834, Speaker A: I think so. I think so. They had a really cool announcement today, which is that. Or so the problem with prediction markets is that there's no liquidity. Like there's no real players and there's no liquidity. And like they're just these like tiny, tiny, tiny markets. And liquidity begets liquidity, but same thing on the other side.
00:58:56.834 - 00:58:59.906, Speaker A: Right. So when you don't have liquidity, it gets stuff so terrible.
00:58:59.970 - 00:59:00.410, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:59:00.522 - 00:59:35.304, Speaker A: Yeah. So today actually, they announced that Susquehanna became the Susquehanna is one of the biggest market makers in the world. Susquehanna became the first institutional market maker to commit to actually making markets on calci. Theres this post from the founder, Tarek, which is look Sig Susquehanna, I think probably. Susquehanna Investment Group has trades 2 trillion in yearly volume. One of the largest market makers in the world. First time in history that big institutional Wall street market making firm is now committing to make markets on a prediction market platform.
00:59:35.304 - 00:59:55.592, Speaker A: Um, and actually the impact on this is on Calci. You used to only be able to trade a thousand shares at a time. You can now trade 100,000 shares at a time. And actually in say, uh, Susquehanna's announcement, they said, yeah, we're going to be making markets for everything from monetary policy swings to Taylor Swift's album performance, so.
00:59:55.688 - 00:59:56.584, Speaker B: Right. Absolutely.
00:59:56.704 - 01:00:04.924, Speaker A: I just, I think it's great. I think it's really, really cool. And I think what's happening is they realize the demand that's going to be there for the presidential election.
01:00:05.374 - 01:00:16.078, Speaker B: Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. I have two thoughts on this. One I was having. I was skiing with a group of older folks, all american last week and like, all Americans.
01:00:16.078 - 01:00:16.862, Speaker B: Nazi.
01:00:16.998 - 01:00:20.950, Speaker A: Like, they're like, oh, they're all american. I got it.
01:00:21.022 - 01:00:29.774, Speaker B: They're all american. Of course, we. Politics always comes up at the table. Here we go. I said, like, 20 minutes in, I was, like, savoring the comment. I'm like, guys, I just sent them a link. It's like, check out, check this out.
01:00:29.774 - 01:00:51.614, Speaker B: I sent Lincoln polymarket the politics page, and then they were like, incredible. They were, like, fascinated by it. They couldn't stop talking about the rest of the week. Like, oh, my God. And I'm like, it adds just a lot of really good signal and just data, right? It's like a $100 million market. Like, stop pontificating. No one cares what you think.
01:00:51.614 - 01:01:18.884, Speaker B: John or Joe the plumber. Look at the prediction market. Who's gonna be the nominee? Like, they were talking about, like, who's gonna be the nominee for Trump? I'm like, go look at the prediction market. It's not gonna be Nate Silver and it's not gonna be CNN and all the political pundits that have gotten it wrong time and time again. Last couple elections, it's just been harder because it's border apathy. The market, you know, the country's more, like, polarized now, right? People are, like, afraid to tell you they're Trump voter. They're secretly trump voters, whatever.
01:01:18.884 - 01:01:37.320, Speaker B: So anyways, prediction markets, I think, are probably gonna be one of those things that are like, I just find it fascinating. And they're gonna, they're probably gonna be the top three consumer app, like crypto. So it's really cool to see they. The other point I wanted to make around this was, yeah, this, this is just the page that I just sent people. And it's like, it's a huge hook.
01:01:37.392 - 01:01:41.208, Speaker A: There's a hundred million. A hundred million dollars on this. On polymarket.
01:01:41.296 - 01:01:46.724, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's the main market. Yeah, it's. I think it's the largest. Yeah. So it's not small.
01:01:47.024 - 01:01:47.616, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:01:47.720 - 01:01:56.732, Speaker B: Like, who are you gonna trust? CNN pollsters or the prediction market that has a million behind it? You know what I mean?
01:01:56.908 - 01:01:57.664, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:02:00.004 - 01:02:21.126, Speaker B: I think that there's, like an interesting. There's an interesting flavor. Now just. Of course, we gotta finish the podcast where we ended it with meme coins like Bowdoin and Trump. I think they're info discojo. I invested in a project just recently that is gonna launch that. It takes a combination of what you're seeing with these meme coins that are representing outcomes in a way signaling interest rate.
01:02:21.126 - 01:02:37.542, Speaker B: That there's a, there's a Trump meme coin. There's a bowdoin meme coin that has wild swings when they come out. Right. There's debates or whatever. Combine the two. Imagine. So the challenge of poly market and just prediction markets is you need a lot of the criteria, as you said.
01:02:37.542 - 01:03:08.682, Speaker B: But if you combine, like, the meme coin aspect of it, like what you're seeing with Trump and bowdoin into a prediction market, anyone can create it and we can launch a meme code of source. But, like, you attach more of the outcome component to it, I think you're gonna. The goal is to have not just one $100 million market. Like, why not create, attach onto memes have been incredibly good to scale and attract a lot of liquidity. Combine that in a more prediction market type of platform. So that was my idea that I had. I'm kind of incubating this thing, but not so much.
01:03:08.682 - 01:03:23.878, Speaker B: Like, not, not. I was involved in the kind of, the idea generation of some elements of it. They came to me and I said, amazing, super impressive. And then we kind of, like, worked it through. So I'm, I'm hopeful it will work because I just want to see more. More. That's cool.
01:03:23.878 - 01:03:24.766, Speaker B: Markets.
01:03:24.950 - 01:03:38.086, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, the counters that the only thing people like, betting markets and prediction markets, people talk about them. I lied. I would love for a prediction market to take off the counters that every four years, people talk about prediction markets, election years, and then they, and then it goes away.
01:03:38.150 - 01:03:45.112, Speaker B: Well, yeah, but like, people were also want to maybe do. But on the words, there's other stuff, right? Yeah.
01:03:45.128 - 01:03:50.044, Speaker A: I mean, the will Taylor Swift tickets sell for more than $10,000.
01:03:50.824 - 01:04:03.520, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Discrete things. I mean, that's option markets in a way, right? Yeah. And derivatives, there's the no show value that is like orders of magnitude more.
01:04:03.672 - 01:04:04.480, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:04:04.672 - 01:04:35.056, Speaker B: So, yeah, we'll see. It's interesting, though. Like the, suffice to say, I ended the discussion with these folks. I'm like, listen, guys, I probably will be. You look at Trump, two things. Like, who's going to win the election? I was like, oh, well, probably look at the Trump meme coin performance as a good indicator and interest. But also, like, Trump had recently launched his SPAC, right? I was like, look at option volume expiring November, December and January, because if there's a huge spike, someone knows something and Trump's going to win.
01:04:35.056 - 01:04:58.214, Speaker B: Right. The huge donor or whatever. Like Bill Ackman's on the back buying like all the, all the way out of the money call options and the Trump sPAC. Like, if there's a huge spike, I'm like, yeah, I think Trump's gonna win, or whatever. Anyways, none of this political, legal, religious, or any financial advice, for that matter. You shouldn't listen to this. You should post answers to the l three discussion, which is more relevant to any of this.
01:05:01.714 - 01:05:27.406, Speaker A: Did you see the thing about Amazon? Um, so, so Amazon, I don't have a content. I don't have a content of the week this week, but, um, my story of the week is. So there's this. Amazon launched these stores, like, I don't know, five or six or seven years ago. And I remember going to one of the first ones in New York, let's call it in 2016 or 2017. And basically, there are these, uh, employee list stores where it was a full self checkout store. It was crazy.
01:05:27.406 - 01:05:46.318, Speaker A: You put. You get a basket and you'd put in your tomato sauce and your. Your pasta and your oranges and your bananas and your milk, and you just walk out of the store, and it would automatically charge. It automatically charge your. Your, like, Amazon account, I think it was. And you had to have the Amazon account app on your phone. I was like, wow, this is the future.
01:05:46.318 - 01:05:53.354, Speaker A: It just used your palm, or were you using. It wasn't your palm. You'd your. You'd have your phone in your pocket.
01:05:53.654 - 01:05:55.134, Speaker B: Oh, you check in at open gate.
01:05:55.254 - 01:06:23.218, Speaker A: And you'd walk in, and it would, like, scan your phone in your pocket, kind of like walking through a subway turnstile. And I was like, man, this is the future of shopping. This is crazy. It was, like, so efficient. It turns out there's a story that came out this week. The way they were doing this is they had thousands of employees in India, and they had video cameras, like, hundreds of video cameras in each store that were just these tiny little video cameras. And so they were the people in India.
01:06:23.218 - 01:06:43.424, Speaker A: I'd take a tomato sauce off the shelf and put in my grocery cart, and the person in India was just being like, tomato sauce? Adding it to my cart in Amazon, basically. And then. And then charging. And then charging. So it was just completely manual work. And I think they're shutting these stores down and. Yeah, but.
01:06:45.484 - 01:06:49.044, Speaker B: State of the AI market. Fake it till you make it, I guess. Yeah.
01:06:49.084 - 01:06:50.420, Speaker A: You think crypto is bad.
01:06:50.612 - 01:07:02.630, Speaker B: Cool. Well, last thing, content of the week. Well, two things. Two things. I did finish reading the Chris Dixon read, write own really good. That will become a staple of the book that I share with. Someone's asking me here.
01:07:02.630 - 01:07:29.992, Speaker B: I'm getting skiing this week, and someone's saying, um, I'm really crypto, what should I do? And historically, given them the bitcoin standard, which I think it's like a very good book as an introduction by Safi Seifedine, Sephardine. Yeah, yeah. Apologies. And. And now Chris's book.
